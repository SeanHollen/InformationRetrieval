   A high school band director was
arrested during a bank robbery Thursday and confessed to four other
holdups in West Virginia, city police said.
   Donald Hershberger, band leader at George Washington High School
in Charleston, was charged with one count each of aggravated robbery
and kidnapping after attempting to rob the Second Avenue Bank,
Detective David Dunlap said.
   School board member Wayne Crowder called the situation ``tragic
for the school system and for the man.''
   Police were called to the bank shortly before noon when bank
employees recognized Hershberger from photographs distributed after
the previous robberies, said Brenda Robertson, the bank's president.
   After his arrest, Hershberger confessed to robbing two banks in
Charleston, one in Buckhannon, and one in Bridgeport, Dunlop said.
   Hershberger, who police said was carrying a small-caliber pistol,
is being held without bond in the Kanawha County Jail. A hearing was
scheduled for Sept. 15.

<HEAD>In Rainy New York, Umbrella Art Exhibit Cheers Visitors</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Outside, on yet another day when New York felt
like Seattle, people ran with newspapers over their heads to fend
off a summer shower. But inside a Manhattan museum, others pondered
a rain of umbrellas.
   From the ceiling of the American Craft Museum, about 30 artful
umbrellas are suspended in the air, a seeming snapshot of a
free-fall down a three-story-high stairwell. All that's missing is
Mary Poppins.
   The exhibit has lured in many during a season that demanded a
good umbrella: More than 28 inches of rain fell from April to July,
double the norm.
   ``I do think the timing's been wonderful,'' museum director Janet
Kardon said. ``But when it's raining outside, it's quite cheery in
here.''
   ``A Rain of Talent: Umbrella Art,'' was created by painters,
sculptors, architects and ceramicists who were given white umbrellas
and instructions to do as they pleased.
   Most painted whimsical designs. But one artist fused an umbrella
with a kindergarten chair, another hung strands of string inside the
frame to create an image of an umbrella that lets in rain, and a
third painted long knives and daggers for a creation called ``Acid
Rain.''
   A fourth artist robbed her umbrella of its function: it's all
frame, no cloth. And yet another, from Texas, made an inside-out
umbrella that looked as if it had been through a tornado.
   Many visitors said they now will look differently at umbrellas _
and rain.
   ``Most people think depressing things about the rain. But this is
bright and wonderful, almost childlike,'' said Sasha Bergmann of
Santa Barbara, Calif. ``This makes me want to go home and paint my
umbrella and then never use it.''
   Adriana de Freitas, of Rio de Janeiro, said the show was ``like a
crazy rainy day. They had a lot of fun with it.''
   The show, at the museum until Sept. 24, will be at a University
of Chicago gallery early next year and then may tour the country,
said Richard Siegesmund, director of The Fabric Workshop in
Philadelphia, which organized it.
   The Fabric Workshop asked Patterson Sims, curator of modern art
and associate director for art and exhibitions at the Seattle Art
Museum, to create an exhibition. ``Living in Seattle, you are real
conscious of the necessity of having an umbrella, and you want
umbrellas to be as cheerful as possible,'' said Sims, who doesn't
own one.
   ``It's a form of denial,'' he said. ``I just get a little wet.''
   Umbrellas are ``an object that we often review in mundane
fashion,'' Siegesmund said. ``But if you think about it, umbrellas
can become an object of startling beauty and demand consideration as
an art object.''
   But most of the exhibits can still do the job for which they were
designed.
   Edward Henderson, from Stony Point, N.Y., took apart a small
schoolroom chair to create a sort of umbrella-chair, one of the few
exhibits not hanging from the ceiling. It could serve as a child's
all-weather reading spot.
   ``I wanted to make something that would be much more than just an
umbrella,'' said Henderson, a painter and sculptor. ``I wanted to
embellish it. It's very common to put paint on it. So you just
stretch it. You can't take it that seriously, but then I take my art
very seriously.''
   Claire Zeisler, a fiber artist from Chicago, didn't take her
assignment seriously at all. She said ``helpers'' at her studio
thought of putting long strands of string inside her umbrella. ``It
doesn't mean anything, you know. Except that it's fun. Maybe they're
trying to upgrade umbrellas.''

   Singer La Toya Jackson has denied she married
her manager and said an imposter must have signed her name to
wedding documents.
   ``It could have been an imposter,'' Ms. Jackson said Thursday in
a telephone interview with The Associated Press. ``It's totally
untrue that I got married. I'm not ready for marriage yet. I'm too
involved in my career right now.''
   But Washoe County Clerk Judi Bailey on Thursday produced marriage
license No. D044127 purchased Tuesday by La Toya Jackson, 33, and
Jack Gordon, 50, and said the couple went through a legal wedding
ceremony that night.
   ``They had to show their driver's licenses and tell the clerk all
kinds of information in order to prove who they were,'' Ms. Bailey
said. ``They even had to know their mother's maiden name and where
she was born. And where their father was born.''
   Ms. Bailey said the couple brought Antonio Rossi to witness the
marriage ceremony, but Ms. Jackson said she doesn't know the man.
   ``I was surprised when I heard about it,'' Ms. Jackson said of
her reported wedding.
   Ms. Jackson, the sister of pop star Michael Jackson, had been in
the gambling city to perform at Bally's Reno. The concert, scheduled
to be televised on pay television, kicked off a world tour produced
by Gordon.
   Ms. Jackson said her relationship with Gordon is ``strictly
professional.''
   ``He's a great man but not a person I'd settle down with,'' she
said.
   If she were to get married, she said, it would be to ``somebody
that's loving and caring. He's a great manager but managers have to
be hard. I can never be married with a person like that.''
   Ms. Jackson, who posed nude in the January issue of Playboy
magazine, moved out of her parents' home in May after an apparent
rift due to her relationship with Gordon, a former carnival operator
and Las Vegas businessman.

   Government helicopters and
warplanes have stepped up attacks on suspected guerrilla positions
near towns in the northern war zone, but local civilians say the
rockets, bombs and bullets have hit homes in the area and left
civilians terrified.
   A nun said rockets hit near a school where a crowd of children
were at play.
   This town of 1,000 people in the heart of El Salvador's
rebel-dominated mountains was the only municipality to suffer direct
hits in raids Aug. 19-20. But inhabitants of surrounding hamlets are
angered and worried by the government's use of powerful weapons in
civilian areas.
   ``Only by the providence of God was none of the children
killed,'' Sister Teresa Racia said as she described a raid Aug. 19
that left rocket craters and strafing damage across town.
   She said more than 200 children were playing around the adobe
schoolhouse when a helicopter gunship arrived and one rocket crashed
into a hillside 60 yards away and a second just 15 yards away.
   Minutes after the U.S.-supplied UH-1M gunship blasted the
surrounding cornfields and hills, a C-47 warplane strafed Las Flores
with .50-caliber machine guns firing.
   ``The paving stones looked like they were exploding,'' said Elias
Menjivar, whose house was one of a dozen damaged. ``They were even
smoking.''
   Rev. Miguel Vasquez, a Roman Catholic priest in Arcatao, said an
A-37 dropped four bombs Aug. 20 at the nearby hamlet of Santa Rita,
damaging three houses.
   Peasant farmers Andres Cordova and Felipe Orellana said their
hamlet, Los Pozos, was strafed the same day.
   ``There was combat near the houses and they called in the
airplanes,'' Cordova said. ``Six houses were damaged. Everyone was
pani-stricken.''
   Orellana said, ``It seems the planes are coming more often and
closer to the houses, and it makes you afraid.''
   The air force says that air strikes are made only against
military targets. But in densely populated El Salvador few areas are
well away from civilians.
   Chalatenango Province is one of the most fought-over areas in the
nearly decade-old war between the 56,000-member, U.S.-supplied and
-trained armed forces and about 7,000 Marxist-led guerrillas.
   Air power is the armed forces' single biggest tactical advantage
over the rebels, who control a wide northern swath of the
Massachusetts-sized country.
   But the danger of catastrophic error _ such as a direct hit on
the Las Flores schoolhouse _ has increased lately because new
anti-aircraft weapons acquired by the guerrillas force government
pilots to attack from higher altitudes and therefore with less
accuracy.
   Since late last year, the rebels have received several hundred
Soviet-designed Dragunov sniper rifles. When used against aircraft,
the Dragunov's effective range of 3,000 feet obliges government
pilots to stay higher in the sky.
   The guerrillas also have obtained several thousand AK-47 rifles
and they have been trained to fire them at helicopters and aircraft
flying below 2,000 feet.
   While they rarely bring down aircraft, the groundfire wounds
crewmen and damages the aircraft. Pilots report taking more hits and
abandoning more missions than at any time in the war.

<HEAD>National Party Suffers From Trying to Please Both Right and Left</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   White voters sent mixed
messages to the governing National Party, but one point was clear:
The government will get nowhere trying to please both reformists and
racists.
   Following his party's record election losses to both right and
left, Acting President F.W. de Klerk will be under pressure to
signal clearly and quickly which way he will turn.
   The result could well be a divorce between the government and
hard-line segregationists, whose gains Wednesday fell short of their
own predictions.
   De Klerk implied such a split in his post-election news
conference Thursday, when he lumped his party and the anti-apartheid
Democratic Party together as advocates of ``renewal and reform.''
   But a break with the right will not guarantee success or
acceptance for the centerpiece of de Klerk's reform program _ a
vague ``five-year plan'' to bring the voteless black majority into
national politics without jeopardizing white sovereignty.
   The crucial political debate, at least within the realm of white
politics, now may take place within National Party ranks. Is it
serious about granting blacks political rights? Will it phase out
segregation laws? Will jailed black nationalist Nelson Mandela be
freed?
   ``The Nationalists can no longer attempt to satisfy, on both
sides, those who want reform and those who want regression,'' The
Daily News, the leading newspaper in Durban, said in the editorial
Thursday. ``De Klerk has the clearest mandate for real change. Will
he act on it?''
   Zulu leader Mangosuthu Buthelezi, one of the country's most
powerful black moderates, said the election marked the start of ``an
entirely new and very distinctive political era'' in which South
Africa was moving inexorably away from apartheid toward democracy.
   But Buthelezi said his optimism was dependent on de Klerk
``having the guts to go further than he ever thought he would have
to go.''
   Helen Suzman, who has retired after 36 years as standard-bearer
for the liberal opposition in Parliament, said de Klerk should write
off the far right and develop more concrete reform proposals.
   ``He's now got to produce the goods,'' she said. ``Otherwise both
locally and internationally his credibility will disappear.''
   A similar view was expressed by Alfred Nzo, secretary-general of
the outlawed African National Congress guerrilla movement. He said
at a summit of non-aligned nations in Yugoslavia that de Klerk ``now
has to prove the honesty, sincerity and seriousness'' of his pledges
to negotiate a solution to South Africa's problems.
   De Klerk, expected to be elected next week to a five-year term as
president, has called for all-party talks aimed at negotiating a new
constitution. But he says the ANC can participate only if it
renounces its use of violence.
   Militant anti-apartheid leaders in South Africa reiterated their
rejection of segregated elections and dismissed suggestions de Klerk
be given an opportunity to prove his sincerity.
   ``De Klerk has spoken to us, the oppressed ... with tear gas,
with sjamboks (whips), with water cannons ... with all the
repressive instruments at his government's disposal,'' said the
South African Council of Churches. ``We consider it folly to give a
chance to such a regime.''
   In the election, the far-right Conservative Party won 31 percent
of the total vote and increased its parliamentary strength from 22
to 39 seats.
   But political analysts suggested the party had little potential
for further growth, in part because the parliamentary districts are
due to be redrawn in a way that will reduce the power of the
Conservatives' rural strongholds.
   The Democratic Party won 33 of the 166 elected seats in
Parliament's dominant white chamber, a gain of 13, and received 20
percent of the total vote. It won decisively in the three largest
cities _ Johannesburg, Cape Town and Durban _ where segregation laws
are crumbling most rapidly.
   Like the Conservatives, the Democrats' prospects for further big
gains appear limited. But their successes Wednesday could motivate
de Klerk as he chooses his response to what Buthelezi called ``an
epoch-making golden opportunity.''

   President Saddam Hussein has offered $1.5
million to any Iraqi who can solve a 3,000-year-old puzzle _ how
King Nebuchadnezzar managed to water the fabled Hanging Gardens of
Babylon.
   Archaeologists are divided over whether the gardens, said to have
graced terraces hundreds of feet above the palm-fringed Euphrates,
existed. They reputedly were built by Nebuchadnezzar in the 6th
century B.C. to enchant his homesick queen, the Median princess
Amytis.
   The ancient Greeks considered the gardens one of the seven
wonders of the world, but Nebuchadnezzar made no mention of them in
his detailed writings, and no conclusive evidence they existed has
been uncovered.
   But the Iraqi government, which is rebuilding the city where
Nebuchadnezzar ruled ancient Mesopotamia from 604 B.C. to 562 B.C.,
believes they did exist based on findings by German archaeologists
who first excavated Babylon more than 75 years ago.
   Hussein, who is known as Saddam in Iraq and the Arab world,
announced a $1.5 million prize for whomever comes up with the most
plausible watering system, and $750,000 to the runner-up.
   The winning system likely will be used if the Iraqis decide to go
ahead and reconstruct the hanging gardens as part of their effort to
restore the crumbled city in what is now central Iraq.
   No modern technology can be employed in the watering system, only
the primitive tools available in 6th century B.C. Mesopotamia.
   Hussein said the contest is for Iraqis only and will be judged by
Iraqi archaeologists, but Iraqi embassies around the world
reportedly have been flooded with telephone calls, cables and
letters from foreigners eager to participate.
   Archaeologists have been excavating Babylon for decades but never
have been able to figure out how the Mesopotamians, without modern
pumping systems, watered the gardens that reputedly were on terraces
high above the Euphrates River.
   Legend says the terraced gardens had seven levels, and the most
likely method of watering them was a type of system that hauled
buckets up from the Euphrates.
   Some scientists believe the gardens may have been as high as 365
feet above the ground.
   Officials said scores of Iraqi engineers and architects have
ideas on how the Babylonians did it, but they refuse to give details.
   The Soviet news agency Tass reported last month that Leonid
Khasenevich, an engineer from Minsk, claimed to have solved the
mystery and wanted to take part in the Baghdad contest.
   ``A hitherto unstudied hydraulics phenomenon, which I discovered
in 1982, helped me solve this puzzle,'' he was quoted as saying.
   Khasenevich, a hydrologist for 30 years, said that after
experimenting with models, ``I came to the conclusion that parts of
the construction may be unearthed on the Hill of Babel'' near the
biblical tower where God punished the people by making them speak in
different tongues.
   He refused to give details of his findings, but noted: ``I
believe the technology of water inlets was primitive and did not
require large mechanisms, which would have spoiled the beauty of the
famous gardens.''
   Robert Koldewey and Walter Andrae, the German archaeologists who
excavated Babylon before World War I, believed that underground
chambers beneath what were once the towering walls of
Nebuchadnezzar's palace were the foundations of the hanging gardens.
   Georges Roux of France, who spent years in Iraq, wrote in his
book ``Ancient Iraq,'' a respected general history of the country,
that in the cellars beneath the palace, excavators found ``an
unusual well with three shafts, side by side, probably used in
connection with a chain-pump.
   ``It is extremely tempting to see in this construction the
under-structure of the roof gardens, the famous Hanging Gardens of
Babylon.''
   Other experts believe the chambers were for storage and that the
gardens may have been west of the palace in an unexcavated area.
   The Persians destroyed the magnificent city in 539 B.C. What was
left standing crumbled into dust.

   To some, they look like little clowns with
conical hats. Others find them so ugly they build brick walls to
hide them.
   But to Wally Rosenwach and Scott Hockhauser, the wooden water
tanks that dot New York's skyline are matters of family pride.
   The two men run businesses that have been competing with each
other for nearly a century in making, installing and fixing the
ubiquitous brown tanks. Between them, Rosenwach Tanks and its rival,
Isseks Tanks, handle just about all the rooftop tanks in New York
City.
   And both men are tickled that in an age of computers, skyscrapers
and synthetics, most New Yorkers get their water via a wooden barrel
on the roof.
   ``When I tell people the tanks are wood, they don't believe it,''
said Hockhauser, 28, who runs Isseks with his brother, 32, and their
mother.
   ``They say, `Come on, aren't those tanks made out of steel or
Plexiglas?'''
   Some water tanks are indeed made of steel, like those atop the
Empire State Building. But wood insulates better from heat and cold,
is easily repaired, and doesn't have to be painted every five years
like steel. Even U.S. Steel's Manhattan headquarters gets water from
wooden tanks, said Rosenwach, chairman of his family's company.
   How long do the tanks last? ``Too long,'' Rosenwach said. ``We
just replaced a tank that my father had put up in 1926.''
   While wooden water tanks are used on some buildings in other
large cities, in New York, with its great density of tall apartment
buildings, they are fixtures on the landscape.
   ``You can't have a skyline without the tanks,'' Rosenwach said.
   The tanks are required by law on most tall buildings, so that
water will be available in case of fire.
   A few buildings, like the World Trade Center, use electrical
pumps alone to bring water up from the city's underground pipes. But
for water to be available on top floors any time a faucet turns on,
the pumps must run constantly.
   Rooftop tanks are more efficient, requiring the use of pumps only
when the water in the barrel drops below a certain level and more
must be brought up from the ground. Gravity then allows the water to
flow to each floor as needed. The typical tank holds 10,000 gallons,
stands 12 feet high and is mounted on a steel structure 20 feet
high. The height makes tank work on a windy day dangerous if not
impossible.
   The tanks are made from redwood or cedar staves cut to size in
the factory, assembled on the roof and encircled by galvanized iron
hoops. The cone-shaped tops, made from plywood, keep rain, snow and
contaminants out and trap air inside, which adds insulation in
wintertime.
   ``With the hoops pressing in and the water pressing out, it makes
it watertight,'' Hockhauser said.
   Isseks has its factory in Philadelphia, while Rosenwach's is in
the New York City borough of Brooklyn.
   ``One of the things that comes up very often is, are we related
to our competitor?'' Hockhauser said. ``My great-aunt Lily, who is
my oldest living relative, says yes, there is a relationship way
back when, and no one disagrees with this _ at least no one here.
   ``When my great-grandfather started the business here in 1890,
Rosenwach came over and worked for them, because he was a distant
cousin, and then there was a falling-out of some sort.''
   Poppycock, says Rosenwach.
   ``This whole bit about when who started what business is silly,''
he said. ``They say their grandfather has been in business since
1890, but I think their grandfather didn't come over until 1896.''
That was the year Rosenwach's grandfather bought the tank company
he'd been working for and gave it his own name.
   While they differ on their companies' origins, Rosenwach and
Hockhauser agree that their products are aesthetically pleasing.
   ``Nowadays, they hide the tanks in brick enclosures,'' Hockhauser
lamented. ``The sort of people who care most about the way things
look, the artists who live in SoHo, they love 'em. But the yuppie
who lives on the Upper East Side, who just bought his apartment, he
doesn't want to see a water tank when he looks outside.''
   Said Rosenwach: ``I feel towards them like nobody else. ... They
are friendly little people to me.''

   While Irish citizens find it difficult to immigrate
to the United States, hundreds of Americans in recent years have
taken advantage of Irish laws that make it relatively easy to claim
Irish citizenship.
   Americans who become Irish citizens can easily establish
residency in Ireland, obtain an Irish passport or gain access to the
11 other countries of the European Community.
   But nostalgia seems to be the main reason many Americans seek a
link to the Emerald Isle, officials say.
   ``I think the majority of people do this out of a sense, really,
of their Irish heritage,'' said Declan Kelleher, spokesman for the
Irish Embassy in Washington.
   Kelleher said interest in dual citizenship was negligible until
about seven years ago. Since 1985, about 4,100 Americans have
claimed their Irish citizenship, about 1,300 from the Boston area.
This year, 600 nationwide have applied, 400 to the consulate in New
York.
   Foreigners have been able to claim Irish citizenship since 1956.
   One of those to apply this year was Bob McCarthy, of Lewiston,
Idaho. His grandparents came from Ireland, and soon after landing in
Boston in the 1890s they moved to work at a Montana smelter.
   McCarthy, a lawyer, said he hopes to live in Ireland some day to
gain a new perspective on America's history.
   ``I think that it's helpful, in terms to understand where you
come from and in terms of knowing yourself,'' he said by telephone.
``And I think the ethnicity of people in the United States is an
important element that shouldn't be forgotten.''
   Obtaining dual citizenship does not jepoardize one's U.S.
citizenship as long as the second country does not require any
superseding oath of allegiance, said Phil Covington of the State
Department's consular bureau.
   Ireland, Israel, the United Kingdom, Italy and Canada are the
five countries from which most Americans obtain dual citizenship.
Embassies for the other countries could not provide figures.
   ``They are generally places that don't make it difficult to
obtain or require a strong oath of allegiance which would make it
difficult for an American to obtain citizenship,'' he said.
   Although rules vary from country to country, an American
generally must have a blood tie, or birthright, to claim citizenship
from a foreign country.
   Countries from which it is difficult to obtain dual citizenship
are Mexico, Spain, Austria, and Germany. They require new citizens
to renounce old allegiances.
   In 1986, the Irish citizenship law was tightened. The rules are
as follows:
   _ Anyone whose parents were born in Ireland is automatically an
Irish citizen and simply needs to register with the embassy or a
consulate.
   _ Grandchildren of people born in Ireland must prove their link
by presenting their birth certificates and those of their ancestors,
or other documentation. A $153 registration fee is also required.
   ``Beyond that a family can continue to evoke the right, but there
is one provision,'' Kelleher said. ``And that is that at the time of
the birth of whoever chooses to invoke that right, their parents
were already Irish citizens.''

<HEAD>Navy Report Cites Hartwig as `Most Likely' to Have Caused Blast</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: INSERTS details of disciplinary recommendations in grafs 34-35:
``The Milligan,'' minor editing to tighten</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SUSANNE M. SCHAFER</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Navy said Thursday that gunner's mate
Clayton Hartwig ``most likely'' caused the explosion that killed 47
sailors aboard the USS Iowa by shoving a detonator between gunpowder
bags in one of the battleship's huge guns.
   The formal report on the explosion, the worst naval disaster
since the Vietnam War, said the exact cause cannot be pinpointed
since the sailors close enough to see what was going on, including
Hartwig, were all killed in the fiery blast.
   However, Rear Adm. Richard Milligan, presenting the official
conclusions at a Pentagon briefing, said much ``circumstantial
information'' pointed to Hartwig, whose job put him closest to the
gun.
   He cited an FBI psychological profile of Hartwig ``with the
opinion that he took his own life and hoped it looked like an
accident.''
   Members of Hartwig's family strongly disputed the Navy
conclusion. Family lawyer Kreig J. Brusnahan said, ``Dead men can't
defend themselves, the Navy knows that.''
   Milligan said Hartwig was a ``loner'' and a man with ``low
self-esteem'' who had a series of male ``principal friends''
throughout his life. But the admiral and other military briefers
said ``there is no substantive proof'' that Hartwig was homosexual
``and there is no mention of that in the report.''
   Adm. Leon Edney, the vice chief of naval operations, said of
Hartwig, ``He was a clean-cut sailor. He didn't smoke. He didn't
drink. He didn't carouse on leave. ... He wasn't a troublemaker.''
   ``We don't know the motivation,'' Edney said.
   The Navy admirals said investigators extensively questioned
Hartwig's acquaintances and family after the explosion.
   After more than four months of investigation, the Navy concluded,
``The explosion was most probably caused by an intentional act. The
weight of evidence indicates that some type of detonation device was
deliberately placed between the powder bags being rammed into the
breech of the center gun.''
   As evidence, the investigators cited ``foreign material'' found
on the projectile that remained in the gun barrel after the
explosion. Milligan said the Navy's tests showed that a detonation
device apparently was placed between the first and second bags of
gunpowder, and that it could have been composed of such simple
elements as bleach, brake fluid and steel wool.
   ``The most likely person with the access, knowledge and possible
motivation to accomplish this act has been identified as Gunner's
Mate 2nd Class Clayton M. Hartwig, USN, the center gun captain in
turret II at the time of the explosion,'' the Navy said.
   Milligan said no accidental cause could be found, and a criminal
investigation was launched after Hartwig's sister, Kathy Kubicina,
disclosed the existence of a $100,000 accidental death and
dismemberment policy on her brother's life, naming gunner's mate 3rd
class Kendall Truitt as a beneficiary.
   The Navy's conclusions were immediately disputed by Hartwig's
relatives, who have asked for a separate congressional investigation.
   ``I never believed it right from the start,'' said his sister,
who attended a briefing by Navy officials at her father's home in
Cleveland.
   Earl Hartwig, the dead sailor's father, said, ``I think there was
a powder explosion _ accidental _ that caused the explosion.''
   Truitt, one of the crew who survived the blast in the lowest
level of the massive gun turret, has demanded an apology from the
Navy, contending it leaked information about the investigation to
the news media in order to find a scapegoat, Edney rejected the idea
of an apology.
   At a news conference in Miami, Truitt's attorney Ellis Rubin
dismissed the Navy's version of the explosion, saying, ``Our
information was that it was the Navy's negligence, untrained and
unqualified crew members and 50-year-old technology, dangerous from
day one.''
   The Navy report found numerous lapses in the record-keeping of
the gun crew's training, the requirements for handling the World War
II-vintage ship's weapons and safety procedures.
   But the Navy said ``these shortcomings did not cause the
explosion.''
   The report said investigators found that Hartwig had experimented
with explosive devices and detonators, had frequently talked about
dying and had a fascination with ship disasters.
   The investigators said Hartwig had recently had a falling-out
with an extremely close friend and that on the night before the
explosion his attempts at ``a close relationship'' with another
sailor had been rejected.
   The Navy, in its 1,100-page report, said the investigation had
ruled out technical failure or an accidental cause for the April 19
blast.
   Investigators said Hartwig, as the gun captain, was responsible
for overseeing the loading of the 16-inch gun during the
battleship's gunnery exercises some 330 miles from Puerto Rico.
   The report said he could have hidden a small, homemade detonating
device in a pack that is normally placed between the bags of powder
and helps clean the barrel out after the explosion.
   Hartwig was positioned at the breech of the gun, meaning that he
would have been the first killed when the massive force of the
explosion blew backwards through the open barrel and into the
seven-story gun turret.
   The Navy officials noted that the report's conclusions about
Hartwig were based on circumstantial evidence. But they contended
that this evidence, combined with an exhaustive FBI and Naval
Investigative Service studies of the blast, supported their theories.
   The $4 million Navy investigation involved interviews with more
than 318 people and 20,000 tests, some trying to simulate the
explosion.
   Only 11 survivors, none nearby, lived through the fireball, which
tore through the No. 2, or middle, gun turret. The 16-inch weapons
aboard the battleship can fire 2,700 pound shells a distance of 23
miles.
   Each projectile is propelled by explosives loaded into the gun
barrel contained in silk bags. The gun usually requires up to six
bags, each containing about 100 pounds of black gunpowder.
   The investigators said the foreign material that was found in the
gun should not have been there under normal firing conditions.
   They also said their tests showed that an exact replica of the
explosion could only have occurred if a detonating device had been
placed between the first and second bags of gunpowder. Such a device
could have gone off when the rammer, supposedly directed by Hartwig,
pushed the silk bags of powder together in the gun's barrel.
   The ship's commander, Capt. Fred P. Moosally, the ship's
executive officer, weapons officer and gunnery officer are all
expected to be called to explain on-board proceedural lapses in a
hearing that could determine whether any punishment will be meted
out.
   The Milligan report recommended charges against five individuals
whose names were blanked out, ``appropriate administrative action''
to caution three people, including the executive officer of the
ship, ``with respect to ... duties,'' removal of the gunnery officer
and the weapons officer from their jobs and administrative or
disciplinary action against another person _ one recommendation not
approved by the chief of naval operations.
   The endorsement by the chief of naval operations concurred in a
recommendation by the commander of surface forces, Atlantic Fleet,
that the captain and executive officer not be subject to judicial
action or removal. But the Navy's chief directed that special
reprimands be prepared for them.
   In a statement released at the Pentagon, Moosally said he
accepted the conclusion that the explosion was caused by an
intentional act, and he said he took full responsibility for any
shortcomings found aboard his ship and had ``no excuses'' for them.
   Saying all administrative problems have been corrected, the
captain praised his crew's efforts in helping recover from the
disaster. ``We are relieved that the investigation is now complete
and that we can put this sad episode behind us,'' the statement said.

<HEAD>Japan Sends Entry to Dallas for International Cockroach Contest</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVE PEGO</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>DALLAS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Michael Bohdan says the entry to his company's
contest from Japan is somewhat reassuring.
   ``Yeah, they've got cockroaches, too,'' he said.
   Bohdan, whose wife refuses to let him bring his work home, is one
of four regional coordinators of a contest to find the largest
cockroach in the world. The American Cyanamid Co. is paying $1,000
to whoever brings in the largest cockroach.
   The largest cockroach found in the contest in Japan arrived
earlier this week at Bohdan's office.
   ``The customs guys were joking, saying they didn't have to worry
about it being any kind of endangered species,'' said Bohdan, who
has appeared on ``The Tonight Show'' and ``Hour Magazine'' to show
off some of the many varieties of cockroach he keeps at his office.
   The Japanese entry, however, may not be a contender. Like some of
the country's imports, it's compact.
   ``Well, it may be small, but you have to talk about quality. It's
a quality roach,'' said Ira Caplan of American Cyanamid of Japan, in
a telephone interview from Tokyo.
   The entry, which won about $800 for Kazuko Miyagi of Okinawa, is
about 1} inches long. Caplan said Miyagi's daughter actually caught
the roach in her bathroom, but just got engaged and was too shy
about entering it herself.
   The Japanese consider it a great embarrassment to have
cockroaches, Caplan said.
   ``We had a group of housewives in a focus-group study and asked
them how they felt about roaches,'' he explained. ``One woman said,
`I'm so embarrassed by them. When the exterminator van pulls up in
front of my house, I hope my neighbors think I'm having an affair.'''
   Some Japanese specimens arrived in matchbox-sized, satin-lined
caskets.
   Bohdan said all entries in the contest must be of the American
cockroach species, and the largest found to date has been about 2
inches.
   ``We're hoping to find a larger one now that the search has gone
international,'' he said.
   Bohdan said he anticipates receiving entries soon from Korea,
Spain, Australia and Egypt.
   About 250 roaches have been entered so far, most of them from
Florida. Other regional judging points are in Miami, New York and
Hollywood.
   The eventual winner will receive not only the $1,000 prize, but
something that probably will prevent entering again next year _ a
year's supply of the company's Combat roach bait trays.
   Each regional champion also gets a trip for two to New York for
the Nov. 1 finals.
   But the bad news is the flight reservations are for the finder
and the roach, not two people.

<HEAD>Baby Dies, Suspected Victim of Antifreeze Poisoning</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HILLSBORO, Mo. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A 5-month-old boy whom police believe was
poisoned when his mother fed him antifreeze on two occasions died
Thursday night, hospital officials said.
   Ryan Stallings died about 9 p.m. at Cardinal Glennon Children's
Hospital, spokeswoman Laura Sosa said. An autopsy was scheduled for
Friday.
   His mother, Patricia Stallings, 24, of Hillsboro, is charged with
first-degree assault on her son, said Capt. Wally Gansmann of the
Jefferson County Sheriff's Department. Further charges were pending,
he said.
   Gansmann said Stallings' husband was shocked to learn of the
allegations. He is not a suspect, Gansmann said.
   Authorities believe Stallings may have fed the infant antifreeze
as early as July, and again last week by putting it in baby bottles
and giving it to the infant during her weekly visit to a foster home
where the boy had been living.
   Authorities sent Ryan to the foster home in August after
suspecting that the boy was fed antifreeze in July.
   Gansmann said investigators suspect that the boy was poisoned a
second time Aug. 31 during a visit by his mother, but he declined to
provide any details.
   ``We have baby bottles and formula being tested in the
laboratory,'' he said. Testing is under way on bottles from both
incidents, Gansmann said.
   In July, the infant appeared to suffer abdominal pains and was
hospitalized for two weeks, Gansmann said. Foul play was suspected
and Stallings was charged, he said.
   The child then was assigned to the supervision of the state
Division of Family Services for six weeks, Gansmann said.
   Stallings was allowed to visit the child once weekly at the
foster home, where a worker supervised each visit, including the
most recent one last Thursday, Gansmann said.
   ``On Friday, he (Ryan) started having some difficulties, and, by
Monday, he was back with the same symptoms as before,'' the captain
said. The baby's symptoms included drowsiness, vomiting, nausea and
mild convulsions.
   Stallings, who is pregnant with her third child, was in custody
in Washington County Jail in Potosi.

   A suspect left some evidence behind when he
accidentally taped a telephone call in which he asked his father to
give him a ride home from a house he had burglarized, police said.
   Police used the tape as evidence Tuesday when they arrested Paul
Caliguiri of Pittsburgh in the burglary and another break-in the
same day, Police Chief William Eckert said.
   Caliguiri, 24, was charged with burglary, theft and receiving
stolen property. His father, Albert Caliguiri, was charged with
hindering apprehension.
   After someone reported a suspicious person outside, police used a
dog to search the apartment complex and found a home had been
ransacked, the chief said. The suspect apparently had fled to a
nearby home, where he telephoned his father, apparently unaware he
had turned on the machine's tape recorder.
   ``On the tape, he addresses the man he's called as his father,''
Eckert said. ``He says, `It's Paul. The police are chasing me. Come
get me.'''
   The burglar filled a suitcase with items from the house,
including the answering machine, but after he left, he dropped the
suitcase nearby, Eckert said.
   The next day, the homeowners played the tape and turned it over
to police, Eckert said.

   Only 12 jurors remained Thursday to deliberate
the McMartin preschool molestation trial after a juror was
hospitalized with a rare blood ailment, the judge said Thursday.
   Superior Court Judge William Pounders said he was ``shaken''
after conferring with the juror and his doctor.
   ``If he was asked to continue (to serve in the trial), the next
six weeks is a critical period and might cause his death,'' Pounders
said.
   Although the unspecified blood disease is not contagious,
Pounders said that the juror has a secondary illness of shingles _ a
contagious variant of the chicken pox virus.
   Pounders said it won't be known until next week whether other
jurors have been infected. ``Even though we may have the jurors
coming down with chicken pox, that's at least manageable if not
desirable,'' the judge said.
   He said he would formally excuse the ailing juror on Monday when
the other panelists return to court.
   The juror's dismissal will pare the remaining panel to just 12
with no alternates available. The loss of one more juror could force
a mistrial in the case of Raymond Buckey, 31, and his mother, Peggy
McMartin Buckey, 62.
   They are charged with 64 counts of molestation in what has become
the nation's longest and possibly costliest criminal trial. Expenses
have topped $15 million.

<TEXT>
   Two national wrestling organizations, in
a no-holds-barred grudge match, are pitted against each other over
use of Nashville's Municipal Auditorium and other arenas in the
country.
   Squaring off are representatives of muscular wrestler Hulk Hogan
against representatives of cable TV strongman Ted Turner.
   Just like the classic wrestling gimmick, the loser may have to
leave town.
   The National Wrestling Alliance, which Turner purchased last
November, claims the World Wrestling Federation decided to rent the
auditorium May 6 to hurt the attendance of alliance matches the
following day. The alliance claims the same thing happened again
last week and also has occurred in Boston, Baltimore, Philadelphia
and Little Rock, Ark.
   ``The WWF is trying to dominate a lot of the markets by shutting
us out or monopolizing,'' said Don Glass, director of arena bookings
for the Atlanta-based alliance.
   He added, ``They come in and use squash tactics.''
   Ed Cohen, vice president of arena booking for the WWF, refused to
comment Thursday on the matter.
   The auditorium commission heard five-minute presentations from
both Glass and Cohen this week and got a ringside view of the
wrestling promotion companies.
   The tug-of-war left commission member Joe Meeks exasperated.
   ``Why don't we just put up a ring and let 'em fight it out,'' he
suggested.
   The commission, in a decision comparable to a draw in wrestling
terms, agreed to study the dispute further. But in the meantime the
commissioners decided on a temporary policy to schedule only one
night of matches every 10 days in the 9,000-seat auditorium.
   The WWF televises its matches from throughout the country on the
USA cable network and on local stations. It also has matches
periodically on NBC, often in the time spot normally occupied by
``Saturday Night Live.''
   Its wrestlers include Hogan, Andre the Giant and Randy ``Macho
Man'' Savage.
   The alliance uses Turner's WTBS cable superstation to popularize
its wrestlers, who include flamboyant blond Ric Flair, Lex ``The
Total Package'' Lugar and the Road Warriors.

<HEAD>Prince's New Town to Express His Vision of Britain</HEAD>
<HEAD>An AP Extra</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GRAHAM HEATHCOTE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Prince Charles has charged to the front again in
his crusade for more aesthetic buildings.
   He hopes a new town he is having built on his estates will
demonstrate his concern for a better environment for the people who
live in it.
   ``I am not mad enough to try to create my ideal town _ there is
no such thing. I am trying to show that man cannot live by
technology alone,'' the prince said Thursday at a party for his new
book on architecture, ``A Vision of Britain.''
   The prince has promoted a long-running debate on modern
buildings, likening some to ``Frankenstein monsters,'' unloved by
anyone except the people who designed them.
   When the town of Dorchester in southwestern England asked to buy
land adjoining the prince's Duchy of Cornwall estate to house 8,000
to 10,000 people, Charles decided not to sell but to oversee the
building himself.
   ``We should see something going up there within a year,'' said
Leon Krier, the prince's main architectural adviser.
   Krier designed the new town, named Poundbury, and shares the
prince's convictions that buildings should be on a human scale and
in harmony with their surroundings.
   ``The town will have homes up to four stories and some apartment
blocks, side by side with clean and silent high-technology
industries, and all the services needed by its residents within 10
minutes' walk,'' he said.
   About 600 people attended the book party, held at the Victoria
and Albert Museum, which is staging an exhibition based on the book.
   ``A Vision of Britain'' is about the heir to the throne's
architectural likes and dislikes.
   Charles does not like office blocks towering over Sir Christopher
Wren's renaissance cathedral of St. Paul's on the London skyline,
wayside gas stations, factories, department stores and high-rise
apartments on wind-swept plains.
   He likes tradition _ classical-style buildings with porticoes,
columns and decorations, and housing in turn-of-the-century styles.
   Charles said the exhibition ``illustrates some pretty horrifying
mistakes'' in modern British architecture but was staged ``in the
belief that tomorrow's architecture will be better.''
   In Poundbury, he said, ``I am determined to try to achieve
something which I hope the people of Dorchester will one day be
proud of and in that sense this will be my own small contribution to
the vision of Britain.''
   He said he hoped Poundbury would encourage other communities that
have a sense of belonging, and enhance the local environment.
   ``I think it's excellent that the prince has brought architecture
into the public realm of debate,'' said Thomas Fridstein, London
director of the Chicago-based Skidmore, Owings and Merrill
architectural firm. ``But I don't feel he is fully aware of some of
the problems.''
   Sir Andrew Darbyshire, one of Britain's most distinguished
architects, said: ``He is making people interested in what we do and
the more we are challenged the harder we will try to do better.''
   ``People don't care enough about buildings in this country _ I
think it's our education system, which is very literary, not
visual,'' he said.

<HEAD>Study Hits `Superslow' Toxic Waste Cleanup by Superfund</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LEE SIEGEL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Science Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SANTA MONICA, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Only 34 of America's 1,175 worst
toxic waste dumps were cleaned during the first eight years of the
Superfund program, and polluters paid less than one-tenth of the
cost, the Rand Corp. said today.
   ``Superfund has been superslow at cleaning up toxic waste sites,
spending available funds and recovering its outlays from those who
did the polluting,'' the non-profit think tank said in a statement
summarizing the study by its Institute for Civil Justice.
   The report, released today, details the federal Environmental
Protection Agency's Superfund accomplishments between 1980 _ when
the program was created in response to toxic waste problems such as
the abandoned landfill at Love Canal, N.Y. _ and September 1988.
   ``The bottom line is that we passed legislation that could have
permitted as much as $10 billion of federal money to start cleaning
up hazardous waste sites,'' said Jan Paul Acton, who wrote the study.
   ``Congress has appropriated only about half that amount, and EPA
has only spent a quarter of that amount. What we've got is a gap
between the rhetoric and the reality.''
   Acton found only 34 dumps were declared clean out of 1,175 on a
high-priority list of 30,000 hazardous waste sites that eventually
may need cleanup.
   The report also found EPA spent only $2.6 billion of the $4.5
billion in Superfund money appropriated by Congress during
1980-1988, and only $1.6 billion went directly to cleanup work, with
the rest spent on management and legal costs.
   The agency recovered only $230 million of the $2.6 billion from
polluters, who are supposed to pay for the cleanup work, the study
said.
   ``We think improvements are possible, but substantial progress
has been made,'' said Walter Kovalick Jr., the EPA's deputy director
of Superfund.
   While only 34 dumps had been declared clean by September 1988,
Kovalick said cleanup is under way on more than 170 others. Designs
for waste isolation or treatment facilities or other cleanup work
are in progress at 230 dumps. Studies of the extent of contamination
and cleanup options are under way for more than 640 other waste
sites, Kovalick said.
   The $2.6 billion actually spent doesn't include formal EPA
obligations to pay for work under way, Kovalick said by telephone
from Washington. Only a fraction of cleanup costs has been recovered
from polluters because ``it's hard to recover the money until you've
finished the project.''
   After President Bush appointed him, EPA Administrator William
Reilly ordered an internal review that criticized Superfund. Reilly
pledged in June to toughen toxic waste cleanup enforcement.
   Rand blamed cleanup delays partly on EPA sluggishness under
former President Reagan _ when Superfund official Rita Lavelle went
to prison for perjured testimony to Congress _ and on high staff
turnover, confused management, failure to learn from experience and
other inefficiencies at the agency.
   The study also said the cleanup effort is lagging because of
court battles due to the Superfund requirement that the EPA make
polluters perform or pay for cleanup work whenever possible. If
companies responsible for pollution can't be identified or no longer
exist, then the Superfund trust fund pays.
   When the Superfund law comes before Congress for reauthorization
in 1991, lawmakers may want to ask whether attempting to make
polluters pay is worth the delay, Acton said.
   ``We could say let's forget about cost recovery and then clean
sites like we build highways,'' with taxpayers footing the bill,
Acton said.
   That possibility was criticized by Linda Greer, technical
director of the Hazardous Waste Treatment Council, which represents
companies that do cleanup work.
   ``There is no inherent reason EPA cannot go ahead and
aggressively clean up these sites, then go back to the responsible
parties (polluters) and get the money,'' she said. ``There's no
reason for the American taxpayer to pay for industrial dumping.''
   Congress is unlikely to make taxpayers assume more cleanup costs
given existing budget woes, said Tom Gilroy, spokesman for the
Chemical Manufacturers Association.
   While other industries have tried to escape cleanup costs, ``our

   A group of Cypriots has established a
foundation to help Lebanese children orphaned or made homeless by
the civil war in their country.
   The Children of Lebanon Foundation has no political, racial or
religious leanings and will provide relief for Christian and Moslem
Lebanese children, founding member Kyriacos Pattichis said at a news
conference Thursday.
   ``The extent of the poverty and suffering of these children is
indescribable,'' said Pattichis, who visited Lebanon last month.
``At least 75,000 of them have been handicapped or maimed by
shells.''
   The foundation has established offices in all main towns to
collect donations in money or goods for the children.
   Cyprus, only 100 miles off the coast of Lebanon, is the main
transit point for Lebanese fleeing the 14-year-old civil war.
   Cypriot authorities estimate the Lebanese community in Cyprus has
grown from 7,000 to 20,000 in the last couple of months.

   The Iranian government will introduce new
foreign exchange controls to regulate the booming black market, an
Iranian financial magazine reported.
   All money dealers will be licensed and will not be allowed to buy
foreign currency from foreign nationals, Iran's official Islamic
Republic News Agency quoted the magazine Latest Economic Issues as
saying.
   The dealers, who operate in the bazaars of Tehran and other
cities, trade foreign currencies at 10 to 15 times the exchange rate
set by the Central Bank, the news agency said in a report monitored
in Nicosia.
   The magazine said Iranians will be allowed to take a certain
amount of foreign currency out of the country without special
permission, but any business transactions over a set limit will have
to comply with new regulations.
   The report did not say when the measures will go into effect.
   The move was viewed as part of a policy by President Hashemi
Rafsanjani to improve the country's economy.

<HEAD>Long-Delayed Tritium Production to Resume in Fall 1990</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT BURNS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Energy Department says it will resume
production of tritium, an increasingly scarce gas needed to make
nuclear warheads, in fall 1990 despite urgings by environmental
groups for a further delay.
   The first of three tritium-producing reactors at the department's
Savannah River complex near Aiken, S.C., will begin low-power
testing late next summer, and production is expected to start
between October and December 1990, Energy Secretary James D. Watkins
said Thursday after briefing White House officials on the plan.
   Watkins said precise dates for the restart schedule will not be
set before next April after department officials review progress in
a broad management and mechanical overhaul under way at Savannah
River since last fall.
   The three active reactors at Savannah River _ designated K, L and
P _ are the nation's only source of tritium, a manmade hydrogen
isotope used to boost the destructive power of nuclear weapons. All
three have been out of operation since spring 1988.
   Environmental groups criticized the announcement, saying it means
the reactors will be back in operation before all safety questions
are answered.
   ``The Energy Department is certainly not putting safety first _
restart is still No. 1,'' said Brian Costner, director of the Energy
Research Foundation, a Columbia, S.C.-based group that wants the
reactors closed down permanently.
   Costner's organization joined the environmental groups Greenpeace
and Natural Resources Defense Council in suing the Energy Department
in December to force Watkins to complete an environmental impact
statement before restarting the reactors. Costner said in a
telephone interview that the suit will proceed.
   Watkins said he had briefed the National Security Council on the
plan prepared by Westinghouse Savannah River Co., which operates the
reactors under a government contract.
   ``There are still uncertainties'' about getting the reactors
running again on the proposed schedule, Watkins said, so a precise
restart timetable isn't ready. He didn't identify the remaining
problems, but Westinghouse has said it is undertaking a wide-ranging
program of safety improvements.
   J.L. Gallagher, the Westinghouse manager in charge of the restart
effort, told an Energy Department advisory group Wednesday the
company was committed to safe operations with a ``balanced,
experienced mixture of people'' on the job.
   Westinghouse took over management of the site in April from E.I.
du Pont de Nemours &amp; Co., which had run the plant since it was built
in the early 1950s.
   Watkins has faced some congressional pressure to further study
the environmental implications of restarting the Savannah River
reactors, but he also is under pressure from the Pentagon to resume
production of tritium before existing stockpiles run so low that
weapons systems must be cannibalized.
   Tritium decays at a rate of 5.5 percent annually and thus must be
regularly replenished to keep the U.S. nuclear arsenal in a state of
full readiness.
   Watkins' restart target of roughly September 1990 is a delay of
more than two years from an August 1988 incident at one of the
Savannah River reactors that triggered a shutdown of the whole
complex while safety and management issues were reviewed. The
shutdown initially was expected to last only a matters of weeks, but
restart was continually set back as more problems were discovered.
   The K reactor that Watkins said would be restarted first has been
idle since April 1988. The reactor suffered ruptured valves in its
backup cooling system last January when operators mishandled a
routine pressure test. The incident raised new questions about
operating procedures at the plant and led to additional demands on
Westinghouse to improve training of reactor operators and other
workers.
   Westinghouse recently confirmed that it had proposed to Watkins
that the K reactor be restarted in September 1990 but that the
energy secretary had pressed for an earlier date.
   Meanwhile, the Energy Department said Thursday it will put one of
the two plants producing uranium fuel for naval reactors on standby
because less fuel is needed these days. The plant is at the Savannah
River site, where some 600 affected employees will be absorbed into
other projects.
   The only other plant producing fuel for reactors that drive
nuclear powered warships is operated by Nuclear Fuel Services Inc.
at Erwin, Tenn. The department said the Erwin plant can supply the
Navy's entire needs.

   Country music star Willie Nelson has
bought more than 4,000 old TV shows and hopes to air them on a new
cable network next year.
   Nelson said Wednesday he purchased the programs from Norman
Lear's Act III Entertainment and plans to broadcast them on The
Cowboy Network, which he hopes to start. The shows include old
programs by country stars such as Dolly Parton, Marty Robbins and
Porter Wagoner.
   ``I feel that the Cowboy Television Network which we will launch
next year will provide an excellent vehicle to permit other fans to
enjoy the performance of these artists again,'' Nelson said.
   Nelson said WZTV in Nashville, an independent station, would be a
base of operations, but he divulged no other details about the
planned network and the purchase price of the shows. The Tennessean
newspaper quoted anonymous sources as valuing the programs at more
than $1 million.

   Julian Lennon says he's just like his late
father, short-tempered and cynical.
   ``I have the same wit, the same sense of humor,'' Lennon said in
the Sept. 8-10 issue of USA Weekend.
   ``And I'm very aggressive and opinionated; I have very strong
beliefs, as he did,'' Lennon said of his father, John Lennon, who
left Julian's mother to marry Yoko Ono.
   Lennon, who has followed in his father's footsteps as a musician,
said he tries not to think about his father being assassinated in
1980.
   ``You have to face facts and get on with your life. And I don't
think about it much these days. I really don't. Only because it
hurts to. But I get a constant reminder from the public,'' Lennon
said.

   Country music singer Randy Travis and his
band could be expelled from the musicians union and fined up to
$10,000 for crossing a picket line at a Las Vegas hotel.
   ``Randy chose to make his fans happy as opposed to making the
union happy,'' said Evelyn Shriver, a spokeswoman for Travis. ``He
had to disappoint someone and he believes that his success is due to
the support he's received from his fans.''
   Travis performed last weekend at the Bally hotel despite a
summerlong strike against four hotels, including Bally's, which
replaced live musicians with taped accompaniment.
   Mark Tully Massagli, president of the Las Vegas local of the
American Federal of Musicians, said Wednesday: ``Because of the
gravity of the situation, we would request the strongest penalties
possible.''
   A ruling by the union's executive board will take four to six
months, union officials said.
   Dean Martin, Rodney Dangerfield, Connie Francis, Burt Bacharach,
Dionne Warwick and Bill Medley all refused to cross the picket
lines. Pop vocalist Engelbert Humperdinck and magician David
Copperfield did cross the picket lines to perform.

   Actor Johnny Depp was given an
absolute discharge after pleading guilty in a Vancouver court to an
assault charge.
   The 25-year-old star of the Fox television series ``21 Jump
Street'' was charged last March after a confrontation with a
security guard following a hotel party. Depp's lawyer, Richard
Israels, told provincial court his client regrets the incident.
   Depp, who plays an undercover officer on the TV show, knows he
didn't live up to the responsibility of being an American allowed to
work in Canada, said Israels. The lawyer said Depp overreacted
during a discussion with the guard.
   Both the defense and prosecution asked the judge on Thursday to
grant a discharge, which means Depp will have no record of a
conviction.

   A Manhattan delicatessen gave away hundreds of
salamis to pay off on a promise that anyone showing up with a ticket
stub from a New York Mets game won by pitcher Frank Viola would get
one.
   ``Hopefully, we didn't get in over our heads,'' said Steve Cohen,
manager of the Second Avenue Deli as he watched 500 salamis given
away Thursday after the Mets beat the St. Louis Cardinals, 13-1.
   Abe Lebewohl, the deli's owner, had promised a free, 1-pound
salami to anyone producing a ticket stub from a New York Mets game
won by Viola, who grew up on Long Island and whose father had eaten
at the deli.
   The giveway continues each time Viola wins a game the rest of the
season.
   Viola lost his first three decisions after the offer was made in
early August. On Monday, he shut out the Dodgers in Los Angeles. One
Manhattan man who sent away for a ticket to the game but did not
attend showed up Tuesday morning and was given two of the $7 salamis
for being first.
   Cohen said the salami giveaway offer was made because Viola is a
``hometown boy.''

   Rep. Glenn English, D-Okla., says rural
development legislation being crafted by his subcommittee will
reflect individual local needs expressed at hearings in four states
during the congressional recess.
   English, chairman of the House Agriculture subcommittee on
conservation, credit and rural development, has been gathering
information for months on how best to pull rural communities out of
economic depression and stop population losses.
   ``The new thoughts and contributions we received sensitized us to
regional concerns,'' English said Thursday. ``We will try to make
sure that these are reflected in the bill we formulate.''
   Hearings were held last month in Clarksdale, Miss.; Amarillo,
Texas; Marshalltown, Iowa; and Blackfoot, Idaho. English will go on
the road again Monday when he hears testimony in Le Roy, N.Y., and
Sept. 18 in Montgomery, W.Va.
   English said he hoped to have a bill written next month.
   The Senate already has passed a rural development bill, but
English's office said the House version may not be ready for a full
vote until next year, and may even be incorporated into the 1990
farm bill.
   The Senate measure would create a revolving loan fund for
investments in rural enterprises, establish an insurance fund for
lenders and investors, provide additional funding for sewer and
water projects and improve telecommunications links for rural
hospitals.
   Rep. Lee Hamilton, D-Ind., issued a recent report to constituents
in his largely rural district emphasizing the need for local
leadership to make any new programs work.
   ``I have come to the view that legislation at the federal level
will at best have only a marginal impact on rural development,''
Hamilton said.
   ``Assistance from the federal government is not the key to
economic growth. The initiative for change must come from local
communities where many tactics can be effective.''

<HEAD>Bill is `Emancipation Proclamation' for the Disabled</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT GREENE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Disabled Americans, including most AIDS
victims, would get new legal protections in jobs and public places
under a Senate-passed ``emancipation proclamation for the disabled''
heading to the House.
   The measure, passed 76-8 Thursday night, is being billed as the
logical extension of the landmark Civil Rights Act of 1964 that gave
similar rights to blacks and other minorities.
   ``In a sense, this legislation is an emancipation proclamation
for the disabled, and America will be a better, fairer and stronger
nation because of it,'' said Sen. Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass., whose
Committee on Labor and Human Resources cleared the bill last month.
   The measure prevents employment discrimination against the
handicapped, requires equal access to public accommodations such as
stores, restaurants and transportation, and requires special
telephone service for the hearing- and speech-impaired at no greater
cost than regular service.
   Sponsored by Sen. Tom Harkin, D-Iowa, the bill had 59 Senate
co-sponsors and was widely supported by advocacy groups, with a
qualified endorsement from the White House.
   In a historic gesture to the bill's beneficiaries, the Senate
waived its usual strict access rules and allowed sign-language
interpreters on the floor during the debate.
   ``The Americans with Disabilities Act is a landmark statement of
basic human rights that will make the promise of equal opportunity a
reality for 43 million Americans with disabilities,'' said Harkin,
who has a deaf brother and quadriplegic nephew.
   Businesses with 15 or more employees would be covered, but for
the first two years of the law only businesses with 25 or more
employees would be affected.
   Violations of employment discrimination rules would be sanctioned
by injunctions, back pay and attorneys' fees. Violations of the
public accommodations sections would be punishable by a fine of up
to $50,000 for the first violation and $100,000 for the second.
   But Sen. David Pryor, D-Ark., echoing criticism voiced by the
small business lobby and the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, said he was
concerned with the ``extremely loose'' definition of handicapped as
well as the harshness of the sanctions.
   ``We're not talking about a bus, or a train or a plane _ we're
talking about a shoe store, we're talking about a grocery store,''
Pryor said.
   ``I'm concerned about what I think may put some people out of
business,'' said Sen. Dale Bumpers, D-Ark., who nonetheless voted
for the bill.
   Sen. Jesse Helms, R-N.C., took issue with the coverage of people
suffering from AIDS or infected with the AIDS virus, asserting that
85 percent of those people are homosexuals or drug users.
   ``This bill responds to those 15 percent who are not,'' said
Harkin, who also quoted the Health and Human Services Secretary, Dr.
Louis Sullivan, as saying there is no medical reason for
discrimination against AIDS sufferers.
   The bill would prohibit discrimination against people suffering
from acquired immune deficiency syndrome or those who carry the HIV
virus that causes AIDS, so long as they are not in the advanced,
highly contagious stage of the disease.
   Rep. Steny Hoyer, D-Md., the House sponsor, said all four
committees with jurisdiction over the House version plan to hold
hearings this month: Judiciary, Energy and Commerce, Public
Utilities and Transportation, and Education and Labor. The bill has
226 House sponsors.
   Voting against the measure were Helms, William Armstrong,
R-Colo.; Gordon Humphrey, R-N.H.; James A. McClure, R-Idaho; and
Malcolm Wallop, R-Wyo.; Christopher Bond, R-Mo.; Steve Symms,
R-Idaho; and Jake Garn, R-Utah.
   Not voting were Brock Adams, D-Wash., Max Baucus, D-Mont.; Lloyd
Bentsen, D-Texas; John Breaux, D-La.; Conrad Burns, R-Mont.; John
Glenn, D-Ohio; Daniel Inouye, D-Hawaii; Trent Lott, R-Miss.; Howard
Metzenbaum, D-Ohio; Barbara Mikulski, D-Md.; Frank Murkowski,

   Dissident Roman Catholic priest the Rev. George
A. Stallings, accused of having sex with an altar boy 12 years ago,
is refusing to say whether he has ever had sexual relations with
young males.
   Stallings, appearing on a talk show Thursday on WJLA television,
declined to answer questions about whether he ever had sex with boys.
   The Washington Post has reported that a former altar boy swore in
a signed statement that he had sexual relations 12 years ago with
Stallings, who was suspended by the church this summer for starting
an unsanctioned African-American congregation.
   Asked Thursday whether he had ever had sexual relations with
young males, Stallings said: ``My answer (is) to those people whom I
served, those persons who are touched by my ministry. I say to them,
`I am the same pastor today as I was 12 years ago ... when I first
ministered to you. I have not changed. You know that my credentials
are impeccable and that my morals are beyond reproach.'''
   Asked the same question again, Stallings said: ``It's not a
question of answering yes or no. For me to give any type of response
... would mean first and foremost that I would allow a single issue
_ whether it would be my life ... whether I wear my hair long or
short _ to become the driving concern, rather than the central issue
or focus that there is racism in the Catholic Church.''
   According to the Post story published Monday, a former altar boy,
now 28, said that when he was 16 he repeatedly had sex with
Stallings in the rectory of St. Teresa of Avila Catholic Church
during a three- to four-month period in 1977. The man was not
identified in the article.
   The story also said Washington Cardinal James A. Hickey had
confronted Stallings with allegations of more recent sexual
misconduct and asked him to seek treatment in a New Mexico church
facility that treats pedophilia and other emotional disorders.
Stallings, however, said Thursday that Hickey ``never brought forth
any sexual charges.''
   Stallings has labeled the article ``scurrilous'' and ``baseless''
and called it an attempt to divert attention from his mission of
establishing a congregation attentive to the needs of blacks.

   U.S. airlines generally improved in on-time
performance in the latest government consumer report, but the
Transportation Department is receiving more complaints about service.
   Strike-bound Eastern Airlines continued to receive the largest
share of complaints in relation to passenger load but was among the
best for on-time performance with its limited number of flights,
according to the latest monthly report released Thursday.
   Complaints against Eastern totaled 36.24 for every 100,000
passengers. The next highest share of complaints was against Pan
American, 7.54 per 100,000.
   Eastern also led airlines in the number of complaints of lost or
mishandled baggage, with 12.52 for every 1,000 passengers. But the
airline's on-time record was 86 percent, exceeded only by America
West with 89.4 percent.
   The 13 largest domestic carriers reported 76.9 percent of their
flights operated on time in July, compared with 72.2 percent in
June. Delays due to mechanical problems are not counted.
   In the complaints category, which covers August, the department
said it received 1,244 for all airlines, compared with 1,119 in
July. That was an 11 percent increase, but still was 47 percent
below the 2,367 for August 1988.
   The department keeps track of flight data each month and
maintains records on various airlines and airports.

   They called it the saddest day in
Manchester's history _ the late summer day 20 years ago when five of
the city's sons, killed by the same land mine in Vietnam as they
prepared to head home, returned in flag-draped coffins.
   A few days later, the rest of their National Guard unit arrived
home to a different, but equally emotional welcome.
   ``We cried at both,'' said former guardsman Roland Provencher of
Manchester, whose best friend was one of the five guardsmen killed
Aug. 26, 1969. ``It was a very sad and a very happy time.''
   New Hampshire's 3rd Battalion, 197th Artillery, went to Vietnam
in 1968, becoming one of the first of a handful of National Guard
units to go. Some of its nearly 600 soldiers will meet in Portsmouth
Sept. 15-17 to mark the 20th anniversary of their service.
   The unit's artillery batteries were in the thick of combat,
sometimes being dropped by helicopter into bombed-out jungle
clearings to support ground troops. Until just before they came home
20 years ago this week, only two had been killed.
   But the deaths of the five Manchester guardsmen, killed by a land
mine as they rode in the back of a truck after surviving a year in
Vietnam, shocked the city and state, and brought home the meaning of
war.
   Yvonne Lussier remembered sitting on the porch when a military
official came up to tell her that her only child, Richard Raymond,
had been killed.
   ``I said, `Was he hurt?' and he said, `It's much more than that.
He is gone,''' she recalled this week.
   Two thousand people jammed Manchester's small airport when the
bodies arrived on Aug. 30.
   ``There were those five caskets,'' said Mrs. Lussier. ``Everyone
was crying. It was too sad to think about.''
   The sound of drums helped provoke such grief that the drummer
stopped playing.
   Then-Mayor John Mongan called it ``the saddest day for Manchester
that I can remember.''
   Killed were Raymond, 27; Roger Robichaud, 24; Richard Genest, 24;
Guy Blanchette, 22; and Gaetan Beaudoin, 20. Several were from the
same block on Manchester's Franco-American West Side.
   The men were buried Sept. 1 and 2 in the same cemetery. Their
funerals illustrated the country's division over the war.
   Genest's young widow, Brenda, refused to accept the flag that
covered her husband's coffin. His non-military funeral featured folk
songs that asked haunting questions:
   ``Where have all the soldiers gone? Gone to graveyards, every one.
   ``When will they ever learn? When will they ever learn?''
   The deaths brought home ``the futility of the war,'' Mongan said
slowly, emotionally. ``At that Mass, I could understand.''
   Military honors marked the other funerals.
   In contrast to Mrs. Genest's anti-war message, Blanchette's
widow, Lise, forbade the use of her husband's name in an anti-war
demonstration.
   Mrs. Lussier honored her lost son by becoming active in veterans'
groups.
   ``It burns me up that everyone has forgotten them,'' she said.
   But Provencher said not everyone has forgotten. ``I think of the
boys almost daily.''
   Provencher recalled this week that as they left Manchester on a
bus to go to war, he and Genest watched crews tearing down the old
Amoskeag Bridge and building a new one.
   ``I told him, `Some of us are not going to come back and they are
going to name this bridge after us,''' Provencher said. Several
years later, the bridge was dedicated to those from Manchester who
died in Vietnam.
   Two days after the last funerals, the rest of the 197th flew into
Pease Air Force Base in Newington.
   Former guardsman John Barvenik recalled that ropes encircled the
spectator area as the troops came off the planes. Then, ``one young
girl spotted her father, and she hollered out `Daddy' and broke
through the ropes,'' Barvenik said. Others followed and the troops
broke ranks.
   Mrs. Lussier plans to carry snapshots her son sent from Vietnam
to the reunion so she can search for the tanned, smiling young men
in fatigues that she knows only as images from the past.
   ``I want to meet them,'' she said. ``I want to match up some
faces.''

   California lawmakers were deep in an
ethics discussion Thursday when somebody smelled a rat.
   Actually, everyone saw the rat when it stuck its brown nose over
the edge of a decorative Corinthian column on the wall of the
Assembly balcony Thursday.
   Bedlam ensued and little attention was paid to the serious debate
on details of a proposed constitutional amendment that would enact a
series of ethics standards for legislators.
   ``You'd think nobody around here'd ever seen a rat,'' said the
presiding officer, Assemblyman Mike Roos.
   The Capitol, built in the 1860s and renovated a decade ago, has
suffered cricket and mouse infestations. But this was a different
matter.
   ``Where's the assault rifle?'' joked Assemblyman Trice Harvey.
The Legislature last spring passed a law restricting sales of many
assault-style semiautomatic guns.
   Speaker Willie Brown went up to the balcony and peered at the
column.
   But the rat, perhaps having its fill of ethics debate, did not
reappear.

   Toto, you're invited to the eighth annual
Wizard of Oz Festival in Chesterton.
   The festival's executive director, Ross Amundson, has invited all
200 residents of the town of Toto to the Sept. 15-17 festival, which
will honor the 50th anniversary of the MGM film classic.
   ``Actually, the author of `The Wizard of Oz,' L. Frank Baum,
summered at Bass Lake,'' Amundson said. ``He did some of his writing
there. He probably came up with the name of Toto from that.''
   Bass Lake is about 5 miles from Toto. Chesterton is about 30
miles further away and near Lake Michigan.
   For those who've been somewhere over the rainbow the past half
century and don't know, Toto is Dorothy's dog in Baum's book and in
the 1939 Judy Garland movie.
   Amundson addressed the festival invitation to ``the Honorable
Mayor and the Grand People of Toto,'' even though Toto has no mayor.
The invitation was mailed to Toto resident Rose Wineberg, whose
brother Joe owns Joey's Wallpaper Inc.
   ``Well, Toto is just a little wide spot in the road,'' said a
woman in Toto who answered the phone at Joey's Wallpaper and who
said her first name was Dorothy.
   Amundson expects up to 30,000 people to attend the festival. He
has no idea how many to expect from Toto.
   Ten of the 116 people who played munchkins in the movie will
attend the festival. Among them will be munchkin soldier Lewis Croft
and Ralph Ayres, the honorary mayor of Munchkin Land.
   ``We've been able to finance this thing through a
sponsor-a-munchkin program we sold to five businesses here,''
Amundson said. ``McDonalds, Wendy's, Burger King, Costas Foods and
Lewis Dairy Queen each put up $500 to sponsor a munchkin. The
munchkins will be at their stores a couple of hours during the
festival.''

   Israeli Defense Minister Yitzhak Rabin is
meeting today with senior Bush administration officials on the
stalled Mideast peace process and Palestinian unrest on the West
Bank and in Gaza.
   Rabin's talks with Defense Secretary Dick Cheney, National
Security Adviser Brent Scowcroft and Secretary of State James A.
Baker III kick off a series of visits by Israeli officials.
   He will be followed by Deputy Foreign Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu, Finance Minister Shimon Peres and, in November, Prime
Minister Yitzhak Shamir. Later this month, Foreign Minister Moshe
Arens will attend the U.N. General Assembly session in New York City.
   The administration backs a Shamir proposal to hold elections
among Palestinians on the West Bank and the territories, but has
been unable to sell the plan to the Palestine Liberation
Organization.
   Rabin is likely to discuss with Baker a 10-point program by
Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak to bridge differences between
Israel and the PLO on conducting the elections.
   State Department spokeswoman Margaret Tutwiler said Thursday that
no date had been set for the next U.S.-PLO meeting in Tunisia.

   From year to year, U.S. foreign policy has a
sameness that dulls the senses _ except when a crisis looms. But two
events this week demonstrate that external events can provoke major
shifts in direction.
   The reopening of conventional arms negotiations in Vienna with a
powerful drive by the Bush administration to reduce troops and
armories across Europe shows how far the United States has gone in
less than a decade from disinterest to zeal.
   The 1980s began with Ronald Reagan, on a successful drive for
election, denouncing existing arms control agreements with the
Soviet Union and stirring distrust of Moscow as an unreliable and
evil negotiating partner.
   In the Middle East, on the other hand, the United States was
busily trying to expand on the historic 1979 Egyptian-Israeli peace
treaty with other settlements in the region.
   By 1983, largely through U.S. influence, Israel and a second Arab
neighbor, Lebanon, were on the verge of a de facto peace treaty. The
accord promised to normalize relations between the two neighboring
states.
   But Syria, determined to exert influence over Lebanon, torpedoed
the pact. U.S. influence went into decline, reaching a low point
this week with the evacuation of the U.S. embassy in Beirut.
   With the country near anarchy, Ambassador John McCarthy and his
staff departed for home. It was the first time in 15 years of civil
war between Christians and Moslems that the U.S. ambassador was
withdrawn.
   In both areas, arms control and the Middle East, the dramatic
shifts in U.S. foreign policy were partly due to decisions in
Washington and to the influence of others.
   Whether President Reagan would have changed his mind about the
Soviet Union and about harnessing the arms race had Mikhail
Gorbachev not come to power in 1985 is a question that will keep
historians busy for years.
   The likelihood is that Reagan was both swayed toward arms control
by an instinctive humanity and also hurried along by Gorbachev's
flurry of proposals and the positive impact they were having on the
West Europeans.
   President Bush is following in Reagan's path, while placing a
special emphasis on tanks, artillery and other non-nuclear weapons.
He has adopted Reagan's stress on strict verification procedures to
guard against cheating, and with an optimism that matches his
predecessor's, set next spring as his target for a 23-nation treaty.
   The fact that 15 years of East-West negotiations failed to
produce a much more modest accord to scale down weapons in central
Europe underscores the enormity of Bush's goal.
   It could spill over into a broader accommodation with the Soviet
Union when he has his first summit meeting with Gorbachev.
   Secretary of State James A. Baker III and Soviet Foreign Minister
Eduard A. Shevardnadze will map plans for the session when they meet
in Wyoming in two weeks.
   On some other foreign policy fronts the picture hasn't changed
much. American presidents come and go, and so do secretaries of
state and national security advisers. And yet, the United States
seems unable to have a lasting impact on hunger and disease in the
Third World or to thin the ranks of dictatorship and add to the list
of democracies.
   Despite White House hoopla, there is even a sameness about Bush's
war on drugs from Colombia. That foreign policy objective is likely
to fail without a vast change in other circumstances, chief among
them the fact that the United States creates a market for cocaine by
being the world's largest consumer.

   Given the drug-related violence wracking
Colombia, can the United States take adequate security precautions
to keep extradited drug kingpins in jail?
   The Marshals Service and the Bureau of Prisons say they can.
   They contend the handling of convicted Medellin drug cartel
leader Carlos Lehder Rivas proves their ability to keep
high-visibility drug traffickers in prison.
   This week, the Colombian government extradited Eduardo Martinez
Romero, wanted on money-laundering and drug-trafficking charges
leveled in March in Atlanta. Martinez, who arrived in Atlanta early
Thursday, is the first person brought to the United States under a
newly reinstituted extradition agreement.
   Attorney General Dick Thornburgh says the country must face up to
the task of providing security in drug-trafficking cases, despite
the possibility of attacks.
   ``We can't succumb in this country to what has already brought
the criminal justice system to its knees in Colombia,'' Thornburgh
said when he recently announced the list of the top 12 alleged drug
traffickers the United States wants to bring here to stand trial,
including the leaders of the notorious Medellin and Cali cartels.
   The Marshals Service handled the security for the transport and
trial of Lehder, who was extradited in 1987 and convicted July 20,
1988, in Jacksonville, Fla. He is in federal prison in Marion, Ill.,
serving a life sentence without parole plus 140 years.
   Although the Colombian Supreme Court revoked the extradition
agreement two years ago, President Virgilio Barco reinstituted it
under emergency measures after the Aug. 18 assassination of leading
presidential candidate Luis Carlos Galan, an outspoken foe of the
drug trade.
   The Justice Department attempted to prevent any information about
the Martinez extradition from getting out, even after the news was
broadcast in Colombia.
   Department spokesman David Runkel said Thursday that ``concern
about security'' prompted the clampdown on information even after
the DEA confirmed that Martinez was in the air, heading toward the
United States.
   Bill Dempsey, spokesman for the Marshals Service, which takes
custody of people extradited to the United States, said that if any
of the top 12 are extradited, ``Every effort would be made to
provide all the necessary security and the resources would be
obtained to provide the security for the extradition of the
individuals.''
   Dempsey said he was unsure how much it cost to provide security
for Lehder, who was convicted on charges of conspiracy to import
cocaine, importation of cocaine, possession with intention to
distribute cocaine and operating a continuing criminal enterprise.
He arrived at prison Aug. 5, 1988.
   Randy Davis, a spokesman for the Marion penitentiary, said
Lehder's ties to the Medellin cartel have not prompted any
additional security measures by the prison's 215 corrections
officers.
   ``This being the most maximum-security penitentiary in the
federal prison system, it doesn't require us to add any additional
security here,'' he said. ``It was always present. That was the
reason for his designation to this facility.''
   Lehder doesn't present a remarkably greater threat to security
than the other 435 or so prisoners at Marion, he said.
   ``We have a lot of high-profile, high-publicity inmates with a
lot of money, doing a great deal of time,'' Davis said.
   Lehder, like all the other inmates there, has a cell to himself,
and he prefers to remain alone even when he gets out of the cell for
one hour of recreation per day, Davis said. Only about 20 inmates
are allowed in the recreation yard at a time, he said.
   Davis said he couldn't disclose who was on Lehder's visiting list
and said he didn't know if Lehder had had any visitors, but he added
that any visitors would have to be checked out to ensure that there
are no security problems.
   ``It wouldn't be very smart for them to come here if they're part
of the Medellin cartel,'' Davis said.
   He noted that all visits, except for those with attorneys, are
non-contact meetings.

<HEAD>Flight 232 Crew Meets With Bush, Vows to Return to Flying</HEAD>

   The pilot and co-pilots of United Flight 232,
hailed as heroes by President Bush for guiding their plane to a
crash-landing that most on board survived, say they want to resume
flying DC-10s.
   ``The only thing that upsets me is I have to wait to get well to
do it,'' said Dennis Fitch, a pilot trainer who joined the crew from
the passenger compartment and helped land the plane July 19 at the
Sioux City, Iowa, airport.
   Pilot Albert Haynes, Fitch, the two co-pilots, flight attendants
and air traffic controllers involved with the flight met Thursday
with Bush after the cockpit crew held their first joint news
conference.
   The crash killed 112 people, including one who died from injuries
a month later; 184 passengers and crew members survived after the
DC-10 cartwheeled and burst into flames during an emergency landing
on a flight from Denver to Chicago.
   The landing followed an explosive engine failure that
investigators say cut hydraulic systems that control flight. The
pilots said they were left with the thrust from two engines to steer
and level off the plane, which Haynes said began descending and
turning to the right after the engine failed.
   ``I know Al (Haynes) would disclaim all credit, but certainly he
deserves an awful lot,'' Bush said. ``And there's the controllers,
and there's the ground crew, and there's the cabin crew and then
there's a lot of plain people that just were watching with wonder
and great pride.''
   Three of the 16-member group still bore outward evidence of their
injuries: a man on crutches, another with his hand in a large cast,
and a woman in a wheelchair with a bandaged hand.
   Haynes, Fitch and co-pilots William Records and Dudley Dvorak
said at the news conference that they plan to fly when they have
fully recovered. None expressed qualms about the DC-10 and said they
believe investigators will determine the cause of the crash.
   ``I'm looking forward to flying the DC-10 as soon as possible,''
Records said.
   Federal Aviation Administrator James B. Busey said last month
that there was no evidence to warrant grounding DC-10s, despite the
Iowa crash and an Aug. 10 emergency landing by a Northwest Airlines
DC-10 in Denver. The Northwest plane made a safe landing with holes
blasted in the housing of its tail-mounted engine.
   All DC-10s were grounded for a month in 1979 after an American
Airlines plane crashed after taking off from Chicago, killing 273
people.
   Busey did form a task force after the Iowa crash to examine
possible changes in the design of wide-body planes.
   Haynes said the thought of dying never entered his mind as he and
other crew members tried to land the plane by applying power
selectively to its two remaining engines.
   ``My life did not flash before me,'' he said.
   He said pictures of the plane coming in for a landing are
deceiving.
   ``It looks like we're flying a standard instrument approach and
we weren't,'' he said. ``The airplane was ... still wanting to roll
on us. It was a constant battle all the way down.''

   With the arrival of the first alleged drug
trafficker extradited from Colombia in two years, U.S. attorneys are
working on extradition requests for the dozen most wanted, the
Justice Department says.
   Eduardo Martinez Romero, an alleged member of the Medellin
cocaine cartel who arrived early Thursday in Atlanta, was not on the
list of the top 12 drug traffickers issued by Attorney General Dick
Thornburgh.
   The list was issued shortly after Colombian President Virgilio
Barco imposed emergency regulations allowing the resumption of
extraditions that were stopped in 1987 by the Colombian Supreme
Court. By the time the list came out, Martinez was in custody.
   Justice Department spokesman David Runkel said Thursday that U.S.
attorneys around the country were still preparing the extradition
requests for the 12, none of whom has been arrested.
   Named on the list are six members of the Medellin cartel, which
authorities believe was among the first to organize a corporate-like
structure, and six of the Cali cartel.
   The Justice Department has released the following information on
the 12 fugitives:
   _Pablo Emilio Escobar-Gaviria, 39, Medellin cartel. A former
alternate senator from Medellin, he faces a 1986 indictment in
Colombia for the murder of a newspaper owner.
   The Justice Department says he traffics in cocaine, marijuana,
and possibly heroin and has been indicted five times in the United
States on drug-trafficking, conspiracy, racketeering and obstruction
of justice charges. He is named in indictments in Florida, Louisiana
and Colorado.
   _Gustavo de Jesus Gaviria-Rivero, 42, Medellin cartel. Gaviria
allegedly deals in cocaine and marijuana and was arrested in the
Bahamas in 1981 on charges of transporting marijuana. He was
indicted in Florida last year on drug and conspiracy charges.
   _Jose Gonzalo Rodriguez-Gacha, 42, Medellin cartel. He allegedly
traffics in cocaine and marijuana and reputedly heads an
international cocaine production and distribution organization based
in Bogota that is believed responsible for sending hundreds of
kilograms of cocaine to the United States each week.
   He faces drug-trafficking, conspiracy and racketeering charges in
six separate indictments in Florida and New York.
   _Jorge Luis Ochoa-Vasquez, thought to be 40, Medellin cartel. He
allegedly has been involved with cocaine and marijuana trafficking
for more than a decade, taking over and modernizing the
drug-smuggling business started by his father, Fabio Ochoa Restrepo.
   Ochoa-Vasquez has been arrested at least twice, once in Madrid,
but served little time in Colombia. He faces drug-trafficking,
conspiracy and racketeering charges in indictments returned in
Florida and Georgia.
   _Juan David Ochoa-Vasquez, 41, Jorge's brother, Medellin cartel.
He allegedly is involved in the financial end of his family's
business and in smuggling cocaine to the United States. He was
indicted in Florida on drug-trafficking, conspiracy and racketeering
charges.
   _Fabio Ochoa-Vasquez, 32, known as Fabito, the youngest of the
Ochoa brothers, Medellin cartel. He reportedly took control when
Jorge was imprisoned in Spain in 1984 and allegedly traffics in
cocaine.
   Indicted in both Louisiana and Florida, he faces
drug-trafficking, conspiracy and racketeering charges and a charge
of causing interstate travel for the commission of a murder for hire.
   _Jose Santacruz-Londono, 45, Cali cartel. The Justice Department
believes Santacruz has operated a cocaine trafficking network since
1975, primarily in New York, Miami, Los Angeles, San Francisco,
Houston, Las Vegas and Chicago.
   Santacruz has been indicted in Florida and New York, which
originally indicted him under the pseudonym of Victor Crespo, on
charges of importation and distribution of cocaine, conspiracy and
involvement with a continuing criminal enterprise.
   _Gilberto Rodriguez-Orejuela, 50, Cali cartel. The department
says he is believed to oversee the logistics of the organization's
cocaine-smuggling and money-laundering operations. He has been
indicted in New York and Louisiana on drug-trafficking, conspiracy
and criminal enterprise charges.
   _Miguel Angel Rodriguez-Orejuela, 45, Cali cartel. The Justice
Department contends Miguel Rodriguez has been involved in cocaine
and marijuana drug trafficking since 1980 while operating legitimate
banks, real estate and construction companies in Colombia. He was
indicted in Louisiana on drug-trafficking and conspiracy charges.
   _Jaime Raul Orjuela-Caballero, 46, Cali cartel. The department
believes he controls the cartel's cocaine distribution to the United
States, primarily in the New York area. He was indicted in New York
on drug-trafficking and continuing criminal enterprise charges.
   _Jose Ivan Duarte-Acero, 37, Cali cartel. A former Colombian
National Police lieutenant dismissed from the force because of
corruption charges, he is wanted in the United States for the
alleged kidnapping and attempted murder of two Drug Enforcement
Administration agents in February 1982 in Cartegena, Colombia. The
indictment was returned that year in Florida.
   _Gerardo Moncado, about 23, Cali cartel. Moncado allegedly
collects money for the cartel. He was indicted this year in Georgia
on conspiracy charges.

<HEAD>Democrats Rekindling Child-Care Turf Battle</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   House Democrats are rekindling a turf battle
over who will control a massive expansion of federal subsidies to
help parents pay for child care.
   On a voice vote Thursday, the House Ways and Means Committee
rejected a competing version written by the Education and Labor
Committee that would have established a new program of direct
subsidies for child care.
   Instead, the tax law writers on the Ways and Means panel want to
provide the bulk of the new aid indirectly by increasing existing
tax credits for low-income families with children.
   Their measure also would increase direct subsidies by $200
million a year in 1990 and 1991 and by $400 million thereafter, but
through an expansion of an existing entitlements program for the
poor.
   By using existing entitlements rather than establishing a new
program, proponents say they will be able to protect child care from
future budget cuts.
   But it also would give the 37 members of the Ways and Means
Committee and its chairman, Rep. Dan Rostenkowski, D-Ill., rather
than the 34 members of the Education and Labor panel and its
chairman, Rep. Augustus Hawkins, D-Calif., control over the bulk of
the program.
   With the legislation a key priority for members of both parties,
the chief Democratic sponsors of the competing versions said they
hoped to reach a compromise and avoid a politically damaging fight
on the House floor.
   ``We're not that far apart; we want to avoid Democrats fighting
Democrats,'' said Rep. Thomas J. Downey, D-N.Y., chief author of the
Ways and Means version.
   Because of its reliance primarily on tax cuts for poor families
with children, the Ways and Means version is more agreeable to
Republicans and the Bush administration.
   In June, the Senate approved a shotgun marriage of the two
approaches totaling about $13 billion over the next five years,
including $11 billion in new tax credits for poor families.
   The version expected to emerge from the House _ Speaker Thomas S.
Foley wants a floor vote before the end of September _ will likely
total $16 billion, $14 billion of it in new tax credits.
   Thursday's vote was a virtual repeat of the stand the Ways and
Means panel took in July, when efforts were afoot to include the
measure as part of a bill reconciling how to pay for all government
programs and still reduce the federal deficit.
   However, the committee amended its proposal to begin raising the
existing child care subsidies that the federal government finances
through block entitlement grants to states by $200 million in 1990
rather than in 1991.
   Those entitlements designated for a wide variety of programs to
aid the poor are capped at $2.7 billion a year. No one knows exactly
how much of that is spent on child care, but estimates range from
$400 million to slightly over $1 billion.
   Congressional budgeters already have set aside $200 million for
new child care subsidies in the 1990 fiscal year, which begins Oct.
1. Downey said the amendment was necessary for the Ways and Means
Committee to stake its claim on that money for its version of the
bill.
   Otherwise, he said, it would go to the creation of a new Act for
Better Child Care, or ABC, subsidy program approved by the Senate
and advocated by the House Education and Labor Committee.

   U.S. officials say they're concerned that
disclosure of details on the crack cocaine President Bush displayed
in his television speech could jeopardize the undercover
investigation that produced it.
   The drugs the president held up in Tuesday's anti-drug address
came from an ongoing undercover investigation in which no arrests
have been made, said Cornelius Dougherty, a spokesman for the Drug
Enforcement Administration.
   He said Thursday that the packet of crack is back in the evidence
vault at the DEA's Washington field office to be used as evidence in
court, when and if a prosecution is made.
   Since no arrests have been made, there is some concern that the
seller might ``just decide to leave town,'' given the publicity
surrounding the sale, said White House deputy press secretary Alixe
Glen.
   She declined to give any details on the value or the weight of
the crack Bush displayed, suggesting that such details might further
serve to alert the dealer.
   Dougherty said a ``larger delivery'' of crack from the same
source was expected, and that the narcotics displayed by the
president represented only one installment.
   ``It was a relatively small amount in terms of what we expect to
get,'' Dougherty said. ``We have to be careful what we say'' to keep
from endangering the rest of the investigation.
   Holding up the plastic evidence bag containing several large
white chunks, Bush told his television audience: ``This is crack
cocaine seized a few days ago by Drug Enforcement agents in a park
just across the street from the White House.''
   And, while saying the substance looked ``like candy,'' the
president said: ``It's murdering our children. Let there be no
mistake, this stuff is poison.''
   Then, he concluded his address by holding up the packet a second
time, declaring: ``If we face this evil as a nation united, this
will be nothing but a handful of useless chemicals.''
   DEA officials said the drug came from an undercover buy a few
days before Bush's speech in Lafayette Park, directly across
Pennsylvania Avenue from the White House.
   Dougherty said DEA officials were present at the White House
during Bush's speech to maintain the integrity of the ``chain of
custody'' of the drugs, needed when the case goes to court.
   ``The chain of custody remained unbroken,'' Dougherty said.
   The idea for Bush to use the crack as a prop came from the White
House, said spokeswoman Ms. Glen.
   ``We just called the DEA'' to see if they had any on hand. When
it turned out the agency had drugs recently seized from near the
White House, ``it was a perfect fit,'' Ms. Glen said.

<HEAD>Regional Dispute Over Acid Rain Threatens Clean Air Bill</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LARRY MARGASAK</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A bitter regional dispute over who should pay
to clean up acid rain emissions is threatening a consensus in
Congress on clean air legislation.
   The long-simmering feud resurfaced Thursday at a House hearing
when the panel chairman said nine states with polluting electric
utilities refuse to pay a disproportionate share of the cleanup
costs.
   ``We are talking about economic justice for the country,'' Rep.
Philip R. Sharp, chairman of the Energy and Commerce energy and
power subcommittee, said on behalf of the nine states that want the
whole country to help pay the bill.
   Sharp said the nine states have utilities that burn high-sulfur
coal accounting for 50 percent of the acid rain, but their electric
ratepayers would be required _ under most clean air proposals _ to
bear 67 percent of the cleanup cost.
   Lawmakers from other states countered that their constituents
already are paying for power plant cleanups in their own areas, and
won't pay again to clean up polluting utilities elsewhere.
   The dispute could become more important than ever in the coming
months as lawmakers and President Bush search for a formula that
will break a decade-long deadlock over new clean air legislation.
   ``The other 41 states have cleaned up their act,'' said Rep.
Carlos J. Moorhead, R-Calif., who said utility rates have gone up
because of emissions reduction programs.
   ``The nine states have the cheapest rates,'' Moorhead said,
referring to Ohio, Pennsylvania, Indiana, West Virginia, Illinois,
Kentucky, Missouri, Tennessee and Georgia.
   Bush's clean air proposal is among those using the theory that
``the polluter pays,'' meaning the states burning dirty coal should
pay the cost.
   United Mine Workers of America President Richard L. Trumka
pleaded for cost-sharing. Otherwise, he said, the most affected
utilities would simply switch fuels and leave up to 30,000 miners of
high-sulfur coal out of work, because the demand for their product
would drop.
   Richard E. Ayres, chairman of the National Clean Air Coalition of
environmental, health and labor groups, said, ``With strong
arguments on both sides, there is probably no single right answer.''
He said his organization has backed at least partial cost-sharing by
regions outside the nine states.
   The Edison Electric Institute recently released a report that
said Bush's acid rain proposal would cost ratepayers $5 billion to
$7.1 billion a year over 20 years.
   Most cost-sharing proposals would levy a fee on electric
generation by fossil-fueled plants nationwide, to subsidize
installation of pollution-control equipment. Another possibility:
make refinery and smelting plants help pay for pollution-reduction
measures, since they also produce chemicals that become acid rain.
   The Bush plan calls for a reduction of sulfur dioxide emissions
by 10 million tons by the year 2000, with a reduction of up to 5
million tons in the first phase of the program, through 1995.
   The cleanup burden in the first phase would fall entirely on 107
utilities burning high-sulfur coal in 20 states. But after 1995,
utilities that exceed their cleanup requirements could trade credits
with other utilities and with other industries.
   Sulfur dioxide, and nitrogen oxide _ which has its own reduction
schedule _ are the main components that form an acidic compound in
the atmosphere, and rain destruction on trees and lakes thousands of
miles away. Refineries and smelting plants emit these pollutants
also, although certain coal-burning utilities are the main culprits.

<HEAD>Ultraviolet Rays Destroy Photosynthesis Protein, Scientist Says</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PAUL RECER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Science Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Depletion of ozone in the skies above may lead
to sick and dying plants on the Earth below, according to studies by
a U.S. Department of Agriculture researcher.
   Autar K. Mattoo, leader of the USDA's plant molecular biology lab
in Beltsville, Md., said ultraviolet-b radiation, or UV-B _ the
solar rays that give people tans and skin cancer _ will destroy half
of a plant's store of a critical photosynthesis protein every half
hour.
   The plant is able to restore the protein and continue
photosynthesis when it receives normal levels of UV-B radiation,
Mattoo said, but at higher levels of UV-B the plant would be
stripped of the protein and photosynthesis would stop.
   ``In a few hours time, you would have hardly any of this protein
left in the plant,'' he said Thursday in a telephone interview.
``The plant would wither away and die.''
   Mattoo said that, based on his studies, an increase in UV-B also
could weaken and kill some plants.
   Experiments in Beltsville and Israel showed that UV-B causes a
breakdown of a plant molecule called D1 protein. That protein, he
said, is an essential component in the photochemistry that enables
plants to convert sunlight into chemical energy, a process called
photosynthesis.
   ``The plant does try to replenish the molecules,'' Mattoo said.
``But if you have higher UV-B radiation the plant will not keep up
with the molecules that are being destroyed. That's when we think
there will be an effect on photosynthesis.''
   Such an impact on the normal growth of agricultural crops would
inevitably lead to a smaller harvest and less food, he said.
   UV-B is a normal component of sunlight. Most of the radiation is
filtered out by ozone in the Earth's stratosphere and never reaches
the ground. But recent studies have shown that some types of
pollution are causing the ozone layer to thin in places, creating
what scientists called ``ozone holes.''
   Experts are concerned that a thin ozone layer would allow enough
additional UV-B to reach the Earth's surface to cause a rise in skin
cancers.
   UV-B can damage the skin and that damage is related to
development of cancers.
   Mattoo said he and a colleague, Marvin Edelman of the Weizmann
Institute of Science in Israel, discovered the effect of UV-B on
photosynthesis by studying the level of D1 protein in the duckweed
plant at different light exposures.
   Specimens of the plant, which grows in water, were exposed to
various wavelengths of light, he said. The amount of protein found
in the plants through chemical analysis was then related to the
amount and type of light exposure.
   At a UV-B exposure equivalent to noon sunshine, Mattoo said, the
plant lost half of its D1 protein stores every 30 minutes.
   A report on the research will appear this month in the
Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.

   The Library of Congress today opens this
country's first big exhibition on Alexis de Tocqueville, who
finished his classic ``Democracy in America'' just 150 years ago.
   ``The Anglo-American relies upon personal interest to accomplish
his ends, and gives free scope to the unguided exertions and common
sense of the citizens; the Russian centers all the authority of
society in a single arm,'' Tocqueville wrote.
   ``The principal instrument of the former is freedom; of the
latter servitude. Their starting point is different, and their
courses are not the same; yet each of them seems to be marked out by
the will of Heaven to sway the destinies of half the globe.''
   The exhibit, which will run until Oct. 29, is part of a
French-American commemoration. The year 1789 also was marked by the
proposal of both the U.S. Bill of Rights and French Declaration of
the Rights of Man.
   One of the 250 items on show is a letter from the Marquis de
Lafayette. It asks Thomas Jefferson, then U.S. envoy in Paris, to
look over the marquis' draft of the French declaration.
   Tocqueville made his first trip to this country at age 25, an
unpaid apprentice judge who obtained leave to write a study of the
American prison system.
   ``English was a language not much studied then in France,'' said
Francoise Melanio, co-curator of the exhibit, who is preparing a new
edition of his work.
   ``But he worked hard on the voyage, which took over a month in
1831, and he did without an interpreter when he got here.''
   With his friend Gustave de Beaumont, a state prosecutor, he
roamed for 18 months from Quebec to New Orleans to Memphis to Green
Bay, Wis. They met the leading Americans of the time, including
President Andrew Jackson.
   His book, the first part of which was published in 1835, was an
immediate success. It has long been recognized in this country for
evaluations of the American character and political system.
   ``Man is not made for slavery; that truth is perhaps even better
proved by the master than by the slave,'' he wrote almost 30 years
before Abraham Lincoln's Emancipation Proclamation.
   He did not live to see that, dying in 1859 after a political
career that led him to become minister of foreign affairs. His
political career ended when he was briefly jailed for his opposition
to the coup by Louis Napoleon, who became Napoleon III.
   Ms. Melanio said his preference for decentralized government was
not popular in France _ a proposal for decentralization led to
President Charles de Gaulle's political downfall 20 years ago. Local
government has become more popular under President Francois
Mitterrand, who quoted Tocqueville in his speech last month
celebrating the 200th anniversary of the fall of the Bastille.

<HEAD>Businessman Claims He Supplied Drugs for Barry</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Washington businessman, recently convicted on
drug charges, says he gave cocaine to a friend of Mayor Marion Barry
Jr. for Barry's use while the mayor was present, according to a
report published today.
   The Washington Post reported that George H. Van Wagner III met
with federal prosecutors to discuss the alleged January 1987
incident.
   Van Wagner told federal prosecutors and the Post that he
delivered one-eighth of an ounce of cocaine to the mayor's friend
while Barry and his friend sat in a parked car in downtown
Washington, the newspaper reported.
   Van Wagner met with federal investigators Thursday in Alexandria,
Va., the Post said.
   Van Wagner also reportedly said he handed another eighth of an
ounce of cocaine to either Barry or the mayor's friend at a private
party at a downtown restaurant a week earlier.
   Barry told the Post he had never heard of or met Van Wagner.
Barry, who has not been charged with any criminal wrongdoing, has
repeatedly denied he has ever used drugs.
   ``It seems to be the popular thing to do now, when people want to
make a deal, to lie on the mayor. Once again, a convicted drug
dealer with nothing to lose and everything to gain by lying,'' the
Post quoted Barry as saying.
   Van Wagner, 36, told the newspaper he was cooperating with
federal prosecutors in the hope of getting a lighter sentence.
   The mayor's unidentified friend, an advertising executive, told
the Post that Van Wagner's allegations were ``an absolute
fabrication.'' The friend told the newspaper he briefly met with Van
Wagner twice but never received any drugs from him.
   Van Wagner was convicted Aug. 25 of conspiracy to distribute
cocaine and to launder the proceeds from the transactions. He is
being held in the Alexandria jail and faces a minimum of 10 years in
prison.
   Federal investigators are probing former Barry associate Charles
Lewis' allegations that he smoked crack with Barry at a downtown
hotel and during trips to the Virgin Islands.

<TEXT>
   A California nuclear weapons lab with a history
of drug trafficking problems is the target of at least four
congressional investigations focusing on possible security and
ethics violations, sources say.
   The latest probe, begun two months ago by the House Energy and
Commerce oversight and investigations subcommittee, focuses on the
terms under which the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory
transferred a new computer technology to a company led by former lab
scientists who had helped develop the process.
   Subcommittee Chairman John Dingell, D-Mich., has suggested the
deal violated conflict-of-interest standards, although officials at
the laboratory and the company _ n-Chip Inc. of Livermore, Calif. _
deny any wrongdoing.
   Congressional sources involved in the investigations disclosed
Thursday that lab officials also have come under investigation for
allegedly ``failing to protect important security assets'' at the
site.
   The sources, who spoke on the condition they not be identified,
declined to reveal details of the security lapse but said Energy
Undersecretary John Tuck acknowledged in a closed hearing in July
that the problem posed an unacceptable risk to national security.
Immediate corrective actions were promised, they said.
   Tuck did not return a telephone call seeking comment.
   Plutonium and other sensitive materials are used at Lawrence
Livermore in nuclear weapons design and research activities. The
lab, one of three major weapons design facilities, is operated by
the University of California under an Energy Department contract.
   The Dingell subcommittee also is investigating the national
security implications of an allegation by Roy Woodruff, formerly a
leader of the lab's weapons program.
   Woodruff contends he was blocked by superiors from writing to
national security officials in Washington in 1983-85 to dispute
optimistic projections by physicist Edward Teller about the X-ray
laser weapon being developed there.
   The X-ray laser uses the energy of a nuclear explosion in space
to destroy enemy rocket boosters.
   Separately, the General Accounting Office, the investigative arm
of Congress, is looking into allegations of thefts of government
property at the lab. That investigation was launched last year after
Dingell's panel was told in a public hearing that some lab employees
had sold computers and other government assets for drug money.
   The lab in 1986 launched its own investigation of drug
trafficking by employees after a number of workers became involved
in drug-related incidents and arrests.
   Last month, the lab was embarrassed when small amounts of cocaine
and other drugs were stolen from a locked safe. The narcotics were
being used to train a drug-sniffing dog that had been brought onto
the site to fight a drug problem.
   Dingell stepped up pressure on Energy Secretary James D. Watkins
to review the University of California's management of the lab by
pressing him for information about the circumstances of a licensing
deal the lab made earlier this year with n-Chip.
   The department's internal auditors also are investigating the
licensing deal.
   In a July 7 letter to Watkins, a copy of which was made public
Wednesday, Dingell called the awarding of the license to n-Chip to
commercially develop a technology known as laser pantography
``highly curious.''
   He cited ``the appearance of a conflict of interest'' in granting
an exclusive license to a company whose top officials include at
least three people who helped develop the technology.
   Laser pantography is used for connecting computer chips in a way
that permits supercomputers to be compressed to the size of a
cigarette pack.

<TEXT>
   The lawyer representing U.S. District Judge
Walter Nixon at an impeachment hearing before a Senate panel says a
key witness is unreliable.
   David Stewart said Thursday that Wiley Fairchild had changed his
story about Nixon's intervention in a drug-smuggling case involving
Fairchild's son, but the Hattiesburg, Miss., oil man said the
discrepancies were caused by confusion.
   ``I've always intended to tell the truth,'' Fairchild said. ``I
got confused.''
   The testimony came as a 12-member Senate panel considered the
impeachment case against Nixon, who is serving a five-year prison
sentence for perjury. He continues to draw his $89,500 annual salary.
   ``The real reason I went to Judge Nixon was because Bud Holmes
was not treating my son right,'' Fairchild said about Paul ``Bud''
Holmes, who was prosecuting Drew Fairchild in a marijuana smuggling
case.
   Fairchild said he and Nixon became friends after he sold him
lucrative oil properties.
   Fairchild, 76, said he thought Holmes was trying to blackmail him
by pressing charges against his 50-year-old son in an effort to get
the elder Fairchild to pay more legal fees.
   Fairchild contended it wasn't fair that his son was being
prosecuted while his son's partner in the alleged scheme was not.
   Fairchild admitted to failing and confused memory about his
previous testimony in the long case against Nixon, which began in
1983, but said he would remember ``for as long as I live'' what
Nixon told him on the telephone from Holmes' house.
   ``He said, `Everything is going to be taken care of to your
satisfaction,''' Fairchild said.
   After the call, Fairchild said, the case was ``passed to the
file,'' which meant the prosecutor would be taking no action against
his son.
   The articles of impeachment approved unanimously by the House
allege:
   _Nixon lied when he told a grand jury he never discussed the case
against Drew Fairchild with Holmes.
   _Nixon lied when he told a grand jury he had nothing to do
officially or unofficially with the Fairchild case and never
influenced anyone in the case.
   _Nixon undermined ``the integrity of the judiciary'' and
disobeyed the law by making 14 false or misleading statements during
an interview with federal investigators and in his sworn grand jury
testimony.
   Stewart charged that Fairchild changed his story at a
post-conviction hearing.
   ``He testified that the phone call actually occurred after Drew's
case was passed to the files,'' Stewart said.
   But Fairchild said he ``got confused real bad'' at that hearing
and based his testimony on information given to him by his brother,
not on what he had remembered.
   Stewart argued that Nixon's only involvement was to talk to
Holmes about Fairchild's fears that he was being blackmailed, not to
interfere in the case.
   ``While Judge Nixon visited Bud Holmes at his farm outside of
Hattiesburg, he mentioned Wiley Fairchild's blackmail complaint,''
Stewart said. ``Holmes said that Wiley was crazy and offered to tell
Judge Nixon about Drew's case, but the judge told Holmes that he did
not want to hear about it.''
   Stewart said Holmes called Fairchild and said he intended to
honor a plea bargain with Drew that would keep him out of jail.
   Rep. Don Edwards, D-Calif., said in his opening remarks before
the committee that the evidence would show Nixon had ``little regard
for the truth and cannot be trusted'' to continue as a federal judge.
   The Senate will the vote whether to remove Nixon as a judge.

   A Texas polka band has turned down Tracey Ullman,
but didn't hesitate when Gumby called.
   Brave Combo, a band from Denton that plays a mix of polka-tinged
music, was asked to contribute to Disney's ``The Gumby Project'' and
has sent back two songs.
   Band member Carl Finch said musicians were asked ``to write songs
about the Gumby experience.''
   Brave Combo penned songs called ``Pokey's Polka'' and ``Zydeco

   The Dallas Morning News reported that recording artists paying
tribute to the green rubber TV star will include Frank Sinatra Jr.,
Jonathan Richman, former Turtles Flo and Eddie, and reggae-rockers
Sly and Robbie. The record could be out as early as next month, the
newspaper said.
   Brave Combo members said they quickly turned down an invitation
to appear on ``The Tracey Ullman Show'' after learning they were to
appear in a sketch that parodied polka. Finch told the newspaper the
band's fans don't find polka a joking matter.
   ``They trust us,'' Finche said. ``They still trust that we love
the music.''

<HEAD>Senate Action Moves Elizabeth Morgan Closer to Freedom</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Senate action to limit civil contempt-of-court
jailings in the District of Columbia is expected to free a physician
jailed for two years for refusing to reveal the whereabouts of her
daughter in a custody dispute.
   Thursday's Senate action is the penultimate step in a long march
to freedom for Dr. Elizabeth Morgan, a prominent Washington plastic
surgeon.
   ``This bill is simple, it's clear and it's fair,'' said Sen.
Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, who sponsored the legislation. ``At this time,
there has to be a limit to this thing and a way to resolve this
problem.''
   Rep. Frank Wolf, R.-Va., sponsor of a similar measure approved in
the House in June, said the final step to Morgan's freedom could
come next week with a conference between the House and Senate to
work out differences in the bills.
   Congress has review power over all city laws and court
regulations.
   Morgan was jailed in August 1987 after refusing to disclose the
whereabouts of her 7-year-old daughter, Hilary, saying she feared
the girl's father would sexually abuse her.
   The battle between Morgan and her ex-husband, Dr. Eric Foretich,
has become a national rallying point for women's group and
anti-child abuse organizations.
   ``We're delighted to have the Senate take care of this matter,''
said Alice Monroe, a spokeswoman for the Friends of Elizabeth
Morgan. ``We had such an abusive situation here it demanded some
action.''
   Foretich, who denies sexually abusing his daughter, has been
supported by a host groups backing the rights of fathers in custody
battles.
   His lawyer, Elaine Mittleman, criticized the Senate for refusing
to ``consider the health and safety of Hilary.''
   Both bills are to be applied retroactively to Morgan's case, but
the House bill sets a 12-month cap on civil-contempt jailings and
requires that the person either be freed after that period or be
subjected to criminal-contempt charges, which guarantee a jury trial.
   The Senate measure sets a 12-month cap on child-custody jailings,
but it doesn't apply to all civil-contempt jailings.
   The Senate version, which passed without opposition, includes a
sunset measure that would wipe the legislation off the books in 18
months.
   Wolf has said he didn't intend his legislation to apply only to
Morgan.
   Charlie Lyons, a spokesman for Wolf, said the congressman isn't
likely to object to the sunset amendment even though it means the
law likely will affect only Morgan.
   Mittleman has complained that neither bill guarantees that Hilary
will be returned or that Foretich will be allowed his court-approved
visits.
   D.C. Superior Court Judge Herbert Dixon ordered Morgan jailed
until she produced the child. In May, Dixon rejected a request that
she be freed and his decision was upheld last month by a D.C. Court
of Appeals.
   Neither the House nor the Senate bill prevents Morgan from being
jailed after future court proceedings.

   The dollar fell slightly against the Japanese yen in
Tokyo Friday, while stock prices declined for a fourth consecutive
day.
   The dollar finished the week at 146.62 yen, down 0.25 yen from
Thursday's close of 146.87 yen. After opening at 146.59 yen, the
currency ranged between 146.40 and 146.90 yen.
   On the Tokyo Stock Exchange, the Nikkei Stock Average of 225
selected issues, which lost 118.75 points Thursday, shed 36.75
points, or 0.10 percent, closing at 34,115.81.
   Currency dealers said the dollar rose in early trading due to
dollar-buying sentiment following the decision Thursday by West
Germany's central bank to leave interest rates unchanged.
   But intervention by the Bank of Japan and profit-taking quickly
braked the dollar's rise, said a dealer for a major commercial bank
in Tokyo who spoke on condition of anonymity.
   On the stock market, the Nikkei index fell during the afternoon
session, reversing its morning gains. Dealers said the market
declined because of profit-taking and concern over forecasts of
higher interest rates.

<HEAD>Study: Homeless Face Multiple Health Problems, Receive Little Help</HEAD>

   Proper health care is mostly unavailable for the
more than 80 percent of homeless people studied in Baltimore
suffering from mental illness, a medical researcher says.
   ``Current resources are woefully inadequate'' to meet the needs
of the homeless, concluded a study published in today's Journal of
the American Medical Association.
   In an accompanying commentary, Dr. David Hilfiker of the
Community of Hope Health Services in Washington said that behind the
statistics of the study ``lies human pain we who are affluent can
scarcely imagine.''
   The study by Dr. William R. Breakey of the Johns Hopkins
University School of Medicine psychiatry department and his
colleagues found that 80 percent of the women surveyed and 91
percent of the men suffered from mental health problems.
   Schizophrenia was diagnosed in 12 percent of men and 17 percent
of women, and major depression or manic-depressive disorders in 19
percent of men and 24 percent of women. Less severe psychiatric
problems, such as phobias or anxiety disorders, were found in 28
percent of men and 44 percent of women.
   Alcohol abuse was found in 68 percent of men and 32 percent of
women in the sample.
   Although more than half of those surveyed acknowledged having
used illegal drugs, just 22 percent of men and 17 percent of women
were considered to have a problem with drug dependency.
   Among the most common physical problems observed were dental,
gynecological, skin, heart, respiratory and neurological disorders,
the researchers said.
   On average, 8.3 physical problems were found in men and 9.2
problems in women.
   The study was based on a random sampling in 1986 and 1987 of 298
homeless men and 230 women from missions, shelters and jails in
Baltimore.
   A subgroup of 203 people was selected for detailed psychiatric
and physical examinations.
   Hilfiker said the statistics ``all testify to enormous suffering,
much of it preventable.'' The government must spend more money to
provide health care for the poor, Hilfiker said.
   Congress is trimming the allocation for health-care programs for
the homeless from the $207 million recommended by the Bush
administration in its fiscal 1990 budget to $160 million, said Mary
Ellen Hombs, acting director of the Washington office of the
National Coalition for the Homeless.
   Ms. Hombs sid the Baltimore study reflects national trends.
   ``We see rates of mental illness running around 30 percent
nationwide and about the same for alcohol abuse,'' she said.
``Homelessness is a serious health threat and it can actually kill
you.''
   Both Ms. Hombs and authors of the study said the homeless need
more community mental health services, specialized services for
substance abusers, and special treatment programs staffed by people
familiar with their problems.
   Estimates of the number of homeless people in the United States
range from 250,000 to 3 million.

   An abortion-rights coalition is planning to
stage rallies in the nation's capital and in cities across the
country this fall to kick off a nationwide political organizing
effort.
   The aggregation of women's groups and religious, labor, business
and advocacy organizations Thursday announced that they will hold
rallies and other events Nov. 12 to register supporters to vote,
enlist their help in political organizing and boost the campaigns of
abortion-rights candidates.
   ``We will make it the political issue of 1989, 1990, 1992, and we
will change the legislative halls of this country so that we have
pro-choice legislators everywhere in the majority,'' said Molly
Yard, president of the National Organization for Women. The actions
will be conducted under the banner ``Mobilize for Women's Lives.''
   Organizers said the coalition was formed before the Supreme
Court's July 3 decision giving states broad powers to regulate
abortions. NOW had wanted to stage a Washington rally this fall to
protest the court ruling, but other groups wanted more state and
community involvement.

   Common Cause charges that the Federal Election
Commission is falling down on its job of policing federal campaign
finance laws and has actually encouraged illegal practices by its
``seemingly willful refusal to act.''
   The citizens lobby Thursday said the problems are so pervasive
``the best, albeit drastic, remedy may be to abolish the FEC
altogether and to create a new election law enforcement agency.''
   ``The FEC in recent years increasingly has abdicated its most
basic responsibility _ to enforce the law,'' Common Cause said in a
report.
   Fred Eiland, a spokesman for the election commission, said he
wasn't certain whether the agency would issue a response. Common
Cause is an enduring critic of the FEC and has sued the agency
frequently.
   The study charged that the failure to enforce the federal
campaign finance laws ``springs both from the structural defects
Congress created in the agency and from the recalcitrance of the
commissioners themselves. Congress virtually has ignored the FEC's
failure to enforce the law.''
   Under laws passed after the Watergate scandals in the early
1970s, the FEC is charged with administering public funding of
presidential campaigns, policing public disclosure, interpreting
laws pertaining to presidential and congressional elections,
investigating alleged violations and undertaking enforcement actions.

<NOTE>UAW, Auto Industry Criticize Proposed Efficiency Standards</NOTE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Forcing automobile manufacturers to boost fuel
efficiency 40 percent by the turn of the century could make cars
less safe, hurt sales and cost jobs, industry representatives and
Senate opponents said.
   ``The increase in prices may make it prohibitively expensive for
people to purchase automobiles, therefore ... they'll continue
driving their old gas guzzler,'' Sen. Don Nickles, R-Okla., said.
   But the sponsor of a proposed update of the Corporate Average
Fuel Economy law said the same dire warnings were proven false after
the original measure was debated and enacted in the mid-1970s.
   ``Your predecessors ... in effect forecast the collapse of
Western civilization as we know it,'' Sen. Richard H. Bryan, D-Nev.,
told industry lobbyists during a hearing of the Commerce, Science
and Technology consumer subcommittee Wednesday.
   Instead, he said, the domestic industry remained profitable while
doubling the fuel economy of its cars. ``Why should I believe you,
based upon your previous testimony?''
   The CAFE law requires that each manufacturer's fleet of new cars
and light trucks sold in the Unites States average at least 27.5
miles per gallon. Bryan wants to require a 20 percent improvement in
fuel efficiency by 1995 and a 40 percent improvement by 2000.
   Spokesmen for domestic and foreign manufacturers said such large
increases were not technologically feasible.

<HEAD>Sailor's Family Calls for Independent Review of Iowa Blast</HEAD>
<HEAD>With PM-Iowa Inquiry, Bjt</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By THOMAS J. SHEERAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CLEVELAND (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The family of the sailor cited by the Navy as
most likely causing the USS Iowa explosion says he was made a
scapegoat and has called for an independent review of the disaster.
   ``The Navy reached the conclusion that they must have a scapegoat
in this matter to deflect attention away from their negligence,
their incompetence and their indifference in the operation of the
USS Iowa,'' said Kreig J. Brusnahan, an attorney representing the
family of Clayton Hartwig.
   Navy officials briefed Hartwig's family Thursday morning before
the report was released.
   ``I've never believed it right from the start,'' Hartwig's
sister, Kathy Kubicina, said when asked if she thought her brother
had caused the April 19 blast which killed him and 46 shipmates.
   Ms. Kubicina, who has been an outspoken defender of her brother,
said families of other Iowa victims had offered their support.
   ``We've been in touch with a few of the families who lost people
in that turret explosion and they're on our side,'' she said. ``They
said that the Navy is basically trying to cover their own self. We
got word from a few families, `Keep your heads up. You have nothing
to be ashamed (of).'''
   Ms. Kubicina and her father, Earl V. Hartwig, said they wanted a
congressional investigation into the Navy's handling of the Iowa
probe.
   ``The Navy is kind of investigating itself and clearing itself,''
Brusnahan said.
   Earl Hartwig, a Navy veteran, said he was unconvinced that his
son or any other crew member had caused the explosion.
   Family members disputed allegations reported in the media since
the blast that Clayton Hartwig was a suicidal homosexual.
   ``Why didn't he slit his wrists? Why didn't he jump off the
ship?'' Brusnahan said. ``Why would he take 46 of his closest
friends with him?''
   The Navy ``has concocted this fable in the guise of a 1,001-page
report in an attempt to shift the blame away from its dismal track
record in their operation of this battleship and lay the blame on a
dead sailor who isn't here to defend himself,'' Brusnahan said.
   ``Dead men can't defend themselves, the Navy knows that,''
Brusnahan said. ``Dead men can't be libeled, the Navy knows that.''
   Elsewhere, the findings were greeted with skepticism.
   Retired Rear Adm. Eugene Carroll said the Navy was grasping at
straws to explain the explosion. ``This probable cause diverts
attention from the question of the performance of the equipment and
the personnel,'' said Carroll, deputy director of the Center for
Defense Information in Washington.
   Still, others accepted the report.
   ``I would say the Navy Investigative Service has probably done
their homework. They probably know for fact, or have enough
evidence, circumstantial or not, to back up this theory,'' said
Steven Haight, a retired Navy man who worked mostly in intelligence
during a 20-year career.
   ``I don't think it's a cop-out,'' agreed Petty Officer 3rd Class
Michael Glass, a crewman on the amphibious cargo ship Charleston at
Norfolk, Va.
   The Iowa left its Norfolk homeport in June for six months in the
Mediterranean Sea. The crew received copies of the report Wednesday
during a port call in Gaeta, Italy, said Capt. Paul Hanley, an
Atlantic Fleet spokesman.

<HEAD>Green Left Alliance Wins Six Seats in Dutch Parliament</HEAD>
<HEAD>An AP Extra</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PAUL VERSCHUUR</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>THE HAGUE, Netherlands (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Anti-establishment politics gained
ground this week when the Green Left alliance won six seats in
Parliament, uniting after years of disagreement and capitalizing on
a wave of environmentalist sentiment.
   Division had been the rule among the Communist, environmentalist
and anti-NATO parties in the coalition. But when they stopped
fighting and ran on a single platform, the Green Left parties
doubled their contingent of three seats in the 150-seat legislature
in Wednesday's vote.
   The rise of the Green Left in the Netherlands comes after the
Greens drew a surprising 6 percent of the vote in June elections for
the European Parliament. Greens have won significant parliamentary
representation in countries such as West Germany and have made
steady electoral advances in Italy, where they hold key posts in a
number of municipal and regional governments.
   According to analysts in the Netherlands, Green Left's win was
mostly at the expense of the opposition Labor Party, seen by many
radical left-wing voters as too middle-of-the-road.
   Labor lost three of its 52 parliamentary seats in the election
Wednesday.
   Premier Ruud Lubbers' Christian Democrats kept their 54 seats and
remained the largest single legislative faction.
   Among establishment parties, ``Everybody has sort of moved toward
the center,'' said Ina Brouwer, leader of the Communist Party of the
Netherlands.
   In a pre-election interview, Ms. Brouwer said Labor's softening
of its once unconditional rejection of nuclear weapons was a major
factor contributing to the Green Left's success.
   In the early 1980s, Labor was active in a grass-roots campaign
against the deployment of 48 U.S. cruise missiles on Dutch soil. But
in recent years, the party has been far less outspoken in its
opposition to the proposed modernization of NATO's short-range
nuclear systems, rejected outright by Green Left.
   The alliance also has capitalized on renewed interest in the
environment, spurred by the government's fall last May over an
ambitious anti-pollution plan.
   Green Left's environmental platform includes slapping a
prohibitively high tax on the sale of automobiles and other
pollution-causing industrial products.
   The revenue of that so-called ``green tax'' has been estimated at
$3 billion and would be used to stimulate production methods that do
not harm the environment.
   ``I don't see other parties putting that into their platform yet
because they're serving two masters. One is the environment and the
other is economic growth,'' said Ms. Brouwer at her penthouse
apartment overlooking an Amsterdam canal.
   The party also wants to drastically raise the incomes of the
nation's 3 million recipients of subsistence-level social benefits,
prompting criticism by Labor leader Wim Kok that Green Left was
building ``castles in the air.''
   On Thursday, the conservative newspaper De Telegraaf noted with
relief that Green Left had not gained the 10 parliamentary seats
predicted by some pre-ballot projections.
   ``Green Left's ideas ... were so far beyond social reality that
they couldn't be taken seriously,'' the paper said.
   Apart from the Communists, the alliance includes the Pacifist
Socialist Party, a staunchly anti-military group that until recently
opposed all forms of armed resistance.
   Its remaining two members are the Evangelical People's Party and
the Radicals, left-wing groups that split off from Lubbers'
Christian Democrats in the 1970s and '80s.
   Disputes over leftist doctrine kept the four apart for decades,
although they formed alliances in some local elections.
   In the previous Parliament, the Radicals held two seats and the
Pacifist Socialists had one.
   Under the influence of grass-roots movements like the campaign
against the missiles, the four parties gradually grew closer, Ms.
Brouwer said.
   The 39-year-old lawyer lost her parliamentary seat in 1986 but
was returned in the Wednesday election.
   In 1982, she led the moderate faction of her party in a dispute
with orthodox Communists who saw her program of feminist-oriented
reform as an insult to the Moscow-ordained party line.
   The Soviet-oriented old guard formed its own splinter group.
   ``Centrally organized socialism with a one-party system is
bankrupt, that much is clear from events in Eastern Europe,'' Ms.
Brouwer said.

<HEAD>Former Nurse's Aide Pleads Guilty to Murder, Will Testify</HEAD>
<DATELINE>GRAND RAPIDS, Mich. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A former nurse's aide pleaded guilty
to murder and conspiracy and agreed to testify that she helped her
co-worker and lover kill one of five slain nursing home patients.
   Catherine May Wood told a judge on Thursday that she and
Gwendolyn Graham discussed killing as many as 20 patients at Alpine
Manor Nursing Home in Walker, a Grand Rapids suburb.
   In her appearance before Kent County Circuit Judge Robert Benson,
Wood admitted helping Graham kill Marguerite Chambers, 60, on Jan.
17, 1987. Two murder charges against Wood were dropped in exchange
for her guilty pleas to second-degree murder and conspiracy.
   In the plea bargain, Wood agreed to testify for the prosecution
in Graham's trial on five counts of first-degree murder and a count
of conspiracy to commit first-degree murder. Jury selection in
Graham's trial is to begin Monday.
   Attorney James Piazza, who is representing Graham, said Wood's
plea makes little difference in his case. He has called Wood a
pathological liar whose credibility he planned to challenge.
   Wood, tentatively scheduled for sentencing on Oct. 11, faces a
maximum of life in prison, with parole possible after 10 years.
   The five victims died at the nursing home between Jan. 18 and
April 7, 1987, of what was assumed at the time to be natural causes.
   Walker police began an investigation after Wood's ex-husband said
his former wife had confessed to him.
   At a preliminary hearing in April, Wood testified the deaths were
part of a pact she and Graham hoped would bind them as lovers. She
said Graham suffocated residents ``to relieve tension.''
   The pair chose patients whose poor physical condition would leave
no signs of a struggle, Wood testified. They abandoned a plan to
spell ``murder'' with the victims' initials after some of the
slaying attempts failed, she said.

<HEAD>Meeting Ends With Compromise Between Moderates and Hard-liners</HEAD>

<DATELINE>BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Moderates led by Yugoslavia guided
the ninth summit of non-aligned nations to a close today with
resolutions calling for the immediate release of all hostages and
debt relief for the Third World.
   ``We have achieved a high degree of unity about what the future
of our movement should be,'' Yugoslav president Janez Drnovsek told
the closing session.
   The moderates, who have emerged as the overwhelming majority in
the 102-member movement, resolutely resisted throughout the four-day
meeting attempts by a group of radical countries to introduce Cold
War rhetoric into the proceedings.
   However, some of the language in the summit's final declaration
reflected compromise among moderates and hard-liners, who insisted
on inclusion of references to ``the struggle against imperialism,
colonialism, neo-colonialism, racism apartheid and all forms of
domination.''
   An effort by Yasser Arafat, chairman of the Palestine Liberation
Organization, to add a condemnation of ``Zionism'' to the document
was thwarted by moderates after a heated debate. The reference
eventually was relegated to one of 30 political and economic
resolutions.
   Conference documents, drafts of which had earlier been prepared
by the Yugoslav hosts with the aim of revitalizing the non-aligned
movement, dealt with topics ranging from Afghanistan and the Middle
East to terrorism and drug trafficking.
   One document ``resolutely demanded that all hostages and all
kidnapped persons be immediately released ... irrespective of the
perpetrators and the place of the crime.''
   The document on ``international terrorism'' said the summit
participants condemned all acts of terrorism perpetrated by
individuals, states and groups of states.
   The movement also said growing links existed between terrorists,
rightist paramilitary groups and drugs smugglers.
   Economic issues, particularly the need to alleviate the burden of
the $1.32 trillion foreign debt of Third World countries, received
unprecedented attention at the summit.
   The meeting adopted a package of resolutions calling for the
cancellation of the debts for the least developed countries and
lower interest rates to help the debtor countries revive their
economic growth.
   The summit brought together about 50 heads of state and a dozen
premiers, the largest number to attend since the non-aligned
movement was founded in 1961.
   The movement once prided itself on its opposition to the
superpowers and on its efforts to secure international peace, but
since the 1970s member nations have fought a series of bloody wars
against each other.
   However, attempts by the summit's Yugoslav hosts to tone down
acrimonious debates between countries engaged in bitter conflicts,
such as Afghanistan and Pakistan, proved largely unsuccessful.
   U.N. Secretary General Peres de Cuellar also was successful in
reviving stalled peace talks between Iran and Iraq, after the two
countries exchanged accusations over who was to blame for
obstructing the negotiations.
   Today's closing ceremony was marked by a sudden and impassioned
appeal from the Lebanese delegate for all foreign forces to withdraw
from that country.
   A lighter touch was provided by Libyan leader Moammer Gadhafi
who, claiming he had come to ``save the movement,'' brought along a
small herd of camels and a full-sized bedouin tent that he pitched
in the yard of a guesthouse put at his disposal.
   A last-minute attempt by Nicaragua to host the next summit in
1992 foundered in the face of determined opposition from moderate
nations that felt the country should be selected at a ministerial
conference, to be held in Ghana in two years.

<DATELINE>BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The wife of missing Briton Jack Mann, a
World War II fighter pilot, said today she had been told he died and
that she believed the report to be true.
   Mann, 75, disappeared May 12 as he drove to a bank in
Syrian-policed Moslem west Beirut.
   None of Lebanon's kidnap groups has specifically identified him
as a hostage. But a previously unknown faction, the Cells of Armed
Struggle, claimed that it kidnapped an unidentified Briton in Beirut
the day Mann disappeared.
   It demanded the release of Arabs jailed in Britain for the 1987
killing of Palestinian cartoonist Ali Naji al-Adhami. But Scotland
Yard said no arrests had been made in that slaying.
   There has been no word since then about Mann's whereabouts.
   His wife, Sunny, said she received a telephone call Monday from
an unidentified man who told her: ``I have bad news about your
husband.''
   She said she later met the man at a shop in west Beirut's Hamra
commercial thoroughfare and ``he told me that Jack is dead.
   ``I waited, but there was no news about Jack on Tuesday,
Wednesday or Thursday,'' Mrs. Mann told reporters at her west Beirut
apartment.
   ``I don't know. There's no proof that he's dead at the moment,''
she said.
   But she noted that the report of her husband's alleged death
``seems correct.''
   Mrs. Mann refused to answer any more questions.
   A British Embassy spokeswoman, who asked that her name was not
used, said the embassy ``has no information at all about the
reported death of Mr. Mann.''
   ``We're trying to contact Mrs. Mann to find out what she knows,
but we haven't been able to talk to her yet,'' she said.
   The Manns lived in Beirut for 43 years. Mann worked as a pilot
with Lebanon's national airline, Middle East Arlines, for more than
20 years before retiring to manage a bar in Beirut.
   He is one of 16 Westerners missing in Lebanon. Most are held
hostage by pro-Iranian Shiite Moslem militants.
   The other Westerners are eight Americans, three Britons, two West
Germans, an Italian and an Irishman.
   The longest held hostage is American journalist Terry Anderson,
Chief Middle East Correspondent for The Associated Press. He was
kindapped March 16, 1985.
   The last foreign hostage to have died in Lebanon was U.S. Marine
Lt. Col. William R. Higgins, who was abducted Feb. 17, 1988, while
on U.N. duty in Lebanon.
   The pro-Iranian Organization of the Oppressed on Earth claimed
July 31 it hanged him in retaliation for Israel's abduction of a
Shiite Moslem cleric in Lebanon. Some reports say the killing
occurred months earlier, however.
   Shortly after Higgins' reported hanging, Joseph Cicippio, another
U.S. hostage, was threatened with death, then given a reprieve.

<TEXT>
   Colombia's latest round of violence has dried up the
flood of cocaine into the United States, raising prices and
shrinking the size of crack rocks, authorities say.
   But the sudden drop in trafficking could be the work of middlemen
trying to drive up the price, experts said Thurday, and could be
only temporary.
   The Coast Guard's southeastern district has seized 97 percent of
the more than 10,000 pounds of cocaine intercepted by the entire
service in 1989, according to Lt. Cmdr. Jeff Karonis. Now the
Miami-based district has seen cocaine imports suddenly grind to a
halt.
   ``We've seized about 10,000 pounds of cocaine in the last year,
which dwarfs what we had seized previously,'' Karonis said. ``But
then just about two weeks ago, it virtually stopped. It has fallen
off to virtually nothing.''
   ``We're still carrying out the same operations as we were, but
... the targets just aren't there.''
   Pat O'Brien, outgoing director of the U.S. Customs Service in
Miami, said agents from the district tracked three to five air drops
a week until the crackdown began in Colombia.
   ``We usually see somewhere in the area of 40,000 to 50,000 pounds
of cocaine a year,'' he said. ``Since the violence (in Colombia)
started, we have had only one major seizure. Now we have no
cocaine.''
   That recent cocaine seizure was an 800-pound shipment found on a
freighter in Tampa last Saturday but loaded and shipped before the
violence began.
   Attempted cocaine purchases by undercover agents have been put
off for two to three weeks, O'Brien said, and no new shipments have
been coming through.
   While the summer has traditionally been the busiest time of year
for traffickers, O'Brien said money-laundering activity monitored by
Customs also has dropped off.
   The change also has been noticed by the U.S. Drug Enforcement
Administration, but DEA agents said the reasons behind the apparent
drop in cocaine shipments remain unclear.
   ``Yes, there appears to be a slowdown of drug activity out of
South America,'' said Miami DEA spokesman John Fernandes, ``a
fluctuation in distribution, and a rise in the wholesale price of
cocaine.
   ``But we don't know if that's because of what's happening in
Colombia,'' Fernandes said, ``or if entrepreneurs are trying to take
advantage of what's happening to raise the price.''
   The price of large cocaine shipments has risen in the past two
weeks from $11,000-15,000 a kilogram to $18,000-19,000, said
Fernandes. Individual kilogram sales have gone up to $23,000.
   But the DEA spokesman noted: ``There have been slowdowns before''
in the cocaine supply. ``It is normal for the narcotics trafficking
business.''
   Metro-Dade police Cmdr. Steve Rothlein said the lack of crack
also is being felt on the street.
   The price of a kilogram of cocaine on the street has jumped by
about $7,000, said Rothlien, head of the county narcotics bureau.
   He said crack still sells for $10 a rock, ``but some of the rocks
are getting smaller.''
   The disruption appears to be due in part to the confiscation of
planes used to carry cocaine from southern Colombian processing
plants to coastal staging areas, O'Brien said.

<HEAD>Soviet Cosmonauts Switch to Manual to Dock With Mir</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Two Soviet cosmonauts had to switch to manual
steering today to travel the last few yards between their capsule
and the Mir orbiting station after the automatic link-up system
failed, Radio Moscow reported.
   The cosmonauts managed to complete the maneuver and remanned the
Mir complex after a hiatus of four months. They found the
traditional Russian welcome symbols of bread and salt left by the
last crew, Radio Moscow said.
   After reaching Mir, the Soyuz TM-8 capsule floated around it
instead of completing its approach correctly, Radio Moscow said.
   ``To cover the last few meters, Alexander Viktorenko was forced
to apply manual control of the craft,'' it reported.
   ``Such things occasionally happen in orbit,'' cosmonaut training
chief Vladimir Shatalov told Radio Moscow.
   The glitch was the latest in a series of guidance problems Soviet
spacecraft have experienced. A year ago, crew members who left Mir
were stuck in their space capsule for 26 hours after problems with a
guidance system forced them to abort two attempts to re-enter the
atmosphere. In 1987, it took several tries to dock an unmanned space
laboratory with Mir.
   Tass said today the Soyuz capsule hooked up with the space
station at 2:25 a.m. Moscow time (6:25 p.m. EDT Thursday), five
minutes later than scheduled.
   The cosmonauts carried out two manuevers earlier Thursday to
bring their craft close to the space station, the official news
agency said.
   ``Everything is in order on board and the cosmonauts feel well,''
Tass said.
   Flight commander Viktorenko and engineer Alexander A. Serebrov
blasted off from the Baikonur Cosmodrome in Soviet Central Asia
early Wednesday.
   Along with the cosmonauts, scientists sent up two modules to
increase the amount of living space at the space station and improve
its scientific capabilities.
   Viktorenko and Serebrov are to remain in orbit six months. Radio
Moscow said today they had already begun their research.
   Their mission was delayed because the new modules were not ready
and because of sharp public discussion over Sovit expenditures for
space exploration at a time when the country has a high budget
deficit and is seeking ways to improve supplies of many consumer
goods.

<HEAD>Dollar Lower Against Yen, Nikkei Also Down</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Concern over rising interest rates in Japan and
profit-taking pushed the dollar lower against the yen and depressed
stock prices on the Tokyo Stock Exchange today, dealers said.
   The dollar ended the week at 146.62 yen, down 0.25 yen from
Thursday's close of 146.87 yen. After opening at 146.59 yen, the
currency ranged between 146.40 and 146.90 yen.
   Currency dealers said the dollar rose in early trading but
intervention by the Bank of Japan and profit-taking in the afternoon
session quickly stemmed the dollar's rise due to fears of an
interest-rate increase.
   Market participants speculate that the central bank could be
forced to increase the official discount rate, the interest it
charges on loans to commercial banks, to shore up the weaker yen.
   The Bank of Japan last raised the discount rate in May. The 0.75
percentage point increase to 3.25 percent was the first rise in the
key rate in almost a decade.
   ``Some importers bought the dollars for weekend account
settlement, but there was a considerable dollar selling on
profit-taking over concern about rising interest rates,'' said Osamu
Seto, a dealer with Mitsui Bank, a major Japanese commercial bank.
   Finance Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto told a news conference that
current exchange rate levels should be viewed ``cautiously,'' and he
said he was ``nervous'' about the yen's recent decline against the
dollar.
   In the stock market, the Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected
issues, which lost 118.75 points Thursday, shed another 36.75
points, or 0.10 percent, to close at 34,115.81.
   The Nikkei index lost a total of 367.97 points during the past
four trading days after a 135.56-point gain on Monday.
   Securities dealers said the market's main barometer fell during
the afternoon session, reversing morning gains.
   In the market's key first section, an estimated 800 million
shares changed hands in moderately active trading, up from 600
million shares on Thursday.

Doctrine</HEAD>

   An Atlanta judge's decision to let a
quadriplegic turn off machines keeping him alive affirms developing
legal doctrine that competent people should control their destinies,
say judges and ethics specialists.
   But those attending a bioethics conference Thursday said such
decisions are difficult for judges as medical technology advances
create dilemmas not covered by law.
   ``None of these issues are easy,'' said Judge James Pudlowski of
the Missouri Court of Appeals. ``I think these are the most
difficult types of decisions judges have to make. But someone has to
make them. That's why we're on the bench.''
   The Missouri appeals court in November overturned a lower court
opinion and ruled against the family of a brain-dead women who
wanted doctors to stop giving her nutrients and let her die. The
case is on appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court, which decided to review
it.
   Pudlowski distinguished between the Atlanta case of Larry James
McAfee, 33, who has been kept alive by machines since a 1985
motorcycle accident, and the brain-dead woman's situation. He said
she can breathe without the use of medical technology while the
quadriplegic's life is being sustained by machine.
   ``We can't say to someone ... you can't have any more food and
water,'' Pudlowski said. ``There is a distinction.''
   Earlier this week, Fulton County, Ga., Superior Court Judge
Edward Johnson ruled McAfee's right to refuse continued
life-sustaining medical treatment outweighs the state's interest in
preserving his life.
   Family members and friends testified that McAfee, an avid
sportsman paralyzed from the neck down, had repeatedly told them he
wanted to die rather than continued as he is.
   McAfee himself signed a shaky ``X'' with a pencil held in his
mouth to an affidavit stating, ``I understand turning off the
ventilator will result in my death.''
   In Atlanta, McAfee's lawyer said his client did not expect the
legal process to move as fast as it did, and he has yet to make
plans for returning to Georgia to fulfill his wish to die.
   Randall H. Davis said Thursday that McAfee, who is in an
Alabaster, Ala., nursing home, ``was very pleased to hear about the
details of the order. He was particularly touched by the judge's
sensitivity and demeanor as I explained it to him, but he was
surprised it moved forward so quickly.''
   Davis said it would take ``a week or two at the earliest'' before
McAfee returns to Atlanta. He said McAfee wanted to arrange the
transfer to make it convenient for his family.
   Julie Orr, one of McAfee's sisters, said her brother has not told
the family how he will handle the trip or his death.
   Ruth Putilo, the director of the ethics program at Massachusetts
General Hospital, said at the Reno conference that McAfee's case
``is an interesting moment in legal history, but not a radical
departure from developing law.''
   ``He was a competent man who decided enough was enough,'' she
said. ``I think we're just bringing the patient more fully into the
negotiating process, as it were, in the medical field.
   ``We've moved away from an era when the doctor made all the
decisions and sometimes didn't tell the patient everything. ...
Questions still exist, however, when that person has no way to
communicate his or her wants.''
   Ms. Putilo said these kinds of life-and-death ethical decisions
are difficult for judges, doctors, patients, families involved, and
sometimes the best decision is ``the one that hurts everybody the
least.''
   ``There is not right and wrong,'' she explained. ``There are
several rights and wrongs. A person just has to choose the most of
the right and the least of the wrong.''
   Ms. Putilo and Pudlowski are among an expected 150 physicians,
lawyers, ethicists and judges planning to participate in a
bioethical conference at the National Judicial College in Reno. The
conference runs through Sunday.

<HEAD>Measles Up Dramatically This Year After 1988 Decrease</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT BYRD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   More measles cases have been reported in the
United States already this year than in any since 1980, as a decline
in the childhood disease has come to an abrupt halt.
   The national Centers for Disease Control, in its weekly report
Thursday, said 10,115 cases of measles had been reported through
last week. That's nearly five times the 2,170 cases reported at the
same time last year and is the highest total since 1980's 13,430.
   Federal health officials coincidentally issued their final
measles report for 1988 on Thursday, showing that the disease
decreased by 7 percent last year, to 3,411.
   The Atlanta-based CDC said more than 90 measles outbreaks have
been reported this year, mostly at colleges and universities.
However, one outbreak among unvaccinated preschoolers in Houston
struck more than 1,700.
   In Chicago, where officials say school doors will remain shut to
thousands of public school students until they are properly
inoculated and examined for measles, more than 1,000 measles cases
had been reported in the city as of Aug. 23. More than 80 percent of
the cases reported have been among preschoolers.
   The CDC said unvaccinated young children, particularly in
outbreak-prone inner cities, are one of two major impediments to
wiping out measles in the United States. The CDC said the other is
the failure of vaccinations to protect some people, which has
allowed outbreaks in highly vaccinated school populations.
   The CDC this year recommended a second dose of measles vaccine
for children beginning kindergarten or first-grade.
   Everyone born since 1957, when measles was so widespread that
Americans had some natural immunity, is considered a potential
measles risk.
   Dr. Steve Wassilak, a CDC immunization specialist, said: ``It
would be an expensive, exhaustive undertaking to revaccinate
everybody born since 1957.'' But revaccinating children upon school
entry, he said, should ``start chipping away'' at the problem.
   The CDC also has recommended earlier vaccinations for inner-city
children _ as early as 9 months, rather than the standard 15 _ to
try to prevent large outbreaks. Additionally, in the case of school
measles outbreaks, the agency has recommended revaccinating certain
children.
   Specifically, the CDC recommended outbreak revaccinations for
students who were vaccinated before 1980 or vaccinated between ages
12 and 14 months. In both cases, the agency said, studies have shown
diminished vaccine effectiveness.
   ``The two-dose schedule and intensive efforts to raise ...
immunization levels should facilitate the goal of measles
elimination in the United States,'' the CDC said.
   But Wassilak cautioned that measles rises and falls in cycles, to
some degree, and ``even if next year is low, that's not
inconsistent. There's not going to be an immediate effect; it's
going to take awhile for the new policy to deter a significant
number of measles cases.''
   Federal health officials believed measles eradication was within
reach early this decade, when only a few remaining clusters of the
disease remained, but the disease increased between 1983 and 1986.
   Still, incidence of measles remains well below the prevaccine
levels of half a million or more cases a year.

<HEAD>NATO Proposal Stalled By Greece-Turkey Rivalry</HEAD>

<DATELINE>VIENNA, Austria (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Debate within the Warsaw Pact has hindered
agreement on verification procedures as part of East-West arms
reductions, the Soviet ambassador said as talks on reducing
conventional forces resumed.
   Also Thursday, the longstanding rivalry between NATO allies
Greece and Turkey caused an impasse in efforts by the alliance to
limit military maneuvers as part of the negotiations, sources said.
   NATO diplomats in Vienna and Brussels Wednesday put the finishing
touches on the Western plan, described by senior officials as an
unprecedented effort to curb military exercises on the world's most
heavily armed continent.
   The East and West have said they will present proposals on
verifying reductions in conventional forces, but diplomats on both
sides have said privately that disagreements within their alliances
have been difficult to resolve.
   Soviet Ambassador Oleg A. Grinevsky said on West German
television Wednesday night his country would welcome hundreds of
North Atlantic Treaty Organization officers to monitor compliance.
   On Thursday, however, Grinevsky said differences arose within the
seven-nation Warsaw Pact at a meeting in Moscow last week, and he
would not say when the alliance would present its proposals.
   U.S. Ambassador Stephen J. Ledogar said differences on
verification within NATO, which has 16 members, were due to
``geographical reality.''
   With the alliance's European members, ``a thin sliver shaped like
a new moon around the Warsaw Pact,'' any proposal to remove troops
from heavily armed central Europe produces problems on the flanks,
he told a news conference.
   Diplomatic sources who spoke on condition of anonymity said after
the talks resumed that Greece believed NATO set the limits too high
when it proposed requiring military maneuvers be announced in
advance if 40,000 reservists were called up or 1,200 armored
personnel carriers used.
   Greece sought lower limits because of concern about neighboring
Turkey, said the sources, who characterized the matter as a
``psychological problem'' that could be overcome.
   Greek and Turkish relations worsened in 1974 when Turkish troops
invaded Cyprus after Greek-Cypriot officers, seeking to unite Cyprus
with Greece, staged a short-lived coup. The Mediterranean island has
been divided into Greek-Cypriot and Turkish-Cypriot zones since then.
   The West had hoped to begin this third, six-week round of talks
between NATO and the Warsaw Pact with proposals that would help
maintain what Ledogar called the ``breathtaking pace'' of the
23-nation negotiations, which began in March.
   Some diplomats say Norway and Turkey oppose the NATO plan for
reductions in central Europe because weapons withdrawn to Soviet
territory might be moved to their borders.
   Divisions also exist between the United States and Canada, which
want maximum verification, and European nations reluctant to have
inspectors from the Soviet bloc constantly touring their weapons
factories and military bases.
   Ledogar said he hoped proposals for curbing the number of weapons
in storage, armaments deployed during maneuvers and the number of
reservists called up could be presented next week. Verification
proposals should follow, he said.
   Grinevsky told reporters: ``The main thing now is not to declare
our positions; the main thing now is to agree on them. The time for
grand battles of words is over.''
   He and Ledogar expressed optimism about reaching agreement next
year and implementing a plan by 1992 or 1993.
   In proposals made July 13 at the end of the last round of talks,
NATO suggested limiting each alliance to 5,700 combat aircraft and
1,900 combat helicopters, with no nation having more than 3,420
combat aircraft and 1,140 combat helicopters.
   The West wants no more than 20,000 tanks, 16,500 artillery pieces
and 28,000 armored troop carriers for each alliance. In addition,
NATO proposes limiting the United States and Soviet Union to 275,000
soldiers each in Europe outside their national territory.
   In March the Warsaw Pact proposed reducing six kinds of weapons,
including aircraft, by 10 percent to 15 percent by 1994 and a
further 25 percent by 1997, with only defensive forces permitted by
2000.

<HEAD>Dollars Retreats, Gold in Tight Range</HEAD>

   The dollar retreated in European trading this
morning, but traders said the outlook for the U.S. currency remained
bullish.
   Gold was trading in a tight range in a lackluster market.
   Major central banks in Europe intervened on Thursday to restrain
the dollar's surge, and the Bank of Japan intervened today.
   The dollar finished down 0.25 yen in Tokyo, closing at 146.62
yen. Later in London, the dollar traded at 146.45 yen.
   ``But the central banks can't go against the market sentiment
with interventions alone,'' said a trader in Frankfurt, West
Germany. The key to the dollar's rise against the mark, he said, was
the decision by the West German Central Bank not to raise key
interest rates this week.
   Other late dollar rates in Europe, compared with late Thursday:
   _ 1.9828 West German marks, down from 1.9845
   _ 1.7100 Swiss francs, down from 1.7120
   _ 6.6785 French francs, down from 6.6880
   _ 2.2330 Dutch guilders, down from 2.2423
   _ 1,421.20 Italian lire, down 1,426.20
   _ 1.1865 Canadian dollars, up from 1.1842
   In London, the pound traded at $1.5475, compared to $1.5460 late
Thursday.
   Gold opened in London at a bid price of $359.75 a troy ounce, up
25 cents from the price late Thursday. At mid morning the city's
five major bullion dealers fixed a recommended price of $359.85.
   In Zurich, gold traded at $359.75 an ounce, unchanged from late
Thursday.
   In Hong Kong, gold rose 54 cents a troy ounce to close at $360.25.
   Silver traded at $5.13 a troy ounce, compared to $5.11 late
Thursday.

   It may not survive the ages, but life has
been extended at least temporarily for Carhenge, a circle of junked,
half-buried cars in a replica of England's prehistoric Stonehenge.
   In an effort to salvage the tourist attraction, the Alliance City
Council voted 3-1 Thursday night to pursue a change in zoning laws
allowing Carhenge to remain intact.
   Critics argue it should be torn down because it is unsightly. But
council members decided to review the special-use permit granted to
its creator, James Reinders of Houston, after he bought the land.
Reinders, a former Alliance resident, contends that the monument is
a work of art, though some critics have described it as nothing more
than a junkyard.
   Before Thursday night's vote, about a dozen citizens appeared at
a public hearing to voice their support for Carhenge.
   Janet Steele, executive director of the Alliance Area Chamber of
Commerce, told the council that Carhenge helps attract visitors to
the community in northwestern Nebraska. And a supportive letter was
submitted to the panel from state tourism director Peggy Briggs.
   Vice Mayor Paul Phaneuf made the motion Thursday night to
instruct city staff to prepare a change in the city zoning ordinance
allowing the display of non-commercial exhibits on land zoned
agricultural.
   The proposed amendment is to be considered at the council's next
meeting, set for Sept. 21.

   A weakened Hurricane Gabrielle continued past
Bermuda on a path to irrelevance today in the same cool Atlantic
waters where long-harmless Hurricane Felix was downgraded to a
tropical storm.
   Gabrielle's winds dropped from 135 mph to 105 mph after the
center of the hurricane passed northward about 300 miles east of
Bermuda late Thursday.
   While little change in strength was predicted for Gabrielle
today, forecasters expected Tropical Storm Felix to turn toward the
northwest and become engulfed in the larger Gabrielle system.
   ``The winds won't change much until it reaches cooler waters,''
said Bob Sheets, director of the National Hurricane Center.
   Thursday, residents in Bermuda reported swells of 10 feet in the
harbors, and the island's eastern tip reported swells of 15 to 20
feet.
   Cruise ships berthed in Hamilton, Bermuda's capital, had been
advised Wednesday to sail for the comparative safety of open waters
rather than get trapped in confined harbors.
   The high seas, and winds of 30 to 35 mph, prevented any seagoing
traffic around the island Thursday and prompted residents to buy
emergency supplies in the island's shops.
   But Gabrielle, Bermuda's second hurricane of the 1989 season and
the third in less than two years, largely bypassed the island,
according to forecasters at the hurricane center.
   Meanwhile, strong winds stretched more than 1,000 miles from
Gabrielle's center, reaching the U.S. East Coast.
   ``A ship 60 miles off the coast of Long Island reported seeing
12- to 15-foot seas,'' Sheets said. High seas also were reported off
the coast of North Carolina.
   At 6 a.m. EDT today, Hurricane Gabrielle was centered near 34.9
degrees north latitude and 59.5 degrees west longitude, or about 625
miles south of Sable Island, Nova Scotia. It was traveling north at
18 mph.
   Felix was downgraded from a hurricane to a tropical storm earlier
Thursday as it continued to weaken. The tropical storm posed no
threat to land as it traveled north northwest at 7 mph with winds of
50 mph.
   At 6 a.m., Felix was located near 41.8 degrees north latitude and
48.8 degrees west longitude, or about 400 miles southeast of Cape
Race, Newfoundland, in Canada.
   Gabrielle was the seventh named storm of the 1989 Atlantic
hurricane season. Storms are named when maximum sustained winds
reach 39 mph, and are classified as hurricanes at 74 mph.

   The bodies of two Palestinians suspected of
collaborating with Israel were found in the occupied Gaza Strip,
despite a warning by uprising leaders against killing fellow Arabs,
reports said today.
   In another development, Israeli military officials accused Syria
of being behind two recent attacks along the Israel-Jordan border,
Israel radio and three newspapers reported.
   The body of 30-year-old Niman Abu Hilal was brought to Nasser
Hospital in Gaza after he was severely beaten at his home in the
town of Rafah by masked Palestinian youths, Arab reports said.
   Late Thursday, the body of Jasser Al Krinawi, 24, was found
stuffed in a well in the Magazi refugee camp, reports said, adding
that he had been stabbed to death.
   Both were suspected of collaborating with Israeli authorities.
   An army spokesman said soldiers found the body of Krinawi, who
had been reported missing since the start of August. The spokesman
said four Arab suspects were in custody.
   The spokesman also confirmed the death of a 30-year-old Arab man
in Gaza. He said the man had been brought to the hospital after
suffering a fatal beating and stab wounds. Police were
investigating, said the spokesman, who declined to elaborate.
   The deaths raised to 109 the number of Palestinians killed by
fellow Arabs since the start of the uprising against Israeli rule
nearly 21 months ago. Most have been accused either of
collaboration, prostitution or drug dealing.
   In its latest leaflet, the underground leadership of the uprising
urged caution in killing collaborators, saying that accusations
should be cleared with the leadership and that suspects should be
given an opportunity to repent and reform.
   At least 559 Palestinians have been killed by Israeli soldiers or
civilians since the start of the rebellion; 39 Israelis also have
died in the violence.
   Katyusha rockets fired from Jordan hit Israeli farmland Thursday,
and a stray rocket apparently landed on Jordanian soil, the army
said. No damage or injuries were reported.
   Israel radio reported the attack was believed the work of the
Marxist Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine, based in
Syria.
   Last Saturday, a suspected Palestinian guerrilla infiltrated from
Jordan, killed two Israeli soldiers and wounded another before being
fatally shot. It was the fourth infiltration along the Israel-Jordan
frontier this year, breaking a lengthy period of quiet.
   The Syrian-based Taalat Yakoub faction of the Palestine
Liberation Front claimed responsibility for Saturday's border
penetration.
   Zeev Schiff, a military analyst for the Haaretz daily, said Syria
may be encouraging the Palestinians to act via Jordan to punish
Jordan's King Hussein for assisting Iraq in moving weapons to
Lebanon's embattled Christians. The Lebanese Christians this summer
have been engaged in ferocious artillery duels with Syrian forces
and their Moslem allies in Lebanon.
   Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir told television's Arabic
language service on Thursday that ``we still do not think that
Jordan's policy of ensuring the security and quiet of the border
between us has changed.''
   But Shamir called for greater ``caution and alertness'' by Jordan
to prevent further problems.
   Government officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, noted
that Jordan has recently allowed Palestine Liberation Organization
leader Yasser Arafat to reopen several offices in Amman. They
suggested the warming of relations may be giving a signal to
Palestinian groups that they are welcome to use Jordanian territory
for acts against Israel.

   The man accused of being the brains behind the
Medellin cocaine cartel's laundering of money in U.S. banks is
getting a crash course in American-style justice from his lawyer.
   Eduardo Martinez Romero _ on the U.S. list of so-called
``Extraditables,'' Colombia's most important drug kingpins _ was
being held without bond at an undisclosed, highly secure location as
he awaits his day in court.
   At a preliminary hearing Thursday before U.S. Magistrate Joel M.
Feldman, Martinez said through an interpreter that he understands
very little English and doesn't fully comprehend what is happening
to him.
   ``At this time, I do not understand the charges I am accused of.
We would like to have sufficient time to see what they deal with,''
Martinez said.
   Feldman agreed to delay his arraignment until Monday morning.
   An affidavit filed in court Thursday by U.S. Drug Enforcement
Administration agent Albert D. Latson said Martinez warned an
Atlanta undercover drug agent last year that he would be ``kidnapped
and interrogated'' if anything went wrong with their laundering
ventures for the Medellin cartel.
   The affidavit said that during January 1988 meetings in Panama
City, Panama, Martinez told agent Caesar Diaz ``in an angry voice
... that if anything goes wrong with his customer's money, the first
thing `they' do is question Mr. Martinez.''
   ``Mr. Martinez said he would disclose his contacts,'' the
affidavit said. ``Each person would be kidnapped and interrogated.
If the answers were not satisfactory, then `they' would retaliate.''
   Martinez, 36, appeared tired and somewhat distracted during the
hearing. Security at the courthouse was unremarkable, despite the
wave of bombings associated with the Colombian government's
crackdown on drugs, which resulted in Martinez's arrest in August.
Martinez was not handcuffed or shackled.
   Martinez's lawyer, Ed Garland, said his client was ``very
frightened and quiet'' when he was brought to court.
   ``I think it will be extremely difficult for him to get a fair
trial,'' Garland said. ``My understanding is that he wasn't afforded
any judicial process. He was just picked up and brought here.''
   U.S. Attorney Robert Barr, whose office is prosecuting the
Martinez case, said today that the reputed kingpin would be fairly
treated.
   ``We're confident that Mr. Martinez will not only get a fair
trial, but will receive all of the guarantees under our laws and our
Constitution, as would any defendant,'' Barr said on NBC's ``Today''
show.
   ``All of these issues, if there are issues, of pretrial
publicity, I'm sure will be brought out in court and be fully aired.
But we're confident of our case,'' Barr said.
   Martinez was brought to Atlanta before sunrise aboard a DEA
plane. He was then shuttled downtown to the federal courthouse
aboard a helicopter.
   Martinez, who told the judge he holds a postgraduate degree in
marketing, is accused of laundering up to $27 million in drug
profits by funneling the cash through U.S. banks.
   He was indicted in March in Atlanta as a result of an
investigation code-named Operation Polar Cap, which officials said
revealed an operation that laundered billions in cocaine profits.
Charges were brought against 127 people and two Latin American banks.
   Martinez, called by some the ``finance minister'' of the Medellin
cartel, is the first person extradited to the United States since
Colombia's crackdown began last month. He was arrested Aug. 20. A
previous attempt to arrest him in Panama failed last March.
   Garland told reporters after the hearing that President Bush's
speech Tuesday vowing a war on drugs may whip public opinion into
such a frenzy that Martinez cannot obtain a fair trial in Atlanta.
   ``The speech probably expressed accurately the feeling of the
American people,'' said Garland, a defense lawyer in Atlanta for 25
years. ``My concern is that in our frustration over the drug
problem, we will ignore our other freedoms. He, like anyone else in
our country, should be presumed innocent.''

   Anglican Bishop Simeon Nkoane,
a dedicated anti-apartheid activist and colleague of Archbishop
Desmond Tutu, has died of cancer. He was 60.
   Nkoane, who died Thursday at his home in the black township of
KwaThema, was assistant bishop of the diocese directly east of
Johannesburg. He had been ill for several years.
   He was deeply involved in community affairs of black townships in
the Johannesburg area and officiated at many funerals of blacks
killed in political unrest.
   Nkoane was consecrated a bishop in 1982. Before that, he was dean
of St. Mary's Cathedral in central Johannesburg for five years.

   The Irish Republican Army said
today that it shot and killed the West German wife of a British
soldier as she sat in her car in a military housing area.
   The attack Thursday night was the second at a British military
installation in West Germany in a week.
   In a statement released in Dublin, Ireland, the IRA said:
   ``The woman killed was believed to have been a member of the
British Crown Forces garrisoned in Dortmund. It has now emerged that
she was the German wife of a British Army staff sergeant.'' The
statement repeated a warning for civilians to stay clear of British
army personnel.
   ``We are up against the cowardly actions of terrorists who go for
innocent, defenseless people.'' Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher of
Britain said today. The mainly Catholic IRA is fighting to drive the
British out of Northern Ireland. Last week, it claimed
responsibility for an attack near Muenster in which two British
soldiers were seriously wounded.
   Hans-Juergen Foerster, spokesman for the federal prosecutor's
office in Karlsruhe, said the woman killed Thursday was 26. He
declined to disclose her name until her relatives had been notified.
   He said the gunman fired more than a dozen shots from a
Kalashnikov automatic rifle at the woman, who was sitting in the
family car. The car was parked and carried British plates.
   Foerster said the gunman got into a car and drove off after the
shooting. He wore British military battle fatigues and ``had at
least one accomplice'' who was in the car, Foerster said.
   A Dortmund police duty officer, who asked not to be identified by
name, said the attack occurred at 9:50 p.m. Thursday in the village
of Unna-Massen, located just outside of Dortmund, an industrial city.
   Since June, two car bombs have exploded at British military
housing areas in West Germany, and one soldier was killed in an
attack in Hanover.
   The IRA claimed responsibility for the fatal attack and is
suspected by police in the others.
   A third bomb planted in a soldier's car was found Aug. 28 and
defused without incident.
   More than 66,000 British soldiers and their dependents are
stationed in West Germany.

<TEXT>
   The Navy says it will tighten procedures on its
ships, but that it's difficult to prevent the suicidal behavior
officials believe caused the blast that killed 47 sailors aboard the
USS Iowa.
   A report on the April 19 explosion released Thursday by the
Pentagon said ``circumstantial evidence'' indicated that gunner's
mate Clayton M. Hartwig intentionally sparked the explosion.
   The family of the 25-year-old sailor contends the Navy made him a
scapegoat for its negligence.
   More than 1,100 pages of evidence released with the report
depicted Hartwig as an expert in explosives who had trouble making
friends, had once attempted suicide and 11 days before the explosion
said he might ``become one of those little white headstones in
Arlington National Cemetery any day.''
   But Petty Officer Kendall Truitt, once a close friend of Hartwig
on the Iowa and beneficiary of his $100,000 life insurance policy,
said today, ``I don't believe a word'' of the report and said
Hartwig lacked the mechanical aptitude to build an explosive device.
   ``... I had to install this man's radio in his car because he
couldn't do it, and this came with instructions,'' Truitt said on
ABC's ``Good Morning America'' program.
   The admirals investigating the explosion also found that Iowa
officers were lax in instructing sailors on gunnery, and ordered
that procedures be tightened before the 16-inch guns resume regular
firing.
   Firing of the guns has been suspended since the explosion, but
were tested last month.
   ``As with any catastrophe, the immediate impulse is to take every
possible step to prevent a recurrence,'' wrote Adm. Carlisle A.H.
Trost, chief of Naval Operations and the Navy's top officer.
   However, Trost said in a commentary, ``it is virtually impossible
to have established procedures to absolutely preclude disastrous
results of such an individual choice.''
   Adm. Leon Edney, the vice chief of naval operations, said the
Navy would not change its psychological screening procedures, saying
the investigation found nothing to require a drastic change.
   Investigators said Hartwig's alleged suicidal tendencies were not
known to his superiors, only becoming apparent after interviews with
acquaintances and family during the four-month investigation.
   ``He was a clean-cut sailor. He didn't smoke. He didn't drink. He
didn't carouse on leave. ... He wasn't a troublemaker,'' Edney said
at a Pentagon news conference.
   But the report concluded that Hartwig was ``the principal
suspect.''
   ``He was emotionally capable of committing suicide, probably with
the intent of killing others also,'' it said.
   ``We don't know the motivation,'' Edney said.
   Kreig J. Brusnahan, a lawyer representing the Hartwig family,
criticized the report.
   ``The Navy reached the conclusion that they must have a scapegoat
in this matter to deflect attention away from their negligence,
their incompetence and their indifference in the operation of the
USS Iowa,'' Brusnahan said.
   Rear Adm. Richard D. Milligan, who directed the investigation,
told reporters how Hartwig stood next to the breech in the middle
gun of turret No. 2, describing how he could have dropped a
detonator between bags of gunpowder being loaded during firing
exercises off Puerto Rico.
   But because all those near Hartwig died, ``we will never know
with absolute certainty exactly what happened,'' Edney said.
   The circumstances of the explosion are muddied further by ``a
number of major administrative and supervisory discrepancies on
board the USS Iowa, as well as substantial and serious failures by
senior USS Iowa personnel to properly discharge their
responsibilities,'' Adm. Powell F. Carter, commander of the Atlantic
Fleet, said in a letter released with the report.
   Among the problems cited were a failure to fully train sailors on
firing procedures. But Carter said those discrepancies were ruled
out as a cause of the blast.
   Milligan began investigating the possibility that the explosion
was intentional after receiving a letter May 8 from Hartwig's
sister, Kathy Kubicina, saying Hartwig meant to change the
beneficiary of the insurance policy from Truitt to his parents.
   Truitt's friendship with Hartwig cooled after Truitt became
involved with a woman, Milligan said.
   Friends and acquaintances described Hartwig as ``weird,''
``troubled'' and ``shy,'' saying ``he had a hard time making
friends,'' and ``had very little self-esteem,'' according to the
report.
   One woman told investigators that ``Hartwig confided to her that
he was unhappy aboard the ship because the other sailors made fun of
him.''
   The names of those who spoke with investigators were blacked out.
   In a letter written to a woman friend 11 days before the
explosion, Hartwig said:
   ``I really wish you would stop saying that I am hiding in the
Navy. ... I don't think the 1,200 men that went down on the USS
Arizona were hiding, or the 37 sailors that were killed on the USS
Stark in the Persian Gulf in 1986! I could become one of those
little white headstones in Arlington National Cemetery any day!''
   Several sailors said Hartwig told them he had ``feelings of
suicide'' and ``had attempted suicide.'' Several sailors also said
Hartwig said he knew how to build bombs.
   ``He told me he could take out the ship very easily with a small
bomb,'' said one sailor. ``He just said that an internal explosion
that could set off magazines with chain reaction would go all the
way down the ship.''
   Although investigators found no evidence that Hartwig had built a
detonator, they did find a book called ``Getting Even'' and a
military manual on explosives at his bunk.
   The Milligan report recommended charges against five individuals
whose names were blanked out; administrative action to caution three
people, including the executive officer of the ship, ``with respect
to ... duties''; removal of the gunnery officer and the weapons
officer from their jobs and administrative or disciplinary action
against another person _ one recommendation not approved by the
chief of naval operations.
   The endorsement by the chief of naval operations concurred in a
recommendation by the commander of surface forces, Atlantic Fleet,
that the captain and executive officer not be subject to judicial
action or removal. But the Navy's chief directed that special
reprimands be prepared for them.

<HEAD>Communist Reformer Wins Place in Hungarian Congress</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BUDAPEST, Hungary (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Communist reformer Imre Pozsgay was
chosen as a delegate to a crucial party congress when his supporters
defeated an attempt by hard-liners to deny him a position, an
official newspaper said today.
   Pozsgay is a member of the four-man leadership named in June to
run the Communist Party and the country until the October congress.
   He is at the center of a fierce debate over whether Hungary's
Communist Party is to become the first in the Soviet bloc to
formally split into factions. Reformists, centrists and hard-liners
will be vying for control of the party's 700,000 members and assets
at the four-day congress opening Oct. 6.
   Pozsgay's failure to win election as a congress delegate from the
northeastern town of Debrecen earlier this week prompted a stream of
protest calls to party president Rezso Nyers.
   Secretary-general Karoly Grosz, also in the four-man leadership,
faced a stormy meeting of Budapest congress delegates objecting to
Pozsgay's exclusion.
   The official daily Magyar Nemzet reported that Pozsgay won
election Thursday as a congress delegate in Kecskemet, 40 miles
outside Budapest.
   Central Committee official Andras Toth said today that
three-quarters of the 1,200 delegates already have been chosen.
   The congress is supposed to chart the party's course for
multiparty elections to be held by June. Nyers has estimated the
party can win at most 30 percent of votes in the East bloc's first
wholly free elections.
   Last weekend, a meeting of party reformers, including Pozsgay,
Nyers and Premier Miklos Nemeth, indicated some liberals will seek a
formal break with the party if the congress does not shift to being
a democratic body.
   At the time, hard-liners critical of Pozsgay held a separate
meeting, and received a telegram of greetings from Karoly Grosz, the
only member of the four-man party leadership who was not at the
reformists' gathering.

<HEAD>Government Says Emigration Will Jump 23 Percent In 1990</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN POMFRET</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>HONG KONG (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Emigration from Hong Kong will jump 25 percent
in 1990 because of fears of the Communist Chinese takeover, said an
official.
   About 55,000 people will leave Hong Kong in 1990, up from a
projected 42,000 in 1989, Mike Rowse, head of a government task
force on emigration, told reporters today. A private emigration
specialist said both figures are low.
   Lack of confidence in Hong Kong's future caused by China's
crackdown on a movement for freedom is the main reason for the
projected increase, he said.
   The expected exodus is already damaging Hong Kong, Rowse said of
the 409-square-mile British colony of islands and peninsula
transformed into an economic powerhouse by its hard-working people.
   Talented people are leaving the colony, hurting various
industries, he said, and their departure affects the morale of those
who stay.
   The territory on the southern Chinese coast reverts to Beijing in
1997 under an agreement signed in 1984 by Britain and China. Beijing
has promised to maintain Hong Kong's freewheeling economic system
for 50 years, but many in the colony do not believe that.
   Since the June 3-4 crackdown, thousands in Hong Kong have been
clamoring for the right to settle in Britain, but the British
government has refused.
   London currently is working on a nationality package that will
give some Hong Kong residents the right to live in Britain.
   Rowse criticized the British government for looking at the
package purely ``in terms of Asian immigration and not as a matter
of principle.''
   ``The Hong Kong people were never given an opportunity to decide
what they wanted ... nor were they represented in the British
Parliament which took the decision,'' he said. ``I think we have to
ask: Is that fair?''
   Last year, 45,800 people emigrated from Hong Kong, mostly to the
United States, Australia and Canada. The figure marked a 35 percent
increase over 1987 and a 51 percent jump from 1980, the first year
statistics were kept.
   This year, the government has projected emigration will fall
about 4,000.
   An emigration specialist claimed the projections are low.
   ``The only way emigration will fall is because consulates in Hong
Kong are getting too many applications and there is a backlog,''
said Horatio Cheung, of the Hong Kong Freedom of Movement and Rights
of Abode. ``It would in no way reflect people's desire to get out.''
   Government figures show the number of requests for certificates
of no criminal convictions, a document required by many countries,
doubled in July and August of this year when compared to the same
months last year.
   In an interview, Cheung said the colony faces ``a catastrophic
brain drain'' and that he doubts efforts by China, Britain and the
colony will succeed in calming people's fears.
   Government statistics released Thursday indicate the average Hong
Kong emigrant has five times more chance of being college-educated
and employed as a professional than the average colony resident.
Emigrants also are younger.

<HEAD>State Department Raps ANC But Wants to Expand Contacts</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BARRY SCHWEID</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The State Department says it differs strongly
with the violent methods of the African National Congress but
intends to expand its contacts with the black group in an effort to
dismantle racial segregation in South Africa.
   ``As the oldest African nationalist movement in South Africa, the
ANC reflects the aspirations of many blacks for a just and
democratic system,'' the department said in a policy statement
released Thursday night.
   It also called for the release of ANC leader Nelson R. Mandela,
who has been imprisoned since the early 1960s, by the new government
of acting President F. W. de Klerk.
   ``The ANC is one of several organizations with substantial
political support in South Africa, particularly but not only among
blacks,'' the statement said. ``It is a political diverse
organization representing a range of views.''
   The Bush administration intends to expand its dialogue with the
ANC and other South Africans across the political spectrum, the
statement said.
   Earlier, the State Department called on South Africa to end the
state of emergency it imposed in 1986 and legalize the ANC and other
anti-apartheid groups.
   And yet, the department's statement said ``we strongly differ
with the ANC on some of its methods for pursuing these objectives.
We have condemned its use of violence, as we have all violence in
South Africa, whatever its source.''
   Department spokeswoman Margaret D. Tutwiler called the election
of de Klerk ``a mandate for real change in South Africa.''
   The department press office said later that Secretary of State
James A. Baker III would like to meet with de Klerk ``at a mutually
convenient time.''
   Congratulating de Klerk on his election, Ms. Tutwiler said: ``We
are committed to working with all parties to bring the South African
government and black South Africans together in a substanial effort
to end apartheid.
   ``We therefore are prepared to work with the new government
toward this end. The most important first step in the process is
dialogue among South Africans.''
   She offered no hint as to what role the United States may play in
promoting an end to apartheid.
   U.S. influence in South Africa declined sharply after Congress
imposed sanctions against that country in 1986 over President
Reagan's veto. There has been little high-level contact between the
two governments since.

<HEAD>Aoun Calls For U.S. Diplomats to Return</HEAD>

<DATELINE>BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Gen. Michel Aoun today called on
Washington to send back its diplomats, taking a conciliatory tone as
his besieged Christian forces battled Syrian troops outside Beirut
with tanks and mortars.
   War-weary residents of the capital got a respite today as the
fighting raged in rain-lashed mountains overlooking Beirut, center
of a 6-month-old confrontation between Aoun's Lebanese Christian
forces and the powerful Syrian army allied to Lebanese Moslem
militias. No injuries were reported.
   Aoun's three-man Cabinet issued a statement urging the United
States to ``reconsider the evacuation of its diplomats from Lebanon
in order to preserve bilateral relations.'' On Thursday, Aoun lashed
out at the United States, saying its decision to pull out was based
on half-truths and propaganda.
   U.S. Ambassador John McCarthy and 29 diplomats were airlifted
from their fortified embassy in Christian east Beirut on Wednesday
after Aoun accused Washington of siding with Syria and reportedly
threatened to seize Americans.
   The pullout heightened the Christians' sense of isolation at a
time when Aoun seeks to muster international support for his
campaign to drive the Syrians out of Lebanon. Syrian troops came to
Lebanon under a 1976 Arab League peacekeeping mandate Aoun says they
betrayed by siding with the Moslems.
   Aoun's new conciliatory tone was adopted after he summoned his
chief aides to a meeting in his underground command bunker, two
floors below the shell-battered presidential palace in Christian
east Beirut, to assess the repercussions of the U.S. move. The
withdrawal marked the first time the U.S. mission in Beirut has
closed since the civil war began in April 1975.
   McCarthy and his staff were evacuated a few hours after 1,000
young Christians besieged the embassy compound, demanding U.S.
action to help them.
   The Christians believe Washington has not tried to rein in the
Syrians, who outnumber Aoun's forces by 3-1, for fear of harming
U.S. hostages held by in Lebanon by Iranian-backed Moslem
fundamentalists. Syria is Iran's closest ally.
   Eight Americans are among 16 Westerners missing in Lebanon. The
other captives are four Britons, two West Germans, an Italian and an
Irishman. Sunny Mann, the wife of one of the Britons, Jack Mann,
said today she believed he died in captivity, but the British
government did not confirm that.
   Acting Prime Minister Salim Hoss, who heads a Syrian-backed
Moslem Cabinet vying for power with Aoun's, expressed regret today
at the U.S. withdrawal.
   In a statement broadcast by the Moslem-run Voice of the Nation
radio, he said he ``hopes that all foreign diplomats would return to
Lebanon.''
   Aoun's appeal today made no reference to his previous statement
that he would welcome the American diplomats' return only if
Washington recognizes his Cabinet as Lebanon's ``legitimate
government.''
   McCarthy, who arrived in Lebanon a year ago, did not present his
credentials to either Aoun or Hoss.
   Lebanon's majority Moslems want a bigger share of power in
running the country traditionally dominated by Christians, who are a
minority.
   The current round of fighting broke out March 8 when Aoun
blockaded illegal ports south of Beirut run by Syrian-backed
militias in a vain bid to restore long-eroded government authority.
   A police spokesman said today's battles raged around Douar area,
12 miles northeast of Beirut. Douar controls one of the main routes
into the beleaguered Christian enclave north of the capital.
   The spokesman, who cannot be named under standing regulations,
said there was no immediate report of casualties. At least 830
people have been killed and 2,462 wounded since the artillery war
began in March.
   Ninety percent of Beirut's 1.5 million people have fled the
divided city, which is shelled almost daily by both sides.

<HEAD>Council OKs Bill to Ban Horse-Drawn Carriages from Midtown</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The horse-drawn carriages that hundreds of
thousands of tourists ride and photograph would mostly disappear
from midtown Manhattan streets under a bill approved by City Council.
   The bill, which drivers said could destroy their business, would
bar the popular carriages from midtown streets except between
midnight and 7 a.m. to protect the horses from heat and traffic,
said its main sponsor, Councilman Robert Dryfoos.
   ``When carriage horses were of yore 100 years ago, Manhattan was
an oasis. Now, midtown Manhattan is a jungle. I want to take them
out of the asphalt jungle,'' Dryfoos said.
   The bill, which now goes to Mayor Edward Koch, would ban horse
carriages entirely during rush hours. During non-rush-hour periods
between 7 a.m. and 7 p.m., the carriages would be restricted to
Central Park. From 7 p.m. to midnight, the carriages would be
allowed on city streets except in the congested midtown area, and
from midnight to 7 a.m., they would be allowed in midtown as well.
   The bill also limits use of the horses to eight-hour shifts,
gives them 15-minute rest breaks every two hours and forbids their
working when the temperature is above 89 degrees or under 18 degrees.
   It would require drivers to have more training and owners to
carry more liability insurance.
   Opponents of the bill, mainly the 68 carriage owners and 120
drivers, said they could not do business under the new restrictions.
But the bill also contains a provision allowing the drivers to
increase fares.

<HEAD>U.S., South Korea Reach Tentative Agreement On Drift Net Treaty</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LES BLUMENTHAL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   U.S. and South Korean negotiators reached
tentative agreement early today on a North Pacific fishing treaty,
heading off a confrontation that could have led to a ban on South
Korean fisheries products.
   Ed Wolfe, the State Department's ambassador for oceans and
fisheries, said the agreement would be initialed after both sides
reviewed the final text. Before it could go into force, both nations
will have to formally sign it.
   Under the agreement, U.S. enforcement officers will have
``unrestricted authority'' to board and inspect Korean drift net
vessels to search for evidence of illegal fishing and all Korean
drift net vessels will have to be equipped with satellite
transponders by the 1990 fishing season, Wolfe said.
   The transponders will allow U.S. officials to keep track of the
location of the Korean vessels to ensure they don't fish outside of
designated drift net fishing areas.
   The agreeement also calls for scientific monitoring of the Korean
fleet and will allow the Koreans to fish in an expanded area in the
North Pacific during the month of May.
   President Bush warned the Koreans two weeks ago that they faced a
possible ban on shipments of their fishery products to the United
States if they hadn't reached an agreement by the end of September.
   Drift net treaties were earlier negotiated with Japan and Taiwan.
   Wolfe said the State Department was satisfied with the tentative
pact with the Koreans and talks with the Koreans had been ``more
difficult'' than those he conducted with the Japanese and Taiwanese.
   More than 700 driftnet vessels from Japan, Taiwan and Korea have
been using drift nets in the North Pacific ostensibly to catch
squid. But U.S. fishing groups have claimed the vessels are actually
fishing for North American salmon and that runs in Alaska,
Washington state and Oregon have already suffered as a result of the
illegal catch.
   Environmentalists, who call the nets ``walls of death,'' have
said their use results in the deaths of thousands of marine mammals
and seabirds annually.
   The lighweight, monofilament nets can stretch for more than 30
miles and hang in the water snaring any animal they come in contact
with. On any given day, the nets can cover an estimated 30,000 miles
of ocean.
   Congressional reaction to the Korean agreement was guarded.
   Sen. Frank Murkowski, R-Alaska, said he was satisfied with the
treaty's enforcement provisions, but was critical of the expanded
fishing zone for Korean vessels in May and the scientific observer
program.
   ``All these countries ought to be held to the same standard, and
that should be as rigid as necessary to protect our interests,''
said Murkowski.
   Rep. Jolene Unsoeld, D-Wash., who has introduced legislation
calling for an international ban on the use of drift nets, said
``it's important to remember that these are just monitoring
agreements. The drift net fleets will continue intercepting our
salmon and indiscriminately slaughtering the world's marine life.
   ``We will just have a little better idea of the extent they are
doing that.''

   Representatives of Ethiopia and a rebel Eritrean
group opened preliminary talks on ending the war they have waged
since 1961, meeting far from their African homeland with former
President Jimmy Carter acting as neutral observer.
   Delegations from the government and the Eritrean People's
Liberation Front met with reporters and issued opening statements
Thursday, then went behind closed doors at the Carter Center to try
to set an agenda for more substantive negotiations. They resumed
their talks this morning.
   ``When you consider that this is a 40-to-50-year struggle, the
fact that they're there is a great accomplishment,'' Mayor Andrew
Young said today after attending a breakfast meeting at the center.
``And the mood is, you know, friendly, but this is real difficult
for both sides.''
   During breakfast, Young said, there was ``still not a great deal
of interchange'' between the two sides.
   He said the talks were taking place not across a table but in ``a
kind of living room environment ... as though they were in the
Carters' home, talking.''
   No time limit was set for the preliminary talks. Young, who was
United Nations ambassador during the Carter administration, said
today that he thought they would go at least into the weekend.
   Carter had said earlier that giving progress reports before the
talks ended would be counterproductive.
   ``It makes it very difficult if both sides are giving their own
separate and sometimes conflicting reports about the process and
also revealing private statements made in the talks,'' said Carter,
who as president a decade ago helped bring about the Camp David
accords between Egypt and Israel.
   Ethiopia and Eritrean rebels have been fighting over the
independence of the province of Eritrea, a former Italian colony
that has Ethiopia's only direct access to the Red Sea. An estimated
1 million people have died in the war and related famine.
   The rebels considers the conflict to be a war for independence;
Ethiopia views it as a battle for secession.
   A U.N. agreement federated Eritrea with Ethiopia in 1952. Rebel
groups began forming in the early 1960s when they did not get
self-rule and Ethiopia unilaterally annexed the area.
   Leaders of both sides referred Thursday to the bitter divisions
between them.
   ``The search for peace ... should not be viewed as a subterfuge
to buy time, or, still worse, as part of military maneuvers and
tactics of war,'' said Alamin Mohamed Saiyed, the head of the
Eritrean delegation and a member of the Politburo of the Eritrean
People's Liberation Front.
   Ashegre Yigletu, head of the government delegation, said Ethiopia
has tried repeatedly during the past 15 years to end the conflict
peacefully.
   ``These peace talks should start off in an atmosphere that avoids
polemics and recrimination,'' he said.
   Alamin and Ashegre each sat with stern expressions as the other's
statement was read in Arabic then translated for the
English-speaking reporters. But, prodded by Carter, they rose at the
meeting's conclusion and shook hands.
   The Atlanta Journal-Constitution quoted unidentified diplomats
Thursday as saying Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak would mediate
further talks if the Carter Center sessions were successful.
   The Atlanta talks are under the auspices of an informal group
called the International Negotiating Network, which includes
scholars and former diplomats and operates out of the Carter Center.
   The Carter Center, opened in 1986, houses the presidential
libaray, a museum, a think tank and organizations dedicated to
peace, public health and other issues.

   The law and order minister
accused anti-apartheid leaders today of lying when they blamed
police for more than 20 deaths during anti-election protests.
   Activists stuck by their claims and demanded the minister's
ouster.
   The Rev. Allan Boesak and other activists said at a news
conference that they knew of 29 people killed in the Cape Town area
in election-related violence Wednesday night.
   ``The evidence points to the fact that the violence in all these
areas was instigated by police,'' said Boesak, who called for the
dismissal of Law and Order Minister Adriaan Vlok.
   Vlok said in a statement that Boesak and Anglican Archbishop
Desmond Tutu were trying to capitalize politically on the extensive
violence that occurred this week in mixed-race townships near Cape
Town.
   Vlok also claimed 26 policemen were injured in unrest late
Wednesday and early Thursday following elections for the white,
mixed-race and Indian chambers of Parliament.
   Blacks are excluded from Parliament, and militant leaders of all
races urged a boycott of the elections for the two non-white
chambers.
   Vlok expressed his ``deepest condemnation about the lies and the
manner in which the two church leaders have attempted to make
political gains from the unrest.''
   Boesak, president of the World Alliance of Reformed Churches,
said Thursday that acting President F.W. de Klerk ``now sits in a
pool of blood'' because police had opened fire on anti-election
protesters.
   According to Vlok, police are aware of 15 unrest deaths in the
Cape Town area Wednesday night, 10 of them attributed to
black-against-black factional fighting in the township of
Khayelitsha. He said the other five deaths were being investigated.
   Vlok's spokesman, Brig. Leon Mellet, challenged Tutu and Boesak
``to produce the evidence which they used as the basis for telling
the world that the presidential seat of the acting state president
was dripping with blood because of the alleged deaths of 23 people
in the Cape on election night.''
   ``We do not have such information,'' Mellet said.
   Both police and anti-apartheid activists increased their figures
for known deaths today. Police earlier had reported 12 deaths, and
activists had reported 23 on election day.
   Although the number of deaths remains in dispute, hospital
officials have confirmed that dozens of people were treated for
birdshot wounds sustained during the disturbances.
   About 180 lawyers, law professors and law students held a
demonstration today in downtown Cape Town to denounce police
violence. Prior to the protest, anti-apartheid lawyer Dullah Omar
said police brutality ``reached uprecedented heights'' this week.
   In a related development, figures released today showed that
despite an election system designed to make voting easy, fewer than
20 percent of Indian and mixed-race adults cast ballots for their
segregated houses of Parliament.
   One Indian candidate, Gangiah Naidoo, received zero votes.
   The Indian and mixed-race chambers are largely impotent compared
to the dominant white chamber in the tri-cameral Parliament.
   The regional police commissioner for the Cape Town region, Maj.
Gen Philip Fourie, met today with a mixed-race lieutenant who has
created a furor by publicly accusing fellow policemen of brutality.
   Police spokesmen said the allegations would be investigated and
insisted that Rockman's career would not be affected.
   Rockman said he had been ordered to stop communicating with the
press. He said he planned to leave the police force soon to study
law.
   On Wednesday, Rockman told reporters he saw a police riot squad
whipping and beating schoolchildren and bystanders during an
incident Tuesday in Mitchell's Plain, the largest of Cape Town's
mixed-race townships.
   The policemen ``were just hitting people. They couldn't care if
they were innocent bystanders,'' Rockman said. ``It seemed to me
that they were enjoying themselves, feasting on the people.''
   In Pretoria, police banned a rally planned for tonight in an
Indian township to protest alleged police brutality.
   Also in Pretoria, the Canadian Embassy released a statement by
Canada's foreign minister, Joe Clark, decrying deaths and injuries
that resulted from ``a brutal and manifestly excessive police
response to protests.''
   De Klerk, expected to be elected next week for a five-year term
as president, has yet to issue any public statement about the Cape
Town violence.
   His National Party narrowly retained its outright majority in
Parliament's dominant white chamber, losing nearly a quarter of its
seats to far-right and opposition parties that oppose apartheid.

   Gamblers and guests safely evacuated a resort
hotel when a fire raced through a new casino wing under construction
and burned several dozen hotel rooms in an adjacent building.
   But within hours, guests in the Riviera Hotel were moved to
undamaged rooms, the existing casino reopened and only two minor
injuries were reported.
   ``The first thing we did was secure all of the money (in the
casino) and evacuate all the people,'' said hotel president Mark
Sterbens.
   ``Everything worked the way it was supposed to work,'' hotel
chairman Arthur Waltzman said of the Thursday morning fire.
   ``We went through some pretty dark smoke getting out of the
casino,'' said Dr. Paul Bender of Jefferson, Ind. ``The hotel people
should be given credit for getting people out in a non-panic way.''
   The blaze in the new wing licked up the exterior of the
nine-story original part of the hotel, breaking windows in 75 rooms.
Automatic sprinklers in the rooms quickly beat back the flames, but
the fire in the new casino wing took firefighters about two hours to
extinguish.
   Damage was estimated at $3.5 million.
   The sprinklers were installed in the early 1980s when tough new
state laws were enacted following blazes that killed 87 people at
the MGM Grand Hotel and eight people at the Las Vegas Hilton.
   ``This is a great example of the importance of sprinklers,'' said
Bob Leinbach, a Clark County Fire Department spokesman.
   Clark County Fire Department spokesman Bob Leinbach said the
blaze was touched off by welders working on the new wing.
   The fire also spread to the eaves of an existing casino area and
burned part of an outdoor sign on the casino. Embers from the blaze,
fanned by 25 mph wind, blew across the street and briefly set the
roof of a motel on fire.
   The existing casino reopened Thursday evening and a show with
singer Paul Anka went on an hour later in the hotel's showroom.
Hotel officials offered guests free tickets to the show and a free
prime rib buffet.
   Sterbens said the hotel's 2,200 rooms were sold out, but some
people with reservations had canceled, allowing hotel officials to
move guests from damaged rooms into other rooms.

   The United States, the Soviet Union and
their allies are moving toward their first exchange of military
doctrines and detailed information on armies and weapons, a senior
U.S. arms negotiator said today.
   John J. Maresca, the chief U.S. delegate to the 35-nation talks
on enhancing security in Europe, sounded a hopeful note, but
cautioned that the East and West are still far apart in a dispute
over whether to include naval and air forces in the negotiations.
   The participants at the talks include NATO and Warsaw Pact
nations and neutral European countries.
   ``I believe that these negotiations are now well positioned to
move forward. However, we must be realistic,'' Maresca told fellow
negotiatiors at the start of the third round of the negotiations.
   A copy of his speech was made available to The Associated Press.
   ``The common ground which has emerged over the first two rounds
can only lead to an early positive conclusion if proposals which are
unlikely to attract consensus are put aside. This will undoubtedly
be the most difficult task before us,'' he added.
   NATO and Warsaw Pact countries are holding separate talks in
Vienna on reducing conventional weapons. Both sets of talks are
scheduled to continue through Oct. 20.
   Maresca said an agreement in principle has been reached in some
areas at the 35-nation talks. One important agreement is on the
annual exchange of military information among East, West and neutral
nations on the world's most heavily armed continent.
   ``The principle of a regular exchange of information has now, I
believe, been broadly accepted in this forum,'' Maresca said of the
35-nation talks, which bring together the United States, Canada, the
Soviet Union and all European nations except Albania.
   Details on how these nations will set up a data bank and which
information they will share on troop deployments, weapons
procurements and a host of other military matters remain to be
worked out, Maresca noted.
   Neverthelesss, ``A breakthrough has been made with acceptance in
principle that there should be such an exchange,'' he said.
   ``This represents an important step forward which can only have a
positive effect on the range of arms control talks currently under
way,'' Maresca said.
   A major outstanding issue in the talks is the Soviet insistence
that naval and air forces be included in the talks.
   NATO insists they were never meant to be part of the negotiations
and would further complicate already complex talks. The West also
believes that land forces pose the greatest threat on the continent.

<HEAD>Letter By Marilyn Monroe Attracts Record Amount</HEAD>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A handwritten letter by Marilyn Monroe was sold
for $7,150, setting a record for an auction price for a letter by a
movie star, according to a specialist in autograph auctions.
   The auction Thursday broke the old record of $6,600 paid in
September 1987 for a handwritten letter by actress Greta Garbo, said
Herman Darvick, who stages autograph auctions six times a year.
   The record does not include one movie actor _ the one who became
president. A handwritten letter by Ronald Reagan praising Frank
Sinatra once sold for $12,500, but his White House connection made a
large difference, Darvick said.
   The Monroe letter, in an envelope postmarked Jan. 17, 1945, is
actually signed Norma Jeane, Monroe's given name. She was 18 when
she wrote it.
   Also during the sale, a black and white photograph from the 1952
motion picture ``Niagara,'' signed in red ink, ``To Jack-Love and
Kisses-Marilyn Monroe,'' sold for $2,750. Darvick said he did not
know who Jack was.
   Other highlights of the sale were $4,400 for a two-page letter
from Abigail Adams, the first first lady to live in the White House;
$6,050 for a photograph signed by all seven crew members of the
ill-fated Challenger space shuttle; $3,575 for a letter by Adolf
Hitler and $11,000 for a document signed by George Washington
ordering the execution of a spy.
   Darvick said the sale shows ``people will always be fascinated by
Marilyn Monroe.''
   The letter was written by Monroe while she was working at the
Radio Plane Co. in Burbank, Calif., as an inspector on the plant's
assembly line. She was transferred to the line apparently because
her typing speed was considered insufficient, and she indicated in
the letter she wanted to improve her secretarial skills.
   ``Thank you so much for sending the book of Business English, and
for the encyclopedia,'' she wrote. ``I didn't have an encyclopedia
and I really did need one so I am most grateful to you.''
   Darvick said the letter would not have fit the image of a ``dumb
blonde. Evidently she was bettering herself.''

<TEXT>
   About 100 people, mostly East Germans
frustrated with delays in a promised mass exodus from Hungary, fled
across the border to Austria during the night, a Red Cross official
said today.
   In Budapest, the Communist Party leader, Rezsoe Nyers, said today
that thousands of East Germans waiting in refugee camps to go to
West Germany would be able to leave ``in a short time.'' But he
would not say when. Pressure on Hungary from Warsaw Pact ally East
Germany has delayed the transfer.
   Also today, West German officials in East Berlin said all 116
East Germans who had holed up in the West German mission there had
left the facility.
   Eberhard Grashoff, a spokesman for the mission, said the East
Germans left the compound this morning after they were promised
``extensive legal counsel'' in their efforts to leave the country.
   The would-be emigres had been living in the mission for more than
a month, demanding West Germany's help in getting permission to
leave.
   West Germany's decision to harbor the East Germans, many of them
families with small children, had strained relations between Bonn
and the Communist leadership in East Berlin. More than 300 other
East Germans remain in West Germany's missions in Czechoslovakia,
Poland and Hungary.
   Red Cross officials in Austria said that besides East Germans,
today's new arrivals included Romanians, Czechoslovaks and one
Ghanaian, said Heinrich Unger, head of the Red Cross in Austria's
eastern Burgenland province.
   Austria has a policy of giving asylum to all political refugees.
   About 6,000 East Germans have fled to West Germany, taking
advantage of Hungary's decision in May to remove border
fortifications with Austria. Hungary has been seeking closer ties
with the West as it reforms its Communist political and economic
system.
   Another 6,000 East Germans, many of them people vacationing in
Hungary, flooded refugee camps in recent weeks to take advantage of
a one-time sanctioned migration apparently tacitly agreed to by
Hungary.
   The prospective exodus has worsened tensions between Hungary and
East Germany, which has spurned the liberal reforms embraced to
varying degrees in the Soviet Union, Poland and Hungary.
   Austrian volunteers have opened four reception centers along the
border for the East German arrivals. Unger said a fifth was
hurriedly set up in the changing rooms of a sports ground overnight,
after one group of 32 East Germans arrived at a crossing point near
the small town of Nikitsch.
   ``We don't know if we'll keep it open, whether this was a single
group or the start of a trend,'' he said. ``We can't just open up
another reception center every place the groups arrive.''

<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Some Cook County courtrooms will be opened for
trials at night in a move to alleviate jail overcrowding and a
soaring backlog of pending felony cases.
   Chief Circuit Court Judge Harry Comerford said Thursday that
plans are being developed to use five Cook County courtrooms at the
Criminal Court complex, especially for trials of defendants charged
with drug offenses and related crimes who have been unable to post
bond.
   In addition, Comerford said six divorce courtrooms in one court
building will be converted to felony trial courtrooms.
   Comerford said the measures should increase the capacity of the
county's criminal court system by about 30 percent, raising the
number of felony courtrooms from 39 to 50.
   ``When we have a crisis like the jail overcrowding and burgeoning
criminal court calls, we have to take dramatic steps,'' Comerford
said. ``This may be a temporary but necessary move because we have
to do something drastic to alleviate the problems.''
   The latest figures show the inmate population at Cook County Jail
at more than 7,000 for the first time, and that more than 900
inmates are without beds.
   In February, a federal judge fined the county $1,000 each day
that the jail population exceeds the number of available beds. The
judge made the order retroactive to December 1988.

   Under the proposed government of former Solidarity activist
Tadeusz Mazowiecki, the first non-Communist prime minister in the
Soviet bloc, the trade union would have 12 Cabinet posts and the
Communists would have five.
   The Solidarity-allied United Peasant and Democratic parties would
have four and two Cabinet-level posts, respectively.
   Committees of the Sejm, or lower house of the National Assembly,
began hearings on Mazowiecki's nominees today and planned to vote
Tuesday on Mazowiecki's proposed government.
   No official list of nominees was released. The party newspaper
Trybuna Ludu, the pro-Solidarity newspaper Gazeta Wyborcza and the
state PAP news agency all published lists today and Thursday that
varied in some details. Government and parliamentary sources also
provided slightly varying accounts.
   But the general shape of the proposed government was known and
appeared likely to win approval in parliament, which is dominated by
a Solidarity-led coalition.
   According to an unofficial list of nominees compiled from
government and parliamentary sources, Solidarity will run six
government departments, or ministries. It also is to have at least
six Cabinent-level posts that are essentially ministers without
portfolio.
   One woman was among the 20 nominees: proposed Culture Minister
Izabella Cywinska, a prominent theater director.
   The prestigious post of foreign minister was denied the Communist
Party and given to Krzysztof Skubiszewski, a lawyer close to the
Roman Catholic Church.
   The relatively unknown Skubiszewski, an adviser to Polish church
leader Cardinal Jozef Glemp and specialist in German-Polish
relations, was considered a compromise in the fight between
Solidarity and the Communists for the post.
   The pro-Solidarity newspaper Gazeta Wyborcza called Skubiszewski
``neutral'' because he is not active in Solidarity, although
Mazowiecki was overheard by reporters telling lawmakers the nominee
had been a Solidarity member.
   The Communist Party, which had directed the government since
1948, will have just four ministries plus one member without
portfolio in the Cabinet, for a total of five posts on the Cabinet
council.
   However, it will retain control of the interior and defense
ministries, which run the military and security police.
   The United Peasant Party is to have four ministries and the
Democratic Party is to have two, according to the unofficial list.
Both parties are allied with Solidarity.
   
   Mazowiecki nominated Solidarity members to head the ministries of
finance, labor, planning, industry, building and housing, education
and culture.
   
   Solidarity also would receive the key chairmanship of the
committee that supervises state television and radio, which the
Communist Party has controlled since World War II.
   Besides the interior and defense ministries, the Communists would
have the transporation and foreign trade ministries and a secretary
of state post.
   The Peasant Party would have agriculture, health, environment and
justice ministries. The Democratic Party would head the technology
and domestic trade offices.
   Several nominees have been victims of government repression.
   Jacek Kuron, the Solidarity adviser nominated for labor minister,
has spent more than nine years in prison. Henryk Samsonowicz,
nominated as education minister, was dismissed as rector of Warsaw
University in 1982 because of his sympathy for Solidarity.
   At a news conference after the Solidarity caucus, Bronislaw
Geremek, the union's parliamentary leader, said it was ``very
favorable'' that Communists would not be in charge of most economic
ministries.
   He conceded there were disputes over some choices, however.
   Members of the independent farmers' union Rural Solidarity
objected to the strong role for the Peasant Party, previously allied
with the Communists. Rural Solidarity, which like Solidarity was
legalized in April after a seven-year ban, contends it is the
authentic voice of the countryside.
   Rural Solidarity activists ran for the parliament as part of
Solidarity's successful campaign and are an important faction in the
caucus.
   Jozef Slisz, the Rural Solidarity leader, was quoted by the
Solidarity newspaper Gazeta Wyborcza on Thursday as saying his group
was offered only the Environment Ministry and ``it does not suit
us.''
   ``The Peasant Party, which has no say in the countryside, got
more, and we, who are the main force, got nothing,'' he said.
   Mazowiecki was named prime minister on Aug. 24 after the
Communists, weakened by elections in June, failed to form a
government. The elections were among reforms agreed on this spring
between Solidarity and the government after widespread strikes last
year.
   The new government will face an economy wracked by inflation, low
productivity and a foreign debt of $39 billion.

<HEAD>Auditors: Exchanges Should Decide Fate of Open Outcry</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN M. DOYLE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Recordkeeping methods that would allow
investigators to reconstruct trades on the nation's commodities
exchanges are ``fundamentally inadequate,'' a Senate committee was
told today.
   But officials of the General Accounting Office said
computerization doesn't necessarily spell the end of the traditional
hurly-burly method of trading by shouts and hand signals known as
open outcry.
   ``I think that's a question the exchanges themselves need to
answer,'' said Richard L. Fogel, an assistant comptroller general
with the GAO, the auditing arm of Congress.
   ``I don't personally believe that the government should dictate
how the exchanges want to trade,'' he added.
   Fogel testified to the Senate Agriculture Committee about a study
of the methods used by exchanges to track trading and keep futures
traders honest.
   The study found exchange systems for tracking a given trade,
known as an ``audit trail,'' lacking because so much of the
recordkeeping is left to the traders and brokers themselves.
   Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., the committee chairman, asked Fogel if
he believed the ``current audit trail systems in place at the major
U.S. exchanges are fundamentally inadequate to police the trading
floors against abuses?''
   ``I think it is. Yes,'' said Fogel, noting that there is no
guarantee that information about the timing of when an order gets to
a broker and when the order is executed by the broker.
   Forty-five traders at the Chicago Board of Trade and the Chicago
Mercantile Exchange were charged Aug. 2 with bilking profits from
hundreds of customers through a series of illegal activities,
including falsified trading records.
   ``While detecting every abuse may never be possible, most of the
types of abuses alleged in the Justice Department indictments could
also have been detected and documented with independent, precise and
complete timing of trades,'' the GAO report said.
   The two futures exchanges, the largest in the world, have been
criticized for not keeping a closer watch on traders, while the
Commodity Futures Trading Commission, which oversees the futures
markets, has been accused of doing so with too light a touch.
   The CFTC is up for reauthorization this fall and a bill passed by
the House would require exchanges to reconstruct a trade to within
one minute of its occurence, no later than one year after the bill
becomes law.
   Audit trails accurate to the nearest 30 seconds would be required
within three years of the bill's enactment.
   Within weeks of the indictments, the two Chicago exchanges
announced they were developing hand-held computer terminals to
record floor trading.
   But the GAO study said the CFTC has ``not been actively involved
in conducting or setting guidelines for technical assessments of
these systems' capabilities to control trading abuses and automation
risks.''
   The GAO also said the CFTC lacks ``the necessary technical
resources'' to keep tabs on the exchanges' developing technology.

   Suspected smuggling coordinators for Colombia's
Medellin cocaine cartel have been charged with funneling the drug
through the Bahamas and the Florida Keys in exchange for air drops
of ice chests stuffed with cash.
   A federal indictment disclosed Thursday charges two members of
the cartel-leading Ochoa clan and 10 others helped smuggle almost 4
tons of cocaine from Colombia into the United States.
   Mauricio Ochoa, 32, is being held without bond in the
Metropolitan Correctional Center south of here. He has been in
custody since June 20.
   The second man, Fabio Enrique Ochoa, disappeared from his
suburban Miami condominium shortly after Mauricio Ochoa's arrest,
and authorities believe he fled to Colombia.
   The pair have been described by federal authorities as principal
smugglers for the Medellin cartel.
   A man named Fabio Ochoa is on a Justice Department list of 12 top
drug figures sought in the United States. But prosecutors are
uncertain if the Fabio Ochoa named in the indictment is the same
person, and also are not sure what the Ochoas' relationship to
cartel patriarch Fabio Ochoa Restrepo is.
   The indictment was unsealed after the arrest of a couple accused
of driving drug-bearing speedboats from the Bahamian island of Abaco
to Key Largo, prosecutors said.
   Once cocaine loads were safely ashore, the indictment said, a
plane dropped the smugglers' payment of $200,000 to $400,000, in
cash packed in plastic foam chests, at sea to be picked up by boat.
   The final load of $400,000 burst when it hit the water,
scattering loose bills across the water in July 1987 after the ring
had handled 7,700 pounds of cocaine, an affidavit said.

<HEAD>Democrats Urge Boost in Number of East European Immigrants</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LAWRENCE L. KNUTSON</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   House Democrats are urging President Bush to
boost by 100,000 the number of East European refugees allowed to
enter the United States over the next 12 months.
   A letter to Bush signed by House Majority Leader Richard
Gephardt, D-Mo., and Rep. William O. Lipinski, D-Ill., said that
while the Iron Curtain has begun to open to permit people to leave,
an American bureaucratic curtain keeps most of them from coming to
the United States.
   ``Unfortunately, the gates to America for those who have suffered
under communist regimes are closed,'' Gephardt and Lipinski said.
   While immigration policy favoring family reunification and job
skills is generally correct, ``it has prevented American policy from
reacting to the increase in emigration from Eastern Europe,'' they
said in the letter released Thursday.
   Restrictions on emigration are being eased by the Soviet Union
and other Eastern European nations, but immigration to the United
States from the region decreased from 27,480 in 1982 to 12,838 in
1987, they said.
   The Bush administration has resisted increasing refugee totals,
with some officials contending that the United States can no longer
accommodate the large numbers of people wishing to immigrate. The
1989 immigration ceiling for the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe is
31,500 and has been filled.
   ``Ongoing suppression and persecution in these communist
countries justifies America's acceptance of Eastern European and
Soviet refugees,'' the letter said.
   Ronald H. Brown, chairman of the Democratic National Committee,
endorsed the move to increase the flow of refugees from Eastern
Europe to the United States.
   ``The president ought to use his authority to help the thousands
of people that have already fled communist regimes in the Soviet
Union and Eastern Europe,'' Brown said in a statement. ``His
leadership on this initiative is critical.''

   Premature babies breathe easier to
the disco beat, a Dutch doctor claimed Friday.
   Preliminary results of an experiment at Amsterdam's University
Hospital indicate that infants with respiratory problems need less
oxygen in their incubators if soft disco music is played, said Dr.
Heleen Loggers, the pediatrician.
   Most premature babies suffer respiratory problems. Since early
this year, about 24 such infants have had 90 minutes a day of disco
music piped into their incubators, Ms. Loggers told The Associated
Press.
   ``We sought a method to lower the oxygen content of the
incubators because oxygen can damage the babies' corneas,'' said Ms.
Logger. ``When we played music in the incubator, more or less as a
joke, we found that the children needed about 10 to 20 percent less
additional oxygen.''
   At first, the children were treated to Perry Como.
   ``But when we changed that to disco music, the breathing rhythm
also improved,'' said Ms. Logger. ``The beat seems to pull them
along.''
   She stressed that the findings were preliminary. Research is to
continue for at least a year, she said.

   Defense Secretary Fidel Ramos' streak
of aviation bad luck continued Friday when a helicopter sent to
fetch him developed engine trouble and made an emergency landing
southeast of Manila.
   An air force spokesman said the helicopter made the unscheduled
landing after the pilot reported unusual vibrations en route to
Laguna province, where Ramos was visiting.
   Ramos' bad luck with aircraft has become almost legendary in the
Philippines.
   In December 1988, his Fokker plane caught fire and burned after
landing on Samar island. There were no injuries.
   A helicopter sent to pick up Ramos the next day crashed into the
sea. The four crewmen were rescued.
   In February, Ramos was stranded for hours at the U.S.-run Subic
Bay naval base after his pilot noticed engine trouble beforing
taking off.
   Two helicopters sent to pick up Ramos also developed engine
trouble en route to Subic and were forced to turn back to Manila.
   In March, Ramos spent his 61st birthday stranded in a rural
military camp near Tacloban after the rotar blade on one of his
helicopters stalled. The aircraft plunged 800 feet before the pilot
regained control.

<TEXT>
   A tide of refugees is forcing this insular
country to cope with a backlash of racism as it heads toward a
national election. It is one of the hottest issues of the campaign,
but many candidates are reluctant to touch it.
   Anti-immigrant sentiment is partly credited for the rising
popularity of right-wing leader Carl I. Hagen, who has emerged as
the main challenger to Prime Minister Gro Harlem Brundtland and her
Labor Party in the Sept. 11 vote.
   Polls predict his Party of Progress may jump from two seats in
the 157-seat Parliament to as many as 32 in the new 165-seat
legislature.
   Hagen says Norway cannot afford to support refugees, whose number
swelled 10-fold in two years, peaking in 1987 at about 8,600.
   In recent months, immigration centers and homes have been bombed
or shot at. Two Pakistani immigrants were stabbed to death in July.
   Those wanting to keep out refugees claim they burden the social
welfare system, take jobs, bring more crime and drugs, have
extremely large families and ``steal'' Norwegian women.
   At the opposite pole are Norwegians who have disrupted
anti-immigration rallies and sheltered refugees facing deportion.
   The dispute has soured the taste of Western liberty for some
newcomers.

   WILKES-BARRE, Pa. (AP) _ A jury today convicted a couple of
third-degree murder in the starvation of their 14-year-old son while
the family went without food for six weeks though they had nearly
$4,000 they were saving for their church.
   The jury deliberated a half-hour today after considering the case
for little more than an hour Thursday night.
   The defendants, Larry and Leona Cottam, held hands but displayed
no emotion when jury foreman Maria Uitti read the verdict.
   Jurors also convicted the couple of two counts each of recklessly
endangering another person and endangering the welfare of children.
Son Eric died Jan. 3 after the family had not eaten since Nov. 22;
Cottam summoned police the day after the boy died.
   They could be sentenced to up to 28 years in prison on all
counts. No sentencing date was set.
   The family fasted despite $3,775 in savings set aside as a tithe,
or offering, for God. Cottam, a former Seventh-day Adventist
minister, believed spending the money would have amounted to
stealing.
   Their other child, 12-year-old Laura, has recovered from
malnourishment caused during the fast and has been placed in foster
care.
   In his instructions to the jury, Luzerne County Common Pleas
Court Judge Gifford S. Cappellini said malice in the case had a
legal definition, including a combination of a hardness of heart and
conscious disregard to a high risk of death or serious bodily harm.
   The jurors also could have convicted the couple of voluntary or
involuntary manslaughter if they found them innocent of third-degree
murder, which requires a finding of malice.
   Defense attorney Al Flora Jr., in his closing argument Thursday
afternoon, said Cottam, 39, and Mrs. Cottam, 38, feared losing their
children if they went to authorities for help during the six weeks
the family went without food.
   Flora said the Cottams mistakenly believed God would intervene to
save them during their fast, meaning they weren't legally
responsible for Eric's death.
   He said the couple distrusted society after Laura and Eric told
them they were sexually abused by several people including their
paternal grandparents _ who denied the charges _ as well as a
Seventh-day Adventist leader and officials at a church school near
their home in Nuangola in northeastern Pennsylvania.
   But prosecutor Thomas Marsilio, Luzerne County assistant district
attorney, said the Cottams, not society, were to blame for their
son's death.
   ``The parents watched him die, and they didn't lift a finger to
prevent his death,'' Marsilio said in his summation to the jury
before a packed courtroom.
   A Phladelphia jury heard testimony during the nine-day trial
after Cappellini decided pretrial publicity made picking an
impartial jury in Luzerne County impossible.
   Flora said the couple would appeal. They remained free on bond
today pending the appeal.

<HEAD>Ethnic Poles Want Autonomy Within Lithuania</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CAREY GOLDBERG</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   As if the Soviet Union didn't have enough trouble
with republics demanding autonomy or outright sovereignty, now
40,000 ethnic Poles want their own piece of Lithuania.
   The demand by the Salcininkai district has put Lithuanian
officials, who complain of Moscow's authority over their Baltic
republic, in the uneasy position of hearing the same arguments about
their authority over Salcininkai.
   ``This is a cry from the soul, the desire of the people to say
what hurts,'' L. Yankelevich, chairman of the Salcininkai regional
council, told the official Tass news agency.
   Tass quoted V. Belskaya, a kindergarten teacher, as saying at the
council session that made the demand: ``We see autonomy as the only
way today to protect our people's interests.''
   The council voted 50-14 to declare the region autonomous and
residents carrying Polish flags rallied outside the council
building, the news agency reported Thursday. It did not say when the
vote was taken.
   Salcininkai, 30 miles south of the Lituanian capital of Vilnius
and near the border with Byelorussia, is a traditionally Polish
district, Tass reported. It said the population now is 81 percent
ethnic Polish and only 7 percent Lithuanian, while the republic as a
whole is 80 percent Lithuanian.
   Ethnic Poles fear the campaign for Lithuanian sovereignty
organized by the political movement Sajudis, which so far has
produced a law making Lithuanian the official language.
   A major complaint in Salcininkai is that the law requires
interoffice communications to be in Lithuanian by January 1991, even
if nearly all employees are Polish.
   Members of the district council complained of a case in which an
accountant four years short of retirement would have to leave early
because he could not learn Lithuanian well enough in the time
allowed, Tass said.
   Lithuania's language law took effect in February, before
resistance stiffened among ethnic minorities in small Soviet
republics that seek greater autonomy.
   The Soviet Union encompasses 100 ethnic groups, and animosities
exist between many of them.
   In the Moldavian republic on the Romanian border, Ukrainians,
Russians and other non-Moldavians are in the third week of a strike
to protest a law making Moldavian the official language. Ethnic
Moldavians make up 64 percent of that republic's 4.2 million people.
   A Christian Turkish people known as the Gagauz, a small minority
in Moldavia, are demanding an autonomous district.
   Many republics have passed laws making the tongue of the dominant
ethnic group the official language, and more are being prepared.
   In Salcininkai, the people appear inspired by Kremlin reaction to
the Baltic campaign for sovereignty rather than Poland's experiment
with democracy.
   Some banners carried by the crowd at the council building said
``Down with the Sajudis Dictatorship,'' and others expressed support
for a tough Kremlin statement that separatists were leading the
Baltics into an abyss, Tass reported.
   It said President Vytautus Astrauskas of Lithuania and S.
Gedraitus, a secretary of the republic's Communist Party, attended
council meetings and urged patience.
   Tass quoted Astrauskas as saying the council decision did not
make autonomy a fact and declaring: ``Earlier we worked together in
friendship and no problems arose. That's the way we'll search for a
solution.''

<HEAD>Hazelwood Claims Immunity From State Charges</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ANCHORAGE, Alaska (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   When Capt. Joseph Hazelwood reported the
Exxon Valdez was spilling crude oil into Prince William Sound, he
automatically won immunity from prosecution on any charges from the
spill, his lawyer claims.
   Hazelwood has been charged with three misdemeanors and three
felonies in the spill, but court documents filed in his defense
claim a little-known state regulation protects him from prosecution.
   The regulation was designed to encourage reporting of spilled oil
or other hazardous substances. The immunity clause provides that
information obtained in such a report may not be used in prosecuting
the people who make the notification.
   Prosecutors have until later today to file answers to the
arguments raised in the memo, which was filed last month.
   Hazelwood's trial is tentatively set for Oct. 30.
   Early March 24, Hazelwood reported to the Coast Guard that his
vessel was impaled on Bligh Reef and spilling its toxic cargo into
the Sound.
   The promise of some kind of immunity to ``any natural person
providing this notification or report'' clearly is stated in the
Alaska Administrative Code, but it will be up to Superior Court
Judge Beverly Cutler to decide how far the protection extends.
   Dick Madson, one of Hazelwood's attorneys, said the immunity
clause ``prohibits prosecution for anything stated by the reporter,
as well as any information which is derived from investigating the
report.''
   If Cutler rules for Hazelwood, it could eliminate all the
evidence gathered by the state to support its charges against the
former skipper.
   Madson argued that a broad interpretation of the immunity clause
is necessary because people who spill oil are legally required to
report the incident _ violating their right to protection from
self-incrimination.
   ``The immunity offered is to ensure that if one obeys the law by
reporting a discharge, he cannot be criminally prosecuted for the
discharge itself,'' Madson argued.
   Madson also said the state improperly ignored laws specifically
designed to deal with oil spills and charged Hazelwood instead with
catchall criminal mischief felonies that carry stiffer penalties.
   The 49-page memo outlining Hazelwood's defense also argues that
all charges based on alleged recklessness _ the three felonies and
one of the misdemeanors _ should be dismissed because the state has
its facts wrong.
   Madson said the allegations of recklessness are based on two
accusations, both untrue. First, the state claims Hazelwood turned
over control of the ship to a third mate without a required Coast
Guard license endorsement to pilot a tanker in the waters near Bligh
Reef.
   Madson said the Coast Guard waived that rule before March 24, and
no special license endorsement was necessary. However, information
by the Coast Guard appares to dispute Madson's assertion.
   The second allegation of recklessness is based on charges that
Hazelwood tried to rock the 987-foot tanker off the reef after it
was grounded. If true, the action would have risked sinking the
damaged ship and spilling the rest of the cargo.
   Madson said automatic logs of the ship's engine show it was not
put into reverse at any time after the grounding. The lawyer said
that proves Hazelwood did not try to rock the ship off. He did not
mention recorded conversations between Hazelwood and the Coast Guard
in which he says he is trying to get the ship off the reef.

<HEAD>Violence Fears Force England to Cancel Holland Match</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   England on Friday canceled a soccer match against
Holland because of fears there would be an outbreak of fan violence.
   The Football Association said its executive committee voted
unanimously to accept the British government's plea to call off the
Dec. 13 match in Rotterdam.
   On Wednesday night, more than 100 English fans attending an
England-Sweden World Cup qualifying match were arrested after a
rampage through central Stockholm.
   This prompted Sports Minister Colin Moynihan to write to the
association Thursday seeking cancellation of the Dutch game ``in the
interests of the future of English football and of the country as a
whole.''
   Dutch soccer fans also have a reputation for violence and
Moynihan's letter warned that there was no way to stop English
hooligans from reaching Rotterdam.
   England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland play as separate
nationalities and there is no team for Britain.
   Hooliganism has become the scourge of England's most popular
sport, bringing denunciations from Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher
and government promises to explore ways of preventing potential
hooligans from following the England team abroad.
   In 1985, 39 people died when Liverpool supporters stampeded at a
match in Belgium. Last year England canceled a match in Italy for
fear of violence.

<HEAD>Senate Makes Down Payment on Drug War as Lawmakers Urge Fast Action</HEAD>

<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Congressional leaders are calling for
accelerated action on the Bush administration's anti-drug bill, with
the Senate already approving a $45 million down payment from
lawmakers' own budgets to finance the fight.
   ``Let's begin to break the habit and begin to help those who need
help,'' Sen. Pete Wilson, R-Calif., said as the Senate voted 83-8 on
Thursday to cut its own mass mailing funds by $45 million and devote
the money to drug programs.
   It was the first move to funnel money into the war on drugs since
President Bush on Tuesday night unveiled his $7.9 billion strategy
that relies partly on such transfers to pay the bill.
   ``Congress seems to be getting into the swim of things,'' White
House Chief of Staff John Sununu told reporters traveling with Bush
to New Orleans for speeches urging support for his drug program.
   He said the Senate ``ought to be complimented'' for approving the
cut in mass mailing funds.
   The amendment was attached to a $2 billion legislative expenses
bill that must be reconciled with a differing House-passed version.
   Asked whether the administration would be amenable to Congress
voting more money for the drug war than Bush proposed, Sununu said
that would be difficult within the boundaries of a budget compromise.
   However, he said, ``if they can find an appropriate readjustment
of priorities'' within the budget compromise, ``we're not going to
be closeminded if there are good suggestions that come from
Congress.''
   Meanwhile Thursday, national drug policy director William J.
Bennett acknowledged under questioning at a Senate Judiciary
Committee hearing that Bush's drug-fighting blueprint envisions
state and local governments paying substantial amounts in addition
to what would be contributed at the federal level.
   Bennett conceded that a 40 percent increase in prison capacity
called for under the plan could cost the states $5 billion to $10
billion, although he said that was the roughest of estimates and
subject to revision. He said the federal government should not play
the role of a ``sugar daddy'' in supplying funds to the states.
   ``To succeed, we need the support and involvement of every level
of government and every private citizen,'' Bennett said.
   Calls proliferated Thursday for speeded-up approval of the
administration drug bill, which is expected to reach the hopper in a
week or two.
   Senate Minority Leader Bob Dole, R-Kan., and House GOP Leader Bob
Michel, R-Ill., emerged from a White House meeting and urged
extraordinary steps to ``emphasize the sense of urgency needed to
bring about congressional action.''
   Senate Judiciary Chairman Joseph B. Biden Jr., D-Del., called for
talks with the White House to set ground rules that would put the
bill ``on, to use Washington jargon, a fast track.''
   ``Whether we accept this strategy in total or whether we add to
this strategy, it's all going to have to happen in the next few
weeks,'' Biden said.
   However, Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell, D-Maine, and
House Speaker Thomas Foley, D-Wash., have not said thus far whether
they believe action on the bill should be accelerated.
   Foley spokesman Jeff Biggs said the issue should be handled ``as
expeditiously as possible.'' Mitchell said through his office that
speeded-up action was ``under consideration.''
   The Bush blueprint would be financed partly by cutting $716
million in existing programs. Most of the money already is
authorized for fighting drugs, but about $2 billion would represent
fresh funds.
   Aid to Andean nations in fighting the cocaine cartel,
interdiction of drug shipments from South America, tougher treatment
for offenders and new prisons are part of the plan, along with more
education and treatment.
   Democrats called for new revenue to finance the drug war when
Bush announced his plan Tuesday, but party leaders later said there
was no chance for approval in the face of the president's continuing
opposition to a tax increase.
   Bennett's initial tour of committees Thursday was smooth for the
most part, with Democrats quick to praise the Bush blueprint.
   Rep. William J. Hughes, D-N.J., chairman of the House Judiciary
Committee's subcommittee on crime, told Bennett the plan was off to
``a very, very good start.''
   But his warm reception in the Senate was broken when Sen. Edward
M. Kennedy, D-Mass., questioned him about the administration's
continued refusal to ban American-made assault rifles.
   The administration barred import of a number of the
military-style weapons earlier this year, but it has not moved
against domestic weapons.
   Kennedy said recent seizures in Colombian drug raids show ``half
of the guns that are used locally are being manufactured here in the
United States of America.''
   Bennett said he had received similar reports about the arsenals
of Colombian drug lords. ``It is a matter of concern to us,'' he
said, but added he would not recommend a ban on the manufacture and
production and distribution of the weapons in the United States.
   Meanwhile, an ABC-Washington Post poll released Thursday said
wide majorities are willing to put up with increased searches of
homes, cars, school lockers and luggage at the airport to look for
illegal drugs.
   The poll, conducted by phone Wednesday, asked the opinions of 764
adults selected at random. The poll said 88 percent favor more
luggage searches at airports, 87 percent are for searching school
lockers, 87 percent support random police searches of cars and 52
percent say police should be able to search homes without a court
order.
   The poll's margin of error is plus or minus four percentage
points.

   A former PTL budget director testified
today that ministry founder Jim Bakker asked him to manipulate
figures until he could show that one type of ``partnership'' in PTL
could be worth $1 million to a family.
   Prosecutors say Bakker, 49, used nearly $4 million in ministry
funds obtained from the sale of partnerships in the ministry's hotel
to bankroll his extravagant lifestyle. Partners, who gave at least
$1,000, were told they were guaranteed a certain number of nights
per year in the hotel, at the ministry's Heritage USA retreat near
Fort Mill, S.C.
   Former PTL budget director Mark Burgund testified today that in
1985 Bakker asked him to determine how to show that one partnership
program, the ``Silver 7,000'' program, would be worth more than $1
million. Those partnerships cost up to $3,000.
   ``Jim Bakker asked me to make up a chart showing the value of the
Silver 7,000 membership over a period of time,'' Burgund said. When
he told Bakker it would be worth $84,000 over 30 years for a family
of four, Bakker told him to make it for a family of five. ``Figure
it out to make it worth $1 million,'' Burgund quoted Bakker as
saying.
   Burgund testified he sent a series of memos to Bakker showing
that to get $1 million of use out of a partnership, a family of five
would have to go to PTL once a year for a week-long free stay for 50
years and would have to use every facility at Heritage USA, even
facilities not yet constructed, such as a bowling alley.
   Bakker then used those figures in selling the partnerships,
Burgund said.
   But prosecutor Deborah Smith said even Burglund's figures were
inflated, saying a family of five would actually have to stay at the
resort far longer than five days a year for them to get $1 million
worth of services from a partnership.
   On Thursday, five so-called PTL lifetime partners testified that
they paid PTL for lodging at Heritage USA, but then were told there
were no vacancies when they tried to use the hotel.
   ``There were more people than there was room,'' said Lamar
Kerstetter, a retired coal miner from Shamokin, Pa., who suffers
from black lung disease and cancer and lives on disability insurance.
   Bakker's lawyers asked the 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in
Richmond, Va., on Thursday to halt the fraud and conspiracy trial,
pending an appeal of U.S. District Judge Robert Potter's refusal to
dismiss the charges against Bakker.
   Lawyers Harold Bender and George T. Davis on Wednesday asked
Potter to throw out the charges against Bakker, citing possible
grand jury misconduct.
   Defense attorneys claim Jessica Hahn told a Charlotte radio
station that a grand jurors approached her in a courthouse restroom
and asked for her autograph during a break in her testimony in
September 1987.
   Bakker's attorneys said the grand jurors violated their oath of
impartiality, and thus tainted the process leading to Bakker's
indictment.
   Bakker unveiled the lifetime partnerships program in early 1984,
telling donors he would offer 25,000 partnerships in the 504-room
Heritage Grand Hotel, then under construction. Only half the hotel
rooms were available for partners.
   Assistant U.S. Attorney Jerry Miller asked Kerstetter what he
expected to get for $1,000 he paid for a partnership in March 1987,
the same month Bakker resigned from PTL after disclosure of his
sexual encounter with Ms. Hahn.
   ``My four days and three nights,'' Kerstetter responded. ``I was
buying a product. I was buying lodging and use of the park.''
   Thursday was the first full day of testimony after the trial
resumed following Bakker's breakdown and commitment to a federal
prison for psychiatric evaluation last week.
   Lila Angel, 89, of Atlantic Beach, Fla., and her daughter, Dana
Angel, testified that they split the cost of a $1,000 partnership,
putting the purchase on their Visa cards. Both women are retired and
live on Social Security.
   Lila Angel testified that she expected a return for her money.
``I worked until I was 77, and I save my pennies. I still do. That
$500 was quite a bit of money for me,'' she said.
   Defense attorneys had said in opening arguments that money given
to the ministry was in the form of donations, not meant as money
paid for a product.
   William Maybrey, the general manager of Heritage Grand Hotel from
April 1984 to December 1985, testified that an Oct. 14, 1985, memo
disclosed 63,512 lifetime partnerships had been sold.
   Asked by prosecutors whether 63,512 partners could be
accommodated at the hotel, Mabrey replied: ``It would be impossible
to do.''
   Prosecutors also produced a series of witnesses Thursday
documenting purchases of luxury cars and a corporate jet by PTL or
Bakker, and PTL's 1984 charter of a corporate jet at a cost of
$100,000.
   Thursday morning, Bakker's wife, Tammy, criticized U.S. marshals'
treatment of her husband while he was in their custody and read a
phone number for the U.S. Justice Department in Washington.
   She then urged people to call to complain, ``because the next
person that's treated this way could be your husband or your
minister or someone that you love.''
   Three special telephone lines were set up at the Justice
Department, and department spokesman Joe Krovisky said the operators
were getting ``a continuous stream'' of calls from people protesting
the prosecution of the former PTL leader.

<HEAD>British Soldier's Wife Killed in Attack Claimed by IRA</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DORTMUND, West Germany (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Irish Republican Army said
Friday it shot to death the West German wife of a British soldier in
the mistaken belief she was a member of the British army.
   Police said the 26-year-old woman, identified as Heidi Hazell,
was shot more than a dozen times with a Kalashnikov automatic rifle
Thursday as she sat in the family car in a military housing area
just outside Dortmund.
   The attack was the second at a British military installation in
West Germany in a less than a week. More than 66,000 British
soldiers and their dependents are stationed in West Germany.
   In a statement released in Dublin, Ireland, the IRA said: ``An
IRA Active Service Unit carried out last night's shooting in West
Germany. The woman killed was believed to have been a member of the
British Crown Forces garrisoned in Dortmund. It has now emerged that
she was the German wife of a British Army staff sergeant.
   ``As we intend continuing our campaign until the British Army
withdraws from Ireland, the outcome of last night's attack
reinforces a warning we gave on Aug. 2, 1988, for civilians to stay
well clear of British military personnel. This warning applies to
the use of vehicles personally belonging to British soldiers and all
modes of military transport.''
   The mainly Catholic IRA is fighting to drive the British out of
Northern Ireland. Last week, it claimed responsibility for an attack
near Muenster in which two British soldiers were seriously wounded.
   West German authorities warned West Germans to be on alert for
possible IRA attacks in the country, saying they also could be the
victims. It was the first such warning to West German citizens about
the IRA.
   Federal police in Wiesbaden also asked citizens to help
authorities in their search for the IRA gunmen.
   The police statement said West Germans living in the area where
British forces are concentrated should be on alert for English
speakers claiming to be tourists and renting apartments and cars.
   Hans-Juergen Foerster, spokesman for the federal prosecutor's
office in Karlsruhe, said the gunman fired more than a dozen shots
from a Kalashnikov automatic rifle at Mrs. Hazell. The car was
parked and had British plates.
   Foerster said the killer fled in a car after the shooting. He
wore British military battle fatigues and ``had at least one
accomplice'' who was in the car, Foerster said.
   In a telephone interview with The Associated Press, Foerster said
a Kalashnikov was also used in the shooting of two British soldiers
one week ago near Muenster.
   ``We are checking to determine if it was the same weapon as the
one used in Muenster, although it's unlikely'' Foerster said.

<HEAD>Vatican Source Says Gorbachev Wants to Meet With Pope</HEAD>
<HEAD>By VICTOR L. SIMPSON</HEAD>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>VATICAN CITY (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev has written
to Pope John Paul II to arrange a historic meeting between the two
men and discuss troubled Vatican-Soviet relations, a senior Vatican
official said Friday.
   In Moscow, Soviet sources said Gorbachev is expected to visit
Italy beginning Nov. 25. Italian officials have indicated Gorbachev
may tour several cities.
   A meeting between Gorbachev and Polish-born John Paul has been
viewed as likely during the Soviet leader's stop in Italy but there
has been no confirmation by either side.
   Such a meeting would be of historic proportions, the first
between the leader of the world's 850 million Roman Catholics and
the head of a Soviet party that disparages religion.
   John Paul, speaking to reporters earlier this year, said he would
be willing to receive the Soviet president.
   The Vatican official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said
Gorbachev referred to a possible meeting in a letter delivered to
the pope last month by Yuri Karlov, an aide to Soviet Foreign
Minister Eduard Shevardnadze.
   ``The letter said in effect `let's talk business''' said the
Vatican official.
   The letter was in response to one written by the pope to
Gorbachev and carried to Moscow in June 1988 by Cardinal Agostino
Casaroli, the Vatican's secretary of state, the official said.
   Casaroli led a delegation of top Roman Catholic officials to
Moscow for a celebration of the Russian Orthodox Church. The visit
signaled an improvement in historically icy Vatican-Soviet relations.
   Further progress has been made this year, capped by the Vatican
appointment of a bishop in the Soviet republic of Byelorussia, the
first bishop there since the aftermath of the Russian Revolution.
   In August, John Paul held long talks with Karlov when the Soviet
envoy met with him at his Castel Gandolo vacation retreat south of
Rome. At that time, Vatican spokesman Joaquin Navarro said the two
discussed ``issues of common interest, such as religious freedom and
peace in the world, with particular reference to the Middle East.''
   Chief topics for a Gorbachev-pope meeting, the Vatican official
said, would be the Baltic states of Latvia and Lithuania, where
there are large numbers of Roman Catholics, and the status of the
Ukrainian Catholic Church, which is a major stumbling block to
improved Vatican-Moscow ties.
   The Vatican does not recognize the annexation of Lithuania by the
Soviet Union in 1940, and a Lithuanian exile mission is accredited
to the Holy See.
   The Ukrainian Catholic Church was forcibly merged with the
Russian Orthodox Church under Soviet dictator Josef Stalin in 1946.
But there is a strong underground Ukrainian church and Ukrainian
faithful have been carrying out public protests seeking official
recognition of their church.
   The pope also has expressed a desire to visit the Soviet Union
provided he could meet with his flock throughout the country. But
Vatican officials said such a trip is not expected in the immediate
future.

<TEXT>
   Three judges were being investigated
today on charges that they acted illegally when they ordered a drug
dealer back to jail, officials said.
   Also today, the army said it had arrested a pilot who worked for
Pablo Escobar, the alleged leader of the Medellin cocaine cartel who
is wanted in the United States and who is now in hiding.
   Officials in the attorney general's office, speaking on condition
of anonymity, showed reporters documents charging that three appeals
court judges in Pereira western Colombia erred Sept. 1 when they
revoked the parole of Carlos Fernando Castrillon.
   Castrillon had been convicted of drug charges and sentenced to a
year in jail. A lower court judge, following a Colombian law that
allows immediate parole in sentences of less than three years,
released Castrillon.
   The appeals court ordered Castrillon to return to jail but had no
legal basis for doing so, the attorney general said. Castrillon
remains free.
   A communique from the 4th Army Brigade in Medellin, said to be
the world's No. 1 cocaine center, said it arrested Nicolas Gonzalez
Cardona. It described him as ``a pilot in the service of narcotics
trafficker Pablo Escobar, making international flights on one of the
Medellin Cartel's main routes for distributing alkaloid (cocaine)
between Colombia and the cities of Miami and New York, among
others.''
   Gonzales was arrested in a roundup after the Aug. 17
assassination of Col. Valdemar Francklin Quintero, Medellin's top
police official, the communique said.
   Escobar, who leads the United States' most-wanted list of
Colombian traffickers, is said to head a $3 billion worldwide
cocaine empire. The government of Colombia has offered a $250,000
reward for information leading to his arrest.
   Terrorists continued attacks in Medellin today, bombing a branch
of a government farm bank on the outskirts of the city. ``It wasn't
a big bomb,'' a police spokeswoman said. ``It blew out the door and
some windows. No one was hurt,'' she said.
   A poll conducted by a Bogota daily and a radio station,
meanwhile, showed that more Colombians favor extraditing suspected
traffickers to the United States than last year.
   The poll by El Tiempo and the Caracol radio station showed that
62 percent of Colombians favor extradition and 36 percent oppose it.
Last year in the same poll, 65 percent of Colombians opposed
extradition.
   Questioned in the poll were 612 persons from Colombia's four
largest cities, Bogota, Medellin, Cali and Barranquilla. The margin
of error was not available, and it was not clear how representative
the results were.
   On Wednesday, Eduardo Martinez Romero, an economist alleged to be
the money launderer for the Medellin drug cartel, was flown to
Atlanta. He will be tried on charges of laundering $27 million worth
of illicit cocaine cash.
   A Justice Department spokesman said in Washington that U.S.
attorneys are preparing extradition requests for the 12 most-wanted
Colombian drug traffickers.
   President Virgilio Barco was dealt a setback in his war on drugs
Thursday when public outrage forced him to back off from imposing
military rule on two cities believed to be strongholds of cocaine
traffickers.
   Barco replaced the mayors of the cities with military officers,
but rescinded the orders in the face of charges the action was
unconstitutional and anti-democratic.
   Also Thursday, one person was killed and at least seven others
were injured in nationwide violence.
   In Medellin, headquarters of the powerful Medellin cocaine
cartel, two policemen were slightly injured when bombs placed under
a table destroyed a fast-food restaurant in a busy pedestrian mall.
   Classes at the National University of Bogota were suspended for
the day after skirmishes broke out during a demonstration by about
500 students protesting U.S. aid to help Colombia fight its war on
drugs.
   The students shouted ``Gringos go home'' and burned an American
flag. Groups of youths with white hoods on their heads flung
firecrackers at police and two students were injured in scuffles.
   Also in the capital, gunmen in a speeding car killed cattle
rancher Jaime Castillo Franco and wounded his driver. Flying glass
injured two bystanders, a woman and her daughter.
   It was not known if the slaying was related to the government's
anti-drug war, which began Aug. 18 when assassins believed to be
paid by the cocaine traffickers killed the front-running
presidential candidate, Sen. Luis Carlos Galan, a strong foe of drug
dealing.
   Under emergency measures imposed by Barco, authorities have
seized millions of dollars in real estate and other property
believed to belong to the drug lords. The president also revived
Colombia's extradition treaty with the United States, where many of
the leading traffickers face charges.
   Although the crackdown is believed to have practically paralyzed
cocaine production, there is fear of more bombings and other
terrorist attacks.
   The drug lords have said they would rather die in Colombia than
inside American prisons and have vowed to kill 10 judges for every
drug suspect extradited.
   On Thursday, more Americans were reported leaving. They included
20 families of employees of U.S.-based Occidental Petroleum Co., a
source said on condition of anonymity. He said they left Wednesday
night.

<DATELINE>ORLANDO, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Walt Disney Co. has relented, and Winnie the
Pooh will be immortalized with a statue in a small Canadian town
after all.
   Officials in White River, Ontario, received a letter from a
lawyer for the entertainment company authorizing the town to proceed
with its plans to honor the bear made famous in children's stories
by A.A. Milne.
   White River clims it is Pooh's birthplace and sought approval to
build the statue from Disney, which acquired rights to the character
in 1961.
   Disney initially said no. The company is protective of its
trademark characters and copyrights and recently has increased legal
efforts against those trading on its products without a license.
   But White River Mayor Ollie Chapman said Thursday she believes
Disney bowed to public pressure. ``We got calls from people as far
away as Australia who said, `Go for it. Give it the good fight. Show
them they're not God,''' Ms. Chapman told The Orlando Sentinel.
   Disney lawyer Robert Ogden had one condition for the statue: Pooh
must resemble the drawings in Milne's stories and not Disney's
character.
   ``We're happy about it,'' said the mayor. ``We are starting a
fund-raising program now to raise money for the statue.''
   The Pooh legend started in White River during World War I.
   Harry Colebourn, a veterinarian with a Canadian infantry brigade,
bought a bear from a trapper for $17 when he was passing through
town on a troop train. The young black bear sailed to Europe with
the soldiers.
   The bear, named Winnie for Colebourn's hometown of Winnipeg,
could not go to the front lines, so it was left at the London Zoo.
There, the bear later captivated Milne's imagination and became a
character in his stories along with Milne's son, Christopher Robin.

<TEXT>
   President Bush's nominee for the new post of
assistant secretary of the Air Force for space conceded Friday it
may not be possible to pay for all the programs the administration
is seeking.
   ``There's no question that there's more to do than we'll have the
budget for,'' Martin C. Faga told the Senate Armed Services
Committee at his confirmation hearing.
   Sen. James Exon, D-Neb., had asked Faga how the administration
could afford such programs as the National Aerospace Plane, the
hypersonic craft estimated at $3.3 billion, the Advanced Tactical
Fighter plane, and a manned mission to Mars, which with a planned
American base on the moon could cost about $400 billion, according
to some lawmakers.
   ``Reality is going to meet reason somewhere along the line,''
Exon said.
   During the confirmation session, Faga, who spent 12 years on
Capitol Hill as a staff member for the House Permanent Select
Committee on Intelligence, said the Air Force budget for space is
more than $9 billion, including the work the service does on Star
Wars.

<TEXT>
   A fourth young man was indicted on murder charges
today in the fatal Bensonhurst racial attack, authorities said.
   The man, 19-year-old Joseph Serrano, had been arrested on assault
charges. But he was indicted by a grand jury on murder and other
charges, said Nancy Young, a spokeswoman for DBrooklyn istrict
Attorney Elizabeth Holtzman.
   The additional charges were not immediately released.
   Indicted earlier on murder charges in the Aug. 23 attack were the
suspected triggerman, 18-year-old Joseph Fama, and two others, Keith
Mondello, 18, and Pasquale Raucci, 19.
   Three other young white men have been arrested for allegedly
taking part in the attack on 16-year-old Yusuf Hawkins, but have not
been indicted. Police say they expect to pick up other suspects.
   Hawkins was shot to death after he and three friends, also black,
went to the predominantly white Brooklyn neighborhood of Bensonhurst
to look at a used car and were confronted by a gang of up to 30
whites, authorities said.
   Meanwhile, a top official for the state's court system says race
was not a factor in choosing a 70-year-old black judge to hear the
Bensonhurst racial murder case.
   Justice Thaddeus Owens was selected last week by a panel of
judges and court administrators who bypassed the normal selection
process.
   Matthew T. Crosson, chief administrator of the state court
system, said the need for an experienced judge with an ability to
handle cases receiving a lot of publicity led the panel to choose
Owens, not the fact that Owens is black.
   David DePetris, who represents Fama, said he might file a motion
to block the selection, not because of who was selected but because
the way he was chosen could be a violation of his client's rights.
   However, Albert C. Aronne, lawyer for Serrano, praised the
selection, saying he had tried cases before Owens and he was ``a
good man and a good judge. He's tough and we need someone tough who
calls it the way he sees it.''

<HEAD>17-Year-Old Sentenced To 8 Years For Having Sex With 11-Year-Old</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A 17-year-old has been sentenced to
eight years in prison for having sex with an 11-year-old girl who
became pregnant with twins.
   It took jurors only 20 minutes Thursday to find Carlos Johnson
guilty of sexual battery of a child under 12.
   Johnson was 16 in August 1988 when he and the girl had sex at the
Walker Ford Community Center. In January the girl delivered twins
born four months early. One was stillborn, the other soon died.
   ``It's true kids have sex with kids all the time. But maybe once
they see this, it'll stop,'' Assistant State Attorney Chris Canova
said.
   But defense attorney Greg Cummings called the case ``a great
injustice.''
   ``What really burns me is that the victim admits she was sexually
active ... In this case, we had a young girl who's not totally a
child. She knew what she was doing. She and Carlos had sex more than
once voluntarily. She told Carlos she was 15. And she was seen
having sex with other boys. This is not the little child the statute
was designed to protect.''
   But neither the jurors nor Judge Kevin Davey agreed.
   ``I think this business of teen-agers and children having
children is one of the biggest problems of our society, along with
the drug problem,'' Davey said.
   The girl, now a seventh-grader, testified Thursday that she and
Johnson had had sex and they had talked about it beforehand.
   Florida law says it doesn't matter whether a child consents.
Canova had to prove only that the victim was under 12 and sexual
intercourse occurred.

   President Bush, trying to enlist new recruits
in his war on narcotics, declared today that a nation that consumes
as much illegal drugs as America ``cannot long preserve its very
soul.'
   ``Let me challenge you: get involved. There are so many that need
your help,'' Bush said in a speech to a convention of the U.S.
Hispanic Chamber of Commerce.
   Later, he was to deliver another address, with the same message,
before the predominantly black National Baptist Convention.
   Before an Hispanic business audience that cheered his statement
that the war on drugs can be waged without higher taxes, Bush struck
back at critics who say his $7.9 billion strategy is underfunded and
doesn't go far enough.
   ``Those who judge this stategy by a price tag alone don't
understand the problem,'' he said. ``Those critics are the same ones
who complain they don't know how we can fund the proposal'' without
higher taxes.
   ``To some, the first and only answer is to hit the working man or
woman with more taxes,'' Bush said. ``That is not the right answer.''
   Discussing drug use, the president said the government estimated
that 23 million Americans had used illegal drugs last year. He said
8 million Americans had tried cocaine, and that about 1 million used
it at least once a week.
   Beyond that, he said, hundreds of thousands of babies were born
to mothers who use drugs.
   ``A nation with those numbers cannot long preserve its very
soul,'' he said.
   Bush said ``America must take back its streets. We need more
jails and prisons and courts and prosecutors. And, indeed, in my
view, tougher sentences.''
   He called for the death penalty for ``the ultimate drug
violators, those that do the most to corrupt the kids in this
country and strip them of every chance of a meaningful life. I'm
talking about those drug kingpins or those that kill police
officers.''
   Bush's trip here came amid signs that Democrats are rethinking
their strategy of attacking the drug plan.
   Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Joseph Biden, the Delaware
Democrat who originally said Bush's program was ``not tough enough,
bold enough or imaginative enough,'' said Thursday he wanted to put
the legislation ``on a fast track.''
   Bush's program, seeking $716 million more than already proposed
in his budget, emphasizes a crackdown on drug users and more money
for prisons, law enforcement and treatment centers, as well as more
money to attack the problem in drug-producing countries.
   White House chief of staff John Sununu, speaking with reporters
en route to New Orleans today, said the president did not want to
make the anti-drug package it so harsh that it would ``suspend
constitutional rights'' of citizens.
   He said however, he was pleased that ``Congress seems to be
getting into the swim of things.'' He said the Senate ``ought to be
complimented' for voting to cut their free mail privileges for the
drug war.
   Asked whether the administration would be amenable if Congress
voted more money for the drug war than the $7.9 million called for
by Bush, Sununu said it would be difficult to do that within the
boundaries of the budget compromise the administration has reached
with Congress.
   However, he said, ``if they can find an appropriate readjustment
of priorities'' in shuffling around money, ``we're not going to be
close-minded if there are good suggestions that come from Congress.''
   ``Criminals in this nation must understand that if they commit a
crime, they will be caught; and if caught, they will be prosecuted;
and if convicted, they will do time,'' Bush said Wednesday in a
speech in Baltimore before the annual convention of the American
Legion.
   Training his fire on his critics, Bush said: ``Some, incredibly,
say, well, it's not enough. This from the very people who oppose the
death penalty.
   ``It's that kind of thinking that's lost too many battles
already,'' the president said. ``So let's not let these critics lose
the war.''

<TEXT>
   For nearly two centuries, society's
highest and mightiest flocked to this Allegheny Mountain resort to
sip the natural mineral water and soak up elegance at one of
America's oldest spas.
   But the Bedford Springs Hotel is foundering these days as its
owners struggle to repay debts and avoid the auction block.
   ``We have the ability to revive something historic and to spur
the economy, and that should sound like government funding would be
available to do that,'' said Hobert Hobbs, 50, vice president of Sky
Group International Inc., which owns the hotel.
   Unless an investor comes to the rescue, the resort will be
auctioned off Sept. 21, nine days before $4.8 million is due the
bank. The money is what was spent from a $7.5 million loan made in
1987 for renovations that weren't completed because of a dispute
between owners that ended up in bankruptcy court.
   Local folks fear that a new owner will raze the 185-year-old
hotel or modernize it to the point that all ambience is lost.
   Merchants in neighboring Bedford, a town of about 4,000 people
brimming with antique and art shops, say business already is off 20
percent to 25 percent as a result of the hotel turmoil. Tourism
accounts for about a third of the area's income, according to Joe
Lurie, executive director of the Bedford County Office of Economic
Development.
   ``It's like losing a big industry,'' he said.
   A few years ago, nearly 200 people worked at Bedford Springs
Hotel, a stately stretch of three- and four-story buildings on 2,300
acres in south-central Pennsylvania. They tended an 18-hole golf
course, tennis courts, a stocked lake, and hiking and riding trails
during the May-through-October season.
   Forty-seven employees are left. All but 66 of the hotel's 244
rooms are closed to guests, who dine at the golf clubhouse because
the main kitchen is shut down.
   Eight guest rooms were occupied on a recent weeknight, leaving
doorman Joe Koontz with little to do except read.
   ``They (guests) ask me what's going to happen next. Well I don't
know what's going to happen next,'' said Koontz, 61.
   Bedford Springs Hotel's troubles, in part, reflect those of the
entire industry, according to industry observers.
   ``The hotel industry is in deep trouble all around the country,
big time. There are 45 percent more rooms than demand in the whole
United States. It's an overbuilt industry,'' said Phil Goodman,
president of Western Media Corp., a marketing company in San Diego.
   Edward Watkins, editor of Lodging Hospitality, a monthly trade
magazine, estimates about 50 of the nation's 45,000 hotels and
motels are ``old-line resorts,'' which offer traditional types of
recreation in a spread-out, rural setting with a meal plan. Only a
dozen or so are 100 years old or more.
   ``The traditional guest they served is getting old and dying
off,'' he said.
   The Bedford Springs Hotel was opened in 1804 by a doctor drawn by
the area's magnesia springs and their reputed curative powers. The
springs had been used for centuries before by Indians.
   The spa quickly attracted the notables of the times: Mrs. John
Quincy Adams and her daughters, Aaron Burr, and statesmen Henry
Clay, John C. Calhoun and Daniel Webster.
   President James Polk visited in 1848 followed by five other
presidents, including James Buchanan, who used the spa as a summer
White House. Candidate Ronald Reagan stayed overnight in 1974.
   The U.S. Supreme Court met at the resort to decide a case in
1855, the only time it ever met outside its chambers. And it was
there in 1858 that Buchanan received the first Trans-Atlantic cable,
a message from England's Queen Victoria.
   During World War II, the Navy established a radio training school
at the resort. The hotel also housed Japanese diplomats.
   Bedford Springs is being considered, along with State College, as
a possible summer home for the Pittsburgh Symphony Orchestra.
   Hobbs and community leaders hope the orchestra's interest will
prompt the bank to grant a delay on payment of the loan.
   ``We're still confident something good is going to happen,''
Hobbs said. ``Was it Yogi Berra who said, `It ain't over til it's
over?' Well it ain't over til it's over.'''

<HEAD>Officials Expect East Germans to Leave for West in Days</HEAD>

<DATELINE>BUDAPEST, Hungary (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Officials said Friday they expect
thousands of East German refugees to leave for the West within days
from tent camps, summer cabins and other makeshift lodgings where
many have spent weeks.
   One sign of an imminent diplomatic solution was the departure
from the West German mission in East Berlin, with promises of help
in attempts to emigrate, of 116 East Germans who had been inside
more than a month.
   An estimated 6,500 East Germans who fled their strict communist
homeland are in Hungary awaiting passage to West Germany, which
gives East Germans automatic citizenship and help in starting new
lives. More than 300 are in Bonn's embassy in Prague, capital of
Czechoslovakia.
   Another 6,000 East Germans escaped through Hungary this summer to
Austria. Officials of the Austrian Red Cross said Friday nearly 100
had arrived overnight, apparently unwilling to wait for the mass
migration.
   Flight through Hungary began after its liberal communist regime
decided in May to remove barbed wire and other barriers from the
border with Austria. Few East Germans are allowed to visit the West,
but trips to neighboring Hungary have been easy to arrange.
   Rezso Nyers, president of Hungary's Communist Party, said in
response to questions from reporters Friday the East Germans would
be able to leave ``in a short time.''
   ``I can't say what a short time is, whether two or three days or
a week,'' he said when pressed for a more precise response.
   Hans-Dietrich Genscher, the West German foreign minister, said in
a television interview: ``I have the deepest trust in the Hungarian
government that it will find a humanitarian solution. From what
we've heard, we can expect a solution within the next few days.''
   Wolfgang Wagner, a West German relief official in charge of the
Budapest camps, told reporters: ``We see light at the end of the
tunnel.''
   A few days ago, Hungarian officials indicated the refugees might
not leave for weeks.
   Hungary has appeared caught between the two Germanys, anxious to
prove to Bonn that it is committed to Western concepts of human
rights but worried about angering the orthodox leadership in East
Berlin.
   It has a long-standing agreement with its Soviet bloc ally to
return any East Germans caught trying to flee to the West.
   There has been no public explanation of the delay in what would
be the first case of an East bloc country helping citizens of
another escape the West.
   The 116 East Germans left the West German mission in East Berlin
after being promised ``extensive legal counsel'' in their quest to
leave the country, mission spokesman Eberhard Grashoff said.
   He said they were given no promises they could emigrate but left
after talks between a senior West German official and Wolfgang
Vogel, an East German lawyer who often has arranged for East Germans
to leave.
   In Budapest, East German diplomats continued efforts to woo back
some of the thousands of young workers, most of them skilled, who
fled their homeland.
   Dieter Grahmann of the East German Embassy claimed some had
expressed interest in returning in exchange for safe jobs and
guarantees of no reprisals, but he did not give figures.
   In his trailer-office outside the Zugliget refugee camp, Grahmann
listened to fellow East Germans explaining why they had left.
   ``The worst thing for us is that we cannot live the way we want
to, that the party always tells us what to do,'' said a man from
Leipzig.
   An angry woman cut in with: ``Who among the East German
leadership asks whether policies are made for us, the people, or for
the politicians?''

<HEAD>Activists Says 29 Killed in Election Day Violence</HEAD>

   Anti-apartheid activists claimed
Friday that 29 people were killed during police action on election
day, and they produced grieving relatives to respond to government
charges they lied about the death toll.
   Law and Order Minister Adriaan Vlok accused Anglican Archbishop
Desmond Tutu and the Rev. Allan Boesak, president of the World
Alliance of Reformed Churches, of lying when they blamed police
Thursday for more than 20 deaths during anti-election protests.
   The two activists held a news conference in which they said the
death toll had increased to 29 and the injuries to 200 in nine black
and mixed-race townships around Cape Town. Weeping women described
how police had shot their children.
   ``The evidence points to the fact that the violence in all these
areas was instigated by the police,'' said Boesak. He called on
Acting President F.W. de Klerk to fire Vlok.
   Tutu called for all Cape Town residents to gather at St. George's
Anglican Cathedral next Wednesday, the day the new Parliament
convenes, for a march into the city ``to express outrage at what is
happening.''
   ``You must condemn what the police have done and you must say to
our people you are sorry ... You must express your condolences to
those who have been bereaved,'' Tutu said in a statement addressed
to the acting president.
   De Klerk, expected to be chosen for a five-year term as president
by an electoral college Thursday, has yet to issue any public
statement about the Cape Town violence.
   Vlok said in a statement that 26 policemen were injured in unrest
late Wednesday and early Thursday following elections for the white,
mixed-race and Indian chambers of Parliament. Blacks are excluded
from Parliament, and militant leaders of all races urged a boycott
of the elections for the two non-white chambers.
   Vlok said Boesak and Tutu ``are deliberately misleading the world
about the true facts surrounding the events in the Western Cape.
They tried to allege that innocent and peaceful persons have been
shot dead by the police in cold blood.''
   Evette Otto and Jemima Miller, two mixed-race women, told the
news conference that is exactly what police did.
   Mrs. Miller said her son, Patrick, 13, was on his way to a shop
with a friend Wednesday and was two doors away from his house in
Bellville when a police van came around the corner. She said people
started running, but the boys didn't think it was necessary.
   Police started firing, Mrs. Miller alleged, and a bullet went
through Patrick's head. He is in unstable condition and doctors are
unable to operate because his brain is swelling, she said.
   Mrs. Otto said her 16-year-old daughter, five months pregnant,
was shot to death at point-blank range by a uniformed policeman as
she stood on a street in Kalksteenfontein.
   Mrs. Otto did not say she witnessed the shooting. But she said
her daughter's body showed she had been shot through the chest at
point-blank range and the ammunition had exited through her back.
   Tutu said he was deeply hurt ``that we should bring our people in
this way to seem to be making a display of our pain, just in order
for certain people to be made to believe that what we say happened
has in fact happened.''
   Vlok expressed his ``deepest condemnation about the lies and the
manner in which the two church leaders have attempted to make
political gains from the unrest.''
   According to Vlok, police are aware of 15 unrest deaths in the
Cape Town area Wednesday night, 10 of them attributed to factional
fighting between blacks in the township of Khayelitsha. He said the
other five deaths were being investigated.
   Cape Town attorney Essa Moosa gave a breakdown of the 29 deaths,
which he said was based on bodies in mortuaries and hospitals. Moosa
said a conservative figure for injuries was 200.
   ``Most deaths were caused by the police,'' Moosa said. He
acknowledged there had been factional fighting in Khayelitsha but
said there was reason to believe one faction ``came out of police
vans.''
   Iris Jantjies, a mixed-race woman, told the news conference she
had also seen policemen shooting ``without reason'' in Khayelitsha,
and they had taken her 25-year-old son Matthew away after he was
shot. She said she did not know whether he was alive and that police
would not tell her where he was taken.

   On Friday, St. Joseph County quit
collaborating with Cupid.
   District Court Administrator David Recher said he stopped
performing $10, no-frills civil marriages because of an overburdened
and underfunded court.
   Recher said he usually performs about 100 weddings a year,
prompting weary court personnel to refer to the ceremonies as the
county's ``$1,000-a-year headache.''
   Personnel shortages and an increasing criminal caseload have
forced more than one love-struck couple to cool their ardor on
folding chairs in the court's lobby while Recher attended to
criminal cases.
   From now on, Recher said couples will have to take their rings
and rice to neighboring counties.
   St. Joseph County magistrates have been performing ceremonies for
about 20 years, although state law does not require the service.
   Recher said his ceremonies are usually brief, with the paperwork
taking more time than the ``I dos.''
   ``If they're in a really big rush, I just ask them if they accept
each other without any coercion or constraint and pronounce them
married,'' Recher said.
   ``I've had guys come in to get married in dirty, oily T-shirts
right from work and get irritated if it takes too long because they
want to get back to work.''
   The magistrate said he might resume the rites if voters on
Tuesday approve a tax increase that leads to reinstatement of a
second, full-time magistrate.

<HEAD>Panel Makes ``Major Progress'' on Changing Care Coverage</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JIM LUTHER</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Senate Finance Committee agreed tentatively
Friday to slash the surtax that finances catastrophic health
insurance for retirees and to reduce coverage for prescriptions and
doctors' fees.
   The panel, under pressure from older Americans who don't like the
new program, is still debating whether workers and their employers
should pay higher taxes to help buy the insurance for retirees.
   ``I think we made major progress,'' Sen. Lloyd Bentsen, D-Texas,
the committee chairman, told reporters after the panel worked behind
closed doors to change the year-old program. ``It's coming on along
in a bipartisan way.''
   Bentsen indicated the committee may complete work on the program
by the middle of next week. Although most members of the committee
want to continue catastrophic insurance _ as does the Bush
administration _ there are indications a stiff fight to kill the
program will be waged on the House and Senate floors.
   The program, aimed at ensuring that retirees are not wiped out
financially by an illness requiring long-term hospitalization, was
enacted with great fanfare as a logical expansion of Medicare. It
was innovative in that the coverage would be paid for by the same
group of citizens _ retirees _ who would reap the benefits.
   Now, two groups of retirees are raising such a fuss about
catastrophic insurance that major changes in the program are assured.
   Most of the complaints are from the 40 percent of retirees with
the highest incomes. They pay an income surtax of up to $800 a year
to finance the program but want all taxpayers _ not just retirees _
to pay for catastrophic.
   The second group of protesters includes federal retirees and
others who already have catastrophic coverage through another
government plan or a private ``medigap'' policy. They say the new
program offers them nothing.
   The law requires every person eligible for Medicare to pay for
catastrophic coverage.
   Bentsen said the Finance Committee reached a consensus on these
major points:
   _The income surtax, which pays about two-thirds the cost of
catastrophic coverage, will be reduced significantly, below the cost
of a private medigap policy. The surtax rate, now 15 percent of a
retiree's income tax liability over $150, will be reduced, as will
the $800 maximum annual surtax.
   _The flat fee paid by almost all catastrophic beneficiaries, now
$4 a month, will not be increased above current law.
   _The ceiling on the amount of doctors' fees a beneficiary must
pay out of pocket before catastrophic coverage kicks in will be
delayed a year, to 1991, and will be raised above the current
ceiling of $1,370.
   _The share of out-of-pocket outlays for prescription drugs a
beneficiary must bear before catastrophic coverage begins will be
raised significantly. Present law puts the deductible at a level
high enough that only 27 percent of the 33 million Medicare
beneficiaries would qualify for reimbursement; the Finance Committee
would reduce coverage so that no more than 16.8 percent would
qualify.
   They will formally vote on the provisions in later committee
meetings.
   Bentsen said the committee reached no consensus on whether
retirees should be allowed to drop out of catastrophic coverage if
they also agree to give up basic Medicare Part B coverage for
doctors' fees.
   Also, Bentsen said, it is not clear whether the committee wants
non-retirees to share the costs of catastrophic coverage for
retirees.
   One option under consideration would raise to $60,000 the maximum
amount of a worker's earnings that are subject to the 1.45-percent
tax that finances basic Medicare hospitalization benefits. The
present taxable limit is $48,000. The levy is collected as part of
the Social Security payroll tax withheld from paychecks.
   Senate Majority Leader George J. Mitchell, D-Maine, a member of
the committee, said he thinks the modifications would be acceptable
to most senators. But the furor over the financing mechanism
illustrates the difficulty lawmakers face in passing such
legislation, he told reporters.
   ``On balance, I think it makes more difficult the enactment of
such programs because of the inevitable and substantial feeling that
we adopted a very good program and all we've gotten is a bunch of
flak,'' he said.

   Solidarity leader Lech Walesa ended a
four-day visit Friday with assurances of West German support for
Polish reform and a list of 26 companies that may invest in his
country.
   Walesa said he was confident the two countries would expand
business ties and improve political relations.
   ``We've taken care of much more here than I had hoped for,'' he
told reporters. ``We have found great understanding and proof that
we can indeed be good neighbors.''
   Foreign Minister Hans-Dietrich Genscher pledged his government's
``support for the reform processes in Poland'' and said West Germany
would work to obtain aid from the European Economic Community.
   Economics Minister Helmut Haussmann said after meeting with
Walesa that he would lead a delegation of business representatives
on a visit to Poland.
   Walesa has pressed for aid and investment from West Germany and
other West European countries. The main priorities of the new Polish
government, led by Solidarity, are to revive the economy and improve
living conditions.
   When he arrived Tuesday, Walesa carried a list of 16 proposed
projects for investment by West German companies, all in the Gdansk
area of the Baltic coast.
   The projects, involving more than $90 million of foreign
investment, range from joint production of fiberboard to joint
ventures in shipbuilding.
   West Germany's Industry and Trade Federation, which represents
thousands of companies, gave Walesa a list Friday of 26 companies
interested in taking part, and he met with representatives of some.
   Industry leaders cautioned Walesa during the visit not to expect
large amounts of aid until the risks to foreign capital were reduced.
   He told reporters he knew it would take time to reach agreement
on any of the projects.
   ``It all depends on the companies,'' he said. ``It cannot be
forced. One cannot say in advance how many will be ready to do
business with us.''
   On Thursday, Walesa said he would present other project proposals
to Britain, France and other European countries.
   On a visit to Dortmund, the Soldarity leader told members of the
coal and energy workers union the ``curtain has been lifted between
East and West. We must work together to solve our problems.''

   Czechoslovak police raided the Prague
apartment of two prominent dissidents, temporarily detained eight
people and confiscated hundreds of documents, one of the activists
said Friday.
   Anna Sabatova, who with her husband Petr Uhl is a member of the
Charter 77 human rights movement, told The Associated Press in
Vienna by telephone that police also photographed the identity
papers of four French trade unionists who were visiting.
   Eight Czechs visiting the apartment had to go to the police
station, she said.
   Among those temporarily detained were Sasha Vondra, a Charter 77
spokesman who this week was ordered jailed two months but released
pending appeal, and prominent activist Jan Urban, Ms. Sabatova said.
   The police confiscated possessions that included a typewriter,
telephone and hundreds of documents, Ms. Sabatova said.
   ``They just want to make the work more difficult,'' she said,
referring to the dozens of calls the couple must make daily to other
activists.
   She said she believed the action was connected with a pending
case against fellow activist Petr Pospichal, who faces charges of
slander. He, Uhl, Urban and Ms. Sabatova are all active in a
dissident network that distributes information from the East bloc.

   Trade between the United States and
East Germany remains at a trickle and is fraught with obstacles and
restrictions, U.S. executives say.
   But many representatives of U.S. companies attending this
autumn's Leipzig international trade fair say business ties are on
the increase and that it is best to get an American foot in the door
of a market that some day may mushroom.
   More than 60 U.S. companies or their European affiliates are
represented at the eight-day trade fair that ends Sunday. Booths
manned by U.S. companies displayed a variety of products from grains
to medical supplies.
   Tom Praster, a U.S. Embassy economics adviser, said the major
problem in U.S.-East German trade is the communist country's lack of
hard currency.
   East Germans prefer to barter their own products for Western-made
goods, he said.
   ``Counter-trading is a big factor in many deals here. You've got
to take something in return, and that is often a problem because
it's sometimes hard to find markets for some of the counter-trade
things,'' Praster told the AP.
   U.S. trade officials say formidible government bureaucracy also
hampers larger deals.
   ``Often the products are purchased by the East German foreign
trade office and then turned over to the end user. When it's time to
service the machine they have to repeat that process,'' Praster said.
   ``The people who are using the equipment _ the hospitals, the
farms or road-building companies _ can't go directly to the
manufacturer and ask somebody to come in and repair it.''
   Despite the low volume of trade between the two countries, most
U.S. businesses say their presence at the fair is important.
   Tom Payne, a marketing consultant for California Raisins, says he
expects the small market for his product in East Germany and Eastern
Europe to grow.
   ``We're here because everybody expects change in the East bloc.
We want to get in on the ground floor.
   ``We believe in time this market can be as good as some of the
West European countries,'' Payne said.
   Although East Germans do sell cheaper raisins imported from
Turkey and Iran in regular grocery stores, they import high-quality
California raisins to make products for export or for sale in hard
currency stores at home, Payne explained.
   ``They use them to make Dresdener Stollen (fruit cakes), which
are exported mostly to Western Europe but also to the United
States,'' he said.
   But East Germany bought only 20 tons of California raisins at
about $1,400 a ton last year. ``It's only a small market so far,
it's still a development project,'' said Payne.

   There aren't too many newspaper readers in
Selma who don't know about the engagement of Jeff Stumb and Patricia
Cavanaugh.
   Stumb, managing editor of The Selma Times-Joural, proposed in his
newspaper column on Wednesday. Miss Cavanaugh's acceptance came in
Friday's edition.
   Stumb slipped his proposal into Wednesday's paper after Miss
Cavanaugh had left the newsroom Tuesday night. When the paper hit
the street Wednesday morning, she was still in bed.
   ``The guy from the radio station called me at 7 a.m. to ask me
about it. I didn't know what he was talking about. I was still
asleep,'' she said.
   Stumb said he chose the newspaper proposal because ``I wanted to
do something different, something no one else has ever done.''
   ``It's not exactly the way I imagined being proposed to,'' Miss
Cavanaugh said, ``but I guess it's kind of romantic.''
   Miss Cavanaugh is from Bassfield, Miss., and Stumb is from
Birmingham. But they will be married in Selma because of the
community interest.
   ``I didn't know so many people read the newspaper or that there
would be so much interest,'' she said Thursday. ``The mayor called

   Ron Stetson is used to some pointed attacks,
but this week, he uncovered the big sting.
   A pest control expert, Stetson was called in to remove a 4-foot
wasps' nest teeming with as many as 5,000 wasps from Harriet and Bud
Morrissey's attic.
   Stetson and his technicians zapped the giant nest with five cans
of ``wasp freeze,'' which renders insects unable to fly, then
injected bug poison into the hive itself to kill the colony.
   They returned the next day to haul the nest away. But in the
process it broke, revealing still buzzing insects and larvae.
   ``I've never seen anything like it,'' said Stetson, who has been
in the pest control business for 7{ years. ``I couldn't begin to
guess how long it took to build.''
   Stetson applied a powder that kills larvae for six months,
provided a 30-day warranty, and told them to call back if there was
any more trouble.
   ``I thought how will I know if there's any more trouble?'' she
asked. ``I don't think I'm going to crawl up there.''

   A rubber duck race has turned into a
floating fund-raiser because the original idea ran afoul of state
gambling laws.
   The organizers, Delta Gamma Lincoln Alumnae had planned for
people to pay to sponsor rubber ducks and for prizes to be awarded
to the sponsors of the first fake fowls to cross the finish line.
   But Deputy Tax Commissioner Roger Hirsch said the Star City Duck
Dash set for Sept. 24 would have violated state law on raffles and
lotteries.
   ``You can race all the ducks you want, but you can't gamble on
the outcome,'' Hirsch said.
   The only races Nebraskans can gamble on legally are run by horses
at licensed race tracks, he said.
   So, Hirsch and representatives of the alumnae agreed to a new
approach to the race of 4,000 rubber ducks in Salt Creek. Each duck
will wear a band with the name and serial number of the sponsoring
organization and a ticket number. People will pay $5 to sponsor a
duck.
   After the race is concluded, Hirsch said, ``some lucky person is
going to wade into Salt Creek and draw the lucky duck.''
   ``We will consider the widdle band around the widdle neck of the
widdle duck to be a ticket,'' Hirsch said.

<HEAD>Kenyans Expelling American Missionary</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government said Friday it is expelling
an Oregon missionary, the latest salvo in a 3-year-old dispute that
has included allegations American missionaries plotted to overthrow
the government.
   The order came after the missionary, Richard Hamilton, was
interrogated Friday about a recent meeting with a controversial
Kenyan bishop who accuses government officials of corruption and
increasing authoritarianism.
   Immigration officer Frank Kwinga refused to say whether that
meeting sparked Hamilton's expulsion but said the 51-year-old
director of the East African Christian Mission in Kenya ``will be
required to go.''
   Kwinga said Hamilton and his wife, Jane, should have left the
country in July 1988 when their mission was de-registered. He would
not say when Hamilton would be required to leave or whether the
order also applies to his wife.
   All organizations have to be registered in Kenya, a one-party
state where the Hamiltons have worked 15 years among
poverty-stricken peasants.
   In November 1987, the Hamiltons were threatened with deportation
after the government accused them of involvement with an alleged
plot to oust President Daniel arap Moi. Seven other American
missionaries were deported before the ``plot'' was found to be a
baseless story engineered by a disgruntled Kenyan-born priest living
in the United States.
   A year earlier, the Kenyans detained two Americans on Hamilton's
mission on charges they tried to import guns and radio transmitters.
One of the detained missionaries, Lyle Hutson, 63, also from
Medford, had a heart attack and died in police custody.
   The mission said the suspect shipment were air rifles and pistols
and that the radios were needed for communication.
   Mrs. Hamilton, in a telephone interview from her home in western
Kitale town, said her husband is being used as a scapegoat in the
dispute.
   She said their work permits were invalidated when the mission was
de-registered but that they received verbal assurances from
officials they could continue their development work in the arid
West Pokot region while authorities considered an appeal of the ban.
   ``We assumed we were okay,'' said Mrs. Hamilton.
   However, Hamilton on Thursday night was ordered to accompany
criminal investigators to Nairobi.
   Mrs. Hamilton said her husband spent Friday being interrogated by
officers who asked him repeatedly about a Sept. 1 meeting with
Bishop Alexander Muge, who repeatedly has criticized Moi's
government.
   She said their mission was banned last year after a local
official, who believed them involved with his political enemies,
complained to authorities their organization somehow was involved in
Muge's claims that people were starving in West Pokot. The charges
embarrassed the government.
   The meeting Sept. 1 was to discuss whether Muge's church would
act as an umbrella organization under which the Hamilton mission
could be re-registered, Mrs. Hamilton said.
   She said the couple did not know Muge prior to the meeting.

   A chartered passenger plane crashed in
the Skagerrak Strait north of Denmark's Jutland Peninsula today,
killing all 55 people aboard, rescue officials said.
   ``We have found 19 dead, and there are no survivors... The plane
disintegrated. We just found the main wheel floating and the nose
cone,'' said Kurt Rasmussin, an official at the Danish Sea Rescue
Center. There was no indication any of the wreckage came down on
land, officials said.
   The twin-engine Convair turboprop plane, belonging to the
Norwegian airline Partnair, was flying from Oslo, Norway, to
Hamburg, West Germany, a popular weekend destination for Norwegians
on holiday.
   ``There is no way of finding out the cause of the crash right
now, because we haven't found the black box,'' the plane's flight
recorder, said Rasmussin.
   The plane took of from Oslo's Fornebu Airport and was flying at
23,000 feet when air traffic controllers at Copenhagen's Kastrup
Airport lost contact with it, Sweden's national news agency TT
reported.
   Officials did not immediately raise the possibility of sabotage.
Nearly nine months ago, a bomb hidden in a cassette-recorder blew up
Pan Am Flight 103 as the Boeing 747 was flying at 31,000 feet over
Scotland. The crash killed all 259 people aboard the New York-bound
flight and 11 in Lockerbie, Scotland.
   There were 50 passengers and a crew of five aboard the plane that
crashed today, according to a Partnair official in Oslo, who would
not give his name. He and other officials said the plane was on a
charter flight.
   Partnair did not immediately release a passenger list or describe
the nationalities of those aboard. Its telephone lines were
constantly busy in the hours after the crash.
   The plane crashed 18.5 miles north of Hirtshals on Denark's
northern coast, according to the rescue center at Karup in central
Jutland Peninsula.
   The first ships arriving at the scene found no survivors. Norway,
Denmark and Sweden border the strait, a heavily traveled shipping
route.
   Rescue officials first reported the crash occurred at 6:30 p.m.,
but Rasmussin indicated that may have been wrong. He said the center
was alerted nearly two hours earlier at 4:49 p.m. when controllers
in Copenhagen, 190 miles to the southeast, lost contact with the
flight.

<HEAD>Thornburgh Defends Reorganization of Justice `Strike Forces'</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES ROWLEY</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Attorney General Dick Thornburgh told skeptical
lawmakers Friday that modeling the Justice Department's organized
crime strike forces after anti-drug units, under the control of
local U.S. attorneys, will put more heat on the mob.
   Thornburgh said his plan to reorganize the 14 organized-crime
strike forces would end bureaucratic turf wars that have hurt
coordination of federal law enforcement.
   ``To end the turf battles is at the very heart of what the
president has directed this attorney general to do,'' Thornburgh
told a joint hearing of the Senate Judiciary and Governmental
Affairs committees.
   ``You can't have turf battles when you have only one turf,'' the
attorney general said.
   But Thornburgh faced tough questioning about the plan from
senators, mostly Democrats, who argued that placing the strike
forces under U.S. attorneys would dilute the Justice Department's
commitment to fighting the mob.
   Sen. Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass., said plan will ``send a clear
message to the criminal syndicates that the heat is off.''
   Kennedy argued that Thornburgh was reorganizing the strike forces
merely to ``assuage the egos of U.S. attorneys'' uneasy about
Justice Department lawyers working down the street but not
accountable to them.
   ``Isn't that what this is really about?'' Kennedy asked
Thornburgh, who was once U.S. attorney in Pittsburgh.
   ``It's about the uneasiness of an attorney general who doesn't
feel the best management model is in place,'' Thornburgh replied.
   Thornburgh at one point conceded that local U.S. attorneys
unwilling to carry out the organized-crime mission could hurt the
program.
   But the attorney general said he ``had powers of persuasion to
exert'' to remove U.S. attorneys who ``are not up to snuff.''
   ``I believe I have the confidence of the U.S. attorneys. I
believe we are dedicated to the same goal.''
   The attorney general said the reorganization is designed to deal
with the changing nature of organized crime since the strike forces
were set up in 1967.
   The traditional Mafia-style crime families have been joined by
international drug cartels, street gangs, Jamaican posses and other
organizations, he said.
   ``Strike force offices have been slow to pick up on these
emerging groups,'' the attorney general said.
   The 13 organized crime drug enforcement task forces set up during
the Reagan administration is ``the model for this consolidation,''
Thornburgh said.
   The task forces, headed by U.S. attorneys, were praised this week
in President Bush's drug strategy as ``a model in interagency
coordination.''
   ``It is significant, I believe, that this model has been utilized
to attack our No. 1 crime problem _ drugs _ rather than the
independent and separate `strike force' model,'' Thornburgh told the
lawmakers.
   Transportation Secretary Samuel Skinner, a former U.S. attorney
in Chicago, supported the plan, saying: ``We will not take the heat
off organized crime, we will increase the heat on organized crime.''
   But Philip B. Heymann, a Harvard University law professor who
headed the Justice Department's criminal division during the Carter
administration, objected to the plan, likening it to ``disassembling
a racing car and replacing it with an Edsel.''
   Thornburgh is barred from doing anything until Oct. 1 by an
appropriations bill rider enacted last June that forbids any Justice
Department reorganization during the fiscal year, which ends Sept.
30.
   Some lawmakers have threatened to extend the ban if Thornburgh
does not agreed to abide by occasional objections to reorganization
plans, a proposition the attorney general rejects.
   But Sen. Sam Nunn, D-Ga., an outspoken opponent of the plan,
seemed to signal he wouldn't support a move in Congress to block its
implementation. Before Thornburgh left, Nunn told the attorney
general that his Permanent Investigations Subcommittee would closely
monitor the reorganized strike forces.
   Nunn, who had denounced the proposal when Thornburgh unveiled it
last spring, said at the hearing, ``this is the first time I can
remember that government officials seem determined to reform a
program that everyone agrees is a tremendous success.''
   Sen. Strom Thurmond, R-S.C., who had initially urged Thornburgh
not to merge the strike forces, said he now supports the plan,
adding: ``Congress should not be in the business of micromanaging
the Department of Justice.''

<DATELINE>BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Christian government of Gen. Michel
Aoun urged the United States on Friday to bring back its diplomats,
calling their evacuation a misguided reaction to rumors they were in
danger.
   ``The Cabinet expresses its regret ... because the U.S.
administration based its decision on illusions, rumors and erroneous
information,'' a statement from Aoun's three-man Christian Cabinet
said.
   It called on the United States to ``reconsider the pulling out of
its diplomats from Lebanon in order to preserve bilateral
relations.''
   The statement appeared to mark a partial backing down by Aoun in
his war of words with Washington, although it was unclear to what
extent this might be because it was issued by the Cabinet rather
than Aoun in person.
   Aoun's Cabinet is one of two vying for power in Lebanon.
   Earlier in the week, Aoun said U.S. Ambassador John McCarthy
would only be welcomed back if he presented his credentials to the
Christian Cabinet and recognized it as the legitimate government.
   That demand was not reiterated in the new statement.
   McCarthy arrived in Lebanon a year ago and did not present his
credentials in an obvious effort to avoid recognizing either the
Christian or Moslem governments.
   Also Friday, the wife of missing Briton Jack Mann, one of 16
Westerners held hostage in Lebanon, said she had been told he died
and that she believed the report. Mann disappeared May 12 as he
drove to a bank in Syrian-policed Moslem west Beirut.
   A police spokesman, meanwhile, said mortar and tank-cannon
clashes between Syrian-allied forces and Christian troops raged
around the Douar hills, which command one of the main routes leading
to the beleaguered Christian enclave northeast of Beirut.
   The spokesman, who cannot be named in line with regulations, said
no casualties were reported from the fighting mainly because it did
not target populated areas.
   By police count, at least 830 people have been killed and 2,462
wounded since the latest round of fighting broke out March 8.
   The Cabinet's statement was issued after a two-hour meeting at
the bunker under the bomb-ravaged presidential palace in suburban
Baabda east of Beirut.
   A reliable Christian source, speaking on condition of anonymity,
said Aoun considers the U.S. evacuation ``a move directed against
his rule.''
   The diplomats were evacuated Wednesday a few hours after pro-Aoun
Christian youths besieged the embassy compound in Beirut's northern
suburb of Aukar.
   Acting Prime Minister Salim Hoss, who heads the Syrian-backed
Moslem Cabinet vying for power with Aoun's, expressed ``regret''
over the pullout in a statement broadcast by the Moslem Voice of the
Nation radio.
   U.S. State Department spokeswoman Margaret Tutwiler on Thursday
said the evacuation was motivated by what she called a threat by
Aoun to take Americans hostage.
   In an interview published Sept. 1 in the French daily Figaro,
Aoun was asked whether the United States was putting pressure on
France not to aid him.
   He replied: ``They put pressure on everyone and claim in addition
to have so acted because they have ... hostages being held in
Lebanon.
   ``As if the war were being waged without hostages or victims. If
I understand well, it would be enough that tomorrow I take 20
Americans hostage so that the United States stops putting pressure
on my friends,'' Aoun added.
   Aoun, speaking at a news conference Thursday, said the evacuation
was based on ``hearsay from reporters and false interpretations of
newspapers such as the French newspaper Figaro.''
   An aide to Aoun, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the
general's remark to Figaro ``is in no way a threat.''
   ``The general was simply implying that the American
administration is obsessed with the hostage issue,'' the aide said.
   There are 16 Westerners held hostage in Lebanon, mainly by
pro-Iranian Shiite Moslem factions. Eight are Americans. The hostage
held longest is Terry Anderson, chief Middle East correspondent for
The Associated Press, who was kidnapped March 16, 1985.
   None of Lebanon's kidnap groups has specifically identified Mann,
75, as a hostage. But a previously unknown faction, the Cells of
Armed Struggle, claimed that it kidnapped an unidentified Briton in
Beirut the day Mann disappeared.
   Mann's wife, Sunny, said she received a telephone call Monday
from an unidentified man who told her: ``I have bad news about your
husband.''
   She said she later met the man at a shop in west Beirut's Hamra
commercial thoroughfare and ``he told me that Jack is dead.'' She
said the report ``seems correct.''

<TEXT>
   A 22-bed hospital $350,000 in debt has
closed, and the nearest emergency medical care for residents of
impoverished Tunica County is 36 miles away.
   ``That hospital is not a luxury. It's an absolute necessity given
the demography in that county,'' said Marilyn Farray, a lawyer for
several indigent residents who fought to keep Tunica County Hospital
open.
   ``We may be able to gauge it in the loss of lives,'' Farray said.
``Tunica County Hospital probably will reopen, but there'll be blood
on the floor.''
   A shortage of emergency-room physicians hastened the decision to
surrender the hospital's license and close Thursday, said Tharon
Lee, president of Tunica County Hospital Inc., which has operated
the county-owned hospital since June 1986.
   The hospital had treated few patients other than in the emergency
room since April, when the two physicians then living in the county
_ one of the poorest in the country _ resigned from the staff and
stopped admitting people.
   The Board of Supervisors of the county of about 10,000 people
will meet soon to discuss its options, said board President Paul
Battle. He said he expects the board to terminate its contract with
the non-profit hospital corporation.
   ``We don't have any choice,'' Battle said.
   The board then would be free to review proposals submitted by
others to manage the hospital, said Jim Cox, the board's special
counsel.
   Lee, however, said he informed the state Department of Health on
Wednesday that the corporation will try to get its license back when
physicians become insured for emergency care or when an outside
party provides funding.
   ``It would take a John D. Rockefeller to run just the ambulance
service and emergency room,'' Lee said. But he said four or five
parties are interested.
   Lee estimated the hospital's debt at $350,000, which accumulated
as patients in the county had trouble paying their bills and doctors
stopped sending patients there, fearing the quality of care had
dropped.
   ``When it becomes common knowledge you have financial problems,
every vendor that's involved gets nervous,'' Lee said.
   Cox said the hospital corporation, not the county, is responsible
for that debt.
   The county has a year to get the hospital reopened, said Steve
Egger, branch manager with the Health Department's licensure and
certification division.
   ``It will have to start from scratch again, like a new hospital
coming into the program,'' Egger said.
   The county has taken over the hospital's ambulance service.
Emergency calls are being routed to nursing director Billie
Russell's home. Patients usually are taken 36 miles south to
Clarksdale or 40 miles northeast to Memphis, Tenn.
   ``We're trying as hard as we can to set up some sort of emergency
service center,'' Russell said.
   Battle is confident the hospital will reopen.
   ``You can rest assured we'll have a hospital and an ambulance
service,'' Battle said.

<HEAD>US Welcomes Reported Cuban Decision To Withdraw From Ethiopia</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The State Department responded favorably Friday
to a Cuban government statement that the last of the remaining Cuban
troops in Ethiopia will be withdrawn starting on Saturday.
   Spokeswoman Margaret Tutwiler estimated the Cuban presence there
at between 2,500 and 3,500 and said their withdrawal would be
``significant'' and ``positive.''
   Cuba dispatched more than 12,000 forces to Ethiopia in 1977 to
help the Marxist government put down a cross-border incursion from
Somalia. The dispute centered on conflicting claims to the Ogaden
region of Ethiopia.
   The Cuban action soured what had been a promising start toward a
more normal relationship between the United States and Cuba.
   The two countries opened diplomatic missions in each other's
capital in September 1977 but, with the dispatch of the troops to
Ethiopia, progress toward improved relations was halted.
   Ms. Tutwiler refused to speculate on what a complete withdrawal
of Cuban forces from Ethiopia would mean for U.S.-Cuban relations.
Late last year, Cuba agreed to withdraw its forces from Angola over
a 27-month time frame and has pulled out a significant number of
troops since then.
   On a related subject, Ms. Tutwiler said the administration was
encouraged by the start of peace talks in Atlanta between
representatives of the Ethiopian government and a rebel group which
has been seeking independence for the northern territory of Eritrea.
   The talks were arranged by former President Carter.
   ``We hope that the discussions that have begin in Atlanta will
lead to a just and durable settlement on terms acceptable to both
sides,'' Ms. Tutwiler said.

<HEAD>Jane Austen Descendents Fall Out Over Family House</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MAGGIE JACKSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   ``One half of the world cannot understand the
pleasures of the other,'' Jane Austen wrote in the village where she
spent her last years. Her brother's descendants are living those
words 175 years later, squabbling over a house she loved.
   The writer was a keen observer of families, misunderstandings and
money, and the tiff has thrown a bit of vintage Austen into the
peaceful world of her devotees. One Austen scholar said she would
have been amused.
   On one side is Richard Knight, president of the 1,200-member Jane
Austen Society and owner of the 50-room Chawton House inherited by
Jane's brother from the Knight family, who had adopted him.
   Richard Knight plans to offer Chawton House, where he was born,
for sale next week on a leasehold of up to 90 years. The British
system of leasehold permits the sale of property for a specified
amount of time, after which it reverts to the original owner.
   Henry Rice, a distant relative, and his supporters had hoped to
make the house in the village of Chawton into the world's first
research center on the author of ``Emma'' and ``Pride and
Prejudice.''
   They have raised nearly $1.5 million to buy the house, which Miss
Austen visited from her nearby Chawton Cottage, but they say Knight
refused to consider the offer.
   Rice and his friends hope to collect $6.2 million more for
repairs and other work but cannot meet Knight's price for the house
of $2.3 million.
   ``We were very disappointed,'' said Rice, a retired farmer who is
the great-great-great grandson of the author's niece and chairman of
the Jane Austen Center Trust, formed to set up the research center.
   ``We had hoped, particularly as he's president of the Jane Austen
Society, he would give serious thought to our offer,'' Rice said in
a telephone interview.
   Knight says he wants to keep the house in the family and does not
mind the idea of the center but must must sell because he cannot
afford the upkeep. He said Rice's group did not make the offer until
after the June 30 deadline he set.
   ``I have to bear two things in mind,'' he told The Associated
Press. ``I want to help Jane Austen and, on the other hand, I have
to look after my house and my family.''
   Chawton Cottage, which Jane Austen's brother Edward gave her
after inheriting it from the Knights, is a museum run by a private
trust not connected with the family. The trust refused comment on
the affair.
   She lived in the cottage for most of the six years before her
death in 1817, at age 42. There, she either wrote or rewrote her
major novels, which combine witty insights into human nature and
family life with social criticism and satire that sometimes is sharp.
   Some contemporaries criticized her work as limited, but the
Oxford Companion to English Literature says she has been venerated
since 1870.
   She was a minister's daughter, the sixth of seven children, and,
the Companion says, ``her life is notable for its lack of events.''
It notes that she never married and traveled little.
   Most of her life was spent in Hampshire, the county southwest of
London where Chawton is situated.
   Brian Southam, an expert on her work and a member of the Jane
Austen Center Trust, said he thought she would be entertained by the
ruckus.
   ``She would be amused because she was amused by all sorts of
mercenary matters, and doubly amused because it looks like a
difference in the family,'' he said.
   Rice also saw irony in the situation, but said he thought it
would sadden Miss Austen, as it did him.
   ``I think she'd be disappointed to see her brother's descendents
scrapping over the last piece of inheritance,'' he said, but then
managed a laugh and added: ``Maybe she'd write a good short story on
the matter.''

   A scuba diver who said he was sucked

settled his lawsuit against Florida Power and Light Co.
   ``Both parties jointly filed a stipulation that the case be
dismissed with prejudice, which means (Lamm) cannot refile,'' Robin
Blanton, an attorney for the utility, said.
   The parties agreed not to discuss terms of the settlement.
   But the diver, Bill Lamm of Vero Beach, said Thursday that
attorneys had told him he had a difficult case because he didn't
suffer damages.
   ``Almost everyone said that if I could get $5,000 or $10,000 I
should grab it,'' but he added that the settlement was ``nowhere''
near that amount.
   Several weeks after Lamm's ordeal, the utility announced
structural problems with the concrete slabs that cover the mouths of
two of the three pipes. The utility said holes had developed in the
slabs, creating a whirlpool at the mouth of the pipes.
   While utiltity officials maintained the slabs were intact June 5,
the day of Lamm's dive, an official with the Nuclear Regulatory
Commission later said the holes appeared to be caused by erosion _
and were probably open the day of Lamm's accident.

<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The lawyer representing purported Colombian
cocaine cartel money-launderer Eduardo Martinez Romero is no
stranger to publicity. In fact, it appears to seek him out.
   Ed Garland, 48, said he was contacted by Martinez's family while
Martinez was on his way to Atlanta from Colombia this week aboard a
Drug Enforcement Agency plane. Apparently, Garland said, a lawyer
friend of his in Miami made the referral.
   ``I'm just a defense lawyer, and I've been practicing law here
for 25 years,'' he said Thursday. ``I had no prior contact with
him.''
   Garland was at Martinez's side when the Colombian appeared
Thursday before a U.S. magistrate to answer charges of
money-laundering and conspiracy to defraud the government. Martinez
is accused of being the ``finance minister'' of the Medellin cocaine
cartel, allegedly the largest cocaine distribution group in the
world.
   After the hearing, Garland wasted no time in setting the stage
for his defense of Martinez _ if he takes the case for the duration.
   ``I think it will be extremely difficult for him to get a fair
trial,'' Garland said. ``My understanding is that he wasn't afforded
any judicial process. He was just picked up and brought here.''
   Over the years, Garland has represented numerous people charged
with drug offenses, ranging from former Atlanta Falcons running back
and broadcaster Harmon Wages to John Paul Sr. and John Paul Jr., a
world-class auto racing team accused of conspiring to smuggle
marijuana.
   A few years ago, Garland was convicted of criminal contempt in
Albany after telling a newspaper reporter _ outside the courtroom _
that a judge was holding a ``sham proceeding'' against his client.
That cost him $500, but the conviction was eventually overturned by
the Georgia Supreme Court.
   Garland, who attended law school at the University of Georgia,
told an interviewer in 1982 that he doesn't mind taking on the
government.
   ``My belief is if it's just me against the U.S. government, it's
a fair fight,'' he said. ``The system is balanced in favor of the
state and against the accused.''
   Famed defense lawyer F. Lee Bailey once said Garland was ``in the
top 25 criminal defense attorneys in the nation.''
   Although many of his clients have been connected to drug money,
Garland says he doesn't accept fees tainted by drugs if he knows
about it.
   ``You have to be concerned that you are not dealing with drug
money or money that's been tainted,'' he said Thursday. ``There are
very set ethical rules on that, and I observe those rules.''

<HEAD>Former Justice Official Wins $861,600 For Legal Fees</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A federal appeals court Friday awarded $861,600
in attorneys' fees to former Justice Department official Theodore
Olson, who was the focus of an independent counsel's investigation
in an Environmental Protection Agency case.
   Olson had sought $1.25 million for his lawyers, who successfully
defended him in a probe that began in January 1986 with a
preliminary investigation by the Justice Department.
   Independent counsel Alexia Morrison investigated Olson from April
1986 until last year to determine whether the former assistant
attorney general had testified falsely or obstructed Congress in
1983 when a congressional panel was seeking documents in the EPA
controversy.
   In awarding less than requested, an appeals court panel that
appoints independent counsels said the law firm of Jenner &amp; Block
billed Olson at its premium rate, but should have billed him at its
normal rate that is some $5 to $20 an hour lower. The court also
disallowed nearly $100,000 in requested fees for items such as the
preliminary probe by the Justice Department and the preparation of
the fee application to the court.
   Morrison concluded the Justice Department may have obstructed
congressional inquiries by withholding documents about the
toxic-waste cleanup Superfund, but that there was no evidence Olson
was a participant in any such obstruction.

   President Bush said Friday he will nominate
Alan Green Jr., an Oregon businessman, to be ambassador to Romania.
   Green, who was named Oregon Republican of the year in 1988, was
chairman of the Federal Maritime Commission during the first term of
the Reagan administration.
   He was chairman of the board of Tom Benson Industries Inc., in
Portland, a member of the board of directors of Comprehensive Care

   Bush also said he would nominmate Marion V. Creekmore, a senior

   Seven-course meals, a baby grand and original
artwork will greet travelers on a new luxury rail service between
Chicago and Washington, D.C.
   The American-European Express, combining elegance with
convenience, was modeled after the storied Orient Express, as
founder William F. Spann tries to recapture for Americans the
romance of railroad travel.
   ``It's not just a railroad era that's gone by, it's a luxury
era,'' Spann, of Panama City, Fla., said Friday. ``Basically, travel
has become a commodity and what we're trying to do is say ... part
of the American public wants something more than just
transportation.''
   Most of the travelers on today's Orient Express _ which travels
between London and Istanbul and between Paris and Tokyo _ are
Americans, Spann said.
   Passengers on the new stateside express are expected to include
``businessmen holding meetings, newlyweds, people having affairs,''
he said.
   ``We are really trying to say America can compete on a quality
basis with anybody in the world,'' he said. ``We're every bit as
sophisticated and we enjoy fine things as well.''
   The inaugural trip is scheduled to depart from Washington on Nov.
15.
   The express will run two shuttles, each with five renovated
Pullman cars added onto Amtrak's Capitol Limited. Overnight service
will be offered in both directions five days a week.
   Minumum one-way fare for the 17-hour trip is $695 _ $1,042 double
occupancy _ compared with $103 for the Amtrak coach or $356 per
person for the Amtrak sleeping car.
   The express ride includes a private bath, a shower compartment,
individually controlled air conditioning and heating, complimentary
robe and slippers, a facsimile machine and telephone.
   The dining cars are made from Honduran mahogany, decorated with
original artwork and outfitted with fine china and silver, he said.
   Seven-course dinners and full breakfasts are included in the
ticket price, he said.
   The luxury cars can hold 60 people and 13 staff, including the
piano player, said Spann, who organized the venture with European
businessmen.
   The company is spending $10 million to refurbish six sleeper, two
dining and two club cars _ all built in the 1940s. Amtrak does not
book reservations for the luxury cars. Passengers must contact
American-European Express directly.

<HEAD>US Deplores Rocket Attacks From Jordanian Territory</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The State Department deplored on Friday a
missile attack on Israel from Jordanian territory but said it could
not identify the perpetrators and did not plan to suspend its talks
with the Palestine Liberation Organization.
   The rockets slammed into fields in the northern Jordan valley and
caused no damage. The Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine,
a Marxist group affiliated with the PLO, claimed responsibility.
   PLO chairman Yasser Arafat renounced terrorism last year,
prompting the United States to begin talks that U.S. officials said
would be suspended if terrorism recurred.
   State Department spokeswoman Margaret Tutwiler said the United
States holds the PLO to its commitment renouncing terorism and
``deplores the rocket attack'' against Israel.
   However, the U.S. official said she did not know who had launched
the attack and that ``our dialogue continues.''
   The PFLP, formed 22 years ago, is headed by George Habash.
According to the State Department publication ``Terrorist Group
Proflies,'' it ``established itself early as one of the most violent
Palestinian terrorist groups.''
   Among the hijackings the department attributed to the
organization was the hijacking of an Air France airliner to Entebbe,
Uganda, in 1976. Four civilians were killed before Israeli
paratroopers were able to rescue the other passengers and crew. The
paratroop commander, Jonathan Netanyahu, was also killed in the
operation.

<TEXT>
   The Great Montana Centennial Cattle Drive,
a raucous remembrance of American frontier settlers, ambles through
city streets to its last roundup at the Billings stockyards Saturday
after herding 2,700 bawling longhorns across the prairie.
   The procession _ with 100 drovers tending the herd and 200
covered wagons and 3,000 dusty riders trailing behind _ headed
toward its final camp Friday. Many participants in the six-day,
60-mile drive believed they were making history as part of the
West's last great cattle drive.
   ``I'd hoped to see a few more cows and not so many people,'' said
Janet Kuni of Garden Grove, Calif. ``But this still kind of choked
me up a little bit. I'm never going to see anything like tonight
ever again.''
   The drive, the biggest spectacle in Montana's celebration of its
birthday as a state, commemorates the great cattle drives of the
last century, which began when Nelson Story brought the first herd
of Texas longhorns to Montana in 1866.
   Mike Story, Nelson Story's great-great-grandson, still ranches in
Montana near Yellowstone National Park and was among the drovers
heading the procession.
   But the drive's end will bear no resemblance to Nelson Story's
arrival in unsettled Montana.
   At least some of the wagons and cattle will parade through
Billings streets on their way to the Public Auctions Yards, heading
down three lanes of a six-lane thoroughfare.
   The journey started Monday on the banks of the Musselshell River
in Roundup. The drive, enjoying early fall weather of warm days and
brisk nights, rolled south on U.S. 87 through the Bull Mountains,
then on the prairie.
   The pace of the drive was brisk until Thursday, when wagons
spread out across the plain. As many as 20,000 people took advantage
of the only opportunity to see the drive actually crossing the
prairie, and 5,000 had to be turned away from a Thursday night
country music concert for lack of parking, authorities said.
   Red paint in the dirt marked the rows where cars and buses could
stop and watch the five-mile long train of cattle and wagons. A
mile-long plume of dust rose from the wagon train on the sunny fall
day, later creating a glowing sunset over the Bull Mountains.
   ``This is great,'' said Bill Toothman, who traveled with his wife
Violet from West Virginia to see the cattle drive. ``We saw it on
the `Today' show and knew we had to be here. So far it's been
everything we'd hoped for.''

   Ten workers died of burns and
asphyxiation when a fire swept through a meat-packing plant in San
Antonio, police said Friday.
   Police and firemen said they are investigating conflicting
reports about the origin of the blaze Thursday night at a plant
owned by Paraguayan industrialist Roberto Antebi. San Antonio is 22
miles south of this capital.
   Officials said unconfirmed reports indicate the fire was caused
by an electrical short circuit or welders working near coolant pipes.
   The victims, at work when the fire broke out, were trapped by a
dense cloud of smoke and rapidly spreading flames, officials said.

   Soldiers fatally shot a 13-year-old Palestinian
during a stone-throwing protest Friday, and three Arabs suspected of
collaborating with Israeli authorities were found dead in the
occupied territories.
   The army said it had arrested four Arabs in the slaying of one of
the alleged collaborators.
   Also Friday, a Syrian-backed Palestinian faction claimed
responsibility for firing rockets across the Jordanian border into
Israel a day earlier.
   In the Gaza Strip town of Khan Yunis, troops clashed with
stone-throwers and Akran Zaki Hamdan, 13, was killed, the army and
hospital officials said.
   Hamdan's death brought to 560 the number of Palestinians killed
by Israeli soldiers or civilians since the start of the uprising
against Israeli occupation nearly 21 months ago. Thirty-nine
Israelis have been killed.
   The deaths of the suspected collaborators raised to 110 the
number of Palestinians killed by fellow Arabs. Most have been
accused of collaboration.
   The slayings came despite an appeal by underground uprising
leaders in their latest leaflet. They asked Palestinian activists
not to be too quick to kill suspected collaborators.
   Cocern about security on the usually quiet Israel-Jordan border
rose this week following the rocket attack Thursday and a guerrilla
attack five days earlier in which two Israeli soldiers were killed.
   Israel radios and newspapers said military officials believed
Syria was behind both attacks.
   The first attack was claimed by the Syrian-based Taalat Yakoub
faction of the Palestine Liberation Front. The rocket attack was
claimed Friday in Damascus by the Marxist Popular Front for the
Liberation of Palestine, headed by George Habash.
   Zeev Schiff, a military analyst for the Haaretz daily, said Syria
may be using the border attacks to punish Jordan's King Hussein for
allowing Iraq to move weapons through Jordan to Christian forces in
Lebanon. The Christians are battling Syria's army.
   Schiff also said the Syrians ``are trying to stir up trouble''
between Israel and Jordan.
   In the occupied territories Friday, 14 Palestinians were shot and
wounded in stone-throwing clashes with Israeli troops, including an
11-year-old boy hit with a bullet in the head in the West Bank
village of Tubas, Arab reports said.
   The army announced a raid on the village of Beit Dajan, also in
the occupied West Bank, and said ``a great number'' of Palestinians
were arrested when Israel used helicopters to block suspects from
fleeing into surrounding hills.
   The army said last month it would begin using helicopters in
village raids aimed at rounding up activists in the uprising.
   Late Friday, 30-year-old Ahmed Izat Imran was found beaten and
stabbed to death under a tree near the village of Rujeib in the West
Bank, Arab sources said.
   Imran reportedly was abducted from his car Thursday night by
masked youths. A search was launched by relatives who later found
the body, reports said.
   In the occupied Gaza Strip, the two alleged collaborators who
were killed were identified as Niman Abu Hilal, 30, who was fatally
beaten at his home in Rafah by masked youths, and Jasser Al Krinawi,
24, whose body was found stuffed in a well in the Magazi refugee
camp.
   The army said four Arabs were taken into custody in connection
with the Krinawi case.

<HEAD>With AM-Reagan Surgery</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Here is a chronology of President Reagan's
health difficulties:
   _1967: While he was governor of California, Reagan had
approximately 30 seedlike stones removed from his urinary tract. He
had a transurethral prostatic resection, the same kind of operation
performed during his second presidential term in 1986.
   _1979: He complained of pain in the right thumb, which was
determined to be osteoarthritic.
   _March 30, 1981: A bullet fired at Reagan in an attempt on his
life hit him in the upper chest below the left arm, traveled
downward and was deflected into the left lung, coming to rest an
inch from his heart. He was rushed to George Washington University
Hospital, complaining of soreness in the rib cage. He collapsed in
the hospital corridor. The bullet was removed during three hours of
surgery and Reagan returned to the White House after 12 days in the
hospital.
   _April 1, 1982: Reagan underwent a routine urological examination
at Bethesda Naval Hospital after complaining of discomfort. Doctors
found no evidence of malignancy.
   _Sept. 7, 1983: Reagan, having grown noticeably hard of hearing,
was seen wearing a small hearing aid in his right ear when he
appeared before a group of business and education leaders. He has
attributed his hearing loss to the firing of a handgun too near his
ear on a movie set many years ago. Reagan later began wearing a
hearing aid in the left ear as well.
   _May 18, 1984: A small polyp was discovered in the president's
colon, but an examination showed the polyp was non-cancerous and it
was not removed.
   _March 11, 1985: The White House disclosed that doctors examining
Reagan earlier that month found evidence of blood in his stool and a
growth in his lower intestine. A statement said tests of occult, or
hidden, blood in the feces were positive but that ``physicians
believe this may be from the polyp or from diet and will be
monitored.''
   _March 29, 1985: Reagan suffered a burst blood vessel in his left
eye, causing it to fill partially with blood and appear red. White
House spokesman Larry Speakes said no treatment was needed.
   _July 12, 1985: Doctors removed a small, benign polyp from
Reagan's colon and found another, larger one that was removed the
following day along with 2 feet of the president's intestinal tract.
The larger, 2-inch, polyp was found to be cancerous, but doctors
said the cancer had not spread beyond the tissues that were removed.
   _Aug. 1, 1985: The White House, responding to questions, said an
irritated patch of skin had been removed from Reagan's nose two days
earlier. A statement said the tissue ``was submitted for routine
studies for infection, and it was determined no further treatment is
necessary.'' Four days later, he told a news conference that the
``pimple'' had been skin cancer.
   _Jan. 17, 1986: Reagan had three small polyps removed from his
intestine during a six-hour visit to Bethesda in his first major
post- cancer colonoscopy checkup. They were described as ``very
small,'' measuring 1 millimeter to 2 millimeters in size.
   A shaving of facial tissue from a growth on the right side of
Reagan's face was also taken. Lab tests showed that the three polyps
and facial tissue were benign.
   _June 21, 1986: In a five-hour visit to Bethesda, Reagan had two
small polyps removed from his colon. The growths, ranging in size
from 1 millimeter to 1.5 millimeters, were benign.
   Reagan also had an eye examination and a dermatological
examination of his nose, from which he has had two small skin
cancers removed.
   _Jan. 4, 1987: Reagan had four benign polyps removed from his
colon by doctors at Bethesda, and the president's physician, Army
Col. John Hutton, said tests ``show no evidence of a recurrence of
the cancer found in July 1985.''
   _Jan. 5, 1987: Reagan underwent successful prostate surgery. The
surgery, which removed nearly an ounce of tissue, was to relieve
what a spokesman called ``mild, recurring discomfort'' apparently
due to an enlarged prostate, a gland surrounding the urethra at the
base of the bladder.
   _June 26, 1987: Reagan had two small polyps removed from his
colon during an examination in the physician's office in the White
House. They were found to be benign. Dr. Hutton, said a routine
prostate exam was also performed as a follow-up to the president's
January surgery, and it ``was found to be entirely normal.''
   _Jan. 7, 1989: Reagan underwent surgery on his left ring finger
to correct a curvature known as Dupuytren's Contracture, a common
but deforming condition that caused his finger to fold inward.
   _July 4, 1989, Reagan, an accomplished rider, was thrown from a
horse while visiting a Mexican ranch near Cananea, about 30 miles
south of the Arizona border. He was flown by Army helicpter to a
U.S. military hospital in Arizona and kept about four hours,
declining a doctor's suggestion that he remain overnight for
observation.

   Radical students shouted
anti-government slogans and battled police with firebombs Friday to
protest the arrest of a student who made an illegal trip to
Communist North Korea to attend a youth festival.
   About 500 students at Dongguk University in Seoul fought police
with rocks and firebombs, demanding the release of the student, Im
Su-kyong. Police fired tear gas and broke up the protest in one hour.
   Five students were arrested but no injuries were reported.
   Miss Im was arrested on Aug 15 and faces the death penalty if
convicted of charges she consorted with North Korean intelligence
agents.
   At Yonsei University, also in Seoul, 200 students blocked traffic
on a main street in front of their school for an hour, shouting
``Release Miss Im!'' While riot police watched, students unfurled a
large banner reading ``Abolish national security laws.''
   In the southern city of Kwangju, about 1,000 students occupied a
section of a railway near Chosun University and delayed an outbound
passenger train for 35 minutes, the Yonhap News Agency said.
   Police fired volleys of tear gas to break up the crowd, the South
Korean news agency said. Two students were injured by fragments from
exploding tear gas canisters, it said.
   In Taegu, President Roh Tae-woo's hometown 175 miles southeast of
Seoul, 200 student radicals fought police with rocks and firebombs
for one hour before dispersing voluntarily. They also demanded Miss
Im's release.
   Friday's clashes followed a government announcement accusing
North Korea of manipulating dissident movements in South Korea
through its organizations in Europe, Australia and the United States.
   The Agency for National Security Planning, the main government
intelligence organization, said Miss Im's illegal trip to North
Korea in July resulted from the North's manipulation.
   North Korea, the agency said, mobilized several pro-communist
Korean organizations in the United States, West Germany and
Australia to get a South Korean radical student group to send a
delegate to the world youth festival in the North Korean capital of
Pyongyang in July.
   The festival was July 1-8.
   Miss Im was arrested when she returned to the South Aug. 15. She
is charged with other violations ranging from receiving money from
Communist agents to going to the North under Communist orders. If
found guilty on all charges, she could be sentenced to death.
   Radical students regard the South Korean government as a
dictatorship supported by the United States and are demanding the
withdrawal of the 43,000 U.S. troops stationed in the South.
   South Korean bans unauthorized trips to North Korea, an enemy
country since the division of the Korean Peninsula in 1945. The
North invaded the South to start the 1950-53 Korean War, and a peace
treaty was never signed.

   Radio and television talk show host Larry King
told a magazine interviewer he wouldn't mind meeting the right woman
and getting married again. And he did just that before the magazine
hit the stands.
   ``I don't think I'm suited to marriage,'' he said in an interview
published in Good Housekeeping's October issue. ``Sometimes I worry
I'm too selfish to have a relationship. I'm not really.''
   But that interview was conducted months before his engagement
last month to Philadelphia businesswoman Julie Alexander, whom he
plans to wed Oct. 7. They met July 11 and he proposed after their
first date Aug. 1.
   ``So anyone who reads the Good Housekeeping article, should know
that all that changed when I met Julie,'' he said by phone Friday
from his Virginia home. ``They should put a banner on the cover of
the magazine: that July 11 changed my world.''
   King, 55, has been married three times _ twice to the same woman.
   King, seen on the CNN television network and heard on the Mutual
radio network, told the magazine he thought he'd stay single for a
while.
   ``Still, I only know I would have loved to have fallen asleep and
then woken up this morning with my arms around a woman I love,'' he
said. ``I feel something is missing in my life ... some woman who
would keep me excited about her, about us, about life.
   ``Yes, I'd love to find a woman who can do all that and at the
same time still not bug me,'' he said with a laugh. ``I think I'm
going to be sleeping alone for a while, a long while.''

   A 19-year-old reputed gang leader who pleaded
guilty to car theft and robbery has been sentenced to go to school
instead of jail.
   The alternative sentence a Suffolk Superior Court judge imposed
Thursday infuriated prosecutors, who said it would send the wrong
message to inner-city gangs. But a defense lawyer said it would give
the defendant, who dropped out of school in 10th grade, a chance to
turn his life around.
   Judge Cortland A. Mathers warned Christopher Chaney that if he
does not finish high school and go on to junior college, hold a job
after school and stay out of trouble for five years, he will be sent
to prison for four years.
   ``If you slip up, you will go to Concord (state prison),'' the
judge said. ``You would get absolutely no consideration from me if
you come in here before me again.''
   Police said Chaney was second-in-command of the Humboldt Street
Gang, one of the toughest groups in the city's crime-infested
Roxbury section. Chaney pleaded guilty to six charges of robbery,
car theft and receiving a stolen car. At the time of the crimes, he
was on probation for assault with a deadly weapon and receiving
stolen property, police said.
   ``In my opinion, this was the wrong person to give a break to. He
committed six crimes in six months,'' said Assistant District
Attorney Daniel Conley.
   The prosecution had recommended Chaney receive a 20-year prison
sentence and serve two years. Mathers gave Chaney a choice of
serving two years or accepting his proposal.
   ``That was a sentence? I think the judge is trying to be
innovative, but I don't think he's being realistic,'' said First
Assistant District Attorney Paul Leary.
   ``I think that the sentence imposed sends out the wrong message
to the decent people in the community who are being terrorized by
these gang members,'' Leary added.
   Chaney's court-appointed lawyer, Marjory German, argued that
Chaney, if given a chance, could become a role model for other young
black men.
   ``We have heard from police and prosecutors that the only way to
deal with these young black men is to lock them up,'' Ms. German
said. ``The black community is tired of this, tired of having young
black males taken away from them.
   ``The only way out of this vicious cycle for the community, for
all of us, is in education. We know that locking up young black men
has not worked. We've known that for years. It breaks up families,''
she said.
   Deborah A. Ramirez, a professor at Northeastern Law School in
Boston, said alternative sentences are becoming increasingly common
for people who have no prior criminal records, did not commit
violent crimes and are ``low-level (drug) users and victims, rather
than dealers and kingpins.''
   But she said Chaney did not fit those categories and would almost
certainly have received a jail term if he had been prosecuted in
federal rather than state court.

<TEXT>
   The 35 signers of the 1975 Helsinki
agreements on European security have agreed in principle to the
first exchange of information about their military programs, a U.S.
representative said Friday.
   John J. Maresca added, however, that NATO and the Warsaw Pact
still disagreed on whether naval and air forces should be included.
Maresca is chief U.S. delegate to the 35-nation talks on enhancing
security in Europe.
   ``I believe that these negotiations are now well positioned to
move forward,'' he told fellow negotiators at the beginning of the
third round of talks. ``However, we must be realistic.''
   ``The common ground which has emerged over the first two rounds
can only lead to an early positive conclusion if proposals which are
unlikely to attract consensus are put aside. This will undoubtedly
be the most difficult task before us,'' he said.
   A copy of his speech was made available to The Associated Press.
   Soviet negotiators insist that naval and air forces be included,
but NATO says they never were meant to be part of the negotiations
and would further complicate an already complex task.
   ``Nobody can conduct a war in Europe with naval forces. ... War
can take place only on land,'' Maresca told a news conference after
the closed negotiating session.
   Maresca said de facto agreement has been reached in some areas at
the talks, which involve the 16 members of the North Atlantic Treaty
Organization, the seven-nation Warsaw Pact and 12 countries that are
neutral or profess non-alignment.
   Running parallel in Vienna are NATO-Warsaw Pact negotiations on
reducing conventional forces in Europe, which resumed Thursday.
   ``The principle of a regular exchange of information has now, I
believe, been broadly accepted,'' but still to be worked out are how
to set up a data bank and what information to share on troop
deployments, weapons procurement and other military subjects,
Maresca told the reporters.
   ``A breakthrough has been made with acceptance in principle that
there should be such an exchange,'' he said. ``This represents an
important step forward which can only have a positive effect on the
range of arms control talks currently under way.''
   NATO suggested such an exchange at negotiations in early June.
   Maresca said there also appeared to be agreement in principle for
a seminar on military policies, which he described as ``the first
multilateral government-to-government exchange on military policies
ever held.''

   First Lady Barbara Bush on Friday helped
launch a 10-year U.N. program to end illiteracy, a handicap
affecting one-fourth of the world's people.
   At U.N. headquarters, she joined families from dozens of nations
celebrating International Literacy Day and looking ahead to 1990,
designated International Literacy Year by the General Assembly.
   Mrs. Bush bantered with ``Rex and Rita Saurus,'' the dinosaur
puppet mascots of the Read America-Win America Foundation used to
encourage family reading.
   ``Rita'' asked Mrs. Bush if all her grandchildren read together
when they visited her and President Bush during their recent
vacation in Kennebunkport, Maine.
   ``We all read together, all 11 of them, and they read to each
other,'' she told the bug-eyed orange puppet.
   Since 1980, Mrs. Bush has been an active advocate of reading
programs, traveling extensively to support their efforts.
   Ninety-eight percent of illiteracy is found in Third World
nations, but even in developed countries more than 100 million
children of primary school age do not go to school.
   In highly industrialized countries, about 10 percent of adults
are functional illiterates, unable to cope in complex society,
particularly when technological change forces them out of unskilled
jobs.
   According to the U.N. Educational, Scientific and Cultural
Organization, Africa has the highest rate of adult illiteracy, at 54
percent, followed by 36 percent in Asia and 17 percent in Latin
America.
   In 1985, more than 890 million adults were illiterate, more than
a quarter of the adult population in Africa, according to UNESCO.
The majority of the illiterates are women. U.N. documents do not
estimate how many children are illiterate.
   The United Nations plans to work through existing literacy
programs and hold a World Conference on Education for All in March,
1990, in Bangkok, Thailand, to set up strategy for the literacy
effort.

<TEXT>
   The chief regulator of national banks proposed
a new capital rule Friday that he says will discourage banks from
making risky investments, but a rival regulator accused him of
trying to weaken the standard for most banks.
   Comptroller of the Currency Robert L. Clarke, whose agency
regulates about 4,000 federally-chartered banks, proposed a 3
percent minimum capital standard, or leverage ratio, as part of a
larger risk-based capital rule that takes effect at the end of 1990.
   Capital put at risk by bank and S&amp;L owners acts as a buffer,
absorbing an institution's losses before federal deposit insurance
kicks in. One of the key reforms in savings and loan legislation
enacted last month was an increase in S&amp;Ls' required capital levels.
   Current rules require commerical banks to hold 6 percent capital
against their loans and other investments. However, under new rules
taking effect Dec. 31, 1990, banks will have to work up to 8 percent
capital.
   But they won't have to have hold any capital against such nearly
riskless assets as cash and government securities and they will get
a break on capital for investing in residential mortgages.
   To prevent banks from using the risk-adjustments to severely
reduce their overall capital, Clarke on Friday proposed a 3 percent
minimum standard, or leverage ratio.
   However, Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. Chairman L. William
Seidman, whose agency insures bank and S&amp;L deposits, is pushing for
a 6 percent leverage ratio as a floor beneath the 8 percent
risk-based standard.
   Seidman, speaking to a group of lawyers and accountants, said
weak standards helped cause the savings and loan crisis and Clarke's
proposal would in effect weaken the standard for 90 percent of the
nation's banks.
   ``It's rather clear in my mind that ... changing standards to
reduce capital did not work out well in the last experiment when we
tried it,'' Seidman said, referring to a regulatory decision in the
early 1980s to reduce S&amp;Ls' capital.
   However, Clarke maintained his proposal was stricter than current
rules and said setting the leverage ratio too high would negate the
risk-adjusted standard, removing the incentive banks have to move
into less speculative investments.
   He told reporters at a briefing that his position is supported by
both the Treasury Department and the Federal Reserve Board, which
regulates bank holding companies.
   Under the comptroller's proposal, about 800 of 13,500 state and
federal banks nationally will have to raise capital or restructure
their portfolios, compared with 475 that are short now. Clarke
estimated more than 1,000 would fall short under Seidman's proposal.
   The three bank regulators _ the comptroller, the Fed and the FDIC
_ have traditionally coordinated their capital policies. Clarke said
a common standard is desirable, but he was not committed to
achieving an agreement before adopting rules for national banks,
probably by the end of the year.
   That raises the possibility that stricter rules would apply to
state-chartered banks whose primary regulator is the FDIC, putting
the state banks at a competitive disadvantage.
   The debate among banking regulators is further complicated by the
new S&amp;L law requiring that S&amp;L capital standards be ``no less
stringent'' than bank standards.
   S&amp;L regulators estimate that about 1,400 of 2,700 solvent thrift
institutions would fail a 6 percent leverage ratio, while only 600
would miss a 3 percent standard.

   Two masked bandits apparently got away with
nothing more than a certified mail pickup in a holdup in which an
armored car guard was slain and two other men were wounded,
authorities said Friday.
   Police and the FBI continued hunting for the robbers, who fled on
10-speed bicycles following Thursday's robbery at Bank of America's
world headquarters.
   The mail consisted of ``paperwork, possibly some negotiable bonds
and possibly a small amount of currency,'' said police spokesman
Dave Ambrose. ``It's not a major loss.''
   ``This was not a classic armored car robbery,'' said FBI
spokesman Chuck Latting. ``Everything I see, after 20 years as an
agent, says they made a grave mistake.''
   If caught and convicted of murder, the two men could receive the
death penalty.
   The bandits confronted and shot Brink's Inc. guards Joseph
Arriola, 53, and Clifford Spencer, 24, after they had made their
delivery Thursday morning to a bank on the lower level of the
52-story building, according to Ambrose.
   Arriola and Spencer were shot in the head at very close range
beyond the view of a video camera facing the bank lobby. Robert Gee,
a 57-year-old San Franciscan, was shot in the mouth as he tried to
help the felled guards. Arriola died.
   The robbers, described as two white men with muscular builds,
escaped into the city's crowded financial district on bicycles,
which police recovered about 10 blocks away five hours later.
   Some investigators, who had said the heist had been well planned
and well orchestrated, said Friday they were puzzled by the attack
that apparently netted so little.
   Latting pointed out that the bandits confronted the guards after
they delivered money to the bank, targeted a bank in the heart of
the city's chronically congested financial district and could not
have carried a large amount of cash away on bicycles.
   ``All that doesn't add up,'' he said, adding that authorities are
considering all potential motives.
   Brink's has offered a $100,000 reward for information leading to
the arrest and conviction of the suspects.
   Spencer was in serious but stable condition Friday at San
Francisco General Hospital, said hospital spokeswoman Gloria
Rodriguez. The guard underwent surgery for paralysis to his left
side, but Rodriguez did not know if it had succeeded.
   Gee was in good condition with a fractured tooth and a cut
tongue, the spokeswoman said.

<HEAD>Crab Robbers Must Wear Signs</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PALATKA, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Four young men caught raiding crab traps
will have to parade around Palatka for four consecutive Saturdays
wearing placards proclaiming their crime.
   ``It is a felony, punishable by five years in prison and-or a
$5,000 fine to molest crab pots,'' the signs say. ``I know because I
molested one.''
   Stephen Michael Kittredge, a 23-year-old insurance salesman from
Jacsonville, was one of four men caught raiding traps in the St.
Johns River.
   Too much beer and too little common sense were to blame, he said.
   ``It was Memorial Day weekend. We were just a bunch of guys
having a good old time,'' he said. ``We were probably a little bit
drunk. We were wrong, we readily admit we were very wrong.''
   Kittredge, John Shiver Snelling, 24; Gregory Coleman Dyer, 24;
and David Todd Harris, 23; avoided criminal prosecution by agreeing
to prosecutors' demands that they march with the placards.
   The signs must be on poster board-size placards and readable from
100 feet.
   But the fisherman who lost about 25 crabs said the punishment is
not enough for his loss.
   ``I'm still so ... mad I could slap one of them and not flinch,''
said Robert Scholl, who has been crabbing for 17 years.
   Each of the four men also must pay Scholl five times the cost of
the damage to the traps and the lost crabs. The amount has not been
determined.
   The punishment _ reminiscent of the scarlet ``A'' adulterer
Hester Prynne had to wear in Nathaniel Hawthorne's novel ``The
Scarlet Letter'' _ was concocted by State Attorney John Tanner. It
was accepted by the men in a deferred prosecution agreement that
does not need the victim's approval.

<HEAD>Judge Strikes Down Rule Preventing Clerk-Cop Marriages in Same Town</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   New Jersey must bow to the laws of love, a
federal judge ruled Friday in striking down a state rule forbidding
marriage between police officers and municipal court clerks working
in the same town.
   In sweeping language, U.S. District Judge Nicholas H. Politan
gave his blessing to the union of Joseph and Marie Hughes of North
Arlington. Hughes, a detective, is an 18-year veteran of the town
police force; he met Mrs. Hughes, a municipal court clerk since
1981, in the court's hallways.
   They married in July 1988 and informed state court
administrators, who told them one would have to resign. The couple
sued and were allowed to remain in their jobs pending a court
decision.
   The rule was designed to prevent a conflict of interest, but
Politan rejected that justification.
   ``No law, regardless of intent, should have a `chilling effect'
upon marriage,'' the judge wrote in his opinion. ``The Court should
encourage legitimate marriage, not discourage it.''
   Such ``broad brush regulations ... suggest mechanical,
computer-like answers to human problems of constitutional
dimensions.''
   Mrs. Hughes said more than 10 couples with similar problems
across New Jersey had contacted her about the case.
   ``It's going to make a lot of people out there happy,'' she said
at the courthouse after picking up the opinion with her lawyers. She
said she knew of clerks who had resigned or taken demotions over the
law.
   Dorothy Crissey, president of the state Municipal Court Clerk's
Association, said the group supported the couple's fight. New Jersey
has about 1,000 municipal clerks and deputy clerks.
   ``You have an awful lot of people who have met and fallen in love
and have not been able to a lead a normal life,'' she said.
   Michael L. Diller, the deputy attorney general who handled the
case for the state, did not immediately return a telephone message.
   The rule, set by the Administrative Office of the Courts, says no
spouse, parent or child of a police officer can be a municipal clerk
or deputy clerk, with exceptions for officer-clerk relationships
that began before the rule took effect in 1977.
   Politan said the rule violated the Hughes' constitutional rights
to due process and equal protection. He recognized the state's
interest in preserving conflict-free appearances, but said the right
to marriage outweighs the rule. He also noted that a court clerk
could easily step aside from a case involving a spouse.
   James Katz, lawyer for Millville's court clerk and a city officer
who live together awaiting another federal judge's ruling on their
challenge of a related rule preventing cohabitation, said Politan's
opinion would help their case.
   ``More importantly, it's sending a message that the (court
administrative office) should keep its eyes and hands out of the
bedrooom,'' he said.

<HEAD>First Decline in Borrowing Reported Since 1987</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: New material thruout</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN D. McCLAIN</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   The economic slowdown caught up with American
consumers in July as they paid off $280 million more in credit than
they borrowed, the government reported Friday. It was the first
reduction in consumer debt in 2{ years.
   But analysts predicted the decline in borrowing was temporary
and, considering other reports indicating continued although slower
ecnomic growth, should pick up in the months ahead.
   ``It does confirm the economy slowed down in July,'' said John
Silvia, an economist and vice president at Kemper Financial Services
in Chicago. ``But that's past history, a temporary thing.''
   The Federal Reserve Board said consumer credit in July declined
at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 0.5 percent, down from
June's 4.7 percent gain. But even the June advance was revised
downward from 5.1 percent, falling from $2.99 billion to $2.72
billion.
   The July decline was the first since January 1987, when consumer
debt fell $1.63 billion, or 3.4 percent.
   Despite a general economic slowdown due to Federal Reserve
efforts to stem inflation, consumer spending _ which accounts for
two-thirds of all economic activity _ has continued at a relatively
fast pace.
   Borrowing kept up, with consumer credit rising 7.3 percent in May
after gaining 4.8 percent in April, 6.6 percent in March and 9.5
percent in February.
   Consumer credit increased 8.5 percent over all of 1988.
   Suggesting the July debt decline was temporary, Silvia said,
``Employment growth, income growth, consumer confidence surveys all
indicate continued consumer growth.''
   Silvia said the Commerce Department's report on August retail
sales next Friday ``will give us a better feel. They should be up 1
percent.''
   Sandra Shaber of The Futures Group in Washington also foresaw a
pickup in consumer credit, saying auto sales had begun to rise in
July and ``rose a hefty amount in August.''
   Auto loans, which fell for the second straight month, contributed
most to the July credit cutback, the Fed reported. They were down 6
percent following a 2.3 percent decline in June.
   The central bank said that borrowing for auto purchases dropped
$1.46 billion in July after declining $549 million a month earlier.
Auto loans had risen 4.5 percent in May and 3.3 percent in April.
   Borrowing for mobile homes continued its descent, down for the
sixth consecutive month. Loans declined by $60 million, or 3 percent
on an annual basis. That followed drops of 13.4 percent in June, 2.1
percent in May, 2.8 percent in April, 8.2 percent in March and 2.9
percent in February.
   Bank and credit union loans not secured by real estate also
dropped, down $26 million, a decrease of 0.2 percent. That compared
with a 2.5 percent advance in June and a 7.2 percent gain in May.
   The category of debt that includes credit cards continued to rise
_ but at a slower pace than in previous months. It was up 8.0
percent to $1.27 billion. Revolving debt had advanced 20.1 percent
to $3.12 billion in June after increasing 13 percent in May and 11
percent in April.
   The various changes left total consumer debt in July at a
seasonally adjusted $700.57 billion.

   It will be kept by Baker until the embassy is reopened, the State
Department said in a brief announcement.
   McCarthy recommended the evacuation of the embassy earlier this
week. Baker and President Bush concurred and all the Americans left.
   The State Department spokeswoman, Margaret D. Tutwiler, blamed
the evacuation on Gen. Michel Aoun, a Christian army commander, and
his followers, who are in a war with Syrian-backed Moslems.
   She said the general had threatened to take Americans hostage and
that the demonstrators had blockaded the embassy. Aoun disputed the
allegations.

<HEAD>Kemp Prepares Ethics Code for Housing Department</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Housing Secretary Jack Kemp said Friday his
agency is developing a new code of ethics to prevent the type of
scandals that have plagued the Department of Housing and Urban
Development in recent months.
   ``My first order is to clean house, stem to stern,'' Kemp told a
committee of the National League of Cities.
   Federal and congressional investigators are looking at
allegations of fraud and mismanagement that may have cost the
government billions of dollars in HUD money.
   The actions occurred before Kemp took office earlier this year,
but much of his attention has been focused on cleaning up the
problem, he told the urban representatives.
   ``When I came to HUD, I didn't know about the problems I had,''
he said.
   Kemp said his agency is putting the final touches on ``a program
of ethics'' that is intended to prevent future scandals. He did not
spell out the details.
   But he said the investigation of alleged abuses during the Reagan
administration is hindering his ability to get his own programs off
the ground. His ideas for economic revitalization of the nation's
cities won't be put into practice unless future scandals can be
prevented.
   ``We won't get anything done on Capitol Hill unless we clean
house and get our house in order,'' he said.
   Noting that 1989 is the 25th anniversary of the late President
Lyndon Johnson's ``War on Poverty,'' Kemp said the nation's cities
have not gotten enough help.
   ``As a Republican, I've been disappointed over the years that my
party has not addressed the issues'' of urban America, he said,
adding, ``I'm not here to do a mea culpa.''

   Royal Britain, the London museum that depicts history through

   A meeting Thursday night between Lovell and the Earl of Bradford,
who is the chairman of Unicorn Heritage, which owns Royal Britain,
came up with a compromise, marketing director Kim Keble-White said.
   ``We have allowed James to continue with some of his contemporary

Keble-White said.
   Lovell, who worked as a clown and stage actor before taking the
role in January of Will Somers, Henry VIII's jester, was not

<HEAD>Band Director Arrested in Bank Robbery, Confesses to Four Others</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHARLESTON, W.Va. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A popular high school band director
confessed to robbing four banks after his attempt to holdup a fifth
was stymied by bank employees who recognized him, authorities said.
   Donald R. Hershberger, band leader at George Washington High
School, was arrested Thursday and charged with aggravated robbery
and kidnapping after he attempted to rob the Second Avenue Bank in
South Charleston, Detective David Dunlap said.
   Hershberger, 54, then confessed to four robberies in West
Virginia since May, police said. It was not known how much money was
taken in the robberies.
   Hershberger will be suspended with pay while the charges are
pending, said Kanawha County Schools Superintendent Richard Trumble.
Hershberger's annual salary is $24,646.
   Colleagues on Friday described Hershberger as a personable man
who conducted his job with military efficiency.
   ``He was a task master with the students, he worked them
extremely hard,'' school principal Larry Lohan said.
   ``On the surface, everything appeared to be normal,'' Lohan said.
``He was a quick witted, personable guy. He'd zing you in a second.''
   The principal said students were shocked by Hershberger's arrest.
   ``I met with the band's group leaders this morning and I
explained to them that they were in for a rough time,'' Lohan said.
``I told them that they are going to hear all kinds of comments and
teasing. I'm kind of glad that we're going to be playing out of town
tonight.
   Some students reacted with disbelief.
   ``Are you serious,'' band member Elaine Harris said when
interviewed by WSAZ-TV. ``Wait a minute, this is a joke, right?''
   Police were called to the bank shortly before noon when bank
employees recognized Hershberger from photographs distributed after
the previous robberies, said Brenda Robertson, the bank's president.
   ``Believe it or not, I knew what he was going to do,'' said
Jennings Burch, an assistant bank vice president. ``Before he had a
chance to tell me we were being robbed ... I said, `Have a seat in
my office and I'll be with you in a second.' I went and told our
president, `The bank robber's here. Go call the police.'''
   Burch said the man tried to take him as a hostage, but he broke
free when police arrived. After his arrest, Hershberger admitted
robbing two banks in Charleston and one each in Buckhannon and
Bridgeport since May, Dunlap said.
   In all the robberies, police said, the suspect was described as
wearing a fishing hat, sunglasses and khaki pants.
   Hershberger, who was carrying a small-caliber pistol, is being
held without bail in the Kanawha County Jail pending a hearing Sept.
15.
   The telephone at Hershberger's home was repeatedly busy Friday.
Lohan said Hershberger's wife recently joined him in Charleston.
   Lohan said he hired Hershberger in the summer of 1988 after
receiving excellent references. Hershberger worked as a band
director in Phillipi, Elkins, Weirton; Christiansburg, Va., and
Zanesville, Ohio.
   ``He came highly recommended as a quality band instructor,''
Lohan said. ``I've had nothing other than that kind of performance
from him.''
   ``I really like the guy. He was no-nonsense,'' said John Van
Camp, a music teacher at George Washington. ``Whatever motivated
him, if he's done it, must have been some pretty heavy duty stuff.''

<TEXT>
   A hiker from Great Britain
who was stranded for 15 days with a broken leg in a remote section
of Yosemite National Park was airlifted to safety Friday.
   John Edward Hebden of Cheshire, England, spent seven hours
crawling up a ravine Thursday to a trail where he was found by
hikers who gave him some candy bars, then went to a ranger station
for help.
   Hebden, 20, had failed several times to make it to the top f the
ravine since he slipped on loose gravel and broke his right leg on
Aug. 24, said park spokeswoman Lisa Dapprich.
   ``He's in excellent shape; it's just amazing,'' Dapprich said.
``He only had enough food for several nights.''
   Rangers hiked in to Hebden, near the 9,000-foot elevation
Thursday night, then directed a helicopter crew to the spot Friday
morning.
   Hebden's ordeal began the second day of his hike from Yosemite
Valley 150 miles southeast of San Francisco into the high country
along routes called Sunrise Trail and Cloud's Rest Trail. Hebden had
reached the summit of the Sierra Nevada and was on his way down the
eastern slope when he lost the trail and started down a ravine where
he thought it should be, Dapprich said.
   While trying to cross a section of bare rock, Hebden slipped and
fell on loose gravel and was knocked out. When he came to, he
managed to get into his sleeping bag despite severe pain in his
upper right leg.
   He spent two days in the bag fighting the pain, before managing
to put his tent up, Dapprich added. Hebden got drinking water from a
stream nearby.
   Hebden said he hollered constantly, but apparently no one heard
him.

   The meter is ticking for parking
scofflaws in this cash-poor city, and officials pledged Friday that
the one-night jail stay of a woman arrested for owing more than
$4,500 is just the beginning.
   The woman topped two lists of alleged violators released by the
city and published in the newspaper over the past two months.
   The approach isn't winning rave reviews from some of the targets.
   ``It's almost like the 10 most wanted people in the world,'' said
Betty Lichenstein, a Holyoke School Committee member on the list for
52 delinquent tickets for a total of $1,040.
   Lichtenstein said she tried to work out a payment plan with
officials after appearing on the list about a month ago, but was
told only full payment would spare her the embarrassment of a second
appearance.
   ``It's causing a lot of grief in my life,'' she said. ``Cocaine
and crack dealers, they don't always get their names in the papers.''
   City officials are delighted with the program. An estimated
$200,000 has been collected in unpaid fines since the start of the
fiscal year.
   The fine for downtown parking meter violations is $10, while
parking in prohibited zones is $15.
   ``The word is on the street that we mean business, that's the
crux of the whole matter,'' parking clerk Kevin Kelliher said
Thursday. ``We're going to go after the money and come hell or high
water we're going to get them.''
   The city laid off more than 850 workers after voters turned down
a measure that would have allowed a property tax increase.
   The published list of 139 ranged from $627 owed on 10 tickets to
the $4,585 on 227 tickets owed by 30-year-old Noreen D. Perrault,
who spent Wednesday night in jail after she was arrested on a civil
complaint.
   Perrault, of West Springfield, was released on her own
recognizance after pleading innocent Thursday. Her lawyer, Mark
Kolber, said there would be no comment.
   Conviction of a ticket violation carries no jail sentence, city
solicitor John Payne said. ``We'll be looking for payment of the
fine, if she's found in violation,'' he said.
   Some parkers have complained at City Council meetings that spaces
are scarce downtown and the alternatives are pricey garages.
   Tim Sheehan, aide to Mayor Mary Hurley, said the city can't
afford to overlook the revenue, and people have plenty of time to
avoid getting on the published lists.
   ``We've issued warning after warning after warning and I don't
know of too many people in the city of Springfield who do not know
that this list is being published,'' he said.

<HEAD>Former PTL Backer Says He Felt Cheated by Bakker</HEAD>

   A minister testified Friday he felt
``robbed and cheated'' when he bought lifetime partnerships from
television evangelist Jim Bakker for lodging in a hotel that was
never built.
   After Bakker's trial recessed for the day, the same judge
sentenced two former Bakker aides to up to 18 years in prison and
fined them $500,000 each for tax evasion.
   The Rev. Alan Foor, pastor of the United Church of Christ in
Beavertown, Pa., testified at Bakker's trial that he was a monthly
contributor to Bakker's PTL, but became angry when he learned how
well Bakker lived.
   Foor's testimony wrapped up this week's court proceedings on
charges that Bakker used nearly $4 million in ministry funds to
finance an extravagant lifestyle. Prosecutors say Bakker used funds
from the sale of partnerships in his hotels.
   Partners, who gave at least $1,000, were told they were
guaranteed a certain number of nights per year in a hotel at the
ministry's Heritage USA retreat near Fort Mill, S.C.
   When court recessed for the day at lunch, Bakker and his wife,
Tammy, waved to a crowd of 300 people outside the courthouse.
   ``I'm going to get some rest,'' Bakker said. Thursday was the
first full day of testimony after the trial resumed following
Bakker's breakdown and commitment to a federal prison for
psychiatric evaluation last week.
   Bakker's former personal aide, David Taggart, was sentenced to 18
years and five months in prison and fined $500,000. His brother,
James Taggart, PTL's former interior decorator, was sentenced to 17
years and nine months and fined $500,000. They were convicted in
July and faced up to 25 years in prison and fines of $1 million each.
   ``White collar criminals seem to get away with extremely light
sentences,'' U.S. District Judge Robert Potter said before imposing
sentence. ``It's time we do something about that.''
   The Taggarts were convicted of evading taxes on $1.1 million in
PTL funds that they used to pay for personal luxuries, such as a
Trump Tower apartment in New York, Jaguar cars, Cartier watches and
Gucci items.
   The Taggarts left the courthouse without speaking to reporters.
   In 1986, Foor said, he saw Bakker on the PTL Club television
show, touting the Tower Club and the Victory Warrior memberships.
   Foor testified that on June 18, 1986, he sent $1,000 charged on a
credit card, saying that was the last day of a promotion offering
two memberships for the price of one.
   ``The way I understood it, I was buying into a time share for
four days and three nights each year,'' Foor said. But he said he
never was able to use the lodging because the hotel wasn't completed.
   Foor said he became angry when PTL sent him a letter asking that
he buy another partnership.
   Foor said he disagreed with Bakker's rationale of blaming his
problems on the devil.
   ``How dumb does he think people are,'' Foor wrote in a letter to
PTL in April 1987, about a month after Bakker resigned from PTL
because of a sexual scandal.
   He wrote that he earned $18,000 a year, and loved and forgave the
Bakkers but added: ``Until I see a better and more honest use of my
money, I will withhold my contributions.''
   He said he got a response from PTL asking him to call. But he
decided later to file a claim with U.S. Bankruptcy Court, as a
number of other partners did.
   Outside the courtroom, Foor said he felt sorry for the Bakkers.
``My heart goes out to them,'' he said.
   But he quickly added that if someone commits a crime, he has to
``pay his dues.''
   ``The biggest thing I wanted to hear was Jim and Tammy to say
that they made a mistake,'' Foor said. ``I never heard that. ... I
feel I was duped.''
   In Richmond Va., a federal appeals court Friday denied Bakker's
motion for a stay of his trial. The 4th U.S. Circuit Court of
Appeals also rejected Bakker's motion to dismiss the indictment
against him.

   Nobel Peace laureate Mother Teresa
suffered a heart attack Friday morning, three days after being
admitted to a hospital, but her doctor said her condition has
stabilized.
   Cardiologist A. Bardhaniding added that the 79-year-old Roman
Catholic nun was in intensive care at Woodlands Hospital, but
refused to give details.
   The official All-India Radio said Mother Teresa, known worldwide
for her work with the poor, was alert and was visited briefly by the
governor of West Bengal state. Nuns at the Missionaries of Charity,
which Mother Teresa founded in this east Indian city in 1950, said
she was progressing well.
   ``Her heart is much better and her temperature is practically
normal,'' said one nun, speaking on condition of anonymity.
   Mother Teresa became ill Sunday night but insisted on attending
Mass on Monday. Her condition deteriorated and on Tuesday she was
admitted to the private hospital with a high fever and an irregular
heart beat.
   Born in Yugoslavia, she has traveled widely since winning the
Nobel Peace Prize in 1979.
   The order she founded now includes 3,000 nuns in 87 countries.

   Police completed an investigation Friday of six
Israelis suspected of training gunmen for Colombian cocaine barons.
Army radio said several may be charged with illegally exporting
military expertise.
   Conviction carries a maximum jail sentence of three years.
   Adi Gonen, a National Police spokesman, confirmed the
investigation was over but would not disclose its findings. He said
the file would be delivered to prosecutors Sunday.
   Army radio said the police file included recommendations that
several people in the case be tried for exporting military knowledge
without a license.
   A senior police official told The Associated Press privately
earlier this week at least some of the men probably would be tried.
Three are senior army reserve officers.
   He said police had found no evidence the Israelis were involved
in Colombia's narcotics underworld.
   Police began the investigation Aug. 27, at the urging of Defense
Minister Yitzhak Rabin, after reports filtered out of Colombia that
Israeli officers may have trained assassins for drug bosses.
   Rabin has said the men, from a private firm called Hod Hahanit,
or Spearhead, had no government license to sell their expertise
abroad.
   Yair Klein, a reserve lieutenant-colonel who heads the company,
has contended no license was required to train private individuals.
He denied training anyone linked to drug traffickers and said his
students were ranchers seeking to protect themselves from guerrillas.

   More automated record-keeping is needed to keep
futures markets honest _ but not at the expense of the traditional
trading methods of shouts and hand signals, a government watchdog
agency said Friday.
   The General Accounting Office said the systems used for keeping
track of trades on the nation's commodities markets are
``fundamentally inadequate'' to detect and deter wrongdoing.
   Last month, more than 40 traders and brokers on the Chicago Board
of Trade and the Chicago Mercantile Exchange were indicted on a
variety of charges that the had schemed to defraud customers.
   Among the schemes alleged were falsifying trading records to
conceal the execution of trades at non-competitive prices or ahead
of a customer's trade order.
   ``Most of the types of abuses alleged in the Justice Department
indictments could also have been detected and documented with
independent, precise and complete timing of trades,'' Richard L.
Fogel, an assistant comptroller general with the GAO, told the
Senate Agriculture Committee.
   At issue is the ``audit trail,'' a term describing the
reconstruction of any given transaction, or put more simply:
determining who bought what from whom and when they did it.
   The GAO, an investigative agency of Congress, visited the two
giant Chicago exchanges as well as the two largest in New York _ the
New York Mercantile Exchange and the Commodity Exchange.
   While all four try to track trading activities, ``in each system,
opportunities exist to manipulate the timing, and therefore the
sequencing, of trades,'' said Fogel.
   On three of the four exchanges, much of the record keeping is
left to traders and brokers themselves.
   Are the ``audit trail systems in place at the major U.S.
exchanges are fundamentally inadequate to police the trading floors
against abuses?'' asked Sen. Patrick Leahy.
   ``I think it is. Yes,'' said Fogel, noting that there is no
guarantee that information about the timing of when a broker gets an
order or executes it.
   But Fogel said computerization doesn't necessarily spell the end
of the hurly-burly method of trading in the exchange pits by shouts
and hand signals known as open outcry.
   ``I think that's a question the exchanges themselves need to
answer,'' he said, adding ``I don't personally believe that the
government should dictate how the exchanges want to trade.''
   The two Chicago futures exchanges, the largest in the world, have
been criticized for not keeping a closer watch on traders, while the
Commodity Futures Trading Commission, which oversees the futures
markets, has been accused of doing so with too light a touch.
   The CFTC, which is up for reauthorization at the end of the
month, has implemented rules requiring the exchanges to be able to
reconstruct a trade to within one minute of its occurence, but the
exchanges say their systems are effective between 84 percent and 90
percent of the time.

   The Independent Students Association
applied again on Friday for legal status with the right to strike,
but the provincial court delayed a decision until Sept. 23.
   Prosecutor Jan Szewczuk said he had no objection to the
registration and lawyers for the students noted that President
Wojciech Jaruzelski said conditions should be created to allow the
association to be legalized again.
   The free union movement Solidarity and the students association,
known by its Polish initials NZS, were recognized legally after
their formation in 1980 but were outlawed in 1982 under the martial
law crackdown.
   NZS was denied registration last May 23, although Solidarity and
Rural Solidarity, the independent farmers union, regained legal
status following April accords reached in ``round-table'' talks
between communist authorities and the then-opposition.
   Lawyer Piotr Andrzejewski, representing the students, said after
the hearing Friday, ``I think that the decision can be only one _
registration of NZS on the basis of the rights it possessed before
the introduction of martial law _ and it is going to put an end to
the results of martial law.
   ``But if the decision is negative it will be at the start of a
new academic year and it will be a conscious creation of political
instability in Poland.''
   The sticking point is the students' demand for the right to
strike.
   The court said Polish law had not been revised to permit
including a strike clause in the NZS charter, although there is a
proposal to do so.
   Szewczuk asked the three-judge panel to reverse its May decision,
recognizing a new legal initiative exists based on ``mutual trust''
between authorities and organizations.
   Poland's new prime minister, Tadeusz Mazowiecki, comes from
Solidarity.
   NZS, with a strong and vocal following among college and high
school students nationwide, responded to the May rejection with
strikes, including one at the 16,000-student Warsaw University.
   Solidarity leader Lech Walesa has asked for a moratorium on
strikes to give Mazowiecki's government time to organize an economic
recovery plan. It is the first government in the East bloc in four
decades not to be led by a communist.
   At a May congress, the students rejected dropping the strike
provision.
   Walesa has said that the communists broke a pledge by not making
NZS legal.

<HEAD>Manufacturers Call For Lifting Restrictions On Trade With Soviet
Union</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The National Association of Manufacturers, one
of the nation's oldest and largest trade groups, called Friday for
Congress and the Bush administration to remove restrictions on trade
with the Soviet Union.
   Specifically, the group said the Soviet Union should be granted a
waiver under the 1974 Jackson-Vanik law, which imposed high tariffs
on imports from any nation that does not allow its citizens to
emigrate freely.
   The Soviet Union, because of its resistance to Jewish emigration,
has been among 15 nations on the restricted list, including Latvia,
Lithuania and Estonia, which are Soviet states.
   ``While ideological differences can be important, they should not
preclude mutually beneficial commercial relations,'' the
manufacturers said in a statement. ``Recent events suggest that
there is now genuine opportunity to improve U.S. economic relations
with the Soviet Union.''
   It said waiving Jackson-Vanik, named after the late Sen. Henry
Jackson, D-Wash., and former Rep. Charles Vanik, D-Ohio, would be a
first step to a new bilateral trade agreement granting the Soviet
Union most-favored-nation trade status.
   Several major Jewish organizations, including the World Jewish
Congress, have come out in favor of granting the waiver.
   Only 914 Jews were allowed to leave the Soviet Union in 1986,
according to the National Conference on Soviet Jewry, which has
tracked the emigration since 1968. However, the number shot up to
8,155 in 1987 and 18,965 in 1988. In the first eight months of this
year, 33,444 Jews have left, including a one-month record of 6,756
in August, the group said.

   Israeli Defense Minister Yitzhak Rabin sought
Friday to discourage the Bush administration from granting a visa to
Yasser Arafat, the chairman of the Palestine Liberation Organization.
   Rabin, talking to reporters after a meeting with Secretary of
State James A. Baker III, accused the PLO of escalating violence
against Israel.
   Arafat would need a visa to attend the U.N. General Assembly that
opens Sept. 25 in New York. State Department officials have brushed
aside questions about U.S. intentions as hyothetical, saying the PLO
leader had not applied.
   ``Israel would see it very gravely,'' Rabin said after an
hour-long session with Baker. He had met earlier in the day with
Defense Secretary Richard Cheney and Brent Scowcroft, the national
security adviser.
   Rabin and Cheney signed a memorandum expanding defense
cooperation between the United States and Israel.
   Arafat was denied a U.S. visa last year to attend a special U.N.
session on the Palestinian dispute with Israel. The session was
moved to Geneva, Switzerland, to accommodate him.
   Since then, the United States has begun diplomatic discussions
with the PLO and accepted a statement by Arafat renouncing terrorism.
   The State Department spokeswoman, Margaret D. Tutwiler, declined
to provide an account of Rabin's session with Baker. She said no
details were ever given about ``one-on-one'' meetings with foreign
visitors.
   Rabin's trip kicks off a series of visits by Israeli officials.
   He will be followed by Deputy Foreign Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu, Finance Minister Shimon Peres and, in November, by Prime
Minister Yitzhak Shamir. Foreign Minister Moshe Arens will attend
the U.N. General Assembly session.
   The main topic in the talks with U.S. officials is the proposal
by Shamir to hold elections among Palestinians on the West Bank and
in Gaza. The United States, which endorses the plan as a step toward
peace talks, has been unable to sell the plan to the PLO.
   ``Without the coming out of a partner there is nothing more for
the initiaitve,'' Rabin said. ``Israel is going to stand on its
initiative.''

   Brazil will ship some of the bones of
Nazi war criminal Josef Mengele to West Germany to compare their
genetic code with that of Mengele's son, the head of Brazil's
federal police said Friday.
   Federal Police Chief Romeu Tuma said four teeth, three ribs and
several other bones taken from Mengele's remains would be submitted
to a deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) test in Frankfurt, West Germany.
   The genetic code contained in the DNA ``will be compared to that
of Mengele's son Rolf, who has agreed to submit himself to the test
by donating some of his blood,'' Tuma said.
   Tuma, who was to fly to Germany on Saturday with the bones, said
the DNA test was requested by Frankfurt's district attorney. The
test is considered positive proof of identity.
   Tuma said the test would confirm once and for all that the bones
are those of the infamous ``Angel of Death'' of the Auschwitz death
camp in Poland where hundreds of thousands of prisoners were killed
during World War II.
   ``That should put to rest any lingering doubts that anyone may
have that the remains are Mengele's,'' the police chief said.
   He said he did not know when the test would be completed.
   Mengele's remains were dug up on June 6, 1985, from a grave in
the cemetery at Embu, 17 miles from Sao Paulo.
   Witnesses said Mengele lived in Brazil for 18 years and drowned
on Feb. 7, 1979, while swimming at a beach resort near Sao Paulo.
   On June 21, 1985, an international forensic team concluded the
unearthed skeleton was Mengele's ``within a reasonable scientific
certainty.''
   On March 27, 1986, after Mengele's dental X-rays were discovered
in Sao Paulo, U.S. forensic scientist Lowell Levine said the remains
``may now be identified as belonging to Josef Mengele with absolute
certainty.''
   The bones have been kept at the Sao Paulo morgue since being
removed from the grave.

<HEAD>U.S., Korea Initial North Pacific Drift Net Pact</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LES BLUMENTHAL</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The United States and South Korea reached
tentative agreement Friday on a treaty to end South Korean
harvesting of salmon that U.S. fishermen say has cut into their
catches off the Northwest and Alaskan coasts.
   The agreement was initialed by negotiators from both nations, but
still has to be formally signed.
   It came two weeks after President Bush warned the Koreans they
faced a possible ban on shipments of their fishery products to the
United States if an agreement was not reached by the end of
September.
   Earlier this year, drift net treaties were negotiated with Japan
and Taiwan, whose fleets along with the one from South Korea fish
the international waters in the North Pacific.
   Ed Wolfe, the State Department's ambassador for oceans and
fisheries, said the treaties provide for a ``cooperative enforcement
program designed to minimize interception of U.S.-origin salmon and
a cooperative monitoring program designed to assess incidental take
of a wide variety of marine resources.''
   Under international law, only American fishermen are allowed to
catch salmon spawned in the United States.
   The Korean agreement grants U.S. enforcement officers
``unrestricted authority'' to board and inspect Korean drift net
vessels to search for evidence of catches of fish spawned in the
United States, Wolfe said.
   In addition, all Korean drift net vessels will have to be
equipped with satellite transponders by the 1990 fishing season.
These would allow U.S. officials to keep track of the location of
vessels to ensure they don't fish outside designated areas.
   In exchange, the Koreans will be allowed to fish an expanded area
of the North Pacific in May.
   More than 700 vessels from Japan, Korean and Taiwan have been
using drift nets in the North Pacific, ostensibly to catch squid.
   But U.S. fishing groups claim they are actually fishing for
salmon that spawn in North America and swim the Pacific Ocean.
Salmon runs in Alaska, Washington state and Oregon have already
suffered as a result of the catches, the American groups say.
   Environmentalists also complain that use of the drift nets, which
they call ``walls of death,'' result in the deaths of thousands of
marine mammals and seabirds annually.

<HEAD>Bennett ``Agrees With Sentiment'' About Forcing Down Drug Planes</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MIKE ROBINSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   National drug policy director William Bennett
responded ``I agree with the sentiment'' when a senator told him
Friday that law enforcement officials should have the authority to
use force to bring down drug-carrying planes.
   Bennett, testifying before a Senate committee, also restated the
Bush administration's position that there are no plans to send U.S.
fighting troops to Colombia to fight the cocaine cartel and said
that was unlikely to change.
   He said that if there were a request from Colombia for U.S.
forces it would have to be considered but it appears unlikely that
will happen because Colombian President Virgilio Barco does not want
foreign fighting troops in his country.
   If there were a change in policy, the decision would be made by
President Bush in consultation with Congress, Bennett said in his
second day of appearances before lawmakers to promote the anti-drug
proposals Bush unveiled Tuesday.
   At one point in the hearing, Sen. Mitch McConnell, R-Ky.,
provided a videotape of an airplane with packages being dumped out
of it. He said federal officials had identified it as air delivery
of cocaine from South America.
   McConnell said that demonstrated the need for legislation he has
sponsored to provide American law enforcement officials with
authority to use force as a last resort to bring down such aircraft.
   ``I agree with the sentiment expressed, Senator,'' Bennett said.
   ``It is analogous to, not identical to, but analogous to, it
seems to me, the authority we give a police officer in the inner
city in this country to stop someone from speeding away in a
four-by-four,'' Bennett said.
   ``Unless we are going to engage in some kind of class
discrimination, I don't know why the airplane is not subject to some
kind of rules as well as the recently purchased four-by-four in
southeast Washington,'' he said.
   Sen. Joseph Biden, D-Del., told Bennett that if such a plane were
discovered and could not be stopped any other way, then as a last
resort, ``I think we should blow it out of the air.''
   Meanwhile, after Sen. John Kerry brought up the issue, the
Internal Revenue Service confirmed that there have been recent cuts
in a Miami-based program, ``Operation Greenback,'' designed to
ferret out money laundering by narcotics traffickers.
   Kerry, D-Mass., said he was disturbed by reports of a scaling
back in the program, operated by the IRS and the Justice Department.
``I have heard of it,'' said Bruce Karnes, an aide to Bennett. But
he said he had no details.
   ``Apparently there have been some cutbacks,'' Internal Revenue
Service spokesman John Hanlon said. He said details of the operation
would not be available immediately.
   As for sending troops to Colombia, Bennett said in response to
questions from Sen. Paul Sarbanes, D-Md., ``There is no thinking of
such actions at this time.''
   His comments to the Senate Foreign Relations Committee were in
line with earlier statements from the White House that the
possibility of such a move was remote.
   He said there was no certainty that military advisers, if sent,
would be able to stay clear of hostilities.
   Bennett also told senators the administration is looking at the
idea of a multinational strike force to combat drugs.
   Kerry asked why such a unit was not part of the drug-fighting
strategy made public by Bush. Bennett said it remained unclear that
the idea was a good one.
   ``Barco as you know doesn't want an American strike force,'' he
said. ``He doesn't want an international strike force. He doesn't
want any kind of strike force.''
   Bennett expanded on his testimony of Thursday that Colombian
cartel leaders will not face the death penalty if extradited here
and convicted of capital crimes. He said that was because the U.S.
extradition agreement with Colombia provides that those sent here
for trial will get no harsher penalty that the maximum sentence in
that nation, which is 30 years in prison.
   ``If the choices are no extradition to the United States or 30
years, then I think we should go with 30 years,'' Bennett said.
   He said he would like to change the extradition agreement to
remove the restriction against use of the death penalty.

   A top State Department official called on China
Friday to take steps that will prevent the Khmer Rouge rebels from
ever imposing it ``murderous rule'' on Cambodia again.
   Richard Solomon, the assistant secretary of state for East Asian
affairs, also said the Soviet Union must restrict its military aid
to Cambodia and use its influence to promote genuine national
reconciliation in that country.
   Solomon spoke to an international symposium on the future of
U.S.-Indochina relations in Los Angeles. Copies of his remarks were
made available by the State Department.
   Solomon rejected the argument of many analysts that the United
States should acquiesce in the continued rule of the
Vietnamese-backed Hun Sen government in Cambodia rather than press
for a comprehensive settlement among all contending factions.
   He called this approach ``seriously flawed'' on several counts.
   First, he said, ``a regime imposed and sustained by foreign force
of arms lacks legitimacy.''
   In addition, he said there is little basis for the assumption
that Hun Sen's unproven forces, absent their Vietnamese protectors
who are due to leave at the end of September, can eliminate the
Khmer Rouge. This, he said, is a goal that eluded Vietnam's powerful
army for a decade.
   Solomon said the United States has neither the political position
nor the resources to promote a peaceful settlement in Cambodia but
added that the same cannot be said for the Soviet Union and China.
   ``The Soviet Union, as the primary supporter of Vietnam and Hun
Sen, must restrict its increasing flow of arms into Cambodia, and
bring Hanoi to see that its own interests will not be served by
another cycle of warfare in Indochina _ which certainly will be the
case if it seeks full power for Hun Sen in the absence of a process
of political reconciliaiton,'' he said.
   ``In return, Hanoi and Hun Sen _ and the international community
_ have a right to expect China to equally restrict the supply of
arms to the Khmer Rouge.
   ``Indeed, Beijing has an obligation to take active measures that
will prevent the Khmer Rouge from again imposing a murderous rule on
the Cambodian people.''
   Solomon spoke against the background of a failed effort at an
international conference in Paris last month to achieve a political
settlement in Cambodia to coincide with the withdrawal of the
Vietnamese troops.
   He suggested that the key issue is whether the various Cambodian
factions can join together in a process of national reconciliation.
   He said the United States will use its influence to move events
in this direction and ``China and the Soviet Union must do the
same.''
   ``Moscow, in particular, must accept and act on the reality that
without some willingness by Vietnam and Hun Sen to compromise on
power-sharing, there can be no negotiated settlement, no respite
from armed conflict,'' he said.

   A prosecutor said Friday he probably will seek
Supreme Court review of an appeals court ruling that overturned the
conviction of former White House political director Lyn Nofziger.
   All nine judges on the U.S. Court of Appeals this week rejected a
request by independent counsel James McKay for a rehearing of the
June 27 decision that set aside Nofziger's convictions for illegal
lobbying.
   Independent counsel James McKay said in a brief interview that
his office's ``present inclination'' is to ask the Supreme Court to
take the case.
   In its 2-1 opinion overturning Nofziger's conviction, the court
had said that for Nofziger to be found guilty of illegal lobbying,
prosecutors were required to prove he had known that what he was
doing was illegal.
   ``I think that the majority opinion in this case is clearly
wrong,'' appeals court judge Harry Edwards said in a statement
Tuesday with which three of his colleagues concurred.
   Edwards said, however, that the full appeals court wasn't the
proper place to hear the matter and that ``any further consideration
of this case must be'' by the Supreme Court. Concurring with Edwards
were Chief Judge Patricia Wald, Abner Mikva and Ruth B. Ginsburg.
All four judges are Carter administration appointees.
   The other five judges currently on the appeals court are Laurence
Silberman, James Buckley, Stephen Williams, Douglas Ginsburg and
David Sentelle. All are Reagan administration appointees.
   Edwards was the dissenting vote in the June 27 decision and said
at that time that his colleagues had twisted the meaning of the
Ethics in Government Act under which Nofziger was convicted.
   Nofziger was convicted on Feb. 11, 1988, of illegally lobbying
the White House on behalf of scandal-plagued Wedtech Corp., a
maritime workers union and Fairchild Corp. He lobbied for an Army
engine contract for Wedtech, for the placement of civilian sailors
on Navy vessels and for continued Air Force buying of an anti-tank
aircraft made by Fairchild.

   Riot troopers firing tear gas on
Friday broke up a crowd of high school students protesting the
closing of two schools this week for anti-government activity,
witnesses said.
   Students trying to block streets near Remon Cantera School were
stopped by about 40 soldiers. The school is Panama's largest, with
about 4,000 students.
   No arrests or injuries were reported in the two-hour
demonstration.
   Remon Cantera was evacuated and Education Minister Juan Bosco
Bernal will decide whether to suspend classes, a ministry spokesman
said.
   The ministry earlier this week closed the National Institute
after firebombs were found there. Authorities said students planned
to throw them at police. It shut the American Institute after
anti-government demonstrations.
   Ministry officials say the ministry will close any schools where
anti-government demonstrations occur.
   Two schools closed last month, one in Panama City and one in
Colon, remain shut.

   Thunderstorms moved across the nation's midsection Friday,
bringing heavy rains to already drenched areas of Kansas, Nebraska,
Iowa and Missouri.
   Showers and thunderstorms also increased along the Texas
coastline, southwest Texas and near the east coast of Florida.
   The season's first snowfall was reported Friday morning in the
Big Horn mountains of north-central Wyoming. Burgess Junction, about
30 miles west of Sheridan, reported 2 inches of snow.
   Thunderstorms over southeast Nebraska were part of a much larger
area of showers and thunderstorms extending from northern Kansas and
southern Nebraska, across southern Iowa and northern Missouri into
central Indiana.
   The area around Lincoln, Neb., where 3-5 inches of rain fell, was
particularly hard hit. The Holmes Park area of Lincoln was drenched
by over 8{ inches of rain Friday morning, causing flooding.
   In Ottawa, Kan., a construction trailer was flipped over by
strong winds during an isolated thunderstorm at the Ottawa Municipal
Airport. A worker inside the trailer was bruised but escaped serious
injury.
   Flash flood warnings were posted Friday night for parts of
Kansas, Nebraska, Iowa and northwest Missouri. Strong thunderstorms
passing through central Indiana caused street flooding in
Crawfordsville.
   Showers and thunderstorms were scattered across the central
Rockies and were spreading into the central high Plains. Golf
ball-size hail pelted Fort Carson, Colo., during a severe
thunderstorm Friday afternoon. Marble-size hail fell in Pueblo, Colo.
   Abundant sunshine, hot temperatures and high humidity prevailed
from the southern Plains and southern parts of Kansas and Missouri
to the mid- and southeast Atlantic Coast.
   Heavier rainfall during the 6 hours ending at 2 p.m. EDT included
2{ inches at Omaha, Neb., and over 2 inches at Lincoln, Neb..
   Temperatures around the nation at 3 p.m. EDT ranged from 44
degrees at Cody, Wyo., to 99 degrees at Phoenix. The low in the
nation Friday was 27 degrees at Truckee, Calif.
   The forecast for Saturday called for showers and thunderstorms
from eastern sections of the central Plains to the Great Lakes and
northern parts of the Ohio Valley; scattered showers and
thunderstorms over the northern Rockies, northern Colorado and the
northern Plains; and scattered thunderstorms over the central and
eastern Gulf of Mexico coastline.
   Temperatures were expected to be unseasonably cool _ in the 50s
and 60s _ from the northern Rockies through the upper Mississippi
Valley; in the 90s from the southeastern states across the Tennessee
Valley, the lower Mississippi Valley to the southern Plains and
southern New Mexico and the interior valleys of central California;
and 100 to 105 degrees over the desert Southwest. Highs in the
remainder of the nation were expected in the 70s and 80s.

<HEAD>Secretary of State Differs With Quayle On SDI</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Secretary of State James A. Baker III said
Friday that the goals of the Strategic Defense Initiative are sound
and should not be scaled back.
   His views were contained in a State Department statement issued
after a reporter's question prompted by a published interview with
Vice President Dan Quayle in which he said that then-President
Reagan, in making his original sales pitch for the ``Star Wars''
program in 1983, had resorted to ``political jargon'' and had
stretched ``the capability'' of the proposal.
   Baker, in the State Department statement, quoted President Bush
as saying:
   ``We are vigorouly pursuing SDI. Our goals for SDI and our
approach in the defense and space talks are sound and remain
unchanged.''
   Baker said the Soviets should understand ``our insistence on
investigating fully the feasibility of advanced strategic defenses.''
   Hours after the Quayle inteview, Bush's spokesman, Marlin
Fitzwater, said that Bush and Quayle were in step on SDI and that
Bush still has not given up the plan's goal of perfecting a space
shield against all incoming nuclear missiles.
   In the published interview, Quayle said Reagan had ``talked about
this impenetrable shield that was going to be completely leakproof.
   ``I believe that in the semantics of, let's say, political jargon
that that was acceptable. But it clearly was stretching the
capability of a strategic defense system.''
   Under Bush, Quayle said, the program has been ``redefined and put
into missions, requirements, doctrine and strategy much differently
than we did in the early 1980s.''
   Now, he said in the interview, the emphasis is on a program to
help protect the United States against the accidental launch of a
limited number of nuclear missiles, ``rather than an all-out,
bolt-out-of-the-blue attack.''
   The issue of arms control and the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty
of 1972, which banned most anti-missile defenses, are likely topics
for discussion when Baker meets with Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard
A. Shevardnadze in Jackson Hole, Wyo., Sept. 22-23.

   The justice minister ordered an investigation Friday
of allegations that movie director Claude Autant-Lara incited racial
hatred with anti-Semitic comments.
   The announcement came hours after the Autant-Lara, who also is a
politician of the extreme right, was forced to resign as vice
president of the Academy of Fine Arts.
   Pierre Arpaillange, the minister, ordered the state prosecutor to
investigate remarks attributed to Autant-Lara in Friday's edition of
the monthly magazine Globe.
   His statement said the investigation could lead to charges of
racial injury, racial defamation and inciting racial hatred.
   Autant-Lara, 88, stirred condemnation Thursday when the magazine
quoted him as saying French politician Simone Veil, who survived a
German concentration camp, had been ``missed'' by the Nazis.
   In the interview, was quoted as accusing Ms. Veil, 62, of
exploiting her experience for political gain.
   ``She plays the violins with that. But she came back, eh?'' he
was quoted as saying. ``And she's doing very well. So when they talk
to me of genocide, I say that, in any case, they missed old lady
Veil.''
   He was asked to give up the vice presidency of the Academy of
Fine Arts by the group's permanent secretary, Marcel Landowski.
   Landowski declared himself ``profoundly shocked by the
statements'' and joined fellow members in demanding Autant-Lara's
resignation from ``an assembly of artists in love with moderation
and humanism.''
   Last week, Autant-Lara stepped down as a member of the European
Parliament for the extreme right-wing National Front, without saying
why.
   National Front leader Jean-Marie le Pen said the remarks about
Veil were ``shocking'' and ``completely open to criticism,'' but
also said the magazine was guilty of deliberatelyk making a scandal.
   The ministry statement indicated the prosecutor also would
determine whether to take action against the Globe.
   While not denying the remarks, Autant-Lara said earlier Friday he
reserved the right to sue the Globe. He said his telephone
conversation with a Globe reporter did not constitute an official
interview.
   Autant-Lara directed such classics as ``The Game of Love,'' ``The
Red Inn,'' and ``Seven Sins.''
   Mrs. Veil, a political centrist who served as president of the
European Parliament in 1979-81 and was reelected as a deputy in
June, has declined comment.

   Afghan guerrillas said Friday they had
captured four security posts and three tanks in an advance on the
government-held garrison town of Khost, near the Pakistan border.
   The reports contradicted the Afghan government, which said
Thursday the Moslem guerrillas had lost a two-week fight to take
Khost.
   A spokesman for guerrilla commander Jalaluddin Haqqani, who is
reported to lead 3,000 of the U.S.-supported guerrillas, said
Thursday they had Khost and were within three miles of it.
   The guerrilla news agency MIDIA said the mujahedeen, as the
guerrillas are called, destroyed a Soviet-made Antonov-26 transport
plane in a rocket attack on the Khost's airport Wednesday.
   ``The Kabul regime can only supply by air,'' it said. ``All roads
leading to Khost have been cut off.''
   Haqqani's spokesman, who known only as Mohed, said: ``Fifteen
soldiers surrendered and handed over some heavy guns'' on Thursday.
``Three mujahedeen were killed and 14 were wounded, but we don't
know how many regime troops were killed.''
   He said the guerrillas captured three tanks as they overran four
posts, which he identified as Walim, Ghubao, Mirbao and Bak.
   There is no way to verify the contradictory claims often made by
Afghan officials and insurgents in the 11-year-old civil war.
   Lt. Gen. Abdul Haq Ulumi, secretary of the Soviet-backed
government's Supreme Defense Council, told reporters Thursday the
army had retaken all the positions it had lost since the guerrillas
began their Khost offensive Aug. 24 and the battle was ``completely
over.''
   The town in Paktia province is the government's easternmost
garrison, 12 miles from the Pakistan, where most of the guerrillas
are based. Its capture would clear the way for a guerrilla assault
on the provincial capital Gardez, 48 miles to the northwest.
   The guerrillas have not captured a city since the Soviet Union
withdrew its military forces Feb. 15 after nine years of involvement
in the war.

   A senior Iraqi official was quoted Friday
as saying the United States was providing cover for Syrian attempts
to partition Lebanon and only force would make the Syrians withdraw
from their war-racked neighbor.
   The London-based newsletter Mideast Mirror quoted First Deputy
Premier Taha Yassin Ramadan of Iraq as saying in an interview that
during Iraq's 8-year war with Iran ``Israel was in the background
and America providing cover.''
   ``The same thing is happening in Lebanon, where the leading role
is being played by Syria and Israel, but the American cover is much
clearer and more candid than it was in the war with Iraq.
   ``In Iraq, the aim was to partition the country, and in Lebanon
they have the same goal.''
   Ramadan was interviewed Thursday in Belgrade at the summit
conference of non-aligned nations. A copy was telexed to The
Associated Press in Bahrain.
   Lebanon has been torn by 14 years of civil war.
   Iraq has backed Gen. Michel Aoun in recent fighting in Lebanon
between his Christian forces and Moslem militias backed by Syria.
The Christian army is also fighting the estimated 40,000 troops
Syria has in Lebanon.
   Iraq and Syria are bitter political foes ruled by rival wings of
the Baath Party. Syria backed Iran in the Iran-Iraq war, which was
halted by a cease-fire in August 1988.
   The newsletter quoted Ramadan as saying: ``We in Iraq say that
neither an Arab resolution nor an international resolution will get
Hafez Assad out of Lebanon. Only force can get him out, crawling on
his knees.''
   Assad is the president of Syria.
   Ramadan was quoted as saying Iraq supported peacemaking efforts
in Lebanon by an Arab League committee, but doubted it would make
headway in ending the war since Syria refused to agree to a
timetable for withdrawing its troops.
   ``Let them try. We are confident that Hafez Assad will not leave
Lebanon as a result of a resolution. He merely wants to play for
time.''
   The foreign ministers of Saudi Arabia, Morocco and Algeria are to
meet in Jiddah, Saudi Arabia, next Wednesday. They will appraise the
chances of their three leaders' trying once more to end the fighting
in Lebanon and outline a plan for national reconciliation to avert
the threat of partition.

   A year after radiocarbon tests found the Shroud of
Turin to be only 700 years old, a participant in a shroud symposium
said Friday the bright light of the Resurrection may have altered
the aging process.
   ``Many of the questions boil down to this,'' said Jacques Evin,
an engineer at the Radiocarbon Laboratory of Lyon. ``In the event of
the Resurrection of Christ, would there have been a sufficient burst
of light to alter the process of carbon decay?''
   The Paris International Scientific Symposium on the Shroud of
Turin gave ``shroudies'' _ dedicated students of what is purported
to be the burial cloth of Jesus Christ _ their first chance to
contest the findings issued in October 1988.
   ``It is a most unusual object and it's an object that means a lot
of things to a lot of people,'' said Professor Michael Tite of the
British Museum research laboratory at the end of the two-day
gathering. ``Anything you do with it is bound to cause controversy.''
   Tite was at the heart of the debate last year. He headed one of
three laboratories that said the shroud was made about 700 years
ago, 13 centuries after the death of Christ. Scientific teams from
the University of Arizona and University of Zurich also participated.
   Rather than resolving questions of the shroud's authenticity, the
radiocarbon tests appear to have become a new source of argument.
   The 14-yard-long cloth bears a faint, yellowish negative image of
the front and back of a man with thorn marks on the head,
lacerations from flogging on the back and bruises on the shoulders,
suggestive of accounts of Christ's crucifixion.
   It has been kept in Italy's Cathedral of Turin since the Middle
Ages, when creation of false religious relics was widespread. The
now-retired Roman Catholic cardinal there, Anastasio Ballestrero,
invited scientists last year to test samples the size of postage
stamps with radiocarbon dating techniques.
   Datings by the laboratories ranged from 1260 to 1390. Ballestrero
eventually endorsed the results, but said the shroud's significance
as an object of deep religious faith was unchanged.
   Few symposium participants contested the test results, but Evin
and others questioned whether the cloth had been altered somehow to
produce an inaccurate reading.
   Tite was skeptical of Evin's theory.
   ``It seems to me a slight coincidence that, if there was a burst
of radiation, it would have been just enough to date the cloth to
the 14th century,'' he said.
   Some of the 100 spectators cheered when one of their number
insisted the scientists had tested a piece of the cloth near a seam
that was restored in the 16th or 17th century.
   ``We do not have a pure specimen,'' he declared. ``It was
contaminated. There were threads from the 16th century extending
into the main part of the shroud. I think we may be dealing with a
clever forger who rewove the threads.''
   Tite said the results would have been affected only if 60-70
percent of the cloth were rewoven.
   John Jackson, 43, of Colorado Springs, Colo., said density
measurements of the frontal image on the cloth appear to show a body
was lifted through it, but he stopped well short of calling the
phenomenon evidence of the Resurrection.
   ``I don't want to get into too much speculation on the religious
implications,'' said Jackson, who has studied the shroud for 15
years. ``If the shroud is medieval, then this image was formed then.
   ``I'm also open to the fact that if someone else can explain this
image in a conventional way, then that should take priority over
mine.''

   The official Economic Daily newspaper denounced
former party chief Zhao Ziyang on Friday for encouraging a market
economy and emphasized that China will not abandon the communist
system of public ownership.
   On the same subject, hard-line Premier Li Peng stressed Friday
that public ownership always will dominate China's economy. But Li
said private entrepreneurs will continue to supplement the
public-owned economy and provide jobs.
   A commentary in the Economic Daily said Zhao put too much
emphasis on privatization.
   It said some Chinese supporters of Western ideas gradually are
trying to convert China's economic structure to capitalism.
   They aim to ``disintegrate public ownership, pushing
privatization to be a major aspect of China's economy step by step
until the whole economy is privatized,'' the article said.
   Zhao advocated gradually reducing state controls over the economy
and encouraged private enterprise. He was ousted after the June
military crackdown on a pro-democracy movement, .
   Zhao also backed agricultural reforms allowing families to
contract land and sell crops on the free market after fulfilling
state quotas for grain.
   Farmers also have been free to start their own businesses.
   Rapid growth of private enterprise has produced a moneyed class
and increased income gaps.
   The latest issue of the weekly magazine Beijing Review said
private ownership would polarize the rich and the poor ``while the
overwhelming majority of people would again be plunged into the
plight of being exploited and oppressed.''
   The Economic Daily and China Daily approved of capitalism's
advanced management systems, but denounced such elements as
exploitation of workers and unequal distribution of wealth.
   Capitalists are more interested in profiteering than adjusting
production to economic laws, they said.
   Public ownership supporters argue that collectivism can integrate
market demand with centralized plans, respond to consumer needs,
improve production quality and enable the government to regulate the
economy.
   The Beijing Review cited the 100,000-worker Capital Iron and
Steel Co. as a successful example of a large state-run enterprise
because it registered 20 percent increases in annual profits and tax
payments in recent years.
   Chinese economists have stressed no campaign will be undertaken
against the nation's 19.4 million private entrepreneurs, although
officials have announced stronger measures to combat tax evasion and
illegal selling practices.
   China Daily in July said privatization would cause a widening gap
in different regions and that surplus labor has become a serious
social problem.
   Millions of migrant workers have descended on southern Canton and
other urban centers, hoping for jobs but ending up straining social
facilities.

<TEXT>
   Bands of masked men with guns and
firebombs rampaged Friday through Medellin, the home base of
Colombia's largest cocaine cartel, and police said nine official
vehicles were burned.
   They did not report any injuries but said the gangs, suspected of
being the cartel's hired thugs, stopped the official vehicles
including trucks and vans and set them afire in sporadic attacks
throughout the day.
   There were these other developments:
   _The army said it had arrested a pilot, Nicolas Gonzalez Cardona,
who flew cocaine to the United States for Pablo Escobar, Colombia's
most notorious cocaine baron.
   _Police said one of Escobar's top aides was released because they
had no arrest warrant or U.S. extradition request for the suspect.
They reported that Luis Fernando Galeano Berrio was released from a
Bogota jail Thursday.
   _A newspaper poll indicated more than 75 percent of Colombians
support the government's 3-week-old war on drug traffickers but
oppose the presence of foreign soldiers to help in the fight.
   In a telephone interview with The Associated Press, police Col.
Oscar Pelaez Carmona said Galeano was released because police
holding him lacked the required legal papers, including an arrest
warrant and an extradition request from the United States.
   The missing paperwork was supposed to have accompanied Galeano
when he was transferred from a Medellin army base to a Bogota jail.
   In Washington, a spokesman for the Drug Enforcement
Administration, Frank Shultz, said Galeano was not wanted in the
United States and there were no charges against him there.
   Pelaez said Galeano was arrested a month ago in Medellin and was
held for three weeks at an army base in Medellin and brought last
week to Bogota.
   Galeano was captured days before the government began a
nationwide drug crackdown, launched after terrorists assassinated on
Aug. 18 Sen. Luis Carlos Galan, a presidential candidate and
anti-drug crusader.
   A U.S. official in Colombia said the crackdown on drugs had cut
the cocaine trade by up to 50 percent, but that much of the $65
million worth of military airplanes and hardware donated by the
United States was not suited to the job.
   In response to a question, the official said the eight A-37
warplanes cannot be used to bomb cocaine labs and the only way to
employ them may be to help force down suspected drug flights.
   ``All of this stuff came from stockpiles the military had. It is
hard to take stuff out that stockpile and make it applicable'' to
anti-narcotics work, he said.
   Gonzalez Cardona, a pilot who allegedly ferried cocaine to the
United States, was being held in Medellin, the 4th Army Brigade in
Medellin announced.
   It said Gonzalez Cardona was ``a pilot in the service of
narcotics trafficer Pablo Escobar, making international flights on
one of the Medellin cartel's main routes for distributing (cocaine)
between Colombia and the cities of Miami and New York, among
others.''
   The Medellin cartel is believed to supply 80 percent of the
cocaine consumed in the United States.
   Gonzalez Cardona was arrested in a roundup that followed the Aug.
17 assassination of Col. Waldemar Francklin Quintero, Medellin's top
police official.
   Escobar, who is in hiding, tops the list of drug figures wanted
in the United States. He is said to head a $3 billion worldwide
cocaine empire.
   Colombia has offered a $250,000 reward for information leading to
his capture.
   The government of President Virgilio Barco began a nationwide
crackdown following the assassination of Sen. Galan.
   Barco declared a state of siege and said he would extradite drug
figures wanted in the United States. Millions of dollars in
possessions of drug lords have been seized and hundreds of people
have been rounded up, but top drug lords remain at large.
   The man who reputedly laundered hundreds of millions of dollars
for cocaine cartels, Eduardo Martinez Romero, was the first person
extradited to the United States under the current crackdown. He was
being held under tight security in Atlanta pending a Monday hearing.
   The poll by the Bogota newspaper El Tiempo, the Caracol radio
network and a private consulting firm showed 75.8 percent of those
questioned in four cities favored the government's actions and 24
percent opposed. The remainder had no opinion.
   Colombians also were overwhelmingly in favor of extraditing drug
figures and the seizure of their bank accounts and property.
   But Colombians opposed 80 percent to 20 percent the presence of
foreign military personnel in Colombia to aid with the crackdown.
   The pollsters did not give their polling techniques or the poll's
margin of error.
   President Bush approved the special military aid for Colombia's
anti-narcotics forces and sent transport planes, helicopters and
fighter jets to Colombia last week.
   The Pentagon said up to 200 U.S. military personnel would have to
come to Colombia to set up the equipment and show Colombians how to
use it.
   The U.S. official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said
Friday in Bogota that the military equipment shipped to Colombia so
far was merely ``symbolic'' and not adequate for anti-drug
operations.
   He said the crackdown ``is not running out of gas'' and estimated
it has cut the drug flow in Colombia by ``maybe 25 to 50 percent.''

   A federal appeals court Friday upheld the
Transportation Department's random, mandatory drug testing program
covering 30,000 employees, including air traffic controllers.
   A three-judge panel of the U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals for the
District of Columbia said in a unanimous opinion the ``extraordinary
... sensitivity of the bulk'' of the employees in the program
justifies ``the invasions of privacy entailed by conducting'' random
drug testing.
   The American Federation of Government Employees had appealed a
U.S. District Court dismissal of its court challenge to the program.
   The union had filed suit in an attempt to block testing not based
on suspicion of drug use, saying such a practice violated the
prohibitions of the Fourth and Fifth Amendments against searches
without probable cause and self-incrimination.
   The union attacked drug testing of motor vehicle operators,
hazardous material inspectors and aircraft mechanics at the Federal
Aviation Administration, appeals court judge David Sentelle noted.
   All three job categories should be included because of their
importance to public safety.
   ``We have found the privacy interests of employees occupying the
three specifically challenged positions outweighed by the
Department's compelling interests in preventing drug use among such
personnel,'' said the judges.
   The FAA's 12,000 air traffic controllers belong to a different
union, the National Air Traffic Controllers Association, and were
not a party to the case.
   Also subject to the random drug testing are electronic
technicians, aviation and railroad safety inspectors and civil
aviation security specialists.
   The appeals court decision ``represents a great victory for the
department,'' Transportation Secretary Samuel Skinner said in a
statement. The public ``expects and deserves a drug-free and safe
transportation system,'' Skinner said.

   A woman who was raped, slashed and left to die in
her burning home with her head swathed in tape says she snatched a
knife from her assailant and lunged at him, screaming, ``I want to
live! I've got two babies!''
   The woman, whose next-door neighbor was arrested in the attack
after she wrote his name in her own blood, described her ordeal in a
telephone interview with The Denver Post from her Denver General
Hospital room.
   The attack occurred Wednesday in the woman's home in a
middle-class neighborhood of northeast Denver. She was tied up,
beaten and left in a basement crawlspace and her home was set
ablaze, but she managed to escape.
   A neighbor, Donnie Russell, 18, was arrested Thursday in Oklahoma
City and faces extradition to Colorado.
   The 30-year-old victim described her assailant as a ``nice, quiet
kid'' who once baby-sat her children and often spent time with her
husband waxing cars.
   The victim said the ordeal began when her assailant asked to use
her telephone Wednesday morning.
   After making a call, he allegedly pulled out a handgun, pointed
it at her and demanded all her money and jewelry.
   ``I kept saying, `Oh, come on,' and thought he was kidding,'' the
woman told The Post. ``Then he put the gun to my head and I knew he
wasn't playing.''
   The woman gave him all her cash _ $3 _ and a credit card.
   She said the little cash angered him and he wrapped her head in
duct tape, leaving only her nose exposed.
   ``I'm going to kill you,'' she remembered him repeating.
   The assailant then guided her into the basement, raped her and
pushed her into a dark crawl space.
   ``I waited until it was quiet,'' she said. ``When it was, I
thought he was gone. I couldn't get the tape off. I couldn't find
the end. So I couldn't see.''
   She said she felt her way to the crawlspace entrance and realized
the man was standing just a few feet away. He hit her on the head
with a hammer, and she collapsed and played dead.
   ``That's when he slashed my arms and legs with a knife. I guess
he thought I would bleed to death,'' she said. ``I acted like I was
out cold.
   ``He came back five minutes later, and put the knife on my chest.
It was like he was trying to find where my heart was.''
   She said she snatched the knife away from the man, telling him,
``I'm going to kill you,'' and swinging the knife blindly.
   ``He kept on saying, `Give me the knife.'
   ``I said, `No, I want to live! I've got two babies!''
   The attacker closed the door to the crawlspace and barricaded it
with furniture. She said she also heard him set a couch on fire just
outside the door.
   The woman said cut the tape away from her eyes and ripped her
shirt to shreds to stop the bleeding from knife wounds on her arms,
legs and hands, while choking on the smoke from the fire.
   ``When I was lying on the ground, I just figured I was going to
die whether I wanted to or not, but I thought he's not going to get
out of this scot-free.''
   She wrote ``Donnie next door'' with her blood-smeared finger on
the floor, the wall and on a cardboard box.
   Then, she put her shoulder to the door, wedging it open far
enough to squeeze out.
   She used the knife to break a basement window, climbed out and
scaled a 6-foot fence. A neighbor called police and firefighters.
   The woman underwent surgery for severed tendons in her hand. She
said she has regained the use of some fingers and the prognosis for
her recovery is good.
   ``But I feel safe in here,'' she said. ``I don't think I'd ever
want to go back to the neighborhood.''

   U.S. Marines conducted reconnaissance
exercises Friday in a resumption of military maneuvers the
government claims violate the Panama Canal treaties.
   Nearly 130 Marines rode 13 armored vehicles through several small
towns west of Panama City, near the Rodman Naval Base.
   ``We are exercising our rights and obligations unde the canal
treaties by reconnoitering the high ground west and south of
Arraijan,'' said Col. J.J. Doyle, commander of Marine forces in the
U.S. Southern Command, which is based in Panama.
   The Southern Command had suspended exercises on Panamanian soil
for three weeks.
   Doyle said the exercises were conducted on Panamanian soil, to
explore several hills, because ``we are responsible for defending
the canal.''
   He said the Panamanian Defense Forces were advised of the
exercise four days in advance and were asked to provide an escort.
No escort was visible.
   Civilians waved at the Marines, who waved back, when the armored
vehicles drove through towns. No incidents were reported.
   A Panamanian army lieutenant who identified himself as A. Rangel,
in command at Arraijan, said the U.S. military was violating the
1977 treaties under which the canal is to be turned over to Panama
by the year 2000.
   Conflicting interpretations of treaty terms have caused friction
between the U.S. military and Panamanian government. The United
States claims the right to conduct operations on Panamanian soil as
part of its commitment to defend the canal.
   Several confrontations have taken place in the past two months.
On Aug. 9, Panamanians arrested two U.S. military policemen and U.S.
Army units blocked the entrance to Fort Amador, arrested two
Panamanian soldiers and held them until the Americans were freed.

<HEAD>Friedman Attacks Bush's National Service Proposal</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By STEVE WILSTEIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SAN FRANCISCO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Conservative economist Milton Friedman on
Friday attacked President Bush's ``thousand points of light'' idea
of national service as ``utterly unnecessary'' and compared it to
one of Adolf Hitler's programs.
   The Nobel Prize-winning economist, in an interview before a forum
of scholars and politicians at the Hoover Institution at Stanford
University, said the idea of universal national service is ``more
wasteful government spending.''
   Friedman said Bush's proposal and several other bills introduced
in Congress this year are smaller versions of universal national
service plans that have been suggested before and which he claimed
bear an ``uncanny resemblance'' to the Hitler youth corps.
   ``Strictly voluntary programs, like the Red Cross or Boy Scouts,
are splendid, but these national service proposals aren't voluntary
as far as the people paying for it,'' Friedman said.
   Rep. Dave McCurdy, D-Okla., chief sponsor in the House of the
Nunn-McCurdy plan for national service, defended the concept of
young Americans devoting time to working for others.
   ``The proposal is based on the premise that our young people must
move beyond the decade of `me first' attitudes of the Reagan era and
the lingering aftereffects of Vietnam, which led many to ask what
their country could do for them,'' McCurdy said.
   The Nunn-McCurdy plan, which seeks to make federal aid for
college students conditional on national service in the military or
in civilian work programs, is among several national service bills
introduced in Congress this year.
   Friedman said the president is proposing a much more modest
program than Nunn and McCurdy, but said, ``I still think it's a
misguided proposal. The fact that you do something bad on a small
scale doesn't make it good.''
   President Bush proposed creating an agency called Youth Engaged
in Service to America and has set up an Office of National Service
in the White House with 14 full-time staffers. Bush proposed funding
that office with $25 million a year for the next four years, and
hopes to match that amount with private funds.
   Bush also has called for a Points of Light Initiative Foundation
and named New Jersey Gov. Tom Kean to head a committee to advise on
how the foundation should be set up.
   ``The president hopes all Americans and all American institutions
will become involved with some kind of community service,'' said
Tracey Taylor, staff assistant for the Office of National Service at
the White House.
   Williamson Evers, a national fellow at Hoover and conference
chairman, said the two-day forum is meant ``to air and thrash out
the issues.''
   Among the other speakers were former Rep. Pete McCloskey,
R.-Calif., Lutheran theologian Richard John Neuhas, political
scientist Benjamin Barber, and Cato Institute senior fellow and
former Reagan administration adviser Doug Bandow.

   Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi on Friday
said his government has reached agreement with Sri Lanka to withdraw
42,000 Indian soldiers sent to that island nation to end ethnic
violence.
   The accord was reached with Sri Lankan officials during this
week's meeting of non-aligned nations in Belgrade, Yugoslavia, Press
Trust of India reported.
   The news agency quoted Gandhi as saying the accord is a ``good
agreement'' covering all aspects of the withdrawal of Indian troops
in northeast Sri Lanka.
   India has withdrawn about 3,000 troops since June 29 following
appeals by Sri Lankan President Ranasinghe Premadasa. Gandhi
initially rejected Premadasa's demands for a troop pullout, saying a
rapid withdrawal would worsen the ethnic violence.
   A clash was averted when India agreed to a token withdrawal June
29, but the countries had failed to agree on a timetable for a
complete pullout. Gandhi did not elaborate on what had been
negotiated.
   ``Sri Lankan officials have gone back to Colombo with the points
of agreement for consultation with President Ranasinghe Premadasa,''
Gandhi was quoted as saying by United News of India.
   ``India and Sri Lanka agreed on major issues,'' he said without
elaborating, UNI reported.
   The government says 17,000 people have been killed in a
secessionist war by Tamil rebels and a backlash by Sinhalese
radicals protesting the government's peace overtures to the Tamils.
   India deployed its first troops in Sri Lanka on June 30, 1987, to
disarm Tamil rebels who had agreed to surrender under an
Indian-brokered peace accord. But the domimant rebel group, the
Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam, reneged and began attacking Indian
soldiers.
   More troops were sent as the fighting escalated. Premadasa asked
for a withdrawal to appease Sinhalese radicals after the Tigers
agreed to peace talks.
   Extremist Sinhalese launched a campaign of assassinations and
terror to protest the Indian presence, which they say compromises
Sri Lanka's sovereignty.
   India got involved because of pressures from its own Tamil
minority.
   Authorities in Sri Lanka said Friday that 19 people had died in
ethnic violence since Wednesday.
   Cpl. Tissa Rupasinghe opened fire on his fellow soldiers Thursday
night while they slept at the Deraniyagala camp, 35 miles east of
Colombo, said the officials.
   They said three soldiers were killed and two injured in the
attack and the 26-year-old corporal fled with an automatic rifle.
   They said the soldier was suspected of being a member of the
People's Liberation Front, an anti-government guerrilla group trying
to overthrow the government.
   Officials blamed the Sinhalese militants for most of the other 16
deaths reported.
   They said the victims included a government official, who was not
identified, and four children who died when a bomb exploded in a
house in Diganhena village, about 85 miles south of Colombo.
   They said one of the victims, a 16-year-old, was suspected of
being a member of the People's Liberation Front and had brought the
bomb home when it accidentally went off.

   An early morning earthquake Friday rattled the
Armenian cities that were wrecked in December by a quake that killed
25,000 people.
   Authorities reported no injuries or damage to buildings from the
quake, which was centered between Spitak and Kirovakan.
   ``This is an area where there is nothing left to destroy,'' said
an editor of Armenia's official Armenpress news agency in a
telephone interview.
   She said the quake, which registered six on the 12-point Soviet
scale, was followed 40 minutes later by a quake that registered four.
   The tremors were not felt in the Armenian capital, Yerevan, 45
miles to the south, said the editor who would not identify herself.
   On the 12-point Soviet scale, a quake of six is considered
strong, capable of shaking pictures from walls and damaging
buildings.
   The earthquake that completely destroyed Spitak and heavily
damaged Kirovakan and Leninakan was estimated to have a force of at
least 10 on the Soviet scale.

   The surgery that removed a small puddle of old
blood from the brain cavity of former President Reagan was among the
simplest of the procedures that could have been used according to
surgeons familiar with brain operations.
   A spokesman for the former president said doctors at St. Marys
Hospital removed a subdural hematoma after drilling a single burr
hole in Reagan's skull.
   Dr. Henry Brem, an associate professor of neurosurgery at Johns
Hopkins Hospital in Baltimore, said before the surgery that if
doctors in the course of the procedure were able to find and drain
the fluid from a single hole then the operation could be
accomplished quickly and easily.
   He said that typically the patient would be placed under general
or local anesthestia and that an incision would be made through the
scalp to the skull. Then a hole would be drilled, giving surgeons a
view of the dura, a tough membrane that covers the brain.
   ``They'll open up the dura and let the fluid out and that would
be the end of it,'' the surgeon predicted just hours before the
operation. Based on a statement released by Reagan's spokesman,
that, apparently, is what happened.
   Brem was not involved in the care and treatment of Reagan, but
did describe how such surgery is accomplished on most patients.
   ``He should do extremely well,'' he said. ``Patients usually do
beautifully in something like this.''
   Doctors at the Mayo Clinic discovered the subdural hematoma
during a routine examination of the 78-year-old former president.
They attributed the collection of fluid on the top, right side of
the brain to a riding accident last July. Reagan was visiting a
ranch in Mexico when a bucking horse threw him to the ground. He was
examined at an Army hospital, but declined to remain overnight after
treatment for bruises and scrapes. The following day, Reagan was
reported to be sore, but in excellent condition.
   Brem said that a collection of fluid in the brain cavity is
``plausible'' after such an accident, even though there was no
obvious head injury.
   Dr. Edward Laws, chairman of neurosurgery at George Washington
University Hospital in Washington, said it would not be surprising
if the jolt from a fall, particularly with an elderly person, would
cause a collection of fluid on the brain.
   ``This is usually because a little blood vessel gets torn and
causes some blood to leak into the space over the surface of the
brain,'' he said. ``As it dissolves, it collects more fluid and
expands.''
   He said it is common practice to remove such fluid collections,
even if they are causing no problems.
   ``They usually continue to enlarge and could ultimately cause
symptoms,'' said Laws. He called the surgical procedure ``routine.''
   Laws said that when blood leaks in the brain cavity it can remain
there and slowly change from a bright red to a black or even yellow
fluid.
   If left untreated, the fluid pool could cause further bleeding
and pressure, which could begin to damage brain cells.
   Neither Brem nor Laws personally knew any details of the Reagan's
medical treatment, and they could not be reached for comment after
the former president's surgery.
   Earlier, Laws, who once worked at Mayo, predicted that the
simplest procedure possible would be used.
   ``My guess is that they will just make a couple of small openings
in the skull and allow the fluid to drain out,'' he said before the
operation. ``That'll take about an hour and a half.''
   According to the spokesman's statement, the surgeons actually
used only one drill hole and completed the procedure ``without
complications'' in just over an hour.
   The statement said ``no further treatment is anticipated,''
suggesting, as Laws had predicted before the operation, that Reagan
``should be good as new.''

for foreign minister told a hearing committee Friday that Poles
forced to remain in the Soviet Union after World War II should be
able to return, the government news agency PAP said.
   Two other Cabinet nominees were rejected but most nominees were
approved on the first day of hearings of a Solidarity-led government
that will end four decades of communist control of foreign affairs,
the news media and economy.
   Eight committees of the Sejm, or lower house of parliament, held
hearings all day. Further sessions were planned through the weekend
to get ready for the vote Tuesday on Mazowiecki's proposed
government.
   PAP said that Krzysztof Skubiszewski, a little-known independent
named to be foreign minister, said Poland's foreign policy must not
depend on any one political party, and also that it was necessary to
make possible the return of Poles kept in the Soviet Union after the
war.
   He made the remarks to the committee responsible for contacts
with Poles living abroad, which along with the Foreign Affairs
Committee approved his nomination, PAP said.
   PAP said Mazowiecki, elected Aug. 24, nominated 19 people
Thursday and four Friday. Mazowiecki is expected to outline his
government's program in a speech Tuesday. He also plans on having a
final list of nominees then.
   It appeared Solidarity would control 13 posts, including prime
minister, on the 24-member Council of Ministers, or Cabinet.
   The Communist Party would have four, the United Peasant Party
four and the Democratic Party three.
   But government and legislative sources said more posts could be
added.
   Late Friday, the parliamentary commission for food and
agriculture voted against the nominations of Czeslaw Janicki of the
Peasant Party and of Artur Balazs of Solidarity, television news
said.
   Janicki, an agriculture professor, was nominated for the combined
post of deputy prime minister and agriculture and Balazs as minister
without portfolio for rural and civic issues.
   TV said voting was secret and gave no reasons for the rejections.
   But a Peasant Party statement had supported Kazimierz Olesiak,
the incumbent agriculture minister and a Peasant Party leader.
Balazs' nomination involved a power struggle between Rural
Solidarity and the Peasant Party.
   The committee votes do not oblige Mazowiecki to withdraw
candidates.
   Besides not getting the Foreign Ministry, the Communist Party was
denied the powerful post of chairman of the radio-TV committee. That
will go to a Solidarity supporter not been named.
   Skubiszewski, an adviser to Roman Catholic church leader Cardinal
Jozef Glemp, was considered a compromise between Solidarity and the
Communists, both of whom wanted the post.
   The pro-Solidarity daily Gazeta Wyborcza called Skubiszewski a
neutral, but Mazowiecki was overheard telling lawmakers the nominee
had been a Solidarity member.
   Skubiszewski told the hearing any disputes between Poland and its
Warsaw Pact neighbors had to be solved peacefully and relations
among pact countries must be based on mutual obligations.
   Among the candidates questioned Friday were:
   Gen. Czeslaw Kiszczak, Mazowiecki's predecessor and candidate to
remain head of the Interior Ministry and a deputy prime minister.
Solidarity activist Jacek Kuron, the minister of labor nominee.
Aleksander Bentkowski, the Peasant Party parliamentary floor leader
nominated to head the Justice Ministry.
   Leszek Balcerowicz, a Solidarity candidate for deputy prime
minister and nominee for the Finance Ministry.
   The delay in providing the list caused confusion as the Communist
Party newspaper Trybuna Ludu, Gazeta Wyborcza and PAP all published
different lists.
   According to PAP, Solidarity will run six government ministries
and Solidarity members were nominated to five other cabinet-rank
positions.
   Jerzy Osiatynski, a Solidarity legislator nominated as head of
the Central Planning Office, and Balazs joined nine other Solidarity
members nominated Thursday.
   That list gives Solidarity 12 votes on the Council of Ministers,
counting Mazowiecki. If Skubiszewski votes with Solidarity, as seems
likely in crucial matters, Solidarity would command a 13-11 edge on
the council.
   Only one woman was among the nominees _ Soliarity's Izabella
Cywinska, a theater director, as culture minister.
   The Communists' Polish United Workers Party, which had directed
the government since 1948, has received nominees for four ministries.
   Besides Kiszczak, Minister of Defense Gen. Florian Siwicki would
retain his job and Communists would receive the Transportation
Ministry and Foreign Trade Ministry.
   Several nominees have been victims of government repression.
Kuron spent nine years in jail and Henryk Samsonowicz, the nominee
for minister of education, was fired as Warsaw University rector
because of his Solidarity sympathies.
   As soon as it is approved the government will face an economy
ravaged by inflation, a chronic shortage of basic goods, low
productivity and a foreign debt of $39 billion.

   One of the two rare beaked whales that
washed up on a San Francisco beach two weeks ago died Friday
afternoon, said a spokesman at Marine World Africa@USA.
   A preliminary necropsy _ an animal autopsy _ showed that the
whale, named Nicholas, died of pneumonia in the right lung and a
failing immune system, spokeswoman Mary O'Herron said.
   The other whale, Alexander, suffers from a milder case of
pneumonia, she said.
   ``All along, Nicholas has been the sicker of the two,'' O'Herron
said. ``But today he was showing signs of improvement. So the mood
is very solemn and very sad.''
   The cetaceans, believed to be the first beaked whales in
captivity, were found on San Francisco's Ocean Beach on Aug. 24 and
taken to Marine World, about 35 miles northeast of San Francisco.

   A chartered plane carrying Norwegian
shipping company officials to a ship-christening in West Germany
crashed in the sea Friday, killing all 55 people aboard, rescue
officials said.
   The twin-engine Convair 440 turboprop plane, belonging to the
Norwegian airline Partnair, was en route from Oslo, Norway, to
Hamburg, West Germany. It crashed in the Skagerrak Strait, a heavily
traveled shipping route that borders Norway, Denmark and Sweden.
   Rescue officials said 32 bodies have been recovered and
helicopters and about 30 vessels, including a West German warship
and fishing trawlers, were searching the 55-degree water for other
victims.
   ``There are no survivors ... the plane disintegrated,'' said Kurt
Rasmussen, an official at the Danish Sea Rescue Center at Karup, on
Denmark's Jutland Peninsula. ``We just found the main wheel floating
and the nose cone.''
   There were 50 passengers and a crew of five aboard, Partnair's
managing director Syvar Leivestad told reporters in Oslo.
   The passengers, most of them top management and half the staff of
the Wilhelmsen Lines shipping company, were chosen by lottery for a
trip that was meant to be a reward, company officials said. All were
Norwegian, the Norwegian NTB news agency said.
   Rescuers said most of the bodies were found within a radius of a
few hundred yards, which would appear to indicate the plane did not
explode in air.
   ``It would be pure speculation to say what caused the crash but
whatever it was it must have happened very suddenly,'' said Rolf
Grimsrud, director of the Norwegian Civil Aviation technical
division.
   ``It could have been an explosion, due to sabotage or something
else or it could have lost a major surface, such as a wing or the
tail,'' he said.
   Grimsrud said the pilots did not send a distress signal even
though the plane was flying at a high enough altitude that they
normally would have had plenty of time even if the engines failed.
   The plane, which took off from Oslo's Fornebu Airport, was flying
at 23,000 feet when air controllers at Copenhagen's Kastrup Airport
lost contact with it, Sweden's national news agency TT reported.
   It went down 18{ miles north of Hirtshals, on Denmark's northern
coast, according to the rescue center at Karup. The crash site is
190 miles northwest of Copenhagen.
   It was the worst crash in Norwegian aviation history. Prime
Minister Gro Harlem Brundtland issued a condolence message and other
party leaders suspended the campaign for Monday's general election.
   A Norwegian commission will investigate the accident because it
happened in international waters, said commission member Ragnar
Rygnestad.
   ``We will try to recover the flight recorder which can tell us a
lot about what happened right up until the accident,'' he said.
   Wilhelmsen Lines owner Wilhelm Wilhemsen said no passenger list
would be available until it was released by Danish authorities who
are in charge of identifying the bodies.
   The Norwegian news agency NTB reported a search vessel carrying
32 bodies arrived at Denmark's North Sea port of Hirtshals.
   Wilhemsen said all of the passengers were employees of his firm,
including 48 from the Wilhelmsen Lines headquarters that employs 110
people.
   The plane, built by the General Dynamics, was 35 years old. Its
engines were refitted about 20 years ago.
   Partnair chief pilot Per Erik Ingjer said he brought the plane
from Canada to Oslo one week ago where it had undergone a five-week
comprehensive maintenance check, including an old-age inspection.
   ``I tested it and there were no problems,'' the pilot said.
Leivestad said the plane had flown four or five trouble-free flights
since then.
   An official of Wilhelmsen said the company had chartered the
flight for a christening in Hamburg, NTB reported. He was not
identified by name.
   The West German navy training ship Deutschland and the tender
Werra picked up 14 of the bodies, according to the West German Naval
Command in Gluecksburg. Other ships and rescue helicopters were at
the scene around nightfall.
   The crash site is near shipping lanes leading from the North Sea
into the Baltic.
   Leivestad said the pilots flying the charter flight were among
the company's most experienced.

<TEXT>
   Twenty decapitated bodies have been found
floating in a river near a jungle camp used by U.S. anti-drug agents
but the grim discovery will not affect the base's operations, a U.S.
Embassy spokesman said Friday.
   The headless cadavers, also without hands and feet, were seen in
the Huallaga River near the U.S.-built base at Santa Lucia, 270
miles northeast of Lima.
   Gene Bigler, U.S. Embassy spokesman, said agents of the U.S. Drug
Endorcement Administration and Peruvian police began launching
anti-drug operations from the new base Thursday. He said there were
no plans to withdraw U.S. personnel because of the bodies.
   Bigler would not say how many agents and contract pilots had
moved into the base or give details on the operations.
   The DEA pulled out of the Huallaga Valley in February after a
contract helicopter pilot was wounded in the leg by a bullet.
   ``The discovery of bodies in the jungle is not a great novelty,''
Bigler said. ``We're fully aware that there is a threat and we make
every effort to protect our people.
   ``It's a war and there is a risk.''
   Peru's armed forces are battling Maoist Shining Path guerrillas
who often work in alliance with drug traffickers in the Upper
Huallaga river valley, one of the world's largest sources of coca
leaf, the raw material for cocaine.
   The army launched an offensive against the guerrillas in the
Upper Huallaga Valley in July and since then some villagers have
claimed civilians disappeared after being detained by troops.
   Military authorities in Lima said they had received no report on
the cadavers.
   Bigler said it was not known who the victims were but, ``Because
of the removal of the hands, there's speculation they may be
traffickers.''
   He said removing the hands would make identification of the
bodies difficult, but he did not elbaorate.
   Bigler said the bodies had been seen ``at the beginning of this
week'' and not on Thursday as a DEA spokesman in Washington reported.
   The DEA spokesman, Frank Shults, said Friday, ``We have no idea
if this was meant to be a signal to anybody, to what purpose and to
whom. There was no note, no messenger, no nothing. No one knows what
to make of it.''
   He added, ``It was an unfriendly message, to be sure.''
   The embassy spokesman said the bodies apparently were seen over a
period of several days.
   An Associated Press reporter who visited the region last week was
told by a village official in La Morada, 15 miles upstream from the
Santa Lucia base, that decapitated bodies were seen shortly after
army troops took away 18 villagers for questioning on Aug. 19.
   ``On Monday, an old woman saw two headless bodies beside the
trail to the river,'' said the official, who asked not to be
identified out of fear for his life. ``The next day three bodies
without heads came by in the river and on Wednesday five more
bodies.''
   Army units have been blamed for the deaths of numerous civilians
in counterinsurgency campaigns in the mountainous region of Ayacucho
southeast of Lima where the Shining Path began its revolt in 1980.
   In August, London-based Amnesty International issued a report
accusing Peru's security forces of massive human rights violations
in the fight against leftist rebels.
   It said a ``pall of terror'' had settled over much of Peru
because of violence by both the rebels and government forces.
   Assassinations and sabotage by the guerrillas has been met with
abductions, torture and killings of suspects by security forces, the
organization said.

<TEXT>
   President Bush, buoyed by a poll showing high
public approval for his anti-drug policies, said Friday the nation
is fighting for ``its very soul'' in the war on drugs.
   Speaking to a meeting of the U.S. Hispanic Chamber of Commerce,
the president cited statistics that, last year, 23 million Americans
had used drugs at least once in the previous month and that, during
the year, 8 million people had used cocaine _ 1 million of them once
a week or more.
   He added:
   ``Last year, hundreds of thousands of babies were born to mothers
who use drugs, babies born desperately sick, weeks or months
premature.
   ``A nation with those numbers cannot long preserve its very
soul.''
   Later, in a speech to the National Baptist Convention here, Bush
said that the drug crisis and other problems facing the nation are
all related to another serious problem _ ``the decline of the most
basic institution of all, the decline of the American family.''
   ``We must work together to save the American family,'' he said in
a crusade-like call to give children the love and support that will
prompt them to choose education over the easy money of crime.
   ``How can you teach respect for a hard-earned dollar when that
easy drug money flourishes out there on the streets?'' he asked to
applause. ``And how can you persuade young men and women to have
faith in themselves when their mother and dad have lost all faith?''
   Bush flew to New Orleans a day after a Washington Post-ABC News
poll showed broad public support for the $7.9 billion anti-drug
strategy he unveiled Tuesday.
   Bush's two appearances here were part of his campaign to rally
public support for his drug-fighting strategy.
   White House Chief of Staff John Sununu told reporters that
September is the critical month for the campaign as the
administration works to gain support while Congress is working on
the federal budget.
   The White House was clearly pleased at the poll results showing
75 percent of those surveyed approved of Bush's handling of the drug
crisis and 82 percent approved of the proposals he announced Tuesday.
   Presidential spokesman Marlin Fitzwater passed out copies of the
poll to reporters flying with the president to New Orleans, circling
the most positive results.
   He did not circle a finding that three out of four people do not
believe Bush is going far enough to attack the root causes of the
drug problem.
   But Fitzwater did say, ``We appreciate the fact that people want
to keep the pressure on us ... we'll be working to make it tougher.''
   Benjamin Hooks, executive director of the National Association
for the Advancement of Colored People, was among those saying the
president's plan does not go far enough.
   ``We've got to convince him that you can't win a war unless
you're willing to spend the money. You can't win a war with a
whimper,'' Hooks said after hearing Bush's speech Friday. ``Whatever
it costs will be small compared to the price of defeat.''
   Bush, in his remarks to the business group, addressed that
criticism, saying ``Those who judge the strategy by its price tag
alone don't understand the problem,'' he said. He said his plan is a
comprehensive program that ``touches every aspect of the drug
problem.''
   ``Nobody believes it will be easy,'' Bush added.
   However, he said later in his speech to the Baptists, `` realize
that nobody's going to do it exactly my way. I would be very close
minded if said you can't have this change or another ...''
   He continued to reject any idea that taxes be raised to pay for a
broader drug war.
   ``The American people know that to some the first and only answer
is to hit the working man or woman with more taxes. That is not the
right answer,'' he said to applause from the Hispanic audience.
   Sununu, addressing criticism that Bush's package is not tough
enough to reign in drug trade and curb illegal drug use, told
reporters that Bush did not want to make the anti-drug effort so
tough that it would take away people's constitutional rights.
   ``I don't think it would have been appropriate to propose a
suspending of constitutional rights. I think the president wants to
go as far as he can without'' such action, Sununu said.
   Despite early Democratic criticism, the chief of staff said he
was pleased that ``Congress seems to be getting into the swim of
things.''
   The Senate ``ought to be complimented'' for voting on Thursday to
cut $45 million from it own funds to spend the money on the drug war.
   As to the administration's position should Congress approve more
money for the drug war than the $7.9 billion Bush proposes, Sununu
said that would be difficult given the constraints of the budget
compromise the administration reached with Congress earlier this
year.
   Sununu added, however, that ``if they can find an appropriate
readjustment of priorities'' in shuffling around money, ``we're not
going to be close-minded if there are good suggestions that come
from Congress.''
   Bush's program, seeking $716 million more than already proposed
in his budget, emphasizes a crackdown on drug users and more money
for prisons, law enforcement and treatment centers, as well as more
money to attack the problem in drug-producing countries.

   Thieves with a penchant for travel recently
returned a wooden rabbit used as lawn ornament along with 48 photos
showing the rambling rabbit in such far-off locales as Reno, Nev.,
and the Virgin Islands.
   The rabbit was taken last December from the lawn of Harry and
Louise West's Reistertown home. It reappeared in August, propped on
the windshield of the couple's car next to a bag of photographs.
   ``There are all kinds of pictures. One where he's building a sand
castle. One where he's looking at the bus station. One at the
airport,'' said Louise West, 68. ``It was gone about a year and just
about two weeks ago my husband went out to get the Sunday paper and
it was sitting on the car.''
   ``We were angry for a while, but then we just forgot about the
missing rabbit,'' said West, 67. ``The rabbit really got around in
those eight months and even had been given a name by its
kidnappers.''
   Mrs. West said the location where the photograph was take was
written on the back of each picture and the initials S.B.R. _
presumably for Stolen Bunny Rabbit _ were written in the margin of
one.
   The rabbit went west to Utah, Kansas City, Mo., and Reno, then
back east to sample the big-city life of New York, Philadelphia and
Atlantic City, N.J.
   Photographs were also taken at the Wright Brother's Museum in
Kitty Hawk, N.C., Florida's Disney World, Annapolis, Md., Bermuda,
and St. Thomas.
   The well-traveled hare was even photographed with Baltimore Mayor
Kurt Schmoke, who is shown holding it in his right hand.
   ``How in the world the person got the mayor to pose with the
rabbit, I can't imagine,'' West told the Carroll County Times.
   But Schmoke never saw or touched the rabbit, his press secretary,
Clinton Coleman, said Friday.
   ``The mayor has never seen the rabbit. He's never held onto that
rabbit before,'' Coleman said. ``Apparently it's somebody's idea of
a joke.''
   In one photograph a woman wearing sunglasses is holding the
rabbit, but Mrs. West said she did not recognize her.
   ``Two of them are a photograph with a girl in it and another is a
scuba diver, a girl,'' Mrs. West said. ``But we don't know who did
it really. ... It's not anybody that I recognize.''
   The rabbit's rambles were similar to the ``journey'' earlier this
year of Grumpy, one of seven lawn dwarfs, who disappeared from the
front of a Saugerties, N.Y., couple's home on March 16.
   The 80-pound lawn ornament returned April 26, with an
accompanying envelope containing 35 photographs of his travels,
which included visits to New York's Yankee Stadium, Colorado, the
Carolinas, Texas and St. Louis.
   A sign dangling from Grumpy's shoulders said, ``I'm home.''

   More than half the money to pay for President
Bush's war on drugs would be cut from programs that primarily assist
low-income families and less than one-fifth would come from defense,
a private research group said.
   The Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a
foundation-supported nonpartisan group generally identified with
liberal positions, said $410 million, or 55 per cent of the $751
million in cuts, would come from low-income programs.
   The center also argued all those cuts would reduce or terminate
programs, while the only cut from the Pentagon budget would merely
force postponment until a future year of the purchase of a $132
million communications system.
   The organization analyzed proposed reductions in funds for public
housing, juvenile justice and assistance to recent immigrants.
   It took issue with Bush's statement in his speech Tuesday that he
is ``targeting $50 million to fight crime in public housing projects
_ to help restore order, and to kick out the dealers for good.''
   ``The president failed to note that funds for these efforts would
come from cutbacks in funds for the basic operation of such
projects,'' the center said.
   ``Specifically, the president proposes cutting by $50 million the
amount that the House of Representatives has recently appropriated
for fiscal year 1990 federal subsidies for the operation of public
housing projects.
   ``Thus, on the one hand, the president is proposing to rid public
housing of drugs by providing the funds to hire additional security
guards and support innovative drug reduction programs,'' the group
said. ``On the other hand, the president's proposal ... will allow
for further physical deterioration of the housing conditions, which
in turn could hamper drug eradication efforts.''
   The report also criticized Bush's proposal to cut $40 million
from grants to states for juvenile justice and juvenile deliquency
prevention programs. The Reagan and Bush administrations have sought
to eliminate the programs on grounds their goals, including keeping
young prisoners separate from adults, have been met.
   But the center said 1987 Justice Department figures show only
about half the states in full or substantial compliance with the
separation of prisoners. The House has approved $69 million for the
programs, which Bush wants reduced to $29 million.
   The largest reduction proposed to fund the drug strategy, the
center said, is a $320 million cut in grants to states for
financial, medical and education aid to 3 million recent immigrants
who gained temporary legal status under the 1986 Immigration Reform
Act.
   The administration says the appropriation can be safely reduced
because states have been slow to spend $1.6 billion already
appropriated. The center agreed states have been spending the money
more slowly than expected, but quoted the Congressional Budget
Office as saying all of the appropriated funds would be used by the
end of 1994.

   Hurricane Gabrielle churned north toward Canada's
Maritime Provinces with 100-mph winds Friday after brushing by
Bermuda, and Tropical Storm Felix was expected to be gobbled up by
the bigger storm.
   Swells of 20 feet hit the eastern tip of Bermuda, causing damage
to a house Thursday as winds on the fringes of Gabrielle gusted to
35 mph, said the National Hurricane Center in suburban Coral Gables.
   ``They were right on the edge of the hurricane so they really
didn't get very much, at least in terms of wind and rain,'' said
meteorologist Jack Beven, ``The seas and waves are something else
entirely.''
   Marine traffic was idled in Bermuda as the storm stirred up
10-foot swells even in harbors. Heavy surf from New England to
central Florida also was blamed on Gabrielle.
   At 10:30 p.m. EDT, the center of Gabrielle, the second hurricane
of the season to approach Bermuda, was located near 37.8 north
latitude and 59.7 west longitude, or about 425 miles south of Sable
Island, Nova Scotia.
   ``The center is already east of the easternmost longitude of Nova
Scotia,'' which should keep hurricane-strength winds away from
Canada, Beven said. ``It may come closer to Newfoundland than Nova
Scotia, although at this time we're not predicting it to go over
either one.''
   The hurricane was moving north at 12 mph, but forecasters
expected a turn to the north-northeast in the next day.
   A gradual decrease in strength and forward speed is projected in
the next day or two. But Gabrielle, which peaked at 135 mph, should
keep hurricane-strength winds of at least 74 mph for at least three
days, Beven said.
   Meanwhile, Felix, which has rumbled around the Atlantic as both a
storm and a weak hurricane, was expected to rapidly weaken in the
next 12 to 24 hours as Gabrielle cuts into it.
   Felix also was expected to lose all tropical characteristics. The
hurricane center said it would issue no more advisories on the
system.
   At 6 p.m. EDT, Felix was located near 45 degrees north latitude
and 43 degrees west longitude, or about 500 miles east southeast of
Cape Race, Newfoundland, and moving to the northeast at 15 mph.
   Five hurricanes have formed in the current Atlantic hurricane
season, which began June 1 and lasts until Nov. 30.

<HEAD>State Judge Allows Bush Administration To Enter Shoreham Case</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARC HUMBERT</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>TROY, N.Y. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Bush administration, the most powerful
opponent of Gov. Mario Cuomo's plan to tear down the Shoreham
nuclear power plant, got permission Thursday to join the state court
fight against the governor.
   State Supreme Court Justice F. Warren Travers ruled that the
federal Department of Energy was an ``interested party'' in the case
through its ownership of the Brookhaven National Laboratory on Long
Island.
   Travers noted that Brookhaven lies on 5,000 acres of federal land
and that the DOE intends to purchase 41,000 megawatt hours of
electricity from LILCO this year at a cost of more than $3 million.
   ``Here, where DOE is a landowner and user of power provided by
LILCO, the Court, in its discretion determines that DOE should be
allowed to and is granted permission to intervene,'' the judge said.
   In New York, the state Supreme Court is a trial-level court.
   Cuomo spokesman Gary Fryer said the decision was not surprising,
but said the Bush administration was ``obviously trying to defend
their ideological interests here regardless of the cost to the
ratepayers of Long Island.''
   Cuomo has argued that operating Shoreham or simply mothballing
it, as the Bush administration has suggested, would be more
expensive than tearing it down.
   The Bush administration, which is also battling the Shoreham
agreement before the federal Nuclear Regulatory Commission, has said
it would be foolish to dismantle a completed nuclear power plant.
   Under the Shoreham deal, negotiated by Cuomo and Long Island
Lighting Company officials, the state will buy the $5.5 billion
finished plant on Long Island from LILCO for $1 and have it
dismantled at LILCO's expense.
   In return, LILCO gets at least a decade of annual electric rate
increases of about 5 percent each. The Shoreham project had taken
LILCO to the brink of bankruptcy and LILCO customers already pay
among the highest rates in the nation.
   Should the agreement be completed, it would be the first time a
completed nuclear power plant was torn down without going to full
power. The pact already has been approved by the required state
agencies and by LILCO stockholders.
   Cuomo and local Long Island officials have argued that Shoreham
shouldn't operate because the Suffolk County area couldn't be safely
evacuated in an emergency.
   The DOE is joining a lawsuit filed against the Shoreham agreement
by the conservative-oriented Atlantic Legal Foundation. The lawsuit
asks Travers to rule that Cuomo's Shoreham-closing deal is illegal.
   The lawsuit argues, among other points, that Cuomo usurped the
power of the state Legislature in negotiating the Shoreham deal.

<HEAD>Government Presents Evidence in Marcos Trial</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By EILEEN GUERRERO</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MANILA, Philippines (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government began presenting
evidence Thursday in an $810 million civil suit against Ferdinand
Marcos, the first case against the ousted president to be tried in a
Philippine court.
   The suit is among 35 civil actions filed by the government in
1987 to recover the billions of dollars Marcos and his associates
allegedly embezzled before he was ousted in 1986 and forced into
exile in Hawaii.
   Solicitor Gen. Frank Chavez said he hoped the trial would
convince courts in Switzerland and elsewhere to speed up proceedings
to recover money that Marcos allegedly stashed abroad.
   Government lawyers said they will show that Marcos and his wife
Imelda owned properties worth far more than they could afford on
income declared in tax returns.
   Eliseo Pitargue, intelligence chief of the Bureau of Internal
Revenue, testified that between 1960 and 1984, the couple declared
total assets of $657,000.
   The government claims Marcos and his friends embezzled up to $10
billion.
   President Corazon Aquino has refused to allow Marcos to return to
the Philippines, citing national security. Marcos is reported in
critical condition at a Honolulu hospital, where he has been
confined since January with heart, kidney and lung failure.
   Marcos and Imelda were indicted by a U.S. federal grand jury in
1988 on racketeering charges. But they have not been criminally
charged in the Philippines because the constitution allows them to
return to face their accusers.
   Meanwhile, a Marcos spokesman returned to the Philippines on
Thursday after quitting his job and giving up an appeal for asylum
in the United States.
   Guillermo ``Gemmo'' Trinidad, 45, arrived on a flight from
Honolulu. Officials said there were no charges pending against him.
   Trinidad entered the United States in March 1986 on a tourist
visa, one month after Marcos was ousted in a popular uprising and
forced into exile in Hawaii.
   After the Immigration and Naturalization Service began
deportation proceedings against him in January for overstaying his
visa, Trinidad applied for political asylum, claiming his life would
be in danger in the Philippines.
   His attorney, Ronald Oldenburg, said Trinidad withdrew the
application for political asylum Tuesday and the U.S. granted him a
voluntary departure order, meaning the deportation proceedings would
be suspended.
   Also Thursday, Mrs. Aquino said there would be ``no whitewash''
of a congressman accused of gun smuggling. She defended her brother
against rumors he was involved.
   Customs agents at Ninoy Aquino International Airport seized 314
handguns and rifles from baggage allegedly belonging to Rep. Nicanor
de Guzman and businessman Ponciano Datu, who arrived Tuesday on a
flight from San Francisco.
   De Guzman, a member of the pro-Aquino Struggle of the Democratic
Filipino party, denies the weapons were his. De Guzman went on
indefinite leave without pay Thursday pending the outcome of the
investigation.
   ``I will be sharing with you whatever reports come in to assure
you that definitely there will be no whitewash,'' Mrs. Aquino said
at a news conference.
   Mrs. Aquino also said her politically powerful brother Rep. Jose
Cojuangco Jr., assured her that he was not involved in gun
smuggling, as some Manila newspapers alleged.
   Opposition politicians and several newspapers claim Mrs. Aquino's
relatives are guilty of the same brand of influence-peddling that
was rampant under Marcos.

   A former PTL board member testified
Thursday he didn't know about hush money paid Jessica Hahn until two
months before Bakker quit the television ministry over the sex and
money scandal.
   ``I never knew the name Jessica Hahn until January 1987,'' Ernie
Franzone of Fort Lauderdale, Fla., said at Bakker's federal trial on
fraud and conspiracy charges.
   Other testimony centered on cash flow problems at the ministry,
including problems at its flagship hotel at the same time Bakker was
insisting on such touches as a $15,000 chandelier, despite millions
of dollars that were pledged daily.
   PTL paid Ms. Hahn $265,000 in 1985 to keep quiet about her sexual
encounter with Bakker on Dec. 6, 1980, at a Florida hotel. Bakker
resigned in March 1987 as PTL chief. The Hahn payment was made by
PTL's builder, who then added the amount to his bill.
   Bakker, 49, is being tried on 24 counts of fraud and conspiracy.
Prosecutors say Bakker used nearly $4 million in ministry funds
obtained from the sale of partnerships in the ministry's hotel to
bankroll his extravagant lifestyle.
   Thursday's was the first full day of testimony after the trial
resumed following Bakker's breakdown and commitment in a federal
prison for psychiatric evaluation last week.
   U.S. District Judge Robert Potter let the trial resume Wednesday,
and denied a defense motion for a mistrial after a government
psychiatrist that Bakker had suffered a ``panic attack'' last week
but was competent to stand trial.
   Bakker's lawyers asked the 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in
Richmond on Thursday to halt Bakker's trial, citing possible grand
jury misconduct.
   The lawyers claim Ms. Hahn told Charlotte radio station WRFX that
grand jurors approached her in a courtroom restroom and asked for
her autograph during a break in her testimony in September 1987.
   Bakker's attorneys contend the grand jurors violated their oath
of impartiality. One of the lawyers, Harold Bender, said he had no
word on the status of the appeal.
   Bakker was composed during Thursday's testimony, taking notes and
talking with his attorneys as witnesses testified. As he left the
courtroom late in the afternoon, Bakker waved to supporters and
said, ``I'm looking for the weekend.''
   Franzone, regional manager of the company that managed Bakker's
Heritage Grand Hotel, said he wouldn't have approved bonuses for
Bakker, his wife, Tammy, and former PTL Executive Vice President
Richard Dortch had he known about Ms. Hahn. Dortch has been
sentenced to eight years in prison and fined $200,000 for his guilty
plea to four fraud and conspiracy charges.
   ``That would have been the red light for me,'' Franzone
testified. ``I would have taken another look at whether I would have
stayed on the board.''
   Franzone also said he never remembered voting a bonus for Bakker
of more than $100,000 although the board's minutes show Bakker
frequently received bonuses double that amount.
   But he said he approved bonuses up to $100,000 because ``I
believed PTL was in good financial condition. So many things were
positive about PTL. So much was being done so well.''
   Franzone also said he never was told that bonuses were usually
doubled so the recipients could pay the income tax on them.
   In other testimony, Lamar Kerstetter, a retired Pennsylvania coal
miner, said he purchased a ``Family Fun Partnership'' from PTL in
March 1987, the same month that Bakker resigned.
   Assistant U.S. Attorney Jerry Miller asked Kerstetter what he
expected to get for his $1,000 payment to PTL.
   ``My four days and three nights (of free lodging),'' Kerstetter
responded. ``I was buying a product. I was buying lodging and use of
the park.''
   After discovering that the free lodging offer was good only for
the uncompleted Towers Hotel, rather than the ministry's Heritage
Grand Hotel in Fort Mill, S.C., Kerstetter asked for a refund. He
said he got a letter, dated about the time the ministry filed for
bankruptcy, saying he could not get a refund immediately because PTL
was in a ``crucial period in its transition.''
   Dana Angel of Atlantic Beach, Fla., and her mother, Lila Angel,
89, testified that they jointly bought a lifetime partnership in
1986, putting $500 each on their credit cards so she and her mother
could spend a week at the Heritage Grand Hotel.
   Lila Angel testified that she enjoyed going to Heritage USA, but
that she expected a return for her money.
   ``I worked until I was 77, and I save my pennies. I still do.
That $500 was quite a bit of money for me,'' she said.
   The prosecution also presented witnesses who testified about
Bakker's buying habits.
   Frederick Gunzel, who operates an air charter service, said he
was hired to fly Bakker and his wife, Tammy, from Charlotte to Palm
Springs, Calif., and back at a cost of $102,000 in July 1984.
   Ron Shue, a salesman for Beck Mercedes in Charlotte, said he sold
two 1987 Mercedes 560SL sedans to Bakker _ one for $61,191 and the
other for $59,000. He said a used 1985 Mercedes station wagon was
purchased for the Bakkers' children at a cost of $28,000.
   Earlier, a former PTL bookkeeper testified that during one week
in 1986, PTL raised $17 million and deposited more than $365,000 in
cash donations.
   Delores Jones, who kept the weekly ledger of contributions
beginning in 1981, said the ministry collected $20,000 in cash from
offering plates passed at PTL's Sunday services and from the
audience at the ministry's television show.
   Ms. Jones said the rest of the $17 million in collections that
week were from lifetime partnerships that offered contributors three
nights of free lodging a year in exchange for $1,000 donations.
   The former manager of the 500-room Heritage Grand Hotel testified
that he faced cash-flow problems almost from the day the hotel
opened in December 1984.
   William Maybrey, the general manager of Heritage Grand Hotel from
April 1984 to December 1985, said Bakker was involved in hotel
management after it opened in December 1984, even down to helping
design staff uniforms.
   Dortch told him not to worry about the cash-flow problems, even
as Bakker was insisting on additional staff members to shorten the
reservations line and a $15,000 chandelier for a hotel hallway,
Maybrey said.

   Senate tax-writers swamped by complaints from
retirees are weighing whether to raise Social Security taxes on
workers and their employers to help pay for Medicare catastrophic
insurance for older Americans.
   ``You almost have a sense when you go home of being unwanted,
unloved and unappreciated on this issue,'' Sen. Robert Packwood,
R-Ore., said Thursday as the Senate Finance Committee began
considering how to respond to the complaints.
   The tax increase, which probably would be opposed by the Bush

considering.
   The catastrophic insurance program, aimed at protecting retirees
from being bankrupted by a catastrophic illness, has been under
attack since it was enacted a year ago as an expansion of Medicare.

   Lawmakers from tobacco-growing states are
trying to figure out how to fend off a proposal headed for the
Senate floor that would permanently ban cigarette smoking on all
domestic airline flights.
   The Senate Appropriations Committee voted 17-0 Thursday for
legislation containing the ban, setting up a likely vote by the full
Senate next Tuesday.
   The smoking provision, broadening the prohibition against smoking
on flights of two hours or less, is part of an $11.9 billion measure
for transportation programs for fiscal 1990, which begins Oct. 1.
   The ban survived an effort by Sen. Thad Cochran, R-Miss., to
dilute the proposal by simply making it a permanent extension of the
ban on smoking aboard two-hour flights. Cochran's amendment was
defeated 18-11, with panel Democrats voting 11-5 and Republicans
voting 7-6 against it.

officials believe caused the blast that killed 47 sailors aboard the
USS Iowa.
   A report on the April 19 explosion released Thursday by the
Pentagon said ``circumstantial evidence'' indicated that gunner's
mate Clayton M. Hartwig intentionally sparked the explosion.
   The family of the 25-year-old sailor contends the Navy made him a
scapegoat for its negligence.
   More than 1,100 pages of evidence released with the report
depicted Hartwig as an expert in explosives who had trouble making
friends, had once attempted suicide and 11 days before the explosion
said he might ``become one of those little white headstones in
Arlington National Cemetery any day.''

   The Energy Department says it will resume
production of tritium, an increasingly scarce gas needed to make
nuclear warheads, in fall 1990 despite urgings by environmental
groups for a further delay.
   The first of three tritium-producing reactors at the department's
Savannah River complex near Aiken, S.C., will begin low-power
testing late next summer, and production is expected to start
between October and December 1990, Energy Secretary James D. Watkins
said Thursday after briefing White House officials on the plan.
   Watkins said precise dates for the restart schedule will not be
set before next April after department officials review progress in
a broad management and mechanical overhaul under way at Savannah
River since last fall.
   The three active reactors at Savannah River _ designated K, L and
P _ are the nation's only source of tritium, a manmade hydrogen
isotope used to boost the destructive power of nuclear weapons. All
three have been out of operation since spring 1988.

   On Sept. 30, 1987, Wright Investors' Service
published a rare special report warning that stocks were overpriced
and headed for a sharp and substantial decline.
   ``In some ways,'' said Wright, an international firm based in
Bridgeport, Conn., ``the current situation is comparable to that
which preceded the great stock market crash of 1929.''
   Barely two weeks later, on Oct. 19, 1987, the market collapsed
again.
   This week Wright issued another special report, ``to document our
view that a stock market correction _ one stopping far short of the
decline witnessed two years ago, but significant nevertheless _ does
indeed lie ahead.''
   The firm, which handles portfolios in the billions of dollars and
advises the trust departments of many banks, prides itself on
objective analysis rather than opinion, which is often the staple of
brokerage house forecasts.
   In 1987, for example, it observed that the price-earnings ratio
of the Standard &amp; Poor's composite index was exceptionally high at
22, higher even than the 19.9 prior to the 1929 crash. And it noted
that the dividend yield of the S&amp;P 500-stock index of 2.6 percent
was approaching the 3 percent of 1929.
   This week's report offers this rationale:
   1. Stock prices are too high relative to both historical
valuations and the current level of interest rates.
   2. The U.S. economy is in the process of slowing.
   3. Corporate profit growth is about to come to a halt.
   Conclusion: ``This combination of factors suuggests to us that a
significant reversal of the stock market's recent gains may be under
way before 1989 is over.''
   Partly obscuring the current vulnerability, Wright says, is the
fact that price-earnings ratios, at 14, are not exceptionally high.
Still, they are higher than the post-1950 average of 12, based on
the S&amp;P 500-stock index.
   What happens when profits decline? Already, Wright points out,
growth of ``real'' profits _ after taxes, excluding profits from
inventory inflation and adjusted for depreciation _ have slowed 14
percent from the 1986 peak.
   The special report states that stock prices appear in their worst
light when matched against corporate book values. Both the Dow Jones
industrial average and the S&amp;P 500 are now priced at 2.4 times book
value.
   Wright comments that ``since 1930, the market has been priced
higher relative to book value only once, in the summer of 1987, just
before the stock market crash.''
   While some analysts minimize the significance of book values,
some of which have been distorted by corporate repurchases of
shares, Wright calls attention to a recurring phenomenon: for 40
years, two times book value has put a ceiling on prices.
   Such factors become even more significant as the economy slows.
Adjusted for inflation, retail sales are only 1 percent ahead of
last year's pace. Factory orders are down. Manufacturing activity
has leveled off.
   Wright also refers to the money supply in support of its
conclusions. Despite recent easing, the money supply fell 2.5
percent in the year ended June 1989. Since 1954, declines of that
magnitude have been followed by recession.
   Corporate profits offer little support for the market. Already
profit growth has slowed. ``Real'' profits _ after taxes, excluding
profits from inventory inflation and adjusted for depreciation _ are
well below their peaks.
   Since 1986, Wright observes, real corporate profits from
operations have declined 14 percent. In its opinion, further
deterioration is likely.
   Since stocks often interact with the level of interest rates on
bonds, Wright examined that too, and found it negative.
   To bring stock and bond prices into relationship with averages
over the 1969-1988 period, Wright believes one or a combination of
these would have to occur:
   1. A corporate earnings rise (unlikely) of 12 percent to 15
percent.
   2. A reduction of bond yields by about one full percentage point.
   3. A fall off in stock prices of more than 10 percent.
   In summary, Wright is telling clients that the returns on stocks
are likely to be negative over the next 12 to 18 months, and that
they might be better off in long-term bonds.
   By then the old relationships of the various averages are likely
to be restored. Then, Wright says, ``we anticipate the start of a
new bull market.''

   Some 70 years after the Habsburgs,

Europe, aristocrats from Portugal to the Balkans see a greater role
for the nobility after 1992.
   That is when the 12 nations of the European Economic Community

become more closely linked.
   More than 200 princes, counts and other bluebloods from 11
countries gathered here recently for the 12th congress of the
Information and Liaison Commission of European Nobility Associations
to redefine their mission in the modern world and they had a lot to
say about their places in Europe after 1992.
   Addressing the congress at an upper-crust Oporto Hotel, Baron
Bernard Snoy of Belgium said noble traditions of cosmopolitan
spirit, courage, selflessness and the motto ``jamais mediocre''
(never mediocre) meant ancient families should provide social, moral
and cultural leadership.
   He added that 1992 will be ``a unique occasion ... for (our)
families to rediscover their identity and renew their `raison
d'etre'.''
   The congress was conducted in French.
   Snoy noted proudly that a dozen nobles already are members of the
518-member European Parliament and many are fully integrated in
other EEC institutions, such as the Court of Justice and the
European Investment Bank.
   Count Richard Coudenhove-Kalgeri, born of Austrian and Japanese
parents in Bohemia, now part of Czechoslovakia, produced the first
modern project for a united Europe in his book ``Pan Europe,''
published in 1923. In 1946, he founded the European Parliamentary
Union, a precursor of today's European Parliament.
   Otto von Habsburg, son of Emperor Charles and the Empress Zita,
the Austro-Hungarian monarchs, succeeded Kalgeri as president of the
Pan-European Union in 1973.
   Habsburg, who was re-elected to the European Parliament in June,
favors the adoption of EEC passports for people of the 12 member
nations _ Belgium, Britain, Denmark, France, West Germany, Greece,
Ireland, Italy, Luxembourg, Netherlands, Portugal and Spain.
   He maintains EEC must expand and ``keep its doors open to all
European peoples.''
   Said Prince Johannes zu Loewenstein-Wertheim-Rosenberg, president
of the West German Association of Aristocratic Unions: ``As Europe
grows together, aristocracy definitely has something to contribute.
We've always been more European than narrowly nationalist.''
   Loewenstein, whose ancestors hobnobbed with modern Germany's
founding father, Prince Otto von Bismarck, cited the habit of
France's King Louis XIV of inviting English gentlemen to supper,
even when the two countries were at war.
   He noted that the Habsburg Emperor Franz Joseph ``even lent
Serbia's chief of staff his personal carriage to leave Austria when
they went to war in 1914.''
   A landowner and consultant for a private bank in Frankfurt in
West Germany, the silver-haired Loewenstein said German nobility are
careful not to make potentially controversial political statements.
He refused to comment, for example, on the question of reunification
of Germany.
   Standing next to blue and gold heraldic tapestries outside the
congress hall, the Russian Prince Serge Obolensky sipped from a
long-stemmed glass and pondered the changes in the Soviet Union,
which his family fled in 1920 when he was 2 years old.
   He said he is not too optimistic about President Mikhail S.
Gorbachev's glasnost and perestroika reforms.
   ``Twice in Soviet history, we've seen major attempts at reform,
one was the New Economic Policy in the 1920s and the other was
Khrushchev's attempt in the 1950s _ both failed,'' he said,
referring to the late Soviet leader Nikita S. Khrushchev.
   ``I'm still waiting to see real signs of change; I've been
waiting for over 60 years.''
   The year 1992 also marks the 200th anniversary of the final
demise of the French monarchy following the 1789 revolution. King
Louis XVI was executed in January 1793, along with his Austrian
wife, Marie Antoinette.
   Modern-day aristocrats, Loewenstein says, must serve as a social
example because of their educational and economic priveleges.
   While German aristocrats make up about 0.8 percent of the
country's 61 million people, they account for 15 percent of
top-level banking executives and 8 percent to 10 percent of the
country's politicians, he said.
   In Britain, where the royal family and pageantry are part of
national life, a Sunday Times Magazine study found that of the
country's 200 richest people were 11 of the 25 dukes, six
marquesses, 14 earls and nine viscounts. Queen Elizabeth II is by
far the richest with assets worth $8 billion.
   In a recent interview, Gerald Cavendish Grosvenor, the sixth Duke
of Westminster and reputedly Britain's richest man with about $5
billion, said, ``If you are given a lot, I think you should give a
lot back.''
   He added that it was a sense of duty that pushes him to spend
one-third of his time supporting some 150 charities.

   The sexual revolution had arrived at a small
knick-knack stand outside Moscow's Kiev Train Station but not to the
liking of a middle-aged woman.
   ``What a disgrace!'' she snapped, shaking her finger at the
girlie photos that were attacting a crowd.
   ``Why? They're only Soviet women,'' the vendor retorted.
   ``No, they're not Soviet women. Soviet women are always
covered,'' she declared, and marched on.
   ``Because of people like that, Soviets are full of taboos,'' the
vendor shouted after her.
   The exchange typified the small storm of controversy these days
over the wave of what is being called ``erotica'' _ a rash of
posters, playing cards and calendars that would raise no eyebrows
these days in the West.
   A reporter for the Communist Party newspaper Pravda in
Novosibirsk was outraged that kiosks in that Siberian city were
plastered with photos of naked women ``aimed at the dubious tastes
of young and aging sex maniacs.''
   Such ``decadence and vulgarity'' compromise the openness fostered
by the Kremlin's reforms, Yuri Solomenko wrote.
   On the contrary, argued Natalia Rtishcheva in an article
published in the weekly Literaturnaya Gazeta supporting steamier
love scenes.
   ``Finally, we've proven that Soviet people have a sexual
imagination,'' she wrote. ``And our men and women do occasionally
get into bed intending to do more than read a tome of their favorite
poet.''
   All pornography has long been banned in the Soviet Union,
although a black market in smuggled videos and magazines flourishes.
Love scenes in Soviet movies never went beyond staid embraces, and
the heroic figures of official Soviet art were always decorously
clothed.
   Rtishcheva said her mother started to cry after watching ``Little
Vera,'' the movie that shocked Soviet viewers last year with a sex
scene that would barely get an American movie an R rating.
   ``There was nothing to comfort her with,'' she wrote in the
literary journal. ``The times of shy kisses and the embarrassed
ladies of the comedies of the prewar period have truly passed.''
   In August, the hot movie in Moscow was ``Interdevochka''
(``Intergirl''), a sympathetic portrayal of a prostitute who plies
her trade for foreign currency, marries a Swede and escapes her
sordid hotel life, only to be tortured by nostalgia and her past
reputation.
   Crowds pack the theater to see hooker-with-heart Tanya Zaitseva
(played by Yelena Yakovleva) strut in skimpy underwear and suffer
the lucrative advances of a Japanese businessman.
   The Kremlin's new tolerance along with its economic reforms
brought about the surge of soft-porn. The main producers of
flesh-shot postcards, posters and calendars are cooperatives, the
private businesses created to fill gaps in consumer demand.
   The producers sensed a hot market and turned out nude-with-snake
posters available around Moscow and girlie playing cards on sale
next to kitsch paintings at the capital's main art fair at Izmailovo
Park.
   Artists at Izmailovo and along the Arbat pedestrian mall are also
turning out a great many idealized nudes that would look equally at
home on black velvet at an American flea market.
   The vendor outside the Kiev Train Station copies pictures from
Western skin magazines and pastes them to cardboard-and-felt wallets
that he can then sell for a hefty $13. People complain about the
prices, he said, but they buy.
   In another example of the new Soviet permissiveness, Moscow's
Arbat restaurant features male and female dancers with nothing but
G-strings in a suggestive pas-de-deux. On a recent evening, the show
was in such demand diners could gain entrance only by bribing the
doorman.
   Nudity in the theater is also on the rise, and Leningrad now has
a modern dance group that residents refer to as ``The Erotic
Ballet.''
   The trend of sexual glasnost (openness) has its legitimate side
as well: It answers not only the hunger for sexual excitement but
also the need for basic, Masters-and-Johnson-type sexual information.
   A recent article in the popular medical journal Your Health
provides graphic tips on female sexuality and how couples can
improve their bedroom lives. Its pragmatic approach bears little
resemblance to Soviet health magazines' traditional reliance on
vague abstractions about ``socialist families'' when giving sexual
advice.
   Even works by Sigmund Freud, long condemned as bourgeois
reactionary ideology and left unpublished, are coming out in record
number, printed both by cooperatives and by the state publishing
committee Goskomizdat.
   Although there is still virtually no sex education as such, a
powerful publicity campaign against AIDS is under way.
   A recent ``Interdevochka'' screening was preceded by a
hard-hitting documentary on AIDS aimed at young people. But it did
not offer any hints on how to obtain condoms and disposable needles,
which are in such short supply they are in demand on the black
market.

   Arleigh Burke has slowed his pace from the
boiler-bursting speeds that got him the nickname ``31-Knot Burke''
in World War II, but the retired admiral still feels a sailor's tug
toward the sea at age 87.
   The first ship in an advanced class of guided missile destroyers
will be christened with Burke's name next Saturday at a Maine
shipyard, and the former chief of naval operations under President
Eisenhower is eager for a sea trial.
   ``They've already promised me that I can take her to sea
someday,'' Burke said in an interview. ``It isn't that I want to
make sure the ship is up to snuff; I want to see if I'm still up to
snuff.''
   The Arleigh Burke is one of only three Navy vessels to be named
for a living individual. Also honored before their deaths were
former Rep. Carl Vinson, D-Ga., and Adm. Hyman G. Rickover.
   Burke shrugs off his wartime exploits as commander of the
``Little Beavers'' destroyer squadron, which fought 22 combat
engagements in the Pacific in a four-month period, and his prescient
actions as chief of naval operations for an unprecedented six years,
1955-1961.
   ``The nicest thing about the Navy is that people give credit for
things that were done by a lot of other people,'' said Burke. ``You
suddenly realize, when you get to be an old man, that what you're
getting credit for is what other people did.''
   It was in the Battle of Cape St. George in the Solomon Islands
that Burke gained the ``31-knot'' nickname as he pushed his squadron
forward on Thanksgiving Day 1943 to keep the Japanese from
evacuating Buka Island.
   Burke's message to U.S. transports lying ahead: ``Stand aside.
I'm coming through at 31 knots.''
   When the battle was over, the squadron had sunk three Japanese
destroyers in what the Naval War College later called ``an almost
perfect action.''
   In his post-battle report, Burke attributed the success of the
operation in part to the luck of good timing and said the battle
``should clearly demonstrate that the fortune of war is a fickle
wench and that results hang by a narrow thread.''
   The Little Beavers, so named because Burke trimmed each ship with
an insignia representing a Red Ryder comic strip character by that
name, were credited with destroying one Japanese cruiser, nine
destroyers, one submarine, several smaller vessels and about 30
enemy aircraft from November 1943 to February 1944.
   One young ensign who went on to become a vice admiral, Raymond E.
Peet, recalled of Burke: ``The squadron would have gone any place
with that man. If he were going to take us to Japan, we were all
ready to go. He was that type of leader.''
   In March 1944, Burke was assigned as chief of staff to Rear Adm.
Marc A. Mitscher, commander of the carrier task force that executed
attacks on Iwo Jima, Okinawa and Tokyo. Mitscher, who initially had
misgivings about taking on a non-aviator as chief of staff, later
praised Burke as ``the most outstanding tactician and the most
experienced officer in the American fleet.''
   Burke recalls that he made it a point to prove himself as an
aviator while assigned to the task force, saying ``I felt I couldn't
be chief of staff to an aviation outfit unless I could fly.''
   He flew combat missions and was aboard two ships _ the Bunker
Hill and Enterprise _ that were hit by Japanese suicide planes in
the Okinawa campaign.
   Over his wartime years, Burke was honored with 13 decorations,
including the Navy Cross, two Distinguished Service Medals, two
Legions of Merit and the Silver Star Medal.
   After the war, Burke found himself engaged in new battles at
home. He fell into disfavor with some Pentagon officials for his
role in the 1949 ``admirals' revolt'' against plans to place more
emphasis on the Air Force B-36 bomber.
   His name was stricken from a naval promotions list, and restored
only after intervention by then-Chief of Naval Operations Adm.
Forrest Sherman.
   In 1955, Burke reluctantly agreed to serve as Eisenhower's chief
of naval operations when he was tapped over 92 more senior officers.
   Burke expressed concern he had been selected ``because they
thought I might be a pushover,'' but his CNO predecessor and
longtime friend, Adm. Robert B. Carney, assured him that if that
were the case, ``they are due for a hell of a surprise.''
   As CNO, Burke's priorities included pushing for new
anti-submarine technology, upgrading the U.S. submarine fleet,
developing new missile systems including one that became the Polaris
missile, reinforcing the navies of U.S. allies, particularly Japan,
and improving communication and morale within the Navy.
   Twice he argued against reappointment to another two-year term,
and twice he agreed to stay on at Eisenhower's insistence. When
President Kennedy offered him a fourth term, Burke insisted on
retiring at age 59.
   Following his retirement, Burke served on the boards of numerous
corporations and worked with organizations such as the Boy Scouts of
America. He and his wife, Roberta, whom he married the day he
graduated from the Naval Academy in 1923, had no children.
   Looking back over his military career, Burke recalls most fondly
his first command, the destroyer Mugford in 1939.
   ``A ship to a sailor, particularly a first ship, is always the
most memorable one,'' he said. ``The first time a man is skipper of
a ship, he thinks that there is no ship like that before that's ever
been made.''

<HEAD>Ted Koppel Explores What TV Hath Wrought</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAY SHARBUTT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Television Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   With the fall tube-watching season at hand, it's
perhaps fitting that on Wednesday ABC News' ``The Koppel Report''
special will devote a prime-time hour to what television hath
wrought.
   Some Americans will say TV hath wrought many awful shows, way too
many commercials, and way, way too many promotions for more awful
shows.
   But Ted Koppel's ``Television _ Revolution in a Box'' isn't about
that. Rather, it concerns the worldwide impact of new technology _
portable satellite dishes, videocassette recorders and camcorders _
on newsgathering, global politics and history itself.
   He calls it ``the democratization of television,'' a wide range
of viewing options not possible in the old-tech days when power over
what viewers were offered largely was restricted to government or a
few megabuck conglomerates.
   Ironically, that democratization has in a sense made possible
what once was the unthinkable in network news, at least where Koppel
is concerned.
   Had ABC News president Roone Arledge turned down Koppel's
proposal for what became Wednesday's ``Report,'' the ``Nightline''
anchorman says, the program still could have emerged elsewhere on
TV, although not on a rival network.
   And even with ABC airing it, Koppel still can eventually sell the
program domestically, even to cable companies, and overseas a year
after its ABC broadcast, he says.
   The reason: Koppel's ABC contract, signed last year, in which his
own company, Koppel Communications, Inc., produces ``The Koppel
Report'' specials ``in cooperation with ABC News,'' as the credits
say.
   The deal was made public when signed. But it still strikes some
as unusual, as if, say, a mild-mannered reporter for a great
metropolitan newspaper got a new contract in which the founder of
Clark Kent Communications, Inc., would henceforth produce features
for the Daily Planet.
   Koppel himself says he thinks his ABC deal is unprecedented.
Under its terms, he says, he makes ``Koppel Report'' proposals to
Arledge. If the ABC News' chief says no dice, Koppel is free to take
the idea elsewhere.
   But the freedom is restricted, unlike the network entertainment
side of things. There, in an unusual move, NBC recently asked
ABC-owned ABC Productions to create and produce for it a prime-time
drama series.
   ``I'm precluded by my contract from selling to NBC, CBS, CNN and
Fox,'' Koppel says, referring to both ``Koppel Reports'' that have
been or will be made, and ``Reports'' proposals that ABC News turns
down.
   With programs his company makes for ABC, he says, the network
owns the rights for a year and can air the shows twice during that
time. On the first anniversary of a given program's broadcast, both
its domestic and overseas rights revert to his company, he says.
   The company already has sold one ``Report'' overseas _ last
April's special on drug-related crime in urban ghettos that used the
nation's capital as its focus and was called ``D.C. _ Divided City.''
   Japan's NHK network bought that one, he says. He doesn't know
what accounted for NHK's purchase, but ``they were enormously
interested in it. They were the ones who came after it the most
anxiously.''
   Koppel, who has been with ABC News for 26 years, thinks it's very
likely that others in network news eventually will do as he's done,
form news production companies of their own:
   ``The fact of the matter is, there are now so many potential
customers out there for programs ... it's not that the audience is
getting any larger, but the number of customers (for programs) is
getting larger.''
   It harks back to what he'd been saying earlier, he says,
referring to the technological change in television that has widened
both viewing choices and program markets.
   Twenty years ago, he said, alluding to the three major TV
networks, ``you only had three customers. And if you wanted to sell
something else on television, where were you going to sell it?''

<HEAD>Remembering the Cultural Revolution _ and the Anger and Fear</HEAD>

<DATELINE>SAN FRANCISCO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   In 1966, as the horror of the Cultural
Revolution fell upon China, Cheng Naishan and Wang Anyi were young
schoolgirls, unaware how radically the events of the following
decade would change their lives.
   Today both are popular fiction writers in China, and each has
drawn upon personal experience in new books that focus on the reform
period that has followed the fall of the Gang of Four, who led the
far-leftist Cultural Revolution from 1966 to '76.
   Wang's book, ``Lapse of Time,'' and Cheng's, ``The Piano Tuner,''
each include a novella and a series of short stories. They were
published in English by China Books and each sells for $16.95.
   For Westerners, the books reveal in fascinating detail the rigors
of daily life in a society that only recently has begun to open
itself to outside scrutiny. Both women have the ability to express
the anger, humiliation and fear experienced by many during the
Cultural Revolution and the newfound optimism in the days since.
   Both authors have paid dearly for this expertise.
   ``Nineteen-sixty-six was the hardest time,'' recalls Cheng. ``My
family was raided and my grandmother died from a heart attack right
after the raid. The cruelest part was that they not only raided your
family's house, they also forced you to accuse your parents and your
family members to show your own attitude.''
   She said her husband's grandparents also faced ``this
humiliation.''
   ``The Red Guards forced them to eat human waste,'' she said.
``They couldn't take it and they committed suicide by turning on the
gas stove. After they died, nobody would even dare to take care of
their bodies because they were so afraid of getting involved and
getting persecuted.'' The bodies remained unmoved for three days.
   Cheng's own father, who had worked in Hong Kong for a German
company before 1949, was accused of being a spy.
   ``I was so afraid he would commit suicide, too, that I would wait
for my father every evening for him to come back,'' she said.
   ``The political movement after 1966 was so intense, it filled
every minute of your life. People didn't talk to each other about
other things.''
   Wang was so young when the Cultural Revolution began that she and
her classmates were at first naively pleased their classes had been
interrupted. She remembered going to her principal with her friends
to ask if they could be allowed to join the revolution.
   ``My mother warned me at that time not to be so active in the
Cultural Revolution because even though I was allowed to join, I
wouldn't be allowed to be a Red Guard because my father had been
denounced as a rightist,'' she said.
   Wang's father, a theater director, had been named a rightist in
the 1957 movement. Her mother had been a popular writer, and thus
had shared in many privileges denounced after 1966. Young Wang
suddenly realized her own parents might be targeted as
counter-revolutionaries.
   ``We raided our own house and threw out all the books we had,''
she said. ``We waited a long time, but the Red Guard never came.
Later on, my sister and I went to a village. My mother went to a
school to be re-educated. My very young brother stayed in Shanghai
with the cadre.''
   In the books, we find families who have to bid goodbye to sons
and daughters heading for far-off army posts, mothers who struggle
to put food on the family table, neighbors who try to get past class
conflicts of the past, and reflections of the romance that has
blossomed openly between the young since the Cultural Revolution
ended.
   This reforms of the past several years have allowed both writers
to travel, read the literature of other nations and rediscover
classical Chinese literature, which was unavailable during the
Cultural Revolution.
   For example, the authors say that ``The Unbearable Lightness of
Being'' is currently one of the most popular novels in China. Young
people enjoy reading J.D. Salinger, just as they do in the United
States, they said.
   Both women expect the reform movement to continue.
   ``If I compared what is going on in China with what happened
before the Cultural Revolution, it's two worlds,'' said Cheng. ``Of
course, there are some chaotic situations, but I don't think that
means the reform is bad.''
   Wang added: ``Although people complain about inflation, if you
said `OK, go back to what you had before 1966,' nobody would go
back.''

<HEAD>Canadians Protest Planned 9 Percent Sales Tax</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The federal government's plan for a 9-percent
sales tax is bringing more than the usual number of protests from
the Canadian grassroots. Some analysts say the tax could cause
tremendous upheaval in the economy.
   ``There has to be a better solution,'' said Gus Karagianis, who
has a placard outside his Fruit King produce stand inviting
passersby to sign a tax-revolt petition.
   He showed off about 3,200 signatures he said he had gathered in
three weeks.
   ``Being a storeowner I'm capable of voicing my opinion,'' he
said. ``Regardless of whether it does any good or not, just voice
your opinion.''
   Petitions, some of them sponsored by newspapers, telephone hot
lines, the inevitable slogan T-shirts and buttons and even a tax
protest song have sprung up since Finance Minister Michael Wilson
announced the details in August of the proposed goods and services
tax that would take effect in 1991.
   The tax would replace an existing, hidden 13.5-percent
manufacturers sales tax that the government says damages the
Canadian economy's ability to compete. The current tax, for example,
applies only to goods manufactured domestically and not to imports.
   Wilson said the new tax would be ``revenue neutral'' for the
government as compared to the current system but would raise the
consumer price index by 2.25 percent in 1991.
   The new tax would be felt by consumers for many goods and
services not now covered, from new houses to restaurant meals and
even postage stamps.
   Basic groceries, virtually all of the items sold in Karagianis'
store, would not be affected, but the 33-year-old shopkeeper said he
believes that any measure that cuts into consumers' spending power
ultimately hurts his business.
   ``You can only tighten the belt so much,'' he said.
   Basic groceries, prescription drugs, health and dental care,
educational services, day care and legal aid would be among the few
categories left untouched by the new tax.
   The Edmonton Sun newspaper in the Western province of Alberta
said it has gathered from readers more than 15,000 tax-protest
coupons addressed to Wilson. ``There are a number of individuals and
organizations who started petitions,'' Managing Editor Randy
McDonald said. ``It's been more of a grassroots thing.''
   Taxes traditionally have been higher in Canada than in the United
States.
   McDonald said tax freedom day, when citizens can stop thinking
that their money is going to the government, already is calculated
for Albertans as July 15 or 16. It was May 4 this year in the United
States.
   ``I think it's just a matter of enough's enough,'' McDonald said.
   The Toronto Sun, the Edmonton's Sun's sister newspaper in
Canada's largest city, said it has taken in 138,000 tax-protest
coupons so far.
   No central place has tabulated the number of Canadians signing
petitions or expressing opposition to the tax plan in other ways.
   But critics of the plan say they hope that evidence of
widespread, visible discontent will persuade the government to alter
or scrap the plan. They note that it won't take effect until 1991,
when the next national election will be on the horizon and unpopular
measures might be harder to take.
   Prime Minister Brian Mulroney's Progressive Conservative Party is
in the first year of its second consecutive majority term. Another
election will not have to be called for at least three years.
   ``We are bringing in the new goods and services tax not because
it is easy but because it is right,'' Mulroney told his party's
recent convention.
   Wood Gundy Inc., a prominent investments firm, said in its highly
publicized analysis of the tax plan that the inflationary impact
would lead to higher interest rates and add to the federal budget
deficit.
   It said the Bank of Canada probably would use tight money policy
to control price pressures and that unemployment would rise as a
result, possibly to 10 percent from its current level of 7.5 percent.
   Burns Fry Ltd. said the government should call the proposed tax
``deficit neutral'' rather than ``revenue neutral,'' as Wilson
characterized it.
   The new tax would take in $4.7 billion ($5.5 billion Canadian)
more than is currently received, but the funds would go out for
refundable tax credits for those with income less than $25,500
($30,000 Canadian), which would lower the middle-income tax rate
from 26 percent to 25 percent and pay for administrative costs.
   The Globe and Mail newspaper in Toronto said in an editorial:
``Both on the visibility and the impact of the tax, the federal
government's projections and hopes appear unrealistic and naive,
asking retailers, consumers and workers to let the system work by
being reasonable.''

<HEAD>When Should a Child Begin School?</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TAMARA HENRY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Education Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   To some parents, ``choice'' means deciding not
only which school their child will attend but also at what age to
start them.
   Take Tracy Hill.
   By the time daughter Jessica was ready to turn 6, Mrs. Hill had
twice tinkered with Jessica's birth date to meet enrollment cutoff
dates, and the entire family was confused about when to hold her
birthday party. Mrs. Hill knows she broke the law and asked that her
real name not be used.
   ``We celebrated Jessica's third and fourth birthdays on Sept.
8,'' Mrs. Hill said with a chuckle. Jessica's real birthday is Oct.
8.
   Her mother explained that she had wanted her daughter, when she
was 2{, to attend a private, bilingual preschool with her playmates.
But the program required that children be 3 years old by Sept. 15 to
be admitted.
   This year, Mrs. Hill faced another problem.
   She wanted to enroll Jessica in a neighborhood public school
kindergarten. But the District of Columbia school system says any
child who turns 6 by Dec. 31 must be placed in first grade the
preceeding September or be labeled as a slow learner.
   ``When I saw what the first-graders were doing, I didn't want to
see a girl who has always loved school be put in a negative
environment'' where she would be forced into reading, math and other
competitive academic work before she was ready, her mother said.
   So Mrs. Hill restored Jessica's real birth date and entered her
in the kindergarten of a private, $6,000-a-year school.
   ``Schools are more concerned about statistics,'' exclaimed Willa
Hennigan, another frustrated mother who tried to enroll her son in a
public pre-kindergarten program in the District when he was 5 but
was told he must enter kindergarten or the school's computer would
``list him as an at-risk child.''
   ``I think each parent ought to determine what's best for her
child,'' said Mrs. Hennigan, who teaches a fifth-grade class for
gifted and talented students in suburban Virginia.
   At least where public schools are concerned, the age at which a
child begins his education is becoming as controversial as
``parental choice'' _ a centerpiece of President Bush's education
initiatives that would let parents decide which public school their
child would attend.
   Some educators are convinced that youngsters will be more
successful in school if they are 5 starting kindergarten. Others
scoff at the notion of arbitrary age limits and favor flexible
curricula for various maturity levels.
   ``We agree there is a problem in that young children are not
succeeding in kindergarten and first grade as they should, but the
problem is with the curriculum and the strategy in the way children
are asked to learn what is inappropriate with their age group,''
said Barbara Willer of the National Association for the Education of
Young Children.
   Susan Dranitzke, an educational consultant who advises parents on
their children's school readiness, said, ``Kindergarten is more like
first grade used to be. At this point, the way public kindergartens
are, it's probably better to have them older.''
   To be eligible for public school kindergartens, 23 states now
require children to be 5 years old by Sept. 2. Ten years ago, most
states allowed youngsters to begin kindergarten if their fifth
birthday would fall as late as November, December or January.
   Complicating the situation for parents in five states are laws
requiring that their children attend kindergarten. Those states are
Arkansas, Delaware, Rhode Island, South Carolina and West Virginia.
   The District of Columbia, and the adjacent Maryland counties of
Prince Georges and Montgomery, have held to the Dec. 31 kindergarten
eligibility date. In Virginia, the cutoff has been moved to Sept.
30, but children with later birthdays can be tested to determine if
they are emotionally, physically and intellectually ready for
kindergarten.
   David Elkind, professor of child study at Tufts University in
Medford, Mass., and the author of ``The Hurried Child,'' said
raising the entry age of children is merely ``a policy solution to a
people problem and policy solutions to people problems never work.
The need is for flexible programs in kindergarten and first grades.''
   ``Raising the age is not going to do anything, except raise the
curriculum,'' he explained. ``We need to recognize what children are
like at that stage and then match the curriculum to the child.''
   Indiana's new school entry age law kicks in this year with a
September cutoff date that moves up to June 1 by the 1992-93 school
year.
   ``We are not letting our kids grow up. We are pushing them and I
don't know why,'' said Rep. Esther Wilson, a third-grade teacher and
state legislator who wrote and pushed through Indiana's law after
nearly six years of work.
   ``With this bill, I predict the dropout rate is going to be down
because the majority of our boys and girls will be socially and
emotionally ready for school,'' said Wilson.
   Tom Schultz, project director for early childhood education at
the National Associaton of State Boards of Education, said raising
the entry age results in ``a problem of equity in terms of what the
experiences will be during that extra year out of school.''
   By merely raising the entry age, Schultz said, ``A group of kids
who would have gone to kindergarten will sit in a preschool, at home
or at day care another year. Parents vary in their aility to pay for
and provide stimulus.
   ``We need to help teachers find ways to deal with student
diversity,'' he said.
   One solution, Schultz said, would be to allow children to enter
school the month they become 5. The problem with that, he added, is
that ``it would be difficult for teachers to adjust to new kids
continually arriving.''
   Another idea is ``cooperative learning,'' which places a child in
a group of youngsters with abilities similar to his own. Assignments
are given to the groups so that youngsters can teach each other as
they work together.
   Susan Sweitzer of the Gesell Institute, a private educational
organization in New Haven, Conn., said 15-18 percent of more than
16,000 school districts around the nation use Gesell's procedures to
assess young children's readiness to learn.
   When these procedures are properly used, she said, school systems
can determine which approach is suited to the needs of a particular
child, either the traditional ``lock-step'' grade system or
alternative programs that insert a transitional year for children to
mature before or after first grade.
   ``I used to feel pretty strongly that the cutoff date should be
Sept. 1 or Aug. 31 but I have really grown to an opinion of
encouraging districts to create options from which parents can
choose, so it doesn't really matter when the cutoff date is,'' Ms.
Sweitzer said.
   Regardless of when a child is enrolled in kindergarten, all
states require that, by a certain age, children must be in first
grade. In no state, however, is that ``required'' date set so early
that parents do not have the freedom to delay their youngster's
entry into kindergarten, said Ms. Weller of the National Association
for the Education of Young Children.

<DATELINE>CAPIRE, Honduras (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   For Hondurans in this isolated valley
where a Nicaraguan Contra army has been camped, the last
year-and-a-half has meant prosperity.
   ``Business is good. We'll sell it all,'' Krystela Rodriguez
exulted. She runs a shop crammed with everything from cologne and
shampoo to powdered fruit drinks and baby shoes.
   Perhaps most remarkable for her 10- by 20-foot shack 80 miles
from the nearest paved road is the refrigerator, which runs on
electricity from a diesel generator that also provides power for a
nearby Contra encampment.
   A cloud is on her horizon, however: the accord reached by Central
American leaders Aug. 7 calling for the Contra army to disband by
Dec. 8. She still has a lot of shampoo to sell and is concerned
about being overstocked.
   ``There's no future here after the Contras leave,'' said Vladimir
Valenzuela, who runs a bustling restaurant in Danli, 80 miles to the
west.
   Eastern Honduras has always been poor and sparsely populated. The
average agricultural worker earned 3 lempiras a day _ less than $1
at the black market exchange rate. Farms were few. Small ranchers
had no way to get their products to market.
   The Yamales area, which has no more than a few hundred residents
in normal times, was almost completely abandoned in the mid-1980s,
at the height of the Contra campaign to topple the Sandinista
government in Nicaragua.
   The Nicaraguan border is less than 10 miles away, and the
Sandinista army swept through more than once in search of Contras.
   But when thousands of Contra fighters began moving out of
Nicaragua after the United States cut off military aid early in
1988, the impact was immediate on Yamales.
   The United States has kept up non-lethal aid, Contra fighters and
their families began to find work, and there was a market for
practically everything.
   The people of eastern Honduras went to work.
   Las Trojes, 18 miles to the west, and Danli, 60 miles away,
became boomtowns where many fighters' relatives settled. Cheap
hotels and restaurants served truck drivers, and Las Trojes even had
a small casino with rudimentary versions of craps and roulette.
   ``A lot of them are doing real well. They've got a road now,''
noted Israel Galeano, the Contra chief of staff known as ``Commander
Franklin.''
   The Contras built and maintain the road in from Las Trojes. Now
more roads branch off that one. Many ranchers in the area are
building wood corrals to replace old barbed wire ones.
   ``The corral started getting too full and the animals starting
cutting themselves on the wire,'' said Mercedes Martinez. She and
her husband, Mario, have cattle and chickens and sell milk, meat and
eggs to the Contras.
   Nicaraguans have established small businesses and farms of their
own as well, especially in the roadless mountains that stretch 100
miles northeast along the Nicaragua-Honduras border to Bocay. Jungle
has been cleared for cattle or corn crops.
   Paula Zentena, whose husband is a Contra soldier, found she could
make money by altering U.S.-provided fatigue uniforms for the Contra
soldiers.
   ``They're usually too baggy for the boys,'' she said as she ran
off a seam on her new, treadle-powered sewing machine. She rents
space in a Honduran house and has two Nicaraguan fighters working
for her, charging 3 lempiras to alter a pair of pants.
   Balancio Blandon, a Honduran who started out with a small shop,
has been able to build a new, brick store and home for himself, his
wife and their five children. He also bought a Canon camera and now
runs a photo service.
   He doesn't see the boom coming to an end soon, especially with
U.S. aid continuing until February _ and probably longer for Contra
families and wounded fighters in the area.

<HEAD>Mutual Funds Closing In on $1 Trillion Mark</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CHET CURRIER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   If things keep going the way they have been
lately, the nation's mutual funds will soon become a $1 trillion
industry.
   The latest data from the Investment Company Institute, the funds'
biggest trade group, show total assets of $936.60 billion at the end
of July, up from $900.25 billion a month earlier and $805.52 billion
in July 1988.
   That left the industry nearly 10 times as large as it was just a
decade ago, with assets of $94.2 billion as of the end of 1979.
   Numbers like those stand as ample testimony to why investment
experts have called the 1980s ``the decade of financial assets.''
   Dramatic bull markets in both stocks and bonds made a big
contribution to the funds' growth. In July alone, for instance,
rising stock prices swelled industry assets by about $14 billion.
   The financial boom also fueled a dramatic expansion in the number
and types of funds available to investors.
   At the beginning of the '80s the institute counted 524 funds with
slightly fewer than 10 million shareholder accounts. By the end of
1988, there were 2,718 funds with close to 55 million accounts.
   All this naturally poses some questions: How long can this kind
of growth continue, and where is it leading the nation's investors?
   The funds had a hot streak once before, though of lesser
proportions, during the great bull market for stocks in the 1960s.
It gave way to a period of contraction and disillusionment in the
early 1970s when the hot ``go-go'' funds of that era turned cold.
   In those days, however, mutual funds were considered almost
exclusively a vehicle for investing in stocks. Notably, there were
no money market mutual funds at all until the Reserve Fund made its
debut in 1972.
   Today, stock funds, with assets of about $237 billion, remain a
significant part of the industry. But money market and short-term
municipal bond funds, at about $400 billion, and bond and income
funds, at about $300 billion, both outrank them in size.
   That goes a long way toward explaining why the stock market crash
of 1987 inflicted only minor damage on the industry. A lot of money
that might have simply fled the business 20 years before was instead
switched into other types of funds.
   Still, even with its new diversity, many observers agree the
industry's growth would likely slow or stop should the nation run
into a spell of economic trouble on the order of the one that
occurred in the 1970s.
   Stock funds, as ever, would be vulnerable to a bear market. Many
bond funds, especially those that invest in so-called ``junk''
bonds, could fall into disfavor in a slump that caused increased
defaults by businesses.
   The many income funds that specialize in government securities,
where the risk of default is considered very slight, could also lose
a lot of their appeal if bond prices were depressed by a flareup of
inflation and higher interest rates.
   But most analysts agree that the 1980s mutual fund boom has gone
much too far for too long to be regarded as only some temporary
growth spurt.
   Millions of American investors evidently have concluded over the
last 10 years that they want or need professional help in managing
their finances. And as demand for that kind of service increased,
mutual fund managers were right there waiting, only too happy to
meet it.

<HEAD>Emmy Salutes TV's 50th Years With Look At Present and Past</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: Emmy broadcast is Sept. 17</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JERRY BUCK</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Television Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>PASADENA, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   One year after they celebrated their 40th
birthday, the Emmy awards salute television's 50th anniversary
Sunday with an affectionate look at the past and honors for
present-day excellence.
   From Ralph Kramden to Heathcliff Huxtable, from Ed Sullivan to
Arsenio Hall, from ``The Growing Paynes'' to ``Growing Pains,'' the
41st Annual Emmy Awards will span the years.
   The Prime-Time Emmy show, to be televised live Sunday, Sept. 17
(8-11 p.m. EDT), from the Pasadena Civic Auditorium by Fox
Broadcasting Co., will also be notable for what it doesn't contain.
For the first time, no clips will be shown from nominated shows. And
it will have no production numbers _ no song medleys, no
high-kicking chorus line.
   The CBS miniseries ``Lonesome Dove'' leads the nominations with
18. Other multiple nominations went to NBC's ``L.A. Law'' with 17,
the ABC miniseries ``War and Remembrance'' with 15, ABC's ``The
Wonder Years'' with 14, ABC's ``thirtysomething'' with 13, and NBC's
``The Golden Girls'' and Fox's ``The Tracey Ullman Show'' with 10
each.
   ``We're going to reach back and present some of the wonderful
images, memories, faces, pictures and words that we've forgotten or
that we remember well and want to see again,'' said John Moffitt,
co-executive producer with Pat Tourk Lee for the Academy of
Television Arts &amp; Sciences.
   ``Everyone seems to like the clips of the old shows. And everyone
complains about the production numbers. We'll be able to take a long
look at the past and still keep it to about three hours by
eliminating the numbers and the clips of the nominated shows.
Nobody'll miss those clips and it will speed up the show.''
   Lucille Ball, who died in April at age 77, will be posthumously
honored with the Governors Award. She will be remembered with a
five-to-seven-minute retrospective, including a clip from the pilot
of ``I Love Lucy.'' Bob Hope, her frequent co-star, will present the
award to her husband, Gary Morton.
   ``She was doing films when other people were doing live TV, so
there's an enormous record of her work,'' said Moffitt. ``We have
some shows that are fresh because they never went into syndication.
We want to run the clips pretty full so that we don't lose her
wonderful sense of timing.
   ``Her face was her greatest asset, but she could be outrageously
funny even when you couldn't see her face. There's one scene with
Richard Burton and Elizabeth Taylor in which you see only her arm
and it's very funny. We want to show her at her best when she's
entertaining people. It won't be maudlin or sentimental.''
   Instead of a production number, the Emmy show will open with a
comedy spot showing what the world would be like without television.
   ``We'll have a few surprises, too,'' said Moffitt, who with Lee
also produces ``Not Necessarily the News'' for Home Box Office.
   ``This is the year of the dramatization. It caused a controversy
on ABC News. We'll have our own dramatization of what could happen
if a winner isn't there to accept his award.''
   The clips will feature some fascinating duos: Ethel Merman and
Mary Martin, Frank Sinatra and Elvis Presley, Candice Bergen and
Groucho Marx, Judy Garland and Barbra Streisand, David Bowie and
Bing Crosby, and Flip Wilson and Ed Sullivan.
   There'll also be some unlikely couples on the stage. For
instance, Robert Reid and Florence Henderson of ``The Brady Bunch''
will get together with Ed O'Neill and Katey Sagal of ``Married ...
With Children'' to talk about changing attitudes in comedy.
   Robert Duvall of ``Lonesome Dove'' is a presenter; he is also
nominated as best lead actor in a miniseries or special, along with
co-star Tommy Lee Jones.
   Other presenters include Arsenio Hall, the hot new late-night
talk show host, teen-age heart throb Johnny Depp of Fox's ``21 Jump
Street'' and Fred Savage of ABC's ``The Wonder Years,'' at 12 the
youngest person ever nominated in a lead actor category.
   Announcers from the past will be represented by Andre Baruch of
``Your Hit Parade.'' He will be in an ``announcer competition'' with
Shadoe Stevens, host of a current program of top music favorites.

<TEXT>
   Last June, the principal of Richmond
Consolidated School could see only one way to solve his school's
desperate money woes _ quit.
   Norman Najimy made national headlines with his self-sacrificing
solution to save teachers' jobs and precious programs for 185
children attending kindergarten through eighth-grade. And the school
committee accepted his resignation.
   Shocked townspeople rallied around Najimy, and by August this
hamlet had saved his job.
   But as a new year began last week at Richmond Consolidated, a
school cited repeatedly for excellence by the state and surrounded
by yellow wildflowers and Berkshire hills, everyone here knew that
neither Najimy nor the school were out of the financial woods.
   In all probability, the summer's crisis was just a taste of worse
to come.
   Tighter state purse strings, here in Massachusetts and in other
states, mean school districts must increasingly battle budget woes
with less hope of outside bailouts.
   And Massachusetts, in common with a dozen other states, now must
live with tax revolt measures passed a decade ago that are now
coming home to roost, making local school tax increases hard or even
impossible.
   As the new school year began, Richmond Consolidated's budget
crisis has already meant a kindergarten class almost double the size
of last year, with a teacher paid just half what she earned last
year; less early remedial help for kids with reading problems;
scuttled plans for expanded foreign language instruction, less music
and art.
   Because of the district's deficit _ still about $30,000 as of
last week _ kindergarten teacher Carole Collins says she plans to
meet with parents ``to ask them for paper, soap, tissues, Band-Aids,
crayons. And I'll have to tell them that without help, there'll be
no field trips, and there'll be fewer activities and crafts.''
   Teacher Bill Kerwood set any doubters straight on opening day:
   ``Copy this class schedule off the board,'' he told his 40 or so
seventh- and eighth-graders. ``I would have run them off on the
copying machine, but I can't this year because of ...''
   ``The budget cuts,'' said the students, completing Kerwood's
sentence.
   ``Break periods are longer this year,'' he continued, ``because
of ...''
   ``Budget cuts!''
   ``There'll be more study periods because of ...''
   ``Budget cuts!''
   The school's predicament and Najimy's magnanimity stunned this
upscale town of 1,600 people in one of the artsy corners of the
nation.
   In July, shortly after the Richmond school committee reluctantly
accepted Najimy's resignation, angry parents flocked to the general
store where owner Elizabeth ``Sunny'' Lloyd-Eriksen circulated
petitions demanding his reinstatement.
   The town's selectmen met parents on a hot, buggy August evening
in the parking lot outside Town Hall. The selectmen suddenly
announced they had found money in the town budget to save the job of
Najimy _ a principal so respected and beloved that he got a hug from
every single boy and girl as they entered school opening day.
   A happy ending? Hardly.
   ``How is morale here?'' said Mary Hanson, an instructional aide
to handicapped youngsters at the school. ``On a scale of 1 to 10,
I'd say it was a 1. I think things here are going to get a lot worse
before they get better.''
   With the national economy showing signs of cooling, Massachusetts
is tackling a deficit estimated at $170 million. The state cut aid
to Richmond by $75,000, not inconsiderable for a district whose
budget is just $1.2 million.
   When school opened last Wednesday, Najimy and his 19-member
teaching staff sported buttons on their shirts summing up their mood:
   ``Wouldn't it be great,'' the buttons read, ``if schools had all
the money they needed, and the Air Force had to hold a bake sale to
buy a new bomber?''
   Sitting in his spartan, cinderblock office, Najimy said everyone
knew money trouble was brewing last spring when the district's Blue
Cross premiums shot up by 33 percent, the furnace needed repairs and
the water system had to be replaced.
   Richmond high schoolers must attend classes in Pittsfield about
10 miles away because Richmond has no high school. Pittsfield, with
financial woes of its own, raised the tuitions it charges the
Richmond district by 10 percent.
   Making matters worse was Proposition 2{, a measure passed by
irate voters in 1981 back when some derisively called the state
``Taxachusetts.'' Proposition 2{, akin to other tax revolt measures
passed in other states, limited to 2{ percent the amount that
property taxes could go up in a single year unless town voters
agreed to higher rates.
   Richmond voters, many of them affluent professionals keen on
education, approved two such tax ``overrides'' in the last two
years. School committee chairwoman Janice Hartford says another may
be proposed this year if no other money is found.
   The bottom line at the height of the crisis this summer for
Richmond Consolidated was a $140,000 deficit and few options to
close it besides cutting staff and educational programs.
   The school's instrumental music program was eliminated. For now,
a 71-year-old retired musician named Walt Lehmann has volunteered to
teach kids without pay.
   The basic skills teacher was eliminated _ meaning no early
intervention for youngsters with reading or other academic problems.
   Najimy had hoped to extend foreign language to the early grades.
But those plans are ``on permanent hold.''
   Najimy eliminated his personal expense budget and passed up a
$3,000 raise this year, leaving his salary unchanged at $40,000.
   Those and other cuts reduced the deficit to $30,000. The gap has
to be closed this month, or new cuts will have to be made.
   So Richmond Consolidated is barely scraping by this fall _ with
the help of parents, teachers and volunteers.
   Townspeople have offered money for computer equipment. One parent
rototilled ground around the school for landscaping.
   Doesn't that make the school a shining example of the virtues of
volunteerism, what President Bush has often referred to as ``a
thousand points of light?''
   Richmond superintendent George St. Pierre chuckled at the
question.
   ``Volunteerism is great _ for about a month,'' he said. ``It just
doesn't continue. Ask Bush how many of his workers are volunteers.''

a report that analysts said shows no sign that industry fears an
imminent recession.
   The Commerce Department reported Thursday that responses to a
survey completed last month show that businesses expect to spend
$463.95 billion on expansion and modernization this year despite
earlier concern about a significant economic slowdown.

   White House economic adviser Michael J. Boskin
is reinforcing the Bush administration's call on the Federal Reserve
Board to lower interest rates.
   Boskin, chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers, told the
U.S. Chamber of Commerce on Thursday that ``if there are signs of
softness in the economy from where we are now, that further easing
would probably be appropriate,''
   His comments came three weeks after White House budget director
Richard Darman complained that the central bank was keeping interest
rates too high and would have to bear the blame if the country
toppled into a recession.

   The federal Superfund program has
been ``superslow'' in cleaning toxic waste dumps and in making
polluters pay for the work, according to a study.
   In the program's first eight years ending last September, the
Environmental Protection Agency finished cleaning only 34 dumps out
of 1,175 on a priority list, according to the Rand Corp. study, to
be released Friday. The list represents only the worst of 30,000
dumps where waste ultimately may need to be treated or removed.

   The Texas Attorney General's office has sued
the Quaker Oats Co. saying the nation's biggest seller of hot cereal
misled consumers in advertising that its product can help reduce the
risk of heart disease.
   But spokesmen for Chicago-based Quaker Oats said they feel the
advertising is truthful and is supported by valid scientific
evidence.
   In the lawsuit, filed Thursday on behalf of the Texas Department
of Health in a Dallas state district court, the state said Quaker
Oats' ads as ``replete with exaggerations, half-truths, and

   The dollar rose against foreign currencies despite central bank

investments overseas in the first half of 1989, the Conference Board
said.
   American companies announced 99 new manufacturing projects in the
first six months of the year, up from 90 in the first half of last
year, the business-supported research group said Thursday.
   Of the total, 53 were acquisitions of foreign-owned companies, 33
were joint ventures, eight involved building new plants abroad and
five represented major expansions of overseas locations, the
Conference Board said.
   Western Europe was the leading region, accounting for 57 of the
99 new projects, followed by 20 in the Pacific region, 14 in Canada
and five in Latin America. Britain was the leading nation with 18.
   ``The age of retrenchment in American manufacturing appears to be
over,'' James Green, an international investment specialist for the
Conference Board, said in a statement.
   Dollar figures were reported for only 23 of the 99 new
investments. Those totaled $6.1 billion.

   Merger mania may drive stock prices through the
roof, but merger phobia is driving corporate executives batty.
   The No. 1 worry among America's bosses is that they will lose
their jobs through mergers or acquisitions, a study released
Thursday from a research organization shows.
   The fear of takeovers far exceeded worries about being fired,
losing a promotion, getting sick or not making enough money,
according to the study from Robert Half International Inc.
   Robert Half is the world's largest recruiting agency for
financial, accounting, information systems and banking. The survey
was based on interviews with vice presidents and personnel directors
of 100 of the nation's 1,000 largest corporations.
   Respondents were asked to note their greatest fears from a list
of typical executive suite nightmares. Fifty-four percent cited the
loss of their jobs due to takeovers; 26 percent said burnout; and 8
percent worried most about losing promotions.
   Other concerns included being fired, 6 percent; failing to get a
raise, 5 percent; insufficient income to meet living standards or
financial obligations, 3 percent; and illness, 2 percent.
   ``Corporate restructuring resulting from mergers and acquisitions
is almost invariably accompanied by personnel changes at the
executive level,'' said Max Messmer, chairman of Robert Half. ``But
the survey also illustrates just how deeply troubling the mere
thought of a merger can be.''

<HEAD>Is Warranty War Heating Up?</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By FREDERICK STANDISH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Auto Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>DETROIT (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Another battle in the automotive warranty war may
be on the horizon after a nearly three-year cease-fire and the front
may be on America's highways instead of at dealership service
departments.
   In early 1987, the nation's Big Three automakers extended
existing warranties and used the new guarantees as bait to snare
new-car buyers.
   On Thursday, Oldsmobile took a page from the European luxury car
makers' warranty book and introduced a new three-part program for
1990 Oldsmobile buyers. Two days earlier, Toyota Motor Corp. boosted
its warranty on powertrain and safety equipment to five years or
60,000 miles from three years or 36,000 miles.
   Oldsmobile's new program offers buyers a three-year,
bumper-to-bumper warranty with a $100 deductible after the first
year, a chance for new buyers to return their cars within a month
for full credit for another new Oldsmobile and a roadside assistance
plan.
   During the first three years or 50,000 miles, whichever comes
first, Oldsmobile owners will be able to telephone for help anytime
their car is disabled for any reason, from an empty gas tank to a
major mechanical failure, said Oldsmobile General Manager Mike Losh.
   Because of Oldsmobile's sales volume, the move may prompt other
General Motors Corp. divisions as well as Ford Motor Co. and
Chrysler Corp. to rethink their warranties.
   ``What you're going to see is a big ramp-up in the overall
warranty coverage on the part of everybody,'' said analyst Joseph
Phillippi of Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. in New York.
   Improving warranties can be costly for automakers, who shoulder
most of the cost through dealer reimbursements. Automakers keep
their warranty costs close to their chests, since, among other
things, that would give competitors a peek at their cars'
reliability.
   The Oldsmobile warranty announced Thursday is unique in GM. Other
GM divisions offer the basic three-year, 50,000-mile warranty with
the exception of the Cadillac Allante, which carries a seven-year,
70,000-mile warranty.
   Changes in the 1990 version of the Cadillac warranty will be
announced next week when the division formally introduces its cars
for the coming model year, spokesman Norb Bartos said Thursday,
declining to elaborate.
   Ford, which introduces its 1990 model cars next week, and
Chrysler, which shows off its 1990 cars a week after that, have
basic warranties of 12 months or 12,000 miles in addition to longer
powertrain and rust protection coverage. Chrysler offers more
extensive basic coverage for its larger, more expensive cars.
   Officials of both companies said there were no immediate plans to
change warranties.
   Mercedes-Benz is offering a four-year, 50,000-mile warranty with
a free towing provision for its 1989 and 1990 cars. But the number
of vehicles covered by that plan, as well as those offered by other
makers of imported luxury cars, doesn't approach that of Oldsmobile.
   The Oldsmobile warranty, announced as the GM division introduced
its 1990 model cars, may be transferred if the original buyer sells
the car while it's covered by the basic warranty.
   The warranty stems from pilot programs GM ran on the Oldsmobile
Cutlass Supreme and the Pontiac Grand Prix last year, said Losh, who
was general manager of the Pontiac Division before moving to
Oldsmobile earlier this year.
   He said fewer than 0.5 percent of the Cutlass Supreme buyers
taking part in the pilot program returned their cars for other
Oldsmobiles. The program also offers free overnight accommodations
for drivers whose cars need that much time to be fixed if the driver
is more than 150 miles from home.

<HEAD>Ex-Shearson Exec To Plead Guilty in Stock-Loan Investigation</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By STEFAN FATSIS</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A government investigation of corruption in the
stock-loan industry, spun off from the Ivan Boesky insider trading
scandal, involves several Wall Street brokerages, according to a
source close to the case.
   A former top Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. executive, Dennis T.
Palmeri, has reached a deal with prosecutors to plead guilty to
criminal charges and cooperate in the probe, which began more than a
year ago, the source said Thursday, speaking anonymously.
   The case is said to be derived from information from Boesky, the
jailed speculator who has been a major source of evidence for Wall
Street securities investigations since he was ensnared in an insider
trading probe in 1986.
   Stock loaning is the business of lending large blocks of stock
for a fee, usually to big investors who need stock quickly and are
unable or unwilling to purchase enough shares.
   A person familiar with the stock-loan case said Palmeri,
Shearson's former executive vice president in charge of stock loans,
would enter a guilty plea to criminal counts by the end of October
in a deal with the Manhattan U.S. attorney's office.
   The source, speaking on condition of anonymity, declined to offer
other details about the charges. But the investigation was said to
include alleged kickbacks received by Palmeri while he headed the
stock-loan operation.
   It also involves stock-loan corruption at other major brokerages,
the source said. But no other brokerage executives or other
officials have reached plea deals with the government or have been
identified in the investigation.
   A federal grand jury last year issued subpoenas to Shearson
seeking information about Palmeri's trading activities. Shearson
said at the time that it did not believe the firm or any employees
were targets of an investigation.
   Asked for comment about the expected Palmeri guilty plea, a
Shearson official said the firm still does not believe it is a
target.
   ``The U.S. attorney's office has requested information from
Shearson Lehman Hutton relating to a former employee of our
stock-loan department and we have been cooperating fully with the
request,'' Shearson said in a statement.
   Palmeri's attorney, Stanley Arkin, declined to comment on the
case. A spokeswoman for the U.S. attorney's office, Deborah Corley,
also declined to comment.
   Palmeri began working at Shearson in 1979. He resigned June 28
after taking a leave of absence from the firm in April because of
the investigation, a Shearson spokesman said.
   He had supervised a department that specializes in lending blocks
of stock mostly to large institutional investors and speculators.
Boesky had borrowed stock from Shearson.
   Major brokerages such as Shearson, 62 percent-owned by American
Express Co., maintain large inventories of stocks typically loaned
to clients. Stock loans frequently are used in ``short-selling,'' a
strategy used to profit from an expected price decline in a stock.
   A speculator will sell borrowed stock at a high price, wait for
the price to fall, repurchase the shares at the lower price and
return them to the lender, pocketing the price difference as a
profit.
   The tactic is risky because the price might not fall and the
borrower must return the stock within a limited time.
   Violations alleged by the government in other stock-loan cases in
recent years include improper payments in return for interest-free
stock loans, unauthorized stock lending and fake transactions.
   Shearson was censured by the Securities and Exchange Commission
in 1987 for alleged unlawful use of customers' stock for loans
during one week in November 1985, including $69 million of
securities illegally loaned in one day. Shearson said the violations
were technical and agreed to internal procedural changes.

<HEAD>Magazine Singles Out Men From the Heartland</HEAD>

<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   They're called rugged individualists, not subject
to the trends of the East or West coasts. And for about a dime a
guy, women can find these heartland hunks in the new Midwest Men
magazine.
   David Osstyn, a blue-eyed, 6-foot-3, 28-year-old clinical
technician from the Detroit area, is the cover man for the first
issue of Midwest Men, a quarterly based in suburban Downer's Grove,
which offers women a chance to meet the men of their dreams.
   Richard Needham, one of Midwest Men's three publishers, said the
magazine features 60 single men from eight states. He said they're
more sincere and less materialistic than their coastal counterparts.
   ``Midwest men are not as apt to be as far-out, let's say, as
people from the West Coast, or as fast-paced as people from the East
Coast,'' Needham said in a telephone interview recently.
   Osstyn agreed.
   ``I've been out West ... It's all me, me, me and nobody else. The
people from the East are the same way,'' he said.
   ``I'm just as happy sitting at home watching a movie as I am
going out dancing all night,'' said the dark-haired Osstyn, who is
described in the magazine's centerfold report as quiet, shy,
headstrong and creative.
   He said he has received more than 200 letters since the magazine
hit the newsstands nationwide in July, and so many phone calls that
he got an unlisted number.
   Initial reports indicate the $100,000 venture is going well, said
Charles Bowgren, another publisher. And women don't seem to be
deterred by the magazine's $5.95 cover price.
   Midwest Men features a few pages devoted to things like recipes
and a brief article or two.
   But the big attraction is the men, page after page of them,
looking for Ms. Right. There are photographs of the subjects, short
descriptions and their addresses for those who want to learn more.
   There's also a centerfold _ fully-clothed _ of a tanned Osstyn
showing off his biceps in a red and black cyclist outfit in the
first issue.
   Then there's Richard G. of Palatine, Ill., a Libra who's made
more than 600 free-fall parachute jumps; James D., a ``blond-haired,
blue-eyed hunk'' of German descent from King, Wis.; and Bill T. of
Brighton, Mich., who likes fast cars and golfing.
   ``I don't know if there are a lot of desperate women out there or
what,'' said Michael Catlin, manager of a Walgreens store in the
heart of neighborhood populated largely by singles. ``But for
nothing else than the novelty's sake, it's selling.''
   The idea of promoting men through a magazine is not new. Alaska
Men is already a smash throughout the country, and has generated
three weddings and numerous engagements, said Susie Carter, its
publisher.
   Ms. Carter, a former homemaker from Anchorage, sold concept
rights to the three Chicago-area publishers. She says the magazines
help women by eliminating much of the awkward singles scene.
   She also offers tips on how to respond to Midwest men in the
magazine's first issue.
   ``If you use perfume, use a very light touch on the letter,'' and
use nice stationery, Ms. Carter writes.
   Don't lie about your looks or move too fast for the guy.
   ``Keep writing, even if you don't get a reply; there are always
more men coming up.''

   The Philadelphia-based accounting firm Laventhol
&amp; Horwath is in preliminary merger talks with a medium-sized
competitor, according to a confidential memo.
   The disclosure, first reported in an accounting trade journal and
repeated in Friday's New York Times, comes a month after Laventhol
began a national advertising campaign that stresses it has not
joined the merger fever of its larger competitors.
   Recently, several Big Eight accounting firms have disclosed plans
to merge.
   Laventhol, a second-tier firm, is in talks over a possible merger
with Spicer &amp; Oppenheim of New York, according to the memo,
disclosed in a special Sept. 7 issue of the International Accounting
Bulletin.
   ``If a merger is consummated, it will have a very positive effect
on our domestic and international market positions,'' George L.
Bernstein, Laventhol's executive partner, said in the memo,
according to the Times.
   A Laventhol-Spicer combination would have $928 million in
worldwide annual revenue.
   Spicer has been known to have been seeking a merger partner due
to financial troubles, the Times said.

<HEAD>Code to Grade Corporate Environmental Conduct</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A coalition of environmentalists, religious
groups and investors has established a code of conduct by which
corporations can be judged on how responsible they are toward the
environment.
   Building on guidelines set 12 years ago to judge corporate
actions in South Africa, the 10-point Valdez Principles annunced
Thursday call on companies to address the effects of both their
product and production processes on employees, communities and the
environment.
   The code of conduct, named after the Alaskan oil spill by the
Exxon Valdez tanker, also asks companies to appoint environmental
experts to their boards of directors and publicize an annual audit
of compliance with the code.
   ``As I talked to people this winter about this idea, it was like
striking a match to flint,'' said Joan Bavaria, a co-chairwoman of
the coalition and the president of Franklin Research and
Development, a Boston research firm.
   Bavaria told The New York Times that funds that base their
investments on social values consistently find the environment to be
the single largest concern of their clients.
   In the long term, the coalition believes the most profitable
companies are those that are willing to forego short-term profits
and invest according to environmental and social concerns.
   The Coalition for Environmentally Responsible Economies recently
brought pressure against Exxon Corp. to name a director with
environmental knowledge to its board.
   The coalition is a step to bring investors who control about $100
billion in pension funds and other vehicles together with social
action groups that have large memberships but often lack leverage
with corporations.
   It includes the Social Investment Forum of 325 fund managers and
investment advisers, the National Council of Churches' Interfaith
Center on Corporate Responsibility and 14 environmental groups.
   The environmental code was inspired in part by the Sullivan
Principles, formed in 1977 to recommended corporate conduct for
firms operating in racially segregated South Africa.

<HEAD>Economics Ministry Endorses Daimler Benz Merger With Big Arms Conglomerate</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BONN, West Germany (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The economics ministry today endorsed
the proposed $859 million merger of automaking giant Daimler-Benz
with a major arms conglomerate, overriding monopoly concerns with
claims that it would reduce taxes and improve U.S. trade ties.
   Economics Minister Helmut Haussmann had long indicated he would
conditionally approve Daimler's 1.7-billion-mark bid to take over
aerospace and armaments giant Messerschmitt-Boelkow-Blohm.
   At a news conference today, Haussmann said he chose to override a
Federal Cartel Office ruling that the takeover could give unfair
competitive advantages to the combined corporations because of the
``considerable economic advantages'' of the takeover.
   Opponents of the merger had claimed it would create the largest
defense contractor in the nation, making it hard for smaller West
German firms to compete for federal contracts.
   Daimler, already the largest industrial firm in West Germany,
still must approve the conditions outlined by Haussmann.
   The Stuttgart-based automaker issued a statement saying the
Economics Ministry conditions would be reviewed carefully by company
president Edzard Reuter, who would disclose his decision at a press
conference on Monday.
   The merger would create the third largest industrial concern in
Europe with sales of 80 billion marks, or $40 billion, annually.
   Among the economic advantages of the merger, Haussmann said, was
that Daimler would eventually be assuming the government's 37
percent share of the European Airbus Industrie consortium, which
currently needs large subsidies from the Bonn treasury to compete
with other major aerospace manufacturers like Boeing and McDonnell
Douglas.
   One of the stipulations attached to the takeover plan by
Haussmann was that the combined enterprises assume the Airbus risks
three years earlier than offered under the original proposal.
   That would mean that MBB will take over the government's 20
percent stake in Deutsche Airbus AG by Dec. 31, 1996.
   Haussmann said the privatization of West Germany's share in
Airbus would save the government $2.5 billion by the year 2000,
which would be passed on to taxpayers or added to pension funds.
   ``This would also put us on the road to resolving one of the
issues raised by the United States'' in discussion of West
German-U.S. trade relations, Haussmann told reporters.
   American aerospace giants like Boeing have contended that
government subsidies for Airbus gave the consortium unfair
competitive advantages, Haussmann noted.

<TEXT>
   Two more commodities traders have pleaded guilty
and another has pleaded innocent to federal charges that they
cheated customers while executing orders in the soybean pit at the
Chicago Board of Trade.
   The three traders who entered their pleas Thursday were among 45
traders and a clerk from the Board of Trade and Chicago Mercantile
Exchange who were indicted on charges stemming from the government's
probe of alleged fraud at the world's largest futures exchange.
   John Ryan, 49, of Winnetka, Ill., pleaded innocent before U.S.
District Judge William T. Hart to charges of mail and wire fraud and
violating federal commodities law.
   Kenneth Gillen, 29, of Naperville, Ill., pleaded guilty to one
misdemeanor count of pre-arranged trading that cost a customer $250.
   Harry O. Patten III, 39, of Western Springs, Ill., pleaded guilty
to two counts of commodity fraud _ one a misdemeanor, the other a
fellony. Patten admitted to carrying out an illegal pre-arranged
``curb trade'' with another trader after the closing bell and making
a $250 profit. He also admitted assisting in a pre-arranged trade
with two other brokers.
   Gillen and Patten agreed to testify at the trial of other
traders, said Assistant U.S. Attorney Mark Rotert.
   A federal grand jury returned the indictments last month after
the 2{-year investigation by FBI agents, disguised as traders, at
the Board of Trade and Merc.
   So far, 10 traders and the clerk have pleaded guilty and agreed
to cooperate with the government in the prosecution of at least 13
traders who have pleaded innocent and plan to fight the charges.
   No sentencing date has been set for any of those who pleaded
guilty.
   Gillen faces up to four months in prison under federal sentencing
guidelines, said his attorney David Schippers.
   Schippers said his client was the lone person indicted on only
one misdemeanor count, and that he believed curb trading ``was going
on as a daily affair'' at the CBOT.

<HEAD>Metro Population Growth Still Strong</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: CORRECTS word to `top' sted `two' in 2nd graf</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The fast-growing San Diego metropolitan area
jumped two spots to surpass both Baltimore and Pittsburgh last year,
the Census Bureau reports.
   New population estimates for the nation's metropolitan areas show
few changes among the top 25 urban areas, with New York still firmly
in first place, followed by Los Angeles and Chicago.
   The biggest move among the 25 largest communities was by San
Diego, which rose from 19th in 1987 to 17th last year. It added
84,100 people, climbing to 2,370,400 metro-area residents.
   That pushed the Southern California city past Baltimore and
Pittsburgh. Baltimore was listed with 2,342,500 residents, up 31,900
from the year before, and Pittsburgh declined 7,900, to 2,284,100.
   Not far down the list, fast-growing Phoenix pushed past the
burgeoning Tampa-St. Petersburg region.
   Phoenix added 51,500 residents over the year to climb to
2,029,500 and rise one spot to the nation's 20th largest metro area.
Tampa-St. Petersburg dropped to 21st, despite a gain of 38,000
people for a 1988 total of 1,995,100.
   While revised 1987 figures contained in the new report indicate
that Phoenix actually moved ahead of Tampa-St. Petersburg in that
year, the Florida metropolitan area had been listed as the larger of
the two on the basis of preliminary 1987 estimates.
   The Kansas City, Mo., and Kansas City, Kan., metro area edged up
one spot to 24th, passing Milwaukee-Racine, which fell to 25th.
   The calculations are for metropolitan areas, which are officially
defined by the federal Office of Management and Budget. These
regional designations are used for federal statistical purposes.
Generally they consist of central cities of at least 50,000 people
and the surrounding regions that are economically interrelated.
   Here is a rundown on the nation's 25 most populous metropolitan
areas, their estimated populations as of 1988, and the change from
the year before.
   1. New York-Northern New Jersey-Long Island, N.Y.-N.J.-Conn.:
18,120,200, up 41,000.
   2. Los Angeles-Anaheim-Riverside, Calif., 13,769,700, up 311,700.
   3. Chicago-Gary-Lake County, Ill.-Ind.-Wis., 8,180,900, up 34,300.
   4. San Francisco-Oakland-San Jose, Calif., 6,041,800, up 93,700.
   5. Philadelphia-Wilmington-Trenton, Pa.-N.J.-Del.-Md., 5,963,300,
up 52,500.
   6. Detroit-Ann Arbor, Mich., 4,620,200, down 6,500.
   7. Boston-Lawrence-Salem, Mass.-N.H., 4,109,900, up 18,400.
   8. Dallas-Fort Worth, Texas, 3,766,100, up 33,700.
   9. Washington, D.C.-Md.-Va., 3,734,200, up 80,100.

   The chairman of Italy's largest bank has resigned
over a scandal involving unauthorized export credits to Iraq granted
by the Italian bank's branch in Atlanta, Ga.
   Nerio Nesi, chairman of the state-owned Banca Nazionale del
Lavoro (BNL), and the bank's director-general, Giacomo Pedde,
stepped down at an extraordinary meeting of the bank's board
Thursday night, the bank said in a brief statement.
   The communique said that ``the board, faced with the resignations
of Chairman Nerio Nesi and Director-General Giacomo Pedde, expresses
to them its most ample and full recognition for the sensibility
demonstrated in the interest of the bank and confirms its highest
appreciation for the activity carried out in the fulfillment of
their respective responsibilities in the service of the
institution.''
   Treasury Minister Guido Carli today quickly named replacements
for the two top officials. Giampiero Cantoni was named chairman of
the state-owned Banca Nazionale del Lavoro and Paolo Savona will be
director-general, the government said.
   The nominations require Parliamentary approval. BNL is 74-percent
owned by the Treasury.
   Nesi, 64, had been chairman of the bank since 1978. He previously
held executive positions with Olivetti and the state-run RAI
broadcasting network.
   Pedde, 62, had been director-general since 1987.
   BNL said Thursday its Atlanta branch had extended at least $1.7
billion in unauthorized export credits to Iraq.
   The board meeting came three weeks after BNL announced it had
uncovered transactions by its Atlanta branch that were not
authorized by either the bank's North American management or its
Rome headquarters.
   BNL said the 2,500 transactions consisted of the confirmation of
letters of credit covering exports of agricultural products,
industrial machinery and plants to Iraq. BNL has said no arms
shipments were involved.
   It is the biggest banking scandal in Italy since Banco
Ambrosiano, Italy's largest private bank, collapsed in 1982 after
failure to collect $1.4 billion in loans to dummy companies in Latin
America.
   BNL said in the communique that its board ``unanimously expressed
complete faith in the patrimonial solidity of the institution.''
   The statement said the board felt obligated to take whatever
actions deemed necessary to defend the strength of the bank and
would ``eliminate the shortcomings in the control procedures, which
have emerged in these circumstances.''
   Earlier Thursday, in its first statement giving concrete details
of the affair, BNL said that the Atlanta branch had executed $1.72
billion in export credits to Iraq. The bank promised an additional
$920 million in credits, and BNL is investigating whether this
obligation was legally binding, the statement said.
   Of the $1.72 billion already disbursed, about $700 million are 98
percent guaranteed by the U.S. Commodity Credit Corp. and the
remaining $1.020 billion by the Iraqi central bank, BNL said.
   The bank has said the letters of credit, while correct
technically, exceeded the credit ceiling that BNL set for the
Atlanta branch.
   The transactions were conducted by the Atlanta bank manager,
Christopher Drogoul, who has since been suspended. BNL filed a
complaing against Drogoul with Italian justice authorities in Rome
on Wednesay.
   The transactions, which are believed to cover a period of three
years, were never reported on the official books by the branch
management, but were reportedly kept on a personal computer at
Drogoul's home.
   BNL has been under investigation by the U.S. Federal Reserve
Board and Georgia state banking authorities since the beginning of
August. The Bank of Italy, the central bank, is collaborating in the
probe.
   There have been reports the irregularities weren't limited to the
Atlanta branch but also involved BNL branches in Italy.
   BNL is 76-percent owned by the Italian Treasury, while the rest
of its voting capital is in the hands of state entities. It has
non-voting shares quoted on the Milan stock exchange.
   The securities industry watchdog committee Consob suspended
trading in BNL shares Tuesday after they dropped 9.7 percent to
14,900 lire, or $10.50 a share, on Monday, down from 16,500 lire, or
$11.80 a share, on Friday.
   The bank has said it doesn't expect to incur any losses from the
affair. But fears have been raised that Iraq, whose economy was
crippled by its war with Iraq, may be unable to meet its debt.
Analysts said the bank may have to set aside reserves to make
special provisions for the Iraqi credit.
   BNL had total assets of $88 billion at the end of 1988, and
ranked 44th in the world, according to IBCA Banking Analysis Ltd., a
London credit rating agency.
   Banking analysts have said the scandal won't have a major impact
on the bank's balance sheet or economic results. They say the main
damage is to BNL's image at home and abroad.
   Numerous politicians, both from the opposition and the governing
parties, have presented in Parliament scores of questions about the
scandal.
   ``It's a particularly delicate matter that involves the
functioning of the entire banking system,'' Arnaldo Forlani, head of
the dominant Christian Democrats, said Thursday.

<HEAD>Say Big Texas Investor, Buyout Specialist Kohlberg Kravis Might Bid</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Billionaire investor Robert Bass and takeover
firm Kohlberg Kravis Roberts &amp; Co. have contacted United Airlines'
Machinists union about bidding for parent company UAL Corp., the
Wall Street Journal reported today.
   Overtures from Bass and Kohlberg suggested a pilot-led $6.75
billion offer backed by management could face unexpected competition
in the bidding struggle for UAL, one of the nation's leading
airlines and a prime takeover target.
   United's Machinist union has not supported the pilot-management
proposal.
   UAL's board also is considering a $6.19 billion offer from Los
Angeles investor Marvin Davis, but there have been rumors that he
has started selling his stake in the company, an indication he might
scrap his takeover effort.
   UAL stock, which fell $5.12{ a share on the Davis rumor Thursday,
was up $2.75 a share to $284.50 in early New York Stock Exchange
trading today.
   The Journal quoted Machinists union vice president John Peterpaul
as saying a Bass-led group is seeking a meeting to discuss whether
the machinists would be interesting in supporting a bid.
   Peterpaul also was quoted as saying Kohlberg Kravis has expressed
interest as well. Both contacts were described as preliminary and no
possible purchase amount was disclosed.
   The bidding for Chicago-based UAL began several weeks ago with an
offer by Davis and quickly escalated into one of the biggest
takeover sagas of 1989, driving up the company's stock price on
speculation that higher offers would emerge.
   Bass is a leading corporate dealmaker from Texas with interests
in oil, financial services, real estate, publishing and investments
in several well-known companies.
   Kohlberg is a New York-based investment house that helped pioneer
the takeover strategy known as the leveraged buyout, in which
companies are bought with borrowed money repaid through earnings or
asset sales of the target company. Kohlberg paid nearly $25 billion
in mostly borrowed money to buy RJR Nabisco Inc. earlier this year,
the biggest takeover in history.

<TEXT>
   Former Standard Oil Co. chairman Robert Horton
has been appointed chairman of British Petroleum Co. PLC effective
next March.
   Horton, chairman of Cleveland-based Standard Oil from 1986 to
1988, will succeed Sir Peter Walters as chairman of the parent of BP
America Inc., British Petroleum's U.S. subsidiary and the company
that took over Standard Oil two years ago.
   Horton, 50, returned to London last year to become a managing
director of BP and in March was named deputy chairman.
   ``I think the company is going in a pretty good direction as it
is,'' Horton said Thursday after the announcement. ``I don't plan to
make any fundamental changes.''
   Walters, 58, announced Thursday he would retire after 35 years
with BP. He had been managing director of the oil giant for 17 years
and chairman since 1981. His retirement is effective March 10, 1990,
the company said.
   Horton said BP would focus on three key businesses: oil,
petroleum-based chemicals and nutrition.
   The British-born Horton joined BP in 1957 and has held a variety
of oil supply, marketing, finance and planning positions with the
company, which was partially owned by the British government until
two years ago.
   He was named general manager of the BP Tanker Co. in 1975 and one
year later was named head of BP Group's corporate planning
department. Horton became chief executive officer of BP Chemicals
International in 1980.

   The stock market eked out a small gain today,
struggling to recover from a three-session decline.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials rose 1.71 to 2,708.59 in
the first half hour of trading.
   Gainers outnumbered losers by about 5 to 4 in nationwide tradxing
of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 501 up, 410 down and
559 unchanged.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 21.32 million shares as of 10
a.m. on Wall Street.
   Analysts said traders' spirits got a small lift from spotty
declines this morning in open-market interest rates.
   But they said doubts persisted about the chances for any
concerted move in the near future by the Federal Reserve to relax
its credit policy further.
   That view, in turn, has reinforced suspicions among many market
participants that stocks might be due for a pullback after their
strong advance through the first eight months of the year.
   Brokers say the market's rise to record highs in late August also
may have touched off some selling by investors looking to ``get out
even'' after suffering large paper losses in the crash of 1987.
   Gainers among the blue chips included Exxon, up [ at 44];
International Paper, up { at 54}; Philip Morris, up [ at 164], and
Eastman Kodak, up [ at 49\.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks rose
.21 to 193.99. At the American Stock Exchange, the market value
index was up .09 at 383.28.
   On Thursday the Dow Jones industrial average dropped 12.91 to
2,706.88, stretching its loss for the last three sessions to 45.21
points.
   Advancing issues and declines ran about even on the NYSE, with
705 up, 701 down and 569 unchanged.
   Big Board volume totaled 160.16 million shares, against 161.80

<HEAD>ABA Survey: Fewer Agricultural Banks Own Farmland</HEAD>
<DATELINE>OMAHA, Neb. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Fewer agricultural banks owned repossessed
farmland last year than in 1987, a survey by the American Bankers
Association indicates.
   A new report, based on an October 1988 survey, indicated that
35.6 percent of the banks polled owned repossessed land, the bankers
association said. That's down from 46 percent in a similar survey a
year earlier.
   Of five regions listed in the study, banks in the Corn Belt
states of North Dakota, South Dakota, Nebraska, Kansas, Oklahoma and
Texas were most likely to own farmland, the study said.
   In those six states, 41.2 percent of the farm banks surveyed said
they owned repossessed land, the ABA said.
   Plains states _ Iowa, Missouri, Illinois, Indiana and Ohio _ also
had above-average rates of land ownership with 40.5 percent, the
survey indicated.
   Other regional ownership rates were 36.8 percent in the
Northeast, 26.5 percent in the South and 34.4 percent in the West,
according to the survey.
   Nationwide, the average agricultural bank owned 634 acres of
repossessed farmland worth $620,000, the survey said.
   Banks in the Corn Belt states averaged 264 acres of repossessed
land worth $207,000, the smallest average among the five regions.
   Banks in the western Region, all states west of the Corn Belt,
reported the highest averages, with 2,841 acres worth $5.3 million,
the study said.
   The report was based on survey forms returned by 749 banks that
either have $2.5 million or more in farm production loans or have
more than 50 percent of their loan portfolio in farm loans, the ABA
said.
   The association sent survey forms to 2,273 banks randomly
selected from the 4,547 that met the agricultural bank requirements.
   The report said small and medium-sized banks are more likely to
own famrland.
   Of the small banks, those with assets of $50 million or less,
38.2 percent owned farmland. Of the medium-sized banks, with assets
of $50 million to $100 million, 37.4 percent owned agricultural
land. About 28 percent of larger banks owned land, the study said.
   The report also said the number of farm borrowers who had reached
their credit limit was down slightly, decreasing from 25.3 percent
in June 1987 to 22.6 percent in June 1988.

<HEAD>TVA May Be Penalized for Returning to Public Debt Market</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BART ZIEGLER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Like a parent scolding an ungrateful child, a
federal financing agency has warned the Tennessee Valley Authority
that if it sells bonds to the public, it can never come back home.
   The TVA, the federal agency that supplies electricity to many
parts of the South, is debating whether to float bonds in the public
market for the first time in 15 years.
   But if it goes ahead with its plan to sell a huge, $6.5 billion
issue on Wall Street to refinance old, high-interest notes, the
Federal Financing Bank says it never again will loan TVA its
low-cost funds.
   The Federal Financing Bank is an arm of the Treasury Department
that loans money to federal agencies such as the U.S. Postal
Service, the Export-Import Bank and the Rural Electrification
Administration by buying bonds that they issue.
   The bond purchases are like a private loan to the agencies since
the financing bank keeps the bonds and receives all the interest
paid on them. Their advantage is lower interest rates than those of
bonds sold on the public market.
   TVA wants to pay off bonds from the financing bank that carry
interest rates averaging about 12.25 percent. It says it should be
able to float new public-market bonds at about 9 percent or lower,
reflecting how much interest rates have dropped since the bonds were
bought.
   The refinancing should save TVA about $100 million a year for the
next 20 years, said William F. Malec, chief financial officer of the
Knoxville, Tenn.-based agency, which is the nation's largest power
company.
   That, in turn, should help TVA hold down its electric rates. TVA,
established by Congress in 1933 to help develop the rural South,
sells power at wholesale rates to municipal and cooperative power
companies in seven states that serve about 3 million households.
   TVA has borrowed exclusively from the financing bank since that
agency's creation in 1974, and it owes it about $16.5 billion. TVA
also has about $1.5 billion in public debt outstanding that was sold
before 1974.
   TVA's Malec decided to go to the public market for refinancing
after the Federal Financing Bank declined to loan it fresh money at
lower rates ahead of the call dates of the existing bonds, which are
several years away.
   But the financing bank made clear late last month in a letter to
TVA that it no longer would loan TVA money should it go that route.
   ``We're in a situation where the FFB is under no requirement to
lend to us,'' Malec said.
   However, Malec said last week, the decision over floating public
bonds may not be that tough because the cost of the financing
agency's funds is not substantially lower than the rate the TVA
could get in the public market.
   Another factor in favor of public borrowing is that it would
allow the TVA to structure bonds in more favorable terms, such as
allowing them to be called earlier than the federal bonds should
interest rates drop.
   Malec said the TVA expects to make its decision in a few weeks.
In the meantime, U.S. Sen. Albert Gore Jr., D-Tenn., and other
members of the Tennessee congressional delegation say they will try
to persuade the financing bank to change its stance.
   There's little question TVA bonds would receive a warm welcome
from the credit market. TVA's old public debt holds the top rating
from the major credit-rating agencies. Also, 17 investment houses
submitted proposals to help bring new notes to market, Malec said.
Of these, five were selected, with First Boston Corp. chosen as lead
underwriter.
   Ralph Horn, an executive vice president of First Tennessee Bank,
which helped underwrite past TVA public bond issues, said TVA notes
were always a hit.
   ``The bidding was always extremely strong. They got extremely
competitive rates,'' he said.
   Should TVA be cut off from federal funding, ``I think the demand
for their securities in the public market would suffice,'' Horn said.
   However, a large part of TVA's sterling credit rating is based on
its ability to tap the financing bank, said Amelie L. Wogan, an
analyst at Standard &amp; Poor's Corp. Should that link be severed,
TVA's rating would be reevaluated, she said.

<HEAD>Ashland Oil Agrees To Pay $325 Million To Iran's National Oil Company</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GINA HOLLAND</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>JACKSON, Miss. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Iran's state oil company has settled out of
court for less than half of the $768 million it sought from Ashland
Oil Inc.
   Ashland said Thursday it had agreed to pay $325 million to
National Iranian Oil Co. to settle a 10-year dispute over crude oil
purchases from Iran.
   The dispute began when National Iranian Oil Co. said a subsidiary
of Ashland refused to pay for crude oil in 1979. A jury trial in the
case was scheduled to begin Monday in U.S. District Court in Jackson.
   ``Both sides were ready to settle at a certain number. But there
was a lot of discrepancy between those numbers until the last few
days,'' said Dan Lacy, vice president of corporate communications
for the Ashland, Ky., company. ``We are pleased.''
   Ashland representatives said Ashland Overseas Trading Limited
refused to pay for the oil because the Iranian company renegged on
the contract, forcing the company to buy higher-priced oil on the
open market. Ashland officials did not say why the Middle Eastern
firm backed out of the contract but said the deal was broken during
the Iranian hostage crisis in 1979.
   National Iranian has said it stopped sending oil to Ashland
because the American firm didn't pay its bill.
   The Jackson-based attorney for National Iranian could not be
reached for comment Thursday.
   The three-day court-monitored negotiations for the settlement
ended Thursday afternoon, Lacy said. Court officials in Biloxi could
not be reached for comment Thursday.
   ``We've had negotiations for years. This is our first
court-supervised negotiation,'' Lacy said.
   National Iranian filed a complaint in 1985 in Mississippi, which
is served by Ashland Oil, Lacy said. The case, which had been in
courts in England, Bermuda and the United States since 1980, was
brought to Mississippi, where the deadline for a court appearance
has not run out.
   The Iranian firm had asked for $768 million, which included
interest on the price of the oil, according to Ashland reports.
   ``Ashland never disputed receiving the crude oil or that it was
obligated to pay a reasonable price for it,'' said Ashland Chairman
John Hall. Hall, who was in Mississippi overseeing the settlement,
termed it fair and best for both sides.
   Ashland officials said there was no government pressure to settle
the case.

   The national airline Sabena cancelled 15
flights Friday because of labor actions and faced a 24-hour pilot
strike and continuing slowdown tactics of the cabin crews over the
weekend.
   The pilots will go on strike from Saturday morning until Sunday
morning while the flight attendants will board all Sabena planes two
hours late on Sunday to push demands for better pay, said Sabena
spokesman Daniel de Vinck.
   The slowdown actions of the 1,200 flight attendants wreaked havoc
with the Sabena schedules Friday and the flights that went through
suffered long delays.
   The labor unrest at Sabena started three weeks ago and management
and unions are still wide apart on the pay issue, the focus of the
dispute.
   The unions have already threatened to reinforce their actions
next week if no agreement on their claims is reached.
   No talks between management and unions are planned for the
weekend, said de Vinck.

   RJR Nabisco Inc. has put together a good track
record in the four months since Kohlberg Kravis Roberts &amp; Co. bought
the food and tobacco giant in the biggest corporate acquisition
ever, securities analysts say.
   The announcement Thursday that RJR Nabisco would sell the fresh

that the company is taking the right steps to ensure its financial
stability.
   The sale was part of a divestment plan to help defray the costs
of the $24.53 billion leveraged buyout of RJR Nabisco completed in
late April. In a leveraged buyout, a company is acquired with mainly
borrowed funds, which are paid back through asset sales and the
company's cash flow.
   The Wall Street Journal reported today that RJR Nabisco expected
to sell Del Monte's canned food business to a Citicorp Venture
Capital-led group for about $1.48 billion. The Journal said the
price fell short of what RJR Nabisco hoped to get for the division,
and that other segments of the company might have to be sold.
   David Kalis, an RJR Nabisco spokesman, said the company had no
comment on the report.
   Kohlberg Kravis, a specialist in leveraged buyouts, said earlier
this year that about $5.5 billion in RJR Nabisco assets would be
sold. The latest sale puts RJR Nabisco more than halfway toward its
divestment goal.
   Moody's Investors Service Inc., a company that rates the
creditworthiness of bond issuers like RJR Nabisco, ``has confidence
in management's ability to do what they are in fact doing,'' Gloria
Vila, a Moody's analyst, said Thursday.
   She said the asset sale plan is on track and that the prices RJR
Nabisco has received for its businesses were so far in line with
expectations.
   The biggest asset sale to date came in June, when RJR Nabisco
sold five of its European businesses to BSN, a French food and
beverage company, for $2.5 billion.
   The company also sold its biscuit and food businesses in India
and Pakistan for $44 million to Britannia Industries Pte. Ltd. of
Singapore, and its Chun King food division for $52 million to a
group of investors from Singapore.
   Both Moody's and Standard &amp; Poor's Corp., another credit-rating
service, lowered their ratings on RJR Nabisco's bonds and other debt
after the acquisition by Kohlberg Kravis. It is common for a
company's credit rating to be downgraded if it takes on a heavy debt
load.
   Bond investors apparently have had few doubts about RJR Nabisco.
They scooped up the record $4 billion in junk bonds issued as part
of the buyout.
   Moody's did not plan any further adjustments in its rating of RJR
Nabisco debt, although the service was confident ``that they are
going to be able to complete their asset sales on time and at prices
that they indicated,'' Ms. Vila said.
   She noted that the company has had a drop in the volume of its
domestic tobacco business, which could raise concern about RJR
Nabisco's cash flow and in turn, its ability to repay its debt.
   However, the drop in volume was being offset by price increases,
and RJR Nabisco was reconsidering its marketing strategy to find a
way to boost sales, she said.
   There was no connection between the falloff in volume and the
buyout, Ms. Vila said, noting that RJR Nabisco's cigarette brands
have been slipping in the United States for the last five years.
   RJR Nabisco got another vote of confidence recently when the
investment firm Salomon Brothers Inc. added to its ``buy'' list the
securities Kohlberg Kravis issued to shareholders as part of the
merger deal.
   The securities, known as a ``stub,'' are debentures, or bonds,
that can be converted into stock in the future.
   Salomon called the stub ``an attractive way to participate in the
equity of the RJR leveraged buyout.''
   The investment firm also was pleased with RJR Nabisco's projected
profit growth, which Salomon put at 15 percent.
   The success of the RJR Nabisco deal is crucial to the reputation
of Kohlberg Kravis, the leader among firms that specialize in
leveraged buyouts.
   Kohlberg Kravis reportedly has had trouble selling some of its
businesses and several others either are foundering or have been
disappointing investments.
   Seaman's Furniture Co., which went private in a $360 million
buyout led by Kohlberg Kravis two years ago, has said it must
renegotiate debt payments, partly because sales growth has not met
expectations.
   Adding to the company's troubles was a lawsuit filed against it
last month by Jerome Kohlberg Jr., one of its founders. Kohlberg
alleged the firm reduced his stake in several companies Kohlberg
Kravis acquired while he was a managing partner there.

   Grain and soybean futures prices were mostly lower
in early trading today on the Chicago Board of Trade, reflecting
some profit-taking after the previous session's rally.
   Soybean futures had risen to a two-week high of $6 a bushel
Thursday on perceptions of increased foreign demand for soybean oil.
   Traders were disappointed late Thursday to learn that the Soviet
Union would not make an immediate purchase of U.S. soybean oil,
although the Soviets indicated they were interested in buying soy
oil if prices drop.
   Today's early losses were limited by forecasts for a rainy
weekend in the Midwest, where the corn and soybean crops are rapidly
maturing.
   The forecasts are feeding fears of corn and soybean harvest
delays and of winter-wheat planting delays.
   In early trading, wheat was } cent to 2 cents lower with the
contract for delivery in September at $3.95\ a bushel; corn was 1
cent lower \ cent higher with September at $2.36} a bushel; oats
were { cent to } cent lower with September at $1.35} a bushel;
soybeans were 1{ cents lower to 2\ cents higher with September at

   Livestock and meat futures were lower in early trading on the

   Live cattle were .02 cent to .50 cent lower with October at 72.35
cents a pound; feeder cattle were .20 cent to .40 cent lower with
October at 81.70 cents a pound; hogs were .47 cent to .65 cent lower
with October at 39.12 cents a pound; frozen pork bellies were .65
cent to 1 cent lower with February at 46.10 cents a pound.
   Livestock and meat futures advanced Thursday, with pork bellies
up the 2-cents-a-pound daily limit on speculation that some of
America's surplus bellies will be shipped to Poland as part of a
food-aid package.

   Record-keeping methods that would allow
investigators to reconstruct trades on the nation's commodities
exchanges are ``fundamentally inadequate,'' a Senate committee was
told today.
   But officials of the General Accounting Office said
computerization doesn't necessarily spell the end of the historical
hurly-burly method of trading by shouts and hand signals known as
open outcry.
   ``I think that's a question the exchanges themselves need to
answer,'' said Richard L. Fogel, an assistant comptroller general
with the GAO, the auditing arm of Congress.
   ``I don't personally believe that the government should dictate
how the exchanges want to trade,'' he added.
   Fogel was testifying before the Senate Committee on Agriculture,
Nutrition and Forestry about a study of the methods used by
exchanges to track trading and keep futures traders honest.
Questions about trading practices have emerged in the aftermath of
alleged fraud in Chicago's commodity pits.
   The study found exchange systems for tracking a given trade,
known as an ``audit trail,'' lacking because so much of the record
keeping is left to the traders and brokers themselves.
   Sen. Patrick Leahy asked Fogel if he believed the ``current audit
trail systems in place at the major U.S. exchanges are fundamentally
inadequate to police the trading floors against abuses?''
   ``I think it is. Yes,'' said Fogel, noting that there is no
guarantee that information about the timing of when an order gets to
a broker and when the order is executed by the broker.
   Earlier, Leahy, the committee's chairman noted that ``the public
is not adequately protected. Audit trails are the backbone of the
floor policing systems; they must be improved substantially before
we can guarantee the integrity of the trading pits.''
   Forty-five traders at the Chicago Board of Trade and the Chicago
Mercantile Exchange were charged Aug. 2 with bilking profits from
hundreds of customers through a series of illegal activities,
including falsified trading records.
   ``While detecting every abuse may never be possible, most of the
types of abuses alleged in the Justice Department indictments could
also have been detected and documented with independent, precise and
complete timing of trades,'' said a report by the General Accounting
Office, the watchdog arm of Congress.
   At issue is the ``audit trail,'' a term describing the process of
determining who bought what from whom and when they did it. In other
words, the ability to reconstruct precisely any given transaction.
   The two futures exchanges, the largest in the world, have been
criticized for not keeping a closer watch on traders, while the
Commodity Futures Trading Commission, which oversees the futures
markets, has been accused of doing so with too light a touch.
   ``Although improvements in the audit trail system would aid in
the detection of the kind of abuses we've seen in Chicago,'' said a
CFTC spokeswoman Thursday evening, ``if you're going to identify and
prosecute this kind of activity you're also going to need the kind
of undercover observation and surveillance we had.''
   The CFTC is up for reauthorization this fall and a
reauthorization bill passed by the House would require exchanges to
reconstruct a trade to within one minute of its occurence, no later
than one year after the bill becomes law.
   Audit trails accurate to the nearest 30 seconds would be required
within three years of the bill's enactment.
   Within weeks of the indictments, the two Chicago exchanges
announced they were developing hand-held computer terminals to
record floor trading.
   But the GAO study said the CFTC has ``not been actively involved
in conducting or setting guidelines for technical assessments of
these systems' capabilities to control trading abuses and automation
risks.''
   The GAO also said the CFTC lacks ``the necessary technical
resources'' to keep tabs on the exchanges' developing technology.
   The Senate requested the GAO study in March.

   The fires will again surround this
bend-of-the-road outpost in the fall to burn off the sugarcane
greenery and expose the stalks to the cutters' machetes.
   But while growers in the rich mucklands south of Lake Okeechobee
prepare for this ancient harvest ritual, officials in Washington are
talking about a different kind of slashing for the domestic sugar
industry.
   With the sugar-subsidy program expiring next year, manufacturer
and consumer groups have begun campaigning to trim a system they
claim unfairly restricts foreign competition and costs taxpayers
billions of dollars by keeping U.S. raw sugar nearly double the
world price.
   The reform effort, shepherded by the well-funded Sweetener Users'
Association, is calling for a nearly 33 percent reduction in the
government's guaranteed sugar price of 18 cents per pound, about 6
cents higher than on foreign commodity markets. Raw sugar currently
sells for about 22 cents a pound on U.S. markets.
   Under the 1985 Farm Bill, growers have been able to receive an
18-cent-a-pound loan using their crop as collateral. They have
either six months to pay back the Commodity Credit Corp. with
interest or forfeit the sugar.
   ``Our view is simple. The price is too high,'' said Thomas
Hammer, president for the Washington-based users' group,
representing trade associations and major manufacturers such as
Hershey Foods Corp. and Coca-Cola Co. ``Keeping the price high makes
products cost more and takes money out of the taxpayers' pocket.''
   Hammer claims the program costs U.S. consumers about $3 billion a
year and encourages farmers in the Midwest to grow more profitable
sugar beets rather than food crops, such as wheat or barley.
   ``We callthat the $3 billion lie,'' said Barbara Miedema,
spokeswoman for the Florida Sugar Cane League Inc., representing
about half the nation's sugar cane growers.
   Ms. Miedema and other representatives of the nation's estimated
12,000 sugarcane and sugar beet growers say the price supports and
import quotas are necessary to balance competition from other
countries with heavily subsidized sugar industries.
   For example, she said the European Economic Community nations buy
sugar from beet growers at 28 to 30 cents a pounds for domestic
consumption, then dump the surplus on world markets.
   The United States, one of the few nations where sugar demand
outpaces domestic production, would be flooded with inexpensive
foreign sugar if the import quotas were lifted, she said. The United
States now imports about 14 percent of its sugar.
   ``We'd just be letting another domestic industry go down the
drain,'' she said.
   The federal sugar program was adopted in 1981 following years of
fluctuating prices, which peaked at near 60 cents a pound in 1980.
Further reform was taken after a flood of imported sugar in 1984
dropped prices and growers defaulted on $77 million in loans. In
1985, the loan rate was set at 18 cents a pound and strict import
quotas were established.
   Since 1981, the shelf price has remained between 33 cents and 39
cents a pound.
   Each September, U.S. agriculture officials announce the expected
domestic sugar production and set import levels. The forecast for
this season is domestic production of about 7.3 million tons and
imports of about 1.2 million tons. Leading importers include the
Dominican Republic, Philippines and Brazil.
   But the Bush administration is now studying the quotas following
a ruling in June by the Geneva-based General Agreement on Tariffs
and Trade that the program violated international trade pacts.
   To comply with GATT, the United States would have to set limits
on domestic sugar production.
   Some advocates of scrapping the quotas claim it would help the
economies of struggling Caribbean nations, including Jamaica and
Barbados, which send thousands of workers to cut cane each year in
the United States under a special immigration policy.
   Meanwhile, sugar demand in the United States is falling. Refined
sugar consumption last year was estimated at 7.8 million tons, down
from more than 10 million tons in 1979, Department of Agriculture
figures show. Use of corn-based sweeteners has more than doubled
during the same period.
   Florida _ where growers also face legal challenges from
environmentalists worried about chemical fertilizer runoff into the
Everglades _ produced about 1.5 million tons of sugar last year.
Hawaii, Louisiana and Texas combined for nearly 2 million tons.
   Minnesota leads the 13 principal sugar beet states, which
produced about nearly 3.9 million tons of refined sugar last year.
   A report released in August by the American Sugar Alliance
estimated the sugar industry, including corn sweeteners, generates
$18.5 billion a year in wages and revenue in 42 states.
   The first public hearing by the House Agriculture Subcommittee on
Cotton, Rice and Sugar was held last month in Colorado and several
others are planned before spring. The subcommittee will then begin
taking testimony on the Farm Bill in Washington.
   ``Talk of change is definitely in the air, but the options are so
limitless at this point it's hard to predict,'' said Jim Terrill,
senior vice president at the United States Sugar Corp. in Clewiston,
the nation's oldest sugar cane plant. ``We're all watching it real
closely.''

   The stock market showed a broad loss today,
extending its week-long slump.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, down 45.21 points in the
last three sessions since Labor Day, fell another 14.06 to 2,692.82
by noontime today on Wall Street.
   Losers outnumbered gainers by more than 2 to 1 in nationwide
tradxing of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 413 up, 878
down and 539 unchanged.
   Analysts said traders' spirits got a small lift from spotty
declines this morning in open-market interest rates.
   But they said doubts persisted about the chances for any
concerted move in the near future by the Federal Reserve to relax
its credit policy further.
   That view, in turn, has reinforced suspicions among many market
participants that stocks might be due for a pullback after their
strong advance through the first eight months of the year.
   Brokers say the market's rise to record highs in late August also
may have touched off some selling by investors looking to ``get out
even'' after suffering large paper losses in the crash of 1987.
   Losers among the blue chips included General Electric, down | at

   Airline stocks continued their recent pullback after a dramatic

1{ to 81[, and Delta Air Lines | to 74|.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks
dropped 1.06 to 192.72. At the American Stock Exchange, the market
value index was off .85 at 382.34.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 84.98 million shares at noontime,

   SmithKline Beecham PLC has received the
federal government's permission to sell a hepatitis B vaccine the
company hopes will give it a foothold in the $80 million to $85
million market now dominated by Merck &amp; Co., officials said.
   SmithKline officials would not disclose sales estimates for the
vaccine, Engerix-B, which was approved for sale in Europe in 1986
and is now distributed in about 80 countries, including Canada and
Australia.
   Catherine Sohn, director of vaccine marketing, said the vaccine
is $20 cheaper than Rahway, N.J.-based Merck's Recombivax, its sole
competitor in this country, and is about four months faster in
taking effect.
   Engerix-B, which will cost $149, involves three doses
administered over two months, Sohn said.
   But Merck spokesman said Gary Bruell said Recombivax costs
between $128 and $148, ``and thus our price is comparable.'' He said
Recombivax is administered in three doses over six months.
   ``It is important that there is another weapon in the fight
against this infectious disease,'' Bruell said.
   The vaccine received U.S. Food and Drug Administration approval
Aug. 28 and shipments to wholesalers began immediately. The vaccine
should reach doctors by Monday, Sohn said.
   Hepatitis B strikes an estimated 300,000 people in this country
each year, killing at least 5,000. Chronic carriers of hepatitis B
are prone to develop liver cancer and cirrhosis.
   Hepatitis B is transmitted sexually or through blood-to-blood
contact. High-risk groups include homosexual males, intravenous drug
abusers, health-care workers and Southeast Asians.
   The federal Occupational Safety and Health Administration has
recommended requiring employers to offer hepatitis B vaccinations
free to any workers who risk contracting the disease through their
jobs.
   OSHA's recommendations also include protective clothing and
education about hepatitis.
   Work place exposure results in 6,000 to 7,400 hepatitis B
infections each year in the United States, causing up to 400
hospitalizations and 130 to 165 deaths.
   The vaccine approval comes just more than a month after
SmithKline Beckman Corp. stockholders approved a merger with Beecham
Group PLC, creating the world's second-largest pharmaceutical firm
with estimated sales of $6 billion a year.
   SmithKline officials agreed to the merger after a tumultuous year
that saw the company go through a reorganization as a result of
declining sales of Tagamet, its ulcer drug, and Dyazide, a popular
high blood-pressure medicine.

<TEXT>
   Senate tax-writers, swamped by complaints from
retirees, reached a preliminary agreement today on reducing
catastrophic health insurance benefits and the taxes that finance
them.
   ``I think we made major progress,'' Sen. Lloyd Bentsen, D-Texas,
chairman of the Finance Committee, told reporters. ``It's coming
along in a bipartisan way.''
   Bentsen said the committee, meeting behind closed doors, reached
a consensus that:
   _The surtax paid by the wealthiest 40 percent of retirees, the
chief financing mechanism for catastrophic insurance, will be
reduced significantly. The 15 percent rate and the maximum annual
surtax of $800 will be cut.
   _The flat monthly premium, paid by most retirees, will not be
raised above current law.
   _Retirees will have to shoulder a larger share of their doctors'
fees and prescription costs before catastrophic benefits become
available.
   Bentsen said the panel reached no conclusion on whether taxes
should be raised on non-retirees to pay part of the cost of
catastrophic coverage.
   The catastrophic insurance program, aimed at protecting retirees
from being bankrupted by a catastrophic illness, has been under
attack since it was enacted a year ago as an expansion of Medicare.
   The program is financed by beneficiaries, and most of the
complaints have come from higher-income retirees who contend they
are bearing most of the cost of the program.
   Other older Americans complain that they don't need the program _
or its costs _ because they have private insurance.
   Under one proposal being considered, the maximum annual earnings
on which the 1.45 percent Social Security hospitalization tax is
imposed would be increased from $48,000 to $60,000. That would mean
a $174-a-year tax increase for a worker making $60,000 or more and
the same increase on the employer.
   The hospitalization tax is withheld from paychecks as part of the
Social Security tax.
   The House Ways and Means Committee, which also has been hearing
protests, has agreed to reduce the surtax that's the main financing
source for the program, shift more of the cost to lower-income
retirees and require the elderly to pay a greater share of their
catastrophic expenses before they start collecting program benefits.
   Bentsen and several Finance Committee colleagues said they would
have no part of shifting more of the burden onto those with lower
incomes.
   ``I will oppose any increase in the flat premium paid by retirees
of modest means,'' said Bentsen, referring to the $4-a-month fee
assessed all but the poorest Medicare beneficiaries.
   The committee staff outlined several ways that catastrophic
benefits could be reduced to lower overall costs.
   About two-thirds of the cost of the program is paid by the 41
percent of older citizens whose incomes are high enough that they
owe federal income tax of more than $150. They pay a surtax of 15
percent of income tax above $150; about 1.8 million of the 33
million Medicare beneficiaries will pay the maximum surtax of $800
this year.
   A single retiree would have to owe at least $5,333 in income tax
before having to pay the $800 maximum.
   The surtax rate is due to increase to 28 percent and the maximum
surtax to $1,050 by 1993.
   The rest of the cost is financed through the flat $4 monthly fee,
which is scheduled to rise to $10.20 by 1993.
   The Bush administration said it would prefer no change, but
William Diefenderfer, deputy director of the Office of Management
and Budget, conceded ``that doesn't seem to be what's going to
happen.''
   Diefenderfer said repeal of catastrophic care would worsen the
federal deficit in 1990 by as much as $7 billion, because taxes
earmarked for the program come in faster than benefits are paid out.
Killing the program would automatically trigger across-the-board
cuts in most federal spending.
   There is considerable support in the House for outright repeal of
the catastrophic care plan, an idea that drew the support of Sen.
John C. Danforth, R-Mo.
   ``I question the kind of commitment we made last year,'' he said,
noting the program leans toward long-term hospital care.
   ``This isn't something they (older Americans) want,'' Danforth
said. ``It's something they fear ... being hooked up'' to
life-support equipment and the like.

   The Bush administration says it is set to call
for a five-year, $1.9 billion program to promote advanced computing
technology, including the creation of a very high-speed network
linking the nation's supercomputers.
   Mary Catherine English, spokeswoman for the White House Office of
Science and Technology Policy, said today that a report detailing
the computer strategy will be released officially Monday.
   According to a final draft of the report obtained by The
Associated Press, high-performance computing ``represents the
leading edge of a multi-billion dollar world market in which the
United States is increasingly being challenged.''
   ``A strong, fully competitive domestic high-performance computer
industry contributes to U.S. leadership in critical national
security areas and in broad sectors of the civilian economy,'' the
document said.
   The program envisions establishment of a National Research and
Education Network, or NREN, which would transmit data between
supercomputers at speeds up to 3 gigabits _ 3 billion bits _ per
second, or 2,000 times faster than current computer networks.
   ``This tremendous challenge is within the grasp of the United
States in the next 10 years,'' the draft report said.
   In addition to linking supercomputers, it said, the new network
also would tie together other computers at approximately 1,000 sites
across the country.
   ``The NREN should be the prototype of a national information
infrastructure which could be available to every home, office and
factory,'' the document said.
   It added that ``wherever information is used, from manufacturing
to high-definition home video entertainment, and most particularly
in education, the country will benefit enormously from deployment of
this technology.''
   The proposed program also would involve increased federal support
for research and development work on high-performance computer
equipment, software and training.
   Federal spending needed to implement the program would grow from
an estimated $151 million in the first year up to $597 million in
the fifth year, for a total of $1.917 billion, the draft report said.
   The administration plan is similar to legislation introduced by
Sen. Albert Gore Jr., D-Tenn., who chairs the Senate Commerce
subcommittee on science, technology and space.
   His legislation would authorize $1.75 billion over a five-year
period for projects including establishment of a very high-speed
national computer network by 1996.
   The bill also would call for a coordinated national strategy on
high-performance computer technology as well as increased funding
for research and development of advanced computer equipment and
software.

<HEAD>Government Seizures of MCorp Banks May Be Illegal</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   DALLAS (AP)_ A federal judge's preliminary ruling could spell
trouble for the federal government's seizure of a number of Texas
banks, including MCorp and Texas American Bancshares Inc.
   In preliminary findings issued last week, U.S. District Judge
Robert Porter ruled the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. had acted
illegally in seizing $17 million owed to one of the five banks still
owned by MCorp, once the second-largest bank holding company in
Texas.
   The ruling came in a suit brought by MCorp's bank in New
Braunfels and does not involve the parent company, said MCorp
spokesman Joe Stroop.
   Nevertheless, Stroop said, MCorp has a suit pending before Porter
which makes some of the same assertions.
   At issue is whether federal regulators acted properly in refusing
to return to some otherwise solvent banks funds they had on deposit
in insolvent sister institutions.
   Regulators fully repaid other creditors and Porter said the FDIC
acted illegally because federal banking law requires it to treat all
creditors equally when a bank failed.
   ``It is still just a preliminary ruling, and the judge has asked
for additional information,'' FDIC deputy general counsel Mark Rosen
said.
   Still, the opinion could be used to decide larger cases, Dallas
attorney David Bryant said.
   ``We feel strongly it is the correct ruling and that none of the
courts that look at it will find differently,'' said Bryant, an
attorney for MCorp.
   The government seized 20 of MCorp's 25 banks last March,
eventually selling them to Banc One Corp. MCorp's suit claims 12 of
those 20 were illegally forced into insolvency by the government's
action. Regulators have estimated the rescue will be the second most
expensive in the nation's history.
   Similarly, Texas American Bancshares has sued the FDIC, claiming
some of the 24 banks seized were improperly made insolvent.

takeover bid. Picks up 7th graf pvs, During the ...</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Plessey Co. PLC gave up its nine-month fight Friday
against a $3.14 billion takeover bid by General Electric Co. PLC and
Siemens AG of West Germany, and advised its shareholders to accept
the offer.
   The recommendation came after GEC and Siemens said earlier in the
day that they controlled 50.4 percent of Plessey, a British
electronics concern.
   The bidders said that with the majority stake and clearance on
all regulatory matters, they were able to make their offer
unconditional.
   ``Under the circumstances, it is in (Plessey) shareholders best
interests to realize their investment,'' a Plessey statement said.
   Plessey said it will now enter into discussion with GEC and
Siemens to help ensure ``an orderly transition.''
   Last month, the bidding consortium raised its hostile offer to
270 pence, or $4.16, a share, valuing Plessey at 2.04 billion
pounds, or $3.14 billion.
   In announcing earlier Friday they had won control of a majority
of Plessey stock, GEC and Siemens extended their bid until Sept. 28
which will allow for further acceptances of the offer.
   During the bitter nine-month takeover battle, Plessey argued that
the bid was inadequate.
   Plessey's earlier offer, made last year, was 225 pence per share.
That offer automatically lapsed in January following the British
government's decision to investigate the impact of the proposed
merger on the defense electronics industry.
   In August, the Department of Trade and Industry cleared the
companies' bid for Plessey after it agreed to several conditions
designed mainly to preserve competition in the defense electronics
business.
   GEC agreed that it will not take any interest in the Plessey
radar, military communications and traffic control businesses.
Originally, the companies had planned for GEC to take a 35 percent
interest in Siemens' defense interest.
   The companies also agreed that Siemens, as the potential owner of
the Plessey defense companies, would name only British citizens
directors of the units and that Siemens employees given access to
sensitive Plessey defense contract work would undergo U.K. security
clearance procedures.
   Also, GEC and Siemens have agreed to make available the
technology of the Joint Tactical Information Distribution System, a
project on which Plessey and GEC were competing, to other British
companies.
   Apart from the defense-related areas, GEC and Siemens are taking
equal shares in Plessey's electronic components and other
businesses. GEC is also making Siemens a minority partner in its
existing telecommunications joint venture with Plessey, GEC Plessey
Telecommunications.
   As expected, the bid also received final clearance by the
European Commission last week.
   An earlier 1.2 billion pound takeover bid by GEC for Plessey, in
1986, failed after the British Monopolies and Mergers Commission
ruled that the combined group would have too large a slice of the
defense electronics business.

   The stock market was mixed today, struggling to
pull out of its week-long slump.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, down 45.21 points in the
last three sessions since Labor Day, recovered 2.66 to 2,709.54 by 2
p.m. today on Wall Street.
   But losers outnumbered gainers by about 7 to 6 in nationwide
tradxing of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 620 up, 735
down and 552 unchanged.
   Analysts said traders' spirits got a small lift from spotty
declines this morning in open-market interest rates.
   But they said doubts persisted about the chances for any
concerted move in the near future by the Federal Reserve to relax
its credit policy further.
   That view, in turn, has reinforced suspicions among many market
participants that stocks might be due for a pullback after their
strong advance through the first eight months of the year.
   Brokers say the market's rise to record highs in late August also
may have touched off some selling by investors looking to ``get out
even'' after suffering large paper losses in the crash of 1987.
   Among actively traded blue chips, Eastman Kodak rose 1] to 50{

   The newly reinstated rule requiring Gulf
Coast shrimpers to put turtle-escape doors on their nets drew
scattered protests today, including an apparently unsuccessful
blockade in Louisiana waters. One defiant fisherman said he would
rather ``set my boat on fire.''
   Critics complain that too much of their catch escapes with the
endangered turtles because they must use so-called turtle excluder
devices, or TEDs.
   Shrimpers in Louisiana set up a 30-boat blockade of a shipping
channel this morning, Coast Guard officials said. It had little
effect, but participants may be subject to arrest if they don't
move, officials said.
   And about 400 to 500 other shrimpers and supporters from
Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama and Florida displayed protest signs
along the route of a presidential motorcade as George Bush rode into
New Orleans from a nearby naval air station for speeches to two
groups.
   The protest along the motorcade route was organized by Concerned
Shrimpers of America, whose leaders said they had nothing to do with
the blockade at the Gulf.
   Coast Guard Cmdr. Max Miller said ships were able to navigate
around the blockaders, but officers will order it broken up
nevertheless.
   ``Our boarding teams will go out and board the shrimp boats and
order them to leave the area. Hopefully they will heed the order. If
they don't, they are subject to arrest,'' said Miller.
   Belle Pass, which runs between Port Fouchon and Grand Isle, is
used primarily by shrimpers and oil industry boats, Miller said.
   Elsewhere, officials said early spot checks found that most
shrimpers were using the turtle devides.
   Twelve of 13 shrimp vessels inspected for compliance in federal
waters off the Florida Keys late Thursday and early today had TEDs
in place, according to Gene Proulx, assistant special agent in
charge at the St. Petersburg office of the National Oceanic and
Atmospheric Administration.
   U.S. Coast Guard officials in Texas and Louisiana at midmorning
were still trying to determine whether the normal number of
shrimpers were working.
   ``We didn't have any problems last night and none today,'' said
Chief Robert Cox at the Coast Guard station in Galveston.
   Sydney Herndon, chairman of Gulf King Shrimp Co. in Aransas Pass,
said use of the devises is ``like cutting a big hole in your net.''
   His 48 boats will comply with the law, he said, adding that TEDs
threaten to drive some shrimpers out of business.
   The rule requiring use of TEDs took effect at 12:01 a.m. today,
ending a six-week delay prompted by shrimpers' protests, including
blockades of ship channels in Texas and Louisiana.
   Some shrimpers promised to ignore the rule.
   ``I'll set my boat on fire before I pull a TED,'' said Gary
Duncan, a shrimper from Boothville, La.
   Jackie Taylor, president of Concerned Shrimpers of Alabama, said
the TEDs rule would be ignored.
   ``If nobody pulls TEDs, I'm not going to be the first to pull
them either,'' said Brownsville shrimper Harry Long.
   Jerry Sansom, executive director of Organized Fishermen of
Florida, said Thursday he thought compliance with the TEDs rule
would be better among Florida shrimpers than those in the western
Gulf of Mexico.
   Coast Guard officials said they did not anticipate problems in
their random boardings in which TEDs are not the only thing
inspected.
   ``It's not a very popular regulation with shrimpers, and that's
not a surprise to anyone, but they're aware that it's the law,''
said Lt. Pat Philbin, spokesman for the Coast Guard district
stretching from the Texas-Mexico border to the Florida Panhandle.
   The Commerce Department on Tuesday reinstated the TEDs rule under
a court order to protect the turtles under the Endangered Species
Act.
   Commerce Secretary Robert Mosbacher temporarily blocked the TEDs
requirement after shrimpers along the Gulf Coast blockaded ports
July 22-23 to protest excluder regulations.
   Mosbacher allowed shrimpers instead to limit their trawling times
to 105 minutes, with the idea that most turtles wouldn't drown in
that time _ a method found to be ineffective.
   Failure to use TEDs could result in a maximum $20,000 fine, but
the Commerce Department will phase in its enforcement.
   Vessels cited before Sept. 22 will be able to settle by
purchasing and installing excluders before Oct. 15. From Sept. 22 to
Oct. 15, shrimpers can have penalties reduced if they purchase and
install TEDs within 15 days.
   An estimated 11,000 sea turtles die each year in Gulf Coast
shrimp nets, including the endangered Kemp's ridley, leatherneck and
hawksbill and the threatened loggerhead and green sea turtles.
   Environmental groups hailed the Commerce Department's decision as
a victory for sea turtle conservation.
   The cagelike TEDs fit in the back section of a shrimp trawl. A
grid across the middle allows shrimp to flow through but catches
turtles. Waterflow through the device helps turtles escape via a
trap door.
   Shrimpers say they lose 10 percent to 30 percent of their shrimp
through the TEDs. Commerce officials say side-by-side tests have
shown losses of 2 percent to 5 percent.
   Researchers in Florida reported Thursday they had found five
times more nests than they had expected of threatened loggerhead sea
turtles in a three-state, 200-mile stretch of the northern Gulf
Coast.
   Thomas J. Eley, assistant professor of resource management at the
University of West Florida, said the study supports the use of TEDs.
   Shrimpers in the region had contended it is not an important
nesting area and the TEDs were unnecessary.

<HEAD>U.S. Investment Firm Buys Stake In Saatchi</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Shares in the advertising giant Saatchi and Saatchi
Co. traded slightly lower Friday on the London Stock Exchange, a day
after rising sharply on news that a U.S. investment firm had
acquired 9.4 percent of the company's stock.
   Memphis-based Southeastern Asset Management is now the biggest
shareholder in Saatchi, which has performed poorly the last few
years.
   Southeastern, which manages $2.3 billion in assets for its U.S.
investors, said in a statement the purchase is for investment only
and was ``not being made with a view toward changing or influencing
control of Saatchi.''
   Saatchi shares were off 2 pence to 319 pence Friday compared with
an 11 pence rise Thursday.
   A spokesman at Saatchi said the company knew about Southeastern's
interest but had not known the stake was so high until Thursday when
it was announced.
   Under British investment regulations, share blocks of more than
five percent must be reported to the stock exchange.
   Analysts in the City, London's financial district, said the stake
is almost three times as large as the 3.3 percent held by the
Saatchi brothers, Maurice and Charles, who founded the company.
   ``I was surprised by the size of the chunk,'' said Mark Astaire,
media analyst at Hoare Govett. ``I was not surprised it was an
American institution though, because they have not had the bad
experiences with Saatchi that U.K. firms have had, so they are less
jaundiced.''
   Analysts said Southeastern is buying at the right time since the
outlook for the world's largest advertising group has been expected
to improve since June when Saatchi announced it would sell its
consulting group.
   ``They have been weak because of the quick acquisitions of some
large New York advertising agencies like Ted Bates, Backer
Spielvogel and Dancer Fitzgerald,'' said David Forster, media
analyst at Kleinwort Benson. ``The quick growth has brought slack
financial control.''
   But Forster sees the company's finances improving.
   ``By selling their consulting division they will be able to pay
off their debt and have an improved cash flow,'' Forster said.
   Although Southeastern's announcement rekindled takeover
speculation that accompanied Saatchi's disappointing 1988 profit
figures released last spring, Forster said a hostile takeover is
very unlikely.

<TEXT>
   The government Friday quickly replaced the two top
officials of Italy's largest bank who resigned in a scandal
involving at least $1.7 billion in unauthorized export credits to
Iraq by the bank's branch in Atlanta.
   Treasury Minister Guido Carli appointed Giampiero Cantoni as
chairman of the state-owned Banca Nazionale del Lavoro (BNL) and
Paolo Savona as director-general.
   Cantoni replaces Nerio Nesi and Savona succeeds Giacomo Pedde.
They had stepped down late Thursday at an extraordinary meeting of
the bank's board.
   Cantoni, a Socialist, was serving as chairman of Istituto
Bancario Italiano, a state-controlled commercial bank in Milan.
Savona, a Republican, is an economics professor at the University of
Rome and long-time adviser of Carli.
   The nominations require Parliamentary approval. BNL is 74-percent
owned by the Treasury.
   The resignations came three weeks after the bank announced it had
uncovered transactions by its Atlanta branch that were neither
authorized by the bank's North American management nor its Rome
headquarters.
   The 2,500 transactions, believed to span three years, were
letters of credit covering exports of agricultural products,
industrial machinery and plants to Iraq. The bank has said no arms
shipments were involved.
   The bank said the letters of credit, while correct technically,
exceeded the credit ceiling the Rome office had set for the Atlanta
branch.
   The Treasury said Thursday that based on available information,
BNL apparently hadn't suffered losses of assets as a result of the
transactions.
   However, its statement noted the operations have resulted ``in an
increase in the credit risk thanks to the concentration of
operations toward one particular country.''
   On Thursday, BNL said its auditing of the off-balance sheet
operations at the Atlanta branch showed irregular export credits
totaling $2.64 billion. Of this amount $1.72 billion already has
been disbursed.
   The Atlanta branch has made pledges for the remaining $920
million, but the actual transactions still need to be executed and
BNL said it's trying to determine whether these commitments are
legally binding.
   Meanwhile, Matrix-Churchill Ltd, a British manufacturer of
machine tools with possible military applications, said Friday it
sold equipment to Iraq on credit arranged by BNL.
   Letters of credit issued by the Italian bank were used in an
unspecified portion of the company's $12.4 million in sales to Iraq
last year, Matrix-Churchill spokesman David Phillips said.
   The United States, Italy and Britain all prohibit the export of
lethal weapons and militarily sensitive technology to Iraq.
   Matrix-Churchill, based in Coventry, England and controlled by an
Iraqi-owned holding company, makes computer-controlled lathes used
in the manufacture of a variety of industrial and military equipment.
   Despite their possible military applications, the lathes were
approved for export to Iraq by the U.K. Department of Trade and
Industry, Phillips said.
   A department spokesman declined comment on the case. A source
familiar with the export regulations, however, said machine tools
that aren't exclusively military in application could well have been
approved for export.
   Italian press reports said BNL chairman Nesi had balked at
resigning during a stormy six-hour meeting of the bank's board
Thursday night, and in a resignation letter expressed ``great
bitterness.''

<HEAD>Soybean Futures Rally On Export Talk, Weather</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Soybean futures prices burst through the
$6-a-bushel barrier Friday on the Chicago Board of Trade, buoyed by
rumors of new Soviet interest in buying U.S. soybean meal and rising
fears of a rain-delayed harvest.
   Corn and oat futures also finished higher while wheat futures
were slightly lower.
   Soybeans for September delivery had traded as high as $6 a bushel
Thursday for the first time in nearly two weeks. The market pushed
beyond that psychological barrier late in Friday's session on rumors
that the Soviet Union was considering buying up to 2 million metric
tons of U.S. or South American soybean meal for shipment this fall.
   The soybean and corn markets also were supported by forecasts for
a rainy weekend in the Midwest, where corn and soybean crops are
rapidly maturing.
   The forecasts are feeding fears of corn and soybean harvest
delays and of winter-wheat planting delays.
   Although the crops needed rain earlier in the growing season,
``there's a feeling that too much rain now will be a detriment,''
said Ted Mao, grain specialist with Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. in
New York.
   At the close, wheat futures were \ cent to 2 cents lower with the
contract for delivery in September at $3.95 a bushel; corn was \

<UNK>Key Producers Plan Price Pact Initiative</UNK>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Ivory Coast, Brazil, Ghana and other major
cocoa producers said Friday they plan to ask the International Cocoa
Organization next week to revive a price-support system that would
raise world prices.
   Word of the proposal came at the end of three days of meetings
among representatives of the 13-member Cocoa Producers' Alliance.
   The proposal will be presented to the ICO meeting of cocoa
producers and consumers starting Monday in London.
   The powers of the 41-nation ICO to intervene in the market to
support a minimum price have been paralyzed since February 1988
because of a dispute between its producer and consumer members over
the minimum price a proposed new stockpiling scheme should defend
and a lack of cash to finance it. World cocoa prices have been
depressed by five consecutive years of surplus crops and earlier
this year prices hit a 13-year low. The surplus has hurt the
economies of major cocoa-producing nations such as the Ivory Coast.
On the New York Coffee, Sugar &amp; Cocoa Exchange, the spot price of a
metric ton of cocoa traded this week at $1,077, near the decade low
of $1,048, said exchange economist Vic DeMayo. In 1983, a metric ton
of cocoa sold for $2,800, he said.
   The Ivory Coast, the world's biggest producer whose international
debts total more than $14 billion, is spearheading efforts to revive
the cocoa organization. Cocoa is the source of 30 percent of the
foreign exchange earnings of Ivory Coast and is an even more
important earner for Ghana.
   World production in the 1988-89 season is put at a record 2.4
million tons, thanks to record crops in the Ivory Coast and Malaysia
and a big recovery in Ghana's harvest.
   Traders have put the surplus over consumption at an all-time high
of 300,000 tons, which would lift season-end stocks above one
million tons for the first time ever.
   Introduction of a proposed new stockpiling scheme, under which
producers would receive financial help from the organization to
store up to 120,000 metric tons of surplus beans, has been blocked
by lack of cash and a dispute over the minimum target price.
   The cocoa organization is owed about $115 million by its producer
members, with the Ivory Coast's debt _ $70 million _ the biggest,
followed by Brazil, with $17 million.
   ``I cannot say that we will guarantee to pay all our debts, but
something will be offered on that,'' said one producer.
   Traders said if the pact's control function is revived at next
week's meeting this would boost the chances of a decision to extend
the accord with its regulatory power intact for one or two more
years.
   If there is no extension, the 250,000-ton stockpile already held
by the cocoa organization will have to be liquidated under current
rules within 4 1@2 years from September 1990.
   Delegates said that if next week's talks fail, prices would come
under renewed pressure.

   Gulfstream Aerospace Technologies announced
Friday that it has signed an $85 million contract to manufacture
wings for a new 29-seat British Aerospace aircraft.
   Gulfstream President Robert N. Buckley said the initial contract
calls for Gulfstream, a Chrysler Corp. subsidiary based in Oklahoma,
to manufacture 200 wing seats for the Jetstream 41 to be delivered
over a 10-year period.
   He said production is to begin with five wing sets in 1990 and
will increase to 35 sets by 1994. He said about 80 employees will be
required to start production.
   The Jetstream 41 is the latest addition to British Aerospace's
family of regional commuter airliners.
   The Jetstream 41 wing is the first major assembly contract
awarded to Gulfstream Aerospace Technologies, which employs about
960 in Oklahoma City.
   The plant is primarily engaged in parts subcontrcting for firms
like McDonnell Douglas Corp., Boeing Co. and Rohr Industries Inc.,
as well as for government agencies.

<HEAD>Eastern Pilots Choose New Leader; Eastern Seeks Delay on Filing Plan</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAN SEWELL</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>MIAMI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Eastern Airlines' pilots said Friday they have
chosen ``a gladiator'' to lead them after ousting the union leader
who a month ago suggested they end their strike.
   Skip Copeland, an Eastern captain based in New York, was chosen
by acclamation Friday to take over the union leadership. On
Thursday, the pilots' executive council voted to recall Chairman
Jack Bavis.
   Copeland, a 27-year Eastern veteran and a union activist, is
considered a hard-liner on the strike and far less conciliatory than
Bavis.
   ``It was meant to be a positive move,'' said Raymond Wright, the
Eastern pilots union's vice chairman. ``It's been a long, hard and
tedious fight. With a new guy, you can have vim and vigor.
   ``I believe the body is under the clear impression that over the
next few weeks we're on a backstretch,'' Wright said by telephone
from Washington, where the executive council met. ``They wanted a
gladiator, a hard-charger.''
   Eastern, meanwhile, asked the U.S. Bankruptcy Court to extend by
60 days the Sept. 15 deadline for Eastern to file a disclosure
statement for its bankruptcy reorganization plan. The disclosure
statement will contain details on Eastern's financial position,
including 5-year projections, the company said Friday.
   Miami-based Eastern has been under Chapter 11 bankruptcy
protection since March 9, five days after the start of the strike by
pilots, Machinists and flight attendants. The airline filed a
proposed reorganization plan on July 21. The disclosure statement
will describe how Eastern intends to emerge from bankruptcy.
   The rank-and-file pilots' sentiment turned against Bavis after he
proposed Aug. 6 that they consider ending the strike. Local chapter
straw votes showed overwhelming opposition to halting the strike,
now in its seventh month.
   Bavis, an Eastern pilot since 1966 and official for years with
the national Air Line Pilots Association, became the Eastern pilots
union leader in 1986.
   Bavis didn't immediately return telephone messages left at his
Virginia home.
   Eastern Machinists union leader Charles Bryan declined comment,
saying he didn't want to discuss another union's internal politics.
Bryan and Bavis had been on cool terms for years.
   Earlier, pilots union and management officials said they have
scheduled negotiations for Monday, their first talks in six weeks.
   The pilots requested the talks before the National Mediation
Board in June, while the airline made a similar request in July.
Pilots union officials believe the company is trying to rush through
the federally mandated bargaining process so it can put aside the
pilots' contract.
   Jack Mogus of the Eastern pilots' executive council said the
talks in Washington, D.C., will probably end in an impasse and that
Eastern will ask the National Mediation Board to set a 30-day
cooling-off period, after which Eastern could impose its own
conditions on pilots who have crossed picket lines.
   The pilots who crossed picket lines are still covered by the ALPA
contract with Eastern.
   But Eastern spokesman Robin Matell said, ``We look at this as an
opportunity to resolve our differences with the pilots union.''
   Eastern previously dropped an attempt to have the pilots'
contract terminated in bankruptcy court.
   More than 300 pilots crossed picket lines in the week after Bavis
and other union officials urged ending the strike. Other local union
officials have been replaced since then.
   The pilots union, along with the Machinists and flight
attendants, says Eastern's management is dismantling the airline and
a change in ownership is needed.
   Eastern is trying to rebuild without its unions. More than 650 of
3,600 ALPA pilots at Eastern have crossed picket lines since the
strike began, joining some 1,000 newly hired pilots. Eastern
recently announced it had stopped hiring new pilots.
   Eastern on Thursday boosted its daily schedule to 601 flights and
reported a 75.4 percent average load factor for August.
   Company spokeswoman Karen Ceremsak said the load factor was a
record for Eastern in the month of August. She said percentage of
capacity filled for August 1988 flights was 68.2 percent.
   Eastern had nearly 1,100 daily flights before the strike. Eastern
added about 200 flights Thursday, as announced earlier, with most
additional flights out of the Atlanta hub that has been the focus of
Eastern's rebuilding efforts.
   Eastern says it will be up to 700 daily flights on Oct. 1 and 800
flights by year's end, when it hopes to emerge from bankruptcy at
two-thirds its pre-strike size.

<HEAD>Executives Say Fast Food Chain in `Crisis'</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARC RICE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Three senior executives of Arby's Inc. said Friday
the fast food chain is in a crisis and called on the company's owner
and its new president to restore stability while dealing with a
hostile buyout bid by a franchisee group.
   The statement by the executives came three days after President
Len Roberts was fired in a clash with Miami financier Victor Posner,
the chain's principal owner, over Posner's refusal to consider the
$200 million buyout offer.
   Posner on Wednesday hired Manhattan restaurant baron Irving Riese
to succeed Roberts, who enjoyed great popularity among the chain's
franchisees.
   Riese's appointment drew fire immediately from the AFA Service
Corp., an organization owned by Arby's 500 franchisees that holds
marketing and advertising rights to the company trademark.
   ``We have a franchise system, or several major franchisees, in
revolt. And we need to get back a stable business climate,'' said
Russ Cooper, the chain's executive vice president for franchising
and development.
   ``We are asking our new president and owner to establish that as
soon as possible,'' Cooper said by telephone from Arby's
headquarters in Atlanta.
   Cooper joined Frank Belatti, executive vice president for
marketing, and Kam Nassar, executive vice president for finance and
administration, in issuing a statement Friday pledging to employees
and franchisees that they will ``ultimately resolve the current
crisis.''
   ``After speaking with Mr. Riese, the AFA board and many groups of
employees, it is clear _ everyone is very much interested in helping
to keep this great company moving forward, despite the differences
which existed,'' the statement said.
   Cooper said the company's problems have resulted in a
``questionable investment climate'' that could hurt the company's
growth.
   Meanwhile, Posner released a letter to franchisees maintaining he
would not sell the company, which he acquired in 1984 as part of
Chesapeake Financial Corp.'s $400 million purchase of Royal Crown
Companies Inc. Posner controls DWG Corp., which owns 60 percent of
Chesapeake.
   The 2,100-restaurant chain had total revenue of $153.8 million
and an operating profit of $20.7 million last year.
   R.B. Partners Ltd., a group of franchisees operating more than
500 Arby's restaurants, wants to buy out the chain, contending that
Posner's legal and financial difficulties threaten the company's
future.
   Posner pleaded no contest two years ago to federal income tax
invasion and was sentenced to five years probation on the condition
that he pay all his back taxes, penalties, interest and court costs.
He also was ordered to create a $3 million fund for the homeless.
   A spokesman in New York for R.B. Partners said Friday the group
is continuing its effort to gain control of Arby's.
   ``Victor Posner's statement has to be taken in view of his past
actions,'' said the spokesman, who asked that he not be identified.
``We would assume he would naturally try to mollify the franchisees
and then go about a divide-and-conquer strategy.''
   Cooper, Belatti and Nasser signed a statement with Roberts
earlier this week that was critical of Posner's response to the R.B.
Partners offer. That statement preceded the firing of Roberts.
   Asked if their differences with Posner had been ironed out,
Cooper said, ``We've all been asked to stay. We said we won't
abandon the franchisees or the employees.''

   Ski industry businesses have joined forces
for the first time to promote the sport among the estimated 35
million Americans who like the outdoors but never have donned skis.
   The campaign will include network television advertisements and
efforts by the country's 450 ski areas to make skiing a more
comfortable experience, from squeezing on boots to swishing down the
bunny hill.
   ``For every 100 people who learn to ski there's probably a pretty
high percentage, probably at least a third, who never return. Maybe
it's as high as 50 percent. Now why aren't they returning?'' said
Bill Stenger, general manager of Jay Peak ski area in Vermont and
chairman of the national campaign task force.
   The anxiety some beginners feel when staring up a ski slope may
be one reason for the dropout rate. So is money.
   The average daily expense for an out-of-state skier in Vermont,
for example, including a lift ticket, food, lodging and equipment
rental, averaged almost $70 a day this past season, a state survey
shows.
   Ski gear can cost hundreds of dollars _ a pair of skis can easily
exceed $500 _ and lessons can range from about $25 an hour for a
group class to about $45 for individual instruction in many areas.
   But industry officials are hoping to help would-be skiers
overcome their reluctance by presenting skiing as fun and more
affordable than they might think.
   ``It's an image campaign designed to show skiing is for families,
individuals, for young, for old, full of fun and enthusiasm, that
people should give it a try,'' Stenger said.
   The `Ski It To Believe It' campaign is sponsored by the National
Ski Areas Association, which represents 450 ski areas in the U.S.
and Canada, and Ski Industries America, which represents 600
manufacturers and distributors of skiwear, skis, bindings, boots,
poles and ski accessories.
   The groups plan to merge, creating one large organization called
the United Ski Industries Association.
   The campaign was inspired partly by the golf industry, which
estimates 400 new courses will have to be built each year for the
next 10 years to meet growing demand. That industry contracted with
McKinsey &amp; Co., a New York management consulting firm, to prepare a
long-term plan for such growth.
   The ski industry has enough facilities; it just wants more
customers. Figures compiled by the NSAA show the number of skier
visits has grown less than 6 percent over 10 seasons to about 53.34
million this past year. One skier visit represents one person
visiting a ski area for any part of a day.
   ``Golf is on a tremendous roll, and there's no reason skiing
shouldn't be,'' Stenger said.
   The ski industry also used McKinsey to determine the potential
market.
   ``They defined an estimated 35 million people whose lifestyles
matched up to current skiers,'' said Kathe Dillmann of the
Springfield, Mass.-based NSAA. ``So our target is this 35 million
Americans who should have some propensity for skiing. If they're
active and like the outdoor arena, we think they should consider
skiing, and we just haven't approached them correctly.''
   The campaign, a first for the industry, began in September with
some preliminary promotion. The TV ad will air on the major networks
Nov. 2-22 and Jan. 8-28 at a cost of $5.5 million.
   Shot last year at Vail, Colo., it will feature ski scenes and a
theme song.
   ``It shows moderate skiers and good action shots and
learn-to-skiers. There are some high mountains but not many. Mostly
it's just close-ups of a lot of fun-looking, average people having a
good time,'' Dillmann said.
   Another $1.5 million will be spent on print and radio ads, as
well as public relations and special promotions. The campaign also
may include newspaper ads to promote a national learn-to-ski day on
Jan. 19, when beginners can rent equipment, take lessons and ski for
free at participating areas.
   Ski businesses have been asked to give a percentage of last
year's sales to finance the campaign. Dillman said most of the money
has been raised.
   State ski associations will pick up the ball with local campaigns
tailored to their areas. At the same time, ski areas will try to
make the ski experience less frightening for the newcomer.
   ``If we are successful in getting the attention of the 25 to 30
million Americans who have the potential to ski, we're going to have
to be more sensitive in our rental shops, our ski school,'' Stenger
said.
   ``All resorts are looking very hard to make sure they're making
it less confusing, easy, fun for a person to reach what I call the
comfort zone of skiing, where they know where they are and are not
confused,'' said Bobby Foster, director of marketing for the
Waterville Valley slope in New Hampshire's White Mountains.
   Stenger said the ski areas in North America still have room for
more participants, especially if skiers try some of the less popular
resorts.
   ``In Vermont, if you get outside the top few resorts, there's
lots of availability in terms of space, except for Christmas week,''
he said. ``I would hope that with increased volume we would be able
to see rates stabilizing. That's a double-edged sword for me because
I know that price is one of the major deterrents to people skiing,
and we need to find ways of making skiing affordable. We hope
stabilized rates are a part of that.''

   About 300 Jeep workers will be temporarily
laid off when Chrysler Corp. suspends production of the Grand
Wagoneer's 1990 model for four weeks because of slumping sales.
   Sales of the 1989 Grand Wagoneer are off 15 percent from a year
ago and Jeep dealers still have a three-month supply of the vehicle
in stock, Douglas Nicholl, a spokesman for Chrysler Corp., Jeep's
parent, said Thursday.
   As of Aug 30, sales totaled 11,387, compared with 13,442 for the
corresponding period a year ago.
   Employees who make Grand Wagoneers at the Jeep assembly plant in
Toledo will begin a two-week furlough on Monday, return for a week
to work starting Sept. 25, then be laid off for two more weeks
beginning Oct. 2.
   The temporary shutdown comes after a two-week furlough in the
last two weeks of August, also because of slow Grand Wagoneer sales.
   The 1990 Grand Wagoneer, which sells for $25,000, is Jeep's most
expensive model. Jeep is a division of Chrysler Corp.

   The stock market managed a small advance Friday
in the final session of its first losing week since late June.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials rose 2.66 to 2,709.54,
reducing its loss for the week to 42.55 points.
   That ended a string of nine weeks in which the average put
together consecutive gains totaling 312.03 points.
   Advancing issues outnumbered declines by about 10 to 9 in the
daily tally of nationwide trading in New York Stock Exchange-listed
stocks, with 746 up, 685 down and 552 unchanged.
   Volume on the floor of the Big Board came to 154.09 million
shares, down from 160.16 million in the previous session.
Nationwide, consolidated volume in NYSE-listed issues, including
trades in those stocks on regional exchanges and in the
over-the-counter market, totaled 182.61 million shares.
   Analysts said traders' spirits got a small lift from declines in
open-market interest rates. Prices of long-term government bonds,
which move in the opposite direction from interest rates, rose about
$5 for each $1,000 in face value.
   But doubts persisted about the chances for any concerted move in
the near future by the Federal Reserve to relax its credit policy
further.
   That view, in turn, has reinforced suspicions among many market

   F.W. Woolworth made the biggest contribution to the Dow's gain,

   The dollar on Friday approached the peaks reached
in its June rally as a comment by a Swiss national banker gave fresh
confidence to bullish dealers in a thin market.
   Gold edged down.
   Jean Zwahlen, a member of the Swiss National Bank's governing
board, was quoted as saying that the dollar is likely to rise in the
immediate future based on the strength of the U.S. economy.
   Zwahlen also was quoted as saying that the ability of central
banks to restrain the dollar's rise depends on the strength of
market sentiment toward the U.S. currency.
   The dollar was given another boost by a rumor, later denied by
the Soviet embassy in Washington, that Soviet President Mikhail
Gorbachev had died, said Lynn Tierney, a vice president at Shawmut
Bank of Boston.
   Trading was light to moderate, so price movements were
exaggerated, said Jack Adkins, a currency analyst at Refco Group
Ltd. in Chicago.
   ``It didn't take a whole lot to get things going,'' Adkins said.
   In Tokyo, where trading ends before Europe's business day begins,
the dollar fell to 146.62 yen from 146.87 yen late Thursday. Later,
in London, it was quoted at a lower rate of 146.45 yen. In New York
the dollar moved up to 147.20 yen from 146.65 on Thursday.
   In London, the dollar fell against the British pound. It cost
$1.5505 to buy one pound, more expensive than $1.5460 late Thursday.
In New York, the dollar gained ground as the pound fell to $1.5380
from $1.5520.
   Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late rates
Thursday, included: 1.9950 West German marks, up from 1.9798; 1.7245
Swiss francs, up from 1.7075; 1.1875 Canadian dollars, up from
1.1859; 6.7195 French francs, up from 6.6680; and 1,493 Italian
lire, up from 1,419.3.
   In June the dollar got as high as 159 yen and 2.02 marks, levels
not seen in roughly two years.
   Other late dollar rates in Europe, compared with late rates
Thursday, included: 1.9795 West German marks, down from 1.9845;
1.7080 Swiss francs, down from 1.7120; 6.6710 French francs, down
from 6.6880; 2.2320 Dutch guilders, down from 2.2423; 1,421.70
Italian lire, down from 1,426.20; and 1.1877 Canadian dollars, up
from 1.1842.
   Gold rose in London to a late bid of $360.00 a troy ounce,
compared with late Thursday's $359.50. In Zurich, gold rose to
$360.00 an ounce compared with $359.75 late Thursday.
   Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold rose 54 cents to close at a $360.25
an ounce.
   On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold bullion for current
delivery fell to $359.40 a troy ounce from $360.20. Later, Republic
National Bank of New York fell to $358.75 from $359.70.
   Silver bullion prices rose in London to $5.12 a troy ounce,
compared with $5.11 late Thursday. On New York's Comex, silver
bullion for current delivery fell to $5.053 an ounce from $5.117.

   Avon Products Inc. disclosed on Friday it may
sell its Giorgio Beverly Hills and Parfums Stern fragrance
businesses, suppliers of some of the country's hottest selling
scents.
   No final decision on whether to divest the subsidiaries has been
reached, said James E. Preston, the big cosmetic company's chairman
and chief executive officer. But Avon has hired the investment
banking firm Morgan Stanley &amp; Co. to help it explore the possibility
of a sale and evaluate alternatives.
   Proceeds from a possible sale would go toward reducing Avon's
debt, which at mid-year totaled about $1 billion, Preston said in a
statement.
   Giorgio and Stern, acquired by Avon in 1987 for a total of about
$345 million, comprise the big beauty products company's retail
division. The division sells fragrances at department store counters
and through other retail vendors instead of through Avon sales
representatives.
   In the first half of this year, Giorgio and Stern contributed
four of the 10 best selling fragrances in the United States: Giorgio
Beverly Hills, Red, Oscar de la Renta, and Uninhibited by Cher,
according to Avon.
   Avon estimates that sales of its retail fragrance companies will
exceed $300 million this year, which would be less than 10 percent
of Avon's total revenue. Giorgio has about 280 employees and is
based in Santa Monica, Calif. and New York-based Stern has about 480
employees.
   Selling its retail fragrance business has long been seen as one
of several things Avon could do in its effort to enhance
profitability.
   As one element in that strategy, the company has been in the
process of selling off its health care services businesses to
concentrate on its core beauty and personal care direct-selling
operation.
   In the second quarter, Avon earned $39.5 million on sales of $778
million compared with a loss of $82.5 million and sales of $704
million a year earlier.
   Avon, the world's biggest direct sales company, was motivated to
speed up its financial turnaround earlier this year when it received
unwanted attention from several suitors.
   The most recent pursuer was Minneapolis-based investor Irwin L.
Jacobs. On Aug. 3, Avon's board rejected Jacobs' proposed
$41-a-share, or $2.85 billion, bid.
   Earlier, in May, Avon had doled out a rejection to direct-sales
rival Amway Corp., which had offered $2.1 billion. Avon also brushed
off tentative advances from Mary Kay Corp., parent of the
door-to-door cosmetics company.
   Both Jacobs and Amway had said that if they prevailed in
acquiring Avon, they would sell off Avon's retail fragrance
operations.
   Jacobs, who holds about a 10 percent stake in Avon, met with
Preston in August and after the meeting Avon said the two discussed
business plans.
   Andrew Shore, an analyst at Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc., said
Jacobs' interest in Avon probably helped persuade the company to
seriously consider selling its retail perfume lines to bolster its
balance sheet.
   ``I wouldn't be surprised if this was a decision that was helped
by Mr. Jacobs' and Mr. Preston's meeting a few weeks ago,'' said
Shore.
   Analysts said selling the holdings would be a smart move for
Avon. The announcement failed to spark enthusiasm in the stock
market, however. Avon closed unchanged at $36.25 on the New York
Stock Exchange.
   Jack L. Salzman, analyst at Goldman Sachs &amp; Co., said: ``I think
it's a positive'' move for Avon.
   Wall Street estimates of how much Avon might hope to get for
Giorgio and Stern ranged from $350 million to more than $450 million.
   One analyst said it would be reasonable for a buyer to pay 50
percent above this year's projected sales of $300 million for the
subsidiaries, meaning the price of Giorgio and Stern would be at
least $450 million.
   Names mentioned as potential buyers included Unilever, the
British-Dutch consumer products giant, and Shiseido Cosmetics
America Ltd., the U.S. arm of the big Japanese beauty and personal
products company.
   Unilever, which over the summer completed the acquisition of the
Faberge and Elizabeth Arden fragrance, toiletries and cosmetics
lines for $1.55 billion, is known to be interested in building its
presence in the prestige end of the perfume business.
   Avon's chief Preston said in an interview in the spring that
several parties had approached him expressing interest in buying
Giorgio and Stern. On Friday, an Avon spokesman refused to comment
on who might be interested.

   White-collar swindlers with organized crime
connections defrauded dozens of thrift institutions and fueled the
multibillion-dollar savings and loan crisis, the authors of a new
book on the collapse said Friday.
   ``Inside Job'' raises new allegations of mob involvement in S&amp;L
fraud in the 1980s and accuses key politicans and federal regulators
of stonewalling closer examination of thrifts to protect personal
perks.
   Blaming 1982 federal deregulation that allowed thrifts to broaden
activities from home loans to real estate development and other
risky ventures, the book says fraud and not economic problems such
as the Texas oil bust were at the root of the crisis.
   ``Deregulation was the best thing to happen to the mob since
Prohibition,'' said book co-author Stephen Pizzo, a reporter for
National Thrift News. ``They were watching this right from the
start.''
   He added: ``You take fraud out of the equation and there probably
would have been no savings and loan crisis.''
   The book cites S&amp;L frauds with links to the five big New York mob
families _Gambino, Genovese, Lucchese, Bonnano and Colombo _ as well
as the Civella family in Kansas City, Peter Milano gang in Los
Angeles and Carlos Marcello in New Orleans.
   Pizzo estimated that organized crime figures were involved in
about 20 percent of savings and loan frauds since 1982.
   ``The thrift mess cannot be described as primarily related to
organized crime,'' said Rep. Jim Leach, R-Iowa, a House Banking
Committee member who has read the book. ``Yet the organized crime
element is real and has to date been badly underestimated.''
   The government has taken over close to 500 thrifts in the last
two years. The 10-year cost of bailing out ailing thrifts is $159
billion under legislation signed last month by President Bush.
   ``Inside Job'' also names Las Vegas casino owners, thrift deposit
brokers and a former mob stockbroker who received a new name after
testifying against other organized crime figures but re-emerged as a
major S&amp;L swindler.
   ``The evidence was overwhelming that the Mafia was actively
looting S&amp;Ls _ in various widely disparate locations, at the same
time, in the same ways, often using the same people,'' the authors
write.
   The book, to be published by McGraw-Hill this month, was written
by Pizzo, National Thrift News reporter Paul Muolo and Mary Fricker,
an editorial writer for the Santa Rosa (Calif.) Press Democrat.
   Among its other charges:
   _Federal Home Loan Bank Board regulators repeatedly failed to
contact the Justice Department about possibly starting criminal
investigations of frauds and then refused to share information on
S&amp;L frauds. It also says that federal officials repeatedly denied
knowing of any mob connections to S&amp;L frauds.
   _Top FHLBB officials delayed implementing supervision for some
thrifts that eventually collapsed.
   _Political intervention by several congressmen and senators who
had received donations from thrift executives ``significantly slowed
down regulatory response to this looting.''
   William Fulwider, a spokesman for the Treasury Department's
Office of Thrift Supervision, which replaced the bank board, said:
``They're not the first and probably won't be the last to criticize
what we've done here.''
   ``The staff made what it felt were the best decisions for the
industry and (the Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corp.) and the
board acted accordingly,'' he said. ``I think there's an awful lot
of trying to find a simple answer to all the problems of the thrift
industry.''
   The authors said their investigation began three years ago after
Pizzo uncovered names of mob-related figures in the collapse of
Centennial Savings &amp; Loan of Santa Rosa. Officials there have been
indicted for money laundering.
   ``This looting of savings and loans was done by a network of
people who knew each other,'' Fricker said. ``It's not just
something that happened in individual towns around the country.''

<HEAD>Soybean Futures Extend Rally On Talk Of Soviet Meal Demand</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID DISHNEAU</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Soybean futures prices staged a strong rally Friday, bursting
through the $6-a-bushel barrier on the Chicago Board of Trade amid
rumors of Soviet demand for soybean meal and rising fears of a
rain-delayed harvest.
   On other markets, coffee and energy futures rose while livestock,
meat and precious metals retreated.
   Soybean futures settled 1\ cents to 10} cents higher with the
contract for delivery in September at $6.07{ a bushel, the highest
settlement for a near-month soybean contract since Aug. 21.
   Wheat futures settled } cent to 1{ cents lower with September at
$3.95{ a bushel; corn was \ cent to 3 cents higher with September at
$2.39{ a bushel; oats were 1 cent to 1} cents higher with September
at $1.38 a bushel.
   September soybeans had bumped into strong resistance at $6 a
bushel Thursday but pushed beyond that psychological barrier late in
Friday's session on rumors that the Soviet Union was looking to buy
up to 2 million metric tons of U.S. or South American soybean meal
for shipment this fall.
   Soybean meal futures also rose sharply, with the Sepember
contract settling $4.40 higher at $202.80 a ton.
   The soybean and corn markets were further supported by forecasts
for a rainy weekend in the Midwest, where corn and soybean crops are
rapidly maturing.
   The crops needed rain earlier in the growing season buy ``there's
a feeling that too much rain now will be a detriment,'' slowing the
corn and soybean harvests and delaying the planting of winter wheat,
said Ted Mao, grain specialist with Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. in
New York.
   The soybean market got a boost earlier in the week from a sale of
200,000 metric tons of soybeans to unknown destinations _ possibly
the Soviet Union, China or Japan _ and a government grant of 150,000
metric tons of soybean oil to Pakistan.
   Coffee futures rallied for the third straight day on speculation
that the United States may support Colombia's call for a return to
coffee export quotas among producer members of the International
Coffee Organization.
   The 74-nation cartel abandoned quotas July 3, partly due to U.S.
complaints that the quota allocations unreasonably limited the
availability of high-quality coffee to consumer members of the
cartel.
   Coffee futures settled 1.87 cents to 2.5 cents higher on New
York's Coffee, Sugar &amp; Cocoa Exchange, with September at 88.25 cents
a pound.
   Energy futures prices rose on the New York Mercantile Exchange,
paced by refined products in a technically inspired rally.
   West Texas Intermediate crude oil settled 12 cents to 34 cents
higher with October at $19.75 a barrel; heating oil was .84 cent to
1.24 cents higher with October at 56.74 cents a gallon; and unleaded
gasoline was .05 cent to 1.57 cents higher with October at 57.09
cents a gallon.
   On the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, livestock and meat futures
prices fell sharply after two days of gains linked to hopes that the
United States will send some of its surplus pork bellies to Poland
as part of a food aid package.
   Live cattle finished .05 cent to .90 cent lower with October at
71.87 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .10 cent to .60 cent lower
with September at 82.17 cents a pound; hogs were .15 cent to .75
cent lower with October at 39.17 cents a pound; and frozen pork
bellies were .92 cent to 1.30 cents lower with February at 45.90
cents a pound.
   Gold and silver futures prices fell on New York's Commodity
Exchange in reaction to the stronger dollar.
   Gold settled $1 lower across the board with October at $361.30 a
troy ounce; silver was 6.4 cents to 7.4 cents lower with September
at $5.053 a troy ounce.

   Energy futures prices rose sharply in brisk
trading Friday supported by internal market influences and reports
suggesting demand for oil is strong.
   Crude prices, which got a lift from strength in the gasoline
market, broke through what analysts said was a key technical barrier
of $19.50.
   On the New York Mercantile Exchange, the October contract for
West Texas Intermediate, the benchmark grade of U.S. crude oil,
jumped 34 cents to close at $19.75 a barrel after rising 13 cents in
the previous session.
   Wholesale unleaded gasoline for October delivery gained 1.46
cents a gallon to finish at 57.09 cents a gallon, while heating oil
for delivery next month advanced 1.24 cents to 56.74 cents a gallon.
   Analysts attributed much of the buying activity to technical
factors. But some activity in the crude pits stemmed from price
fundamentals, they said.
   ``People are buying crude because it's underpriced in relation to
gasoline,'' said James Steel, an analyst with Refco Inc., ``so
refiners will keep buying in order to turn it into gasoline at a
profit.''
   Reports this week from the American Petroleum Institute and the
Department of Energy on weekly inventories continued to be bullish
for the oil market because they suggested that demand remains
strong, said Madison Galbraith, senior energy specialist with
Merrill Lynch Energy Futures.
   The API reported a 5.8 million-barrel reduction in gasoline
stocks and a 1.5 million-barrel drawdown in crude stocks. The drop
in gasoline inventories was larger than the market had expected
while the crude figure was in line with projections.
   ``The market is being driven by good fundamental support,''
Galbraith said. ``Demand is better than anyone expected and crude
has broken through a key $19.50 barrier.''
   Energy brokers said rumors also added some spark to Friday's
market, including unsubstantiated reports of problems at some U.S.
refineries.
   Gasoline futures benefited earlier this week from concerns about
possible tightening in supplies after a fire at Shell Oil Co.'s
Martinez, Calif. refinery and one at Ashland Petroleum Co.'s
refinery in St. Paul Park, Minn.
   An unfounded rumor circulated in the financial and oil markets
that Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev had died. But analysts said
that had nothing to to with a late surge in oil futures prices. The
rumor was denied by the White House and Soviet Embassy in Washington.
   ``We heard that rumor but did not see any of our clients buy
based on that rumor,'' said Larry Lawrence, manager of options and
technical analysis for Elders Futures Inc. ``This was not a big news
day and people did not expect the strength in prices so people are
stretching for reasons.''

   PPG Industries said Friday it will close plants
in Lincoln, Ill., and Marshall, Minn., due to a decrease in demand
for the glass insulation products made there.
   Production of a new generation of glass-edge insulation units was
suspended in August because of slumping sales, the company said.
   Insulating units for residential windows were produced by PPG at
Lincoln since 1953 and at Marshall since 1975, the company said.
   Production will cease at the Lincoln plant, which employed about
180 people in 1988, in the next two weeks, the company said. The
plant will be shut down by the end of the year.
   Ninety-four employees already have been laid off at the Marshall
plant, and most of the remaining 74 workers will be laid off when
production ceases by mid-October, the company said. The plant should
be shut down by early 1990.

   Bond prices rose in quiet trading Friday, tipped
higher by economic statistics that were seen as an indication of a
possible economic slowdown.
   The Treasury's benchmark 30-year bond rose ] point, or $3.75 for
every $1,000 in face value. Its yield, which falls when the price
rises, dropped to 8.08 percent from 8.10 percent late Thursday.
   Bond prices were supported by consumer installment credit figures
released Friday, said Kevin Flanagan, a money-market economist at
Dean Witter Reynolds Inc.
   Americans paid off $280 million more in credit than they borrowed
during July, the first reduction in consumer debt in 2{ years, the
Federal Reserve Board said.
   Despite a general economic slowdown due to Fed efforts to stem
inflation, consumer spending _ which accounts for two-thirds of
economic activity _ has continued at a relatively fast pace. A
reduction in credit could indicate that consumers are slowing their
spending pace.
   The credit markets were slow all week and little change is
expected until late next week, when the government releases data on
retail sales, inflation and merchandise trade.
   In the secondary market for Treasury bonds, prices of short-term
governments were up as much as [ point, intermediate maturities
gained about \ point and long-term issues were up from \ point to {
point, according to Telerate Inc., the financial information service.
   The movement of a point is equivalent to a change of $10 in the
price of a bond with a $1,000 face value.
   The Shearson Lehman Hutton Daily Treasury Bond Index, which
measures price movements on all outstanding Treasury issues with
maturities of a year or longer, rose 2.70 to 1,179.63.
   Moody's Investment Grade Corporate Bond Index, which measures
total return on a portfolio of 80 corporate bonds with maturities of
five years or longer, fell 0.01 to 329.26.
   In the tax-exempt market, the Bond Buyer index of 40 actively
traded municipal bonds was unchanged. The average yield to maturity
was unchanged at 7.33 percent.
   Yields on three-month Treasury bills fell to 8.01 percent as the
discount lost 3 basis points to 7.76 percent. Yields on six-month
bills slipped to 8.19 percent as the discount declined 2 basis
points to 7.77 percent. Yields on one-year bills fell to 8.17
percent as the discount fell 6 basis points to 7.61 percent.
   A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point. The yield
is the annualized return on an investment in a Treasury bill. The
discount is the percentage that bills are selling below the face
value, which is paid at maturity.
   The federal funds rate, the interest on overnight loans between
banks, was quoted at 8 15-16 percent, unchanged from late Thursday.

Friday.
   The Mortgage Bankers Association of America, which surveyed 30 of
the nation's largest mortgage bankers, said all but one firm

   The median rise in refinancing was 25 percent from early June to

   The mortgage bankers said the lenders in their survey make loans

   Vitro S.A. extended its $280 million takeover
bid for Anchor Glass Container Corp. Friday, but the Tampa glass
maker said it still recommends that stockholders reject the $20 per
share tender offer.
   Anchor also said in a statment that it was involved in
preliminary discussions with ``a number of third parties interested
in a possible transaction with the company.''
   Vitro extended its offer until 5 p.m. EDT Sept. 14. The previous
deadline was 12:01 a.m. Friday.
   Vitro made the takeover offer Aug. 9 for Anchor, one of the
nation's leading bottle makers. It was one of the first unsolicited
bids by a Mexican company for a major U.S. manufacturer.
   Anchor's board of directors asked shareholders Aug. 22 not to
sell stock to Vitro and repeated its recommendation Friday after
Vitro pushed back the deadline.
   Anchor also announced prices for returnable beverage bottles and
liquor bottles will be hiked by 8 percent Oct. 1. The company is
increasing consumer glassware items by 6 percent.
   Anchor attributed the increase to accumulated cost increases not
covered by previous price hikes and for productivity improvement
programs.

<TEXT>
   An Illinois publishing chain has bought two
weekly newspapers in Mississippi, the Kosciusko Star-Herald and the
Pontotoc Progress.
   American Publishing Co. of West Frankfort, Ill., bought the
newspaper for an undisclosed price, the weeklies' owner, W.C.
Shoemaker of Kosciusko, said Thursday.
   Ricki Williams, administrative assistant to American's president,
L.J. Perrotto, said the papers would retain editorial independence,
their staffs would remain in place and the current editors would
become publishers.
   The Kosciusko newspaper has a circulation of about 9,000, while
the Pontotoc newspaper reaches about 7,500 readers.
   The acquisitions bring to 174 the number of newspapers owned by
the Illinois chain, Williams said.

   Campeau Corp., the debt-laden Canadian developer
and owner of numerous retail businesses, Friday proposed a major
financial overhaul that includes the sale of Bloomingdale's, one of
the best known store chains.
   Bloomingdale's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Marvin S.
Traub said he is in the preliminary stages of putting together a
buyout proposal.
   Wall Street analysts said Campeau's willingness to part with
Bloomingdale's underscored the severity of the financial
difficulties facing the company.
   The decision to sell Bloomingdale's also was viewed as a bitter
irony for Campeau Chairman Robert Campeau who about 18 months ago
gained control of Bloomingdale's parent, Federated Department Stores
Inc., after a prolonged takeover battle that included skirmishes
with retailer R.H. Macy &amp; Co. Inc.
   Bloomingdale's, a unit of Federated, was widely assumed to be the
top prize that Campeau sought. The $6.7 billion Campeau paid for
Federated left the company deeply in debt and hobbled it
financially, analysts say.
   In announcing the restructuring proposal Friday, Campeau said the
plan was designed to ``begin the process of significantly reducing
the company's indebtedness and addressing certain of the company's
working capital needs.''
   The plan will be brought before Campeau's board of directors at a
meeting Sept. 12 at the company's Toronto headquarters.
   Among elements of the plan the board will consider is a possible
infusion of funds from Toronto-based Olympia &amp; York Developments
Ltd., which currently holds an 11.8 percent stake in Campeau.
   Olympia &amp; York has discussed lending $250 million to Campeau to
meet cash needs at Federated and Campeau's Allied Stores Corp.
division, Campeau said.
   The investment banking firm First Boston Corp. has been hired to
seek possible buyers for Bloomingdale's, Campeau said.
   Bloomingdale's chief Traub is interested in a buyout of the
well-known chain he has headed since 1978. He said in an interview
Friday that he began making arrangements with merchant bankers and
lawyers after discussing the idea with Robert Campeau and other
Campeau executives at a dinner meeting in London about a week and a
half ago.
   ``It's in the early stages,'' said Traub, adding that a change in
Bloomingdale's ownership isn't likely to occur before the end of
this year.
   Traub, highly regarded in retail circles for his merchandising
expertise, helped give Bloomingdale's a special cachet that has
turned it into a prized property.
   This value was cited as a reason why Campeau chose to put it on
the block.
   ``As a highly valued franchise that promises to yield significant
proceeds, Bloomingdale's offers the best opportunity to most
effectively reduce the company's leverage with a single
transaction,'' Federated said.
   Walter Loeb, an analyst with Morgan Stanley &amp; Co. Inc., said:
``Obviously they're trying to expeditiously sell one of the assets.
Bloomingdale's is the most saleable.''
   ``Bloomingdale's would be the last thing he (Robert Campeau)
would want to sell,'' said Loeb, ``but he's selling it first because
he no longer has the kind of options'' he was expected to have.
   David Poneman, an analyst with Sanford C. Bernstein &amp; Co., said
selling Bloomingdale's isn't surprising because it fits into a
pattern Campeau has followed.
   The company divested two premier properties that, like
Bloomingdale's, had attractive intangible features, making them more
valuable that they would be just judging by their cash flows, said
Poneman. The two were Brooks Brothers and Ann Taylor clothing chains.
   Some analysts had speculated that Campeau eventually might run
into trouble trying to cope with the debt it accumulated in taking
over Federated and Allied. Campeau bought Allied in December 1986
for $3.4 billion.
   Moving to counter the criticism in January, Campeau took out
prominent advertisements saying ``Nothing Succeeds Like Success''
and touting the company's achievements. ``Because we have achieved
so much in this last year, it has been difficult for some to track
and monitor our progress,'' the ad said.
   In late April, Campeau announced a corporate realignment and the
replacement of several executives. At the time, retail analysts
described the changes as housekeeping matters and said Campeau
seemed to be coping with the debts accumulated over the past few
years.
   But, in an intensely competitive retail environment, Campeau's
stores apparently couldn't generate adequate amounts of cash to meet
their parent's debt-servicing requirements, analysts said.
   With Bloomingdale's now on the block, several long established
retail names are for sale. Earlier this summer, the U.S. division of
Australia's Hooker Corp. filed for protection from creditors under
Chapter 11 of the Federal Bankruptcy Code and put its B. Altman &amp;
Co. and Bonwit Teller department store chains up for sale.
   Bloomingdale's, founded in Manhattan in 1872, operates 17 stores
in New York, New Jersey, Connecticut, Massachusetts, Virginia,
Maryland, Pennsylvania, Florida, Illinois and Texas.

<HEAD>United Machinists Say Bass, KKR Seeking to Buy UAL</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SHERI T. PRASSO</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>

   United Airlines' Machinists union said Friday its
officials have been contacted by two buyout specialists seeking to
buy UAL Corp., the parent of United and a prime takeover target.
   One of the specialists later denied that it had approached the
Machinists, but a Machinists leader stood by the union's position.
   If those contacts develop into an offer, it could jeopardize the
$6.75 billion deal that pilots and management have proposed for
buying the nation's second-largest airline. A separate Machinists
bid could also drive a wedge between two of the industry's most
powerful unions.
   Billionaire Texas investor Robert Bass and takeover firm Kohlberg
Kravis Roberts &amp; Co., both mentioned in previous speculation about a
UAL takeover, are seeking meetings to discuss whether the Machinists
would be interested in supporting their bids, said spokesman James
Conley of the International Association of Machinists in Washington.
   The contacts were preliminary and no possible purchase price was
disclosed, Conley said. He would not say whether further meetings
had been scheduled or indicate whether the Machinists would support
either party.
   But a Kohlberg Kravis spokeswoman in New York, who asked not to
be identified, said late Friday that the firm hasn't met with the
Machinists about UAL and isn't interested in bidding for it.
   John Peterpaul, general vice president of the Machinists,
insisted that Kohlberg Kravis had discussed that subject about a
month ago with the union's financial advisers.
   Spokesmen for UAL, the pilots union and Bass declined comment
Friday on the overtures to the Machinists.
   Last Friday, the pilot-management group made its proposal to buy
Chicago-based UAL, topping a $6.19 billion sweetened offer from Los
Angeles oilman Marvin Davis. Under the pilot-management bid, British
Airways PLC would own 15 percent of UAL's stock for an investment of
$750 million. The employees would agree to unspecified wage
concessions in exchange for 75 percent of the stock.
   The Machinists' cooperation is crucial to the success of the
pilot-led bid, but the Machinists had expressed doubt about that
plan. Conley's hint of a separate bid appeared aimed at putting
pressure on UAL management and the pilots to address the Machinists'
concerns about job security and high debt levels.
   The Machinists, representing 25,000 of the airline's 70,000
employees, contend that the pilot-management bid is too high. They
favor recapitalization as a means of fighting takeover bids for UAL.
   The Machinists' posture appeared to strengthen the chances that
Davis could succeed in his rival bid.
   There have been rumors that Davis has started selling his stake
in the company, an indication he might scrap his takeover effort.
   UAL stock, which fell $5.12{ a share Thursday on the Davis rumor,
lost another $1.50 to close at $280.25 Friday on the New York Stock
Exchange.
   The Transportation Department has indicated it may move soon to
curb leveraged buyouts and foreign investments in the nation's
airline industry.
   Pat Friend, president of the Association of Flight Attendants
representing 12,700 workers at United, said Friday the flight
attendants are still considering the pilots' proposal.
   ``We have not committed ourselves either way,'' she said.
   The flight attendants have been trying to negotiate a new
contract for nearly two years, and Ms. Friend said participation in
a buyout would have to include a new contract.
   The bidding for the coveted UAL began several weeks ago with an
offer by Davis, driving up the company's stock on speculation that
higher offers would emerge.
   Bass is a leading corporate dealmaker with interests in oil,
financial services, real estate, publishing and investments in
several well-known companies.
   Kohlberg Kravis is a New York-based investment house that helped
pioneer the takeover strategy known as the leveraged buyout, in
which companies are bought with borrowed money repaid through
earnings or asset sales of the target company.

   The economic slowdown caught up with American
consumers in July as they paid off $280 million more in credit than
they borrowed, the government reported.
   The Federal Reserve Board said Friday that consumer credit in
July declined at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 0.5 percent,
down from June's 4.7 percent gain. The June advance was revised
downward from 5.1 percent.
   The last reduction in consumer debt was in January 1987.

   Avon Products Inc. has disclosed it may sell its
Giorgio Beverly Hills and Parfums Stern fragrance businesses,
suppliers of some of the country's hottest selling scents.
   No final decision on whether to divest the subsidiaries has been
reached, said James E. Preston, the big cosmetic company's chairman
and chief executive officer. Avon has hired the investment banking
firm Morgan Stanley &amp; Co. to help it explore the possibility of a
sale and evaluate alternatives.
   Proceeds from a possible sale would go toward reducing Avon's
debt, which at mid-year totaled about $1 billion, Preston said in a
statement Friday.

   More automated record-keeping is needed to keep
U.S. futures markets honest _ but not at the expense of the
traditional trading methods of shouts and hand signals, a government
watchdog agency said.
   At a Senate committee hearing, the General Accounting Office said
Friday the systems used for keeping track of trades on the nation's
commodities markets are ``fundamentally inadequate'' to detect and
deter wrongdoing.
   Last month, more than 40 traders and brokers on the two Chicago
futures exchanges were indicted on a variety of charges alleging
schemes to defraud customers.

   The chief regulator of national banks has
proposed a new capital rule that he says will discourage banks from
making risky investments. Comptroller of the Currency Robert L.
Clarke, whose agency regulates about 4,000 federally chartered
banks, on Friday proposed a 3 percent minimum capital standard, or
leverage ratio, as part of a larger risk-based capital rule that
takes effect at the end of 1990.
   But Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. Chairman L. William Seidman,
whose agency insures bank and S&amp;L deposits, is pushing for a 6
percent leverage ratio as a floor beneath the 8 percent risk-based
standard.
