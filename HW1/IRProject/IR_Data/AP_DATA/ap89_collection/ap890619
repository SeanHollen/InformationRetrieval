<HEAD>New Data Shows Fewer Blue Whales Closer to Extinction Than Thought</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SAN DIEGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Blue whales, the largest animals on earth, are
closer to extinction than previously thought, according to new
studies that counted the sea-going behemoths rather than relying on
estimates derived from whaling.
   The report came during the annual meeting of the International
Whaling Commission, a private gathering of delegations from 38
nations that ended Friday.
   Recent estimates put the blue whale's global population at
between 6,000 and 11,000, but the new research based on an
eight-year study in the southern hemisphere estimates the existing
population at between 200 and 453.
   ``Where we are is far, far worse than any of us had forseen,''
said Roger Payne, a research scientist for the World Wildlife Fund
and a member of the whaling commission's scientific committee. ``I
now think that the question of whether blue whales will actually
survive ... has suddenly come open again.''
   A worldwide ban on commercial whaling has been in effect since
1986, leading some experts to conclude that numbers of the
endangered whales might have increased.
   But the new numbers call into question old population estimates
and the procedure used to reach them. Earlier whale population
estimates were made primarily from extrapolations based on the
numbers of whales killed and sightings by whalers.
   The commission's new count was derived from surveys in which
specially assigned ships cruise the oceans and actually count whales.
   Sidney Holt, scientific adviser to the Seychelles Islands whaling
commission delegation, said latest reports also showed surprisingly
low numbers of humpback, sperm and fin whales.
   The commission was formed by whaling nations in 1949 to ensure
conservation of whales species and oversee management of whale
populations. Last week's meeting was closed to the news media and
few official announcements were made.
   Three countries granted limited whale kills, ostensibly for
scientific purposes, were urged by commission resolutions to reduce
how many whales they planned to kill.
   Iceland bowed to commission pressure and promised to reduce the
number of fin whales it would take in 1989 from 80 to 68 and said it
would halt plans to kill 10 sei whales.
   The North Atlantic nation also promised to suspend all research
whaling in 1990.
   Delegates also approved a resolution asking Japan to rethink
plans to kill 420 minke whales during 1989 and 1990. A similar
resolution was passed asking Norway to review its plans to slay 20
minke whales for research in 1990.
   Neither country responded to the resolutions, but Japanese
delegates were angry when the commission tabled a proposal to allow
the commercial killing of 320 minke whales along its coast.
   Japan's head delegate Kazuo Shima said he proposed the exemption
from the worldwide ban on commercial whaling ``to alleviate the
suffering'' of several coastal whaling communities he said have been
devastated financially by the ban.
   Shima said in a written statement delivered to the commission
that a membership split was present among commissioners, pitting the
pro-whaling minority against the majority that favors strict whale
conservation.
   ``What has developed here is the dominance of the meat-eating
culture over the fish-eating culture,'' Shima said. ``Despite our
great sacrifices and our efforts to ensure conservation, we continue
to be vilified by the meat-eating cultures because we hope some day
to return whale meat to our diets.''
   But Eiji Fujiwara, head of the Japanese environmental group Elsa
Nature, said Shima's arguments avoided the key issue.
   ``This is not whether people eat whale meat or not,'' Fijuwara
said. ``The most important thing is to save the whales.''
   Hundreds of environmental protesters staged demonstrations during
the week-long commission meetings. On the final day of talks, a huge
replica of a blue whale was filled with air and placed outside
meeting rooms.

<HEAD>Canada Says Agreement Reached on Radar Satellite</HEAD>
<HEAD>EDS: All dollar figures U.S.</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HALIFAX, Nova Scotia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Canada has reached agreement with
four provincial governments, industry and the United States to go
ahead with the $366 million Radarsat satellite, Prime Minister Brian
Mulroney said Monday.
   Mulroney told a conference on science and technology that the
Radarsat program is ``an ideal illustration of a major step
forward'' in Canada's space effort.
   The Radarsat satellite, to be launched in 1994, is designed to
take radar images of the earth's surface, even in the dark and
through clouds.
   Planners have said it will be used to provide information about
ice conditions in the Arctic and to help agricultural and forestry
industries by detecting the humidity of soil and vegetation.
   The Radarsat program was announced in September 1987, but
agreement was delayed because of disputes among the original
partners _ Canada, Britain, the United States and four Canadian
provinces.
   Britain withdrew last year, and in March Ontario reduced its
proposed contritution, saying Quebec was getting more than its share
of work from the project. The other participating provinces are
Saskatchewan and British Columbia.
   The Radarsat program originally was to receive the equivalent of
$173.6 million in Canadian federal funds over a five-year period.
   Mulroney gave no details about the agreement, saying they would
be announced later.
   A theme repeated at the conference was that Canada does not spend
enough on research and development and Mulroney said ``much remains
to be done.''
   He did not respond to a statement earlier in the day by Ontario
Premier David Peterson who said Canada's investment in research and
development should be raised to 2.5 percent of its gross domestic
product. The current level is 1.36 percent.
   Mulroney spoke of the responsibility of the private sector in
financing research.
   He said only 3 percent of Canada's manufacturing firms have
internal research and development capabilities and private sector
support accounts for only 1 percent of the revenue for universities
compared to seven percent in the United States.

<HEAD>Study: Teddy Bear is King of Stuffed Beasts</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICK HAMPSON</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Linus to the contrary, the American child's
favorite security blanket is the teddy bear.
   That's the contention of Dr. Paul Horton, a Meriden, Conn.,
psychiatrist who studied what he calls ``extra-parental solacers''
or ``transitional objects,'' and what the rest of us refer to as
``loveys'' or ``blankies.''
   One of four babies will choose a teddy bear as a transitional
object, Horton told Parents magazine.
   In a study of 890 children between ages 5 and 13, Horton and his
colleagues found that 40 percent developed a close attachment to a
stuffed animal _ twice as many as those who got their security from
a blanket. And of those who chose stuffed animals, about six in 10
chose teddy bears.
   Charles Schulz, creator of the cartoon strip ``Peanuts,'' told
Parents that he never had a security blanket, but got the idea for
Linus' famed blanket from his children.
   In a telephone interview Monday, Horton was asked why bears had
their claws into the nation's youth.
   ``It's been called a cultural fad, but that doesn't explain it,''
he said. ``Over the past 100 years children have been offered a lot
of solaces _ stuffed lions, giraffes and so forth _ but for some
reason children prefer the teddy bear.
   ``Part of it may be that the bear is enough like a human for the
child to relate to, but different enough to distinguish it. It's
ideally situated in psychological space.''
   A transitional object is part of the child's transition from
total dependence on its mother to relative independence, and is
defined as the first thing a child turns to consistently for solace
and comfort besides its parents or itself.
   The chosen bear or blanket is usually soft and cuddly, so much so
that it soon becomes dirty and ragged, often with a whiff of milk or
some foul-smelling substance. ``Mothers tend to spend a lot of time
cleaning or repairing transitional objects,'' Horton noted.
   But as far as kids are concerned, the lovey's grunginess adds to
its appeal. ``It's the child's own to do with as it wishes: take it,
leave it, keep it, throw it away,'' Horton said.
   Although ``lovey'' is probably the most common lay term for the
transitional object, children themselves have come up with a wide
range of alternatives. Jason Azocar, 5, of Salem, N.H., calls his
blanket his ``gigi'' (GEE-gee), while Peter Miller, 5, of Stratham,
N.H., prefers ``gaga'' (GAH-gah). Peter's older sister Emily uses
``baba'' (BAH-bah.)
   Kids also fasten on a wide variety of transitional objects. Those
that have been recorded by behavioral science include a scrub brush,
a potholder and a silk negligee. In an extreme case, an apparently
domestically inclined child became attached to a vacuum cleaner and
insisted it spend the night near his bed.
   We never overcome our need for transitional objects: they merely
change from bears to gloves to Jaguars. Sometimes they don't change
at all. Horton said a study of 1,200 students at the University of
Nebraska and Cornell University found that of students who had
stuffed animals, 80 percent of girls and 40 percent of boys took
their loveys with them to college.
   ``My own son went to the University of Minnesota, and he took his
old stuffed dog with him,'' Horton said. ``It made him feel better.''

   A Soviet passenger vessel with more than
900 people aboard rammed an iceberg in the Norwegian Sea and began
listing early Tuesday, reports said.
   The Maxim Gorky radioed north Norway's rescue central at 12:27
a.m. (6:27 p.m. EDT Monday) that it hit an iceberg about 185 miles
west of the Norwegian island of Spitsbergen, the Norwegian news
agency NTB said.
   Some passengers, many of them elderly West Germans, climbed onto
thick ice floes and were being picked up by the Norwegian vessel
Senja, which arrived about four hours after the distress signal, NTB
said.
   Other people among the estimated 958 passengers and crew aboard
the 629-foot vessel boarded lifeboats and rafts lowered from the
damaged ship into the near-freezing water, the reports said.
   There were no immediate reports of casualties.
   NTB quoted the Norwegian Defense Command as saying several other
Norwegian and Soviet vessels were within 300 miles of the Maxim
Gorky and that the ship's situation appeared stable. Four to six
Norwegian rescue helicopters were on their way, the report said.
   Hospitals in north Norway and on Spitsbergen, east of northern
Greenland, were on emergency alert and awaiting Norwegian medical
teams dispatched by helicopter, reports said.
   The Maxim Gorky was built in West Germany in 1969 and was sold to
the Soviet Union in 1974. In recent summers, the liner has carried
mostly West Germans on tours from Hamburg.

<TEXT>
   Gerald Gunther, now a leading
American law professor, came back to his birthplace still
remembering the Nazi teacher who regularly called him a ``Jewish
pig'' in the 1930s.
   As dozens of other West German towns and cities have done,
Usingen invited its former Jewish residents back a half-century
after they were driven out by Adolf Hitler.
   Gunther, now one of the foremost U.S. experts on constitutional
law, was born in May 1927 in Usingen, about 20 miles north of
Frankfurt. He started school there in 1933, the same year Hitler
came to power and began the harassment of Jews.
   The Nazi insults, particulary when they came from such an
authority figure as a teacher, left an indelible mark, Gunther said,
but at the same time they inspired him to excel.
   ``I was only 6 when Hitler took over in 1933, and I will never
forget the Nazi teacher who put us in the back corner of the
classroom to separate us from the Germans and called us `Jewish
pigs','' Gunther said in an interview.
   ``Because of this Nazi teacher's passion for drilling us with
dates in German history, such as when German kings were born, I
memorized those dates and was always first with my hand up to answer.
   ``When I did that, he would turn his back on me and say to the
German kids, `How is it that this Jewish pig knows the answers, and
you don't.''
   Gunther stood as he talked in front of Usingen's former
Hugenotten church, built in 1702 as a place of worship but used as a
school from 1823 to 1965.
   ``Ironically, I believe my passion for constitutional law and the
division of power (in government) was born in that school because of
the Nazi insults,'' Gunter said.
   He was born Guenther Gutenstein, the son of Otto and Minna
Gutenstein, and fled to the United States with his parents and
brothers in September, 1938. Many of the 90 Jewish residents of
Usingen had already left.
   After arriving in the United States Gunther learned English and
went on to an engineering college. That was followed by university
law courses, and he graduated second in his class from Harvard Law
School.
   Gunther said he changed his name from Gutenstein ``because my
father felt a non-Jewish sounding name would help me get a job in
engineering. But then I got involved in law.''
   He now teaches law at Stanford University in California, where he
lives.
   Gunther is the author of the college textbook ``Constitutional
Law,'' which is used in nearly every U.S. law school.
   Among those welcoming Gunther and 18 other Jews back to their
hometown were an old German school friend, Mrs. Friedel Preiss.
   ``I always remember him as the cute chubby little guy with curly
black hair,'' she said.
   The hair is thin and gray now, but Gunther repaid Mrs. Preiss'
compliment with a kiss on the cheek as they stood near the site of
Usingen's former synagogue where the visiting Jews laid a wreath.
   Mrs. Preiss said German schoolmates were stunned by what the
Nazis did to drive out their Jewish neighbors and friends.
   ``After they left, we always talked at home about them. We always
wondered if they were OK, and where they were,'' she said.
   Also in the group of former residents was Laura Duering, 65, of
San Francisco. Her family name was Rosenberg.
   Mrs. Duering said her family made apple cider and other fruit
spirits in Usingen, which were delivered to restaurants as distant
as Sachsenhausen, a part of Frankfurt.
   ``We had a German driver, Wilhelm Kolte, who was a very good
friend of the family,'' she said. ``He would take the cider into
Sachsenhausen at night, because it became illegal for restaurants to
deal with Jews.''
   She added that after her family had emigrated to the United
States to escape the Nazis, Kolte was drafted into the German army
and taken prisoner in the Soviet Union.
   ``My family wrote a letter to Soviet officials to convince them
Kolte was not a Nazi, and they later set him free,'' she said.
   ``We were lucky because we could leave,'' Mrs. Duering said. ``My
husband Rudolf escaped too, but his mother and father died in
Auschwitz,'' she said, referring to the notorious Nazi concentration
camp in what is now Poland.
   Stefan Kolb, a local high school teacher, initiated the project
to invite Usingen's former residents back home at the city's
expense. Kolb said he had been working on it since 1980, ``after we
decided to study about what happened to our former Jewish residents
as part of a history class.''
   Usingen has a population of about 10,500. The city allocated mark
equivalent of about $70,000 to bring its former Jewish citizens back
home.
   Many of the group of 19 Jews, from Israel, France and the United
States, were in their 70s and accompanied by their spouses and other
family members for the week-long visit.

   Power was restored to downtown and residential
areas early Sunday after a blackout caused by an explosion in a
transformer vault that also knocked out telephone operator service
to parts of three states.
   Three utility workers were critically burned.
   About 13,000 volts of electricity were running through the
underground equipment when a flash fire sparked the explosion,
forcing the evacuation of neighboring US West Communications and
AT&amp;T buildings, officials said.
   ``You can imagine that's pretty powerful,'' Assistant Fire Chief
Bill McDonnell said of the voltage.
   Two of the victims who were in the vault at the time of the
blast, a man and a woman, `breathed in fire'' and were in ``very
critical'' condition Sunday at St. Joseph Hospital in Omaha, nursing
supervisor Becke Majors said. The third worker, a man, was at
another hospital in serious condition.
   Ruth Howard, a US West employee who was standing near the alley
where the explosion occurred, said two of the workers ran out of the
alley engulfed in flames.
   ``I've never seen anything like it before in my life,'' she said.
``Their clothes were burned completely off and they were screaming
for help.''
   Kari Eckert, a private security guard, who was one of the first
people on the scene. She said the injured woman yelled: ``Help me!
Help me! I'm on fire!''
   ``I turned around and I almost got sick,'' Ms. Eckert said. ``I
was scared to death.''
   Mark Gautier Jr., a spokesman for the Omaha Public Power
District, said Sunday the explosion Saturday night knocked out power
to the entire downtown area and about 350 square blocks of two
residential neighborhoods.
   Power was restored to all areas by 4:15 a.m., he said. He said
the number of customers who lost power was not known.
   ``We may be able to ascertain a cause but sometimes it will take
several weeks. Sometimes you never find out,'' he said.
   ``The problem is so much of the evidence burns up. We may be able
to get some information from the workers. We just don't know,'' he
said.
   Fire Chief Robert Warsocki said his department had completed its
investigation and that any other information would have to come from
the utility. ``It was just an accidental electrical fire,'' he said
Sunday.
   Jim Brader, a spokesman for US West Communications, a subsidiary
of US West, said the three workers were replacing a 3,000-amp
switching unit for the telephone company.
   Gautier said power had to be turned off in parts of the US West
Building, and the workers were turning the power back on when a
flash started the fire and blast.
   The evacuation of the two communication buildings meant there
were no operator-assisted calls for about three hours for AT&amp;T
customers in all of Nebraska, half of South Dakota and the western
third of Iowa, a company spokesman said.
   Omaha World-Herald editors worked by flashlight to piece together
late Sunday editions and some metropolitan deliveries were delayed
for hours.
   Paul Nieman, 46, of LaPlatte, and Carla Fitzpatrick, 32, of
Omaha, suffered inhalation burns in addition to third-degree burns
over 70 percent to 85 percent of their bodies, said Majors, the
nursing supervisor.
   Frank Dwornicki of Omaha was taken to the burn unit at St.
Elizabeth Hospital in Lincoln, where he was in serious condition
Sunday afternoon with burns over 25 percent of his body, a nurse
said.

<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   This is the summer of the Great Rottweiler Scare.
   Rottweilers are very large, very ferocious dogs, and one might
imagine from recent headlines that they have Britain under siege.
   For a nation that cherishes its dog-loving image, it's an
unsettling experience, and more than a simple dog-bites-man story.
   For weighty political and social issues are at play.
   The trouble began in April, when two Rottweilers savaged and
killed an 11-year-old girl who was exercising them in Scotland.
   Reports of Rottweiler attacks have since filled the newspapers.
About 20 have been reported, and they come with precise details,
down to the number of stitches required.
   ``It seems as if the Rottweiler dog ... is rapidly assuming the
dimensions of the Hound of the Baskervilles,'' commented The
Guardian newspaper.
   Indeed, there are some similarities with Sherlock Holmes' ghostly
canine legend.
   Rottweilers are plenty scary. They weigh about 130 pounds and are
built like armored personnel carriers. In Britain, their number has
increased sevenfold to 180,000 over the past decade.
   With headlines blaring about ``devil dogs'' biting babies in
their cribs, the House of Commons sat into the early hours of
Thursday debating the issue.
   Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher's own supporters rebelled, and
nearly defeated her on a motion to introduce dog-licensing.
   The conservative Thatcherites oppose licensing. Wedded to a
doctrine of getting government off the people's backs, they
abolished the mandatory license two years ago.
   Now, they say Rottweilers or no Rottweilers, they won't bring it
back.
   ``It would be very, very bureaucratic and very, very hard to
enforce,'' says Environment Minister Virginia Bottomley.
   Peter Jenkins, a liberal newspaper columnist, says that with this
sort of laissez-faire attitude, ``we'd still have wolves on Clapham
Common,'' the park near his London home.
   In a television debate, liberal lawmaker Paddy Ashdown reeled off
statistics to back his demand for a licensing scheme: 500,000 stray
dogs roaming the streets of Britain, 250,000 dog bites a year
costing the public health system $26 million annually.
   License fees, he said, would pay for more dog catchers and dog
pounds.
   The Rottweiler set is aggrieved. They have their own horror
stories of Rottweilers being poisoned in vengeance attacks, of
people being abused and threatened as they walk their Rottweilers,
of plummeting prices for pups, and of owners wanting to get rid of
their Rottweilers.
   They blame the news media. ``It appears a Rottweiler has only to
sneeze and it is in the headlines,'' Marilyn Hayward of the British
Rottweiler Association was quoted as telling The Sunday Times.
   Nothing, it seems, is safe. The Today newspaper described how
policemen with pitchforks cowered on a tractor in Orpington, south
of London, while a Rottweiler ran riot among a farmer's prize pigs.
   Letters to the press offer various advice. Margaret Jackson wrote
in from Chipping Camden saying she found water pistols useful in
fending off vicious dogs. The Rev. Roger Reed of Saffron Waldon said
dog-owners, like drivers, should undergo a test before being allowed
to have a Rottweiler.
   Animal psychiatrists at Cambridge University announced they would
study the beast. ``There is a serious problem with some animals and
we hope to find out why,'' said Dr. James Serpell.
   Some observers think the popularity of these dogs is a reflection
of the times. They are effective protection against increasing
burglaries and tough-guy symbols for the Rambo age.
   ``We suspect there's a growing trend of people buying these dogs
as a sort of macho status symbol,'' said Helen Jessop, spokeswoman
of the Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals.
   Rottweiler lovers like to say, ``There are no bad dogs, only bad
owners.'' That view, replies the weekly Economist, resembles the
slogan of the U.S. anti-gun control lobby that ``guns don't kill
people; people kill people.''

   A hot spell gave many television viewers an
unexpected taste of foreign shores this weekend, a newspaper
reported today.
   Some watchers saw Scandanavian television and others found
themselves tuned into France as the heat and other unusual
atmospheric conditions threw television signals out of kilter, the
Daily Telegraph said.
   It said an atmospheric inversion that settled over Britain caused
signals to be reflected back to earth unpredictably. In an
atmospheric inversion, temperatures rise in the upper levels of the
air, in contrast to normal conditions, the paper said.
   As a result, viewers in eastern Britain saw faint images from
Scandanavia and those in the south saw Belgian and French
television, said the report.
   It said Roger Fussell of Devon picked up images from Spain,
Italy, France, Sweden and East Germany.
   But the newspaper said Fussell didn't mind the interruption that
others might curse. He belongs to a ``ham-television'' club whose
members seek out odd and foreign programs.
   All of Britain enjoyed a mostly sunny weekend, with temperatures
in some areas reaching unusually into the mid-80s in some areas.

   ``Starting shortly, through the end of the season, probably 8 or
9 percent of the coins are Canadian,'' said Paul Dunn, vice
president and operations manager at Donovan and Donovan Inc., a
vending company in nearby Saco.
   The nickels, dimes and quarters are the same size as their U.S.
counterparts, and at current exchange rates _ $1.19 Canadian per $1
U.S. _ they can take a slow, steady bite out of profits.
   ``We have a pretty hefty discount when it goes to the bank,''
Dunn said. ``Coins we get discounted 50 percent. The way it's
explained to us is it's an expensive process, handling them and
shipping them back.''
   Dunn said his company plans to install electronic devices to make
machines refuse the Canadian coins, but that can create new problems.
   ``Of course, that makes irate customers,'' Dunn said. ``A few
years ago, it (the exchange rate) was 3 percent, and we put in coin
acceptors.''
   In northern Maine, Hedrich Vending Inc. of Presque Isle winds up
with so many Canadian coins that trying to keep them away would not
be worth the effort, said Joe Hedrich Jr. Fixing the machines to
reject the Canadian coins would lead to too many jammed machines.
   ``We'd have service calls galore,'' Hedrich said. ``We eat the
discount.''
   Up north, the discount is not as bad, with banks subtracting the
actual exchange rate of around 20 percent in recent days, he said.
   But in southern Maine, banks are not fond of handling Canadian
coins.
   ``For a customer of Maine National Bank, we will discount it 50
percent, but for a non-customer, we will not do it at all,'' said
Jim Parisi, head teller at Maine National in downtown Portland.
   In Old Orchard Beach, a seaside town 20 miles south of Portland,
the tourism economy gets such a lift from Canadians that officials
have decided to take the foreign coins at face value when they turn
up in municipal parking lots and pay toilets.
   ``As a courtesy we don't discount them,'' Town Manager Jerry
Plante said. ``What limited number we get we process through the
bank, and we get discounted 40 percent.''
   Vending companies that need to sift the Canadian change out of
the U.S. coins have found that they can do so by running all the
coins under special magnets, which fish the Canadian coins out, said
Hendrich.
   The Canadian coins also turn up in parking meters. Some Maine
residents have found the meters to be a good place to get rid of
Canadian coins that turn up in their pocket change.
   In Portland, parking meter supervisor Robert Henderson said the
problem may be aggravated by businesses who buy the cheap coins and
hand them out to let customers plug meters with them. Henderson said
he can't prove the coins are being systematically used and he would
not identify any suspect businesses, but he's gotten reports for
several years of the practice.

<HEAD>Saving For A Rainy Day A Way Of Life In Japan</HEAD>

   The Japanese may appear to be the world's most avid
consumers of luxury goods, but they are just as enthusiastic about
stashing money in the bank.
   The country's 39 million households each held an average 19.1
million yen, equivalent to about $132,450, in personal savings last
year, according to a recent Bank of Japan report.
   Total personal savings rose 11.4 percent to $5.18 trillion in
1988 and accounted for more than half the total value of Japan's
goods and services, outpacing growth in consumer spending, which
surged 4.5 percent.
   It was the third year that personal savings deposited at banks
and postal offices or held in stocks, bonds and insurance posted
double-digit growth over the previous year.
   It also is a clear indication that the Japanese have not
abandoned their habit of saving a substantial part of their incomes.
   Japanese save 16 percent of their income on average, compared to
about 5.5 percent in the United States.
   The bulk of personal savings in Japan _ $4.45 trillion _ is held
in bank and postal deposits and in bonds and insurance, the
remainder in stocks.
   However, savings figures exclude important assets such as real
estate and therefore understate the wealth of many Japanese families.
   Homeowners in Tokyo, for example, held real estate worth an
average of $596,393 in 1987, according to the government's Economic
Planning Agency.
   Likewise, the lower savings rate in the United States understates
the wealth of American families, which is mainly held in housing,
says Richard C. Koo, senior economist at Nomura Research Institute.
   Japanese savings mainly are in financial assets, he says. That
creates a massive pool of capital for Japanese industry.
   ``While the value of land in Japan tends to appreciate, housing
actually depreciates. People know that their houses will not be
worth much 10 years from now, so they don't invest in housing,'' Koo
said.
   ``Americans put their savings into keeping their homes up,
because they expect them to appreciate,'' he explained.
   Housing in Japan is vulnerable to earthquakes and fires and
traditionally is torn down and rebuilt rather than maintained.
   Numerous surveys say the Japanese save to prepare for illness and
disaster, for retirement and childrens' educations.
   ``I've always stashed whatever I could in the bank, so I'd have a
nice nest egg,'' said Seitarou Komatsu, 41, an employee of a major
Japanese industrial firm. ``It's my security. That way, I can relax
and not worry.''
   The prospect of long years of retirement is a crucial reason.
Average life expectancy in Japan is 82.1 years for women and 75.9
years for men, while the mandatory retirement age at many companies
is 55-60.
   ``The Japanese are much less confident about the future than
Americans,'' said Koo. ``They know how much things cost here, and
they're wise to prepare for their old age.''
   But, how do they do it?
   The expansion of two-income families has contributed to the
growth in personal savings, along with rising values of financial
assets.
   The average monthly wage for a Japanese worker in a company with
30 employees or more _ about half of Japan's work force of 44
million _ is about $2,329, while spending averages $2,080 a
household.

   Prince William of Wales turns 7 on Wednesday and
he is a changed child, says People magazine.
   Wills, as his mother Princess Diana calls him, became known as
the ``Prince of Wails'' because of his king-size temper tantrums,
but he is shedding his willful image and turning into a little
charmer with the knowledge he has a big future, the magazine
reported this week.
   ``He's incredibly confident for a little boy his age,'' said a
recent unidentified visitor to the royal family's estate in
Highgrove. ``It's a bit like talking to another adult.''
   Some in the family retinue credit his transformation to the
replacement of an indulgent nanny with a stern one; others say he
has simply matured.

   Rhythm and blues singer Etta James would love for
her new album ``Sticking to My Guns,'' to win a Grammy, even though
she's still upset about the way her last album was treated.
   Ms. James, who will perform Friday at a Dallas blues festival,
said she was hurt when her album ``Seven Year Itch'' was shunted to
afternoon ceremonies instead of being included among the prime-time
presentations.
   ``Were they saying that the blues is a minor part of American
music culture?'' she asked. ``That's like taking away country or
gospel or jazz or rock 'n' roll.''
   The 50-year-old singer, who still works to achieve a ``raw
feeling and down-home message'' in her songs, said she sympathized
with the rap musicians who were treated similarly.
   ``When the rappers had their little controversy with the Grammys
and they wanted to boycott, I wanted to join them right out in front
of the shrine,'' Ms. James said.

   Indicted junk bond king Michael Milken had
some investment advice for a business group: Educate yourself.
   ``Opportunity in America begins with education,'' he told the
audience during his weekend appearance. ``We are no longer an
industrial society. We are an information and services society. ...
The future of the country doesn't lie in factories but in the
classroom.''
   Milken, indicted in March on charges of criminal fraud and
racketeering, said many people don't understand the forces behind
the huge value of some Japanese companies, some of which are worth
more than the stock markets of entire countries.
   ``It's because they have educated 95 percent of their people to
work in the jobs of the future,'' said Milken, who resigned last
week from Drexel Burnham Lambert, a New York securities firm where
he earned more than $1 billion from 1983 to 1987.

   Adventurer Will Steger's long-awaited
expedition across Antarctica remains $600,000 shy of its $11 million
budget.
   ``It's the same old story,'' Steger said. ``We don't have enough
money to get off the ice.''
   The journey carries a price tag that includes $7.8 million in
cash expenditures and $3.2 million in donated goods and services.
And its hefty cost has drawn criticism.
   ``People ask how we can spend this kind of money in today's
world,'' said Cathy deMoll, business manager of the expedition's St.
Paul headquarters. ``Well, George Bush's inaugural cost $30 million.
And look at the money spent on weapons. ... We're not taking money
out of the mouths of starving children. We're using corporate money
in an altruistic way.''
   Beginning Aug. 1, weather permitting, Steger and French physician
Jean-Louis Etienne will lead a team of six men _ including members
from the Soviet Union, Great Britain, China and Japan _ and 36 dogs
across Antarctica.
   The goal of their 4,000-mile journey is to conquer the world's

   Soviet goaltender Vladislav Tretiak has become
the first European player to be inducted into the Hockey Hall of
Fame.
   Tretiak, and former Toronto center Darryl Sittler and former
Detroit Red Wings left winger Herbie Lewis were chosen Sunday by a
12-member selection committee. All three will be inducted on Oct. 3
in Toronto.
   Tretiak, 37, a long-time star with the Soviet National Team, led
the Soviets to 13 World Championships and helped the Central Red
Army to 13 Soviet Elite League titles. In his 287-game Soviet
National Team career, Tretiak played on three Olympic gold
medal-winning teams.
   Scotty Morrison, president of the Hockey Hall of Fame, said the
selection of Tretiak signals a new emphasis on honoring hockey
greats outside North America.
   ``Ten years ago the emphasis wasn't on international hockey the
way it is today,'' he said.
   Morrison said he expected some backlash from North American
players who were passed up this year. He said some selection
committee members questioned whether Tretiak has not faced the same
``day-in and day-out'' intensity as most NHL stars.

   When it comes to corn, a 32-year-old
secretary is cob.
   Anita Hack of Temple was a double winner at the 15th annual
Holland Corn Festival, capturing the corn-eating contest and the
corn seed spitting event.
   She munched all the kernels off a cob in less than a minute with
a different approach than most of about 30 other competitors:
Instead of stripping off rows, she ate round and round until she
finished.
   ``I've been practicing all week. I thought the quickest way was
to eat all around the ear, but I didn't expect to win,'' she said.
   Winning the spitting contest with a distance of 16 feet, 2
inches, was an even bigger surprise.
   ``I really don't know how I won this one,'' she said. ``I never
spit.''
   But even though she didn't expectorate to win, and did anyway, it
was a close contest. Jane Montgomery, 50, had earlier sent a seed 16
feet, 1 inch after soaking it in beer.
   Competition also was held in corn cob tossing and relay racing
with ears of corn squeezed between racers' knees. The festival on
Saturday drew several thousand to the town of about 860 people, 20
miles south of Temple.

   If Okmulgee, Okla., has thrown down the
wooden spoon, Moultrie is picking it up.
   At issue: Which community can bake the biggest pecan pie.
   ``I think that's just a challenge that we can't quit,'' Moultrie
Mayor Bill McIntosh said Sunday night after hearing Okmulgee
boosters had baked a 40-foot pie, breaking Moultrie's 1988 record of
30 feet in diameter.
   Georgians have been battling with bakers in Okmulgee for three
years. Saturday's pie was 4 inches thick.
   Fred Burks, co-chairman of the sixth-annual Okmulgee Pecan
Festival, said the committee members planning this year's event
didn't want to beat the Georgia record by just a few inches:
   ``They said, `Let's take a quantum leap and see if we can't take
charge of this thing and eliminate them from the competition.'''
   ``Never,'' said McIntosh. ``I think we will respond at the
appropriate time with a larger pie.'' He said the pie would be baked
at the Sun Belt Expo, a giant farm show held in October.
   The ingredients of the Oklahoma pie _ mixed in two new,
steam-cleaned cement trucks _ cost about $20,000, although most were
donated. Burks said.
   The pie included 77,770 cups of flour, 6,666 cups of shortening,
13,290 teaspoons of salt, 3,333 cups of water, 1,357{ cups of
margarine, 64,280 eggs and 3,000 pounds of pecans.

   When the bottom fell out of recreational
boat sales, the Cajun food craze helped one boat builder stay afloat.
   Besides his full-sized line of boats, Ron Chapman sells hundreds
of miniature pirogues, skiffs and sailboats which will never see a
bayou or sail on a lake. Instead, they decorate seafood buffets and
salad bars in hotels and restaurants in 31 states and the District
of Columbia.
   ``I consider myself lucky. ... It's like a functional Pet Rock,''
said Chapman, who runs Ron Chapman Shipwright Inc. in Chalmette, a
New Orleans suburb.
   Last year, sales totaled nearly $40,000. The boats, which range
from 2 to 4 feet, go for $20 to $125 each and account for about
one-quarter of his business. He expects to double sales this year on
the miniature boats.
   Hotels like the fiberglass boats because they're easy to clean
and make a stylish food display, he said.
   ``They're pretty neat,'' said John Gregory, banquet manager for
the Albuquerque Marriott in New Mexico. ``They're great for
decorations, and they hold a lot of seafood.''
   A birthday present for a friend's daughter started Chapman's
buffet business. His friend thought the little boat would work well
in a seafood display and offered to take one to Tim Paoletti, then
marketing manager of the New Orleans Hilton. Paoletti ordered 18.
Soon other hotels followed suit.

   Eight people burned to death in a head-on
collision involving a pickup truck and two cars Sunday afternoon on
a remote Everglades roadway known as Alligator Alley.
   The accident on the two-lane stretch of state Route 84 occurred
at 4:40 p.m. about 44 miles east of Naples, said Florida Highway
Patrol Sgt. Craig Perkins in Fort Myers.
   A car carrying seven people collided head-on with a pickup truck
containing one person on the two-lane road, said patrol duty officer
Doug Dailey. Troopers said the pickup was attempting to pass when it
collided with the car.
   Another car coming from behind and trying to avoid the accident
immediately sideswiped the wreckage, Perkins said, adding that the
two people in that car were not injured.
   The patrol earlier reported that nine people were killed because
officers mistakenly identified a large fish in the burning wreckage
as a victim, Dailey said.
   The 100-mile, east-west highway through the Everglades, which
links Fort Lauderdale on Florida's eastern coast and Naples on the
west coast, was immediately closed following the accident, Perkins
said. The road is also part of Interstate 75.
   Patrol Lt. Malcolm Rhodes said dental records will be needed to
positively identify the eight victims. The results are not expected
until at least Monday.
   Amy Burgess, who was in the car that sideswiped the wreckage,
said there was chaos following the accident.
   ``People were yelling, `Move the car, it's going to explode,' and
I just tried not to look,'' Ms. Burgess said, adding that the memory
of the crash on Alligator Alley will remain with her forever.
   ``This was my first time on it,'' she said. ``I'll never get on
it again.''

<TEXT>
   As important elections loom, charges that Prime
Minister Sousuke Uno paid a geisha to be his mistress are drawing
angry roars from women and could alienate more voters from the
scandal-tainted governing party.
   ``Personally, I think that if the report is true he should
resign,'' says Kii Nakamura, spokeswoman for the 1-million member
Housewives Association.
   ``It could come to us pressing for that, but we won't decide what
course of action to take until he explains himself.''
   Ms. Nakamura said her group and 51 others representing most major
Japanese women's organizations will submit a letter to Uno,
demanding he confirm or deny the report and explain his feelings
toward ``sex as a product you can buy.''
   Among those calling for Uno to step down are such diverse groups
as the Japan Communist Party and a national anti-prostitution
organization headed by a former legislator.
   ``He is not qualified to hold such an office,'' the
anti-prostitution group said in a statement.
   Chairwoman Michiko Matsuura of the 5,000-member League of Women
Voters said, ``Overall, the status of women is moving in the right
direction. But what worries us is that the scandal involves the man
at the top, the man with ultimate responsibility for enforcing the
laws that guarantee women's rights.''
   According to the report, published soon after Uno became prime
minister on June 2, an unidentified, 40-year-old woman said Uno paid
her $2,100 a month to be his mistress for four months in 1985.
   ``He is not a man of noble character,'' the woman allegedly told
the respected weekly magazine Sunday Mainichi. ``I don't want him to
use politics the same way he treated me.''
   Uno has avoided replying to opposition lawmakers' questions in
parliament on the subject, saying he will not comment publicly on
personal matters as the assembly's rules permit.
   ``We were shocked ... when we heard the questioning in the
parliament session,'' said a joint statement from the League of
Women Voters, the Japan Nurses Association and five other
organizations representing 6 million women. ``The prime minister
must clearly and honestly answer to the charges.''
   Dalliances of public officials often have been ignored by the
media, but chief editor Shuntaro Torigoe said his Sunday magazine
published the article to bring social ethics into the public arena.
   The latest scandal comes as the Liberal Democratic Party, which
has run Japan for 34 years, struggles to regroup after the
resignation of Prime Minister Noboru Takeshita, who left office
because of links to an influence-peddling scandal that has involved
much of the governing elite.
   Uno is considered a weak politician, but the party chose him
because of his unblemished reputation after another scandal-free
party elder refused the post.
   Analysts say party leaders had hoped Uno would polish the party's
image before late July elections for half the seats in the upper
house of parliament. But Matsuura told The Associated Press that
strategy may have backfired.
   ``Most women, and I think most men, are concerned with his
conduct,'' she said, noting more than half of Japan's 88.9 million
voters are women. ``His handling of this affair will be reflected at
the polls.''
   Standing to benefit most is the biggest opposition party, the
Socialists, whose popular leader Takako Doi is the only woman at the
helm of a major party. Ms. Doi has not commented on the scandal,
though a female Socialist legislator was the first to raise it in
parliament.
   The mass-circulation Asahi Shimbun newspaper has quoted one of
Uno's campaign officials as saying the scandal is irrelevant.
   However, Uno's administration will lead the Liberal Democrats to
elections with the lowest support rating registered by a new
government _ 22 percent, according to a poll by Mainichi Shimbun,
Japan's third-largest newspaper.
   Political analyst and author Asao Yamaguchi says changing
attitudes toward women may have helped the scandal snowball, but
more important is a general feeling of distrust toward politicians
engendered by the influence-peddling affair.
   ``If it was only a sex scandal, male voters might not have
cared,'' Yamaguchi said ``But Uno didn't foster much confidence from
the start, and this just adds to the dissatisfaction.''

   Miners at the Pittson Coal Group's only active
mines in Kentucky walked out early Monday, joining a bitter strike
by an estimated 20,000 coal miners in six states.
   On Sunday, about 4,000 people attended a solidarity rally in
Waynesburg, Pa., near the West Virginia line. ``The labor union has
been asleep, but this sleeping giant has awakened,'' said Ed
Yankovich, incoming president of United Mine Workers District 4.
   Miners began walking off their jobs in southern West Virginia at
the beginning of last week in support of the strike against
Pittston. By Monday, the walkout had spread to Pennsylvania,
Indiana, Virginia, Kentucky and Tennessee.
   UMW President Richard Trumka on Sunday called a strike by about
200 miners at three Eastern Coal Corp. mines in eastern Kentucky
near the West Virginia border, the only active Pittston holdings in
that state. The walkout began at 12:01 a.m. Monday.
   ``Everyone feels it was long overdue,'' said Terry Varney, a
spokesman for UMW Local 5737. ``We're glad to finally be joining the
others on the picket line. Morale is high and with solidarity we
feel we can beat Pittston.''
   Boyd Vance, a miner on strike near the Guyandotte River in
southern West Virginia, expects the wildcat strikes to spread
further. Then, if coal production still isn't stopped, he'll start
looking out for trouble.
   ``I believe in being able to express myself peacefully in a
non-violent way, but there are others out there who, at the drop of
the hat, will kill you for what they believe in,'' Vance said.
   Two people have been killed in UMW strikes in recent years: a
non-union truck driver caught in sniper fire in 1985 and a striking
miner shot by a guard in 1978.
   The union has been on strike against Pittston in Virginia and
West Virginia since April 5 because it hasn't had a contract since
February 1988. Two judges in Virginia have jailed three strike
leaders and fined the union millions of dollars.
   Though the union leadership denies orchestrating the walkouts at
mines other than Pittston's, which violate the contract, Trumka last
week urged miners to return to the fighting spirit they had in the
1970s.
   ``If I was working for the mine workers, I'd go after Trumka's
scalp,'' Pittston spokesman Bill Byrne said.
   West Virginia once was the nation's largest coal producer, but
wildcat strikes in the late 1960s and throughout the 1970s are
blamed for reducing production and sending coal customers elsewhere.
Kentucky and Wyoming now lead the nation _ West Virginia is third.
   ``All this puts West Virginia in a position of being an
unreliable supplier,'' said Gary White, president of the West
Virginia Coal Association. ``We had that situation in the 1960s and
1970s, with all the instability.
   ``Our customers are wondering if this is the beginning of that
type of pattern.''
   The expiration of contracts between the UMW and the Bituminous
Coal Operators Association prompted nationwide strikes in 1971, 1974
and 1977.
   But scores of smaller impromptu strikes took place for reasons
ranging from lost time because of a flood _ 3,000 miners struck for
a week _ to cuts in medical benefits _ 70,000 miners out for six
weeks.
   The UMW leadership has denied ordering the current wildcat.
   ``I'm not aware of any order from the union dictating that our
members walk off the job,'' UMW spokesman Joe Corcoran said
Saturday. ``The miners have walked off the job and in most cases
have articulated both anger and frustration at the heavy-handedness
of the Virginia courts' imprisonment of strike leaders and fines.''
   But in Birmingham, Ala., UMW District 20 international board
member Tommy Buchanan said Friday that it was up to Trumka whether
Alabama miners walk out. ``It will start whenever it comes down from
the union president,'' he said.
   At the heart of the current walkout is the contract dispute with
Pittston. But Pittston last week declared negotiations at an
impasse, which allowed it to implement its latest contract offer.
Federal labor law requires UMW leaders to present that offer to
their members.
   Miners' anger also is aimed at the two judges who have fined the
union $3 million for peaceful demonstrations and jailed three men
for continuing civil disobedience.
   ``Everyone would have been working right now if that judge had
not stepped in and put that kind of fine and penalty on the union,''
said John Vance, a newly elected rank-and-file board member and
Ashland Coal miner.
   Boyd Vance, who is no relation to John Vance, said the Pittston
situation is make-or-break.
   ``They're going against everything we've ever had. If we let
Pittston get away with it, then all these other companies will come
up and say, ``We know the route. Let's take it,''' he said.

   He's just been appointed to a big job in
Washington, assistant deputy undersecretary for something. He
figures he'll have the president's ear from time to time, be invited
to state dinners. He might call a quick press conference to lay out
his agenda.
   One can almost hear the sound of expectations deflating in this
anecdote published in a new manual for people new to Washington:
   ``I expected a briefing by the White House on what life would be
like in Washington. I expected someone to consider my family and say
hey, here's 10 realtors, and here's the country club, here's the
schools for your kids and here's some people that would like to meet
your wife, and here's the synopsis from the transition team on how
to do things.
   ``Well, I never got any of that. It was `sink or swim, pal.'''
   The teller of that tale is a former government appointee who
appears _ along with dozens of others _ anonymously in ``A
Survivors' Guide for Government Executives,'' subtitled ``How to
Succeed in Washington.''
   It was written by John H. Trattner, a former journalist and
diplomat, based on interviews with members of the Center for
Excellence in Government. The center is a non-partisan organization
of some 400 business leaders who have held appointed policy-making
or management jobs in government, some as far back as the
administration of Franklin D. Roosevelt.
   They were asked for their insights to help those who are about to
do what they had done _ move from private life into a high federal
post.
   A repeated theme is that the new appointee would be wise to know
and use the existing bureaucracy, the civil servants who were there
before him and will be after he leaves.
   ``Don't try to do it all,'' the appointee is advised. ``Don't be
afraid to use existing mechanisms. ... Build esprit and morale. ...
Remember that staff are there to help you.''
   Much of the advice is common sense, but some is eyecatching.
Reading it conveys a sense of what it must be like to come to
Washington to work for a president and for a boss one doesn't know
while leading an unknown staff and having to face Congress, press
and constituency with answers, right from the start.
   Here are some samples _ with backup comments from the
ex-government officials, drawing on their own experiences:
   _``Keep in constant touch with your interest groups.'' An
ex-official's comment: ``One temptation the political appointee has
to resist is ... staying in the office and listening only to an
elite cadre of special assistants. You've got to go out, you've got
to have lunch with the lobbying groups ... even though you don't
have enough time to get everything done as it is.''
   _``You're not being invited in for an ego trip.'' The comment:
``Be sure you know that the government is very big, and your piece
is going to be only a part of it. The president isn't going to wake
up every day and wonder where you are.''
   _``It's government by committee. Get used to it. Even routine
decisions in Washington are usually drudged over by several
agencies; weeks, months, even years can go by while a decision
stumbles through successive phases of research and laborious
negotiation.''
   _``Know when not to compromise.'' The quote: ``You have to have
the patience to hear them out, then wait them out, then stall them
out, and finally say no. The patient, intellectually honest stall is
one of the great government ploys.''
   _``Control your in-box; don't let it control you.'' The quote:
``Every day I came in there were three in-boxes, and then there were
four in-boxes, and so on. So I used to just leave them, and if
something was important enough, somebody would eventually come into
my office and say something like, `Did you get that memo I sent you
several months ago. It was real important. We ought to get on that.'
And we would.''
   _``Learn from the professionals.'' The quote: ``There is almost
always one person ... who's been around for a long time, knows all
the bodies ... If you can find that man or woman and befriend them
and get them to give you the real kind of inside skinny on what's
going on, that's very helpful. You've got to find the intelligence
network inside the system.''
   _``No precaution is too small or too troublesome.'' The quote:
``For God's sake, don't lie to people, don't let somebody pay for a
$300 hotel room, don't accept gifts, don't let people buy you
lunches.''
   Trattner said it was exhilarating to listen to the former
officials.
   ``Their experience signals the continuing vitality and challenge
of the political system they embody,'' he said. ``It is a system
whose uniqueness rests in part on the ability to spur experienced
and intelligent men and women to place their talents, for a time, at
the service of the nation.''

<HEAD>WASHINGTON TODAY: Congress Won't Give Own Workers Same Rights as
Others</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LAWRENCE L. KNUTSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Capitol Hill has a little secret, one that has
caused some to dub Congress ``the last plantation.''
   When Congress passes laws affecting the rights, working
conditions, health and safety of hundreds of millions of American
workers, it routinely exempts itself and the thousands of people who
work for it.
   Most American employees are ensured that their basic rights will
be protected by law, that standard occupational health and safety
regulations will be observed, that they can expect to earn at least
a minimum wage, that they cannot be discriminated against because of
race, sex or age.
   But the word ``most'' does not apply to workers in the marble
halls and utilitarian kitchens and basements of Congress.
   ``It is a little known fact,'' says Sen. John Glenn, D-Ohio,
``that both the Senate and the House have exempted themselves from
provisions of federal law passed by Congress in these areas.''
   ``A double standard is established when Congress passes
legislation for the rest of the country and then exempts itself,''
Glenn said.
   Glenn commented last week as he and Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz.,
introduced legislation intended to give most congressional workers
the same employment protection enjoyed by other Americans.
   He quoted the late Sen. Sam Ervin, D-N.C., as saying the
congressional practice of avoiding the laws it passes for others
looks like a case ``where the doctor is prescribing medicine for his
patients that he himself will not take.''
   ``I agree with that statement,'' Glenn said. ``I believe this
medicine is good for both the patient and the doctor.''
   Glenn's medicine is designed to get around two obstacles.
   One is the traditional reluctance of Congress to put its
activities and practices under the jurisdiction of the executive
branch.
   It would be a violation of the doctrine of separation of powers
to permit Congress to be judged by an equal branch of government,
many House and Senate members contend.
   The other is the preference of many members of Congress to hire
staff members from their own states and, most of the time, from
their own political parties.
   The Glenn-McCain bill addresses both sticking points, perhaps
making the medicine a little easier to swallow.
   In the first place, it places the mechanism for policing
enforcement of the laws inside the legislative branch itself by
creating a Congressional Employees Relations Office to do the job.
   Secondly, it makes a concession.
   If a senator from Wisconsin, for example, wants to hire only
Wisconsin natives to serve on his staff, he could do so under the
terms of the bill.
   And if a member of Congress wanted a purely partisan staff, he or
she would have that right.
   ``However, it should be made very clear that those persons who
prepare and serve our food, who maintain these picturesque grounds
around the Capitol, who repair our office furniture and who work
generally in a non-legislative capacity, should have the same kind
of protection that their counterparts in the executive branch and
private sector have,'' Glenn said. ``It is only fair.''
   And fair, Glenn said, is one thing the present situation is not.
   While Congress has a policy of recruiting minorities and women.
he said, blacks number no more than 50 in the ranks of 2,500 top
professional staffers.
   ``Women have done only slightly better,'' he said. ``Less than 20
percent of the top jobs in the Senate are held by females while 80
percent of the lowest-paying jobs are reserved for female
employees.''
   Specifically, the bill would mandate the provisions of such laws
as the Civil Rights Act of 1966, the Fair Labor Standards Act of
1938, mandating a minimum wage; the Age Discrimination in Employment
Act of 1976, the Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970 and the
Rehabilitation Act of 1973.
   McCain said Congress has enough problems at the moment without
exempting itself from laws that eliminate bias and discrimination.
   Continuing the double standard, he said, ``can only further erode
the confidence of the American people in their government.''

   It's that time of the year when the Agriculture
Department's bug writers turn out reports about the creepy, crawly,
hoppy things that chew on crops and livestock.
   Some of the reports turned out by specialists in the department's
Agricultural Research Service involve space-age technology, foreign
entomological recruiting and even sex, one of the favorite weapons
of pest managers.
   And when a fierce insect predator attacks a lace bug ... well,
the details aren't for small children.
   Take the common grasshopper, a notorious villain with an appetite
for almost anything in the plant world. Or nematodes, ticks, weevils
and sundry other kinds of critters that make farmers, ranchers and
home gardeners fret.
   ``Grasshoppers like to sit in the sun,'' says USDA research
entomologist Raymond I. Carruthers. ``If it's cold, a grasshopper
can't develop quickly. It might not develop to adulthood at all
during its growing season _ from May into September.''
   Don't feel sorry for the hopper, though. Millions of them chew on
pastures each year, destroying almost a fourth of the forage grasses
in 17 of 22 Western states. And migrating grasshoppers also ravage
potatoes, alfalfa and other crops.
   The internal body heat of the sun-loving hoppers serves the
insects another way, by protecting them against certain diseases.
For example, Carruthers said one fungus _ Entomphaga grylli _ would
show promise as a biological control if it could stand the heat.
   Carruthers said the fungus can stand about 100 degrees Fahrenheit
for six to eight hours before starting to die. Grasshoppers in
laboratory tests have been shown to ``actually cure themselves by
basking in the light,'' he said.
   But a type of E. grylli from Australia can stand greater heat
exposure and may be introduced on Western rangeland as early as this
summer, Carruthers said.
   In parts of Texas and other rangeland areas of the West,
snakeweed and other unwanted brush is a costly and persistent
problem for livestock producers. Maybe two South American insects
will help.
   A weevil named Heilipodus ventralis and a moth called Carmenta
haematica attack the roots of snakeweed, a plant that infests 143
million acres in western states.
   Entomologist Jack DeLoach, who works for the USDA agency in
Temple, Texas, said federal approval has been granted to introduce
the weevil into the United States. But the moth is still being
tested, he said.
   Agency scientists are looking at biological controls for brush
because chemicals are too expensive in areas where it takes 20 to 50
acres to provide grazing for one cow for a year, he said.
   Besides snakeweed, which can cause pregnant cows to abort,
targeted brush includes saltcedar, which infests about a million
acres along Western streams, and baccharis, a willow-like shrub
found from Florida to California.
   Other possible brush enemies are being looked at, including some
from Argentina and Brazil, and at least a dozen insect species from
Asia.
   But sometimes a natural ally shows up no farther away than a
potted azalea at the USDA's main research center in Beltsville, Md.
In this case, it was a natural enemy of lace bugs, the most serious
enemies of azaleas.
   Entomologist John W. Neal and colleagues discovered an insect
predator _ Stethoconus japonicus _ in 1985 on a U.S.-grown potted
azalea. Studies since have shown that a single female predator,
which has a needle-like snout, can consume five or six lace bugs
each day. The slightly smaller male handles two or three.
   ``The lace bug doesn't have a chance,'' Neal said. ``The predator
sidles up, undetected, and gives its unsuspecting victim a lethal
injection through its long, needle-like mouth. Holding onto the lace
bug with front legs, the predator then withdraws all body fluids and
tissue, leaving an externally intact but completely drained shell.''
   Down in the Caribbean, researchers have released 5.6 million
hybrid cattle fever ticks on St. Croix Island in the U.S. Virgin
Islands to see if they might be used to keep cattle tick fever from
spreading into the United States along the U.S.-Mexico border.
   The hybrid male ticks are sterile and do not produce sperm, said
entomologist Ron Davey. The females are fertile but pass on the
sterility to male offspring. ``The result is a population crash,''
he said.
   Cattle fever, or babesiosis, kills up to 80 percent of adult
cattle that are infected by it. All U.S. breeds are susceptible,
Davey said, but humans do not get cattle tick fever and are not
bitten by the ticks.
   One of the most encouraging bits of news for many soybean farmers
is a new bean variety that could be available next year. The
variety, Cordell, will be the first commercial soybean resistant to
``Race 5'' nematodes, microscopic worms that infest as much as 70
percent of the soybean acreage in the mid-South and Southeast.
   The so-called cyst nematodes are designated as specific ``races''
because of the types of soybeans in which they reproduce. Lawrence
D. Young, a USDA plant pathologist at Jackson, Tenn., said Cordell
could be suited for planting in Virginia, North Carolina, Tennessee,
southern Missouri, Arkansas, northern Mississippi, Alabama and parts
of South Carolina.

   She hits her textbooks every day, looks forward to
classes resuming and is not on the wanted list, but this university
student lives in constant fear police will come looking for her too.
   ``I have nightmares every night,'' she says, her features
tensing. ``In these dreams they always come to arrest me.''
   This 20-year-old was not a main organizer of the student-led
democracy protests that ended in the bloody onslaught by Chinese
soldiers this month.
   She is not in hiding, and she is not trying to perpetuate the
movement for democratic reforms, a free press and an end to
corruption.
   But she had been deeply involved in the movement that began in
mid-April, reading speeches on her school's loudspeaker system,
spending considerable time with student protesters in Tiananmen
Square and handing out leaflets.
   She also took part in the hunger strike that focused world
attention last month on the few thousand young people occupying
Tiananmen, when supporters swelled the number to 1 million.
   For these reasons she asked that neither she nor her school be
named, though she agreed to speak privately with a reporter in a
secluded location. She said she wanted to talk about what she saw
and experienced _ events the government has spent the last week
vigorously denying.
   ``I saw where two people had been run over by a tank. The bodies
were gone, but some of their insides were still there,'' recalled
the student from a prominent Beijing university.
   She was filmed at the scene by soldiers with video cameras near
Tiananmen the night of June 3 when the army moved in behind
automatic weapons fire, tanks and armored vehicles.
   ``I saw many, many people wounded and taken away on flatbed
tricycles,'' she said. ``When they shot at us, we just dove for the
ground. I'd only seen that in movies before.''
   She is worried also because she has been interviewed on American
and European television networks. After the crackdown, Chinese
television showed footage shot by a U.S. television network of a man
saying thousands were killed at Tiananmen.
   The television commentator called him a ``rumor-monger,'' and
within hours he had been captured and was shown humbly recanting his
account. The government has said 300 people were killed in the
assault, mainly soldiers.
   Independent estimates have put the death toll at up to 3,000,
most of them unarmed civilians.
   The student noted that many compare the current crisis to the
dreaded 1966-76 decade of communist revolutionary turmoil when
workers, soldiers and students took the law into their own hands and
central authority collapsed.
   ``In the Cultural Revolution, Mao Tse-tung pitted the people
against themselves,'' she said. ``Deng Xiaoping (the current senior
leader) cannot do that today: the people are united against
dictatorship and corruption.''
   Her father, an intellectual, recently talked with her about the
terrors of the Cultural Revolution. ``He didn't want to tell me for
several years because he wanted me to stay pure,'' she said. ``But
now he has to tell me because he thinks it is very dangerous for me
with my character because I show my anger and show what I think.''
   Her father told her how many of his friends were arrested because
of just one or two sentences in their diaries or letters that were
perceived as `counterrevolutionary.'
   ``My father told me not to write a diary,'' she said. ``If the
police find it, I'll be arrested.''
   Her diary bears no entries this month for June 3-6. ``I was too
shocked to write anything. Now I write that I'm suspicious of the
party and socialism. I used to think socialism was the only correct
way because we were taught so. We were taught that the party belongs
to the people. But now I'm suspicious of socialism. I'm anti-party.''
   Despite her outspokenness, she says she is not trying to escape.
   ``You can't hide. If you go to the provinces and if they want to
find you they will. My father wanted me to go to my aunt's home in a
northeastern province, but I wouldn't go. My father has calmed down.
He just wants me to shut my mouth and stop writing.''
   She acknowledges the pro-democracy movement is snuffed out and
may not return for years.
   ``A friend thinks it will be one or two years after Deng's death,
but I think things will stay the same after that,'' she said.
``There are other old people in the Central Committee.''
   She referred to the influential octogenarian revolutionaries in
the Communist Party leadership, whom Deng is believed to have lined
up behind his hard-line policy against dissent.
   ``The Chinese government is too powerful,'' the student said.
``They use the army and guns.''
   Last week she and other students put on white shirts with black
armbands to mourn their fallen classmates.
   ``But a student told us it was very dangerous to wear that, that
some people had been arrested for it. He said, `Let's keep our
sorrow in our hearts,''' she said.
   ``It's very tiring to be Chinese, to try and protect yourself, to
hide your feelings, hide your thoughts,'' she sighed. ``I can't bear
the atmosphere. You must be careful about everything. It's
frightening.''

   China's best-known journalist, Liu Binyan,
predicts the current Chinese government will last no more than two
years because of public anger over the country's serious economic
problems.
   Liu, who was expelled from the ruling Communist Party in 1987 for
reporting on government corruption, says he will not go back to
China soon because he probably is on the hard-line government's
wanted list.
   ``I did not consider myself a dissident, but the situation made
me become one. I did not consider myself to be in exile, but it
seems like I have to be in exile,'' he told a news conference Sunday.
   Liu arrived in Hong Kong from the United States on Saturday at
the invitation of the Hong Kong Journalists' Association.
   He said the government will fall ``because of the economic crisis
and the political impact it has already caused.''
   He said people in cities are angered by mounting inflation and
farmers are upset at low grain prices. This anger will mushroom as
news of the June 3-4 massacre in Beijing spreads throughout the
country, he said.
   ``The leaders might not live that long because they are thinking
of dealing with the people all day,'' he said.
   ``The present government has much less credibility than Mao, but
the pressure from the people it is facing is ten times stronger than
what Mao (Tse-tung) had,'' he said late Chinese ruler and the
1966-76 Cultural Revolution that Mao inspired.
   ``I don't believe there will not be any changes in China's
leadership in the next two years,'' he said.
   Despite the bloody crackdown, he said, the student-led
pro-democracy movement succeeded ``because it was the first time in
40 years that students represented the people and showed their
discontent with the government to the whole world.
   ``Among the hundreds of thousands of students, the first and
second generation of political leaders are growing and they are
maturing quickly.
   ``Chinese are not the same as in they were in 1949. They are more
politically mature and will not be fooled,'' he said.
   Liu, 64, wrote for the official Communist Party newspaper
People's Daily before he was expelled for attacking the party and
Marxism.
   He went to the United States in March 1988 and taught at the
University of California at Los Angeles, then went to Harvard
University on a Nieman fellowship.
   He was one of three prominent intellectuals ousted in a party
campaign against supporters of Western ideas. The others are writer
Wang Ruowang and astrophysicist Fang Lizhi.
   Fang and his wife, Li Shuxian, have taken refuge in the U.S.
Embassy in Beijing. Wang is believed to be in China, but his
whereabouts are unknown.
   Liu said authorities probably would kill Fang or student leaders
if they caught them:
   ``They are not kind. They are cruel, hyprocritical and would use
any means to achieve their aims.''

<HEAD>Journalist I.F. Stone Dies at 81</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Writer I.F. Stone, who throughout his fiery 60-year
career took on the political establishment, was remembered upon his
death as ``journalism's Rock of Gibraltar and its unwavering
conscience.''
   He died early Sunday at age 81 of cardiac-related difficulties,
said Brigham and Women's Hospital spokesman Mike MacDonald.
   Isador Feinstein Stone, widely known as ``Izzy,'' devoted 18
years to publishing the muckraking newsletter I.F. Stone's Weekly.
   Everette Dennis, executive director of the Gannett Center for
Media Studies at Columbia University, said Stone's newsletter became
a guiding force for a generation of journalists and activists.
   ``He was an aberrant voice for a long time ... (but) he became a
folk hero,'' said Dennis, who included a chapter on Stone in his
book ``Other Voices: The New Journalism in America.''
   Stone, born Dec. 24, 1907, in Philadelphia, attributed his
independent political spirit to his father, a general dry goods
store owner in Haddonfield, N.J.
   Despite his reputation as a gadfly, Stone's dogged pursuit of
facts and his refusal to pander to any political faction won him
respect. He lost 400 readers after a 1956 report from the Soviet
Union in which he said workers there were more exploited than those
in the West.
   But he delighted in caustically attacking American conservatives.
He once called Ronald Reagan ``the TV Tarzan of Republican
politicos.''
   Stone, who lived in Washington, spent his career pouring through
government documents and challenging the status quo. He pressed for
civil rights and was an early critic of U.S. involvement in Vietnam.
   ``He invented a kind of investigative reading,'' said Victor
Navasky, editor in chief of The Nation. ``Every week in his I.F.
Stone's Weekly he would find things in the Congressional Record that
other people had not seen or didn't understand the significance of.
But he would, and those items would frequently be front-page news
stories.''
   Initial subscribers to the weekly, founded in 1953, included
Albert Einstein, Bertrand Russell and Eleanor Roosevelt. By 1971,
when it had become a biweekly, 70,000 subscribed.
   ``For over 50 years he was both journalism's Rock of Gibraltar
and its unwavering conscience,'' said Ralph Nader, the consumer
advocate and close friend. ``While others in his profession cowered,
he stood to challenge the abusers of power wherever they came from.''
   ``Izzy set a standard to which all journalists should adhere; it
was one that all public malefactors abhorred,'' said John Kenneth
Galbraith, the Harvard University economist.
   During Stone's long career, his investigative reports included
the 1956 discovery that nuclear tests could be detected thousands of
miles away _ a revelation that proved crucial to the debate over
whether a test ban could be verified.
   The roots of Stone's activism can be traced to his teen-age
years, when he became an avid reader. Authors such as Jack London
and Prince Peter Kropotkin, the Russian anarchist, turned him toward
political radicalism, he said.
   When Stone was 14, he and another youth published the
Progressive, a 5-cent monthly that supported Gandhi and the League
of Nations. They had 500 subscribers. He also became a reporter for
the Haddonfield Press and a correspondent for the Camden
Courier-Post.
   After attending the University of Pennsylvania, he spent his
early career reporting for, among others, The Philadelphia Inquirer
and the New York Post before moving in 1938 to an editorship and
eventually a commentator's role at The Nation.
   In 1952, amid the recriminations of the McCarthy years, Stone
published ``The Hidden History of the Korean War'' which suggested
that the war was started not by North Korean aggression but as the
result of a plot by South Korea and the United States.
   Unable to find regular work in the early 1950s, Stone started his
weekly from Washington with his wife's help.
   Eighteen years ago, failing eyesight and heart trouble forced him
to abandon the newsletter. Stone, who was nearly blind, had in
recent years taken more interest in ancient Greece than in the
backrooms of the nation's capital.
   He recently published ``The Trial of Socrates,'' a book he spent
15 years researching. The author learned classical Greek to piece
together one of his final ``scoops'' _ a highly critical account of
the Greek philosopher and teacher who was sentenced to death 2,500
years ago.
   ``He obviously had an extraordinary intellect, but he had a will
that was the equal of his talent. It was a form of intellectual

<HEAD>Middle Schools Ill-Equipped to Aid Early Adolescents, Study Says</HEAD>

   Most American middle schools are too large and
impersonal to meet adolescents' intellectual and emotional needs,
and the result for many students may be a ``life on the edge of
society,'' according to a new report.
   Middle grade schools could be a strong positive influence on
adolescents as they face a world in which they are tempted to
experiment with alcohol, sex and drugs, according to the report by a
task force of the Carnegie Council on Adolescent Development.
   Instead, ``many large middle grade schools function as mills that
contain and process endless streams of students. Within them are
masses of anonymous youth,'' said the study. ``Such settings
virtually guarantee that the intellectual and emotional needs of
youth will go unmet.''
   The report, titled ``Turning Points: Preparing American Youth for
the 21st Century,'' was released Sunday on the first day of a
three-day meeting sponsored by the Carnegie Corp. of New York to
focus on ways to improve mid-level schools.
   Of the 28 million U.S. children between ages 10 and 17,
one-fourth may face futures in ``serious jeopardy'' because of the
consequences of school dropout, drug use or early, unprotected sex,
the study said, citing research conducted for an upcoming book,
``Adolescents at Risk,'' by Joy G. Dryfoos. Another 7 million
children may be at moderate risk, it said.
   Students who drop out of school or emerge semiliterate cannot
compete for jobs requiring literate, technically trained workers.
   ``What is left for these young men and women is a life on the
edge of society,'' the report said.
   The study said middle schools should be restructured on a ``more
human scale'' by:
   _Creating smaller environments for learning by dividing large
schools into ``schools within schools'' where children know each
other and their teachers better.
   _Teaching a core academic program aimed at producing students who
are literate, understand the sciences and have a sense of health,
ethics and citizenship.
   _Eliminating use of ``tracking'' students by achievement level,
which the report said essentially dooms many children to failure.
   _Giving teachers and administrators more creative power, and
hiring teachers who specialize in dealing with young adolescents.
   _Involving parents and community leaders in the schools.
   _Boosting students' health and fitness with more in-school
programs and by helping those who need public health care to get it.
   The study suggested dividing schools into smaller communities of
200 to 500 students who represent a cross-section of the school in
terms of ethnic and socioeconomic background and intellectual
ability. Those students would be teamed with a set of teachers who
would work together to provide a more unified learning environment.
   For example, separate classes in English, arts, history and
social studies could be organized around a single theme such as
immigration, the report said. Students should be given long-term
writing assignments and national achievement tests should be
expanded to judge students on the basis of an overall work
portfolio, it said.
   Some classes should be longer than the 40- to 50-minute norm, and
each student ``should be well known by at least one adult'' at
school who can provide counseling and academic help, the report
recommended.
   The result, the report said, should be ``a thinking, productive,
caring and healthy person who takes seriously the responsibility of
good citizenship.''
   ``Our vision is of such an outcome for every youth of the nation,
not just for those more advantaged than others,'' it said.
   Albert Shanker, president of the American Federation of Teachers,
praised the report, saying it ``recognizes it is not too late to
improve the educational opportunities of those students who are
already in school.''
   National Education Association President Mary Hatwood Futrell
said she agreed with the report's recommendations, ``but the reality
is that we must lay the groundwork for school success long before
these tumultuous years.''
   ``We must begin earlier than grades six, seven or eight,'' she
said. ``We must prime our youngest students for academic success.''

   Korsair, a valuable European show dog
missing for a week, had only to hear a few words of French to
realize he was back among friends.
   ``As soon as I started speaking to him in French, he came right
up to me and buried his head in my side,'' said Gerald A. Rousseau,
a dog trainer who took command of the 3-year-old Belgian Malinois
after he was captured by police.
   The dog, valued as high as $50,000, slipped from his cage while
he and his French owner were changing flights at O'Hare
International Airport on June 12.
   Korsair was spotted Sunday morning in the back yard of a Mount
Prospect home, a few miles from the airport.
   Police officer Jim Lange won Korsair over with a few dog biscuits
and was able to slip a leash over the animal's head.
   An examination by a vet showed the dog had gashes on his front
legs and inside an ear, but otherwise was alert and in good shape,
said Rousseau.
   ``As soon as I saw him, I ran him through a series of commands in
French: heel, sit, bound, jump, stay,'' he said. ``That and a tattoo
proved he was Korsair.''
   Bob Rankin, 61, didn't know the dog understood only French when
he spotted the animal lying in his backyard, and it started snarling
at him.
   ``I don't know a French dog from a Polish dog, especially when he
bares his teeth at me,'' Rankin, a roofer, said Sunday night.
   The breed is a kind of sheepdog resembling a German shepherd.
   Korsair is highly trained and was being transported across the
nation by owner Daniel Paul to be shown at seminars on training dogs.
   Rousseau said the dog probably gashed his leg by climbing or
jumping over the barb wire-topped fence that rings the 7,000-acre
airport.
   While the dog appeared a little thin, Rousseau said he's sure the
animal has been finding some food.
   ``I'm certain he either caught rabbits or other wild game or
found food going through garbage,'' he said.
   Rousseau said Korsair's owner was elated when he heard the dog
had been found.
   ``He started crying,'' Rousseau said.
   Paul said the dog is worth $20,000 because of his pedigree, stud
value and championship record, but Louis Auslander, chairman of the
American Kennel Club, said it could be worth $50,000.
   United Airlines, which was transporting the owner and dog when
Korsair disappeared, had offered a reward of several hundred dollars
for his return.
   The police department is not allowed to accept the money, so it
will be donated toward the medical expenses of 9-year-old Joshua
Mayo of Mount Prospect, who was struck by a car and critically
injured Friday.

   Congress this week delves into issues involving
America's advanced computing capabilities, including sweeping Senate
legislation that would establish a high-speed network to link the
nation's supercomputers.
   Sen. Albert Gore Jr., D-Tenn., chief sponsor of the $1.75 billion
measure, said such a network could be as important to the country's
information future as the interstate highway system was in building
up U.S. transportation over the past three decades.
   ``High-capacity fiber optic networks will be the information
superhighways of tomorrow,'' he declared.
   Gore added that ``the nation which most completely assimilates
high-performance computing into its economy will very likely emerge
as the dominant intellectual, economic and technological force in
the next century.''
   In addition to the supercomputer network, the Tennessee
Democrat's bill also calls for a coordinated national strategy on
high-performance computer technology as well as increased funding
for research and development of computer equipment and software.
   The Gore legislation is to be taken up at a hearing Wednesday of
the Senate Commerce subcommittee on science, technology and space.
   Sen. James M. Jeffords, R-Vt., a co-sponsor of the measure, said
``the United States is recognized as the world leader in
supercomputing, but this doesn't mean that countries like France,
West Germany and Japan like it. Foreign competition is growing.
   ``One way to ensure that our pre-eminence in supercomputing is
not wasted is to make the data readily accessible to everyone that
can benefit from it,'' Jeffords said. ``If we bring academia,
industry and government together, we're going to see results.''
   Another co-sponsor, Sen. Dave Durenberger, R-Minn., noted that
supercomputers were among items singled out in the Bush
administration's recent ``Super 301'' action citing Japan for unfair
trading practices.
   ``We make the best supercomputers in the world, and there is no
reason the Japanese should refuse to give serious consideration to
our supercomputers simply because Japan wants to develop its own
supercomputer industry,'' Durenberger said.
   The status and future of supercomputing in the United States is
also to be the focus of a hearing Tuesday by the House Science
subcommittee on science, research and technology.
   Marc Rotenberg, Washington representative of Computer
Professionals for Social Responsibility, a public interest group
based in Palo Alto, Calif., called the Gore legislation ``good
news.''
   ``We need to be reconsidering funding priorities in computer
science,'' Rotenberg said. ``Sen. Gore's bill would strengthen our
basic research, in research institutions across the country, and
also develop infrastructure to make it possible for systems that are
already in place to be accessible to more users.''
   Most supercomputer networks currently run 2,000 times slower than
the 3 gigabit per second network which Gore's measure aims to create
by 1996.
   The bill embodies many of the recommendations set forth in a
November 1987 report issued by the White House Office of Science and
Technology Policy.
   That report concluded that ``a strong domestic high-performance
computer industry is essential for maintaining U.S. leadership in
critical national security areas and in broad sectors of the
civilian economy.''

<HEAD>Child Care Legislation Before Congress This Week</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Legislation for a national child care program
is before the Senate this week, but the bill faces Bush
administration opposition unless provisions for taxpayer subsidies
are eliminated.
   The multibillion dollar proposal would offer parents both
subsidies and federal tax credits for child care, while the
administration favors a program financed entirely by tax credits.
   Senate Republican leader Bob Dole of Kansas says a child care
program is ``a high priority with the administration,'' but added
GOP senators will try to substitute the tax credit payment plan.
   Senators this week also will consider a $4.5 billion
authorization for the State Department, the Agency for International
Development, the U.S. Information Agency and other related agencies.
   The Senate Foreign Relations Committee sent the bill to the floor
knowing that it authorizes more funds than permitted by a ceiling
set by Congress and the White House.
   The committee included an amendment authorizing $194 million to
build a transmitter in Israel for Radio Liberty which broadcasts to
the Soviet Union.
   But the panel declined to fund the transmitter by taking the
money from a fund intended to pay past and present U.S. dues to the
United Nations.
   The House, meanwhile, may resume contentious debate on a
supplemental spending plan providing more than $3 billion in extra
funds following the failure of House-Senate negotiators to agree on
whether to provide more money this year for the war on drugs.
   The $822 million House-passed provision to increase anti-drug
spending is the largest of several items left unresolved.
   Chairman Robert C. Byrd, D-W-Va., of the Senate Appropriations
Committee, contends the extra money isn't needed and the Bush
administration threatens a presidential veto if it is included.
   But House Democrats insist the money be included as a test of the
administration's commitment to battling drug abuse.
   Under the Senate child care compromise reached last week,
regulations would be set by the states although federal guidelines
would be drafted for states to follow if they wished.
   The revised plan permits vouchers to be used to pay for child
care at church-run centers if the money is not used ``in a manner
inconsistent with the Constitution'' which mandates a separation
between church and state.
   A tax-credit package added by the Senate Finance Committee also
was added to the bill.
   It would make the existing dependent-care tax credit refundable
in advance. Also a new credit would give back up to $500 to help
families with annual incomes of less than $21,000 pay for their
children's health insurance.

   American manufacturers of products ranging from
lawn mowers to wine coolers are being hit by extra costs due to
efforts in western Europe to create a single market among 12
countries, the U.S. Commerce Department reported.
   The department is distributing an analysis of 66 directives
proposed or adopted in the European Economic Community as part of
the plan to break down barriers to internal trade by 1992. Nearly
300 directives are included in the program.
   ``The Commerce Department believes that the completion of the
internal market should benefit U.S. companies doing business in
Europe,'' it said. ``However, there is a danger if the 1992 program
is implemented in less than open fashion.''
   U.S. Trade Representative Carla A. Hills already has complained
about a proposal to guarantee a proportion of television time for
programs produced in Europe. That would limit the number of American
programs that could be used. U.S. officials call this a ``local
content'' requirement, to which free traders object on principle.
   Jacques Delors, the head of the Community's joint executive, was
in Washington last week explaining to President Bush and others the
French view that this is a cultural matter, not a trade matter.
   Community officials and their American critics are giving major
attention to the setting of European standards for industrial
products. Products that meet these standards will be freely saleable
in the 12 countries. Those that do not meet them, will not.
   U.S. companies want to take part in setting the standards. The
Europeans say that only American companies with subsidiaries in
Europe can do that. More talks are scheduled between U.S. and
European officials on this point, but some directives have already
been adopted.
   Take lawn mowers. A directive that goes into effect July 1, 1991,
limits the noise that can be made by motorized cylinder lawn mowers.
A rule in effect since 1987 has made U.S. manufacturers of rotary
lawn mowers either lower the speed of their equipment or redesign
the engines. Sales have not been hit _ U.S. exports of rotary lawn
mowers to the 12 countries went up 221 percent between 1986 and 1988.
   But the Commerce Department said lower speeds could hurt the
performance of American mowers and redesigning engines could bring
increased costs.
   Or take wine coolers. On Jan. 1, the 12 countries banned the use
of the 11.5 ounce bottle current in the United States, the report
said. The Community wants a bottle containing 14 ounces.
   ``The ... bottle would be either too fat or too tall for existing
U.S. production lines ...,'' the report complained. ``The U.S.
bottler would incur the added cost of changing production lines and
maintaining an inventory of another size bottle.''
   The report said the European directives also have or would affect
telecommunications, auto production and forklift manufacturers.

   Hy Gardner, whose revealing newspaper columns and
radio and television interviews with Broadway stars won him
admiration and popularity, has died. He was 80.
   Gardner died of pneumonia Saturday at North Shore Hospital in
Miami, where he lived.
   Born in Manhattan, Gardner decided early on that he wanted to be
an entertainment columnist so he contributed items to established
writers.
   Later, he tried to get hired by The Herald Tribune but was
refused.
   He began writing a sample column daily, had it professionally
printed, and sent it to the newspaper's executives at their homes.
He wrote at the bottom of the column: ``Excerpts from a column that
should be running daily in The New York Herald Tribune.''
   The Tribune hired him in 1951 and he wrote the Broadway column
until the paper ceased publication in 1966.
   While writing the column, he began a television talk show called
``Hy Gardner Calling,'' in which he interviewed celebrities in their
homes or in the studio.
   He also was part of the original celebrity panel of the
television program ``To Tell The Truth.''
   Since 1967, he had been writing a syndicated gossip column,
``Glad You Asked That,'' with his wife, Marilyn.
   He is also survived by two sons, Ralph, of Palmyra, Va., and
Jeffrey, of Miami, five grandchildren and one great-grandchild.

<HEAD>Report Blames Secrecy For Root Cause of Weapons Plant Crisis</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Congressional investigators report that
unchallenged secrecy at nuclear weapons plants allowed the Energy
Department and its private contractors to neglect a need for
improved health and safety programs.
   The safety problems, which came to light mostly over the past two
years, were aggravated by a lack of outside scrutiny and effective
oversight from the Energy Department, which pays private companies
to run the facilities, the congressional report issued Sunday said.
   ``This penchant for secrecy and the classified nature of the
process of making nuclear weapons contributed to a mindset of
emphasizing production at the expense of health and safety,'' the
report said.
   A variety of congressional committees and independent panels have
been studying problems in the weapons complex, which includes 16
major facilities in 12 states. Some of key facilities are closed
down for repairs and improvements.
   The latest blow to the weapons program was struck at the Rocky
Flats plutonium fabrication plant, near Boulder, Colo., where FBI
agents swooped in June 6 to check out allegations of a cover-up of
illegal storage and waste disposal practices.
   The Energy Department subsequently froze nearly $5 million in
bonus payments to the operator of the Rocky Flats facility, Rockwell
International Corp.
   The bonuses were to cover work performed between September 1988
and March 1989, but have been ``frozen indefinitely,'' according to
W. Henson Moore, Energy Department deputy director.
   ``They're not going to get that money until we know more,'' Moore
said Friday.
   Energy Secretary James D. Watkins is putting together a
masterplan for modernizing the complex and cleaning up the
radioactive and toxic wastes that have contaminated the sites and
surrounding areas during 40 years of bomb making. He says national
security may be jeopardized if improvements aren't made quickly.
   Estimates of the rebuilding and cleanup cost range up to $150
billion over 30 years.
   ``Obsessive secrecy and lack of outside oversight have been
hallmarks of the nuclear weapons program since its beginning as the
wartime Manhattan Engineering District'' in the early 1940s, Rep.
John D. Dingell, D-Mich., said in a letter accompanying the
investigators' report.
   The inquiry was conducted over three years by the House Energy
and Commerce subcommittee on oversight and investigations. Dingell
is chairman of the subcommittee as well as the full Energy and
Commerce committee.
   The investigators listed a variety of incidents and shortcomings
in the weapons complex that have been documented by other agencies
in recent years.
   They include:
   _The use of illegal drugs at some of the most sensitive weapons
facilities, including the Los Alamos National Laboratory in New
Mexico, which designs and tests nuclear arms; the Hanford Nuclear
Reservation, near Richland, Wash., which is involved in a variety of
nuclear materials production, and the Oak Ridge Y-12 plant in
Tennessee, which makes weapons components and uranium.
   _Inadequate fire protection at the Savannah River Site, near
Aiken, S.C., which is the nation's only source of tritium, a
radioactive gas used to make warheads. The report cited a 1986
federal review of the problem that said the only fire-fighting
device available at one nuclear reactor there was an ordinary garden
hose.
   _Poor training of safety inspectors at Hanford and Savannah
River. It took the Energy Department five years to discover that
several inspectors at Hanford had not been properly certified for
their jobs because of improperly graded tests or a lack of
experience.
   The investigators said there had been some signs of hope for
improvement since Watkins took office in March but that serious
shortcomings are still pervasive.
   ``The problems cited in this report indicate a breakdown in the
DOE's entire system to insure compliance with its own policy of
producing nuclear weapons without undue risk to its workers and the
public at large,'' the report said.

   This Media General-Associated Press poll is based
on telephone interviews May 5-13 with 1,084 adults in the
continental United States.
   Phone numbers were selected randomly and interviews were
conducted with the adult who had the most recent birthday, a random
phenomenon.
   The results were weighted to adjust for variations in the sample.
The poll has a 3 percentage point margin of error, meaning that 19
of 20 times its findings should be within 3 points of the result if
every adult American were asked the same questions.
   The error margin is larger for subgroups; it is 6 points, for
example, for respondents who have children in public schools.
   There are other sources of potential error in polls, including
the wording and order of questions. These are the questions in this
poll; because of rounding, sums may not total 100:
   1. How would you rate the quality of the public schools in your
community _ excellent, good, only fair or poor? Excellent: 15
percent. Good: 38. Fair: 28. Poor: 15. Don't know or no answer: 4.
   2a. Do you think spending on public schools should increase,
decrease or remain the same? Increase: 66. Decrease: 3. Same: 28.
DK-NA: 3.
   b. (If ``increase'') Would you be willing to pay higher taxes for
that? Yes: 91. No: 8. DK-NA: 1.
   c. (If ``increase'') Where should most of the additional money
come from _ the federal, state or local government? Federal: 32.
State: 41. Local: 17. DK-NA: 11.
   3. Do you think standardized test scores reflect how well
students are learning in school, or not? Yes: 37. No: 54. DK-NA: 9.
   4. How would you rate the job the public schools in your
community do at teaching students basic facts and skills _
excellent, good, only fair or poor? Excellent: 12. Good: 40. Fair:
31. Poor: 13. DK-NA: 5.
   5. How would you rate the job the public schools in your
community do at teaching students how to think and reason _
excellent, good, only fair or poor? Excellent: 7. Good: 32. Fair:
35. Poor: 19. DK-NA: 7.
   6. Do you think that raising teacher salaries would attract
better qualified people to the teaching profession? Yes: 66. No: 29.
DK-NA: 5.
   7. Do you do think the public schools in your community make
subjects interesting for students, or not? Yes: 51. No: 29. DK-NA:
21.
   8. Some people say parents should be able to choose which public
school their child attends. Others say that would take resources
away from schools that need the most improvement. Do you think
parents should be able to choose which public school their child
attends, or not? Yes: 58. No: 37. DK-NA: 5.
   9. Would you support or oppose year-round public school, with
vacations scattered throughout the year in place of the long summer
vacation? Support: 44. Oppose: 49. DK-NA: 7.
   10. Do you think President Bush will be able to improve public
education in this country, or not? Yes: 46. No: 37. DK-NA: 18.

   China's disdainful response to world criticism
over its bloody crackdown on student protesters is in keeping with a
2,000-year tradition of insularity and a sense of righteousness.
   China long assumed a vast gulf between itself, called the
``central country'' in Chinese, and other countries, which were
considered uncivilized. Economic self-sufficiency enabled it to
maintain this view as the limits of communication preserved
ignorance about the rest of the world.
   But China no longer is self-sufficient and foreign opinion cannot
be blocked out.
   Foreign investment and technology are key to its economic
development plans and China has come to rely on some imports. Even
while denouncing the United States for sheltering a leading
dissident in its Beijing embassy, China imported extra tons of U.S.
wheat to make up for its own poor harvest.
   Since senior leader Deng Xiaoping began economic reforms a decade
ago, nearly 10,000 foreign companies have set up joint ventures in
China with a total investment of $12 billion. Many manufacture goods
for export, generating hard currency China needs for its
modernization.
   Chinese leaders have said repeatedly since the army attacked
unarmed protesters in Bejing on June 3-4, killing hundreds, that
they want and expect foreign countries to continue trade and
investment. But they also have reiterated they will not accept
foreign criticism of the bloody crackdown.
   ``We hope that all countries that wish to keep and develop
friendly relations with China will take a long-term view and avoid
doing anything to hurt the feelings of the Chinese people,'' Premier
Li Peng told top party officials in a recent speech.
   Government spokesman Yuan Mu was blunter, telling a news
conference, ``We are not spineless people. We are not afraid ...
(of) condemnation or sanction.''
   It has gotten both. The United States cut off military sales and
contacts; France and the Netherlands froze relations. Japan, China's
largest single-country source of aid, put off new development
assistance loans. Canada and France temporarily withdrew their
ambassadors.
   Several countries canceled planned high-level official exchanges.
   It is not the first time foreign governments have criticized
Deng's policies. The U.S. Congress has passed repeated resolutions
criticizing China for opening fire on pro-independence protesters in
Tibet over the past two years.
   However, it is the first time condemnation of China has been so
nearly universal. Even Hungary's Communist government expressed
outrage and the Soviet parliament urged ``wisdom, reason and a
weighted approach.''
   It also is the first time that criticism has been backed by
action.
   A speech Deng gave in 1987 indicates he may not have expected
that. He said that after the last large-scale arrests of
pro-democracy activists in 1979, China suffered no ``discredit.''
``On the contrary, the prestige of the country is steadily
growing,'' he said.
   China also has emerged unscathed from controversies over its
foreign policy, such as its arms sales to Iran and support in
Cambodia of the Khmer Rouge, whose forces killed hundreds of
thousands of countrymen while in power from 1975-78.
   The decision of the top government spokesman, Yuan Mu, to give a
rare interview to the U.S. television network NBC last week may have
been an effort to counter the avalanche of foreign condemnation.
   In it, he reiterated the government's position that the army
fired on the crowds June 3-4 only after provocation. He condemned
foreign news reports as distortions and suggested that even foreign
film of the killing was fabricated.
   China could have avoided much of the bad press abroad if it had
expelled all foreign reporters ahead of time. But thousands of
foreign businessmen and diplomats who also could bear witness would
have had to be expelled as well.
   What's more, such a move would have been an admission that China
had something to hide. Chinese officials apparently believe that if
they reiterate the official explanation often enough and wait long
enough, foreign businessmen and diplomats will trickle back.
   They may be right. A survey of 116 American business executives
before the crackdown found 55 percent believed China would become a
more attractive market. After the shooting, 67 executives were asked
again. Fifty-three percent still agreed.

<TEXT>
   A hot item at Beacon restaurant
is a T-shirt bearing the slogan, ``Lake Tahoe, A Sunny Place for
Shady People.''
   Such humor is common in this wooded tourist haven following
charges of money laundering and conspiracy against Mayor Terry
Trupp, 46, and his fourth wife, Kimberly, 24.
   Hangouts like Ernie's Coffee Shop and the South Lake Tahoe
Country Club have been rife with gossip and jokes about the arrests.
   Not many are surprised. For years, people have wondered how Trupp
afforded a Maserati and an airplane.
   ``He was not as much a part of the community as many of us are.
He didn't belong to the Rotary Club,'' said John Wynn, president of
the Chamber of Commerce.
   ``He drove fast cars, rode motorcycles and was rather grandiose
in talking about his international business dealings.''
   When pressed about his income, Trupp often said he dealt in
foreign currency.
   But in an affidavit accompanying his request for a public
defender, Trupp listed his only source of income as the $300 a month
and medical expenses he receives from the city.
   Nestled in the snow-capped Sierra Nevada of eastern California,
this town of 30,000 residents hardly shows the seamy underside
brought to light by a recent sting operation code named ``Deep
Snow.''
   Trupp told undercover Internal Revenue Service agents he had a
``method to launder money out of the country that left no paper
trail and no tax liability and that the system had been in place for
20 years,'' according to one affidavit.
   The 20-month investigation resulted in the arrest of the Trupps
and 17 others, including a chiropractor. Also arrested was Robert
Moon, accused of being a drug courier who was picked up by agents as
he prepared to tee off in a golf tournament.
   The ring was accused of laundering $750,000; the mayor laundered
$108,000, authorities said.
   Many say Trupp's alleged involvement is symptomatic of the city's
darker ties to Nevada gaming. Trupp was a regular at Lilly's
nightclub, wearing gold chains, slicked-back hair and pompadour.
People say he called himself a rock 'n' roller.
   ``The casinos control some of these city council members _ not
directly but they do it through campaign contributions,'' said Tom
Martens of the environmental group, The League to Save South Lake
Tahoe.
   ``We get all the social problems from the casinos. We get the
drug problems, the alcohol problems and the gambling problems _ all
caused by the casinos. And they don't contribute money into
California to solve these problems.''
   City officials have sought to distance themselves from Trupp.
They called him a skilled politician, but no one interviewed said
they knew him well.
   ``I didn't know him outside of the city council _ we didn't move
in the same circles,'' said Acting Mayor Neva Roberts, who begins a
regular term as mayor in July, when Trupp's term would have ended.
``I didn't know any of his friends.''
   Roberts and Councilman Norm Woods said the scandal will leave no
scars.
   ``Of course we were all shocked,'' said Woods, who has known
Trupp 11 years. ``But this is an isolated case, not a reflection on
the city as a whole. We'll get over it.''
   But Martens, who often disagreed with the pro-growth Trupp over
environmental issues, said the case has undercovered ills in
government.
   ``I haven't heard anyone say there's something wrong with a
government system that allows a guy like this to get elected for 11
years or there's something wrong with a government that allows him
to put no income on his campaign and political reporting forms,'' he
said.
   The rumor mills, meantime, are keeping the issue alive.
   ``Since it happened, it's all we talk about,'' said Charlene
Wightman, a bartender. ``This is better that watching `All My
Children.'''

<HEAD>Hunters Say Bush Proposal Won't Affect Sport, but They Oppose It</HEAD>

   In the mountains of Montana, where elk
hunting puts meat on the table, gun enthusiasts acknowledge
President Bush's proposal to limit the firepower of semiautomatic
weapons won't affect their sport directly.
   Still, many oppose the new legislation because, as one said, it's
a ``foot-in-the-door kind of thing.''
   Bush, a lifetime member of the National Rifle Association,
entered the White House saying he didn't believe in restrictions on
semiautomatic weapons.
   But in March, following outrage over the slaying of five
schoolchildren in Stockton, Calif., by a man with an AK-47 rifle,
Bush banned imports of assault-style firearms. Last month, he called
for a 15-shot limit on magazine size.
   Montana hunters take their weapons seriously, befitting a state
where big game is big business: Non-resident elk licenses sell for a
crisp $450 and hunters from throughout the world stalk mountain goat
and bighorn sheep.
   Sportsmen in Montana primarily use high-powered, bolt-action
rifles where accuracy over long distances is more important than the
number of shots fired.
   The idea of spraying a whitetail deer, an elk or a moose with 30
fast shots from an assault rifle is mind-boggling to the average
Montana hunter, who hopes to have meat left to eat.
   They also said the big ``banana clips'' of ammunition are heavy
and cumbersome, reducing a rifle's accuracy.
   ``You don't go big game hunting with 15-round clips. Most have
four or five rounds in their rifle and a spare clip in their
pocket,'' said Kalispell gun dealer B.J. Lupton. ``The sportsman is
concerned about doing things as cleanly as possible and in a
sportsmanlike way, so he doesn't go hunting with a 15-round clip
anyway.''
   The big clips ``defeat the purpose of a sporting firearm: to kill
cleanly with one shot,'' said Al Bishop, a Billings attorney and
former member of the Montana Fish and Game Commission.
   But in a state where many believe the right to bear arms was the
11th Commandment, the president's proposal still meets opposition.
   ``I think we've got our issues tangled a little bit,'' Lupton
said. ``The sportsmen in Montana are not concerned about 15-round
clips for hunting, but I think they may be concerned with an
invasion of their constitutional right to bear arms.''
   Paul Berg, a retired wildlife biologist of Billings, wonders what
good Bush's proposal will do. ``It's just a foot-in-the-door kind of
thing to take all our guns away from us in time,'' he said.
   David Scott, president of the Billings Rod and Gun Club, also
argued that the 15-round limit is merely a starting point for people
who would outlaw guns completely.
   ``It may solve some problems to limit the clips to 15, but still,
you're starting to infringe on what you can own and what you can't
own,'' Scott added.
   ``It's a law without a purpose, and a law that cannot be
enforced,'' said Rocky Hook of Missoula. ``Its only effect would be
against law-abiding people. If it were passed, I guarantee you you'd
still see drug dealers with banana clips coming out of their Uzis.''
   Two big-clip rifles, the Ruger Mini-14 and the Colt AR-16 _ the
civilian version of the Army's M-16 _ are popular with some varmint
hunters precisely because they carry big clips.
   Having up to 30 shots is handy for shooting fast-moving coyotes,
gophers and squirrels, Hook said.
   Dick Pedersen of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms has
said his bureau is concerned about guns with ``pistol grips, which
are used predominantly for firing from the hip, bayonet lugs that
allow a bayonet to be fixed, collapsible shoulder stocks, for
close-in combat-type shooting and concealability, threaded barrels
which could accept silencers and large-capacity magazines.''
   The Bush administration is waiting for the bureau to complete a
study to determine whether the weapons are used for sports, as
required for imports.
   But the NRA contends Americans shouldn't have to prove their guns
are used for sports, because the Second Amendment guarantees the
right to bear arms.
   Officials such as Baltimore County (Md.) Police Chief Neil Behan
see it differently, however, because of increasing crime rate
involving assault weapons.
   ``If we have to sacrifice someone's minor recreation endeavor in
order (to save lives), I think that's a sacrifice we can make in
this country,'' Behan said.

   Share prices on the Tokyo Stock Exchange fell
Monday, while the dollar rebounded against the Japanese yen after a
sharp drop on Friday.
   The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues lost 41.99
points, or 0.13 percent, and closed at 33,013.18. It added 142.08
points Friday, when it closed at 33,055.17.
   The dollar opened at 144.20 yen, down 0.85 yen from Friday's
145.05-yen close, but then climbed during the day's trading and
closed at 145.50 yen, up 0.45 yen from Friday's finish.
   On Friday, the dollar fell 6.25 yen.
   Goshin Mizuno, a dealer with Nomura Securities, said that
although the Nikkei index fell Monday, there was a considerable
volume of transactions.
   ``The most important factor is that financial authorities
including the Bank of Japan have coordinated their intervention
activities,'' he said.
   As a result, speculation has decreased and sharp fluctuations
have become fewer, Mizuno said. He added that transactions centered
around capital investment issues such as Yamatake-Honeywell.
   He also said there would not be many announcements of important
economic indexes this week. Such announcements often affect the
direction of trading.
   On the foreign exchange market, the Bank of Japan intervened but
without much effect, dealers said.
   ``Many dealers were buying dollars today to cut losses,'' said
one dealer from Daiwa Bank, who spoke on condition of anonymity.

   Space shuttle astronaut S. David Griggs was
performing aerial stunts before his World War II vintage plane
crashed in a wheat field, killing him, witnesses said.
   Investigators waded into the knee-high stalks of wheat as they
tried to determine what caused Saturday morning's crash.
   Griggs, 49, who was scheduled to pilot a November shuttle
mission, was practicing with the propeller-driven North American T-6
trainer for a weekend air show, witnesses and investigators said.
   ``He was cutting up, flying upside down and all kinds of ways,
every kind of way I've ever seen them fly those things,'' said
William H. Wooden, who was working in his yard when the plane
crashed.
   Wooden said he heard the engine stop.
   ``It looked like he was clowning around,'' said Otis Barker, who
was working in his garden about 150 yards from the crash site, about
20 miles west of Memphis, Tenn. ``He'd go up, then shut off the
motor and fire it up again.''
   Sandra Pearson, a Federal Aviation Administration supervisor,
said Sunday the cause of the crash was not yet apparent.
   The FAA, the National Transportation Safety Board and National
Aeronautics and Space Administration had investigators at the site,
according to the FAA's Peter Kerwin.
   Robert Hudson, organizer of the air show at Clarksville, said the
astronaut's death left him and other pilots shaken. Hudson said he
was told that Griggs, who logged 9,500 hours of flying, ``could
really fly the airplane real well and that everybody would be
pleased. It was exciting.
   ``Of course, he didn't make it. It was a real shock to us,''
Hudson said.
   ``It kind of put a lump in my throat, if not my stomach. But we
still had the show to do, we couldn't call it off. We went ahead and
we had a good show, but there was that fear I was feeling, and you
know, there's a certain amount of risk anyway,'' Hudson said.
   The stunt plane was registered to Greg McNeely, a friend of
Griggs' who was to have participated in the show, the FAA said.
   The McNeelys were not available for comment Sunday. A woman who
answered the phone at McNeely Charter Service said she had been told
to refer questions to NASA.
   A NASA spokesman, Jeff Carr, said the agency did not restrict
what the astronauts did in their spare time.
   ``You can't lock these guys in their houses. These guys have
thousands of hours of flying experience. They take a greater risk
driving down the Gulf Freeway in Houston than by flying. There are
no restrictions on piloting,'' Carr said from Houston.
   The crash would not affect November's launch, and a replacement
would be named within two weeks, Carr said.
   Flying was a hobby for Griggs, who served as a mission specialist
on the shuttle Discovery in April 1985, according to a NASA
biography. He had been an astronaut since August 1979, the space
agency said.
   Griggs, a native of Portland, Ore., was appointed chief of the
Shuttle Training Aircraft Operations Office in January 1976, with
responsibilities that included operational use of the shuttle
trainer. He served in the Navy, including two combat tours in
Southeast Asia, and a stint as a Navy test pilot.
   Griggs, who lived in the Houston area, is survived by his wife,
Karen, and daughters, Alison Marie, 17, and Carre Anne, 15.

   House Speaker Thomas Foley says it's time for
President Bush to begin speaking out more forcefully in opposition
to the harsh Chinese crackdown on pro-democracy dissidents.
   As China's hard-line leadership hands out death sentences to
dissident leaders and Western journalists continue to be expelled,
Foley and others on Capitol Hill are expressing skepticism that the
United States can afford a business-as-usual approach.
   Foley, D-Wash., noted Sunday that there are those who believe
Bush ``ought to be speaking more loudly and more clearly'' as
China's leadership takes steps to erase the pro-democracy movement.
   ``The president ought to be doing that,'' said Foley, interviewed
on NBC's ``Meet The Press.''
   The speaker also said the United States should break relations
immediately with China if the Chinese use violence against the U.S.
Embassy in Beijing to seize dissident Fang Lizhi, who sought refuge
there two weeks ago.
   The U.S. decision to harbor Fang and his wife Li Shuxian has
angered the Chinese leadership, which has accused the United States
of interfering in China's internal affairs.
   While the administration has repeatedly said it abhors the
violent and bloody means used by the Chinese to crush the
student-led democracy movement, the president has been reluctant to
direct harsh rhetoric at Beijing, or affix blame for the June 4
massacre of the protesters around Tiananmen Square. According to
Western intelligence estimates, some 3,000 persons were probably
killed.
   Bush moved swiftly to curtail military sales to China, but did
not recall the ambassador, nor did he draw down the official
diplomatic presence there.
   He and other administratio officials have said repeatedly that
they oppose taking economic sanctions, saying such steps might hurt
the Chinese people.
   But others on Capitol Hill think differently, even some from the
president's own party.
   Sen. Pete Wilson, R-Calif., called the idea of business as usual
with China's regime an ``intolerable'' idea.
   Wilson, appearing Saturday on CNN, said he intends to introduce a
resolution in the Senate calling for the revocation of that
country's favored trading status with the United States.
   ``The United States must be a moral leader. ... I think we've got
to do that with some concrete, tangible means,'' Wilson said.
   Under the most-favored designation, a trading partner must be
given the best trade terms granted to any other nation.
   Although a congressional resolution would be non-binding, Wilson
said it is important to put the Congress on record against the
Chinese regime's bloody suppression of the pro-democracy movement.
   ``The United States is the largest direct investor in the
People's Republic of China. ... The hope is ... that a more moderate
leadership takes over, but one can assist that to come about,''
Wilson argued.
   The senator said the U.S. government used trade pressures against
the Soviet Union to bring about human rights reforms, and should do
so with China.
   A House Banking, Finance and Urban Affairs subcommittee has
scheduled hearings Tuesday on human rights in China.
   Richard Schifter, the assistant secretary of state for human
rights and humanitarian affairs, is expected to be grilled about
China's crackdown, while Treasury officials will be questioned about
pending multilateral development bank loans to Beijing.

   When it comes to canvassing for blood
donations, not even nudists are spared.
   While the nudists usually put their clothes on before they step
into the bloodmobile, many were wandering about the Willamettans
Nudist Camp in various stages of undress Friday. But the Lane County
Bloodmobile workers took it in stride.
   ``It's good blood,'' worker Pat Smith said. ``Their blood
pressure always seems to be low. One of the ways to keep your blood
pressure down is to be cool.''
   For the nudists, the blood drive was not unusual _ not like the
time they had a clothing drive.
   They were only glad to roll up their sleeves and help out.
   ``We might make nudists out of the nurses yet,'' said Jim Petree,
the park's host. ``We tease them every time they come out. We say,
`Come up and see more of us.'''

   When Pacific Southwest Airlines Flight 1771
took off from Los Angeles, its passengers included a no-nonsense
supervisor and a hot-tempered former underling who sneaked a gun
aboard.
   Over central California, the bad feelings between David Burke and
his former USAir boss, Ray Thomson, ended in an airborne shooting
that moved from the passenger compartment to the cockpit.
   With its slain crew slumped over the controls midway to their San
Francisco destination Dec. 7, 1987, the four-engine BAe-146 smashed
into a hillside north of San Luis Obispo. All 43 aboard were killed.
   Eighteen months later, attorneys are dissecting the final minutes
of the life of Burke, 35. The USAir employee was fired three weeks
earlier by Thomson, 48, who had denied Burke reinstatement during a
meeting shortly before they boarded the flight.
   The negligence lawsuit is midway through trial in Superior Court.
It was filed by the relatives of eight passengers and two crew
members against the Los Angeles Department of Airports; Ogden Allied
Security Co., PSA and USAir, which bought PSA.
   Jurors will have to fix percentages of responsibility, if any,
for the defendants as well as any damages, which attorneys agree
could run into millions of dollars. No set dollar amount was
requested.
   At issue is whether the defendants could have reasonably guessed
Burke's actions and stopped him. The defendants have said that was
impossible, and have countersued the estate of Burke as the man
solely responsible for the crash.
   The plaintiffs say Burke should never have been allowed past the
security checkpoint at Los Angeles International Airport.
   Norman Bottom, a security expert for the plaintiffs, said USAir
should have notified security personnel and airport police about
Burke's dismissal three weeks before, distributed a photo of him and
change locks to which he had keys.
   Defendants say nothing came to their attention to warrant such
action.
   Defense attorneys also have tried to point out that Burke's
considerable temper was largely limited to arguments with his
girlfriend, away from the job.
   Bottom said he has concluded that Burke managed to sneak the gun
past the security checkpoint by concealing it under clothing and
using his identification badge to avoid metal detectors.
   Defense attorneys have alluded to an FBI report, not yet admitted
into evidence, that suggests Burke used the airport's back stairways
and halls to reach the public storage lockers in the secure area of
the terminal.
   The FBI report said the use of employee-only hallways and stairs,
combined with wearing a USAir employee badge to avoid suspicion,
would have been the ``least obtrusive'' way to bypass security.
   Testimony has established that Burke, a ticket agent fired Nov.
15 for allegedly stealing petty cash, handed in two USAir employee
identification badges, but kept a third.
   Burke's whereabouts between 1:30 p.m. and 2 p.m. haven't been
established. At 2 p.m., he showed up at Thomson's office, outside
the security area, for an appointment to appeal his dismissal. He
met with Thomson for 25 minutes, seeking reinstatement, after
waiting to see him for nearly 20 minutes.
   Thomson's secretary, Ruth Wagner, testified that Burke seemed
happy after the meeting. ``I said, `Have a nice day,' and he said `I
will,''' she recalled.
   But she said Thomson emerged from the meeting red-faced and
stressed, heading for his flight home to San Francisco.
   Conflicting with that time frame was testimony from Mutual of
Omaha agent Marissa Chavez, who said she sold Burke two insurance
policies for $100,000 and $195,000 at about 2:30 p.m.
   Chavez also said she recalled smelling alcohol on Burke's breath.
   Burke originally bought his ticket for an earlier flight to San
Francisco, but changed it to the 3:30 p.m. flight after meeting with
Thomson. That assured he would be on the flight with Thomson, who
often commuted between Los Angeles and his San Francisco area home.
   Although the trial could result in sizable settlements for the
plaintiffs, its outcome would have little effect on the nation's
airport security, which already has been increased because of the
crash.
   The Federal Aviation Administration issued directives tightening
requirements for airline employees and management of ID badge
distribution.

   Authorities today postponed indefinitely a special
session of the national legislature that was scheduled before the
pro-democracy movement was crushed with the intent of discussing the
movement's demands.
   The move further deepens the mystery about what is going on
inside Communist China's traditionally secretive leadership.
   The legislature may be waiting until the Communist Party holds an
expected Central Committee meeting to formally oust party General
Secretary Zhao Ziyang, who has reportedly already been stripped of
power. Qiao Shi, the party official responsible for security, has
emerged as a likely successor.
   Wan Li, the chairman of the National People's Congress, had
scheduled a special session beginning Tuesday.
   But a man who answered the telephone at the Congress's press
office said the session was postponed because Beijing has not yet
returned completely to normal. No new date was set.
   Several thousand student protesters had planned to stay in
central Beijing's Tiananmen Square, outside the Great Hall of the
People where the Congress meets, until the session began.
   But they were routed out June 3-4 when troops with tanks and
machine guns shot their way through huge crowds protecting the
students and rolled into the square. Hundreds of unarmed civilians
were killed.
   The nearly 3,000-legislature normally meets just once a year,
with a 135-member Standing Committee fulfilling its duties the rest
of the year.
   It was not clear what Wan had in mind by calling the session,
though discussion had been expected on how to deal with the
pro-democracy movement's demands for reforms including a free press
and an end to official corruption. The congress has played a
somewhat larger role in shaping legislation in recent years but
still has no say in basic policy.
   The 17-member Politburo and party elders including senior leader
Deng Xiaoping hold the real reins of power.
   Although Wan has a reputation as a political moderate, like other
moderates he has publicly supported the army crackdown and visited
the troops to thank them for crushing what is now being called a
counterrevolutionary rebellion.
   The only top officials absent from the public eye in recent days
and believed purged are Zhao and party propaganda chief Hu Qili, who
Chinese sources said opposed the crackdown.
   Qiao, a Politburo member, told a meeting of non-party officials
Saturday that ``it is very natural that people have different views
and doubts'' under the current ``complicated '' situation.
   The comments, reported Sunday by the official People's Daily
newspaper, were more conciliatory than past remarks by hard-liners
who now control the Communist Party.
   Two weeks after the sweep on Tiananmen Square, the military
presence on central city streets was sharply reduced. More than 100
army trucks, most filled with soldiers, drove east from the city
center before dawn, apparently heading for bases in the suburbs.
   Most of the estimated 150,000 soldiers called into Beijing to
enforce martial law have returned to bases outside the city, Western
diplomats said.
   The number of soldiers guarding Tiananmen Square was cut sharply
this morning, and armored personnel carriers that had been parked
there were gone. Pedestrians remain barred from the square.
   Soldiers stood guard at only key intersections. The television
news said many had been sent into fields and factories to help boost
production idled during the protests.
   Workers were busy erasing traces of the battles fought in the
heart of the capital. Road crews patched asphalt torn up by tanks.
   However, the city retained a subdued air, with far less traffic
than usual and far fewer pedestrians. Illegal open-air labor markets
where peasants sought work on construction crews and as maids were
shut down.
   Some stores displayed red-and-yellow banners thanking the martial
law troops for restoring order, but most people were reluctant to
discuss the crackdown at all.
   ``I'm a businessman, I should talk about business,'' said one
resident.
   Official Beijing Radio today announced the arrests of two more
leaders of illegal worker unions.
   On Sunday, the national television news reported 10 more arrests
of protesters, including three identified as students.
   More than 1,300 people have been reported arrested in the wake of
the Beijing violence, but the pace dropped off sharply over the
weekend.
   Sixteen of 21 student leaders named in a wanted circular remained
at large. Among them were the three top leaders, Wang Dan and Chai
Ling of Beijing University and Wu'er Kaixi of the Beijing Normal
University. Rumors have placed some of them in foreign embassies,
but only the United States has acknowledged harboring fugitives,
dissident Fang Lizhi and his wife.
   A total of 11 people have been condemned to death for alleged
roles in protest-related violence in Beijing and Shanghai.

   Aviation officials were trying to
determine why a helicopter carrying four National Guardsmen and two
Army Reservists crashed in a thick fog, killing all aboard.
   The Army and Delaware Army National Guard on Sunday investigated
the wreckage of the UH-1 Bell helicopter, said Lt. Col. Stuart
Tauber, spokesman for the Massachusetts National Guard at Camp
Edwards.
   The helicopter crew was halfway through a two-week training
exercise at Camp Edwards. The exercise included 495 members of the
Delaware Guard. The camp is part of the 24,000-acre Massachusetts
Military Reservation on Cape Cod and straddles the towns of
Sandwich, Mashpee, Falmouth and Bourne.
   The crash's cause was unknown and no preliminary report was
planned, Tauber said.
   Maj. Mari K. Eder of the Virginia Army Reserve on Sunday
identified two of the victims as Master Sgt. Robert E. Lucey Jr. of
Emporia, Va., and Spec. Samuel K. May of Richmond, Va. Both were
members of the 80th Maneuver Training Command based in Richmond.
   Three other victims served in the Delaware Army National Guard
unit from New Castle _ 1st Lt. David Joseph Hendry, 26, Chief
Warrant Officer Hugh Bryan Pearce, 35, both of Wilmington, and Staff
Sgt. Benjamin Robert Greenplate, 40, of Newark, Del.
   Also killed was a member of the Connecticut National Guard, Sgt.
Ward Arthur Cornell, 43, of Mansfield, Conn.
   The helicopter, valued at $1 million, crashed in dense fog
shortly after midnight Friday as it returned to the camp from T.F.
Greene Airport in Warwick, R.I.
   The crew had flown to the commercial airport earlier in the
evening to pick up a passenger due to fly in on a commercial flight
from Philadelphia. He never arrived and the chopper crew decided to
return to Camp Edwards.
   The aircraft crashed in Yarmouth, about 30 miles from the camp,
in a wooded area near a housing development.
   No civilian casualties were reported and no homes were damaged,
but residents said the crash caused their walls to shake.
   Yarmouth is a resort community about 85 miles from Boston. Its
winter population of 20,000 multiplies fourfold during the summer
tourist season.

<HEAD>Husband's Death Changed Joyce Brothers' Outlook</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Psychologist Joyce Brothers says the death of her
husband has left her better able to understand the pain of others.
   Brothers said in this week's People magazine that after the death
of her husband, Milton, last year to cancer she realized that no one
lives without pain.
   ``My pain just came a little farther down the pike than a lot of
people's,'' she wrote. ``It's one thing to read research and discuss
the findings. It's another thing to be able to understand another
person's pain emotionally. I'm a changed person; I'm much more
sensitive to others.''
   Brothers wrote that she misses the laughter she and her husband
shared in their 39 years of marriage.
   ``You miss that more than anything else. Sex is not something you
miss. What you miss is the person who, with all his problems, warts
and difficulties, thinks you're the greatest person in the world.''
   Brothers, 60, said that the only good thing about her husband's
illness was that it allowed her enough time to say goodbye.
   ``You have a chance to say everything in your heart, to leave
nothing unresolved,'' she wrote.
   On the night before he died, she went to the hospital and spoke
to him about their marriage highlights.
   She said she considered suicide by driving her husband's Porsche
into an embankment.
   ``At that moment, I understood what it meant to feel like nothing
made a difference. ... I didn't break down at the funeral. But at
home, I cry. I open my husband's closet; his smell is everywhere,''
she said.

<HEAD>Eight Die in Head-on Collision on Everglades Highway</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NAPLES, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Dental records will be required to identify
eight people killed in a fiery collision officials said was the
worst accident ever on the desolate highway through the Everglades
known as Alligator Alley.
   The driver of a Toyota pickup truck was trying to pass on the
narrow, two-lane road about 44 miles west of Naples Sunday when he
ran head-on into a Pontiac Firebird with seven people, the Florida
Highway Patrol said.
   The crash engulfed both vehicles in flames and killed everyone
inside within seconds, said Lt. Malcolm Rhodes in Fort Myers.
   ``I've been here for eight years and I've never seen anything
this bad,'' Rhodes said.
   The blaze gutted the vehicles and melted the license plates,
forcing investigators to sift through a grisly scene of charred
debris for clues to the victims' identities.
   The burning cars also sparked a brush fire that blackened
hundreds of acres south of the accident.
   Collier County Medical Examiner William R. Anderson said the best
hope for identifying the victims was by matching teeth and bones
with dental and medical records.
   The 100-mile, east-west highway through the Everglades linking
Fort Lauderdale and Naples was closed following the 4:40 p.m.
accident and did not reopen until 8:30 p.m., said Florida Highway
Patrol duty officer Doug Dailey.
   Until Sunday, the worst accidents on the alley had claimed four
lives. The latest four-person fatality was a head-on collision about
two miles down the road from Sunday's crash Nov. 2, 1987.
   ``It appears (the westbound pickup driver) was just passing and
did not judge the closing distance,'' Rhodes said. ``I don't see
signs of excessive speeds.''
   The Florida Highway Patrol initially reported that nine people
were killed in the burning wreckage because officers on the scene
mistakenly identified a 20- to 25-pound fish as a victim.
   Tracy Roberts, 20, and Amy Burgess, 22, both of Boca Raton,
sideswiped the wreckage in their car but escaped injury.
   ``I saw them hit and things fly and the back of the white car
went up,'' Ms. Burgess said. ``I yelled at Tracy and he swerved.''
   She said there was chaos following the accident.
   ``People were yelling, `Move the car, it's going to explode,' and
I just tried not to look,'' said Ms. Burgess, adding that the memory
of the crash will remain with her forever.

   Two brothers and the girlfriend of a robbery
suspect have been arrested in connection with the June 6 slaying of
two people, one of whom was scheduled to testify against the
suspect, authorities said.
   Christopher Young, 21, and Joseph Young, 20, both brothers of
robbery suspect Roger Lee Young, were being held without bail for
investigation of first-degree murder in the shooting deaths of Frank
Magnuson and Daniel Smith, police said. Kevin Fears, 20, also was
being held.
   Christa Schaeffer, the 28-year-old girlfriend, was jailed Sunday
on $50,000 bail for conspiracy to commit murder in the cases, police
said.
   A fifth suspect, Michael Turner, 21, remained at large. He also
is wanted for conspiracy to commit murder, police said.
   Magnuson and Smith were shot to death in Magnuson's home one day
before he was to testify in the kidnapping and robbery trial of
28-year-old Roger Lee Young.
   Police had speculated the slayings were related to Magnuson's
testimony.
   Denver police spokesman Aristedes Zavaras said the crime could
have ``struck fear in the hearts of witnesses'' and that police had
been working non-stop for a break in the case.

   Showers and thunderstorms were scattered in parts of Kentucky,
Tennessee, Alabama and Mississippi early today, and heat continued
to bake the Southwest.
   Rain also was widely scattered across Georgia and along the coast
of the Carolinas.
   Farther west, the temperature cooled only to 90s early today in
the desert Southwest, following a day of 100-plus readings. The
nation's high temperature Sunday was 117 degrees at Bullhead City,
Ariz., and Laughlin, Nev.
   At least two record highs for the date were set in Arizona:
Phoenix, at 115 degrees, and Tucson 113. Winslow, Ariz., at 103
degrees, tied its record high.
   Also Sunday, thunderstorms spawned one tornado in Maine and
another in Florida. Other intense thunderstorms in Florida Sunday
night produced high winds that damaged a mobile home's roof in
Venice, toppled a restaurant sign onto a car in Clearwater and blew
away parts of porches from homes in North Fort Myers.
   The Maine tornado, which occurred near Farmington, toppled trees,
damaged homes and threw a camper 40 feet into the air. The trailer
landed in a tree. Showers and thunderstorms were also widely
scattered across eastern portions of the Dakotas and west-central
Minnesota.
   Today's forecast called for showers and thunderstorms scattered
from the Ohio Valley and the lower Mississippi Valley across the
Appalachians to the central Gulf Coast states and the southern
Atlantic Coast; numerous showers and thunderstorms over the upper
Ohio Valley, West Virginia, and parts of Alabama, Georgia and the
Florida Panhandle; scattered showers and thunderstorms later in the
day from the upper Mississippi Valley across northern Plains to the
central Rockies; showers and a few thunderstorms scattered across
the Pacific Northwest into western Montana.
   Predicted highs: 60s across much of the Pacific Northwest; 70s
and 80s from the Mississippi Valley to the Atlantic Coast, along the
northern and central California coast, and from southwest Oregon to
north-central Montana; 90s in most of the Plains, from the central
Intermountain region through the central Rockies and over Florida;
and 100 to 110 from the desert Southwest across the southern Rockies

<HEAD>Iran Says Fight Between Crew and Security Men Caused Crash</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NICOSIA, Cyprus (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The crash-landing of an Afghan airliner in
eastern Iran in which six people were killed was caused by a fight
between the crew and security guards, Iran's official Islamic
Republic News Agency reported today.
   The agency and Tehran Radio, both monitored in Nicosia, made no
mention of a hijacking, which earlier Iranian and Afghan reports had
blamed for Sunday's crash in the desert southeast of Zabol, close to
the Afghan border.
   IRNA said deputy Prime Minister Alireza Moayyeri, sent by Premier
Hussein Musavi to Zabol Sunday to investigate the incident, had
found that the fight aboard the twin-engined Antonov An-26 led to
the crash.
   He did not elaborate, but said that investigators had determined
``the full details,'' IRNA reported in a dispatch from Zabol, 700
miles southeast of Tehran.
   The radio quoted the governor of Zabol district as saying that,
according to accounts given by passengers, the plane had ``headed
for Iranian territory as a result of the clash on board.'' It did
not elaborate.
   The Ariana Afghan Airways plane was flying from Kabul, the Aghan
capital, to the provincial city of Zaranj in the southwest, across
the border from Zabol, with 38 passengers and crew aboard when it
ran into trouble.
   Moayyeri said four people _ earlier reported to be a woman and
three men _ died in the crash-landing.
   Two of the 34 injured dragged from the wreckage died later in
Zabol's Imam Khomeini Hospital, he said. One was identified as a
70-year-old man.
   IRNA listed the pilot, Mir Weis Haji, 50, and the co-pilot, Khayr
Mohammad Sadar Khayl, 26, among the injured. The agency on Sunday
named the pilot as Mirvis Paktia.
   IRNA said a team from Iran's Civil Aviation Organization
submitted a report on the incident to Moayyeri this morning.
   The report said neither the control tower at Zabol airport or the
tower at the Iranian city of Zahedan, 100 miles to the south,
monitored any distress calls from the Afghan pilot.
   But the report said both airports prepared for an emergency
landing when the Antonov entered Iranian airspace. It was not known
why the pilot did not try to make for either Iranian airport.
   In Kabul, foreign ministry spokesman Mohammad Nabi Amani said
earlier today that the Antonov had been hijacked and that 12 people
aboard the airliner were being held hostage.
   He did not say where his information came from, but said the
hijackers' identities were not known.
   He also charged that Afghan diplomats ``have not been allowed to
go near the site of the hijacking.''
   But IRNA said an Afghan delegation left for Zabol today to
investigate the incident and to arrange for transporting the
casualties and dead back to Afghanistan.
   Afghanistan and Iran do not have diplomatic relations, but
maintain embassies in each others' capitals.
   Iran supports Moslem guerrillas in Afghanistan who have been
fighting the Soviet-backed Kabul government for 10 years.

<DATELINE>RAFAH, Egypt (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Tear gas fumes and the sounds of rifle fire
and explosions from Israeli efforts to quell the Palestinian
uprising in the Gaza Strip are common in Camp Canada.
   The camp is home to about 5,000 Palestinians forgotten in the
Middle East conflict and barred from their Gaza homeland by the 1979
Israeli-Egypt peace pact. Camp Canada is in Egyptian Rafah _ 135
feet away across two chain-link border fences and rolls of barbed
wire.
   Under the peace treaty, the frontier between Egypt and the
Israeli-occupied Gaza Strip drawn in 1982 bisected Rafah, stranding
about 560 Palestinian families in Egypt's only refugee camp.
   The dividing line also divided many families, but they were told
they would be reunited in Gaza within a month.
   For years the main contact has been across the ``shouting
fence,'' where relatives exchange family news.
   The main topic is the Palestinian uprising in the occupied West
Bank and Gaza Strip that began in December 1987. More than 500
Palestinians and at least 22 Israelis have been killed in the
violence; in a clash Friday in occupied Rafah, three Arab men were
killed by Israeli army gunfire.
   Neither Israeli nor Egyptian officials will talk about the
seven-year embarrassment of Camp Canada, named for a Canadian
peacekeeping unit once quartered there. Alon Liel, spokesman for the
Israeli Foreign Ministry, said recently ``the issue is under various
discussions.''
   But residents say an 11-week process is scheduled to begin this
week that, if completed, will return to Gaza 67 people in 20 Camp
Canada families.
   They say tentative plans called for the first two families to
cross into no-man's land next Monday, meet with relatives and then
move into occupied Gaza. They would be followed by two families on
successive Mondays until the program is completed.
   Under a 1986 agreement, Egypt is to give each family $8,000 for
resettlement. Residents said and sources in Cairo confirmed that
Israel backed out of its commitment to give each returning family
land and housing materials valued at $9,000.
   Evidence of the frustration of Camp Canada's residents is that
the 20 families agreed to Israel's conditions. They will live with
relatives.
   Much of the resentment is toward the United States, which camp
residents perceive as siding with Israel.
   ``The key to our problem is America,'' said one camp official.
``The Americans are the only ones who can solve it.... Why don't
they do something to make it happen?''
   ``We've been through this 20 million times before,'' said a
teacher at the Camp Canada school. ``We've been told we were going,
then no. I will believe we're going when we're there.''
   As Palestinians, camp residents are foreigners and barred from
government jobs in Egypt's government-dominated economy. Many have
not worked for seven years. Others are underemployed or work on day
jobs outside the camp.
   Carpenter Gamil Mohammed, who runs a kiosk decorated with a
Palestinian flag, spoke of smelling the tear gas used against fellow
Palestinians across the barbed wire in Gaza and of hearing the
``boom'' of houses being dynamited.
   Israeli forces frequently destroy homes of Palestinians suspected
of being involved in terrorism.
   Mohammed introduced his three small sons wearing T-shirts with
slogans supporting the Palestine Liberation Organization and
uprising. The shirts are becoming part of the uniform of Camp
Canada's young people.
   Mohammed said of his son, ``They hope to go to another place.
Home.''

<TEXT>
   The government is locked in a dogfight with
the Chino Planes of Fame Museum over two Soviet fighter jets on
display.
   The State Department, Customs Service and Bureau of Alcohol,
Tobacco and Firearms insist the museum imported the MiGs from Poland
illegally.
   Officials also say the museum's 1947 Antonov, a Soviet-designed
biplane still in flying condition, must go because it was bought in
Hungary.
   U.S. law bars importation of military equipment from a list of
countries that includes Poland and Hungary, ``based our belief we
should not contribute to their armament industries by purchasing
implements of war,'' said Jack Killorin, an ATF official in
Washington.
   Museum officials said they had no idea their purchases were
illegal.
   ``They sat on the docks down there for two weeks and customs
passed them right through,'' said Karen Hinton, museum vice
president.
   ``We made a mistake,'' said Customs spokeswoman Maryanne Noonan.
``Those planes never should have reached the museum, but over a
million containers a year come in through the seaport. We physically
inspect only a small percentage.''
   The 31-year-old museum, which showcases 90 vintage aircraft,
figured it scored a coup last summer when it purchased the MIGs
through a broker. The MiG-15 and MiG-17, similar to those flown
against U.S. forces in Korea, were restored by volunteers and
quickly became a popular attraction.
   ``We had Japanese, British, German and American aircraft in our
collection,'' Ms. Hinton said, ``and to add something from the
Russian theater really rounded things out.''
   A June 8 deadline for surrender of the aircraft has long passed.
Customs officials said they could have seized the planes and added
they won't wait much longer.
   Determined to keep the planes, the museum has launched a Save the
MiGs petition drive, gathering nearly 7,000 signatures. U.S. Reps.
Jerry Lewis and Robert K. Dornan, both Republicans, have pledged
their support.
   ``We're at our wits' end,'' Ms. Hinton said. ``We just wanted to
preserve and display these aircraft so a grandfather can bring in
his grandson and say, `Look, this is what I flew in Korea, and
here's what the enemy used.'
   ``It's just terrible to think they may cut these planes up.''

<TEXT>
   Two of the city's biggest paging companies are
cracking down on drug dealers by raising rates for suspiciously
frequent use of beepers.
   ``The drug problem in the U.S. is far beyond the realm of pagers.
They're just tools _ if this helps us do our little part in battling
drugs then we've done something,'' said Ron Kilcoyne, a spokesman
for NYNEX.
   Police have found that many drug dealers use beepers to keep in
touch with customers and delivery boys.
   NYNEX on Aug. 1 plans to start charging 50 cents extra for every
beep over 500 a month, $1 for every beep over 1,000 and $250 for
each month a customer gets more than 1,000 beeps.
   Metromedia Paging already has begun charging $1 extra for every
beep over 1,000.
   Kilcoyne said the average pager user gets between one and two
calls a day.
   ``If you're getting 1,000 pages a month, you're not getting much
work done _ that's an amazing number of calls. It adds up to a page
every 10 minutes,'' he said.
   Kilcoyne said that industrywide about 1 percent of beeper users
get more than 500 beeps a month.
   Metromedia will donate its money from extra charges to Target, a
national organization that helps children deal with alcohol and drug
problems.

<TEXT>
   The widow of Prime Minister Olof Palme
stood in court today 30 feet from the defendant in her husband's
murder trial and identified him as the killer.
   Lisbeth Palme, who was leaving a movie with her husband when he
was shot to death the night of Feb. 28, 1986, said she clearly saw
the defendant's face just after the shooting on a Stockholm street.
   Upon cross-examination, however, she said she had not seen the
man's hands, and thus could not say whether he had a gun.
   Mrs. Palme's testimony was crucial to the case against Christer
Pettersson, a 42-year-old Swede with a long criminal record. He was
arrested in December.
   Pettersson, wearing a blue-and-white sport coat, was brought into
the heavily-guarded courtroom at the end of Mrs. Palme's testimony.
   Prosecutor Anders Helin asked her if she could point out the man
she saw seconds after the shooting. Without hesitation, she pointed
at Pettersson, who was sitting across the room.
   ``I'm certain,'' she told Helin.
   ``If Olof Palme in his heaven could have heard this, he wouldn't
have liked it,'' said Pettersson, interrupting over the objections
of Judge Carl-Anton Spak. ``If you believe in what you're saying,
it's OK. But otherwise, it's not,'' said Pettersson in a calm, clear
voice.
   Guards took him from the room, and Mrs. Palme made no reply.
   ``You haven't got a camera in your head,'' said defense attorney
Arne Liljeros. ``How can you be certain? Isn't it wishful thinking
on your part to close the matter?''
   ``It will never be closed for me,'' Mrs. Palme said.
   Saying she still suffered from ``a deep wound,'' she had refused
earlier today to testify with Pettersson present in the Stockholm
district courtroom.
   However, the court ruled after she began testifying with
Pettersson outside the courtroom that he should be brought in for an
identification.
   Before he entered, Mrs. Palme had referred to the defendant only
as ``No. 8,'' a reference to Pettersson's place in a videotaped
police lineup where Mrs. Palme had earlier picked him out.
   ``I have been trained in my job to observe things. Not to
analyze, but to observe,'' she told the court. Mrs. Palme is a
psychologist by training.
   ``My state of shock made me even more observant,'' she said.
``That's why I remember his face so clearly.''
   Mrs. Palme, who wore a gray suit and a green silk scarf, appeared
on edge during much of her testimony. Accompanied by her son
Joachim, she entered the courtroom walking sideways to avoid facing
the 60 reporters present.
   When court officials tried to show her a map of the scene where
the killing took place, she refused to turn in profile to the
audience to look at it. The map was moved so she could keep her back
to the gallery.
   Mrs. Palme had requested that no official tape recording be made
of the session, that it not be broadcast, and that reporters be
excluded. The court agreed to the first two conditions but allowed
the press inside.
   Mrs. Palme was slightly injured in the attack, which occurred at
night on a main Stockholm street. The gunman escaped down a dark
alley.
   Pettersson, a 42-year-old Swede with a history of drug and
alcohol abuse and a previous conviction for manslaughter, has denied
killing Palme.
   He had demanded a courtroom identification by Mrs. Palme.
   ``You must realize the responsibility,'' Liljeros told her. ``My
client says he hasn't committed this crime, and if you're the least
bit uncertain about the identity, then your responsiblityy is to say
so.''
   ``I am absolutely certain,'' Mrs. Palme replied.
   Since Palme's death, Mrs. Palme has shied away from any public
discussion of the killing. She lashed out at the news media on the
stand today, saying they had ``tried their best to destroy the
investigation.''

   The sole surviving sibling of U.S. Rep.
Claude Pepper said he wants the best qualified Democrat elected to
his late brother's seat _ and he doesn't think their niece is that
candidate.
   ``It appears she has been talked into something about which she
knows very little,'' Frank Pepper said Sunday after learning that
JoAnn Pepper had entered the race.
   Ms. Pepper, 38, joined two other Democrats running for the seat
her late uncle held for 27 years until his death at age 88 on May 30.
   Frank Pepper, a 71-year-old retired broadcaster, said he learned
of his niece's intentions from reading the newspaper and was never
consulted.
   Ms. Pepper, a federal probation officer, is the adopted daughter
of the late Joseph Pepper, brother to Frank and Claude. In his will,
Claude Pepper left her $50,000.
   ``She was very, very close to (Claude Pepper), like a daughter to
him, and she would like to continue with his work,'' said Maria
Tolon, the late congressman's Hispanic liaison in Miami.
   Claude Pepper was one of the nation's leading advocates for the
elderly and poor during a political career that began in the
Legislature in the 1930s.
   Educator Marvin Dunn and retired industrialist Bernard Anscher
already have entered the race for the Democratic nomination.
   Frank Pepper said he supported either one and hoped ``the
best-qualified Democrat will win and continue the fight for the
elderly and the unconnected to which my dear brother Claude devoted
his entire public life.''
   Announced candidates for the GOP nomination are state Sen. Ileana
Ros-Lehtinen, lawyer Jeff Allen and Carlos Perez, a businessman and
conservative activist. The primary is Aug. 1.

<TEXT>
   Jewish settlers today
demonstrated to protest the stabbing death of a U.S.-born settler in
the occupied West Bank and to demand harsher government measures to
quell the Palestinian uprising.
   The military command today extended the closure of West Bank
schools for another month despite pleas from the United States and
human rights groups to reopen them.
   The 1,194 schools, including 145 kindergardens, have been closed
for all but a few weeks since Feb. 3, 1988, keeping 320,000 pupils
out of classrooms.
   In the occupied Gaza Strip, six Palestinians were wounded in
clashes in the Bureij and Nusseirat refugee camps, including a
65-year-old man struck in the knee, Arab doctors said.
   Outside the Ariel settlement, the home of the fatal stabbing
victim, 150 demonstrators waved Israeli flags and some shouted,
``How many Jews have to die before something is done?''
   In Jerusalem, 80 Jewish settlers blocked the entrance to the
Knesset to protest the slaying of Friedrich Steven Rosenfeld.
Fistfights occurred when Knesset guards ordered the protesters to
disperse, army radio said.
   Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir blamed Palestinians for the slaying
of Rosenfeld, 48, and said punishment would be swift and harsh.
   ``This murder is another link in the chain of blood of violent
actions carried out against us in the country by murderers and
rioters who believe that by these actions they will put an end to
our settlement and our existence,'' he said. ``Israel's security
forces will uproot this violence with an iron fist.''
   Chaim Malka, a West Bank police commander, said police suspected
Palestinians in the slaying. But he said all possibilities would be
investigated. The army said it was checking the reports.
   Rosenfeld's body was found on Sunday by Palestinian shepherds on
a hilltop between the Arab villages of Salfit and Burkin, said Avivi
Shalom, head of security in Ariel. Shalom said Rosenfeld had been
stabbed in the back.
   Rosenfeld had been missing since Friday night.
   Shalom said Rosenfeld apparently walked to the barren area from
Ariel.
   ``It seems as though the assailants surprised him and hit him on
the head,'' Shalom told The Associated Press. Rosenfeld's empty
pistol holster, map, binoculars and two spent cartridges were found
near the body, Shalom said.
   The Maariv daily said it appeared the settler had been taken by
surprise and fired in the direction of the assailants.
   Ariel officials said Rosenfeld lived in Washington, D.C. before
emigrating to Israel in 1968. He served in the Israeli army and was
wounded in March 1968 when his jeep hit a land mine while on patrol,
the officials said.
   Rosenfeld lived in Tel Aviv and worked as an editor of technical
manuals before moving to Ariel 18 months ago.
   Ariel spokesman Dina Shalit said Rosenfeld was a nature lover and
frequent organizer of hikes for residents in the settlement of
5,000. She said he may have been mapping a hiking route when he was
killed.
   ``He was just walking on the hill looking at nature. He wasn't
disturbing anyone. He died just because he was Jewish,'' Shalom said.
   Before Rosenfeld's death, 22 Israelis had been killed during the
18-month Palestinian uprising against Israel's occupation of the
West Bank and Gaza Strip. At least 524 Palestinians have also died.
   The army placed curfews on Burkin and Salfit and launched a
manhunt, deploying helicopters, scouts and search dogs.
   Outside the Ariel settlement, its mayor, Ron Nachman, told
protesters that the government created an atmosphere against
settlers. About 70,000 Jews live among the 1.7 million Palestinians
in the occupied territories.
   ``All of them are responsible, and especially the Knesset members
who speak out and put a stigma on us as a group, in order to enable
attacks on us. I see them as directly responsible for this
assassination,'' Nachman said.

<HEAD>Talk Show Host Hopes To Buy Controversial But Ailing Show</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The unabashedly abrasive Morton Downey Jr. says
he is trying to buy his show and turn it into a weekly program to
avoid cancellation.
   ``My position is and always has been that five times a week is
overexposure for this type of persona,'' he said in today's New York
Times.
   The talk show has been nationally syndicated for a year and is on
71 stations, but not enough stations are renewing the
five-day-a-week version.
   Last week, Downey told the Daily News that the show has been sold
for the coming year in 22 markets but needs at least 60 to get
renewed.
   ``No one will take a chance on it any more,'' he said.
   Downey, one of a spate of talk show hosts whose emotional style
and sensational topics have earned their shows the nickname
``tabloid TV,'' told the Times he hoped to purchase the show with
partners and revise it.
   The Times said executives for Quantum Media Inc., which produces
the show, believe Downey's off-camera behavior has hurt the program.
   In April, for example, he claimed he was attacked in San
Francisco by neo-Nazis, but police there said they were unable to
substantiate the claim.
   ``Downey'' doesn't get as good ratings as ``The Oprah Winfrey
Show,'' ``Donahue'' and ``Geraldo.''
   All three are carried by about three times the number of stations
that carry Downey and regularly rank in the top 10 nationally
syndicated programs. Downey's show ranked No. 84 this past season,
according to the A.C. Nielsen Co.
   The program premiered at a New Jersey station nearly two years
ago.

   A multiple killer who murdered a
transient because he ``just got in my way'' was executed by
injection today after thanking his guards for ``letting me die with
dignity.''
   William Paul Thompson, 52, was pronounced dead at 2:09 a.m. He
gave no final statement but talked with guards as he lay on a gurney
in Nevada's former gas chamber, then stared at a ceiling fan as the
injection was administered.
   The 300-pound Thompson spent the hours before his execution
talking with a minister and with a fellow death-row inmate who is
scheduled to die later this week, officials said.
   He was the third person put to death in Nevada and the 112th in
the nation since executions resumed in 1977. Counting Thompson,
eight murderers have been executed this year.
   In the only death row interview he granted, Thompson told The
Associated Press on Saturday that he had recently found religion and
was ``paying back to society the only thing I have to offer it.''
   ``When you give everything you got, that should be enough,'' he
said. ``My death is payment to everyone I've ever hurt, my family,
the victims' families.''
   Thompson said he didn't want to stop his execution because he's
ready to die and might kill again if he remained alive. Defense
attorneys and the American Civil Liberties Union filed no
last-minute petitions, and no eleventh-hour court reviews were held.
   ``They're letting a guilty man die with dignity,'' he said in the
interview. ``I never thought I'd be thanking someone for letting me
die, never in a million years.''
   His last words struck the same theme. According to Warden Pete
Demosthenes, as guards closed the death chamber door, Thompson said,
``Thank you for letting me die with dignity.'' The warden also said
Thompson ``was very resigned to this.''
   Thompson, convicted of three murders, said he was the hitman in
other contract murders. He said one victim was a federal prosecutor
in Oklahoma in 1983.
   In Tulsa, Okla., U.S. Attorney Tony Graham said he wasn't aware
of any prosecutor in the state who had disappeared or was killed in
1983. Graham said Thompson's statement sounds ``somewhat
preposterous'' and he didn't intend to investigate the claim.
   Bill Price, who recently stepped down as U.S. attorney in
Oklahoma City, said, ``If a federal prosecutor had been killed in
Oklahoma, I would definitely know about it. That (claim) is
categorically false.''
   The other murders were in New York and in Kansas, Thompson said.
He wouldn't reveal the names of the victims or the people who hired
him.
   Thompson declined further interviews, prison officials said.
   Thompson was sentenced to die for the 1984 killing of Randy
Waldron, a 28-year-old transient in Reno. After that sentence, he
was convicted of killing Robert Pariset, 35, and Pariset's
28-year-old brother, John, who were camping near Auburn, Calif.
   Thompson said Waldron ``just got in my way'' while he was on the
run from the killings of the brothers. He said he shot the brothers
because they were drug informants.
   He said his life of crime and alcoholism started at age 12 in
Texas. He said he spent more than half his life behind bars.

   An American free-lance photographer
traveling with Moslem guerrillas has been captured and is being held
by the Afghan government, Afghan guerrilla sources said today.
   They identified him as Tony O'Brien, 42, a photographer from
Santa Fe, N.M., on assignment for Time-Life Inc. He had been
covering the Afghan war based in the Pakistani frontier city of
Peshawar.
   The Afghan government did not immediately confirm the arrest.
U.S. Embassy officials in Pakistan refused to comment on the report.
   Guerrilla sources in Pakistan who demanded anonymity said O'Brien
was captured Wednesday in western Kabul, the capital. The sources
said he was being held in the capital and was reported to be in good
condition.
   At least three Western correspondents and two foreign aid workers
have been captured while traveling with the guerrillas during the
11-year war in Afghanistan. All of them were later released unharmed.
   The report on O`Brien is the first known case of an American's
capture.
   The U.S.- and Pakistani-supported guerrillas have been fighting
the Soviet-supported Afghan government for a decade.
   Soviet combat troops ended nine years of involvement in the war
Feb. 15 but continue to arm the Kabul government.
   O'Brien had made several previous forays into Afghanistan with
the guerrillas. His photographs have appeared in several major U.S.
publications, including The New York Times and Time magazine.

   The nation's health chief and its largest group of
doctors are on a collision course over a plan by the Bush
administration to curb skyrocketing health care costs.
   Dr. Louis Sullivan, secretary of the Department of Health and
Human Services, reiterated the administration's support for
``expenditure targets'' during a private meeting Sunday with the
American Medical Association's Board of Trustees.
   The forum was on the opening day of the AMA's five-day
policymaking session, where Dr. James H. Sammons, the association's
executive vice president, called the proposal ``rationing'' of
medical care.
   Under the proposal, the government would set maximum levels for
reimbursing fees of doctors who treat Medicare patients. The amount
by which fees exceed the target level would be cut from the next
year's budget, an AMA official said.
   Sammons said in a speech to more than 1,000 AMA members he has
``personally communicated the medical profession's obections'' to
the White House and to Sullivan.
   Sullivan did not mention the plan in addressing those at the
meeting. He told reporters later he was trying to avoid a
``confrontational approach.''
   ``What we are trying to do ... is get a handle on the escalation
of medical costs,'' he said.
   The United States' per capita expenditures for health care are
the highest in the world, using more than 11 percent of the gross
national product, ``and they continue to rise at an unsustainable
rate,'' Sullivan told the convention.
   ``Yet the United States lags far behind other industrialized
countries in some basic health indices, including average life
expectancy and maternal mortality,'' he said.
   ``We have an infant mortality rate of 10.4 deaths per thousand
live births, which ranks our nation 19th among industrialized
countries of the Western world,'' he said.
   In his speech, Sammons criticized delays by the Bush
administration in filling key national health care positions.
   ``Six months into the administration, we do not have any
political leadership in the Health Care Financing Administration.
The post of assistant secretary for health affairs at the Pentagon
is vacant. Beginning July 13th the position of surgeon general of
the Public Health Service will be vacant,'' he said.
   ``This is no way to usher America in to the health care arena in
the final decade of the 20th century.''
   Sullivan said the administration is concerned about the vacancies
but he argued that they do not signal a lack of leadership.
   Both acknowledged that U.S. health care is in trouble but said
reforms rather than a complete overhaul will cure the problems.
   Sammons cited a report to be presented this week by the AMA's
Board of Trustees, its governing body, criticizing the nationalized
health care program in Canada.
   The report says programs such as Canada's highly touted system
fail to address the needs of patients and doctors, and won't work in
the United States.
   Some doctors started a movement this year seeking adoption of a
system similar to Canada's in which individuals and employers are
taxed to pay for health coverage for all.
   But the board is highly critical of the system, saying ``all
responsibility for health care payment is placed on the government.''
   ``In theory, Canadians have an ideal health care system: a
comprehensive system of primary care, removal of all financial
barriers to access to primary care, decentralization of health
programs, and professional standards of care equal to or better than
those of most western countries,'' the board said in its report.
   ``But in many important ways Canada's system is lacking.''
   Canada's program is less responsive to consumers than the U.S.
system, ``adoption of major medical technologies lags far behind the
United States, there are growing backlogs for a variety of surgical
and emergency procedures, it does not reward or encourage high
performance by providers, it is rigid and inflexible,'' according to
the report.

<TEXT>
   Voters rejected Premier Andreas
Papandreou's scandal-plagued socialist government, and thousands of
people rallied in the streets today to cheer the conservative
opposition that finished first.
   But the center-right New Democracy party of Constantine
Mitsotakis failed to capture a majority, meaning the conservatives
will have to try to forge a coalition with other parties or else
call new elections.
   Official results from 18,491 of the 20,081 voting precincts
clearly indicated that Mitsotakis' party would fall far short of the
parliamentary majority needed to make him the next premier.
   Government computer projections indicated that in Sunday's vote
his party would win 144 of the 300 seats in Parliament; Papandreou's
Panhellenic Socialist Movement, 125; the Coalition of Left and
Progress, 29; and one each for the conservative Democratic Renewal
and a Greek-Moslem of Turkish origin from northeastern Greece.
   The Ministry of Interior said today that with more than 90
percent of the ballots counted, New Democracy was getting 44.43
percent of the vote and Papandreou's party, also known as PASOK,
39.07 percent. The Coalition of Left and Progress had 12.97 percent
and the rest was split among minor parties and independents.
   Official figures showed that New Democracy received 2,655,580
votes, PASOK 2,335,123 and the Coalition of the Left and Progress
775,403. Abstention was running about 21 percent of the 7.89 million
eligible voters.
   ``New Democracy has toppled PASOK from the government,''
Mitsotakis told thousands of screaming supporters from the steps of
party headquarters as dawn rose over the capital. Tens of thousands
of supporters celebrated in the streets of central Athens.
   As the results trickled in shortly after the polls closed Sunday
night, gloom set in at the socialist camp. The atmosphere was muted
at Papandreou's suburban home. His party headquarters in central
Athens closed early.
   A well-laid buffet in the garden of Papandreou's spacious villa
remained untouched as PASOK supporters and friends scowled at a
television set broadcasting election results.
   ``The conservatives are first and PASOK is second,'' a gaunt and
tired-looking Papandreou told reporters and guests gathered in the
garden.
   Papandreou has governed Greece for eight years and swallowed a
bitter pill today when he acknowledged he could not defeat
Mitsotakis, who advocates closer U.S. ties and less economic
controls than the premier.
   Papandreou nevertheless thanked supporters for denying ``an
absolute majority to the forces of conservatism.''
   His government has been rocked by financial and arms scandals
that led to the firings or resignations of eight Cabinet members.
The 70-year-old Papandreou also was hurt by a divorce from his
American-born wife, Margaret, and his affair with a former airline
stewardess half his age.
   Still, Mitsotakis' lack of a majority left Papandreou with a
chance to salvage a third four-year term at the helm of Greece's
turbulent politics.
   When there is no majority, the constitution requires the
president to give the leading party three days to form a governing
coalition.
   Mitsotakis is expected to meet with President Christos
Sartzetakis on Tuesday. If Mitsotakis fails to muster enough
support, PASOK and then the Coalition of Left and Progress must be
given the chance.
   Should all efforts fail, the president can form a caretaker
government and call new elections. Papandreou remains premier until
efforts to form a coalition are exhausted.
   The premier refused to answer questions about a coalition today
but hinted at the possibility by noting that leftist parties _ PASOK
and the Coalition _ would have a majority.
   Before Sunday's vote, both Papandreou and Mitsotakis said that in
forming a government, they would reject support from the communists.
   The Coalition had hoped to emerge as a third force in Greek
politics and a power broker in any negotiations for a new government.
   Papandreou came to power in 1981 promising to lead Greece out of
NATO and the European Economic Community and to close U.S. military
bases around the country. His maverick foreign policy created a new
pride in a country accustomed to feeling like a poor cousin of the
rich West.
   However, he now supports membership in both NATO and the ECC and
is negotiating a new base agreement with the Americans.
   Mitsotakis, 71, who calls himself an advocate of a free-market
economy, campaigned with promises to clean up the scandals and put
the ailing economy back on track. Inflation is running at 14 percent.
   The biggest scandal has centered on fugitive banker George
Koskotas. He is charged with swindling more than $200 million from
the Bank of Crete to build a publishing empire and buy a top Greek
soccer team.
   Koskotas has accused Papandreou of masterminding the plan to loot
the bank as a way of financing his election campaign. The premier
has denied any wrongdoing.

   State lawmakers are considering a bill to make
leaving a loaded firearm accessible to a child a crime after a third
Florida child died this month in an accident involving youngsters
playing with guns.
   ``We think by highlighting the responsibility to keep a loaded
gun away from children, we're going to save a lot of lives,'' Gov.
Bob Martinez said today on ABC's ``Good Morning America.''
   ``Most Floridians will accept that what law is passed will
provide greater safety. We've done that with car restraints and with
safety caps on bottles.''
   Four-year-old Silvio Claud Pierre died Saturday at Tampa General
Hospital, where he had been in critical condition after shooting
himself at home June 11. Two other children died earlier in the
month and a girl was paralyzed from the neck down in separate,
accidental shootings.
   In Tallahassee, lawmakers intended to take up a bill that would
make leaving a loaded gun within reach of a child a misdemeanor,
unless a child died or was disfigured as a result, in which case the
offense would be a felony carrying up to five years in prison.
   The bill legislators will consider during a three-day special
session beginning this afternoon borrows language from the state's
abandoned-refrigerator law. It would require that guns be secured
with a trigger lock or kept in a locked container.
   The National Rifle Association has said it would not oppose the
bill if it were amended to exclude shootings involving guns that are
stolen from a home.
   Silvio found a .25-caliber semiautomatic handgun under a couch
while his mother was in the shower. His father was out.
   Five days earlier, a 10-year-old Orlando boy was killed by a
playmate. On June 5, an 8-year-old Miramar girl was killed by her
10-year-old brother, who thought his father's gun was unloaded.
   A 4-year-old Orlando girl was critically injured when her
6-year-old brother dropped a pistol and she was wounded in the neck,
and a 9-year-old Tampa boy was wounded by his 13-year-old brother as
they played with a handgun.
   The Orlando girl is not expected to be able to move or breathe on
her own again. The 9-year-old Tampa boy underwent surgery but is
expected to recover.
   Martinez opposed including the gun legislation in his call for a
special session on a $2.4 billion turnpike expansion plan but
changed his mind last week as the accidents continued.

   A bomb exploded outside the
living quarters of a British military barracks in Osnabrueck today,
causing extensive damage but no injuries, a military spokesman said.
   No one immediately claimed responsibility, but West German
authorities said they suspected the Irish Republican Army was
responsible.
   The two suspected attackers fled after they were surprised by a
West German employee at the barracks.
   The employee was hit in the face and investigators later found
four more unexploded bombs containing plastic explosives at the
barracks, officials said.
   Col. Henry Day of the British Forces Headquarters in West Germany
said the bomb exploded at 1:10 a.m. at Quebec Barracks, 100 miles
north of Duesseldorf.
   The bombing came five days after West German officials indicted
two alleged IRA members for earlier attacks on the British military
in West Germany.
   British military authorities first said property damage in
today's blast was slight, but a spokesman later said the damage was
extensive.
   A military spokesman in Osnabrueck, who requested anonymity, said
the blast caused ``severe damage to the one-story building.''
   He said the explosion ``blew a hole from ground level to the roof
of the building measuring about eight feet in diameter.''
   ``It also blew out numerous windows in the area,'' he said.
   The unidentified West German employer was treated at a local
hospital for facial scratches and bruises, the spokesman said.
   He said the employee was a 62-year-old boilerman. ``He was just
making his rounds and accidently stumbled onto them,'' the spokesman
said.
   Police in Osnabrueck said 1,000 people living near the barracks
were temporarily evacuated while bomb squads checked for more
explosives.
   The barracks is the headquarters of the 12th Armoured Brigade and
the 23rd Engineer Regiment, of the Royal Corps of Engineers,
officials said. About 800 British troops are stationed at the
barracks.
   The IRA has in the past attacked British troops in Europe as part
of its guerrilla campaign to force the British out of Northern
Ireland and unite the predominantly Protestant province with mostly
Roman Catholic Ireland.
   On June 14, West German prosecutors said they had indicted on
attempted murder charges two suspected Irish Republican Army members
held in connection with 1987 and 1988 bombing attacks that wounded
46 people.

<HEAD>Court Turns Down Appeal by California Woman in Prayer-Healing Case</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICHARD CARELLI</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A California woman facing criminal charges in
her daughter's death because she tried to heal the child through
prayer rather than seeking medical help lost a Supreme Court appeal
today.
   The justices, without comment, refused to block the woman's trial
in Sacramento on charges of child-endangerment and involuntary
manslaughter.
   The high court has turned away similar appeals previously.
   Laurie Walker, a Christian Scientist, chose to treat with prayer
rather than medical attention her 4-year-old daughter, Shauntay,
when the girl became ill with flu-like symptoms on Feb. 21, 1984,
and four days later developed a stiff neck.
   Ms. Walker contacted an accredited prayer practitioner from her
church and a Christian Science nurse to attend the child, but
Shauntay nevertheless lost weight and grew disoriented.
   The young girl died March 9 of meningitis.
   California's child-neglect law does not allow prosecution of
parents who provide prayer rather than medical care for their
children. But prosecutors charged Ms. Walker with child-endangerment
and involuntary manslaughter. If convicted, she could receive a
maximum sentence of six years in prison.
   In the appeal acted on today, lawyers for Ms. Walker contended
that the conflicting state laws result in a denial of ``fair
warning'' for Christian Scientists.
   Referring to ``mixed signals or deliberate ambiguity in the
criminal law,'' the appeal said such prosecutions ``amount to trials
of faith'' forbidden by the Constitution.
   The California Supreme Court last Nov. 10 rejected arguments that
forcing Ms. Walker to stand trial would violate her religious
freedom.
   ``An adequately effective and less restrictive alternative is not
available to further the state's compelling interest in assuring the
provision of medical care to gravely ill children whose parents
refuse such treatment on religious grounds,'' the state court said.
   ``The First Amendment (protecting religious freedom) and its
California equivalent do not bar defendant's criminal prosecution,''
it said.
   But the state court added, ``Whether this defendant's particular
conduct was sufficiently culpable to justify conviction of
involuntary manslaughter and felony child endangerment remains a
question in the exclusive province of the jury.''
   The case is Walker vs. Superior Court, 88-1471.

<TEXT>
   The nation's Roman Catholic Church,
which has lost tens of thousands of minority members to conservative
Protestant groups in recent years, is fighting back.
   The president of the National Conference of Catholic Bishops
charged during the prelates' annual spring meeting that some of the
nation's largest Protestant denominations, including the Southern
Baptist Convention, have worked to convert Hispanics.
   Archbishop John L. May of St. Louis said fundamentalist churches
have ``a very clearly fashioned plan to entice people away from the
church in a very deceptive way.''
   ``I think that's an unfair statement,'' the Rev. Daniel Vestal,
pastor at Dunwoody Baptist Church in Atlanta and the unsuccessful
candidate last week for president of the 14.5 million-member
Southern Baptist Convention, said Sunday.
   ``I can't speak for all Protestant groups but I know the Southern
Baptists offer a message of hope and redemption. That attracts
people regardless of race.''
   At their meeting at Seton Hall University, the bishops voted to
emphasize evangelism when they celebrate in 1992 the 500th
anniversary of the introduction of Catholicism to the Americas and
to start work toward giving blacks a greater role in the church.
   Leaders of the nation's largest religious denomination also
approved a resolution calling for normalization of U.S. relations
with Vietnam and a plan for resolving disputes between bishops and
theologians.
   After two days of business meetings, the bishops held a day of
recollection Sunday, gathering for Mass. The bishops were to meet in
executive session today to conclude the meeting.
   May said some fundamentalist churches go so far as to feature
Catholic art and music in their churches to draw Hispanics in, and
then start teaching anti-Catholic doctrines to keep the converts
from returning to Catholicism.
   A wave of immigrants from Spanish-speaking countries and a
relatively high birth rate have made Hispanics the fastest-growing
group of U.S. Catholics, making up an estimated third of the 53
million-member denomination. Due in part to immigration from the
West Indies and Haiti, the number of black Catholics has risen from
900,000 to 2 million during the past 20 years.
   But the Rev. Allan Figueroa Deck, associate professor of Hispanic
studies at the Jesuit School of Theology at Berkeley University,
said one national study has shown at least 60,000 Hispanics leave
the church each year, and 1 million have left during the past 15
years.
   Church leaders said a large part of the losses, particularly in
the Hispanic community, are the result of proselytizing by
conservative Protestant churches.
   Catholic officials, though, also admit the church has driven some
minority members away through apathy and insensitivity.
   Deck said that while Hispanic Catholics struggle to be noticed in
the Catholic Church, evangelical sects are providing numerous
Spanish-speaking ministers and small churches ``especially
appropriate for immigrants who need all the personal communal
support they can get.''
   A pastoral statement proposed by the nation's 13 black prelates
calls for giving blacks more positions of responsibility throughout
the church and integrating African-American cultural symbols into
liturgies and churches.
   Sister Thea Bowman of Canton, Miss., a black nun, said in an
emotional appeal to the bishops that black Catholics sometimes feel
``like a motherless child'' in the church.
   The black and Hispanic bishops met Thursday to begin what they
said would be an ongoing dialogue. One of their first actions was to
send a telegram to President Bush expressing regret over his recent
veto of minimum-wage legislation.
   But the average Catholic may find it hard to draw others into
church.
   Archbishop Edward A. McCarthy of Miami said a recent Gallup Poll
showed only 2 percent of Catholics are involved in evangelization.
   On Vietnam, the conference approved a statement from the bishops'
Committee on International Policy asking the nation to begin to heal
the wounds caused by the war, and start the process of resuming
diplomatic ties with its former enemy.

<HEAD>Government to Create 200,000 Jobs In Troubled Uzbekistan</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARK J. PORUBCANSKY</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   Authorities today announced they would create
200,000 jobs, clean up polluting factories and grow more food in a
region where economic and ecological problems were blamed for
rioting that killed about 100 people.
   The Communist Party newspaper Pravda also reported that the last
of more than 16,000 Meskhi Turks had been evacuated from the Fergana
Valley in the republic of Uzbekistan.
   Rioting that broke out in the Central Asian republic pitted
ethnic Uzbeks against the Meskhi minority, which was forcibly
resettled in the valley by Soviet dictator Josef Stalin in 1944.
   Authorities and residents have given differing accounts of the
reasons for the sudden outbreak of arson and killings on June 3 that
required 9,000 Interior Ministry soldiers and evacuation of the
Meskhi Turks to contain.
   Premier Nikolai I. Ryzhkov said about 100 people were killed in
the violence. Hundreds of homes were destroyed by arsonists.
   Officials have blamed groups of marauders for the violence and
said an investigation was under way to find out who they are.
   Uzbeks and Meskhi Turks said they have been frustrated by a lack
of work, agricultural and industrial pollution, and quotas requiring
them to grow cotton rather than food products.
   The leader of an Uzbek grass-roots movement called the
government's move to improve the economy and environment a good step
but added that it was late and the he doubted the government could
create those jobs by 1990, as it promised.
   ``This is very positive, but they had to think about it much
earlier,'' Abdurakhim Pulatov said in a telephone interview from
Tashkent, the Uzbekistan capital. Pulatov, 44, who heads the Berlik
movement, said he did not believe 200,000 jobs could be created so
quickly.
   He blamed the violence on ``the worsening of the socioeconomic
situation of the native population _ unemployment, poverty and
social injustice.''
   Some reports in the Uzbekistan media have accused the Berlik
movement of being behind the violence. Pulatov denied that.
   Pravda, quoting a Uzbekistan government report, said food
processing plants and sewing factories would be opened to provide
200,000 new jobs by the end of 1990.
   The newspaper said steps would be taken to end the concentration
on cotton production. Some activists charge that the chemical
fertilizers and pesticides used in cotton production is poisoning
the land and leading to malnutrition in a republic once known for
its fruits and vegetables.
   ``To heal the ecological situation, technology at polluting
enterprises will be modernized and reliable pollution control
devices will be created,'' Pravda said without elaboration.
   The newspaper said there was ``no information about new arson,
pogroms or murders'' in reports by military commanders.
   Pravda said an Ilyushin-76 transport plane took the final group
of Meskhi Turks to central Russia on Sunday, ending the evacuation
of 16,282 people.
   The Turks were evacuated from their homes in Fergana and other
cities in the valley to a camp where shelter, food and water were in
short supply.
   Official newspapers on June 12 reported that rioters had tried to
attack the camp and were driven off by soldiers.
   The Meskhi Turks are natives of an area of the Soviet republic of
Georgia, which borders Turkey. For more than 30 years they have been
demanding that they be allowed to return. Ryzhkov promised the
government will study the demand.

Case</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court today barred asbestos
manufacturers from suing the government to recover money they paid
to a Navy shipyard worker injured by inhaling the product.
   The court, without comment, rejected an appeal by two
manufacturers in a case from Washington state.
   Albert Lopez worked as a pipe fitter, pipe coverer and insulator
at the Puget Sound Naval Shipyard in Washington from 1947 to 1984.
   Eagle-Picher Industries Inc. settled a claim against it by paying
Lopez $10,000. Raymark Industries Inc. did the same for $7,200.
   Both manufacturers supplied asbestos to the Navy to insulate
ships.
   Lopez's claims were used in the lower courts as a test case of
the government's liability for injuries suffered by shipyard workers.
   A federal appeals court here ruled last September that the
manufacturers lack any legal basis to recover from the government
the money they pay to settle asbestos-related claims against them.
   The appeals court rejected arguments that the government, by
ordering asbestos, in effect insured the manufacturers against
lawsuits by injured workers.
   The appeals court said the manufacturers seem to be suggesting
that the government ``knew more about the hazards of asbestos than
it ever disclosed to its suppliers.''
   The manufacturers appear to be arguing that if they knew of the
dangers ``they would have gone out of the asbestos business at once
and saved themselves untold liability or else would have purchased
all the insurance available and passed the cost on ... in sharply
higher prices,'' the appeals court said.
   ``We may have to suppress our wonderment that anyone would have
known more about the hazards of asbestos than those responsible
companies who used it as raw material,'' the court continued.
   But, it added, even if the government knew more about the dangers
of asbestos than the manufacturers, there still is no legal basis
for the companies to recover the money.
   The Bush administration urged the justices to reject the
companies' appeal.
   Justice Department lawyers noted that the high court ruled last
year that defense contractors are immune from personal-injury
lawsuits when they follow government specifications and warn the
government of any dangers of which they are aware.
   But that ruling does not shield manufacturers of products found
to cause injury independent of government specifications for their
use, the government lawyers said.
   The cases are Eagle-Picher vs. U.S., 88-1382, and Raymark vs.
U.S., 88-1418.

   A retiring FBI agent says he knows who killed
Jimmy Hoffa but can't say.
   ``I'm comfortable I know who did it, but it's never going to be
prosecuted because we would have to divulge informants, confidential
sources,'' Kenneth P. Walton, FBI chief in Detroit from 1985 to
1988, said in Sunday's Detroit News.
   ``There was more than one person who killed Jimmy Hoffa or was
involved in the efforts. (But) we can't force a source, for example,
to testify,'' said the 24-year agent.
   Walton declined to be specific but said some informants and
suspects are dead.
   Hoffa's son said the FBI could ease the family's pain by
dispelling some of the mystery surrounding the 1975 disappearance of
the former Teamsters boss.
   ``I think it is incumbent upon the FBI, if in fact they do know
who was involved in the slaying of my father, that they share that
information with the family,'' James Hoffa said in today's Detroit
Free Press.

<HEAD>Court Refuses to Reinstate Former Maryland Governor's Conviction</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICHARD CARELLI</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court today refused to reinstate
former Maryland Gov. Marvin Mandel's 1977 mail-fraud conviction,
thrown out five years after he completed a prison term.
   The court, without comment, rejected a Bush administration appeal
aimed at using Mandel's case to set guidelines on when someone may
challenge a fraud conviction for which the sentence already was
served.
   Mandel and five others were convicted of charges stemming from an
alleged scheme in which the governor supported legislation favorable
to Marlboro Race Track in return for gifts worth more than $380,000.
   The race track's five owners _ W. Dale Hess, Harry W. Rodgers
III, William A. Rodgers, Irvin Kovens and Ernest N. Cory _ also were
convicted in 1977. Their convictions also were thrown out after they
had completed their respective sentences.
   The government appeal acted on today also sought to reinstate
those five convictions.
   At Mandel's trial, prosecutors charged that Mandel used his
influence as governor to help the track. Jurors were told by the
judge that Mandel could be convicted of mail fraud if they found
that Mandel had deprived citizens of their ``intangible rights'' to
his honest services.
   Mandel was convicted and sentenced to four years in prison. He
had served 19 months when the remainder was commuted. He also was
disbarred because of the conviction.
   Hess served 18 months of a three-year sentence and paid $40,000
in fines. Harry Rodgers and Kovens each served three years in prison
and paid $40,000 in fines; William Rodgers served his year-and-a-day
sentence and paid $40,000 in fines. Cory's 18-month sentence was
suspended.
   The Supreme Court in 1987, deciding an unrelated case, ruled that
federal mail fraud law does not protect against schemes to defraud
people of their intangible rights such as the right to honest
government.
   Mandel and the five others then sought to have their convictions
thrown out and the paid fines returned. A federal judge granted that
relief, and the ruling was upheld last Dec. 7 by the a 2-1 vote of
the 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals.
   The appeals court said it could not determine whether the
convictions had been based on the ``intangible rights'' aspect or
some other aspect not affected by the Supreme Court's 1987 ruling.
   ``In a case in which the jury considers alternate theories of
liability, we must reverse the convictions if either theory is an
improper basis for punishment,'' the 4th Circuit court said.
   That ruling conflicts with one issued by another federal appeals
court. The 7th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals recently upheld the
conviction of former Chicago Councilman Thomas E. Keane for
conspiring illegally to buy and sell tax-delinquent properties.
   The 7th Circuit court ruled that Keane was not entitled to have
his conviction overturned even though jurors had been instructed
about the since-invalidated ``intangible rights'' aspect of federal
mail fraud law because other evidence could support a conviction.
   The Supreme Court on May 22 refused to hear Keane's appeal.
   In the Mandel case acted on today, government lawyers said the
justices should clear up ``the considerable confusion'' in the lower
courts as to when such convictions should be overturned.
   The case is U.S. vs. Mandel, 88-1759.

   Solidarity continued its domination of
Poland's national elections today by winning eight of the nine seats
still left open to the opposition in a parliamentary runoff.
   But voters demonstrated widespread apathy to races in which only
communist candidates were competing. Only in races featuring
Solidarity-backed candidates did turnout exceed 25 percent.
   Sunday's runoff elections were for candidates who failed to draw
at least 50 percent of the vote during the initial round on June 4.
Because of the poor communist showing in the early round, most of
the runoff races featured only communist candidates and their
contests were widely ignored.
   Final results were not expected until Tuesday. But the low voter
turnout in the contested communist races and Solidarity's continued
success was another setback for the government.
   Also, it was apparent from unofficial returns that progressive
communists were besting hardliners in several races.
   ``The post-election shock has brought about a need for a deep
analysis of the situation,'' Politburo member Leszek Miller said in
an interview with the Communist Party newspaper Trybuna Ludu today.
``The party is faced with the most serious problems in its whole
history.''
   Solidarity was allowed run for all seats in the newly created
100-member Senate and 35 percent of the seats in the existing Sejm.
In the first round, it won 92 seats in the Senate and 160 of the 161
it was alloted in the Sejm.
   Based on unofficial projections from Sunday's runoff balloting,
Solidarity picked up an additional seven seats in the Senate _
giving it 99 out of 100 seats _ and the one seat still available to
it in the Sejm.
   The victory Sunday of Henryk Stoklosa, a rich fodder farmer
backed by the communists, prevented a Solidarity sweep of the Senate.
   Stoklosa had waged Poland's most expensive election campaign
ever, plastering his district in the western province of Pila with a
Western-style advertising blitz and hosting picnics with free beer
and sausages.
   The State Election Commission estimated nationwide turnout in
Sunday's second round at 25.31 percent, the lowest on record in
postwar Poland. Turnout was higher only in the six provinces with
Solidarity candidates.
   The communists, because they were guaranteed a majority under the
historic April accord that allowed the Solidarity-led opposition to
compete in the elections, will have 299 seats in the Sejm to
Solidarity's 161.
   The Senate has veto power over laws passed in the Sejm. But
because Solidarity won all of the seats alloted to it in the Sejm,
that body would be unable to generate the two-thirds majority needed
to override a Senate veto.
   Several promininet communists, including Warsaw party leader
Janusz Kubaszewicz, Manfred Gorywoda, leader of the southern
industrial region of Katowice, and Construction Minister Bogumil
Ferensztajn were among the communist candidates who failed to win
Sejm seats in the second round. All three are considered hardliners.
   But communist-coalition candidates who received backing from
local Solidarity committees did well. Among those elected were
former Gdansk party leader Tadeusz Fizbach, a liberal who signed the
agreements in 1980 that first legalized Solidarity, and Andrzej
Bratkowski, a brother of a prominent opposition journalist.
   Solidarity sought to build its power in the Sejm by taking the
unusual step of endorsing the most reform-oriented Communist
coalition hopefuls.
   Union leader Lech Walesa, voting before church near his Gdansk
home, said ``the real game, looking from the point of view of
Solidarity, has already taken place,'' the state-run PAP news agency
reported.
   But he said he encourged participation because ``one should elect
people who are in favor of reform.''
   Polish leader Gen. Wojciech Jaruzelski said as he voted in Warsaw
that ending the pre-determined elections of the past was a ``risk''
for the ruling Communists, but was necessary if reform is to
succeed. ``So far what is important is that we are talking to each
other,'' Jaruzelski said.
   Even before the voting ended, attention had started to focus on
the government changes expected to follow.
   The Communist Party plans a Central Committee meeting at the end
of the month to decide on a candidate for the new post of president,
who will in turn nominate the next prime minister.
   Solidarity too must take its stand on the presidency, and decide
what role it will play when it takes its place in the National
Assembly.

<HEAD>Writer Threatened with Deportation Loses Supreme Court Appeal</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Margaret Randall, a professor and writer
threatened with deportation from the United States for supporting
communism, lost a Supreme Court appeal today.
   The court, without comment, left intact a ruling that it is
premature to consider the constitutional and legal issues she raised.
   Her appeal is supported by a number of prominent writers,
including Norman Mailer, Arthur Miller, Toni Morrison, William
Styron and Kurt Vonnegut.
   Ms. Randall lost her U.S. citizenship after leaving this country
in 1961. She lived in Mexico, Cuba and Nicaragua, writing about
social change and revolution in Third World nations.
   She returned to this country on a visitor's visa in 1984, and has
been living in Albuquerque, N.M., near her elderly parents while
teaching at the University of New Mexico.
   Ms. Randall applied for permanent resident status in 1984, a step
toward regaining her U.S. citizenship. But the application was
rejected by an official of the Immigration and Naturalization
Service in El Paso, Texas.
   The official based the rejection on Ms. Randall's ``association
with and her activities and writing in support of the
communist-dominated governments of Cuba, North Vietnam and
Nicaragua.'' The official said those activities and writings ``go
far beyond mere dissent.''
   The U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals here ruled last year that it is
premature for the federal courts to consider the merits of Ms.
Randall's case.
   The appeals court said it is likely she never will be deported,
and because of a change in federal law it appears she eventually
will be allowed to regain her citizenship.
   The appeals court noted that a move to block her deportation is
pending before the U.S. Board of Immigration Appeals.
   The appeals court also pointed out that Congress in 1988
generally made it illegal to deny a visa or an application for
permanent resident status to anyone based on their beliefs,
statements or associations.
   ``It therefore appears that the larger question initially raised
_ whether Margaret Randall could regain United States citizenship _
is now reduced to the question, when can she regain it,'' the
appeals court said.
   Her lawyers argued that postponing her opportunity to regain
citizenship is causing her serious harm.
   The case is Randall vs. Thornburgh, 88-1412.

<HEAD>Pacific Islanders Lose Bid for More Nuclear-Test Compensation</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court today barred additional U.S.
compensation to inhabitants of the Marshall Islands for the effects
of nuclear-weapons testing there more than 30 years ago.
   The court, without comment, let stand a ruling that threw out a
lawsuit by residents of the Pacific island republic.
   U.S. and Marshall Island officials signed an agreement in 1983
requiring the United States to set up a $150 million fund, with
annual interest paid to those affected by nuclear testing conducted
from 1946 to 1958.
   The pact also created a tribunal to award additional funds to
those with valid claims.
   Island residents were evacuated before the tests, which vaporized
five islands and made the area unfit for habitation for 33 years.
Residents living on other islands downwind from the blasts moved out
as recently as 1985 for fear of continued radiation.
   A federal appeals court here ruled that the 1983 agreement _
supported by legislation that took effect in 1986 _ bars island
inhabitants from suing the United States for additional compensation.
   ``We are unpersuaded that judicial intervention is appropriate at
this time on the mere speculation that the alternative remedy may
prove to be inadequate,'' the appeals court said.
   The case is People of Enewetak vs. U.S., 88-1466.

<TEXT>
   U.S.-Soviet talks on cutting long-range nuclear
forces reopened today after a seven-month recess with few prospects
of an early breakthrough in the 4-year-old negotiations.
   While Washington reportedly planned to press Moscow over the
inspection provisions of a future treaty, both sides have indicated
no change in their stands on other major oustanding issues.
   The two new chief delegates, Richard Burt and Yuri Nazarkin,
launched the 11th round of Geneva talks since March 1985 with a
meeting at the U.S. mission.
   After the 80-minute session, Burt told reporters he had outlined
``President Bush's overall approach to arms control, emphasizing the
president's commitment to reducing the risk of nuclear war.''
   ``I hope we will make some progress,'' he said.
   Nazarkin said, ``I'm satisfied. It was a good start.'' He said
Moscow may put forth new proposals ``in due time.'' He did not
elaborate.
   Burt, a military expert and former U.S. ambassador to West
Germany, replaced veteran arms negotiator Max Kampelman.
   Nazarkin replaced Alexei Obukhov and had been chief Soviet envoy
at the 40-nation Conference on Disarmament, which has been seeking
for years to complete a treaty banning chemical weapons worldwide.
   Along with the Strategic Arms Reduction Talks, negotiators will
resume talks on space and defense issues. Detailed negotiations are
due to begin Wednesday with a full meeting of both delegations at
the Soviet mission.
   The session, expected to last six weeks, comes against the
backdrop of recent progress and superpower initiatives in talks on
conventional disarmament in Europe.
   Resumption of the talks was delayed by the Bush administration's
review of national security policy during the Reagan presidency.
   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said Friday ``there will
be a considerable degree of continuity'' in the U.S. position, while
not ruling out some adjustments.
   One new element is a U.S. proposal for on-site trial inspections
to monitor some cuts of long-range ballistic missiles already
written into a draft treaty, Washington officials said. A Pentagon
official said Bush wants to take advantage of the new Soviet
openness.
   It would be the first time in superpower arms control that
verification begins during talks rather than once a treaty is
completed.
   But neither side has hinted at movement on disputes over the
Pentagon's space-based ``Star Wars'' missile defense, sea-launched
cruise missiles and mobile land-based missiles.
   The Soviets say the U.S. missile shield, or Strategic Defense
Initiative, violates the 1972 superpower Anti-Ballistic Missile
treaty.
   And disputes have developed over Moscow's demand for including
sea-based cruise missiles under the treaty and Washington's call for
a ban on mobile missiles.
   Admiral William J. Crowe Jr., chairman of the Joint Chiefs of
Staff, has predicted ``protracted and agonizing'' negotiations.
   Much of a draft treaty to cut each side's long-range, or
strategic, nuclear forces by 30 to 50 percent has been agreed in
previous rounds.
   START is intended to cover nuclear weapons with which the
superpowers can strike each other, including those considered most
dangerous _ sea- and land-based ballistic missiles and heavy bombers.
   Delegates are to begin the new session by reviewing agreements
already contained in the 400-page draft text.
   Among the agreements in earlier rounds are lowered ceilings of
6,000 nuclear warheads and 1,600 delivery vehicles _ missiles and
bombers _ for each side. Outlines of a system for monitoring
compliance were also set.

<HEAD>Church Criticizes Proposal to Outlaw Criticism of Government</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARCOS ALEMAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SAN SALVADOR, El Salvador (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Archbishop Gregorio Rosa Chavez
criticized a right-wing proposal to virtually outlaw criticism of
the government.
   The so-called ``law in defense of democracy'' contradicts its
name, the Roman Catholic prelate said during his Sunday homily.
   It prescribes a ``medicine worse than the disease'' and could
take El Salvador back to the ``dark times'' of the early 1980s when
death squads killed thousands of people considered government
critics, he said.
   ARENA, the rightist Republican Nationalist Alliance, drafted a
law providing fines and imprisonment for those who oppose the
government or its policies, including journalists and protest
marchers.
   President Alfredo Cristiani's new administration was to introduce
the bill in the National Assembly on Thursday, but it failed to
without explaining why.
   Rosa Chavez said the proposal takes a partisan view of the
violence in El Salvador because it treats terrorism as something
committed only by leftists.
   Human rights and international organizations say rightist death
squads and the military are responsible for the majority of civilian
deaths in nine years of civil war. About 70,000 people, mainly
civilians, have died in the war between the U.S.-backed government
and left-wing guerrillas.
   Rosa Chavez said terrorism also includes ``terrorism of the
state.''
   He said Vice President Dan Quayle, in a meeting with Roman
Catholic Church leaders during his recent visit to El Salvador,
``spoke of liberty, of democracy but not of justice... He didn't
touch on the problem of injustice.''

<HEAD>Man Convicted of Conspiring to Bribe Nevada Senator Loses Appeal</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICHARD CARELLI</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court today refused to hear the
appeal of one of five men convicted in a scheme to bribe then-U.S.
Sen. Howard Cannon of Nevada.
   The justices, without comment, let stand Joseph Lombardo's
bribery conspiracy and wire fraud conviction, for which he was
sentenced to 15 years in prison and fined.
   Lombardo's co-defendants were Roy L. Williams, president of the
Central Conference of Teamsters; Allen Dorfman, a former special
consultant to the Teamsters Central States Pension Fund; Thomas F.
O'Malley, a pension fund trustee; and Andrew G. Massa, a former
pension fund trustee.
   A federal appeals court said that Lombardo's vocation at the time
as ``something of a mystery.''
   The 1982 convictions arose out of what prosecutors said was a
scheme to sell a piece of Las Vegas property to Cannon. The senator
was not charged in the case.
   The property, known as Wonderworld and owned by the union pension
fund, was located across the street from Cannon's residence.
   In late 1978, Cannon and a group of neighbors expressed interest
in purchasing the property to prevent it from being commercially
developed.
   At the time, legislation designed to deregulate the trucking
industry was pending in Congress. The Teamsters opposed the
deregulation, and considered Cannon, then chairman of the Senate
Commerce Committee, to be in a position to affect the legislation's
future.
   Prosecutors said Williams and Dorfman, seeking to influence
Cannon's actions on the legislation, promised to take steps so the
senator's group could purchase the Las Vegas property from the
pension fund for $1.4 million even if higher bids were received.
   The property, however, eventually was sold to an unrelated
corporation for $1.6 million.
   In the appeal acted on today, lawyers for Lombardo argued that
his conviction was based solely on a scheme to deprive the pension
fund of the ``intangible right'' to honest service from its trustees.
   The Supreme Court in 1987 ruled that mail-fraud convictions could
not be based on a theory that citizens' rights to honest government
had been violated.
   ``The underlying indictment is fatally defective under (the 1987
ruling),'' Lombardo's appeal contended.
   But Justice Department lawyers urged the high court to reject the
appeal. They said the jury, in convicting Lombardo, had to find that
he tried to defraud the union pension fund of real property _ the
value of the Las Vegas property.
   Although the scheme to sell the property to Cannon for $1.4
million ``deprived the pension fund of the loyal services of its
trustees, it also clearly contemplated depriving the pension fund of
the highest price for the Wonderworld property,'' government lawyers
said.
   A federal trial judge and the 7th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals
previously rejected Lombardo's arguments.
   The case is Lombardo vs. U.S., 88-1616.

   The Supreme Court today refused to kill a
nine-year-old lawsuit in which the Catawba Indian Tribe claims
ownership of 225 square miles of South Carolina.
   The justices, without comment, let stand a federal appeals court
ruling that last January revived the tribe's efforts to recover
some, but not all, of the claimed land.
   The land in dispute encompasses the city of Rock Hill, the town
of Fort Mill and several smaller communities.
   The 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruling barred the tribe
from recovering either possession of land or damages from people who
have held the land for 10 years between July 1, 1962, and Oct. 20,
1980.
   But the appeals court's 4-2 ruling said the Catawbas may proceed
with their effort to recover possession and damages from all others.
   In the appeal acted on today, South Carolina Attorney General T.
Travis Medlock and lawyers for numerous landowners argued that the
tribe had waited too long before filing its 1980 lawsuit.
   ``If review is not granted now, it may be a decade or more before
this court has the opportunity to completely resolve the potentially
dispositive (deadline) issue,'' the appeal said.
   ``Years of continuing litigation will result in a cloud on land
titles requiring innocent citizens to defend their homes and
businesses in protracted litigation at great expense.'' it added.
   The tribe's lawsuit contends that an 1840 treaty under which the
tribe transferred the disputed land to South Carolina was invalid
because the federal government did not participate in or approve the
treaty.
   When Congress passed a law that revoked the tribe's constitution
effective July 1, 1962, the tribe's land claim became subject to
South Carolina's statute of limitations.
   Medlock and the other lawyers seeking to have the tribe's suit
dismissed contend that the tribe had no longer than 10 years from
that 1962 date to sue.
   The appeal also argued that the Catawbas' claim to ``Indian
title'' is ``merely a right of occupancy'' and not ``legal title
within the meaning of a South Carolina statute.''
   Lawyers for the tribe urged the justices to reject the appeal,
saying the 10-year deadline cited by the state's lawyers does not
apply in this case.
   They also said the appeals court correctly ruled that, under
federal law, Indian title is legal title.
   The case is South Carolina vs. Catawba Indian Tribe of South
Carolina, 88-1752.

<HEAD>Court Won't Revive Civil Suit Against California Highway Patrol</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court today refused to revive a
$100 million lawsuit against the California Highway Patrol by the
parents of a woman raped and killed by a member of the police force.
   The court, without comment, let stand a ruling that threw out the
civil rights suit.
   Merlin and June Bishop sued after their 23-year-old daughter,
Robin, was killed by Patrolman George Michael Gwaltney on Jan. 11,
1982.
   Gwaltney was sentenced to 90 years in prison for depriving Ms.
Bishop of her civil rights.
   Prosecutors said Gwaltney stopped the young woman while she was
driving from Los Angeles to her home in Las Vegas, Nev. They said he
handcuffed her, raped her in the back seat of his car and then shot
her.
   In their suit, the Bishops said Gwaltney's superior officers were
aware of his ``prurient propensities,'' and that he had forced other
women to have sex with him after stopping them for supposed traffic
violations.
   The suit accused the Highway Patrol of condoning such conduct as
long as its officers handed out enough traffic tickets.
   ``Gwaltney's antics and attitude were known to his supervisor and
encouraged as part of a pattern and practice of playboy tolerance,''
the Bishops said.
   A California appeals court threw out the suit last January,
saying it ``is entirely without merit, if not specious.''
   The appeals court said the federal civil rights law the Bishops
invoked is limited to claims against ``persons.''
   ``There is not a shred of (legal) authority to support the
assertion that the state of California is a person,'' the state
court said.
   Even if the Highway Patrol could be sued under the federal civil
rights law, the state court said, the Bishops would have to show
that the attack on their daughter was part of its official policy.
   The Bishops ``did not and could not allege that the California
Highway Patrol had an official policy that its officers should rape
and kill female motorists,'' the state court said.
   The case is Bishop vs. Gwaltney, 88-527.

<TEXT>
   Iran's presidential election will be held
July 28, three weeks earlier than planned, and the new president
will begin his four-year term before the official October starting
date, Iran said today.
   The official Islamic Republic News Agency, monitored in Nicosia,
said the Interior Ministry announcement gave no reason for advancing
the election from the scheduled date of Aug. 18.
   But the move appeared to be aimed at speeding up the transition
of power following the June 3 death of Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini
and consolidating control under his successor, President Ali
Khamanei, and his likely successor as head of state, Parliament
Speaker Hashemi Rafsanjani.
   The Interior Ministry said that a national referendum on major
constitutional amendments, which had also been scheduled for Aug.
18, will be held July 28 as well.
   Earlier today, Tehran's radical Jomhuri Islami daily quoted a
source as saying the election was moved forward because Khamenei had
been elected as Iran's supreme leader by the 83-member Assembly of
Experts, which was formed in 1979 to ensure a smooth succession when
Khomeini died.
   ``Because of the selection of Ayatollah Khamenei as leader ...
and the need for the election of a president as soon as possible,
the officials in charge of the election proposed the date be brought
forward,'' the paper said.
   The newspaper also said the new president would begin his term
``a little sooner than the scheduled date.''
   Khamenei's second term term officially ends Oct. 5. He is
forbidden under the 1979 revolutionary constitution from running for
a third term.
   Rafsanjani, Khamanei's political ally in the so-called pragmatist
camp in Tehran's fractious hierarchy, is the only declared candidate
so far. The Iranian media have in recent days taken his election as
a foregone conclusion.
   Rafsanjani, who is also commander-in-chief of Iran's armed
forces, has been endorsed by Khamenei and several influential
factions.
   Analysts have predicted that Khamenei, 49, and Rafsanjani, 55,
face challenges from radical rivals such as Interior Minister Ali
Akbar Mohtashemi and possibly Khomeini's son, Ahmad, 43, who has
shown increased political ambitions in recent months.
   The pragmatists are said to favor ending Iran's isolation and
opening up the economy to wider free enterprise, mainly to secure
foreign aid for Iran's reconstruction program following a cease-fire
in the 8-year war with Iraq.
   The anti-Western radicals seek to tighten state control of the
economy and to retain the goal of spreading Khomeini's
fundamentalist revolution to the Moslem world as a bulwark of Iran's
foreign policy.
   The constitutional amendments, which are being formulated by a
committee appointed by Khomeini, are widely expected to enhance the
presidency with more executive powers, at the expense of the prime
ministry, to eliminate competing power structures which have snarled
the decision-making process for years.
   That would give Khamenei and Rafsanjani formidable power in the
post-Khomeini era with which to fend off any challenge from the
radicals.

   The Supreme Court today agreed to hear the
appeal of Mississippi death row inmate Chandler Clemons, convicted
of killing a delivery man who was robbed of $5 in cash and a few
pizzas.
   The justices said they will decide whether Clemons was sentenced
fairly after an appeals court reweighed the aggravating and
mitigating circumstances present in his case.
   Clemons' appeal said Mississippi law gives exclusive sentencing
authority in capital cases to juries, and that the appeals court's
action therefore violated his rights.
   His appeal did not challenge the underlying murder conviction.
   Prosecutors said Clemons plotted with others to rob a pizza
delivery man, and ordered a pizza by telephone to carry out the
scheme.
   Clemons used a shotgun to kill Arthur Shorter, prosecutors said,
because he thought Shorter might be able to identify him.
   The case is Clemons vs. Mississippi, 88-6873.

<HEAD>Court Rejects Alaska's Bid for More Control over Indian Fishing</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court today rejected an appeal in
which Alaska officials sought greater control over Indian fishing in
federal waters within their state.
   The court, without comment, let stand a ruling in favor of the
Kenaitze Indian Tribe.
   The tribe, with about 400 members, has depended on fishing and
hunting for its subsistence for hundreds of years.
   A federal law enacted in 1980 protects subsistence fishing by
giving it priority over commercial and sport fishing in federal
waters in rural areas.
   But Alaska officials said the changing economy in the Kenai
Peninsula near Anchorage has transformed the region from a rural
area.
   A 1987 state law defines a rural area as one in which ``the
non-commercial, customary and traditional use of fish or game for
personal or family consumption is a principal characteristic of the
economy.''
   State officials said that by that standard the recently
commercialized Kenai Peninsula is no longer rural.
   But the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals said the ``creative
redefinition'' of rural is a ``transparent'' move ``to protect
commercial and sport-fishing interests.''
   The appeals court noted that the peninsula has some 25,000 people
spread out over an area roughly the size of Vermont and New
Hampshire combined.
   Alaska's definition of rural ``would exclude practically all
areas of the United States that we think of as rural, including
virtually the entirety of such farming and ranching states as Iowa
and Wyoming,'' the appeals court said.
   The Alaska attorney general's office said the ruling may deprive
Alaska of control over fishing and hunting in 60 percent of the
state.
   The case is Alaska vs. Kenaitze Indian Tribe, 88-1642.

<HEAD>Court Leaves $1 Million Fine Intact Against Maryland Paper Mill Operator</HEAD>

   The Supreme Court today left intact a fine of
nearly $1 million against a Maryland paper mill operator that failed
to comply with a federal clean water law's reporting requirements.
   The court, without comment, rejected a challenge to a key
provision of the act authorizing citizens and environmental groups
to sue alleged polluters.
   Simkins Industries Inc. runs a paper mill in Catonsville, Md., on
the banks of the Patapsco River.
   The Sierra Club sued the company for failing to monitor and file
quarterly reports on discharges into the river from Aug. 1, 1981, to
March 31, 1984.
   Under the federal Clean Water Act, the company's permit to
operate the mill required it to monitor discharges and report them.
   Simkins faced fines of up to $10,000 a day, or a total of $9.77
million. A federal judge assessed penalties of one-tenth that
amount, $977,000, payable to the U.S. Treasury.
   There was testimony that the company's plant supervisor did not
regard sampling of its discharges as a priority.
   The Sierra Club, based in California with members nationwide,
charged that Simkins had discharged copper into the Patapso at
10,000 times the safe levels for fresh water, and that oil and
grease in the river from the mill were twice the allowable limit.
   The company said the Sierra Club did not have the legal authority
to sue it because the club suffered no direct injury, and also that
the suit should be dismissed because it was filed after Simkins
stopped violating the law's reporting requirements.
   The 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals last May upheld the fine.
   The appeals court said the Sierra Club established that at least
one of its members who uses the Patapsco River for recreation was
injured by Simkins' violations.
   Fines for failure to monitor and report possible pollution ``can
be an important deterrence against future violations,'' the appeals
court added.
   The appeals court, citing a 1987 Supreme Court decision, said
such private citizen suits under the clean water law may not be
``based upon wholly past violations.''
   The appeals court added that Simkins was violating the law at the
time the suit was filed in late 1984. The company did not file a
complete quarterly report until January 1985, nearly three months
after the Sierra Club filed suit.
   ``It is true that Simkins' failure to sample occurred solely
before Sierra Club filed suit,'' the appeals court said. ``But
Simkins' monitoring obgligations were not designed to be a mere
academic exercise.''
   ``Unless a permit holder monitors as required, it will be
difficult if not impossible for state and federal officials...to
know whether or not the permit holder is discharging effluents in
excess of the permit's maximum levels.''
   The appeals court also noted that Simkins began monitoring its
discharges after it was alerted by the Sierra Club that it was about
to be sued.
   The case is Simkins vs. Sierra Club, 88-660.

<TEXT>
   The most serious dissident movement in the
United Auto Workers in 40 years lost its first test of strength at
the union's constitutional convention.
   Amid sometimes raucous debate during Sunday's opening session,
more than 2,000 delegates rejected motions challenging elections
weeks ago in UAW locals in the Detroit area and the south-central
United States.
   Based on Sunday's voting, the dissidents had support from 10
percent to 20 percent of the delegates.
   Jerry Tucker, leader of the dissident movement called New
Directions, was philosophical about the setback. ``The decisions
that may be made here are not necessarily reflective of where the
rank-and-file may be,'' he said.
   Tucker's movement has charged that the UAW under President Owen
Bieber has become too cozy with management. New Directions is
pushing a resolution that would force the union to back locals
opposing labor-management cooperation.
   Later this week, Tucker said, New Directions will push for
unionwide, rank-and-file election of officers.
   Approval would scrap the representative form the UAW will use to
re-elect Bieber to a third three-year term as leader of the
1-million-member union. Bieber is unopposed.
   New Directions represents the most serious dissident movement in
the 54-year-old UAW since the factionalism of the union's first
decade. Walter Reuther solidified control of the union after taking
office in 1946.
   In his keynote address before the debate on delegate seating,
Bieber blasted the New Directions movement without mentioning the
group by name.
   ``To be frank,'' Bieber said, ``I think those who say that
workers don't want change in the workplace, who insist that the old
ways were always the best ways, are insulting the intelligence of
UAW members.''
   He defended his leadership, saying the union will keep management
at arm's length even while involving itself in joint programs with
automakers.
   ``So let me assure you, and let me warn any employers who may
have formed the wrong idea of where this union is heading,'' he
said. ``Where the power of persuasion fails, we will use the
persuasion of power without hesitation.''

   Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher's Conservative
Party was trounced today by socialists in elections for the European
Parliament.
   The Labor Party, inflicting Mrs. Thatcher's first defeat in a
national ballot since she won power 10 years ago, seized Tory
districts across the country and won a solid majority of British
seats in the European Economic Community's assembly.
   ``The results were disappointing, but we shall renew our efforts
for next time,'' Mrs. Thatcher said in a letter to Conservative
Party Chairman Peter Brooke.
   With the economy in trouble, Labor's big 10.4 percent swing
against the government fueled charges that Mrs. Thatcher's
free-market revolution isn't working any more.
   ``We've not done well,'' Energy Secretary Cecil Parkinson
acknowledged. ``This is a warning to the government.''
   Labor leader Neil Kinnock burst into song in Welsh as he arrived
at the party's London headquarters in the early hours. Results
pouring in showed socialists posting gains from Scotland to the
Tories' southern English heartlands.
   Labor won 45 of the 78 seats allocated to mainland Britain
compared with its previous total of 32. The Conservatives fell to 32
seats from 45. The Scottish National Party retained its one seat.
   Results were expected later today from the three seats in
British-run Northern Ireland where voting splits along Protestant
and Roman Catholic lines.
   The Tory share of the vote slumped to 34.15 percent, compared
with 42 percent at the 1987 general election when Mrs. Thatcher won
a third five-year term and 40.8 percent in the last European
elections in 1984.
   Labor had 40.23 percent, up from 30.8 percent in the 1987 British
election and up from 36.5 percent in the 1984 European elections.
   In a meteoric performance, Britain's tiny Green Party scooped up
15 percent of the vote, partly at the expense of the centrist Social
and Liberal Demoratic Party whose share collapsed to 6 percent.
   However, the British Greens will get no seats. Unlike in other
West European countries, only coming first in a district counts and
seats are not allocated according to vote share.
   Although only about one-third of eligible Britons voted, as is
traditional in European elections, government leaders acknowledged
that Kinnock had succeeded in turning the ballot into a referendum
on Mrs. Thatcher.
   ``We have got to get inflation under control. We have got to
stick together. We have got to make sure the electorate understands
the consequences of electing a Labor government,'' said Parkinson.
   For Labor, which has lost three general elections in a row, the
major boost was pushing its vote above the 40 percent it needs to
oust Mrs. Thatcher at the next general election. This must be held
by mid-1992.
   ``These are winning ways and there is more to come,'' Kinnock
told reporters.
   Fuelled by a credit boom and high wage settlements reminscent of
the pre-Thatcher era, Britain's 8.3 percent inflation rate is among
the highest in the EEC. Union militancy is also growing.
   Reluctant to raise taxes, the Thatcher government is trying with
no sign of success to curb inflation by increasing interest rates _
now at 14 percent and hitting home-owners and businessmen.
   The defeat also increased fears within the party that her
combative stance with other members of the EEC is losing votes as
the 1992 deadline for turning the community into a single market
approaches.

<HEAD>Connecticut Beer-Pricing Law Struck Down as Unconstitutional</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICHARD CARELLI</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court today struck down a
Connecticut law aimed at assuring that beer sold in the state costs
no more than it does in three neighboring states.
   By a 6-3 vote, the court said such laws unconstitutionally
interfere with interstate commerce.
   ``This kind of potential regional and even national regulation of
the pricing mechanism for goods is reserved by the (Constitution's)
commerce clause to the federal government,'' Justice Harry A.
Blackmun wrote for the court.
   He said such price regulation ``may not be accomplished piecemeal
through the extraterritorial reach of individual state statutes.''
   Today's decision upheld a federal appeals court ruling that had
invalidated the Connecticut law.
   The justice in 1983 had split 5-3 in striking down as
unconstitutional a similar Connecticut law.
   The earlier version prohibited brewers from selling brands of
beer in the state at a price higher than the lowest price which
those beers sold for in New York, Massachusetts and Rhode Island.
Under that law, the controlling price was changed each month.
   The retail price of beer generally has been higher in Connecticut
than in its neighboring states, and many Connecticut consumers buy
beer in one of the three other states.
   The earlier law was struck down because it was deemed to affect
the price of beer outside Connecticut by locking beer prices in all
four states for one-month periods to the level posted in Connecticut.
   The 1984 Connecticut law ruled on today, however, stated that the
posted Connecticut beer prices had only to reflect the lowest prices
being offered ``at the time of the posting.''
   The law, in theory, did not prevent brewers from lowering prices
in the three neighboring states ``at any time during the calendar
month covered by such posting.''
   Blackmun said the 1984 impermissibly requires out-of-state
brewers to take account of their Connecticut prices when setting
prices in the three other states.
   For example, he said, the Connecticut law deprives out-of-state
brewers of the advantage of making promotional and volume discounts
in the three neighboring states.
   ``Because volume discounts are permitted in Massachusetts, New
York and Rhode Island, but not in Connecticut, the effect of
Connecticut's affirmation scheme is to deter volume discounts in
each of these other states, because the lowest of the
volume-discounted prices would have to be offered as the regular
price for an entire month in Connecticut,'' Blackmun said.
   Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist and Justices John Paul Stevens
and Sandra Day O'Connor dissented.
   The case is Healy vs. Beer Institute, 88-449.

<TEXT>
   Pipe bombs exploded early today
outside a Bank of Boston branch and a nearby U.S. Army recruiting
office, police said. No injuries were reported, and damage was
slight.
   There have now been four bombings in Puerto Rico since Friday,
when a Senate panel opened hearings in San Juan on a proposed vote
on the Spanish-speaking island's future political relationship with
the United States.
   Los Macheteros, an extremist pro-independence group, claimed
responsibility for the explosions today in Bayamon, a town 15 miles
outside San Juan.
   In a typewritten letter delivered to The Associated Press bureau,
the group said it planted the bombs to protest, among other things,
the ``farcical plebiscite'' planned for 1991, and the imprisonment
of a Macheteros member in the $7 million robbery of a Wells Fargo
depot in Hartford, Conn., in 1983.
   The group said the campaign of violence would continue until the
United States ended its military, political and economic presence in
Puerto Rico.
   The two explosions today occurred within an hour of each other,
said police spokeswoman Maria del Pilar Bon. She said one bomb
slightly damaged the bank building's fascade and shattered windows
of a nearby bus terminal. The other blast shattered windows of the
recruiting office.
   On Sunday, a pipe bomb exploded at a Chase Manhattan Bank branch
in Caguas, in the north-central part of the island, causing an
estimated $4,000 damage but no injuries. On Friday, a pipe bomb went
off in a U.S. customs office in the southern city of Ponce, causing
no injuries and only minimal damage.
   No group claimed responsibility for the explosions Sunday and
Friday.
   The U.S. Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee is holding
hearings in San Juan on the proposed vote on whether Puerto Rico
should remain a U.S. commonwealth, become the 51st U.S. state or
seek independence.
   The Caribbean island of 3.2 million people, which Spain ceded to
the United States in 1898 following the Spanish-American War, has
been a U.S. commonwealth since 1952. Residents in 1967 voted to
remain a commonwealth.
   On Thursday, a federal court in Hartford sentenced a Puerto Rican
nationalist and Macheteros member, Juan Segarra Palmer, to 65 years
in prison and fined him $500,000 for his part in the Wells Fargo
attack.

   Rain-swollen rivers burst their banks in
northern and eastern Bangladesh, washing away mud-and-straw houses
and leaving at least 10,000 people homeless, officials and news
reports said today.
   The government-owned Bangladesh Times newspaper said the Teesta
River, which rose after three days of monsoon rains, swept away at
least 1,000 houses in the northern Rangpur and Lalmonirhat districts.
   Officials at the town of Tangail, 45 miles north of Dhaka, said
the Jamuna River washed away another 800 houses in the Tangail
district. The officials, who were contacted by telephone, spoke on
condition of anonymity.
   They said an estimated 10,000 people were homeless.
   Officials at the Flood Forecasting Center in Dhaka, also speaking
on condition of anonymity, said at least 600 people were left
homeless Saturday when the Gumti River broke through an embankment
in eastern Comilla district.
   Bangladesh, a low-lying country, is criss-crossed by hundreds of
rivers that form the deltas of the Brahmaputra and the Ganges, the
two major rivers of the Indian subcontinent.
   Floods are an annual calamity after the summer monsoons. Last
year, floods innundated about four-fifths of the country and at
least 1,400 people were killed. At least 2.3 million were left
homeless.

   A chemical fire erupted at a factory early
today, forcing at least 70 people from their homes and injuring 14
firefighters, authorities said.
   The fire at Carbolabs Inc., also known as JayChem Industries,
broke out about 3:45 a.m. and was brought under control by about
6:30 a.m. but flared an hour later, State Police said. Smoke
continued to waft into the air at midmorning.
   Fourteen firefighters were taken to Yale-New Haven Hospital
complaining of chest pains and breathing difficulty, said Michael
Driscoll of the Seymour Ambulance Association. The hospital said
they did not appear to be seriously injured.
   An additional 34 firefighters were taken to the hospital as a
precaution, Driscoll said.
   The cause of the fire was under investigation.
   Henry Renfrew, a hazardous materials specialist with the state
Fire Marshal's office, described Carbolabs as a pharmaceutical-type
lab where dozens of chemicals were kept, most in containers of a
gallon or less.
   Two chemicals used by the company were phosgene and isocyanate,
which can cause upper respiratory problems and can be absorbed
through the skin, authorities said.
   Authorities evacuated homes a half-mile downwind from the plant,
located about 10 miles north of New Haven.

   An American university similar to those in Beirut
and Cairo could open in the Soviet Union as early as next year,
organizers of the first U.S.-run summer school lecture course in
Moscow said today.
   Sen. Robert Kasten said the lecture seminar by politicians,
journalists, economists and artists is the first step toward
establishing such a U.S. institution in Moscow.
   ``We see this as the beginning of an American university in
Moscow,'' the Wisconsin Republican said before addressing a group of
100 Soviet intellectuals at the seminar, sponsored by the Soviet
Academy of Sciences, the Washington-based Independent University and
the American Foreign Policy Council.
   Other lecturers at the seminar included Sen. Phillip Gramm,
R-Texas, Norman Podhoretz, editor of Commentary magazine, and Frank
Shakespeare, the U.S. ambassador to the Vatican.
   Kasten said the possibility of establishing a Moscow-based
university where Soviets and foreigners could study is a result of
President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's policies of political restructuring
and openness.
   All Soviet instititions of higher learning now are run by the
government.
   Kasten said he hoped the proposed new university would be similar
to the American universities in the capitals of Lebanon and Egypt.
Those universities are four-year institutions offering college
degrees.
   Edward Lozansky, a Soviet emigre and director of the Independent
University, said: ``If everything goes right, we could begin
offering regular courses by 1990.'' Lozansky and other officials
were not specific on what approval was needed to open a full-time
school.
   The summer-school program, which began on Sunday and ends Friday,
includes lectures, discussions and panels in which Americans and
Soviets compare their political and economic systems.
   Gramm spoke about capitalism, freedom and opportunity in America
and Kasten discussed the separation of powers laid down by the U.S.
Constitution. ``My lecture is sort of like teaching Civics 101 to
the Soviets,'' he said.
   Lozansky said that if everything goes according to plan, the
Soviet government will provide quarters for the university and
funding will come from independent groups in the United States.
   The university in Beirut has been closed since the latest
outbreak in Lebanon's 14-year-old civil war began in March.

   Republican National Chairman Lee Atwater
told the nation's mayors today his party is ``not opposed to
spending more money on the cities'' and will actively recruit blacks
as mayoral candidates.
   Atwater said Republicans hope to establish ``a political
beachhead'' in the cities by winning the New York mayoral race this
year.
   Atwater, at the annual meeting of the U.S. Conference of Mayors,
steered clear of the Bush administration's differences with
Republican and Democratic mayors on guns and taxes but said the
president would be responsive to cities.
   ``George Bush ... does have the cities in mind,'' Atwater said.
``We in the Republican Party are not opposed to spending more money
on the cities _ we just want to be careful to spend taxpayers' money
on projects that work.''
   More than 200 mayors heard Atwater at the conference, which Bush
declined to attend. Atwater offered no specifics on urban aid, which
the mayors want increased.
   Later, speaking to reporters, he dismissed disagreements the
administration has with the mayors on resolutions nearing final
approval by the group. Republican and Democratic mayors have backed
policy statements calling for an increase in federal taxes and an
outright ban on semi-automatic weapons.
   ``There's going to be all kinds of things the mayors and the
president disagree on,'' Atwater said. ``The fact is there's a very
good spirit down here toward the president.''
   Speaking to the largely Democratic group of mayors, Atwater
pointed to his support for efforts to recruit black voters to the
GOP. He said it would seek black candidates for mayoral races too
and support them financially.
   Atwater singled out for introduction one black Republican mayor,
James A. Garner of Hempstead, N.Y. _ but mistakenly first said
Garner was from Schenectady, N.Y.
   A resolution calling for legislation far beyond President Bush's
more limited steps against semiautomatics won unanimous approval
Sunday from a resolutions committee of the U.S. Conference of Mayors.
   It appeared headed for approval from the full group of more than
200 mayors before their conference concludes Wednesday.
   ``It helps the Congress to have the backing they need to go
forward, and to realize there are more people out there in the
cities than are in the NRA,'' said Mayor Barbara Fass of Stockton,
Calif., who sponsored the call for a ban on possession of the
weapons.
   Her reference was to the National Rifle Association, which has
been the leading opponent of gun control measures across the
country, including actions to stem the spread of the assault-type
weapons. Those guns are often converted to fully automatic weapons
and are increasingly used by drug dealers in the nation's cities,
where drug-related crime has soared.
   Fass's city of Stockton was the site of a recent bloody attack in
which a deranged man fired an AK-47 assault weapon on young children
in a school yard, killing five and injuring 31. The attack
galvanized opinion against the weapons and prompted California's
legislature to pass tough limits on semiautomatics.
   Bush has banned imports of assault weapons. The mayors'
resolution would ban domestic manufacture as well as possession.
   The mayors considered dozens of resolutions on a wide range of
topics, and were poised to give final approval to a strong new
policy statement advocating higher federal taxes.
   This afternoon, they were to hear from Jack Kemp, secretary of
the scandal-plagued Department of Housing and Urban Development.
   Republican mayors were firmly in support of the call for a tax
increase despite Bush's ``Read my lips'' promise to oppose tax
increases.
   The GOP mayors' proposal, adopted in committee without dissent,
calls on Congress and the administration ``to raise revenues in a
fair, equitable and progressive way.'' It says the money raised
should go to reduce the federal budget deficit and to finance new
urban aid.
   ``A realistic evaluation of the deficit problem confirms that no
effective deficit reduction approach can be implemented without a
significant infusion of revenues into the federal treasury,'' the
statement says.
   Oddly, it was some of the more liberal Democratic mayors who
opposed on tactical grounds the call for higher taxes, arguing that
the statement might not be well received in Congress, while
Republicans advocated it in the committees.
   ``It makes no sense from a political standpoint to go in there
and say, `we need to raise taxes,''' Mayor John O. Norquist of
Milwaukee told his colleagues in earlier committee meetings.
   But Kansas City, Mo., Mayor Richard Berkley, a Republican and
past president of the mayors conference, responded by noting that
the mayors were asking for money for urban programs and added, ``The
first thing anybody is going to ask you is how are you going to pay
for it.''
   Among the other resolutions was one deploring recent Supreme
Court decisions that civil rights advocates say have weakened
affirmative programs aimed at ending discrimination in employment.
It asks Congress for legislation protecting affirmative action
programs.
   ``The problem with these decisions is it's just opening the
floodgates for negative lawsuits trying to undo just literally
hundreds and thousands of plans all around the country that have
basically been working pretty well,'' said Mayor Bill Hudnut of
Indianapolis, a Republican and head of the mayors' civil rights
subcommittee.
   The ban on assault weapons was part of a broad resolution calling
for tougher drug penalties and asking the president to use debt
reduction as an incentive for drug-producing countries to stem the
flow of drugs. It also asks that closed and under-used military
bases be converted to prisons and drug treatment centers.

<HEAD>Court Says Federal Courts May Referee Some Power Rate Disputes</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES H. RUBIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court ruled unanimously today that
federal courts have authority to referee some disputes over electric
power rates between public utilities and local or state regulatory
agencies.
   The justices ordered a federal court to review a claim by New
Orleans Public Service Inc. (NOPSI), a utility seeking to pass on
$135 million in costs to its customers.
   Justice Antonin Scalia, in his opinion for the high court,
compared the utility's claim to a challenge to an allegedly
unconstitutional state law or local zoning ordinance.
   ``We would assuredly not require (such suits) to be brought in
state courts,'' he said. Moreover, he said, ``There is no doctrine
that the availability or even the pendency of state judicial
proceedings excludes the federal courts'' from ruling in such cases.
   The justices, in a related ruling last year, severely limited the
authority of states to lower electric rates public utilities charge
as a result of agreements with federal regulators.
   But that decision left unanswered whether federal judges should
rule in such disputes or should leave these matters to state courts.
The court said today that federal judges should not abstain.
   Today's case involves a nearly decade-old dispute between NOPSI
and the New Orleans City Council, which under Louisiana law sets
utility rates charged consumers in New Orleans.
   The council barred the utility from charging customers for the
costs the utility incurred by buying electric power generated by the
$3.6 billion Grand Gulf 1 nuclear power plant in Port Gibson, Miss.
   The rates charged the New Orleans utility to purchase power from
Grand Gulf were set by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission.
   Therefore, the utility argued, city and state officials are
powerless to prevent it from passing on the costs to its customers.
   The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission in 1985 ordered the New
Orleans utility to pay 17 percent of the cost of constructing Grand
Gulf 1.
   NOPSI, in a partial settlement with the city council in 1986,
agreed to absorb $51.2 million of the costs of Grand Gulf.
   The utility said the city had assured it would be allowed to
recover the remaining $135 million share of its costss through
higher retail rates over a period of time.
   But the council said the utility acted imprudently in failing to
resell the power it agreed to purchase from Grand Gulf and the
council blocked a pass-through to the customers.
   The utility sued in federal court for permission to pass on the
$135 million to its customers, arguing that the federal commission's
role in the matter preempted the city council's power.
   A federal judge denied the utility's claims and the 5th U.S.
Circuit Court of Appeals upheld the judge's ruling.
   The case is New Orleans Public Service vs. New Orleans City
Council, 88-348.

   A high school sophomore dissatisfied with
his education in this rural community vented his gripe in a student
newspaper ad that read: ``I'd dun learned a heks of alOot ast
lecanto.''
   Jimmy Porter placed a 17-line advertisement, complete with
misspellings and improper grammar, in the year-end issue of Lecanto
High School's Panther Prowl.
   ``The best education you get if you play a sport ... 4 out of 5
doctors said they would rather be stranded on a desert than go to
Lecanto High School ... Maybe someone will realize that this is not
the real world,'' wrote Jimmy, who was newspaper's advertising
manager.
   Principal Mike Fox, whose 950-student high school ranks in the
top 10 percent in Florida, was not happy.
   ``It was not received with great kindness,'' he said, adding:
``You have to remember this is a 15-year-old kid. It's kind of an
immature thing to do.''
   He and other administrators defended the school.
   Its 220 graduates this year won $250,000 in scholarships and
students generally scored higher than the national average on
achievement tests, said Neal Weiss, executive director of
administrative services.
   Fox said he doesn't expect everyone to like the school, but added
Jimmy could have found another way to resolve his problem.
   ``The staff and the kids felt it was real inappropriate,'' he
said before refusing to discuss the matter further.
   With school ending earlier this month, the ad was a parting shot
for Jimmy. He is moving with his family to Sante Fe, N.M., from this
crossroads community of 2,500 people and one stop light about 120
miles north of Tampa.
   ``Ha Ha I'm going to a real school, and you all have to stay
hear,'' read the bottom line of the ad. He then signed his name.
   ``Jimmy just had an ax to grind and off he goes,'' said his
mother, Nancy. ``We told him: `This isn't what you do. You don't
bring about change this way. This is dumb.'''
   ``We don't condone it,'' said Mrs. Porter, a volunteer in the
Citrus County Parent-Teacher Association who headed the PTA Council
for more than six years and served on school advisory and study
committees.
   Jimmy's father, Earl, served on a state committee concerned with
school-business partnerships.
   Porter also formed a privately supported group that provides
scholarships and sponsors science and math projects.
   Jimmy was not available for comment because he was on vacation
out of state, Mrs. Porter said.
   ``It beats me how it all happened. It beats me how the kid
survived it,'' she said. ``We're planning to move. He knew he was
getting out. After it ran I said, `Maybe we ought to leave tonight.'
Then Jimmy beats a retreat to his summer hideaway.''
   Mrs. Porter said nothing in particular provoked Jimmy, whom she
described as a fair student, passing with B's and C's.
   ``Jimmy's biggest problem is he's not yet got his act together to
determine grades are important. He's bright and we keep enough
pressure on him. ...
   ``When the heat's on he'll produce.''
   Jimmy went to journalism camp last summer ``and loved this
newspaper stuff,'' said his mother, adding that she didn't know
whether that experience prompted his deed.
   ``He was gutsy, I'll give him that. He signed his name to it,''
Mrs. Porter said.
   She said she can understand her son's frustration after her
active participation in the system.
   ``I get frustrated. Kids aren't challenged enough,'' Mrs. Porter
said. ``If you expect high things of them they'll rise to the
occasion. Sometimes I don't think they try enough. The kids pick up
on this stuff.''

<HEAD>Missouri Murderer's Life Sentence Reinstated</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICHARD CARELLI</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court today reinstated the life
sentence of a convicted Missouri murderer, ruling that a lower court
wrongly decided he should go free.
   By a 5-4 vote, the court said the Constitution's double-jeopardy
protections for criminal defendants did not require that Larry P.
Thomas' life sentence be thrown out.
   ``Neither the double-jeopardy clause nor any other constitutional
provision exists to provide unjustified windfalls,'' Justice Anthony
M. Kennedy wrote for the court.
   Thomas was convicted of murder and attempted robbery in the
botched holdup of an automobile parts store in St. Louis on Nov. 8,
1972.
   Mentoe Vernell, a customer, was killed in a shootout.
   Thomas was sentenced to 15 years in prison for attempted robbery
and to life for murder.
   Former Gov. Christopher Bond commuted the robbery sentence in
1981 after Thomas had served about eight years. He remained in
prison on the murder conviction.
   A state court subsequently threw out the sentence for attempted
robbery and credited the time Thomas had served for that crime to
the murder sentence.
   But the 8th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled last year that
the multiple sentences for the same crime violated Thomas'
double-jeopardy protections. Since the governor's commutation meant
that Thomas legally had served one of his sentences, the other
sentence had to be thrown out and Thomas set free, the appeals court
said.
   But the nation's highest court disagreed today.
   The Missouri court's alteration of (Thomas') sentence to a single
term for felony murder with credit for time served provided suitable
protection for his double-jeopardy rights,'' Kennedy wrote.
   He was joined by Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist and Justices
Byron R. White, Harry A. Blackmun and Sandra Day O'Connor.
   Justices Antonin Scalia, William J. Brennan, Thurgood Marshall
and John Paul Stevens dissented.
   Writing for the four, Scalia said the court wrongly was making an
exception from its previous double-jeopardy rulings to avoid what it
perceives as an unjust result.
   ``A technical rule with equitable exceptions is no rule at all,''
Scalia said. ``Three strikes out. The state broke the rules here,
and must abide by the result.''
   The case is Jones vs. Thomas, 88-420.

<HEAD>Court Gives Railroads Broader Power to Test Workers for Drugs</HEAD>

   The Supreme Court today gave railroads broader
power to test their workers for drugs, upholding routine tests for
Conrail employees.
   By a 7-2 vote, the justices said Conrail _ the Consolidated Rail
Corporation _ may require the tests without permitting collective
bargaining over the issue.
   The decision marks the first time the court has ruled on drug
testing by private employers. But the ruling is based on an
interpretation of the federal Railway Labor Act and may not have
sweeping impact for other workers.
   Last March in its first rulings on testing for drug and alcohol
abuse in the American workplace, the court said workers in sensitive
government jobs or entrusted with public safety may be forced to
undergo the tests.
   In the Conrail case, the railroad announced in February 1987 that
it unilaterally would check for drugs as part of a urinalysis
administered periodically to workers and also when they returned to
work after an absence.
   The railway said the need for the tests was magnified by an
accident at Chase, Md., on Jan. 4, 1987, in which an Amtrak
passenger train collided with Conrail locomotives, killing 16 and
injuring 174. The Conrail engineer and brakeman subsequently were
found to have been using marijuana.
   Conrail had conducted urine tests since 1976 as part of periodic
physical examinations administered to workers at intervals varying
between one and three years depending on the employee's age and job
classification.
   But those tests were aimed at discovering whether a worker, for
example, had diabetes and not whether the employee was using drugs.
   Railway labor unions said adding the drug-screening component to
the urinalysis is a ``major'' labor-management dispute as defined by
the federal Railway Labor Act and therefore must be submitted to
collective bargainng.
   Justice Harry A. Blackmun, writing today for the court, said the
dispute is a minor one because it is not based on ``frivolous or
obviously insubstantial'' claims by the employer.
   ``Conrail has argued that it needs, for medical purposes, to
require employees who deny that they are drug-dependent to
demonstrate that they are capable of producing a drug-free (urine)
sample at will,'' Blackmun said. That need ``is not frivolous.''
   Also, Blackmun said, ``Conrail's well-established recognition of
the relevance of drug use to medical fitness substantially weakens
the union's claim that Conrail now, for the first time, is engaging
in medical testing that reveals facts about employees' private
off-duty conduct.''
   The ruling overturned a decision by the 3rd U.S. Circuit Court of
Appeals, which said Conrail may not conduct the tests without
evidence that particular workers may be using drugs.
   The railroad said drug and alcohol abuse is a major problem in
the transportation industry. It said there are studies estimating
that 25 percent of railroad workers drink on duty and showing that
alcohol and other drugs were responsible for 37 deaths, 80 injuries
and $34 million in property damage between 1975 and 1985.
   Justice William J. Brennan, in a dissenting opinion today, said
the workers have the right to go to the bargaining table before
their employer adopts testing that could result in their firing.
   The railroad unions have not agreed to ``the systematic,
suspicionless testing, on such terms and in such manner as the
employer alone prescribed, of all employees for evidence of criminal
activity that ... could result in discharge,'' Brennan said. He was
joined in dissent by Justice Thurgood Marshall.
   In other action, the court:
   _ Turned down an appeal by a California woman facing criminal
charges in her daughter's death because she tried to heal the child
through prayer rather than seeking medical help.
   The justices, without comment, refused to block the woman's trial
in Sacramento on charges of child-endangerment and involuntary
manslaughter.
   _ Struck down a Connecticut law aimed at assuring that beer sold
in the state costs no more than it does in three neighboring states.
   By a 6-3 vote, the court said such laws unconstitutionally
interfere with interstate commerce.
   _ Ruled unanimously that federal courts have authority to referee
some disputes over electric power rates between public utilities and
local or state regulatory agencies.
   The justices ordered a federal court to review a claim by New
Orleans Public Service Inc. (NOPSI), a utility seeking to pass on
$135 million in costs to its dustomers.
   _ Turned down an appeal by Margaret Randall, a professor and
writer threatened with deportation from the United States for
supporting communism.
   The court, without comment, left intact a ruling that it is
premature to consider the constitutional and legal issues she raised.
   _ Barred asbestos manufacturers from suing the government to
recover money they paid to a Navy shipyard worker injured by
inhaling the product.
   The court, without comment, rejected an appeal by two
manufacturers in a case from Washington state.
   _ Refused to reinstate former Maryland Gov. Marvin Mandel's 1977
mail-fraud conviction, thrown out five years after he completed a
prison term.
   The court, without comment, rejected a Bush administration appeal
aimed at using Mandel's case to set guidelines on when someone may
challenge a fraud conviction for which the sentence already was
served.
   The drug-testing case is Conrail vs. Railway Labor Executives,
88-1.

   The Supreme Court today set aside the death
sentence of convicted Indiana murderer Michael Daniels, killer of an
Army chaplain who lived in Indianapolis.
   The justices told the Indiana Supreme Court to restudy Daniels'
case in light of their June 12 decision in a South Carolina case
that juries in capital cases may not be told about a victim's
personal characteristics.
   Daniels' appeal did not challenge his conviction in the Jan. 16,
1978 slaying of Allan Streett.
   Prosecutors said Daniels was one of several men who staged a
series of armed robberies at Indianapolis homes that day. Streett
was shoveling snow with his son from the family home's driveway when
he was shot down.
   The case is Daniels vs. Indiana, 88-6729.

<HEAD>Some Schools Ban Peace Symbol as Satanic Sign</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PASADENA, Texas (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Schools have banned the peace symbol made
famous by anti-war protesters and flower children, saying the sign
is used by devil worshipers.
   ``It's harder for those of us who lived in the '60s to be told
that the peace symbol means something completely different,'' said
Kirk Lewis, spokesman for the Pasadena Independent School District
in this Houston suburb.
   ``But experts are telling us that, and it became inappropriate
for children to wear them.''
   The peace symbol is prohibited in at least six Pasadena schools,
and a districtwide ban may be established in the fall, he said.
   A few miles away, Baytown schools also ban the symbol.
   Pasadena officials said the recent drug- and cult-related
slayings of 15 people in Matamoros, Mexico, reinforced their doubts
about the symbol.
   ``The dramatic conclusion of that tragedy made us sit up and take
notice, but the awareness was already there,'' Lewis said. ``We'd
pick up little signs, like students doodling things on desk tops
while not listening in class or rumors of some students involved in
cult practices.''
   Student Andrew Yuhr, 12, said his T-shirt with the symbol ``just
meant peace.''
   ``If they ban peace symbols, they'll have to ban basic geometry
because of all its lines and circles,'' he said.
   The peace symbol _ a circle with an inverted ``Y'' with an
extended bar _ is believed to date from the late 1950s, created by
nuclear disarmament advocates from the semaphore codes for ``N'' and
``D.''
   Lyle J. Rapecki, an occult expert in Flagstaff, Ariz., and author
of a book on satanic symbols, said that to some groups, the peace
symbol represents Nero's Cross, which he described as an upside-down
cross with broken arms.
   Debora Johnson said she was shocked when her 11-year-old told her
about the peace-symbol ban at school.
   ``A lot of my hippie friends wore peace symbols. When my son told
me some people are saying it has an evil meaning, I said, `That's
not what that means.' I was shocked,'' she said. ``From peace symbol
to devil sign _ there's a big gap there.''

   About 3,000 miners protesting the
planned closure of Belgium's last two pits by 1993 clashed with
police Monday while trying to march to parliament and the royal
palace, and 48 people were injured.
   A security force of 2,500 used tear gas, water cannon and mounted
police to keep the miners away from the legislature, palace and
diplomatic missions in central Brussels.
   Thirty policemen were injured _ two seriously _ when they were
pelted with stones and hit by sticks and steel bars, a police
official said. At least 18 miners were hurt.
   The miners were allowed to march through Brussels' business
district, but changed course near parliament. They fought through a
barricade of 400 policemen but were later dispersed, the official
said.
   Last week, 28 police were injured in fighting in northeastern
Hasselt, near the pits.
   Authorities decided to close the pits and center on reconversion
industries in the mining region of northeastern Limburg. In 1986,
the management of the KS mines shut down four mines and cut the work
force from 18,300 to 6,800. KS lost $310 million that year.

   The West German electronics company
Siemens will deliver 300,000 personal computers to the Soviet Union
in a deal worth about $750 million, a company spokesman said Monday.
   The contract was signed in Moscow on Friday, one day after Soviet
President Mikhail S. Gorbachev concluded a four-day visit to West
Germany, said Siemens spokesman Eberhard Posner.
   Siemens signed the contract with the Soviet Ministry of Higher

   The computers will be delivered in the next three years, Posner
said.
   The West German company also will train Soviets and transfer
enough of the technology and know-how for the Soviets to start
manufacturing some computer components, he said.
   The Munich newspaper Sueddeutsche Zeitung said the Soviets were
financing the purchase through sales of chemicals to the British
Afro-Arab trading group.
   The computers will be used in Soviet research institutes and will
serve as a basis for the Soviets to develop their own software and
large computers, the newspaper said.

   Unidentified gunmen looted a Roman Catholic
seminary in war-torn southern Sudan a month ago and seized a priest
and 23 seminarians, a priest said Monday.
   The priest, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the Rev.
Mathews Samusa, a Sudanese, and the seminarians were seized May 20
in a raid on the Rimenze Catholic Seminary near Yambio, 350 miles
west of the southern Sudan provincial capital of Juba.
   Samusa and the seminarians, between the ages of 15 and 18, were
last seen being marched north, and were in poor condition, the
priest said.
   The Nairobi-based priest said the raiders refused to identify
themselves, and when asked what they intended to do with the
seminarians, replied they would ``teach them something useful.''
   He said he doubted the gunmen were rebels of the Sudan People's
Liberation Army.
   The rebels took up arms in 1983 against the Moslem-dominated
Khartoum government to press for autonomy and economic development
for the predominantly Christian and animist south.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court, in a victory for civil
rights lawyers and their clients, today upheld the award of more
than $4 million in legal fees to lawyers who won a Kansas City, Mo.,
school desegregation suit.
   The justices, voting 8-0, ruled that paralegals, law clerks and
recent law school graduates are entitled to compensation at the
market rate for their work.
   By a separate 5-3 vote, the court said states that lose such
cases may be forced to pay extra money to civil rights attorneys as
compensation for a delay in payment.
   State and city officials were held responsible for segregation in
the Kansas City school system and were ordered in 1985 to spend
$87.7 million to improve and integrate the schools.
   A federal judge then ordered the state to pay more than $1.7
million to Arthur A. Benson II of Kansas City, the lead attorney for
students who sued, and $2.3 million to the NAACP Legal Defense Fund
for its work.
   The 8th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals upheld the attorneys' fees
last year under a federal civil rights law that awards them to
lawyers who win such cases.
   Missouri officials argued the legal fees were inflated illegally
to compensate Benson and the others for waiting years to be paid.
   Justice William J. Brennan, in his opinion today, said the
additional compensation is not barred by a constitutional provision
that protects states against some lawsuits.
   He was joined in that part of his opinion by Justices Byron R.
White, Harry A. Blackmun, John Paul Stevens and Anthony M. Kennedy.
   Dissenting on that issue were Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist
and Justices Sandra Day O'Connor and Antonin Scalia.
   Justice Thurgood Marshall did not take part in the ruling.
   The case is Missouri vs. Jenkins, 88-64.

<TEXT>
   Thousands of Catholics gathered in the western
Ukraine to press for legalization of their banned church, an
activist said Monday.
   Anatoly Dotsenko, a spokesman in Moscow for the Ukrainian group
monitoring compliance with the Helsinki agreements, said prayer
services and marches were held Sunday after an appeal by
Ivan-Miroslav Lyubachivsky, the church leader who resides in the
Vatican.
   Witnesses reported between 70,000 and 100,000 people gathered in
Ivano-Frankovsk in the western Ukraine for a prayer service for
Ukrainian nationalists, he said. Many of them then marched past
government, Communist Party, and KGB secret police headquarters in
the city, he said.
   Police tried to interfere with the service, but there was no
violence and no arrests, he said.
   There was no independent verification of the crowd size.
   Bishop Pavlo Vasilik and some priests were kept under house
arrest during the service and could not participate, he said.
   Dotsenko said several people taking part in a similar service in
Kiev were roughed up by police and that one priest was detained for
several hours.
   The western Ukraine was incorporated by Josef Stalin into the
Soviet Union after World War II. It has been an area of dispute
between the Russian Orthodox Church and the Roman Catholic Church
for centuries, and when it came under Soviet rule the Catholic
Church was banned.
   Despite the generally improving climate in the Soviet Union for
organized religion, the Ukrainian Catholic Church has not been
legalized.

   Most Americans favor greater spending on
education and power for parents to choose public schools, and a
sizable minority backs a move to year-round classes, a national poll
has found.
   School competition, through programs allowing parents to choose
which schools their children attend, is a cornerstone of President
Bush's education policy. Bush has questioned the need for more
spending.
   The Media General-Associated Press poll, conducted as the
traditional school year approached its close, found concern about
education on a variety of fronts and enthusiasm for several
educational initiatives.
   After a decade in which the back-to-basics movement swept the
schools, respondents feared that pupils are absorbing facts without
learning to think. Most doubted the validity of standardized tests
as a gauge of true learning.
   Despite the concerns, 53 percent of the 1,084 adults polled rated
their community's public schools as good or excellent overall. Those
with children in the schools rated them even more highly, with 61
percent favorable.
   Among the findings:
   _ Two-thirds favored more spending on public schools, and nine in
10 of that group said they would accept higher taxes to pay for it.
Even adults without children in school backed greater spending by
nearly 2-to-1.
   _ Fifty-eight percent said parents should be able to choose which
public schools their children attend. Proponents say that creates
competition that forces schools to improve; critics say it drains
resources from the schools that need the most improvement.
   _ More than four in 10 favored year-round classes, with vacations
scattered through the year rather than concentrated in a long summer
break. Critics question the expense of keeping schools open and
paying teachers year-round, while supporters say the continuity
enhances learning.
   _ Fifty-two percent said their local schools do an adequate job
teaching children basic facts and skills. But only 39 percent
expressed satisfaction with the way the schools teach pupils how to
think and reason.
   _ Fifty-four percent said they believe standardized tests do not
reflect how well pupils are learning in school. Such tests have been
used to monitor learning for decades; critics argue that they
encourage rote learning.
   _ Parents with children in public schools consistently rated the
schools more highly than did other respondents. Big-city dwellers
were more likely than others to rate their schools poorly.
   The poll found sentiment for a shift in school financing schemes:
Among those who favored more spending, only one-sixth wanted it to
come primarily from local governments, which usually fund schools
with property taxes. Three in 10 wanted more federal money and four
in 10 favored greater state support; the rest had no preference.
   Support for higher spending declined sharply with age. Nearly
eight in 10 of the youngest respondents, age 18-29, supported more
spending; that fell to 48 percent of the oldest, those over 64.
   Similarly, more than three-quarters the youngest group said
raising teachers' salaries would attract better-qualified people to
the profession. Less than half of the oldest group agreed.
   Such differences extended to other issues: Older respondents were
less likely to rate school performance favorably and were less
willing to reject standardized tests.
   Younger respondents stood out in their opposition to year-round
classes; two-thirds were opposed, while opinion was more evenly
divided among those age 30 and up. Overall, among those with an
opinion on year-round school, 49 percent were opposed and 44 percent
were in favor, a split decision given the poll's three-point margin
of error.
   Finally, about half the respondents thought Bush, who wants to be
known as ``the education president,'' will be able to improve public
education. Among those willing to prognosticate, 46 percent expected
that he will succeed and 37 percent said he will not.
   The poll was conducted May 5-13.

   A group led by Los Angeles investor Alfred
Checchi would buy Northwest Airlines for $4.05 billion under a deal
announced today.
   The $121-a-share bid by Checchi's Wings Holding Inc. defeated at
least three other suitors: Pan Am Corp.; the Machinists union, which
represents 20,000 Northwest workers, and Los Angeles oil billionaire
Marvin Davis.
   The deal is subject to regulatory approval.
   The announcement caps a bidding war for NWA Inc., the nation's
fourth-largest airline, that began March 28 when Davis offered $2.7
billion, or $90 a share.
   On Wall Street, NWA Inc. rose $7 a share to $114.62{ this morning
on the New York Stock Exchange.
   Checchi's group, which already owns 4.9 percent of NWA stock,
will pay $3.7 billion for 30.5 million outstanding shares. The
package includes additional equity that would boost the total price
to $4.05 billion.
   The investor group said it is obtaining financing from commercial
banks led by Bankers Trust Co.
   Federal regulators are expected to scrutinize the proposal,
applying a financial fitness test. The fear is that too much
takeover debt could limit a new owner's ability to maintain
equipment.
   Takeover debt also is a concern among Northwest pilots, who fear
that a highly leveraged acquisition would prompt the sale of routes
or other major assets.
   NWA Chairman Steven Rothmeier has described Checchi's group as
``very friendly.''
   ``Our financing plan has been designed to accommodate a program
of substantial growth, including all of the new aircraft purchases
contemplated by NWA's management,'' said Checchi, a former Marriott
Corp. executive.
   Investors in Wings Holdings also include KLM Royal Dutch Airlines.

<HEAD>Three Arrested for Fatal Railroad Station Blast</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Police have arrested three Sikh militants
and charged them with planting a bomb that killed 10 people at New
Delhi's main railroad station last week, a news agency reported
Monday.
   The three extremists were arrested June 17 in Amritsar in Punjab
state, the birthplace of Sikh separatist movement for an independent
homeland, according to the Press Trust of India, which did not
identify its sources. The blast occurred June 12.
   The three were identified as Nishan Singh, Gurdeep Singh and
Baldev Singh, and they belonged to the Bhindranwale Tiger Force of
Khalistan, a known militant group.
   The news agency quoted sources as saying that Nishan Singh put
the time bomb, hidden in a plastic bucket, near the ticket counter
at the entrance of New Delhi's main railroad station.
   The other two had helped make the device that blew up in a crowd
of 600 people, most of whom were vacationers waiting to board trains
or lined up to buy tickets, the news agency said.
   The blast, which also injured 50 people, was the first attack by
Sikh extremists in nearly a year.
   The militants told interrogators that they had planned to place
the bomb outside a Hindu temple in the busy market place at Chandni
Chowk in north Delhi, according to the news agency.
   But, ``deterred by the presence of a large number of people in
the crowded Chandni Chowk, they kept the bomb at the station and
left for Amritsar ... by train,'' the news agency said.
   Some New Delhi residents also were involved in the plot and
police were trying to identify them, the news agency reported.
   Police had earlier said that another militant group, the Babbar
Khalsa, was responsible for the blast that came a week after
militants observed the fifth anniversary of an army raid on the Sikh
Golden Temple in Amritsar.
   The raid, aimed at flushing out armed militants entrenched in the
shrine, left 1,200 people dead, including Jarnail Singh
Bhindranwale, founder of the Sikh separatist campaign.
   Sikh militants have been fighting since 1982 for a homeland in
Punjab, claiming they are discriminated against socially and
culturally by the country's Hindu majority.
   Sikh separatists have been blamed for at least 850 killings in
Punjab this year.

   President Bush has full confidence that
Secretary Jack Kemp will clean up alleged widespread mismanagement
and influence-peddling at the Department of Housing and Urban
Development, a White House spokesman said today.
   Deputy press secretary Roman Popadiuk said Bush had talked with
Kemp on Saturday about allegations of multimillion-dollar fraud at
HUD during the Reagan administration.
   ``He's confident the secretary can turn around the management
situation there,'' Popadiuk told reporters. ``The secretary is
tackling the situation.''
   For his part, Kemp vowed in a television interview Sunday to root
out politics and influence-peddling at the agency he has headed
since earlier this year.
   Denying that the burgeoning HUD scandal was symptomatic of a
``laissez-faire'' attitude during the Reagan years, Kemp said that
anytime the government subsidizes major industries, problems are
bound to occur.
   But he said that under his leadership, HUD had reinstituted
competitive bidding procedures ``and removed the bias, the
prejudice, the politics'' from its grant programs.
   Popadiuk said, ``Secretary Kemp said he is determined to clean up
the department in every way and would not tolerate any abuse of the
public trust ... The president is confident the secretary is going
to turn the management around and get control of the situation at
HUD.''
   ``I'm told the president wants to get to the bottom of this,'' he
added.
   Asked when Bush expected Kemp to complete his job of restoring
good management practices, Popadiuk said: ``I'm not going to put a
timetable on that. But as soon as possible, the better.''
   Kemp, appearing on the CBS-TV show, ``Face the Nation,'' was
asked whether then-President Reagan's pledge to get the government
off the people's backs could be blamed for the subsequent scandals
that hit the savings and loan and defense industries, and now HUD.
   ``I don't think laissez-faire is quite the right word for it,''
Kemp said. ``The system was flawed to the extent that when you get
in the business of having the government subsidize big developers or
big defense contractors, or any person, without a competitive
process based upon merit and need and quality, then you're going to
get into the problems that we have rooted out and are trying to root
out at HUD. ...
   ``But I can assure you that the political influence of contracts
going to people with political friends has been going on for quite
some time,'' he added. ``I'm not trying to shift the blame to
Democrats or Republicans, but I want to public to know that this
secretary, under this president, is going to remove the politics and
the influence-peddling from the agency over which I have been asked
to exert leadership.''
   On an appearance Saturday on CNN's ``Evans and Novak'' show, Kemp
said: ``I think it is very clear there have been some who have been
criminal.''
   That contradicted earlier statements by HUD's inspector general,
Paul Adams, that his staff had not found evidence of criminality
during its audit of HUD accounting procedures and contract awards
programs during the tenure of former HUD Secretary Samuel Pierce.
   Kemp acknowledged that his former presidential campaign manager,
Charles Black, later went to work to get HUD contracts for clients.
But he said there was no ``quid pro quo'' that Black, in return for
campaign work, would be able to cash in later with government
lobbying activities.
   Kemp has released an internal audit by Adams that said millions
of dollars in HUD subsidies were distributed for renovation of
low-incoming housing without regard to need or fairness, and that
much of the money was steered to private developers who formerly had
been HUD officials or had ties to prominent Republicans.
   Adams found developers had paid millions in consulting fees to
former HUD officials or prominent Republicans, including former
Interior Secretary James Watt, who received $400,000.
   Also under investigation are HUD's program of using outside
contractors known as closing agents to handle foreclosure sales of
government property. Agents are believed to have made off with
millions of dollars they were supposed to turn over to the
government.
   Attorney General Dick Thornburgh on Thursday ordered a federal
investigation of all HUD offices for fraud and embezzlement.
   Kemp said Sunday the attorney general ``is going to have to make
decisions as to criminality.'' Pierce's involvement, he said, ``will
be looked at politically, it will be looked through the inspector
general.''

<HEAD>President Calls For Drug-Free Schools</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: Subs pvs 3rd graf, A high, to CORRECT that 47 schools in 24

<BYLINE>By CHRISTOPHER CONNELL</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   President Bush, opening a week of White House
events focusing on youth, today called for a day when every school
in the nation will be ``safe and drug free.''
   At a Rose Garden ceremony, Bush honored schools for their efforts
to rid their corridors and classrooms of drugs.
   Forty-seven schools from 24 states and the District of Columbia
were honored in the annual Drug-Free Schools recognition program,
launched by drug policy coordinator William J. Bennett when he was
secretary of education in the Reagan administration.
   ``As I look around here today, I see some of the top commandos in
the war on drugs _ our teachers, community leaders, parents and
students,'' the president said.
   ``You're the ones winning this war, because you are the ones
looking to tomorrow, you're the ones who know it takes a clear mind
to get a good education and lead a productive life. You understand
that students have a right to learn in drug-free schols.''
   Bush said that, while most schools were now out for the summer,
``there's one last lesson for all Americans to learn.'' He called
for ``downright stubborness'' in the effort to see that `` every
school in this country can win, every school in this country can be
safe and drug free.''
   The president noted that the red tie and ribbon he was wearing
was intended to symbolize drug-free schools. He said it was inspired
by Harold Maready, the principal of Roosevelt Vocational School in
Lake Wales, Fla.
   ``He bet (his students) that that if at least half the school
wore red _ that is, were drug free _ he'd paint his bald head with
the words, `Just Say No.' Well, 225 out of 295 showed up in red _
and guess what happened.''
   ``I think Mr. Maready had a great idea, and I'm looking for
Marlin Fitzwater here somewhere,'' Bush joked, referring to his
balding press secretary.
   The president tonight was traveling to the Philadelphia suburb of
Wyncote, Pa., to deliver a commencement address at Cheltenham High
School. His topic was one that many speakers cover at similar
ceremonies: the future awaiting the graduates.
   Bush also was meeting today with visiting Guyana President
Desmond Hoyte.
   Then on Tuesday the 1989 President Scholars _ more than 100 of
the nation's top high school seniors in academics and the arts _
will have their hour in the White House limelight.
   Bush also will attend a fund-raiser for disadvantaged children
sponsored by Washington Redskins football coach Joe Gibbs.
   Then on Wednesday, Bush plans another White House ceremony to
announce the start of the Youth Entering Service, or YES program _ a
foundation-led effort to encourage more young people to perform
community service.
   Bush says he will ask Congress to pump $25 million a year for
four years into the YES to America Foundation to help provide
matching grants for service projects.
   Bush, father of five and grandfather of 11, spent most of
Father's Day at Camp David before returning Sunday afternoon with
Mrs. Bush and their eldest grandson, 13-year-old George P.
   They came back in time to host their first PBS ``In Performance
at the White House'' concert, featuring singer John Denver and
others, that will be aired on PBS stations at 9 p.m. July 5.
   The emphasis on youth comes less than a week after Bush
successfully vetoed the minimum wage bill, in part because of
Congress' refusal to enact a six-month subminimum ``training'' wage
for youth. Congress also wanted to raise the $3.35-an-hour minimum
by $1.20, some 30 cents more than Bush was willing to go.
   Also on Bush's agenda this week is a meeting Wednesday with West
German Foreign Minister Hans-Dietrich Genscher, whose dovish views
on short-range nuclear missiles nearly caused a rift in the NATO
alliance.
   At last month's NATO summit the allies unanimously endorsed
Bush's blueprint for deep cuts in conventional arms while holding
out the prospect of eventual talks to withdraw some _ but not all _
of the short-range missiles from Europe.
   U.S. and Soviet negotiators were meeting today in Geneva to
resume the Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty negotiations _ the
so-called START talks to curb the long-range, intercontinental
ballistic missiles that the United States and the Soviet Union can
hurl at each other from half a world away.
   Bush's busy schedule includes a trek Wednesday evening to
Richmond, Va., to address the Family Motor Coach Association and
attend a Republican fund-raising dinner for gubernatorial candidate
Marshall Coleman.
   He will fly to New York on Thursday to address the New York
Partnership, a business-community leaders' organization trying to
spur voluntary efforts to help the inner city poor, and attend a New
York State GOP dinner and the centennial banquet of the Wall Street
Journal.

<HEAD>Supreme Soviet Begins Hearings on Cabinet Appointees</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Soviet parliament began confirmation hearings
Monday for the Cabinet of Premier Nikolai I. Ryzhkov amid
indications that some of the appointees would face tough
questioning, Tass said.
   In contrast to the initial work of the Congress of People's
Deputies and the parliament, or Supreme Soviet, which captivated
audiences across the country for days, the hearings were not
televisied and were closed to foreign reporters.
   Among those going through the hearings were Foreign Minister
Eduard A. Shevardnadze, Defense Minister Dmitri T. Yazov and KGB
Chairman Vladimir Kryuchkov, Tass said.
   After the questioning of Ryzkhov by members of the parliament
about economic policies, ``each of his 13 deputies and more than 50
ministers are now to go through the same `parliamentary purgatory'
as well,'' the official news agency said.
   ``And all indications are that some of them will find the going
pretty tough,'' it said.
   It cited the case of Gennady Bogomyakov, Ryzhkov's candidate for
minister of the oil and gas industry, who was accused in the
government newspaper Izvestia last week of ignoring the environment
while he was Communist Party chief in the Tyumen region of Siberia.
The Tyumen area is Siberia's main oil and gas region.
   Hearings will continue for at least a week, Tass said. They are
to be followed by a 40-day session of the full 542-member Supreme
Soviet, which will confirm the appointees and begin drafting
legislation.
   Speaking to the Supreme Soviet on June 10, Ryzhkov said the
number of ministries would be slashed to streamline the government.
   The Congress of People's Deputies is a new 2,250 member
parliamentary body that elected Mikhail S. Gorbachev to a new, more
powerful presidency and chose the Supreme Soviet in its initial
session that lasted from May 25-June 9.
   Soviets eagerly watched the daily live telecasts in which
Congress deputies challenged Communist Party authority, questioned
Gorbachev and other top officials, and openly criticized such
previously untouchable organizations as the KGB.
   The Supreme Soviet replaces a 1,500-member parliament of the same
name that rarely challenged Kremlin authority.

   The Supreme Court today agreed to decide
whether union members who sue their union for allegedly denying fair
representation are entitled to a jury trial if they also seek
monetary compensation, such as back pay.
   Lawsuits accusing unions of breaching their duty of fair
representation generally are tried before judges without juries.
   But ruling in a case from North Carolina last year, the 4th U.S.
Circuit Court of Appeals said a jury trial can be demanded when
monetary compensation is part of the relief sought.
   Other appeals courts have ruled differently.
   The 4th Circuit court's ruling was a victory for 27 truck drivers
who sued Local 391 of the Teamsters union in 1983.
   The suit stemmed from the drivers' transfers from various
locations to the McLean Trucking Co.'s terminal in Winston-Salem,
N.C.
   After the transfers, the 27 were laid off and recalled on several
occasions.
   The drivers contend that McLean breached a collective-bargaining
agreement by manipulating recall procedures so it could give other
drivers preference over them, and that Local 391 failed to fairly
represent them in the resulting grievances.
   The suit sought, among other things, compensatory damages for
lost wages and benefits.
   The case is Local 391 vs. Terry, 88-1719.

<HEAD>Bomb Causes Major Damage at British Barracks; IRA Suspected</HEAD>
<DATELINE>OSNABRUECK, West Germany (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A bomb ripped through living
quarters at a British military barracks Monday, and West German
officials said they suspect the Irish Republican Army was
responsible.
   No one was injured in the early morning blast. Only six soldiers
were sleeping in the barracks at the time, the British military said.
   A West German boilerman employed at the Osnabrueck barracks
surprised two suspects, who fled and left four unexploded bombs
behind, said Hans-Juergen Foerster, a prosecutor's office spokesman.
   The bombing came five days after West German officials indicted
two suspected IRA members for attacks on British military bases in
West Germany.
   Foerster said no one had claimed responsibility for Monday's
attack, but added: ``The target of the attack and the method used
substantiate suspicions that the perpetrators are from the
Provisional Irish Republican Army.''
   Foerster said investigators discovered the five bombs contained
176 pounds of the Czechoslovak plastic explosive Semtex.
   ``The four unexploded bombs were not set to detonate, presumably
because the perpetrators were disturbed by an employee,'' Foerster
said in an interview.
   British Forces spokesman Nigel Ginnis said the 62-year-old
boilerman ``was going about his business and discovered two men
outside the building.
   ``A shot was fired ... and he was hit in the face with a gun belt
or something of that nature.''
   The boilerman was treated for scratches and bruises at a local
hospital and released.
   Ginnis said an alarm was raised after a soldier in the building
was awakened by the shot and went outside to investigate.
   Col. Henry Day of British Forces Headquarters in West Germany
said the bomb exploded at 1:10 a.m. at Quebec Barracks, 100 miles
north of Duesseldorf.
   It is headquarters for about 800 troops from the 12th Armoured
Brigade and 23rd Engineer Regiment of the Royal Corps of Engineers,
officials said.
   A British military spokesman in Osnabrueck, who declined to be
identified by name, said the explosion caused severe damage.
   ``It blew a hole from ground level to the roof of the building
measuring about eight feet in diameter,'' he said.
   About 1,000 people living nearby were evacuated temporarily while
investigators searched for more bombs, Osnabrueck police said.
   The IRA has attacked British troops in Europe to help force the
British out of Northern Ireland and unite the predominantly
Protestant province with mostly Roman Catholic Ireland.
   On June 14, West German prosecutors said they indicted two
suspected IRA members on attempted murder charges in 1987 and 1988
bombing attacks aimed at British military that wounded 46 people,
most West German.

<TEXT>
   Tours of the historic district are a main
attraction in this elegant port city where the Civil War began, but
the hot ticket this week has been a tour of its poorest
neighborhoods.
   Mayor Joseph P. Riley Jr. displayed for his counterparts from
around the country how Charleston not only preserved and revitalized
its downtown but extended the same emphasis on preservation and
thoughtful urban design into such often-dreary needs as parking and
public housing.
   ``In the '60s, the question was, `Are the cities going to die?'
'' said Riley. ``We found out that they aren't.
   ``The question now is, `What kinds of quality are our cities
going to represent?' What we have to be very careful about is
realizing we are building our country's civilization in the cities,
and we have to do that with quality.''
   Riley, host of the annual meeting this week of the U.S.
Conference of Mayors, is known among mayors for his success at urban
redevelopment _ and for obtaining the federal grants that made it
possible.
   He showed off that success Sunday when he led three busloads of
mayors and other urban leaders on a tour of his city of 80,000.
   The city's poor East Side is still blighted by dilapidated
buildings, and Riley says Charleston needs more public housing. But
the housing the city has built for its poor is attractive and is
scattered throughout neighborhoods.
   Low-income housing was built, not in big projects or bleak boxes,
but in renovated homes that date to the 1880s and in reproductions
of them. Each is in the unique style native to the city:
one-room-wide homes fit onto narrow lots with porches along the side.
   ``We believe so strongly in Charleston that nothing has to be
ugly, and certainly nothing the city builds should be ugly,'' said
Riley, 46, mayor since 1975.
   The emphasis has been on preserving individual buildings and the
feel of neighborhoods. The cost, he insisted, was no more to
renovate old homes than it would have been to tear down and build
anew.
   ``Usually when you demolish something, it is a sign of failure,''
Riley said. ``Our goal is to take every old dilapidated structure in
the city and turn it into housing for our low-income citizens.''
   In downtown Charleston, King Street was dying a decade ago, he
said. Now it's thriving, from its old storefronts to the new $78
million Charleston Place complex of hotel, shops and convention
center where the mayors are meeting.
   The complex was completed three years ago, assisted by $14
million in Urban Development Action Grants and other federal aid.
   The hotel was scaled back from original high-rise plans and
designed with curving bricks and balconies that blend smoothly with
the city's old homes and buildings.
   Riley also showcased downtown parking garages that have been
given tasteful disguises: retail shops on the first floor, and
louvers on the upper levels.
   He also took the mayors through the muck of a waterfront park
still under construction. It affords a view of Fort Sumter, where
the first shots of the Civil War were fired, and will become a major
attraction in an area that has been abandoned and unattractive for a
century.
   No detail is too small to escape the city's beautification. The
city spent $5,000 to convert one traffic island from pavement to a
mini-park with grass and Palmetto trees.
   On a bigger scale, the abandoned city incinerator was turned into
a community center, giant smokestacks still standing out front.
   Parks in poor neighborhoods were reclaimed, with chain-link
fencing replaced by landscaping touches.
   ``Quality design and construction was their right as well,''
Riley said of the residents of poor neighborhoods.
   But while Riley was showing mayors how redevelopment can succeed,
he also made the point that it would be difficult for other cities
to repeat. The UDAG program that has pumped $25 million into the
city to attract private investment is ending, and federal aid for
housing and other programs is dwindling.

   The government is increasingly portraying soldiers
who helped crush the pro-democracy movement as heroes and martyrs,
focusing heavily on grisly descriptions and grieving families.
   China's hard-line leadership has been using state-controlled
media to encourage sympathy for the military by focusing on gruesome
instances in which soldiers were slain or wounded.
   ``Li Guorui was thrown off this bridge early on the morning of
June 4,'' a People's Armed Police officer said Monday at Beijing's
Fuchengmen intersection.
   Wreaths of multicolored paper chrysanthemums lined the bridge in
memory of the 20-year-old from Inner Mongolia. A photo of Li was
draped in black ribbons, and offerings of fruit and drinks were laid
before it.
   At Fuchengmen and elsewhere, displays of wreaths show where
soldiers fell.
   Banners pay tribute to them, offering sympathy and praise from
schoolchildren, workers, the Communist Party and fellow soldiers.
   ``Li broke his right leg, cracked his skull and bled to death,''
the police officer told an American journalist before another
officer told the reporter he had to stop interviewing and taking
photographs because it violated martial law orders.
   The Chinese media have given much attention to Li, 25-year-old
Liu Guogeng and Cui Guozheng. The three were killed during the June
3-4 offensive by the People's Liberation Army against pro-democracy
protesters in Beijing's Tiananmen Square.
   Liu was beaten and burned on Changan Avenue as the army shot its
way toward Tiananmen in the pre-dawn hours of June 4, and Cui was
thrown off a pedestrian bridge at the Chongwenmen intersection and
set on fire.
   Western intelligence estimates and Chinese sources say up to
3,000 people were killed during the march on Tiananmen. The
government says fewer than 300 died, about half of them soldiers.
   For the last several days the media has shown wounded soldiers,
citizens thanking troops, and eulogies for the three martyrs.
   Premier Li Peng, who imposed martial law May 20, and Qiao Shi,
who is apparently being eased into the post of Communist Party
chief, were shown on evening television news meeting the grieving
families of the three dead men on Monday.
   ``We are deeply pained by their glorious sacrifice. I thank you,
fathers and mothers, for raising such fine soldiers,'' Li told
relatives. ``Their deaths have also awakened thousands upon
thousands of people in seeing through the brutal nature of the
rebels.''
   A day earlier, President Yang Shangkun, a former general who
Chinese sources say ordered the raid on Tiananmen, met with the
families.
   ``They are the glory of your families, the glory of the army and
the glory of the nation,'' Yang said in the People's Liberation Army
Daily.
   A few hundred yards west of Tiananmen on Changan Avenue, a few
dozen wreaths surround a photo of Liu, a second lieutenant.
   A large poster describes how he joined the army in Shandong in
1983, was made platoon leader in 1987, applied for Communist Party
membership and was preparing to get married.
   ``On June 4, during the struggle to calm the
counter-revolutionary turmoil, he made a heroic sacrifice,'' the
poster reads.
   ``Going to the aid of comrades surrounded by crowds, he was
beaten with steel poles and bricks,'' it says. ``Hoodlums beat him
as he lay in a pool of his own blood, and poured gasoline on him and
set him on fire. Covered in flames and blood, Liu Guogeng tried to
stand up but they beat him again. They cruelly hung his body on the
remains of a burned-out bus.''
   Cui's story is just as gruesome: beaten by ``hooligans,'' he was
thrown off the pedestrian bridge, doused with gasoline as he lay
groaning, and set on fire. His body was strung up by the neck.
   Officials have conceded in recent days that there were some
civilian casualties that were accidental. But there are no public
memorials to students or bystanders slain in the violence, which
witnesses and doctors say include the elderly and young children.
   There are signs the relentless propaganda campaign is working.
   A group of third graders from an elementary school near Li's
memorial came by to give popsicles to soldiers and People's Armed
Police. ``We just came for the fun of it,'' said one.
   ``People are beginning to understand the army,'' said a
shopkeeper a few steps away from the flowers.
   ``It's like the Chinese saying: the army and the people are like
fish and water,'' she said. ``They are one.''

<HEAD>FAA Workers Get Raises at Some Airports</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   U.S. Transportation Secretary Samuel
Skinner today said about 2,100 air traffic controllers, technicans
and safety inspectors at some of the nation's busiest airports will
get raises of up to 20 percent.
   The raises for Federal Aviation Administration employees at 11
sites in the New York, Chicago, Los Angeles and Oakland, Calif.,
areas are part of a five-year program to retain and recruit workers,
he said.
   The FAA has said it is difficult to staff those sites because of
the high cost of living and the tough workload.
   The raises will mean ``some of the highest paid people in the
federal government'' will be working for the FAA, Skinner said.
   At a news conference near the nation's busiest aiport, O'Hare
International, Skinner said a controller on the top rung of the
seniority ladder makes at least $60,000 a year, including overtime.
The raises will be added to base pay.
   Transportation Department officials said the cost of the program
would be about $5 million a year.
   In addition to being short of help, New York, Chicago, Los
Angeles and Oakland have many workers who are near retirement. But
since the raises were proposed a few months ago, controllers in
other areas of the country have applied for transfer and some who
were ready to retire want to stay, Skinner said.

   About three in four Americans say the country
needs more patriotism, according to a poll commissioned by Parents
magazine.
   The survey of 1,000 adults also found that 73 percent favored ``a
high level of patriotism.'' Fifty-three percent said they owned an
American flag, and 64 percent of them said they displayed it on the
last Fourth of July.
   Fifty-eight percent said cheating on one's income taxes was
unpatriotic, and a similar percentage agreed it was unpatriotic not
to vote. Sixty-three percent said it was patriotic to buy only
American products.
   The telephone interview of 1,000 people 21 and over was conducted
in late January using a random national sample. The margin of error
was 3.1 percent.

   Signs of a community under siege:
   ``Danger, Mosquitoes.''
   ``Yes Mosquitoes. No Refunds.''
   ``Don't Be Bugged: Choose From a Wide Variety of Repellants.''
   This year's mosquito population in parts of west-central Vermont
evokes Alfred Hitchcock's ``The Birds,'' a film in which flocks of
normally benign birds attack humans.
   Just ask Sue Strutz, who moved to Vermont from Michigan City,
Ind., two years ago. Her husband's the one who put up the danger
sign outside their home.
   ``On a really bad day, you can see them on the kitchen window,
just swarming,'' she said as she waved a few away. ``You walk out
and you're covered.''
   Mosquitoes thrived this year because an unusually wet spring
followed two dry years. As a result, residents are swatting three
years worth of mosquitoes at once, according to Arthur Doty,
chairman of the Brandon Leicester Salisbury Insect Control District.
   Some businesses say they've been hurt by the infestation, with
some tourists cutting short their vacations at Lake Dunmore. The
'skeeters have chased children off playgrounds and picnic areas.
Attendance at Branbury State Park, where Lake Dunmore is located,
has dropped drastically.
   Gloria Currie, a park attendant who flits in and out of her toll
booth to collect user fees while winged opportunists hover nearby,
said motorists don't need to see the sign warning of the infestation.
   ``They roll down the window and the mosquitoes fly in,'' she
said. They then ``roll up the window and make a U-Turn to leave.''
   Lake Dunmore lifeguard Jeff Boltz has worked with long pants and
a beekeeper's veil.
   ``You can see clouds of mosquitoes around here,'' he said. ``You
can hear the angry hum.''
   Some store owners say their suppliers can't keep up with the
demand for insect repellant. Booth's Junction Store in Forestdale, a
village in Brandon, has sold 25 cases of the stuff.
   T-shirts featuring a group of mosquitoes and bearing the slogan
``I gave in Vermont'' sold out immediately, said clerk Carol
Constantine of Leicester.
   Most downtown merchants have a caricature of Gov. Madeleine Kunin
showing her with the body of the accursed insect and a stinger.
   Residents don't seem to place all the blame on the state,
however. Many grumble about the environmentalists who lobbied to
stop the spraying of insecticides like DDT because of health hazards.
   Tasks like mowing the lawn or working in the garden require
planning and courage.
   ``You feel like a prisoner in your own house,'' said Laura
Peterson as she wheeled her 14-month-old son through town in a
stroller equipped with mosquito netting. ``Barbeques are kind of out
of the question. It's no fun anymore.''
   Merchants fear the publicity will hurt business even more.
   ``Vermont is a tourist state,'' said Ian Booth, owner of Booth's
Junction Store in Forestdale. ``It isn't good avertising.''
   The governor announced Thursday she would call on the state
Emergency Board to appropriate $100,000 for a mosquito abatement
program. The money will pay for a mosquito specialist and an
assistant to help determine where the insects are breeding.
   On a recent mild afternoon, many residents seemed hopeful. They
said the problem seemed to be tapering off, and noted that another
insecticide spraying truck has been purchased.
   Gradually rising temperatures also may ease the situation. With
any luck, things will heat up before the Independence Day parade
scheduled for July 1. Key additions to this year's roster of honored
vehicles are two pesticide trucks.
   Bugged as they are, Brandonites haven't lost their sense of
humor. Tucked amid the articles and cartoons in the latest edition
of Dateline Brandon was a recipe for the Swat Sandwich: ``Butter two
slices of bread, step out into the door yard and slap...''

<TEXT>
   The government Monday announced
measures to try to revitalize the economy and overcome the impact of
widespread labor unrest, soaring wages and lagging production.
   President Roh Tae-woo told a special Cabinet meeting that strong
measures were needed to ensure economic growth and avoid political
unrest. He said the government would not be swayed by public
opposition.
   ``If this indiscretion and disorderliness continues, it would be
impossible to revitalize the economy with economic policies alone
... (the Cabinet must) do its utmost to restore social order and
stability,'' Roh told the meeting.
   To recover lost competitiveness on exports, officials said the
government would stabilize the won's exchange rate against foreign
currencies. There would be no more appreciation of the won against
the U.S. dollar and the won might be devalued by about 3 percent
later this year, they said.
   Under American pressure, the won went up 15.8 percent against the
dollar last year and has gained 2.5 percent so far this year. The
United States has been seeking a strong won to offset its $9 billion
trade debt with Seoul.
   Tax breaks to encourage investment and savings, and some price
controls on utilities and other items were announced.
   The administration would lower its economic growth target for
1989 to 7.5 percent, down from an initial goal of 8 percent. The new
target would be the lowest in four years.
   The annual export goal was lowered from an original $70 billion
to $68 billion, while the annual import target was revised to $64
billion, down from the original $65 billion.
   In the first five months of this year, South Korea ran a trade
deficit of $11 million, in sharp contrast to a surplus of $3.3
billion during the same period in 1988.
   Roh and economic officials stressed the need to end a recent
round of raises demanded by workers. The economy has been hit during
the past two years by strikes and demands for large raises.
   The government says strikes and labor unrest have caused $4.5
billion in lost production this year.
   Deputy Prime Minister Cho Soon said the economy also had been hit
by inflation, a decline in investments and savings, and diversion of
funds to luxury consumer items.
   Wages had increased the past two years by an average of 62.5
percent and had to be slowed, Cho said.

<HEAD>Feuding Blacks Call for Peace</HEAD>

<DATELINE>JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Two feuding black factions
called for peace Monday after a bloody weekend left at least 26
blacks dead.
   ``There must be an end to the this senseless violence tearing our
communities apart,'' said the United Democratic Front, South
Africa's largest anti-apartheid coalition, and Inkatha, a political
organization of the Zulu people.
   The two sides met for five hours Monday in the latest round of
periodic talks since the conflict erupted in 1986. Previous meetings
have not halted black-on-black violence that has killed more than
1,500 people in the southeastern cities of Durban and
Pietermaritzburg.
   Both organizations claim more than 1 million members and concede
they have little control over young supporters.
   The groups said they will try to ``expose and isolate all those
elements that we believe are actually engaged in this campaign of
promoting violence amongst our people.''
   The statement did not elaborate but is considered a reference to
white authorities and police who have made only a handful of arrests
despite the hundreds of killings.
   ``Our efforts must be directed toward uniting our people in a way
which could decisively strike a blow against apartheid and not our
people,'' the statement said of South Africa's legal policy of race
discrimination.
   Police in KwaZulu homeland said 26 blacks were killed over the
weekend, including five slain en route to a Sunday prayer rally
addressed by Mangosuthu Buthelezi, leader of the Zulus and head of
Inkatha.
   ``Black people are too busy squabbling amongst themselves,''
Buthelezi told the crowd of 5,000, many carrying knobbed, wooden
fighting sticks.
   Homeland police gave no details of the killings, but South
African police reports indicated at least nine appeared politically
motivated.
   KwaZulu police said they are investigating reports that ``unkown
white men'' were seen in a township where some deaths occurred.
However, police said they have no evidence any whites were involved
directly in the attacks.
   The United Democratic Front and Inkatha both oppose apartheid,
but the front is much more militant, favoring boycotts, sanctions,
strikes and protests not endorsed by the relatively conservative
Zulu organization.
   The front accuses police of favoring Inkatha, a charge the police
deny.
   Almost all the front's top leaders have been detained at various
times, and the organization is one of more than 30 anti-apartheid
groups officially banned last year, although it still conducts some
activities.
   Some anti-apartheid activists accuse Buthelezi of collaborating
with the white-led government by participating in the black homeland
system. Buthelezi says he sees the homelands as an interim step to
black majority rule.
   South Africa's 28 million blacks have no voice in national
affairs. The 5 million whites maintain political and economic
control and have segregated schools, neighborhoods and hospitals.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Guyana President Desmond Hoyte emerged from the
White House on Monday with praise from President Bush for the tough
economic measures Hoyte has instituted in his South American nation.
   ``I tried to impress upon President Bush our own earnestness in
trying to put our economic house in order,'' said Hoyte, who is
visiting the United States to promote business investment in Guyana.
   Despite a steep devaluation of the Guyanese currency and cuts in
price supports for such commodities as rice, flour and gasoline,
Hoyte's government managed to embark on its austerity program in
April without the riots that ensued when Venezuela struck a similar
course.
   ``President Bush expressed deep appreciation for our efforts,''
Hoyte said.
   A White House official said Bush expressed his admiration to
Hoyte ``for taking the tough steps he has done.''
   ``Bush told him he appreciates how tough it is to implement such
an austerity program,'' said the official, who insisted on
anonymity. Bush also applauded ``the tough line Hoyte has taken on
combating narcotics.''
   Hoyte, speaking with reporters outside the White House, said he
thanked Bush for U.S. economic assistance and expressed the hope
that ``this assistance will continue to be flexible.''
   On drugs, Hoyte said he has introduced ``pretty Draconian
legislation'' providing long jail sentences and the confiscation of
property from drug traffickers.
   ``We think that no individual country can tackle this mess of
narco-trafficking. It has to be a regional and international
effort,'' said Hoyte.
   Hoyte said he was encouraged by improvements in the business
outlook for his country, including ``no less than 10 overseas mining
corporations exploring for gold in Guyana.''
   ``Most significant of all has been the return of Reynolds
(Aluminum) to Guyana,'' he said. ``In 1975, we nationalized
Reynolds' holdings in Guyana. I think it is a most eloquent
testimony of the changed policies and the confidence that investors
have in the climate at the moment that Reynolds has returned.''
   Reynolds has signed an agreement to open a bauxite mine that will
produce 2.6 million tons of ore annually.
   ``The signs are very encouraging,'' said Hoyte, who was touring
major cities across the Midwest _ Chicago, Indianapolis, Toledo,
Ohio; St. Louis and Milwaukee _ to preach the gospel of investment
in Guyana.
   ``I don't know what is going to arise really from these contacts,
but ... it makes good sense to make Guyana known to as many business
people and business communities as possible,'' he said.
   Guyana has already signed agreements with its neighbors Venezuela
and Brazil to cooperate on the interdiction of drug trafficking
``and generally to join forces in combating this evil,'' he said.
   An agreement will be signed later this year with Suriname, he
added.

   A federal judge today sentenced two sports agents
to prison terms of up to five years for signing ballplayers to
representation contracts before their eligibility for college
athletics had expired.
   Norby Walters, 57, received five years in prison, and Lloyd
Bloom, 29, three years. U.S. District Judge George Marovich also
gave them five years' probation.
   They were convicted April 13 of racketeering, conspiracy and mail
fraud and had faced up to 55 years in prison.
   ``There were no heroes,'' Marovich said of the case, subject of a
five-week trial.
   The judge said the athletes involved were equally guilty of
fraud, and he gave ``fair warning'' to athletes, sports agents,
university administrators and others involved in college athletics:
   ``You may be playing in a different ballgame and it might be
called hardball. ... There is a previously unrecognized player on
the field: the rule of law.''
   The two agents were accused of paying athletes thousands of
dollars to sign secret representation contracts before their college
eligibility had expired, a violation of NCAA rules; of threatening
athletes to prevent them from breaking the agreements, and of
cheating seven major universities out of scholarship money through
the NCAA violation, which made the athletes ineligible to play.
   Forty-three players who signed with Walters and Bloom avoided
prosecution by agreeing to cooperate with the government in addition
to performing community service and repaying part of their
scholarships to their schools.
   Philadelphia Eagles wide receiver Chris Carter pleaded guilty in
September to mail fraud and obstruction of justice. He said he took
$5,000 from Walters and Bloom in 1986 while a junior at Ohio State
University.
   In April he was fined $15,000 and ordered to perform 600 hours of
community service.
   ``I'm really sorry for all the problems I gave caused everyone,''
Walters told the court, almost whispering and at times choking back
tears. ``I invested almost a million dollars in this sports
business. I lost it all _ I lost every penny.''
   ``If I believed for one instant that I was breaking the law, I
wouldn't have started,'' Walter said, adding: ``I didn't threaten
anybody.''
   Bloom told the court: `I am deeply sorry for what I've done. If I
can be given a second chance I'd like it.
   Attorneys for the agents have appealed the convictions.

<HEAD>Multiple Killer Executed After Asking Forgiveness</HEAD>

<DATELINE>CARSON CITY, Nev. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A multiple killer and career criminal
who wanted no more appeals and to ``die with dignity'' was executed
early Monday for killing a transient.
   William Paul Thompson, 52, who also asked for forgiveness from
his family and from families of three and possibly six murder
victims, was given a lethal injection at 2:01 a.m. and pronounced
dead eight minutes later.
   He was the third person put to death in Nevada and the 112th
person executed in the nation since the U.S. Supreme Court allowed
reinstatement of the death penalty in 1976. Seven other murderers
also have been executed this year.
   Thompson spent the hours before his execution talking with a
minister and with another death row inmate who is scheduled to die
later this week at the Nevada State Prison.
   The 300-pound inmate spoke briefly with the five guards who
helped to hoist him onto a gurney in the prison's former gas chamber
while 25 witnesses and reporters watched.
   Thompson never looked at the witnesses. He stared at the ceiling
while he was strapped to the gurney and the injection was
administered.
   According to Warden Pete Demosthenes, Thompson's last words when
guards closed the death chamber door were: ``Thank you for letting
me die with dignity.''
   In the only interview he granted, Thompson told The Associated
Press on Saturday that he had recently found religion and was
``paying back to society the only thing I have to offer it.''
   ``When you give everything you got, that should be enough. My
death is payment to everyone I've ever hurt, my family, the victims'
families.''
   Thompson said he didn't want to stop his execution because he was
ready to die and might kill again if he remained alive.
   Thompson was sentenced to die for the 1984 killing of Randy
Waldron, a 28-year-old transient in Reno. After that sentence, he
was convicted of killing two brothers who were camping near Auburn,
Calif.
   Thompson said Waldron ``just got in my way'' while he was on the
run from the killings of the brothers. He said he shot the brothers
because they were drug informants.
   Thompson said he killed three other men, including the
murder-for-hire of a federal prosecutor in Oklahoma in 1983. But in
Tulsa, Okla., U.S. Attorney Tony Graham said he wasn't aware of any
prosecutor in the state who had disappeared or was killed in 1983
and said he didn't intend to investigate the claim.
   The other murders were in New York and in Kansas, Thompson said.
He wouldn't reveal the victims' names.

   A major river swollen by heavy rains
spilled over its embankment, washing away thousands of huts and
leaving 50,000 people homeless, officials said Monday.
   The River Gumti breached the mud embankment in four places since
Sunday in Comilla, inundating several thousand acres of crops, said
Alim Hussain, a Comilla district official.
   The deluge swept away thousands of mud-and-straw houses in about
100 villages of the district, 55 miles southeast of Dhaka, according
to a Comilla official who arrived in Dhaka on Monday.
   Many people were marooned on the roofs of houses and hundreds
camped on roads and along the unbroken portions of the embankment
while rain continued Monday, he said.
   A senior official at the Relief Ministry said the ministry was
planning to help the affected areas in Comilla and Rangpur on
Tuesday.
   Officials at Water Development Board said some areas of the
neighboring Rangpur and Lalmonirhat districts also were flooded by
water from the River Teesta.
   They said the Brahmaputra and the Ganges, the country's two major
rivers, will keep rising in the next 24 hours.
   Bangladesh has hundreds of rivers that form the deltas of the
Brahmaputra and the Ganges. Last year, floods killed 1,400 people
and left 2.3 million homeless.

<HEAD>Bentsen Bill Would Cover More Pregnant Women, Children</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JENNIFER DIXON</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Sen. Lloyd Bentsen introduced legislation
Monday that would expand Medicaid health-care coverage to thousands
of low-income children and pregnant women at an estimated annual
cost of $1 billion.
   The Texas Democrat is attempting to provide Medicaid coverage to
pregnant women and children under age 6 in families whose income is
185 percent of the poverty level _ $22,385 for a family of four.
   Under legislation enacted last year and being phased in fiscal
1989 and 1990, Medicaid coverage is guaranteed to pregnant women and
infants under age 1 in families whose income is at the poverty level
_ $12,100 for a family of four.
   Bentsen's bill would expand coverage to an additional 300,000
pregnant women and 1.6 million children under age 6 in fiscal years
1990 and 1991, his office said.
   The estimated cost of phasing in Medicaid coverage would be $790
million the first year and $1.2 billion in 1991.
   ``America is facing what one health group recently called a
`child health crisis' and we must respond to it,'' Bentsen said in
remarks accompanying the bill. ``American babies die at a higher
rate than babies born in Singapore _ or 16 other countries. More
than 40,000 infants die in this country every year.''
   Bentsen, the chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, said the
bill is aimed at assuring that the most vulnerable of the 37 million
Americans who have no health insurance will have a chance to get
basic health care.
   Bentsen said 40 percent of children under 4 don't even get their
basic set of immunizations.
   The Finance Committee has approved another Bentsen bill that
would provide a child health care tax credit to help pay the cost of
health insurance for children. The bill is pending in the full
Senate.
   His legislation introduced Monday also requires Early Periodic
Screening, Diagnosis and Treatment (EPSDT) under Medicaid whenever a
doctor suspects a medical or mental health condition. It also would
require prompt treatment once a condition is diagnosed.
   Also included is an increase in funding for the Maternal and
Child Health Services block grant program, from $561 million to $711
million in fiscal 1990.

   More than two years after a judge ruled
that Mississippi's method of electing judges violated the federal
Voting Rights Act, eight blacks are on the ballot in elections
Tuesday that could more than double the number of blacks on the
bench.
   Also on the ballot are three proposed constitutional amendments.
One would eliminate the racially motivated, and long-since
unenforced, poll tax law.
   Judicial elections are being held this year because of a federal
court order forcing judicial districts to be redrawn.
   In April 1987, U.S. District Judge William H. Barbour Jr. of
Jackson ruled that the state's judicial districts discriminated
against blacks. The ruling, which was the first to apply a section
of the 1965 federal Voting Rights Act to judicial elections, was
upheld by the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals.
   Barbour ordered some districts redrawn to create minority
subdistricts so that black voters would have a better opportunity to
elect black candidates to judicial posts.
   The ruling and the appeals process put judicial elections in the
state on hold until this year, when all 69 circuit and chancery
judgeships are being filled.
   Party primaries were held in April, and the winners of Tuedsay's
races will take office July 3.
   Mississippi now has only four black judges among the 78 Supreme
Court, Circuit Court and Chancery Court judges in the state _
Supreme Court Justice Reuben Anderson, Circuit Judges Fred L. Banks
Jr. and Lillie Blackmon-Sanders, and Chancery Judge Isaac Byrd.
   Each was appointed to fill a vacancy, but Anderson went on to win
a full eight-year term in 1986. Byrd did not seek election to a full
term this year, and the other two are seeking regular terms Tuesday.
   Blackmon-Sanders is opposed by a Republican. Banks and one other
black Democrat, Isadore W. Patrick, are unopposed in the general
election.
   In other cicuit court and chancery court cases, three black
candidates are facing incumbents, while two others are vying for
open judgeships where neither candidate is an incumbent.
   Chancery courts handle civil lawsuits while circuit courts handle
criminal cases.
   One proposed constitutional amendment on the ballot would delete
references to the levying of a poll tax as a requirement to register
to vote. It also would eliminate the four-month school year and a
county common school fund, which were to be financed from the poll
tax collections.
   The poll tax was aimed at keeping blacks off voter rolls. It has
remained on the books in the state even though it was struck down by
the U.S. Supreme Court in 1966.
   Another proposed constitutional amendment would remove the
prohibition against out-of-state businesses operating a railroad in
Mississippi _ all but unenforceable with the demise of local
railroad companies. The third would allow the Legislature more
flexibility in how it proposes future constitutional amendments.

<HEAD>Woman Searches for Her Mother and Daughter</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By FRANCIS HOPKINS</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Rosalyn Taylor O'Neale was moving steadily toward
middle age as a fast-track career woman when her brother whispered
to her something that gave her pause.
   He told her she was adopted.
   The news hit hard. It got her thinking, not only about the woman
who gave her up, but about herself. O'Neale had given up a daughter
for adoption when she was 19.
   ``It's very bizarre growing up thinking you are biological and
everyone else, even cousins, know,'' O'Neale, 39, said in a
telephone interview from her home in suburban Acton.
   So, for two years _ since her brother divulged the news while
their mother was undergoing heart surgery _ she has been conducting
the unusual search for both her mother and her daughter.
   ``It's an odd feeling, like I'm a single person in the world. I
want to be with people that look like me,'' said O'Neale, a human
relations specialist at the Digital Corp. headquarters in Maynard.
   Mary Byrne, senior program director for Boston Children's Service
Association, said that in her 35 years of working with adoptions she
knows of only one other case like O'Neale's.
   Born June 21, 1950, in Louisville, Ky., O'Neale was adopted by
the social worker handling the case when her mother gave her up at
the age of 18 months. She was distressed she had not been told about
the adoption as a child, but she is close to the family who raised
her, and they're helping in her search.
   O'Neale signed the adoption papers for her own daughter five days
after giving birth Sept. 9, 1969, to the girl she called Katherine
Elaine.
   She said she doesn't regret it _ ``I was too young'' _ but
learning of her own adoption has heightened O'Neale's concerns about
her daughter. Often while speaking at colleges as a volunteer for
the Urban League, she wonders if her daughter is in the audience,
she said.
   ``It's emotionally complex,'' she said. ``You are never
disconnected from that child. I want her to know that I knew I would
have been a bad mother.''
   She said she feels a need to tell her mother she ``turned out
fine,'' and find out if her daughter received a good home.
   O'Neale has made hundreds of phone calls, written repeatedly to
government agencies, hired people to assist in her search, and spent
thousands of dollars in the process. Recently she ran a classified
ad in USA Today.
   ``I am determined that before I grow older, those women and I
will get together, and we will know each other immediately,'' said
O'Neale.
   O'Neale's adoptive mother, who lives in Kentucky, has a different
last name and asked that it not be used. She said O'Neale was not
told she was adopted because ``we wanted to prevent conflict between
her and the natural son. I always treated her like she came from my
womb.''
   Now she is helping in the search. And the Kentucky government
agency that handles adoption records has sent along the name and
background on her biological mother, Loraine Ash, the names of Ash's
parents, and most important for O'Neale, proof of a beginning.
   ``Before, I felt like I dropped out of nowhere,'' said O'Neale.
``I ran around the house showing my footprint to my friends.''
   Now she knows she shares with her biological mother an allergy to
tomatoes, and had tonsillitis in early childhood. O'Neale said the
records show her name at birth was Roseline Elaine. Her adoptive
mother changed it to Rosalyn Katherine, and O'Neale changed her name
five years ago to Rosalyn Taylor O'Neale, because, she said, it
sounds distinguished.
   She says her use of Elaine as the middle name for her daughter,
when it was also her original middle name, is coincidental.
   Armed with background on her mother, O'Neale believes she will
soon be successful in half of her search. But she notes that,
apparently, she got the names by mistake.
   After yet another lead did not pan out recently, O'Neale
collapsed into tears and decided she would give up the search for a
while.
   But three days later, the Kentucky agency suddenly responded to
one of her many letters by sending records. Someone in the agency
apparently slipped, unaware of the confidentiality rules.
   ``It's where the system breaks down and it helps adopted
people,'' she said. ``It's what I needed. I feel reinspired now.''

   A 76-day-old strike against Pittston Coal
Group spread to Kentucky today, and a wildcat walkout by more than
20,000 miners in support of the Pittston employees expanded to at
least nine states.
   Terry Varney, spokesman for a United Mine Workers local, said
production stopped at three Eastern Coal Corp. mines in Kentucky as
of 12:01 a.m. Eastern is a Pittston subsidiary. About 200 people
work at the mines, Varney said.
   The union had predicted the Kentucky strike after 1,600 Pittston
miners walked off the job in April in Virginia and West Virginia.
   A sympathy strike begun on June 12 idled more 20,000 UMW members
as of Sunday in Pennsylvania, West Virginia, Virginia, Tennessee,
Indiana and Kentucky. This morning, at least 2,000 miners in Ohio,
Illinois and Alabama joined the strike.
   Unlike the Pittston walkout, the sympathy strike has not received
the public blessing of the UMW, but some union members said the
walkout is being directed by UMW President Richard Trumka. He has
been unavailable for comment for days.
   In Ohio, workers at three Southern Ohio Coal Co. mines employing
1,100 union miners didn't show up, said Terry Trimper, a company
spokeswoman. In Illinois, AMAX Coal Co. said none of its 655 miners
at its Wabash Mine showed.
   In Alabama, Drummond Coal Co. said three-fourths of its 1,900
union members on its late Sunday shift did not show, and Jim Walter
Resources Inc. said its underground operations in two counties were
idle. The number of strikers was not given.
   There was no comment this morning from the United Mine Workers.
Trumka and UMW spokesman Joe Corcoran did not immediately return
calls.
   Union officials in Nova Scotia and Alabama have said miners there
also were likely to strike. And in Indiana, Old Ben Coal Co. today
asked a federal judge to order its 350 miners back to work. The
judge did not immediately rule.
   As of Sunday, all of Indiana's 1,750 union miners were off the
job for the first time in eight years, while in West Virginia about
two-thirds of the state's 24,000 miners are on a sympathy strike. At
least 2,500 wildcat strikers were idled in Pennsylvania, 790 in
Virginia, 1,270 in Kentucky and 200 in Tennessee.
   The wildcat strikers say they are off the job to show support for
the strike against Pittston, which last week declared negotiations
at an impasse. That move allows Pittston to implement its latest
contract offer.
   At issue in the Pittston strike are benefits and wages. Miners
fear that Pittston's demands, if successful, will be applied by
other U.S. companies.
   A major rallying point for the strikers is the jailing of three
UMW leaders who helped organize the Pittston walkout.
   As the Eastern Coal strike began, a picket line was set up at the
gates of the company's main coal production facility at McAndrews.
About 20 miners milled about a freshly constructed picket shack.
   A State Police cruiser drove by, and the troopers asked the
miners how they were doing and if they had any hot coffee. The
policemen left, wishing the miners good luck.
   All miners wore camouflage and had yellow ribbons pinned to their
shirts in a show of solidarity.
   Local 5737 President Glenn Stanley said he received a telegram
and a phone call from Trumka on Sunday authorizing the local to
strike.
   According to Stanley, Trumka said it was time to strike Eastern
because the company reportedly was ready to ship a large order of
coal.
   Eastern did not immediately a call this morning.

   Headlines about several unsolved murders in
eastern Virginia have faded, but the victims' families have not
forgotten and they're pressing law enforcement agencies to keep
investigating.
   ``You want to know and you don't want to know,'' said Richard
Call, whose son, Keith, disappeared on a date. ``There's still a ray
of hope, very slight, I guess.''
   On Tuesday, the families will press the State Crime Commission
for a multijurisdictional police task force to investigate the
crimes.
   ``We're hoping maybe somebody else out there won't end up like
our family members,'' said Robert E. Fanton, father-in-law of Brian
C. Pettinger, whose bound body was found in the James River in
February 1988.
   It's been nearly three years since Cathleen Thomas, a young
stockbroker, and Rebecca Dowski, a college student, were found
strangled with their throats cut in Ms. Thomas' car along the
Colonial Parkway.
   About two years ago, David Knobling, 20, and Robin Edwards, 14,
were found shot to death near the Ragged Island Wildlife Refuge
where they had gone on a date.
   In April 1888, Christopher Newport College students Cassandra
Hailey and Keith Call disappeared on their first date. The elder
Call found their abandoned car along the Colonial Parkway the next
morning.
   Other cases the parents are concerned about include the January
1988 slaying of Dawn Hill at an Eastern Shore service station, the
September 1988 shooting death of Milton Ames while he walked in
Exmore and the fatal stabbing of Laurie Ann Powell, who was found
floating in the James River in April 1988.
   The relatives do not think all the cases are connected, but they
do think the police should be doing more.
   ``We had four jurisdictions that were involved. They want to be
the one that has the so-called glory of solving the case,'' said
Kathy Knobling, David Knobling's stepmother. ``Nobody wants to share
the information.''
   Mrs. Knobling and other relatives of 10 missing or murdered
people formed Family and Friends Against Crime Today to call
attention to unsolved crimes. She said the membership of the group
and the number of victims represented fluctuates.
   The FBI is investigating the Thomas-Dowski murders and the
Call-Hailey disappearances because they occurred on federal park
property.
   ``We don't have information that those cases are related other
than the fact that they both occurred in fairly close proximity,''
said Joe Wolfinger, special agent with the FBI's Norfolk office.
   He said law enforcement agencies in the area already are
cooperating but that he would not object to a task force if it would
help solve the crimes.
   ``We are meeting and discussing and have met with and discussed
the facts to all these cases with the appropriate law enforcement
offices,'' he said.
   The other slayings are being investigated by state and local
police.
   ``They are trying, but they've got robberies, they've got rapes,
they've got other cases that have clues coming in,'' Mrs. Knobling
said. ``Our cases get put on the back burner.''
   She said the families have obtained 23,000 signatures on
petitions seeking a regional police task force. They are taking
their cases to the crime commission because it advises the governor
and state legislature on crime issues.
   Bob Colvin, the commission's executive director, said he was
unaware of the commission ever being asked to help set up a regional
task force.
   ``I'm not sure what we can do,'' he said.
   While the victims' families wait for arrests, they have become
friends, Mrs. Knobling said. They have cookouts and sometimes get
together just to talk about their grief and their efforts to make
sure the murders are not forgotten.
   ``These murders are unsolved. You've got a murderer or two or
three walking around out there. They could do it again,'' she said.
``If we can solve one murder, we will feel like we will have
accomplished what we set out to do.''

<TEXT>
   Soviet human rights activist Andrei
Sakharov on Monday urged world leaders to press for an end to death
sentences for pro-democracy leaders in China.
   ``What has happened in China does not concern China alone. The
whole world is affected. What has happened is also likely to affect
events in the Soviet Union,'' Sakharov said during his first visit
to Britain.
   Sakharov said he sent telegrams to Prime Minister Margaret
Thatcher, President Bush, Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev,
West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl, French President Francois
Mitterrand and U.N. Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar.
   He wrote: ``Please do everything in your power to save from death
the participants in the democratic movement in China. By refusing to
talk with the democratic powers, by using force of arms and now
sentencing people to death, the Chinese authorities make a
historical mistake which can have tragic consequences for the
developments in China, the U.S.S.R. and the whole world.''
   In West Germany, a spokesman for Kohl said the chancellor has
sent a letter to Chinese Premier Li Peng asking authorities to
commute the death sentences of three dissidents in Shanghai.
   Chief government spokesman Hans Klein said Kohl had also asked
Chinese authorities to show clemency in other cases following the
June 3-4 military crackdown.
   China needs a ``policy of reconciliation and not a policy of
retaliation,'' Klein quoted Kohl's letter as saying.
   Sakharov said at a news conference he feared the sort of backlash
seen in China against democratic forces could spill over into the
Soviet Union and other socialist countries.
   In the Soviet Union, he said, ``we are in a very critical
situation. We don't know how everything will progress. We have to be
very careful. Don't try to push things.''
   Sakharov received an honorary degree from Sussex University in
Brighton on Monday. On Tuesday, he is to speak at the Royal
Institute for International Affairs and the following day will
receive an honorary degree from the Oxford University. He will meet
Mrs. Thatcher on Friday.
   The 68-year-old scientist and Nobel Peace Prize laureate was
elected to the new Congress of the People's Deputies by the Soviet
Academy of Sciences in April, three years after he was freed from
internal exile in the Soviet Union for opposing the Soviet military
intervention in Afghanistan.

   A West Berlin man was arrested by East German
border guards Monday as he drilled a hole in the Berlin Wall, police
said.
   West Berlin police said the man was arrested while using a
jackhammer on the West Berlin side of the wall to drill a hole in
the concrete barrier.
   The Berlin Wall, which divides the city, is set back several
yards from the actual border. The man was standing on East German
territory at the time of his arrest, West Berlin police said.
   Police said they had no information about the man and did not
know why he was drilling the hole.
   Witnesses said the man, in his 30s, told them he was drilling in
protest because East German authorities won't allow his mother to
travel to the West.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Bush, adopting a new approach in arms
negotiations, on Monday proposed that the United States and Soviet
Union agree upon and implement anti-cheating measures even before
completing a treaty to cut long-range nuclear weapons.
   Such steps could involve trial inspections at each other's
missile sites and estabishment of technical groups to discuss
equipment needed for verification measures.
   Bush announced his proposal as U.S. and Soviet negotiators met in
Geneva to resume strategic arms reduction talks (START) after a
seven-month recess.
   The talks, aimed at reducing U.S. and Soviet long-range bombers,
land-based missiles and nuclear submarines by 30 percent to 50
percent, are the latest round in negotiations that began four years
ago.
   Bush said the goal was ``creating a more stable nuclear balance
and strengthening deterrence by reducing and constraining those
strategic nuclear forces which pose the greatest threat to security
and stability.''
   Bush, in a written statement, said verification may be the most
complex issue facing negotiators.
   He said the United States was proposing that the two sides ``make
a special effort to agree on and to begin implementing as soon as
possible'' verification measures and so-called stability measures.
   ``Early agreement and implementation of them will speed
resolution of outstanding issues and give added momentum to the
efforts of our two countries to conclude expeditiously a START
agreement,'' Bush said.
   White House spokesman Roman Popadiuk said Bush's proposal
probably would be presented to the Soviets during the first plenary
session of the Geneva talks on Wednesday.
   Typicially, verification is one of the last issues for the
negotiators, after they have concluded how deeply they are going to
cut weapons, Popadiuk said.
   ``We're going to put an added emphasis on verification up
front,'' he said.
   The press spokesman insisted, however, ``we are not putting
verification first. ... We continue to work on verfication and other
aspects of the START treaty simultaneously.
   Popadiuk said the emphasis on verification ``involves no
preconditions or anything of that nature'' with regard to other
aspects of the negotiations.
   However, it does represent a shift in tactics in that it
envisions putting some verification measures in place before the two
sides have reached agreement on an overall treaty.
   Bush said U.S. negotiators were returning to the talks ``with my
firm pledge that we will work vigorously to achieve fair and
far-reaching agreements that strengthen peace. Nothing has higher
priority.
   ``I am heartened by the growing evidence that the Soviet Union is
prepared to negotiate seriously about agreements that promise to
reduce the risk of war,'' he said.
   ``Much has already been accomplished in the negotiations; much
remains to be done.''
   About 90 percent of the work was completed when the negotiations
were suspended last November.
   The unfinished 10 percent contains some of the thorniest issues,
such as weapons ceilings, limits on air- and sea-launched cruise
missiles, verification and how to deal with mobile missiles.
   While not ruling out some adjustments from the Reagan
administration, the White House says ``there will be a considerable
degree of continuity'' in the U.S. position.

   U.S.-Soviet talks to reduce long-range nuclear
weapons resumed Monday, with President Bush introducing a new
emphasis on monitoring missile sites.
   Bush is suggesting the superpowers for the first time start
verification, or monitoring compliance, before they finish
negotiating a treaty.
   A quick breakthrough appears unlikely in the talks begun under
former President Ronald Reagan, since both sides have indicated no
changes of position on major outstanding issues.
   Moscow and Washington sent new delegation leaders to Geneva for
the 11th round of talks since March 1985 on a Strategic Arms
Reductions Treaty and defense and space issues.
   Richard Burt, a military expert and former U.S. ambassador to
West Germany, replaced veteran negotiator Max Kampelman after the
seven-month pause. Yuri Nazarkin, chief Soviet delegate to the
40-nation Conference on Disarmament, succeeded Alexei Obukhov. The
talks will last six to seven weeks, Burt said.
   In Washington, Bush said verification ``may be the most complex''
issue facing negotiators.Bush proposed the two sides make a special
effort ``to agree on and begin implementing as soon as possible''
verification measures.
   He said this ``will speed resolution of outstanding issues.''
   White House spokesman Roman Popadiuk said the steps could include
visits to each other's missile sites.
   Burt received Nazarkin for a one-hour, 20-minute opening session
at the U.S. Mission. It was the second time they met.
   Afterward, Burt said he outlined ``President Bush's overall
approach to arms control, emphasizing the president's commitment to
reducing the risk of nuclear war.''
   Nazarkin spoke of ``a good start'' and also held out the prospect
of unspecified Soviet initiatives.
   ``As the round progresses, we will use our ideas and put them on
the table,'' he told reporters.
   In detailed negotiations starting Wednesday with a full meeting
of both delegations, Burt will lead the U.S. team and Lem Masterkov
will continue as Soviet negotiator under Nazarkin.
   Delegates are expected first to review the many agreed points in
the 400-page draft pact.
   Talks were delayed by the Bush administration's review of
national security policy during the Reagan presidency.
   A new proposal Bush's advisers are drafting calls for on-site
test inspections in both countries to monitor cuts of long-range
ballistic missiles already in the draft treaty, according to U.S.
officials. A Pentagon official said Bush wants to take advantage of
the new Soviet openness.
   But neither side has hinted at movement in disputes over the
Pentagon's space-based ``Star Wars'' missile defense, sea-launched
cruise missiles and mobile land-based missiles.
   The Soviets say the U.S. missile shield violates the 1972
superpower Anti-Ballistic Missile treaty.
   Disputes have developed over Moscow's demand for including
sea-based cruise missiles under the treaty and Washington's call for
a ban on mobile missiles.
   Adm. William J. Crowe Jr., chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff,
has predicted ``protracted and agonizing'' negotiations.
   The superpowers have agreed to much of a draft treaty to cut
long-range, or strategic, nuclear forces by 30 percent to 50 percent.
   The treaty is intended to cover nuclear weapons with which the
superpowers can strike each other, including those considered most
dangerous _ sea- and land-based ballistic missiles and heavy bombers.
   Already agreed at earlier rounds are lowered ceilings of 6,000
nuclear warheads and 1,600 delivery vehicles _ missiles and bombers
_ for each side. Outlines of a system for monitoring compliance also
were set.

   A Coast Guard pilot set his helicopter
down in rough seas Monday to rescue a boater who apparently had
suffered a heart attack, officials said.
   ``It was terrific airmanship,'' said Lt. Jeff Karonis, Coast
Guard spokesman in Miami.
   Raymond Tjotta, 47, of Tampa, was airlifted to Shands Hospital in
Gainesville, where he was in fair condition, a spokesman there said.
   The rescue effort began after Tjotta's 30-foot sailboat, the
Viking Wolf, broadcast a mayday 11 p.m. Sunday, Karonis said. He
said a Coast Guard jet located the sailboat in the Gulf of Mexico 17
miles from the mouth of the Steinhatchee River.
   After the H-3 helicopter reached the sloop at 3 a.m., the crew
made several attempts to hoist Tjotta and a companion from the boat
in a basket.
   A crewman then was lowered onto the boat, and Lt. William Moore,
the pilot, landed the helicopter in seas that were running up to
eight feet.
   ``A water landing is always more difficult because of the
swells,'' Karonis said. ``The waves are not constant. And that was
compounded by the fact that it was at night.''
   A line was used to pull Tjotta, his companion and the crewman
from the boat to the helicopter, Karonis said.

   About 1,500 Czechoslovak activists
took part in a silent march for human rights in downtown Prague on
Monday, sources said.
   The march was organized by the unofficial ``Helsinki Czechoslovak
Committee'' led by Jiri Hajek, a former foreign minister during the
1968 ``Prague Spring'' period of liberalization, according to the
sources, who spoke on condition of anonimity.
   Among the demonstrators was Vaclav Maly, vice-president of the
committee.
   Five other independent organizations called the march last week
after Czechoslovak authorities banned an unofficial meeting
occasioned by a human rights conference in Paris.
   The month-long conference, which opened May 30, is aimed at
reviewing human rights progress by the 35 nations, all signatories
of the 1975 Helsinki Final Act. It has also taken to task nations
accused of specific human rights abuses, including Bulgaria and
Romania.
   Police made identity checks but otherwise did not interfere with
the march, which lasted about a half-hour, the sources said.

<HEAD>Arab Experts Meet On Improving Food For 80 Million Children</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SALAH NASRAWI</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Food experts met Monday to seek ways of
improving nutrition for millions of children in the Arab world and
boost food production to feed the region's rapidly swelling
population.
   The four-day symposium, organized by the Arab Food Industry
Federation and the United Nations Economic and Social Committee for
Western Asia, was opened by Iraqi Industry and Military
Industrialization Minister Hussein Kamel.
   Falah Jaber, head of the Baghdad-based federation, said the
sumposium will try to draw a strategy to integrate Arab food
production and efforts to boost nutrition, particularly for the 80
million children under age 14.
   ``It is of vital importance that Arab children receive good
quality food, rich with nutrition, if we want to increase our birth
rate,'' Jaber said.
   The Arab world is in the grip of a baby boom. The high birth rate
and improved health care systems that have reduced infant mortality
are rapidly swelling populations.
   The Arab world will have a population estimated at 650 million by
the end of the century if current growth rates continue.
   That is becoming a major problem in several countries because
their economies cannot keep pace with the population growth.
   The Arab birth rate is one of the highest in the world. According
to the U.N. Children's Fund, 18.2 million children were born in 1986
in contrast to more than 4 million in the 12 countries of the
European Economic Community.
   The U.N. body also forecast that the Arab world will have an
annual increase in population in 1990-95 of about 3.35 percent.
   Concern about the population growth rate in the Arab world has
stimulated debate about birth control in many Arab countries.
   But Iraq is seeking to increase its birth rate to boost its
population of around 16 million, which is only one-third the size of
neighboring Iran, its foe in an eight-year war.
   Baghdad is giving incentives for bigger families to try to double
the population and meet what it considers the demographic challenge
from Iran.
   The incentives include grants to newly married couples, generous
family allowance payments, 12 months' paid maternity leave for women
followed by six months at half-salary and preferential treatment for
big families in the allocation of state housing.
   Jaber said the Arab world lacked a strategy for its children's
food industry and needed to concentrate on better quality and higher
standards in food products.
   Foreign experts will join the Arab specialists to discuss ways of
helping Arab countries improve nutrition for their childern.

   School officials canceled the all-night
graduation party they planned when they found drugs and alcohol
during a search of buses in the middle of the night.
   School Superintendent Timothy Monahan said the disappointing turn
of events does not mean the program will die.
   ``I am certain that the Class of 1990 will have Celebration
Graduation if they desire,'' he said Monday, but he said more
parents must participate.
   ``The amount of parents over the years has dwindled
considerably,'' he said. ``We need your help and support if the
program is to continue.''
   School and police officials held a news conference Monday to sort
out what led to the decision to call off the celebration and direct
about 400 students to call their parents for a ride home at about 2
a.m. Saturday.
   Police said that 40 to 50 of the 400 students were involved.
   Volunteer coordinators and school officials said they felt
betrayed that students smuggled drugs and alcohol into the
celebration and even smoked pot on a bus.
   ``The more we found out about the situation, the more betrayed we
felt,'' a disappointed project coordinator, Susan Anderson, said.
``It was clear that these students set out to test the program and
violate it.''
   After some chaperones smelled what they suspected was marijuana
being smoked on a bus, police searched all 11 buses and found
marijuana, cocaine, beer and whiskey on three buses.
   The buses were taking students from a pizza parlor to a bowling
alley and movie theater. No one was arrested, though police said
they were continuing interviews this week and might make arrests
later.
   After the discovery, Principal David Matthews canceled the rest
of the activities _ including a dawn breakfast and the awarding of
prizes, including a car _ and ordered all the students back to
school, where parents were called.
   ``I think we made a very clear statement by terminating the
program and we had to do that. We had to be very uncompromising,''
she said.

<HEAD>Commerce Secretary Defends Get-Tough Approach to Opening Foreign
Markets</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARTIN CRUTSINGER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Economics Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Commerce Secretary Robert Mosbacher on Monday
defended the administration's get-tough approach to opening foreign
markets to American products, saying that the effort must be made to
correct huge trade imbalances.
   In an address at the Johns Hopkins Foreign Policy Institute,
Mosbacher called last year's U.S. trade deficit of $120 billion
unacceptable and said more has to be done to reduce the imbalance.
   ``Increasingly, national economic power depends on the ability to
compete effectively in world markets,'' Mosbacher said. ``The growth
of commerce, both nationally and internationally, is the key to
guaranteeing that America's most productive and prosperous days are
still ahead.''
   Mosbacher defended the administration's decision last month to
target Japan, Brazil and India for erecting barriers to sales of
American goods.
   If the countries do not agree to remove the barriers, the
administration has the power under the new trade law to retaliate by
imposing 100 percent tariffs against selected imports from those
countries.
   Other nations have complained that the administration's decision
was high-handed and risked plunging the world into a global trade
war.
   But Mosbacher said that the administration's decision in
targeting the three nations was done ``not in defiance of the ...
multilateral trade system but to expand it by opening foreign
markets.''
   Mosbacher, who was one of the leading proponents of the more
aggressive trade stance within the administration, said that the
United States needed such an effort to whittle down the huge trade
imbalances that currently exist.
   ``We firmly reject any slide toward protectionism,'' Mosbacher
said. ``But there are disturbing trends in the trade picture.
Subsidies, distribution systems, industrial policies and even the
economic structure of some countries have led to a reliance on
exports without a willingness to import.''
   Mosbacher said, however, that he was encouraged by recent talks
he held with officials of the European Economic Community over how
American companies will be treated once a unified European market is
established in 1992.
   He said he had received a commitment that U.S. products will be
treated equally with European products for testing and certification
and the European standard-setting committees will consider the
comments made by American companies before drawing up final
regulations.
   Mosbacher hailed these comments as an ``important step forward''
in an area of major concern to U.S. companies, who had feared that
the standards would be drawn in such a way as to keep American
products off European store shelves.
   ``We believe that (the economic unification of Europe) will be
good for Europe and that it can be a positive force for the United
States and the rest of the world, if implemented in the open manner
being discussed by European leaders,'' he said.

<HEAD>Rafsanjani Heads For Moscow to Boost Links, Seeks Weapons</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ED BLANCHE</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   Iranian Parliament Speaker Hashemi
Rafsanjani flies to Moscow on Tuesday to seek military aid and boost
relations between the Islamic Republic's new leadership and the
Kremlin in the post-Khomeini era.
   During his long-delayed visit, originally scheduled for last
fall, Rafsanjani is expected to sign major long-term economic
agreements that will strengthen Tehran's increasing ties with his
country's northern neighbor and the communist bloc.
   He also is to visit Budapest and Sofia, where he is expected to
finalize 10-year cooperation agreements that will include Hungarian
and Bulgarian aid in developing Iran's arms industry.
   Rafsanjani is the highest-ranking Iranian leader to visit the
Soviet capital.
   The departure of such a key political figure at a time when Iran
is undergoing a transition of power following Ayatollah Ruhollah
Khomeini's death June 3 underlined the importance Tehran attaches to
bolstering relations with Moscow following the August 1988
cease-fire in the war with Iraq.
   The Soviets have been courting the Iranians for several years,
even during the war, when they were Iraq's main arms supplier.
   Western sources said the Soviets quietly provided weapons to Iran
as well, although not in the same quantities.
   ``But Iran, in the long run, is a bigger prize than Iraq, as the
Americans well know,'' said one Western diplomat.
   ``Now that Khomeini's gone, the contest for influence in Iran is
likely to increase. The Soviets and the East bloc are signing
economic agreements that are whittling down Western opportunities,''
he said on condition of anonymity.
   Relations between Moscow and Tehran were strained for years,
particularly after the Iranians cracked down on the pro-Moscow Tudeh
Party in 1981.
   But once the Soviets began moving out of Afghanistan, Iran's
eastern neighbor where it still backs Moslem guerrillas fighting the
Marxist Kabul government, relations warmed quickly.
   Khomeini sealed the new relationship in January by sending Soviet
leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev an unprecedented letter praising his
policies of perestroika and glasnost.
   Gorbachev's reply, carried to Iran by Foreign Minister Eduard
Shevardnadze, said: ``Conditions are ripe for relations between our
countries to enter a qualitiatively new stage of cooperation in all
fields.''
   The Iranians and Soviets have highlighted their expanding
economic cooperation, but they have said little about what Western
sources say are the burgeoning military links between Tehran and the
East bloc.
   The Soviet deputy foreign minister, Yuri Vorontsov, told Iran's
official Islamic Republic News Agency last month after visiting
Tehran: ``There is nothing to limit the cooperation between our two
countries.''
   IRNA quoted him as saying: ``We can effectively help each other
and cooperate to solve important problems ... including the
enhancement of military forces.''
   Tehran's radical Abrar daily said recently: ``There are no major
obstacles in the way of mutual cooperation, especially Soviet
participation in Iran's reconstruction ... Moscow can help Iran in
many technical and scientific fields.''
   Rafsanjani, who is emerging as Iran's strongman following
Khomeini's death, said June 8 he would not be seeking to buy weapons
from Moscow.
   But Western intelligence officials and analysts have reported
that Iran, seeking to rebuild its armed forces after a series of
defeats in the war with Iraq, is desperate to upgrade its depleted
air force and armored forces.
   Western sources said Iran has signed military cooperation
agreements with Czechoslovakia, a major European arms manufacturer,
Romania and Yugoslavia for the purchase of hardware ranging from
armored vehicles to jet fighters.
   Although there has been no official confirmation, Iran's deputy
foreign minister, Ali Mohammad Besharati, told the Tehran Times last
month that Iran soon would buy Soviet weapons and was negotiating
with other countries to buy advanced fighter-bombers.
   He said ``extensive talks'' have been held with Soviet officials,
who have been shuttling in and out of Tehran for months, and that
``all related issues have been finalized.''
   He did not identify the countries with which Iran was
negotiating. But Western military sources believe the bargaining
centers on Yugoslavia and Romania, both visited by Iranian President
Ali Khamenei in April.
   China, a key arms supplier that Khamenei has also visited
recently, also figures prominently in Tehran's efforts to build up
its military.
   A senior U.S. Defense Department source said the Iranians are
``putting a lot of emphasis on rebuilding their military; faster,
actually, than we really expected. They're talking of spending in
the range of $20 billion over the next four to five years.''

   Conservative leader Constantine Mitsotakis
offered Monday to form an interim government with rival leftists for
the sole purpose of cleaning up scandals left by the regime of
Premier Andreas Papandreou.
   Mitsotakis' center-right New Democracy party finished first in
Sunday's elections, defeating Papandreou's Panhellenic Socialist
Movement, but failed to win a majority needed to govern.
   A leftist-communist coalition, which finished third, has emerged
as the likely power broker in the battle to form a coalition
government.
   Both Mitsotakis and Papandreou earlier said they would reject
support from the coalition, but both made conciliatory overtures to
the group after the balloting.
   The possibility remained that Papandreou, despite Sunday's
second-place finish, could return as premier if Mitsotakis cannot
form a government.
   Papandreou met Monday with President Christos Sartzetakis, the
ceremonial head of state, and submitted his resignation. But he was
asked to remain as caretaker premier until a new government was
formed.
   Mitsotakis meets with the president on Tuesday to receive a
three-day exploratory mandate to form a government. If he fails,
Papandreou will receive the same opportunity to build a coalition.
   If neither can form a majority, the president is to appoint a
caretaker government to prepare for new general elections.
   But Mitsotakis, at a news conference, proposed leading an interim
governing coalition that ``would last only a few months'' before new
elections are held.
   ``... The express purpose of this government would be the
punishment of those guilty of the scandal of the century
unprecedented in recent Greek history,'' said Mitsotakis, referring
to a multimillion-dollar banking scandal that plagued Papandreou's
government.
   Mitsotakis said he would be prepared to ``include one or two
representatives'' from the Communist alliance in his interim cabinet.
   Mitsotakis said ``because of political differences with the left
parties, this government will not be able to tackle issues like a
new bases agreement with the United States.''
   A pact that allows the United States to maintain military bases
in Greece expired in December and the nations have been trying to
negotiate a new accord for two years.
   Mitsotakis said the interim government, if it is formed, also
would not be able to deal with a U.S. demand for the extradition of
alleged Palestinian terrorist Mohammed Rashid, wanted for
involvement in the bombing of a Pan Am jetliner over Hawaii in 1982.
   ``The government will have a strictly limited mandate to carry
out the catharsis and cannot face such issues,'' he said.
   In Washington, State Department spokeswoman Margaret Tutwiler
said composition of the eventual Greek government ``is a choice that
the people of Greece must make. Our alliance with Greece is
important.''
   Leaders of the leftist coalition had no comment on Mitsotakis'
offer and were expected to meet to weigh their options.
   Papandreou, beset by financial scandals, a highly publicized
divorce from his American wife and a backlash over an extramarital
affair with a woman half his age, was trying to win a third straight
four-year term in office.
   The premier and ranking members of his party were accused of
involvement in a scandal in which $200 million allegedly was
embezzled by the chairman of the Bank of Crete, George Koskotas.
   Papandreou has rejected Koskotas' charges that he and members of
his socialist administration masterminded the embezzlement. Koskotas
is in a Massachusetts jail awaiting an extradition hearing.
   Members of Papandreou's party met Monday to decide if they would
try to retain power by proposing a coalition with the leftists.
   Papandreou's party dropped from 154 to 125 seats in the
300-member Parliament after Sunday's election. New Democracy
captured 144 seats, seven short of a majority.
   The Coalition of the Left and Progress, an alliance of the
Moscow-oriented Greek Communist Party and the Greek Left Party, took
29 seats and could play power broker.
   Leftist coalition chief Harilaos Florakis said before Mitsotakis
made his offer that the coalition would ``fight against the
conservative policy of New Democracy and any other conservative
policy.''
   Papandreou thanked his supporters on Monday for denying ``an
absolute majority to the forces of conservatism.'' He hinted at a
possible coalition offer, noting that the socialists and the leftist
coalition together would form a majority.
   Papandreou came to power in 1981 on an anti-American platorm and
vowing to pull Greece out of NATO and the EEC. The realities of
ruling altered his positions.
   Mitsotakis, an advocate of supply-side economics and less
government interference, favored closer cooperation with the United
States and Western industrial interests.

   Pete Rose today sued to block Baseball
Commissioner A. Bartlett Giamatti's hearing next week into gambling
allegations against him and asked the court to assign an impartial
decision-maker to weigh the charges.
   Reuven J. Katz, a lawyer for Rose, said the Cincinnati Reds
manager requested a temporary restraining order and an injunction in
Hamilton County Common Pleas Court.
   ``Pete Rose has consistently denied that he has ever bet on the
Cincinnati Reds or on baseball games,'' Katz said in a statement.
   ``The purpose of the lawsuit ... is to ensure that Pete gets a
fair hearing and a fair determination in the proceeding instituted
by the commisioner of baseball against him.''
   On May 9, Giamatti received a 225-page report on the allegations
from an investigator.
   Katz said the commissioner ``already decided that the accusations
against Pete were true before he or his investigators even heard
evidence from Pete Rose.''
   The lawyer said Rose asked the court to impose ``an impartial
decision-maker and fair procedures for judging the accusations of
betting on baseball that have been levied against him.''

   Youths with firebombs and steel rods attacked
people and tried to seize a police station in Kazakhstan, Tass
reported Monday. It was the second Soviet Central Asian republic to
explode in violence in recent weeks.
   Tass said people were killed but did not gave a figure.
   The official news agnecy said the rioting began Friday night in
Novy Uzen, a town in western Kazakhstan about 1,050 miles southeast
of Moscow known for its oil and gas processing plants.
   The newspaper Komsomolskaya Pravda reported Sunday the unrest
began with a fight between two gangs at a discotheque. They
overturned kiosks, smashed windows and doors and set several cars on
fire, the newspaper said.
   The Tass dispatch indicated the disturbances have gone on despite
police attempts to restore order.
   ``Outrageous elements have formed groups, armed with sticks,
steel rods and stones. They are staging pogroms in houses, stores
and administrative buildings and are attacking passers-by in housing
developments and on city streets,'' Tass said.
   The gangs, also using guns and firebombs, tried to seize the
police station, water supply systems and other vital facilities in
the city, the news agency reported. Public transport has been
paralyzed, and some businesses have had to close.
   In neighboring Uzbekistan, rioting targeted at an ethnic
minority, the Meskhi Turks, began in late May, and about 100 people
were killed. On Monday, authorities pledged to create 200,000 jobs,
clean up polluting factories and grow more food in that region to
stem the economic and environmental problems behind the unrest.
   Kazakhstan, where the new unrest flared, was the scene of the
first major outbreak of ethnic violence under President Mikhail S.
Gorbachev. Crowds rioted in December 1986 in the republican capital,
Alma Ata, after the leader of the local Communist Party, an ethnic
Kazakh, was replaced by an ethnic Russian. Two people were killed.
   There was no indication, however, that ethnic factors were behind
the Novy Uzen rioting.
   Komsomolskaya Pravda traced the trouble to economic factors and
``social tension.'' It said the rampaging youths demand an end to
rationing. Because of shortages, rationing has been imposed in many
parts of the Soviet Union on meat, butter and sugar.
   The youths also demanded closure of cooperatives, the private
businesses formed under Gorbachev's economic reforms, the newspaper
said. They believe cooperatives have caused food shortages and
driven up prices, it said.
   The gangs also said workers brought into the region make more
money and are taking jobs that could go to local youths, the
newspaper said.
   Soviet Central Asia, with the highest birthrate in the country,
has a labor surplus and job shortage.
   The Communist Party daily Pravda, quoting an Uzbekistan
government commission report, said food processing plants and sewing
factories would be opened, in administrative buildings if necessary,
to provide 200,000 new jobs in the troubled Fergana Valley by the
end of 1990.
   It said unspecified steps would be taken to end the concentration
on cotton production. Some activists charge that cotton production,
boosted by huge amounts of chemical fertilizers and pesticides, is
poisoning the land and leading to malnutrition in a republic once
known for its fruits and vegetables.
   ``This is very positive, but they had to think about it much
earlier,'' said the leader of the Uzbek grass-roots movement Berlik,
Abdurakhim Pulatov.
   Pulatov, in a telephone interview from Tashkent, the Uzbekistan
capital, said he did not believe 200,000 jobs could be created so
quickly.
   Rioting that broke out in the area pitted ethnic Uzbeks against
the Meskhi minority, which was forcibly resettled to the region from
the southern republic of Georgia by Soviet dictator Josef Stalin in
1944.
   Authorities and residents differ on the reasons for the arson and
murder rampage that prompted the dispatch of 9,000 soldiers and
evacuation of about 16,000 Meskhi Turks.
   Some news reports have blamed Berlik for the violence, but
Pulatov rejected the charge.

   Fourteen Republican senators, including the
ranking GOP member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, questioned the
party loyalty of New York attorney Robert B. Fiske Jr. and urged
President Bush on Monday not to nominate him as deputy attorney
general.
   ``It does not appear that Mr. Fiske shares the basic approach to
matters of legal and judicial policy which you so effectively
articulated in your winning campaign for president,'' the senators
said in a letter to Bush.
   ``We therefore respectfully urge you to reconsider this matter
and select a nominee with a demonstrated commitment to your
principles, and those of the Republican platform, in these important
areas,'' the senators said.
   The letter was signed by Sen. Strom Thurmond, R-S.C., the ranking
GOP member on the Senate Judiciary Committee and 13 other senators.
   It is unclear whether the letter will persuade Bush not to
nominate Fiske. But it signals that Fiske would face tough
questioning from some Republican senators during Senate confirmation
hearings before the Judiciary Committee.
   On Friday, well after the Republicans began circulating the
letter to collect signatures, Bush appeared to endorse Fiske, who
has been recommended by Attorney General Dick Thornburgh.
   At a gathering of federal prosecutors at the White House, Bush
noted that his administration included several former U.S. attorneys
in key positions.
   ``We hope to see yet another _ Bob Fiske of New York _ joining
our ranks here soon,'' the president said without elaboration.
   The 14 mostly conservative senators said they had ``serious
concerns'' about Fiske based on his tenure as chairman of the
American Bar Association's Standing Committee on Federal Judiciary,
according to the June 14 letter that was released Monday.
   The senators contend that during Fiske's chairmanship, the panel
``improperly applied ideological criteria to thwart the nominations
of various well-qualified candidates'' that then-President Reagan
had nominated to the federal bench.
   The senators said Fiske, a pillar of the New York legal
establishment who onced served as U.S. attorney in Manhattan, gave
liberal organizations the names of people under consideration for
judgeships.
   ``Such leaks permitted groups opposed to the president's judicial
philosophy to attack the candidates and prevent their nomination,''
the letter said.
   Fiske and the ABA have acknowledged that two liberal
organizations were given the names of prospective nominees for the
purpose of determining if the candidates had ever shown bias against
women or minorities.
   But the ABA denies that it ever used ideological criteria to
determine a lawyer's professional fitness to serve as a judge.
   The letter also was signed by Sens. Malcolm Wallop, R-Wyo., Kit
Bond, R-Mo.; Dan Coats, R-Ind., Jesse Helms, R-N.C., James McClure,
R-Idaho; Conrad Burns, R-Mont.; Bill Armstrong, R-Colo.; Gordon
Humphrey, R-N.H., Steve Symms, R-Idaho; Charles Grassley, R-Iowa,
Trent Lott, R-Miss.; Connie Mack, R-Fla.; and Thad Cochran, R-Miss.
   A signature noticeably absent from the letter was that of Sen.
Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, who is an outspoken critic of ABA judicial
screening and also is a member of the Judiciary Committee. Hatch
spokesman Paul Smith said the senator decided against signing the
letter after meeting recently with Fiske.
   ``Though he didn't like what Fiske did in the beginning, he still
thought he ought to hear what Fiske had to say'' about his judicial
screening role, Smith said. Hatch ``didn't make a commitment for or
against'' Fiske, Smith said.
   The Justice Department has said Fiske would play no role in
selecting judges for the federal bench if he became the department's
No. 2 official.
   Fiske's contribution of $1,000 to the 1988 Democratic primary
campaign of a U.S. senate candidate in Vermont also reinforced ``our
doubts about Mr. Fiske's commitment to our party's philosophy,'' the
senators said.
   Fiske donated the money to the campaign of William Gray, a former
U.S. attorney in Vermont, with whom he served in the Justice
Department. Gray has been described by Justice Department officials
as an old friend of Fiske.
   Gray lost to then-Rep. Jim Jeffords in last fall's election.

<HEAD>Controversial Fetal-Tissue Transplants Offer Hope in Treating Disease</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LINDSEY TANNNER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Transplants of tissue from human fetuses offer
hope in treating AIDS and other diseases, doctors said Monday, but
they acknowledged the need to resolve ethical questions surrounding
the practice.
   Anti-abortionists have denounced procedures involving the use of
tissue from fetuses obtained through spontaneous or induced
abortions.
   The transplants, mostly brain and glandular tissue, are supported
by the American Medical Association's Council on Scientific Affairs
and its Council on Ethical and Judicial Affairs.
   The councils urged continued federal funding for the transplants
in a joint report discussed Monday during the AMA's annual
policymaking convention.
   The report notes that fetal-tissue transplants have ``led to the
development of a number of important research and medical advances.''
   But Dr. George M. Bohigian, chairman of the science council, and
Dr. Russel H. Patterson Jr., chairman of the judicial group,
acknowledge the ethical dilemmas posed by such research.
   At issue is the possibility that a decision to have an abortion
will be coupled with a decision to donate fetal tissue for
transplantation, they wrote in the report.
   ``The use of fetal tissue for transplantation purposes is
ethically permissable'' when a number of conditions are met, they
wrote. These conditions include:
   _ The recipient of the tissue is not designated by the donor.
   _ A final decision regarding abortion is made before initiating
discussion of the transplantation use of fetal tissue.
   _ Fetal tissue is not provided in exchange for financial
remuneration above that which is necessary to cover reasonable
expenses.
   The authors note that the acquisition and use of tissue obtained
from dead fetuses is governed by the Uniform Anatomical Gift Act,
``which has been adopted by all states and the District of
Columbia.''
   The act permits the donation of fetal tissue for research
purposes with the consent of either parent and without objection
from the other.
   However, several states have restrictive statutes governing the
donation of fetal tissue for research.
   Massachusetts and Michigan laws prohibit abortion if it is
conditional on the use of the fetal tissue for research, the doctors
note.
   And Arizona law bars post-mortem use of fetal remains for ``any
medical experimentation'' if the tissue is derived from an induced
abortion, they note.
   In one recent study involving human fetal tissue, liver cells and
bits of thymus and lymph glands transplanted into mice with impaired
immune systems helped make those systems function properly. The
doctors wrote that the effort ``may become a valuable model in
studying acquired immune deficiency syndrome.''
   Fetal brain tissue transplants also could offer promising
advances in the treatment of diabetes and Parkinson's disease, they
said. Fetal brain cells are still capable of growth, unlike adult
brain cells.
   Transplants using tissue from a fetus after spontaneous or
induced abortion would appear to be analogous to the use of cadaver
tissue and organs, the report said.
   ``The principal ethical concern in the use of human fetal-tissue
transplants is the degree to which the decision to have an abortion
is separated from the decision to donate the post-mortem tissue,''
the doctors wrote.
   ``Safeguards to reduce any motivation, reason, or incentive by
the woman to have an abortion can be developed to allow the benefits
of this procedure to be made available to those who are in need of
improved therapies.''
   The report was submitted Monday to a committee which will decide
whether to offer the recommendations to the AMA's policy-making
House of Delegates.
   Official AMA policies are to be adopted Tuesday, Wednesday and
Thursday, the last day of the five-day meeting.

<HEAD>Coast Guard Commandant: Oil Spill Still May Need More Manpower</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID BRISCOE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Cleanup of Alaskan beaches three months after
the Exxon Valdez oil spill is progressing well, but more manpower
and double shifts still may be needed, Coast Guard Commandant Paul
A. Yost told Congress on Monday.
   ``The beaches are not going to be crystal pure at the end of this
summer,'' said Yost, testifying on the Bush administration's
proposed $3.47 billion Coast Guard budget for fiscal 1990. Yost was
in Alaska inspecting the cleanup earlier this month.
   He told the Senate Commerce, Science and Transportation Committee
that some oil has seeped two to three feet deep into cobble and
gravel along the shore and it could take five to seven years for
Mother Nature to deal with the damage.
   Yost said Exxon is spending $100 million a week on the cleanup.
   ``It's progressing well,'' he said, but added that progress was
slower on beaches outside Prince William Sound.
   The Valdez spilled 10 million gallons of oil after running into a
reef in the sound on March 24. The ship's captain, Joseph Hazelwood,
faces several charges in connection with the spill.
   Yost said Exxon has pledged to clean up enough miles of beach
each week to complete the work by the end of the summer. He said if
the company lags behind the schedule, he would call for additional
manpower and hours.
   Yost said the administration's budget request, except for $244
million to build a new icebreaker, amounts to a 3.6 percent increase
over fiscal 1989 appropriations.
   The icebreaker is needed to increase the U.S. fleet to three,
which still would be two below the number of such ships in the fleet
in 1987.
   ``We cannot carry out the vital missions of this country in the
Arctic and the Antarctic with just two icebreakers,'' he said.
   Yost said he had no objection to a proposal by some members of
Congress to lease, rather than buy, an icebreaker, as long as the
$40 million annual lease payments came from a separate
appropriation. The proposed 30-year lease would put long-term cost
of the ship at $1.2 billion.

<HEAD>US Accuses Nicaragua of Limiting Numbers of Electoral Observers</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The State Department accused Nicaragua on
Monday of attempting to restrict outside monitoring of its electoral
process by imposing visa requirements on American citizens.
   ``If Nicaragua wants to hold elections which will enjoy respect,
both internally and in the international community, it should not be
restricting access but should be expanding it,'' department
spokeswoman Margaret Tutwiler said.
   ``Right now the question of the new visa requirement inevitably
inspires is, `What do you have to hide?'''
   Americans had been exempted in recent years from from visa
requirements as part of a Nicaraguan effort to draw tourists and to
obtain hard currency in other ways.
   Nicaraguan President Daniel Ortega announced the new visa
requirement on Friday, saying the measure was necessary to prevent
the United States from meddling in Nicaraguan internal affairs.
   ``The Yankee have reached the extreme of wanting to direct the
electoral process in Nicaragua. They want to come to do what we
Nicaraguans must do. We can't permit this,'' he said.
   Nicaragua is scheduled to hold presidential elections next
February.

<HEAD>Thousands Still Without Power in South Carolina, Washington After
Storms</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   An estimated 15,000 South Carolinians still
had no electricity Monday, three days after a deadly thunderstorm
ripped through the state's mid-section, officials said.
   In Washington, D.C., where 72,000 customers lost power after a
string of storms last week, about 3,100 residents and businesses
remained in the dark Monday.
   At least 100,000 customers in the greater Columbia area lost
power when a storm packing 78 mph wind struck Friday. One man was
killed when a tree fell on his truck.
   South Carolina Electric &amp; Gas Co. crews worked around the clock
through the weekend to restore service, but some 10,000 to 15,000
customers remained powerless Monday, spokesman Brian Duncan said.
   ``We're making some steady progress, but we're looking at
tomorrow (Tuesday) night before everything's back on,'' Duncan said.
   People without power were coping as best they could, stocking up
on dry ice, using outdoor grills to cook frozen meat before it could
spoil and using battery-operated lamps.
   ``We're about dying here, we've got no air conditioning,'' said
Hugh Munn from his office at the State Law Enforcement Division. ``I
wish you could see my office. There are no windows. We've got two
fans. Doors are open, much as we can; we've got to keep security.''
   At the Bryton Pointe apartment complex in northern Columbia,
residents had placed a steady stream of phone calls to the manager's
office asking when power would be restored, manager Susie Holland
said.
   ``But everyone's been pretty understanding as far as the
apartment complex goes. I don't know how they feel about SCE&amp;G,''
said Ms. Holland, who noted that fallen trees in the parking lot and
the lack of power hadn't hurt business.
   ``We have leased three apartments with no electricity. I don't
know what it is. It must be attractive by candlelight,'' she said.
   The power was restored at Judy Priester's home about noon Monday,
much to the joy of her, her husband, Mel, and their four children,
all under age 7. The lack of power had halted water pumps in their
area.
   ``We all came home and just cheered when we found the lights
worked and the toilets flushed,'' she said.
   Since Friday night, SCE&amp;G had replaced more than 250 utility
poles and 100 miles of wire, said Bill Lide, another SCE&amp;G spokesman.
   He said the cost of the restoration effort probably would not be
tallied for a few weeks, ``but if it doesn't break a million
dollars, I would be surprised.''
   At one point, an estimated 10,000 customers in the Lancaster
area, about 60 miles north of Columbia, also were without power, but
service was restored by Sunday, a spokeswoman for Duke Power Co.
said.
   In Washington, Potomac Electric Power Co. officials said Monday
that about 3,100 customers were still without electricity, down from
a maximum of 172,000 who lost service following last week's series
of powerful thunderstorms.
   About 150,000 customers lost electrical service Wednesday and
22,000 lost power Thursday, according to Pepco, serves the nation's
capital and suburban Maryland. The storm did almost no damage in
suburban Virginia.
   Pepco spokesman Tom Welle said most of the remaining outages were
in northwest Washington and the affluent suburbs of Bethesda and
Chevy Chase, Md.
   ``The storm was so severe that in many cases it uprooted entire
trees and brought them down on power lines,'' Welle said. ``What we
have left on the ground is splinters and a tangle of electrical
wires.''
   According to the National Weather Service, wind speeds of more
than 70 mph were recorded during the height of Wednesday's storm.
   Pepco distributed 450,000 pounds of dry ice to keep food cool,
Welle said.

<HEAD>U.S. Defends Decision to Reject Chile's Request for Extradition</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: Inserts graf 5, bgng ``A State,'' with comment by official</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The State Department on Monday defended its
decision to reject Chile's request for the extradition of Sergio
Buschmann, a Chilean guerrilla leader.
   State Department spokeswoman Margaret Tutwiler said the
administration concluded that the U.S. government did not have the
ability to proceed in obtaining an arrest warrant from a U.S. court
to detain Buschmann based on the Chilean preventive-detention
request.
   ``The offenses for which his preventive detention were sought
were not extraditable under the specific terms of the 1900 treaty,''
she said.
   The spokesman at the Chilean Embassy here was not immediately
available for comment.
   A State Department official, insisting on anonymity, said Chile
wanted Buschmann extradited for illegally importing arms into the
country. The official said U.S. legal experts contended there was no
legal basis for approving the extradition and that Chilean
authorities were very disappointed by the U.S. decision.
   Buschmann, wanted in Chile in connection with an assassination
attempt against President Augusto Pinochet in 1986, was en route
from Australia to Sweden when he was arrested June 12 during a
stopover at Anchorage, Alaska. He was arrested at the request of
Interpol, the international police agency.
   He was released Friday along with a countryman and both were
permitted to leave the United States under escort, officials said.
   Buschmann has been a spokesman for the Manuel Rodriguez Patriotic
Front, Chile's principal leftist guerrilla group. Two years ago, he
escaped from a prison in Chile, where he faced arms-smuggling
charges.
   The Chilean government sought Buschmann's extradition while he
was in Australia. But the Australian government deported him on
grounds he engaged in ``unacceptable activities.'' In Australia, he
was raising funds for the guerrilla group and publicly called for
the assassination of Pinochet.
   The United States has been attempting unsuccessfully for more
than 10 years to obtain the extradition from Chile of three security
officers wanted in the 1976 slaying of Ambassador Orlando Letelier,
an outspoken critic of Chile's military government.

   Roseanne Barr was a little bit bashful as
she appeared in her boyfriend's hometown, joining him on stage and
joking that the two might get married.
   Barr, star of the television runaway hit ``Roseanne,'' was coaxed
onstage to close a show headlined by comedian Tom Arnold, an Ottumwa
native.
   ``It surprised me that she acted a little bashful,'' said
Penelope Boger, one at the Saturday night performance in the lounge
of a hotel.
   ``I think a lot of it had to do being with Tom in front of his
friends and family,'' said audience member Diane Olson. ``I think
she did very well considering that.''
   After two shows at the hotel, Barr and Arnold entertained at the
Wild Side tavern, run by Arnold's sister, Lori Stockdall. ``It was
so packed in here that I was lucky to see her on the stage,'' said
bartender Randy Davis.
   Barr, 36, is legally separated from her husband, Bill Pentland.
As Barr's marriage has unraveled, she and Arnold, 30, have become an
item on the cover of supermarket tabloids.
   The local newspaper, the Ottumwa Courier, said most of Barr's
onstage remarks were ``R-rated.'' In one show, Arnold whispered in
Barr's ear to get her started on a monologue about the different
``cycles'' that women go through ranging from ``Dragon Lady'' to
``martyr.''
   ``Maybe I'll marry Tom so I can keep the material,'' Barr said at
the end of the monologue.
   Arnold has written some of Barr's stand-up comedy material and
now is a scriptwriter for her show.
   For television fans, Ottumwa, population 27,000, has another
claim to fame: It's the hometown of the fictional Radar O'Reilly of
``M-A-S-H.''

   Television stars don't usually like to talk
about scene-stealing and jealousy among the cast members of a TV

with it.
   ``Enough with the dog!'' she said in the June 24 issue of TV
Guide. ``Everyone wants to know about the dog. What is the dog, John
Travolta?''
   The actress said her mother, actress-director Lee Grant, warned
her of the perils of playing opposite dogs and children. She
discovered the truth of that on her first job, in ``Raid on
Entebbe.''
   ``I had a scene where a terrorist is threatening me. I'm carrying
a little dog, and I give the dog to another child, and my line is,
`Take care of him and don't let him get cold or anything,''' she
said.
   Next day, she recalled, the producer said: ```Dinah ... Diiinaaah
... the dog is wonderful.' That's what's happening to me now. `The

   Garry Trudeau, who often spoofs the
ritual of college commencement in his ``Doonesbury'' strip, urged
Stanford University graduates Sunday to challenge cherished
assumptions and ask tough questions.
   ``The impertinent question is the glory and engine of human
inquiry,'' Trudeau told 3,500 graduates and their families at the
university's 98th commencement.
   ``History's movers framed their questions in ways that were
entirely disrespectful of conventional wisdom,'' said Trudeau, 40,
who cited as examples Albert Einstein, Charles Darwin, Thomas
Jefferson and Pablo Picasso.
   America's political system depends on ``its noisy dissent, its
raucaous squabbles, its competing visions of how it should work,''
he added.
   Although Trudeau's talk was generally serious, the Pulitzer
Prize-winning cartoonist on occasion drew laughter from the audience
of 25,000.
   ``The chief function of the graduation speaker has always been to
prevent graduating seniors from being released into the real world
before they've been properly sedated,'' said Trudeau, who apologized
for taking 15 minutes of the students' time.
   ``It will go faster if you think of it as the equivalent of four
videos,'' he added.

   Fans of Jerry Lee Lewis were
disappointed when the veteran rocker suddenly canceled a weekend
appearance at Chattanooga's Riverbend Festival, but not all of them
were surprised.
   ``It makes me feel pretty bad,'' said Grayson Goebel, one of
several thousand people who jammed the banks of the Tennessee River
on Sunday night expecting to see the man known as ``The Killer.''
   ``Of course, mother told me as soon as she heard who the slate of
people was, she said, `Well, Jerry Lee Lewis won't show.' I think he
is a close kin of No Show George (Jones).''
   Lewis, 53, canceled the Sunday night show because of swelling in
a leg that had put him in a hospital earlier in the week, according
to Riverbend officials.
   Lewis ``had an abscess on his leg. And something happened to that
and the doctor recommended he not go on. That's all we know,'' said
Margaret Culpepper, a Riverbend organizer.
   The singer, known for such 1950s rock classics as ``Whole Lotta
Shakin' Goin' On,'' had attended a party Saturday night in Memphis
promoting the new movie about his life, ``Great Balls of Fire.''
   After learning about Lewis, Riverbend officials persuaded country
singer Ronnie McDowell, who was performing at Lake Winnepesaukah in
nearby Fort Oglethorpe, Ga., to replace him.
   ``Somebody called me and said, `Hey, Ronnie, Jerry Lee's not
going to make it,' '' McDowell told the Riverbend crowd. ``And you
know what I said? I said, `What's new?'''
   Later, however, McDowell said he was just kidding. ``I know he's
cried wolf a lot of times, but it's the truth this time.''

   A fire at a chemical plant early Monday
forced the evacuation of up to 200 residents and sent nearly 50
people to the hospital, officials said.
   Investigators found an unexploded Molotov cocktail near Carbolabs
Inc. after the fire, said state police Sgt. Robert Slattery.
   The blaze started around 3:45 a.m., and was brought under control
around 6:30 a.m., but flared briefly an hour later, state police
said. Smoke wafted into the air throughout the morning.
   About 15 people, mostly firefighters, were treated at Yale-New
Haven Hospital for respiratory problems, said hospital spokeswoman
Cathy Zaorski. A volunteer firefighter who lives near the plant was
hospitalized, she said.
   Thirty-four firefighters were taken to the hospital for
precautionary examinations, Zaorski said.
   Authorities had a list of hazardous chemicals stored in the
one-story, aluminum building, and put a disaster plan into effect as
soon as the fire was reported, said Bob Forster, fire inspector in
this town of about 4,620 people.
   ``The pre-planning saved a lot of lives,'' he said.
   Authorities evacuated as many as 200 residents living up to a
half-mile downwind of the plant, said area Red Cross disaster
coordinator Marge Gilbert. Route 63, which runs by Carbolabs, was
closed.
   The road was reopened at 11 a.m. and evacuees were allowed to
return to their homes around noon.
   The blaze destroyed about half the plant, said Deputy Fire Chief
Herbert Howard.
   Carbolabs produces extremely small quantities of chemicals for
research laboratories worldwide, said lab manager Bill Hampp. The
plant has seven full-time employees, Hampp said.
   Symptoms from some chemicals don't appear for up to 72 hours, and
hospital spokeswoman Zaorski urged people living near the plant to
be alert for chest pains, shortness of breath and other effects for
the next couple of days.
   The state Department of Environmental Protection were called in
to direct the clean-up. The federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and
Firearms joined state and local police in investigating the fire.

<HEAD>Jury Convicts `Moochie' Welch In Slaying Of Six</HEAD>
<DATELINE>OAKLAND, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   David ``Moochie'' Welch was convicted
Monday of the 1986 pre-dawn rampage that left his former girlfriend
and five other people dead.
   The Alameda County jury, which got the case a week ago, found
Welch guilty of breaking into the home of 17-year-old Dellane
Mabrey, his former girlfriend and the mother of their young son, and
shooting her to death with an Uzi assault rifle.
   Welch immediately asked that the jury be polled and that the
verdicts be set aside, claiming there had been jury tampering. He
offered no evidence to support the contention. Superior Court Judge
Stanley Golde polled the jurors, then immediately denied the request
to reject their verdict.
   Also killed in the Dec. 8 attack were Sean Orlando Mabrey, 21;
Dwayne Miller, 4; Kathy Walker, 34; Darnell Mabrey, 20; and Valencia
Morgan, 3.
   Welch also was convicted of two counts of attemped murder in the
wounding of the couple's 3-month-old son, Dexter Mabrey, and Leslie
Morgan, 21, Mabrey's current boyfriend and the father of Valencia.
   Welch and a woman companion, Rita Lewis, were arrested later in
the day after a four-hour standoff. Lewis pleaded guilty to six
counts of murder in a deal that hinged on keeping her off death row.
She was sentenced a year after the massacre to 51 years to life in
prison.
   The jury also ruled that special circumstances were involved,
which under the state's death penalty law means they can choose
between the death penalty and life in prison without parole during
the penalty phase of the trial, scheduled to begin June 26.
   Deputy District Attorney James Anderson, who prosecuted the case,
said he would ask for the death penalty.
   Attorney Spencer Strellis, one of two court-appointed lawyers who
helped Welch in his defense, declined to comment.

Social Security advisory council Monday and instructed members to
review financing of the health and long-term care needs of the
elderly and disabled.
   The panel is appointed every four years to examine issues
affecting the Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid programs.
   In announcing the 13 members of the new council, Sullivan
directed that they make recommendations for ``more stable health
care financing'' for the elderly, disabled, poor and uninsured.
   The panel also should review the long-range financial status of
the Social Security program and the role of Social Security in

   Matchmaking is more than a shell game to
this group of love-seeking turtle boosters.
   The Westchester chapter of the California Turtle and Tortoise
Club held its 25th annual show Saturday, drawing more than 500
people _ many of them on the lookout for mates.
   ``I need to find a mate,'' said one owner. ``He paces up and down
in front of the mirror thinking he's got a girl.''
   Rose Bumgard of Lomita said her year-old male turtle was ``sure
active sexually. I feel kind of sorry for him.''
   She explained: ``I found out here that they're 10 to 15 years old
before they can have babies.''
   There are few swinging single turtles available these days, show
delegates said.
   It is illegal to sell many of the creatures in California, so
unless the pets are a gift, the potential tortoise or turtle owner
must go through an adoption agency like the California Turtle and
Tortoise Club.
   The club's waiting list already exceeds two years.
   The show's biggest turtle tribute was displayed by Peggy Nichols,
who has become known as ``The Turtle Lady of Long Beach.''
   Her red sweatsuit was speckled with turtle patches and pins. Her
tables were clustered with turtle jewelry, turtle pictures, turtle
eggs and a dollhouse with live couch potato turtles lounging in
front of a television set.
   ``It's a hobby that just got out of hand,'' said Ms. Nichols, who
calls her home ``Nichols Turtle Haven.''
   She said she owns about 40 breeds of turtles and tortoises _
requiring that she get up at 4 a.m. every day to feed them.
   ``You look at most people here _ they start out with one and then
they get another and then they breed them,'' she said with a shrug.
``I think we all really need a psychiatrist.''

   In just over 36 minutes on Monday, two recent
high school graduates from Washington state assembled a car
distributor, found a fault in the new assembly and fixed it,
repaired a fuel-injector cap, got a faulty headlight to work and
made instrument and dashboard lights work properly.
   For that they picked up a $2,500 scholarship each and a trophy
that marks them as the best high school auto technicians in the
country.
   Mike Seresun, 17, and Walter Yagen, 18, of Ingraham High School
in Seattle beat out 49 other state finalist teams in the 40th annual
trouble-shooting contest, sponsored jointly by the American
Automobile Association and Plymouth. It was the second consecutive
victory for a Washington team.
   They were followed, in order, by teams from Iowa, Pennsylvania,
Texas, Connecticut, Alabama, Missouri, Arkansas, Rhode Island and
Oregon.
   Each team got to the finals by winning a series of local and
national written examinations and hands-on competitions. The written
examinations provided 40 percent of the final score but the real
test was the repair work done in the shadow of the Capitol.
   Fifty brand-new Plymouths, identically bugged, were put before
the teams, along with a work order that listed customer complaints:
``Engine won't start,'' ``faulty headlights,'' ``Check-engine light
on'' and ``inoperative instrument and dash lights.''
   It didn't take the young mechanics long to find that one reason
the engine wouldn't start was because it lacked a distributor. On
request, the teams were handed a distributor disassembled and in a
plastic bag.
   Ah, but there was a rub. One of the parts in the bag, a
distributor pick-up plate, was faulty and the mechanics had to find
and fix that, too. The headlight problem, too, was a trick. The low
beam on the bulb was broken and some of the kids merely replaced it
without checking and finding that a fuse controlling the high beam
was defective, too.
   T.J. Rebert, a trainer for Goodyear's training center and one of
the judges, gave demerits to a Utah team that installed a gasket
improperly. He said the car would run well, but would have trouble
5,000 miles later when moisture got into places it shouldn't.
   In fact, he said, pointing to the last car still under repair, if
that car wasn't fixed at all the mechanics would come out ahead of
the ones who put that gasket in wrong because it's better to tell
customers that the car isn't ready than to send them on the road
with one that will break down.

<TEXT>
   Syrian and Christian troops battled with
tanks and mortars in hills above Beirut Monday while Syrian
artillerymen shelled the coastline of the Christian enclave north of
the capital.
   A police spokesman said no casualties were reported.
   At least 373 people have been killed and 1,450 wounded since the
Syrians and Christians began shelling duels March 8.
   Both sides have ignored a cease-fire called by the Arab League
three weeks ago to end the latest round in the 14-year-old civil war
between Moslem and Christian forces.
   A communique from Christian army commander Gen. Michel Aoun's
office accused the Syrian army of firing at a Christian garrison in
the hilltop town of Souk el-Gharb, southeast of Beirut, with tanks
and 130mm mortars.
   ``Our garrison struck back with similar weapons at the sources of
fire around Souk el-Gharb,'' the communique said.
   It said the Syrians also fired artillery barrages at the
presidential palace in suburban Baabda, where Aoun lives in an
underground bunker, but there were no direct hits.
   Souk el-Gharb, an abandoned mountain resort, is atop a network of
roads leading from the Syrian-controlled Druse heartland in the
Chouf region southeast of Beirut to Christian zones north and
northeast of the capital.
   Beirut newspapers have reported the possibility of a Syrian
offensive to capture Souk el-Gharb and open the way for an attack on
Baabda if Arab League efforts to stabilize the cease-fire fail.
   In Damascus, the Syrian capital, Vice President Abdul-Halim
Khaddam told the opening session of an Arab lawyers' congress that
Syria supports efforts by a three-member Arab League committee to
end the civil war within six months.
   Leaders of the committeee, formed during last month's Arab League
summit in Casablanca, are King Hassan II of Morocco, King Fahd of
Saudi Arabia and Algerian President Chadli Bendjedid.
   ``The system in Lebanon must be changed, sectarianism must fall,
and reforms are needed so that all citizens become equal,'' Khaddam
told the lawyers.
   He was referring to Moslem demands for an equal share of power
that would end the Christians' traditional supremacy in Lebanon.
   Aoun belongs to the Maronite Catholic church, and Maronite
leaders have dominated the country since independence from France in
1943 when Christians were considered the majority. Moslems now make
up an estimated 55 percent of Lebanon's multi-faith population.
   Khaddam also indirectly attacked Iraq, Syria's main Arab foe, for
backing Aoun's mostly Christian troops.
   ``Those encouraging the small minority who is dealing with Israel
should know that the Lebanese people have already defeated Israel
altogether,'' he said.
   Iraq has declared its support of Aoun's ``war of liberation''
against 40,000 Syrian troops in Lebanon under a 1976 Arab League
peacekeeping mandate.
   Police said Monday's coastal bombardment came from Syrian
positions in and around Moslem West Beirut and was aimed at the
Christian ports of Jounieh, Byblos and Amsheet.
   The shelling has preventing ships carrying food, fuel and arms
from reaching the Christian enclave, where Aoun's 20,000 troopers
are based.
   The latest round of fighting began two days after Aoun's units
blockaded ports run by Syrian-backed militias south of Beirut. Aoun
said the ports were illegal and denied the state treasury about $100
million annually in customs fees.
   The Syrians retaliated by blockading the Christian enclave where
an estimated 1 million people live.

   Housing Secretary Jack Kemp told the
nation's mayors Wednesday that the scandals at his department won't
affect his pledge to fight poverty and bring opportunity to blighted
inner cities.
   ``I want to assure you that I am going to work continuously for
these great goals, and we're going to reform the U.S. housing ...
agency from stem to stern, simultaneously,'' Kemp said. ``That's my
pledge to you.''
   Kemp, secretary of Housing and Urban Development, appeared before
more than 200 of the nation's city leaders gathered for the annual
U.S. Conference of Mayors meeting.
   He repeated his pledge to clean up his department, which has been
beset by allegations of fraud, embezzlement and political influence
peddling. Kemp described his department as engulfed by headlines and
said he had taken steps to remove politics from decisions on where
federal urban aid will go.
   ``Democrats and Republicans need to read my lips _ It's open to
everybody on the basis of need, as opposed to greed, as it existed
in the past,'' Kemp said.
   Speaking to reporters later, Kemp refused to comment on whether
his predecessor, Samuel Pierce, who served as HUD secretary
throughout the Reagan administration, was responsible for the
problems at the department.
   ``I'm not going to make a political judgment about any past
secretary because I think it's unseemly of me,'' Kemp said.
   Kemp said reform of the agency would be added to his goals of
encouraging home ownership and resident management of public
housing, moving aginst homelessness, fighting drugs in housing
projects, and using urban enterprise zones to create jobs in cities.
   Kemp followed Republican National Chairman Lee Atwater, who
delivered a partisan pledge to push GOP candidates for mayor,
particularly in New York, and to recruit blacks as candidates for
city offices.
   ``If we can establish a political beachhead in a city like New
York, that's going to be a shot heard around the country,'' Atwater
said, referring to the race against Democratic Mayor Edward Koch.
   Atwater's remarks stirred strong reaction among some in the
overwhelmingly Democratic crowd of mayors.
   Philadelphia Mayor Wilson Goode, a black and a Democrat, called
Atwater's remarks ``insulting'' and said: ``We're not here for a
partisan campaign speech. We need to hear what the Republican Party
intends to do about the issues facing the cities.''
   Atwater said the Republican Party is ``not opposed to spending
more money on the cities. We just want to be careful to spend
taxpayers' money on projects that work.'' He offered no further
specifics.
   New Orleans Mayor Sidney Barthelemy questioned Atwater's remarks,
noting that they were delivered in a hotel and convention center
financed in part with federal Urban Development Action Grants _ a
program that the Reagan administration succeeded in having killed.
   ``I don't understand which programs he's talking about because
the ones that worked, they killed,'' Barthelemy said in an interview.
   Atwater singled out for introduction one black Republican mayor,
James A. Garner of Hempstead, N.Y. _ but mistakenly first said
Garner was from Schenectady, N.Y.
   Garner said later he was not embarrased by the gaffe. ``Chairman
Atwater knows my name and who I am,'' he said.
   Trenton, N.J., Mayor Arthur Holland later quipped: ``I think Lee
Atwater assumed that we had arranged a recruitment opportunity for
him.''
   Holland, who is retiring after 26 years as mayor because of
illness and is stepping down as president of the U.S. Conference of
Mayors, was given the conference's distinquished public service
award.
   President Bush's absence from the meeting has been a subject of
debate among mayors, and Kemp pledged to do all he could to get Bush
to the mayors' next meeting in January.

   Solidarity captured eight of nine seats
open to the opposition in runoff national elections, and voters
rejected several prominent Communists, according to unofficial
returns Monday.
   Progressive Communists beat hard-liners in several races Sunday,
further shattering the ruling party's prestige after the independent
union movement's victories in the first round of voting June 4.
   ``The party is faced with the most serious problems in its whole
history,'' Politburo member Leszek Miller said in an interview
Monday with the Communist Party newspaper Trybuna Ludu.
   ``The post-election shock has brought about a need for a deep
analysis of the situation,'' he said.
   Sunday's elections were for Communists and allies who failed to
win the 50 percent of votes necessary to claim seats reserved for
them in the June 4 elections.
   Of 295 seats being decided in the Sejm, or lower house of
parliament, only one was open to the opposition.
   Eight undecided Senate seats, all open to the opposition, also
were contested Sunday. Solidarity won seven of the seats in the
freely elected Senate, building its dominance in the new chamber to
99 of 100 seats.
   Only the victory of rich fodder farmer Henryk Stoklosa denied
Solidarity a clean sweep in the Senate. Stoklosa waged Poland's most
expensive election campaign, plastering his province with
advertisements and hosting picnics with free beer and sausages.
   Solidarity Union clinched the last of 161 Sejm seats available to
independent candidates, according to results provided by local
election commissions to local Solidarity Citizens' Committees.
   Andrzej Wybranski, the lone Solidarity candidate for the Sejm who
did not win June 4, appeared sure of victory.
   The Senate has veto power over laws passed in the Sejm. But
because Solidarity won all seats alloted it in the Sejm, that body
will be unable to generate the two-thirds majority needed to
override a Senate veto.
   Several Communist hard-liners, including Warsaw party leader
Janusz Kubasiewicz, Manfred Gorywoda of the southern industrial
region of Katowice, and Construction Minister Bogumil Ferensztajn,
failed to win Sunday.
   Top party activist Hieronim Kubiak lost in Krakow to a
little-known Communist ally, as did Politburo member Wiktor Pyrkocz
in the central industrial city of Lodz.
   But two party reformers won, state television reported. They are
Politburo member Marian Orzechowski and Ireneusz Sekula, deputy
prime minister in Katowice.
   Some Communist-allied candidates backed by Solidarity committees
did well, including new Sejm legislators Tadeusz Fiszbach, a former
Gdansk party leader who signed the 1980 agreements that first
legalized Solidarity; and Andrzej Bratkowski, brother of a prominent
opposition journalist. Solidarity tried to build its power by
endorsing the most reform-oriented Communist allies.
   In Warsaw, however, only nine of 18 Solidarity-supported
Communist coalition candidates won, Warsaw television reported.
   The National Election Commission said it will publish official
results Tuesday afternoon, PAP state news agency reported.
   Under a pre-election deal between Communist authorities and
Solidarity, the Senate was entirely freely elected. Only 35 percent,
or 161 seats, in the 460-seat Sejm were open to opposition
candidates.
   The new Sejm consists of 299 Communists and their allies,
including an unknown number sympathetic to Solidarity, plus 161
Solidarity-backed deputies. The State Election Commission estimates
only 25.31 percent of eligible voters turned out Sunday for a
postwar low. Turnout was higher only in the six provinces with
Solidarity candidates.
   Lowest previous turnout was 56 percent for June 1988 provincial
council voting, but there have not been nationwide runoffs before.
Turnout was 62 percent for the June 4 parliamentary voting that was
the freest in Eastern Europe since World War II.
   Empty polling stations around the country indicated many voters
considered the second round unnecessary because they made their
views about Communist rule and the staggering economy known June 4.
   The government took another unpopular move Monday, announcing
sugar prices are increasing from 11 cents to 19 cents a pound
starting Tuesday, state television reported. The price increase
comes as Poles prepare for their traditional annual jam and fruit
preserving.
   The elections are among the political, economic and union
freedoms negotiated during two months of unprecedented talks between
the Communist government and the opposition.
   Solidarity, the first independent union in the Soviet bloc, was
outlawed in 1982 and relegalized in April.

<HEAD>FAA Personnel at Difficult Airports to Get More Pay</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By HERBERT G. McCANN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>DES PLAINES, Ill. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The FAA is giving pay hikes of up to 20
percent at the busiest airports and traffic control centers to
encourage employees to work there, U.S. Transportation Secretary
Samuel Skinner said Monday.
   The program, which took effect Sunday, gives raises to about
2,100 workers at 11 Federal Aviation Administration centers in the
New York, Chicago, Los Angeles and Oakland, Calif., areas.
   The agency has had difficulty staffing those facilities with
qualified personnel because living costs, complex operations and
other factors make them unattractive places to work, FAA officials
said.
   The 5-year demonstration program will become permanent if it
succeeds, and air traffic controllers in the busiest centers will be
some of the highest paid people in federal government, Skinner said
at a news conference near the nation's busiest airport, O'Hare
International.
   A top-level air traffic controller makes $60,000 to $65,000 a
year, including overtime, before the raises, he said.
   ``I've been to those centers and frankly I think those jobs
deserve that kind of compensation,'' Skinner said.
   In addition to controllers, safety inspectors and technicians who
service and maintain air traffic-control computers and other
equipment are getting raises.
   The program will cost about $5 million a year, with the funds
coming out of the department's budget and resulting in minor
cutbacks in other programs, Transportation Department officials said.
   The program is a start in solving some of the problems in the air
traffic system, said Tony Dresden, a spokesman for the National Air
Traffic Controller Association.
   ``It will address short-term problems,'' Dresden said. ``We would
hope that the FAA would look at fair compensation for all
controllers.''
   He said union representatives at facilities affected by the
program indicate it is already working. The FAA has received a lot
of applications since the program was announced in March, and those
applying are highly skilled.
   NATCA was certified as the representative of the nation's 7,000
air traffic controllers in 1987, replacing the Professional Air
Traffic Controllers Organization, which was decertified in 1981
after a nationwide controllers' strike.
   The pay-raise program survived attempts by Congress to restrict
it to FAA workers at O'Hare and to limit raises to up to 10 percent
of base pay, department officials said.
   In addition to being short of help in New York, Chicago and Los
Angeles, many of those working at the affected facilities are
nearing retirement, Skinner said.
   The secretary also used the news conference to blast the airlines
and local governments for not adequately planning for a doubling of
air traffic in the past eight years.
   While the federal government also can be blamed for air traffic
conditions, he said it was up to the airlines to come up with
schedules that take into account airport capacities and to develop
new facilities.
   The FAA facilities affected by the incentive plans include air
traffic control centers in Aurora, Ill., and Ronkonkoma, N.Y.; and
the O'Hare and Los Angeles international airport towers and terminal
radar approach control facilities.
   The program also covers approach-control facilities at Westbury,
N.Y., Santa Ana and Oakland, Calif.; and flight standards district
offices in Los Angeles; Farmingdale and Valley Stream, N.Y.; and
Teterboro, N.J.

   The Navy in a letter released Monday pulled
back from a critical assessment of a cruise-missile engine agreement
with Williams International, saying the deal has resulted in lower
prices.
   In 1978, Williams, of Walled Lake, Mich., signed an agreement
that would allow a competitor, Teledyne Industries Inc., to use
Williams' technology to build cruise-missile engines for the Navy.
In return, the Navy guaranteed it would buy 240 engines a year from
Williams, plus 25 percent of any additional purchases up to 1,200
engines annually.
   The Navy intends to cancel the agreement, on grounds that it
commits the service to future contracts in a way inconsistent with
procurement laws.
   ``For each of the past 10 years, Williams has submitted
competitive prices well below those of its competitor for production
engines,'' Navy Secretary H. Lawrence Garrett III wrote last week in
a letter to Sen. Carl Levin, D-Mich. ``We do believe that the fact
of competition has benefited the taxpayer by creating an added
incentive to lower prices.''
   The letter represented a sharp departure from a letter Garrett,
then undersecretary of the Navy, wrote to Levin in April.
   Then Garrett said the agreement with Williams was ``severely
limiting our contracting options and decision, in a manner which we
believe inconsistent with sound procurement policy and the public
interest.''
   In the April letter Garrett also said Teledyne's prices had
become ``very competitive'' with Williams beginning last year.
   The April letter was leaked by a whistle-blower group called the
Project on Military Procurement. Levin released last week's letter.
   Garrett said the Navy still intends to cancel the 1978 agreement,
but said that intention ``in no way implies criticism of Williams
International's integrity or performance.''
   ``We appreciate the emphasis on ethics that has always been part
of Williams International's management, and we consider it an
outstanding Navy contractor,'' Garrett wrote. Williams has exceeded
its reliability goals and delivered every engine ahead of the
contract date.
   The Associated Press sought an explanation from the Navy of the
differences in the two letters. Lt. Bruce Cole, a Navy spokesman,
said Monday he couldn't comment until he had looked into the matter.
   ``There are some real differences there,'' Levin said of the two
letters. ``Maybe he recognizes that his first letter was really not
the most accurate reflection of the situation.''
   ``I haven't talked to them, nor has my staff,'' Levin said.

<HEAD>Ortega Asks Cardinal To Petition Bush For U.S.-Nicaragua Talks</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DORALISA PILARTE</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>MANAGUA, Nicaragua (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Daniel Ortega asked the
archbishop of Managua on Monday to petition President Bush for talks
aimed at normalizing U.S.-Nicaraguan relations.
   Ortega diclosed this after a 1{-hour meeting with Cardinal Miguel
Obando y Bravo at the archbishop's offices.
   The development comes after Ortega's leftist Sandinista
government has had to deal with two strikes in the last three weeks
and after it made last week the most drastic devaluation of the
Nicaraguan currency so far this year.
   Obando y Bravo said in a brief statement that regarding Ortega's
request, ``we are going to think about this and will give an
answer.'' He did not say when an answer would come and declined to
talk further with reporters.
   Ortega said, ``We came to talk about the critical economic
situation in which the country dwells.''
   With Obando by his side, the president said he told the
archbishop he is ``worried about the lack of understanding from
economic sectors'' regarding the government's program and about the
ensuing ``polarization'' of society here.
   ``Also the role the Americans could play is important,'' Ortega
said.
   He said U.S. policy toward Nicaragua ``does not contribute to the
strengthening of a climate of peace in Nicaragua.''
   The United States cut off all financial aid to Nicaragua in 1981
and began supporting the anti-Sandinista rebels known as Contras. It
accused Nicaragua of backing rebels elsewhere in Central America and
of failing to fulfill its pledges of democracy.
   Ortega noted with appreciation on Monday the letter sent this
year to the United States by about 800 Latin American bishops,
asking that Washington lift the economic embargo imposed on
Nicaragua in 1985.
   ``We are willing to develop a dialogue with the North American
government so foundations can be laid for normalizing relations
between Nicaragua and the United States,'' Ortega said.
   ``I have asked Cardinal Obando y Bravo to ... take steps and
mediate with President Bush so that a fluid dialogue can develop.''
   Ortega declined to answer reporters' questions.
   The last U.S.-Nicaraguan meeting on normalization was in June
1984 in Manzanillo, Mexico. Washington declared an economic embargo
on Nicaragua in 1985, forbidding any U.S. enterprise from doing
business with the small Central American country.
   Nicaragua announced Friday that for the first time, Americans
will need visas to enter Nicaragua starting July 1.
   The State Department accused Nicaragua on Monday of trying to
restrict outside monitoring of its electoral process with the visa
requirements.
   Nicaragua is to hold presidential elections next February.
   On May 26, Nicaragua expelled two U.S. diplomats, accusing them
of inciting labor unrest to undermine the country. The action came
during wildcat strikes by teachers demanding higher pay and improved
working conditions.
   Prices for nearly all goods doubled after the cordoba was
devalued on June 12 for the 20th time this year, coupled with a 110
percent rise in the price of gasoline. That made the official
exchange rate 20,000 cordobas to the dollar instead of 9,500. Gas
rose from 17,700 cordobas a gallon to 37,200, or $1.86.
   Taxi drivers struck, saying they could not survive with the new
gas prices. Some returned to work after progress was made on a
compromise over the weekend.
   Ortega toured 10 European countries in April and May seeking $250
million in aid just for this year. He returned with $50 million.
   On Jan. 30, he announced austerity measures aimed at combating
hyperinflation, which surpassed 20,000 percent in 1988. Measures
included massive layoffs of public employees, slashing new credit
and investment, and pay freezes.
   According to government figures, the fight against inflation was
succeeding, but the measures also created a recession just at the
start of the planting season _ a factor of prime importance for a
country that derives most of its hard-currency earnings from
agricultural exports.

   Four student interns from Arkansas, working for
Sen. David Pryor, learned that it's not easy to apply for a federal
government job.
   One intern, John David Walt of Dumas, had an information window
shut in his face. Libby Schnipper of Hot Springs had her employment
questions rebuffed by a secretary, who insisted everything was on
the application form.
   Mary McLoed of Little Rock was told by a federal worker that her
application may never surface on a government computer and that
obtaining an interview would be difficult.
   ``When I asked him how he got his job he smiled and said, ``I'm
lucky. I know people,'' McLeod told a congressional hearing Monday.
   Walt, Schnipper, McLoed and a fourth intern, Rebecca Slaven of
Little Rock, told their experiences to the House Governmental
Affairs civil service subcommittee, headed by Pryor, D-Ark.
   ``Nothing can be more discouraging and frustrating to a young job
seeker than finding no one able or willing to answer questions about
federal job opportunities and the application process,'' Pryor said.
   Walt, who plans to attend the University of Arkansas Law School
in the fall, said he visited the Office of Personnel Management, the
government's personnel agency, to get information about federal jobs.
   He said he got in line about 2:30 p.m., and minutes later, the
woman at the information desk announced the man in front of him
would be the last to be helped.
   ``When I reached the desk, the woman pulled the partition,'' he
said. ``Two other men were desperately trying to request a form. She
ignored them too.''
   Schnipper, a senior at the University of Arkansas, was given two
job application forms and a job description.
   ``I started asking questions about the job and application
process,'' she said, and was interupted by a federal worker who
said, ``All the answers are on the green form.
   ``I tried one more time to ask a question and she took the green
form out of my hand and said, `I don't know any more than what is on
the form.''
   McLeod, a senior at the University of the Ozarks, originally was
told by a federal worker she would ``possibly never'' hear about her
application because she wasn't applying for a specific position.
   ``I then asked for an application for some sort of clerical
work,'' she said. ``He gave me another form. ... He told me that it
would still be difficult to get an interview.''
   Slaven, a senior at Vanderbilt University, said she had to reach
four different people in order to get job information. The employee
she finally reached told her to ``Be quiet and quit interrupting,''
and referred her to the Office of Personnel Management.

<HEAD>Communist Rebel Charged with Murder in Killing of U.S. Colonel</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A man who said he was a member of an
elite communist assassination team was charged Monday with murder in
the killing of U.S. Army Col. James ``Nick'' Rowe.
   Rowe was slain by gunmen on April 21 as he was en route to his
office at the Joint U.S. Military Assistance Group in suburban
Quezon City.
   Charges of murder and attempted murder were filed against Donato
Continente, 27, an employee at the University of the Phlippines.
Continente was arrested Friday at the university.
   Continente was presented at a news conference Monday. He said he
was a member of a five-man team of communist rebels assigned to kill
Rowe, and the group had kept the colonel under surveillance since
late January.
   But Continente insisted he did not kill Rowe of McAllen, Texas, a
decorated veteran of the Vietnam War. Rowe's Filipino driver was
wounded in the attack.
   Charges have been filed against six other suspects, but they
remain at large.
   The communists' New People's Army asserted responsibility for
Rowe's death. The guerrilla group has said it will continue to
attack American military personnel because of U.S. support for
President Corazon Aquino's counterinsurgency campaign.
   The charges against Continente were filed with the Quezon City
prosecutor, who will determine if there is sufficient evidence to
obtain an indictment.
   Continente was employed in the business department of the
Philippine Collegian, the student newspaper of the state university.
   Friends of Continente said he was seized on the university campus
Friday by armed men who drove him away in a car.
   On Sunday, Defense Secretary Fidel Ramos ordered the military to
investigate the incident and ``effect the safe recovery (of
Continente) and apprehend the perpetrators.''
   But police Col. Victor Tiangco said early Monday that Continente
had been arrested by agents of the military's Criminal Investigation
Service.
   At the news conference Continente said he joined the communist
rebels in 1985 and was a member of the political assassination team
of the Alex Boncayao Brigade, the Manila wing of the New People's
Army.
   He described the assassination team as an ``experimental unit''
organized in October to target diplomats and foreigners involved in
the counterinsurgency campaign.
   ``My role had been in surveillance, but I did not have any
knowledge of the actual killing (of Rowe),'' Continente said.
   Rowe's killing was the second attack by the rebels on U.S.
personnel since Mrs. Aquino took office three years ago.
   In October 1987, rebels killed three Americans and a Filipino
civilian in coordinated ambushes outside the U.S.-run Clark Air Base
north of Manila.
   On Saturday, rebels in central Luzon renewed warnings that they
will attack American personnel stationed at the six U.S. military
bases in the Philippines.

   The Afghan government captured an
American free-lance photographer while he was traveling with Moslem
guerrillas, resistance sources said Monday.
   Guerrillas sources identified him as Tony O'Brien, 42, a
photographer from Santa Fe, N.M., on assignment for Time-Life Inc.
He had been covering the Afghan war based in the Pakistani frontier
city of Peshawar.
   The Afghan government did not confirm the arrest immediately.
   U.S. Embassy officials in Pakistan cited the U.S. Privacy Act and
said they could neither confirm nor deny O'Brien's capture.
   O'Brien was captured Wednesday in Kabul, the Afghan capital,
guerrilla sources in Pakistan said on condition of anonymity. He is
being held in Kabul and is reported in good condition, the sources
said.
   At least three Western correspondents and two foreign aid workers
have been captured while traveling with the guerrillas. All were
released unharmed later.
   O`Brien is the first American believed captured by Afghans.
   The rebels, who call themselves Islamic ``holy warriors,'' have
been fighting the Soviet-backed Kabul government for 11 years with
help mainly from the United States and Pakistan.
   The Soviet Union ended nine years military involvement in the war
on Feb. 15 but continues to arm President Najibullah's government.
   O'Brien had made several forays into Afghanistan with the
guerrillas. His photographs have appeared in major U.S.
publications, including The New York Times and Time magazine.

   Soldiers and police
fired bullets and tear gas to disperse protesters Monday at the
start of a two-day general strike for higher wages and better
services.
   Two youths were wounded by gunfire, but the circumstances of the
shootings were unclear, police said. They said they arrested at
least 50 people.
   President Joaquin Balaguer met with Roman Catholic Church
officials trying to mediate with strikers. Neither side commented
afterwards.
   Most stores were closed, and bus services halted, leaving the
streets of the usually bustling capital of 1.6 million people nearly
deserted.
   Banks and government offices were open under police and military
guard, but most government employees stayed home to support the
unions and student, professional and neighborhood groups that called
the strike.
   Protesters in poor northwestern neighborhoods of Santo Domingo
set ablaze a truck and fruit stand, and threw up barricades of
burning tires and debris.
   Security forces said they fired tear gas to break up gangs of
protesters roving the city.
   The 48-hour strike was called to press the government over rising
costs and deteriorating living conditions in this impoverished
Caribbean nation of 6.5 million people.
   Annual inflation is running at 60 percent, and the country is
plagued by electrical blackouts and water shortages.
   The protesters are demanding better services, price stabilization
and a doubling of salaries of government workers who earn an average
$68 a month.

   Actor William Hurt testified Monday he never told
his former live-in lover, the mother of his son, that he considered
her his wife, but she contended that he told her they had ``a
spiritual marriage.''
   Hurt, 39, said he told Sandra Jennings after they started living
together in 1981 that he was put off marriage by ``the pain of it
not working out with Mary Beth'' _ his wife, actress Mary Beth Hurt,
who divorced him.
   Jennings, 32, a former ballerina with the New York City Ballet,
contends a common-law marriage exists between her and Hurt because
of their three-year relationship. She is trying to ``divorce'' him
and get half of everything he has earned since Dec. 9, 1982, when he
learned his divorce from Ms. Hurt was final.
   In March, Hurt married Heidi Henderson, daughter of bandleader
Skitch Henderson. Jennings' lawyer, A. Richard Golub, claims that
made Hurt a bigamist.
   Jennings, who left Hurt in 1984, is basing her claim on the four
weeks she lived with the actor in Beaufort, S.C., from Dec. 9, 1982,
to Jan. 10, 1983, while he was filming ``The Big Chill.'' South
Carolina recognizes common-law marriages, while New York, where they
lived most of the time, does not.
   Hurt, whom Jennings' lawyer estimates is worth about $itual marriage,''
Jennings said when
the trial broke for lunch. ``he told me we were married in the eyes
of God.''
   She said Hurt told her he considered their type of union more
sacrosanct than a legal union, and that he introduced her to others
as his wife.
   Jennings said she gave birth to Alexander Devon Hurt, now 6,
because she thought her relationship with Hurt was permanent. Hurt
has been paying $65,000 a year in child support, his publicist says.
   In court papers, Jennings said she left Hurt because he was
physically and verbally abusive. She claimed he once slapped her
while she held their then-5-day-old son. On another occasion, after
a drinking binge, she says, he urinated on their couch.
   ``He threw things at me, spit at me and tried to strangle me
once,'' she said during the lunch break.
   Under questioning, Hurt insisted he never referred to Jennings as
Mrs. Hurt and never called her his wife.
   Golub produced a medical form from Hurt's union that the actor
acknowledged was filled out in his handwriting. On it, he had
checked the box which designated Jennings as his spouse.
   On the line which said ``marital status,'' Hurt had written
``mated.'' The actor defined mated as ``two members of the same
species and their progeny.''
   Hurt, however, said the issue of common-law marriage ``never
entered my mind.''

   Sudan's former president, Gaafar Nimeiri, on
Monday denied claims by the Sudanese government that his supporters
in Khartoum planned a coup but were foiled by the army. Sudan said
it arrested 66 people in the plot.
   Sudanese Prime Minister Sadek Mahdi told Parliament in Khartoum
on Monday that the plot was aimed at ``manslaughter in Parliament''
and at ``uprooting the democratic system in Sudan and serving the
strategies of other countries.''
   Mahdi did not identify the countries but assailed ``the feverish
activities of the bloodthirsty Nimeiri in Egypt.''
   Nimeiri said from his exile home in Cairo that the conspiracy
story was invented to divert the Sudanese people's attention from
their problems.
   Sudan's military command said Sunday that soldiers and civilians
loyal to Nimeiri were arrested after the plot was discovered. It
implied but did not say their aim was to restore power to the former
military ruler ousted on April 6, 1985.
   Mahdi said his government ``will promptly and harshly deal with
this coup attempt ... whatever be the price.''
   His security adviser, Abdel Rahman Faraha, said 18 military men
and 48 civilians were arrested in connection with the plot.
   Sudanese newspapers said earlier Monday that 14 army officers,
including six brigadiers and two colonels, and 48 civilians were
arrested. One newspaper, Al-Sudani, said a lieutenant general headed
the plotters and remained at large.
   Editor Sidahmed Khalifa reportedly was arrested. His newspaper,
Al-Watan, recently published an interview with Nimeiri and said
Nimeiri would return in two weeks.
   Newspapers quoted security sources as saying the plotters planned
to strike Monday as Mahdi addressed Parliament. They said the plan
was to surround the assembly building with demonstrators, then
arrest senior government officials trapped inside.
   Nimeiri scoffed at the reports.
   ``This is a poor plan by the government, which is trying to
divert the masses from their suffering,'' he said in an interview.
``The government is trying to increase prices again, and they want
to divert the people's attention.''
   Nimeiri said he was told Sudan's Interior Ministry for weeks
compiled lists of his supporters, intending to arrest them on
charges of trying to overthrow the government.
   ``They are always arresting people I knew,'' he said. ``Six
months ago, they arrested a southern man who used to help my former
chef. They also detained a former butler, and five or six distantly
related relatives of mine.''
   Nimeiri ruled Sudan in a mostly pro-Western military dictatorship
for 16 years. He contends he enjoys widespread civilian and military
support at home, although none is evident.
   ``The masses are calling for the return of Nimeiri ... because
they know maybe I can help them,'' he said.
   But ``I am not trying to overthrow the government,'' he said.
   Nevertheless, Nimeiri said this month that he sent tapes and
copies of speeches to Sudan in May urging the Sudanese to overthrow
Mahdi's civilian administration, which he called a ``government of
thieves.''
   Sudan's economy is in a shambles because of a $13 billion foreign
debt and southern civil war costing $1 million a day.
   Many small demonstrations protesting inflation and commodity
shortages have occurred in recent days, including Sunday before the
coup plot announcement.
   Demonstrators on Sunday urged a return to military rule unless
supplies of bread and sugar are increased.

<DATELINE>SEATTLE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A dozen Boeing 737-400 jetliners operated by
British airlines remained grounded Monday while investigators
studied what caused some of their engines to crack.
   ``We are waiting to see what investigators find out at the
factory,'' Anne Noonan, spokesman for Britain's Civil Aviation
Authority, told The Seattle Times in a telephone interview from
England.
   The engines are manufactured by CFM International, a joint
venture of America's General Electric and Snecma, of France. Two of
the CFM56-3C engines were sent to Snecma's factory near Paris last
week for investigators to look at.
   Britain grounded the 737-400s after planes operated by British
Midland Airways and DanAir made emergency landings when fan blades
broke in their engines.
   Boeing and CFM International last Tuesday recommended that
airlines operating planes with such engines ground the aircraft
until the engines could be replaced, or until they were adjusted to
operate at lower thrust levels.
   The Federal Aviation Administration issued a similar order the
next day for U.S. airlines. The only U.S. planes affected were five
operated by USAir, and those planes have been given new engines. The
28 other affected 737-400s are operated overseas.
   The -3C engines are rated to operate at 23,500 pounds of thrust.
A similar engine, the CFM56-3B, operates at 22,000 pounds of thrust,
and the FAA said there have been no engine failures at that level in
more than 6 million hours of flight.
   On Friday, Britain's CAA confirmed a Times of London report that
cracking had been found in the engines as well as in the fan blades.
Noonan said the new cracking was found on an engine of a British
Midland plane not involved in the in-flight incidents that prompted
the original grounding.
   Boeing spokesman Craig Martin said any new 737-400s delivered to
airlines with -3C engines would have the engines adjusted to 22,000
pounds of thrust before the planes leave Boeing assembly plants near
Seattle.
   Other foreign carriers that operate the affected 737-400s are
Icelandair, Hapag Lloyd of Germany, Asiana of South Korea, Braaten
of Norway, Nortjet of Spain, and Istanbul of Turkey, Martin said.
   Fixes have been made on many of those planes, and they have
returned to service, Martin said.
   A British Midland 737-400 crashed after developing engine
problems in January, killing 47 people. No cause has been determined
for that accident, in which investigators said the pilot reported
problems in one engine but mistakenly shut down the other engine.

   A high-roller who contends he lost more than
$200,000 in a two-week spree at an Atlantic City casino was plied
with drugs and alcohol that left him reeling while he placed bets,
his attorney claimed Monday.
   ``He was without his senses,'' attorney Steven Goldman said
during opening arguments in a lawsuit filed by his client, Shmuel
Aboud, 44, of New York. ``He was literally unconscious at the table
several times.''
   The Golden Nugget Casino filed a lawsuit in 1985 against Aboud
seeking payment of gambling debts totaling $27,000 that Aboud
amassed at the casino in February 1985.
   ``Mr. Aboud is using the litigation process ... in an attempt to
avoid a just debt that he incurred,'' said Stephen N. Dratch, an
attorney for the casino. ``Mr. Aboud wanted to be at the Golden
Nugget.''
   But Aboud, an Israeli citizen, filed a counterclaim against the
casino. He said he was ``deprived of his reason and understanding''
after the casino ``fraudulently, intentionally and maliciously''
offered him alcoholic beverages while he gambled at a blackjack
table.
   At the time, Aboud was taking Percodan, a pain-killer prescribed
by two physicians called by the casino to Aboud's hotel room after
he complained of back pains sustained in a 1977 car accident,
Goldman said.
   ``They were offering him cognacs and drinks to wash it down,''
Goldman argued before U.S. District Court Judge Mitchell Cohen.
   Goldman said Aboud suffered from intoxication ``to the point of
unconsciousness,'' but casino officials pressured him to continue to
gamble.
   ``You're not going to hear tales of drowsiness. You're to hear a
tale of unconsciousness,'' Goldman said as Aboud, a short, balding
man, sat tensely behind him, occasionally biting his lip.
   Attorneys involved in the trial, which is expected to last about
a week, say the outcome could set a precedent for the state's casino
industry.
   ``It would open the door to an exorbitant amount of fraudulent
claims by patrons who lose,'' said Steven Horne, who also represents
the Golden Nugget. ``It would turn the casino industry on its head.''
   Goldman said Aboud lost more than $200,000 during his stay in a
$1,000-a-day, complimentary hotel room supplied by the casino. Aboud
had recently received a $395,000 insurance settlement from the car
accident, the attorney said.
   ``This case is about a fishing expedition,'' Goldman told the
eight jurors hearing the civil case. ``They hooked him and they
didn't let him go until they took every penny from him.''
   Dratch said Aboud only lost about $72,000 during the spree and
netted winnings of about $70,000. He said Aboud took advantage of
complimentary offers provided by the casino and requested that he be
flown home to New York to withdraw funds from his bank accounts.
   ``He wants this jury to deal him a better hand than he could
obtain on his own,'' Dratch said. ``His defense is frivolous.''

   The widow of Prime Minister Olof Palme
pointed her finger at defendant Christer Pettersson on Monday and
identified him as the man confronting her husband the instant he was
assassinated.
   ``I'm absolutely certain,'' Lisbeth Palme told the hushed
courtroom when asked if Pettersson was the man she saw a few feet
away as Palme crumpled to the street with a fatal bullet wound.
   Palme, the leading figure in Swedish politics for more than a
decade, was shot and killed Feb. 28, 1986, as he and Mrs. Palme were
leaving a late movie downtown. Mrs. Palme was slightly wounded.
   Pettersson has declared his innocence.
   Mrs. Palme said she clearly saw Pettersson's face but didn't look
at his hands to see if he had a gun.
   An autopsy report said Palme was shot from a distance of about
eight inches, and investigators said only Palme, his wife and the
killer were in the immediate vicinity.
   Mrs. Palme's testimony was a breakthrough for the prosecution,
which had suffered repeated setbacks since the trial began two weeks
ago. Several witnesses had backed away from earlier statements
implicating Pettersson.
   Pettersson, 42, was arrested in December. He has a long criminal
record, which includes a conviction for manslaughter, and a history
of drug and alcohol abuse.
   ``It will be difficult to let him go after this. If the court
lets him off, they will have to justify their decision,'' said Clas
Borgstom, a criminal lawyer not directly involved with the case, in
an interview with Swedish Radio.
   Defense attorney Arne Liljeros told a news conference after the
hearing that his client felt ``distressed'' after Mrs. Palme's
testimony.
   He did not discuss Mrs. Palme's statement that she did not see a
gun, but indicated he would concentrate his defense on how the
suspect was identified during the investigation and the time that
has passed since the killing. He was asked if he considered Mrs.
Palme's testimony reliable and replied, ``I will return to that.''
   Liljeros said his client ``maintains his position (of innocence)
in all ways.''
   Mrs. Palme, who came into the courtroom supported by her son,
Joachim, walked sideways to hide her face from the 60 reporters in
the room.
   She had said she would testify on condition that no taped record
be made of the session, that it not be broadcast, and that reporters
be excluded from the courtroom. The court agreed to the first two
conditions but allowed the press inside.
   She also had asked that Pettersson not be present during her
testimony. He was not in the room while she testified but was
brought in after a short recess and Mrs. Palme was still on the
stand.
   Prosecutor Anders Helin asked if she could identify the man she
saw seconds after her husband had been shot. Mrs. Palme pointed at
the defendant, sitting 30 feet away.
   ``I'm certain,'' she said.
   ``If Olof Palme in his heaven could have heard this, he wouldn't
have liked it,'' said Pettersson, breaking in over the objections of
Judge Carl-Anton Spak. ``If you believe in what you're saying, it's
OK. But otherwise, it's not,'' Pettersson added before guards took
him from the room.
   Mrs. Palme made no reply.
   Under cross-examination, Mrs. Palme admitted she was uncertain
about details of the killer's clothing on the night of the slaying.
But she stressed several times that his face was lit by streetlights
and that she had seen it clearly.
   ``I'm trained in my job to observe things,'' said Mrs. Palme, a
psychologist by training.
   ``My state of shock made me even more observant,'' she said.
``That's why I remember his face so clearly.''
   During police interrogations she has repeatedly refered to
Pettersson's eyes as ``piercing and unforgettable.''
   Mrs. Palme also lashed out at the news media on the stand, saying
they had ``tried their best to destroy the investigation.''

<TEXT>
   Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir
responded Monday to the stabbing death of a U.S.-born settler by
promising to smash violence in the occupied territories with an
``iron fist.''
   Hundreds of settlers demonstrated in Jerusalem, Tel Aviv and the
West Bank after the weekend slaying of Frederick Steven Rosenfeld, a
former U.S. Marine.
   ``How many Jews have to die before something is done?'' some
chanted.
   Late Monday, settlers in 50 cars drove to a road junction near
Ariel, in the West Bank near Nablus, and threw rocks at Arab-owned
vehicles, smashing windshields, Israel radio reported.
   The settlers demanded the government take harsher measures to
quell the 18-month Palestinian uprising in which 524 Palestinians
and 23 Israelis, including Rosenfeld, have died.
   Shamir called the death ``another link in the chain of blood of
violent actions carried out against us ... by murderers and rioters
who believe that by these actions they will put an end to our
settlement and our existence.''
   ``Israel's security forces will uproot this violence with an iron
fist.''
   Shamir did not elaborate.
   Israel's military command said Monday it will extend the closing
of West Bank schools for another month, ignoring pleas from the
United States and human rights groups.
   The 1,194 schools have been closed for all but a few weeks since
Feb. 3, 1988, affecting 320,000 pupils. Israel says the schools,
including 145 kindergartens, are rallying points for rioters.
   In the occupied Gaza Strip, Arab doctors said troops wounded 12
Palestinians in clashes Monday at three refugee camps, including a
15-year-old girl shot in the head. The army said it knew nothing of
the shootings.
   In Jerusalem, 80 Jewish settlers blocked the entrance to
Parliament to protest Rosenfeld's slaying. Fistfights broke out when
guards ordered the protesters to disperse, army radio said.
   West Bank police commander Chaim Malka said police suspect
Palestinians in the killing, but are investigating all possibilities.
   Palestinian shepherds found Rosenfeld's body Sunday on a hill
between the Arab villages of Salfit and Burkin, said Avivi Shalom,
security chief at Ariel settlement, in an interview.
   Rosenfeld, 48, had been missing since Friday night. He liked
hiking and apparently walked to the barren area from Ariel, Shalom
said.
   ``It seems as though the assailants surprised him and hit him on
the head,'' Shalom said. He said Rosenfeld's empty pistol holster,
map, binoculars and two spent cartridges were found near the body.
   The Maariv daily said it appeared the settler fired in the
direction of the assailants.
   Ariel officials said Rosenfeld was a former resident of
Washington and emigrated to Israel in 1968. He fought in Israel's
army and edited technical manuals in Tel Aviv before becoming a
settler 18 months ago.
   Shamir is under increasing pressure from hawks in his right-wing
Likud bloc to lay aside his plan for elections in the occupied lands
and first put down the revolt.
   ``I don't see any peace process unless terror and violence will
be stopped by Israel,'' Trade Minister Ariel Sharon said Monday on
Israel Radio.
   About 200 protesting settlers honked their horns at 3 a.m.
outside the Tel Aviv home of Defense Minister Yitzhak Rabin,
chanting ``Rabin, resign!''
   An additional 150 settlers converged on Ariel
   Rabin on Monday appointed Maj. Gen. Yitzhak Mordechai, a tough
paratroop officer, as commander of troops in the West Bank.
Mordechai, now chief of the army's southern command, has been in
charge of the Gaza Strip during the rebellion.
   He replaces central command head Maj. Gen. Amram Mitzna, who has
been responsible for the West Bank and now will go on study leave.
   Mitzna has been under fire by right-wing politicians and by
Jewish settlers for what they termed a liberal attitude toward the
uprising.
   The army said Maj. Gen. Matan Vilnai, now in charge of army
personnel, will succeed Mordechai as southern command chief.

<HEAD>Conservative Leader Succeeds Only in Part</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Conservative opposition leader Constantine
Mitsotakis twice has tried to unseat an old foe.
   He failed in 1985, when Premier Andreas Papandreou's Panhellenic
Socialist Movement handily defeated him in national elections.
   And he achieved only partial success Sunday, defeating Papandreou
but failing to garner enough votes to win the post he coveted for so
long.
   Mitsotakis, a lawyer, immediately took the offensive Monday,
using the skills as a party infighter and strategist that have
earned him a reputation as an effective parliamentarian.
   He appealed to the Coalition of the Left and Progress to join him
in an interim government to punish the officials responsible for
scandals that led to the resignation or firing of eight Cabinet
members.
   The worst is a $20 million scandal involving the collapse of the
Bank of Crete. Mitsotakis has contended Papandreou is responsible,
but the premier denies wrongdoing.
   Before the election, Mitsotakis had said he would not accept
support from the Communists, the coalition partner of the Greek Left
Party.
   But that was to form a government. This, he says, would be a
brief partnership to deal with the ``catharsis'' or cleansing of the
government.
   ``He's very tolerant. He'll listen to anything and not reject it
before giving it a good amount of thought,'' his 21-year-old son,
Kyriakos, said in a recent interview.
   But Mitsotakis' appeal also demonstrates his political savvy:
acting to offer a temporary solution before Papandreou and his
Socialists can forge a more lasting alliance with the coalition.
   In contrast to the charismatic Papandreou, who rarely attended
parliamentary debates, Mitsotakis has shown more talent in the
300-seat, single-chamber body than as a speaker exciting crowds from
a podium.
   He was elected to lead the New Democracy party in 1984 because
conservatives felt he was the only man capable of dealing with
Papandreou.
   His personal feud with Papandreou dates back to the 1960s, when
both men were members of the Center Union party led by George
Papandreou, Andreas' father.
   Papandreou accuses Mitsotakis of being involved in political
intrigues that led to the collapse of the Center Union government
and triggered the 1967-1974 military dictatorship.
   During the junta, Mitsotakis fled to exile in Paris.
   Eventually, he joined the New Democrats and held the foreign and
economic portfolios in the 1974-81 governments.
   His political career began when he was elected to Parliament in
1946 at the age of 28 in his native Chania, on Crete.
   He was known on the island as a resistance fighter and organizer
who twice was sentenced to death by the Nazis.

   Premier Andreas Papandreou may have lost
his bid for a third term, but it's too early to write off the man
who brought Greece's first socialist government to power.
   ``The people punished the thieves,'' trumpeted the mass
circulation newspaper Apogevmatini, referring to financial scandals
that triggered the dismissals and resignations of eight members of
Papandreou's Cabinet.
   But despite opposition charges he was involved in the corruption,
the charismatic premier attracted 39 percent of the vote and could
retain office to lead a coalition government.
   ``I am used to opposition ... I revel in it,'' Papandreou, 70,
joked before Sunday's election, referring to the 1974-81 period his
party spent in the opposition.
   The center-right New Democracy party of Constantine Mitsotakis
got 45 percent of the vote, but failed to win a parliamentary
majority. That raises prospects of a coalition or new elections.
   ``The progressive forces have a majority in Parliament. ... We
remain on the battlements with optimism and certainty of final
outcome,'' Papandreou said Monday when he conceded Mitsotakis would
finish ahead of him.
   The former U.S. economics professor brought Greece's first
socialist government to power in 1981 with promises of a welfare
state and calls to close U.S. military bases in Greece and withdraw
from NATO and the European Economic Community.
   Reality softened his hard-line stance, and an ailing economy
forced his government to implement conservative monetary policies.
   Greece remained in NATO, became a staunch European Community
supporter and signed an agreement to keep U.S. bases.
   The last six months of his second four-year term were marred by
allegations of widespread corruption, multimillion-dollar scandals,
a messy divorce from his American-born wife, Margaret, and his open
affair with a woman half his age.
   Papandreou was born on the Aegean Sea island of Chios. He studied
law at Athens University and emigrated to the United States in 1939
after a military regime expelled him because of his leftist leanings.
   He remained an American citizen for more than 20 years and served
in the U.S. Navy in World War II.
   Papandreou obtained a doctorate of philosophy in economics from
Harvard, taught at several universities and was professor of
economics at the University of California at Berkeley.
   His political career began in 1959 when he returned to Greece and
renounced U.S. citizenship. He first was elected to Parliament in
1964 as a deputy on the ticket of his father's center party, former
Greek Prime Minister George Papandreou's Union Party.
   The younger Papandreou served as a Cabinet minister and deputy
minister in 1964 and 1965.
   He was expelled a second time by a military dictatorship that
ruled from 1967 until democracy was restored in 1974. Papandreou
founded his socialist party in 1974.

   BBC journalist Kate Adie said Monday she was grazed
by a bullet that killed a man next to her as she watched Chinese
troops crush pro-democracy student protests in Beijing this month.
   ``I was hit by a bullet on my arm. It killed a man in front of
me. I fell over his corpse,'' Miss Adie said on British Broadcasting
Corp. TV after returning to Britain.
   ``I did not know what to do. I crawled out with a (film) cassette
I foolishly had with me of our coverage that night, and ran for my

   Asked if she was frightened by killings in central Beijing's
Tiananmen Square, she said: ``Panic-stricken at one point.''
   Miss Adie said she was ``roughed up'' by soldiers during the June
3-4 violence as she carried the film back to her hotel.
   The BBC said Monday that BBC Asian correspondent Brian Barron and
his television crew will be allowed to leave China, one week after
they were arrested and their passports seized.
   ``All the documents have been returned and we are expecting them
back on the first available plane,'' said a BBC spokesman, speaking
anonymously in keeping with British custom.
   He said Barron ``has been told he can return to China.''

<TEXT>
   Pipe bombs exploded Monday at a Bank
of Boston branch and a U.S. Army recruiting office prior to a Senate
hearing on the island's future political relationship with the
United States.
   Police said no one was injured and damage was slight in the
pre-dawn blasts in Bayamon, about 15 miles southwest of San Juan.
   Similar explosions, with no injuries and minor damage, occurred
Friday at a U.S. Customs office in the southern city of Ponce and
Sunday at a Chase Manhattan bank branch in the north-central city of
Caguas.
   Los Macheteros, a militant pro-independence group that has been
relatively inactive in recent years, claimed responsibility for
Monday's bombings.
   In a letter delivered to The Associated Press in San Juan, the
group said it was protesting the ``farcical hearings'' being held by
a Senate committee here on a plebiscite planned for 1991 that will
allow Puerto Ricans to vote on their future relationship with the
United States.
   The group also cited the jailing of Macheteros members in
connection with the $7 million robbery of a Wells Fargo depot in
Hartford, Conn., in 1983.
   On Thursday, a federal court in Hartford sentenced a Macheteros
member, Juan Segarra Palmer, to 65 years in prison and fined him
$500,000 for his part in the robbery. He and three other people were
convicted in April.
   Nine others accused of the robbery, including alleged Macheteros
leader Filiberto Ojeda Rios, are awaiting trial.
   The letter said the violence would continue until the United
States ended its military, political and economic presence in Puerto
Rico.
   The FBI said it was investigating the letter, which bore the
star-and-machete logo of the Macheteros' ``Ejercito Popular
Boricua,'' or People's Army of Borinquen. Los Macheteros is Spanish
for The Machete Wielders, and Borinquen is the Indian name for
Puerto Rico.
   The explosions Monday occurred within an hour of each other, said
police spokeswoman Maria del Pilar Bon. She said one bomb slightly
damaged the bank building's facade and shattered windows of a nearby
bus terminal. The other blast shattered windows of the recruiting
office.
   The U.S. Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee held
hearings in San Juan on Friday, Saturday and Monday on the proposed
plebiscite on whether Puerto Rico should remain a U.S. commonwealth,
become the 51st U.S. state or seek independence.
   The Caribbean island of 3.2 million mostly Spanish-speaking
people has been a U.S. commonwealth since 1952.
   It will be the first vote on Puerto Rico's political status since
1967, when 67 percent voted to remain a U.S. commonwealth, 32
percent for statehood and less than 1 percent for independence.
Puerto Rico's statehood and independence parties did not actively
participate in that vote.
   Sen. J. Bennett Johnston, D-La., who presided at the Senate
hearings, said at the close of Monday's session that the plebiscite
would be ``fundamentally different'' because the three status
options would be precisely defined and the vote would be binding on
Congress.
   Under commonwealth, Puerto Ricans are U.S. citizens and eligible
for federal benefits, but they cannot vote for president. The island
received $6.5 billion in federal money in 1988.
   The committee's next round of hearings is scheduled for July
12-14 to hear the Bush administration's views on the plebiscite.
President Bush has said he favors statehood.

<HEAD>More Than 700 Schools Could Lose Financial Aid</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JILL LAWRENCE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Education Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   More than 700 educational institutions could
lose student financial aid funds because they have failed to meet
new requirements involving drugs and eligibility for aid, the
Education Department said Monday.
   In order for their students to receive certain grants and loans,
schools must now certify that they are drug-free workplaces. For
their low-income students to receive Pell grants, they also must
certify that they do not employ anyone who has been barred from
receiving money from any federal agency.
   The department said 700 schools will not receive their 1989-1990
Pell grants, which the schools disburse to students for tuition,
books and other academic uses, if they do not file both
certifications.
   Another 180 schools face delay or loss of 1989-1990 funds for
campus-based grants, loans and work-study programs if they don't
submit drug-free workplace forms.
   The Pell grant suspension and debarment forms were due on June 16
and the drug-free certifications are due on June 22. The money is
scheduled for release on July 1.
   Education Secretary Lauro Cavazos said the number of schools that
have failed so far to file the necessary certifications amounts to
nearly 10 percent of all institutions participating in federal
financial aid programs. He said the department has written and
telephoned all affected institutions, in some cases as many as four
times.
   ``These schools' failure to comply with these mandatory
certifications could have a devastating impact on thousands of
students nationwide, who rely on federal financial aid for
postsecondary education,'' Cavazos said in a statement.
   The drug-free workplace certification is part of a 1988 law that
requires all federal grant recipients and most contractors to
certify that they have a drug-free work environment. The law
requires specific steps such as notifying employees in writing that
drug abuse in the workplace is banned and educating employees to the
dangers of drug abuse and the availability of counseling.
   The suspension and debarment certification for Pell grants is
part of a government-wide regulation designed to make sure that if
someone has been barred from receiving money from one federal
agency, he or she isn't eligible for federal dollars from another
agency. The same type of certification will be required for the
campus-based loan, grant and work-study programs next year, a
department official said.

<TEXT>
   The view of the jagged mountain landscape
seems limitless from atop the Great Wall. All that is missing is the
click of camera shutters and the gasps of thrilled foreigners.
   The tourist season is here, but there are few people climbing
China's most famous sight _ the ``Chang Cheng,'' or Great Wall.
   Few people snap up souvenirs or visit the many restaurants that
cater to travelers, much to the dismay of the Chinese who rely on
tourism for their livelihood.
   A Chinese man lingering where tourists can begin walking to the
top of the wall, part of a 45-mile stretch as Mutianyu, offered an
explanation. Asked about the tourist drought, he pantomimes the
shooting of a machine gun, a reference to the government's violent
military suppression of demonstrators two weeks ago in central
Beijing.
   ``There is so little to do now without the foreigners. We're very
tired because we're not busy,'' he says.
   The crackdown on the demonstrators and the worldwide condemnation
it has generated have chilled China's burgeoning tourism industry.
   The state-run China International Travel Service has been
encouraging foreigners asking about travel within China to continue
with their plans to visit the vast country, saying all areas open to
tourists are safe.
   Economically, there is much at stake.
   Earlier this year, the National Tourism Administration released
figures showing that China earned $2.2 billion in foreign currency
from tourism in 1988, up 19.4 percent from 1987. Through last year,
tourism had brought in $12 billion since the country was opened to
foreign visitors in 1978, the figures show.
   The wall, which winds over mountains and through valleys, is one
of China's premier tourist attractions.
   At Mutianyu, about 50 miles north of Beijing, vendors and
ticket-takers seemed surprised by foreign visitors who came Monday
to see the stone barrier built along China's northern frontier to
protect against invasion. The great work was begun in the third
century B.C.
   Two people who wanted to ride a cable car to the top had to hunt
for someone to sell them tickets. After the purchase, they looked
for someone to start the cable car on its way up the mountain.
   Later, at the base of the mountain, a vendor pushed for a sale.
He motioned to T-shirts and silk quilts displayed on a table at the
end of a row of about 40 empty stalls.
   ``I give you good deal, best deal,'' he said in English.
   When a foreigner started to walk away without buying, the vendor
talked faster, promising an ``even better deal.''
   ``Please buy. Please buy here. Good price here. I give you best
price here.''
   At the nearby Yisong restaurant, the only person in the dining
room read a newspaper as he leaned back in his chair, his legs
resting on top of a table.
   ``Closed, closed. The restaurant is closed,'' he said when
someone entered the room. He indicated there were no definite plans
to reopen.
   ``When more people come to see the Great Wall we will sell them
food,'' he said. ``When will that be? I don't know.''

   Showers and thunderstorms spread across the South and north to
the Great Lakes on Monday, with heavy rain causing flooding in
Alabama, and temperatures reached record highs across the western
Plains.
   Afternoon showers and thunderstorms extended from northwestern
Florida across southeastern Louisiana and north into Wisconsin,
Lower Michigan, Indiana and Ohio. Showers and thunderstorms also
were scattered over southern Florida and western Texas.
   A storm poured rain on eastern Alabama at a rate of more than 1
inch an hour, sending creeks across rural roads and forcing
officials to open flood gates on the Lake Martin reservoir on the
Tallapoosa River for the first time since 1984.
   Some roads were washed out, state police reported.
   Lightning during the storm sparked minor fires at two houses in
Dadeville, which received 6 inches of rain, the National Weather
Service said. Montgomery got 1.85 inches of rain in the six hours up
to 2 p.m. EDT.
   In Houston County, authorities said high wind downed trees and
power lines at Cottonwood and in the community of Webb.
   In Florida, }-inch-diameter hail fell northeast of Tallahassee
and wind gusted to 76 mph at the Tallahassee airport.
   Thunderstorm wind gusts caused damage near Whitmire, S.C., at
Webb and Cottonwood, Ala., and near Sharon, Ga., the weather service
said.
   Locally heavy rain also fell in the central Lower Michigan
counties of Isabella and Montcalm, with as much as 2.61 inches at
Blanchard during a four-hour period, the weather service said.
   Elsewhere, showers developed over the northern Pacific Coast.
   Temperatures reached 90 degrees and hotter by early afternoon
from Minnesota across North Dakota.
   Across the western Plains, reports of record highs included 94 at
Colorado Springs, Colo.; 98 at Denver, and 102 at Scottsbluff, Neb.
Denver's previous record of 96 had stood since 1880.
   Temperatures around the nation at 3 p.m. EDT ranged from 52
degrees at Seattle to 110 at Tucson, Ariz. Monday's low temperature
for the Lower 48 states was 37 degrees at West Yellowstone, Mont.
   For Tuesday, showers and thunderstorms were forecast from New
York state across southern New England, and from New Jersey and
Pennsylvania across Florida, Alabama, southeastern Mississippi and
southeastern Louisiana. Showers were forecast along the northern
Pacific Coast.
   Highs were predicted in the 60s from western Montana across the
northern Pacific Coast; near 90 over the Mississippi Valley and
North Dakota; in the 90s in Florida, from South Dakota across Texas,
from much of Wyoming across New Mexico, and in the central section
of southern California; 100 degrees and hotter from inland
south-central Texas across western Texas and the Texas Panhandle;
from 100 to near 120 from southern and western Arizona across
southeastern California and southern Nevada. Temperatures were
expected generally in the 70s and 80s over the remainder of the
nation.

   Recreation boating fatalities continued a
steady decline in 1988 to a record low of 946 deaths while the
number of registered boats increased, the Transportation Department
said.
   Coast Guard Capt. Bill Griswold, the service's top boating safety
officer, attributed the decline to increased awareness of the danger
of drinking while boating.
   Fatalities declined to 946 in 1988 from 1,036 in 1987, 1,066 in
1986 and 1,116 in 1985, the department said. The 1988 figure, which
amounted to 5.5 deaths per 100,000 boats, was the lowest since the
Coast Guard began keeping track of boating fatalities 28 years ago.
   The Coast Guard estimates that there were 17.3 million boats on
the nation's waterways in 1988, an increase of 400,000 over the
previous year.
   Griswold said about 50 percent of boating accidents are linked to
alcohol use. Alcohol is also a factor in about half the traffic
fatalities on the nation's highways.
   The number of injuries in boating accidents decreased only
slightly, from 3,501 in 1987 to 3,476 last year. The number of
accidents was at 6,746 in 1987 and 6,718 last year.
   Property damage in boating accidents reached $24.33 million last
year, about $3 million more than the year before, the department
said.

<HEAD>Copyright Protection Sought for Architecture</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT M. ANDREWS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The U.S. Copyright Office recommended Monday
that the same copyright protections guaranteed by other nations for
their architects' creations be extended to works of architecture in
the United States.
   U.S. copyright law prohibits unauthorized copying of
architectural plans, sketches and models but does not prevent
``copycat'' construction of actual buildings.
   The law includes buildings in the same legal category of such
``useful articles'' as alarm clocks, toasters and automobiles, which
are not afforded copyright protection.
   The Copyright Office of the Library of Congress on Monday
published a lengthy report of a 14-month study of the issue,
conducted at the request of Rep. Robert W. Kastenmeier, D-Wis., and
Sen. Patrick J. Leahy, D-Vt.
   Kastenmeier, who received the report at a news conference at the
Library of Congress, said he soon would introduce proposed
legislation aimed at assuring that ``the best of American creativity
is respected and protected.'' He gave no details.
   In a move intended to hasten a government decision, the Frank
Lloyd Wright Foundation submitted copyright applications for two
buildings designed by the late architect, the Guggenheim Museum in
New York City and Beth Shalom Synagogue in Elkins Park, Pa., a
Philadelphia suburb.
   The American Institute of Architects endorsed the Copyright
Office's view that federal law needs to be made ``more clearly
consistent with the Berne Convention,'' the world copyright treaty
which the United States joined on March l.
   Under that treaty, virtually every other signatory nation
guarantees copyright protection to works of architecture, but
legislation passed by Congress last year providing for U.S.
adherence to the treaty failed to provide similar guarantees for
American architects. Instead, the U.S. Copyright Office was asked to
study the issue and make recommendations.
   The Copyright Office report did not recommend specific action but
outlined several options. One would be to amend federal law to
exclude unique architectural structures from the ``useful article''
exemption, thus allowing copyright protection for certain
exceptional buildings but not, for instance, tract housing.
   The AIA said current law has proved only partially effective in
helping resolve an increasing number of lawsuits challenging
unauthorized construction of look-alike buildings using pirated
copyright plans.
   Ralph Oman, the register of copyrights, said his office would
decide in a few months whether to register the two buildings
designed by Frank Lloyd Wright. He indicated that the limitations of
existing law would influence the decision, but said a decision would
be delayed if a consensus developed in Congress to amend the law to
extend copyright protection to architectural works.

   Mudslides caused by rivers swollen in the
summer monsoon killed 16 people and left thousands homeless in a
remote, hilly state, news reports said Monday.
   United News of India said 10 people and four soldiers were buried
in landslides Thursday in West Kameng district of Arunachal Pradesh
state, about 900 miles east of New Delhi.
   Two people died Friday in the neighboring Bomdilla district in
floods caused by heavy rains since the monsoon came earlier this
month, the news agency said.
   It said the homeless are being cared for in relief camps in
Arunachal Pradesh and nearby Assam state, where the Brahmaputra
River had topped the danger mark.
   In neighboring Bangladesh, the River Gumti spilled over its
embankment and swept away thousands of mud-and-straw huts in about
100 villages, officials said Monday.
   About 50,000 people were left homeless, they said.
   The deluge inundated several thousand acres of crops in the
district, 55 miles southeast of Dhaka, according to a provincial
official who arrived in the capital Monday.
   Many people were marooned on roofs of houses and hundreds are
camped on roads and along unbroken portions of the embankment while
rain continued Monday, he said.
   Bangladesh, a low-lying country, is crossed by hundreds of rivers
that form the deltas of the Brahmaputra and the Ganges, the two
major rivers of the Indian subcontinent.
   Officials said Monday the two rivers will keep rising in the next
24 hours.
   Floods triggered by the summer monsoon are a seasonal disaster in
India, Nepal and Bangladesh.
   Last year, floods inundated about four-fifths of Bangladesh and
at least 1,400 people were killed. At least 2.3 million people were
left homeless.

   A struggle between the co-pilot and an
armed security guard caused an Afghan airliner to crash in eastern
Iran with the loss of six lives, Tehran radio said Monday.
   The broadcast quoted Deputy Prime Minister Ali Reza Moayyeri as
denying earlier Iranian and Afghan reports the plane was hijacked.
   In Kabul, Afghan Foreign Ministry spokesman Mohammad Nabi Amani
said the plane was hijacked by two gunmen who forced it to fly into
Iranian airspace.
   Moayyeri, heading an official investigation into Sunday's crash
outside the city of Zabol near the southern Afghan border, said the
plane was carrying 39 people. He said it crashed near a mine and
that miners ran to the site and rescued the 33 injured survivors
from the wreckage.
   Moayyer said the guard, who was not identified, had a
long-standing dispute with Khayr Mohammed Sadar Khayl, 26, the
co-pilot of the Ariana Afghan Airlines turbo-prop plane.
   The guard entered the cockpit, closed the door and during an
argument he shot the co-pilot in the shoulder, according to Moayyer.
He said the guard then opened the door to return to the cabin.
   Iran's Islamic Republic News Agency said the dispute involved an
incident when the co-pilot had refused to take on board a cargo
shipment that had arrived late.
   IRNA said the guard went into the cockpit with a passenger
identified only as Dr. Bashir and the shooting followed.
   The Soviet-built An-26 was flying from Kabul, the Afghan capital,
to the southern city of Zaranj when it entered Iranian airspace and
crashed in the desert, Tehran radio said in a dispatch monitored in
Cyprus.
   State-run Iranian TV showed film of the wrecked twin-engine plane
that apparently buckled as it hit the ground and split apart.
   Moayyeri said the difference in air pressure as the cabin door
swung open caused the pilot, Mir Weis Hajai, to lose control of the
plane.
   He said Hajai, 50, was not certified to fly the Antonov, a
short-haul aircraft adapted from a military transport. He said a
qualified pilot could have landed safely at Zabol.
   The plane went down 15 miles from Zabol, 700 miles southeast of
Tehran in Sistan-Baluchistan province.
   Four people died on impact and two others died in Zabol hospital
from ``severe injuries and advanced age,'' Tehran radio quoted
Moayyeri as saying.
   IRNA said three men and one woman were killed in the crash and
two elderly passenger died in a hospsital, one from injuries and the
other from a heart attack.
   On Sunday IRNA had identified the pilot as Mirvis Paktia.
   The control towers at Zabol and the provincial capital, Zahedan,
100 miles to the south, prepared for an emergency landing when the
plane entered Iranian airspace around midday Sunday, according to
Tehran radio.
   But they did not monitor a distress call from the pilot, it added.
   In Kabul, Nabi said earlier Monday that the plane had been
hijacked and people held hostage, but later said Iranian officials
reported there were no hostages.
   He and IRNA said an Afghan delegation left for Zabol on Monday to
investigate the crash and arrange for returning the casualties and
the dead to Afghanistan.
   Afghanistan and Iran do not have diplomatic relations, but
maintain missions in each other's capitals.
   Iran supports Moslem guerrillas in Afghanistan who have been
fighting the Soviet-backed Kabul government for 10 years.

   A senior official said Monday Britain will have
trouble governing Hong Kong if it does not calm anxieties over the
colony's reversion to Chinese rule in 1997 by giving people here the
right to live in Britain.
   Lydia Dunn, a member of the Executive Council (Cabinet), spoke
before she left to try to persuade London to change its mind on the
issue. She and Allen Lee, of the Legislative Council, will meet with
Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, Foreign Secretary Sir Geoffrey
Howe and members of Parliament.
   Mrs. Thatcher told Hong Kong Gov. David Wilson in talks this
month that giving right of residence to the 3.25 million British
passport holders in Hong Kong was politically impossible. British
news reports said up to 250,000 people may be accepted, mostly
current and retired civil servants.
   Hong Kong's 5.5 million people have been alarmed about their fate
when China regains control over the island when Britain's lease
expires in 1997. They intensified demands for right of resettlement
after the June 3-4 bloodshed in Beijing and China's crackdown on the
pro-democracy movement through mass arrests and intimidation.
   Hong Kong natives are entitled to British passports, but the
passports do not allow them to live in Britain.
   ``Without the commitment of the people and their confidence in
staying here, investing here or working here, then Hong Kong becomes
vulnerable. ... This is the case we will be presenting,'' Mrs. Dunn
told a news conference.
   ``I would say it would be very difficult for the British
administration to run this place, (a) population who are not only
anxious about the future but resentful of being deprived of the one
thing which would give them an assurance and which is entirely in
the power of the British government,'' she said.
   She said Britain need not fear a mass influx.
   ``What we're trying to impress on people is that ... people do
not wish to leave Hong Kong. This is our home.
   ``To stay, our anxieties must be allayed. Our anxieties can only
be allayed if there is an assurance that there is a right of abode
in Britain if things do not work out.''
   She said Britain had ``a moral obligation and a constitutional
responsibility'' to grant this.
   A large majority of Hong Kong people responding to recent polls
believe Britain should give the passport holders the right of
resettlement, the Inrasia Pacific Ltd. polling organization said
Monday.

<HEAD>Moslems Win Right to Challenge British Blasphemy Ruling</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A Moslem group seeking to prosecute writer Salman
Rushdie won the right on Monday to challenge a court ruling that
Britain's blasphemy laws apply only to Christianity.
   The Moslem Action Group, which represents Moslems throughout
Britain, wants to bring Rushdie and Viking Penguin Publishers to
trial under blasphemy laws for his novel, ``The Satanic Verses.''
   ``We will now seek to show that any religion, including Islam,
can be included in the offense of blasphemy,'' said Ali Azhar, a
lawyer for Moslem Action.
   Many Moslems believe the book blasphemes Islam, but Rushdie
maintains it does not. The British author, born of Moslem parents in
India, has been in hiding since Feb. 14, when the late Iranian
leader Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini decreed he should die because of
his book.
   High Court Justice Michael Nolan granted Abdal Choudhury, a
spokesman for Moslem Action, permission to challenge the Bow Street
Magistrates Court's refusal to issue summonses on the grounds that
the laws of blasphemy applied only to Christians.
   Nolan decided a full hearing should be by three High Court
judges. No date was set.
   David Pannick, lawyer for Viking Penguin, opposed the application
for High Court review of the magistrate's decision. Rushdie was not
personally represented in court.
   Azhar said Moslem Action now will be seeking the whereabouts of
Rushdie to serve him with legal documents. Lawyers might request the
court's help in locating Rushdie, he said.
   Nolan said an application for assistance could be made, but he
did not indicate what form of aid could be granted or whether
Rushdie's whereabouts would have to be revealed.
   Anti-Rushdie demonstrators cheered at a prayer meeting outside
London's Law Courts after the justice's ruling.
   Supporters waved photographs of Khomeini and banners proclaiming
``Criminal Must Be Brought to Justice'' and ``Satan Rushdie Must be
Punished.''
   Violent demonstrations have been held in several countries,
including Britain, and 19 people died in anti-Rushdie rioting in
India and Pakistan in February.

<HEAD>FAA's New Landing Systems Delayed Again</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A production dispute has forced the Federal
Aviation Administration to put on hold its plan for bringing a new
generation of landing systems to the nation's airports.
   The FAA installed its first microwave landing system at Lebanon
airport in a highly publicized ceremony April 6, and the Laconia and
Manchester airports were scheduled to get the state-of-the-art
system by late summer.
   However, earlier this month, the FAA took a step toward
terminating its contract with Hazeltine Corp., its prime contractor
for the system, FAA spokesman John Leyden said late last week.
   As the agency looks to other electronics firms for the new
technology, it must sell the new system to reluctant air carriers,
who say it isn't much better than the instrument landing system now
in use.
   Leyden said the FAA remains committed to an international
agreement to make the microwave system standard at airports
worldwide by 1998, and has not changed plans to equip all U.S.
airports with the new system by the year 2000.
   The system, which uses high-frequency microwaves to direct planes
to landings, is virtually immune to weather. It allows planes to
make curved and steeper approaches, which increases an airport's
flight capacity and helps planes avoid residential areas.
   The FAA contracted with Hazeltine in 1984 for 178 systems at $79
million, but the Commack, N.Y.,-based firm said the price was too
low and ``entered an unauthorized work-slowdown last August,'' said
Dick Arnold, head of the FAA's microwave landing system program.
   After nearly six months of fruitless negotiations, the FAA on
June 2 sent Hazeltine a letter saying the company's actions could
lead to termination of the contract. Hazeltine has until Thursday to
respond.
   Hazeltine officials were phoned for comment, but refused to say
anything about the issue.
   Leyden said cancelling the Hazeltine contract won't mean
scrapping the FAA's installation program. He said the agency plans
to buy 26 systems from other sources.
   But the cancellation will lead to further delays in the
installation program. Jerry Casavant, the FAA's associate program
director for the microwave landing system in New England, said it
already was at least 3{ years behind the original schedule.
   Leyden said that with installations at Laconia and Manchester put
on hold, the FAA is considering redirecting early installations to
more high-profile, high-volume airports, such as Kennedy
International in New York City.
   The three New Hampshire airports would have been part of the
first phase of planned U.S. installations, which included Boston's
Logan airport and Kennedy International.
   The idea was to equip an entire hub-and-spoke network so that the
airlines that serve those airports would see the benefit of
equipping their planes with the expensive receiving systems.
   The second phase of the FAA's plan, if approved by Congress, is
for 750 systems. That would mean complete replacement of the more
than 700 instrument landing systems in use in the nation's airports
as well as installation of microwave systems at sites unsuitable for
the old system.
   The program's delays have dampened much of the initial enthusiasm
among carriers, Casavant said.
   That's due partly to improvements in the instrument landing
system since the microwave system was first introduced. The
improvements make the instrument system less expensive and more
sophisticated, which makes the switch to the new system less
imperative, state Aeronautics Director Harold Buker said.

   Private employers cannot unilaterally begin
testing union workers for drug and alcohol use but can test job
applicants regardless of whether unions object, the National Labor
Relations Board said Monday in its first decisions on the
controversial issue.
   The board, however, said that if employers test applicants for
drug and alcohol use they cannot deny unions information about those
who are offered jobs but do not accept them, including those who
refuse to submit to tests.
   In rejecting attempts by employers to unlilaterally implement
drug and alcohol testing of current workers represented by unions,
the board said testing is an issue that falls under collective
bargaining and therefore must be the subject of union-management
negotiations.
   But the board said there is no such protection for job applicants
and said employers do not need to negotiate with their unions if
they want to subject applicants to drug and alcohol testing.
   That decision, long awaited by employers and business groups,
could result in a proliferation of applicant-testing policies,
attorneys familiar with labor law said Monday.
   The precedent-setting NLRB decisions came the same day the
Supreme Court ruled that railroads may require tests for workers
without bargaining with unions over the issue. Railway and airline
workers are covered under the Railway Labor Act, not the National
Labor Relations Act that the NLRB is empowered to enforce.
   Attorneys and union officials familiar with drug testing cases
said the Supreme Court decisions would have limited impact outside
the rail and airline industries, where drug testing is common,
particularly in positions with direct impact on public safety. But
they predicted the issues in the cases decided by the NLRB on Monday
could ultimately end up before the high court.
   In the first case, involving the Johnson-Bateman Co. of Etiwanda,
Calif., the NLRB said the company violated its collective bargaining
agreement with the Machinists union when it, in December 1986,
informed employees that it would require drug and alcohol tests for
any employee injured at work.
   ``We conclude that drug (and) alcohol testing of employees who
require treatment for injuries received while on the job is a
mandatory subject of bargaining,'' the board said.
   The board ordered the company to negotiate with the union if it
wanted to adopt such a testing policy for its union-represented
production and maintenance employees.
   Attempts to reach company officials for comment were not
immediately successful. A receptionist said none of the company
owners was in the office, and the lawyer who represented the company
also was not at his office Monday afternoon.
   In the second case, the board reversed an administrative law
judge's decision that pre-employment drug and alcohol testing by the
Star Tribune of Minneapolis was an issue the newspaper needed to
negotiate with its union.
   ``We find that drug and alcohol testing of applicants for
employment is not a mandatory subject of bargaining,'' the board
said.
   John Dennison, the newspaper's vice president for labor
relations, said the Star Tribune was gratified by the decision.
   Dennison said the newspaper has received numerous inquiries about
the status of its case and speculated that ``people who had been
taking a sit back and wait approach may now go ahead'' with
applicant-testing policies.
   The board did say the newspaper violated the National Labor
Relations Act by ``refusing to furnish the union with the requested
information relating to the drug and alcohol testing of prospective
employees.''
   The board said the union, The Newspaper Guild, was entitled to
the information to monitor Star Tribune hiring practices for any
signs of discrimination.
   The union, as part of its challenge of the policy, said male
applicants were allowed to provide urine samples without being
observed while female applicants were required to give the samples
partially unclothed and in the presence of a nurse.
   The NLRB ordered the newspaper to provide the Guild with the
names, addresses and telephone numbers of all applicants to which it
conditionally offered employment in Guild-represented positions
since January 1987 and to identify all those in that group who
refused to submit to drug and alcohol screening.
   The NLRB, adopting reasonining similar to its decision in the
Johnson-Batemen case, upheld the judge's 1988 ruling that the
newspaper violated its collective bargaining agreement with the
Guild by trying to unilaterally implement a drug testing policy for
current workers in January 1987.
   Dennison said the newspaper had not enforced the policy and that
the issue was the subject of current negotiations with the Guild.

   The communist government made
changes in its four top economic posts Monday, one day before
Premier Ladislav Adamec is to address Parliament on the state of the
nation's economy.
   The official CTK news agency CTK gave no reason for the changes.
   Observers said it appeared they were made in line with the
government's declared drive to boost productivity and revive the
stagnant economy.
   Czechoslovakia's relatively high standard of living has helped
the orthodox Communist leaders keep political peace since the 1968
Prague Spring reforms were crushed by a Soviet-led invasion.
   Economic problems are increasing, but the government has not
followed the Soviet Union, Hungary and Poland in adopting reforms.
   These changes were announced in the economy hierarchy:
   Karel Julis, 6O, will leave the recently created ``super
ministry'' for engineering and metallurgy to head the State
Commission for Science, Investment and Technology.
   Julis replaced Pavel Hrivnak, 58, who was nominated June 15 to be
premier of Slovakia. Hrivnak succeeded Ivan Knotek who was given the
economic portfolio in the Communist Party Central Committee.
   Ladislav Vodrazka, 57, a deputy foreign trade minister, took over
Julis' job as chief of the Engineering and Metallurgy Ministry.
   Jaromir Zak, 47, who headed State Pricing Office, became chief of
the State Planning Commission and banking official Alfred Sebek, 49,
replaced Zak in the pricing office.
   CTK said First Deputy Premier Bohumil Urban, 55, lost his post at
the planning commission but retained ministerial rank.
   Julis, at a Communist Party conference last week, presented a
gloomy report on the country's scientific and technological progress.
   ``Our economic productivity amounts to only 5O percent of
productivity in advanced industrial countries ... and the average
machine used in our industry is 18 years old,'' he said.

<HEAD>Consumers Keeping Up With Loan Payments</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Consumers fell behind on their loan payments
less frequently at the end of March than three months earlier, a
trade group reported Monday.
   The American Bankers Association said the delinquency rate on
seven kinds of loans at the end of the first quarter was 2.39
percent, down from 2.49 percent at the end of December. A delinquent
loan is defined as one in which at least one payment is past due for
30 days or more.
   ``Lower delinquencies indicate that consumer balance sheets are
still reasonably strong,'' ABA Chief Economist Robert Dugger said in
a statement.
   Despite the most recent decline, the delinquency rate is still
higher than a year ago when it hit a three-year low of 2.19 percent.
   The District of Columbia reported the lowest delinquency rate,
1.16 percent, followed by South Carolina, 1.19 percent, and
Wisconsin, 1.26 percent. The highest rates were in Puerto Rico, 4.98
percent; Louisiana, 4.75 percent, and North Dakota, 4.40 percent.
   The seven types of loans included in the quarterly survey are:
personal, direct auto, indirect auto, mobile home, recreational
vehicle, property improvement and closed-end home equity.
   The lowest delinquency rate was reported on home equity loans,
which fell to 0.64 percent, down from 0.68 percent three months
earlier. The highest rate was for personal loans, which dropped from
3.34 percent in December to 3.20 percent in March.
   Americans had nearly $693 billion in consumer credit outstanding
at the end of the period.

   Premier Li Peng said Monday that none of the
nations criticizing China's suppression of dissidents would have
shown as much restraint, and he honored as martyrs three soldiers
killed in the crackdown.
   ``For more than 50 days our government, army and party were
restrained,'' Li told the families of the dead soldiers at Communist
Party headquarters, apparently referring to the weeks preceding the
June 3-4 crackdown.
   ``Some countries have attacked us, abused us and created
rumors,'' he said. ``Can their governments be so tolerant? You won't
find one that is.''
   Since troops attacked central Beijing to crush seven weeks of
protests, more than 1,000 people have been arrested and at least 11
have been sentenced to death.
   Western intelligence sources and Chinese witnesses say up to
3,000 people were killed in the crackdown. The government says fewer
than 300 died, half of them soldiers.
   Since declaring martial law May 20 in Beijing, Li has emerged as
the chief spokesman for the government's hard-line position against
the student-led movement for greater freedoms and an end to
government corruption.
   Meanwhile, a special session of the national legislature headed
by a more moderate official was postponed.
   Wan Li, the chairman of the National People's Congress, had
scheduled a congress session beginning Tuesday ``to discuss issues
of people's common concern and prompt the government to improve its
work.''
   Wan, who has a reputation as a moderate, called the session
before the June 3-4 crackdown. Some students had hoped it would
approve some of the democratic reforms they were demanding.
   But the congress's press office said the session was postponed
because Beijing had not yet returned completely to normal. No new
date was set.
   The legislature may be waiting until the Communist Party holds an
anticipated Central Committee meeting to formally oust party General
Secretary Zhao Ziyang. Zhao reportedly already has been stripped of
his power for opposing the crackdown.
   He and party propaganda chief Hu Qili are the only top officials
believed purged. Wan has supported the crackdown publicly.
   The government announced it was expelling the sixth foreign
reporter in the past 10 days. The official Xinhua News Agency said
Joseph Kahn, an American in China on a tourist visa, was given 72
hours to leave after allegedly violating martial law regulations.
   The Dallas Morning News said Kahn worked for them part time. The
U.S. Embassy said he was stopped by police last week after
interviewing people outside Beijing, an area not under martial law.
   Kahn could not be reached for comment. China already has expelled
two American reporters based in Beijing and three British reporters
visiting China and reporting on the crackdown.
   A Canadian reporter said three men in plain clothes, apparently
police, grabbed her late Monday and tried to shove her into an
unmarked car, but that she broke free and the car left when a crowd
gathered. Jan Wong of the Toronto Globe and Mail said the men said
they wanted to talk with her.
   Chinese authorities briefly detained a CBS News crew of four
people early Tuesday, said CBS spokesman Tom Goodman in New York. He
said the four were driving near Tiananmen Square when police stopped
them and ordered them to follow a police car to the Forbidden City,
the old imperial palace compound. He said they were released about
two hours later.
   The government has harshly criticized foreign reporting of the
bloody crackdown and accused reporters of ``rumor-mongering.'' Under
martial law regulations, most interviewing is banned, but many
reporters have ignored the regulations.
   More than 46 additional arrests in connection with the protests
were announced Monday, most workers who joined or helped lead
independent unions. The arrests brought the total reported to more
than 1,360.
   About 30 Chinese trying to get visas to leave the country spent
the night outside the U.S. Embassy, some for the second straight
night. Several hundred slept outside the Canadian Embassy the night
before to get a good place in line. The Chinese government has
tightened emigration restrictions, requiring people who already have
obtained exit permits to get a second one.
   More memorials were held in Beijing and other cities for soldiers
killed in the June 3-4 battle with crowds that used stones,
firebombs and their own bodies to try to stop tanks from entering
Tiananmen Square, where protesters were camped.
   Three slain soldiers have been elevated to martyr status, with
shrines of flowers and banners at the sites where they died.
President Yang Shangkun met with their relatives Sunday, and Li and
other top officials did Monday.
   For the second straight day, more than 100 army trucks, many
jammed with soldiers, drove east from the city center. The troops
apparently were among those that had been billeted inside the walled
compounds around Tiananmen Square.
   Although the troop presence on the streets was sharply reduced by
day, soldiers still set up checkpoints at night where they stopped
and searched cars and checked identification papers.
   Western diplomats said most of the estimated 150,000 soldiers who
were called into Beijing to enforce martial law have been moved from
downtown to the city outskirts.

   The state Senate acted Monday to stem
accidental shootings that have killed or wounded seven children this
month, passing a bill that could imprison gun owners who don't
secure their weapons.
   The bill, approved 32-4 in a special session, sets a maximum
penalty of five years in prison and a $5,000 fine for adult
violators.
   But the measure sponsored by Republican Sen. John Grant was
weakened by amendments that lowered the age of a minor from 18 to 16
and exempted guns kept in automobiles and unloaded firearms.
   ``We think by highlighting the responsibility to keep a loaded
gun away from children, we're going to save a lot of lives,'' Gov.
Bob Martinez said before the Senate acted.
   ``The Legislature felt it needed to do something so that you
folks would shut up,'' National Rifle Association spokeswoman Marion
Hammer told reporters after the Senate vote.
   The shootings this month led Martinez to include gun safety in a
special session of the Legislature, which was originally called
mainly to debate a turnpike building plan.
   Hammer, whose organization has blocked efforts to toughen
Florida's liberal gun laws in recent years, called the Senate bill
``phony, unreal and a disservice to the people of Florida,'' but
said the NRA was satisfied with it.
   In the House, seven gun safety bills were filed for
consideration, and three of those were assigned to committee
hearings scheduled for Tuesday.
   One of the three measures could result in a five-year prison term
if a child is killed or maimed by an unattended weapon.
   The bill by Republican Rep. Harry Jennings would also make it a
misdemeanor to leave a firearm accessible to a child.
   The measure passed in the House during the recently completed
regular session, but the Senate didn't take it up, making it
necessary for the bill to be reconsidered.
   A second measure by Democratic Rep. Susan Guber would punish
anyone selling or furnishing a weapon to an unsupervised minor
without parental permission, and requires gun owners to keep their
firearms locked and unloaded. It exempts stolen guns.
   The third measure, by Democratic Rep. Brian Rush, would require
gun stores to post signs warning gun owners about leaving loaded
weapons within reach of children.
   To become law, a bill must be passed by both the House and the
Senate, then be signed by the governor.
   The session followed the death Saturday night of 4-year-old
Silvio Claud Pierre at Tampa General Hospital, where he had been in
critical condition after shooting himself at his home June 11.
   Silvio found a handgun under a couch while his mother was in the
shower. His father was out.
   Five days earlier, a 10-year-old Orlando boy was killed by a
playmate. Six days earlier, an 8-year-old Miramar girl was killed by
her 10-year-old brother who thought his father's gun was unloaded.
   Four children ranging in age from 4 to 16 were wounded in
separate accidental shootings this month.

<HEAD>Huge Hurricane-Like Storm Found On Neptune; Like Jupiter's Great
Red Spot</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LEE SIEGEL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Science Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>PASADENA, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A giant spot roughly 6,200 miles wide has
been discovered on the planet Neptune by the Voyager 2 space probe,
and scientists said Monday it looks like a storm similar to the
Great Red Spot on Jupiter.
   ``It's huge,'' said physicist Edward Stone, Voyager project
scientist for NASA and a vice president of the California Institute
of Technology. ``It would be reasonable to suspect this is a large,
hurricane-like storm system similar to the Great Red Spot.''
   However, Stone said Voyager 2 still is too far from Neptune to
determine if winds are swirling within the gargantuan spot, which
measures about 6,200 miles in diameter. Jupiter's Great Red Spot
contains 250 mph winds.
   Scientists haven't yet named Neptune's spot, but are calling it
``the dark spot'' because it appears darker than the surrounding
blue-greenish atmosphere, he added.
   The color of the spot isn't yet known because scientists haven't
processed a complete set of pictures through different color
filters, said Andrew Ingersoll, a Caltech planetary scientist.
   Voyager 2 is hurtling at more than 42,000 mph toward its Aug. 24
close encounter with Neptune. At that time, the hardy spacecraft
will zip within 3,000 miles of the gaseous planet's cloud tops _ by
far the closest of any of Voyager's planetary flybys. Five hours
later, it will fly within 25,000 miles of Triton, one of Neptune's
two known moons.
   By Tuesday, Voyager 2 will be nearly 2.66 billion miles from
Earth and 58.98 million miles from Neptune, traveling at a speed of
42,216 mph, said Mary Beth Murrill, a spokeswoman for the National
Aeronautics and Space Administration's Jet Propulsion Laboratory.
   The Neptune encounter will be Voyager 2's fourth and final
planetary flyby since the probe was launched from Cape Canaveral in
1977. It explored Jupiter in 1979, Saturn in 1981 and Uranus in 1986.
   Neptune's dark spot is located at about 25 to 30 degrees latitude
in the planet's southern hemisphere, Ingersoll said, adding that
Voyager also discovered a much smaller, rapidly changing white spot
_ about half the size of the dark spot _ at about 70 degrees south
latitude.
   Stone said Neptune's dark spot first was clearly recognized in
still photographs taken by Voyager 2's television cameras in April,
and can be seen faintly in pictures taken as early as January.
   It isn't as large as Jupiter's Great Red Spot, which is 16,000
miles across at its widest point _ large enough to contain three
Earths. But the dark spot is just as large relative to Neptune _
about a fifth of the planet's diameter _ as the Great Red Spot is
relative to Jupiter.
   Jupiter's Great Red Spot was discovered more than 350 years ago.
Ingersoll said it is believed to be red because of organic
chemicals, or possibly sulfur or phosphorus, trapped within it.
   Besides the Great Red Spot, Jupiter also contains dozens of
smaller storm systems, which appear as white spots, and Saturn also
has similar storms, although they are less visible, Stone said.
   The major mystery of Jupiter's Great Red Spot is how the storm
has remained intact for centuries, while Earth's hurricanes break up
after a week or two, Ingersoll said.
   The absence of continents on giant gas planets like Jupiter and
Neptune may explain the persistence of the spots, he said, adding
that continents may help dissipate hurricanes on Earth.
   Computer simulations suggest smaller storms combine to form giant
storms such as the Red Spot and Neptune's dark spot, Stone and
Ingersoll said.
   Neptune is the solar system's fourth largest planet and usually
is the eighth planet from the sun. But because Pluto's elongated
elliptical orbit sometimes brings it closer to the sun, Neptune
currently is the ninth and most distant planet from the sun.

<HEAD>U.S. Proposes Free Elections Throughout Europe</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The United States proposed Monday that free
elections be adopted by all 35 member nations of the Conference on
Security and Cooperation in Europe.
   ``By introducing this proposal we are setting down a marker, we
are establishing a goal which we believe should be pursued
vigorously,'' said Congressman Steny H. Hoyer, D-Md., co-chairman of
the U.S. Commission on Security and Cooperation in Europe.
   He said the proposal ``challenges those participating states who
do not yet permit free elections to give their citizens the right to
freely participate in their own government.''
   He spoke at the month-long Conference on the Human Dimension,
which closes Friday.
   Over the past three weeks the delegations, meeting mainly in
closed sessions, have been calling to account nations accused of
human rights violations. Romania and Bulgaria have been frequent
targets.
   The finger-pointing technique is part of a process agreed to at a
meeting in January in Vienna of the Conference on Security and
Cooperation in Europe.
   The United States and Canada and all European countries except
Albania are members of CSCE.
   The U.S. proposal also calls for allowing citizens to establish
political parties and organizations, permitting individuals to seek
positions of public service and having elections observed by outside
governments, institutions or organizations.
   ``The yearning for democracy throughout the world ... is a fact
that is unstoppable,'' Hoyer told a news conference.
   He acknowledged that obtaining the needed consensus to adopt the
proposal was unlikely ``tomorrow,'' but said, ``We believe that the
winds of change for democracy are very, very powerful.''
   Morris B. Abram, head of the U.S. delegation, said that in the
United States the ``flow of moral authority is from the people up''
and with the free-election proposal ``we are demonstrating that the
crux of the whole human rights movement rests on that principle.''
   The Paris conference is the first of three CSCE human rights
meeting to be held in line with the 1975 Helsinki accords. Next
year's conference is to be in Copenhagen, and the third is scheduled
for Moscow in 1991.

<HEAD>Prosecutors Call for North Prison Term</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: INSERTS grafs 11-13 bgng: ``Despite this,'' with Walsh request
for cooperation and to note North's lawyer has not submitted a similar
memo yet.</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Iran-Contra prosecutors Monday asked the judge
to sentence Oliver North to prison, arguing that the former
presidential aide lied at his trial, shows no remorse and sees
himself as ``above the law and beyond reproach.''
   In a memo filed four days before North's sentencing, prosecutors
urged U.S. District Judge Gerhard A. Gesell to consider North's
``breach of public trust and misuse of public power, the destructive
effect of his criminal behavior on the functioning of government ...
his perjury and his total lack of remorse.''
   A prison term would also help counteract the political appeal
that North has gained on the lecture circuit _ a popularity that
prosecutors argued only ``reinforces his lack of remorse.''
   Independent counsel Lawrence E. Walsh charged that ``with supreme
faith in his ability to deceive, North took the witness stand and
perjured himself'' with a false story to explain away a charge that
he pocketed $4,300 in traveler's checks entrusted to him by a leader
of the Nicaraguan rebels.
   ``His unsupported claim that he had a $15,000 fund in a steel box
in his closet echoed the flimsy lies offered by corrupt municipal
officials in the days of Tammany Hall,'' Walsh said.
   ``North's attempt to use the steel box to explain his cash
purchase of a car in two installments graphically demonstrates
North's penchant for weaving a tale that by its conclusion is
preposterous.''
   The retired Marine lieutenant colonel faces a possible 10-year
sentence for aiding and abetting the obstruction of Congress,
destroying or mutilating government documents and accepting an
illegal gratuity _ a $13,800 security system outside his home that
was paid for by arms dealer Richard V. Secord.
   North, 45, was acquitted of nine other counts, including a charge
he stole the traveler's checks.
   Walsh did not make a specific recommendation of how many months
or years North should serve in prison.
   ``North's perjury represents another indication of his continuing
callous attitude toward the judicial process and our democratic
institutions,'' Walsh said.
   Despite this accusation, Walsh delivered an 11th-hour invitation
to North to cooperate with his investigation and testify against
former national security adviser John M. Poindexter and other
Iran-Contra defendants.
   ``The investigation of this office is not yet concluded. Despite
his dimninished credibility, North would still have a usefulness as
a witness if he were prepared to take the steps appropriate to such
a course,'' Walsh wrote.
   North's lawyer, Brendan V. Sullivan Jr., has not yet submitted a
sentencing memorandum of his own but is likely to do so soon.
   Throughout the 12-page sentencing memorandum, Walsh repeated the
theme that ``North has not indicated one iota of remorse for crimes
which, because of his position of public trust, jeopardized the
constitutional processes of government.''
   ``The arrogance that characterized North's exercise of power
before the investigation has been the hallmark of his reaction to
his indictment and conviction,'' Walsh said, noting North's comment
after the May 4 verdict that his vindication was not complete.
   ``Oliver North viewed and continues to view himself as being
above the law and beyond reproach,'' Walsh said.
   Walsh noted that during his testimony North said that ``not for
one fleeting moment'' did he think he was doing anything wrong by
helping prepare a false chronology of U.S.-Iran arms sales to show
congressional investigators.
   ``Certainly, he sees nothing wrong with lying to Congress, when
in view of himself and his superiors lying is necessary,'' the
independent counsel said.
   Walsh said the retired Marine lieutenant colonel's ``lack of
remorse is particularly troubling in view of the fact that he
continues to travel throughout the country, like a politician on the
stump, giving speeches and discoursing on his defiance of
Congress,'' Walsh said.
   ``The fact that this defendant is cultivating a popular
following, which reinforces his lack of remorse, makes it all the
more important for the court to underscore the gravity of North's
offenses by imposing a term of incarceration,'' said Walsh.
   The independent prosecutor also rejected the notion that North is
a scapegoat.
   ``He is a government official who must be held to account for the
legality and honesty of his own personal actions regardless of
whether others may also have transgressed the law and regardless of
the ends sought to be achieved,'' Walsh said.
   Walsh also disputed North's suggestion at the trial that he was
acting with the authorization of higher officials in the Reagan
administration.
   ``This society cannot tolerate government officials unwilling and
unable to exercise independent judgment and responsibility in
refusing to perform illegal acts,'' Walsh said. The sentence should
show that ``one cannot simply rely on real or imagined authorization
of illegal conduct and expect to escape responsibility,'' Walsh said.
   North's acceptance of the $13,800 security system from Secord, an
Iran-Contra co-defendant awaiting trial, shows ``venality in
financial matters.''
   Letting North go free without imprisonment ``would send exactly
the wrong message to government officials and to the public,'' Walsh
said. ``It would be a statement that 15 years after Watergate,
government officials can participate in a brazen cover-up, lie to
Congress and collect a substantial gratuity and still receive only a
slap on the wrist.''

   Here, at a glance, are highlights of actions
taken Monday by the Supreme Court.
   
   DRUG TESTS
   
   The court gave railroads broader power to test their workers for
drugs, upholding routine tests for Conrail employees.
   By a 7-2 vote, the justices said Conrail _ the Consolidated Rail
Corporation _ may require the tests without permitting collective
bargaining over the issue.
   The decision marks the first time the court has ruled on drug
testing by private employers. But the ruling is based on an
interpretation of the federal Railway Labor Act and may not have
sweeping impact for other workers.
   The case is Conrail vs. Railway Labor Executives, 88-1.
   
   CHRISTIAN SCIENTIST
   
   The court turned down an appeal by a California woman facing
criminal charges in her daughter's death because she tried to heal
the child through prayer rather than seeking medical help.
   The justices, without comment, refused to block the woman's trial
in Sacramento on charges of child-endangerment and involuntary
manslaughter.
   The case is Walker vs. Superior Court, 88-1471.
   
   BEER PRICES
   
   The court struck down a Connecticut law aimed at assuring that
beer sold in the state costs no more than it does in three
neighboring states.
   By a 6-3 vote, the court said such laws unconstitutionally
interfere with interstate commerce.
   The case is Healy vs. Beer Institute, 88-449.
   
   POWER RATES
   
   The court ruled unanimously that federal courts have authority to
referee some disputes over electric power rates between public
utilities and local or state regulatory agencies.
   The justices ordered a federal court to review a claim by New
Orleans Public Service Inc. (NOPSI), a utility seeking to pass on
$135 million in costs to its dustomers.
   The case is New Orleans Public Service vs. New Orleans City
Council, 88-348.
   
   WRITER
   
   The court turned down an appeal by Margaret Randall, a professor
and writer who has been threatened with deportation from the United
States for supporting communism.
   The court, without comment, left intact a ruling that it is
premature to consider the constitutional and legal issues she raised.
   The case is Randall vs. Thornburgh, 88-1412.
   
   ASBESTOS
   
   The court barred asbestos manufacturers from suing the government
to recover money they paid to a Navy shipyard worker injured by
inhaling the product.
   The court, without comment, rejected an appeal by two
manufacturers in a case from Washington state.
   The cases are Eagle-Picher vs. U.S., 88-1382, and Raymark vs.
U.S., 88-1418.
   
   MANDAL
   
   The court refused to reinstate former Maryland Gov. Marvin
Mandel's 1977 mail-fraud conviction, thrown out five years after he
completed a prison term.
   The court, without comment, rejected a Bush administration appeal
aimed at using Mandel's case to set guidelines on when someone may
challenge a fraud conviction for which the sentence already was
served.
   The case is U.S. vs. Mandel, 88-1759.
   
   MARSHALL ISLANDS
   
   The court barred additional U.S. compensation to inhabitants of
the Marshall Islands for nuclear weapon testing there more than 30
years ago.
   The court, without comment, let stand a ruling that threw out a
lawsuit by residents of the Pacific island republic.
   The case is People of Enewetak vs. U.S., 88-1466.
   
   LEGAL FEES
   
   The court, in a victory for civil rights lawyers and their
clients, upheld the award of more than $4 million in legal fees to
lawyers who won a Kansas City school desegregation suit.
   The justices, voting 8-0, ruled that paralegals, law clerks and
recent law school graduates are entitled to compensation at the
market rate for their work.
   By a separate 5-3 vote, the court said states that lose such
cases may be forced to pay extra money to civil rights attorneys as
compensation for a delay in payment.
   The case is Missouri vs. Jenkins, 88-64.
   
   POLLUTION FINE
   
   The court left intact a fine of nearly $1 million against a
Maryland paper mill operator that failed to comply with a federal

   The case is Simkins vs. Sierra Club, 88-660.

<HEAD>U.S. Apologizes After in Icelandic Flags Incident</HEAD>
<DATELINE>REKJAVIK, Iceland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The United States apologized to Iceland
for the behavior of three U.S. soldiers who were arrested and
accused of cutting down and stealing 17 Icelandic flags, the Foreign
Ministry said Monday.
   It said the U.S. Embassy also apologized to the ambassadors of
China, Czechoslovakia and East Germany whose flags were also cut
down and stolen last Saturday, the 45th anniversary of Iceland's
independence and its national day.
   The ministry said the three newly arrived soldiers also were
charged with driving while intoxicated.
   Police said the three, who were not identified, were arrested
Saturday night near Hafnarfjoerdur, about 12 miles south of
Reykjavik, while allegedly drunk and speeding. The flags, cut from
flagpoles all over Reykjavik and some neighboring communities, were
found in their car, police said.
   ``This is an insult to Iceland,'' said Foreign Minister Jon
Baldvin Hannibalsson.
   Prime Minister Steingrimur Hermansson condemned the incident and
said, ``This is bound to affect people's attitude toward the defense
force.''
   Under the NATO treaty, the United States is responsible for
Iceland's defense and about 3,300 American servicemen based here
comprise the Iceland Defense Force.
   Hannibalsson said the three would probably be court martialed and
could face six months in jail, dishonorable discharge, and lose
their pay for a year.
   The incident follows last month's formal protest by Iceland to
the United States that a farewell speech by Rear Adm. Eric McVadon,
the U.S. military commander in Iceland, violated the U.S.-Icelandic
defense agreement and interfered in the country's internal affairs.

   Elmo Camoes, president of Brazil's
Central Bank, turned in his resignation Monday to President Jose
Sarne following a major stock market scandal, a bank official said.
   ``The request was informal and Camoes will deliver an official
letter of resignation on Tuesday or Wednesday,'' said the source,
who spoke on the condition he not be identified.
   He said Sarney accepted Camoes' resignation but had not decided
on a successor.
   The scandal evolved after Naji Nahas, a multimillionaire stock
market investor, bought stock worth $31 million through various
brokerage houses on June 9.
   One check for $8.8 million in local currency issued to a
brokerage house was returned for lack of funds. Trading at the stock
markets in Rio and Sao Paul, Brazil's largest, dropped sharply.
   The source said Camoes' son is the director of another brokerage
house in which Camoes has a controlling interest, and that this
house made ``a number of risky investments. The firm is in trouble
as a result of liquidity problems generated by the fall in the
market.'
   Camoes delivered a note to the news media Monday saying he would
not come to the brokerage house's rescue.

   A school board voted unanimously
Monday night to appeal a circuit judge's ruling that it improperly
dismissed a veteran math teacher who refused to wear a tie to class.
   All five Mason County School Board members voted to appeal the
decision objecting to the firing of Bill Webb, a 46-year-old math
teacher from Gallipolis, Ohio, to the West Virginia Supreme Court.
   ``I'm not upset that it will be appealed,'' Webb said before the
board vote.
   ``I've felt from the beginning that what they did was wrong,''
said Webb, whose typical school clothes consisted of the blue jeans
and flannel shirts he wears while operating his Gallia County, Ohio,
farm and body shop across the river from Point Pleasant.
   After the meeting, board president Emma Kearns said the panel
made short shrift of the appeal because board members were unanimous
in firing Webb last December.
   She referred further questions to board attorney Diane Johnson,
who had discussed the circuit court decision with board members at a
hearing last week.
   ``I told them of the court's decision and my recommendation was
to appeal,'' Johnson said.
   Superintendent Charles Chambers imposed a new dress code last
summer, after teachers had signed work contracts for the new school
year, and suspended Webb three times when the 19-year teacher
refused to comply with its orders to wear a tie and dress pants.
   Webb was fired Dec. 19 on a charge of gross insubordination.
   Webb appealed his firing and earlier suspensions. On June 7,
Circuit Judge Charlie King ruled Webb had the right to disobey the
dress code developed by the superintendent because the latter had no
right to develop a code separate from the board.
   King also ordered the board to give Webb 11 days' back pay and
pay $1,000 in legal fees.
   After the legality of Chambers' code came into question, the
board adopted a policy that made ties optional but still banned
teachers from wearing denim or blue jeans.
   Board members, however, maintain that Webb still deserved to
fired for insubordination.
   Board attorney Johnson had previously notified the West Virginia
Supreme Court of its intent to appeal but formal board action was
required.
   Webb said Monday he didn't expect to return to the Mason County
school system for that and other reasons.
   ``I can't see going back with the hard feelings that are there,''
Webb said. ``I've had friends that I've known for 20 years that
don't talk to me anymore.
   ``People see me coming and they walk right past me. I don't need
that in my life.''

   Socialist and environmentalist
candidates in several nations and extreme rightists in West Germany
were the major winners in elections for the 12-nation European
Parliament, vote results showed Monday.
   The Socialists took 182 seats in the elections, remaining the
largest group in the 518-member assembly that meets in Strasbourg,
France. They picked up 16 seats, 13 from Britain, where Laborites
trounced Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher's Conservatives.
   Greens, who focus on environmental issues and often vote along
the same lines as the Socialists, won 17 more seats to take their
total to 37. And although Communists lost seven seats, their total
of 41 was still enough to take the three left-wing parties to a
majority of 260.
   Contrasting the left's performance was a rise in extreme
rightists, who won 23 seats in the consultative body, up seven.
   West Germany's Republican Party, led by Franz Schoenhuber, a
66-year-old former Waffen-SS soldier, entered the assembly with at
least six seats.
   He called the showing of his party, which campaigned for cuts in
the number of foreign workers and a stop to the influx of asylum
seekers, as ``the biggest sensation of the postwar era.''
   In the European Parliament, his party will join France's
like-minded National Front Party of Jean-Marie Le Pen, which held on
to its 10 seats, and four extreme right-wingers from Italy.
   The biggest loser was Mrs. Thatcher's Conservatives, who lost 13
of their 45 seats to Labor. Labor surged from 32 to 45 seats, giving
Mrs. Thatcher her first defeat in a national ballot since taking
power a decade ago and fueling charges that her free-market
revolution is no longer working.
   ``The results were disappointing, but we shall renew our efforts
for next time,'' she said.
   In West Germany, the ARD-TV network called the victory by the
extreme-right ``a warning signal for our democracy.''
   The leader of the West German Jewish community, Heinz Galinski,
called the vote a ``sad confirmation of a alarming trend of
right-wing extremism'' in the nation.
   ``I am not satisfied with the vote result,'' said Chancellor
Helmut Kohl, whose Christian Democrats and the Bavarian sister
party, the Social Christians, fell from 34 to 32 seats.
   West German Greens looked set to win eight seats, an increase of
one.
   While the makeup of the Parliament, especially the allocation of
seats for small parties, must still be completed, near-final results
gave this picture of election results in other EEC nations:
   In Greece, the Conservative New Democracy party, which beat Prime
Minister Andreas Papandreou's governing Socialist PASOK party in
national balloting, won 10 seats, up one. PASOK dropped from 10
seats to eight.
   In France, President Francois Mitterrand's Socialists won two
seats, going to 22. The center-right coalition of former President
Valery Giscard d'Estaing outdistanced the Socialists, capturing 26
seats. The National Front was third with 10 seats, and the French
Green Party entered the assembly for the first time with nine seats.
   In Italy, the Socialists went from 12 to 14 seats and the
Christian Democrats held steady at 27 seats. The Communists dropped
five of their 27 seats but remained the country's second largest
party.
   Italy's two Green parties won seven seats, a gain of two.
   In Spain, Prime Minister Felipe Gonzalez's Socialists lost a
seat, dropping to 27. The opposition Conservatives fell from 17 to
15 and the Communists picked up one seat for a total of four. Green
candidates won two seats.
   Danish Prime Minister Poul Schlueter's Conservatives lost two of
their four seats while the opposition Socialists won two, giving
them five seats.
   The governing Christian Democrats in Belgium and the Netherlands
won seven and 10 seats, gains of one and two seats respectively.
   In Brussels, Christian Democrat Leo Tindemans resigned as
Belgium's foreign affairs minister Monday. He said last week he
would seek the job of European Parliament president.
   Voting in the European elections took place in Spain, Britain,
Denmark, the Netherlands and Ireland on Thursday. On Sunday, people
voted in the other EEC nations _ Belgium, West Germany, Greece,
France, Luxembourg, Italy and Portugal.
   The European Parliament is elected every five years. This year,
142 million Europeans cast a ballot.
   Throughout the European Economic Community, about 58.7 percent of
220 million Europeans eligible voted, down from 61 percent in the
1984 elections.
   They voted for 7,126 candidates from 178 national political
parties.
   The Parliament meets one week each month in Strasbourg.
   Recent polls have shown that many of the 325 million people in
the EEC consider the Parliament little more than a debating society,
but reforms adopted in July 1987 give it more power.
   It can veto some EEC treaties with other countries; amend or
reject the annual budget; fire the EEC's 17-member Executive
Commission; and delay an opinion on proposed laws, thus preventing
them from taking effect.

   An illuminated 15th-century French manuscript book
sold Monday night for $2,898,500, the second-highest price ever paid
for a manuscript at auction, Sotheby's said.
   The manuscript from the collection of the late Maj. J. R. Abbey,
known as the Monypenny Breviary, was made for William Monypenny of
Ardwenny in Scotland who was an abbot in France. It was created for
him by two of the best-known French manuscript painters of the
period, a father and son named Jean and Jacquelin de Montlucon, who
worked in Bourges.
   Sotheby's spokeswoman Deste Bond said the French dealer who
bought it, a Monsieur Beres, paid the highest price for a French
manuscript. The record auction price for any manuscript was the
$12.4 million paid at Sotheby's in 1983 for the Gospels of Henry the
Lion.
   Also sold by the auction house Monday night was a manuscript
described as the last important royal English manuscript in private
hands, a book of hours, or prayerbook, made for Margaret, Duchess of
Clarence, a sister-in-law of King Henry V of England. London dealer
Sam Fogg paid $443,300, the spokeswoman said.
   It, too, was part of the collection assembled by Abbey, a
Brighton brewery owner who died in 1969. His collection of
manuscripts was so large and important that the sale by Sotheby's
has been spread over more than 20 years and divided into 11
auctions, of which this was the last.

   Most American middle schools are too large and
impersonal to meet adolescents' intellectual and emotional needs,
and the result for many students may be a ``life on the edge of
society,'' according to a new report.
   Middle grade schools could be a strong positive influence on
adolescents as they face a world in which they are tempted to
experiment with alcohol, sex and drugs, according to the report by a
task force of the Carnegie Council on Adolescent Development.
   Instead, ``many large middle grade schools function as mills that
contain and process endless streams of students. Within them are
masses of anonymous youth,'' said the study. ``Such settings
virtually guarantee that the intellectual and emotional needs of
youth will go unmet.''
   The report, titled ``Turning Points: Preparing American Youth for
the 21st Century,'' was released Sunday on the first day of a
three-day meeting sponsored by the Carnegie Corp. of New York to
focus on ways to improve mid-level schools.

   A poll has found most Americans believe
standardized tests fail to measure how well pupils learn, and fear
that schoolchildren are being taught facts without absorbing them.
   To improve education, majorities in the Media General-Associated
Press survey supported greater spending and taxes and increased
competition among public schools. A sizable minority supported the
notion of year-round classes.
   School competition, through programs allowing parents to choose
which public schools their children attend, is a cornerstone of
President Bush's education policy. Bush has questioned whether
greater spending is needed.
   After a decade in which the back-to-basics movement swept the
nation's schools, 52 percent in the poll said their local schools do
an adequate job teaching basic facts and skills. But just 39 percent
gave the schools good marks for teaching pupils how to think and
reason.

   Big-city mayors are backing an outright
ban on possession of semiautomatic assault weapons as part of their
demand for a broader attack on the nation's drug and crime problems.
   A resolution calling for legislation far beyond President Bush's
more limited steps against semiautomatics won unanimous approval
Sunday from a resolutions committee of the U.S. Conference of Mayors.
   It appeared headed for approval from the full group of more than
200 mayors before their conference concludes Wednesday.
   ``It helps the Congress to have the backing they need to go
forward, and to realize there are more people out there in the
cities than are in the NRA,'' said Mayor Barbara Fass of Stockton,
Calif., who sponsored the call for a ban on possession of the
weapons.

   As important elections loom, charges that Prime

   ``Personally, I think that if the report is true he should

   ``It could come to us pressing for that, but we won't decide what
course of action to take until he explains himself.''

<HEAD>Akira Kurosawa Shares His Dreams</HEAD>

<DATELINE>HOTAKA, Japan (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A cluster of thatched huts and watermills
sits beside a stream in central Japan. Amid watery fields of green
mustard mirroring snow-capped peaks, Akira Kurosawa's legendary
insistence on perfection is evident.
   It is the set of ``Village of the Watermills,'' a sequence in the
award-winning filmmaker's latest movie, ``Dreams.'' And the scene
depicts one of his most pleasant visions.
   Kurosawa has spent 46 years using his genius as a film director,
editor and writer to create painfully realistic portrayals of human
nature. In ``Dreams,'' he bares his vivid imagination to reach
modern Japanese audiences in a way he hasn't for decades.
   ``The feelings which lie sleeping in our hearts, the secret hopes
which we keep hidden deep inside, and the dark wishes and fears ...
manifest themselves honestly in our dreams,'' says the 79-year-old
director.
   ``Dreams'' is a series of nine episodes Kurosawa has envisioned
in his lifetime, ranging from life in an idyllic village to a
terrifying nightmare of nuclear holocaust _ images likely to move
Japanese viewers in a more personal way than some of the director's
other recent films.
   Kurosawa's 1980 epic war film, ``Kagemusha,'' won top honors at
the Cannes Film Festival, and several of his other movies have won
international critical acclaim. Since the mid-1960s, however, those
films, with their uncompromising intellectual complexity and somber
tone, have been spurned by the Japanese film industry, which tends
to favor cute animal stories and gangster films.
   After ``Dodeskaden'' flopped in 1970, Kurosawa went through a
period of ill health and depression that culminated in a suicide
attempt in 1971. His next movie, ``Dersu Uzala'' in 1975, was
produced and financed in the Soviet Union. Ever since, Kurosawa has
financed his movies outside Japan. ``Dreams'' is no exception.
   Steven Spielberg's Amblin Entertainment, in cooperation with
George Lucas' Industrial Light and Magic-Lucas Co., are supplying
approximately $10.7 million in production costs for ``Dreams.''
   Warner Bros. will distribute the film in the United States, where
it is tentatively scheduled for a Christmas release.
   Kurosawa is notorious for his volatile temper. He was god-humored
and patient, however, as he relaxed in the warm May sunshine after a
day's shooting on the set of ``Village of the Watermills.''
   Large blue and green reflectors are shifted to and fro to capture
the sunlight. Men in wetsuits splash through a stream swollen by
melting snow, arranging water plants and snagging trash before it
floats by. Other crew members scramble up and down banks, organizing
the foliage just so.
   Finally, the sun breaks out of the clouds.
   ``Start!'' assistant director Takashi Koizumi shouts.
   A gaily costumed funeral procession dances along the tree-lined
path beside the stream, accompanied by musicians playing drums,
flutes and cymbals.
   ``Cut!'' says Kurosawa. ``One more time!''
   Jeans-clad Akira Terao, who plays Kurosawa in all but two of the
dreams, stands patiently as scattered flower petals are collected
and dancers return to position. A crane lifts a tree branch higher
out of the way.
   ``We'll do the real shooting now,'' Kurosawa says.
   As Terao, who has wandered into a strange village, watches the
procession, an elderly man in a straw hat and orange apron, played
by Chishu Ryu, explains that the villagers are celebrating, rather
than mourning, the death of a 99-year-old woman who has led a
fulfilling life.
   ``Something strange floated down the river. Do it again,''
Kurosawa shouts.
   Kurosawa began his career in 1943 amid censorship and economic
limitations imposed by World War II. In his memoirs, he says he
learned to thrive under restrictions from deadlines and budgets,
which forced him to develop new techniques.
   To film quickly and effectively, he began the innovative use of
two or more cameras on every set. Here, there are two on platforms,
one in a tree and one above a mustard field.
   Kurosawa's actors rehearse repeatedly until he feels they are
camera-ready.
   The director edits his films as they are shot and shows them to
his staff only after the first cuts are made. He mastered most of
the skills of filmmaking, including scriptwriting and set design,
and exercises almost total control, says producer Yoshio Inoue.
   Long hours in the darkroom have made Kurosawa's eyes sensitive to
light, obliging him to wear his trademark sunglasses and cap.
   Kurosawa walks slowly and his hands shake ever so slightly as he
lights a cigarette, but he remains tall and hearty, clad in
sneakers, faded jeans and a blue-striped shirt.
   He balks at discussing his films, saying they should speak for
themselves. But the idea behind ``Dreams'' is clear: ``Human hearts
have been lost along with nature. I am nostalgic for a good
environment and good hearts.
   ``This is a beautiful spot, a very gorgeous river. But we had to
look all over Japan to find a river like this. That's how much
nature is lost,'' he says. ``It's really sad.''
   In other vignettes, the movie depicts dreams of fairy tales, a
blizzard, a dark tunnel of madness. He imagines stepping into a
painting of Vincent Van Gogh, played by Martin Scorsese, and meeting
the artist himself.
   He left out one puzzling dream about a hippopatamus walking
through a sliding door, he says.
   The most terrifying nightmare, perhaps, is ``Mount Fuji in Red,''
showing the dreamer stranded in hellish confusion as the great
volcano melts down after a nuclear plant explosion.
   With assistance from George Lucas' production company, Kurosawa
will use special effects for the first time in the Mount Fuji
sequence.
   In ``Dreams'' Kurosawa once again shares his philosophy of
humanism, described by friend and translator Audie Bock as the
belief that, ``man must fight to retain hope in the midst of this
hopeless world, and in this fight all men are brothers.''
   Kurosawa's most ``wonderful dream'' shows television announcers
shouting that world peace has finally come.
   Despite its foreign funding and universal themes, ``Dreams'' is
directed mainly at Japan.
   ``I'd like to fix Japan,'' he says.
   The government is ``despicable,'' he says, and the Japanese film
industry is only concerned with making money.
   ``The movie business is in terrible shape. Directors only make
what they think will sell. They need to come up with good films that
people will love,'' he says.
   Kurosawa already has an idea for his next film, but won't discuss
it.
   ``Someone might steal it,'' he says. ``If it's good, that's OK,
but I usually wouldn't like the results.
   ``I hope to stay healthy and keep working up to 103 years old.
It's really fun. I really enjoy doing this. All films are dreams for
a director.''

   There are only two more weeks of shooting on Federico
Fellini's movie, and he is still not sure what it's about.
   ``It's different from my other films,'' he says, sitting in a
dark, cavernous studio and frowning into space. ``It doesn't have a
story.''
   Some people _ Fellini, for example _ might say Fellini films
never have a story. Or, if there is one, he isn't going to tell you.
   The director of ``La Strada,'' ``8{'' and ``Amarcord'' says his
new film deals with the countryside, with reality, with the lunacies
in contemporary society. ``It began with just a glimmer. I didn't
know, I still don't know, what this film is.''
   ``La Voce della Luna'' (``The Voice of the Moon'') is the 24th
movie by the legendary Italian director, who captured the soul of
Italy in the early 1960s in ``La Dolce Vita'' and led filmmaking
into a new world of fantasy.
   He is now 69, white-haired but still bearlike, his eyes gazing
intensely from a big, jowly head; his husky frame dominating the set.
   ``It has been very tiring,'' he says, lowering himself into a
canvas chair. ``Not only working without a script, but without a
subject, too.''
   The ideas behind the film had been brewing in his mind for a long
time: a tale about the Don Quixotes of the world, about the Tyl
Ulenspiegls. (``You Americans ought to read something sometime,'' he
advises someone unfamiliar with the happy-go-lucky Flemish folk
hero.)
   The catalyst came when he bought the novel ``Il Poema dei
Lunatici'' (``The Poem of the Lunatics'') by Ermanno Cavazzoni.
   ``I immediately forgot it in a taxi,'' he recalls. ``In three or
four days, the taxi driver sent it to me with a note. He said, `I
started to read this and I didn't understand a thing.'
   ``So I thought I had to read it.''
   The novel tells of Savini, a man who hears voices from wells, and
a village prefect, who together travel the countryside, meeting a
fantastic assortment of animals and historical figures. Savini
personifies the creative side of lunacy; the prefect, the
bureaucratic.
   ``It (the book) communicated to me something very lovely: people
in a real situation which was at the same time transparent, and
through it you could see another and another reality,'' Fellini
said. ``It was a game of transparencies.''
   However, he took only ``vibrations'' from the book.
   As for the rest of the inspiration, there was Reggiolo, the town
he created at Rome's Pontini Studios and that appears to have
existed in his mind for some time. It is a contemporary Italian
town, Fellini-style, with an ancient brick tower under restoration,
a supermodern glass church and a gallery of stores selling lace
panties, computers and hand grenades.
   ``After the village was finished, I needed inhabitants, and
gradually the inhabitants arrived,'' says Fellini, his eyes
narrowing behind his black-rimmed glasses as he gazes into his
fantasy world.
   As he imagined more and more people to go with the village, the
imaginary townspeople began to suggest ideas for the film.
   ``I have been listening to the townspeople,'' he states
matter-of-factly.
   He is not sure how it will end. But for that matter, he is not
sure how it has been going all along.
   ``It's about the countryside, the real one that I remember from
my childhood, and a fantastic one ... that I tried to put in some
films: ``La Strada,'' ``Amarcord'' _ films with more of a narrative
structure.
   ``This gave me the chance to leave that. It liberated me more
from stories, psychologies, situations, conclusions.''
   True to his usual pattern, Fellini still has to make up the
dialogue for the film. It will be dubbed in in the months ahead, as
he cuts and edits. The movie, produced by Mario and Vittorio Cecchi
Gori at a cost of about $14 million, is due out in October.
   Fellini is working with several old collaborators, including
Tullio Pinelli, who helped create the stories and screenplays of
``La Strada'' and ``La Dolce Vita,'' and Dante Ferretti, who
designed the sets for ``City of Women'' and ``Ginger and Fred.''
   But there are many new faces, chiefly the principal actors,
Roberto Benigni and Paolo Villaggio, two of Italy's top comic
artists. Benigni is known outside Italy for playing the immigrant in
Jim Jarmusch's ``Down by Law.''
   Despite the presence of the comedians, Fellini says the film is
not simply comedy. It is not autobiography. It is not about
insanity, as such.
   ``It doesn't seem like any of my other films,'' he shrugs happily.

   Vietnam, Cambodia and Laos are beckoning
foreign tourists to their temples, beaches and battlefields in hopes
of accumulating dollars and other hard currencies to strengthen
their ailing economies.
   Recent reforms have greatly loosened travel to and within the
three communist-governed nations, long sealed off by wars and
suspicious officialdom.
   Some U.S. war veterans have returned to Vietnam in recent years
to visit battlefields where they fought the Viet Cong and North
Vietnamese, and Vietnam would like to see more of the 2.7 million
who served return. But U.S. sanctions might prevent that.
   West Europeans are going to Angkor, Cambodia's ancient capital,
and tour groups are flying to the former royal capital of Luang
Prabang in Laos.
   ``The potential is tremendous,'' said H.P. Tuggener who operates
a travel agency in Bangkok, Thailand. ``The demand will be far
greater than they can absorb in the next few years. It's been closed
for so long there are thousands just waiting to get in.''
   Tuggener, who has been involved in Indochina tourism for several
decades, said in Bangkok that shortages of hotels, aircraft, tour
guides and other services will hold back large-scale tourism. Hanoi,
for example, currently has 671 hotel beds compared to 24,000 in Hong
Kong and 25,600 in Bangkok, Thailand's capital.
   ``Our policy now is to be more open, to receive more guests,''
said tourism official Nguyen Cuong Hien. ``But I can tell you,
Vietnam as a tourist destination is virgin land.''
   Vietnam and Cambodia come under the U.S. Trading with the Enemy
Act, which means Americans can go to those two countries but cannot
spend money there. The intent is to keep U.S. dollars from flowing
into the economies of countries still considered enemies. Laos is
not affected since the United States never broke relations with it.
   The U.S. Treasury Department last year also made it illegal for
Americans ``to arrange, promote or facilitate group or individual
tours or travel'' to any country listed under the Trading With the
Enemy Act. Others on the list are Cuba and North Korea.
   Under its new regulations, the Treasury Department has said it
intended to prosecute two veterans _ Donald Mills and John Myers of
Akron, Ohio, members of the Vietnam Veterans of America _ who have
organized six tours for veterans since 1984 in a program to heal
``old, deep wounds.'' The American Civil Liberties Union maintains
Treasury's regulations violate the veterans' First Amendment rights
and says it will defend them if they are prosecuted.
   On June 14, a U.S. federal court in Bridgeport, Conn., penalized
Lindblad Travel Inc. of Westport, Conn., a total of $75,000 for
offering tours to Vietnam and Cambodia.
   Exempt from the U.S. sanctions are journalists, scholars or
others who have a professional interest in the two countries.
   In 1988, some 42,000 travelers came to Indochina, in contrast to
neighboring Thailand's 4.2 million. But projections are all upward,
with Vietnam expecting 100,000 largely ``capitalist tourists'' by
1990, compared with 40,000 last year. Tourist visas, which once took
up to three months to get, are generally in hand within a week.
   Among the poorest in the world, the Indochinese nations hope
tourist income will help revive their economies. Hard currency fever
is spreading rapidly.
   ``Dollars, dollars,'' chanted a taxi driver at Hanoi airport,
unable to come up with any other English words. At Angkor, Cambodian
officials are charging some of the highest entrance fees in the
world: $120 to get into two major temples; transportation, food and
tour-guide fees are extra.
   Vietnam, Hien said, earned $57 million from tourism last year,
but it received about 60 applications from 17 countries for
investment in the tourism sector.
   Hien said a West German company will build a 14-story hotel in
Hanoi while a French-Indonesian group is set to overhaul the Thong
Nhat, an atmospheric but quickly fading relic of French colonial
days. Others are eyeing Vietnam's often stunning, 1,860-mile
coastline and Ho Chi Minh City, the dynamic southern economic hub
once called Saigon.
   Hien, who heads a department in the National Tourism Agency,
stressed that standards of service also had to be radically
improved. There are plans to send tourism employees to the West for
training, while the country's foreign investment code allows foreign
management of hotels.
   Cambodia's top draw is Angkor, a complex of magnificent temples
dating to the 9th century. There are four other official tourist
destinations but a continuing guerrilla war puts large areas of the
country off-limits. Only 1,500 tourists came last year, but just a
few years ago there were none.
   With prospects for a peace settlement, talks have been initiated
for air links between Phnom Penh, the capital, and points like
Bangkok, Tokyo and Hong Kong. Phnom Penh's hotels are being
refurbished, including the elegant Cambodiana on the Tonle Sap
River, which is slated to have 200 of its 388 rooms ready by the end
of the year.
   Although fewer than 600 tourists visited Laos in the first six
months of this year, the easy, overland access from Thailand gives
it a decided advantage.
   Travel agencies are offering group packages, such as a six-day,
$590-a-person tour that includes stays in the capital, Vientiane,
and Luang Prabang, a temple-studded retreat nestled in a valley of
the Mekong River.

<HEAD>The Eucalyptus Tree Stirs Anger in Portugal and Spain</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TONY SMITH</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>MIRANDELA, Portugal (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Ecologists and farmers in Portugal and
Spain are at war against spreading eucalyptus trees. The enemy is a
paper pulp industry that encourages planting more and more of them.
   Eucalyptus plantations are sprouting up rapidly in the two
countries as the industry seeks a secure supply of the raw material
it will need to meet the demand for paper as the European Economic
Community lowers trade barriers in 1992.
   But farmers and ecologists claim eucalyptus trees drink up too
much water from the soil, endangering traditional olive trees,
chestnut trees and other nut-bearing trees. They also maintain the
trees cause land erosion that kills off undergrowth vital to the
survival of brown bears and other wildlife.
   Cellulose producers dispute claims the trees are harmful. They
say eucalyptus trees grow fast and are ideally suited to Iberian
soil and climate and that plantations will provide more export
revenue and create jobs.
   The arguments are passionate and tempers run high. In March,
protestors in the Portuguese town of Valpacos clashed with police
when farmers tried to rip up eucalyptus seedlings from a 396-acre
private plantation.
   The region is Portugal's poorest.
   ``We stopped them planting more eucalyptus at Valpacos,'' said
olive grower Joao Silva. ``If they try anywhere else ... we'll do
the same again, but worse.
   ``If they want to plant eucalyptus, they should plant where
there's plenty water. ... Here we don't even have enough to drink.''
   Environmentalists claim the eucalyptus, first brought from
Australia in the late 1800s, can turn fertile land into desert.
   ``The eucalyptus consumes more water than almost any other tree
and impedes other plants from growing nearby,'' said Santiago Martin
Barajas, vice president of the Federation of Spanish Wildlife
Protection Groups.
   ``Portugal's interior, already poor, is being turned into a giant
eucalyptus plantation and more people are moving toward the coast,
leaving villages deserted,'' said Serafim Riem, a spokesman for
Portuguese ecology group Quercus.
   The European Economic Community, which faces a paper shortage,
imports $19.5 billion worth of wood annually.
   Timber and pulp command high prices, and this encourages
landowners to plant eucalyptus, which can be 12 years, about half
the time of more traditional trees.
   ``Eucalyptus for us is green crude oil,'' said Luis Mira Amaral,
industry and energy minister for Portugal, where wood pulp, paper
and cellulose account for 8 percent of yearly export earnings.
   Spanish environmentalists fear the EEC will subsidize massive
eucalyptus plantings in northern Spain, where the mix of Atlantic
and Mediterranean climates favors growth.
   Portuguese landowners already tap EEC funds via the government's
Forestry Action Program (PAF). While assistance to traditional tree
planters is higher, PAF pays up to 30 percent of project costs for
small-scale eucalyptus plantations.
   ``Portugal has no other vocation,'' said Eliseu Baena, forestry
director at Caima, one of Portugal's big four cellulose producers.
   ``If landowners want to restore their lands, they're going to do
it with a profitable crop.''
   Baena added that Portugal doesn't make full use of it's 10.4
million acres of high-grade farmland, so there's no reason not to
use lower-quality land for cash-crops like eucalyptus.
   He acknowledges that eucalyptus trees should be planted away from
springs or rivers but refutes ecologists' claims that they erode
soil or kill off undergrowth vital to wildlife.
   Antonio Navas, deputy director of Spain's Institute for Wildlife
Preservation (ICONA), suggests the environmentalists might be poorly
informed.
   ``There hasn't been a clear debate,'' he said. ``The eucalyptus
is blamed for causing diseases _ for being malignant.''
   Said Baena: ``I think as much as half of Portugal's land could be
forested _ and 30 percent of that could be planted with eucalyptus.''
   According to Lisbon's General Directorate for Forestry,
eucalyptus trees make up only 11.3 percent of Portugal's forests, or
about 4 percent of the country's total land area of 35,600 square
miles.
   But Portugal is planting more eucalyptus than any other tree. It
accounts for 75 percent of all PAF projects approved since May,
1988, or under consideration.
   Spain officially registers 495,000 acres of eucalyptus, but Navas
said the actual total is probably double that.
   Rui Tadeu, a teacher-farmer in Tras-os-Montes in the Valpacos
region, says landowners don't need eucalyptus to make money.
   He produces nuts, honey and port wine, which bring a high return,
and plans to convert a derelict farm building into a hunting and
tourist lodge.
   ``The pulp producers promise more jobs from eucalyptus, but most
of the process is mechanized, so the jobs are few and mainly in
factories away from the country,'' he said.

<HEAD>They're Back: Networks Schedule Two Western Series For Fall</HEAD>
<HEAD>With LaserPhoto</HEAD>

   The television Western, as rootless as a
steely-eyed gunslinger, has drifted back into town, and there are
two on the networks' fall schedules, the first time that's happened
in 15 years.
   CBS' ``Paradise,'' starring Lee Horsley as a 1890s gunfighter who
has to care for his late sister's four children, is returning for a
second season.
   ABC is adding a new show called ``The Kid,'' about the youngsters
who rode for the Pony Express in the days before the railroads were
completed coast to coast.
   This past season the CBS miniseries ``Lonesome Dove'' proved that
audiences will watch a well-made drama, even if it's in Western
dress. The eight-hour miniseries, based on the Pulitzer
Prize-winning book by Larry McMurtry, was the highest-rated
multi-part movie of the 1988-89 season.
   ``Paradise'' is a family drama set against the background of the
Old West. Horsley plays Ethan Allen Cord, a fugitive gunslinger who
inherits his dying sister's children. She had sent them to him in
the mistaken belief that he was the upstanding proprietor of a
general store.
   ``The Kid'' attempts to blend the traditional Western story with
a youthful twist, the way the movie ``Young Guns'' did. The young
Pony Express riders find themselves bound into a family because of
the common jeopardy they face. Sounds like a Western version of ``21
Jump Street.''
   The renewal of ``Paradise'' is the first time a Western series
has been renewed by a network since ``Kung Fu,'' an ``Eastern
Western'' that ran on ABC from 1972-75.
   The networks haven't had two Western series on the air at the
same time since 1974, when ``Kung Fu'' was on ABC and ``Gunsmoke''
was in its last season on CBS.
   The Western, once as firm a television fixture as the sitcom,
dominated television in the 1950s.
   ``Gunsmoke,'' as traditional as they come, lasted for 20 years.
It was the highest-rated show from 1957 to 1961. In 1958-59, the top
of the Nielsen ratings were dominated by Westerns. ``Gunsmoke'' was
No. 1, ``Wagon Train'' was second, ``Have Gun, Will Travel'' third
and ``The Rifleman'' fourth. Others in the Top 10 that year were
``Maverick,'' ``Tales of Wells Fargo'' and ``The Life and Legend of
Wyatt Earp.''
   NBC's ``Wagon Train,'' another traditional Western, was the most
popular show in 1961-62, NBC's ``Bonanza,'' somewhat less
traditional, was No. 1 from 1964 to '67. ``Gunsmoke'' remained
popular until the end of its run, but since then, no Western series
has attracted a large audience.
   The Western didn't back down without a fight. Since the decline
of the Western series in the early 1970s, the networks have tried at
least nine shows. Even more if you expand the genre to include such
frontier shows as ``Young Dan'l Boone,'' ``Father Murphy,'' and
``The New Land,'' or the contemporary, Western-oriented night-time
soap ``Yellow Rose.''
   Television has rarely attempted a traditional Western story in
recent years. Most had a gimmick. In ``The Barbary Coast,'' on ABC
in 1976, William Shatner was an undercover agent for the California
governor, and Doug McClure, owner of a San Francisco casino, was his
ally. One of the most outrageous concepts was CBS' 1986 ``Outlaws,''
in which a Texas sheriff and a gang of outlaws were blasted into the
20th century by a bolt of lightning.
   It's been argued that today's audience doesn't relate to Westerns
and that they get their excitement from police shows. It's also
suggested that the Western concept has taken a new form, such as the
space operas ``Star Trek'' or ``Star Wars.''
   It seems more likely, however, that audiences don't relate to
gimmicks. ``Lonesome Dove,'' a traditional story with a strong cast,
was welcomed by viewers. The NBC movie series ``Desperado,'' created
by novelist Elmore Leonard, also does well in the ratings.
   Besides the networks, cable has gotten into the act. The CBN
Family Channel has a half-hour weekly Western, ``Bordertown.'' The
show, filmed on location near Vancouver, Canada, stars Richard Comar
as a U.S. marshal, John Brennan as a Canadian mounted policeman and
Sophie Barjac as Marie Dumont.

   FREDDY'S BACK _ The syndicated horror series ``Freddy's
Nightmares'' will return in the fall with 22 new episodes from
Warner Bros. Television. Robert Englund stars as Freddy Krueger, the

``A Nightmare on Elm Street 5: The Dream Child,'' fifth in the film
series, will open on 2,000 screens.

<HEAD>Is The First-Time Homebuyer Dead or Alive?</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN CUNNIFF</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Analyst</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Here is a survey that threatens to undermine one
of the most popular and cherished notions of real estate analysts _
that the percentage of first-time homebuyers shrinks as interest
rates and prices rise.
   The notion has been so readily accepted in recent years that it
has become esteemed as theory, just one step from becoming law.
Common sense seemed to support it and still seems to.
   Doesn't it make sense to expect first-timers to drop out when the
average price of a starter house rises to $77,800 from $63,000 and
when interest rates fluctuate between 9.3 percent and 12.4 percent?
   Those changes actually occurred between the beginning of 1985 and
March 1989, the period under study.
   But an analysis of more than 150,000 sales in the past five years
now shows the percentage of first-time buyers remained steady
throughout the period at about 40 percent of the total, regardless
of interest rates or price jiggles.
   Such a finding would seem to defy one of the basic laws of
economics.
   In spite of the law, Monte Helme, vice president of Century 21
Real Estate Corp., declares there is no direct correlation between
interest rates and home prices, and the activity level of first-time
homebuyers.
   The apparent explanation for the seeming contradiction, he
suggests, is that as costs rise the average first-time buyer is a
few years older, tends to buy a smaller house or condo and may buy
in less expensive neighborhoods.
   In short, the type of first-time buyer changes, the product
purchased changes, the total number of sales might change, and the
place of purchase might too.
   But, according to the study of 150,000 Century 21 Real Estate
sales throughout the country, the 40 percent ratio remains almost
fixed.
   However, that finding, even if true, doesn't mean first-time
buyers are unaffected by rising rates and prices. Obviously they
are; the study suggests, for instance, that some of the younger
buyers are knocked out of the market.
   But curiously, the percentages of all first-time homebuyers
varied little in the Century 21 study, ranging from a low of 39.2
percent in 1988 to a high of 40.3 percent in 1986. Through the first
quarter of 1989 the rate was 39.4 percent.
   The findings do tend to support a contention of some active real
estate people that homebuyers are far more flexibile and adaptive
than they are credited with being.
   A better understanding of markets may have reduced somewhat the
perception of risk involved in homebuying. New buyers, for example,
recognize that their interest costs could fall rather than remain
fixed at high levels.
   In addition, today's first-time buyers have foresaken the idea of
moving immediately into the house of their dreams. Evidence can be
found in almost every city in America that young families are
willing to lower their sights, move into lesser neighborhoods and
apply their own labor in order to raise values.
   Whatever judgment is finally made of the findings, there is
enough evidence already to warn economists and others from making
the almost instant conclusion that first-time buyers are wiped out
by rising rates and prices.

<HEAD>A New Night-Shopping Law Has West Germany Astir</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CAROL J. WILLIAMS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BONN, West Germany (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   West Germany is embroiled in
controversy over a new law to permit stores to stay open Thursdays
until 9 p.m. _ 2{ hours beyond the regular closing time.
   Labor unions and others charge it threatens family stability.
   Strikes have been called against a number of retailers who have
indicated they might go along with the ``Ladenschlussgesetz'' _ the
``store-closing law.''
   The Economics Ministry says the whole thing _ the new law as well
as the old law _ is ``completely insane.''
   While the revision will allow retailers to stay open later on
Thursdays starting Oct. 1, it mandates that those that do must close
by 1 p.m. on Saturdays, an hour earlier than usual.
   On other days, stores are required by law to close by 6:30 p.m.,
and shopping is outlawed on Sunday.
   The intent of the new law is to help relieve consumer congestion
on Saturdays, when the vast majority of working adults rush to get
their week's shopping done before the mandated 2 p.m. closing time.
   Parking garages are always jammed and parking spaces on the
street are hard to find. People scramble to find shopping carts and
long lines form at cash registers.
   That would seem to make Thursday-night shopping a welcome idea,
but hardly so.
   Walter Deuss, chairman of the Karstadt department store chain,
the nation's largest, said the company had lost $5 million in sales
this year because of strikes over the change.
   Employees for Karstadt and other major retailers are insisting on
new labor contracts that guarantee them a 6:30 p.m. closing time.
   A recent survey of the 370,000 retail business owners, conducted
by the National Retailers Association, indicated that less than 20
percent of consumers planned to shop on Thursday nights.
   That has left store owners concerned that the cost of keeping
clerks later on Thursday won't be met by a corresponding rise in
sales.
   Conservatives lawmakers favored the Thursday night shopping idea
because it keeps West Germans in step with their neighbors who have
been lengthening shopping hours.
   Leftist politicians opposed it on grounds that it would be
``anti-women and anti-children.''
   During the acrimonious battle to change the law, retail workers'
unions and political groups launched advertising campaigns showing
children left home alone while their parents wantonly shopped or
their mothers slaved at a cash register at night.
   But the Thursday night law still won't make it any easier to
figure out when to shop:
   _Bread stores are closed on Mondays because they open for two
hours on Sunday, when everything else is closed.
   _Pharmacies are closed Wednesday afternoons because they stay
open round-the-clock one weekend each month for emergencies.
   _All shops are allowed to close between 12:30 p.m. and 2 p.m. for
lunch _ the same time many workers are at lunch and could pick up a
few things.
   _Then there is Long Saturday _ the first Saturday of the month
when some shops, though not all, stay open until 6 p.m. But Long
Saturday will be shortened by two hours after October, as part of
the government compromise to compensate for Thursday nights.
   ``The whole thing is completely insane,'' said Economics Ministry
spokesman Peter Vogel. ``The old system, the new system,
everything.''

   When GIs came home after World War II,
the nation looked to the great forests of the Northwest for lumber
to build their houses.
   Oregon and Washington mills responded, and still supply more than
a third of the lumber and plywood used in the United States.
   ``There was always that one more shining hill covered with trees
to the west,'' said U.S. Forest Service budget officer Ron Johnson
in Portland. ``Now we find there's a Pacific Ocean and we fell into
it.''
   From the western slope of the Cascade Range to the shore of the
Pacific, this is the home of the Douglas fir, the towering king of
the ancient forests whose structural strength tops all other lumber.
   It is also home to the Northern spotted owl, a 14-inch bird that
could face extinction because, with rare exceptions, it won't nest
or hunt anywhere but the dwindling virgin forests that are most
prized for timber.
   While logs are tied up in the legal battle over how much of the
national forests can be cut without killing off the spotted owl,
record amounts of raw timber grown on private and state land are
being shipped for premium prices to Japan, China and Korea without
ever seeing the inside of an American mill.
   ``If a log is of export quality, and is available to be exported,
it will be exported,'' said Tom Mayr, owner of the Mayr Brothers
mill in Hoquiam, Wash. Mayr has been reduced to counting his supply
in months instead of years while watching a stream of logs being
loaded onto ships in Grays Harbor, Wash.
   ``We want to put out logs to the highest value market. In recent
years the highest value has been offshore,'' said Jack Taylor,
operations manager for Weyerhaeuser in Coos Bay, where the region's
leading exporter of raw logs has started a new mill to produce
metric-dimension lumber for the Japanese home-building market.
   Companies can generally get 25 percent more for export logs than
they can in the domestic market, said Forest Service economist Don
Flora in Seattle.
   Boom-and-bust cycles were known to the timber industry before the
spotted owl entered the spotlight, but for the first time the pinch
is from a shortage of logs rather than rising mortgage rates and
dips in the housing market.
   Eighteen years ago, Brad Wentworth stopped off in the coastal
town of Gold Beach to see some friends on his way to college to
study forest management. Now he's 37, a husband and father, and one
of the 300 workers at Gold Beach Plywood who will be out of a job
this summer when the mill shuts down.
   ``I got sucked into the mill because it was such good wages,''
Wentworth said. ``I kick myself in the butt now.''
   Thirteen other wood products mills in Oregon and Washington have
closed this year, putting nearly 2,000 people out of work as the
industry enters a new era of high-priced timber in short supply. A
referendum Tuesday in Oregon calls for a ban on exporting
state-grown logs and asks Congress to make permanent an annually
renewed ban on exporting logs grown on federal land.
   ``The mill is old and inefficient,'' said Gold Beach mill manager
Eric Saunders. ``It would take about $3 million to bring it up. Why
should we put in that kind of investment without knowing there is a
stable supply of timber?''
   The shortage of timber doesn't come as a surprise, but its
magnitude does.
   In 1976, Oregon State University forestry professor John Beuter
reported that little mature timber was left on private land and that
the industry would have to depend on national forests, home to most
of the old-growth timber, to make it to the next century, when
second-growth trees planted before World War II would be ready for
harvest.
   Jerry Hamilton, director of resource services for Seattle's
Simpson Timber Co., had expected harvests in national forests to
decline about 20 percent in Oregon and Washington this year as the
Forest Service revised its long-range management plans. He now fears
it could drop 50 percent because old-growth forests have been ruled
off-limits because of the spotted owl.
   ``Historically, a lot of the impetus for the management of
federal lands in the West was to settle the West and develop it,''
said Beuter, now a consultant in Portland. ``We are sort of at the
end of that era now. We are at the point of recognizing that cutting
more timber isn't going to create new cities and new economic
opportunity in the West. In fact, we are coming around to where
saving the forests may create new economic opportunity.''
   Ed Whitelaw, a University of Oregon economics professor, has been
a leading proponent of the idea that the Northwest has more to gain
from preserving its blue skies, green forests and clear water than
from exploiting its resources.
   ``Most Oregonians receive two paychecks,'' he said. ``One is in
dollars. The other comes from the environment. By accounting for all
other amenities, I estimate that the environmental paycheck is worth
$1.3 billion. The paycheck from the timber industry is $1.5
billion.''
   In 1988, Oregon and Washington national forests supplied 5.4
billion board feet of timber, a third of the region's total harvest
from all lands. Where the Forest Service management plans used in
the 1980s allowed the annual harvest of 5.5 billion board feet, the
limit in the 1990s will be closer to 4.7 billion.
   Unlike owners of private forests, the Forest Service by law may
cut no more timber than it can grow back. It also has to provide for
the needs of fish, wildlife, campers, hikers and water quality.
   Where it once had to answer only to the timber industry, the
service now has a crowd of watchdogs panting over its shoulder. The
governors of Washington and Oregon want to be sure there is enough
timber to sustain the rural economy. Environmental groups demand
preservation of old-growth forests. Academics have started offering
new management techniques that follow the lead of nature. And there
is new unrest inside the Forest Service.
   Jeff DeBonis, a Willamette National Forest timber sale planner,
has organized the Association of Forest Service Employees for
Environmental Ethics, with a mailing list of about 200. DeBonis
wrote in February to Forest Service chief Dale Robertson claiming
the agency is in bed with the industry.
   ``The question we need to ask concerned citizens is, `Why should
the national forests be sacrificed to an overzealous and greedy
industry that liquidated their own lands to make a fast cut?''' he
said.
   Robertson's staff is preparing a detailed response to DeBonis'
letter, said spokeswoman Rose Narlock in Washington, D.C. ``Maybe we
need some of these things talked about. It was a gutsy move on his
part.''
   Robertson has acknowledged that the Forest Service has taken a
beating in the courts under the National Environmental Policy Act,
evidence DeBonis cites for his argument that too many trees are
being cut.
   While loggers tie yellow ribbons to their trucks and demand more
timber, the grim truth is jobs are disappearing, spotted owl or no
spotted owl.
   ``The biggest source of change in employment has been the
modernization and automation of the forest products industry,'' said
Wilderness Society economist Jeffrey T. Olson, who produced a study
concluding the decline in timber jobs in the Northwest has little to
do with cutting old growth in national forests.
   Flora, the Forest Service economist, said in the 1970s he figured
each 1 million board feet of timber translated into eight timber
jobs. That's now down to 1.5 jobs in the high-tech mills and four to
five jobs overall.
   Timber is virtually extinct as a factor in the economies of
Portland and Seattle, but still vital in small cities and towns that
grew up with it.
   Oregon's 68,700 wood-products jobs _ almost all of them outside
the Portland area _ account for 5.2 percent of the state's
employment. Washington's 41,800 timber jobs account for 2.1 percent
of its employment. In 1986, the most recent figures available,
timber accounted for just 6 percent of Oregon's gross state product
at $2.5 billion and 2.2 percent of Washington's, at $1.6 billion.
   But Forest Service economist Con Schallau in Corvallis argues
timber has a greater impact than that, because it accounts for 38
percent of Oregon's basic economy _ bringing in outside dollars _
and 18 percent of Washington's.
   While economists may differ over timber's importance, they agree
the places that will be hurt worst are towns like Gold Beach,
population 1,500, with a payroll of $6 million from Gold Beach
Plywood.
   ``If you live in a big city you've got a lot of choices,''
Wentworth said, ``but if you live here you've got to work in the
brush or the mill.''

   EDITOR'S NOTE _ The Alaska oil spill befouled hundreds of miles
of wildlife habitat. Was that its extent? Not according to the
people of Valdez. Some are profiting by it, but others feel it has
polluted their entire hard-luck town. This is a Report From Alaska,
the first in an occasional series.

<TEXT>
   Not a drop of spilled oil stains the
sparkling waters of this harbor on Prince William Sound. The stain
here is well ashore.
   ``They are turning our village into a shantytown,'' says Tom
McAlister, the town's fire marshal.
   That is one of the milder sentiments you hear these days from the
2,500 residents of Valdez. Theirs is, or was, a gentle village that
fate seems to have picked on over the years for more than its share
of bad luck.
   Valdez is the terminal of the Alaska oil pipeline. Its shores
were untouched by the worst-ever American oil spill, but it will be
linked forever, its villagers feel, with the name of the tanker that
spilled the oil.
   The tanker Exxon Valdez filled its enormous hull here, but left
its 11 million gallons well south where it ran aground.
   Now Valdez has become the staging ground for the thousands trying
to clean up the mess and other thousands looking to help do it at
wages that seem to be causing a sort of gold rush fever in Valdez.
   People are swarming here from all over. Some villagers are
comparing the effect on their town to that of the 1964 earthquake.
An exaggeration, of course, because that horror so shook Valdez that
the entire citizenry had to pack up and move 10 miles away and start
all over.
   ``Well,'' says Pat Lynn, ``that's just what I sometimes feel like
doing. Just look at it.''
   His gesture takes in clusters of tents pitched on the hillsides;
temporary housing in the shape of boxcars, left over from pipeline
construction crews, stuck on every flat place and stacked up at the
harbor until other flat places can be found; traffic jams and
honking horns; camper vehicles parked helter-skelter because there's
no room in the designated lots; people standing in lines _ for a
meal, or a drink, or a shower at the high school gym, for free, or
at a truck stop to get wet, for a dollar a minute.
   ``It's a damn circus,'' says Lynn.
   Pat Lynn runs a one-person radio station, one of America's
smallest. It's typical of a Valdez enterprise _ small, unambitious,
sufficient to serve a town this size. He took a 75 percent cut in
income to move to Valdez from busy Anchorage.
   ``Now we have suddenly become a city of 8,000 transients,'' he
says.
   ``Our sense of intimacy has been fractured. Our quiet way of
living has been torn away from us. Our crime rate has gone up. Our
mayor told me the other day he had to go looking for his house key.
He had never needed it before.
   ``All the reasons we chose to live in Valdez, out here in all
this isolated beauty, have been shattered, maybe beyond repair.
   ``It's going to take forever to clean up the oil, if it can be
cleaned up, which I doubt. So who knows how long it will take for
Valdez to be Valdez again, or whether it ever will be?''
   No question that the shock was sudden and dramatic.
   On the first day after the March 24 spill, for example, the
little Valdez airstrip, which didn't even have a control tower, had
to handle 800 takeoffs and landings. For the month of April, it
handled 8,417, comparable to Chicago's O'Hare airport, one of the
nation's busiest.
   No question, either, that the impact has been all the more
jarring because of the serene natural beauty of this northeastern
corner of Prince William Sound.
   Alaskans call Valdez ``little Switzerland.'' Herman Ruess, an
airplane pilot who left Switzerland to come here, says the
description is apt.
   Ruess will take you to the face of the sound's 17 glaciers and
let you watch them cast great chunks of ice into the sea, a
phenomenon called calving, creation still in progress.
   Ruess likes to take the scenic route from Valdez back to his base
in Anchorage. He banks his airplane low over ice-strewn waters,
looking for seals, finding them.
   ``No houses, no highways, no nothing,'' he says, grinning.
``Isn't it beautiful?''
   Mountains embrace Valdez on three sides. They were sculpted by
ice and the ages and a hand with all the time in the world.
   The winter snowfall, 300 inches or more, never quite leaves the
peaks. It lingers in crevasses and shaded pockets like milk poured
from a dipper.
   Lower on the slopes, emerald-green alder and cottonwood surround
cascades of snow melt, waterfalls that nourish heather and lupine
and wild strawberries. In the winter the waterfalls freeze in
mid-flow. Climbers who come here call Valdez the Yosemite of ice.
   ``I think one reason the oil spill so upset people in the lower
48,'' says Joe Leahy, a Valdez resident, ``is because even if they
never have a chance to come to Alaska they like to know that it's
here. I know I felt that way when I lived in Cleveland.''
   Leahy is the curator of the Valdez Museum. Not too many towns of
2,500 have a museum of this one's scope, but Valdez has a history
deserving of it, a history, Leahy says, that reassures him. In his
mind there is a certain Valdez spirit that will enable it to recover
from its current woe.
   ``We here are sort of different,'' he says. ``We don't exactly
fit in elsewhere. We gravitated to Valdez because people are not so
judgmental about other people's quirks and personalities because we
have our own. We're all more or less kindred.
   ``What gives us our tenacity is that if Valdez were to disappear
we wouldn't have many places left to go.''
   Leahy moved to Valdez from Juneau five years ago. He left there
not because he saw it grow from 15,000 to 30,000 but because the
owner of a hardware store where he had done business for 13 years
all of a sudden required two pieces of identification to take his
check.

   ``It's our mutual trust and intimacy that we hope not to lose in
Valdez,'' Leahy says.
   Valdez became a place on naval charts in 1790 when a Spanish
explorer, Salvador Fidalgo, saw the port's exquisite beauty and
named it for his boss _ just as Captain James Cook named Prince
William Sound for his.
   It remained only that, a name on a map, until 1898 when
gold-seekers docked here to take a shortcut to the Klondike over an
Indian trail across the Valdez glacier. Many of them decided halfway
across the rugged ice that no amount of gold was worth the trip and
came back. Before long Valdez became a town of more than 4,500.
   When the gold boom died Valdez survived. But for decade after
decade misfortune seemed to visit little Valdez, with uncommon
regularity, mostly fires, sometimes disease. Somehow it managed to
settle into a close-knit community with schools and churches and a
fishing fleet and a way of life that sturdy folk with an eye for
nature's gifts found attractive.
   Then, in 1964, America's worst earthquake struck. It recorded 8.5
on the Richter scale and its epicenter was in Prince William Sound.
It destroyed Valdez. It left the ground under what remained of the
town so unstable that everybody had to move to a more solid
foundation 10 miles away.
   They brought with them the town fire bell, which had saved many
of them, and the oaken bar from the Pinzon Saloon, which had
succored many more. Both are in Joe Leahy's museum. They laid out a
new town with broad streets and grand old trees where bald eagles
nested.
   The new Valdez prospered _ especially when it was chosen as the
terminal of the oil pipeline.
   ``But the town always knew that the oil bonanza could end
someday, just as the gold bonanza did,'' Leahy says.
   So when Valdez rebuilt, it put its chips not on oil but on
tourism. Fifty cruise ships tie up every summer at Valdez and
hundreds of visitors, awed by the scenery and the town's
hospitality, come ashore for about a three-hour stay. Other tourists
motor here in campers and stay longer. All in all, about 100,000
sightseers a year.
   The largest item on the town budget is for beautification _
flowers, trees, grass.
   ``Look at it now,'' says Leahy. ``Cyclone fences with barbed wire
on top. We never allowed that before, but Exxon seems to need it.
Security guards are at every building where Exxon has rented office
space. Security guards! In Valdez!
   ``A stand of trees has been bulldozed to make room for those
temporary barracks and other equipment. Well. Eagles used to perch
there. An eagle won't sit on an Exxon radio tower or satellite dish.
   ``If what the tourists see here is chaos, they certainly won't
recommend an Alaska cruise to their neighbors. The people with
campers will stay away, too, when word gets around on the CB radio
circuit that there's no place to park.''
   There is, in fact, no place to park. Or to sleep. Where will
Valdez accommodate the seasonal workers who come every summer to
operate the fish processing plants? Nobody knows. But then there
might not be much fish processing this year. The oil spill has
eliminated commercial fishing in the most productive salmon area of
Prince William Sound.
   Some in Valdez, of course, benefit from the spill.
   A local joke, alluding to the charges against the skipper of the
Exxon Valdez, is that Exxon is spending money like a drunken sailor.
   The company pays up to $25 an hour, counting the overtime, to
help clean up the oil. A fisherman can get $1,000 a day for the use
of his boat to go skim oil. So why fish? One Valdezian, a lab
technician, appalled at the largesse, earned $2,700 for a week's
work and donated most of it to the Prince William Sound Conservation
Alliance for lobbying against oil interests.
   In Valdez, rooms in private homes are going for $100 a night, a
mattress on the floor for $50. At one restaurant the menu was
reprinted. Same menu, higher prices. The Pipeline Club, a popular
place for dinner, doubled its staff but not its prices and doubled
its profits. It now serves breakfast and lunch as well as dinner and
keeps the bar open from 8 a.m. until 5 a.m., when state law says it
must close.
   On the day of the spill, a woman from Fairbanks drove 350 miles
to a Valdez trailer park where she rents out her camper for $60 a
night from each of four people, two to a bed. No toilet. Jackie
Robb, the manager of the Valdez branch bank, posted signs asking
campers please not to use the parking lot as a restroom.
   Valdez had never had a fast-food joint. Now it has. A trailer
with a window in the side pulled up near the dock with three signs:
``Burger King,'' ``Open,'' and ``Help Wanted.''
   Tom McAlister, the fire marshal, has postponed his retirement
plans. ``I can't leave the town like this,'' he says. ``I just
can't.'' His wife, Gloria, says she has to wait dinner for Tom every
night, sometimes until midnight.
   Joe Michaud, the police chief, has his hands full as well.
   He has been too busy to compile the figures for May and June, but
in April he recorded 81 arrests. Last April he recorded 15. Last
year the Valdez ambulance answered 20 calls, this year, so far, 44.
Drunk drivers all of last year totaled three. So far this year, more
than 20.
   ``I certainly understand people going where they can to find a
job,'' says Michaud. ``I've done that myself. And 90 percent of
these people cause no trouble even though just being here is a real
strain on the town.
   ``We will get through this. We will handle it.''
   Yes. But it does seem unfair that the little village destroyed by
America's worst earthquake must endure the anguish of America's
worst oil spill.
   ``It is unfair,'' says Pat Lynn. ``Because the earthquake was
nature's doing. This was man's.''

   This Fourth of Julypanese. And whil, much of America won't be at home.
   Americans, more than any other nationality in the world, indulge
in a traditional and expensive compulsion to get out of town. To
scram, to leave the city, state, country. They are the world's
busiest travelers by far.
   And in the future they may be able to exit the planet, if not yet
the solar system. Two hundred have already signed up to do so.
   The average American household spends almost $4,000 a year on its
wanderlust, as much as it spends on food, twice as much as it spends
on clothing and three-fifths as much as it spends on the roof over
its head.
   Every year the American dollar travels farther. Business travel
aside, world travelers spend almost $1.3 trillionhe media giant's plans
to buy Warner
Communications Inc. in order to thwart a hostile takeover by
Paramount Communications Inc.

   EDITOR'S NOTE _ In a land of vast forests and waterways, millions
of people in the Soviet Union are now afraid of the air they
breathe, the food they eat and the water they drink. Anger over
pollution of the environment has created the first national
political issue born of Mikhail Gorbachev's glasnost era. Some
activists are even using the issue to question the foundations of
Soviet power.

   In the shale-oil fields on the Soviet
Baltic coast of Estonia, more than 90 children have lost their hair
since January to an ailment apparently caused by the dirty
environment.
   Far to the south in arid Central Asia, irrigation threatens to
suck dry the Aral Sea, which once covered an area the size of the
Netherlands and Belgium. Rivers that feed it teem with intestinal
viruses, dysentery and typhoid, and mothers are advised not to
breast-feed their babies to avoid transmitting disease.
   Fish caught near the Arctic mouth of Siberia's mighty Ob River
reek of oil and are rendered inedible by sludge dumped along the
river's more than 1,800-mile path.
   In a land with a near-mystical attachment to its endless birch
and fir forests and its waterways yielding sturgeon and caviar,
millions of people now are afraid of the air they breathe, the food
they eat and the water they drink.
   Citizens' anger, turned loose by President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's
reforms, has created the first national political issue born of the
glasnost era _ the battle to save the environment. Some activists
are even using the issue to question the foundations of Soviet power.
   The Chernobyl nuclear power plant accident in 1986 is only the
most visible of a saddening series of environmental disasters whose
financial and physical toll remains largely uncalculated.
   As Soviets re-evaluate dictator Josef Stalin, they blame their
polluted land on the breakneck development of heavy industry and
centralized control he imposed and which his successors followed.
Gorbachev is trying to reverse those policies.
   ``All ecological problems are rooted in extensive technologies of
the use of natural resources, the monopoly of ministries, a lack of
effective government control of the use and conservation of natural
resources,'' noted biologist Vladimir Sokolov in the government
newspaper Izvestia.
   But Ants Paju, editor of the Estonian nature magazine Eesti
Loodus, blamed a spiritual emptiness, and the Soviet way of life
itself, for the problems. ``We have turned into living corpses,''
Paju said in an interview.
   ``The worse our internal state, the greater the possibility to do
terrible things to our environment,'' said Paju, who narrowly lost a
parliamentary race against a top Estonian official this spring.
   ``It is not just ecology,'' added 58-year-old Endel Lippmaa, an
Estonian scientist who won election. ``Ecology leads to the question
of technology, to central planning, politics, constitutional change
and sovereignty.''
   Moscow ministries, pushed to meet planned production targets,
``are not interested in the consequences,'' Lippmaa said. ``They are
after a quick gain. We want to decide in Estonia what is to be done,
what is not to be done.''
   Writers raised the ecology question shortly after Gorbachev took
power in 1985 by successfully challenging plans to reverse northern
rivers to flow south and irrigate Central Asia.
   Beginning a year later in Estonia, the concern over oil-shale and
phosphate mining coalesced into the People's Front movement that led
the tiny Baltic republic's government in November 1988 to declare
its sovereignty from Moscow in all areas except defense and foreign
policy.
   In other Baltic republics, the Ukraine, Moldavia, Armenia,
Tadzhikistan, Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, the polluted industrial cities
of the Urals and around Siberia's Lake Baikal, citizens have used
the Estonian example to tackle not only ecological issues but local
ethnic demands and questions of local control.
   In a speech in the Ukrainian capital of Kiev in February,
Gorbachev welcomed the activity of local environmental groups.
However, he added, ``Looking the truth straight in the eye, we have
to say that we still are far from the desired turn for the better.''
   As he rebuilds Soviet foreign policy, Gorbachev has stressed that
pollution is an issue on a par with nuclear weaponry in the threat
it poses to humanity's survival.
   The abundance of natural resources and an economic system that
regards them as common property with no market price have led
Soviets to chronically undervalue the riches their land has been
blessed with.
   Reformers are now demanding that industries start paying a
realistic price for the resources they use and for cleaning up the
mess they leave behind. But that squeezes managers as they struggle
to operate without government subsidies.

   Over the past decade, the Soviet Union has spent $112 billion on
envirnomental protection, but that has proven inadequate.
   Fifty million Soviets, or almost one-fifth of the population,
live in cities where air pollution periodically exceeds acceptable
norms by 10 times, says Fyodor Morgun, chairman of the Soviet
Committee for Environmental Protection.
   Every year 20 cubic kilometers of sewage is dumped directly into
Soviet rivers and lakes, he told the weekly newspaper Arguments and
Facts.
   The Estonian newspaper Kodumaa said 92 children and two adults
living in and around the town of Sillamae, population 20,000, had
lost their hair from January to mid-April.
   It said Lippmaa had determined that the oil-shale layers around
the town contained high concentrations of radium. A government
commission found increased levels of lead and antimony in their
fingernails and saliva.
   The paper quoted Estonian Health Minister Laur Karu as saying
about 400 chemical compounds could cause the baldness. Experts have
not been able to pinpoint the cause of the affliction, nor of a
similar loss of hair in the Ukrainian city of Chernovtsy.
   A national campaign has sprung up to save the Aral Sea, located
on the border of Uzbekistan and Kazakhstan.
   The Tass news agency said the shoreline of the sea, once 25,800
square miles in area, has receded drastically. ``If things go this
way at the same pace as in the past 25 years, the Aral Sea will
cease to exist by the year 2010, being converted into a number of
lakes with great water salinity,'' the news agency said.
   About 35 percent to 40 percent of the flow of Syr Darya and Amu
Darya, the rivers that feed the Aral Sea, is composed of industrial
wastes, city sewage and drainage water, but millions of people still
depend on the waterways for drinking water, said Mukhtar Shakhanov,
a leader of the Kazakhstan Writers Union.
   The number of intestinal viruses in the Syr Darya exceeds
acceptable norms by thousands of times, he said. Typhoid, dysentery
and other diseases also are present.
   There have been 65,000 cases of hepatitis among the 500,000
residents of the Kzyl-Ordinsky region in the past 15 years, he said.
   ``Child mortality on the banks of the Aral is one of the highest
in the world. In some regions of the republic, doctors recommend
against feeding babies mothers' milk. Mothers' milk is poisoned!''
wrote Tulepbergen Kaipbergenov in the Karakapaki region south of the
Aral Sea.
   Spokeswoman Gafkha Namatova of the informal political group Belik
said that an average of 119 pounds of chemicals are used on every
2.47 acres of land in Uzbekistan, and that exposure has caused the
infant mortality rate to soar.
   ``I'm not afraid to use this word _ it's genocide,'' she said in
an interview.
   Shakhanov said that among the chemicals still used on fields are
DDT and Butifos, which he described as a defoliant similar to Agent
Orange.
   Morgun said the Soviet Union's expenditures on the environment
are dwarfed by the United States' estimated $80 billion a year, and
that money is in the wrong hands.
   ``We should not forget that most of the money was spent to build
waste treatment facilities by ministries whose factories pollute the
environment,'' he said. ``Construction proceeds very slowly and the
facilities provide nothing more than minimal treatment.''
   Morgun's agency, which was created only last year as the Kremlin
recognized the extent of the country's pollution problem, has taken
in $140 million in fines, brought civil suit against 32,000 people
and criminal charges against 46, he said.
   Sergei Pegov, head of the Department of Systematic Ecology at the
Scientific Research Center, said the goal of a new government
antipollution program is to end dumping of sewage by the year 2000,
bring water quality up to acceptable standards by 2005, to cut air
pollution by half by 2005 and car emissions by 48 percent.
   Pegov told Izvestia on May 1 that state enterprises would have to
start paying for natural resources and for dirtying the environment.
   But he said scientists had not yet had enough time to work out
technological options for reducing pollution, and that the plan is
weakened by not putting one agency fully in charge of environmental
protection.
   Pegov asserted the Soviet Union will be able to meet its goals
because political reforms will allow officials to deal with the
issue rather than ignore it.
   But Lippmaa said the Soviet Union is nowhere near turning the
corner. ``At this point our main problem is not cleaning up, it's
avoiding further damage,'' he said.

   A. James Manchin, West Virginia's
flamboyant state treasurer whose alliterative oratory and
distinctive dress helped make him one of the state's most popular
politicians, is in the fight of his life.
   Manchin, whose theatrics have brought him both fame and derision,
has been impeached by state House of Delegates and faces trial in
the state Senate on July 10 over the loss of hundreds of millions of
dollars from a state investment fund his office supervised.
   If two-thirds of the 34 senators vote against him, the
62-year-old former high school coach will be removed from office and
could lose his pension.
   A man who never met anyone he didn't know and who never found a
word he couldn't squeeze into a mangled metaphor, Manchin
acknowledges his reputation as something of a clown could be working
against him.
   ``So what? It made me,'' he says. ``You can't have it both ways.
   ``I think maybe I'm an easy target. And you have to understand
I've made a lot of enemies.''
   The son of Italian immigrants, Manchin has been a legislator,
teacher, state director of the Farmers Home Admininstration,
secretary of state and state treasurer.
   But it was during his tenure as director of REAP _ the
Rehabilitation Environmental Action Program, created to rid the
state of junked cars and abandoned appliances _ that Manchin became
a household name.
   He appeared on posters, made public service commercials, and was
the subject of a song. He claimed the program rid the state of
100,000 junked cars but later acknowledged the total was about
30,000.
   Wearing his traditional dark suits, bow ties and a hat, usually a
wide-brimmed white fedora, Manchin took his show on the road, posing
atop rusted junkers with a sledgehammer and proclaiming to the
assembled television cameras that he intended to ``remove these
jezebels of junkery,'' ``mash this mess of muckery'' or eliminate
``this truculent trash.''
   If he couldn't find the right word, Manchin made one up.
   ``We come to report that REAP will not relapse into a reverie of
remoteness but will press ever harder to save a world which is bent
on drowning itself in a deluge of debris,'' he said in one fit of
alliteration. On another day, he proclaimed that ``REAP will not
fiddle while Cub Scouts on a camping trip fizzle in filthery.''
   ``I was the original 30-second sound bite: `Let us do battle
against this bastion of bacteria,''' Manchin said during an
interview in his cluttered office. ``Well, you can say that in 30
seconds. Because how do you explain anything in 30 seconds?
   ``You know why people knew me? It was entertaining. `Look at that
clown.' So we've got that kind of reputation. And I don't mind it.''
   In the years since then, Manchin has toned down his rhetoric,
although he still tends to end his correspondence _ including press
releases _ with the phrase, ``May the bright morning star be a lamp
unto our feet.''
   The lobby to his office resembles a flea market, with two 9-foot
bookcases loaded with dozens of volunteer fire department helmets, a
display of different types of U.S. currency, a stack of sheet music
of the state song, and the remnants of a flea circus Manchin rescued
from the Capitol basement.
   On his office wall, along with a framed drawing of the Statue of
Liberty and paintings of his parents, Jesus and Presidents Harry
Truman and Franklin D. Roosevelt, is a plaque that quotes Teddy
Roosevelt:
   ``Far better it is to dare mighty things, to win glorious
triumphs, even though checkered by failure, than to take rank with
those poor spirits who neither enjoy much nor suffer much, because
they live in the gray twilight that knows no victory nor defeat.''
   Three months after Manchin received that plaque from his staff in
January 1987, the treasurer's investment staff ran into trouble
while living by that creed. Trying to maintain phenomenal interest
earnings on its investments, sometimes averaging 14 percent or more,
by trading heavily in the New York bond market, the treasurer's
employees began to fail _ and fail big.
   In one month, the investment staff had lost $100 million from the
$1.8 billion fund. Former Gov. Arch Moore, before leaving office
last January, said the losses eventually totaled $279 million.
Manchin says they totaled $231 million.
   Manchin says he was never told of the losses until auditors made
them public. The House of Delegates, voting 65-34 in March to
impeach him on 17 counts, said either he knew and did nothing to
stop them, or else he didn't know but should have.
   Manchin's supporters call him the people's servant, always ready
to hear their complaints about any facet of state government and do
his best to find a solution. His opponents call him a buffoon who
spends more time traveling around the state handing out cheap
trinkets and making speeches than doing his job. Testimony during
House impeachment procedings placed him out of the office up to
three out of every five days.
   ``Everybody plays on the fact that, `Well, if I had been here
more ....' I'm here as much as any public official because I take
care of my responsibilities,'' Manchin says.

   ``They make it look like I was out ignoring my duty. But you
understand that the office that I have always sat in as a public
servant, it extends throughout the state. In other words when I am
out there signing a loan or breaking ground, that's an extension of
my office.''
   Even his supporters, however, have had trouble defending some of
Manchin's antics.
   ``Manchin is not an intellectual giant,'' state Del. Pat Bradley,
one of the treasurer's staunchest defenders, said during the
impeachment proceedings. ``I grant you the man is Barnum &amp; Bailey
all the way through. He wears those crazy hats. The fact that the
guy is half-looney is not impeachable.''
   He's been called a buffoon more than once, but Manchin once said,
``There is not a single pickle missing from my jar.''
   Manchin traces his interest in public service to his parents in
the coal camp of Farmington, where he was born in a United Mine
Workers barracks during a coal strike.
   ``My mother cared about people,'' Manchin says. ``When anyone was
down and out in Farmington, who did they come to? They came to my
Mama Kay. If someone has trouble, they drank too much, their mother
and father couldn't handle them and threw them out of the house, who
did they come to? My mother, Mama Kay. When girls were having
trouble, some of them got pregnant out of wedlock, who do you think
they came to? So all my life we were associated with reaching out
and touching the lives of others. Where did I get started? With a
mother who cared about people.
   ``My father, Joseph Manchin Sr., was a magistrate _ in those days
it was justice of the peace. You understand I worked with him 49
years ago. That would make me what? About 13 years old. I can see
this man that people would come to his office. I'd see my father
talk to them, counsel them and turn them in the right direction.''
   After a stint in the Navy, Manchin enrolled at West Virginia
University, where he got his first taste of politics while running
for sophomore class president, campaigning from a horse and buggy.
   ``I campaigned on a famous song: `Moonlight Cocktails.' I think
it was Glenn Miller's song,'' he said, pausing to sing softly for a
few seconds.
   ``That's what I promised _ hayrides and moonlight cocktails. I
was defeated.''
   In 1948, at age 21, Manchin was elected to the House of Delegates
from Marion County, at the time the youngest legislator ever elected
in West Virginia. He blames his defeat two years later to a bill he
introduced to eliminate the state's segregated schools.
   After working as a high school teacher and coach, he was
appointed by President John F. Kennedy as state director of the
Farmers Home Administration.
   ``We brought water, pure water, to half a million people who did
not have water in their homes, who could not enjoy a good glass of
lemonade, that couldn't have a good cup of coffee, that couldn't
take a shower,'' he said. ``Half a million people. One hundred
thousand homes. And it has been said that many of them finally got
indoor plumbing, and they think of me when they flush their
commode.''
   In 1973 he became director of REAP, and resigned for a successful
run for secretary of state in 1976. Manchin was elected to two terms
as secretary of state, then was elected to the first of two terms as
state treasurer in 1984. The investment fund losses occurred in 1987
but didn't become public until December 1988, after he had been
re-elected without opposition.
   Despite his political problems, Manchin remains the man many
people want to see when they visit the state Capitol. Tour groups
make his office a regular stop, and Manchin expresses disappointment
if he is tied up on a telephone call and can't greet a group of
junior high school students before they leave for other parts of the
Capitol. His office handles hundreds of phone calls a day from
people inquiring about every type of government service from tax
refunds to road repairs. He has a full-time ombudsman on his staff.
   Whether it's network television, national magazines, local
newspapers, or public speakers, no one is safe from Manchin's
well-publicized wrath if he perceives a slur on his native state.
   ``An insult of insane proportions'' is how he once described a
magazine advertisement for hot dogs that he said unfairly depicted
West Virginians as dirty. He once said NBC faced ``the winds of
war'' because ``Today Show'' weatherman Willard Scott's map of the
United States omitted West Virginia's Northern Panhandle.
   He's been constantly criticized by lawmakers for spending his
budget on ceremonial certificates and other doodads naming
recipients ``Commodore of the Ship of State'' or ``Public Friend No.
1.'' He holds an annual ceremony so he can award his ``Order of the
35th Star'' to senior citizens.
   ``Sometimes riding on an elephant, or being on top of a junked
car, or using alliteration, clowning around _ it gets attention,''
Manchin said.
   ``The point we're trying to make is that I have a sense of humor.
I am A. James Manchin. I'm not cloned of anybody. I'm not going to
be one. I'm going to be who I am.
   ``And when they lay me away on a hill in Farmington, W.Va.,
they'll say, `Here lies A. James Manchin. He loved his God. He loved
his state. He loved his family. And he did it all and said it all.'''

   EDITOR'S NOTE _ With enrollments in the nation's colleges of
agriculture declining at a time of strong demand for people trained
in agricultural sciences, graduates of a special high school in
Chicago are prime candidates for scholarships. Though it's located
in a big city, it's one of only two high schools in the nation
focusing on agriculture.
</TEXT>

<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   It's a high school with a livestock judging team,
a field full of vegetables and a greenhouse full of flowers.
   No football team. No cheerleaders.
   In Chicago, of all places.
   The Chicago High School for Agricultural Sciences opened four
years ago on the southwest edge of this city of 3 million, the last
stop before the suburbs and rural countryside. It's one of only two
in the nation focusing on agriculture, and university recruiters
lined up with scholarships for its first graduates this spring.
   ``If we can't find students in the country, we'll find them in
the city,'' says Roger Bruene of the Iowa State University College
of Agriculture. ``You don't have to grow up on a farm to take
advantage of these excellent career opportunities.''
   ``These ag companies are crying for people, especially
minorities,'' says horticulture teacher Ron Biondo. ``We had 19
universities here a few weeks ago recruiting our kids.''
   The first 86 graduates received their diplomas June 23 in a
ceremony at the Chicago Board of Trade, where the nation's major
farm commodities are bought and sold.
   The new school was welcomed by colleges of agriculture because
their enrollments were declining at a time when there was a strong
demand for people trained in agricultural sciences, food
engineering, finance and marketing.
   ``This is a futuristic bridge between a metropolitan area and new
job opportunities in the food and natural resource system,'' says
Allan Goecker of Purdue University.
   The graduating seniors raised and sold crops on the school's
72-acre farm, spent weekends with farm families hundreds of miles
away, and worked afternoons and summers for major agribusiness
companies.
   ``I knew I was interested in science and chemistry, but when I
got here I really got excited about agriculture,'' says Corie
Yearby, who will study agronomy at Alcorn University in Mississippi.
   ``I see all these career opportunities in agriculture and I want
to be part of it,'' said Theresa Garza, who will attend Lincoln
University in Missouri and eventually hopes to grow crops in outer
space.
   The small high school reflects the racial balance of the city's
public school system _ 80 percent of its 435 students are black or
Hispanic. They are recruited for their interest, not their grades.
   ``If Johnny can't add two and two, you don't say he can't come
here,'' says Assistant Principal Kevin McCarthy. ``You say to the
parents, `Does Johnny want to come here and do you want him to come
here?'''
   Students face a tough academic program in the longest school day
in Chicago and nearly 50 percent more class credits than other high
schools.
   But, there is no shortage of applications. For every freshman
accepted, another qualified student is turned away.
   Parents and students are attracted because the school is
relatively small and safe, and there is a likelihood of college and
good jobs later.
   ``They learn about soil, landscaping and horticulture, and they
use these skills,'' says Gloria Yearby, Corie's mother. ``It gives
them a real incentive to go on to college.''
   The students have grown up in the city and for many, Biondo's
horticulture class is the first opportunity to have flower petals
between their fingers and dirt under their nails.
   In the greenhouse, sophomore Julie Berner watered and fertilized
geraniums, some of the 50,000 bedding plants grown and sold by the
students. The sale raised $7,000 for the school.
   ``Just listening to lectures in class would be boring, but this
is exciting, hands-on experience in horticulture,'' she says.
   Outside, students fed the floppy-eared rabbits they raised and
showed in competition. Janet Martinez, a junior, won first place
with Buffy, her black Angora.
   ``I want to be a veterinarian and I know this is the right start
_ an agricultural high school,'' she says.
   Down the hall, the floral design lab was strewn with pieces of
stem from the cutting table. There were cut flowers in a cooler; a
diagram of plant parts on the wall; a chalk drawing of a celosia;
and young violets growing under lights.
   Students sell their arrangements, including many that are used at
official Board of Education activities.
   ``I had one girl with a learning disability who never had gotten
good grades,'' says Donna Theimer, who teaches floral design. ``But,
she loved this class and now she has a career goal she can actually
attain.''
   In the computer laboratory, freshman Tracy Givens and classmates
work on 34 terminals. Computer training is required.
   ``You just have a lot more opportunities here, a lot more
responsibility,'' says Miss Givens, wearing a yellow shirt and cap
advertising the ``Webberville, Mich., Corn Festival.''
   Visits with families in farm country give students a close look
at production agriculture.
   ``It was a unique experience,'' says senior Tracey Moore, who
visited a Wisconsin farm. ``I didn't expect pigs to smell so strong.
But, the farmers are so friendly and they work very hard.''

   Principal Barbara Valerious says a key to the success of the high
school has been the companies that provide specialized equipment for
laboratories, guest speakers for classes and jobs for students.
   Vicky Greer, a junior, spent last summer at Michigan State
University working in the animal science department, helping with
palatability tests on feed for steers.
   Senior Jerome Offord works after classes at the Chicago Board of
Trade, where he distributes literature to the public and helps
organize seminars. Like the other students with ag-related jobs, he
earns credit for high school and money for college.
   ``And, now I really understand how the markets work,'' says
Offord, who will attend Lincoln University to study agricultural
education.
   He is one of six students working at the Board of Trade,
according to Lisa Foss, education and marketing coordinator.
   One major agricultural company interested in the high school is
Dow Chemical Co., of Midland, Mich., a manufacturer of farm
chemicals and seed. Dow will provide four of the high school's
graduates with $2,500-a-year scholarships and summer jobs, says
company spokesman Garry Hamlin. He said Dow wants them to be
interested in careers in agriculture, and with Dow.
   ``We recognize a shortage of strong research-and-development
people in the field today,'' Hamlin says.
   At Purdue University, Goecker helped prepare a report for the
U.S. Department of Agriculture on demand for graduates of
agricultural colleges. He said the report concluded the schools will
turn out 44,000 students a year to fill 48,000 jobs.
   ``The bottom line is about a 10 percent shortfall in the late
1980s in terms of graduates,'' Goecker says. ``A lot of firms are in
the marketplace, aggressively trying to hire people.''
   Hamlin says, for example, Dow would pay an agricultural
researcher with a bachelor of science degree between $24,000 and
$29,000 a year to start, and would pay up to $38,000 for someone
with a doctorate.
   ``We are having trouble getting qualified people into
biotechnology research,'' says Jim Altemus of the Monsanto
Agricultural Co., a St. Louis-based chemical manufacturer. ``These
are support people who have an exposure to science, biology,
chemistry, math, and are patient, accurate and understand the metric
system.''
   Goecker says enrollment in colleges of agriculture peaked at
about 100,000 in 1976-77, then fell to a low of about 66,000 in 1987.
   Educators blame economic stress on the farm and the incorrect
notion that agriculture means only farming _ raising crops and
livestock.
   ``Ag is becoming more high-tech all the time,'' says Bonnie
Johnson of Washington State University, where agricultural
enrollments dropped 40 percent during the early 1980s. ``People have
not seen agriculture as science, food processing and finance.''
   That was one of the first problems the new Chicago high school
had to deal with.
   ``In the city, you say agriculture and people think, `dumb
farmer,''' Biondo says. ``First, farmers aren't dumb, they're smart.
Second, agriculture is much more than farming.''
   Biondo, like the other 10 teachers who came to the Chicago school
in 1985, was hired from outside the district. There simply were no
teachers in Chicago qualified to teach the agricultural courses.
There now are 43 faculty members, and all but two of the original
teachers remain on campus.
   Biondo, who was recruited after a well-publicized 1984 meeting
with President Ronald Reagan at the Will County center where Biondo
taught, liked the idea of a totally new approach to high school, and
he liked the students he would work with.
   ``There are racial and ethnic differences,'' he says. ``They are
louder, street-smart kids who don't intimidate easily. But, there
are some really bright, motivated kids here.''
   There also are some drawbacks.
   Quarters are cramped in the remodeled elementary school, despite
a 1987 addition and five modular classrooms outside the main brick
building.
   Files are piled on windowsills. One classroom is converted to a
gym by moving desks and throwing mats on the floor. Another becomes
the cafeteria when lunch is delivered.
   The students are demanding.
   ``They won't let a teacher sit around,'' says Marcia
Watman-Lauchner, who teaches agricultural communications and food
science and works on the school's curriculum. ``They want to learn
and work hard, and they demand our time and information. They'll
tell you what they want from you.''
   The racial makeup of the school also has caused a few problems in
the white, upper-middle class Mount Greenwood neighborhood.
Valerious says black students have been targets of bottle-throwing
and name-calling, though the majority of people in the neighborhood
support the school and admire the students.
   McCarthy said only three students who enrolled in 1985 dropped
out of high school, and ``that's phenomenal in four years'' in the
city.

   EDITOR'S NOTE _ For the past 10 years, capuchin monkeys, chosen
for their small size and ability to perform simple tasks, have been
working as helping hands for disabled people. But a Boston-based
organization that matches monkeys with handicapped people is losing
its government financing this year and now must turn to corporations
and individuals for donations to continue the work.

   Robert Foster's life changed forever one
rainy day 14 years ago while driving to an auto parts store. He was
traveling no more than 30mph when he lost control of his car and hit
a tree.
   His spinal cord was irreparably bruised and Foster woke up in his
hospital bed a quadriplegic.
   After several years in rehabilitation, Foster moved into a
one-bedroom apartment. He was alone and nearly helpless all day,
except for an hour or so in the morning and evening when a personal
attendant came to bathe and feed him.
   Shortly after watching a television show about the possible use
of monkeys to aid quadriplegics, Foster made a phone call that
changed his life again.
   He got in touch with Mary Jo Willard, a former research assistant
to behaviorist B.F. Skinner.
   Willard, now the director of the Boston-based organization
Helping Hands: Simian Aides for the Disabled, first thought of
matching monkeys with the handicapped after visiting a quadriplegic
in the hospital and discovering how many small tasks he was unable
to perform.
   Within weeks, Foster, now 32, was made a guinea pig in Willard's
fledgling program. He was matched with a capuchin monkey named
Hellion, who was trained on the job and often lived up to her name.
After several rocky years, Foster and Hellion are now such a team
that Foster's mother refers to the monkey as her ``granddaughter.''
   ``She can work for me, she's a friend and she's good at breaking
down the barriers between people in wheelchairs and people walking
around,'' Foster says.
   Since 1979, capuchin monkeys, chosen for their small size and
ability to perform simple tasks, have been placed with 15
quadriplegics around the country. The monkeys are bred at Walt
Disney World in Orlando, Fla.
   ``She's instant help,'' says Mitch Kaufman, 34, of Portland,
Ore., who has a 6-year-old monkey, Peepers.
   Kaufman, who was injured in a car accident on his 30th birthday,
says Peepers does most of the tasks he once had to wait hours for
attendants to perform.
   ``I can just let her loose,'' he says. ``And she's sort of like a
friend but really funny. She's somebody there that wasn't there
before. She kind of fills up a space.''
   The program is designed to provide more than just technical help
for the handicapped. The monkeys placed with quadriplegics often
become like family, allowing quadriplegics to care for someone else
instead of always being the victims, Willard says.
   ``The quality of their lives is so enriched,'' says Willard, who
financed the program herself for the first two years while working a
part-time job. ``It's wonderful to see such severely disabled people
get so happy and excited about something.''
   `Helping Hands'' also involves foster homes around the country
where young monkeys live for their first several years to grow
accustomed to a home environment. They are then returned to Boston
for training and placement. More than 80 young monkeys are currently
with foster families, but the waiting list for monkeys numbers in
the hundreds, Willard says.
   Mary Ann Feller of Silverton, Ore., has taken care of Kris, a
nearly 4-year-old monkey, for three years. She and her family are
preparing to return Kris to Boston within the next few months.
   ``I think it'll be real traumatic,'' Feller says. ``They become
such a part of your life. But we knew it was short term. That's why
you raise them, knowing they will eventually leave to help
quadriplegics. It's like raising guide dogs. You have to think in
that way or else you mourn and weep when they're gone.''
   Willard's idea, which later became a favorite topic for
television talk shows and news magazines and even the inspiration
for the horror movie ``Monkeyshines,'' almost never came to
fruition. She was turned down by 38 agencies over two years.
   ``It was enormously discouraging,'' Willard says. ``People just
thought it would fail and they would be embarrassed by it.''
   Willard was about to give up when a reporter for a medical
journal spotted a paper she had written about her program. The
journal ran a story on the program and other press coverage
followed. Soon, Willard says, the agencies that had rejected the
idea saw it as more viable.
   Since then, the difference the monkeys have made in the lives of
the severely handicapped has been enormous.
   Foster remembers well what it was like before Hellion moved into
his neat, one bedroom apartment in a complex for the elderly in
Watertown, just outside Boston. He has no mobility below his upper
shoulders and uses a mouthstick to operate his motorized wheelchair.
   Hellion feeds Foster snacks left by an attendant and dials a
speaker phone for him. He also knows how to turn on the television,
stereo and VCR.
   ``It used to be that if a door shut behind me, I couldn't open it
up and I'd be stuck there all day,'' Foster says. ``If I dropped my
mouthstick, I wouldn't be able to move from that spot until my
attendant came in at night.''
   The program, which has been financed by the Veterans
Administration, loses its funding this year. Recently, U.S. Rep.
Joseph P. Kennedy II introduced legislation that would allow
service-connected quadriplegic veterans to receive a monkey, much
the same way they are now entitled to devices like wheelchairs and
page-turners from the government.
   Willard and program director Judy Zazula hope the program will
receive enough sponsorship from companies like animal food
manufacturer Purina Mills and individual donations to continue. At
present, the program receives $300,000 in funding.
   Zazula, 33, has worked with Willard from the start of the program
and directs the training of the monkeys. She works 12-hour days at
the Boston training center where she spends long hours in a
wheelchair simulating tasks for the monkeys. Currently, there are 18
monkeys being trained at the center.
   Zazula is so devoted to her charges that Hellion, Foster's
monkey, was the ``flower primate'' at her wedding last summer.
   ``I look at the people we've helped and I just can't believe this
program could end,'' Zazula says. ``The monkeys have become the
focus of their lives.''

   When the cameras are turned off on the set of
ABC's ``Full House,'' Bob Saget and the other actors sometimes
pretend they're doing other shows.
   ``We kid that I'm Richie Cunningham and we're doing `Happy
Days,''' says Saget. ``David Coulier is Ralph and Potsie and John
Stamos is the Fonz. Or we kid that we're doing `Charlie's Angels.'
John is Jaclyn Smith, David is Farrah Fawcett and I'm Kate Jackson.
It's just a way to have fun.''
   ```Full House' is about six people living in one house and loving
each other. The three guys and my three daughters,'' Saget says.
``We really do care for each other. Usually people in a show love
each other because they get paid.''
   Saget stars as Danny, a San Francisco TV talk show host and
widower with three daughters who asks his brother-in-law and a
friend to move in and help him run the household. Stamos is Uncle
Jesse, a former musician who now writes advertising jingles. Coulier
is Joey, a stand-up comedian. Together, they all fill the house with
laughs.
   The daughters are Candace Cameron, Jodie Sweetin and twins Mary
Kate and Ashley Fuller Olsen (as baby Michelle).
   ``It took about 13 weeks for me and the writers to figure out who
Danny is,'' Saget says. ``It's the first time I've had an
opportunity to develop a character. It took me longer to get a grip
on my character than the other actors. I knew I wanted him to be
neat and I knew I wanted him to hug a lot. Those were the external
things.
   ``The internal thing is that there's an undercurrent of sadness
because his wife died in an automobile accident only a year before.
He really does need all this love in his life. The thing I like
about him is that, like Rihie Cunningham, he's really a nice guy.''
   Saget had worked mostly as a stand-up comic prior to ``Full
House,'' although his training at Temple University and the
University of Southern California was in filmmaking. A documentary
he wrote, directed and edited, ``Through Adam's Eyes,'' was honored
at the Los Angeles Filmex.
   Director Steven Spielberg asked him to send him his next film.
``I did and it sat in his office for a year,'' Saget says. ``It was
awful and pretentious. A 22-year-old kid being cocky didn't go over.
It was called `Beach Blanket Blintz.' Three hundred people showed up
for a screening because their kids were in it. Everyone hated the
film.''
   He was featured in the movie ``Critical Condition'' and was a
guest star on various TV series. His work as a comic landed him
appearances on ``The Tonight Show,'' ``The Merv Griffin Show,''
``HBO Young Comedians Special'' and ``Late Night With David
Letterman.''
   In 1987, he became a regular on CBS' ``Morning Program'' with
Mariette Hartley and Rolland Smith.
   ``I joined the Directors Guild, with CBS paying, and I did two
comedy videos a week for `Morning Program,''' he says. ``Then I
found out how difficult it is to make two videos a week. The show
wasn't on very long but I actually think it could have worked. I
guess at that time people weren't ready for comedy that early in the
morning. I think a time will come when you'll have comedy on TV like
you have on the morning drive radio shows.''
   Saget was on the ``Morning Program'' when he was offered the role
in ``Full House.''
   ``The people at the `Morning Program' wanted to get rid of me and
I wanted to leave,'' he says. ``I was out of work three weeks. The
pilot was filmed with another actor as Danny, and I replaced him.''
   Saget, who is married and has a baby daughter, says he likes
working with the girls on the show. ``They're my pseudo-children,''
he says. ``I'll do things with the girls that I know I'll be doing
with my own daughter when she gets older.''
   While he likes working in a television comedy, he's also eager to
do more films.
   ``The sitcom format is very easy,'' he says. ``But you can't be
natural. You have an audience while you film and your volume has to
be up, your energy level has to be high. When I did `Critical
Condition' I really felt at home.''
   Saget was born in Philadelphia but grew up in Norfolk, Va., and
Southern California.
   The family returned to Philadelphia just in time for him to
graduate from high school, where he met his wife, Sherri. He got his
degree at Temple, worked as a comic at various comedy clubs, then
enrolled in the graduate film school at USC. Later, he left school
to hone his comedy skills at the Los Angeles Comedy Store and on
tour across the country.

   Jeff Gordon calls himself an ``actor-bat.''
   Eight times a week, he dives, jumps, spins, leaps, falls and
tumbles into the orchestra pit at Broadway's St. James Theater.
   And audiences gasp. His stunts provide some of the funniest _ and
most unexpected _ moments in ``Largely New York,'' a comedy without
dialogue written by, directed by and starring clown Bill Irwin.
   In the 65-minute entertainment, Irwin battles video technology _
recalcitrant remote controls, temperamental television sets,
malevolent minicams _ and loses hilariously. But the show also
features Gordon, two break dancers named Leon Chesney and Steve
Clemente, a ballerina named Margaret Eginton and a gaggle of dancers
dressed like academics in cap and gown.
   ``Bill Irwin is a pioneer in proving to the show business
establishment that clowns are very talented people,'' Gordon says.
``They are not just buffoons. They reflect human nature. There is a
pervasive American attitude that clowns are the underbelly of show
business, second-class performers. Bill is proving that you can have
roots in the circus and physical comedy and still be a
thinking-man's clown.''
   In the show, Gordon plays a character called the Dean, an
officious authority figure who leads this rubber-legged band of
graduates around the stage. His speciality is a swoon from the
stage. He plunges some 8 feet into the pit.
   ``So far, I haven't been hurt,'' says the performer, knocking on
the makeup table for luck in his St. James dressing room. But don't
worry. His dive is cushioned by a thick mat that covers the floor of
the pit. He also wears kneepads and elbow pads.
   Gordon jumps with the expertise of a high diver, which is what he
was in school. Back at Allegheny College in Meadville, Pa., he was a
four-time All-American springboard diver and an NCAA Division III
national champion.
   But what do you do after you get a degree in sociology and find
that jobs are scarce?
   ``I became a clown,'' says the 35-year-old Gordon, who grew up in
Pittsburgh.
   He was tending bar on the Delta Queen, the famous riverboat that
still makes the journey up and down the Mississippi River. On the
boat, he met several clowns who had worked with the Ringling Bros.
and Barnum &amp; Bailey Circus.
   They inspired him to apply for the circus's Clown College in
Sarasota, Fla.
   ``I had an advantage over other applicants,'' Gordon says. ``I
was a little older and already had gymnastics, but the training in
Sarasota was incredibly rigorous.''
   At the school, Gordon learned clown makeup, how to sew his own
costume and to create his own clown character as well studying the
history of circuses and the fine art of clowning.
   After graduating, Gordon got a job jumping over elephants in the
Red Unit, one of two troupes Ringling sends out to tour the country.
It was hard work. There were 11 shows a week, nearly half of them
packed into a weekend. Gordon did that for a year before leaving and
joining the Big Apple Circus in New York in 1981.
   ``The Ringling Bros. circus was a three-ring circus,'' Gordon
says. ``The Big Apple Circus is one ring and much more focused. It
uses changes in lighting and music to create a mood rather than
spectacle.''
   In the Big Apple Circus, each performer gets a featured spot,
according to Gordon, and because of this individual focus, the
audience is drawn into the show rather than overwhelmed by three
rings of action.
   For the Big Apple Circus, Gordon created a special, very physical
red-nosed clown who talks in monosyllables. His name is Gordoon, a
variation on his creator's last name.
   ``Talking is not one of his featured talents, but he's been known
to lip-sync to the Supremes,'' Gordon adds. ``Gordoon is like my
best pal. Since I've been in `Largely New York,' I haven't played
him in about five months and I miss him.''
   But the performer says he is still working on new routines for
his clown character.
   ``I have a little idea book I keep by my bed,'' Gordon says. ``I
always jot down these seemingly silly ideas. They tend to pile up
and influence one another and something comes out of that.''
   ``There are basically three kinds of clowns,'' he explains. ``A
white-faced clown who is more of an effete, a kind of a straight
man; an ``auguste'' clown who is a bumbler and does a lot of
slapstick like Gordoon, and a character clown like a hobo or a
little old lady.''
   It was at the Big Apple Circus that Irwin first saw Gordon
perform. He later cast him in various productions of ``Largely New
York'' as it made its way from a New York workshop to Seattle to
Washington and on to Broadway.
   Because of his success in ``Largely New York,'' Gordon has
received some interest from film and television people.
   ``But there will always be a place in my heart for clowning,''
Gordon says. ``But I want to work. If that means working on
Broadway, doing physical comedy, film or commercial work, I'll do
it. It feels good to be versatile and a lot of that I learned in the
circus.''

   Colombia has lived in bloodshed almost constantly
since its founding in 1819 and these days the violence is laced with
cocaine and common crime, as well as ideology. But while most of its
South American neighbors struggle for economic survival, Colombia is
striding forward even though it is again at war with itself. This is
one of a series of periodic reports by The Associated Press on the
economic, social and political turbulence that has turned South
America into a continent in crisis.

<TEXT>
   In a simultaneous struggle with
guerrillas, right-wing vigilantes, drug smugglers and assassins,
Colombia resolutely survives.
   To an extent it even thrives.
   The withering crossfire of violence invites predictions of
national perdition. But a country accustomed to decades of
bloodletting goes about its politics and business.
   ``In general terms, the state not only functions, it functions
better every day,'' said Pierre Gilodes, director of the Foreign
Ministry's Institute for Higher Developmental Studies.
   ``We don't know if this is a paradox, or if there is some
relationship between what is happening in the country and the
efficient functioning of the state.''
   In an interview with The Associated Press, Gilodes said he
suspects a kind of perversely positive relationship exists.
   ``The state is pushed to function well, or it will collapse,''
said Gilodes, a French expert contracted by the government to head
the institute.
   The actions of shadowy right-wing groups may help keep some
dissent stifled, he added.
   ``The state can decide that salaries will go up less than the
cost of living and no one protests.''
   Unions that would or should raise their voices ``are under
pressure from private groups that kill labor activists.''
   In addition, he said, leftist guerrilla and right-wing violence
in the countryside is steadily driving both poor and well-to-do to
the cities, to help fuel the more productive urban-based industries
with seed money and cheap labor.
   Colombia's gross national product of about $42 billion grew 3.7
percent last year, lower than the recent annual average but enviable
to most struggling Latin American countries. Annual inflation is 28
percent, a fraction of that of neighboring nations.
   New factories go up daily and, with healthy tax revenues, the
government regularly builds new roads and launches other public
works projects.
   Illegal cocaine earnings bring home an estimated $500 milllion to
$1.2 billion a year and is believed responsible for perhaps
one-fifth of the country's eonomic growth last year.
   But, Gilodes insists, drugs can hardly be called the economic
engine for a country whose $6 billion in legal yearly exports
include coffee, oil, coal and an ever-more diverse array of
non-traditional products such as flowers. He attributes the success
to many years of ``prudent management'' of a sound free-market
economy.
   On the political side, preliminary campaigning for congressional
and municipal elections next March and presidential balloting in May
is already under way. Nobody expects any big hitches.
   Democracy is even broadening its base. Absenteeism at the polls
is shrinking each year, and the country recently celebrated the
first anniversary of the election of the country's 1,009 mayors, who
used to be appointed. All political and social camps declared the
experiment a great success.
   Colombia also thrives culturally, with nightly performances of
plays, symphonies and popular music for a people who love to dance
and can easily distinguish the beat of an inland rumba from a
coastal cumbia.
   Fueled by the works of Latin America's most popular living
novelist, Gabriel Garcia Marquez, Colombia's book industry is
booming. A national poetry contest in the industrial city of
Medellin, the dark heart of cocaine country, drew an enthusiastic
crowd of 7,000 people. A love poem won.
   To a visitor the country's troubles, the machine-gun fire and car
bombs can seem non-existent, or distant, or quickly absorbed in the
bustle of an exuberant people, like a grenade lobbed in thick jungle.
   On May 27, on a major Bogota thoroughfare, 220 pounds of
explosive went off as the chief of the country's security police,
Gen. Miguel Maza Marquez, was passing in his car. He was just
bruised, but seven passersby were mortally wounded.
   Within a few hours, the rubble had been swept up and life was
back to normal.
   But then, in Colombia, death is measured by the dozen.
   Killings this year totaled 9,411 as of early June _ an average 60
a day, according to National Police Department statistics.
   That is down from a daily average of 66 last year, when killings
totaled 24,280 _ eight times the total of 2,924 in California, which
has 28 million inhabitants to Colombia's 31 million. Most adult
Colombian males are said to die by the knife, gun or garrotte.
   Most of the deaths are what police call common homicides,
unrelated to politics. But among this year's victims were 67
politicians and 86 policemen. In the last eight months, the
government insurance company has paid off death benefits to the
families of 771 armed forces members and 15 court officials.
   The police even keep a statistic for mass killings, involving
five or more victims. There have been 34 so far this year, with a
total of 175 victims.
   Occasionally, there is a sign that even expansive Colombia is
having trouble absorbing death in such big numbers.
   In the community called Palestina, on the Cauca River not far
from the city of Manizales, authorities complained that the town
graveyard can't handle all the unclaimed, bullet-riddled corpses
being pulled from the river, according to a dispatch in the Bogota
newpspaper La Prensa. It said 120 bodies had been found since late
last year.
   The country's sources of violence are manifold.

   A variety of leftist guerrilla organizations have been active in
Colombia since the late 1950s and are blamed for 660 deaths so far
in 1989. Their domain includes expanses of little-patrolled and
sparsely populated territory where they impose ``taxes'' and draft
recruits.
   They also are prone to kidnapping for ransom, as are many common
criminals. Nationwide, an average of two kidnappings are reported to
police each day.
   The cocaine business, which surged in the early 1980s when the
American streets and parlors became its biggest customer, makes a
substantial contribution to the death toll _ in deals gone sour and
struggles for power.
   More recently, a new and fearsome element of violence has reared
up: the right-wing death squad, fed by cocaine money and linked to
government security organs and a dark society of ``sicarios,'' the
Spanish term for killers for hire.
   Its victims include not only leftist politicians and government
investigators but ragged tramps, homosexuals, prostitutes and street
urchins in a process euphemistically called ``social cleansing.''
   Allegations abound that the highest spheres of government have
been infiltrated, bought off or terrified into at least reluctant
compliance with the drug bosses' wishes. But the government
dismisses such allegations.
   To reinforce its argument, it points to continued attempts to
assassinate and intimidate top justice and police officials.
   President Virgilio Barco repeatedly has called the narcotics
traffickers and right-wing death squads dangerous enemies of the
state, and he contends that recent police actions have hurt them
badly.
   ``Violence is a mortally wounded beast,'' he declared after the
car-bomb attack on Maza Marquez, which he characterized as the
lashing-out of an angry animal.
   In a recent conversation with reporters, Barco said, ``There are
Judases everywhere, but that doesn't mean this is a corrupt country.
   ``The government, the armed forces, the police are more prepared
each day to control crime in this country,'' he said.
   About 30 percent of Colombians endure poverty, according to
official estimates. The poverty stands in sharp contrast to economic
advancement: a beggar outside an exclusive men's store in Bogota, or
on the road to the Caribbean resort city of Cartagena, where local
and foreign tourists pack five-star hotels and beaches, a ragged
peasant strips what's left on the bones of a cow killed by a motor
vehicle.
   Such misery is said to feed the ranks of leftist guerrilla
groups, but the government also claims some progress on that front.
   One major guerrilla organization, the April 19 Movement, is
engaged in direct talks with the government on how its members might
lay down their arms and join the political process. Some other
groups, including the biggest, the Revolutionary Armed Forces of
Colombia, have expressed an interest in joining what is called the
peace process.
   ``This represents a big change in guerrilla attitudes, compared
with the 1970s,'' when they believed they could take power by force,
said Carlos Jaramillo, a government political scientist.
   Jaramillo is an assistant to the presidential counsel on the
peace process, Rafael Pardo. Many Colombians view the talks with
skepticism, but Jaramillo insisted the time is ripe for an accord.
Guerrillas have been frustrated in decades of effort to extend their
control to important urban centers, he said.
   ``The guerrilla has been unable to change his marginal status,''
he added.
   Jaramillo said that, overall, the violence in Colombia gives the
impression of intensifying.
   ``You're always saying, `It can't get any worse.' And then
something worse happens.''
   But he contended it must be viewed within the context of
virtually constant bloodshed since the country's founding in 1819.
   ``The country has lived through periods of much worse violence,''
he said.
   From 1830 to the turn of the century, Colombia endured 50 bloody
local or national conflicts. And in a period called ``La
Violencia,'' roughly from 1948 to 1959, victims of a largely rural
conflict between the traditional Liberal and Conservative parties
were counted by the truckload. Estimates of the total number of dead
in that decade of violence range from 70,000 to 300,000.
   Jaramillo said he detects a ``new willingness in many sectors of
the country'' to attack and defeat all sources of violence, be they
from the right or the left.
   ``It's as if we've said, well now we've touched bottom,'' he said.

   Colombia's powerful cocaine chieftans,
such as Fabio Ochoa, Gonzalo Rodriguez Gacha and Pablo Escobar
Gaviria, are known by name all across the country, yet they remain
at large, seemingly immune from arrest and prosecution.
   Despite heavy U.S. pressure for their capture and extradition on
smuggling charges, the biggest often seem to slip away from any
attempt to capture and hold them.
   They are said to pay informants in security forces and the
courts. Those they cannot bribe they try to intimidate with death
threats that are not idle. Their victims include Justice Minister
Rodrigo Lara Bonilla, killed in 1984, and Attorney General Carlos
Hoyos, assassinated last year.
   In an interview, Colombia's national police chief, Maj. Gen.
Miguel Gomez Badilla, said he receives threats daily by mail and
telephone but insists the forces of order and justice are not cowed.
   He said the drug bosses are being aggressively persecuted, if not
prosecuted.
   ``Escobar, Gacha, Ochoa _ these people are fugitives. They are
being hunted,'' Gomez said.
   ``While they are in their own territory, it's hard to catch them.
Why? Because there are many people who make their living off them,
and who protect them.
   ``But remember, there was a time when Pablo Escobar was
considered a Robin Hood in certain sections of Medellin,'' where he
financed housing, churches, recreation areas, Gomez said. ``He can't
do that anymore. He has to hide.''
   Gomez, formerly chief of the force's anti-narcotics division, is
considered a top name on the hit-list of the cocaine smugglers and
right-wing death squads. He is constantly accompanied by heavily
armed bodyguards, and his wife's and five children's movements are
restricted.
   He also faces an internal enemy. The ranks of his 80,000-member
force have been aggressively purged, with 1,353 policemen expelled
in the last 18 months for alleged links to narcotics or the
``private justice'' groups _ as the death squads call themselves.
   ``I can't deny that there are police linked to narcotics
trafficking, but we are uncovering them,'' Gomez said.
   He added that said secuirity forces had delivered several
decisive blows in recent months to the cocaine cartels and death
squads, in one case dismantling a lab that held 11,000 pounds of the
powder and striking at several training camps for hired gunmen.
   At the camps authorities find hefty arsenals of the latest in
weaponry, including rocket and grenade launchers, shiny new assault
rifles, automatic pistols, silencers. To police and the military, it
is a fearsome by-product of the drug industry.
   ``The cocaine goes out of the country, and the profits return in
the form of weapons, which can be sold at five or ten times their
purchase price,'' Gomez said.
   He said the government of President Virgilio Barco, however, has
increased spending on sophisticated equipment for the armed forces
and police.
   The United States has helped with $10 million in anti-narcotics
aid and feels it is getting its money's worth.
   ``We're getting more blast for our buck here than in any other
country in Latin America,'' said a locally assigned U.S. Drug
Enforcement Administration official, speaking on condition he not be
identified by name.

   When this city of 350,000 goes to bed,
it is time for Sister Stephany and Father Henry to load bread and
plastic jugs full of hot milk onto their pickup truck and set out
into the night.
   They go in search of the hundreds of children whose only home is
the streets.
   A third of the children they will find, some as young as 5, are
cocaine-paste addicts or sniffers of glue or gasoline; others have
been abandoned by their parents or come from homes of unemployed
workers where there is not enough food. Many survive by selling
cigarettes laced with cocaine-paste or by petty thievery.
   At least 2,000 children and youths roam the streets of this
prosperous city booming from the cocaine produced in the Chapare
sub-tropical region 110 miles to the northeast, where 80 percent of
the coca leaf grown in Bolivia is processed into cocaine.
   When Sister Stephany Murray, 68, who was born in Emmittsburg,
Md., and the Rev. Patrick Henry, 47, of Omaha, Neb., find the
children they pass out the bread and the hot milk in plastic cups.
   ``Distributing milk gives us a chance to make contact with them
and make them feel we are indeed interested in them and they are not
outcasts of society,'' Sister Stephany said. ``It is a friendly
contact. If they are on drugs we try to tell them they can do better
and we are ready to receive them when they are ready to come.''
   She and Father Henry, as everyone calls him, operate two Roman
Catholic Amanecer (Dawn) shelters for homeless youths.
   Sister Stephany, a member of the St. Vincent de Paul Order, has
been working in Cochabamba for 25 years.
   Father Henry is on leave from the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of
Omaha to work as a Maryknoll missionary in Cochabamba. He has been
here five years.
   They said they distribute bread and milk to 150 to 200 children
two nights a week.
   ``Some of the kids leave home because there is nothing to eat,''
Sister Stephany said in an interview. ``They start shining shoes,
they lose contact with their families and they find it easier to
steal or sell cigarettes laced with cocaine paste.''
   Organizations that work with homeless youths say the number of
street kids and cases of youth drug addiction in Cochabamba and
other cities have increased in the last five years chiefly because
of Bolivia's economic difficulties and the availability of drugs.
   Unemployment is more than 20 percent; 35,000 government workers
have been laid off in the last five years as part of the
government's austerity program and, according to the United Nations
Children's Fund, 45 percent of rural children suffer from
malnutrition.
   The Amanecer centers provide provide temporary lodging for street
kids, along with rehabilitation and training programs.
   ``Just about everybody on the streets has used drugs and
practically all of them have had involvement in drug trafficking,''
Father Henry said.
   Several of the youths interviewed at an Amanecer shelter said
they had worked in the cocaine-producing Chapare region. They told
of being arrested by police and taken to a labor camp for drug
offenders in Chapare. At least five youths have died in the last two
years at the camp under suspicious circumstances, Father Henry said.
   ``Children in the Chapare transport chemicals while their parents
as well as youths macerate coca leaves into cocaine with the first
priority being to provide food to live on,'' said Laura Baldivieso,
a psychologist and head of the U.S.-financed Drug Information
Center. ``But the Chapare, instead of resolving the economic
problems of the unemployed, is contributing to a deterioration of
the family and the social structure.''
   ``Many of the kids who come to our center have tread on coca
leaves in the Chapare,'' Father Henry said. ``They are paid $20 a
night to stomp on coca leaves and often part of the payment is in
the form of paste.''
   Many youths arrive from the Chapare with festering wounds or ill
with parasite-borne diseases, yellow fever or tuberculosis, Father
Henry said.
   ``They become exhausted from working all night and for lack of
food,'' he added.
   ``Five years ago people would say that drugs were a North
American problem. They can't say it anymore because drug use has
become so much more widespread and there is cocaine everywhere.''
   After midnight on El Prado, a tree-lined avenue bordered by
restaurants and snack shops, Quechua- and Aymara-speaking Indian
children roam the streets, often selling paste-laced cigarettes for
traffickers to people from all social classes.
   Police cars sometimes stop to question them, but Sister Stephany
said they often threaten to take the children to jail unless they
hand over money, usually the equivalent of $5.
   ``Street kids tell me, `If I don't have the money, I will be
mistreated so I better have enough,' and this encourages stealing,''
she said.
   Although it is illegal to put a child in jail, the organization
Defense for Children-International says dozens of children are
rounded up every night and kept overnight or several days without
food or blankets in dark and filthy jail cells along hardened
criminals.
   ``At its base, the cocaine and street kid problem in Cochabamba
is an economic one,'' Father Henry said. ``Unfortunately there is no
industry that can take up the slack if cocaine stopped. It would be
an overwhelming switch to have all these people come back from the
Chapare when there are no jobs. There are people who are desperate
and are living a very thin line. They won't get rich but at least
they will feed their families.''

<HEAD>Activists Say AIDS Spreading Among Brazil's 7 Million Street Kids</HEAD>

   Health activists fear AIDS is
spreading rapidly among Brazil's estimated 7 million street kids.
   They complain authorities are doing little to stop it.
   ``These children have frequent sexual contact, as prostitutes and
with each other,'' said Flavio Braune Wiik of the Brazilian
Interdisciplinary AIDS Association in Rio de Janeiro. ``Most don't
know what condoms are or how to use them, and they have almost no
access to health care.
   ``Of course it's spreading.''
   Brazil, with 6,421 confirmed AIDS cases overall through April of
this year, is the world's No. 3 AIDS country after the United States
and France.
   Official figures, which activists fear may be low, indicate that
140,000 youngsters living in the streets are infected with the virus.
   The situation is especially troubling in Rio de Janeiro, with
more than 1 million street kids, the highest number in the country,
and 705 confirmed cases of AIDS.
   ``The government spends very little on AIDS prevention programs
of any kind,'' said Wiik. ``And it has almost no special projects
for street kids who have little access to official campaigns.''
   The first AIDS case was reported in Brazil in 1983. But until
early 1987 the government did not place a priority on combating the
virus, arguing that malaria, tuberculosis, Chagas disease, and
numerous other maladies affected more people and thus deserved
higher priority.
   Finally, though, the government launched an anti-AIDS campaign
with public posters and television messages telling of the perils of
AIDS and discussing preventive measures.
   But Wiik said the campaign is almost completely ineffective in
reaching street kids.
   ``Even children who live at home don't learn much about AIDS from
the ads, because they appear only late at night,'' he said in an
interview. ``How are street kids supposed to see them if they don't
have television?''
   Wiik added that the language in the ads was sterilized due to
protests from conservatives and Roman Catholic Church leaders.
   ``These kids don't know what `sperm' or `anal sex' are,'' he
said. ``They only know street talk. ...''
   Making matters worse, an unprecedented economic crisis with
inflation running at around 1,000 percent annually has led to budget
cutbacks in many social programs.
   The Program for the Control of AIDS, an agency of the Health
Ministry, had its 1989 budget cut by 30 percent, to only $10.4
million. That has left the problem of combatting AIDS largely on the
shoulders of state and local governments and volunteer
organizations, and they have even less money in their budges than
federal authorities.
   Wiik said the AIDS Association, which produces educational
materials on AIDS for groups that work with street kids, runs the
only program of its type in this country of 144 million people.
   The problem of controlling the spread of AIDS among street kids
is difficult because to the life they lead.
   Drug use, especially cocaine, is widespread. But most street
youths in Brazil do not inject drugs, activists say, so the spread
of the AIDS virus via contaminated needles is not common.
   The bigger problem is sex.
   Most boys on the streets earn their money by stealing, begging or
prostitution, Juvenile Court files indicate. But, according to
activists, the only real option for girls on the streets is
prostitution.
   ``Girls as young as 9 and 10 often work as prostitutes, sometimes
for a plate of food,'' said Vera Lucia Fernandes de Souza, a
``street kids educator'' with a program organized by the mayor's
office in Rio de Janeiro.
   Many street children also have sex with their companions as well,
further increasing the risk of infection.
   ``Many know little about AIDS or sex,'' Ms. Souza said. ``I've
had girls who were pregnant and thought they `caught it,' like a
cold. And educational work is extremely difficult. It's hard enough
for street kids to remember what time it is let alone to use a
condom _ which they don't have money to buy in any case.''
   Adding to the problem, she said, is the terrible toll street life
takes on the youths.
   ``Without a real home, food, or family, many of these kids think
life has no meaning anyway. They have no hopes for the future, so
they don't think about tomorrow.''
   Street kids who live at Largo do Machado, a public plaza on Rio's
south side, showed little concern when interviewed about contracting
the AIDS virus.
   ``Luis,'' who said he was 14 but looks about 12, said he has
burglarized homes and admitted he had worked as a prostitute to
support himself. He had heard about AIDS, he said, but didn't use
condoms nor did he know anyone who did.
   ``I'm not afraid of dying or anything else,'' he said. ``I wasn't
born to live forever, and I have to eat.''
   Luis said he visits his mother in a slum neighborhood several
hours from downtown Rio every Sunday.
   ``I tell her I sell stuff on the street and beg, so she doesn't
worry.''
   ``Jose,'' an 18-year-old who has lived on the street for five
years, said, ``AIDS will kill you, but I'm going to die one day
anyway.''
   And if he knew he had AIDS would he stop any type of sexual
activity?
   ``No. I'd probably play around more to die sooner.''

<HEAD>Star Watch: Mr. Television at 80: He Doesn't Wear a Dress</HEAD>
<HEAD>With LaserPhoto</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LARRY McSHANE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   Back when television was in diapers, Milton Berle
was in a dress. It was a kinder world then; despite his wardrobe, he
became known as ``Mr. Television.''
   Forty-one years after the debut of ``Texaco Star Theater,'' Berle
wears suits for his rare TV appearances. He smokes big cigars _
Cuban jobs the size of cucumbers. And he has a million memories and
monologues gleaned from a career stretching from vaudeville to video.
   Berle didn't anticipate such success when he moved from the
movies (remember ``Sun Valley Serenade''?) to the small screen on
June 8, 1948.
   ``The power? Nobody knew the power of television. I didn't. I
swear I didn't,'' said the man known to millions as Uncle Miltie
when he was television's undisputed king, holding millions of
Americans hostage in their living rooms each Tuesday night.
   ``The Texaco show of 40 years ago, there were no laugh machines.
If the joke bombed, you died,'' recalled Berle, in town to pitch
``Milton Berle: The Second Time Around,'' a three-tape video
collection of ``Texaco'' clips.
   ``That's why I used to say, `Leave a 9 o'clock wakeup call for
the audience.' Or, `Here's another one you may not care for.' But
that's all gone. Unfortunate.''
   While Berle was television's first major star _ Time called him
``a strange new phenomenon'' _ modesty (and the chance for a cheap
joke) prevents him from claiming he was the one behind its creation.
   ``I didn't start it all,'' Berle said in an interview.
   Pause. Remove cigar. Punchline.
   ``It had to be invented first.''
   Da-dum-dum.
   Uncle Miltie at 80 may wear thick pancake makeup and pitch
underwear on television, but he still has a keen mind and an
incredible recall of names, dates and places.
   An hour-long chat with Berle includes tales of his days and
nights in the Havana Madrid (``51st between Seventh and Broadway''),
Dave's Blue Room (``right on 52nd Street'') and The 500 Club (``in
Atlantic City _ owned by a guy named D'Amato'').
   And he can drop some names: Elvis Presley, Frank Sinatra, Jerry
Lewis, Danny Thomas, Walter Huston, Talullah Bankhead, Basil
Rathbone. Berle's worked with them all; he also remembers working
with a guy named Dino Crosetti from Stubenville, Ohio.
   ``I said, `Dino's a good name, but there's got to be an easier
name. Something like Dean Kramer or Dean Morton or Dean Martin,'''
said Berle. ``That's how he got the name.''
   Martin and Lewis were later guests on ``Texaco Star Theater,''
which dominated all competition in the late 1940s and early '50s. An
estimated 90 percent of America's sets were tuned to Uncle Miltie
when he was on.
   Berle began his career at age 5, starting out in a silent movie
dubbed ``Tillie's Punctured Romance.'' Even then, he worked with the
big names; the film starred Charlie Chaplin.
   By age 12, Berle was on Broadway. He appeared in more than 50
silent films. He did vaudeville, he played the Catskills. And then,
after 35 years in the business, Berle went video.
   He later went on to other variety shows, appearing on ``The Kraft
Music Hall'' in the late '50s and serving as host for ``The Milton
Berle Show'' in the '60s. He never gave up live performing; after
years of playing in Las Vegas, he now plays twice a year in Atlantic
City and Lake Tahoe.
   Last year, he starred with fellow veterans Danny Thomas and Sid
Caesar in a made-for-television flick called ``Side by Side.'' His
current TV spots are as a pitchman for underwear in which he
confesses, ``At my age, I've done just about everything in my BVDs.''
   He's also written a couple of books: a self-titled 1974
autobiography and ``B.S. I Love You,'' a collection of jokes and
gags picked up during his long association with the Friars Club.
   ``I get interviews where people say, `Milton, that's a helluva
risk you took.' I said, `It was, but it wasn't. Not with the acts I
had.' I used to book the best acts available,'' Berle recalled.
``And I told 'em, `Don't worry about the cameras. They'll catch
you.'''
   Today, Berle doesn't watch much TV: ``Debates, sports, `20-20'
and `60 Minutes.' And O'Neil _ what's that? _ `McNeil-Lehrer.' So I
don't watch.''
   But with television marking its 50th anniversary, Berle's role in
the medium has again been spolighted. Along with his dress-wearing
antics, the Berle legacy includes a reputation as a joke-snatcher _
``The Thief of Bad Gags,'' the great columnist Walter Winchell once
called him. Berle maintains he started this himself as a publicity
scam.
   And the dresses?
   ``Too long a story on that,'' said Berle, glancing quickly at two
female publicists in the room. ``I'll tell you alone.''
   Berle is winding down when he's asked about the first night of
``Texaco'' _ who was on the show? He pauses, removes his well-chewed
stogie and looks straight ahead, going back 41 years in 15 seconds.
   ``June 8, 1948,'' said Uncle Miltie, pausing again. ``Sophie
Tucker. And a dance team, they were wonderful. Don't know if you
ever saw them: the Zoneys. A brother-sister team. Didn't speak to
each other; fought like cats and dogs. A great harmonica artist,
Stan Fisher. And (bandleader _ `Is Everybody Happy?') Ted Lewis.''
   Berle remembers all the guests; he also remembers the immediate,
overwhelming reaction his show produced.
   ``The next day I walked out of my house on 88th Street, took a
cab to the Friars for lunch. I decided to walk the last few blocks.
I walked a couple of blocks, and the people were all following me,''
the great entertainer said.
   ``I never knew so many people saw the show that night. It was the
next day. That's how quickly. ... The instantaneous value of that
was very remarkable.
   ``One show.''

<HEAD>The Artists: Enfant Terrible Goes Traditional</HEAD>
<HEAD>With LaserPhoto</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARY CAMPBELL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   She was once an enfant terrible of modern dance,
and later became one of the most famous choreographers to emerge
from avant-garde dance. Today, Twyla Tharp is a little more
traditonal: She works for a ballet company. ``I'm an old-West,
pioneer type person. You just have to examine where your fences are
built. I have no fences. I have open spaces. I don't like
categorizing people or dancing, except into good or bad,'' the
48-year-old choreographer says.
   Tharp, who choreographed for her own modern dance company and the
movies ``Hair,'' ``Ragtime,'' ``Amadeus'' and ``White Nights,''
joined American Ballet Theater last summer. And, never one to move
in mincing steps, she presented three new dances on the same night
during Ballet Theater's current season at the Metropolitan Opera.
   ``I like setting new challenges for myself,'' she said in an
interview. ``The work has all been done since August, with the Paris
Opera Ballet thrown in.''
   The choreographer dissolved Twyla Tharp Dance last July, and she
and eight or nine dancers, about half her troupe, joined ABT. ``I
wouldn't have disbanded and not worked,'' she says. ``You never go
from somewhere to nowhere.''
   The reason for giving up her own company, she says, was economic.
``The company was very well run. We didn't have a deficit. We had
done over six months of touring a year for two years in a row. Not
many dancers were enthusiastic about that. My fund-raising became
more and more a concern. I had less and less time in a studio. New
work wasn't happening.''
   She hasn't had a day off since August. ``When you're working as
hard as I am, a day off doesn't help. I'm willing to kill myself and
everybody else to get it right.'' But the work since August has been
creating new ballets.
   First she choreographed ``Bum's Rush,'' balletic vaudeville, then
worked on ``Everlast,'' presented like a 1920s musical comedy, with
the lively plot told in dance and three singers and a pianist
onstage performing appropriate Jerome Kern songs. She started
``Quartet,'' in neoclassical ballet style, before she finished
``Everlast.''
   When Ballet Theater took time off and before she finished
``Quartet,'' she created ``Rules of the Game'' for the Paris Opera
Ballet. She flew back to the United States, finished ``Quartet,''
flew back to Paris and found her leading ballerina, Sylvie Guillem,
had left the company for the British Royal Ballet. So she rewrote.
   World premieres kept her hopping: ``Quartet'' in Chicago Feb. 4;
``Bum's Rush'' in Chicago Feb. 8; ``Rules of the Game'' in Paris
Feb. 17; and ``Everlast'' in San Francisco March 2.
   About differences between modern dance and ballet, Tharp is
emphatic.
   ``As far as I'm concerned, they're nonexistent. Since (George)
Balanchine made `Agon,' to me the determining factor is not whether
the dancers are in bare feet; it is the welding of dance tradition
with innovational movement and concept and perception about what
society is and how it functions,'' she said. ``I think there was not
enough real choice being exerted by modern choreographers. Given
that choice, this whole issue disappeared.''
   She first choreographed for a ballet company in 1973 when she
used Beach Boys recordings for the Joffrey Ballet. A jazzy ``Push
Comes to Shove'' in 1976 was her first dance for Mikhail
Baryshnikov, now artistic director of Ballet Theater.
   About ``Everlast,'' she says, ``It's a fully developed narrative.
It has a boxer who begins in love with the wrong girl and ends up
with the right girl, through the advice of several characters in the
plot.
   ``The (Jerome) Kern songs were around. They were written for
shows. Need a song where the ingenue falls for the guy? Here are 50
of those. It had to be the right one of the 50, in terms of how it
registered in the overall flow of this piece.''
   Both ``Quartet,'' to Terry Riley music, and ``In the Upper
Room,'' which Tharp choreographed for her own company in 1986 and
which Ballet Theater danced here for the first time this season, are
plotless. But for Tharp nothing is really plotless.
   ``Balanchine thought there is a narrative in everything. Center
stage is a different place than upstage left. Who appears in those
places and at what time tells a story.''
   She said ``In the Upper Room'' isn't meant to be biblical. ``It's
an abstract plot. It's about completion, the way things reinforce
one another, growth and development.
   ``Whether audiences could verbalize what it means or not, I don't
think is important. I think one of the reasons the piece is so
popular is that people feel it makes a constructive and positive
statement: if you make an investment it will be returned, in kind,
with interest.''
   ``In the Upper Room'' is set to Philip Glass music, which Tharp
has been using for 20 years. She wanted to call it ``Glass,'' and
sometimes does in conversation. But because Jerome Robbins
choreogaphed ``Glass Pieces'' for the New York City Ballet, the
composer chose a different name.
   In ``Rules of the Game,'' the dance she choreographed for the
Paris Opera Ballet, ``The rules of the theatrical game was what I
was attempting to express,'' she said. ``This season, after some
experiences I'd had, I began to feel I understood some rules of some
games. I set about to build on them rather than, avant-garde
fashion, start from nowhere.''
   She fought leaving the avant-garde, she says. ``But at a certain
point you have to acknowledge, `I've learned some things and here
they are.'
   ``The reason I'm interested in these rules of the game is they've
been lost to some degree, since Jerry Robbins stopped working in
theater. Young people don't know how to structure. They don't have
access to the rules. The game hasn't been played in a very long time.
   ``The avant-garde is everybody trying to be smarter than what
works perfectly well a lot of the time. I went through it, as long
as possible.
   ``A piece looking avant-garde never has been my concern. My
concern has always been to do something of quality that would have
some impact, if it stayed around, or influenced something. I've
never been one just for shock value.''

<HEAD>Music Makers: Unexpurgated Johnny Rotten, Er, John Lydon</HEAD>
<HEAD>With LaserPhoto</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By HILLEL ITALIE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Nearly 13 years ago, the sinister cackle of young
Johnny Rotten kicked off ``Anarchy in the U.K.'' and the brief,
remarkable history of The Sex Pistols.
   ``All we're trying to do is destroy everything,'' the singer
boasted at the time, and the punk band made music that lived up to
his words.
   Such songs as ``Holidays in the Sun,'' ``Pretty Vacant'' and
``God Save the Queen'' were an enraged response to the complacent,
mainstream rock of the mid-1970s and opened the way for The Clash,
Gang of Four, and Elvis Costello.
   The Sex Pistols made just one album before breaking up. Rotten
quickly distanced himself from his old band, reverting to his
original name, John Lydon, and forming Public Image Ltd., which had
a danceable sound that drew upon a wide variety of music.
   Public Image Ltd. has been more durable, if less exciting, than
The Sex Pistols, and has just released ``9,'' its ninth album. The
current lineup consists of Lydon, guitarist John McGeoch, drummer
Bruce Smith and bassist Allan Dias.
   With a 10th record already in mind, Lydon was in a jovial mood
during a recent interview, offering his opinions on music and
movies, success and failure, politics and Donahue.
   Rock 'n' roll:
   ``I've always liked music and I've always thought, `Hmm, maybe I
should be doing something like this because these really aren't the
records I wanted to hear. So when the chance came along, I jumped to
it, both feet straight into the deep end.''
   Country singer K.D. Lang:
   ``I think what she does for country music and sound is wonderful,
absolutely new. I've always perceived country music as being dead
from the head down, but I like her songs very much.''
   Pop star Debbie Gibson:
   ``Life's too short to be telling lies. While the Debbie Gibsons
of the world are being pumped out, it's very difficult. It's all
factory programmed. If you toe the line and compromise, life will be
very easy for you, but ultimately very unsatisfying. Too many famous
people lead terrible lifestyles because of that.''
   The influence of African music:
   ``I saw the connection. It fit in perfectly with my own Irish
folk culture. Irish folk music does relate very much to Bulgarian,
which relates to Turkey, which relates to the Arab, all the way
around, going into Morocco, back up through Spain again. Marvelous.''
   The Sex Pistols:
   ``It got very, very stale and I had to call it quits. It was the
Pistols then, it's Public Image now. I always offer an alternative.''
   The film ``Sid and Nancy,'' which depicted the life of Sex
Pistols bassist Sid Vicious:
   ``To be misrepresented so badly was a great disappointment.
(Director) Alex Cox never communicated with any of the Pistols, not
even the manager at that time, none of us. So how on earth can you
present that film as a semi-documentary?
   ``It was like `Fantasy Island' gone wrong. How can you use
someone like Joe Strummer and Iggy Pop as research. What do they
know about the workings of the Pistols? Nothing. You might as well
have asked ... Liberace and probably would have achieved better
results.''
   Performing drunk:
   ``I put that down to inexperience. Not having respect for myself.
Going on stage drunk is a tragedy. I did do that a few times because
I was so bloody nervous. The end result was a shambles.
   ``Apologies, folks, for those bad old days but there weren't too
many of them.''
   Non-violence:
   ``If you want to destroy a government, it's very easy. Just lay
down your tools, all at once. The country will collapse overnight.
   ``The minute you have to kill people for a cause, you have no
cause. You immediately show you have no respect for human life.
There's no real need for it. We can change this planet, Gandhi
proved that.''
   Failure:
   ``Before every gig, I'm absolutely terrified, completely. I want
every show to be the ultimate. Once I'm on, then I'm fine, you know,
home run. But that build up _ bloody dreadful.''
   Music video:
   ``I've had some wonderful fantasies in my life. I envisioned
myself as operating this video company. I realized after three weeks
I loathed video. I cannot stand it. I don't like watching it. These
are Poloroids, they're trivial. I don't like fiddling about with
cameras.''
   Lyrics:
   ``People don't actually listen to the songs they're dancing to.
... I had to listen to every single word used. I just liked
language. It's our major achievement as a species.''
   Songwriting:
   ``On a lot of my songs, I just sit down and write it, line after
line after line. I keep running the ideas through my head and
finally the best way of doing it just occurs to me quite naturally.''
   His Public Image bandmates:
   ``If you can't get on with people, there's no point. I don't care
about looks, I care about personality, some sense of musical
innovation. I'm not interested in some sort of manufactured pop or
set, organized musical things, that bores me.''
   Phil Donahue's hair:
   ``You can't tell me that's not a wig! You can see it on the back
of his head. Most wig manufacturers are pretty sophisticated, but
Phil isn't!''
   Imitators:
   ``Don't imitate me. Don't ever imitate me. That would not be a
form of flattery at all. That would be worse than being in a heavy
metal band.''

<HEAD>Books and Authors: T. Coraghessan Boyle Is As Easy as Hazelnut Dacquoise</HEAD>

   Picture a 6-foot-3, rail-thin author whose heroes
include Bruce Springsteen, Washington Irving and James Beard.
   Imagine a rock 'n' roll gourmet and prize-winning novelist who
dreams of making literature as entertaining as music television, as
profound as a man's search for his lost father.
   Summing up the work of T. Coraghessan Boyle is as easy as apple
pie, or perhaps hazelnut dacquoise. Start with a generous sample of
absurdist humor. For instance, ``Modern Love,'' the story of a man,
a woman, and some very safe sex; or ``Hard Sell,'' in which the
Ayatollah finds salvation in three-piece suits and baseball.
   Add a legend or two.
   Recreate the events that led to the death of blues pioneer Robert
Johnson, and name the story after two of his greatest songs,
``Stones in My Passway, Hellhound on My Trail.'' Or, take the
grandson of Robert Jordan, hero in ``For Whom the Bell Tolls,''
nickname him ``Cup of Soup,'' and send him to fight the Contras in
Nicaragua.
   Throw in a dash of Americana. Combine the lives of Indians and
Dutch settlers in the 17th century, the tragic 1949 anti-communist
riots in Peekskill, N.Y., and a contemporary love quadrangle among
hippies and yuppies, and you have Boyle's acclaimed novel, ``World's
End,'' winner of the PEN-Faulkner Award in 1988.
   Top it off with the deepest heartbreak. Imagine an alcoholic
unable to save his marraige, who dreams he is too helpless to keep
his son from drowning, whose favorite lyric provides the title for
Boyle's latest collection of short stories, ``If the River Was
Whiskey.'' (Viking, $17.95).
   ``What I've learned from experience is that anything can be a
story,'' Boyle said. ``I don't see things in terms of limitations. I
don't care if someone says that's not realistic, or that's too
preposterous or that was in the newspaper.''
   Anything can mean President Eisenhower and the wife of Soviet
leader Nikita Khrushchev in a whirlwind romance, or a woman leaving
her husband for the love of a chimpanzee or the seduction of a
cynical restaurant critic by taglierini alla pizzaiola with homemade
fennel sausage and chopped tomatoes.
   ``It's kind of a way of looking at the world and making an absurd
joke,'' he said. ``I guess from the beginning I didn't want to write
strict realistic stories. Ninety percent of what I do has been
comic, even if it's grimly comic like `World's End.'''
   Boyle, born in 1948, had no interest in writing at all while
growing up in Peekskill, N.Y. Uninspired by fingerpainting and music
classes, his hobbies included watching television and reading comics.
   ``Unfortunately, creative writing wasn't emphasized in the
schools when I was as kid,'' Boyle recalled. ``I didn't know
anything about it until I was a junior in college (State University
of New York-Potsdam). I thought it might be fun. It wasn't fun, but
I found I was addicted to it and very good at it.''
   In 1972, Boyle enrolled in the Writers' Workshop at the
University of Iowa, taking classes with John Cheever and John Irving
among others. He submitted ``Descent of Man,'' a collection of short
stories, as his Ph.D. dissertation and the book was eventually
published in 1979.
   He began as a ``cult'' writer, a well-kept secret whose audiences
greeted his stories like fans at a heavy metal concert. After
another set of short stories, ``Greasy Lake,'' and a pair of novels,
``Water Music'' and ``Budding Prospects,'' Boyle tapped into a wide
readership with ``World's End.''
   ``I wanted to address the fact that I pretty much ignored the
history of the area I grew up in. In elementary school, we talked
about the history of the Revolutionary War, but you didn't get the
sense it took place outside the window.''
   Boyle researched the history of New York's Hudson River Valley,
where Peekskill is located, added some personal experiences and
applied his unique perspective in weaving fact and fiction.
   ``History is a version,'' Boyle said, ``the actual facts are a
version. Who was there, what ax do they have to grind, whose party
and what faction are they coming from? How come somebody says the
opposite thing?
   ``Fiction is maybe a more imaginative version. You can get into
the minds of characters and ascribe the motivations.''
   Walter Van Brunt, the central character of ``World's End,'' is
haunted by the memory of his father, who fled to Alaska after
secretly collaborating with local rednecks involved in the Peekskill
riots.
   Boyle, whose parents both died from alcohol-related diseases, has
confronted the horror felt by Walter when his father tells him,
``It's in the blood, Walter. It's in the bones.'' He sees writing as
a way of avoiding past difficulties with alcohol and drug abuse.
   ``I hope to rise above it, but you never know. Everything is by
accident and that's a very frightening sort of concept. We want
reason. We want to see how the car works and how you pull it apart
and put it back together again.''
   He is completing a new novel, ``East Is East,'' the story of a
Japanese man in Georgia, and hopes to maintain a spontaneous
approach to writing.
   ``When you're working, it's not a calculated process,'' he says.
``It's like building a building, but you don't have a set of plans.
I don't sit down and worry at night about what direction I'm going
in my next book. I just have an idea and I try to express it.''

<HEAD>Nashville Sound: The Fleetwood Mac of Country Music</HEAD>

   Highway 101, the hottest vocal band in
country music, took its name after roads in California and Minnesota
and its style from the pop group Fleetwood Mac.
   The four-piece band, voted group of the year in 1988 and 1989 by
the Academy of Country Music, formed in California in the mid-1980s
with the idea of becoming the Fleetwood Mac of country music.
   Highway 101 hasn't sold 15 million albums like Fleetwood Mac's
``Rumours,'' but the energy of its music and the vocals of Paulette
Carlson have drawn comparisons to Fleetwood Mac's Stevie Nicks and
Christine McVie.
   In a rapid rise to the top in country music, Highway 101 has
turned out three No. 1 records: ``Do You Love Me Just Say Yes'' last
September; ``Cry, Cry, Cry'' in 1988; and ``Somewhere Tonight'' in
1987.
   Four other singles made the Top 10 of the country charts. The
band's two albums, ``Highway 101'' and ``Highway 101 2,'' also did
well. They performed 140 concerts last year, doing shows with
country stars such as Hank Williams Jr., the Judds and Reba McEntire.
   ``I think it was the right time for a band situation like this,''
said Highway 101 guitarist Jack Daniels. ``We have kind of a style,
an approach, that's carefree and dynamic as opposed to playing it
safe and smooth and slick.''
   Said lead guitarist Curtis Stone, ``It was definitely a musical
adventure we all participated in.''
   Scott ``Cactus'' Moser, the band's drummer, rounds out the four.
The men are all from the Los Angeles area and Carlson is from
Minnesota, calling both tiny Winsted and equally small Moose Lake
her home.
   Borrowing from roads in their home states, the four decided to
call themselves Highway 101.
   ``It was the link between the guys on the West Coast and Paulette
in Minnesota,'' said Daniels. ``But in our travels, we've seen
several others in the country. It's sort of a network.''
   All four members had solid professional experience before forming
Highway 101. Moser had played drums for Johnny Rivers, Jennifer
Warnes and others. Daniels hit the road at age 17 with country
performer Freddie Hart. Carlson had recording experience as a solo
singer. Stone, the son of a song publisher, had written songs for
Crystal Gayle, Juice Newton and others.
   ``We had put in time in various other bands,'' Stone said. ``I
think we paid our dues individually.''
   Just as the band was getting together, Moser and Stone even
appeared briefly in the movie ``Back to School'' with Rodney
Dangerfield and did the soundtrack to the film.
   ``I sang the first verse to `Twist and Shout' and Cactus played
the drums,'' Stone said. ``Rodney took the mike away from me and
that was about it.''
   Their configuration is unique among country music recording
artists: a woman lead singer who also plays guitar with three
accompanying musicians who share vocal responsibilities.
   ``It's helped,'' Stone said of the arrangement. ``We're the first
band that did it; we're the first that had a female singer.''
   Said Daniels, ``We are all musicians and all singers. It's
nebulous why it all works. If anyone knew the answer, everyone would
be lining up doing it.
   ``We did a few things experimentally to find our groove, our
niche. It wasn't necessarily what would sell to the public. It was
what do we do best together. It took us a little bit to discover
that. Once we did, we felt good with it and fortunately, people
liked that.
   ``When we first came out, other musicians said we were playing
raw energy. I think that sometimes music gets homogenized in the
recording process. To be clean and safe, it loses its humanism. Our
records were more live sounding.''
   Stone agrees.
   ``There's a lot of spontaneous things that happen in our music
that you don't hear a lot on record (elsewhere).''
   There's a good-natured tiff among the group about numbering their
albums. The guys think it's clever but Carlson doesn't.
   ``We went with `Highway 101 2' and got a lot of flak from
Paulette,'' Stone said. ``But we thought it was pretty cute because
it could be Highway 101 2, Highway 101 squared, Highway 101 to the
second power, whatever you want to say. But she's adamant about
fighting it.''

<HEAD>Time Campaign: Profits More Certain With Time-Warner Than With Paramount</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOYCE M. ROSENBERG</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Time Inc. has begun its campaign to woo
shareholders away from an unsolicited $10.7 billion takeover bid
from Paramount Communications Inc. and win their support for Time's
$14 billion tender offer for Warner Communications Inc.
   Basically, Time's tack is to tell shareholders the instant
gratification that Paramount's $175-a-share all-cash bid offers is
an illusion, and that they'll profit more in the long run by holding
on to their stock and allowing the Time-Warner merger to go through.
   Time took its campaign to the shareholders in a letter released
to the press Saturday. The media giant spelled out the reasons why
its board rejected the Paramount bid and amended the terms of its
earlier stock-swap merger agreement with Warner to include a
$70-a-share offer for Warner.
   The letter _ which essentially reiterated points Time officials
made in statements and interviews Friday _ told shareholders that
Paramount's offer was ``highly conditional and subject to many
uncertainties, including obtaining the necessary $14 billion of
financing and all required regulatory approvals.''
   The company repeated its estimate that it would take as long as a
year for Paramount to win the approvals required from about 800
cable television systems for which Time now holds franchises. That
would delay the completion of Paramount's bid and, consequently,
payments to Time shareholders for their stock.
   Time is making the franchises a key part of its strategy. Time
President Nicholas J. Nicholas Jr. led off an interview Friday by
zeroing in on the cable operations and warning further that
Paramount won't get financing if it doesn't win title to Time's
assets _ including the cable operations.
   Time's cable TV arm, American Television and Communications Corp.
of Stamford, Conn., said Sunday that it had filed a lawsuit seeking
to block Paramount's tender offer unless Paramount first gains
approval for the transfer of all of ATC's cable system franchises.
   The Connecticut Superior Court suit claims that Paramount's bid
to acquire Time stock through a trust could violate the terms of ``a
large majority'' of ATC's 767 local cable TV franchises agreements,
thereby invalidating them.
   The agreements would be invalidated because their terms state
that ownership of the franchises cannot change hands without the
approval of the municipalities or other agencies that granted them,
the suit says.
   In a response Sunday, Paramount said: ``This is another
diversionary suit without substance. We are going to move promptly
to dismiss it.''
   In its shareholder letter and an accompanying Securities and
Exchange Commission filing, Time charged that the terms of
Paramount's financing have not been determined or negotiated.
   Paramount said it remained confident ``the conditions will be
satisfied with reasonable promptness'' and said it would continue to
pursue Time. Nicholas _ who under the Time-Warner proposal will
eventually be chairman of the combined companies _ said Time
officials expected the unwanted suitor to raise its bid.
   But even if Paramount does put more money on the table, Time will
keep reminding stockholders of the conditions that will still be
attached to the bid. And it will keep talking about the future of
Time and Warner.
   Time's letter said shareholders ultimately would benefit from the
creation of Time-Warner Inc. because the price of their Time stock
would rise after the merger, reflecting the assets and cash flow of
both companies.
   Time stockholders would have ``an opportunity ... to share in the
higher values expected from the pursuit of Time's long-term
strategic objective to become a worldwide media and entertainment
company,'' the letter said.
   Shareholders of both Time and Warner had been scheduled to vote
Friday on the original merger proposal. But Time said the meeting
would be adjourned until June 30 and that shareholders would vote
only on the election of directors and other matters not related to
the merger.
   Time said the early returns of proxies mailed in connection with
the original agreement strongly supported the Time-Warner
combination. However, many of these proxies likely were received
before Paramount announced its $175-per-share cash bid on June 6.
   Time outlined on Friday a two-stage offer under which it would
pay $70 a share in cash for 100 million Warner shares in a tender
offer and then exchange $70 a share in cash and securities for the
remaining 100 million shares of Warner stock.
   A merger of Time and Warner would drive up the cost of acquiring
the company. The acquisition of Warner also would increase Time's
debt load and make it less attractive to would-be bidders.
   Under the agreement announced in March, Time stockholders would
have received a share in the new company, Time-Warner Inc., for each
Time share while Warner shareholders would get 0.465 of a share of
the new company for each of their Warner shares.
   Time conceded in its letter that the original Time-Warner merger
plan had accounting and financial advantages because it involved an
exchange of stock that would be lost under the new proposal.
   But Time officials said the company would issue fewer or no new
shares after the merger, giving each existing Time share a greater
proportion of Time-Warner's assets and cash flow.

<HEAD>Small Brewery Aims To `Score A Few Points' With Racy Ad Campaign</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARYANN MROWCA</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>STEVENS POINT, Wis. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A small Wisconsin beer-maker is
brewing a new image with slick television ads that may be a bit hard
to swallow for some longtime Point Beer drinkers.
   The beer, once touted on T-shirts as ``not just for breakfast
anymore,'' is featured in 30-second commercials with fast-paced
music, the glossy look of national ads and quick shots of
long-legged women in short skirts.
   One shows a couple falling on a bed; each ends with an attractive
blonde and the slogan ``Score a few Points ... tonight!''
   The commercials have aired frequently since Memorial Day weekend
but only on the television stations in the Wausau-Stevens Point area.
   In that small market, Point Beer is going head-to-head with
national brands in its television campaign, said Kenneth Shibilski,
Stevens Point Brewery president.
   ``Today, more sizzle is sold than steak,'' Shibilski said last
week. ``People are drinking more of the image than the product.''
   He said about 75 percent of the private brewery's sales are
within a 50-mile area of is home in Stevens Point, a city of about
23,000 in north-central Wisconsin.
   The brewery hopes the ads can change its image as the hometown
beer that Dad used to drink to a quality, fun brew young adults will
choose for a loyal brand, said Shibilski.
   The brewery, established in 1857, also hopes the commercials can
stem a 15 percent drop in sales from three years ago, he said.
   Point, like a vanishing number of other small breweries, has to
do something to compete with bigger beer names that can price their
products lower and are better known, said Shibilski, president of
the Brewers Association of America.
   The hometown reaction to the commercials has been mostly positive
but people are a bit stunned by them, local bartenders said.
   ``A lot of people don't feel that what they (the ads) are
protraying is Stevens Point,'' said Tina Kerske, who has poured
Point from the tap for 2{ years at The Thirsty Whale in Stevens
Point.
   Women at her bar are more likely to wear jeans and T-shirts
rather than short skirts, she said.
   ``They keep saying they want to meet a woman who dresses like
that and drinks Point,'' she said.
   In Wausau, Todd Rasmussen, 33, the manager of Scott Street Steak
&amp; Pub, said: ``People like the idea of a national-looking
commercial. ... The only thing negative I heard is that they (the
commercials) are too liberal for this conservative of an area.''
   Shibilski defended the ads as spicy but not sexist.
   The couple shown falling onto a bed as a voiceover says,
``Remember, when the party's over, there are better things to do
than drive drunk'' is fully clothed, he noted.
   The Point commercials are aimed at 21- to 25-year-old men because
they are the heaviest beer drinkers, said Rick Stone, a partner at
Lindsay &amp; Stone Advertising Inc. in Madision, which created the
campaign.
   ``Our overall strategy for Point is to try to develop some fun
around the product,'' Stone said.
   Shibilski said it is still too early to tell what effect the
commercials will have on sales but that the brewery plans to run the
ads all summer and looks for results farther in the future.
   ``We want to be one of the breweries that's going to be around in
the 21st century,'' he said.

<HEAD>Kraft Could Have Handled Car Contest Mix-up Better: Experts</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   When Kraft realized its ``Ready to Roll'' contest
was flawed and had produced more winners than losers, the food
company should have decided on a response more quickly, public
relations experts say.
   The contest, in which hundreds or possibly thousands of people
``won'' the same $17,000 Dodge minivan, was a public relations
disaster that left Kraft officials scurrying for a response when the
error was discovered June 11.
   ``Our advice to Kraft immediately would have been to go public
with this thing,'' said Walter Mulhall, co-director of
Mulhall-Kemplin Communications. ``The way to handle things is to
offer a lot of explanation and candor, and they're certainly not
being candid.''
   Kraft, based in the Chicago suburb of Glenview and known formally
as the Kraft General Foods Group of Philip Morris Cos., offered to
make up for the mix-up by quadrupling the number of prizes, giving
away cash and adding special drawings.
   To win, a customer had to match two halves of a picture of a van,
one from packages of cheese and the other printed in newspaper
advertisements. A printing error apparently gave nearly everybody
matching pieces.
   Kraft announced Thursday it would pay $250 to everybody who was
holding a winning ticket for the van, and other cash payouts to
winners of other prizes _ bicycles, skateboards and cheese. Winners
will be eligible for a drawing for four vans.
   ``The one thing that the public understands is that people screw
up,'' said Pat Jackson, editor of PR Reporter, an industry magazine.
``Kraft should have gone public. If they carried it off with
humility, they could have gotten the public on their side. Instead,
this kind of last-minute payoff doesn't take care of all the
disgruntled people.''
   At least two lawsuits have been filed because of the botched
contest.
   Jackson said the slow response led people to believe the company
had something to hide.
   ``When Kraft ducks under the covers, it immediately sends the
message, `They are lying,''' he said. ``Facts have nothing to do
with getting people on your side. It's all a matter of perception.''
   The company also erred in not calling on top executives to
address the mix-up, many in the public relations industry said.
   ``A CEO himself has to have the guts to come out and exert some
authority, not hide behind the statements of his PR director,''
added Ted Pincus, chairman of the Financial Relations Board.
   Kraft spokeswoman Kathy Knuth would not comment Friday on the
company's handling of the contest beyond saying, ``This is my job;
it certainly has been difficult, and it has been interesting.''

trading today. Gold prices were little changed.
   Foreign currency dealers said they expected trading to be calm
this week with the dollar consolidating at current levels.
   ``After a truly historic week with violent fluctuations in heavy
trading last week, the market is realistically due for a break,''
said one trader in Rome.
   In Tokyo, where trading ends before Europe's business day begins,
the dollar rose 0.45 yen to a closing 145.50 yen. Later, in London,
it was quoted at 145.27 yen.
   Other dollar rates at midmorning compared with late Friday's
prices included: 1.9925 West German marks, up from 1.9915; 1.7205
Swiss francs, down from 1.7213; 6.7535 French francs, down from
6.7620; 2.2438 Dutch guilders, up from 2.2385; 1,447.00 Italian
lire, up from 1,443.50; and 1.1980 Canadian dollars, up from 1.1973.
   In London, the dollar fell slightly against the British pound,
and traders said it was due to the poor showing of the governing
Conservative Party in European Parliament elections.
   It cost $1.5352 to buy one pound on Monday compared with $1.5340
late Friday.
   Gold opened in London at a bid price of $362.50 a troy ounce,
compared with late Friday's $363.75. At midmorning, the city's five
major bullion dealers fixed a recommended price of $363.60.
   In Zurich, the bid price was $363.85, up from $363.75 late Friday.
   Silver was quoted in London at a bid price of $5.31 a troy ounce,
up from Friday's $5.27.
   All financial institutions in Hong Kong were closed today for
official birthday celebrations of Queen Elizabeth II.

   Share prices on the Tokyo Stock Exchange fell today,
while the dollar rebounded against the Japanese yen after Friday's
sharp loss.
   The 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average closed at 33,013.18, down
41.99 points, or 0.13 percent. It had closed at 33,055.17 on Friday
after rising 142.08 points.
   The dollar closed at 145.50 yen, up 0.45 yen from its close of
145.05 yen on Friday, when it fell 6.25 yen. The dollar opened today
at 144.20 and ranged between 144.15 and 145.58 yen.
   Before Friday's fall, the dollar had gained 10.65 yen since June
5.
   ``During the afternoon, stock prices stayed level except for a
temporary rise in the Nikkei Average of about 100 yen,'' Daiwa
Securities dealer Kenji Ishizuka said.
   Ishizuka said investors were paying careful attention to company
earnings and exchange rate fluctuations.
   The foreign exchange market was comparatively calm, said Toshiaki
Kakimoto, a dealer at Sumitomo Bank.
   ``Dealers are holding back after last week's extreme jumps in the
yen-dollar rate,'' he said.
   Kakimoto predicted that the dollar would stay in the 140-yen
range for the next month.
   There are no incentives to purchase dollars at more than 150 yen,
Kakimoto said.
   Moreover, concerted efforts by financial authorities to keep the
dollar under 150 yen have persuaded dealers around the world that
the dollar ought to stay in the 140-yen range, he said.

   Stock prices moved higher Monday as a more positive
tone in the market resulted in an upward drift.
   However, trading volume remained at recent light levels as many
players stayed on the sidelines awaiting a clearer direction for the
market this week. The next indicator will be Tuesday's British money
supply figures for May.
   Dealers said there were no substantive factors which contributed
to the higher prices, but said the combination of guardedly bullish
weekend press reports for equities, a firmer British currency and
news from the Confederation of British Industry that high interest
rates are beginning to dampen demand in the economy all helped
sentiment.
   At midday, the Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index was
up 10.5 points, at 2,154.4, its best level for the day.
   Volume was a light 214 million shares, compared with 273.2
million shares at the same time Friday.

   The market held steady on Friday amid a barrage of trading by
traders completing computer-program strategies involving a group of
expiring stock index options and futures.
   Analysts noted that these quarterly witching hours are often
followed by at least a brief letdown in stock prices and trading
activity.
   In addition, brokers cited lingering uncertainty over the next

<HEAD>Corn, Soybean Futures Soar On Dry Weather</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Corn and soybean futures prices were sharply
higher in early trading today on the Chicago Board of Trade, buoyed
by a mostly dry weekend in the Corn Belt and forecasts for at least
a week of hot weather.
   The change from cool, rainy weather to warmer, drier conditions
is reigniting drought fears in the Midwest, which has not fully
recovered from last year's devastating drought.
   ``People are hypersensitive after last year, so that's what's got
them going this morning,'' said Victor Lespinasse, a trader with
Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. in Chicago.
   The corn market is getting additional support from the
Agriculture Department's decision to extend the due date on loans
covering 700 million bushels of corn, keeping at least some of that
grain off the market for another six months.
   Gains in the wheat market were limited by selling linked to the
advancing winter wheat harvest.
   In early trading, wheat was 2 cents to 3{ cents higher with the
contract for delivery in July at $3.97} a bushel; corn was 2} cents
to 9 cents higher with July at $2.71{ a bushel; oats were 5 cents to
6 cents higher with July at $1.70{ a bushel; soybeans were 12 cents
to 16{ cents higher with July at $7.45 a bushel.
   Livestock and meat futures were sharply higher in early trading
on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, boosted by a monthly USDA report
issued Friday that showed far fewer cattle were placed on feedlots
in May than traders had expected.
   Live cattle were .55 cent to 1.45 cents higher with June at 72.62
cents a pound; feeder cattle were .50 cent to .88 cent higher with
August at 81.85 cents a pound; live hogs were .15 cent to .90 cent
higher with June at 48.65 cents a pound; frozen pork bellies were
.38 cent to 1.07 cents higher with July at 34.30 cents a pound.
   Cattle futures settled mixed on Friday while pork futures were
mostly higher.

   The economic story of the coming decade will be
written in three words: brains over brawn.
   In the 1990s and beyond, know-how and inventiveness will emerge
as the kn every field, from selling hamburgers to
fighting wars to forging steel.
   The emergence of a knowledge-based world economy will create neweys
to success i
winners. But it also will create new losers: people, companies and
countries that can't find a place in a world moving beneath their
feet.
   Associated Press writers from around the country found that the
dawning knowledge economy is remaking societies and shifting the
balance of global power. Those who exploit the trend are riding it
to success. Those who do not are getting run over.
   ``What we've had is a change in rewards for different kinds of
skills. You could think of it as brain power vs. muscle power, or
paper-and-pencil skills vs. other skills,'' says Harvard economist
Richard B. Freeman.
   Knowledge is not only power, it is money, and the erosion of
American living standards directly reflects how led democracy
movement, to the surge in lawsuits over copyrights, to congressional
opposition to the FSX fighter deal with Japan.
   All around the world, the struggle for power is becoming a battle
of wits. In the Soviet Union, President Mikhail Gorbachev is
pressing for glasnost and perestroika out of an awareness that his
economic push will fail unless he can unlock the imaginations of the
Russian people.
   In Armonk, N.Y., International Business Machines Corp. is
spending $900 million a year _ slightly more than the annual budget
of Harvard University _ to educate and train employees in everything
from robotics to public speaking.
   In Miami's troubled Liberty City, Frederick Morley is trying to
prepare the predominantly black, poor students of Drew Elementary
School for a high-tech world that threatens to trap them in poverty.
   ``The way out is education, literacy and skills. I think they're
listening,'' the principal says.
   The quintessential product of the new era, software, is nothing
but a language of encoded knowledge, traveling freely between
computers. Economic visionaries say the people who can parlay their
thoughts into this language hold the key to the creativity that will
shape our future.
   ``The major `capital' of the next century is going to be minds
that produce ideas,'' Alan Greenspan, chairman of the Federal
Reserve, said in a recent speech to American and Japanese executives.
   The brains-over-brawn trend is hardly new, of course: Francis
Bacon observed in 1597 that knowledge is power. What's new is that
technology has made knowledge more mobile and infinitely more potent.
   In the past year, fiber-optic cables that carry information at
the speed of light have been laid across the Atlantic and Pacific
oceans for the first time. It's now possible for Soviet scientists
to plug directly into U.S. scientific data networks by computer.
   Literacy rates have leaped in many developing countries, allowing
them to absorb technology quickly from the big industrial economies.
   Knowledge has become the great equalizer, making it possible for
anyone, anywhere, to compete and succeed. Unlike oil, timber or
nuclear bombs, knowledge can be created and spread on a blackboard
with a stub of chalk, in Bangkok, Thailand, as easily as in Omaha,
Neb.
   In 1866, international communication was only for the elite. It
cost $100 to send a 20-word cable from New York to London on the
first undersea cable. Today it costs $1 to send about 4,000 words
over the same route using an ordinary personal computer and modem.
   Japan's rise to power from a string of rocky islands is the best
evidence that a nation does not need amber waves of grain to make it
in the age of the knowledge economy.
   Conversely, Alaskans have discovered since the Exxon Valdez spill
the frailty of an economy built on natural resources, largely oil,
fish and wilderness beauty.
   The knowledge economy poses challenges at all levels of society _
for governments, businesses and individuals. For the U.S.
government, it is a question of focusing on the big picture,
long-range strategists say.
   To some people, that means industrial planning and initiatives
such as Sematech, the government-industry program in Austin, Texas,
to restore competitiveness in computer chip manufacturing.
   People like Kathryn Harrigan, a professor at Columbia University,
say preserving American expertise should be a central objective of
U.S. trade policy.
   Let foreigners buy as many high-tech U.S. companies as they want,
so long as Americans are guaranteed the intellectually demanding
jobs, she says. In a war, she says, the U.S. government always could
nationalize the companies.

   For state and local governments, education and aid to worker
training are probably the biggest contributions they can make to
their citizens' ability to cope.
   West Germany's Mederer Corp., for example, makes Trolli Gummi
candies in Iowa under a state program that reimburses a company up
to 50 percent of a new worker's salary and benefits for on-the-job
training.
   ``It was a major factor in locating the plant,'' manager Gary
Buck says.
   In the private sector, meanwhile, a new kind of democracy is
emerging: a belief in lifelong self-improvement and a commitment to
the principle that anyone can have a good idea.
   A potentially harmful counter-trend also is bubbling up, however.
In the name of efficiency and uniformity, some companies are
``de-skilling'' the jobs of fast-food laborers, reservation clerks
and even bankers and social workers, removing their flexibility with
rules concocted by centralized experts.
   Yankee ingenuity is still admired around the globe. But the
de-skilling movement is expanding too, fed by the management search
to exert control and avoid the vulnerability of relying on
ill-educated workers.
   ``Extraordinary human ingenuity has been used to eliminate the
need for human ingenuity,'' author Barbara Garson writes in a 1988
book, ``The Electronic Sweatshop.''
   ``We call it cloning your best man,'' says George Keller,
executive vice president of AFSM International, an association of
high-tech field service workers.
   Keller says he likes the new systems, which allow generalists to
do specialized repairs by following rules stored in a laptop
computer. But he also worries people could become overly dependent
on them.
   ``People like to use crutches sometimes,'' he said.
   There is no reason the knowledge economy must lead to drudgery.
In fact, the assembly-line mentality catching on in some offices is
disappearing in the factories, where it began.
   Respect for people's ideas at L-S Electrogalvanizing Co. in
Cleveland, for example, has led to a dramatic surge in pride among
the company's workers, who make sheet steel for auto bodies.
   Wes Humphrey, vice president of United Steelworkers Local 9126 at
the plant, says the esprit de corps there is so strong that ``now we
wrap coils like it's Christmastime.''
   Many managers recognize this lesson. ``If we don't work with our
employees to make them happier and get more work out of them, we're
all doomed,'' says David Hoag, president of LTV Steel Co., one of
L-S's corporate parents, which got religion during its Chapter 11
bankruptcy proceedings.
   For companies that reject the de-skilling approach to survival,
the alternative is shouldering more of the burden of education. That
will pinch smaller businesses that can't spare 18,000 people at a
time, the number of IBMers who receive education or training on a
typical day.
   By the year 2000, 65 percent of all jobs will require some
training or education beyond high school, compared with 54 percent
now, according to a study by the American Society for Training and
Development.
   Many companies complain that their training will go to waste
because newly trained workers will jump to jobs elsewhere. That is
indeed a problem, since good training is so spotty. Still, training
pays.
   In a study for the National Academy of Engineering, Charles W.
Hoover of New York's Polytechnic University concluded that education
outlays for engineers are among the best investments, even in the
short term.
   For workers, or those hoping to find jobs, the keys are lifelong
education and flexibility.
   ``Increasingly, we're in a more complex economy and that is
making for more complex and more demanding jobs,'' says Samuel
Ehrenhalt, regional commissioner for the U.S. Bureau of Labor
Statistics.
   Unfortunately for those who want to adapt, it's getting tougher.
American society is splintering into a small segment of overworked
technology wizards, a great mass of people who know just enough to
get by, and another small but growing segment mired in permanent
poverty: the underclass.
   Fourteen percent of American adults cannot locate the United
States on a map. About one in five believes the sun revolves around
the Earth. Most young adults cannot decipher a bus schedule, a
Department of Education survey found.
   While American educators struggle to cultivate the seeds of
modern knowledge in this country, foreign literacy is flourishing.
   Japanese automakers that opened U.S. plants found they had to
hire college graduates to fill assembly jobs that would have been
filled by high school graduates in Japan.
   Americans still win a disproportionate share of Nobel Prizes in
science, but by most other measures the top of the knowledge pyramid
is eroding as badly as the base.
   Last year, eight of the top 10 winners of U.S. patents were
foreign companies. Half the assistant professors of engineering at
U.S. graduate schools are foreign.
   As the U.S. economy becomes more closely tied to the global one,
the winners will be those people whose services, for whatever
reason, are in world demand. That includes movie stars, athletes,
lawyers, and specialists like Michael Milken, the junk bond king.
   Losers are those whose jobs can be done abroad. Data-entry jobs
are moving to far-flung locales from Northern Ireland to China. Some
credit card and insurance companies have their billing statements
done in the Caribbean. Boeing Co. has had programming done in the
Philippines.
   Norman Bodek, executive director of the Data Entry Management
Association of Stamford, Conn., was prophetic when he proclaimed
three years ago that eventually, ``An office in India will be no
different than next door.''
   Perhaps the biggest direct threat to ordinary Americans is that
the knowledge economy could permanently split the population and
undermine any reason for the winners to help the losers. The
alienation and political consequences of that gulf are profound.
   ``As our economic fates diverge,'' Harvard professor Robert Reich
wrote recently, ``the top fifth may be losing the sense of
connectedness with the bottom fifth, or even the bottom half, that
would elicit such generosity.''

   Crack addicts who used to spill their life
stories to Jesus Frias in a basement office of a Brooklyn hospital
are now telling them to a computer instead.
   The traditional intake interview, through which the drug
counselor gained insight into a new patient, has been replaced by a
multiple-choice questionnaire that the patient fills out alone.
   A computer program converts the patient's answers to the 132
questions into a ``narrative,'' a formulaic two-page biography.
   Frias, 34, said he understands why computers have taken over the
initial interviews _ for one thing, they give counselors more time
for other meetings with patients _ but he said something is lost
without that first face-to-face contact.
   ``When you ask the question, is your father or mother alive, and
they say yes, even that yes tells you a lot. You can say, `You don't
sound too happy your father's alive.'''
   The automation of some phases of addiction counseling is part of
a streamlining and simplification of jobs everywhere, made possible
by technology and sophisticated management techniques. Critics call
it ``dumbing down.''
   Wisecracking short-order cooks are disappearing from the American
scene, replaced by drones who answer to french fry computers.
Electronic monitoring is squeezing out the folksy airline
reservation clerks who tell callers that Vancouver is nice this time
of year.
   Even stockbrokers, those cowboys of finance, are getting lassoed.
Some big firms now decide centrally how and where clients should
invest their money, reducing brokers to happy-talking functionaries.
   Office automation is ``rising almost floor by floor to engulf
higher and higher strata of white-collar workers,'' Barbara Garson
wrote in a 1988 book, ``The Electronic Sweatshop.''
   Turning human work over to computers is not an inescapable part
of the emerging knowledge economy. Many companies are moving in the
other direction, trying to gain a competitive edge by encouraging
employees to think independently.
   But there are powerful social forces behind human automation,
including a shortage of skilled workers and management's innate
desire for greater control.
   Counselors and administrators at the Poly Drug Clinic of Kings
County Addictive Hospital say the computerization of intake
interviews has brought greater efficiency and uniformity.
   The questionnaire developed by Auto Assess Inc. asks, for
example, how much patients spend daily for drugs and what they do in
their spare time.
   Another company's Psychological Screening Inventory requires
patients to answer true or false to statements such as ``I enjoy
classical music,'' ``Strange voices have spoken to me,'' and
``Shooting is a good sport.''
   Computers translate the answers into neat statements containing
sentences such as, ``Client feels she is a normal drinker.''
Counselors are supposed to plug holes with a personal interview.
   When interviews were done in person, the writeups tended to be
messy and incomplete, especially when done by the less-educated
counselors hired at a time when it was in vogue to use former
addicts in rehabilitation. They also took two hours or more to do
right.
   ``It's a finite instrument like all, but the purpose is to save
us time for the counselor,'' said the clinic director, Jerry
Halloran.
   ``The downside of it would be a counselor getting this back and
filing it away and never looking at it,'' he said.
   Crack, the highly addictive, smokable form of cocaine, is
ravaging poor neighborhoods of Brooklyn. The success rate for
treatment is low, especially in an outpatient clinic like the Poly
Drug Clinic. Knowing a patient well can help a counselor head off
predictable trouble, Frias said.
   The computerized reports are sometimes adequate, sometimes not,
Frias said. He fears they could be a temptation to laziness. And by
saving counselors' time, they give budgeters a rationale for not
adding more counselors to cope with an increased load of crack
addicts.
   ``You're removing the need for skilled people. Now you just need
people to file,'' Frias said.
   Overall, Frias concludes the computerization is probably good. In
any case, he said, ``Once it's introduced, and people notice it's
convenient, nobody wants to do more work. You're not going to go
back to the old way.''

   A 19th-century factory that once produced
linseed oil is pumping out ideas today as the home of a new kind of
company, a product consulting firm.
   Style counts at companies such as Innovation &amp; Development Inc.,
which help other companies turn technology into dollars by making
products easier to use and nicer to look at.
   The 14 employees of Innovation &amp; Development work in a zone by
the Hudson River that once pulsed with basic industry. Next door are
empty lots dotted with dead smokestacks as well as new development,
signs of a moribund tract taking on a second life.
   Inside, the mood is relaxed and the decor high-tech. Employees
have the tieless, hip look of younger Madison Avenue advertising
types.
   The testing section is strewn with a bag of golf clubs, a
treadmill, half-dismantled dishwashers, refrigerators and a sink. A
shelf is covered with dozens of shampoo bottles.
   The atmosphere of Innovations &amp; Development reflects the change
in the balance of power from gritty industry to the knowledge
economy, in which know-how and creativity are paramount.
   When Baxter Healthcare Corp. invented a better way to administer
fluids to hospital patients, it turned to Innovations &amp; Development
to help make it a product.
   The firm's designers visited hospitals, did market research,
spoke to nurses, drew sketches and made foam-board models.
   Eventually, they helped Baxter design a device for delivering up
to 10 fluids to a patient through two lines, replacing the tangle of
tubes seen in critical-care wards.
   ``Really, what we did was simplify the plumbing,'' said vice
president Victor A. Siegel.
   Rarely is the know-how of product consultants put into a
completely new widget. Clients don't want that.
   ``In most cases, they're under time pressure, and they're not
interested in a whole lot of pain,'' said Don Gamache, chief
executive of Innotech Corp. of Trumbull, Conn., another firm in the
field.
   There are are nearly 6,750 industrial designers in the United
States, and more than half work independently, the Industrial
Designers Society of America says.
   In 10 years, the society's membership has more than doubled to
2,200 members.
   In an age of ``product parity,'' where soap is soap and there are
a profusion of soaps, Innovation's Siegel says the best way to
identify a new brand in the consumer's mind is to put it in a new
container.
   Syntectics Inc. of Cambridge, Mass., takes a different approach.
An independent outgrowth of consulting giant Arthur D. Little, it
works with company marketers and researchers to create ``an
environment receptive to innovation,'' said senior associate
Josephine Fuller.
   At one problem-solving meeting, Gillette Co. officials pretended
to be strands of hair, and were asked how they felt, Ms. Fuller
said. The role-play was part of a marketing strategy for Silkience
conditioning shampoo.
   At a brainstorming session to come up with vandal-resistant pay
phones for New York Telephone Co., participants thought of
indestructible things in nature. Mount Rushmore inspired phones
built into the sides of buildings.

   Robert Noyce watched the technology he
helped create slip across the Pacific and is fighting to rekindle
America's brainpower in the war for economic survival.
   Noyce, 61, has come to Texas' capital from Silicon Valley, where
he co-invented the integrated circuit and helped found Intel Corp.,
a giant of the U.S. chip industry.
   Last year, Noyce became the first chief executive of Sematech, a
joint industry-government effort to reclaim U.S. dominance in the
$45 billion semiconductor industry by 1993.
   Noyce's rallying cry is national security, both militarily and
economically.
   In the last 10 years, Japan has almost taken over the
semiconductor business. U.S. market share fell from about 55 percent
to 40 percent from 1984 to 1987, the Commerce Department estimates.
   Chips are the base of the food chain of electronics, the core
elements in everything from supercomputers to coffee makers.
   The idea behind Sematech is to bring together the best brains in
the United States _ whether they work for National Semiconductor
Corp. or Intel, for International Business Machines Corp. or
American Telephone &amp; Telegraph Co. _ to figure out the best,
fastest, cheapest way to make computer chips.
   ``I fundamentally believe that even if Sematech is a failure, it
will still be a success if we continue to push that sort of
program,'' says G. Dan Hutcheson, president of VLSI Research Inc., a
market research company in San Jose, Calif.
   ``Already you see signs, in terms of some of the product
development,'' Hutcheson said. ``Problems are being solved. There's
enormous improvement in yields.
   ``Since Sematech was started, engineers have started calling each
other and talking,'' he said.
   It is this free-flowing exchange of information, so crucial to
learning and science, that Sematech and other consortia are trying
to encourage.
   The obstacle, however, is historical American reluctance to share
knowledge with a competitor for fear that he'll beat you at your own
game.
   There are detractors. Xerox Corp. Chairman David Kearns said his
company had declined to participate because it did not believe the
level of investment justified the possible return.
   ``I applaud the idea of getting together,'' Kearns said, but he
suggested that smaller, two-company combinations would be more
useful because the results could be more easily tailored to the
participants' needs.
   In addition, a Commerce Department study said the U.S. computer
chip industry will remain faced with trade, tax and antitrust issues
regardless of Sematech's performance.
   Although the report recommends Congress spend $100 million on
Sematech next year, it cautions that such cooperative efforts should
be ``treated with care.''
   Electronics is the nation's largest manufacturing employer, with
more than 2.5 million people, largely in California, Massachusetts,
Minnesota, New York and Texas, the American Electronics Association
says.
   Although companies in Europe have teamed up to form consortiums
like Sematech, it is Japan that has taken the lead and where experts
look for guidance.
   Japan is a ``beautiful example'' of a knowledge-based economy,
says Noyce.
   Sematech, an acronym for Semiconductor Manufacturing Technology,
is a consortium of 14 semiconductor makers and users and the U.S.
government that was created in 1987 to find ways to make
semiconductors faster and better than anyone else.
   Already Sematech has built a ``wafer fabrication'' unit and
manufactured its first silicon wafer. The ``wafer fab,'' built in 32
weeks and producing three days ahead of schedule, is itself a major
accomplishment, Noyce said.
   U.S. companies produced about 85 percent of all silicon wafers in
1984 but just over 20 percent in 1987, Commerce Department figures
show. Sematech's aim is to reverse that trend.
   Across town from Sematech is another consortium, Microelectronics
and Computer Corp., where similar work is done on a broader range of
computer research. Eight companies, including Motorola Inc., Digital
Equipment Corp., NCR Corp., Hewlett-Packard Co. and National
Semiconductor, are members of both consortia.
   Experts claim the United States has lost its edge because of too
much attention to immediate profits at the expense of research and
investment.
   ``Up until the last 15 years ... America was riding high, clearly
the highest standard of living in the world,'' Noyce said.
   Noyce notes that the Japanese success was based on cooperation
among competitors, an anathema in American business that Sematech
hopes to change.
   ``We have to overcome our own idea that we're the superior
race,'' said Hutcheson. ``There are other people out there that are
working harder than we are. They're intelligent, they're innovative,
they're doing everything that we did but somehow forgot.''

<HEAD>Some Educators See Hope in Crime-Ridden Miami Neighborhoods</HEAD>

   By midmorning it was business as usual in Miami's
Liberty City district.
   A kid on a fancy bicycle ferried crack cocaine past a housing
project where the bullet-riddled body of a 34-year-old mother was
discovered before dawn. A squad car screamed by, blue lights
pulsing. The owner of a furniture store looted in last January's
riots waited at the door for customers. He was armed.
   Inside a small cement-block building set apart from the Drew
Elementary School, students in blue and white uniforms were told
their future is not necessarily foreshadowed by events on the other
side of the chain-link fence.
   ``We let them know there are alternatives to drugs, to poverty,
to crime,'' said Drew Principal Frederick Morley. ``The way out is
education, literacy and skills. I think they're listening.''
   The success of educators like Morley is vital not only to the
people of Liberty City but to the nation as a whole.
   As labor shortages arise, companies are hiring people from
disadvantaged backgrounds out of necessity, not philanthropy. At the
same time, the knowledge-based economy demands more sophisticated
skills than ever.
   Morley and others concede programs such as Drew's career-training
laboratory are pitted against a Goliath. Years of disillusionment
and frustration rule the city's predominantly black inner-city
neighborhoods.
   Nearly 300,000 Latin American refugees have entered Miami this
decade, and American-born blacks complain that the immigrants are
receiving preferential treatment. The resentment was a catalyst in a
three-day riot earlier this year in Liberty City, the third major
urban upheaval in Miami this decade.
   ``We feel like the Indians out west. We were here first and the
newcomers are squeezing us out,'' said Tyrone Greene, 31.
   Morley is focusing on the positive. In his school, ideals of
success and perseverance are drilled into the 600 first- to
sixth-grade students _ about a third of whom attend voluntary
Saturday classes begun this year.
   An 18-year-old career-planning lab at the school is a model for
similar programs nationwide.
   Each day, participating students punch simulated time cards and
head to an appointed task. At one end of the room, children tap out
letters on electric typewriters while others as young as 7 work on
personal computers. On the other side, boys and girls learn to set
hair and apply cosmetics.
   A real estate agent instructs children on property marketing as
others nearby study the rudiments of electronics or repairing an
airplane wing.
   They call each other ``Mr.'' and ``Mrs.''
   ``We get them young enough so they aren't already locked into a
self-defeating life of drugs or crime,'' said Morley, whose school
has received national awards and hosted Vice President Dan Quayle in
February.
   ``When they leave this school, they are surrounded by all sorts
of negative influences. We don't want their role models to be pimps
and dealers.''
   While Morley shepherds children, Miami's black adults are
learning business skills from Philip Mann, whose round, white face
and shaggy mustache seems more suited to an Irish pub than a ghetto
streetcorner.
   ``I'm just trying to provide the tools _ the education _ to move
in the right direction,'' said Mann, a University of Miami professor
who founded the Entrepreneurial Institute in response to Liberty
City riots in 1982.
   The $15, five-week courses include accounting, international
business and business computer software. About two-thirds of the
2,500 students who have taken them since 1983 are black.
   ``There's an amazing resilience in the human species. The body
and mind only lets you go so far into destitution, then the sense of
survival takes over,'' Mann said. ``That's what we're hoping to tap
into _ that sense that the black community will claw back against
the odds.''
   Education alone will not get blacks into the economic mainstream
in Miami. Among other things, they face discrimination from white
and Hispanic businesses and a deterioration of the social fabric in
black communities.
   ``Listen, I'll hire any one, but it seems the ones who can _ and
want _ to work are the Haitians and the Latins,'' said Charles
Genthner, president of Fire Hose Corp., which makes fire hoses in a
1-year-old Liberty City plant.
   ``There has to be the idea that getting into the work force is
the best option,'' said John Cordrey, an economist at the Beacon
Council, a tax-supported Miami area business group.
   ``In my opinion, the blacks have made the Hispanics a scapegoat.
They see them working hard and they say they are taking our jobs,''
said Thomas Boswell, a University of Miami professor studying local
immigration. ``What is really plaguing the black community here is a
breakdown in the family.''
   ``Identifying the problem is easy. Turning it around is
difficult.''

   The stock market drifted lower today in a subdued
atmosphere following Friday's ``triple witching hour.''
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials dropped 10.09 to 2,476.29
by noontime on Wall Street.
   Losers outnumbered gainers by about 3 to 2 in nationwide trading
of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 504 up, 745 down and
554 unchanged.
   The market held steady on Friday amid a barrage of trading by
traders completing computer-program strategies involving a group of
expiring stock index options and futures.
   Analysts noted that these quarterly witching hours are often
followed by at least a brief letdown in stock prices and trading
activity.
   In addition, brokers cited lingering uncertainty over the next
likely turn in the Federal Reserve's credit policy.
   The stream of economic data that Wall Streeters watch along with
the Fed runs dry for the next few days.
   NWA climbed 6~ to 114{ after a delayed opening. An investor group
led by Alfred Checchi of Los Angeles announced an agreement to
acquire NWA for $121 a share, apparently ending a bidding war among
several parties.
   Time Inc. fell 6 to 156{ and Warner Communications held steady at
59\. On Friday Time began a $70-a-share offer for Warner after
Paramount Communications disrupted plans for a Time-Warner merger
with a hostile bid for Time.
   Paramount shares lost 1 to 57[.
   Sea Containers Ltd. jumped 6] to 72. The company, which is
fighting a $50-a-share takeover bid by the European countries
Tiphook and Stena, said it was working on a plan for a buyout or
restructuring.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks
slipped .36 to 179.23. At the American Stock Exchange, the market
value index was off .11 at 361.72.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 61.74 million shares at noontime,
down from 155.33 million at the same point Friday.

<HEAD>Iowa Has a Lot Going for it, But Not All Rural Areas Can Cash In</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By STEVEN P. ROSENFELD</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WINTERSET, Iowa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A computer chip factory soon will rise
from a corn field in this community of covered bridges, the
birthplace of John Wayne.
   For Winterset, 45 minutes southwest of Des Moines, it's a chance
to exploit Iowa's reputation for a high literacy rate and a
dedicated, dependable work force.
   For areas of Iowa farther from Des Moines and its amenities, a
high-tech solution to rural poverty and depopulation is more
elusive. The Corn Belt is not making a smooth transition to the
knowledge economy.
   Small towns in Iowa and across the Midwest have found that good
schools and a literate work force _ often touted as keys to success
_ are not enough.
   Would-be employers demand access to good transportation, modern
hospitals, sophisticated cultural and recreation attractions,
shopping malls and ample outside professional help, from lawyers to
CPAs.
   Even when small towns succeed in industrial recruitment, they
don't get all the expected economic benefits.
   New professionals who move in often opt to do their major
shopping during weekend excursions to the big city, says David
Forkenbrock, director of the University of Iowa Public Policy Center.
   ``The best way to strengthen the rural economy may be to put a
barrier in the road to prevent people from going to the big city for
cheaper goods,'' Forkenbrock is fond of saying.
   Even if Iowa does everything right, it should anticipate just
modest growth in its personal income, employment and population over
the next 25 years, research consultants say.
   ``Iowa's agricultural history and its existing industry mix make
it unlikely that the state will become known as a high-tech state,''
says a draft report prepared by the SRI International Center for
Economic Competitiveness at Menlo Park, Calif.
   Still, the report says a ``tradition of quality can be the basis
for Iowa's more competitive, more diverse and balanced economy.''
   In Winterset, a community of 4,000 which stands to gain up to 600
jobs, the courtship of EAC Technologies Inc., a maker of control
panels for appliances, was a community affair.
   As the high school band played ``Happy Days Are Here Again,'' a
crowd representing everyone from the farmer in his bib overalls to
the banker in his business suit celebrated the groundbreaking.
   EAC bought the business from Motorola Inc. It is closing plants
in Taiwan and Texas to build in Iowa, where it also will locate its
headquarters and research and development center.
   Iowa's reputation for good schools and an educated work force
that can cope with technological change were strong selling points.
   Iowa has the highest college entrance exam scores among the 28
states where the American College Testing program is dominant. It
ranks fifth in the nation in high school graduation rates.
   ``We need quality out of a dedicated work force that stays with
us,'' said Tom Phillips, the president of EAC.
   Small town schools produce such students because they are forced
by economics to concentrate on the basics, while students often
suffer in the ``smorgasbord'' programs of bigger school systems,
said Dick Manatt, director of the School Improvement Model projects
at Iowa State.
   In small towns, where everyone knows everyone else, there is
strong peer pressure to succed.
   But a trainable, reliable work force would not have been enough
if Winterset weren't close to Des Moines and its shopping centers,
theaters, museums and airport, Phillips said.
   Promises of cooperation from the microprocessor research center
at Iowa State University and of tailor-made employee training from
the Des Moines Area Community College also were selling points.
   Because of such attractions, the area around Des Moines has been
promoting itself as ``the Golden Circle.'' It's one of the few
sectors of the state that grew in population from 1980 to 1987, when
a sour farm economy caused a flight from rural America.
   ``It's pretty tough for a town that's not on the beaten path at
all to make progress,'' says Thomas Pogue, an economist at the
University of Iowa.
   Shenandoah in southwest Iowa points out that residents can get on
the golf course in five minutes or to the doctor's office in three.
But that approach often is not enough, admitted Day Hacke, the
executive vice president of the Shenandoah Development Corp.
   ``If they want something beyond that, they go somewhere else.
From a competitive standpoint you're going to come up short,'' Hacke
said.
   EAC's Phillips says he had to overcome some reservations before
taking Iowa seriously. He was looking forward to building in the
gentler climate of the South and had visions of North Carolina golf
courses when the search began. He said he thought of Iowa as
``farming, flat and not high-tech.''
   The key was that EAC needed a work force that could be relied on
to grasp new techniques and to show up each day and get the job done.
   Iowa fit that bill.

   Katsura Hattori pushed a button, and the
front page of his newspaper, Asahi Shimbun, appeared on a $40,000
prototype television.
   Even the tiny Japanese script was clearly legible on the
fine-grained screen, 10 times more detailed than a normal TV.
   ``Someday,'' Hattori said, ``this may be how a lot of people read
their newspaper in the morning.''
   If so, most of the groundwork will have been done at the
Massachusetts Institute of Technology, but the first commercial
users probably will be Japanese companies. Over the past four years,
they have handed MIT millions of dollars and sent top employees like
Hattori to help with the research.
   MIT, Harvard, Texas A&amp;M and a handful of other top U.S. schools
are getting enriched by foreign grants and bolstered by foreign
researchers. But critics say the help carries a high price: Donors
are taking ideas and know-how home, draining a national resource.
   ``I don't know why we permit it,'' said Irwin Freest, an engineer
in Massapequa Park, N.Y., who has been campaigning for Congress to
send foreign engineering students packing.
   ``It hurts us, because what they do with their grants, they take
the knowledge back and sell us goods which increases our balance of
trade deficit,'' he said.
   Foreign companies and governments sponsor about $5 million of
research a year at MIT, which has the highest percentage of foreign
students of any U.S. university. One-fifth of its total student body
and one-third of its graduate students are non-U.S. citizens.
   Two miles up the Charles River at Harvard, foreign sources
provide about $11 million a year for research in economics,
agriculture, medicine and other fields. About 6 percent of Harvard's
undergraduates and 17 percent of its graduate students are
foreigners.
   Alarmed by such statistics, Freest and others are calling for a
kind of academic protectionism _ the erection of barriers to the
free flow of students and knowledge across borders.
   They are not alone; similar pressures are building in other
countries, says Dorothy Zinberg, a faculty member at Harvard's
Kennedy School of Government who is preparing a report on the
subject for the National Science Foundation.
   ``Japan and the Netherlands are today the only two countries that
are actively seeking to increase their numbers of foreign
students,'' she said. ``In the U.S., in France, a bit less so in
West Germany, people are very concerned about losing ideas.''
   Zinberg said some U.S. companies are now attaching strings to
their university grants, insisting that no foreigners be allowed to
work on the research they support. In France, she said, educators
are subtly excluding foreigners from certain schools.
   The University of Rochester's graduate business school rescinded
acceptance of an employee of Fuji Photo Film Co. Ltd. after concerns
were raised by hometown Eastman Kodak Co. It later reoffered
admission, but too late.
   Defenders of the open university see a dire threat in this. They
note that most leading universities in the United States have
policies requiring all campus research to be freely publishable and,
therefore, of at least as much benefit to American companies as to
foreign ones.
   They also say many foreign researchers and graduate students stay
in the United States, strengthening the nation's brainpower.
   Most of all, defenders argue that keeping universities open to
all, based only on academic qualifications, is part of the universal
ethic of science. Insulating ourselves, they say, will make us less
competitive, not more.
   ``It's generally seen today that American universities are among
the best in the world,'' said John Shattuck, Harvard's vice
president for public affairs. ``Our whole higher education system is
very attractive ... and its availability to foreign students is an
asset to American society, because they learn American values and
become familiar with Americans, and Americans are enriched by being
exposed to them.''
   Nationally, less than 1 percent of all university research is
paid for by foreign money. But five big research institutions _
Harvard, MIT, Texas A&amp;M, Oregon State University and the University
of Wisconsin _ together receive more than half of all that money, a
kitty estimated at about $75 million a year.
   Experts say there are about 1 million students circulating from
country to country worldwide, and the largest number, about 350,000,
are in the United States. More than half are in science and
technology, creating extraordinary imbalances, such as the fact that
foreigners now earn about 60 percent of the doctoral degrees granted
in engineering by American universities.
   Like any protectionist move, however, attempts to restrict
foreign students or research projects could be met in kind.
   ``If we're not careful,'' Zinberg said, ``we may one day find our
students shut out of foreign universities, because we have shut them
out of ours.''
   The research that foreigners are supporting on American campuses
runs the gamut from studying aircraft turbines at MIT to ocean
drilling at Texas A&amp;M and weather monitoring at the University of
Wisconsin.
   But much of the pressure to cut back the foreign presence comes
from people in a few highly competitive industries, such as
electronics and biotechnology.
   ``Of course, we'd like people to take back skills and knowledge
and apply them in their own countries, especially the Third World
and countries that aren't as fortunate as we are,'' said Frank Lord,
an engineer with GTE in San Carlos, Calif., and chairman of a
manpower committee for the Institute of Electrical and Electronic
Engineers.
   ``But taking valuable technology is another matter, and it's a
hard line to draw.''

   Now that RJR Nabisco Inc. has to pay $3 billion a
year in interest on takeover debt, skeptics are wondering whether
the research cookies will crumble at the company that makes Oreos.
   People are scrutinizing the record $25 billion leveraged buyout
of RJR Nabisco to see whether the heavy debts involved in this
trendy form of takeover will hurt companies' spending on new
technology.
   Oreos look simple enough, but getting them to screw apart the
same way every time takes advanced engineering and ovens. In the
knowledge economy, technology is built invisibly into the most
unlikely products, from Ritz Bits to Salem Slims Lights, which come
in an eye-catching, beveled box.
   Shortly before the RJR Nabisco battle, the company told
stockholders it had upped research and development spending by 19
percent. It called technology the cornerstone of future growth.
   Since the buyout led by the New York investment firm Kohlberg
Kravis Roberts &amp; Co., RJR's new management says it remains committed
to research and development but won't say what changes, if any, will
be made.
   R&amp;D is less important in RJR Nabisco's businesses than in, say,
computers or pharmaceuticals. Food and tobacco are two of the
lowest-ranking industries in terms of R&amp;D as a percentage of sales,
according to Business Week's R&amp;D Scoreboard last year.
   Still, analysts say, a stunted R&amp;D program could stop the company
from creating a successful smokeless cigarette, a fat-free frozen
dinner, or crumble-proof packaging for cookies.
   So far, there's little hard evidence to document the effect of
big buyouts on research. Contributing to the dearth of information
is that companies involved in large LBOs tend to go private, and
financial figures become scarce.
   But there is a growing perception that companies cut back on
research immediately after a leveraged buyout. If that's so,
debt-financed megadeals could have a big impact on the knowledge
economy.
   ``What's happening in LBOs is that they take on pretty extensive
debt. In the short term they have to make cuts,'' said Fred Allvine,
a professor in the College of Management at Georgia Institute of
Technology.
   ``Very often, they try to cut the fat out of personnel. Then they
look at research and development _ the benefits are hard to measure.
It's one of the intangibles they cut back because LBOs have to be
concerned with payback in the short run.''
   RJR Nabisco spokeswoman Polly Howes said research is ``continuing
to function. There are new products to develop and improvements to
make. But to speculate on what will happen is premature.''
   The company has major research centers at its Nabisco Brands
Inc., Del Monte Corp. and R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Co. divisions.
   In its 1987 annual report to shareholders, RJR Nabisco called
research and development essential to the future of the company and
said it had spent $204 million on it in 1987. No figures are
available for 1988.
   Much of RJR Nabisco's recent research and development has been in
plant modernization. It also sank about $200 million into the
development of Premier, the so-called smokeless cigarette that
bombed in test marketing last year. The company has said it will
keep working on a smokeless cigarette.
   The Brookings Institution, the National Science Foundation, the
University of California at Berkeley and the University of Chicago
are among the institutions that have conducted studies looking at
leveraged buyouts.
   ``Legitimate economists are all over the map on this,'' said
Margaret Blair, senior research analyst at Brookings in Washington.
   A NSF study said growth in corporate research and development
spending has ``all but disappeared'' in the last five years. The
increase in leveraged buyouts has been a major reason, the study
said.
   It found a 12.8 percent decline in research and development
spending in companies involved in leveraged buyouts. But Melissa
Pollock of the NSF cautioned against sweeping assumptions based on
the study, noting it looked only at eight small deals for one year,
not enough for definitive conclusions.
   A study of leveraged buyouts released earlier this year by
Kohlberg Kravis disputed the notion that research suffers. But the
study also said buyouts should not involve companies that require a
heavy research investment.

   Gideon Gartner was one of the first to
realize that decision-makers in business wanted more than reams of
undigested facts and figures _ they wanted advice from professional
thinkers.
   Gartner quit his stock picker's job at Oppenheimer &amp; Co. a decade
ago and began offering Wall Street-style insights and
recommendations to buyers and sellers of computer equipment.
   Today Gartner Group is on the leading edge of the knowledge
economy. It's considered one of the top computer-industry think
tanks in the country, with a list of 900 clients that includes 49 of
the top 50 in the Fortune 500.
   Annual revenue has been increasing 50 percent a year and is
expected to reach $62 million this year.
   ``We're in the wisdom business,'' says Gartner, an alumnus of
Massachusetts Institute of Technology and International Business
Machines Corp.
   Gartner, 54 and silver-haired, is a native Israeli who combines
courtly European manners with a preference for casual clothes.
   He spurns suits and pads around his modern headquarters
overlooking Long Island Sound in shirt sleeves, stylish slacks and
walking shoes, which he is constantly pitching to colleagues as more
comfortable than their stiff-leather dress shoes.
   Computer companies such as IBM turn to the Gartner Group's stable
of 80 well-paid analysts for insight on what their competitors are
doing.
   Major computer users like American Express Co. and Pepsico Inc.
rely on the Gartner Group for advice on which computers or software
to choose, whether to lease or buy and whether they are about to pay
too much for systems that will soon be obsolete or are about to fall
in price.
   ``We haven't bought any turkeys that I am aware of since we
started using their services,'' said William P. Dean, director of
technological management services at Pepsico.
   Before Gartner came along, computer-industry watchers like
International Data Corp. pretty much restricted themselves to
publishing encyclopedic reports that didn't provide the distilled,
bottom-line advice that top executives needed to make decisions,
said Portia Isaacson Wright of Colorado-based Future Think Inc., who
follows the business information publishing industry.
   The Gartner Group now controls an estimated 60 percent of that
high-priced market, Gideon Gartner says.
   Gartner had the perfect background to turn the $500
million-a-year business of information publishing upside down,
Wright said.
   He spent seven years at IBM, where he designed systems to measure
how Big Blue was faring against competitors, before landing on Wall
Street, where Institutional Investor magazine rated him the top
individual securities analyst in the technology field between 1972
and 1978.
   An opera buff, Gartner abandoned a career as a French horn player
because it was too much of what he called a ``lost-soul career'' to
suit his engineer-father.
   Gartner discovered at MIT that he didn't really want to be an
engineer, so he stayed on to get his master's degree in business
from MIT's Sloan School of Management.
   ``He really is an extraordinary analyst in just about every
sense,'' Wright said. ``He's highly intuitive, in addition to being
real numbers-oriented.''
   One former colleague tells of the time he and three other Gartner
analysts, using company data bases, spent most of the night
calculating the full impact of a recent IBM price cut. They
discovered the next day that Gartner had arrived at nearly the same
figures by himself, doodling on a yellow legal pad on a flight back
from Europe.
   ``Gideon has more good ideas in 15 minutes than most people have
in 15 years,'' said Thomas J. Crotty, Gartner's first employee, now
retired. ``He's always got a new, ingenious thought. Gideon's
biggest problem is that he is not an implementer.''
   Clients pay up to several hundred thousand dollars a year for the
right to attend the Gartner Group's annual conferences, pick its
analysts' brains and peruse any of the 13 analytical bulletins the
company puts out.
   The analysts, most of them industry veterans, cull information
from computer users and sellers and boil it into incisive
assessments during the freewheeling, sometimes heated weekly
meetings.
   Gartner Group was acquired by Saatchi &amp; Saatchi of Great Britain,
the world's largest advertising agency, for $90 million last year.
   Gartner agreed to stay on as chairman through 1991, and as a
part-time consultant another four years beyond that. His plans are
uncertain.
   ``I could become an analyst again ... I do that pretty well,'' he
said.

<HEAD>Shipbuilders Want a Piece of the Knowledge Economy Action</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By HILARY APPELMAN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>NEWPORT NEWS, Va. (AP) </DATELINE>

   Muscular workers welding the hulls of
mammoth ships used to symbolize American business might. No more.
   Only a handful of U.S. shipbuilders are left, and they are kept
afloat by Navy contracts. The rest have fallen victim to low-wage
competitors in South Korea, Taiwan and Brazil and high-tech,
subsidized shipyards in Japan and West Germany.
   In a knowledge-based economy, the United States may get a second
chance to compete for commercial shipbuilding contracts, at least at
the high-tech end of the industry, where American companies can tap
experience gained from building state-of-the-art warships.
   ``It's pretty difficult to compete with Taiwan if all you're
doing is welding steel,'' said Tom Balfour, marketing vice president
for Newport News Shipbuilding and Dry Dock Co., the United States'
largest shipyard. ``We'd be strongest on those ships that require a
greater degree of engineering.''
   There is little unskilled work left in building ships for the
Navy, and shipyard workers are constantly retrained to keep up with
changing techniques and new equipment.
   ``The U.S. is building the most sophisticated warships in the
world,'' says Mitch Steller, a maritime consultant in San Diego.
That fact, he said, ``could be an advantage for sophisticated
commercial ships as well.''
   There are limits to the power of knowledge, though. Shipbuilders
say they also need dollars, in the form of government subsidies to
match those received by shipbuilders in Japan and West Germany.
   The Japanese and West Germans supply their shipbuilders with
millions of dollars in low-cost loans, research and development
funding and tax benefits, says the Shipbuilders Council of America
in Washington.
   Ten years ago, the U.S. shipbuilding industry was the fifth
largest, with about 10 percent of the international market. But when
the Reagan administration cut subsidies in 1981, shipbuilding
declined rapidly.
   Today, no commercial ships are built in the United States. In the
years since 1981, 41 shipyards have closed and others are foundering.
   Survivors are the brawn of the business, large Navy contractors
able to afford major investments in equipment and technology. But
even those companies are concerned about the impact of expected cuts
in Navy contracts.
   A recent study by the Commission on Merchant Marine and Defense
in Washington concluded ``there is clear and growing danger to the
national security in the deterioration of America's maritime
industries.''
   ``There's not a maritime country in the world that doesn't
subsidize its shipbuilding,'' Balfour said. ``In a world with no
subsidies, we could compete.''
   The commission calls for government to jump-start the
shipbuilding industry by financing the design and construction of
commercial ships that are also militarily useful and providing
matching funds for capital improvements of shipyards.
   The plan would cost about $13 billion in the next 11 years, but
would add 244 merchant ships to the nation's fleets, create nearly
100,000 jobs, contribute more than $43 billion to the gross national
product and raise $6 billion in federal taxes, the commission
contends.
   The net cost would be less than $6 billion, the commission said
in a report to President Bush, adding that ``the possible costs of
failing to provide adequate sealift would be much greater.''
   Proponents say that without a commercial shipbuilding industry,
the United States does not have enough ships to carry supplies and
troops in wartime.
   They say if the number of shipyards continues to decline, there
will not be a large enough base of facilities, suppliers and trained
workers to meet the country's military shipbuilding needs.
   Edward Hudgins, director of the conservative Heritage
Foundation's Center for International Growth in Washington, disputes
the need to support a domestic shipbuilding industry.
   ``I just don't see why we would need it if we can buy it
somewhere else more cheaply,'' Hudgins said. ``What we're going to
do is destroy our economy and make ourselves less capable of
defending ourselves.''
   ``This whole idea that defense means being self-sufficient in
everything is an absolutely ruinous policy,'' he said. ``These
companies are not looking out for our security, they're looking out
for themselves.''

   When Bill Daugherty worked as a motor inspector
for Republic Steel Corp., he didn't go out of his way to stay near
the bosses.
   ``You really tried to avoid them,'' he said. ``Somebody told you
to do this. You did it in five minutes, then you went and sat down
until somebody told you to do something else.''
   Even though he worked on equipment, Daugherty was forbidden to
install electrical tubing. That was reserved for another craft.
   What was standard operating procedure for a United Steelworkers
member in the early 1980s is now history for those, like Daugherty,
out on the cutting edge of labor-management relations.
   In the emerging knowledge economy, people like Daugherty are
valued as much for their grasp of the big picture as for their grip
on a Phillips screwdriver.
   The 37-year-old L-S Electrogalvanizing Co. employee roams the
plant now repairing anything electrical. He is encouraged to learn
other crafts. The company pays his tuition for technical courses,
and as his skills improve, so does his pay.
   Daugherty can make a dollar per hour above the average industry
wage to around $13 per hour, or around $27,000 per year. Production
bonuses and overtime can push the annual figure to around $40,000.
   Nobody hides from the bosses anymore. Workers step forward with
ideas to improve operations at the sheet steel coating plant, a
60-40 joint venture of LTV Corp. and Sumitomo Metal Industries of
Japan. In fact, employees are paid to meet regularly with their
managers.
   ``If we don't work with our employees to make them happier and
get more work out of them, we're all doomed,'' said LTV Steel Co.
President David Hoag. ``How can you talk about international
competitiveness when people hate their jobs?''
   Companies such as L-S Electrogalvanizing are actually ahead of
the vaunted Japanese in labor relations, Hoag argues.
   Japanese steel companies haven't advanced beyond the quality
circle, an early form of participative management that employees
here dismiss as a glorified suggestion box.
   Sumitomo officials had to be coaxed to accept the partnership
program, Hoag said.
   ``The Japanese are more autocratic than the Americans ever were.
They have a lot of ways of eliciting suggestions, but ... in the end
the talk doesn't mean a thing,'' he said.
   The 65 employees of L-S Electrogalvanizing, who produce top-grade
galvanized sheet for auto body panels, are pioneers in a 4-year-old
venture in industrial democracy. Dawn is breaking on a realm long
shaded by arrogance, mistrust and retribution.
   ``Everybody knows what's going on. Everybody pulls together,''
said John Gresh, 30, who joined the company two years ago.
   Where the United States once monopolized the world's steelmaking
know-how, just about anybody can make steel these days, and just
about everybody is.
   What's harder to come by is smart steel, the kind L-S
Electrogalvanizing produces. It's made on computer-controlled mills
in less time by fewer people. It's freer of defects, more precise in
composition and monotonously true in its dimensions.
   Smart steel is shaping up as the American steel industry's ticket
into the 21st century. U.S. producers are getting smart with better
technology _ new furnaces, continuous casters and rolling mills that
represent the best thinking in metallurgy.
   With innovations as simple as changing the way workers and bosses
talk to one another, companies are tapping a long-sealed repository
of profitable information, the rank-and-file employee.
   At L-S Electrogalvanizing, a lone process coordinator is often
the only manager on hand, and that person helps the 12 others on
duty to operate the highly automated line.
   Parking spaces are first-come, first-served. Locker rooms are
segregated only by sex. There is one dining room, no time clock and
everyone has a key to the tool room.
   ``It's like being among your friends at school. Not one of us
minds doing clean-up because we pride ourselves on our mill,'' Gresh
said.
   Management handed the workers a study estimating the price of a
chemical engineering project at $90,000, and the workers did it for
$5,000, said operations manager Mike Mueller. ``Our people just
recognize a problem and take it on.''
   Joint union-management committees can change anything except the
financial terms of the ontract, including training requirements for
new workers and production goals, which bear on bonuses.
   Although decisions are made by consensus, there has never been an
impasse.
   Work rules are few and simple: ``Be there. Be there on time, and
do what you have to do'' to complete your assignment, said Mueller.
   ``Now we wrap coils like it's Christmastime,'' said Wes Humphrey,
the vice president of Steelworkers Local 9126.
   Overall, the workers so respect management that union officials
proposed that the union's superior production bonus plan be extended
to cover process coordinators, the equivalent of front-line foremen.
   ``They work just like us. They eat dirt with us. They should get
the gravy with us,'' Humphrey said.
   Participative management emerged in the 1980 contract talks and
its popularity grew as the industry lost $12 billion from 1982 to
1986 amid plant closings and the elimintion of more than 100,000
jobs.
   LTV Corp. remains under court protection from creditors under
Chapter 11 of the federal bankruptcy code.
   ``I've seen so much heartache and suffering. It was too
disheartening to just look at and not try to do something about
it,'' said Frank Valenta, a union director.

   The two biggest steelmakers in bankruptcy court
are the two that have done the most to involve employees in managing
plants, says a United Steelworkers official overseeing programs to
improve life in the mills.
   USW International Secretary Edgar Ball gives the top marks to LTV
Steel Co. and Wheeling-Pittsburgh Steel Corp., both reorganizing
under Chapter 11 of the bankruptcy laws.
   He recognized LTV for supporting labor management participation
teams, which give employees new authority to solve production and
personnel problems.
   ``LTV just worked all out to make that system work and expand
it,'' Ball said in an interview.
   LTV's joint venture in Cleveland with Sumitomo of Japan, L-S
Electrogalvanizing Co., has an even more progressive arrangement in
which workers are largely unsupervised.
   Their freedom, responsibility and authority is unmatched among
major steelmakers and is among the most progressive anywhere, Ball
said.
   He praised Wheeling-Pittsburgh for its modified system of
labor-management teams.
   A mini-board of directors, staffed equally from management and
the union, oversees operations at the plant and department levels.
On the shop floor, task forces do anything from correct malfunctions
to reorganize production.
   Other steel companies have not come as far, Ball said.
   Armco Inc.'s program was rejected by plant and division managers,
he said.
   National Steel Corp. has a partnership program on paper, but it
encountered resistance at the plant level, he said.
   Bethlehem Steel Corp. and USX Corp. have plant-level programs,
some highly successful, but none at the corporate level, and the two
linger near the back of the pack, he said.
   USS-POSCO Industries Inc., the USX joint venture with Pohang of
South Korea, has labor-management participation teams at its
Pittsburg, Calif., plant, but nothing approaching the LTV-Sumitomo
joint venture, said Robert Guadiana, a USW district director for
California.
   Inland and Nippon of Japan are duplicating the LTV-Sumitomo
partnership at a joint venture under construction at New Carlisle,
Ind., 50 miles east of Gary.
   J&amp;L Specialty Products Corp., a stainless and alloy steelmaker
spun off from LTV, is out front in the specialty steel industry,
Ball said.
   A USW local at the company's Detroit plant, despite internal
union criticism for cooperating with management, has boosted
productivity through ad hoc teams. The company is rewarding workers
with profit-sharing payments that boost annual pay to around
$50,000, Ball said.
   Outside steel, Rockwell International Corp. began a cooperative
program with the USW at its New Castle, Pa., axle plant after
announcing plans to close the facility in 1982 and moving one of its
departments to South Carolina.
   ``It worked so well they not only did not shut the plant, but
brought back the department from South Carolina,'' Ball said.
   Aluminum Co. of America negotiated a participative management
program for a Texas plant in 1977, the first such arrangement
involving the USW, Ball said.
   Other programs have been started by Xerox Corp. and the
Amalgamated Clothing and Textile Workers at a Rochester, N.Y.,
plant, and by Goodyear Tire Co. at a non-union plant in Lawton, Okla.
   Wheeling-Pitt is enjoying harmony in place of bitter relations
under its traditional system.
   ``There's been a vast improvement,'' said John Kohelis, who left
the company's Steubenville, Ohio, rail car repair shop to become a
full-time facilitator, helping teams carry out projects.
   ``There's greater cooperation, better understanding,'' he said.
``We're doing so well we've broken every major production record in
Wheeling-Pittsburgh's history.''
   At its best, participative management can make die-hard union men
gush with enthusiasm.
   ``I don't care what anybody says. If you give the American worker
the education, the equipment and the opportunity, we'll blow anyone
apart. We've got the greatest work ethic of any country in the
world,'' said Tom Zidec, the 35-year-old president of Steelworkers
Local 9126 at the LTV-Sumitomo joint venture, L-S Electrogalvanizing.
   ``Do I sound optimistic?'' he said. ``People tell me I'm too
happy. I don't love this place, but it's a good job. Better than
before.''

   Patents, the guard dogs of innovation, are
gaining strength and attention as America's first line of defense
against purloined corporate ingenuity.
   An unprecedented number of applications are flooding the U.S.
Patent and Trademark Office, which expects more than 156,000 this
year, up 5 percent from last year.
   Courts are siding more often with holders of patents, trademarks
and copyrights, and the phrase ``intellectual property'' has entered
the lexicon of the emerging knowledge-based economy.
   Why all the interest? Because American industry, from steel to
clothing to microwave ovens, is running scared.
   ``If you're the undisputed leader in some technology, patents are
not that important because you pretty much call the shots. That's
what it was like 30 years ago,'' said Michael Blommer, executive
director of the American Intellectual Property Law Association.
   ``But today, the United States has lost its lead in almost every
technology and patents are becoming much more important. That's
really all you have to protect yourself.''
   Some critics say the pendulum has swung too far toward protecting
patent and copyright holders, stifling progress by preventing
inventors from building on what has come before.
   Others say tough patent protection isn't helping the United
States against technology leaders such as Japan and West Germany.
Eight of the top 10 winners of U.S. patents last year were foreign
companies.
   ``Isn't strengthening the patent system also strengthening the
non-residents?'' asked Ogden Webster, director of Eastman Kodak
Co.'s patent law department.
   One winner in the patent battlefield is Corning Inc., formerly
known as Corning Glass Works, where engineers revolutionized
communications in 1970 with their invention of optical fibers.
   These are hair-thin glass fibers that transport voices, pictures
and data on pulses of laser light. Optical-fiber cables crisscross
the country and the Atlantic and Pacific oceans.
   Corning anticipated billions of dollars in revenue from its
invention. However, other companies were eyeing the potential
market, too.
   Six years after the invention, even before much of the world was
convinced of the usefulness of Corning's creation, the company found
itself trying to enforce its patents.
   Corning sued American, Dutch and Japanese competitors. It even
sued the U.S. government for buying fiber from a competitor. From
July 1976 until earlier this year, the company was immersed in
patent enforcement lawsuits.
   The company won numerous settlements, but Sumitomo Electric
Industries Ltd. of Japan remained a holdout. The Japanese company
even built a factory in Research Triangle Park, N.C., to make fibers.
   Corning won a court order in October 1987 forcing Sumitomo to
stop making optical fiber at its North Carolina plant. Sumitomo was
allowed to make cable but had to get the fiber for it from a
competitor.
   The damage portion of the patent infringement trial is pending.
Today, Corning is the dominant producer.
   ``Corning is a believer in the patent system. It's very much a
part of its research activity. To see it working is good,'' said Al
Michaelsen, Corning's chief patent lawyer.
   The Corning experience is one that politicians and government
officials like to hear.
   ``As we look to the future, our ability to compete successfully
is going to depend on our brainpower, not our brawn,'' said Michael
Kirk, assistant commissioner for external affairs at the U.S. Patent
and Trademark Office.
   A report by the U.S. International Trade Commission last year
estimated U.S. companies lose between $43 billion and $61 billion a
year because of inadequate foreign protection of intellectual
property.
   Singapore, Taiwan and Thailand reportedly have begun to cleanse
their reputations as piracy havens, but South Korea is still a major
offender, the commission says.
   Companies must apply for patents in each country where they want
protection. Rules differ. For instance, Italy refuses to grant
patents to new drugs.
   Japan's patent office takes five years on average to issue a
patent, vs. about 1{ years in the United States, says Donald J.
Quigg, U.S. commissioner of patents and trademarks.
   An American inventor awaiting a patent in Japan has little legal
protection and therefore is almost forced to share the technology
with competitors through cross-licensing agreements, Quigg complains.
   It is much easier for Japanese companies to get patents in the
United States. For example, Hitachi Ltd. won more U.S. patents last
year than any American company.
   Kirk is helping negotiate minimum patent standards in trade talks
involving 100 nations and said he is hopeful an agreement can be
reached by the end of 1990.
   In this country, perhaps the biggest development came in 1982
with the creation of a federal appeals court in Washington devoted
solely to intellectual property disputes.
   ``This court has really turned toward lowering the standard of
patentability and upholding patents,'' said Kodak's Webster. He
should know: The court rejected Kodak's appeal of a guilty verdict
in a suit by Polaroid Corp. that forced it out of instant
photography.
   By aggressively enforcing its patent rights, Texas Instruments
Inc. earned almost as much in royalties in 1987 _ $191 million _ as
it did from operations. Last year, royalties accounted for a quarter
of its profits.
   Lotus Development Corp. and Apple Computer Inc. are facing
criticism for heavy-handed protection of patents on the ``look and
feel'' of their products, such as the Lotus 1-2-3 spreadsheet.
   To critics, patents protecting ``look and feel'' are the
equivalent of a patent by General Motors Corp. protecting the
arrangement of the steering wheel, brake and gas pedals on a car.
   Reflecting the turmoil, two-thirds of big companies in the United
States, Canada and Europe are enmeshed in litigation over
intellectual property rights, a Conference Board survey estimates.

   If there's one thing American automakers
should be able to do better than Japanese rivals, it's knowing the
styles American drivers like.
   But Japan's automakers set out to eliminate that advantage by
establishing design shops in that car-crazed corner of America,
Southern California. They've turned out the snazzy prototypes for
bestsellers like Mazda's MX-5 Miata, Nissan's Pathfinder 4x4,
Honda's CRX and Toyota's Celica.
   The American-designed Japanese cars were so successful that
Detroit was forced to follow suit with its own California design
studios.
   As is increasingly the case in the knowledge economy, the Big
Three U.S. carmakers found that to stay in the race _ even in their
own backyard _ they have to get smarter about giving consumers what
they want.
   ``They were too insulated from the popular culture; they were
still living mentally and psychologically in the Bloomfield Hills
Country Club,'' said Tony Assenza, senior editor of Car and Driver
magazine, speaking of a wealthy Detroit suburb.
   ``In the United States, everybody looks here for trends,'' said
Hiroshi Moriyoshi, who heads Mazda's Southern California design and
research outpost. ``The whole environment is conducive to
creativity.''
   Cars are so similar in price and technology that style has become
more important than ever. Hence the 14 auto design studios within
120 freeway miles of Los Angeles.
   Detroit for years kept an eye on how Californians customize cars
and hired California-trained designers, part of a watch on trends
nationwide.
   But the Japanese were the first to actually set up shop here,
beginning with Toyota Motor Corp.'s Calty Design Research Inc. in
Newport Beach in 1973. Honda Motor Co. Ltd. followed in 1974 with a
shop in Torrance, Mazda Motor Corp. in 1976 in Irvine and Nissan
Motor Co. Ltd. in 1979 in La Jolla.
   The studios were small, low-profile, seemingly unthreatening.
   Then the 1978 Celica hit the car-show circuit, catching the eye
of auto enthusiasts who tended to look at most Japanese products as
dull compacts meant for the budget-minded.
   The Japanese companies managed to make compacts stylish, turning
out sporty, young-looking cars that young people could afford.
Detroit was left wallowing behind.
   ``It was a mind-set predicated on the fact that the main car of
interest to anybody they talked to was a six-passenger, four-door
luxury automobile roughly in the shape of a brick,'' Assenza said.
   Detroit established satellite design studios, or beefed up
informal sampling of the tastes out West.
   Chrysler Corp.'s Pacific Advanced Product Design Center in
Carlsbad and General Motors Corp.'s Advanced Concepts Center in
Newbury Park sprang up in 1983, followed a year later by Ford
Concept Center California in Valencia.
   Other Japanese makers, plus Volvo and three independents, bring
the number of design studios in the area to 14. Most employ fewer
than 50.
   The Japanese had intensely practical reasons for setting up
design shops in Southern California: The West Coast was already
their business beachhead in America, and the weather was far more
agreeable than Detroit's.
   But it turns out they landed in the most wide-open auto market in
the world, where designers can sample trends just driving to work.
   ``It's the best automotive design melting pot that I can think
of,'' said Fritz Mayhew, chief design executive at Ford Motor Co. in
Detroit, who oversees the contributions of the company's California
designers.
   Then there's California's role as a crucible of popular culture.
   ``Fads, trends, do start here,'' said Ron Hill, head of the
industrial design program at the Art Center College of Design in
Pasadena, where many car designers get their start. ``People are
less inhibited to look at the new, to express themselves in ways
they're not so capable of doing in other parts of the country or the
world.''
   Among the auto trends traced to California: Hot rods, pickup
trucks as basic commuter transportation, convertible pickups, trim
and grillwork that's painted not chromed, the new emphasis on
comfortable interiors.
   Nissan's Pulsar NX, a compact with interchangeable tops that
makes it a convertible, a pickup or a station wagon, emerged in
production almost unchanged from the design, said Gerald Hirshberg,
a former GM designer who heads the company's studio in La Jolla.
   The same was true for the company's brawny, American-looking
Pathfinder 4x4 and ``hardbody'' pickups.
   Mazda's studio employs designers from Japan, the United States
and Taiwan. Several have worked in Europe.
   Nissan's Hirshberg has found the Japanese admire their American
co-workers' willingness to take risks in design, while the Americans
are taken aback by the Japanese ability to translate a design into a
practical car.
   ``There's a kind of subtle collaboration that can only happen
when parts of both cultures are put in the frying pan,'' Hirshberg
said. ``You get a tremendous energy burst when you tap into what
each culture does better.''

<HEAD>3M Scientist A Master At ``Hot Swatch'' _ Turning Ideas Into Products</HEAD>

   An inventive college dropout with a knack
for pleasing customers has shown 3M Co. it doesn't take a lab full
of molecule-minded Ph.D.s to blaze trails in technology.
   Frank Marentic earned his science degree on the workbench,
tinkering his way into the automotive design industry and giving 3M
a foothold there with 18 years of creative work in Detroit.
   He also invented a drag-reduction film known as ``Riblets'' that
helped speed Stars &amp; Stripes to victory in the 1986 America's Cup
yacht race _ a public relations dream for the $10.5 billion
diversified manufacturer.
   ``He's the last of a breed,'' said Clem Nelson, vice president of
3M's Automotive Systems Division. ``I don't think 3M will happen to
see another one like him. Everyone we hire today is from the
classroom.''
   Marentic, 57, is cherished by 3M for his ability to create the
``hot swatch,'' a rough handmade sample of an emerging product.
   ``He's got great hands,'' said William Klein, technical director
of the Industrial Tape Division at 3M. ``A lot of people have ideas,
but we need someone to reduce them to practice.''
   Once an idea is reduced to a ``swatch,'' customers can seek
refinements or quickly drop the idea _ cutting development costs by
shortening the gestation process or sparing the company the expense
of making duds.
   Speed and low cost are important even in research, the lifeblood
of the knowledge economy.
   3M, the Minnesota Mining &amp; Manufacturing Co., spends about 6.5
percent of its revenue on research and development, more than the
industry average. Last year it totaled $689 million.
   ``Research and development is an investment, but they only want
to invest a minimum amount of money for a maximum return,'' said
Terry Morris, a senior development engineer at 3M who has worked
under Marentic since he moved back to the company's Maplewood
headquarters in 1983.
   Marentic said he has a practical streak that makes 3M's financial
restraints easier to accept. But even in the leanest years he said
he has been able to cut loose on risky ventures.
   Riblets, for example, was born from an initial $600 to $1,000
expense that allowed Marentic to meet with Navy researchers who had
theorized that a microscopically fine sawtooth surface could reduce
drag and save fuel. Marentic gave the theory life when he suggested
using a plastic adhesive to create the effect instead of the metal
envisioned by the Navy.
   He unsuccessfully tried to apply it to cars during the energy
crisis and was selling the idea to airplane manufacturers when Stars
&amp; Stripes called.
   The 2{ months he spent in Australia to baby-sit the yacht's hull
were one of the crowning achievements of his career and two years
later he received 3M's highest honor _ the Carlton Award for career
contributions in research.
   Riblets hasn't made money for 3M, but Marentic still champions it
as a potential revenue giant because airplane makers are toying with
it.
   ``If I wouldn't have done this I would have gone into music,''
said Marentic, a former trumpet player whose brother, James, is a
professional jazz artist. ``I like the creativity one has in jazz.
What I do is an extension of that.''
   Nelson said Marentic is a rarity because he rose to division
scientist after joining 3M in 1955 as an entry-level technician. He
had found the University of Minnesota boring and quit during his
freshman year, only to be inspired to pursue a scientific career by
his first 3M boss, Dick Drew, the inventor of Scotch tape.
   ```We spent up to 15 percent of our time pursuing things that
were not related to our job function,'' Marentic said. ``We were
allowed to create.''
   In Detroit from 1968 to 1983, Marentic headed a research lab that
gained the respect of automakers for adding decorative touches to
car bodies. One of his first successes was the horseshoe-shaped
stripe on the side of Ford's 1967 Mustang. He struck gold for 3M and
Pontiac by developing a strong, cost-efficient technology to
emblazon the Firebird emblem on the car's hood.
   ``I think GM made about $11 million off that car and we made a
little bit ourselves,'' Marentic said.
   Jeff Janssen, a senior chemist at 3M, said Marentic has a hidden
talent for sales because he gleans information from customers to
find out what they really want.
   But Janssen agreed with others that Marentic's greatest asset is
his practical creativity.
   ``The molecule guys get too hung up on what they can't do,''
Janssen said. ``That doesn't stop Frank.''

<HEAD>University In Detroit's Shadows Joins Knowledge Economy Battle</HEAD>

<DATELINE>ANN ARBOR, Mich. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   When prosperity depends on ideas,
higher-learning institutions such as the University of Michigan
become as important as gritty factory towns were during the
Industrial Revolution.
   Corporate research facilities crowding northeast Ann Arbor are
proof that knowledge today equals power and profits, and college
towns aren't placid bystanders in the brains-over-brawn brawl.
   In recessionary chills of years past, manufacturing-heavy
Michigan caught economic pneumonia. When people delayed big
purchases like cars, Michigan shut down. It happened in the last
downturn, pushing the state's jobless rate as high as 17.3 percent
in December 1982.
   Michigan is hoping to use high technology to diversify the
economy and avoid that jobless jolt the next time a recession comes.
At the same time, there's a statewide effort to make Michigan's big
factories more competitive.
   Success will mean other regions look to Michigan for lessons,
state Commerce Director Doug Ross said.
   With the University of Michigan in the lead, Ann Arbor is a major
source of the technology to restore Michigan's manufacturing might.
   Research facilities now dot the university area and form a
40-mile automation alley along Interstate 94 from Ann Arbor to
Detroit. Their success is reflected in state job figures.
   Employment that hovered around 3.5 million jobs in 1982 topped 4
million in 1986 and has ranged around 4.3 million in 1989, the
highest ever recorded in Michigan.
   The number of jobless, which reached 749,000 in December 1982,
has dipped below 300,000 in two months this year, for the first time
since 1978. Seasonally adjusted employment rates from the U.S.
Bureau of Labor Statistics have dropped as low as 6.1 percent.
   The much-maligned rust belt starts with innate advantages, built
up over time and sometimes not appreciated until a company moves,
said J. Downs Herold, who manages the university's industrial
development research program.
   ``What you have here are a lot of little tool and die shops, and
model makers,'' Herold said. ``The amount of expertise that exists
among these places _ in heat-treating, sandblasting, the ability to
bend and mold metals of all types _ that's an infrastructure you
don't just start out and build.''
   It may seem worthwhile at first to move elsewhere _ for lower
labor costs, for example, Herold said. ``But when you need something
special you don't just run down the street and say, `I wonder if
Charlie can do that.' It's probably the same thing if you're out in
California and want to develop a new electronic chip.''
   To add the advanced technology edge, the university's college of
engineering emphasizes research contracts with auto, chemical,
electronics, computer and aerospace companies including General
Motors Corp., Ford Motor Co., Chrysler Corp. and Dow Chemical Co.,
said Robert W. Schneider, director of corporate relations at the
college.
   Students pursue real-world investigations in their area of
interest, and the research provides material for Ph.D. theses.
Sometimes research leads to post-graduate employment.
   One GM project with the college led to a computer software system
that reschedules plant operations in case of an equipment breakdown
to keep turning out the most-needed products.
   GM has similar programs with other schools such as Rensselaer
Polytechnic Institute in Troy, N.Y., Massachusetts Institute of
Technology in Cambridge, Mass., and Stanford University in Palo
Alto, Calif.
   GM assigns experienced engineers, usually with advanced degrees,
to work with the students, said Jim Caie, director of advanced
manufacturing engineering at GM.
   ``We certainly aren't dummies. We are really in most cases on the
cutting edge of technology,'' he said. ``We need to leverage
ourselves as much as possible _ get good people from the
universities helping us. We can't do it all ourselves.''
   The University of Michigan's intellectual properties office has
expanded from one part-time staffer 10 years ago to 10 people today.
Its royalty income from faculty inventions rose 66 percent in 1987
and another 10 percent last year, to $850,000.
   ``What you're finding is that intellectual property issues are
becoming increasingly important in American business,'' said Bob
Gavin, director of the office. ``That is a function of the United
States recognizing that it has to protect its knowledge because that
is the basis of its future economy.''
   Patented items include a fluid that gets thicker or thinner
depending on an electrical charge applied to it.
   Auto companies are vitally interested in how it could be used in
hydraulics, said Frederick H. Reinhart Jr., marketing director of
the intellectual properties office.
   Besides ideas, ``Ann Arbor has also become the home of an awful
lot of new industries where people get an idea and spin something
off,'' said Herold, the university industrial development official.
   In a coup with a ripple effect, the university also helped lure
the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's auto emissions laboratory.
   That led to establishment of a string of laboratories by auto
companies, especially importers, that wanted to tinker with cars
failing to meet U.S. emissions requirements without taking them home.

   Chris Peters stretched for words as he
tried to describe how he makes his living.
   ``It's hard to even explain sometimes what you're thinking when
you're writing a program,'' said Peters, a software developer for
Microsoft Corp. ``You're not thinking in English. It's hard even to
describe the thought process.
   ``You actually are the computer at the point you're writing the
program.''
   Whether or not he can articulate it, Peters can do it. He's one
of just 12 computer programmers who work on the Microsoft Excel
spreadsheet program.
   The bookkeeping program is one of Microsoft's key products, its
weapon for capturing market share from Lotus Development Corp.'s
1-2-3, the best-selling spreadsheet program.
   As much as any modern product, software epitomizes what is meant
by the knowledge economy.
   Microsoft and other software companies' physical products are but
a few dollars' worth of magnetic tape or disks, a manual and a
catchy package.
   What people pay for is the computer code, the abstraction of a
physical process such as record-keeping that allows a computer and
its operator to do complex functions in split seconds.
   The raw materials are the ideas of the companies' programmers and
engineers, marketers and managers. It's what their people know and
how well they can express it that brings in the money.
   Founded just 15 years ago by William Gates and Paul Allen,
Microsoft is now the largest company specializing in personal
computer software.
   Gates and Allen also provided an information-age legend: a couple
of college kids who wrote a language program for a computer they
read about in an electronics magazine, and turned that asset into a
corporation worth hundreds of millions of dollars.
   Gates' stock made him the youngest self-made billionaire ever.
   Programmers all over the country, working at the kitchen table or
small offices, still try to emulate Gates. But in the big leagues,
where programs can reach 450,000 lines of computer code, making
software has long since expanded from a one-brain concoction.
   At Microsoft's headquarters in a fir-shaded suburban Seattle
office park, the workfloor for Excel is a long hallway lined with
compact offices. The wing has the atmosphere of graduate student
cubicles in a large university _ if there's a college where students
can afford BMWs.
   Down the hall is a room with pinball and video games. Standard
office decor is mounds of paper and three to six personal computers.
One programmer, Eddy Fries, has turned an old computer monitor into
a tropical fishbowl.
   The flip side of the frisbees and amateur jugglers who come out
on nice days is an intensity where arguments and egos can flare and
work can go on around the clock to make deadlines.
   That's what comes in a company where ``the norm is near-genius
level and not just in smarts but in creativity and everything
else,'' Peters said.
   ``If you love what you're doing and people say, `Oh, but you're
at work all the time.' Well, yeah, right. This is fun, right?''
   Peters, 31, joined the company in 1981 as the 100th employee, and
is now about 40th in seniority in a company that employs about 3,800.
   What keeps him, he said, is that Microsoft and Gates _ himself a
programmer _ treat software writers ``like prima donnas.''
   Stewart Alsop, publisher of the industry newsletter P.C. Letter,
agrees. While Microsoft executives may give speeches about the need
for industry standards, Alsop says that doesn't stop their own
developers from violating the rules if the program demands it.
   ``They focus on the very essentials of software _ does it do what
people want it to do?''
   Microsoft assigns far fewer programmers to a team than do other
software giants. Where Lotus has 12 to more than 30 programmers
working on versions of 1-2-3, Microsoft's 12-member team creates all
three forms of Excel _ for Apple Macintosh, MS-DOS and OS-2
operating systems _ plus foreign translations.
   Although Lotus' teams are larger, Frank Ingari, vice president
for Lotus' personal spreadsheet computer division, agrees you can't
get quality by designing by committee.
   ``No matter how many are on the team you find a small number who
are the actual architects,'' he said.
   Peters said 95 percent of writing the intricate code that makes a
program work is simply an individual programmer staring at a screen,
puzzling it out until the solution comes. ``He'll sit there and
he'll think real hard. And he might walk around the halls _ he might
find some guy and corner him and just talk at him.''
   Hallways are a big deal at Microsoft, Peters said. ``You work
privately but together. It's kind of weird.''
   Though programmers build new features on blocks of code written
before, and may use programs to edit and search code for bugs,
Peters doesn't put much faith in programs that claim to actually
write software.
   ``No, we do it the old-fashioned way. I mean, what kind of junk
would be generated by a machine?''
   In a way, Peters said, writing software is like designing a
building _ bad code is ``an awful bit of carpentry that won't hold
the roof up.'' It's also like mastering a foreign language _ ``it
takes a few years to even know how to read the stuff and know that
it's good.''
   Or maybe, he said, it's like composing music.
   ``The stuff can be very beautiful, and the funny thing, the user
never sees it,'' Peters said. ``You can look at someone's code and
it will flow. There will just be this elegance to it.''

<DATELINE>TOLEDO, Ohio (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Financially troubled Trustcorp has agreed to
be bought by Society Corp. in a stock-swap deal valued at about $495
million, both companies said today.
   The announcement follows months of speculation that Toledo-based
Trustcorp might be a takeover target due to its financial woes,
which included writeoffs of $76 million in bad real estate loans
over the past five months.
   Trustcorp also recently added $24 million to its loan-loss
reserves.
   Under the buyout, Cleveland-based Society agreed to swap
three-quarters of of its common shares for each of Trustcorp's
shares. Society also was given the option of buying unissued
Trustcorp common shares equal to 24.9 percent of the total
outstanding shares.
   The combined bank holding company will have about $16 billion in
assets.
   Chester Devenow, Trustcorp's interim president and chief
executive officer, called the deal, ``a tremdous step forward.''
   ``We are not giving up ownership of this bank,'' he said. ``We
believe our partnership with a quality company like Society Corp.
will be in the best interest of our shareholders, our customers, our
employees and the communities we serve.''
   Society Chairman Robert W. Gillespie, chairman and chief
executive officer of Society Corp., said ``substantial additional
contributions'' to Trustcorp's loan-loss reserve would be necessary.
   He told a news conference he understood the problems Trustcorp
has had with bad loans.
   ``They're recognized. We want to put it behind us by the end of
the year. It's a chapter that needs to be closed,'' Gillespie said.
   Six of Trustcorp's top executives, including George Haigh, former
president, chairman and chief executive officer, resigned or were
fired in the wake of the losses.
   The $76 million in write-offs resulted in a drop in Trustcorp's
overall earnings in 1988, to $1.3 million, or 8 cents a share,
compared with $47.8 million, or $2.91 a share, in 1987.
   In addition, the insitution's earnings dropped nearly $5 million
in the first quarter of 1989.
   William Prebe, an independent financial consultant and University
of Toledo economics professor, said Society likely would transfer
some of Trustcorp's Toledo operations to Cleveland.
   ``If they are bottom line oriented and look to trim expenses and
costs, obviously the first place they will trim will be Toledo,'' he
said. ``They are not going to trim Society in Cleveland.

<TEXT>
   A federal bankruptcy judge today issued a
temporary restraining order blocking Donald Trump's $63 million bid
to buy the debt-ridden Elsinore's Atlantis Casino Hotel.
   After a brief hearing, U.S. District Court Judge Rosemary
Gambardella granted the request by creditors who hold mortgages on
three of the Atlantic City casino's parking lots.
   The creditors said they weren't given adequate notice of details
surrounding the proposed offer. They also want the judge to force
Elsinore Corp. to find a higher bidder.
   On Friday, the state Casino Control Commission ended three days
of hearings on the sale by voting unanimously to allow Trump to buy
the casino and convert it into a luxury, non-casino hotel.
   Trump's attorneys would not comment on how today's decision might
affect the proposed sale, which is slated for closing July 7.
   The casino was the first in Atlantic City to not have its license
renewal approved by state gaming officials.
   Ms. Gambardella scheduled another hearing for June 29.

   For the third time in 22 years, Newsweek magazine
has placed its weekly rival, Time, on its own cover.
   And Newsweek is bragging about it. The magazine took out a
full-page ad in Monday's New York Times featuring this week's cover:
a picture of a mock Time cover with the headline: ``The Battle Over
Time Inc.''
   The reference was to Time's struggle to merge with Warner
Communications Inc. and fend off the advances of Paramount
Communications Inc.
   ``We're not afraid to say it,'' bragged the Newsweek ad.
``Newsweek was the first news magazine to report on the proposed
Time-Warner merger. This week, we continue this saga of corporate
warfare.''
   ``We stay ahead of the competition _ even when the competition is
the story,'' the ad concluded.
   The first occasion that Time appeared on Newsweek's cover was in
1967, when Time co-founder Henry Luce died. The cover of Newsweek
depicted a Time cover bearing a photo of the late publishing titan.
   On Feb. 4, 1985, Time next appeared on Newsweek's cover for a
story on Ariel Sharon's libel suit against Time.
   Rick Smith, Newsweek editor-in-chief, said using Time as a cover
this week was justified because the Time-Warner-Paramount battle is
``a classic story of modern business.''
   ``Here you have three of the best-known companies in America
arguing over shareholder rights, international competitiveness,
corporate debt and, not incidentally, who's going to control
multi-billion dollar media empires,'' he said.
   Time is fighting off an unwanted $10.7 billion buyout bid from
Paramount, and trying to preserve a planned merger with Warner. On
Friday, Time announced it was launching a $14 billion tender off for
Warner.
   Meanwhile, Time put actor Kevin Costner on its cover this week.
Costner, the cover announced, is ``The New American Hero _ Smart,
Sexy and on a Roll.''
   Time's own newspaper ad also mentioned several other featured
stories in the current issue, not including the one about the battle
over its corporate parent.

   NWA Inc., the parent of Northwest Airlines,
and a group led by investor Alfred Checchi announced an agreement
today under which Checchi's group would buy the nation's
fourth-largest airline for $4.05 billion.
   The $121-a-share bid by Checchi's group, Wings Holding Inc.,
defeated at least three other NWA suitors: rival airline Pan Am
Corp.; the International Association of Machinists, which represents
many Northwest workers; and oil billionaire Marvin Davis.
   None of the three immediately responded to the announcement.
   On Wall Street, investors reacted positively to the deal, bidding
NWA stock up $7 a share to $114.62{ today on the New York Stock
Exchange.
   Checchi's group, which already owns 4.9 percent of NWA's stock
was to begin a tender offer within five days, paying $3.7 billion
for 30.5 million outstanding shares.
   The financial package includes additional equity that would boost
the total price to $4.05 billion. The investor group said it is
obtaining financing from commercial banks led by Bankers Trust Co.
   Northwest also announced that its board approved a
recapitalization plan that would be implemented if the transaction
with the Checchi group is not completed.
   Checchi told The Associated Press today that he would not change
NWA's management, led by Chairman Steven Rothmeier.
   ``I talked to Steve last night and we mutually congratulated each
other,'' Checchi said. ``I certainly hope he plans on staying. I
have no reason to believe he is not.''
   In addition, Checchi said there are no plans to move Northwest
headquarters from Eagan, a southern Minneapolis suburb.
   The announcement ended weeks of speculation about Northwest's
future.
   ``The magnitude of the equity to be invested in our transaction
demonstrates our commitment to a responsible capital structure that
will ensure that NWA will continue as a financially sound, growing
entity,'' Checchi, a former Marriott Corp. executive considered by
the airline as a friendly bidder, said in a prepared statement.
   ``Our financing plan has been designed to accommodate a program
of substantial growth, including all of the new aircraft purchases
contemplated by NWA's management,'' he said.
   Equity investors in Checchi's group, Wings Holding Inc., include
Checchi and his associates; KLM Royal Dutch Airlines; Bankers Trust
Co.; Richard C. Blum and Associates, a San Francisco merchant
banking and investment firm; and Elders Finance Group, the
announcement said.
   KLM could never exert control over Northwest because federal
regulations limit foreign ownership to a maximum of 25 percent.
   Barbara Beyer of Avmark Inc., an aviation consulting firm in
Arlington, Va., has said Northwest and KLM could work together by
sharing gates and coordinating schedules for connecting flights. The
arrangement would not result in any merger of employees or corporate
staff, she said.
   Federal regulators are expected to scrutinize the proposal,
applying a financial fitness test to the group. The fear is that too
much takeover debt could limit a new owner's ability to properly
maintain equipment.
   Takeover debt also is a concern among Northwest pilots, who fear
that a highly leveraged acquisition of the airline would prompt the
sale of routes or other major assets.
   H.T. Dodge and Kirk Faupel, leaders of the 5,000-member Air Line
Pilots Association unit at Northwest, have threatened to strike if
the deal approved by NWA's board involves too much debt.
   Pilots wield some power in the takeover battle because they have
an open contract. Unless Northwest settles with the union, the new
owner would have the task of combining the expired contracts of
former Republic Airlines pilots with those of former Northwest
Orient pilots. Northwest acquired Republic in 1986.
   Besides the four known bidders, two New York takeover firms,
Kohlberg Kravis Roberts &amp; Co. and Forstmann Little &amp; Co., were
believed to have submitted offers. Both have declined to comment and
NWA has refused to identify the bidders.
   Less than a year ago, NWA stock was trading in the range of $40 a
share. It increased gradually on takeover rumors and shot into the
$100-a-share range shortly after Davis announced March 28 that he
would buy the company, based in suburban Eagan, for $2.7 billion, or
$90 a share. It closed Friday at $107.62{, up 12{ cents.
   The board rejected Davis' bid and his subsequent tender offer for
the same amount, but it invited him to submit a higher bid in a
process that quickly attracted financially troubled Pan Am.
   The New York-based carrier is more than $900 million in debt but
is considered a contender by some analysts because its
Atlantic-heavy route system is a perfect fit with Northwest's
domestic flights and dominance in the Pacific Rim.

   Share prices closed higher on Monday as a steady
performance by the British currency helped the market shrug off the
slump in support for the governing Conservative Party revealed in
the European election results.
   But trading remained quiet through the day, with a handful of the
leading stocks accounting for much of the day's trading volume.
   The Conservative Party's share of the vote slumped in the
European Parliament elections, but market analysts said the election
reverse was widely forecast and didn't necessarily indicate voting
trends for the next general election, due to be held at some point
before mid-1992.
   The pound's resilience eased fears that a poor election result
would contribute to another slide in the currency and pressure the
government to raise interest rates again, said Jeffrey Thompson, an
equity analyst at the brokerage firm Barclays de Zoete Wedd Ltd.
   The Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index closed 10.8
points, or 0.5 percent, higher at 2,154.7. Volume came to 360.3
million shares, down from 513.8 million shares on Friday.

<HEAD>Decision on Loans Must Be Made by End of Month</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CARL HARTMAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Major governments that run the World Bank, led
by the United States, must decide by the end of the month whether to
approve $700 million in easy loans they have been planning to give
China.
   The World Bank's plan calls for $2 billion in loans to China this
year, but with less than two weeks remaining before the fiscal year
ends June 30, $700 million of the total has not yet been approved by
the 22 members of its board of executive directors.
   They represent the 151 member governments. The U.S. member has
the largest voting power, more than 18 percent.
   At the bank's headquarters in Washington, the last weeks of June
see a rush of board action on loans to meet the schedule for the
current fiscal year. Spokesman Pastor Sison said it would be hard to
shift the $700 million planned for China to other borrowers.
   ``Loans take a certain amount of preparation,'' he said.
   China was due to be the bank's third biggest borrower this year,
after India and Mexico. The bank, the largest source of aid to Third
World countries, is planning to lend a total of $20 billion to $21
billion.
   On June 4, Chinese troops cleared demonstrators from the
Tiananmen Square area in central Beijing. Unofficial reports say as
many as 3,000 people were killed; the Chinese governnment says 200
to 300, most of them soldiers.
   The bank immediately pulled out all but one of its eight
permanent staffers in the Chinese capital.
   The international staff in Washington _ headed by President
Barber Conable, an American _ decided the following Thursday not to
submit to the board a proposed long-term loan of $60 million to help
farming in China's Jiangxi province. Such loans carry interest at
less than 1 percent a year.
   Sison said the Chinese government immediately promised the bank
that its obligations would continue to be fulfilled on schedule.
Zhang Junyi, a Chinese, is one of the 22 board members, stationed in
Washington. Edwin Lim _ a Filipino who heads the bank's mission in
Beijing _ has returned to his post, Sison said. Two bank officials
from Washington have joined him for talks there.
   Sison said that on June 13, the bank staff decided to hold back
two more loans from the board: one for $180 million to improve
China's electricity supply, and one for $50 million to help
technical schools.
   Attila Karaosmanoglu, the bank's vice president for Asia, told
reporters Wednesday that talks were on in Beijing about resuming
consideration of the loans.

   Most corn futures prices closed up the permitted
daily limit of 10 cents a bushel Monday on the Chicago Board of
Trade on forecasts for a week of hot, dry weather in the Midwest.
   Soybean and oat futures also rose sharply while wheat futures
finished with modest gains.
   Despite more than a month of cool, rainy weather in the Corn
Belt, soil conditions remain dry in the region's western half.
   ``Iowa still has a very substantial subsoil moisture problem,''
said Katharina Zimmer, a grain-market analyst with Merrill Lynch
Capital Markets Inc. ``If you shut off the rain, you're going to
have a major problem.''
   The corn market received additional support from the Agriculture
Department's decision to extend the due date on loans covering 700
million bushels of corn, keeping at least some of that grain off the
market for another six months.
   Gains in the wheat market were limited by selling linked to the
advancing winter wheat harvest.
   At the close, wheat was 1{ cents to 3 cents higher with the
contract for delivery in July at $3.96{ a bushel; corn was 8} cents
to 10 cents higher with July at $2.72{ a bushel; oats were 6} cents

<HEAD>Business As Usual For Some Companies In China</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Some U.S. businesses are slowly resuming their
operations in China, although most are holding off as they monitor
the country's shifting political climate following the government's
bloody crackdown on pro-democracy demonstrators.
   ``There are some Americans back,'' Martin Weil, a spokesman for
the Washington-based United States-China Business Council, said
Monday.
   ``Companies that already have investments there or urgent
business reasons to get their people there quickly _ logically
you'll expect to see them back in Beijing before others.
   ``But I think right now most companies are still in a
wait-and-see mode.''
   Hundreds of joint ventures worth billions of dollars were put on
hold or severely curtailed after Chinese troops quashed a
pro-democracy uprising, killing hundreds of its citizens, earlier
this month. Many companies evacuated their employees en masse,
particularly in Beijing.
   China's tourist trade, which earned more than $2 billion in
foreign currency annually for the Chinese, also was severely
damaged, and the outlook remains uncertain.
   A number of U.S.-based companies said most of their employees
were back to work in China and many of their operations have resumed
amid increasing signs of stability.
   ``We have told them (employees in Beijing) they can go back,''
said an official for Los Angeles-based Occidental Petroleum Corp.,
who asked that he not be identified.
   He said work also was ``continuing in its normal course'' in an
open-pit mine about 230 miles southwest of the Chinese capital.
   Meanwhile, most of the 40 expatriates who had nearly finished
erecting Shanghai's tallest building _ a $175 million 50-story
business complex _ planned to head back to work by midweek, said
A.J. Robinson, executive vice president of Portman Overseas of
Atlanta, which is overseeing the project.
   ``Those of us who are committed to China business over the long
term think whatever has happened is a temporary aberration,''
Robinson said. ``We're in this for the long haul: the next 25
years.''
   Virginia Kamsky, a New York consultant who assists companies
doing business in China, said the Chinese ``have been bending over
backwards to be more flexible than ever'' since the latest wave of
repression began.
   ``Payment under Bank of China letters of credit has been coming
in faster than ever,'' she said. ``Usually it takes U.S. exporters
11 to 14 days to get paid. But now the Chinese have cut out a step,
and payment is coming through in only five to six days.''
   Not everyone, however, was ready to continue operations in China.
   ``We're watching the situation in China on a day-by-day basis,''
said Donald N. Hanson, a spokesman for Long Beach, Calif.-based
McDonnell Douglas Corp., which recently evacuated its 50 Chinese
employees.
   ``Most of our people are in Hong Kong and trying to do work from
there in terms of getting all of the planning done and the
preparations made so that when they do get back they can pick up
where they left off.''

<TEXT>
   The Bush administration said Monday that
Americans should continue avoiding China even if the turmoil there
appears to have temporarily subsided.
   At the same time, administration officials rejected a suggestion
by House Speaker Thomas S. Foley, D-Wash., that President Bush
intensify his condemnation of the Beijing government in view of the
recent death sentences for student dissidents.
   ``I think we've said everything we have to say on China. The
president's quite clear on that,'' deputy press secretary Roman
Popadiuk told a White House briefing.
   Overall, the Bush administration maintained its reserve about
developments in China.
   ``The president is quite anxious we not do anything that would
hurt the Chinese people,'' Secretary of State James A. Baker III
said.
   ``The United States has been speaking out. We've been speaking
out quite vigorously,'' Baker said in response to reporters'
questions.
   Popadiuk disputed a report that Bush was appalled by faulty U.S.
intelligence reports on China, including an erroneous dispatch that
Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping had lapsed into a coma.
   The report, in the current issue of U.S. News &amp; World Report,
said that Bush _ who headed the CIA in the Ford administration _
intended to replace CIA director William Webster by year's end.
   ``The CIA is doing a superb job,'' Popadiuk said. ``There is no
truth to the article and the president supports Director Webster.''
   At the State Department, spokeswoman Margaret Tutwiler said that,
despite what she called ``a pause in anti-U.S. propaganda over the
weekend,'' the situation in China remains ``far from normal.''
   ``The department's travel advisory warning Americans against
travel to China remains in effect,'' she said. ``We are not going to
lift our travel advisory.''
   Asked if she had any advice for U.S. businesses wanting to
return, Ms. Tutwiler said: ``We cannot be encouraging Americans to
go back to China when we have a State Department policy warning
advising them not to travel in China.''
   Both White House and State Department officials said that no new
sanctions were planned against the Beijing government _ beyond the
halt in military sales announced two weeks ago by Bush _ despite a
call over the weekend by Foley for a more aggressive U.S. stance.
   ``The president has spoken very succinctly on this ... how he
views this relationship, how important this relationship is between
these two countries. He has ... said he did not want to do anything
to hurt the Chinese people, that that is where we are,'' Ms.
Tutwiler said.
   Foley, interviewed Sunday on NBC's ``Meet the Press,'' said Bush
should be speaking out more forcefully in opposition to the harsh
Chinese crackdown on pro-democracy dissidents.
   The speaker also said the United States should break relations
immediately with China if the Chinese use violence against the U.S.
Embassy in Beijing to seize dissident Fang Lizhi, who sought refuge
there two weeks ago.
   The U.S. decision to harbor Fang and his wife Li Shuxian has
angered the Chinese leadership, which has accused the United States
of interfering in China's internal affairs.
   Fang remains in the U.S. Embassy, officials said.
   Ms. Tutwiler would not comment on whether the State Department
had urged Fang's son against a trip to Washington. ``I'm not going
to take responsiblity for somehow maybe getting someone's personal
safety in jeopardy,'' she said.
   Ms. Tutwiler also said that tough new restrictions by China on
obtaining exit visas for Chinese who wish to leave the country _ due
to take effect on Tuesday _ had produced extremely long lines at the
visa office in Shanghai.

restraining order Monday to temporarily block developer Donald
Trump's $63 million bid to buy the debt-ridden Elsinore Atlantis
Casino Hotel in Atlantic City, N.J.
   U.S. District Court Judge Rosemary Gambardella issued the 10-day
order after a brief hearing, ruling that ``irreparable harm and
injury'' will result if the deal is allowed to proceed without
additional hearings.
   Creditors hold a $6.5 million mortgage on three Atlantis parking
lots. They requested the order preventing New Jersey's Casino
Control Commission, a state-appointed conservator and Elsinore Shore
Associates, owners of the boardwalk property, from transferring the
property to Trump.
   The judge scheduled a hearing for June 29. She will then consider
extending the restraining order and whether or not additional bids
should be solicited for the failing property.
   Edward J. DiDonato, a Philadelphia attorney who represents the
three creditors, said after the hearing he was pleased with the
ruling.
   ``It gives us what we originally hoped for _ that is notice to
creditors and hopefully a higher and better offer,'' DiDonato said.
   Trump plans to close the casino and convert the gaming complex
into a luxury hotel.
   Arthur Sklar, an attorney representing Donald J. Trump
Acquisitions, which is handling the purchase of the Atlantis,
declined to comment on whether the restraining order would affect
the deal. He said the sale is set for closing on July 7.
   On Friday, New Jersey gaming regulators ended a month-long
struggle over the Atlantis, approving Trump's bid by a 5-0 vote. The
Casino Control Commission said it did not believe Trump was gaining
too much power in Atlantic City when it approved the purchase by the
billionaire developer.
   Trump owns two Atlantic City casinos and has a third under
construction. If he buys the Atlantis, it would give him control of
34 percent of casino hotel rooms, 31 percent of casino floor space
and revenue, and 48 percent of casino meeting and exhibition space,
according to commission statistics.
   Sklar said Elsinore, which emerged from bankruptcy reorganization
last fall, planned to formally ask Ms. Gambardella to approve the
sale of the Atlantis, which has debts estimated at $150 million.
   DiDonato, however, said his clients did not receive adequate
notice of details of the agreement with Trump, which was announced a
day after the casino's gaming license expired.
   In April, the Atlantis became the first New Jersey gaming house
to fail to get its regular license renewed since legal casino
gambling began in Atlantic City in 1978.
   The state ordered the casino to shut down last month, ruling that
the gaming hall's financial situation was too marginal to allow it
to continue operations.

   The dollar drifted lower against most major
currencies in dull, cautious trading Monday following last week's
selloff.
   Gold prices were higher. Republic National Bank of New York said
a troy ounce of gold was bid at $366 as of 4 p.m. EDT, up $2 from
late Friday.
   Analysts said sentiment toward the dollar remained generally
bullish, but a sense of caution prevailed Monday as traders faced
the prospect of further central-bank intervention to curb the
dollar's gains.
   ``I think people are tired. Last week probably took a lot out of
people,'' said Craig Sloane, a currency analyst with Smith Barney,
Harris, Upham &amp; Co.
   Heavy central-bank dollar selling helped push the dollar sharply
lower last week, along with a report out of Japan pointing to joint
cooperation between Japan and West Germany to hold down the dollar
outside their home markets.
   In Tokyo, where trading ends before Europe's business day begins,
the dollar rose 0.45 Japanese yen to a closing 145.50 yen. It was
quoted at 144.45 yen in London, and 144.60 yen in New York, down
from 144.70 Friday.
   The British pound rose in London to $1.5485 from $1.5340 late
Friday. Sterling fetched $1.5430 in New York, up from $1.5410.
   Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with Friday,
included: 1.9785 West German marks, down from 1.9810; 1.7090 Swiss
francs, down from 1.7110; 1.19865 Canadian dollars, up from 1.19725;
6.7155 French francs, down from 6.7290; and 1,431.50 Italian lire,
down from 1,441.
   Late dollar rates in Europe, compared with late Friday: 1.9735
West German marks, down from 1.9915; 1.7045 Swiss francs, down from
1.7213; 6.6940 French francs, down from 6.7620; 2.2351 Dutch
guilders, down from 2.2385; 1,439.75 Italian lire, down from
1,443.50; and 1.1991 Canadian dollars, up from 1.1973.
   On the Commodity Exchange in New York gold bullion for current
delivery closed at $367.10 a troy ounce, up from $365.10 Friday.
   Gold rose in London to a late bid price of $366.50 a troy ounce,
up from late Friday's $363.75. In Zurich, gold rose to close at a
bid of $366.25, up from $363.75 late Friday.
   All financial institutions in Hong Kong were closed Monday for
official birthday celebrations of Queen Elizabeth II.
   Silver prices gained ground. On New York's Comex, silver bullion
for current delivery rose to $5.323 a troy ounce from $5.285 Friday.
Silver rose in London to $5.37 an ounce from Friday's $5.27.

<HEAD>Trustcorp to Merge with Society Corp. of Cleveland</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MITCH WEISS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>TOLEDO, Ohio (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Trustcorp Inc., which has been rocked by bad
loans, has agreed to be bought by Society Corp. of Cleveland in a
stock-swap deal worth about $495 million, company officials
announced Monday.
   The agreement was approved Sunday night by the boards of
directors of both companies, said Robert W. Gillespie, chairman of
Society Corp.
   The deal, which still needs to be approved by Trustcorp
shareholders and the Federal Reserve Board, should be closed by the
end of the year, Gillespie said.
   ``From Society's perspective, it's the first time we've ventured
outside of the borders of Ohio. We think it's a teriffic way for us
to enter into the interstate regional banking activities,''
Gillespie said at a news conference.
   Society said the deal would expand the bank holding company into
two new markets _ Indiana and Michigan.
   Toledo-based Trustcorp, reeling from bad loans on development
projects, said the merger was in the best interest of its
shareholders.
   ``This is not a disaster,'' said Chester Devenow, Trustcorp's
interim president and chief executive officer. ``I am very pleased
with what's happened here. I feel very comfortable that it's in the
best interest of our shareholders and employees, but also for the
city of Toledo. ... We're not giving up ownership of this bank.''
   Under the agreement, holders of Trustcorp common shares will
receive three fourths of a Society common share for each share of
Trustcorp common stock. Society will pay about $30 a share for
nearly 16 million shares of Trustcorp stock.
   The combined operation will have about $16 billion in assets.
   Trustcorp shareholders will hold about 35 percent of Society's
stock after the merger and will be represented on Society's board.
   Trustcorp Bank of Ohio, a Trustcorp Inc. subsidiary, would be
absorbed into the Society system, while Trustcorp Inc. would be
dissolved. Frederick Teal, chairman of Society's bank in Columbus,
Ohio, would become the new chief executive officer of Trustcorp
Bank, Ohio.
   Society hasn't decided on a corporate name for Trustcorp,
Gillespie said.
   ``It's not our intention for Trustcorp to become a branch office
of a Cleveland company. We intend to run Trustcorp of Ohio as a
stand-alone, independent bank,'' he said.
   The decision to sell Trustcorp follows months of speculation that
the holding company would be the target of a takeover because of
financial troubles.
   Trustcorp in the last five months had to write off $76 million
because of the bad loans. The company took $52 million in write-offs
and added $24 million to its loan-loss reserves.
   A write-off is a loan that no longer is expected to be repaid and
written off as a bad debt.
   The losses were blamed on loans on real estate development
projects, particularly in downtown Toledo. Trustcorp had loaned
about $100 million to various downtown Toledo projects during the
last decade.
   Six of Trustcorp's top executives, including George Haigh, former
president, chairman and chief executive officer, resigned or were
fired in the wake of the losses.
   Gillespie said Trustcorp had several non-banking operations that
would enhance Society's business, including an insurance agency, a
travel agency and an investment advisory unit.
   Society said the merger would make it the third-largest bank
holding company in Ohio and the 40th in the nation. Society now
ranks fourth in Ohio and 54th in the nation.
   Trustcorp has assets of $5.9 billion with 170 banking outlets in
Ohio, Indiana, Michgan and Florida.
   Society has nearly $10 billion in assets with more than 200
outlets across Ohio and affiliates based in Cleveland, Canton,
Columbus and Dayton.

   The stock market settled for a mixed showing
Monday in a subdued atmosphere following Friday's ``triple witching
hour.''
   Trading set its slowest pace in more than two months.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials dropped 6.49 to 2,479.89,
while some other prominent market indicators eked out small gains.
   Declining issues slightly outnumbered advances in nationwide
trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed stocks, with 686 up, 733
down and 542 unchanged.
   Volume on the floor of the Big Board came to 130.72 million
shares, down from 244.51 million Friday and the lightest total since
a 128.54 million-share day on April 17.
   Nationwide, consolidated volume in NYSE-listed issues, including
trades in those stocks on regional exchanges and in the
over-the-counter market, totaled 155.13 million shares.
   The market held steady on Friday amid a barrage of activity by
traders completing computer-program strategies involving a group of
expiring stock index options and futures.
   Analysts noted that these quarterly witching hours are often
followed by at least a brief letdown in stock prices and trading
volume.
   In addition, brokers cited lingering uncertainty over the next
likely turn in the Federal Reserve's credit policy. The stream of
economic data that Wall Streeters watch along with the Fed runs dry
for the next couple of days.
   NWA climbed 6{ to 114[ after a delayed opening. An investor group
led by Alfred Checchi of Los Angeles announced an agreement to
acquire NWA for $121 a share, apparently ending a bidding war among
several parties.
   The action in NWA stock helped most other airline issues gain
altitude as well. UAL rose 6{ to 128{ and Delta Air Lines was up 1[
at 68[.
   Time Inc. fell 5| to 156~, while Warner Communications rose ] to
59| as the most active NYSE issue. On Friday Time began a
$70-a-share offer for Warner after Paramount Communications
disrupted plans for a Time-Warner merger with a hostile bid for Time.
   Paramount shares gained 2] to 60{.
   Sea Containers Ltd. jumped 6~ to 72{. The company, which is
fighting a $50-a-share takeover bid by the European concerns Tiphook
and Stena, said it was working on a plan for a buyout or
restructuring.
   Federal National Mortgage, which said the interest-rate spread
that helps determine its profitability continue to improve in May,
rose 4 to 88~.
   As measured by Wilshire Associates' index of more than 5,000
actively traded stocks, the market increased $1.25 billion, or 0.04
percent, in value.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks gained
.20 to 179.79.
   Standard &amp; Poor's industrial index rose .38 to 368.12, and S&amp;P's
500-stock composite index was up .54 at 321.89.
   The NASDAQ composite index for the over-the-counter market
dropped 1.12 to 446.09. At the American Stock Exchange, the market
value index closed at 362.39, up .56.

<HEAD>Financial Concern To Restructure $955 Million in Debt</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By STEFAN FATSIS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Integrated Resources Inc., a troubled financial
services company, said Monday it plans to replace $955 million in
short-term debt with secured borrowings as part of a major corporate
overhaul.
   Integrated said it was putting up almost all of its $7.8 billion
in assets as collateral and sharply cutting back operations after it
moved last week to default on outstanding bonds and commercial paper
because of a cash shortage.
   ``They needed to establish working capital lines and it looks
like they've proposed a plan to do that,'' said Jan Konstanty,
associate director of Moody's Investors Service, which downgraded
Integrated's credit rating last week.
   Company president Arthur Goldberg said the company's problems do
not affect any of its 35 subsidiaries, which have about 750,000
investor accounts. Among its subsidiaries are Integrated Resources
Life Insurance Co. of Des Moines, Iowa, and Capitol Life Insurance
Co. of Denver.
   After meeting with creditors, the New York-based firm with
subsidiaries nationwide said holders of debt due within 45 days
would receive new, secured obligations payable in 18 months that can
be extended for six months if the company pays more than $200
million before the deadline.
   In addition, the 20-year-old firm that made its fortune in tax
shelters and then expanded into financial services said it would try
to sell some businesses in tax-sheltered annuities _ which had $160
million in sales last year _ direct life insurance and other
segments.
   It also said it plans to reduce operating expenses by $40 million
a year by slashing expenses, overhead and other unspecified budget
items. Integrated spokesman David Caouette declined to say whether
the plan involved layoffs.
   The company, which has $1.1 billion in capital, said in a
statement it would concentrate on its core businesses of money
management and mutual funds, variable insurance products and limited
partnerships.
   ``The steps we are proposing ... will help to provide Integrated
Resources with the financial strength and management focus to
continue its role as a major player in the financial services
industry,'' Goldberg said.
   Integrated said it would submit the proposal, drafted over the
weekend in meetings with its major commercial banks, to short-term
lenders and commercial paper holders.
   The company's stock, which sold for as much as $40 a share in
1986, dropped 37{ cents Monday to $6 a share on the New York Stock
Exchange. Shares have plunged from $15 in the last week.
   Last Wednesday, banks withdrew Integrated's access to short-term
credit markets amid signs of weakening financial conditions at the
firm.
   Integrated said it did not have the money to pay off its debt,
including some $373 million in commercial paper and loan shares due
within 45 days. The debt payments amount to about $8 million a day.
   Integrated also has $491 million in short-term bank credit lines,
mostly payable on demand.
   The debt to be restructured includes outstanding short-term bank
debt, domestic and European commercial paper and notes outstanding
under loan-sale programs, the company said.
   About 50 banks are providing short-term loans to Integrated and
the company said it has about 50 to 75 holders of commercial paper
and notes under loan-sale programs.
   Integrated said it would pledge ``substantially all'' of its
assets and non-operating subsidiaries as collateral. Secured notes
oustanding would be prepaid from some of Integrated's planned asset
sales.
   Goldberg said the company's problems do not affect any of its 35
subsidiaries, which have about 750,000 investor accounts. Among its
subsidiaries are Integrated Resources Life Insurance Co. of Des
Moines, Iowa, and Capitol Life Insurance Co. of Denver.

<HEAD>Corn Futures Soar The Limit On Dry Weather Outlook</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID DISHNEAU</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Most corn futures prices climbed the permitted daily limit of 10
cents a bushel Monday on the Chicago Board of Trade as an expected
heat wave that is reigniting drought fears moved into the Corn Belt.
   Other grain and soybean futures prices also rose.
   On other markets, livestock and meat futures rallied strongly;
precious metals gained; and energy futures were mostly higher.
   On the Board of Trade, corn settled 8} cents to 10 cents higher
with the contract for delivery in July at $2.72\ a bushel; wheat was
1 cent to 3 cents higher with July at $3.96{ a bushel; oats were 6}
cents to 7 cents higher with July at $1.71\ a bushel; soybeans were
14\ cents to 18 cents higher with July at $7.48{ a bushel.
   Forecasts for an extended period of hot, dry weather in the
Midwest were reinforced after the close of trading by a new
six-to-10-day outlook from the National Weather Service, which
predicted above-normal temperatures and below-normal rainfall for
the region from Sunday through June 29.
   The Corn Belt was already beginning to heat up on Monday, with
temperatures above 90 degrees reported at 2 p.m. CDT in western Iowa
and southwestern Minnesota.
   Despite more than a month of cool, rainy weather in the Corn
Belt, soil conditions remain dry in the region's western half.
   ``The eastern half, with the exception of parts of Illinois, is
soggy. They welcome this kind of weather,'' Ms. Zimmer said. ``But
Iowa still has a very substantial subsoil moisture problem. If you
shut off the rain, you're going to have a major problem.''
   Memories of last year's drought have not faded much among grain
futures traders, some of whom made huge profits from the rapid rise
in prices a year ago.
   ``People are hypersensitive after last year,'' said Victor
Lespinasse, a trader in Chicago with Dean Witter Reynolds Inc.
   Additional support for the corn market came from the Agriculture
Department's decision to extend the due date on certain 1985 corn
loans, keeping as much as 700 million bushels of corn off the market
for another six months.
   Gains in the wheat market were limited by selling linked to the
advancing winter wheat harvest.
   Live cattle led livestock and meat futures higher on the Chicago
Mercantile Exchange in reaction to Friday's USDA monthly
cattle-on-feed report, which showed a lower-than-expected number of
cattle placed on feedlots in May to be fattened for slaughter in the
seven largest producer states.
   Cattle placed on feedlots in May will reach slaughter weights by
fall.
   Pork futures prices rose in sympathy with the cattle market,
analysts said.
   Live cattle settled .82 cent to 1.37 cents higher with June at
72.97 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .30 cent to .85 cent higher
with August at 81.82 cents a pound; live hogs were .35 cent to 1.50
cents higher with June at 48.97 cents a pound; frozen pork bellies
were .75 cent to 1.45 cents higher with July at 34.70 cents a pound.
   Near-month deliveries of crude oil and refined products rose
sharply on the New York Mercantile Exchange on buying linked to the
expiration next week of the July gasoline and heating-oil contracts.
Analysts said there were few new supply-and-demand developments.
   West Texas Intermediate crude oil settled unchanged to 91 cents
higher with July at $20.86 a barrel; heating oil was .11 cent to .35
cent higher with July at 46.06 cents a gallon; unleaded gasoline was
.18 cent lower to .86 cent higher with July at 59 cents a gallon.
   Precious metals futures rose moderately on New York's Commodity
Exchange, partly on news that miners in Peru voted over the weekend
to begin an indefinite nationwide strike on Aug. 14. Peru is a major
producer of silver.
   Gold settled $1.80 to $2.20 higher with August at $370.60 a troy
ounce; silver was 3.5 cents to 3.8 cents higher with July at $5.34 a
troy ounce.

<HEAD>WPP Group Says 95 Percent of Ogilvy Shares Tendered by Deadline</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   WPP Group PLC said Monday that more than 95
percent of Ogilvy Group's shares were validly tendered under terms
of its $54-a-share buyout offer and that it intends to move quickly
to complete the largest acquisition ever in the advertising business.
   The deal would make London-based WPP second only to Saatchi &amp;
Saatchi PLC, also based in London, among the world's largest
advertising and marketing services concerns.
   WPP already owns the J. Walter Thompson ad agency, the Hill &amp;
Knowlton public relations firm and about three dozen marketing
services firms.
   The WPP and Ogilvy boards agreed on the buyout last month and
WPP's $54-a-share tender offer expired at 10 a.m. Monday.
   WPP said that its depositary for the offer, Citibank, said that
as of 6 a.m. Monday 13.8 million shares, or 95.2 percent, of
Ogilvy's 14.5 million shares were validly tendered and not withdrawn
as of that point.
   In addition, WPP beneficially owns an additional 585,000 Ogilvy
shares.
   The stock purchase would cost WPP about $783 million. The company
had previously said it valued the deal at $864 million, including
purchases of options, refinancing debt and other expenses.
   In either case, the purchase clearly exceeds the previous largest
in the ad business _ WPP's $566 million takeover of J. Walter
Thompson's parent in 1987.
   WPP said it intends to complete the merger of Ogilvy with one of
its subsidiaries as soon as practicable. In the merger, Ogilvy
shares that have not been tendered will be converted into the right
to receive $54 a share in cash.

<HEAD>Turner Hires Merrill Lynch To Help Sell Atlanta Office-Retail Complex</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Turner Broadcasting System has hired Merrill Lynch
Capital Markets in a revived effort to sell CNN Center, an
office-retail complex in downtown Atlanta that houses TBS
headquarters as well as the studios of Cable News Network.
   TBS spokeswoman Kitsie Bassett-Riggall said Merrill Lynch's New
York office is handling the search. She said other details, such as
the asking price and the timetable for the sale, were unavailable
Monday.
   Turner bought the complex in 1986 for $21.8 million and the
assumption of $45 million in debt. However, TBS Chairman Ted Turner
put it up for sale to help pay off the debt he incurred in his $1.5
billion purchase of the MGM film library that same year.
   Turner announced last November an agreement to sell CNN Center
for $170 million to 66 Properties Inc., a unit of The Herrick Co., a
Morristown, N.J.-based real estate investment firm. But that deal
fell through in January.
   That sale would have included CNN Center's two office towers,
80,000-square-foot retail plaza and 2,000-space parking building. It
excluded the Omni International Hotel and Turner's operating
agreement for The Omni coliseum.

<HEAD>Oil Prices Mostly Higher</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Energy futures prices finished mostly higher
Monday led by a surge in the July crude oil contract.
   On the New York Mercantile Exchange, West Texas Intermediate, the
benchmark grade of crude oil, finished 91 cents higher at $20.86
cents a barrel. The July contract had traded as low as $19.67 a
barrel, below Friday's $19.95 close.
   Analysts said investors were concerned about the direction of
crude prices before the last day of trading in July crude oil on
Tuesday.
   ``The expiration of the July contract produces some nervousness;
that brings in short-covering,'' said Richard Redoglio, energy
broker with Merrill Lynch Energy Futures.
   Crude contracts for delivery after July showed more modest gains.
The August crude oil contract rose 38 cents to $18.96 a barrel and
September gained 18 cents to $17.99.
   Among refined products, unleaded gasoline for July delivery rose
0.86 cent to settle at 59 cents a gallon. Other unleaded gasoline
contracts were mixed.
   Heating oil for delivery in July rose 0.35 cent to 46.06 cents a
gallon on low volume. Contracts for delivery later in the year also
rose.
   An attack on a major Colombian oil pipeline helped boost prices
slightly early in the day, but the effect was short-lived, observers
said.
   ``It had some psychological impact but since it's a sour crude,
it's hard to say how much of an impact it really had,'' said Randall
Rothenberg, a trader with Dean Witter Reynolds Inc.
   Analysts said that Colombia's state oil company, Ecopetrol, was
informing U.S. customers that deliveries would be disrupted for
several days while damage to the pipeline is repaired.

<TEXT>
   Colorado-Ute Electric Association has won
a three-week extension of a deadline for responding to an
involuntary Chapter 11 bankruptcy filing, a company spokesman said
Monday.
   John McNeill, general counsel for the Montrose-based
Colorado-Ute, said the U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Denver extended the
company's June 26 response deadline to July 17.
   Three commercial banks _ Manufacturers Hanover Trust Co., United
Bank of Denver and Norwest Bank Minneapolis _ each owed $10 million
by Colorado-Ute, filed the involuntary petition on June 5.
   The filing did not affect electric service to Colorado-Ute's
14-member rural electric cooperatives, which in turn, supply power
to 49 of the state's 63 counties.
   Colorado-Ute is $1.1 billion in debt and claims $887 million in
assets. It is trying to reach an agreement with its creditors to
avoid Chapter 11 proceedings.
   The U.S. Rural Electrification Administration, the largest
creditor owed more than $410 million, is trying to negotiate a
standstill agreement with Colorado-Ute.
   REA officials said a six-month standstill would be used to sell
all or part of Colorado-Ute, or merge the company with another
generation and transmission concern.

<HEAD>EEC Ministers Adopt Ban On Insider Trading</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LUXEMBOURG (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   EEC ministers Monday agreed to ban insider
trading on European stock exchanges over the next three years.
   The decision will require some of the 12 countries in the
European Economic Community, including Germany, Italy, Belgium and
Ireland, to tighten their rules regarding trading on insider
information.
   Insider trading is defined by the EEC as the use of privileged
information for personal gain. Privileged information is information
that has not been revealed to the public and could influence the
price of a stock if it were.
   Under the proposal, all EEC countries must enact measures
``sufficiently strong'' to prevent insider trading no later than
June 1, 1992.

<DATELINE>DALLAS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Sematech said Monday it has held preliminary talks
with European manufacturers on cooperation in research on
semiconductor manufacturing technology.
   ``Representatives of European integrated circuit companies
visited Sematech to discuss opportunities for cooperation between
Sematech and JESSI (Joint European Submicron Silicon),'' the U.S.
consortium said Monday in a prepared statement.
   ``It was agreed that any potential cooperation must be based on
reciprocity. It was also agreed that such cooperation is highly
desirable.
   ``A study group was set up to further define the areas where
common activities can substantially help in reaching mutual goals,''
the statement said.
   The meeting at Sematech's Austin headquarters occurred last
Friday and involved representatives of NV Philips, a Dutch company;
Siemens AG, West Germany and SGS-Thomson Microelectronics BV,
according to Sematech spokesman Miller Bonner.
   However Bonner noted that the three, while they account for the
bulk of the European industry, do not represent JESSI, which is
still in the formative stages.
   Bonner said the meeting grew out of contacts with potential JESSI
members who were seeking help in setting up a Sematech-like effort
to battle the Japanese for the $45 billion semiconductor industry.
   Sematech, an acronym for Semiconductor Manufacturing Technology,
was created last year with a goal of U.S. global leadership in the
semiconductor manufacturing technology by 1993.
   Although the Europeans in some ways are competing with the United
States for that leadership, Bonner said Sematech's focus on
manufacturing technology and not on the end-use of computer chips
means cooperation would not be inconsistent with Sematech's goal.
   ``If our goal is to retain world leadership in the semiconductor
manufacturing, clearly we have to take a very broad view of the best
way to accomplish this,'' Bonner said.
   But Bonner disputed a report in this week's issue of Business
Week magazine that the talks would lead to joint membership in both
consortia for the 14 U.S. companies and their European counterparts.
   ``That's a giant leap from what we talked about here on Friday,''
Bonner said. ``We're a long way from talking about joint membership.
There's one thing to discuss standards. It's quite another to talk
about joint membership.''
   Sematech's members include International Business Machines Corp.,
American Telephone &amp; Telegraph Co., NCR Corp., Texas Instruments
Inc., Digital Equipment Inc., Motorola Inc., Hewlett-Packard Co.,
and Intel Corp. The members fund half of Sematech's $200 million
annual budget with the Pentagon contributing the remainder.

<HEAD>Early Renewal Of Wage-Price Pact Expected To Bolster Mexico In Debt
Talks</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CHRIS ANGELO</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MEXICO CITY (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government is hoping early renewal of an
inflation-fighting pact will ease anxiety over prolonged foreign
debt negotiations and bolster its position in the talks.
   The latest extension of the pact, announced late Sunday, makes no
major changes in the one that expires July 31.
   Prices will be held at current levels and the one-peso-a-day
devaluation of the country's currency against the U.S. dollar will
be maintained, the pact says. It mentions no new minimum wage
increase.
   An agreement between the government and foreign commercial banks
on their share of the country's $107.4 billion foreign debt had been
expected before the renewal was announced. Analysts say investors
had become nervous over what both might contain, prompting the
government to keep domestic interest rates high to keep capital in
the country.
   ``The renewed pact strengthens Mexico's negotiating position'' on
foreign debt, Salinas said in a televised speech after the signing.
   Negotiations between representatives of the government and the
more than 500 foreign commercial creditor banks are under way in New
York. Private banks hold about 70 percent of the foreign debt.
   Unity among labor, private enterprise, the farm sector and the
government in bringing down inflation through the series of pacts
has won recognition from foreign governments and multilateral
lending agencies, Salinas said, and ``now opens a new space for us
to not accept under pressure just any arrangement, but on the
contrary to reach an adequate agreement.''
   Inflation was running at a record annual rate of 159 percent when
the first pact was signed in December 1987. The rate was 8 percent
for the first five months of this year and 18.5 percent for the 12
months ending in May. Reducing inflation further and gradually
renewing economic growth, stagnant from 1982 to 1988, remain the
pact's priorities, Salinas said.
   The International Monetary Fund and World Bank have granted
Mexico new loans totaling about $5.8 billion.
   Manuel Sanchez, director of the Center for Economic Research and
Analysis, a private think tank, said in an interview that short-term
anxiety will ease if investors see that the government is
negotiating a solid, long-term agreement on the debt. Continuing
structural changes, such as reducing its role in the economy and
holding down its own spending also will boost investor confidence,
he said.
   Salinas, who took office last Dec. 1, wants an agreement that
will cover the rest of his six-year term.
   Government officials have indicated they are holding out for a 55
percent reduction in principal on the loans held by private banks.
The banks are reported to have offered a 22 percent reduction on at
least part of the debt.

<HEAD>Union Members Reject National Steel Offer</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By EARL BOHN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>PITTSBURGH (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   United Steelworkers members rejected a 50-month
contract offer from National Steel Corp. that was patterned after an
agreement ratified at Bethlehem Steel Corp., union officials said
Monday.
   Union negotiator Buddy Davis said the nearly 7,000 members at
National's plants in Ecorse, Mich., Portage Ind., and Granite City,
Ill., apparently believed they could get better terms from the
nation's sixth-largest steelmaker.
   ``One of the problems with these early negotiations is that
people get to thinking, `Well, we don't have anything to lose so
let's send them back to get us some more.' Well, there isn't any
more. At least that's what I've been telling them,'' Davis said.
   Before the ballot had been finished at a Pittsburgh hotel, Davis
said, ``If it goes down, I'd say they're in trouble.''
   The vote was 3,239 to 2,054 to reject the restoration of previous
concessions and raise wages by $1.50 an hour over the life of the
contract. Like three other major producers, National faced a July 31
contract expiration.
   ``If the union members at our divisions voted against the
agreement because they believe National can afford to give more,
they're wrong,'' said Dick Coffee, chief negotiator for
Pittsburgh-based National.
   National is already one of the less profitable producers among
the major companies.
   The two sides opened negotiations early, and presumably will
return to bargaining after a cooling off period.
   Second-ranked Bethlehem won ratification of terms similar to
National's offer.
   Meanwhile, the union continues negotiations with Inland Steel
Industries Inc., although the Chicago company has been taking a
tough line, and union officials have been telling workers that
strike preparations have begun.
   Inland claims it is offering terms at least as good as
Bethlehem's. The union claims its workers deserve better from a
financially healthy company.
   The two sides bargained over the weekend and through the night
until 5 a.m. Monday in Chicago. The negotiators then recessed to
rest.
   Talks with Armco Inc. were scheduled to resume Tuesday but have
been postponed until after July 4 because of a shortage of hotel
rooms in Pittsburgh.

<HEAD>Two Natural Gas Pipe Companies Settle with SoCal Gas</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Two of several pipeline companies competing
for permission to build new natural gas lines to California agreed
Monday to coordinate their efforts.
   The deal must be weighed by both state and federal regulators,
who are considering several proposals for new natural gas pipelines
into California.
   The agreement is between pipeline builders Kern River Gas
Transmission Co. and Mojave Pipeline Co. and includes Southern
California Gas Co., the big utility.
   It calls for each pipeline company to build its own line to the
California desert city of Barstow, where the lines would merge and
continue to the oilfields of Kern County. There, the gas would be
burned to produce steam that is used to extract thick, tar-like oil
from the ground under the southern San Joaquin Valley.
   Kern River, a joint venture of Tenneco Inc. of Houston and
Williams Cos. of Tulsa, Okla., would bring natural gas from Opal,
Wyo. Mojave, owned by Houston-based Enron Corp. and El Paso Natural
Gas Co., a subsidiary of Burlington Resources, would bring gas from
Topock, Ariz.
   Any such pipeline into the state must be approved by the Federal
Energy Regulatory Commission, which has approved one similar
application and is considering another by the state's other big gas
utility, Pacific Gas &amp; Electric Co.
   Another competitor, the Wyoming-California Pipeline Co., has won
FERC approval for a line from Wyoming. That company, a subsidiary of
Coastal Corp. of Houston, hopes to break ground next year, but
hasn't signed enough customers to commit to construction, said
spokesman Jim Bailey.
   At least three other pipeline proposals have been floated _ two
involving gas from Canada and one from Mexico _ but those aren't
actively before regulators.

   Wendy's International Inc., the world's
third-largest hamburger restaurant chain, is suing the parent
company of Carl's Jr. restaurants and a Wendy's franchisee for $119
million over Carl's Jr.'s purchase of 10 Wendy's outlets in Arizona.
   The suit, filed Monday in U.S. District Court in Tucson, alleges
that Carl Karcher Enterprises breached ``contractual terms that are
the cornerstone of any franchise system'' when it bought the
Wendy's-franchised restaurants.
   The Dublin, Ohio-based plaintiff seeks $79 million in
compensatory, consequential and punitive damages and attorney's fees
from Carl Karcher Enterprises and $40 million from Ronald Brown, who
owns Wendy's of Tucson Inc.
   Brown sold individual Wendy's stores in Prescott and Flagstaff,
and eight in Tucson, to Carl Karcher Enterprises.
   The complaint claims that the purchase has deprived Wendy's of
current and future income from the 10 stores, pirated prime
locations and destroyed Wendy's market presence.
   The suit alleges that Wendy's had notified both Karcher
Enterprises and Brown that it would not consent to sale.
   Brown was out of town and could not be reached for comment, an
employee said.
   Carl's Jr. attorney Richard Ceilio said in a statement read over
the telephone from Anaheim, Calif., that he had not seen the
complaint but that based on Wendy's announcement his company
believed the suit was totally without merit.
   Carl's Jr. has 498 restaurants nationwide, while Wendy's operates
or franchises nearly 3,800 restaurants in the United States and
overseas.

   Owners of 30 U.S. plants acknowledge releasing
annually at least 1 million pounds each of chemicals suspected of
causing cancer, according to federal figures disclosed Monday by a
private group.
   The releases contribute to more than 2.7 billion pounds of toxic
chemicals that the Environmental Protection Agency says are put into
the air from industrial sources each year, including some 360
million pounds of suspected carcinogens.
   The finding, based on statistics provided by the industry on
releases in 1987, are the most detailed and most current breakdown
to date, EPA officials said.
   Charles Elkins, director of the EPA's toxics programs, said the
raw figures do not measure individuals' health risks because they do
not take into account exposure levels.
   Neither the EPA statistics nor the analysis by the private
environmental group, the Natural Resources Defense Council,
attempted to deal with the exposure question.
   But David Doniger, an attorney for the private group, which
released a plant-by-plant list, said, ``These pollutants have to be
considered dangerous at any level of exposure.''
   Doniger criticized the EPA for not having moved more swiftly to
regulate such chemical releases.
   A spokesman for one company cited, Boeing Military Airplanes of
Wichita, Kan., said the company uses trichloroethylene in solvents
for cleaning aircraft parts and to help prevent corrosion.
   ``Boeing is trying to develop substitutes,'' said Richard Hill,
adding that ``the emissions figure seems like a lot, but to put it
into perspective that total amount is spread out throughout the
course of a year. By the time the air leaves the plant grounds it is
diluted to the point the chemical is undetectable.''
   The findings mirror many of the conclusions reached earlier this
month by Rep. Henry Waxman, D-Calif., who said that data he had
obtained from the EPA indicated more than 200 industrial plants
across the country may be releasing chemicals that pose a severe
cancer risk.
   But Waxman's data from the EPA were for the early 1980s and were
largely based on ``rough working estimates'' and not widespread
reporting of actual releases, said EPA spokesman John Kasper.
   Meanwhile on Monday, the EPA announced the start of an
information system that shortly will allow citizens to more easily
learn what industrial chemicals they may be exposed to in their
areas.
   A computerized inventory showing releases of 328 chemicals by
20,000 plants and facilities nationwide will soon be available at
1,000 federal libraries and through many local library systems, said
EPA officials.
   The system will allow someone to find out in minutes what toxic
chemicals and volume of releases were reported to the EPA by plants
in the area.
   The NRDC analysis Monday was based on that toxic release
inventory, EPA officials said.
   But the environmental group focused on only 13 chemicals that the
EPA as far back as 1985 has classified as either being proven
carcinogens or strongly suspected of causing cancer.
   Only one of the chemicals is currently regulated as to releases
into the air and even in that case, benzene, releases are not
prohibited entirely.
   Officials said all the reported releases were legal.
   Among the findings of the NRDC in its analysis of the EPA's
statistics were:
   _ There are at least 1,600 industrial plants and facilities in 46
states that release significant amounts of suspected cancer-causing
chemicals into the air.
   _ Releases of 400,000 pounds or more were reported by 125 plants,
including 30 that reported 1 million pounds or more.
   _ The most widely polluted chemical among the 13 examined was
methylene chloride, a volatile cleaning solvent used as a metal
degreaser, paint remover and in aerosols. The EPA has classified it
as a ``probable human carcinogen.''
   According to the NRDC analysis, the largest polluter with a
single chemical on the list was the Eastman Kodak Co., in Rochester,
N.Y., which reported releasing nearly 9 million pounds of methylene
chloride in 1987.
   Other companies which reported emissions of more than 2.5 million
pounds were GE Plastics of Mount Vernon, Ind.; the Upjohn Co.,
Portage, Mich.; Eli Lilly &amp; Co., Clinton and Shadeland, Ind., and
Hadco Corp., Derry, N.H.
   All of those involved methylene chloride.
   The top polluter for each of the other 12 chemicals was:
Borg-Warner Chemical Inc., Washington, W.Va., acrylonitrile (1.14
million pounds); Texaco Chemical Co., Port Neches, Texas, 1,3
butadiene (960,000 pounds); Monsanto Co., Soda Spring, Idaho,
cadmium (100,250 pounds).
   Hercules Inc., Parlin, N.J., carbon tetrachloride (816,670
pounds); Westvaco, Bleached Board Div., Covington, Va., chloroform
(1.9 million pounds); Occidental Chemical, Castle Hayne, N.C.,
chromium (94,000 pounds); PPG Industries, Westlake, La., ethylene
dichloride (820,000 pounds).
   Shell Chemical, Geismar, La., ethylene oxide (594,000 pounds);
Aluminum Co. of America, Riverdale, Iowa, perchloroethylene (2.3
million pounds); Boeing Military Airplanes, Wichita, Kan.,
trichloroethylene (2.3 million pounds); Celanese Engineering Resin,
Nueces, Texas, formaldehyde (500,000 pounds); Inland Steel Corp.,
Lake, Ind., benzene (2.2 million pounds).

<HEAD>Ford To Increase Foreign Content in Large Cars to Meet Fuel Economy
Rule</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID GOODMAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>DETROIT (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Ford Motor Co. will increase the overseas content
of two large cars while putting more domestic parts in two small
vehicles to meet a more stringent federal fuel economy standard, an
official said Monday.
   As a result, the larger cars will be reclassified as imports in
federal fuel economy calculations while the smaller cars, now listed
as imports, will be counted as domestic.
   The reclassifications will be made despite the fact that the
large cars are assembled in Ontario _ not considered foreign for
car-classification purposes _ and that one of the small cars is made
in Mexico, said Joel Pitcoff of the automaker's research staff.
   Ford will reduce the share of North American-made components in
the Ford Crown Victoria and Mercury Grand Marquis from about 90
percent to just under 75 percent, Pitcoff said.
   The change, which will occur early in 1991, will be offset by an
increase in the North American content of the smaller Ford Probe and
Mercury Tracer so that both qualify as domestic vehicles _ even
though the Tracer is assembled in Mexico, Pitcoff said.
   ``The net domestic content of the four vehicles will be higher
than it is today,'' Pitcoff said. He said less than half of the
content of the two smaller models now comes from North American
sources.
   Ford is selling Crown Victorias and Grand Marquis at a rate of
225,000-250,000 a year, about the same as the total for the Probe
and Tracer, he said.
   Under a 1975 federal law, automakers will be required to have a
corporate average fuel economy of 27.5 miles per gallon for the 1990
model year. The Transportation Department now holds producers to a
26.5 mpg standard.
   The so-called CAFE standard has different requirements for
domestically made cars _ those with at least 75 percent North
American content _ and cars imported under the company's name plates
with fewer than 75 percent North American parts.
   Ford now barely meets the fuel economy standard for domestically
made cars with a 26.6 mpg average but safely exceeds it for imports
at about 32 mpg, Pitcoff said.
   A United Auto Workers spokesman at the union's convention in
Anaheim, Calif., criticized Ford's moves.
   ``The UAW continues to be concerned about jobs for U.S.
workers,'' said the spokesman, who spoke on the condition of
anonymity. ``Domestic manufacturers have trouble meeting CAFE
standards because they import far too many small cars. Now they
propose to import big cars as well.
   ``We are concerned that this will further erode the jobs of our
members.''
   The next generation of the Crown Victoria and Grand Marquis is
scheduled to go into production in early 1991 in St. Thomas,
Ontario. The Probe is built for Ford by Mazda Motor Corp. at its
Flat Rock plant south of Detroit, while the Tracer is assembled in
Hermosillo, Mexico.
   Sales leader General Motors Corp., like No. 2 Ford, is struggling
to comply with current fuel economy standards and says it will have
trouble meeting the higher 1990 standard. No. 3 Chrysler Corp. sells
fewer large, fuel-hungry cars and hasn't faced any difficulty
meeting the CAFE limits.

   Newly elected House Majority Leader
Richard Gephardt on Monday ticked off a campaign-style list of
things wrong with the United States and asked the United Auto
Workers union to help him set things straight.
   Gephardt, making his first major speech since taking the House
Democratic leadership position two weeks ago, told delegates to a
UAW convention that the Bush administration has ``made some good
sounds on trade.''
   ``It remains to be seen if they are tough,'' he added. ``If not,
we're going to have the Gephardt amendment or something like it.''
   The congressman from Missouri based a large part of his
unsuccessful presidential campaign last year on trade issues. The
legislation he proposed in Congress would have forced the president
to take action against countries that traded unfairly with the
United States.
   ``You cannot compete against unfair competition,'' he said to
applause from a crowd of about 2,000 UAW members.
   In an address sounding much like a political stump speech,
Gephardt criticized the Bush administration, saying the nation
needed a comprehensive energy policy and to divert spending from
military hardware to education and the fight against drugs.
   ``This is our time ... to make America great and good and strong
again,'' he said.
   Earlier Monday, a UAW dissident movement was dealt its second
blow in two days when convention delegates rejected efforts which
would have required direct election of national union officers.
   The ``one-man, one-vote'' issue came up in 30 resolutions
submitted to the convention. They were lumped together and turned
down in a show-of-hands vote.
   The convention's constitution committee recommended rejection of
the move to referendum voting for national officers.
   ``A referendum is only the outer shell of democracy,'' Jim McNeil
of Local 600 in Dearborn, Mich., said in reading the committee's
report.
   ``The convention system delivers the substance,'' he said.
   The UAW membership elects its officers through delegates to the
convention every three years. This year's elections are scheduled
for Wednesday, and President Owen Bieber is facing no oppositon.
   The New Directions dissident movement, led by Jerry Tucker of St.
Louis, has complained among other things that the union has lost its
democratic roots.
   Dan Mallett, a delegate from Local 31 in Fairfax, Kan., said a
referendum method would make the union's leadership more accountable
to the membership.
   ``They pay their union dues, they deserve the right to vote,'' he
said.
   But his arguments and those of others failed to persuade enough
delegates to pass the resolution.
   It was the second defeat for Tucker and his forces in as many
days. On Sunday, the convention's opening day, New Directions
backers lost a battle over seating some delegations. At that time,
Tucker said there would be other challenges from his camp during the
week-long convention.
   Before the debate on the referendum issue, former Rep. Barbara
Jordan of Texas praised the union and its leadership. Her remarks
were framed in references to recent events in China in which a
pro-democracy student demonstration was put down forcefully.
   ``You in the United Auto Workers have a responsibility to explain
democracy of the rest of the world,'' she said, ``because you are a
microcosm of democracy.''

<HEAD>Airline Announces Contract For 50,000 Computer Terminals</HEAD>
<DATELINE>FORT WORTH (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   American Airlines Inc. announced Monday it had
chosen three vendors _ AT&amp;T, IBM and Tandy Corp. _ to supply as many
as 50,000 workstation computers for its reservation and travel agent
systems.
   The models are based on the Intel 386 microprocessor chip and
will be installed over the next two years.
   Terms of the contract were not disclosed.
   American Telephone &amp; Telegraph Co. said its portion of the
contract was the largest-ever it has received for workstations. The
company declined to give the value of its contract or the number of
units.
   The workstations will be installed in American Airlines domestic
reservations centers and in travel agencies that use the American's
SABRE Travel Information Network, American said.
   The SABRE system allows travel agents to book airline, hotel, car
and other travel-related reservations from workstations located in
their offices.
   American said it anticipates purchasing more than 50,000
workstations based on Intel's 386 microprocessor. The new chip
permits faster processing and greater memory capacity than the model
286 chip now in use.
   The workstations, which will be installed over the next two
years, will be interchangeable, the airline said.
   AT&amp;T's workstations are expected to be used primarily by SABRE
customers. Those from International Business Machines Corp. are
planned for use in American domestic reservations offices and for
SABRE customers, and Tandy's workstations are geared for domestic
airport terminals and certain maintenance locations.
   Allocation wasn't announced, but American said any one vendor's
share would be at least 10 percent.

   Two former top officials of defunct FirstSouth
Savings and Loan of Pine Bluff were indicted Monday on federal
charges of fraudulent management and conspiracy.
   Howard J. Wiechern Jr., former chairman of the board and chief
executive officer, and Roderick D. Reed III, former president and
chief operating officer, are accused of concealing information from
the Federal Home Loan Bank Board, falsifying entries in FirstSouth
records, and misapplying funds.
   U.S. Attorney Chuck Banks said the investigation was continuing
and that additional indictments were possible.
   The Federal Home Loan Bank Board took control of FirstSouth on
Dec. 5, 1986, in what at the time was the largest S&amp;L failure in
U.S. history.
   A 1985 proxy statement listed the thrift's three largest
stockholders as George S. Watson of Dallas, A. Starke Taylor III of
Dallas and Jerry L. Grigsby of Malvern.
   Two of the indictment's five counts charge that Wiechern and Reed
conspired to conceal from federal regulators and FirstSouth
shareholders and directors a secret agreement not to pursue the
guarantees securing loans made to Watson and Taylor for the Watson
and Taylor Realty Co. in Dallas.
   The indictment alleges the loans were then listed as income on
FirstSouth records to avoid showing a major decline in earnings for
the fiscal year ending June 30, 1985.
   The third count alleges Reed made three loans in excess of $20
million to Grigsby in violation of federal regulatory requirements,
without board approval and for purposes other than what was stated
in FirstSouth records.
   Reed also is charged in the fourth count with making loans
totaling nearing $33 million to Watson and Taylor Realty Co., also
in violation of federal regulatory policies.
   The fifth count names Wiechern and Reed, alleging they granted a
$5.2 million loan to Watson and Taylor Realty Co. in defiance of
instructions by the Federal Home Loan Bank Board and after
permission for the loan was denied by FirstSouth's directors.
   Neither Wiechern nor Reed could be reached for comment. The
housekeeper who answered the phone at Wiechern's Pine Bluff home
said he was out of town. Reed's home telephone was answered by a
woman who identified herself as his babysitter and said he was not
home.
   A man who answered the phone at the Watson and Taylor Realty Co.
said everyone had left for the day. A woman who answered the phone
at Grigsby's house said he was not home.
   Banks said Wiechern and Reed would be arraigned next week.
   Each count carries a maximum penalty of five years in prison and
fines ranging from $5,000 to $10,000.

   Wildcat strikes hit coal fields in four
more states Monday, keeping a third of the nation's union miners out
of work despite a back-to-work request by United Mine Workers
leadership.
   But Monday night, a judge deprived the wildcat strikers of a
major reason for their walkout by releasing three union leaders
who'd been jailed for encouraging miners to violate a court order
against blocking mine entrances in Virginia.
   U.S. District Judge Glen Williams' order could end the wildcat
strikes that have spread to nine states, said Chuck Donnelly, an
attorney for the United Mine Workers.
   Marty Hudson, the primary strike coordinator from Washington;
Jackie Stump, president of the UMW's southwest Virginia district;
and C.A. Phillips, a UMW international representative, left the
Roanoke, Va., jail.
   ``It sounds like a cause for celebration,'' Donnelly said.
   UMW vice president Cecil Roberts said earlier Monday that
telegrams were sent to the sympathy strikers, asking them to return
to work in accordance with a national contract forbidding such a
walkout.
   ``Telegrams have gone out,'' said Roberts, breaking the union's
long silence on the impromptu strikes that have shut down more than
300 mines. ``I'm sure that that has taken place throughout the
union.''
   Despite the request, mines in Alabama, Illinois, Missouri and
Ohio were hit Monday for the first time, bringing out 5,000 more
United Mine Workers members in a sympathy walkout for striking
Pittston Coal Group employees.
   That brought to more than 27,000 the number of miners on strike
against coal operators in nine states, not including the 1,800
picketing Pittston in a contract dispute. The UMW has about 80,000
active members nationwide.
   Roberts said the telegrams were sent because the miners are
violating a national contract signed by UMW members. He said the
union must enforce that pact.
   ``It's a serious situation,'' said Jeffrey W. Weber, a spokesman
for AMAX Coal Co.'s mine in Keensburg, Ill., where 655 miners joined
the walkout Monday. ``If you look at the big picture, it's very
counterproductive to the future of these miners.''
   As has been the case with previous walkouts, the UMW gave
companies no official reason for the wildcat strikes, but most
presumed they were related to the Pittston.
   Roberts said Monday in an interview from Tazewell, Va., that the
union presumed the same.
   ``It's just speculation on our part as to why they're out, but
people from the field are very upset on fines that have been
assessed against the union'' for civil disobedience in the Pittston
strike, Roberts said.
   ``Our position has been that we have no difference with the
UMW,'' said James Strickland, the director of public affairs for
Drummond Coal Co. in Jasper, Ala., where all 1,900 union miners
walked out Monday.
   ``We have no word from the union as to what they're up to,'' he
said.
   Virginia was taken off the wildcat list Monday when 794 Island
Creek Coal Co. employees returned to work at mines in Buchanan
County. They had been out since Thursday.
   ``We're back in full swing,'' said Island Creek spokesman Noel
Jones.
   Despite the wildcat strike's end in Virginia, other industry
officials pointed to the new walkouts and said there was no way to
expect an end to the strike.
   ``I think that's pretty unpredictable,'' said Steve Anderson, a
spokesman for Westmoreland Coal Co., which had 850 workers out last
week but only 100 _ all in West Virginia _ on picket lines Monday.
   ``When you consider the expansion over the weekend, I find it
hard to believe (that it's ending).''
   The unauthorized walkouts began last week after a UMW rally in
Charleston to protest Pittston's failure to sign a nationwide
contract and to protest fines and jail terms assessed against union
members in Virginia.
   Pittston wants its own contract that would include mandatory
overtime, Sunday work and a cut in pension benefits. The UMW insists
that the company sign the national contract, which would require
Pittston to pay into the national pension fund and keep mines closed
on Sundays.
   About 1,600 UMW employees walked off their Pittston jobs in
Virginia and West Virginia on April 5 after working more than 14
months without a contract. The strike spread to Pittston's Kentucky
operations Monday, idling an additional 200 UMW members.
   Pittston last week declared negotiations at an impasse, which
allowed it to implement its latest contract offer. UMW leaders are
required by law to present that offer to their membership.
   Eight people were arrested Monday in Alexandria, Va., after
sympathizers of the striking miners snarled commuter traffic headed
into the nation's capital, where the UMW is based. The protesters
allegedly traveled two or three cars abreast at speeds of 5 mph on
highways heading into Washington from northern Virginia, according
to Virginia State Police spokeswoman Lucy Caldwell.
   Police spotted about 100 sympathizers, most of whom had signs in
their car windows or displayed UMW flags on their radio antennas,
Caldwell said.
   The more than 27,000 miners off work Monday included 16,000 in
West Virginia; 3,900 in Alabama; 2,500 in Pennsylvania; 1,750 in
Indiana; 1,270 in Kentucky; 1,100 in Ohio; 650 in Illinois; 338 in
Missouri, and 200 in Tennessee.

   Northwest Airlines' parent, NWA Inc., accepted
a $4 billion buyout offer Monday from a group led by Los Angeles
investor Alfred Checchi, capping a weeks-long bidding war and taking
further steps to keep other bidders from returning.
   The Checchi group, which agreed to pay $121 a share for the
parent of the nation's fourth-largest airline, said it planned to
retain current management and believed it could win needed federal
approval of the sale.
   NWA announced that if its deal fell through with the Checchi
group _ which included KLM Royal Dutch Airlines and the Australian
conglomerate Elders IXL _ it would undertake a recapitalization that
would pay NWA shareholders a special $70 a share cash dividend.
   Analysts said such a recapitalization _ which would load NWA up
with new debt and possibly place a big stock holding into friendly
hands _ would make the company much less attractive to hostile
suitors.
   NWA stock soared $6.50 a share to $114.12{ on the New York Stock
Exchange.
   The Checchi group, Wings Holdings Inc., beat at least three other
bidders: rival airline Pan Am Corp.; the International Association
of Machinists, which represents about 20,000 of Northwest's 37,000
workers; and oil billionaire Marvin Davis, who sparked the bidding
with a $90 a share offer on March 28.
   Davis, who owns 2.9 percent of NWA's common shares, said in a
statement that he supports the proposed transaction, but will
reserve final judgement until he meets with his advisers.
   ``While disappointed by the outcome, I am pleased that the NWA
special committee has elected to sell the company as we urged all
along,'' Davis said.
   Pan Am issued a statement saying it was disappointed its bid was
not chosen, but that it wanted its offer to be considered if the
Checchi bid fell through _ and before NWA undertook its
recapitalization plan.
   The Machinists' union did not return repeated phone calls seeking
comment.
   Checchi, 41, a former Marriott Corp. treasurer, said he signed an
agreement with the NWA board about 1 a.m. Monday in a New York City
law office.
   Northwest said the Checchi bid was the highest offer it received,
had the fewest contingencies and was the most likely to close.
   Checchi said none of his associates would join Northwest's
management team and he expected NWA Chairman Steven Rothmeier to
keep running the company.
   ``I talked to Steve last night and we mutually congratulated each
other,'' Checchi said Monday. ``I certainly hope he plans on
staying. I have no reason to believe he is not.''
   Checchi's proposal includes $700 million equity and $3.35 billion
to be borrowed from a syndicate of banks led by Bankers Trust Co.
Checchi's equity partners include KLM, Bankers Trust; Richard C.
Blum and Associates, a San Francisco merchant banking and investment
firm; and Elders Finance Group, a subsidiary of Elders IXL.
   With about 30.5 million common shares outstanding, the tender
offer would cost about $3.7 billion, but Checchi's group already
owns 4.9 percent of NWA stock. The buyers also are contributing
equity that boosts the total package to over $4 billion.
   The buyout was conditioned on a majority of NWA's shares being
purchased and the deal being completed by Sept. 18.
   Checchi said he was not concerned about meeting financial fitness
requirements of the U.S. Transportation Department, which must
approve the acquisition.
   The Justice Department is not likely to review the deal because
it does not involve a merger of two airlines, a department spokesman
said.
   Federal regulations prohibit foreign carriers such as KLM from
owning more than 25 percent of a U.S. carrier.
   However, KLM and Northwest could share gates and coordinate
schedules for connecting flights, said Barbara Beyer of Avmark Inc.,
an aviation consulting firm in Arlington, Va. Such an arrangement
would not require any merger of employees or corporate staff, she
said.
   Checchi said his plan calls for ``substantial growth'' at
Northwest, including the purchase of 138 new planes already on order
or option by NWA.
   William Genoese, president of the airline division of the
International Brotherhood of Teamsters, said he would meet with
Checchi's group later this week.
   ``They want the company to grow,'' said Genoese, whose union
represents about 7,000 flight attendants and clerks at Northwest.
``I'm for anyone that comes in that will make things grow and
improve labor relations.''
   NWA said its recapitalization plan would pay shareholders $70
cash per share, which would cost about $2.1 billion. The plan might
be financed partly with an equity contribution from a third party,
NWA said, which would determine how much the company would have to
borrow to pay for the recapitalization.
   Kurt Rivard, an analyst for Dain Bosworth Inc. of Minneapolis,
said new debt the recapitalization would load on NWA could
discourage a hostile bidder from trying to circumvent the Checchi
deal.
   Monday's decision capped a bidding war opened March 28 by Davis,
who offered $2.7 billion, or $90 a share.
   The board rejected Davis' bid and his subsequent tender offer for
the same amount. It then opened a two-phase bidding process that
attracted other suitors such as Pan Am.
   However, NWA's board rejected the first round of bids as
inadequate and invited suitors to try again.
