   Two American missionaries who were
abducted from a religious retreat two months ago, apparently by drug
traffickers, were released unharmed, police and family members said
Monday.
   Roy Libby, of Portland, Ore., and Richard Grover, of Warroad,
Minn., were kidnapped January 3 by an armed group near the
municipality of Florida in the department of El Valle, 180 miles
southwest of Bogota. They were participating in a meeting of the
Evangelical Missionary Union.
   Libby and Grover were released unharmed Sunday night near Florida
and flew immediately to Ecuador to meet with their families, said
Hector Pardo, president of the Evangelical Confederation.
   The missionaries ``were well treated by their captors. They were
released unharmed and there was not paid any ransom money,'' Pardo
said.
   Grover's mother, Helen Grover, said Monday night from her home in
Warroad that her son had called from Quito, Ecuador, Monday
afternoon.
   ``He told about how they were released,'' she said. ``They walked
out. One of the captors walked with them for an hour and a half,
then they walked an hour and a half more before they waved at a car
and the car stopped and picked them up and took them to a little
town.''
   She said her son told her he did not know who his captors were.
``He said he knew they were a subversive group,'' she said. ``He was
never told why they took them or why they released them.''
   She said Grover told her they were ``treated very well.''
   Radio stations on Monday received a statement signed by ``The
Extraditables,'' a gang of drug traffickers, saying Libby and Grover
were ``tried'' under suspicions they were working for the U.S. Drug
Enforcement Administration.
   The statement said the missionaries were released after their
kidnappers established they had no links to the DEA.
   ``The Extraditables'' has been accused of killing Colombia's
justice minister, Rodrigo Lara Bonilla, and attorney general, Carlos
Mauro Hoyos, after the officials authorized the extradition of some
important cocaine dealers.

   Two men of Mideastern appearance were seen in
the neighborhood of the commander of the USS Vincennes in the weeks
before the Navy captain's van was destroyed by a bomb, a law
enforcement official said Monday.
   Sharon Rogers, wife of Capt. Will Rogers III was alone in the van
when the bomb detonated Friday while she drove alone to work. She
got out of the van moments before it caught fire and was not injured.
   Rogers gave permission last summer to shoot down a plane over the
Persian Gulf that was presumed from radar data to be a fighter, but
actually was an Iranian civilian passenger jet.
   The official, who disclosed the information on condition of
anonymity, said it was not clear if investigators had been able to
piece together detailed descriptions of the two men. The information
was based on interviews with neighbors, the official said.
   The official spoke after a report in Monday's New York Times that
one man of Middle Eastern appearance had asked passers-by: ``Where
does the captain live?''
   FBI spokesman Gary Laturno said he could neither confirm nor deny
the report.
   Investigators, however, were beginning to move away from their
suspicions that the bombing was directed from abroad by
international terrorists, The Times reported in Tuesday' editions.
   Sources told The Associated Press that based on intelligence
information and initial reports from investigators, the explosive
device was believed to be very crude and not of the quality that
would be expected from prominent Iranian-supported terrorist groups.
   Last week, Oliver ``Buck'' Revell, a top FBI official, testified
before Congress about the potential terrorist threat posed by
Iranian students in the United States. He cited the San Diego region
as one area where there was a high number of students.
   But the sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity, cautioned
against drawing the inference that students were behind the Rogers
bombing.
   The FBI said it was chasing hundreds of leads as it tried to
determine if the bombing was a terrorist act in retaliation for the
shooting down of the airliner. All 290 people aboard the airliner
were killed.
   There has been no claim of responsibility for the bombing.
   Rogers and his wife remained at an undisclosed location Monday
under the protection of Naval Investigative Service agents.
Officials at the school where Mrs. Rogers teaches said they do not
expect her to return to work this week.
   The FBI, which is coordinating the investigation, has made a
public appeal asking for calls from anyone who may have seen
something suspicious before, during or after the blast.
   The FBI has described the bomb as ``an improvised explosive
device'' rather than a manufactured military device. Types of such
devices include pipe bombs.
   Investigators with the San Diego Fire Department and the Metro
Arson Strike Team concluded on the day of the blast that the
explosion was caused by a pipe bomb. The FBI then assumed primary
jurisdiction of the investigation.
   Meanwhile, Navy officials said Monday that enhanced security at
Navy installations in the San Diego area would remain in effect
until the FBI concludes its investigation of the bombing.
   ``There's been no change in our security posture since it was
increased Friday,'' said Chief Petty Officer Craig Huebler, a
spokesman at the San Diego Naval Base. ``There'll be no change until
the FBI can complete its work and report back on what we are dealing
with.''

<HEAD>Adult Bookstores Across From FBI Shut Down</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A company which operates adult bookstores
across the street from FBI headquarters pleaded guilty Monday to
federal racketeering charges, ending a two-year investigation, the
Justice Department said.
   FBI agents entered the stores and found videotapes with titles
such as ``Traci's Big Trick,'' ``His to Command,'' and ``Bound and
Punished,'' according to court documents.
   The plea agreement was outlined in U.S. District Court.
   The agreement provides that the two stores directly across the
street from the J. Edgar Hoover building will be closed immediately,
while two others located just down the street will be shut down
later.
   The case is the first obscenity prosecution in the federal court
in the district in 26 years and is only the second time the federal
racketeering law was used in an obscenity case since Congress placed
obscenity violations under that law in 1984, according to Assistant
Attorney General S.G. Dennis Jr.
   Automatic Enterprises Inc., the owner of the bookstores, was
fined $150,000 as part of the settlement.

   Authorities worked Sunday to identify
three young men who were shot to death before their bodies turned up
in a sinkhole, the sheriff said.
   The bodies were discovered Friday in the small sinkhole known as
Moody cave, which is about five miles northeast of this northern
Florida town near the Gulf Coast, said Wakulla County Sheriff David
Harvey.
   Harvey said two of the victims were 15 or 16 years old, and the
third was about 18 to 20.
   Autopsies indicated the three shooting victims had been dead five
to 10 hours, he said.
   Cave divers found the first body on a ledge, and deputies found
the others in the water, the sheriff said.
   ``Right now we have a forensic artist making up sketches,''
Harvey said. ``And our crime people are still out working the site.
That's about all I can say.''
   Sinkholes in Florida are saucer-shaped depressions produced when
limestone or other underlying material collapses.

   With only 357 miles left, the leaders in
the Iditarod Trail Sled Dog Race turned toward Alaska's windblown
coast Sunday.
   Three-time Iditarod champion Susan Butcher left this Yukon River
village at 6:55 p.m. AST, with veteran musher Martin Buser one
minute behind her.
   Joe Runyan, driving 17 dogs, had led the pack of five leaders
into Kaltag earlier in the day. Buser arrived about an hour later,
crouching on the back of his sled, brushing his teeth.
   He was followed into the village seven minutes later by Butcher,
who drove her team up the Yukon River, loudly singing a pop tune.
   From Kaltag, the mushers race toward the coastal village of
Unalakleet, 93 miles away and the longest stretch between
checkpoints in the race. From there, they sprint toward the $250,000
jackpoint waiting at the finish line on Nome's historic Front Street.
   The musher who finishes first wins $50,000; the rest is shared
among the next 19 finishers.
   The leaders _ Butcher, Buser, Runyan, DeeDee Jonrowe and
four-time champion Rick Swenson _ have been out front of the pack
since they left the gold mining ghost town of Iditarod, the half-way
point 558 miles into the race.
   Forty-one mushers remain in the 1,168-mile contest, the lowest
number since 1985. Eight have scratched since the race started March
3 in Anchorage.

   British army specialists on
Sunday defused a 1,500-pound bomb found in a van parked outside a
military base, police reported.
   The outlawed Irish Republican Army issused a statement asserting
responsibility for the attempted bombing of the army-police base at
Castlederg, 68 miles west of Belfast and less than 3 miles from the
border with the Irish Republic.
   An army bomb-disposal team took nearly 12 hours to defuse the
huge device, according to police. They said the explosives were
packed in the vehicle that had been reported stolen in Dublin nine
months ago.
   A police station said the terrorists had ``shown little regard
for lives of the local people.''
   The predominantly Roman Catholic IRA is fighting to unite
Northern Ireland, a British province where Protestants outnumber
Catholics 3-2, with the mainly Catholic Republic of Ireland.

<HEAD>Bush's Backing for New Debt Plan Muted</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SUSANNE M. SCHAFER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President's Bush's backers have been eager to
point to his administration's new plan for easing the Third World
debt crisis as evidence to counter his new team's go-slow image.
   Yet despite such promotion, the White House has yet to announce
that the president himself has given final approval to the plan.
   Asked about the president's involvement in the debt plan, White
House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said Friday that Bush ``has not
made final judgments on changes in the policy.''
   Recent debt-related riots in Venezuela that claimed 300 lives
have increased pressure for a new approach to the $410 billion in
debt run up by that country and other strategically key Latin
American nations including Mexico and Brazil.
   Belt-tightening attempts by nations strapped with the
international debt have forced governments to cut salaries and
subsidies, in many cases leading to sharply reduced standards of
living.
   The Bush administration plan, introduced on Friday by Treasury
Secretary Nicholas Brady, has received generally favorable reviews
both at home and abroad. It moves from past policy by urging
commercial banks to forgive part of the stifling debt owed by Third
World nations. The Reagan administration had favored new lending
instead of debt forgiveness.
   Rep. James Leach of Iowa, a Republican member of the House
Banking and Foreign Affairs committees, said the proposal ``makes
mincemeat of the gossip of the week _ that the administration has no
guiding vision.''
   ``The fact of the matter is that our new president has inherited
a rather barren plate from his predecessor,'' Leach said. ``A
domestic and international financial crisis has been in the making
for some time; it has fallen on the Bush administration to act.''
   Leach also cited the administration's savings and loan rescue
plan as evidence that Bush is moving swiftly on financial matters.
   But caution remained the watchword at the White House, where
Fitzwater said the president ``has not made any final judgments.''
   He said it is proper for such ideas first to be ``discussed in
speeches and so forth by the various agencies and administrators.''
   Another White House official, speaking on condition of anonymity,
said over the weekend that Fitzwater's comments still stood.
   ``It's true; it hasn't gone formally to the president. But that
doesn't mean he isn't backing Brady all the way. The ideas Brady
discussed are definitely the way the administration is going.''
   Since ``all the ribbons and the bows hadn't been tied'' by all of
the bureaucrats involved, Bush's name wasn't formally placed on the
plan, the official said.

   Some senior federal judges think the taxpayers
are getting a bargain from the semi-retired jurists even though
dozens accept pay raises after they stop all judicial work.
   But other senior judges are concerned _ even angry _ that
colleagues take pay boosts without working. A third group is
satisfied with current pay levels for semi-retired judges but
believes that younger, full-time judges deserve more money.
   An Associated Press survey, conducted in February and March, of
the nation's 277 senior federal judges found that 48, or 17 percent,
no longer do any judicial work. Nevertheless, they remain eligible _
and in most cases, eager _ for any pay raises granted to active
judges. The survey was undertaken because the government refuses to
release its own data on the workload of individual senior judges.
   The AP found most judges reduce their workload when they take
senior status; many give up criminal cases; some drop complicated
civil cases. Nevertheless, they handle 10 to 15 percent of the total
federal court workload, which is considered a godsend by their 750
active colleagues.
   ``You can't make a judge work if he doesn't want to work,'' said
Bailey Aldrich, at age 81 a working senior appeals court judge in
Massachusetts.
   ``I wrote a letter to a congressman that getting the senior judge
a raise, even though he wasn't working anymore, was a small price to
pay to get rid of ... (active judges) who are old.''
   Congress created senior status in 1919 to encourage older judges
with life appointments to step aside for younger replacements.
   Federal judges of a certain age and experience may take senior
status which allows them to decide how much work they do.
   Those who instead choose full retirement through resignation keep
for life the same salary they had on their last day of work. There
are only 13 of these.
   In February, senior judges and their active colleagues were
denied a 50 percent pay raise when Congress rejected increases for
top officials across the government.
   Two new bills in Congress would add 20 to 30 percent to judicial
salaries. Trial judges are paid $89,500 a year, and appellate judges
earn more _ up to $115,000 for the chief justice.
   The AP survey found no senior judge who has stopped hearing cases
and was willing to forgo any pay raise. Ronald Davies, an
84-year-old senior trial judge in North Dakota, was typical of most
who addressed the issue:
   ``I'm a senior judge and I get paid whether I work or not. I felt
it (the raise Congress rejected) was long overdue.'' Davies, who
took senior status in 1971 and stopped hearing cases altogether six
months ago, planned to accept that raise.
   But some still-working senior judges felt differently.
   ``If you don't want to do the work, retire and get out,'' said
Raymond J. Pettine, a 76-year-old trial judge in Rhode Island who
has maintained a full caseload since taking senior status in 1982.
   ``I think there probably should be some requirement that they
work to a certain extent,'' said John Minor Wisdom, a fabled New
Orleans judge who at 83 worked on appeals courts in four states last
year.
   John T. Elfvin, 71, a senior trial judge in Buffalo, N.Y., who
handles about 66 percent of a normal caseload, said, ``There ought
to be a look taken at individual situations. At some point, a judge
should be cut off from getting senior status.''
   Other senior judges endorsed raises for active judges to attract
qualified younger lawyers in an era of soaring salaries for private
attorneys, but were content with their own salaries.
   ``The job is worth the money, the $135,000 (which Congress
rejected), for an active judge,'' said Eugene R. Gordon, a senior
trial judge in North Carolina, who at 71 carries a 50 percent
workload. ``For what you're paying me on senior status, $89,500,
it's fine, but we are going to have to raise the salaries to attract
good people.''
   The AP reported in January that a previously undisclosed 1987
federal court study showed 20 percent of senior judges did no
judicial work. That study tracked trials and cases completed during
12 months, but identified the judges only by code number.
   The AP survey, which found that 17 percent do no judicial work,
unlike the 1987 study, gave judges credit for dormant, but
unresolved cases even though they have not required recent judicial
action.
   The non-working senior judges include such famous figures as
retired Chief Justice Warren E. Burger and Watergate trial judge
John J. Sirica.
   Of the 48, Sirica and 19 others suffer from serious health
problems that either limit or preclude continued judicial work.
   Others devote their energies to pursuits away from the
courthouse, ranging from managing their investments to serving full
time on public commissions, like Burger who heads the bicentennial
celebrations for the Constitution and Bill of Rights.
   But there are senior judges who stay with court work, or try to,
despite enormous obstacles.
   In North Carolina, 75-year-old senior trial judge Woodrow Jones
maintained a 75 percent caseload until his larynx was removed last
October. Unable to speak, he still works on petitions and motions
that can be handled with written orders.
   In Baltimore, 88-year-old former chief trial judge Roszel C.
Thomsen was forced by failing hearing to give up cases, but he comes
to the courthouse every day to serve as consultant or researcher for
other judges.
   The mixed feelings about pay raises were summed up by Frank M.
Coffin, an appeals court judge in Portland, Me., who took senior
status last month:
   ``At age 88, they become sick and they can't judge any more. Are
they to be deprived at the end of their life of a small increment
that is probably the only thing that can be added to their estate?
That's the most sympathetic case,'' Coffin said.
   ``The least sympathetic case is the senior judge who at a very
early age decides not to hear cases and takes senior status. I would
not object to taking a hard look at that situation.''

<TEXT>
   Senate members are in the position of two
brothers who, badly bruised after an unwanted fight, need to put the
past behind them and get on with life.
   The angry intensity of the fight that scuttled John Tower's
nomination as secretary of defense won't make that easy.
   But President Bush's quick decision on Friday to nominate Rep.
Richard Cheney, R-Wyo., a former White House chief of staff and the
No. 2 Republican leader in the House, may start the process of
calming the Senate's turbulent political waters.
   Bush acted only 24 hours after the Senate voted 53-47 to reject
Tower. His choice of Cheney received favorable reviews from members
of both parties and quick hearings were promised by the Senate Armed
Services Committee.
   Senate Republican Leader Bob Dole, who had said the Tower defeat
would not be forgotten by the GOP, retained an edge of bitterness.
   ``This will be a confirmation, not an execution,'' he said of the
Cheney nomination.
   But he soon was looking as much forward as back.
   ``I believe this will help to put all of the Tower business
behind us,'' Dole said.
   What does the Senate have to put behind it?
   Here are some of the words that jolted the chamber's stately
marble-walled facade and its old-boy-club traditions of courtesy,
comity and civility.
   _Sen. Malcolm Wallop, R-Wyo.: ``I have to rage at a Senate that
has lost its sense of responsibility, its sense of fairness, a
Senate which will never willingly shoulder responsibility. ...
   ``The nomination process is now a tool of intrigue, of arrogance
and of raw political power.
   ``We have no need of smoking guns to ruin a man's career anymore,
just enough smoke to cover the vicious partisan intentions of those
who would seek to run the executive branch from Capitol Hill.''
   ``This has been a confirmation process corrupted, contaminated,
hijacked by character assassination, by the cowardly leakage of
unsubstantiated allegations.''
   _Sen. Rudy Boschwitz, R-Minn.: ``There are very strong feelings
on this side of the aisle that we have been had. ... It is going to
be hard to put the pieces back together. It will not be automatic.
... We feel abused and hurt.''
   But some Republicans such as Sen. John Warner of Virginia say
they already feel ``a spirit of reconciliation creeping over this
place.''
   Many Democrats hastened to speed reconciliation along, help
restore the Senate's normal courtliness and rekindle the fragile
bipartisan flame that was at least temporarily snuffed out in the
storm over Tower.
   But Democrats also were upset at the fierceness of the battle
over Tower.
   ``Charges and countercharges of partisanship, hypocrisy and bad
faith are being hurled from the White House to Capitol Hill and back
again,'' said Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vt. ``The debate in the Senate
has been as personal and acrimonious as I have seen in my 14 years
here.''
   But Leahy added: ``While things may get worse before they get
better, I am confident they will get better.''
   Sen. Robert C. Byrd, D-W.Va., the chamber's most senior Democrat,
said ``the harsh words should stop.''
   ``We must not rub salt into the wounds that have been opened. Let
us act like adults, not like warring children in a sandlot football
game,'' he said.
   Tower's problems in the Senate stemmed from allegations in a
massive FBI report that he abused alcohol, had improper relations
with women and had lucrative links to giant defense contractors that
posed the appearance of conflict of interest.
   After Bush announced the selection of Cheney as a replacement
candidate, Wallop was asked the inevitable questions about the new
nominee's personal life.
   He made it clear that in Cheney's case another bruising fight
over personal matters is unlikely.
   ``A smart straight arrow,'' Wallop said of his home-state friend.
   ``I do not know what possible skeletons could exist in that
closet.''

   In Richard Cheney, President Bush has found a
nominee for defense secretary whose personal and political finances
show little contact with the defense industry.
   Unlike John Tower, who was rejected by the Senate in part because
of his lucrative links to military contractors, Cheney has found
favor with dentists, insurance companies, farm groups and energy
companies.
   And although the Wyoming Republican has been paid better than
most of his House colleagues for giving speeches, raising a total of
$81,350 in 1987, he gave $59,000 of that to charity, according to
his most recent financial disclosure forms.
   That was more than he had to give away to meet House limits, and
none of the money had come from the defense industry.
   Over the last five years, Cheney has raised more money through
speaking fees, $266,875, than even House Republican leader Robert
Michel, who got $250,888, according to a study by Common Cause. He
kept $107,937 of that.
   Cheney's disclosure forms show that he is financially comfortable
but is not rich by congressional standards.
   In 1987 he earned between $226,333 and $290,833 and had assets
worth between $200,000 and $530,000. He had less than $50,000 in
debts.
   Cheney depended on special interests to pay for about a third of
his last re-election campaign, which cost some $292,000 _ a
relatively small amount for congressional races.
   While much of his campaign money came from energy, insurance and
farming interests, Cheney did raise more than $13,000 from defense
contractors. However, all but one of those defense interests gave
far less than the legal limit, according to records filed with the
Federal Election Commission.
   That one company, FMC Corp., gave Cheney the $5,000 legal limit
through its political action committee.
   Other defense contractors contributing to his 1988 campaign
included Lockheed Corp. and Martin Marietta Corp., which each
donated $1,500, and TRW Inc. and United Technologies Corp., which
each contributed $1,000.

   Pushed by hunger, civil wars and
unemployment, thousands of Central American refugees are working
their way through Mexico on an often dangerous trek to what they
hope will be a better life in the United States.
   ``It's like a trail of ants,'' one Mexican official said of the
Central Americans flooding across Mexico's southern border.
   Mexican officials estimate that at any given moment at least
10,000 Cental Americans are in Mexico, many of them heading toward
Brownsville, Texas, the closest point in the United States to
Central America.
   Oscar Mauricio Torres Sosa, legal adviser to El Salvador's
Migration Department, said at least 550,000 to 600,000 people _ over
10 percent of the population _ have left the country during its
9-year-old civil war, the vast majority for the United States.
   ``All types of people are leaving, from all social levels,''
Torres said.
   As many as 100,000 Central Americans may enter, or try to enter,
the United States this year, U.S. immigration officials say.
   Many of the refugees say they are persecuted in their homelands
by death squads, the army or guerrilla groups. Many take buses
through other Central American nations and arrive in Tapachula, in
the southernmost state of Chiapas.
   On the 1,100-mile trail north to Matamoros, the refugees
encounter extortion from officials and bus drivers, then find
themselves cheated or stripped by smugglers who offer to take them
past newly reinforced U.S. border patrols in the
Matamoros-Brownsville region.
   Cirse Amador, 22, a Nicaraguan, said her group of six paid a bus
driver $65 to get past checkpoints in Mexico. After they got to
Matamoros, she said, ``they took us all off the bus. They asked for
$50 apiece and since we didn't have dollars they took 50,000
pesos,'' or $21, she said.
   Once inside the United States, the refugees face arrest by the
U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service, which is jailing and
deporting those who can't prove political persecution.
   Nevertheless, thousands are determined to get through.
   ``One day I'll get there. I don't know when, but I'll do it,''
said 28-year-old Eduardo Lopez Lozano, a mechanic and repairman from
relatively peaceful Tegucigalpa, Honduras.
   ``Life has been hard for me and has taught me to do everything
... and this will help me in the United States,'' Lopez told The
Associated Press.
   Mexican officials in Tapachula complain that Central Americans
take jobs from Mexicans, don't pay taxes on their businesses and
commit crimes.
   They would not, however, discuss the problem in detail and spoke
only on condition of anonymity.
   ``Our worry is the same as in the United States: What do we do
with them? Here we have an economic recession,'' declared one
official. Mexico is already struggling to provide jobs for one
million new workers annually.
   For most Central Americans, there is no way to legally migrate to
the United States unless they fall into a preference group, either
by family relations or special skills or by luck via an annual
lottery.
   For many, requesting political asylum had been the only legal way
in, but at the U.S. border, a suddenly toughened U.S. policy has
changed the pattern.
   Many are waiting at the border for another chance. Others are
seeking to cross illegally with ``coyotes,'' or people-smugglers, as
many Mexicans do. Still others are looking for softer points along
the 2,000-mile U.S.-Mexico border.
   ``We're seeing the same number of people trying to cross,'' said
Inez Gonzalez, information director for the Matamoros city
government. ``The problem here in Matamoros is that they don't have
a place to go. They don't have a place to eat.'' In Matamoros there
is only one shelter for Central Americans.
   Across the Rio Grande, the Central Americans fill detention
centers in Brownsville, where they outnumber Mexicans trying to
enter south Texas by as much as 9-to-1 on some days, U.S. Border
Patrol agents say.
   Last week, as deportations began, there were some 1,700 illegal
Central Americans detained in Brownsville, many in shelters and
tents.
   Torres, the Salvadoran legal adviser, said most Salvadoran
emigrants are seeking better economic conditions.
   Typically, workers in the United States send dollars back to
relatives, dollars that help support the local economy. The
Guatemalan magazine Cronica said such funds total about $430 million
a year and constitute Guatemala's largest single source of foreign
exchange.
   In El Salvador estimates of the funds run from $200 million to
$600 million, which would be larger than the annual figure for U.S
aid. The money is hard to track because much of it is either mailed
or brought in as cash.
   In Nicaragua, where inflation reached 20,000 percent last year
and living standards are plunging, the leftist government has
encouraged emigration to rid itself of political opponents and
dissatisfied citizens.
   President Daniel Ortega of Nicaragua summed up his attitude by
saying that opponents can ``find their democracy in Miami.''

   Prosecutors are preparing to try their
first case in the Defense Department purchasing scandal this month,
nearly three years after they began the coast-to-coast investigation.
   Already, a defense contracting firm, Hazeltine Corp., of
Greenlawn, N.Y., a former top executive of Unisys Corp., a former
procurement officer with the Marine Corps and seven other defense
industry figures have pleaded guilty to a variety of charges.
   U.S. Attorney Henry Hudson of the Eastern District of Virginia,
who is directing the wide-ranging case, said he is pleased with the
progress of the investigation of the $150 billion Pentagon
procurement system.
   Hudson said those pleading guilty have agreed to cooperate in the
``Operation Ill Wind'' investigation that burst into public last
June when FBI agents raided 44 locations around the country.
   Court documents indicate investigators relied on evidence
obtained from telephone wire taps to obtain search warrants.
   ``We're moving along at a good pace,'' Hudson said last week
after a key figure in the case, Charles F. Gardner, a former general
manager of a Unisys division on Long Island, N.Y., pleaded guilty to
bribing a former high-ranking Navy official, Melvyn Paisley.
   Paisley, the former assistant secretary of the Navy for research,
engineering and systems, has not been charged with any wrongdoing.
   Now a private consultant, he has denied through his attorneys
that he knew anything about Gardner's bribe, which the government
said was in the form of buying Paisley's condominium in Sun Valley,
Idaho, in August 1986 for an inflated price.
   Hudson refused to say if he expects more indictments, but defense
attorneys say a federal grand jury is still hearing evidence.
   Only one government official, Jack A. Sherman, formerly a
procurement officer with the Marine Corps, has admitted taking
bribes. He acknowledged that he accepted $43,000 from consultants in
exchange for confidential information about the competitive bidding
process.
   The government did not name the consultants. Sherman, who faces
up to 20 years in prison and a $500,000 fine, is to be sentenced on
April 7.
   Hudson also declined to answer any questions about whether the
case could encompass members of Congress, their campaigns or their
staffs.
   Gardner, for example, admitted that he caused $1,000 illegal
corporate contributions to be laundered to the campaigns of Rep. Roy
Dyson, D-Md., and former Rep. William Chappell, D-Fla.
   Hudson, however, said neither congressman knew the contributions
were illicit.
   The labyrinthian case involves charges that defense firms, or
their employees, hired private consultants who bribed Pentagon
officials for information needed to win multimillion-dollar
contracts. Often, the small network of consultants consisted of
former Pentagon officials who maintained contacts with people inside
the Defense Department.
   In the first trial, scheduled to start March 27 in U.S. District
Court, prosecutors will attempt to prove that Teledyne Electronics
of Newbury Park, Calif., and three of its employees paid a private
consultant, William Parkin, to obtain details about a $100 million
Navy radar contract.
   Parkin is accused of paying another consultant, Fred Lackner of
Woodland Hills, Calif., who, in turn, gave money to Stuart Berlin, a
one-time Navy procurement specialist, prosecutors say.
   All the defendants have pleaded innocent to the charges, which
are contained in an indictment unsealed on Jan. 6.
   ``My position on behalf of my client is that when all of the
evidence is produced ... we are confident the jury will find Bill
Parkin committed no crime whatsoever,'' said Gerard Treanor,
Parkin's attorney.
   When he receives the government's witness list next week, Treanor
said he will find out if some of the people who have pleaded guilty
will testify against his client.
   Parkin worked with a number of defense contractors including
Unisys, Hazeltine, Northrup and Teledyne Electronics. Parkin also
knew Gardner, the former Unisys executive, and Paisley, Treanor said.
   At the Pentagon, meanwhile, the case has touched off another
review of ways to overhaul the procurement system. Defense officials
have suspended or fired government employees identified in the ``Ill
Wind'' investigation; suspended a number of companies and
consultants from doing any government work, and required a number of
contractors to swear in writing they have not received any bidding
based on inside information.
   Some of the companies also have launched internal reviews of
their practices. Unisys, a computer company that was formerly the
Sperry Corp., examined its practices to ensure they were legal.
Hazeltine has done the same thing, company officials say. Both
companies say they have cooperated with the government in the
investigation.

   Profits from illegal cocaine sales are so vast
these days that government agents measure drug dollars by weight and
cocaine dealers, in a scramble to launder the bulky cash, have even
gone so far as to buy banks.
   ``The cocaine organizations are generating a horrendous amount of
cash,'' said U.S. Attorney Robert Bonner.
   ``If they can't convert this cash and get it out of the United
States, the whole point of the illegal drug operation is frustrated.
   ``Most people don't realize the physical space and weight taken
up by cash proceeds... Until it is counted, we are measuring this
money in weight. $1 million in cash is well over 100 pounds of
currency.''
   So drug dealers devise ingenious schemes to get money out of the
country. The arrests of 37 jewelers and their employees has exposed
what authorities say was a clever new mechanism: using bogus gold
transactions to hide drug profits.
   In recent years Bonner's office has prosecuted money-laundering
rings that went so far as to buy their own banks, but nothing has
matched the scope of the ring broken by the federal ``Operation
Polar Cap,'' which allegedly involved whole families as defendants
and more money than any case before it.
   The case broke open Feb. 22 as federal agents searched 85
locations in Los Angeles, New York and Miami and U.S. marshals swept
into Los Angeles' wholesale jewelry mart, arresting proprietors of a
dozen jewelry and bullion outlets.
   Jewelers allegedly laundered more than $1 billion in just over
two years.
   A federal grand jury here indicted 33 jewelers and associates
Wednesday. Four other defendants were indicted in San Jose the
previous week.
   Authorities also confiscated $80 million in property, including
jewelry, $12 million in gold, $6.74 million in cash, a condominium,
apartment complex, five houses and a 10-story building in the center
of the downtown mart.
   ``This investigation certainly will pay for itself,'' Bonner said
at a news conference announcing the indictments.
   According to court documents, the money-laundering operation was
run primarily from Ropex Corp., owned by Wanis ``Joseph''
Koyomejian, and Andonian Brothers Manufacturing Co., owned by Vahe
and Nazareth Andonian. One defendant, Raul Vivas, is in custody in
Uruguay, from where he allegedly ran the ring.
   The defendants were charged with aiding the distribution of
thousands of pounds of cocaine by laundering hundreds of milllions
of dollars in cash from drug sales across the country. They also
were charged with conspiring to violate the Money Laundering Control
Act and to avoid reporting currency transactions over $10,000 as
required by law.
   The maximum sentence for conspiracy is life imprisonment. The
maximum for money laundering is 20 years in prison and fines up to
$25 million.
   Most of the defendants are different from any arrested in the
past. Instead of Colombian nationals deep into the drug trade, they
are of Armenian, Syrian, Turkish and Lebanese extraction, emigres
who seemed to have grabbed a piece of the American dream with their
thriving gold and jewelry businesses.
   The defendants, through their lawyers, have declared their
innocence.
   Government officials won't comment in depth on Polar Cap, but
some 300 pages of affidavits show their view of how the gold and
jewelry trade became a nearly perfect cover after the 1986 arrests
of major money-launderers.
   According to affidavits, here's how one gold-related transaction
worked:
   On Dec. 12, 1988, nine boxes of cash _ $2,568,000 _ were shipped
from Z&amp;G Gold in New York by armored car to Andonian Brothers' API
subsidiary in Los Angeles, where it was counted and phone calls were
made confirming the amount.
   The next day, Nazareth Andonian ordered 177 kilograms of gold
credited to a gold brokerage account of Ronel Refining of Hollywood,
Fla., a gold refining company, and deposited the $2,568,000 in a Los
Angeles bank.
   He later wire-transferred $2,491,152 to Ronel, keeping $76,848 as
API's 3 percent commission for laundering. Ronel owner Richard
Ferris used the money to pay for the gold, keeping a 4 percent
commission. At that point, according to an affidavit, ``Ronel is
positioned to repeatedly sell the same gold to API-LA via various
gold brokers.''
   Cash was delivered daily by drug couriers to about a dozen
jewelry stores in New York and Los Angeles, then transported to API
or Ropex for counting and deposit under the guise of gold sales, the
government said. Millions then were transferred to banks in Panama
and Uruguay for delivery to Colombia as payment for cocaine that had
been shipped on consignment to the United States.
   ``The amount represents proceeds of approximately 70 tons of
cocaine sold in the United States in two years,'' Bonner said.
   The scheme worked without detection until early last year, when
incidents on two continents led federal agents to begin
surveillance, including wiretaps, bugs, hidden cameras and secret
trash collections, in several U.S. cities.
   Everything began to unravel in January 1988 when Wells Fargo Bank
reported ABI was making extraordinarily large deposits of U.S.
currency into specific accounts. In one three-month period, $25
million had been deposited.
   Drug Enforcement Administration Agent Michael Orton said in an
affidavit that the government learned from a New York cocaine dealer
that drug proceeds were being delivered to an API office there for
laundering.
   Then, an agent working in Montevideo, Uruguay, learned from a
cocaine dealer of ``a money laundering operation in Los Angeles,
Miami and New York that was initiated in April 1986 by Panamanian
and Colombian drug traffickers. (He) described the money laundering
operation as utilizing bogus gold shipments and transactions to
conceal the laundering...,'' Orton said.
   The source named two Latin American partners in the scheme, but
it wasn't until last September that multiple informants, apparently
seeking leniency in their own cases, began spilling details of the
operation, naming the principals and pinpointing its center in the
Los Angeles jewelry district.
   At one point, 23 DEA and FBI agents were intercepting calls to
Andonian Brothers and Ropex. They heard apparently coded talk of
large amounts of money and saw deliveries of duffle bags, boxes and
catalog cases filled with money.
   The currency would be piled on tables, sometimes to the ceiling,
said a prosecutor. And it would be counted by high-speed counting
machines.
   Gathering evidence became complicated, when API began using a
paper shredder to destroy documents and black spray paint to
obliterate the return addresses on packages delivered to the
company. Orton said he found a chemical solvent which dissolved the
paint and revealed the address of a jewelry company in New York
which allegedly was shipping money to be laundered.
   According to Bonner, increasing seizures of money and cocaine in
Los Angeles indicate that it has supplanted Miami as the nation's
cocaine capital as Mexican and Colombian cartels join forces to ship
drugs from Mexico.
   ``We've had a definite shift of cocaine coming across the Mexican
border, rather than being shipped in from Florida,'' he said. The
result is that ``Los Angeles now has become the major distribution
point for cocaine.''

<TEXT>
   Sales of big, four-wheel-drive tractors, the
kind that go for as much as a quarter-section of land in some parts,
rebounded sharply in 1988 and are expected to show further gains
this year.
   Preliminary estimates by the Agriculture Department show that
2,729 of the big tractors were sold last year, up 65 percent from
just 1,653 in 1987. The gain may be around 14 percent in 1989 to
about 3,100 units, says the department's Economic Research Service.
   But the gains still leave sales of the big machines far short of
the more than 10,000 a year purchased in the late 1970s, just before
heavy debts, falling commodity prices and other problems put a
financial crunch on the nation's farm economy.
   The four-wheel-drive models are not the only tractors or machines
that figure into today's huge agricultural investment. But they are
one of the barometers, and their costs are formidable. As of last
October, according to USDA surveys, the tractors cost an average of
$76,800 each.
   A few other machines cost more, however. Large grain combines
averaged $91,600 each last fall, and self-propelled cotton pickers
were $84,800 each. Comparatively, farmland nationally averaged only
$548 per acre a year ago.
   The USDA agency says in a new report that total farm machinery
expenditures gained in 1987 after seven consecutive years of
decline. Overall, it said, farmers spent $5.77 billion on machinery
in 1987, up from $4.61 billion in 1986.
   Preliminary estimates put 1988 expenditures in a range of $5.9
billion to $6.5 billion, and the forecast for 1989 calls for a
further increase to $6.4 billion to $7.1 billion.
   Machinery sales rose to a record of almost $12 billion in 1979
before beginning a slide of more than 60 percent to the $4.61
billion of 1986. Now, with farmland prices rising and credit more
easily available, farmers are looking harder at machinery.
   ``The drought, improved farm equity and the increasing age of the
farm machinery stock will likely have a significant influence on
1989 farm machinery sales prospects,'' the report said. ``A
continuing rise in land prices not only improves farm equity, but
indicates an optimism on the future profitability of agriculture.''
   Most new farm machinery sales were up last year, although the
drought and its shriveling of grain yields ``probably caused the 16
percen fall in sales of self-propelled combine units,'' which
dropped to 5,995 from 7,172 in 1987, the report said. Sales this
year could rise to 7,300 units.
   ``Farm machinery sales in the latter half of 1988 slipped as the
extent of the drought became apparent,'' the report said. ``Farmers
who saw yields declining delayed purchases of tractors, combines and
other equipment.''
   However, those farmers who did raise crops or had large
quantities stored from previous harvests saw commodity prices climb.
Thus, many of these found it advantageous to replace or upgrade
their equipment.
   ``Although the growth in sales continues to be good news for farm
machinery manufacturers, there is still significant room for
improvement,'' the report said. ``Within most machine categories,
1989 sales will likely approach only one-third of their 1978-80
average.''

   A pellet made mostly from bagasse, the crushed
stalks that remain after sugar cane is processed, shows possibility
as a feed base for small-scale shrimp producers, according to
Agriculture Department scientists.
   Donald W. Freeman, who works for the department's Agricultural
Research Service at the A.B. McKay Food Laboratory in Mississippi,
said the cane-based food might make it easier and cheaper to grow
shrimp in Hawaii and other tropical areas.
   Tests in Hawaii showed that the shrimp not only ate the bagasse
pellets _ which are fortified with inexpensive forms of protein,
fats and minerals _ but also the bacteria, algae and microscopic
zooplankton that feed on the pellets.
   Feed costs are one of the shrimp farmer's biggest costs. The
bagasse is cheap and plentiful in Hawaii, a major sugar cane
production area, and the experimental pellets cost only about $100 a
ton, compared with $300 to $450 for commercial feeds.
   Growth of the bagasse-fed shrimp was said to be comparable to
those grown in ponds and provided the regular feed.
   The report said that 76 percent of the shrimp consumed by
Americans in 1987 _ 765 million pounds valued at least $1.2 billion
wholesale _ was imported.
   Freeman said small-scale fish farmers in Hawaii, the Virgin
Islands, Puerto Rico and other tropical areas might be able to raise
shrimp economically by feeding bagasse pellets.
   Dried feedlot manure also works well as a source of nutrients for
pond microorganisms which the shrimp eat, and costs about the same
as the bagasse pellets, but Freeman said manure has ``image
problems.''
   The bagasse pellets aren't intended for high-yielding intensive
fish farming, where most of the nutritious microorganisms aren't
allowed to grow, he said. In the highly intensive pond operations,
shrimp must have better quality feed to make up for nutrients that
the microorganisms would provide.

   The United States is the world's largest
exporter of agricultural products, and it is also one of the top
importers.
   Last year, says the Agriculture Department, exports were valued
at $35.3 billion. While rebounding modestly, exports still are well
below the record levels of the early 1980s.
   Meanwhile, imports of agricultural products are at record value
levels, totaling $21 billion in the fiscal year that ended last
Sept. 30, says the department's Foreign Agricultural Service.
   The top-valued group of imports was horticultural products _

   A bus carrying guests from a wedding
party collided with another bus near Bangkok and 15 people were
killed, police reported today.
   They said 30 people were injured in the accident Sunday in
Nonthaburi province 6 miles north of Bangkok.
   Police Capt. Kiat Changyoo said one bus was returning about 40
people to Bangkok from a wedding in Suphan Buri province and the
other belonged to folk singer Sunaree Ratchasima and was taking
instruments and equipment from Bangkok to a northern province where
she was scheduled to give a concert.

<HEAD>Government Gives Fish Their Proper Names</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MIKE FEINSILBER</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government has just published a booklet
establishing that one man's flounder is another man's eyed platefish.
   It establishes, too, that some folks who give fish their ordinary
names _ their street names, you might say _ would not make it in the
public relations business.
   Not as long as they insist on applying the name longnosed
pigfaced bream to a fish that's marketed under the noble name
emperor.
   And not if they insist on calling the grunt the brown sweetlips.
Or calling the anchovy the smig. Or the grenadier the rattail.
   Just off the government's presses is ``The Fish List: FDA Guide
to Acceptable Market Names for Food Fish Sold in Interstate
Commerce.''
   It is a compilation of the market names that the government
accepts for imported and domestically available fish sold for human
consumption.
   The booklet was published jointly by the Food and Drug
Administration and the Commerce Department's National Marine
Fisheries Service, chiefly to help the industry comply with the law
that requires that a species of fish be marketed under a consistent,
national name no matter what the locals might call it.
   Take rockfish.
   ``People in the mid-Atlantic area call striped bass rockfish,''
said Mary Snyder, assistant to the director of the Division of
Regulatory Guidance at the FDA, one of the compilers of ``The Fish
List.''
   ``To the rest of the country the rockfish is a completely
different fish,'' she said. ``It is related to ocean perch, which is
a rough looking fish _ squatty and with rough scales and spinny
fins. What we here in the Washington area call a rockfish is
cigar-shaped, has stripes and is very different.''
   Labeling fish uniformly is important because laissez faire naming
can lead to deception. About a month ago, the government seized
45,672 pounds of frozen fish fillets imported from New Zealand. They
arrived labeled orange roughy, a tasty, expensive fish, when in fact
they were merely the smooth oreo dory, a cheaper fish.
   The government gives fishmongers a choice. They can sell fish
under the government-assigned market name or under the common name,
often an English translation of the scientific name given fish by
ichthyologists.
   Thus what some people call the Boston mackerel and others call
the caballa, but which has the scientific name Scomber scombrus, can
be sold simply as mackerel, its government-approved market name, or
as Atlantic mackerel, its science-accepted common name.
   ``The Fish List'' was published because fish dealers who called
the government to raise fish name questions sometimes got
inconsistent answers.
   The book lists 24 species of croaker, 38 of snapper, 18 of eel,
62 of rockfish, 31 of grouper, 15 of grunt, 21 of anchovy, 34 of
shark, and 21 of mackerel (some of which may also be sold as jack
mackerel, chub mackerel, king mackerel, snake mackerel or as
Japanese scad, Inca scad or rough scad).
   When consumers buys anchovy, they may be getting Anchoa mitchill
(common scientific name: bay anchovy) one time, Engraulis mordax
(northern anchovy) another time and Anchoa compressa (deepbody
anchovy) a third time.
   No matter, said Mrs. Snyder. They can all be sold as just plain
anchovy because they are so similar in taste and appearance that the
consumer wouldn't know the difference. Only another anchovy could
tell for sure.
   ``The Fish List'' lists only fish used by people as food, not
pets. No guppies included. No goldfish, either, even though college
students once had the custom of eating them whole, raw, live and wet.

   A device that appeared to be a pipe bomb
was planted behind an Iranian restaurant Sunday, forcing authorities
to evacuate the area before explosives experts determined it was a
fake, police said.
   No arrests were made in the case, authorities said. Police Sgt.
Tim Brown speculated that it may have been in response to Friday's
bombing of a van being driven by the wife of the Navy captain who
mistakenly shot down an Iranian airliner over the Persian Gulf.
   ``There were no threats and no prior problems of any kind, but
with all the media attention from the San Diego bombing a lot of
people might have been upset,'' Brown said.
   The replica pipe bomb was discovered by a teen-age employee of a
neighboring business behind the Dehkadeh restaurant about 11 a.m.,
the sergeant said. He said the phony device was fitted with a wire
inside, likely to make it appear realistic when X-rayed.
   About five nearby homes and the occupants of about 10 businesses
were evacuated for several hours.
   The restaurant was about to open for lunch when the pipe was
found, manager Saeed Bashizadeh said.
   ``We hope it wasn't because of the bomb in San Diego because we
are here now and don't want any trouble,'' Bashizadeh said.

   Navy Capt. Michael L. Coats,
commander of Discovery, made his only previous trip into space 4{
years ago as pilot on the same shuttle's maiden voyage.
   On that flight, he and his five cremates earned the nickname
``Icebusters'' because they removed hazardous ice particles that had
built up on the shuttle.
   The 43-year-old astronaut was born in Sacramento, Calif., but
considers Riverside, Calif., his hometown.
   Coats received a bachelor's degree from the U.S. Naval Academy in
1968, a master's degree in science and technology administration
from George Washington University in 1977 and a master's in
aeronautical engineering from the Naval Postgraduate School in 1979.
   He flew 315 combat missions in Southeast Asia in the early 1970s.
He began test pilot training in 1974 and later became a test pilot
for the A-7 and A-4 aircraft. He also served as a flight instructor
at the U.S. Naval Test Pilot School.
   Coats and his wife, Diane, have a daughter, Laura, 15, and a son,
Paul, 10.
   When he goes into space aboard Discovery, Coats will be taking
along some jewelry, insignias and other small items for several NASA
workers who never get the chance to fly on a shuttle.
   He's hoping to have more time to observe the Earth's surface from
his lofty perch than on his first flight, when the crew had to shift
the shuttle away from the Earth during part of the mission to melt
the ice.
   ``You really do get this feeling, looking at the Earth, of how
alive it is with all the colors,'' he said. ``It's a living planet
down there and then you look off into space and it is the blackest
black.''

   Air Force Col. John E. Blaha, Discovery's pilot, has been in the
astronaut corps nearly nine years awaiting his first shuttle flight.
   Blaha, 46, was born in San Antonio where his mother still lives.
His father, now deceased, also was an Air Force colonel.
   He graduated from high school in Norfolk, Va., and went on to
receive his bachelor's degree in engineering science from the Air
Force Academy in 1965. Blaha earned a master's degree in
astronautical engineering from Purdue in 1966.
   Blaha completed 361 combat missions in Vietnam. In 1971, he
attended the Air Force Aerospace Research Pilot School at Edwards
Air Force Base, Calif., where he piloted the NF-104 research
aircraft to 104,400 feet.
   Three years later, he became a test pilot and worked with the
Royal Air Force at the Aeroplane and Armament Experimental
Establishment in Boscombe Down, England.
   Blaha returned to the United States in 1976 to attend the Air
Force Air Command and Staff College. After graduating, he worked for
the Air Force at the Pentagon.
   He was selected as an astronaut in May 1980 and promoted to
colonel a year later.
   Blaha and his wife, Brenda, have three children, James, 23,
Steven, 20, and Carolyn, 15.

   Space rookie James P. Bagian is the only crew member on the
Discovery mission without a military background.
   Bagian, one of three mission specialists on the flight, became an
astronaut in August 1981 after working as an engineer and a doctor.
He also is scheduled to fly on a shuttle mission scheduled to launch
in June 1990.
   The 37-year-old Philadelphia native earned a bachelor's degree in
mechanical engineering from Drexel University in 1973 and his
doctorate in medicine from Thomas Jefferson University in 1977.
   As an engineer, Bagian worked for the 3M Co. and the U.S. Naval
Air Test Center in Maryland. After receiving his medical degree, he
completed a year of general surgery residency and then went to work
as a flight surgeon and research medical officer at the Johnson
Space Center.
   A longtime space fan and avid follower of the Mercury program in
his youth, Bagian said he filled out an astronaut application
``never really thinking I'd get accepted.'' But while completing a
residency in anesthesiology at the University of Pennsylvania, he
received word he had been chosen for the astronaut program.
   His wife, Tandi, works at the Houston space center in the life
sciences projects office and understands well the risks of
spaceflight, he said.
   ``Does she like it, from the risk standpoint? No. She'll be glad
when I'm back safely, but she knows that I want to do it, and she
says `If you want to do it, you should do it.'''
   Bagian and his wife have a 4-year-old daughter, Krista Rose.

   Marine Col. James F. Buchli, a mission specialist aboard
Discovery, is the most experienced of the current crew, a veteran of
two previous shuttle flights during nearly 10 years as an astronaut.
   The 43-year-old astronaut's first shuttle trip was on the first
Department of Defense mission, a classified flight of Discovery that
launched in January 1985.
   His second mission, which launched in October 1985, carried eight
crew members aboard Challenger _ the largest crew to fly in space so
far. The flight was called the West German D-1 Spacelab mission and
its scientific operations were controlled from the German Space
Operations Center near Munich.
   Born in New Rockford, N.D., Buchli grew up in Fargo, where his
parents still live. He received a bachelor's degree in aeronautical
engineering from the Naval Academy in 1967 and a master's in
aeronautical engineering systems from the University of West Florida
in 1975.
   He received a commission in the Marine Corps after graduating
from Annapolis and completed a one-year tour of duty in Vietnam
where he was a platoon commander, company commander and executive
officer.
   When he returned home, he began naval flight officer training in
Pensacola, Fla., and spent the next two years assigned to the Marine
Fighter Attack Squadron 235 in Hawaii. He also served with squadrons
in Japan and Thailand and back in South Carolina.
   He and his wife, Jean, have a son, James, 16, and daughter,
Jennifer, 11.

   Marine Col. Robert C. Springer's presence aboard Discovery along
with fellow Marine Col. James F. Buchli marks the first time a
shuttle crew has included two Marines.
   Springer, a mission specialist, is making his first spaceflight.
   Springer, 46, was born in St. Louis and grew up in Ashland, Ohio,
where his parents still live. He received his bachelor's degree in
naval science from the Naval Academy in 1964 and a master's degree
in operations research and systems analysis from the Naval
Postgraduate School in 1971.
   He received a commission from the Marine Corps after graduating
from Annapolis and served at the Navy Air Training Command for
flight training at Pensacola, Fla., and Beeville, Texas.
   After receiving his wings in 1966, he flew F-4 aircraft at the
Marine Corps Air Station in Cherry Point, N.C. He next went to
Vietnam where he completed 300 combat missions.
   He will take several items into space including some jewelry, an
old pocketwatch and a T-shirt for Young Life, a Christian youth
organization. Springer also will take along a Texas A&amp;M University
flag for his 18-year-old son, Chad, who is a freshman at the school.
   Springer and his wife, Molly, have two other children, Kira, 17,
and Derek, 16.

<HEAD>Sandinistas To Get US Olive Branch If They Move Toward Democracy</HEAD>

   The Bush administration is prepared to ease the
U.S. trade embargo against Nicaragua and take a number of other
conciliatory measures if that country shows it is serious about
holding fair elections next year, according to U.S. officials.
   Under such circumstances, the administration also would be
prepared to upgrade diplomatic relations with Nicaragua, including
the exchange of ambassadors, the officials said. The two countries
have not been represented at the level of ambassador in each other's
capital since last July.
   The list of possible gestures toward the Sandinista government
numbers about 20, according to the officials, who asked not to be
identified.
   Alternatively, the administration has prepared a potential list
of punitive measures of similar length if Nicaraguan opposition
forces are not given what U.S. officials perceive to be an equal
chance in the balloting, which probably will be held next February.
   These steps include the tightening of the four-year-old trade
embargo against Nicaragua and applying pressure on aid donors such
as Japan and West European countries to withhold assistance from
Nicaragua.
   Secretary of State James A. Baker III has alluded to the new
approach in general terms, saying a ``carrot and stick'' policy has
the best chance of winning support from Congress and achieving a
democratic outcome in Nicaragua.
   As part of the process of national reconciliation which other
Central American countries have been encouraging in Nicaragua, the
Sandinistas announced on Friday they will pardon 1,894 members of
the military force which had served the rightist, pre-revolutionary
regime a decade ago.
   The pardon will apply to all but 39 members of that force,
Nicaraguan officials said.
   Over the short term, the new administration's approach to
Nicaragua is likely to undergo its stiffest challenge on the same
issue that bedeviled President Reagan during much of his eight years
in office: the Contra rebels.
   More than 10,000 Contras are assembled in camps in Honduras near
the Nicaragua border, surviving on a U.S.-financed humanitarian aid
program.
   The Bush administration wants the Contras to continue on as a
unified force to keep pressure on the Sandinistas. But, according to
congressional sources, Democratic lawmakers are eager to see the
rebels demobilized, contending that their continued existence will
only make the Sandinistas less willing to make concessions during
the coming electoral process.
   The Democrats argue that the dismantling of the Contras is
entirely consistent with the spirit of the Central American summit
meeting last month in El Salvador, which called unanimously for the
breakup of the Contras in exchange for the creation of an open
system in Nicaragua.
   As the administration sees it, demobilization of the Contras
would only increase the possibility of Sandinista foot-dragging in
carrying out democratic reforms. Baker strongly supports maintaining
the Contras at least as a potential fighting force.
   The conflicting points of view most likely will come to a head
later this month when Congress decides whether to extend
humanitarian assistance for the Contras. The current package expires
on March 31.
   The size of the request has not been decided but congressional
Democrats are expected to favor an aid program that emphasizes
resettlement of the Contras outside of Honduras, in effect ending
their role as the administration's chief asset in the region.
   But administration officials believe the Contras, if they are
allowed to continue on as a cohesive unit, can still play a useful
psychological role in encouraging democracy in Nicaragua even though
they have received no U.S. military aid for more than a year and
none is expected for the foreseeable future.

<TEXT>
   Salvadorans, for the first time
in their history, have the chance to keep one party in power or
replace it with a completely different party's program and ideology.
   The choice to be made Sunday is between presidential candidates
of the incumbent Christian Democratic Party and rightist Republican
Nationalist Alliance, or Arena. Five other parties are running
candidates but acknowledge they have no chance of winning.
   That there is a choice at all, along with prospects of a
constitutional transfer of power, demonstrates how far this nation
has progressed toward democracy.
   But security forces and right-wing death squads continue to
summarily execute suspected leftists, the leftist Farabundo Marti
National Liberation Front terrorizes elected officials, and a brutal
civil war that has left 70,000 dead drags on.
   Whatever the outcome, the term of President Jose Napoleon Duarte,
a linchpin of U.S. policy in the region, ends June 1. The
constitution forbids re-election, and Duarte is dying of cancer.
   ``Duarte's great legacy is this election and this transition,''
said a senior U.S. diplomat. ``It's ironic that his enemies, Arena,
are the ultimate beneficiaries of Duarte and the democratic
conditions he created.''
   Washington's role in El Salvador cannot be underestimated. The
country receives $500 million in aid every year, almost as much as
it collects in taxes.
   Arena favors a smaller state role in the economy and is
considered less open to negotiations to end the war. One of it's
slogans is a militaristic ``Win the Peace.''
   The question in many minds remains: Has progress toward
democratic government been great enough to prevent the country
sliding into chaos?
   Arena trounced the incumbents in last year's legislative and
municipal elections and is favored to win, though a runoff probably
will be necessary.
   Independent polls give Arena candidate Alfredo Cristiani a lead
of three to nine percentage points over Christian Democratic Fidel
Chavez Mena.
   Arena, founded by right-wingers linked by many to death squads,
says it has changed. Its campaign refrain is ``Vamos al Cambio,''
meaning ``Let's change.'' But many fear an Arena victory will bring
more violence and intensify the war.
   ``Arena's antecedents make us worry about the prospect of their
victory ... Violence will undoubtedly increase,'' Gregorio Rosa
Chavez, auxiliary Roman Catholic archbishop of San Salvador, said in
a recent homily.
   The rightists count on pervasive dissatisfaction with the
Christian Democrats, who have failed to bring peace.
   No independent poll gives Arena the 51 percent necessary for
victory in the first round. Polling is complicated by the war,
people who fear revealing their preference, and the possibility of
coalitions in a second round, which would be held in late April.
   U.S. pollsters Greenberg-Lake, in a survey released last month,
said 27 percent of those consulted intend to vote for Arena.
Eighteen percent said they will vote for the Christian Democrats,
while nearly 40 percent were unwilling to divulge their preference
or were undecided.
   In the most telling element of the survey, 58 percent said they
believe the Christian Democrats do not deserve re-election.
   ``The people want alternation in government. Alternation
contributes to the establishment of democracy,'' Armando Calderon
Sol said in an interview. He is mayor of San Salvador and one of
Arena's top four leaders.
   Duarte's 1984 victory was the first semblance of a democratic
presidential election in El Salvador's history. He took power from a
provisional regime that had emerged from a 1979 coup.
   The coup was the start of a reform process to end a monopoly on
power exercised by an alliance of the military and a landowning
oligarchy.
   Arena was founded in 1981 by ousted army intelligence Maj.
Roberto D'Aubuisson, who has been linked with death squads by human
rights organizations, the Christian Democrats and the U.S. Embassy.
The squads connected to security forces ran rampant in the early
1980s and were blamed for thousands of slayings.
   D'Aubuisson, a legislator, denies the charges. His party has
sought to refurbish its image of violence and fanaticism by
promoting Cristiani, an urbane businessman educated at Georgetown
University.
   But the charismatic D'Aubuisson still is the party's big drawing
card and he continues to be introduced at rallies as ``our maximum
leader.''
   Vice President Rodolfo Castillo Claramount recently called Arena
``a party of fascists.'' The party anthem is belligerant, almost
morbid, with refrains that ``Liberty is written with blood'' and
``El Salvador will be the tomb of the Reds.''
   Voting will take place under difficult conditions. The guerrillas
have told their supporters to boycott the vote and have decreed a
nationwide road transport ban beginning Wednesday. Such bans usually
are quite effective.

   Buoyed by a flawless countdown and a
good weather forecast, NASA was set to launch space shuttle
Discovery on Monday with five astronauts and a cargo that includes a
$100 million satellite and four crippled rats.
   At 11:58 p.m., launch pad workers began to pump 528,000 gallons
of supercold liquid hydrogen and oxygen into the shuttle's external
tank. The chemicals will fuel the three main rocket engines that
must fire for 8{ minutes to put Discovery into orbit.
   Liftoff was set for 8:07 a.m. EST. Forecasts called for clear
skies, and mild temperatures _ ideal for launch of the first shuttle
mission of 1989. Only the possibility of strong high-altitude winds
gave any concern, and NASA officials said wind conditions at
midnight were favorable for the launch.
   ``Tomorrow morning is a great day to go fly,'' shuttle boss
Richard Truly said at a Sunday afternoon news conference. ``The
weather has been getting prettier and prettier. We're in good
shape.''
   The countdown proceeded so smoothly on Sunday that preparations
skipped two hours ahead of schedule.
   ``It seems a little scary it's going so well,'' said Chuck
Henschel, launch test director. ``We're ahead of where we want to
be.''
   The fault-free countdown was in sharp contrast to the troubles
that plagued NASA in getting Discovery ready for the mission. The
flight originally had a Feb. 18 target date, but a series of faulty
or suspect parts delayed the launch four times.
   Workers changed out turbo pumps in the main engines when flaws
were found in the pumps on sister shuttle Atlantis. Last week, tests
showed a failure in the system that commands the separation of the
two booster rockets and the external tank. The unit was replaced
with a part removed from Columbia.
   Launch of Discovery sets in motion NASA's ambitious plan for
seven shuttle missions this year while building toward a
once-a-month flight rate by 1992. The flight will be the third since
the nation returned to manned spaceflight following the Challenger
disaster of 1986.
   Discovery's five-man crew is to be awakened about 3 a.m. Monday
and will board the shuttle at 5:15 a.m.
   Waiting for them in cages aboard the ship will be four rats, part
of an experiment on the effects of weightlessness on the healing of
injured bones.
   A small piece of bone was clipped from each of the rats, and how
well these injuries heal during five days in weightlessness will be
studied when the rodents are returned to Earth.
   Discovery's main job for the 28th shuttle mission is to deliver
to orbit a $100 million communications craft called the Tracking and
Data Relay Satellite. The satellite is the final point in an
orbiting communications network that will keep the shuttle and other
spacecraft in almost constant radio contact with the Earth. The
network will enable NASA to shut down six ground tracking stations,
saving $3 million a month.
   The satellite, called TDRS-4, will be released from Discovery
about six hours after launch. Two later rocket firings will send the
TDRS to a stationary orbit 22,300 miles over the Atlantic Ocean.
   NASA already has two such satellites in orbit, but TDRS-1 has
been in use since 1983 and is ailing. It will be moved to a new
location in orbit for use as a spare.
   TDRS-2, which was to have been the second in the network, was on
board Challenger when that spacecraft exploded shortly after launch.
   Last September, TDRS-3 was deployed from Discovery, during the
first shuttle flight after the Challenger accident. The satellite
now is over the Pacific Ocean and will be used during the current
mission.
   Discovery's crew is led by Navy Capt. Michael L. Coats, 43, who
is making his second spaceflight. His pilot is Air Force Col. John
E. Blaha, 46, on his first shuttle mission.
   The three missions specialists on the crew are James F. Buchli,
43, a Marine colonel who has twice before flown into space; Marine
Col. Robert C. Springer, 46, and Dr. James P. Bagian, a 37-year-old
physician. Both Springer and Bagian are space rookies.
   In addition to monitoring the rats, the astronauts will conduct
other experiments.
   Two types of plants will sprout in a small garden on board to
test the effects of weightlessness on root growth. Officials said
this study may develop ways to grow plants aboard the space station.
   Scientists also will study the effects weightlessness on the
development of embryos by flying 32 fertilized chicken eggs. The
eggs will be incubated throughout the mission and the embryos will
be compared later with some grown at the same time on the ground.
   Discovery is to orbit for five days, one hour and land on
Saturday at Edwards Air Force Base in California.

<HEAD>`Raiders' Among The Banned In Continued Crackdown on Franglais</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   It's getting tough in France these days for
corporate raiders. They're banned. So, for that matter, are white
knights, black knights, and traveler's checks.
   Only from the vocabulary, of course.
   In its latest battle against franglais, or anglicized French, the
Finance Ministry has evicted the foreign intruders from the official
language.
   Now, companies won't be taken over by raiders _ or ``rai-dairs,''
as the French say _ they'll be taken over by ``attaquants,'' or
attackers. Knights, black or white, are now ``chevaliers.'' And at
dinner, you'll have to pay with a ``cheque-voyage.''
   The decree, signed by Finance Minister Pierre Beregovoy, was
entered last week into the Official Journal where all official
pronouncements are inscribed.
   It states that the French designation be used in all
administrative texts, documents or correspondence as well as ``in
information or presentations for radio or television.''
   The decree did not specify how authorities might deal with
continued flagrant use of the outlawed English words.
   The action was the latest in a more than decade-long battle by
French officialdom against Franglais. The battle has been mainly
uphill.
   The 1988 Petit Larousse dictionary, which is published every year
and acts as a sort of mirror of contemporary life and language,
deemed ``raiders'' an acceptable word. It was one of 73 new entries.
   In the popular vocabulary, words like ``snob,'' meaning just
that, or ``parking,'' meaning ``parking lot,'' remain firmly
entrenched.

   The following are visions from
four people interviewed on the future of El Salvador, which holds
presidential elections Sunday.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   Armando Calderon Sol. Mayor of San Salvador and a leader of the
rightist opposition Republican Nationalist Alliance, known as Arena,
which is favored to take the presidency:
   ``In 1980, Washington turned El Salvador into a sociological
laboratory, breaking apart the system of private property with
agrarian reform, nationalization of the marketing of export crops
and nationalization of the banks.
   ``We intend to rescue our sovereignty and independence.
   ``... We want a broad capitalism, not just for a small group, but
capitalism for the masses.
   ``We will call on the honorable military technicians to enforce
the laws.
   ``We're not afraid of communists, of debating them in the
political arena, competing with them in elections. The problem is
they break the law, planting bombs, killing.''
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   ``Diego.'' A midlevel commander in the guerrilla Farabundo Marti
National Liberation Front:
   ``The FMLN is fighting to put the resources of the country at the
disposal of the entire people, not just of one sector. And we're
fighting to form a new Salvadoran ... a dignified and educated man
...
   ``The basic problem is that the regime, despite its democratic
facade, is still fundamentally repressive ...
   ``We need to create the political conditions in which we can not
only cast a ballot, but in which we can work politically without
getting our throats cut. The bodies that continue appearing each
week by the roadside, in a grain sack, their hands tied, tortured,
their faces painted red, they don't have the good fortune to be
named Ungo and Zamora (prominent leftist politicians).''
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   Ruben Zamora. Coordinator of the Democratic Convergence leftist
coalition running third in polls:
   ``The first thing that has to be done is putting the state of war
behind us ... It is only possible through negotiated accord among
the principal _ or all _ the sectors of society. Then we work on a
program that attacks the causes of the war _ social injustice and
the lack of real democracy.
   ``We have to have a program of economic recovery, but designed
with the poor in mind, improvement of their buying power, increased
wages. Then would come the process of real democratization ... That
means rescuing our sovereignty, which has been sold like a plate of
beans to the United States.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   President Jose Napoleon Duarte. His five-year term ends June 1
and his Christian Democrats are trailing in polls:
   ``There is absolute freedom of expression, which never in our
history has there been. All political and social sectors have access
to the media, which reflect ideological pluralism.
   ``But the FMLN has responded to that by permanently attacking the
most elemental rights of the population ...
   ``Each day the people's `No!' to authoritarianism and its
violence is louder. That clamor must carry us to a definitive peace
along the only acceptable path _ democracy within the framework of
law.''

   Comedian Bill Cosby dominated the People's
Choice Awards for the fifth straight year Sunday, followed by the
hit TV sitcom ``Roseanne'' and the film ``Rain Man.''
   Cosby was voted favorite male televison performer, favorite
all-around male star and his NBC series won favorite comedy in the
15th annual edition of the entertainment popularity contest
conducted by a nationwide Gallup Organization poll.
   Cosby was not present at the awards ceremony at Walt Disney
Studios here but thanked the public in a videotaped message in the
two-hour CBS national telecast presented by hosts Michael Landon and
Michele Lee.
   ``The Cosby Show'' also won all-time favorite television show
honors, edging longer-running hits ``MASH'' and ``Star Trek.''
   ``Roseanne'' star Roseanne Barr was named favorite female
performer in a new television series, the show was voted favorite
new television comedy series and co-star John Goodman was voted
favorite male performer in a new television series.
   ``I'd like to accept this award on behalf of all the working moms
and housewives,'' said Miss Barr, whose ABC-TV situation comedy
portrays the life of a blue-collar mother.
   ABC's ``China Beach'' was voted favorite new television dramatic
series and NBC's ``L.A. Law'' was selected as favorite television
dramatic series.
   Kirk Cameron of ABC-TV's ``Growing Pains'' was named favorite
young television performer and ``Cosby'' co-star Phylicia Rashad
took honors as favorite female television performer.
   The World War II saga ``War and Remembrance'' won best miniseries
honors. ``War and Remembrance,'' globe-spanning story of a family
torn by World War II, was based on Herman Wouk's novel of the same
name.
   The ABC-TV miniseries' disappointing ratings had led to
predictions that the miniseries format might be doomed.
   ```War and Remembrance' was an enormous undertaking and one that
required an almost unbelievable commitment from everyone involved in
the production,'' said miniseries star Robert Mitchum, who accepted
the award from Charlton Heston.
   In the film divisions, Cher was named favorite all-around female
star, while Hoffman was voted favorite actor in a dramatic motion
picture and his ``Rain Man'' was named favorite dramatic motion
picture.
   ``Big'' and ``Twins'' tied for favorite comedy motion picture,
while Eddie Murphy and Bette Midler were chosen as favorite male and
female actors in comedy motion pictures.
   Meryl Streep was voted favorite actress in a dramatic motion
picture.
   ``Gone With The Wind'' captured all-time favorite motion picture
honors.
   In music, Michael Jackson's ``Smooth Criminal'' received favorite
music video honors.
   Country singer Randy Travis was voted favorite male musical
performer and last year's female winner, Whitney Houston, once again
received favorite female musical performer honors.

   When President Bush rolled up his pants and showed
off his cowboy boots at an inaugural ball, Rocky Carroll couldn't
have asked for better advertising.
   Not that he needs it. Carroll's boots _ which he makes for
presidents, country-western singers and professional athletes, among
others _ are so popular that longtime customers have to drive around
the block a few times just to park at his RJ's Boot Co. shop.
   ``Before he became famous, he used to fix all my high heels,''
Donna Meyer said recently while picking up a pair of boots Carroll
repaired. ``Oh, he is still fixing them for me, but he is so busy
now.''
   ``I love what I do,'' Carroll said. ``I was raised in a shoe
shop. My mother said I used to suck on a leather heel and cut my
first tooth on an old heel.''
   Carroll's grandparents started the business in the east Texas
town of Tenaha. The craft was passed to his parents, who taught
Carroll. Carroll, who made his first boot at age 10, has passed the
trade to his son and daughter. They, in turn, operate two other
shops in Houston.
   Bush, for one, is getting to be a regular customer. The
president's office called before his recent Far East trip. The
request: four pairs of boots.
   The call came on a Friday afternoon. The White House wanted the
boots by Tuesday, a day before the president's departure.
   Carroll had the boots in Washington by Monday night. Among them
was a black pair that had a Chinese flag on the front shoe and an
American flag on its companion. Bush gave a pair to Chinese Premier
Li Peng.
   The 51-year-old bootmaker had earlier made a pair for Bush at the
request of Houston Police Department officers who escort the
president when he visits his hometown.
   The black size 11D had the outline of the state of Texas with the
Texas flag inside and his initials on the side.
   Bush apparently showed off his boots to then-President Reagan,
who called Carroll to place his own order _ two pair, size 10{B, of
brown and black ostrich.
   Carroll and his wife made their first trip to Washington late
last year to deliver the boots to Reagan. Carroll also gave another
pair to Bush, this time black alligator with the presidential seal.
   ``When we went into the Oval Office, he and the president were
teasing each other saying, `My boots are better looking than
yours,''' Carroll recalled. ``Bush was like a kid with a new toy.''
   His handmade boots are expensive toys, though, ranging in price
from $295 to $6,500.
   Among Carroll's other customers are country-western singers Larry
Gatlin and Willie Nelson; actor Patrick Swayze; race car driver A.J.
Foyt; several Houston Oilers; and Ringling Bros. and Barnum &amp; Bailey
Circus clowns.
   At the Black Tie and Boots Inaugural Ball, Bush wore black patent
leather boots with a Texas flag set in a gold map of the state with
a star designating Houston.
   Bush picked Carroll out of the crowd and thanked him. Since then,
the bootmaker said, his phone ``hasn't stoppped ringing.''
   ``One even wanted my autograph. I was so embarrassed. Why would
they want my autograph? I'm just an old cowboy,'' Carroll said.

   RAS AL-BISHA, Iraq (AP) _ The Iraqis manning their army's
southernmost observation post on the Iran-Iraq cease-fire line lay
in the sun, idly watching the Iranians in their outpost a few
hundred yards across the mouth of the Shatt-Al-Arab waterway.
   The Iranians do the same, peering through binoculars across the
estuary that flows into the Persian Gulf.
   The soldiers on both sides are waiting for a peace treaty between
their governments that will allow them to go home.
   The only sounds to intrude on the overpowering quiet are the
cries of sea gulls that wheel above and the waves from the gulf
breaking on the seaweed-strewn beach.
   The soldiers' biggest problem is the boredom _ and the hordes of
bugs that buzz over the marshy shoreline.
   Despite reports of violations of the 7-month-old cease-fire
further north, life in what was one of the bloodiest battlegrounds
of the 8-year Iran-Iraq war has assumed a sleepy tranquility.
   ``We've plenty of time now for fishing, playing cards and
reading,'' says the Iraqi officer who commands the small squad
manning the sandbagged post.
   ``Don't do that,'' a young Iraqi lieutenant quips as a reporter
tries to photograph the remains of an Iranian-built bridge and a
sunken vessel. ``The Iranians will take that as a violation of the
cease-fire.''
   Eleven months ago, this area was under constant Iraqi air and
artillery attack _ the main target the concrete bridge the Iranians
built to link the bridgehead on Iraq's Faw peninsula that they
captured in February 1986.
   For two years, the Iraqis tried and failed to dislodge Iranians
dug in around the marshlands ringing the battered oil terminal town
of Faw.
   Then, last April, they launched a surprise attack after weeks of
diversions and stealthy infiltration and recaptured Faw in a 36-hour
battle.
   It was the first of a chain of victories that pushed the Iranians
out of all Iraqi territory they had overrun and forced Tehran to
unconditionally accept a U.N. cease-fire resolution.
   A large sign erected at the entrance to Faw says 52,948 Iraqis
and more than 120,000 Iranians were killed in the battles for the
sandy peninsula.
   The Iraqi toll was the first indication that reporters for
Western news organizations have had of the scale of Baghdad's
losses. Unofficial estimates have put the Iraqi death toll for the
whole war at around 150,000.
   The claim of 120,000 Iranians killed merely in the fighting for
Faw is impossible to verify. The Iranians have only admitted to some
130,000 dead for the whole war, although Western analysts estimate
that is only a fraction of the true total.
   Iranian losses generally were considered to be at least three
times the Iraqi casualties, mainly because of the carnage in the
Iranians' human wave attacks against the well-entrenched Iraqis.
   Iraqi officers said more than 6.5 million shells were fired by
the two armies during the Iranian occupation of Faw.
   The ruined town, one of the few Iraqi towns overrun by the
Iranians, ``stands as a symbol of our sacrifices and heroism,'' said
Anwar Sa'eed al-Hadithi, governor of nearby Basra.
   He told The Associated Press that plans have been completed to
build a new urban center in Faw to replace the old town.
   Iraqi authorities last year launched a nationwide donation
campaign to collect money to rebuild Faw, which had a pre-war
population of 56,000.
   Similar drives were launched in neighboring Kuwait and other
Persian Gulf countries.
   Reliable Iraqi sources say millions of dollars have been
collected for the reconstruction, which is expected to start next
month on the anniversary of the liberation of Faw.
   The government has not spelled out its plans for the Faw port,
which before the war was a key oil export outlet to Japan and Europe.
   Rebuilding the port cannot start until Iran and Iraq reach
agreement in their deadlocked peace talks on clearing the
120-mile-long Shatt-al-Arab of sunken ships, war debris and silt.

   Eastern Airlines renewed flights to seven Latin
American cities Sunday and continued to lure bargain hunters to its
Northeast shuttle in an effort to rebuild despite a week-old strike.
   However, the airline's lure of $12 fares on the shuttle may have
worked too well. Several hundred would-be shuttle passengers in
Boston, New York and Washington were told they'd have to wait for
Monday morning flights because all evening flights were booked solid.
   Eastern ballyhooed the reopening of its Latin American routes as
a new start for the airline, which filed for bankruptcy protection
last week, blaming its pilots for honoring Machinists' picket lines
and plunging the carrier into a cash crisis.
   Service to three more South American cities, two domestic routes
and Montreal will begin later in the week, the airline said.
   ``What we're really saying is it is the start of a new, smaller,
restructured and viable Eastern Airlines,'' said Eastern spokesman
Robin Matell.
   Eastern lured customers on its 62 Boston-New York and New
York-Washington shuttle flights with the $12 weekend fares, down
from $69. Weekday fares begining Monday will be $49 one way, down
from the usual $99.
   Airline officials said 31,500 people crossed picket lines over
the weekend to take the cut-rate flights. Others tried to get aboard
the flights and failed.
   At Logan International Airport in Boston, stranded passengers
were told to show up at the Eastern terminal at 5:30 a.m. Monday,
when the first shuttle was slated to leave for New York.
   Officials at Washington National Airport said over 100 people who
were unable to get onto flights would have to spend the night at the
airport or make other travel arrangements.
   In New York, an undetermined number of people were stranded at
LaGuardia Airport.
   ``It's a bummer,'' said Terianne Tapia, who was up from New York
to visit her boyfriend in Boston. ``I have to be at work at 9 a.m.''
   Eastern officials said those passengers should have gotten to the
airport sooner.
   ``Those people were not stranded. We advertised the flights were
on a first-come, first-serve basis,'' Matell said. ``I'm sorry they
have to wait for the next flight, but they should have gotten there
earlier.''
   Asked if Eastern would pay for hotel accomodations, Matell said,
``Absolutely not.''
   However, Matell later said the passengers who missed flights
would be allowed to fly free during off-peak hours and for the same
$12 rate during peak hours _ if they had purchased round-trip
tickets over the weekend.
   Eastern, just nine days earlier the nation's seventh-largest
carrier with 1,040 daily flights, planned to put 75 planes into the
air Sunday. The first of the renewed Latin American routes took off
just before 4 p.m. for Quito, Ecuador, Eastern spokeswoman Virginia
Sanchez said.
   Matell said the shuttle and international routes were considered
the best place to deploy Eastern's limited resources and generate
revenue. A $365 million sale of the shuttle to New York developer
Donald Trump is pending, and Eastern's international routes are
among its most marketable assets.
   Meanwhile, Secretary of Transportation Samuel Skinner said on
CBS' ``Face The Nation'' that the Bush administration considers the
labor dispute ``none of our business'' and has no plans to
intervene. ``We are not in the business of running Eastern Airlines
or negotiating the contract for labor,'' Skinner said.
   Eastern hopes to be up to 140 flights a day by week's end, Matell
said. The highest number of flights in one day since the strike
began March 4 has been 93.
   During the first week of the strike, Eastern maintained one
thrice-weekly flight from Miami to Buenos Aires, Argentina, and
Santiago, Chile, as well as its East Coast shuttle service.
   Eastern's unions have accused Frank Lorenzo, chairman of Eastern
parent Texas Air Corp., of trying to cannibalize the airline. Pilots
and flight attendants unions have honored Machinists' picket lines,
which went up when the 8,500-member union refused to grant $125
million in concessions to the money-losing airline.
   ``Today, Eastern is up and flying,'' company President Phil Bakes
said Sunday in a statement. ``With this, we begin building the great
airline we've always known Eastern could and should be.''
   Bakes was a vice president at Continental Airlines in 1983 when
Lorenzo filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection, as Eastern did
on Thursday in New York.
   Former Eastern Chairman Frank Borman said Sunday on ABC's ``This
Week with David Brinkley that he knew ``of no one in the management
or on the board of Texas Air who wanted bankruptcy.''
   Continental gradually rebuilt its schedule while in bankruptcy
reorganization, but Eastern unions say management won't be helped as
it was at Continental by union workers crossing picket lines.
   Eastern estimated Sunday that out of 3,600 regular pilots it had
200 flying.
   The Air Line Pilots Association said the Latin American routes
are more complicated than the Boston-New York-Washington shuttle,
which had provided nearly all of Eastern's strike service, and it
doubted the company had enough experienced pilots to keep flying
them.
   ALPA also said the company's few pilots will be grounded by
Federal Aviation Administration limits on flying time, such as 30
hours within seven days. Matell said Eastern has had no significant
increase in delays.
   Matell said no decision had been made yet on when to bring in
non-contract workers to replace strikers. The company has 1,500
employees working, having laid off 9,500 non-union workers last week.
   In Atlanta, about 2,000 striking workers and their families
joined for a pep rally near the airport. Lorenzo was the main target
of slogans painted and pasted on shirts, cars, kites and even a dog.
   Matell said Eastern flew 10,200 passengers Saturday, approaching
capacity, and had long lines again Sunday.
   Lawyers for the Machinists plan to go to court this week seeking
an estimated $7.5 million in back wages frozen when the company
filed bankruptcy on payday for most Machinists workers. The pilots'
next paycheck was due March 15.
   ``The only good thing about bankruptcy is that it hinders
(Lorenzo's) ability to slice this thing up like a piece of salami,''
said Rick Chapman, secretary-treasurer of the ALPA local.
   Departures scheduled from Miami starting Sunday were: Bogota,
Colombia; Guatemala City; Lima, Peru; Panama City, Panama; Quito,
Ecuador; Guayaquil, Ecuador; and San Jose, Costa Rica. Thrice-weekly
flights were planned to start later in the week for Asuncion,
Paraguay; Cali, Colombia; and La Paz, Bolivia.
   ``Our loads are looking good,'' said Eastern spokeswoman Virginia
Sanchez, noting heavy passenger turnout for flights to Panama City
and Lima.
   The company also intends to resume thrice-daily flights between
Miami and Puerto Rico on Monday along with service to Montreal, then
add direct flights later this week between Washington and Boston.

   Jim Lossia and Connie Whitmer have
teamed up to clean cars and canines, but some customers bark at
their humor.
   The Walnut Lake Car Wash-Dog Wash in West Bloomfield Township are
side-by-side businesses that share a common sign. But Lossia tells
customers their dirty dogs are welcome to ride through the car wash
he manages perched on top of their cars.
   The joke doesn't wash with everybody, he admitted.
   ``Well, the husbands think it's funny, and some say they wish
they could run their dogs through the car wash,'' he said. ``But
some of the wives are real sensitive about their poodles, and they
don't like the idea.
   ``One lady pulled up with her dog and she just took off when I
said, `Don't worry, we haven't had a death in a couple of years.' ''
   Dog owners who stick around can expect to pay about $20 to have
their pet washed, blown dry, brushed and manicured at Whitmer's
establishment.

   ``Remember Your Car Location! You Have Parked in New York,''
admonish large signs on the fifth floor of one garage. In the
burgundy-tiled elevator vestibule, a piped-in Frank Sinatra belts
out ``New York, New York.''

   ``People historically have kind of looked down on parking
garages,'' said Warshauer, president of Standard Parking Corp. ``You

the lobby, and the garage is a dungeon.''
   The third-generation parking man is changing that.

   ``You could park your car to `Don't Be Cruel' and be listening to
`Blue Suede Shoes' by the time you're at the elevators.'' Warshauer
said.

   Jim Lossia and Connie Whitmer have
teamed up to clean cars and canines, but some customers bark at
their humor.
   The Walnut Lake Car Wash-Dog Wash in West Bloomfield Township are
side-by-side businesses that share a common sign. But Lossia tells
customers their dirty dogs are welcome to ride through the car wash
he manages perched on top of their cars.
   The joke doesn't wash with everybody, he admitted.
   ``Well, the husbands think it's funny, and some say they wish
they could run their dogs through the car wash,'' he said. ``But
some of the wives are real sensitive about their poodles, and they
don't like the idea.
   ``One lady pulled up with her dog and she just took off when I
said, `Don't worry, we haven't had a death in a couple of years.' ''
   Dog owners who stick around can expect to pay about $20 to have
their pet washed, blown dry, brushed and manicured at Whitmer's
establishment.

<HEAD>Party Meeting Exposes Key Differences In Politburo</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: SUBS last graf to CLARIFY that Ligachev chairs a party agricultural
commission, not a government body.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARK J. PORUBCANSKY</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   The Communist Party will tackle critical food
shortages in a special meeting this week that comes amid signs
President Mikhail S. Gorbachev and Politburo rival Yegor K. Ligachev
disagree on the solution.
   The hottest issue on the agenda of the 300-member Central
Committee is Gorbachev's desire to lease state-owned fields to
farmers.
   In recent appearances, Ligachev has skipped lightly over leasing
and emphasized collective farming _ the traditional system that has
left Soviet consumers standing in line for meat and vegetables.
   At the meeting Wednesday and Thursday, the policy-making Central
Committee is likely to agree on the need to ease the poverty and
isolation of rural life. It also is expected to order the
dismantling, at least partially, of an agricultural superministry
formed in 1985.
   In what appeared to be part of a campaign leading to action
against the superministry, the Communist Party daily Pravda on March
6 reprinted citizens' complaints the agency is bureaucratic,
ineffective and useless.
   The Central Committee also will formally elect the 100 Communist
Party members nominated for the nation's new 2,250-member Congress
of People's Deputies.
   But the meeting's major task is to overcome divisions at the
highest levels and to take bold action on the worsening shortages
that could derail Gorbachev's entire reform program.
   The ``food problem,'' as it is known in the Soviet Union, means:
   _Long lines for limited products of poor quality.
   _A diet that includes twice as many potatoes and 50 percent more
sugar than Americans eat, but roughly half the fruit and meat.
   _A distribution system that lets three out of four potatoes rot
before they reach the table.
   _A grain harvest of 195 million tons in 1988 _ well below targets
_ that required the Soviet Union to spend precious foreign currency
to import 36 million tons.
   _Migration to the cities to escape the inadequacies of rural
education, housing, roads, goods and services.
   ``Today, comrades, the most critical question is,
unconditionally, supplying the population, normalization of the
demands of the market,'' Gorbachev said in a speech in Kiev last
month.
   ``Of all the problems of supplies to the population, the most
urgent is food,'' he said.
   Gorbachev has enthusiastically endorsed the idea of allowing
families to obtain land under long-term leases from the collective
and state farms. He says it will give farmers greater security and
incentive.
   In an effort to boost the idea, official newspapers abound with
reports like the following, published in Moscow News:
   Nikolai Sysolyatin took a lease from a state farm in the Kirov
region and began raising 110 steers. ``With the help of wives and
children, the team mowed grass at night, the best time for that. In
contrast, 50 percent of the fodder at the state farm rotted,'' it
said.
   But Sysolyatin was driven out of business by suspicious
neighbors, because the bloody experience of collectivization in the
1930s made peasants distrustful of individual initiative, Moscow
News said. Sysolyatin left 30 steers bellowing with hunger when he
moved to the city.
   Gorbachev insisted to his Kiev audience that ideology is less
important than results.
   ``We must open the door to anyone who is capable of radically
changing the situation,'' he said. ``No stereotypes and dogmas must
stand in the way of deciding the food problem.''
   In January, Gorbachev complained that bureaucrats and neighbors
who drove the likes of Sysolyatin out of business viewed them as
``Rockefellers'' seeking to get rich at the expense of others.
   Ligachev's recent statements praising collective farming stand
out in stark contrast.
   In a visit to review farm policy in Czechoslovakia, Ligachev told
Soviet television, ``We have become convinced one more time that the
basis for any progress in food programs is actually development of
collective forms of management, such as collective farms and state
farms, along with a steady development of self-financing.''
   A week earlier in a speech in the Siberian city of Omsk, Ligachev
said improving social conditions in rural villages was the key
question. He gave only passing mention to leasing.
   Improving village life ``for us, is the question of questions,''
Ligachev said.
   Ligachev was the No. 2 figure in the Politburo and considered a
conservative counterforce to Gorbachev until Gorbachev demoted him.
In September, Ligachev became chairman of the party's agricultural
commission.

   The dollar rose against the Japanese yen in Tokyo on
Monday, but stock prices closed lower as investors reacted to
concern over rising U.S. inflation.
   After opening higher at 129.38 yen, the dollar continued to post
gains, finishing the day's dealings at 129.57 yen, up 0.69 yen from
Friday's close of 128.88 yen. It moved in a range of 129.38-129.63.
   On the Tokyo Stock Exchange, the Nikkei Stock Average of 225
selected issues, a 45.33-point gainer Friday, shed 148.82 points, or
0.47 percent, to move to 31,552.96 by the close of the trading day.
   ``The dollar opened stronger in reaction to gains in New York
last Friday,'' said a dealer with the Mitsubishi Bank in Tokyo.
   ``But trading lost steam as investors took to the sidelines ahead
of the release of Wednesday's U.S. trade figures for February,'' he
said, speaking with the condition he not be identified.
   The dollar strengthened in New York Friday when the U.S. Labor
Department reported that non-farm payrolls added 289,000 jobs in
February and civilian unemployment fell to 5.1 percent from the
previous month for the lowest level since December 1973.
   That in turn fueled speculation the U.S. Federal Reserve would
increase interest rates to cool down the economy in a tightening
labor market, creating the prospect of higher interest rates and a
more attractive dollar for foreign investors.
   But stock traders in Tokyo said shares fell as investors reacted
to concern that higher interest rates would in turn spark U.S.
inflation.
   Shares of light electronics and shipbuilders held firm in the
first section of the exchange, while others fell almost across the
board, according to traders.

<HEAD>Barry Levinson Wins Directors Guild Award For `Rain Man'</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BEVERLY HILLS, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Barry Levinson said the acting of
Dustin Hoffman and Tom Cruise in ``Rain Man'' helped him win this
year's best film direction award by the Directors Guild of America.
   ``Unless you get performances on the screen, all else will
fail,'' Levinson said in accepting the award Saturday night.
   Only three times in 41 years has the guild's award been different
from the Academy Award for directing. The Oscar presentations are
March 29.
   ``Rain Man'' concerns an autistic savant and his hustling young
brother, played respectively by Hoffman and Cruise, who are on a
cross-country journey of discovery.
   Levinson assumed direction of the film after Steven Spielberg,
Sydney Pollack and Martin Brest had undertaken the project and
abandoned it.
   The guild's 9,000 members selected Levinson over four other
nominees: Alan Parker of the controversial civil-rights film
``Mississippi Burning''; Robert Zemeckis, who engineered the
animated-live action blockbuster ``Who Framed Roger Rabbit'';
Charles Crichton, director of the crime-caper comedy ``A Fish Called
Wanda''; and Mike Nichols, who brought the corporate Cinderella saga
``Working Girl'' to the screen.
   Zemeckis is the only guild nominee not nominated for the best
director Oscar. In Zemeckis' place, the Academy of Motion Picture
Arts and Sciences nominated Martin Scorsese, director of the ``The
Last Temptation of Christ,'' which has been criticized by religious
groups as blasphemous.

   Dissident public school teachers are scheduled
to meet in the capital next weekend to discuss a possible nationwide
strike in their demand for a salary increase, the Excelsior news
service said Sunday.
   Excelsior quoted Teodoro Palomino, head of the dissident National
Schoolteachers Coordinate, as saying teachers have tentatively
scheduled a strike for April 17.
   Palomino reportedly called the proposed strike a ``defensive,
desperate action.''
   The dissident teachers have held three massive marches in Mexico
City in the past month to demand a 100 percent salary increase and
the ouster of a labor boss they call corrupt and inept. Teachers
make aboout $170 a month.
   An estimated 50,000 teachers on Tuesday took part in the latest
march, which snarled traffic and closed about 3,800 schools in the
capital.
   There were other scattered one-day walkouts nationwide.
   The dissidents blame the longtime head of the teachers' union,
Carlos Jongitud Barrios, for their plight. They say Jongitud has
used his 17 years as union leader to amass power and a personal
fortune instead of improving the lot of teachers.
   They are an estimated 1.2 million public school teachers who are
members of the National Union of Education Workers. The coordinate
is made up of union members, but is not recognized by the government.

<HEAD>Chief Opposition Negotiator Says Future of Political Accord Uncertain</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The opposition's chief negotiator says
political reforms laid out during five weeks of talks with the
government are ``hanging by a hair'' because of apparent resistance
by Communist hardliners.
   Historian Bronislaw Geremek said Sunday that his side had
received a government draft on a new electoral procedure that lacked
``basic political decisions that we had agreed upon.
   ``Is it that someone simply forgot about them? Or maybe there are
forces on the other side that are strong enough to block the whole
contract,'' he said.
   The opposition received the draft Saturday, and Geremek made his
comments Sunday at a meeting of the opposition's Citizens Committee.
   The committee gathered to evaluate progress in the historic talks
on reinstating the banned Solidarity free trade union movement and
salvaging the battered economy. The opposition is demanding free
elections, greater access to the media and a say in the formation of
economic policy.
   Hearing the report by Geremek, Citizens Committee members adopted
a statement calling for ``full realization of Solidarity's demands''
and expressing concern at ``the apparent tendency by the government
side to limit democratic changes.''
   ``A dozen days before the end of the round-table talks, it seems
that the whole deal is hanging by a hair,'' Geremek told the
gathering.
   Solidarity spokesman Janusz Onyszkiewicz, at a news conference
Sunday, also spoke about some points missing in the draft, but he
said it was too early to raise an alarm.
   Neither he nor Geremek said what agreements might be lacking in
the draft.
   The 120-member Citizens' Committee was formed last year by
Solidarity chairman Lech Walesa to bring together leaders of the
main opposition groups.
   On Thursday, government negotiators agreed to democratic
elections for a revived Senate and that 35 percent of the 460 seats
in the Sejm, the present unicameral parliament, could be open to
independent candidates.
   It has not been determined how many seats or how much power the
Senate will have. In return for the Senate, the opposition agreed to
the creation to a strenghthened presidency whose occupant would have
the power to dissolve the legislature.
   Elections are tentatively scheduled for June 4.
   The ruling Communist Party's 230-member Central Committee is
expected to ratify, either this week or next week, the agreements
made at the negotiations.
   Both sides have said a pact on the talks should be signed by
April 3.
   Poland's leader, Gen. Wojciech Jaruzelski, told supporters
Saturday that they must be ready to stand ``face-to-face in a
democratic test'' in the elections, the official PAP news agency
reported Sunday.
   It said Jaruzelski, addressing more than 2,500 party officials,
told them their job ``is not only mobilizing people to come to the
polling boxes anymore.''
   The goal is ``to elect the best so that those best are our people
_ members of the party, members of allied parties, non-party members
_ really independent but standing on the ground of socialism,'' he
said according to the text distributed by PAP.
   Solidarity, legally chartered in the fall of 1980 as the first
free union movement in the Soviet bloc, was crushed by a December
1981 military crackdown and outlawed the following year.

   A dozen descendants of Massachusetts pioneer
William Bradford are making a pilgrimage to Britain to celebrate the
birth of their ancestor, who fled to the New World four centuries
ago in search religious freedom.
   ``Everybody's very excited, I think it's a once-in-a-lifetime
thing,'' said Marion Vuilleumier, the 11th great-granddaughter of
Bradford and an organizer of the trip.
   The group, members of a descendant's society called the Gov.
William Bradford Compact, are leaving Tuesday for Austerfield,
Yorkshire.
   The celebration of Bradford's 399th birthday will be held there
Sunday and is expected to draw representatives of Queen Elizabeth II
and the American embassy.
   The homecoming was arranged after Ms. Vuilleumier visited
Austerfield and learned that a celebration was planned for March 19,
which is believed to be Bradford's birthday.
   Bradford, who sailed for America aboard the Mayflower, was among
a group of people seeking to separate from the Church of England.
The group formed what later would become the Congregationalist
movement.
   He was the second governor of the Plymouth Colony, which was
established in 1620, and is best remembered for his chronicle of the
settlement. ``Of Plymouth Plantation,'' is a primary source for the
history of Massachusetts colonists, said Jeff Scotland, a spokesman
for the Plimoth Plantation museum devoted to Massachusetts' early
history.
   Bradford, who died in 1657, and his co-religionists found
religious freedom by establishing a community under their own,
sometimes rigid, rules, said Scotland, who occasionally portrays
Bradford at the museum.
   ``It takes a lot of courage to cross the Atlantic in a leaky boat
and to carve out a home in the wilderness,'' Scotland said. ``To be
so principled that you're willing to do that just so you can worship
without being thrown in jail, that makes a statement.''
   The Bradford Compact, formed about 40 years ago, has about 400
members and holds annual meetings in Plymouth.
   Ms. Vuilleumier said the British recognition of Bradford's
historic status seems a fitting ending to the centuries-old rift
with the Mother Country.
   ``I think he would have been pleased to see it,'' she said. ``He
would have been very pleased to be vindicated.''

<TEXT>
   On April 16, 1968, Army Capt. Thomas Jay
Hayes IV was killed in Vietnam after dragging two wounded comrades
to safety as enemy forces overwhelmed his platoon.
   On Sunday, Hayes became the latest fallen hero to have a building
on the West Point campus renamed in his honor.
   As his classmates from the West Point Class of '66 gathered for
the dedication ceremony in the spotless gymnasium previously known
as the East Gym, they reminisced about Hayes' leadership, heroism
and potential for greatness _ the qualities that led the academy to
rename the gym in his memory.
   ``He inspired all of us,'' said classmate John Wheeler, former
secretary of the Securities and Exchange Commission and president of
the Washington-based Center for the Vietnam Generation.
   ``We knew this guy would (have been) a statesman _ not just a
soldier, but a statesman _ and that gave us an extra boost,'' said
Col. C. Hilton Dunn Jr., now assigned to the Army Corps of Engineers.
   Several other buildings on the campus, which lies 50 miles north
of New York City, have also been named after West Point graduates
who, like Hayes, showed exceptional leadership as a cadet, excelled
in athletics or some area of study, and were killed in action.
   A few weeks ago, a different gymnasium was named after Carl
Robert Arvin, Class of '65, who died in Vietnam at age 24. More men
will be honored in the same way, said Wheeler.
   The program to name buildings after the fallen heroes was
initiated by West Point's commander, Gen. David Palmer.
   ``He's updating West Point by bringing the best of our past into
the present,'' said Wheeler. ``By finding men like Tommy (Hayes),
he's re-igniting at West Point the light of inspiration.''
   Wheeler, who counted Hayes among his best friends, said he
researched Hayes' death until he was satisfied that he knew exactly
what had happened.
   ``His platoon was helicoptered into a landing zone and instantly
hit by a huge force of overwhelming enemy fire,'' Wheeler recalled.
``It was daylight hours, and they were terribly exposed. ... He
dragged one wounded man back to safety and then another back to
safety.''
   The men he rescued lived, but Hayes was shot and killed on the
spot.
   Hayes, whose father and grandfather attended West Point, had been
ninth in his class. Nearly all of Hayes' 579 classmates went to
Vietnam; 30 died there, more than any other class, said Wheeler.
   Hayes was sent over as an engineer to handle battlefield
construction, but instead volunteered for infantry duty. After his
yearlong Vietnam tour was over, he signed up for another. He was
killed halfway through it at age 26 _ ``an old man'' considering the
average age of a soldier in Vietnam was 19, said Wheeler.
   ``It was tough. It was almost like losing a brother,'' Robert
Kesmodel, now a Baltimore businessman, said of learning that Hayes
had died.
   Col. Mac Hayes, now a West Point regiment commander, was in
Vietnam when he read in Stars and Stripes that his classmate had
been killed.
   ``It's always a devastating thing to find out,'' said Hayes, who
was not related to Thomas Hayes. ``The people who tended to do
things and be leaders unfortunately were the casualties'' because
they served on the front lines.
   Wheeler said the survivors share an intense, triple bond: ``It's
Vietnam and (the) Tet (Offensive of '68); then burying the most
killed from any class (in Vietnam); then coming home and feeling so
alone.''
   But he said Sunday's reunion ``took another bite out of the
unnecessary bitterness and pain that our country feels from the war
in Vietnam ... by affirming the integrity in Tom's life and the
choices he made.''

   A strong earthquake struck near Acapulco,
Mexico, authorities said today.
   The quake struck at 9:09 p.m. Sunday MST and was centered 50
miles northeast of the Mexican resort, said Russ Needham, a
geophysicist at the U.S. Geological Survey's National Earthquake
Information Center.
   The tremor measured 5.5 on the Richter scale, he said, but added,
``I would not expect any damage out of it.''
   The Richter scale is a measure of ground motion as recorded on
seismographs. Every increase of one number means a tenfold increase
in magnitude.
   An earthquake of magnitude 3.5 can cause slight damage in the
local area, 4 moderate damage, 5 considerable damage, 6 severe
damage. A 7 reading is a ``major'' earthquake, capable of widespread
heavy damage; 8 is a ``great'' quake, capable of tremendous damage.

   An Air Force Reserve helicopter crashed and
burned Sunday during a night training mission, killing 12 people
aboard and leaving three missing, officials said.
   The twin-engine CH-3E ``Jolly Green Giant'' helicopter was flying
with another chopper from Davis-Monthan Air Force to the Air Force's
Gila Bend Gunnery Range when it went down at about 7:45 p.m.,
according to a base spokesman, Capt. Mark Besich.
   The crashed occurred in an uninhabited area 20 miles north of
Tucson.
   ``I looked up and I seen a yellow ball, like flames, coming out
of the back,'' said Mike Skreka. ``About four seconds later it hit
the ground.''
   Emergency crews from Davis-Monthan and Tucson International
Airport were dispatched to the scene.
   Twelve people were pronounced dead at the crash site and three
others were unaccounted for and presumed dead, said Pima County
Sheriff's Sgt. Tom Taylor.
   An unidentified sheriff's office dispatcher said another witness
told deputies that he ``heard a loud pop and then saw it go down.''
   The dispatcher said the second helicopter continued flying on to
Ryan Field, a small airport about 25 miles west of Tucson.
   Besich said the CH-3E helicopter usually carries a crew of four
and has a capacity of 22 passengers. He said he knew nothing about
the people aboard the Vietnam-era helicopter that crashed, or how
many may have been injured.
   Both helicopters are assigned to the 71st Special Operations
Squadron at Davis-Monthan, he said.
   The site of the crash was about half-way between Marana, Ariz.,
and Avra Valley, Ariz., according to Besich.
   He said Air Force officials launched another helicopter to fly to
the crash site, but he had few details about what that crew had
learned.
   The 71st Special Operations Squadron was known as the 302nd
Squadron, and based at Luke Air Force Base near Phoenix, until June
1987 when it was transferred to Davis-Monthan, Besich said.
   The CH-3E ``Jolly Green Giant,'' which was most noted for its use
in combat rescues during the Vietnam War, is made by Sikorsky,
according to Jane's All The World's Aircraft. But Boeing makes
several Chinook helicopters with the CH-designation.

<HEAD>Sudan Cabinet Resigns, Mahdi Seeks To Form New Government</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DALIA BALIGH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>KHARTOUM, Sudan (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government of Prime Minister Sadek
Mahdi has resigned under pressure from the military in a move that
could open the way for peace talks with rebels in the south.
   The State Council, Sudan's collective presidency, accepted the
resignation on Sunday and Mahdi began trying to form a new Cabinet.
   Newspaper reports indicated Mahdi, who submitted the resignation
late Saturday, faced a struggle in creating a Cabinet and it was
uncertain when a new government might be formed.
   The reports said the armed forces were insisting on two seats in
what had been a 21-member Cabinet, but Mahdi had not offered them
any. They said Mahdi is trying to neutralize the military' power by
bargaining with trade unions and professional associations.
   Army officers, joined by unions and some political groups, issued
an ultimatum three weeks ago for Mahdi to create a broad-based
government and open peace talks with the Sudan People's Liberation
Army after six years of civil war.
   Mahdi's Umma Party was dominant in the old Cabinet and its junior
party was the National Islamic Front, a Moslem fundamentalist party.
   Newspapers said the National Islamic Front is not expected to
take part in a new government because of disputes over Islamic law.
Islamic law is in force, but it has been largely ignored and its
penalties have not been enforced since the 1985 ouster of dictator
Gaafar Nimeiri.
   Many people in southern Sudan are Christians or animists. They
oppose Islamic law and the Khartoum government, which is controlled
by predominantly Moslem north Sudan.
   The southern rebels demand more autonomy and greater shares in
aid and development programs.
   Mahdi has been facing his worst political crisis since he became
head of the government after general elections in April 1986.
   The centrist Democratic Unionist Party was the second-largest
party in Mahdi's coalition until they walked out in January to
protest the government's economic policies and Mahdi's refusal to
bring a peace plan before the Cabinet. Mahdi then formed a new
Cabinet with the National Islamic Front.
   Ten days ago, Mahdi and representatives of 65 political groups
and unions agreed to a proposed new government and peace overtures
toward the rebels. But the Islamic Front rejected the plan, saying
it jeopardized Islamic law.

<HEAD>Dollar Rises, Stocks Down</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The dollar continued to rise against the Japanese
yen in Tokyo today, and stock prices declined because of a spreading
political stock scandal and worry about higher U.S. inflation,
traders said.
   After opening at 129.38 yen, its low for the day, the dollar
finished trading at 129.57 yen, up 0.69 yen from Friday's closing of
128.88 yen. Its highest level during the day was 129.63 yen.
   On the Tokyo Stock Exchange, the 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average
fell 148.82 points, or 0.47 percent, closing the day at 31,552.96.
On Friday the index gained 45.33 points.
   An estimated 550 million shares were traded on the exchange's
first section, down from 915 million shares on Friday.
   ``There's the Recruit scandal and concern of higher inflation in
the United States and here as well,'' said a trader with Nomura
Securities Co., Japan's largest brokerage.
   Parliamentary debate on Japan's budget for next fiscal year
remained stalled today as opposition parties demanded that former
Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone testify on his links to a
stock-profiteering scandal that has shaken Japanese politics.
   In the scandal, Recruit Co., an information services
conglomerate, allegedly provided bargain-priced shares in a
subsidiary to influential politicians and business leaders in
exchange for special favors.
   The scandal has led to the resignation of three Cabinet
ministers, and news reports today said 15 governing-party
legislators have received Recruit funds since the scandal surfaced.
   The Nomura trader, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said
investors were concerned that U.S. inflation may rise if the U.S.
Federal Reserve raises interest rates following Friday's release of
lower unemployment figures for February.
   He said stock prices also declined because of the upcoming end of
the Japanese fiscal year. ``We'll be more sure of the market's
actual direction later this week or at the start of next week,'' he
said.
   Many Japanese businesses begin their fiscal year April 1.
   The dollar rose quickly in early Tokyo trading following gains in
New York on Friday due to the unemployment report and prospects of
higher U.S. interest rates, which would make the dollar more
attractive to foreign investors, traders said. It then slowed during
the afternoon.
   ``Trading lost steam as investors took to the sidelines ahead of
the release Wednesday of U.S. trade figures for February,'' said a
dealer with a major commercial bank in Tokyo.

<HEAD>French Quebecers Protest for Language Rights</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MONTREAL (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   More than 50,000 demonstrators, many waving
Quebec flags and shouting ``French Quebec,'' marched through the
city's streets in one of the biggest outpourings of French Canadian
nationalism in years.
   The mood was generally friendly, but one placard proclaimed:
``Death to anglophones.''
   Organizers, who had expected only 25,000 people to participate,
were jubilant over Sunday's turnout in sunny, but extremely cold
weather.
   ``The message is great,'' said Guy Bouthillier, spokesman for the
Movement for a French Quebec. ``It's obvious these people want to
have back their Law 101.''
   The group organized the protest march in support of the
nationalist language law passed in 1977 by the Quebecer Party that
provincial Premier Robert Bourassa amended last December.
   The demonstrators want the Quebec legislature, which reconvenes
Tuesday, to return to a law allowing businesses to post signs only
in French. Bourassa decided to permit some bilingual signs inside
the businesses, though only French can be used outside.
   ``Considering the size of the demonstration, I think it will make
(Bourassa) think about a few things,'' said Quebecer Party leader
Jacques Parizeau, who marched with the crowd.
   Some of the marchers draped themselves in the province's
fleur-de-lys flag, and others carried placards with slogans like
``The Humiliation Has Lasted Long Enough'' and ``Quebec for
Quebecers.''
   The march ended with a rally at City Hall.
   Roughly 80 percent of Quebec's 6.5 million people are
Francophones. They say they have long been locked out of good jobs
and other benefits by English speakers.
   Jacques St. Amant, who marched with his two children, said he
wanted to ``sensitize them to the fact that French Quebec might
disappear.''
   His 9-year-old daughter Christine, who plans to become a French
teacher, nodded and said, ``French is important for me. ''
   Although the marchers were predominantly French-Canadian, a
number of English speakers and foreign immigrants turned out to
offer their support as well.

<TEXT>
   When Christian and animist refugees first
began to trickle into this dusty little Moslem town, residents
greeted them in the spirit of charity.
   Today, many look upon the newcomers as a threat.
   ``The locals received their brothers when they were in bad
condition. But when they became well, they compete for jobs. So,
yes, there is friction between them,'' said Abdel-Rasoul Nour,
governor of Darfour region.
   The refugees arrive in this Moslem-dominated town of 20,000 at a
rate of up to 300 a day. They have trekked northward, within 460
miles of the capital of Khartoum, in search of food and of safety
from civil war between Moslem northerners and the Christian and
animist southerners.
   This nation's twin scourges of fighting and famine have reduced
hundreds of thousands of Sudanese to homeless nomads who survive
mainly through the good graces of international relief groups.
   About 2.25 million people live in southern Sudan. Last year, up
to 500,000 perished from war and related causes. Many starved to
death in isolated villages.
   During the last summer rainy season, between 1,000 and 2,000
refugees died in Muglad, according to Mark Cunningham of the
Irish-based Concern relief organization. More than half of them were
children, he said.
   Now, about 12,000 people live here as outsiders, and 10,000 more
are expected before the next rainy season.
   Muglad, like the government in Khartoum, is mainly Arab Moslem.
The displaced newcomers represent an array of African cultures.
   The southern rebels are fighting for more autonomy from the north
and a greater share of the country's wealth.
   The first refugees trudged into Muglad last April. Most have come
from Aweil, about 150 miles away in the embattled Bahr el-Ghazal
region.
   They walked along train tracks, eating shrubs and finding very
little water. Many of the weak and sick died along the way.
   But those arriving look relatively strong. Only a few show
reddish-orange hair, a sign of malnutrition.
   They live in a makeshift camp on the outskirts of town in stick
huts covered with plastic sheets.
   Only a few have found local jobs. Most are totally dependent on
food and water distributed by Concern.
   As a group of journalists toured the camp, refugees in rags with
copper bands around their arms and ankles performed a traditional
southern dance.
   But they had changed the words to fit their new lives:
   ``Our homes are destroyed, and we have gone hungry. Life has
become very difficult. We wish we could go home. We wish there could
be peace and we could go home.''

   Bill Cosby and ``The Cosby Show'' swept
the People's Choice Awards with five honors, and the TV sitcom
``Roseanne'' and the film ``Rain Man'' also were viewers' favorites.
   Cosby was voted favorite male televison performer, all-around
male star and his NBC series won favorite comedy in the 15th annual
edition of the entertainment popularity contest conducted by a
nationwide Gallup Organization poll.
   ``The Cosby Show'' also won all-time favorite television show
honors, edging out longer-running hits ``M-A-S-H' and ``Star Trek,''
while ``Cosby'' co-star Phylicia Rashad was picked as favorite
female television performer.
   ``It's certainly gratifying to know that you and the work you do
are appreciated by the people,'' Miss Rashad said backstage.
   Cosby was not at the awards ceremony at Walt Disney Studios but
thanked the public in a videotaped message that showed him in bed on
``The Cosby Show'' set.
   The two-hour awards show was broadcast nationally with Michael
Landon and Michele Lee as hosts.
   The ABC-TV situation comedy ``Roseanne,'' which portrays the life
of a blue-collar mother, was another big favorite, winning three
awards.
   ``Roseanne'' star Roseanne Barr was voted favorite female
performer in a new television series, the show won for new
television comedy series and co-star John Goodman was voted favorite
male performer in a new television series.
   ``I'd like to accept this award on behalf of all the working moms
and housewives,'' said Miss Barr.
   ABC's ``China Beach'' won for new television dramatic series and
NBC's ``L.A. Law'' was selected as favorite television dramatic
series.
   Kirk Cameron of ABC-TV's ``Growing Pains'' was selected favorite
young television performer.
   The World War II saga ``War and Remembrance,'' ABC's
globe-spanning story of a family torn by World War II, won for best
miniseries despite its disappointing ratings.
   It was selected over ``Elvis and Me'' and ``Favorite Son,'' but
was not against CBS' block-busting miniseries ``Lonesome Dove,''
which was not included because it was broadcast in 1989.
   In film categories, Dustin Hoffman was voted favorite actor in a
dramatic motion picture and his ``Rain Man'' won as favorite
dramatic motion picture. Cher was voted favorite all-around female
star.
   ``I think people know that I'm trying. I think people know I'm
always working on it and I have a modicum of talent and I
survived,'' said Cher backstage, explaining her popularity.
   ``Big'' and ``Twins'' tied for favorite comedy, while Eddie
Murphy and Bette Midler were chosen as favorite male and female
actors in comedy motion pictures.
   Meryl Streep was voted favorite actress in a dramatic motion
picture, and ``Gone With The Wind'' captured all-time favorite
motion picture honors.
   In music, Michael Jackson's ``Smooth Criminal'' received favorite
music video honors, country singer Randy Travis was voted favorite
male musical performer and last year's female winner, Whitney
Houston, once again received favorite female musical performer
honors.

<TEXT>
   A hotly debated art exhibit that has a U.S. flag
lying on a floor touched off a protest by about 2,500 veterans and
supporters and a clash that led to the arrests of at least four,
police said.
   Before the scuffle, police arrested two men who described
themselves as art students as they stenciled American flags on the
sidewalks around the museum building. They were charged with
criminal damage to property.
   During Sunday's demonstration outside the Art Institute of
Chicago, a group of veterans attacked about a dozen students who
were holding a counter-demonstration. They swung fists, threw hot
coffee and shouted at the students to leave the country. Police
intervened, and no one was injured.
   Police said at least one veteran was arrested on battery charges
and three students were charged with disorderly conduct. The
confrontation was broken up after police led the students to a
corner about two blocks away from the veterans, and kept the groups
apart.
   In front of the institute, the veterans, who came from at least
nine states, chanted, ``One, two, three, four, get the flag off the
floor.''
   ``I just think it's a sin to have the flag on the floor,'' said
Michael Boorsma, 38, a Vietnam veteran from suburban Batavia. ``It
bothers me tremendously.''
   Veterans also came from Wisconsin, West Virginia, Michigan,
Indiana, Oklahoma, New York, Vermont, and Arkansas. They waved
hundreds of flags, including some with the Revolutionary War motto
``Don't tread on me.''
   The demonstration was the biggest in a series of protests over a
student art exhibit titled ``What is the Proper Way to Display a
U.S. Flag?'' The exhibit includes the flag lying on the floor
beneath a shelf where visitors can write comments in two ledger
books. Veterans contend that the placement of the flag invites
viewers to step on it.
   Student-artist ``Dread'' Scott Tyler said he had no apologies for
his exhibit, which he described as revolutionary.
   In the counter-protest, one of the art students carried a poster
showing Adolf Hitler, Ayatollah Khomeini and Republican mayoral
candidate Edward Vrdolyak, a supporter of the veterans' protests,
with the caption: ``Art Critic _ Get rid of degenerate art.''
   A second group of counter-demonstrators, about 20 primarily older
artists, stood near the veterans under heavy police guard. They
carried empty picture frames on sticks to show that the exhibit
being protested was essentially ``empty'' of artistic merit, but
that the right to free expression should be upheld, they said.
   The exhibit, which includes art by 66 minority students, opened
on Feb. 17.
   Earlier this month, a judge rejected a lawsuit by veterans'
groups contending that the artwork desecrated the flag.
   The gallery was opened to the public for a few minutes Sunday
morning, but was closed after veterans repeatedly picked up the
flag, said security guard Alicia Lloyd.

   The dollar was mixed in early European trading
today, upward movement checked by fear of central bank intervention
and a lack of incentive to move before Wednesday's release of new
U.S. trade figures, foreign currency dealers said.
   Gold prices fell slightly.
   Dealers said factors pointing to a higher dollar include
speculation about rising U.S. interest rates following surprisingly
strong February employment figures.
   But the market is too afraid of central banks to push the dollar
aggressively higher, said Bernd Hartwig, chief dealer of
Norddeutsche Landesbank Girozentrale in Hanover, West Germany.
   ``One can assume that interest rate speculation will take the
dollar higher, but the fear of central banks is very much present,''
he said.
   A dealer at a large Frankfurt bank said ``the next point to look
for are the U.S. trade figures.''
   In Tokyo, where trading ends before Europe's business day begins,
the dollar rose 0.69 yen to a closing 129.57. Later, in London, it
was quoted at 129.75 yen.
   Other dollar rates at midmorning, compared with late Friday:
   _1.8640 West German marks, up from 1.8629
   _1.5915 Swiss francs, down from 1.5918
   _6.3215 French francs, up from 6.3185
   _2.1048 Dutch guilders, up from 2.1020
   _1,367.00 Italian lire, up from 1,306.00
   _1.1972 Canadian dollars, down from 1.1987
   In London, one British pound cost $1.7175, slightly more
expensive for buyers than $1.7159 Friday.
   Gold opened in London at a bid price of $393.25 a troy ounce,
unchanged from late Friday. At midmorning, the city's five major
bullion dealers fixed a recommended price of $393.10.
   In Zurich, the bid price was $392.90, down from $393.50 bid late
Friday.
   Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold fell 30 cents to close at a bid
$394.85.
   Silver was quoted in London at a bid price of $6.05 a troy ounce,
up from Friday's $6.00.

   A reported U.S. plan to quell the Palestinian
uprising in Israel's occupied territories is unacceptable because it
calls on the PLO to surrender its only weapon for swaying public
opinion, Palestinian leaders said.
   At a Mideast peace symposium here, the Palestinians also urged
the United States to back an independent state for their people as
part of a stepped-up international peace effort. They spoke on the
second day of a three-day symposium at Columbia University.
   Several left-wing Israeli legislators and prominent Jewish
leaders attending the symposium predicted the reported U.S. plan
would fail if it didn't offer a permanent solution for reconciling
the demands of Israel and the Palestine Liberation Organization.
   The New York Times reported Sunday that the Bush administration
plans to propose that Israel and the PLO take steps to ease tension
in the Israeli-occupied territories.
   U.S. officials plan to ask Israel to release some of the
Palestinians arrested during the 15-month uprising, end or limit
detentions and reopen schools in the territories, the newspaper
said, quoting an unidentified senior administration official.
   The U.S. initiatives also would call on the PLO to halt violent
demonstrations in the territories, block anti-Israeli raids from
southern Lebanon and stop distributing inflammatory leaflets, the
newspaper said.
   ``These demands are unbalanced, unfair,'' said Faisal Husseini,
director of the Arab Studies Center in East Jerusalem and a
Palestinian leader in the occupied territories.
   ``They are asking us to stop the demonstrations,'' he said of the
reported U.S. proposals, while Israel was being asked ``the
minimum.''
   Nabil Shaath, chairman of the Political Committee of the
Palestine National Council, said the United States first should
endorse a separate Palestinian state as part of a peace plan.
   ``Let's put the horse where it should be and the cart where it
should be, and the horse is the peace arrangement,'' said Shaath,
whose council is the legislative arm of the PLO. ``What is not
negotiable is the final result, an independent Palestinian state
side by side with the state of Israel.''
   David Susskind, vice president of the Jewish Coordinating
Committee for Belgium, said Jews in Europe and the United States
must pressure Israeli leaders to accept a Palestinian state.
   ``Israel needs the solidarity of the Jewish people,'' he said.
   Yossi Sarid, a member of the left-wing Citizens Rights Movement
in Israel's Knesset, or parliament, said the Bush proposals will
fail if the administration plans only ``an interim agreement,''
without addressing the final status between Israel and the PLO.
   But a Jewish-American lawyer who met with PLO chairman Yasser
Arafat in Sweden last year welcomed the reported U.S. plan and said
the PLO still needs to show Israelis that it can make all its
factions abide by its pledge last year to refrain from terrorism.
   ``The biggest problem that is confronting the PLO at this point
from both the Israeli and American point of view is that it isn't
clear to those two parties ... that the PLO can control the
situation,'' said Rita Hauser, citing recent incursions by PLO
guerrillas into Israel's self-declared security zone in south
Lebanon.

   More firefighters were
recruited to battle the biggest blaze in this park's 45-year history
after it blackened 615 acres of oak, pine and juniper woodlands.
   A helicopter flight over the fire Sunday evening revealed it
covered much less than the 1,200 acres estimated earlier.
   ``That actually puts us in better shape, but it's still the
largest fire in the park's history and it probably will keep
spreading for a couple of days before we get it under control,''
said park spokesman Jim Paxon.
   ``Unless winds pick up, we should get a good handle on this thing
Monday. Then I'd say it should be a couple more days before it's
under control. That's if we don't get any winds.''
   The National Weather Service forecast temperatures in the 90s
with light winds and no precipitation for the southwest Texas area
during the next few days.
   More than 100 firefighters from the U.S. Forest Service, the Park
Service, the Bureau of Land Management and the New Mexico Department
of Forestry battled the fire Sunday. Paxon said about 160 additional
personnel had been requested from the Inter-agency Fire Center in
Boise, Idaho, to fight the blaze.
   Officials also planned to use three helicopters to dump water on
hot spots in the fire, which is burning in the High Chisos mountains
of this Rhode Island-size park along the Rio Grande.
   No injuries were reported and no structures were in danger,
authorities said.
   But fire officials were concerned about a pair of Peregrine
falcon nests within 1{ miles of the flames. Paxon said the nests,
which shelter at least four of the endangered birds, weren't at risk
from the flames but would be protected if winds shifted.
   The blaze was believed to have been started by human
carelessness, authorities said.
   About 100 campers, mostly college students on spring break, were
evacuated when the blaze was reported by hikers Saturday. The area's
seven hiking trails also were closed.

<HEAD>Three Years After Clemency, Convicted Cop-Killer May Go Free</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARC HUMBERT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A convicted cop-killer whose clemency three
years ago drew a sharp rebuke from then-Vice President George Bush
could taste freedom this week, but the controversy over his case may
linger on.
   Gary McGivern, serving 25 years to life for the 1968 shooting he
insists he didn't commit, is to appear for the third time before the
state Board of Parole since getting clemency.
   ``He's going to be paroled,'' predicted Michael Kavanagh, the
Ulster County district attorney who prosecuted McGivern and wants
him to remain behind bars.
   McGivern's long fight for freedom has attracted the support of an
unusual array of people including folk singer Pete Seeger, liberal
attorney William Kunstler and conservative columnist William F.
Buckley.
   McGivern and fellow inmate Charles Culhane received life
sentences for the shooting death of William Fitzgerald, a
Westchester County deputy.
   Prosecutors said McGivern, Culhane and inmate Robert Bowerman
tried to escape from a car while being transported for a court
appearance. Fitzgerald and Bowerman died from gunshot wounds and
McGivern and Culhane were wounded.
   McGivern and Culhane have maintained Bowerman acted alone but a
second deputy in the car, Joseph Singer, said they were involved in
the escape attempt.
   The two men were convicted in a 1975 retrial after a first trial
ended in a hung jury and an appeals court threw out their
convictions in a second trial, citing jury selection errors and
inconsistency in Singer's testimony.
   McGivern became eligible for a parole hearing after Gov. Mario
Cuomo granted clemency on New Year's Eve 1985. The board has
rejected McGivern twice, but at his last hearing in December 1987,
he was allowed to reapply in 14 months instead of the maximum 24
months. That, said Kavanagh, means McGivern is likely to be released.
   ``By the board's own rules, if there's a (wait) of less than two
years, you don't consider the crime, just the institutional record
and the progress,'' explained Edward Elwin, executive director of
the parole board.
   After 20 years in maximum-security prisons, McGivern was moved in
May to a medium-security institution.
   The prospect that the 44-year-old inmate might go free had
prompted prison guards and law enforcement officials to denounce
Cuomo in the past.
   Shortly after Cuomo granted the clemency, Bush went on the attack.
   ``I can tell you one thing about the difference between a liberal
politician and a conservative one: Governor Ronald Reagan kept cop
killers in jail,'' Bush told a New York City political dinner. At
the time, Cuomo was considered a contender for the 1988 Democratic
presidential nomination.
   As lieutenant governor, Cuomo recommended McGivern for clemency
in 1979 after he passed two lie detector tests, but then-Gov. Hugh
Carey refused.
   Cuomo was elected governor in 1982. Two years later, Singer shot
himself to death outside his home in Berwick, Pa. Police said he
left no suicide note.
   Then, six years after his original recommendation, Cuomo signed
the clemency papers himself.
   ``It was a very difficult call. This man is not a cop killer,''
he said.
   Kavanagh, however, insists McGivern is a murderer and a ``con
man'' who has fooled a lot of people.
   ``If this kid wasn't a nice, white, Irish boy who had some very
serious connections with the rich and powerful, this never would
have happened,'' he said.

<TEXT>
   The shenanigans of television evangelists
have spawned another player in America's multimillion-dollar board
game industry, this one irreverently named ``Fleece the Flock.''
   The game, developed by a writer, an inventor and an illustrator,
is based loosely on ``Monopoly,'' but instead of real-estate
tycoons, players assume the roles of greedy evangelists.
   ``I came up with the idea when Jimmy Swaggart was caught in the
motel,'' said Elizabeth Fuller, author of ``My Search for the Ghost
of Flight 401'' and other books. ``I thought, `These guys belong on
a board game.'''
   Equipped with collection plates, players toss the dice and pursue
ownership of theme parks, television stations and record companies
while trying to bankrupt their unholy competitors and keep their own
sexual escapades secret.
   Fuller collaborated on the game with inventor Stanley Mason,
whose 30 patents include Masonware microwave cookware, and Roy Doty,
a humorous illustrator.
   The three formed Tongue-in-Cheek Productions and sold the rights
to market the game to Regent Continental, a Philadelphia-based
company that produces board games for some of the nation's largest
toy makers.
   The company plans to have a pilot run of 10,000 games, selling at
$25 retail, available mostly in the Northeast by April 1, said Cindy
Levinson, an account executive for Regent.
   ``Fleece the Flock'' is only the latest board game to capitalize
on people in the news. Milton Bradley, maker of the some of the
country's most popular games, last month unveiled ``Trump _ The
Game,'' based on the wheeling and dealing of billionaire real estate
mogul Donald Trump.
   Analysts say any new entry into the $760 million-a-year
board-game industry faces an uphill battle.
   ``More than half the new toys introduced in any given year do not
make it past that year's Christmas,'' said David S. Leibowitz, a toy
industry analyst with American Securities Corp. in New York. ``The
success of any new toy item is pretty tough.''
   But Fuller and her collaborators say they are confident that
Americans' seemingly endless fascination with the foibles of
television evangelists will create a niche for their game.
   During five months of testing, the inventors were dumbfounded to
discover one common trait among test players: They all were cheating
by the end of the game. That prompted the inclusion of one rule
assumed in most games: ``Thou shalt not cheat (unless thou canst get
away with it).''
   No real-life evangelist is named and the inventors insist they
are not attacking religion itself. Fuller is a Unitarian; Doty and
Mason are both Methodists.
   ``It's a comment on humanity,'' Mason said. ``It's aimed at the
human foibles we have, when we'll support people like this when we
know ... they are evil.''

<HEAD>ASEAN Countries Announce Cut-Off Date For Vietnamese Refugees</HEAD>
<DATELINE>KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Association of Southeast Asian
Nations announced today that Vietnamese refugees arriving in their
countries will no longer automatically qualify for resettlement.
   In other words, those who cannot prove they are fleeing political
persecution will be returned to Vietnam.
   A Foreign Ministry statement said the new policy would take
effect Tuesday ``and will be applied region-wide.''
   ASEAN diplomats said the new policy applies only to Vietnamese
refugees.
   Since Vietnam ``boat people'' began fleeing their country a
decade ago, all the ASEAN countries _ Malaysia, Indonesia, Thailand,
Brunei, Singapore and the Philippines _ have accepted any Vietnamese
who arrived as a refugee.
   Refugees were given temporary asylum and put into camps to await
resettlement by the United States, Australia, Canada, New Zealand
and other Western nations.
   ASEAN diplomats said that under the new policy, those arriving
would be screened by officials of the country where they land, with
the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees providing
assistance.
   Those found to be fleeing for political reasons or fleeing
persecution would be given refugee status. But if it is determined
the emigrant has left Vietnam hoping for a better economic life in
the West, he or she would be put into a camp to await repatriation.
   The ASEAN diplomats said their nations had wanted the cut-off
date to be included in the draft plan developed in Malaysia at the
end of a meeting held last week to prepare for an international
conference on refugees. But representatives from the United Nations,
the United States, Sweden and other countries had objected, saying
all those who flee should be given refugee status.
   A compromise was reached under which ASEAN could issue a separate
statement on the cut-off date. ASEAN members said Vietnam has
already agreed, at the planning session, to accept those seeking to
go back voluntarily.
   But Vietnam has said it would not accept anyone forcefully
returned. It was still uncertain what would happen to refugees
denied resettlement who refuse to go back, ASEAN said.
   The move follow's Hong Kong's adoption of a similar tough new
policy under which Vietnamese boat people are considered illegal
immigrants subject to repatriation unless they can prove they fled
persecution. Vietnamese refugees have since the communist takeover
in their country sailed by the tens of thousands to seek asylum in
non-communist Southeast Asia.

<HEAD>Record High Temperatures Set Across South</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Rain fell in the northern Pacific Coast region today, while the
South sizzled in record heat that topped 90 degrees in some places
and even hit 100 in one Texas town.
   Low pressure off the Pacific Coast brought showers to northern
California and western Oregon, with snow in some of the higher
elevations. A snow advisory was in effect this morning for the
Cascade Mountains of Oregon.
   The region has had a wet month; a total of 3{ inches of rain has
fallen in Portland, Ore., so far in March.
   Wind gusts of up to 70 mph were reported around Reno, Nev., late
Sunday, and a high wind watch has been posted for today for western
Nevada.
   Across the South and Southwest, several record temperatures were
set Sunday for the date.
   Record highs included Alamogordo, N.M., with 87 degrees;
Albuquerque, N.M., 82; Casper, Wyo., 65; El Paso, Texas, 89; Ely,
Nev., 68; Greer, S.C., 76; Las Vegas, Nev., 86; Lubbock, Texas, 94;
Memphis, Tenn., 84; Midland, Texas, 95; Mobile, Ala., 85; Roswell,
N.M., 93; Tucson, Ariz., 93; and Winslow, Ariz., 80.
   Tucson had its sixth consecutive day of record high temperatures,
while Winslow had its fifth.
   Childress, Texas, though, was hotter. It recorded 100 degrees,
the nation's high temperature.
   The forecast for today: widespread rain showers in Washington,
Oregon and northern California; scattered rain showers in the
northern half of the Plateau region, with snow showers over much of
Montana; scattered rain from the Ohio and Tennessee valleys to
central Virginia and North Carolina; and possible rain mixed with
snow or sleet in the higher elevations of the southern Appalachians.
   High temperatures were predicted in the 30s and 40s in the
northern and middle Atlantic Coast states, from the Appalachians
across to portions of the northern Plains and northern Rockies to
much of Washington; in the 70s and 80s from Southern California
across the desert Southwest, the southern Rockies, the southern
Plains and the Gulf Coast states to Florida; in the 90s in parts of
southwestern Texas; and in the 50s and 60s in most of the rest of
the nation.
   Temperatures around the nation in the Lower 48 states at 2 a.m.
EST ranged from 4 degrees below zero at Massena, N.Y., to 77 degrees
at Blythe, Calif.

<TEXT>
   As a warm breeze carries the breath
of spring to the serenity of her suburban Houston home, Maureen
Seeba surrounds herself with the horror and anguish of a conflict
half a world away.
   Each day, the professional artist tries to work on a portrait of
Terry Anderson, who on Thursday will reach the fourth anniversary of
his abduction in Beirut, Lebanon.
   Anderson, 41, chief Middle East correspondent for The Associated
Press, is the longest held of 15 foreign hostages in Lebanon,
including nine Americans believed kidnapped by pro-Iranian Shiite
Moslems.
   ``They're easy to forget about when you live like this _ with a
good life, and your kids are at home, and you have enough food to
eat, and you just have to decide where you want to go each day,''
Mrs. Seeba said.
   She focused her artistic interest on Anderson after she saw the
newsman's plea to President Reagan in a tape released by his captors
last Oct. 31.
   ``It was just very heartbreaking,'' she says. ``He's been over
there four years and I have to ask myself, `What have I been doing
the past four years?' because I really haven't been that aware of
him.''
   So in between paintings of flowers, boats and people, the
32-year-old artist began painting likenesses of Anderson _ haunting
portraits that chronicle his ordeal. Nearly all are character
studies of his face. Some show him with a beard. Others are
clean-shaven. Some are in a single color. Others are multihued.
   She has a couple dozen paintings and has thrown out maybe 25 or
30 she didn't like. Her favorite is a yellow portrait showing a
nearly emotionless Anderson.
   ``I'm sure at this point he's about drained of any expression,''
she says. ``The yellow is like a nuclear flash. It's so intense. But
it also could signify the yellow ribbons that are not hanging in
everyone's doorways. I guess that's why I like it.''
   She said she has not contacted any members of Anderson's family,
including his sister, Peggy Say, who has urged national leaders to
work for his release. Her images of Anderson are based in part on
photos and videotapes Anderson's captives have released to news
agencies.
   ``If nothing else, because I'm someone who doesn't know him, by
doing at least one painting of him every day, even if nobody ever
sees it, he's being remembered,'' she said. ``He's not getting out,
but he is being remembered.''
   Mrs. Seeba said her attempts to arrange a showing of her Anderson
portraits have been rebuffed by managers of public buildings in
Houston where art generally is exhibited.
   ``They all say the same thing,'' she says. ``They say it's just
too controversial and they don't want to offend anybody.''
   Any proceeds from the sale of her Anderson works will go to the
Journalists' Committee to Free Terry Anderson, she said, so people
won't accuse her of trying to exploit him for her own fame.
   ``Anguish _ that's what I'm trying to show,'' she said. ``I just
want to raise consciousness. I want the public to remember.''

<TEXT>
   The apparently random, brutal murders of
two prominent residents were separated by 15 years, but they have
come together to shatter the serenity of this hill-country town.
   Michael Berryhill, who has spent 14 years on death row and has
come within hours of the electric chair, faces a third trial in the
1974 slaying of George Hooks Jr., manager of the local Union Carbide
plant. Hooks was shot to death in his home as his family watched.
   Berryhill's two previous murder convictions and death sentences
were overturned on appeal. No trial date has been set.
   Meanwhile, lawyers for 18-year-old William Scott are seeking a
change of venue for their client, who is charged with the Feb. 11
strangling of Addie Roper, the 75-year-old aunt of Gov. Joe Frank
Harris.
   The two cases have coincided because of a glacially slow appeals
process for Berryhill and the rapid arrest of Scott. Together, the
two crimes serve as reminders for Cartersville's 9,500 residents
that small towns are less insular than they once were.
   ``I guess Atlanta gets closer to us every day,'' said Charles
Hurley, publisher of the Cartersville Daily Tribune News.
   Cartersville is a nostalgic flashback, everybody's Our Town,
tucked among hills, lakes and rivers 40 miles northwest of Atlanta.
The town has had a few murders, but most were easier to explain,
Police Maj. Charles Siniard said.
   ``Domestic fights, or armed robberies,'' he recalled in a recent
interview. ``Nothing like these.''
   Both Hooks and Roper appeared to have been chosen at random and
neither knew their attackers, police say. Both times robbery was the
motive and small change was the prize, they say.
   On Oct. 7, 1974, a man forced his way into Hooks' home,
terrorized his family and shot Hooks five times as his son, then 12,
and wife watched. Hooks died the next day.
   ``After he shot Hooks he put the gun in the boy's mouth and
threatened to blow that boy's brains all over the place,'' said
attorney William Elsey, who defended Berryhill in his first trial.
   Berryhill, then 22, with 34 prior convictions and a habit of
getting high from sniffing varnish, was convicted the following
January and sentenced to die.
   The conviction was thrown out by the 11th U.S. Circuit Court of
Appeals, which ruled that statements he made without a lawyer
present were used in court. A second conviction and death sentence
were thrown out because the makeup of the jury was judged improper.
   On Feb. 11, Mrs. Roper was killed in her home. The widow and
retired florist was described by townspeople as ``everybody's aunt.''
   Scott, who had a reputation as a troublemaker in nearby Cassville
where he lived, was arrested and charged within days of the killing.
   Siniard said it was hard to explain how Mrs. Roper became a
victim.
   ``Why, let's say, didn't (the killer) stop at another house
before he got to hers? There are some strange activities these days.
We keep thinking, `Maybe it will never happen here again.' But it
always will.''
   Tim Chason, executive vice president of the local Chamber of
Commerce, raised a reward for the capture of Mrs. Roper's killer and
said he had no problem getting pledges for $6,400.
   The last time the town raised a reward, he said, was in the Hooks
case.

   Israeli troops killed at least three
Palestinian guerrillas in south Lebanon early today in a gunbattle
illuminated by parachute flares after a chase through hills near
Israel's border.
   It was the second day in a row that Israeli troops had clashed
with guerrillas in Israel's self-proclaimed security zone that were
headed for attacks in northern Israel.
   The Israeli army showed reporters the bodies of three slain
guerrillas at a base in northern Israel, displaying identification
papers showing the dead men belonged to a Syrian-based PLO faction
and saying they intended to attack an Israeli settlement.
   The faction, the Palestine Liberation Front, said in a statement
that the guerrillas were headed into Israel for a raid.
   The Israeli military said the three were killed in a half-hour
fight after a predawn chase of several hours through the hills. A
Lebanese police spokesman said four guerrillas were killed.
   The discrepancy could not immediately be resolved.
   The police spokesman, who cannot be identified under standing
rules, said the guerrillas were intercepted in Israel's security
zone at the village of Meiss el-Jebel shortly after midnight.
   He said the Israelis fired about 600 parachute flares during the
action.
   In its communique, the Israeli military said air force planes
dropped the flares to light the way for the troops after they
spotted the guerrillas near Meiss el-Jebel, about half a mile from
the Israeli border.
   A soldier in the force, identified only as Ofer under army
regulations, told reporters at the base in northern Israel that his
sergeant opened fire on the guerrillas after spotting their hiding
place about 20 yards away and the guerrillas fired back.
   Then, he said, ``the whole force joined in and threw hand
grenades. One of the terrorists opened fire and missed, and then he
was killed.''
   The names on the guerrillas' documents were Ahmed Mohammed
Atallah, Mazen Mohammed Shams Adin, and Khaled Mohammed Ibrahim.
   Also displayed to reporters were leaflets carried by the men,
which said their mission was ``to identify with the children of the
stones,'' referring to the Palestinian uprising in Israeli-occupied
territories.
   The guerrillas carried AK-47 automatic rifles with several
magazines, hand grenades, three small missiles, barbed wire cutters,
and photographs of members of their faction killed in earlier raid
attempts.
   Today's was the fourth clash between PLO guerrillas and Israeli
soldiers in less than three weeks. On Sunday, Israeli soldiers
killed two Palestinian guerrillas who entered the security zone.
   At least 12 guerrillas have been killed in the clashes and no
Israelis were injured.
   Israel has cited the clashes in asking the United States to call
off its dialogue with the Palestine Liberation Organization. It
maintains they prove that PLO chairman Yasser Arafat is violating
his renunciation of terrorism.
   Maj. Gen. Yossi Peled, the head of northern command, told Israel
radio today: ``We are talking about intensive activity by all the
terrorist organizations. What happened last night is another stage.
The aims of these organizations hasn't changed. They want to hurt
Israeli settlements.''
   Washington ended a 13-year ban on dealings with the PLO and
initiated a dialogue with the PLO in December after Arafat renounced
terrorism and recognized Israel's right to exist.
   Arafat and his aides have said attacks against Israeli military
targets are not included in the PLO's definition of terrorism.
   An Israeli Foreign Ministry official said today's attempted raid
indicated Arafat could not force his entire organization to stick to
his renunciation of terrorism.
   ``It's just one more indication that the PLO doesn't control all
the groups,'' said the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
   The PLO serves as an umbrella group for eight guerrilla factions
which sometimes fight among themselves and launch independent
attacks on Israeli targets. The largest group is Arafat's mainstream
Fatah.
   Israel established security zone up to 10 miles deep in south
Lebanon to protect its northern border when it pulled most of its
forces out of the region in 1985, ending a three-year occupation.

   In his first on-air meeting with Bryant Gumbel
since the release of Gumbel's memo criticizing his ``Today'' show
colleagues, weatherman Willard Scott today kissed Gumbel on the
cheek, then got off a zinger.
   Scott, plugging Purina pet foods, told Gumbel that Purina ``makes
all kinds of food for animals. They make goat food, they make horse
food.''
   ``They make it for the complete horse, so you wouldn't be
interested,'' Scott added.
   Gumbel looked slightly chagrined, and Scott added, laughing, ``I
had to do something.''
   Scott was the recipient of the strongest criticism from Gumbel in
the memo to the NBC show's executive producer. Gumbel complained
about Scott's ``bad taste'' and the amount of time he spends sending
birthday greetings to elderly viewers.
   The memo was written in the fall and was leaked two weeks ago,
apparently after being taken from Gumbel's computer file.
   Scott was on vacation last week, though he and Gumbel talked by
telephone, with Scott making Gumbel take an on-air pledge against
computer memo-writing.
   Gumbel was on vacation the week the memo was leaked.

<HEAD>San Diego Police May Accept Applicants Who Used LSD</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SAN DIEGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Police Department is considering lifting a
ban on recruits who have tried LSD or other hallucinogenic drugs.
   ``We want to be current and reflect society,'' said Leroy Brady,
department personnel administrator. ``We don't want to punish what
was experimental drug use. We are losing candidates.''
   Some department officials and beat officers question the wisdom
of relaxing the ban while police are trying to crack down on illegal
drugs.
   ``I'd say we're not lowering our standards,'' Brady said. ``We're
looking at it from a practical standpoint of what's happening in
society.''
   Brady said several police agencies accept applicants who
experimented with hallucinogens five to 10 years in the past. San
Diego police haven't determined the proper time frame in which they
may allow past use of those drugs, he said.
   City Personnel Director Richard Snapper said his only concern is
whether such drugs could still prompt flashbacks. But he said,
``We've talked to medical people and we're finding the fear of
flashbacks is unfounded.''
   Police officials say up to 60 percent of recent applicants
admitted drug experimentation. Up to 40 percent of recruits who
passed written exams were disqualified because of past drug use,
Brady said.
   The ban applies to such drugs as mescaline, peyote and
phencyclidine, or PCP. Also banned are heroin and illegal steroids.
   City policy allows people who have used marijuana up to six
months before applying to become officers. Cocaine use as recent as
two years earlier also is acceptable.

   Most foreign ministers gathered at a
conference of Islamic nations oppose Saudi Arabia's bid to win
formal recognition of the Afghan guerrillas' newly declared
government, diplomatic sources said today.
   However, the Saudis are expected to gather enough support to
reject Iran's campaign to persuade the 46-member Organization of the
Islamic Conference to back its stand on Salman Rushdie's novel ``The
Satanic Verses.''
   Saudi Arabia and other Islamic countries have criticized Rushdie
and banned his novel, saying it blasphemes Islam. But they have
refused to support the call by Iran's Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini
for the British writer's death.
   Shiites Moslems, who dominate in Iran, comprise only a tenth of
the world's 1 billion Moslems and the Iranians are clearly
outnumbered in their bid at the conference to gain support for
Khomeini's death decree.
   Iran's official Islamic Republic News Agency said an Iranian
delegation headed by the deputy chief of the Islamic Propagation
Organization, Mohammad Ali Taskhiri, left Tehran on Sunday to attend
the gathering.
   Saudi Arabia broke off diplomatic ties with Iran last year,
accusing it of fomenting terrorism among Shiites in the kingdom.
   The Saudis have been regarded for centuries as the most
influential state within the Moslem world.
   King Fahd inaugurated the four-day meeting today and was expected
to deliver a lengthy speech at its first session.
   Only two member states, Saudi Arabia and Sudan, have formally
recognized the Afghan guerrillas' Pakistan-based interim government.
The guerrillas are trying to topple the Soviet-backed Kabul
government of President Najib.
   The Saudis want the other group members to both recognize the
interim government and accept it as Afghanistan's representative to
the Islamic organization.
   The guerrillas' foreign minister, Gulbaddin Hekmatyar, told
reporters that delegations were visiting Islamic countries to seek
recognition of his government, which Iran opposes.
   Iranian-backed Afghan guerrillas walked out of the conference
that created the interim government because of a dispute over
sharing power with more powerful, Pakistani-based groups.
   Hekmatyar said some Islamic countries have ``put conditions,
asking for a broad-based government to be eligible for recognition.''
   ``As for the Iran-based groups, it is an internal problem and
should not be taken as a pretext to delay recognition,'' he said.
   However, one Asian diplomat speaking on condition of anonymity
suggested that member governments were hesitating for other reasons.
   ``Most Islamic governments don't seem to easily digest the idea
of recognizing a rebel government, because that would be a dangerous
precedent and an unsettling example to be emulated by maverick
political groups elsewhere in the Islamic world.''
   The guerrillas created their interim government less than a month
after the Soviets completed their withdrawal from Afghanistan,
ending a costly nine-year intervention.
   The Islamic representatives also planned to consider collective
action to create an independent Palestinian state.
   Conference sources said the ministers were expected to discuss a
diplomatic offensive to force Israel to relinquish territories it
occupied in 1967 and accept a Palestinian state there.

<HEAD>Low Reading Skills Worry S.C. National Guard Guard</HEAD>
<DATELINE>COLUMBIA, S.C. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   South Carolina's Army National Guard is
worried too many soldiers can't read well enough to understand the
manuals for such high-tech weapons as the HAWK missile, Apache
attack helicopter and the M1 Abrams battle tank.
   The training manuals are written for 10th-graders, but 40 percent
of the enlistees tested read at the ninth-grade level or below,
according to recent tests.
   Adjutant Gen. T. Eston Marchant estimated that 25 percent of
those reading at the ninth-grade level or below work in high-tech
speciality areas or will when the Guard finishes its modernization
program.
   ``There is no way Guardsmen reading at the fourth-grade level can
get trained for using that equipment much less read the field
manuals,'' said Marchant, who commands the state's 15,400 Army and
Air National Guardsmen.
   He said the situation is embarrassing, but added: ``We have no
choice. It's either a matter of not being able to man, field and
function as a military unit or trying to do something about it.''
   To close the gap, the Guard is encouraging enlistees to enroll in
adult education classes to improve their reading, officials said.
   The reading program does not affect the state's Air National
Guard.
   The Guard will give reading tests to 12,798 enlisted personnel by
the summer, said Maj. Bill Power, Guard spokesman. As of February,
tests given to 6,793 enlistees showed that 40 percent were reading
at the ninth-grade level or below.
   Sixty percent of the Guard's enlistees read well enough to
comprehend weapons' manuals, officials said. To be considered
``combat ready,'' 85 percent of a guard unit must be trained in its
specialty areas on the high-tech weaponry.
   The South Carolina Army National Guard is getting the advanced
weaponry because it has been ranked as the country's top outfit in
six of the past nine years, said Capt. Jim Carter, Guard educational
services coordinator.
   South Carolina's HAWK missile brigade will be activated in
October. The Guard has 60 Abrams tanks and 20 helicopters.

   As he enters his fifth year as a hostage in
the Middle East, Terry Anderson may be suffering from backlash over
British author Salman Rushdie's novel ``The Satanic Verses,'' says
Anderson's sister Peggy Say.
   The book worsened relations between the West and Moslem
extremists who hold Anderson captive, diminishing his prospects for
release, Mrs. Say said Sunday.
   ``The situation has fallen apart again,'' she said. ``It seems
like every time we get close, something unpredictable happens.''
   Mrs. Say's comments came after a prayer service for Anderson in
his hometown. It was the first of several observances of the
anniversary of Anderson's kidnapping March 16, 1985, in Beruit.
   Anderson, 41, chief Middle East correspondent for The Associated
Press, is the longest held of 15 foreign hostages in Lebanon.
   Mrs. Say, a leading advocate for her brother, said that
immediately after the inauguration of President Bush, there were
signs that Anderson might soon be freed.
   She didn't specify what signs but said the political climate at
the time was more encouraging than it had been in many months.
   With the publication of Rushdie's book, which many Moslems
consider blasphemous, there has been increasing animosity between
the two cultures, she said.
   ``But we're not going to give up,'' she said.
   About 100 residents of Batavia listened to a roll call of the
hostages in a high school gymnasium Sunday and heard Mrs. Say urge
them not to allow Anderson to be forgotten.

   Salman Rushdie's novel ``The Satanic Verses''
set a sales record in the opening hours of Israel's largest book
fair, according to organizers of the 100,000-book display from 42
countries.
   Israeli officials said the thousands in attendance and 1,000
publishers exhibiting are showing support for the Jewish state at a
time when it is confronted with a declining image after 15 months of
Palestinian rebellion.
   The star of the 14th Jerusalem International Book Fair at its
opening Sunday was Rushdie's book, which has been banned in several
countries because many Moslems consider it blasphemous. The book
prompted Iran's Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini to urge Moslems to hunt
down and kill the Indian-born British author.
   Israeli publishers at the opening called on their colleagues
abroad to unite in condemnation of the Iranian threats against
Rushdie, which include a bounty of $5.2 million.
   ``The history of our people and other nations in this century
teaches us that we can't keep silent and let a bloodthirsty ruler
pursue his criminal threats,'' said Racheli Edelman of the Israeli
Publishers' Association.
   Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir was whisked past an exhibit of
Rushdie's book to avoid an encounter that could upset Israel's
Moslem minority. He declined comment, saying: ``I'm just visiting.''
   The Israeli Keter publishing house proudly displayed copies of
the novel beside a large sign: ``The Satanic Verses _ shortly in
Hebrew.''
   At the Jerusalem Post stand, an official said he sold 20 copies
of the English-language version in the first two hours of the fair _
a record for the Hebrew-speaking country where the 547-page novel
costs $32.70.
   Only 150 copies were sold in Israel before the fair, said an
official who expects to sell up to 600 copies before the exhibition
closes Saturday.
   Some of the 1,000 publishers are attending for the first time,
such as representatives of China, the Soviet Union, Fiji and Nepal.
Also included are Eastern bloc countries that have no diplomatic
ties with Israel _ Poland, Hungary and Yugoslavia.
   This year's fair is the largest since the weeklong biennial event
began in 1961, said Jerusalem city spokeswoman Bonnie Boxer.
   ``This is another proof that Jerusalem, the eternal capital of
the Jewish people, can overcome the difficulties and confrontations
and appear as the heavenly Jerusalem, sending to the whole world
messages of peace and justice,'' Shamir said at the opening.
   Security was heavy. Guards searched visitors' purses at the
entrance, and inside, other security men patrolled with portable
radio telephones.
   Among exhibits are a British facsimile edition of the Rothshild
Miscellany, a 15th century Italian Jewish manuscript priced at
$6,000.
   Side-by-side were a display of new Soviet books, one of Russian
translations of Western thrillers, and a biography of President Bush.
   Shamir was presented with Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's
book, ``Perestroika and the New Thinking.''

   A Palestinian was found beaten to death today in
the occupied Gaza Strip, and a sign next to his body said he was
killed for selling drugs and helping Israel, Arab reports said.
   The army said the body of a known drug dealer was found and said
it was investigating.
   Also today, two Palestinian teen-agers suffered bullet wounds
during clashes between soldiers and stone-throwing youths in Beit
Hanoun in the Gaza Strip, Arab news reports said.
   Saris Atawna, 30, was found dead in Gaza City's main square, and
a cardboard sign left near his body said he was slain for drug
dealing and ``cooperating with the authorities,'' the Arab news
reports said.
   The notice was reportedly signed in Arabic by the Unified
National Leadership of the Uprising, a pro-Palestine Liberation
Organization group that has helped organize the 15-month revolt in
the occupied Gaza Strip and West Bank.
   Atawna's death raised to 396 the number of Palestinians killed in
the uprising against Israeli rule in the territories. Seventeen
Israelis have died.
   In Lebanon today, Israeli troops killed at least three
Palestinian guerrillas after a chase through hills near Israel's
border. Officials said the guerrillas intended to attack Israel.
   It was the second consecutive day that Israeli troops had clashed
with guerrillas in Israel's self-proclaimed security zone. Two
guerrillas were killed Sunday.
   Lebanese police reported four guerrillas died in the fighting
today. The discrepancy could not immediately be resolved.

<TEXT>
   The leader of West Germany's
Jewish community today said strong showings by extreme rightist
parties in state elections indicate a voter trend that must be
halted to protect democracy.
   The extreme-right National Democratic Party picked up seven seats
in the Frankfurt city legislature Sunday as well as seats in the
Main-Kinzig district council east of Hanau and in the city of Bad
Hersfeld, near the East German border.
   The ultra-right Republican Party gained seats in two district
councils and in the city council of Bad Nauheim north of Frankfurt.
In January, the Republicans gained 11 seats in the West Berlin city
legislature.
   The far-right parties support expulsion of foreign workers and
asylum-seekers from the country.
   Heinz Galinski, the head of the Jewish community, bitterly
attacked the outcome.
   ``The move to the right and the renunciation of the democratic
parties represent the trend of the Federal Republic (West Germany)
in the 40th year of its existence,'' Galinski told The Associated
Press.
   Galinski added: ``The year 1989 is more suitable to reflect on
democracy and to protect it.''
   In voting across Hesse state, the Christian Democrats suffered
losses of 6.8 percent compared with the 1985 elections. That
includes losing power in Frankfurt, which the party had controlled
for 12 years.
   The left-leaning Social Democrats will have 40 seats in the newly
formed city parliament, the environmentalist Greens 10 seats and the
Christian Democrats 36.
   ``Right-wing radicalism must be decisively combated,'' the
Christian Democrats' general secretary, Heiner Geissler, told Hesse
state radio.
   Less than two months ago, the Christian Democrats were ousted
from power in West Berlin.
   The Greens and Social Democrats are expected to form a governing
coalition in West Berlin, and Christian Democrats fear the same
could happen on the federal level after next year's elections.
   Critics claim the Christian Democrats are as a result trying to
appeal to more conservative voters and have been adopting some of
the causes of the far right.
   Some members of Chancellor Helmut Kohl's governing party called
today for a revamping of its strategy.
   In Bonn, prominent Christian Democratic politician Juergen
Todenhoefer urged an emergency meeting of the party.
   ``For six years, the party has been experiencing one election
fiasco after another, without making any serious analysis
afterwards,'' he said in a letter to Kohl. He released a copy to the
news media.
   Statewide in Hesse, the extreme right made gains.
   The Frankfurt vote gives the party a small but vocal opposition
force in one of West Germany's most important cities and its
financial capital. It is the first time since 1968 the National
Democrats have had representation in Frankfurt.
   In the town of Woelfersheim, the party won nearly 16 percent of
the vote or more than double its results in the last elections in
1985.
   The Republicans gained seats in local councils in the Rheingau
Taunus district near the Rhine River and in the Wetterau district
northeast of Frankfurt. The exact number of seats was not determined.

   Joe Clark, the get-tough principal
portrayed in the movie ``Lean on Me,'' today blamed his five-day
suspension on political opponents who resent his place in the
national spotlight.
   ``I'm going to give them hell,'' Clark said on ABC's ``Good
Morning America.'' ``I'm not going to let them drive me out.''
   The Eastside High School principal, who patrols the halls with a
bat and bullhorn, was suspended by the superintendent last week over
a school assembly featuring a sequined dancer who stripped her male
partners down to G-strings.
   Clark said he seen the dance troupe perform previously, and its
show contained ``nothing of the inappropriateness that took place on
that particular day.''
   Clark said that his opponents, whom he did not name, engaged in
``a strange kind of sabotage.''
   ``I think the situation is being exacerbated by a few little
gnats ... who need to be swatted because I've found that the City
Council and the other harbingers of doom are nothing ultimately but
a bunch of sapsuckers who are trying to suck the juice, the blood
and the spirit from me,'' he said.
   Clark has been principal for seven years. His boot camp tactics
have won as much criticism as praise from parents, politicians and
educators.

<TEXT>
   Only one in three of today's marriages can be
expected to last, according to a new study that says divorce and
separation have been under-reported.
   The projection is contained in a study in the journal Demography,
which says an apparent decline in divorces since 1980 is likely to
have little effect on long-term prospects.
   ``This decline may indicate a return to a more stable family
life; however, it would be foolish to jump to that conclusion from
this brief deviation from the trend,'' said researchers Larry L.
Bumpass and Teresa Castro Martin of the University of Wisconsin's
Center for Demography.
   With the marriage rate running about double that for divorces,
they note that the basic data indicate ``that 56 percent of recent
first marriages would be likely to disrupt within 40 years of
marriage.''
   However, studies have found a ``serious under-reporting'' of
divorce and separation in the government's Current Population
Survey, according to their study: ``Recent Trends in Marital
Disruption.''
   Taking that into consideration ``we conclude that the best
estimate based on these data is that about two-thirds of all first
marriages are likely to disrupt.''
   ``As high as this estimate may seem, it is based on the
assumption that a plateau in the long-term trend has in fact
occurred,'' the authors added.
   Bumpass noted in a telephone interview that published divorce
statistics do not include separations.
   Population experts estimate that as many as 6 percent of
marriages end in separation without a divorce, he said. That, added
to the more than 50 percent that divorce, push the total near the
two-thirds range, he said.
   These are only estimates, not precise predictions, Bumpass
stressed. ``We don't have a crystal ball,'' he said.
   The nation's divorce rate rose sharply from the mid-1960s through
1980 and then seemed to reach a plateau and even slip somewhat, an
event some observers took to be a return to older family values.
   This is disputed by Bumpass and Martin, however, who contend that
the changes in this decade could occur for a number of reasons
without any overall shift in values.
   The growth in divorce after the 1960s has to reach a limit at
some point, they said. Plus, some rate changes occur merely because
the overall composition of society is changing.
   ``Even though the long-term increase in marital instability may
have plateaued since 1980 the level remains very high,'' Martin and
Bumpass noted.
   Studies by the National Center for Health Statistics show a
divorce rate of 2.5 per 1,000 people in 1966, rising to 3.6 in 1970,
4.8 in 1975 and 5.2 in 1980. By 1988 the rate had slipped back to
4.8, according to the most recent provisional data available.
   One factor no one can predict is the result of the rise in
cohabitation, Bumpass added.
   Half of all recent marriages involve people who lived together
first, he said. That means many cases in which people would formerly
have married and later divorced now end with a couple breaking up
before they ever get married.
   Concern about the spread of the deadly disease AIDS may also have
contributed to this leveling off in the divorce rate, the authors
said, although the changes had begun before AIDS became a well-known
issue.
   ``No one knows whether a major social transformation is likely to
be brought on by an AIDS epidemic among heterosexuals. In the
absence of such an epidemic, it seems most likely that the risks of
marital disruption will continue to increase,'' Martin and Bumpass
said.
   Age at marriage is among the greatest factors, their study said,
with divorce or separation twice as likely for women who marry as
teen-agers.
   Thus, the trend toward marriage at more mature ages in recent
years is a likely factor in reducing the divorce rate, they said.
The same is true for education, they found.
   As divorces increase among first marriages more people are
available to tie the knot a second time _ and Bumpass and Martin
found that second marriages were even less stable than first ones.
   Persons entering second marriages are, by definition, those
willing to consider divorce if they are unhappy, they observed.
   Overall, second marriages were 25 percent more likely to break up
than first marriages, they found.
   The study appears in the February edition of Demography, which is
published by the Population Association of America.

   Republican National Commitee Chairman Lee
Atwater says he's ``tickled'' to be invited to appear on NBC's
``Late Night with David Letterman'' and play with the ``World's Most
Dangerous Band.''
   Atwater, a former rock band member, is to appear on the show
Tuesday to play guitar with musical director Paul Shaffer and his
band.
   ``I'm just tickled to play with what I think is one of the
tightest bands in America,'' he said.
   Atwater said the appearance came about through his friendship
with the group's drummer, Anton Fig. He invited Fig to participate
in a rock-and-blues concert he put together as part of the
festivities for President Bush's inauguration. Atwater joined
several blues stars on stage that night, playing electric guitar and
singing a rollicking version of ``High Heeled Sneakers.''
   He has since given numerous interviews about his musical prowess
and played at a local club with guitar superstar B.B. King.

   Gunmen opened fire in a neighborhood in
this southern port city today and killed a 12-year-old boy, bringing
to six the death toll in three days of violence, police said.
   There was no claim of responsibility for the boy's death. Police
said the shooting occurred in a lower middle-class district in
western Karachi shortly after 1 a.m. Two people were injured, they
said.
   Army troops in machine-gun mounted vehicles patrolled parts of
the city to enforce a curfew aimed at ending the violence.
   In the past three years, ethnic clashes have left as many as 700
people dead in this city of 9 million, Pakistan's largest. The
clashes have been between ethnic Moslem natives and those who
immigrated from India.
   The latest violence began Saturday at Karachi University and
involved students from rival political groups.

   American bishops of the Roman Catholic Church
returned home after four days of meetings at the Vatican today and
said Pope John Paul II and others in the church hierarchy
``recognize that it is no easy job to be a bishop, especially in
America.''
   Archbishop John May, president of the U.S. Conference of Catholic
Bishops, told reporters: ``I believe that, as a result of this
meeting, the bridge between Rome and the United States is stronger
than it has ever been in recent memory.''
   May said he and his fellow clerics ``have a heightened sense that
Pope John Paul and the members of the Curia understand our situation
and support us in our work _ that they recognize that it is no easy
job to be a bishop, especially in America.''
   ``Clearly, there were some differences of perspective ... as
might be expected in any gathering of five dozen such people, but
these differences have to do with approach and not with doctrine,''
he said.
   The archbishop said, ``Many of the factors that make America
distinctive are the ones that make her great _ the freedom of
thought and expression, the pluralism of cultures and religions, the
democratic spirit which values the opinion of each individual.''
   ``That this would conflict at times with the hierarchical nature
of the church is not surprising,'' he said. ``What we came to Rome
to say (and it was received calmly and well) was that this spirit of
America must influence our own approach in the states,'' he said.
   If the summoning by the pope of the U.S. hierarchy seemed
extraordinary, and if the two sides said not all their differences
were meant to be resolved at the meeting, Americans prelates left
the impression in earlier comments in Rome that both sides agreed to
leave things be and not pursue any substantial follow-up action.
   Cardinal Bernard Law of Boston said he didn't see the meeting
triggering a ``great moment of change'' in the U.S. church.
   ``We will continue to go about our ministry as we have in the
past,'' declared Chicago's Cardinal Joseph Bernardin.
   Vatican officials criticized the moral climate in the United
States, signaling out the efforts of Planned Parenthood to promote
birth control and the greed and adultery typified by the TV series
``Dallas''.
   At the same time, they acknowledged the bishops' achievements in
working in such a highly secular atmosphere and stressed the
influence they have on Europe and the developing world.
   But they also pointed to specific problems and raised questions
on such issues as the granting of annulments, the preparation of
priests and the response to the feminist movement.
   ``Without departing from a fundamental optimism about the church
in the U.S., I think I must signal some matters on which we should
work together better to insure the interest of the family,'' was the
way Cardinal Eduard Gagnon, the Vatican's chief on family matters,
put it.
   The U.S. bishops defended their performance and said
participation in the life of the church by Americans compares
favorably with that in other Western countries. They stressed that
their work should be evaluated in the context of their democratic
society.
   ``This is not a meeting that has winners or losers,'' said
Monsignor James Lynch, secretary of the U.S. Conference of Catholic
Bishops. ``Except that truth is being served.''
   Here is a sampling of some of the comments and give-and-take
during the meeting that ended Saturday.
   On the role of the bishop _
   May, president of the bishops' conference:
   ``...to assert that there is a church teaching with authority
binding and loosing for eternity is truly a sign of contradiction to
many Americans who consider the divine right of bishops as outmoded
as the divine right of kings. Accordingly, bishops live and work
constantly in this atmosphere.''
   Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger, the Vatican's chief theologian as head
of the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith:
   ``The criterion for the truth is such that it's worth suffering
for it. Those who announce the Gospel must also be martyrs in the
most profound sense of the word.''
   On American democracy _
   Cardinal Bernardin of Chicago:
   ``We work our destiny in full view of the public's eye. This is
an element of our ministry that we are not always able to control.
Perhaps this is a special blessing of our experience _ although some
would see it as a mixed blessing.''
   On the declining number of priests _
   Cardinal William Baum, an American who heads the Vatican's
Congregation for Catholic Education:
   ``A positive approach to vocations must shrug off the pressures
to mute the priesthood that come from people who want women priests,
married priests, part-time priests or simply optional celibacy.''
   Archbishop Daniel Pilarczyk of Cincinnati:
   ``How attractive is a lifetime of service in a culture which
stresses self-satisfaction and in which lifetime commitment seems
more and more difficult even in marriage?''
   On annulments and marriage _
   Archbishop Achille Silvestrini, prefect of the Holy See's highest
court, pointed out that of the 45,632 annulments granted worldwide
in 1986, 36,180 were in the United States.
   Archbishop John Quinn of San Francisco:
   ``By providing a place where families can socialize together with
others who share their commitment to the person and message of
Christ, the parishes of the United States help to compensate for the
rootlessness and lack of social and religious support that are
inherent in our society with its secularistic stance and high
mobility.''
   On feminism _
   Cardinal Gagnon, the Canadian who heads the Pontifical Council
for the Family:
   ``It is evident that ideological feminism has a deterious
influence on the family. But conversely the best way to counter its
influence will be to care more about the family and make every one
in it more conscious of his or her vocation `to serve and not to be
served,' as Christ has taught us.''
   On Mass attendance _
   Archbishop Daniel Kucera of Dubuque, Iowa:
   ``Nearly one-half of American Catholics attend Sunday Mass each
week. The vast majority receive Holy Communion at these masses.
While this statistic shows a greater level of participation than in
many other developed Western countries, we are seeking more
effective ways of encouraging participation of non-practicing
Catholics.''

   Three-time champion Susan Butcher led the
mushers as the leaders of the 1,168-mile Iditarod Trail Sled Dog
Race began the sprint to Alaska's west coast.
   Butcher left this Yukon River village at 6:55 p.m. Sunday, with
Martin Buser of Big Lake one minute behind her.
   Joe Runyan of Nenana was third, departing at 7:45 p.m. Then came
Dee Dee Jonrowe of Willow, logging out at 9:13 p.m., four-time
champion Rick Swenson of Manley, 9:14 p.m., and Lavon Barve of
Wasilla, 10:19 p.m.
   Butcher, Buser, Runyan, Jonroe and Swenson have generally been
out front of the pack, trading the lead among themselves, since they
left the gold mining ghost town of Iditarod, 558 miles into the race.
   ``We've seen some head games, some traveling together and some
moving alone, but the competition is definitely very intense,'' said
Butcher, who won the nation's leading sled dog race in 1986, 1987
and 1988.
   Swenson, a four-time winner, said the top five ``have
accomplished one of our goals by separating ourselves from the rest
of the pack.''
   The race, inspired by a sled dog relay that brought serum from
Anchorage to Nome during a diptheria outbreak in 1925, was begun in
1973.
   The mushers raced toward the coastal village of Unalakleet, 93
miles away and the longest stretch between checkpoints in the race.
When they left Kaltag, they were 357 miles from the finish line in
Nome.
   The winner receives $50,000; the next 19 finishers share $200,000.
   Forty-one mushers remain in the contest. Eight have dropped out
since the race started March 3 in Anchorage.

   Federal officials hope that a conviction in the
sky piracy trial of Fawaz Younis will send a message to potential
terrorists that the United States has a long arm that can haul them
to justice.
   ``You can send that hijacker a message,'' Justice Department
lawyer Karen Morrissette said in her closing argument to the jury.
The panel of seven women and five men resumed deliberations today.
   Critics say that even conviction and life imprisonment for Younis
would do little to dissuade hijackers, and that acquittal would be
at best costly and embarrassing, and could undermine America's
counterterrorism efforts.
   The U.S. government has gone to enormous effort and expense to
capture and try Younis, who admitted on the stand that he led a band
from Lebanon's Amal militia in hijacking Royal Jordanian Airlines
flight 402 from Beirut on June 11, 1985.
   Two Americans were held hostage in the hijacking. No one was
killed.
   Critics of the government cite the relative obscurity of Younis,
who was a minor figure in Amal, a Shiite Moslem group that controls
most of West Beirut.
   ``He is no Abu Nidal,'' said terrorism expert Neil Livingstone of
a far more notorious terrorist leader.
   Moreover, trial by an American jury is not the most effective
weapon against terrorists, who generally come from regions torn by
violence and lawlessness, said another think-tank specialist, Robert
Kupperman.
   ``Terrorism should be treated as a national security issue and
not as a criminal justice issue,'' said Kupperman, of the Center for
Strategic and International Studies in Washington.
   Jailing Younis won't end world terrorism, but it could be a small
step in that direction, respond supporters of the government policy.
   The trial of Younis is part of a ``coherent policy on
terrorism,'' said Bruce Hoffman, a terrorism specialist at the Rand
Corp. in California.
   Younis ``may not be Abu Nidal, but you have to start somewhere''
in developing legal precedents for apprehending, trying and
convicting terrorists, said Hoffman.
   ``The message is that if you are going to attack U.S. citizens
and property, we are going to come looking for you, and if we catch
you, you will get a fair trial and if you are guilty will be
convicted,'' said Hoffman.
   Victoria Toensing, a deputy assistant attorney general who helped
plan the Younis case, described the trial as a victory for
cooperation among the Justice, State and Defense departments and the
first test of a 1984 statute under which the United States asserts
jurisdiction over cases involving the taking of U.S. hostages abroad.
   ``Not only did we use the long-arm statute for the first time,
but we showed that we could capture one of these defendants under
the law and bring him back and try him,'' she said.
   Younis was lured aboard a yacht and arrested in international
waters in the Mediterranean Sea on Sept. 13, 1987, by a team
including the FBI hostage rescue squad, the U.S. military and
intelligence agencies.
   Federal officials have not disclosed the cost of the Younis case,
but besides paying the salaries of the FBI agents, intelligence
operatives, sailors, pilots, lawyers and federal marshals involved,
the government has relocated and given new identities to at least 15
Middle Easterners under the witness protection program.
   In deciding to grab Younis instead of a bigger fish, said
Toensing, government officials were swayed by the strong case
against him.
   ``There are always several possibilities out there. You have a
combination of the `getability' of somebody, plus the case ready to
go to trial,'' she said. And a conviction against Younis could open
the season on bigger fish.
   ``Look at dope dealing. Bigwigs don't touch the stuff. It is
always harder to get the top guy. They always send underlings,''
said Toensing, who served as deputy assistant attorney general in
the criminal division for four years in the Reagan administration.
She left the government for private practice last August.

   Discovery and its five crewmen waited
out bad weather and thundered into orbit today to deploy a $100
million satellite that completes a network giving astronauts almost
unbroken radio contact with Earth.
   The 113-ton winged spaceship, also carrying four crippled white
rats and 32 chicken eggs among its scientific experiments, vaulted
off its seaside launch pad into a cloudless sky at 9:57 a.m. EST.
Liftoff was delayed one hour and 50 minutes to allow fog to burn off
and NASA computers to adjust the shuttle's path to compensate for
shifting high-altitude winds.
   NASA reported 8{ minutes after liftoff that Discovery had
achieved a successful orbit 180 miles above the Earth.
   ``All systems are clean as a whistle,'' Mission Control
commentator Brian Welch reported from Houston.
   The flight, postponed for nearly a month by mechanical faults, is
the third since the Challenger disaster more than three years ago
and starts NASA on an ambitious schedule calling for seven shuttle
launches in 1989.
   ``It's a great start to a long launch season,'' launch director
Bob Sieck told a news conference. He said that except for the
weather, the countdown was virtually fault-free.
   A 700-foot geyser of flame trailed the $1.5 billion craft as it
rolled onto its desired course and sped toward orbit.
   More than 45,000 people jammed viewing areas along nearby
beaches, roads and river banks to watch the blazing departure of the
28th space shuttle flight.
   Two minutes and six seconds after liftoff, the flight passed a
critical milestone when the two solid fuel booster rockets burned
out and jettisoned on schedule into the Atlantic Ocean. The failure
of a booster rocket joint led to the loss of Challenger and its
seven-person crew.
   Six hours into the flight, the astronauts were to perform the
main task of the mission _ deploying the 2{-ton Tracking and Data
Relay Satellite. It then was to be carried by its own rocket to a
22,300-mile-high orbit to join two older satellites and complete an
orbiting network essential for communicating with future space
shuttles and with science and military satellites.
   With the new satellite operational, Mission Control will be able
to communicate with an orbiting shuttle 85 percent of the time, in
contrast with the old system of ground stations which provided only
15 percent coverage. NASA plans to shut six of those ground stations
at a monthly savings of $3 million.
   Immediately on reaching orbit, commander Michael L. Coats pitched
the shuttle's nose down so crewmate Dr. James M. Bagian could
photograph the 154-foot-tall external fuel tank as it drifted away
toward a breakup over the Indian Ocean.
   On the last shuttle mission, Atlantis' thermal tiles were
severely damaged by insulation that stripped off the tank after it
was hit by debris that fell off one of the solid fuel booster
rockets.
   Modifications were made to correct the problem, and today's
photographs should show if any more insulation came off.
   ``Jim got some real good pictures of the tank from the overhead''
window, Coats reported. ``We can see it real well.''
   Coats and his crew were awakened at 3:16 a.m. and, in a surprise,
showed up for breakfast wearing business suits and ties. Fine china
and candles adorned the table for the steak and eggs feast.
   Wearing the suits instead of the normal casual wear apparently
was a tongue-in-cheek response to word that NASA was trying to curb
astronauts' penchant for fun. Officials reportedly were annoyed by a
televised show two missions ago when the crew floated through the
shuttle cabin wearing colorful Hawaiian shirts.
   Flying with Coats, a 43-year-old Navy captain, are Air Force Col.
John E. Blaha, 46, the pilot; Marine Cols. James F. Buchli, 43, and
Robert C. Springer, 46, and Bagian, 36, a physician. Coats and
Buchli have flown on previous shuttle flights.
   Discovery originally was set for liftoff Feb. 18, but the launch
was postponed four times by the need to replace faulty or suspect
engine parts.
   Shuttle chief Richard Truly said the success of this mission is
``absolutely vital'' to NASA's continued recovery from the
Challenger accident and the agency's move toward safe, routine,
once-a-month shuttle launches by 1992.
   Following the flight, the 1989 shuttle schedule lists the launch
of the Magellan probe to Venus in April, secret Defense Department
payloads in July and August, the Galileo mission to Jupiter in
October, a communications satellite in November and the Hubble Space
Telescope in December.
   Coats said the first two post-Challenger flights _ by Discovery
in September and Atlantis in December _ ``were important to show
that we could fly the space shuttle again after the catastrophe.
   ``The next step,'' Coats said, ``is to prove we can do it on a
regular basis, that we're back in the business of space, to show
we're a space-faring nation again.''
   The mission is filled with scientific experiments. The rats, with
chips of bone cut from their legs, are to be studied to determine
how well broken bones heal in the weightlessness of space.
   The animals will be compared with a ground control group of four
rats. Researchers believe healing will be slower in space because
astronauts have suffered loss of calcium during flights.
   The experiment is an important step toward learning how well a
broken human bone might mend during long flights aboard a space
station or on a trip to Mars.
   Also aboard is a special 70 mm IMAX camera to photograph
deteriorating areas of the Earth.
   ``They're trying to produce a movie that shows the Earth as a
very fragile thing in the universe and that maybe everybody on Earth
ought to pay a little attention to not destroying it,'' Blaha said
in a recent interview.
   The astronauts also will conduct experiments to determine the
effects of weightlessness on plant cell division, the growth of
protein crystals and the development of chicken embryos.
   Discovery is to remain in orbit for five days, one hour, seven
minutes, landing Saturday at Edwards Air Force Base in California.

   A teen-ager plunged nearly 400
feet to her death at the Grand Canyon, the second such death in
three days.
   Yuri Nagata of Gufuken, Japan, who would have turned 18 today,
had moved past a guardrail to descend to a rock ledge Thursday,
authorities said.
   ``Evidently, a friend suggested taking a photograph of her, and
as she was standing up to get the photograph taken, she lost her

   She was a member of a youth group on a U.S. tour, Lundy said.
   On Thursday, a 34-year-old West German woman fell to her death
while watching the sunset at a point also on the south rim of the

   Security guards at Los Alamos National
Laboratory went on strike today and were replaced at their posts by
non-union workers and supervisors.
   ``The security of the laboratory is not in any jeopardy,'' said
James Breen, a spokesman for the government complex where the atomic
bomb was developed during World War II and where military research
is still done.
   The walkout began over alleged unfair practices by Mason &amp;
Hanger-Silas Mason Co., the contractor that operates the guard force
at the laboratory.
   About 25 union members set up a picket line at the entrance to
headquarters building for lab guards, the only spot where picketing
is authorized. The pickets waved signs and chanted but did not
obstruct operations there.
   The union instructed guards to abandon their picket stations and
go back to work immediately if an intruder tries to get in, said
Ernesto Salazar, union business manager.
   ``Our main concern is national security,'' Salazar said Saturday.
``We are Americans and we will defend our country.''
   Breen said the force guarding the lab numbers about 340, but he
declined to say how many were taking part in the strike, citing
security concerns.
   Guards and other workers who are not part of the union will staff
the guard posts along with Mason &amp; Hanger employees from other
defense facilities, officials said.
   The guards' contract with Mason &amp; Hanger expired Feb. 8, but a
mediator was called in. Talks were scheduled to resume Tuesday.

   A young man opened fire on a brother and
sister today in a courtyard of a high school in this Paris suburb,
seriously wounding both of them and then killing himself, officials
said.
   Samir Doulim shot Abil Jbali and Jbali's half-sister Ilham Jbali,
before turning his pistol on himself, assistant prosecutor Michele
Requin said.
   The brother and sister, both in their 20s, were rushed from Paul
Langevin Lycee to two Paris hospitals.
   All three victims are of Moroccan origin. There were reports that
Doulim was related to the Jbalis, but the reports could not be
confirmed by officials.
   Police initially said incorrectly that two people were killed at
the school and that the gunman fled.
   Staff members answering the phone at the school said they were

   President Bush today called for ``throwing the
book'' at ocean dumpers and vowed to support more aggressive
criminal prosecution against them and other despoilers of the
environment.
   Promising to chart a course of environmental activism, Bush told
a group of state attorneys general that ``on many issues the time
for study has passed.''
   The president said his administration would soon submit to
Congress legislation to re-authorize the Clean Air Act and to set
new standards to reduce industrial emissions that cause acid rain.
   He also said he favors stepping up the Superfund cleanup program
and assuring compliance with hazardous waste laws.
   And, Bush told the White House session, ``I think working with
you all we can do a lot of throwing the book at those engaged in
illegal ocean dumping.''
   He told the legal officers they should closely study the cases
now before the involving environmental abuse. ``I'd like you to
think about the most serious cases where we've got to move beyond
civil penalties toward criminal enforcement,'' he said.
   Bush said criminal charges brought against those who abuse the
environment would serve ``both as a sanction and as a deterrent.''
   He praised states for taking the lead on environmental issues and
said, ``We're going to find solutions and we've got to find state
and federal roles that work.''
   In his 10-minute address, the president focused exclusively on
the environment and on the war on drugs.
   ``As I look at your agenda, it's clear to me that this
association and the White House are fighting the same battles,''
Bush said.
   He characterized drugs as ``like a chemical weapons that a
society turns on itself,'' and declared: ``We've got to see our
great cities no longer held hostage to drug lords.''
   The president got good marks for his talk.
   Outside the White House, Robert Abrams, attorney general of New
York state and president of the National Association of Attorneys
General, praised Bush's ``personal and dramatic'' commitment on
environmental issues.
   ``He applauds and recognizes the role of the states,'' Abrams
told reporters.
   He also said that William Reilly, administrator of the
Environmental Protection Agency, ``wants things to happen and he
wants them to happen quickly.'' Reilly addressed the group after
Bush.
   Tom Miller, Iowa's attorney general, said ``a new day is
dawning'' in terms of state-federal relations on environmental
issues. ``There's a real sense that we're in this together.''
   ``I heard all the right words,'' Miller added. ``However, we have
to recognize that words are the easy part of it.''
   Jeffrey Ameston, Vermont attorney general, recalled the past
practice of states filing lawsuits against the EPA to force federal
action on environmental cleanup. ``That will change in this
administration,'' he said.
   ``I'll take the message back to Vermont that this administration
is an environmental administration,'' he added.

<HEAD>Senate Putting Cheney Nomination on Fast Track</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: TOP 8 grafs new with Cheney hearings to begin Tuesday; picks
up 5th graf pvs, The 52-year-old.</HEAD>

   The Senate is moving quickly on the nomination
of Rep. Dick Cheney, R-Wyo., as defense secretary, with hearings on
President Bush's replacement for John Tower to begin Tuesday, it was
announced today.
   House Republican Leader Robert Michel and Sens. Alan Simpson and
Malcolm Wallop, R-Wyo., will formally introduce Cheney to the Senate
Armed Services Committee, said Pete Williams, a spokesman for Cheney.
   The opening of hearings was scheduled for Tuesday afternoon, the
committee announced.
   Williams said Cheney spent this morning in briefings at the White
House and was expected to go to the Pentagon later in the day.
   Bush selected Cheney after the Senate rejected Tower last
Thursday by a 53-47 vote. One member of the Armed Services Committee
expressed hope today that consideration of Cheney could be wrapped
by by week's end, when the Senate begins a two-week recess.
   Sen. Timothy Wirth, D-Colo., said on NBC's ``Today'' show: ``The
more rapidly we get through this the better. I would hope we could
be done by the end of this week.''
   The Senate also turns this week to impeachment charges against
District Judge Alcee L. Hastings of Miami, accused of plotting to
obtain a $150,000 bribe and lying about it at his 1983 conspiracy
trial.
   The congressional agenda includes new House Ethics Committee
sessions on Speaker Jim Wright, D-Texas, plus possible legislative
action on the Eastern Airlines strike and a Senate vote on increased
job protection for government ``whistleblowers'' who report waste,
fraud and abuse.
   The 52-year-old Hastings, the first black district judge in
Florida, was acquitted in the 1983 trial but now faces an effort to
remove him from the bench and take away his $89,500 salary.
   Hastings' attorney, Terence J. Anderson, maintains that the trial
should have settled the matter and that th impeachment effort,
prompted by complaints from fellow judges, represents a classic case
of double jeopardy.
   Anderson also claims that Hastings cannot receive a fair hearing
because key witnesses have died and many senators are not planning
to attend the hearings at which evidence will be presented. Instead,
they plan to rely on videotapes of the proceedings.
   The House approved a 17-count bill of impeachment 413-3 on Aug.
3, alleging that Hastings plotted with prominent Washington lawyer
William Borders to obtain a payoff from two brothers convicted in
Hastings' court of skimming money from a Teamsters pension fund loan.
   It also says Hastings perjured himself in testimony at the trial
and, in an unrelated count, that he improperly divulged information
obtained from a wiretap and thus torpedoed a federal investigation.
   House prosecutors say impeachment is not the same as a criminal
proceeding and thus the double jeopardy argument does not apply.
   The Senate plans to hear arguments Wednesday and decide Thursday
whether to dismiss the charges.
   Meanwhile, the House Ethics Committee starts closed-door
deliberations this week on six broad allegations that Wright used
his office for personal financial gain and improperly lobbied
government regulators.
   Under tight secrecy, the panel of six Democrats and six
Republicans has held two weeks of hearings to determine whether
disciplinary action is warranted. The defense is set to wrap up its
presentation Tuesday.
   Chairman Julian Dixon, D-Calif., said deliberations could take
two or three days with final action possibly spilling into next week.
   Among other things, Wright stands accused of skirting outside
income limits through bulk sales of a book and accepting free use of
a luxury car and Fort Worth condominium.
   Wright mailed letters to Texas constituents last month, saying
the case represents a politically motivated ``game of sack the
quarterback.''
   ``If they can't injure you and knock you out of the game, which
is their first choice, then they'll try at least to batter you
around enough to spoil your concentration,'' Wright said.
   The House plans to take up a measure that would establish an
emergency board to find a way to end the International Association
of Machinists strike against Eastern. Approval of the labor-backed
bill is likely in the House but the Senate could prove less
receptive to the measure, which is opposed by the White House.
   The Democratic chairmen and senior Republicans on the House and
Senate Budget committees plan to meet through the week with White
House Budget Director Richard Darman, in a continuation of talks
that began last Thursday.
   The group is seeking agreement on at least the rough outlines of
a spending plan for fiscal 1990 before Congress leaves March 23 for
its Easter recess. They will try to find a combination of spending
restraints and new revenue that would reduce the federal deficit to
$100 billion.
   The House Education and Labor Committee on Tuesday considers a
raise in the minimum wage to $4.65 an hour from its current $3.35.
It is similar to a plan that already has cleared its committee
hurdle in the Senate.
   The plan is advancing under threat of a presidential veto with
Bush calling for a version that includes a lower, ``training wage''
and increases of 30 cents an hour every year for three years.
   Lawmakers are shooting for House floor action before Easter but
the Senate is unlikely to act before April.
   Elsewhere, the Senate plans a vote on stepped-up job protection
for federal employees who expose squandering and mismanagement.
Under the bill, a compromise between Senate sponsors and the
administration reached last week, whistleblowers would have to be
reinstated in their posts if they could show reprisal for such
actions contributed to their firing or demotion.
   Stripped from the bill under the compromise was a provision
approved last year that would have allowed a special government
counsel to go to court on behalf of whistleblowers.
   President Reagan pocket vetoed last year's version after
unanimous approval by both houses, saying it would result in the
government filing suit against itself.

<TEXT>
   The U.S. ambassador and a judge
hailed an armed forces decision to turn nine men linked to the
massacre of 10 peasants over to civilian authority.
   ``The high command of the armed forces is admitting that their
earlier versions (of the massacre) have not held up under
examination and were wrong, scurrilous,'' U.S. Ambassador William
Walker said Sunday.
   But he added it is too early to tell if the development signals
an end to the military's traditional immunity from prosecution in
human rights cases.
   The military initially blamed the Sept. 21 slayings on the
guerrillas but reversed itself after months of investigation by
journalists and civilian authorities and pressure from the United
States.
   In a statement Sunday, the military admitted that soldiers
massacred the 10 peasants in the hamlet of San Francisco. It called
the slayings ``a grave violation of normal operating procedures''
and said a major, a second lieutenant, two staff sergeants, a
corporal and four privates ``will be put at the disposition of
civilian judicial authorities.''
   Judge Alcides Guandique, of the court in San Sebastian that is
handling the cases, also said the admission ``demonstrates the
professionalism of the armed forces, that they are concerned about
individual rights and that laws and constitutional principles must
be respected and enforced.''
   ``It demonstrates that there is no law above the law of the
constitution,'' he said.
   No Salvadoran military officer has been indicted or tried for a
human rights abuse despite the torture and murder of thousands of
suspected leftists or their sympathizers during the nine-year civil
war. The Salvadoran military generally denies any involvement in
right-wing death squad activity.
   Only eight lower-ranking members of the security forces have been
convicted in human rights cases, among them five National Guardsmen
convicted in the Dec. 2, 1980 slayings of four American churchwomen.
   The military's announcement comes a week before Salvadorans go to
the polls to elect a new president for their U.S.-backed government.
   Outgoing President Jose Napoleon Duarte did not comment on the
case in a televised speech Sunday in which he asked guerrillas of
the leftist Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front to lift a
traffic ban designed to reinforce a rebel-called election boycott.
   The announcement also came after a year of rising violence on
both sides in the stalemated civil war that has claimed 70,000
lives, most of them civilian.
   The United States, which provides El Salvador with about $1.5
million in aid daily, has been pressing for action in the Sept. 21
massacre, the worst mass slaying of civilians in four years.
   During a visit last month, Vice President Dan Quayle told the
military high command that the guilty soldiers and officers should
be found and punished.
   The military initially said the 10 victims were guerrillas who
died in ``fierce combat'' with the 5th Brigade's Jiboa battalion.
   But witnesses said soldiers from the battalion blew up or shot
seven men and three women in San Francisco after detaining most of
the residents and accusing them of being rebel sympathizers.
   San Francisco is a village of about 15 families about 30 miles
east of San Salvador. The brigade is based in nearby San Vincente,
about 40 miles east of the capital.
   After news reports based on interviews with witnesses
contradicted the first military version, the military changed its
story to say ten detained peasants were killed when rebels ambushed
a patrol.
   Finally, in a nationally televised speech Sunday, Defense
Minister Gen. Carlos Eugenio Vides Casanova said there was no
ambush. His speech praised the armed forces and contained only brief
comments on the massacre.
   The new version says the peasants were killed after being
detained for ``involvement in the activities of subversive
organizations.'' It said the peasants possessed ``explosives and
propaganda''.
   The armed forces said the major, an intelligence officer
identified as Maj. Mauricio Beltran Granados, ordered the peasants
killed. Beltran Granados and several other Jiboa battalion members
have been detained.
   A source familiar with the investigation said the major had a
history of involvement in past human rights abuses.
   The 5th Brigade commander, Col. Jose Emilio Chavez Caceres, was
relieved of command during the inquiry. The military statement said
he will be reinstated because his subordinates lied to him and he is
innocent of wrongdoing.

   Residents of the northern United States were treated to a rare
display of the ``northern lights'' this morning, and a scientist
said there is a good chance of more celestial light shows all week.
   Clouds blocked the show for many, but people in several states,
including Colorado, New York, and Delaware, saw the night sky glow
various colors from a whitish green to a brilliant red late Sunday
and early today, the National Weather Service reported.
   Ron King of radio station KSL in Salt Lake City described the
lights, which appeared over the Great Salt Lake about 4 a.m. MST
today, as ``a shimmering cloud in the sky'' of vivid reds and
purples that lasted for about a half hour.
   The northern lights, or aurora borealis, are usually visible only
near the Arctic Circle.
   The phenomenon is believed to result from the interaction of tiny
charged particles from the sun with gases in the Earth's upper
atmosphere.
   A solar flare reported Thursday, described by experts as the
largest in five years, apparently triggered the unusually widespread
northern lights.
   Joe Allen, solar-terrestrial expert at the National Oceanic and
Atmospheric Administration in Boulder, Colo., said observatories
from San Juan, Puerto Rico, to Honolulu detected the shower of tiny
charged particles Sunday night.
   ``All of them have a beautiful record of the event. It started
about 6:30 p.m. (MST) Sunday and kept increasing over a period of at
least nine hours,'' he said today.
   Allen said there was a good chance all week of further displays
of northern lights across the northern third of the United States.
   In Delaware on Sunday, state police received reports from
residents about strangely lit clouds. Police concluded it was the
aurora borealis after checking for reports of military rocket tests
or power plant problems in the region.
   Researchers reported that Thursday's huge eruption of gas from
the surface of the sun was followed by another large explosion
Friday morning and three more on Saturday, all in the same area of
the sun.
   ``It's a very disturbed area _ probably two to three Earths in
diameter,'' said Tom Folkers, a technical specialist and telescope
operator at Kitt Peak National Observatory near Tucson, Ariz.
   Besides causing the aurora borealis, solar flares can disrupt
radio communications.

   Government experts met Monday to
pave the way for premiers from seven countries to tackle pressing
ecological problems.
   Deputy environmental ministers led delegations from
Czechoslovakia, Hungary, Austria, Poland, the Soviet Union, East
Germany and West Germany in discussion on the Czechoslovak
ecological initiative presented by Premier Ladislav Adamec in
December.
   He proposed a summit meeting in March, but standing ecological
disputes among these central European neighbors so far have
prevented action.
   Hungarian delegate Gyoergy Perczel proposed creating a joint
Czechoslovak-Austrian-Hungarian national park on Danube islands, in
an apparent move to oppose the controversial Gabcikovo-Nagymaros
hydroelectric project, a spokesman said.
   Hungarian ecologists oppose the Czechoslovak-Hungarian power
project on the Danube, and Budapest has said it may be the topic of
communist Hungary's first referendum.

   Torrential rain and floods in southern
Malawi killed six people and left 37,000 homeless, officials said
Monday.
   Floodwaters that swept away mud huts and prefabricated shelters
in Chikwawa and Nsanje districts drowned the six victims, including
two children, local administrators said.
   About 20,000 people are homeless in Nsanje, near the southeastern
border with Mozambique, according to a government administrator.
   Red Cross officials said 17,000 other homeless are receiving
food, blankets and tents at Chikwawa, about 70 miles south of
Blantyre.
   Some displaced families are being sheltered in schools, churches,
government and other brick buildings that withstood the flooding,
they said.
   Travelers arriving in Blantyre told of entire villages being
destroyed and widespread damage to corn crops in the worst floods
recorded since 1956.

   Students at two Rangoon campuses held
peaceful memorial services Monday for a student whose killing a year
ago prompted a serious challenge to authoritarian rule in Burma.
   Students ignored calls from left-leaning politicians to stage
street protests in memory of Maung Phone Maw.
   The 23-year-old student at the Rangoon Institute of Technology
was killed when riot police quashed a March 13, 1988, confrontation
between students at the institute and people living nearby.
   Anger over his death led to months of nationwide street marches
and demonstrations and caused resignations of two government leaders.
   Some concessions were made. But military commander Gen. Saw Maung
seized power in a September coup and his forces killed more than 500
people to crush protests.
   Saw Maung's military council since has allowed opposition
political activity and announced a general election will be held
early 1990.

   Lame-duck Mayor Eugene Sawyer today refused to
endorse a candidate in next month's mayoral election, despite
pressure from black leaders to throw his support behind third-party
hopeful Timothy Evans.
   ``After careful consideration, I have decided not to endorse any
candidate,'' Sawyer said.
   The Evans campaign had no immediate comment.
   Sawyer, 54, lost the Feb. 28 Democratic primary to Richard M.
Daley, 46, the son of Richard J. Daley, the legendary political boss
who ran City Hall for 22 years.
   Evans, 45, a black alderman, bypassed the primary to run as an
independent in the April 4 general election and will face white
candidates Daley and Edward Vrdolyak, 51, the Republican nominee.
   Analysts said Evans' lack of support for Sawyer, who also is
black, contributed to low primary turnout in black wards and was a
factor in Daley's victory. Sawyer today said he was not bitter about
Evans' failure to endorse him in the primary.
   Since the primary, a number of black community leaders, including
Jesse Jackson, have urged Sawyer to endorse Evans.
   ``All candidates have sought my endorsement,'' Sawyer said,
adding that he would do ``everything I can to ensure a smooth
transition'' for whoever is elected mayor.
   Sawyer also discouraged supporters from launching a write-in
campaign on his behalf. ``My race for mayor is over,'' he said.
   Daley spokeswoman Marj Halperin said that while Daley would have
liked Sawyer's endorsement ``we feel we are getting the support of
his supporters and that's what counts in the voting booth.''
   ``You have to ask the Evans campaign how it plays for them,'' she
added. ``With any endorsement issue, if they're not going to work
for us, we'd prefer they not work against us.''

   The two reusable solid booster
rockets that powered the shuttle Discovery toward orbit appeared in
good condition to the crew on the ships that saw them splash into
the Atlantic Ocean, an official said Monday.
   The two recovery ships were about 10 miles away from where the
rockets hit the water 160 miles offshore, according to Michael
Hardee, who works at NASA's Marshall Space Flight Center in
Huntsville, Ala.
   The ships reached the rockets 45 minutes later and circled them
once before beginning the process of retrieval to tow them in. That
will take at least a day.
   The rockets separated from the shuttle 2 minutes, 6 seconds after
liftoff and hit the water about five minutes after that.
   After the fuel is spent, each casing weighs about 165,000 pounds.
   The boosters were completely redesigned after the failure of one
of their joints was blamed for the explosion that destroyed
Challenger after liftoff on Jan. 28, 1986. The new models have
performed well on the two previous flights.

<HEAD>IRS Auditing Finances of 23 TV Ministries</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JIM LUTHER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Tax Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Internal Revenue Service is auditing the
finances of 23 television ministries and expects the probe could
jeopardize the federal tax exemption of some evangelists.
   ``The service is continuing to devote significant examination
resources to media evangelist cases,'' Robert I. Brauer, assistant
IRS commissioner in charge of exempt organizations, said in a letter
to Rep. J.J. Pickle, D-Texas, chairman of the House Ways and Means
oversight subcommittee. Pickle released the report Monday.
   Because of privacy laws, the report did not mention the
ministries by name. Identifying them only by number, Brauer outlined
key issues against the 23, most of which are suspected of not fully
reporting their income, engaging in political activities, or
allowing their earnings to benefit officials of the ministry.
   The IRS stepped up its examination of TV ministries after the
well-publicized sex-and-bribery scandal at the PTL organization
headed by Jim Bakker.
   PTL, which apparently is ministry No. 15 in the report, is in
bankruptcy court, where the IRS is pressing claims that Bakker and
his associates failed to pay tax on unrelated business income, such
as from rental of PTL's satellite network; failed to report some
income, and used PTL contributions for their own enrichment,
including acceptance of salaries that the IRS contends were
excessive.
   Brauer said he expects several of the TV ministry cases ``will
move to the final stages of the examination process this year.''
   ``We also anticipate that some of these cases will present
serious issues relating to continued federal income tax exemption,''
Brauer said.
   Brauer's cover letter said two organizations connected with
former Republican presidential candidate Pat Robertson have refused
to provide records of the type that other TV ministries have
provided voluntarily.
   Because the Freedom Council and the National Freedom Institute
would not cooperate, the letter stated, the IRS had to go to federal
court in Norfolk, Va., to seek to enforce a summons for the records.
   ``The degree of cooperation received by the service varies from
case to case and, in one case involving a prominent evangelist, the
service has reached agreement on federal tax issues for the years
1980 through 1983, including payment of substantial federal income
tax, interest and penalties,'' Brauer wrote.
   Here are highlights of the report, which was current through Dec.
31:
   _Ministry No. 1 was engaged in a lifestyle that led the IRS to
believe that some income was not reported. Acting on an informant's
tip, the Criminal Investigation Division prepared a case that has
been referred to a federal grand jury.
   _No. 4: IRS agents are reviewing content of TV broadcasts to
determine whether they were primarily political.
   _No. 8: A team of auditors and a computer specialist are
investigating allegations of political activities, lobbying and
personal enrichment from ministry funds.
   _No. 11: As a result of a newspaper story, the IRS is auditing
the minister's individual tax return; the minister is not
cooperating.
   _No. 12: A computer picked this minister's return for audit on
grounds of unsubstantiated deductions. The case was closed with
payment of $3,000 tax and penalties.
   _No. 16: The IRS has completed review of the books and records
for this ministry for 1984 through 1986; the chief issue is whether
tax-deductible contributions to the ministry flowed to the benefit
of the founder and his family. Alleged political activities also are
being reviewed.
   _No. 20: The minister's personal tax return was audited; he was
alleged to have channeled church assets to personal use. The case
was closed when he reported additional taxable income.

<HEAD>`Team Spirit' Exercises Begin Tuesday; North Korea Issues Warning</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SEOUL, South Korea (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Joint U.S.-South Korea military
maneuvers involving about 200,000 soldiers begin Tuesday amid
repeated warnings from North Korea that the exercises push the
peninsula closer to war.
   The 10-day ``Team Spirit'' exercises, an annual event since 1976,
will last until March 23 and take place in various parts of the
country, officials from South Korea and the United States said
Monday.
   As in past years, the emphasis will be on improving defensive
readiness of the two countries, the officials said.
   President Roh Tae-woo, visiting a command post north of Seoul,
said the exercises are needed to guard the safety of South Korea
against invasion from North Korea.
   ``The latest situations on the peninsula are pointing to the
danger of a war, and a close security alliance between the two
countries (the United States and South Korea) is really needed,''
Roh said.
   North Korea has protested the maneuvers in past years. It put its
army on combat alert over the weekend and issued another protest
Monday.
   ``The tension between the North and the South has been screwed up
to the highest pitch, and a dangerous situation has been created on
the Korean peninsula in which a war may break out any moment,'' said
Pyongyang's official Korean Central News Agency.
   The peninsula was divided into communist North Korea and
capitalist South Korea at the end of World War II, when U.S. and
Soviet troops ended Japan's colonial rule over the region. The two
Koreas have remained bitter enemies and fought a war from 1950 to
1953.
   A U.S. military spokesman in Seoul said this year's ``Team
Spirit'' involve about 70,000 American troops, including 43,000
stationed in South Korea and 27,000 from Hawaii, Okinawa and the
U.S. mainland.
   As in previous years, South Korea invited North Korea and China
to observe the exercises. The two communist nations rejected all
past invitations, and there was no response as of Monday.
   Officials of the United Nations Command speculated the ``Team
Spirit'' controversy was behind North Korea's request for a meeting
of the Korean Military Armistice Commission, the watchdog body set
up to monitor the 1953 Korean War Armistice agreement.
   North Korea asked for a session Friday but gave no reason. The
U.N. Command proposed it be held Saturday.
   Also Monday, the South Korean government said it spent more for
U.S. troops stationed in the country than any other nation in the
world last year.
   The report by the Defense Ministry said an active publicity
campaign is needed to make Washington understand that South Korea's
share of defense burden is greater than those of NATO and Japan.
   According to the report, Seoul's support for the 43,000 U.S.
troops in South Korea was worth $2.2 billion last year, $313 million
more than in 1987.

<HEAD>Ambassador Reprimanded for Part in Nuclear Debate</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BERN, Switzerland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Switzerland's former ambassador to
Mexico has been reprimanded for airing his views on nuclear power in
an interview in the Central American country, the government said
Monday.
   Marcel Disler was reported to have commented in October on the
television station ``Televisa'' that the Swiss have no problems with
their nuclear power stations and no fears over safety. This was at
the height of a debate in Mexico over the opening of a new nuclear
plant that flared immediately before a change of government.
   In a statement responding to questions raised in parliament, the
Federal Executive rebuked the former ambassador for lack of
discretion in a controversial situation.
   Disler since has been replaced.

<HEAD>Rats and Chicken Embryos In Space!</HEAD>

<DATELINE>SPACE CENTER, Houston (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Thirty-two fertilized eggs, courtesy
of Kentucky Fried Chicken, are whirling through space aboard
Discovery along with four white rats to test how weightlessness
affects growth and broken bones.
   The projects, both designed by students, are among five
experiments to be conducted during the five-day shuttle mission,
which began Monday and is to end Saturday.
   The chicken embryo experiment, developed by college senior John
Vellinger, is a copy of one destroyed in the Challenger explosion
Jan. 28, 1986.
   Vellinger's experiment, nicknamed ``Chix in Space,'' is an
incubator containing 32 eggs, half of which were fertilized two days
prior to launch and half nine days before.
   A copy of the same experiment will be conducted on the ground,
said Vellinger, a senior in mechanical engineering at Purdue
University. The eggs on the ground will be turned to mimic the
action a mother hen would take to keep the developing yolk from
sinking.
   But in zero gravity, the yolks should float in the center and not
have to be turned, said the 23-year-old student, who first thought
of the idea as a ninth-grader in Lafayette, Ind.
   After the flight, half of each group will be opened and the
remaining half will be allowed to hatch. Both sets will be studied
to determine the effects of weightlessness on the growing embryo.
The experiment may one day help scientists determine whether a human
fetus could develop normally in space, Vellinger said.
   Richard M. Detwiler, spokesman for Louisville, Ky.-based Kentucky
Fried Chicken, said NASA approached the company several years ago
about sponsoring the project.
   ``It was an exciting educational program worthy of our support,''
Detwiler said, adding tongue-in-cheek: ``And if it helps us crack
the exterrestrial chicken market, then all the better.''
   Detwiler said the company had spent more than $50,000 on the
project. Vellinger has been a summer intern at the company's
engineering department.
   For the rat experiment, a veterinarian removed a small piece of
bone from the rear leg of 
shortly before liftoff. Four of the rats were put on the shuttle,
while the others remain on Earth.
   ``This is an extremely non-traumatic procedure,'' said student
Andrew Fras when asked about using animals for experiments. ``They
should be carrying on as normal about an hour after the procedure is
done.
   Fras, a 22-year-old medical student at Brown University who was
in high school in Binghamton, N.Y., when he thought of the idea,
hopes the test will show whether weightlessness and the loss of
calcium that bones sustain during spaceflights inhibit the healing
process.
   After the flight, all eight rats will be killed so the bones'
mending processes can be studied and compared.
   The project has been criticized as cruel and unnecessary by
People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals, an animal rights group
based in Washington.
   ``Whatever happens to the bones of those rats in space is not
going to keep people from engaging in space travel,'' said
spokeswoman Mary Beth Sweetland.
   oots grow in space.
Researchers are flying samples of the common daylilly and a weed
named happlopappis gracilis. The results may lead to a better
understanding of plant growth on Earth and should provide
information on how to grow plants on the space station, the moon or
Mars.
   A device that may be used as a cooling system aboard the space
station also is being be tested on Discovery.
   The Space Station Heat Pipe Advanced Radiator Element, resembling
a giant slat of a venetian blind, is riding in the payload bay. It
consists of two small pipes bored through an aluminum core that runs
through the center of a 51-foot-long, foot-wide radiator.
   The device uses liquid ammonia that is vaporized by heat
generated by various shuttle systems. The vapor carries the heat the
length of the radiator through the larger vapor pipe, and the
radiator dissipates into space, leaving cooled, condensed ammonia
that can be recirculated.
   Another experiment, the protein crystal growth project, has flown
on several missions. Crystals can be grown on Earth, but gravity
causes them to sink and fuse together.
   Samples of 15 different proteins are on Discovery, including
renin, an enzyme that plays a major role in controlling blood
pressure, and porcine elastase, an enzyme involved in the
degradation of lung tissue in people suffering from emphysema.
   The crystals could help scientists determine the proteins'
molecular structure and speed development of drugs to combat their
ill effects.

   A federal law enforcement official today said
two Middle Eastern-looking men were in Will Rogers' neighborhood,
looking for the home of the USS Vincennes skipper, in the weeks
before a van driven by his wife was bombed.
   The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said it was
not clear if investigators had been able to piece together detailed
descriptions of the two men. The information was based on interviews
with neighbors, the official said.
   Rogers commanded the missile cruiser that mistakenly shot down an
Iranian airliner in the Persian Gulf last July, killing all 290
people aboard.
   Rogers' wife, Sharon, was driving the van alone Friday when the
bomb exploded, destroying the vehicle. Mrs. Rogers wasn't injured.
   On Sunday, the FBI appealed for information about the bombing.
   ``We would like to find somebody who saw something very
suspicious and out of place,'' FBI spokesman Gene Riehl said.
``We're looking for people who saw anything suspicious.''
   Investigators remained uncertain today whether the bomb was the
work of terrorists retaliating for the jetliner's downing.
   The law enforcement official who said the men were spotted asking
where the Navy captain lived spoke following a report in today's New
York Times that a man of Middle Eastern appearance asked passers-by,
``Where does the captain live?''
   The FBI described the bomb as ``an improvised explosive device''
that wasn't made by the military and may have been homemade. Types
of such devices include pipe bombs, Riehl said.
   Tom Hughes, head of the bureau's San Diego office, said it will
take a lengthy analysis to determine exactly what type of bomb was
used.
   FBI laboratory experts spent Sunday sifting through three drums
filled with debris collected at the intersection where thken to an undisclosed
FBI garage, Riehl
said.
   FBI officials also met Sunday with representatives of the Naval
Investigative Service; the federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and
Firearms; San Diego Police; and the coers had driven the van earlier Friday
for a regular trip to a
nearby doughnut shop and he thought he may have been the intended
target, said Sen. Pete Wilson, R-Calif., who talked with the captain.
   Hughes and Dennis Usery, regional director of the Naval
Investigative Service, met Sunday with the Rogerses. They have been
under the protection of NIS agents at an undisclosed location since
shortly after the bombing.
   ``I think the meeting was more to reassure them a little bit or
to help them through their trouble,'' Riehl said.
   Usery described the couple as being ``in good spirits,'' and said
the security for them would continue indefinitely.
   Chief Petty Officer Craig Huebler, a spokesman for the San Diego
Naval Base, said Navy officials are awaiting FBI findings to
determine when the couple will return to work. Rogers remains in
command of the Vincennes, whose home port is San Diego, and Mrs.
Rogers is a teacher.
   An Iranian newspaper Sunday blamed the FBI for the bombing,
saying Washington tried to implicate Iran in the attack to justify
deportation of Iranian students.
   Riehl declined to comment on the claim, but in Washington, FBI
spokeswoman Kathy Kennedy denied it and added, ``we have never made
any linkage to Iran since this incident happened.''
   ``We haven't gotten to the point (in the investigation) where we
could make such a linkage,'' she said.
   The English-language newspaper Kayhan International linked the
alleged U.S. plot to Western anger at Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini's
order that novelist Salman Rushdie be killed for his new novel,
``The Satanic Verses.''
   The bombing ``will not be the last attempt to implicate Iran''
over the Rushdie controversy, the editorial said.

<HEAD>Moslems Shell Beirut Port; Airport Reopens</HEAD>

<DATELINE>BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Christian army units and Moslem militiamen
clashed Monday in heavy artillery duels across Beirut, and police
said one person was injured.
   Eight mortar rounds fired from Moslem west Beirut's Eein Mriesseh
district crashed into the army-controlled city harbor, forcing
several merchant ships to sail into open waters, a police spokesman
said.
   Army troops at the port fired back. There was no report of any
vessel being hit, said the spokesman, who cannot be identified under
standing rules.
   Both sides also battled with machine guns, rocket-propelled
grenades and 106mm recoilless guns in downtown Beirut's old
commercial district straddling the port. The spokesman said at least
one passer-by was wounded.
   Mortar shells also were lobbed into the Christian residential
district of Jommaizeh and at the Syrian-manned 40-story unfinished
Murr Tower skyscraper, according to the spokesman.
   The port bombardment came a few hours after the reopening of
Beirut's international airport, which was closed Saturday by the
Christian Cabinet in Lebanon's dual government. It broke a
cease-fire that had been declared at midnight.
   The rival Moslem Cabinet had threatened to sever Lebanon's sea
links with the outside world in retaliation for the airport closure.
   ``The decision dated March 11 to temporarily close Beirut airport
has been cancelled and flight operations are to resume at once,''
said Christian Public Works Minister Edgar Malouf.
   ``The sudden security deterioration that warranted the closure of
the airport has now ceased to exist,'' Malouf said.
   About 30 minutes later, a jetliner of the Lebanese cargo carrier
Trans-Mediterranean Airways left for Amsterdam. Another TMA plane
left later for Sharjah in the United Arab Emirates. Both planes were
empty, airport officials said.
   A Middle East Airlines spokesman, Assad Khorshid, said MEA
flights would resume ``once international insurance companies give
us the green light.''
   International insurance companies on Sunday advised MEA,
Lebanon's national carrier, they had temporarily suspended insurance
on its passengers and aircraft.
   Six people have died since Wednesday in Christian-Moslem clashes
around the city.
   The violence was touched off when the army commander, Gen. Michel
Aoun, who also heads the Christian Cabinet, began enforcing an air
and sea blockade aimed at illegal harbors operated by Moslem and
Christian militias.
   Hostilities focused on the strategic Christian-held town of Souk
El-Gharb, which controls a network of roads leading from Druse-held
mountains to the Christian heartland. The town is 15 miles southeast
of Beirut.
   The deserted summer resort, whose 15,000 residents fled early in
Lebanon's nearly 14-year-old civil war, is surrounded by Druse
artillery positions.
   The conservative Beirut newspaper Ad-Diyar said a compromise was
under consideration to resolve the crisis over illegal ports, which
militias use to bring in arms, supplies and imported goods sold in
the areas they control.
   According to the report, the compromise would include a freeze of
the port blockade; stationing of customs officers and police by the
Moslem Cabinet in the harbors; and deposits of port taxes at the
central bank, which would handle the money in coordination with the
Christian and Moslem Cabinets.
   The fighting has imperiled efforts to resolve a political crisis
that has left Lebanon without a president since Sept. 22, when
President Amin Gemayel's term expired.
   Minutes before he stepped down, Gemayel named Aoun, a fellow
Maronite Catholic, as head of an interim military Cabinet. Moslems
and leftists rejected the appointment and pledged allegiance to
Salim Hoss, a Sunni Moslem who governed under Gemayel.

   A Holocaust survivor was convicted Monday of
aggravated assault for hurling acid in the face of a lawyer
representing convicted Nazi war criminal John Demjanjuk.
   Yisrael Yehezkieli, 70, was convicted after he confessed that he
threw acid in the face of Yoram Sheftel, Demjanjuk's defense
attorney, in December, Israel radio said.
   The incident occurred during the funeral of another Demjanjuk
attorney, Dov Eitan, who committed suicide. A woman standing next to
Sheftel suffered minor injuries during the acid attack.
   Yehezkieli will be sentenced May 4, the radio said. The crime
carries a maximum sentence of 20 years in jail.
   Sheftel still suffers eye damage because of the attack. As a
result, the appeal in Demjanjuk's conviction and death penalty has
been postponed until November.
   Demjanjuk, a 68-year-old Ohio autoworker, was sentenced to death
last year for crimes against humanity and against the Jewish people.
   He was convicted of being the guard ``Ivan the Terrible'' who
operated the gas chambers at the Treblinka death camp in
German-occupied Poland in World War II. About 850,000 Jews were
killed in Treblinka, including most members of Yehezkieli's family.

<TEXT>
   Former national security adviser Robert
McFarlane testified today that he never told Oliver North to lie to
Congress about his activities on behalf of the Nicaraguan Contra
rebels.
   Asked whether he discussed with North being ``less than
truthful'' to Congress, McFarlane responded:
   ``Not per se. ... You do not lie to Congress. In my experience
... often congressmen do not tell us everything'' on their agenda
and the executive branch ``did not always tell the Congress
everything on its agenda. You put your own interpretation'' on it.
``You present the truth as it best explains your behavior.''
   McFarlane said he told North that ``whatever we said would
engender criticism from the Congress'' and that North ``agreed.''
   Four of the 12 criminal charges against North are that he made
false statements or obstructed Congress by denying to two
congressional panels in 1985 that he was involved with the Contras.
   Queries to McFarlane came in letters from Rep. Lee Hamilton,
D-Ind., then chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, and
former Rep. Michael Barnes, D-Md., then chairman of the House
subcommittee on Western Hemisphere affairs.
   Testifying for the second day at North's trial, McFarlane
acknowledged under questioning by prosecutor John Keker that North
did not tell him everything about his involvement with private
fund-raising on behalf of the Contras.
   McFarlane said he questioned North in the late summer of 1985
when Congress was asking about North's activities in response to
news reports about North's activities. The inquiries were during a
two-year congressional ban on military aid to the guerrillas.
   McFarlane said he questioned North closely about his activities
because of six memos written earlier by North to McFarlane
suggesting that North was deeply involved with the guerrillas.
   ``This was a very thorough kind of discussion the two of us had
on more than one occasion,'' McFarlane said. ``I believe I had a
clear understanding and he was very emphatic in saying `at no time
did I break the law on fund-raising.'''
   McFarlane said North told him he made speeches on behalf of the
Contras but never solicited contributions because as a federal
employee he was prohibited from doing so.
   Keker asked McFarlane whether North told him about his
involvement with the National Endowment for the Preservation of
Liberty, a tax-exempt organization that raised money for the Contras.
   ``No,'' responded McFarlane.
   McFarlane also said North didn't tell him that he was controlling
the flow of donations sent through NEPL to the Contras.
   The former national security adviser also said North told him
nothing of his ties to Richard Miller, a public relations consultant
who funneled money for the Contras out of the United States to a
Cayman Islands bank account.
   McFarlane said he also questioned North about whether a signal
had been given to the country of Taiwan that the U.S. government
supported a contribution for the Contras from Taiwan.
   McFarlane said North told him in the late summer of 1985 that
nothing had been done.
   McFarlane then testified, under questioning from Keker, that
North didn't tell him that on Aug. 19, 1985, North had given his
courier to the Contras, Robert Owen, a bank account number to which
the Taiwanese government could make a contribution to the Contras.
   Of a Sept. 12, 1985 response to Barnes denying National Security
Council involvement in Contra fund-raising, McFarlane said: ``It's
an accurate expression of what Colonel North said.''
   McFarlane said he discussed with President Reagan in a meeting
attended by Vice President George Bush the fact that Congress was
asking questions and that Reagan never told him to misrepresent the
facts in responding to the inquiries.
   On Friday, McFarlane said he told North to ``do everything you
can'' to keep the Nicaraguan Contras intact during a congressional
ban on aid to the guerrillas.
   McFarlane said he gave that instruction to North because
President Reagan had directed that the Contras be maintained as a
fighting force despite the aid ban.
   North interpreted the policy to mean ``many, many things,
including weapons,'' and ``I am responsible'' for that, McFarlane
testified in North's Iran-Contra coverup trial.
   Carrying out Reagan's policy, McFarlane said he told North and
another then-National Security Council aide, Donald Fortier, ``to do
everything you can to keep'' the Contras functioning.
   McFarlane, whose testimony was to continue today, is at the
center of four charges alleging that North lied to Congress.
   It was McFarlane who signed two letters allegedly prepared by
North in 1985 and sent to House committees, denying that the
National Security Council staff solicited money or other support for
the Contras and denying that they offered the Contras advice.
   North also is accused of preparing responses to a series of
questions sent to McFarlane by the House Intelligence Committee. In
those responses, McFarlane denied that North or other NSC staffers
helped move supplies to the Contras or were involved in fund raising.
   North became involved in a private fund-raising operation for the
Contras and oversaw a weapons supply operation to the rebels.

<TEXT>
   Former White House press secretary James S.
Brady, wounded in the attempted assassination of then-President
Reagan eight years ago, told reporters Monday he has a new job and a
new goal: working for public acceptance of the disabled.
   After walking from his wheelchair to a row of microphones 15 feet
away, Brady, known to his friends as ``Bear,'' pronounced himself
ready for work.
   ``My eight years of rehabilitation and PT _ pain and torture _
are now over, and I'm anxious to get on with this new assignment,''
Brady said at a news conference. ``The Bear is back, for good now,
and you'll be hearing from me often.''
   Brady, who retired from his White House job earlier this year,
said he accepted an unpaid position as vice chairman of the National
Organization on Disability, a private, non-profit group promoting
the interests of the disabled.
   ``Now that I'm one of the 37 million people with disabilities, I
know what it's like: the daily frustration and problems,'' he said.
``My family and I have been fortunate over the past eight years to
have the support of friends, family and people from all across the
country. That support system has been invaluable to me in my
recovery.
   ``Now, I want to help provide a support system for others.''
   Both President Bush and Reagan sent congratulatory messages to
Brady _ Bush in a letter and Reagan in a telegram.
   ``Your comeback has made us all proud,'' Bush wrote. ``You never
lost your determination to recover, your patient disposition or your
wonderful sense of humor.''
   Brady, 48, was shot in the head on March 30, 1981, during an
attempt on the life of Reagan and has been receiving therapy since
then.
   Reagan kept him in the title of press secretary, and he continued
to receive his salary of $89,500 a year as an assistant to the
president. He reported to the White House about one day a week to
visit with associates, sign autographs and pose for pictures.
   He has held several government jobs since coming to Washington in
1973 as a communications consultant to the House, and is eligible
for a government pension.
   ``Serving as a volunteer, Jim will participate in board meetings,
work with the media on disability matters _ especially in improving
attitudes toward disabled persons _ and strengthen our relationships
with corporate, governmental and community groups,'' said Alan
Reich, president of the National Organization on Disability.
   In addition to the volunteer job, Brady said he is considering
writing a regular newspaper column ``that might help sensitize more
people'' and also has discussed the possibility of working with the
administration on issues affecting the disabled.
   ``When you are one, you learn the frustrations and all the cuts
and all the slights and everything that everyone else goes
through,'' he said. ``You vow then to make it better, and that's
what I'm going to try to do.''

   Chicago-born Abe Stolar arrived in the
West with his family today, his first trip outside the Soviet Union
since his parents brought him there more than a half-century ago.
   ``Now I feel safe '' Stolar said after he stepped off the
Austrian Airlines flight from Moscow at Vienna's Schwechat airport.
``I'm just beginning to feel as if I've woken up. I'm not quite
awake. I've been asleep for years.''
   He praised the airport as ``something beautiful ... un-Soviet.''
   Stolar, who has been trying to leave the Soviet Union since 1975,
arrived with his wife, son, daughter-in-law and two grandchildren.
They plan to settle in Israel.
   In an interview before leaving Moscow's Sheremetyevo Airport, the
77-year-old Stolar said his thoughts today were not of Israel, but
of the United States, which he left in 1931.
   ``When I left Chicago at the age of 19, we were leaving on a
train at night for New York, and I felt as if I was leaving on an
adventure and I was coming back. Here, I was riding on a taxi coming
here and didn't feel anything at all,'' said the balding Stolar, who
paced nervously at the Moscow airport.
   Stolar said he hoped to visit the United States soon and would
head ``straight from Israel to Chicago.''
   His 29-year-old son, Michael, is an observant Jew, and
interrupted an interview in Moscow to pray with his father and a
group of friends who taught themselves Hebrew.
   ``Anyone Jewish around? We need a 10th one,'' the younger Stolar
shouted in the bustling departure hall.
   Jewish law requires the presence of 10 men for prayers, and
Stolar had not brought enough friends.
   After several minutes, a Jewish man at the airport agreed to join
them, and a service was conducted in Hebrew in front of the currency
exchange counter.
   Abe Stolar, speaking English fluently, said he did not consider
himself a refusenik _ a Soviet Jew refused permission to emigrate _
because he always has been a U.S. citizen.
   ``I was an American, pure and simple, and so I considered myself
a hostage all these 13 years,'' he said.
   Stolar's struggle had been the subject of high-level superpower
negotiations for years, and President Reagan took a personal
interest in the case. The two sat together at a U.S. Embassy
reception last summer for Soviets denied permission to emigrate.
   Stolar traveled to the Soviet Union with his parents, who were
Russian emigres and ardent Communists. His father died in Josef
Stalin's purges.
   Abe Stolar, his wife and and his son have been trying to emigrate
since 1975. They got as far as the entrance ramp of their plane when
Soviet officials stopped Stolar's wife, claiming she had access to
state secrets.
   The family received permission to leave again in the mid-1980s,
but Stolar's son married and had children, creating more problems.
His daughter-in-law was denied permission to emigrate. She received
approval in December.
   Many long-term refuseniks have been allowed to emigrate under
Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's relaxation of restrictions,
but Michael Stolar said he knows of many Jews still barred from
leaving.

   The crackdown on aliens crossing the border from
Mexico into Texas has sharply reduced the stream of Central American
refugees reaching the Miami area, perhaps by as much as half, say
church and immigration officials.
   But they agree the U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service
decision to detain undocumented immigrants in southern Texas, rather
than allow them to leave that area during asylum appeals, has not
stopped the flow of aliens joining friends and relatives in Miami's
Hispanic community.
   ``The crackdown has slowed it down slightly, but they're still
coming,'' said Robert Fannin, district superintendent of the Miami
district of United Methodist Churches.
   Officials of the Nicaraguan American Foundation, which helps
refugees with immigration paperwork, say that since the Feb. 21 INS
crackdown they have received only 96 requests from people who
identified themselves as Nicaraguans.
   ``It's less than half of what it was before,'' said foundation
President Maritza Herrera.
   Immigration officials say it's hard to know how many are arriving
unnoticed.
   ``I can't scientifically quantify the amount, because many have
gone underground,'' said district INS director Perry Rivkind.
   Some city officials have estimated that a total of 100,000
Nicaraguans could enter the Miami area through next fall.
   Those who do arrive continue to find a community that accepts
them with open arms. Although government agencies are limited, the
city's churches still make room for them.
   Refugees showing up at the Shenandoah Presbyterian Church in
Little Havana are fed, clothed and housed, even though the church is
feeling the burden.
   ``We're stretched to the limit,'' said church official Morris
Maxwell. ``But we have no choice.''
   The church's pastor, the Rev. William Iverson, said many refugees
arrive hungry, homeless and ill. ``When you see it firsthand, it's
not easy to turn your back,'' he said.
   All agree housing is the toughest problem to solve.
   After the city moved 300 Nicaraguans out of the downtown Bobby
Maduro Miami Stadium earlier this year, most of them wound up on
their feet, but about 20 families without work permits are in danger
of eviction from their apartments.
   ``We're checking into it,'' said City Manager Cesar Odio. ``If
they're going to be thrown out, we have to do something about it.''
   Odio said he hoped to find an additional $4,000 from private
groups that have previously sponsored Nicaraguans here.

   Six organizations are asking news media around
the world to publicize the fourth anniversary of Terry Anderson's
kidnapping on Thursday.
   ``Today, March 16, 1989, the American journalist Terry Anderson,
41, chief Middle East correspondent for The Associated Press in
Beirut, entered his fifth year of captivity as a hostage in
Lebanon,'' said a statement that the groups asked broadcasters to
air and newspapers to use on their front pages.
   The ``statement of solidarity with Anderson'' is from ``the
leading freedom of expression organizations in the Western world,''
Anne Nelson, executive director of the New York-based Committee to
Protect Journalists, said Monday.
   Ms. Nelson said she also will read the statement Thursday at the
National Press Club in Washington during a news conference
announcing her group's ``annual attacks-on-the-press report.''
   A speech by Vice President Dan Quayle on freedom of the press is
scheduled at the Press Club later Thursday.
   ``We call on President Bush and Vice President Quayle to use
every possible means at their disposal to bring Terry Anderson and
the other hostages home,'' Ms. Nelson said.
   Other organizations urging publication of the anniversary
statement are: Article 19 of London; International Federation of
Publishers in Paris; the International Federation of Journalists in
Brussels; Index on Censorship in London; and Observatoire de
L'Information in France.
   In a separate letter to its members, the 150,000-member
International Federation of Journalists said: ``On March 16, another
shameful date in the calendar passes _ the fourth anniversary of
captivity for American journalist Terry Anderson, who is held
hostage in Beirut.''
   The IFJ asked its members in 37 nations to draw attention to the
plight of British journalist John McCarthy, who marked his 1,000th
day of captivity on Jan. 10.
   The IFJ said it will place advertisements in Beirut newspapers to
urge the release of all hostages.
   IFJ members also were urged to send letters requesting diplomatic
initiatives to the ambassadors of the United States, the United
Kingdom, Syria and Iran and to ``publicize the plight of the
journalists'' in union journals and national media.
   In London, IFJ Secretary General Aidan White will be accompanied
by McCarthy's girlfriend, Gill Morell, and several trade union
leaders when they meet with U.S. Embassy officials.
   Elsewhere, Charles Dale, the president of the Newspaper Guild of
the United States and Canada, will lead a delegation to the U.S.
State Department in Washington on Thursday.
   In Strasbourg, France, Doornaert and French journalist Jean-Paul
Kauffmann, a former hostage in Lebanon, will meet with European
Parliament leaders to press for the hostages' release.

   John Larroquette, who plays the prosecutor on the
television comedy ``Night Court,'' says he considered suicide before
conquering alcoholism.
   ``I sat down one night, put a pistol on the table and wrote a
suicide note,'' Larroquette said in an interview in the April issue
of Redbook magazine.
   ``But I realized that I didn't consider any of the notes funny
enough. I thought. ...`You can't do it until you figure out the
perfect exit line. It seems you want to have some sort of effect on
this world.' So I talked myself out of it,'' said Larroquette, 41.
   The Louisiana-born actor said he struggled to quit drinking for
three years before going cold turkey on Feb. 6, 1982. ``One night I
said to myself, `There are no more deals. Whatever it takes, I don't
want to feel like this anymore.'''
   The next year, he was hired for the role of Dan Fielding on
``Night Court'' and went on to win four Emmys in a row.
   ``An old man once told me, `Boy, you've been insane. Insanity is
the repetition of the same action, expecting different results,'''
said Larroquette. ``One day I said, `I'm not going to repeat those
actions today.' And lo and behold, different results occurred.''

   John Walsh, host of Fox Television's
``America's Most Wanted,'' says death threats he has received will
not sway the dedication he feels to the program.
   Walsh, in an interview for the March 18 edition of TV Guide
magazine, said he vowed after the abduction and death of his
6-year-old son, Adam, in 1981 that he would do anything he could to
see that criminals are brought to justice.
   ``This show is a very tough thing for me to do,'' said Walsh, 43.
``I'm not Dan Rather or Tom Brokaw. I am the father of a murdered
child.''
   Walsh said, ``I don't look at it as a TV show. I look at it as if
it were a job as important as addressing the Legislature.''
   Walsh set up the National Center for Missing and Exploited
Children and has pushed for laws to protect children from abduction.
   The program made its premiere in February 1988 and has led to the
arrests of 64 of the 124 fugitives it profiled.
   Walsh said the negative side of the television program is that he
and his family have received numerous death threats. A son and a
daughter have been born since Adam's death and Walsh reported that
he and his family have moved several times. He said the family now
lives in Florida in virtual hiding.

   When people hear that a U.S. Supreme
Court justice is in their midst, they often walk up to John O'Connor
and tell him how pleased they are to meet him.
   John's not the justice, of course. His wife, Justice Sandra Day
O'Connor, shared that and other anecdotes about her experiences on
the high court with the Louisiana State University Law Center
Fellows on Saturday at Nottoway Plantation.
   Mrs. O'Connor spent the day at the Law Center, where she talked
with students and learned to eat Louisiana's succulent seasonal
specialty, crawfish.
   She said her nomination in 1981 to be the first woman on the
Supreme Court was a surprise to her and she was not ready for the
sudden fame.
   ``The first year made me yearn for obscurity,'' she said. ``The

   Queen Elizabeth II will not renew the contract of
Dick Hern, who has trained horses for the queen since 1967 and from
a wheelchair since a 1984 hunting accident, Buckingham Palace
announced Monday.
   A statement by the queen's press secretary said Willie
Hastings-Bass will replace Hern, 68, one of the most successful
trainers in Britain since World War II.
   No reason was given for the decision to let Hern's contract
expire in November, but he has been under pressure to retire in
recent months because of his health. He broke his neck in the 1984
accident and underwent major heart surgery last fall.
   Hern, who began his racing career in 1952, has been national
champion trainer four times and saddled more than 1,000 winners.
   Hastings-Bass, 41, who has trained horses for the queen for 10
years, saddled 31 winners last year to win the equivalent of
$280,000.

<HEAD>French Fashion Looks East for New Markets</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SUZY PATTERSON</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   As designers gear up for the frenetic winter
ready-to-wear marathon in Paris, one of France's top fashion
executives is packing his bags for China, where he sees a big new
market for French clothes.
   ``We have to stay one jump ahead of the game,'' Jacques Mouclier,
president of the French Federation of Couture and Ready-to-Wear,
said in an interview.
   Fashion affairs are moving steadily eastward, with a resurgence
of individual enterprise in China and the Soviet Union, Mouclier
said.
   The ready-to-wear shows start in Paris on Wednesday.
   Mouclier is leaving March 24 for Beijing and Shanghai, where
Chinese audiences will get a look at French luxury in shows
featuring 150 outfits by about 25 French designers.
   Western markets are nearing a saturation point and the United
States is slowing up as a giant consumer, Mouclier said.
   ``We'll maintain our exports to the U.S.A., but I don't see any
increase,'' he said.
   He and other industry experts foresee the big increases coming
from countries such as South Korea.
   ``They are heading the way of Japan,'' he said. ``That means they
will work in the framework of French fashion and become big
consumers of it.''
   Mouclier himself brought Japanese into the French fold when he
saw they were gaining momentum in design and manufacture.
   At the end of the 1970s, many Japanese were showing in Paris
ready-to-wear shows under the aegis of the French Fashion
Federation. That meant, in theory, that they were not blatantly
lifting French ideas to manufacture solely for their own profit in
Japan.
   In the long term, he sees China, India and the Soviet Union as
the major sources of industry and growth, beginning with China.
   ``Russia is not quite ripe for us yet. Though they seem to be
changing fairly rapidly, it will take time for us to make real
inroads there,'' he said. ``The Chinese are more adaptable and have
a history of trade and commerce.
   ``Pierre Cardin and Yves Saint Laurent have already shown
individually in China, and Cardin has manufacturing agreements,'' he
said.
   India has an excellent future as a market, but the situation
there is tricky, as well. ``The population is huge, of course. But
so far only a certain class is concerned by what we're selling. And
they're dispersed all over the subcontinent. The problem is that
there is no one city center or area for reaching potential
consumers.''
   While aiming at market expansion, Mouclier believes French
fashion is financially healthy, with a $54 million turnover in haute
couture, with 3,000 clients. Ready-to-wear and accessories total
about $750 million, with a regular yearly increase of 10 percent.
   He admits the figures are a drop in the bucket compared with
heavy industry. ``But you can't compare clothes to cars,'' he added.
   Mouclier estimates about 7,000 will see three shows at the
Beijing Opera and 1,000 in Shanghai. ``There's enormous demand. I
don't know how the audiences will be chosen.''
   ``Think of the potential consumers in China,'' said Mouclier.
``Their population is over a billion.''

<HEAD>Foreign Ministers Differ Over Afghanistan, Iran's Threat to Rushdie</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ALY MAHMOUD</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>RIYADH, Saudi Arabia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Foreign ministers of Moslem nations
began a four-day conference Monday with 150 items on the agenda but
attention fixed on ``The Satanic Verses'' and Iran's order that its
author be killed.
   The Saudi foreign minister opposed Iran's insistence that
discussion of the novel and author Salman Rushdie head the agenda.
Referring to Iranian response to the book, he cautioned against
``this rabid invasion aimed at undermining the Islamic faith and
personality.''
   By Monday, no mention of Rushdie had been made in conference
coverage by the government-guided Saudi media.
   Saudi Arabia and other Islamic countries have criticized Rushdie
and banned his novel, which Moslems say blasphemes Islam, but have
not supported Iranian patriarch Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini's
instruction to his followers to kill the writer.
   Last year, the Saudis broke off diplomatic relations with Iran,
accusing Iran's fundamentalist Shiite Moslem regime of fomenting
terrorism among Shiites in the kingdom.
   Prince Saud al-Faisal, the Saudi foreign minister, said Monday
that debate on the Palestinian issue and recognition of the
provisional government organized by Afghan guerrillas should have
precedence on the agenda.
   King Fahd of Saudi Arabia opened the meeting of the 46-member
Organization of Islamic Conference with a three-minute speech
welcoming participants and wishing them success.
   Ali Akbar Velayati, Iran's foreign minister, did not attend.
Mohammad Khodadadi, head of the Foreign Ministry's Islamic
organization affairs department, represented Iran.
   Khodadadi said Rushdie's book ``is the most important issue to be
debated by the conference as far as we are concerned,'' and told The
Associated Press: ``We will press for their support for Iran's views
on that score.''
   Rushdie, 41, has been in hiding since Khomeini pronounced the
death sentence Feb. 14 and Iranian clerics added a reward of $5.2
million. He was born in Bombay to Moslem parents, but now is a
British citizen and has said he does not practice religion actively.
   Among aspects of the book to which Moslems object is a scene in
which prostitutes are given the names of Mohammed's wives and the
suggestion that the prophet wrote the holy Koran rather than
receiving it from Allah.
   Tehran television, monitored in Cyprus on Monday, said 190
members of Iran's parliament had sent a letter to the Organization
of Islamic Conference asking that the meeting take a stand on the
book ``pleasing to Moslems.''
   Shiites dominate Iran but make up only 10 percent of the world's
1 billion Moslems, most of whom are of the Sunni sect.
   Several conference delegates described the Iranian position on
``The Satanic Verses'' as ``exaggerated'' and said it could give
Moslems bloodthirsty image they do not deserve.
   Conference sources, speaking privately, said no delegation other
than Iran's appeared willing to support Khomeini's execution order.
   ``Most foreign ministers are convinced Iran is trying to exploit
the affair to score propaganda gains'' said an Arab diplomat, who
spoke on condition of anonymity.
   Diplomats said moves were under way to persuade Iran to drop its
demand for Rushdie's death and avoid a confrontation at the meeting
with Sunni Moslems led by Saudi Arabia.
   They said some delegations suggested Western nations be asked to
ban ``The Satanic Verses'' and most believed Rushdie should be given
an Islamic trial and a chance to repent.
   On Afghanistan, Prince Saud urged that Moslem nations recognize
the guerrilla government, which he said ``is capable of binding
together the Afghan people in brotherhood and accord.''
   Only Saudi Arabia, Sudan and Bahrain had extended recognition by
the time the conference began.
   The provisional government, based in Pakistan, is dominated by
Sunni Moslems. Insurgents have been trying to oust the communist
government in Kabul, capital of Afghanistan, since the last Red Army
soldiers left the country Feb. 15, ending nine years of Soviet
military involvement.
   Sources at the conference said Iran probably would raise
objections to a government dominated by the guerrilla alliance based
in Pakistan and demand a significant role for the eight
Shiite-dominated Afghan political groups based on its territory.
   Iran has warned of a possible civil war in Afghanistan if demands
for power-sharing by the Shiites are ignored.
   Gulbuddin Hekmatyar, foreign minister of the guerrilla
government, said it was more interested in recognition than in
winning Afghanistan's seat in the Organization of Islamic
Conference. The seat became vacant after the communist coup in 1978
that started the Afghan civil war.

<TEXT>
   The Bush administration welcomed Israeli
Foreign Minister Moshe Arens for talks today with a plea for efforts
to reduce tensions on the predominantly Arab West Bank and in Gaza.
   Secretary of State James A. Baker said he had ``a productive
exchange of views'' with Arens at the State Department before the
Israeli official went to the White House to see President Bush.
   Baker said he had suggested ``various reinforcing and reciprocal
steps'' be taken by Israel and Palestinian Arabs, who make up the
overwhelming majority in the territories captured by Israel in the
1967 Mideast war.
   But Baker did not say whether Arens had agreed to relax Israeli
authority and to take other measures floated before his arrival in
newspaper accounts.
   Arens told reporters that Israel wanted to reduce tensions, but
``it's not easy to do that with violence in the area.''
   For 15 months, Palestinian Arabs have waged a campaign against
Israeli authority. In the violence, 396 Arabs and 17 Israelis have
died.
   ``We both agreed that the need for progress is of the highest
priority,'' Baker said as he saw Arens off to the White House.
   Despite pressures from Arab and Western European governments, the
Bush administration is moving slowly in formulating a plan for
Mideast peace talks.
   ``It's just basically common sense that before you do anything
that you could consider an initiative, you've got to change the
conditions and lower the level of violence and confrontation,'' a
U.S. official, speaking on grounds of anonymity, said Sunday.
   Bush has said he won't be stampeded into offering wide-ranging
new peace initiatives in his talks with Middle East leaders. Arens
will be followed here later this spring by Israeli Prime Minister
Yitzhak Shamir and there also will be visits by Jordan's King
Hussein and Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak.
   Bush has kept open the U.S. dialogue with the Palestine
Liberation Organization, although administration officials have
expressed concern about recent attacks by Palestinian guerrillas
against Israeli soldiers.
   Both U.S. and Israeli officials seem content to use this week's
talks to buy time before moving more heavily into the complex
problems of Mideast peacemaking.
   Arens, who is making his first trip to the United States as
foreign minister, has characterized the meetings as get-to-know-you
sessions rather than a substantive discussion of peacemaking
strategy.
   U.S. officials plan to ask Israel to release some of the
Palestinians arrested during the 15-month uprising, end or limit
detentions and reopen schools in the territories, The New York Times
reported Sunday, quoting an unidentified senior administration
official.
   It said the U.S. initiatives also would call on the PLO to halt
violent demonstrations in the Israeli-occupied territories, block
anti-Israeli raids from southern Lebanon and stop distribution of
inflammatory leaflets.
   The administration official said the aim of the American
suggestions to both Israel and to the PLO are to bring about
``confidence-building measures on both sides because the Israelis
and Palestinians really don't trust each other.''
   The aim would be to have such suggestions ``grabbed by one side,
and then have that attract the other,'' he said. ``It's not really a
plan.''
   But in advance of today's meetings, Palestinian leaders attending
a Mideast peace symposium in New York denounced the administration
ideas for calming tensions in the region.
   They called on the administration to push instead for a permanent
solution to the Arab-Israeli conflict, including creation of an
independent Palestinian state.
   Several left-wing Israeli legislators attending the three-day
symposium at Columbia University also predicted that the U.S.
proposals would fail if they included only interim measures for
quelling the Palestinian uprising in the West Bank and Gaza Strip.
   But Yossi Sarid, a member of the left-wing Citizens Rights
Movement in Israel's Knesset, or parliament, said the Bush proposals
``show at least that the new administration has a sense of urgency''
about restarting the Mideast peace process.
   Faisal Husseini, director of the Arab Studies Center in East
Jerusalem and a top Palestinian leader in the occupied territories,
called the U.S. suggestions ``unbalanced, unfair.''
   He said the new U.S. proposals were flawed because ``they are
asking us to stop the demonstrations,'' while Israel was being asked
``the minimum.''
   Husseini and PLO officials at the symposium said the real issue
is ending Israel's occupation of the territories, captured from
Jordan and Egypt during the 1967 Middle East war, and creating a
Palestinian state.
   ``The intefadeh (the Arabic name for the uprising) is our only
weapon for continuing the peace plan,'' said Nabil Shaath, chairman
of the Political Committee of the Palestine National Council, the
PLO's legislative arm. ``What is not negotiable is the final result:
an independent Palestinian state side-by-side with the state of
Israel.''

   A strong earthquake shook East and
West Germany today, and East German media reported damage and
injuries in villages along the border.
   The earthquake, which occurred at 2:02 p.m. and lasted 12
seconds, caused minor damage in West Germany and was felt in parts
of Switzerland and Czechoslovakia, officials said.
   West German authorities said the quake registered 5.7 on the
Richter scale. East Germany's ADN news agency gave the magnitude of
5.5 and said the quake was triggered by a huge explosion in an
underground mine. This could not immediately be confirmed.
   Chimneys fell in the East German border village of Vacha, and
several people were injured there, the state-run agency said. It did
not give casualty figures.
   It said buildings in four other villages in the area also
suffered damage. The quake also caused power outages, and streets in
the four villages were blocked by rubble, ADN said.
   ``In the village of Voelkershausen, 80 percent of the buildings
were damaged, some of them so badly that residents had to be
preventively evacuated,'' the East German news agency said.
   The agency said the quake was triggered by a blast in a potash
mine in Merkers, six miles from the border. ADN, based in East
Berlin, said all the miners were safe.
   Hesse state radio in West Germany quoted an unidentified
geophysicist in Frankfurt as saying it was ``unusual for mine
blasting to trigger such a large quake.''
   West German authorities said the quake was centered near Kassel
on the western side of the border. Kassel is 72 miles northeast of
Frankfurt and 18 miles from the East German border.
   Police in Kassel said there had been no immediate reports of
injuries or damage in the area. There were no reports of damage or
injuries in Frankfurt.
   The Frankfurt Seismological Institute and the Swiss Earthquake
Service said the quake registered 5.7.
   The Richter scale is a gauge of the energy released by an
earthquake, as measured by the ground motion recorded on a
seismograph. Every increase of one number means that the ground
motion is 10 times greater.
   A quake of magnitude 5 can cause considerable damage in populated
areas. A quake of magnitude 6 can cause severe damage in populated
areas.

   An Air Force helicopter crashed and burned
in the desert on a night training mission, killing all 15 people
aboard, authorities said today.
   Workers at the crash site 25 miles from Davis-Monthan Air Force
Base recovered the last bodies late this morning after using a crane
to move the burned-out wreckage, said base spokesman Capt. Carlos
Roque.
   The Vietnam-era CH-3E ``Jolly Green Giant'' helicopter, with four
Air Force crew members from the base, went down on a clear, moonless
night Sunday while ferrying 11 Army personnel stationed at Fort
Bragg, N.C., authorities said.
   Another helicopter was in the area, Roque said.
   A witness said he saw what appeared to be flames from the
helicopter before it crashed. Another said the copters were flying
so low that ``you could throw a rock and hit them.''
   Roque said that the cause of the crash was under investigation
but that the crew's night-vision goggles were not a factor. News
reports have implicated the light-amplifying goggles and lack of
moonlight in previous crashes.
   Roque said in previous crashes involving the goggles, the
aircraft were on low-level flights or close to other aircraft.
   ``In this case, they were flying above the minimum FAA (Federal
Aviation Administration) altitude,'' Roque said, though he could not
specify the FAA minimum ceiling for the site or the helicopter's
level prior to the crash.
   He said the two helicopters Sunday night were not close together,
but he had no specific distance.
   Roque said the helicopter was transporting Army personnel from
Fort Huachuca to the Air Force's Gila Bend Gunnery Range, 200 miles
apart.
   Mike Skrekas said he saw the crash from his house a few miles
away.
   ``I looked up and I seen a yellow ball, like flames, coming out
of the back,'' he said. ``Five seconds later I saw it hit the
ground, and then there was a red fireball.''
   Another nearby resident, 31-year-old Gary Williams, said he did
not see the crash but heard two helicopters flying ``real low'' just
before one hit the desert floor.
   ``They were flying so low you could throw a rock and hit them,''
he said.
   Since 1978, 37 of 41 Army helicopter crashes in which night
goggles were used occurred when there was not enough moonlight for
the light-amplifying devices to operate properly, the Orange County
(Calif.) Register reported Sunday.
   Those crashes killed 65 soldiers when mechanically sound
helicopters flew into mountains, oceans, lakes, trees and power
lines, the newspaper reported.
   The Army's policy of flying under overcast and moonless nights
with night-vision goggles never has been cited as a contributing
factor in a crash, military records show.
   The CH-3E, which was most noted for its use in combat rescues
during the Vietnam War, is made by Sikorsky, according to Jane's All
the World's Aircraft.
   ``In wartime their mission would be to rescue downed pilots from
behind enemy lines, consequently they do a lot of night training for
combat rescue,'' Besich said.

   The first woman to serve as NASA
commentator for the liftoff of a spaceship carrying astronauts said
Monday she was pleased with her performance _ even though she jumped
the gun in one of her reports.
   ``I said the ice team had already made their report to
management,'' Lisa Malone, 27, said in an interview. ``And I thought
that they had. This was one of those times when there was a lot
going on. It was just a few minutes later, then they came on and
gave their report.''
   Malone, who sat in the top row of the firing room a few seats
down from the launch director for Discovery's liftoff, said ``It was
just a matter of time'' before NASA used a woman as launch
commentator.
   After the launch, she was back in her office at the Kennedy Space
Center's press headquarters where she works as space shuttle
specialist. But instead of analyzing weather and engineering
reports, she was kept busy by reporters asking her to analyze her
performance.
   ``I think I did alright,'' she said, adding that it went more
smoothly than she expected ``because the launch team did such a good
job they made my job easier.''
   She said she was surprised journalists were asking her about her
pioneering role as launch commentator.
   ``I guess (it's) because they've always heard a male voice during
commentary,'' she said.
   ``There are so many woman newscasters,'' she said. ``I don't
really consider this job that much different from what they're
doing.''
   As commentator, Malone explained to the public what took place
behind the scenes as the countdown clock ticked to zero and the
shuttle rumbled skyward from its launch pad. Her job lasted longer
than she had bargained for, as bad weather delayed the liftoff by
nearly two hours.
   Malone, who was a bachelor's degree in journalism from the
University of Alabama in Tuscaloosa, took part in a work-study
program for three semesters at Kennedy Space Center beginning in
1982. She accepted an offer of a full-time job as public relations
specialist with the National Aeronautics and Space Administration
during her last semester as an intern.
   Malone edited the space center newsletter, Spaceport News, for
three years before she was assigned to the shuttle beat.
   To prepare for Monday's debut, Malone provided launch commentary
for some unmanned Atlas Centaur and Delta launches and for the early
portions of some shuttle countdowns and hired a voice coach.

<HEAD>Residents Fight to Keep Swallows Away From Their Homes</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SAN JUAN CAPISTRANO, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   While thousands of enthusiasts
prepare for the swallows' annual return Sunday, some residents do
all they can to keep the birds away from their homes.
   ``They're a pain,'' said Mike White, who uses his garden hose to
keep the birds away from his house. ``They arrive at the crack of
dawn and they're very noisy. I haven't seen one yet. But all of a
sudden, you'll look up and the skies are filled.
   ``It's like `The Birds' Hitchcock movie. I just hope they don't
try to hit our house this year.''
   Homeowners' battle plans include knocking down empty mud nests,
washing walls and displaying inflatable owls. But residents don't
always succeed in keeping the swallows from nesting under the eaves
of their homes.
   ``I know the swallows are part of the heritage here, but I'm
taking their nests down,'' said Peggy Pizzolo, 35. ``We knock them
down, and they keep coming back to build.''
   Mission San Juan Capistrano, the old Spanish mission that
tradition says is where the birds return to each spring, can't
accommodate all of them and it is tough for homeowners to control
other places the birds choose to build their nests, said Doug
Willick, Orange County coordinator of ``American Birds,'' a
publication of the Audubon Society.
   Swallows pick nest sites that offer shade, food, safety from
predators and nearby mud and water, said bird watcher Ricard Kust of
Irvine. And the birds and their offspring will return to the same
nest sites year after year.
   Under the federal Migratory Bird Treaty Act, the swallows are
protected by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. Anyone who tears
down swallows nests after the birds arrive is subject to a fine of
$500 per nest and a six-month jail term, said Nancy Kaufman, field
supervisor for the agency.
   And since San Juan Capistrano declared itself a sanctuary under a
1974 ordinance, no one in town can harm swallows, owls, hawks and a
host of other wild birds.
   Both laws allow homeowners to remove nests after the swallows
leave for the winter, but once the birds return to hatch their eggs
the nests can't be tampered with, officials said. Although residents
commonly wash down walls, they are not supposed to disturb swallows
building nests.
   ``The city responds immediately to complaints about homeowners
who tear or wash down nests illegally, but people are probably
getting away with violations,'' conceded city building official Mark
Gibson.
   Gibson, whose office gets three or four complaints a year, said
they rely on people who call in tips on lawbreakers.
   Some residents are protective of the swallows and said they don't
mind sharing their living space with them.
   ``I welcome swallows to build a nest on my house any time, any
place,'' said Sam Allevato, who has lived in San Juan Capistrano for
13 years. ``What's the harm of a little bird being there for a few
months?''

<TEXT>
   A Democrat who was trounced by U.S. Rep.
Dick Cheney in last November's election said Monday he should
receive his party's nomination for Cheney's seat if the Republican
becomes defense secretary.
   Bryan Sharratt said he deserves the nomination because of the
time and money he devoted to trying to unseat Cheney in 1988 and
that any other Democrats who seek it would be ``opportunistic.''
   The Wheatland attorney, who lost the general election race by a
vote of 118,350 to 56,527, said he believed there was one major
reason why he didn't defeat Cheney.
   ``And that is that I was running against one of the most powerful
Republican 10-year incumbents in the nation,'' he said.
   Cheney, who last fall won a sixth two-year term as Wyoming's lone
member of the House of Representatives, was President Bush's second
nominee for defense secretary. While Bush's first nominee, former
Sen. John Tower, was rejected by the Senate following lengthy debate
over allegations of heavy drinking and womanizing, Cheney is
expected to easily win confirmation.
   When that happens, it would be up to Wyoming Gov. Mike Sullivan
to set a special election within 40 days for the selection of a
successor to Cheney. The state's Republican and Democratic central
committees would each choose a candidate.
   Other Democrats believed interested in the seat are state Sen.
John Vinich, who narrowly lost his bid to unseat incumbent U.S. Sen.
Malcolm Wallop last fall, and Pete Maxfield, a former University of
Wyoming professor who lost the Democratic Senate nomination to
Vinich.

   Thierry Roussel says he's not ashamed to admit he
was still in love with a former lover during his few years of
marriage to Christina Onassis.
   ``Christina was the fire; Gaby was the calm. I loved them both
passionately,'' Roussel said in an interview in this week's People
magazine.
   Roussel fathered two children with former Swedish model Gaby
Landhage while he was married to Onassis and fathering their only
child, Athina. He and Onassis divorced in 1986 after Landhage became
pregnant a second time.
   Despite his tangled relations with the two women, Roussel said
Onassis ``became Gaby's friend'' and that the two women ``wanted the
children to grow up together.''
   Roussel said he would raise Athina ``with all the love a father
can have for his daughter.''
   The 4-year-old stands to inherit most of her mother's estimated
$500 million fortune. She is living with Roussel, Landhage and their
two children in Switzerland.

   Attempts to settle the 15-year-old Louisiana
college desegregation lawsuit broke down Monday, and a federal
official called for immediate public hearings.
   ``There's not an agreement,'' said John Kennedy, attorney for the
state. ``I think we're all disappointed by that. The only thing
worse than not having a consensus is having a bad consensus.''
   Kennedy would not say what sticking points prevented a settlement
during the intense negotiations under way since Wednesday.
   ``I don't think there has been a complete consensus on any
issue,'' he said.
   The court-appointed special master who must oversee any
desegregation plan, Paul Verkuil, called for the opening of the
hearing after meeting with lawyers in private for more than an hour.
   State Sen. William Jefferson, representing Southern University,
one of the predominantly black institutions in the state system,
blamed the stalemate at least in part on Gov. Buddy Roemer.
   He accused the governor of having ``submarined'' the process, but
he would not be specific.
   The attorneys said they had no idea how long the hearing would
last or when a decision would be issued.
   Verkuil has decided to limit the hearing to rebuttal testimony,
to let the different sides dispute the abundant testimony already in
the printed record. The hearing was scheduled to begin last week,
but Verkuil postponed it until Monday in hopes a trial could be
avoided.
   In the lawsuit, the U.S. Justice Department accuses the state of
maintaining a long-standing system of predominantly black colleges
like Grambling and Southern and predominantly white universities
like Louiana State Univesity.
   The state, Southern University, the Justice Department and the
Grambling State University Alumni Association have four different
integration plans before Verkuil.
   The governor insists on consolidating the four boards that
oversee higher education in the state into one ``superboard'' and
creating a statewide community college system. The alumni of the
traditionally black schools feel that such plans will make it harder
for underprivileged youngsters to get the kinds of assistance they
need to succeed at four-year colleges.
   The alumni want to move programs to the historically black
colleges to promote integration, but state and federal officials say
that approach has not worked in other states.
   Verkuil is president of the college of William &amp; Mary in Virginia
and a former dean of Tulane Law School. He was appointed by federal
court to oversee the case.

   Actress Esther Williams, who made plenty of big
splashes in 26 movies, is hoping for one more _ with a swimsuit line
designed to make her a friend in the fitting room for women of all
shapes and sizes.
   Williams, whose MGM movies like the ``Million Dollar Mermaid,''
``Dangerous When Wet'' and ``Bathing Beauty'' were known for lavish
swimming and underwater ballet sequences, says she packed decades of
swimming experience into 124 suit designs.
   In a telephone interview from her Beverly Hills, Calif., home,
Miss Williams said her $30- to $60-suits are sturdier and more
practical than other models. The line of suits made its debut Monday
in Houston and would be shown later in New York and Florida, said
Miss Williams.
   Using fabrics that were not available in the 1940s and 1950s,
when her films made her a top box office attraction, Miss Williams,
65, said she created bathing suits that are ``practical and
glamorous'' like the ones she swam in.
   ``We did a lot of surveys,'' she said. ``We discovered a lot of
women have gotten so unhappy with these high cut bathing suits that
are practically stripper clothes that they would like a couple of
models with a skirt back again.''
   The new suits will not ride up the back of a woman's body or fall
down on top in water, said Miss Williams. Even the bikinis in her
collection will not slip on the body, she promises.
   ``I've tested them myself,'' Miss Williams said. But she admitted
that when she goes out to her backyard pool for a daily workout, she
swims in the nude.

<TEXT>
   Leaders of the governing
National Party today adopted a resolution calling for the party's
new leader, Frederik W. de Klerk, to replace P.W. Botha as president.
   Botha, 73, who suffered a stroke in January, said he plans to
return to work Wednesday and wants to stay in office at least until
next year, despite widespread calls for his resignation.
   He said in a televised interview Sunday that he would not call an
early election this year, dampening hopes within his party that he
would step down within a few months and make way for de Klerk.
   De Klerk, who succeeded Botha as party leader on Feb. 2, had
called for the National Party's 34-member federal council _ its
highest body _ to meet in Cape Town to discuss the crisis.
   De Klerk has not disavowed reports that he is seeking either
Botha's early resignation or a formal share of policy-making powers.
   The independent South African Press Association reported today
that National Party officials were angered by Botha's refusal to
call an election this year. The latest date for the next election is
March 1990.
   ``The situation is intolerable and will have to be settled this
week,'' one unidentified party official was quoted as saying.
   The state-run South African Broadcasting Corp., which has
endeavored to be neutral in its reports on the power struggle, also
said this week would be ``of decisive importance in the present
turbulence in the party.''
   Beeld, the country's biggest Afrikaans-language daily, said in an
editorial today that the time has come for a new political order to
take hold.
   Botha, said in the television interview Sunday that de Klerk was
``being misused by some people'' and insisted there was no personal
conflict between them.
   The Star newspaper of Johannesburg, South Africa's
largest-circulation daily, said some of de Klerk's backers were
``dismayed by Botha's impressive performance'' during the interview.
   The president looked healthy during his 15-minute appearance and
said he would remain in office out of a sense of duty rather than a
desire to cling to the position he has held since 1978.
   Botha indicated he was upset by suggestions that a de Klerk
presidency would open the way for new political reforms, saying, ``I
originated the concept of reform.''
   De Klerk, 52, was education minister when he took over as leader
of the National Party. He holds solid support from National Party
parliament members. He also has won at least tacit backing from
pro-Nationalist newspapers, which view him as more pragmatic and
open-minded than Botha.
   During Botha's convalescence, de Klerk has suggested in speeches
that the government is willing to lessen its reliance on racial
classification as the foundation for political and social structures.
   However, he has told white voters he will not betray them and has
affirmed his commitment to segregated residential areas for whites
who want them. Like Botha, de Klerk has given no indication he is
willing to consider full voting rights for the country's black
majority.

<HEAD>Furry Engineers Make Too Spectacular a Comeback to Massachusetts</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CAROLYN LUMSDEN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>SPRINGFIELD, Mass. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Beavers, which sustained the Pilgrims
but nearly disappeared from Massachusetts during the height of the
fur trade, have made such a comeback in the last half century that
they are a nuisance.
   And a state relocation program has been called off because there
simply is no corner of the state where the toothy, dam-building
rodents are not entrenched.
   ``We've run out of places where there aren't already beavers,''
biologist James Cardoza said Monday in a telephone interview from
the Massachusetts Division of Fisheries and Wildlife headquarters in
Westboro.
   He said it is impossible to estimate the number of beavers in
Massachusetts because of their reclusive aquatic lifestyle, but last
year the division tried to resolve 185 complaints about the furry
engineers.
   Massachusetts is not alone.
   Robert J. Naiman, a beaver expert and director of the Center for
Streamside Studies at the University of Washington, said California
and Nevada introduced beaver several years ago and now are having
second thoughts because of the havoc the critters are playing with
trout streams.
   Wisconsin is about to launch a six-month beaver hunting season on
March 15, the largest in state history, to try to control the beaver
population. State Wildlife and Fisheries Management spokesman Ryan
Groener said beavers damming trout streams and cutting valuable
timber have driven state wildlife officials to authorize the hunt
and to pay $7.50 per pelt.
   Naiman said Tierra Del Fuego in the southern tip of Argentina
also introduced beavers in 1942 and is now blaming the animal for a
decline in the trout industry.
   Witney Tilt, project director for the Fish and Wildlife
Foundation of Washington, D.C., a non-profit agency, said the beaver
population in the United States could have been as high as 400
million before Europeans arrived. The current population is
estimated to be as many as 12 million.
   The industrious animals helped the state's first settlers
survive, Cardoza said. ``The beavers were the reason they were able
to sustain the Colony because their sponsors wanted to bargain with
the Indians for furs.''
   By the Revolutionary War, however, beavers had disappeared from
Massachusetts and most of New England because of year-round trapping
and the draining of wetlands for farming.
   After an absence of two centuries, two beaver colonies took hold
in Berkshire County in the 1920s. One had drifted downstream from
northern New England and the other may have been brought to
Massachusetts by a resident who wanted to re-establish the
population, Cardoza said.
   The animals flourished, so much so that in the 1950s a beaver
hunting season was opened. Another state biologist, Tom Decker, said
the four-month season that ended in February yielded fewer pelts
that usual because the market price was down.
   Among some of the biggest beaver headaches in Massachusetts was a
colony in the town of Montgomery that drew spectators for years,
until the beavers set their sights in 1986 on a brook flowing under
Main Street.
   The animals built dams faster than work crews could demolish
them, causing the brook to threaten to overflow the main
thoroughfare of the town of 500 people and inspiring one resident to
hang a sign bearing a score: ``Beavers 33, Waterworks 10, Highway
Department 0.''
   In 1985 an epidemic of the intestinal disease giardiasis that
affected more than 1,000 people in Pittsfield was blamed on beaver
droppings contaminating the city water supply. The beavers were
killed by trappers.
   Some scientists now suspect, however, that the beavers were not
to blame and Cardoza says the rodents are often scapegoats. ``The
potential from human contamination has been vastly overlooked,'' he
said.
   Wildlife biologists are advising residents about humane ways to
sidestep beaver problems without destroying the animals. Residents
may kill beavers without a permit only if property damage is serious.

   Legislation to provide financial incentives to
young people who participate in civilian or military service would
enhance military recruitment, not undermine it as some critics have
charged, the chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee said
Monday.
   Sen. Sam Nunn, D-Ga., said the national service legislation he
and Rep. Dave McCurdy, D-Okla., introduced in January is not
intended to make civilian service more attactive than military
service.
   He said proposed incentives might have to be adjusted to ensure
that military service remains the most attractive option, but the
net effect of the bill would be an overall increase in young people
willing to serve their country.
   ``If you create a huge increase in the pool of people who want to
serve, either in civilian or military service, it is my firm belief
that you're going to have more people going into the military, not
less,'' he said.
   During a news conference called to announce the U.S. Jaycees'
endorsement of the national service proposal, Nunn and McCurdy
responded to criticism of their bill.
   Robbie Dawkins, national vice president of the group which has
240,000 members aged 21 to 39, said such voluntary national service
would ``promote a new spirit of citizenship and commitment.''
   Under the legislation, young people who serve two years in the
military would get $24,000 for college or vocational school or for
buying a house. Two years of civilian service would net $20,000 in
education or housing aid. It would make national service a
requirement for young people to qualify for federal college loans
and grants.
   Rep. Sonny Montgomery, D-Miss., a senior member of the House
Armed Services Committee and chairman of the House Veterans Affairs
Committee, said last week he opposes the idea because it would draw
high-quality people away from the military by paying them for
community service.
   Similar complaints were voiced to a House Armed Services
subcommittee last week by Grant S. Green, the Pentagon's manpower
chief. He said the bill's ``lucrative alternatives for civilian
service or shorter enlistments'' would ``reduce recruit quality,
increase training costs and adversely affect the productivity of
military personnel.''
   Montgomery said armed services would be forced to accept two-year
volunteers whether they need them or not. He also said the bill's
incentives would undermine the GI Bill, which provides $10,800 in
education aid after three years of military service.
   McCurdy, however, said the plan would enhance the GI Bill by
providing vocational school or housing benefits to young people who
serve but don't want to go to college. The existing GI bill, he
said, offers nothing to such people.
   ``The bottom line is we want to keep having the military be the
most attractive option,'' Nunn said.

<HEAD>Plan 100-Member U.N. Peacekeeping Force For Region</HEAD>

   Central American officials this week will
discuss plans for a U.N. peacekeeping force to patrol the
Nicaraguan-Honduran border and other regional hot spots, diplomats
said Monday.
   The U.N. plan envisions the peacekeepers using speedboats,
all-terrain vehicles and helicopters to monitor allegations of
subversion in the region.
   Foreign ministry officials and military officers from Nicaragua,
El Salvador, Honduras, Costa Rica and Guatemala will meet Tuesday
and Wednesday at U.N. headquarters to discuss the details, according
to U.N. diplomats who spoke on condition of anonymity.
   Foreign Ministry officials from the five Central American nations
agreed in principle in February that a U.N. military observer group
should check claims that any of the nations is violating another.
   The peacekeepers will focus on the Nicaragua-Honduras border to
check allegations of raids by the Contras or Sandinistas, and on the
El Salvador-Honduras border, said the diplomats.
   El Salvador says rebels trying to overthrow the government
operate from clandestine bases in Honduras without the knowledge of
Honduran officials.
   About 11,000 Nicaraguan rebels are based in Honduras.
   The peacekeepers will also monitor the Costa Rica-Nicaragua
border and will use speedboats to patrol the Gulf of Fonseca, which
links Nicaragua, Honduras and El Salvador on their Pacific coasts,
according to a copy of the U.N. draft plan obtained by The
Associated Press.
   Each roving team will consist of four military observers in two
vehicles, with at least one group in each of the five nations.
   The U.N. plan says they will need all-terrain vehicles,
helicopters and a light airplane, as well as at least one speedboat.
   About 60 pilots, drivers and civilian support staff will be
deployed along with up to 100 military observers, the report
recommends.
   Canada, Spain and West Germany have already volunteered to
provide personnel for the force.
   Unresolved are the issues of whether the military observers would
have any weapons other than their standard light side arms for
defensive use, and exactly where they will be posted, said the
diplomats.
   The draft report calls for the Central American governments to
consider providing armed escorts for the peacekeepers when necessary.
   It also asks the governments to try to reach agreements with the
local rebel forces that the insurgents will not fire on the U.N.
peacekeepers.
   The military observers would not attempt to clean out or relocate
Contra bases in Honduras unless the Contras invited them to assist
in their repatriation, the diplomats said.

<HEAD>East Germany's Economy Slowing Down; Joint Ventures Difficult</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GIRARD C. STEICHEN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>LEIPZIG, East Germany (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Twice a year, Communist East Germany
welcomes thousands of capitalists from around the world to the
sprawling Leipzig Trade Fair.
   But visiting trade officials say that despite an increasing
interest in trade with the West, East Germany still is far from
embracing the reforms needed to encourage joint ventures with
Western countries.
   ``They are afraid that once the West _ and especially West
Germany _ gets a foot in the door, that they'll buy the whole place
up,'' said a high-ranking member of the U.S. trade delegation at the
fair, which opened Sunday and ends March 18.
   West Germany accounts for 64 percent of East Germany's trade with
the West. It also is a key source of hard currency for East Germany,
which needs convertible currency to buy Western-made goods and
equipment to modernize its industries.
   But according to the West German Economics Ministry, trade
between the two countries fell last year and appears headed for a
long period of stagnation.
   The slowdown is in part the result of fewer East German goods
being made available for sale to the West.
   ``The Soviet Union is now demanding better products from East
Germany at a time when increased exports to the West are needed to
earn vital hard currency,'' another U.S. trade official said. ``All
this has to be done while still trying to provide quality goods to
its national consumers.''
   East German economists admit privately the economy is facing
growing pressures.
   ``The days of the guaranteed `brotherhood' trade agreements (with
other Communist countries) are passing,'' said an East German
government official, referring to special trade agreements among
Warsaw Pact nations.
   The official said competition for hard currency sales has grown
fiercer between East European nations. Many are scrambling to
implement reforms and increase Western trade ties to shore up their
economies.
   The government official, who spoke on condition of anonymity,
confirmed that the Soviet Union _ East Germany's biggest trading
partner _ is pressing for delivery of more top-rate goods. That
reduces East Germany's potential hard currency trading stocks with
the West.
   Another senior government official admitted that East Germany's
industrial base is rapidly becoming obsolete.
   ``Our industrial infrastructure, once state of the art in the
early 1970s, has now outlived its usefulness,'' the official said.
   Modernization has lagged in part because 80 percent of the
nation's high-grade machinery goods are exported rather than used at
home, said John F. Nosworthy, director general of the London-based
Machine Tool Trades Association.
   Nosworthy said East German insistence on reciprocal trade
arrangements also hinders broader development of import-export
agreements.
   East German restrictions on foreign travel also hinder business
ties with the West.
   Those restrictions are aimed in part at preventing politically
embarrassing and economically damaging defections, like the case
last month of Reinhard Fichte. The head of East Germany's renowned
Meissen porcelain factory defected to West Germany while on a trade
fair visit to Frankfurt.
   It will be difficult for East German authorities to make joint
venture proposals that are attractive to Western partners as long as
East German managers and engineers are restricted in the type and
frequency of visits they can make to the partner's facilities, one
American executive said.
   ``In order to make a joint venture work, you need a smart,
powerful and flexible partner,'' the executive said. ``You don't get
that here.''

<TEXT>
   A second battle of Bunker Hill is brewing between
residents of a public housing project and city officials who say up
to 100 families may have to leave while their apartments are being
renovated.
   The 45 red-brick buildings of the Bunker Hill housing project are
clustered just three blocks downhill from the famous monument to
Colonial resistance. Opened in 1940, they are scheduled for a $30
million renovation.
   But rebellious tenants, who have lived through a bitter busing
battle and the peaceful integration of what had been an all-white
enclave, say they won't budge.
   ``You'll need a bulldozer to get me out,'' one tenant said at a
community meeting Sunday.
   ``We're not moving,'' Mary E. MacInnes, president of the Tenants'
Task Force, declared Monday. ``We're not leaving Charlestown.''
   MacInnes said the complex is a tight-knit community with up to
three generations of families. She moved into the Bunker Hill
complex with her parents in 1940. She raised eight children there,
teaching two of them at home rather than see them bused, and now has
a 26-year-old son living there.
   MacInnes said tenants want to stay in their apartments during the
renovations where possible, and a guarantee that they will be moved
to another apartment in the complex if not. Elderly tenants and
those with special needs should not be forced to move, she said.
   ``We have a lot of family members who have family members in the
same building who were put there so they could take care of each
other,'' MacInnes said. ``How are you going to relocate these
people?''
   William H. Wright, spokesman for the Boston Housing Authority,
insisted that the agency has no choice.
   ``This is not the kind of work that can be done with people
living in the apartment,'' Wright said.
   Wiring and plumbing dating to World War II will be ripped out,
walls will be demolished and some roofs will have to be replaced, he
said.
   Tenants will be given another apartment, either in Charlestown or
elsewhere in the city, or a subsidized rent voucher and a written
guarantee that they can move back to the project _ though not
necessarily to the same apartment, Wright said.
   Attempts will be made to renovate buildings in stages so tenants
can move to vacant apartments within the complex while others are
being renovated, Wright said. The BHA expects that far fewer than
100 families will have to leave.
   City Councilor Robert E. Travaglini on Monday blamed the inflamed
emotions on a lack of communication. He said he and Mayor Raymond
Flynn would meet with tenants Tuesday to discuss the project.
Flynn's office could not confirm the meeting.
   MacInnes said the tenants' resistance to leaving the Charlestown
projects was not racially motivated. The projects, which began
integrating in 1984, are now about 10 to 15 percent minority, she
said.
   Minority families have been as outspoken as whites in opposing
the move, she said.
   ``One woman who has been here less than a year said, `I love it
here,' so we're all sticking together on this,'' MacInnes said.
   Louis Elisa, president of the Boston chapter of the National
Association for Advancement of Colored People, which has sued the
housing authority for racial discrimination, noted that Bunker Hill
is less integrated than other projects in which relocating families
would be offered apartments.
   Elisa said the NAACP would review the relocation plan.

<HEAD>Radio Liberty Broadcast to Soviet Union Jammed, Activist Reports</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   For the first time in more than three months, the
Soviets jammed U.S.-financed Radio Liberty on Monday as it broadcast
news of a demonstration in Moscow and criticism of a member of the
Politburo, an activist said.
   ``It was completely jammed for 45 minutes,'' said Yuri Mityunov,
a member of the Democratic Union, an independent political party,
and a journalist whose commentaries are carried on Radio Liberty's
Russian-language broadcasts, which are beamed at the Soviet Union.
   Mityunov said in a telephone interview that the jamming stopped
momentarily Monday, but resumed later Monday night.
   On Nov. 29, 1988, the Soviets stopped jamming Radio Liberty and
several other foreign radio stations, including West Germany's
Deutsche Welle and the Voice of Israel.
   That step was heralded as another move in President Mikhail S.
Gorbachev's campaign for ``glasnost,'' or greater openness.
   Mityunov said Radio Liberty was jammed Monday night as it
broadcast a report about a demonstration Sunday in Moscow in honor
of the 1917 February Revolution, which toppled Russia's czardom. The
Bolsheviks seized power later that year, sweeping away the
Provisional Government established in February.
   Mityunov said an editorial he wrote also was jammed. He said his
editorial accused Moscow party boss Lev N. Zaikov, a member of the
Politburo, of trying to prevent the nomination of his predecessor,
maverick communist Boris N. Yeltsin, as a candidate in the March 26
elections to a new national assembly.
   Mityunov held the recever of his telephone up to his radio so the
whine of the jamming was audible.
   ``They used to call this `Khrushchev music,' or `Brezhnev
music,''' he said, referring to former leaders Nikita S. Khrushchev
and Leonid I. Brezhnev. ``Now we'll have to call it Gorbachev
music.''

<HEAD>Senate Putting Cheney Nomination on Fast Track</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Senate Armed Services Committee announced
Monday that confirmation hearings will begin Tuesday on Rep. Dick
Cheney's nomination as defense secretary, and one Democratic panel
member expressed hope that the process could be wrapped up by week's
end.
   Meanwhile, Bush administration officials played down published
reports about Cheney's two draft deferments during the early stages
of the Vietnam War, and the fact that the defense-secretary
designate never served in the armed services.
   Cheney, R-Wyo., requested and obtained two student deferments
while studying at the University of Wyoming, where he received a
bachelors degree in 1965 and his masters in 1966. Cheney also was
married and had a small child in 1966, making him eligible for a
Class 3 hardship deferment.
   Bush announced Friday that Cheney would be his nominee for the
Pentagon post, one day after the Senate rejected John Tower, a
former Texas senator, by a 53-47 vote.
   The vote capped a bitter, partisan debate in the Senate where
lawmakers expressed concerns over allegations of excessive drinking
and womanizing against Tower and his work as a paid defense
consultant after government service.
   The Armed Services Committee and Democratic leaders greeted
Cheney's nomination with words of praise and promised to move
quickly on the confirmation process.
   At the hearings, scheduled to begin Tuesday afternoon, House
Republican Leader Robert Michel and Sens. Alan Simpson and Malcolm
Wallop, R-Wyo., will formally introduce Cheney to the committee,
said Pete Williams, a Cheney spokesman.
   Sen. Tim Wirth, D-Colo., a member of the committee, said he hoped
that consideration of the nominee could be wrapped up by week's end,
when the Senate begins a two-week recess.
   ``The more rapidly we get through this the better. I would hope
we could be done by the end of this week,'' Wirth said.
   Cheney spent Monday morning in briefings at the White House and
was expected to go to the Pentagon later in the day, Williams said.
   Meanwhile, House Republicans scrambled to fill the gap in their
leadership that will be left with Cheney's departure. As minority
whip, Cheney was the party's chief House vote-counter and
heir-apparent to Minority Leader Robert Michel.
   Rep. Newt Gingrich, R-Ga., the leader of a band of conservatives,
was the only announced candidate to succeed Cheney, R-Wyo. But
Republican Conference Chairman Jerry Lewis, R-Calif., the No.
3-ranking official, was mulling over the race. Also said to be
considering running were Rep. Edward Madigan, R-Ill., the chief
deputy whip, and Rep. Lynn Martin, R-Ill., who narrowly lost to
Lewis in the conference chairman's race in January.
   At the daily White House news briefing, deputy press secretary
Roman Popadiuk was asked what kind of message Cheney's lack of
military services sends to the members of the armed services.
Reports about the subject appeared in Monday's Washington Times and
over the weekend in the Los Angeles Times.
   The nominee is ``fully aware of the defense issues that are
relative for this country and he has a deep commitment to the
defense of this country,'' Popadiuk said.
   During last year's congressional campaign, Cheney's opponent,
Bryan Sharratt, did not make the Republican's lack of military
service a major issue.
   Cheney would not be the first defense secretary without any
military experience to head the Pentagon. Four defense secretaries _
Charles Wilson, Neil H. McElroy, James Schlesinger and Harold Brown
_ did not serve in the armed services.

   Mayor Eugene Sawyer declared Monday that he would
not endorse a candidate in next month's mayoral election, despite
pleas from Jesse Jackson and others to support the only black
candidate in the race.
   Sawyer, the city's second black mayor, spurned calls from Jackson
and several local committeemen to help mend a deep rift in the black
community by backing Alderman Timothy Evans.
   Evans, who did not support Sawyer in last month's Democratic
primary, is running as a third party candidate in the April 4
election against Democrat Richard M. Daley and Republican Edward
Vrdolyak.
   ``After careful consideration, I have decided not to endorse any
candidate,'' Sawyer told reporters in a short statement.
   Evans spokeswoman Deborah Scott later downplayed the lack of
Sawyer's help in the campaign, denying that Evans would lose votes
because of Sawyer's neutrality.
   ``I don't think it's going to impact on turnout either,'' Scott
said. ``People who were saying there was no candidate to inspire
them (in the primary) now have a candidate to inspire them (in
Evans),'' she said.
   Daley, flanked by a multiracial group of Sawyer supporters who
are now in his camp, said later that he could benefit from Sawyer's
non-endorsement.
   ``I think him not endorsing anyone is very helpful to ... my
campaign, sure,'' Daley said at a news conference.
   Sawyer, 54, was soundly defeated in the Feb. 28 Democratic
mayoral primary by Daley, 46, the Cook County state's attorney and
son of the late Richard J. Daley, who was mayor for 21 years.
   Evans, 45, bypassed the primary to run as an independent in the
general election against white candidates Daley and Vrdolyak, 51.
   Some knowedgeable observers believe that Evans' lack of support
for Sawyer, who also is black, contributed to a low primary turnout
in some predominantly black wards and was a factor in Daley's
primary victory.
   Jackson has often referred to the Evans-Sawyer split among blacks
and other allies of the late Mayor Harold Washington _ the city's
first black mayor _ as a ``civil war.''
   But Sawyer answered ``no'' when asked Monday if he was bitter
about Evans' failure to endorse him in the primary.
   ``All candidates have sought my endorsement,'' Sawyer said,
adding that he would do ``everything I can to ensure a smooth
transition (for whoever is elected mayor).''

<HEAD>Rock-Throwing Incidents Reported in Lhasa; Martial Law to Continue</HEAD>

   A government official Monday reported
rock-throwing incidents in Tibet's capital, despite a crackdown by
Chinese authorities, and he said martial law will continue until
anti-Chinese protests end.
   A Chinese businessman in the capital, Lhasa, told state TV he was
afraid to open his shop because he feared more riots.
   The nationally televised news showed police surrounding major
intersections in Lhasa. One frame showed an old woman being
searched. Another showed several soldiers checking the identity
cards of bicyclists. The report said the city was calm.
   The scene was photographed Saturday, but the official at the
provincial office of Tibet in Beijing said troops continued to
patrol the city.
   ``Right now there is no possibility of the order being lifted,''
said the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity. ``Martial
law in Lhasa will end only when the authorities are assured that the
situation will stay calm.''
   Martial law took effect March 8, after three days of riots in the
capital of the remote region.
   ``Things have gotten better with martial law,'' said one Chinese
businessman in Lhasa, interviewed on television. ``But these rioting
Tibetans were very scary. I don't dare open the store.''
   All residents of Lhasa are required to have an identity card and
show it upon request. Last week, the television news said more than
1,000 people had applied for cards in one day.
   The official said Tibetans defying the crackdown had been dealt
with ``harshly and in accordance with law.''
   He did not say when the rock-throwing incidents occurred, but
sketchy reports reaching Beijing said some Tibetans attempted a
protest Thursday.
   By official count, 16 people died and about 100 were injured in
three days of riots that began March 5 when Tibetans tried to
commemorate the first anniversary of another clash.
   On March 5, 1988, anti-Chinese protesters clashed with police in
Lhasa, and an estimated 24 people died.
   Although last week's protests were initially led by Buddhist
monks and nuns, later riots, during which Chinese-owned businesses
were ransacked and Chinese bicyclists attacked, were headed by
Tibetan youths.
   The government apparently ordered the crackdown to avoid more
protests to commemorate a March 10, 1959 uprising against Chinese
rule in which hundreds died and Tibet's god-king, the Dalai Lama,
fled to India.
   More anniversaries are coming. March 17 is the day the Dalai Lama
left Lhasa for India in 1959. On March 19 and 20, 1959, the Chinese
army used heavy artillery to suppress the uprising.
   Beijing claims that Tibet has been part of China since the 13th
century. Tibetans say their homeland was really independent for most
of that time.

   The trial of a retired librarian accused of
killing six people and wounding 10 others in a shooting rampage
began Monday with the prosecution saying the defendant methodically
shot his victims.
   But the defense maintains William Cruse is a paranoid
schizophrenic and is innocent by reason of insanity.
   Cruse, looking frail with unruly gray hair, is charged with
killing six people, including two police officers, wounding 10,
shooting at 18 others and kidnapping two at two Palm Bay shopping
centers during a seven-hour crime spree April 23, 1987.
   In opening arguments Monday before Circuit Judge John Antoon,
both sides agreed Cruse suffered delusions and believed his
neighbors thought he was a homosexual.
   A prosecutor said his festering anger triggered the shooting
spree at the Publix and Winn-Dixies grocery stores at the two
shopping centers in the community located in central Florida.
   But the defense said it was the obsession of a paranoid
schizophrenic who twisted words and gestures into a sinister plot
against him, believed the whole world was interested in his sex life
and thought doctors programmed him during surgery to stare at men's
crotches.
   Chronic and severe mental illness, pre-existing brain damage and
alcohol, ``combined into a very deadly mixture'' and he lost touch
with reality, said defense attorney Paul Arlt, setting the stage for
the insanity defense.
   The state said Cruse bought a high-velocity, semiautomatic rifle
a month before the shooting, then bought six 30-round clips and
sufficient ammunition a week before the massacre.
   ``He had control of his weapon at all times,'' said Assistant
State Attorney Wayne Holmes. ``When he needed to bring it to eye
level and (take a) marksman stance, he did so.''
   ``His mental disease in no way justifies killing six, wounding
10, shooting at numerous others and kidnapping two,'' Holmes said.
   But Arlt said Cruse's ``psychiatric illness overwhelmed him, he
was totally out of touch with reality.''
   The trial is expected to last four weeks.

<HEAD>Quake Blamed on Mine Blast Hits East, West Germany, Injures Three</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BERLIN (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An earthquake blamed on blasting in an East German
potash mine shook both German states on Monday, injured three East
German villagers and was felt as far away as Switzerland and
Czechoslovakia.
   Officials said the quake occurred at 2:02 p.m. (8:02 a.m. EST)
and lasted 12 seconds. The state-run East German news agency ADN
reported damage in five villages along the border with West Germany.
Minor damage also was reported in West Germany.
   ``In the village of Voelkershausen (East Germany), 80 percent of
the buildings were damaged, some of them so badly that residents had
to be preventively evacuated,'' ADN said.
   ADN said the quake measured 5.5 on the Richter scale and was
triggered by a massive cave-in that in turn was caused by miners
blasting in a shaft at Merkers, six miles from the border with West
Germany.
   The East Berlin-based agency said no miners were hurt, but
chimneys fell in five small villages, injuring three people. It
reported property damage and power outages in the area and said some
streets were blocked by rubble.
   Hesse state radio in West Germany quoted an unidentified
geophysicist in Frankfurt as saying it was ``unusual for mine
blasting to trigger such a large quake.''
   The temblor appeared to be the largest on record for that part of
Germany. The largest previous one on file in the U.S. Geological
Survey, National Earthquake Information Center, occurred on Feb. 22,
1953 and measured 5.4.
   Bruce Presgrave of the U.S. Geological Survey in Boulder, Colo.,
said his office received reports that the quake may have originated
in a rockburst, which occurs when rocks under pressure suddenly fail.
   This often happens in mining areas. The process of mining removes
material which may be pressing against one side of rocks which
remain under pressure from all other directions.
   In Monday's case, ADN said a man-made bl Geological Survey both reported
readings of 5.5.
   The East German news agency said the quake was centered on its
territory near the mine. West German authorities had placed the
epicenter between Kassel and Bad Hersfeld in West Germany. Kassel is
72 miles northeast of Frankfurt and 18 miles from the East German
border.
   ADN said a chimney fell on a car in Vacha, injuring the driver,
and the top of a smokestack collapsed on a building in Dorndorf,
seriously injuring a man. It did not give details on the third
injury.
   It said civil defense units, firemen, police and volunteers
helped in cleanup efforts.
   The Richter scale is a gauge of the energy released by an
earthquake, as measured by the ground motion recorder on a
seismograph. A quake of magnitude 5 can cause considerable damage.
The magnitude 6.8 earthquake that hit Soviet Armenia last Dec. 7,
killing an estimated 25,000 people, released about 90 times more
energy than Monday's tremor in Germany.

<HEAD>Disc Jockey Offends Brownies On The Air</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SAN JOSE, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Kelly Poritz and Theresa Stolter hoped to
sell Girl Scout cookies with an on-air radio taste test, but the
9-year-old Brownies instead were berated and sworn at by the DJ
known as the ``shock jock.''
   KSJO-FM disc jockey Perry Stone also suggested that the two keep
some of the cookie proceeds.
   ``So get as much cash as you can, OK? You pocket a little bit,
you put a $10 bill in your pocket, and you don't tell anyone.
They'll never know. It's the all-American way,'' Stone said.
   The youngsters were stunned into silence before Kelly replied,
``Brownies have to be honest.''
   During the 20-minute interview Friday, Stone also asked the girls
to help advertise a car dealership and joked that their parents were
in trouble with the law. By that time, Kelly had enough and yelled,
``Be quiet!''
   Stone had the Brownies as guests at the request of Girl Scout
spokeswoman Ursula Rado.
   ``It just didn't click in that this was the Perry Stone. I take
the blame,'' Rado said. ``All of Girl Scouting is outraged and
shocked. I'm all for free speech, but there has to be some
reasonableness.''
   Stone, one of the most popular DJs in the area, has been picketed
and criticized by listeners who complain he is tasteless, bigoted
and offensive. In January, some of his critics launched a campaign
to force him off the air and filed a complaint with the Federal
Communications Commission.
   KSJO manager David Baronfeld said he had been out of town all
weekend and had only read about the incident in the papers. He said
until he has a chance to talk to everyone involved, it was ``too
premature to pass judgment.''
   The conversation got off to a rocky start when Stone asked the
two to help advertise a car dealership.
   ``Where would you go, young little thing, to get the best deals
on cars?'' he asked.
   ``Who knows?'' replied Kelly.
   He also suggested Theresa and Kelly make up a sob story to
persuade people to buy cookies and said the two needed money to bail
their parents out of jail. Stone told them police had found ``some
stuff in the trunk that looked like sugar.''
   Kelly's mother, Cynthia Poritz, said she was appalled. ``Is this
guy that desperate for the material that he has to attack Girl
Scouts?'' she asked.

   All of Texas was under a grassfire alert Monday as
miles of land burned in sparsely populated areas from Big Bend
National Park to the Louisiana border, adding to 44,000 acres
blackened since Saturday.
   No people had been killed, but a half-dozen homes and a fire
truck were destroyed and a dozen head of cattle were killed.
   The state forestry service issued the alert until rain _ which
the National Weather Service isn't expecting for days _ raises
moisture levels.
   ``It is obvious that the danger is high when we are having fires
from the Louisiana border to the Big Bend country, and north into
the Panhandle area,'' said Bruce Miles, director of the Texas Forest
Service.
   ``March, with its traditional high winds and low humidities and
cured fuels, is always our potentially most hazardous fire period of
the year,'' he said.
   As of Monday, the major fires had burned:
   _1,000 acres on the Camp Swift military reservation, 40 miles
east of Austin, used by military reserve units. Foam-pumpers and
U.S. Forest Service bulldozers had the fire under control around
noon Monday.
   _600 acres in the Hill Country, and destroyed one home and the
possessions of a family of four and damaged four other homes
Saturday.
   _38,000 acres in Dickens County in the lower Panhandle before
being put out Monday around daybreak.
   _615 acres, reduced from Sunday's estimate of 1,200 acres, in the
High Chisos Mountains in the worst fire in Big Bend National Park's
history. Crews were beginning to bring it under control Monday.
   In addition, 151 fires burned more than 3,500 acres in the pine
woods of southeastern Texas, the latest day for which that figure
was available, the forestry service said.
   In the Dickens County fire, about 60 miles east of Lubbock, six
families were evacuated and a fire truck from the Spur Fire
Department was destroyed. One home burned and about a dozen head of
cattle were killed, said Sandra Taylor, a Dickens County sheriff's
office dispatcher.
   Officials said the cause of the blaze was not known.
   A 150-acre fire about nine miles southeast of Kerrville
apparently began when residents were doing open burning and ``with
the gust of wind and dryness of the grass, it just got away from
them,'' said Arthur Verona, assistant emergency management
coordinator for Kerrville and Kerr County.
   The flames gutted one mobile home, two storage sheds and a barn,
and damaged five other mobile homes, Verona said.

   Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini expressed his
thanks Monday to Moslems who supported his order that Salman Rushdie
be killed for writing ``The Satanic Verses.''
   Iranian television quoted a statement from the 88-year-old
patriarch's office as saying it ``was inundated by waves of
telegrams and letters, and pledges of support and readiness to carry
out the Imam's order, most of them from Islamic scholars and leaders
who organized glorious rallies and protests, all of which were
reported to the Imam.''
   ``The Imam expressed his thanks to all the people for their pure
feelings, which tell of hearts full of faith,'' the statement said.
   Khomeini's thanks coincided with the opening of a four-day
conference in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, of member nations of the
Organization of Islamic Conference. Iran wants the meeting to take
action about Rushdie and ``The Islamic Verses,'' which Moslems
believe blasphemes Islam.
   According to the television, 190 members of Iran's parliament
sent a letter to the Riyadh conference demanding discussion of the
book and Western support for Rushdie.
   Arab diplomatic sources said Khomeini's death threat had not
found support at the conference.
   He issued the order Feb. 14, directing his followers to hunt down
and kill Rushdie, and Iranian clerics offered a reward of $5.2
million.
   Rushdie went into hiding. He was born in Bombay, India, to Moslem
parents but now is a British citizen and has said he does not
practice religion.
   Moslems say his novel blashphemes Islam in a scene in which
prostitutes are given the names of Mohammed's wives and in its
suggestion that the prophet wrote the holy Koran rather than
receiving it from Allah.
   Iran broke diplomatic relations with Britain last week because
Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher's government would not suppress the
book.
   Tehran's official Islamic Republic News Agency said Monday people
in the African nations of Niger and Zimbabwe support Khomeini's
action. It said Premier Mamane Oumarou of Niger endorsed the
execution order and a Moslem youth group in Zimbabwe had vowed to
bring Rushdie ``to divine justice.''
   The news agency said two Tehran newspapers called for an economic
boycott of Britain and a third recommended breaking relations with
West Germany.
   According to the latest available figures, Iran imported goods
worth $528 million from Britain in 1987 and sold it exports valued
at $321.
   Israel's largest book fair opened Monday in Jerusalem, with
100,000 books from 42 countries on display, and ``The Satanic
Verses'' was the main attraction.
   State radio said branches of the British Council in Israel
removed the Rushdie book from their lending library shelves, but it
quoted council officials as saying it remained available on request.
   Prime Minister Brian Mulroney of Canada, whose government briefly
halted imports of the novel, was in London on Monday and said: ``I
expressed to Mrs. Thatcher the view of my government that ... it is
unacceptable for anyone to place a price on the head of a private
citizen for any reason at all, least of all for the expression of a
literary view.''
   President Richard von Weizsaecker of West Germany said Monday
that religious tolerance should be the starting point of a Middle
East peace settlement.
   At a dinner for visiting President Hosni Mubarak of Egypt, he
acknowledged that Rushdie's book had offended Moslems, but said hurt
feelings were not grounds for violation of national sovereignty and
legal rights.
   West Germany is Iran's biggest trading partner. Iran imported
$1.3 billion worth of goods from it in 1987 and sold West Germany
exports worth $560 million.
   Bonn has joined the 12-nation European Community in recalling its
envoy from Iran to protest the death sentence, canceled plans for a
Cabinet minister to visit Tehran and suspended more than $1 billion
in credits for Iran.
   Two prominent members of the Swedish Academy, which awards the
Nobel prizes, announced in Stockholm they would boycott the academy
to protest its failure to speak out as a body on Rushdie's behalf.
   Author Kerstin Ekman, one of two women in the 18-member academy,
told Swedish television she was dropping ``all work in the academy,
which means in effect I am leaving it.''
   Lars Gyllensten, a former permanent secretary of the academy,
said he would boycott its regular Thursday meetings but remain on
the administrative committee and Nobel institution.
   Rules of the 200-year-old organization say members are elected
for life and vacate their seats only at death or if they commit a
serious crime.

<HEAD>Customs Announces Big Seizures of Drug Paraphernalia</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Dozens of pipes, scales and other items were
arrayed Monday at U.S. Customs Service headquarters as Commissioner
William von Raab announced seizures of up to $10 million in drug
paraphernalia over the past few weeks.
   One of the pipes _ a shiny brass item marked $16.95 _ contained a
warning, ``This product not intended for illegal use,'' as well as
more prosaic instructions on how to maintain the ``gloss finish.''
   But the warning didn't dissuade the Customs Service from seizing
the items in Northern Virginia last month or from seizing a
40,000-square-foot warehouse full of similar items March 1 in
Nashville.
   The Tennessee seizure of some 306,000 items at the Contempo
Products Inc. warehouse, was the ``largest ever,'' von Raab said.
The second largest occurred March 4 at the Award Distributing Co. in
Philadelphia, he said.
   ``We're going to take away from the drug abuser the tools of his
trade,'' von Raab said. Those who manufacture and distribute such
products ``are putting yourself at risk to lose millions of dollars
of your inventory,'' he said.
   The Nashville seizure filled eight 48-foot containers, while the
Philadelphia seizure filled four, he said.
   Even so, von Raab acknowledged that the amount confiscated would
``probably not have a measurable impact'' on the drug paraphernalia
industry. He estimated that hundreds of millions of dollars worth of
drug paraphernalia is sold annually.
   There have been no arrests in any of the recent cases, but von
Raab said U.S. attorneys around the country ``are identifying people
who might be indicted.''
   The seizures are part of the Paraphernalia Interdiction Program
for Enforcement, known as PIPE, which von Raab created last April 15
as an outgrowth of the Mail Order Drug Paraphernalia Act of 1986.
   The PIPE effort has led to 13 major drug paraphernalia cases
conducted by the Customs Service, and about $15 million worth of
such items has been seized thus far, the service said. In addition
to Nashville, Philadelphia, and Northern Virginia, seizures have
been made by Customs officials in Washington, New York City,
Detroit, Houme, La., and Tallahassee, Fla.

<HEAD>Actor's Recovery `Excellent'; `Heat' Calls In Joe Don Baker</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>

   Carroll O'Connor, star of NBC-TV's ``In the Heat
of the Night,'' was moved out of intensive care Monday as he
recovers from cardiac bypass surgery at Emory University Hospital.
   Meanwhile, in Los Angeles, publicists for the show announced
Monday that actor Joe Don Baker has been signed as a guest star for
the four episodes remaining in the 1988-89 season.
   The scripts will have Baker portraying a neighboring sheriff who
fills in while Police Chief Bill Gillespie _ O'Connor's character _
represents his state at a seminar on terrorism.
   ``Everyone at MGM@UA (producers of the show) is thrilled and
grateful that Carroll has come through the procedure with flying
colors,'' said David Gerber, chairman of MGM@UA Television.
   ``Joe Don responded to my call for help immediately,'' Gerber
added. ``He expressed tremendous concern for Carroll as well as his
enthusiasm for the show. ... We are relieved that Carroll will be
able to rejoin the company for next season.''
   Emory University Hospital spokeswoman Eve Patterson said Monday
that O'Connor continues to recover well from his six-graft cardiac
bypass surgery Saturday. He is expected to remain hospitalized
another week or so.
   ``He's making excellent progress,'' she said. ``His doctors say
his heart muscle was undamaged, and that's adding to his recovery.''
   The need for bypass surgery was determined after O'Connor had a
positive heart stress test while undergoing an examination in nearby
Covington, where he has been filming ``In the Heat of the Night.''
   O'Connor is perhaps best known for his role as Archie Bunker on
the trailblazing situation comedy ``All in the Family.''

<HEAD>U.S. Urges Israel to Ease Grip on Palestinian Arabs</HEAD>

   The Bush administration asked Israel on Monday
to ease its grip on the occupied West Bank and Gaza while U.S.
policy-makers ponder ways to promote Mideast peace talks.
   Secretary of State James A. Baker III broached the proposal in a
45-minute meeting with Israeli Foreign Minister Moshe Arens and also
told him the situation in the occupied territories was
``untenable,'' a senior U.S. official said afterward.
   While the atmosphere was relaxed, Baker told Arens without
getting into specifics that a calmer environment was essential ``to
create conditions that will allow for direct talks,'' said the
official, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
   ``We certainly want to reduce tension,'' Arens told reporters
after meeting with Baker. But, Arens added: ``It's not easy to do
that considering the violence in the area at the present time.''
   However, the visiting Israeli official also commented: ``I think
we will find common ground on how to do this.''
   Arens then met with President Bush at the White House for a
half-hour and also with Vice President Dan Quayle.
   ``We didn't arrive at any finalized or defined positions,'' Arens
said afterward. ``I think it is probably premature to expect that at
this point.''
   While the day's meetings evidently went smoothly, Arens raised
questions about the talks the United States is having with the
Palestine Liberation Organization.
   The foreign minister told Israeli reporters he had informed Bush
the dialogue would not contribute to the peace process because the
PLO remains engaged in three levels of terrorism _ against Israelis
in southern Lebanon, by calling for violence in the territories and
against Palestinians who disagree with Yasser Arafat's organization.
   Meanwhile, Marlin Fitzwater, the president's spokesman, said in a
statement that the administration was seeking ``new ideas'' to
advance the peace process.
   ``President Bush emphasized that the United States does not want
to miss an opportunity for peace in the Middle East and still
believes in direct talks as the best path to peace,'' Fitzwater said.
   Baker described the actions he urged on Arens as ``various
reinforcing and reciprocal steps which might be taken to defuse the
tension there.'' He was not specific. But even before Arens arrived,
published reports said they included release of Palestinian
prisoners and a general easing of Israeli control.
   Next week, Robert Pelletreau Jr., the U.S. ambassador to Tunisia,
is expected to ask the Palestine Liberation Organization to block
guerrillas from trying to infiltrate Israel.
   The parallel appeals to Israel and the PLO seem designed to bring
the two sides together eventually. The Israeli government refuses to
deal with an organization it accuses of continuing terrorism, while
a PLO aide said Sunday in New York the U.S. approach was unbalanced
and outdated.
   Nabil Shaath, who was granted a visa by the administration to
attend a conference at Columbia University, said ``we are the only
occupied people in the world who are being asked to refrain from any
expression against the occupation. That's ridiculous.''
   Baker said he had ``a productive exchange of views'' with Arens
at the State Department. Returning the kind words, Arens said their
talk ``contributed to building a basis of understanding between us.''
   At the same time, Baker stressed any settlement of the
Arab-Israeli conflict must ``address the legitimate political rights
of the Palestinian people.''
   The PLO, which asserts the right to speak for all Palestinian
Arabs, is demanding a state carved out of territory now controlled
by Israel.
   For 15 months, Palestinian Arabs have waged a campaign against
Israeli authority on the West Bank and in Gaza. The lands were
captured by Israel in its lightning victory over Jordan and Egypt in
the 1967 Six-Day war.
   Baker reaffirmed the U.S. commitment to Israel's security and
said ``we can and must find a way to move ahead'' toward an overall
settlement.
   Despite pressures from Arab and West European governments, the
Bush administration is moving slowly in formulating a plan for
Mideast peace talks.
   ``It's just basically common sense that before you do anything
that you could consider an initiative, you've got to change the
conditions and lower the level of violence and confrontation,'' a
U.S. official, speaking on grounds of anonymity, said Sunday.
   Bush has said he would not be rushed by a Soviet diplomatic
initiative in the Middle East into offering wide-ranging new peace
initiatives in his talks with Middle East leaders. Arens will be
followed here by Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir, King Hussein
of Jordan and President Hosni Mubarak of Egypt.
   Bush has kept open the U.S. dialogue with the PLO that began last
December despite a series of attacks by PLO guerrillas on Israeli
security positions across the border in southern Lebanon.
   U.S. and Israeli officials seem content to use Arens' visit to
buy time before moving more heavily into the complex problems of
Mideast peacemaking.
   Arens, who is making his first trip to the United States as
foreign minister, said there was ``a solid foundation of
friendship'' between his country and the United States.
   Both Arens and Baker described the two countries as allies.

<HEAD>Tass says Afghan rebels driven back from Jalalabad</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Afghan government troops repulsed rebels and their
Pakistani allies trying to capture the city of Jalalabad, and 276 of
the attackers were killed, the Soviet news agency Tass reported
Monday.
   It quoted Afghanistan's official Bakhtar news agency as saying
Afghan army units were in control and ``reinforcing their
positions.''
   The Tass review of combat at the eastern Afghan city over the
past 24 hours said 215 rebels and Pakistanis were wounded, including
several commanders. It did not give casualty figures for the
government forces for that period.
   It claimed that Pakistani troops operating with the rebels were
burning the bodies of insurgents killed in the battle and said that
enraged other rebels.
   Tass also said: ``Eyewitnesses and prisoners of war reported
Monday that officers and military instructors from Pakistan, as well
as the commanders of some opposition groups, have issued secret
orders to finish off wounded who cannot be evacuated.
   ``The order caused anger among the rebels, who showed
disobedience, and even armed resistance in some cases,'' it said. It
did not elaborate.
   In Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, a rebel official said the insurgents
expect to gain control of the country within weeks and then will
seek war reparations from the Soviet Union.
   Gulbuddin Hekmatyar, foreign minister in a provisional government
established by Afghan Sunni Moslems, spoke at a news conference
Monday on the opening day of a meeting of foreign ministers of the
Organization of Islamic Conference.
   He said, ``The puppet government (of Marxist President Najib in
the Afghan capital of Kabul) will fall within weeks. We are
prefectly capable of overrunning Kabul and Jalalabad and other
regions, but we prefer to delay military action in inhabited
regions. We do not want to spill blood any more.''
   Hekmatyar claimed the rebels were ``pounding the gates of
Jalalabad, have shot down two enemy warplanes and will enter the
city shortly, Allah willing.''
   He said a qualified organization would be selected to estimate
the amount of Afghanistan's losses as a result of the Soviet
militery intervention and how much ``Moscow should pay us in
reparations.'' He did not give any figures.
   The Soviet Union sent troops into Afghanistan in December 1978
and had as many as 115,000 military peronnel in the country before
it began a withdrawal early last year. The Kremlin said the pullout
was completed last month.
   Tass, in its account of the battle for Jalalabad, 40 miles west
of the Pakistani border and about 70 miles east of Kabul, said the
rebels bombarded the city's residential areas Sunday with 12,000
rockets and shells.
   It said five people were killed and 15 wounded in barrages Sunday
that caused widespread destruction.
   Soviet television said Sunday the Afghan army reported it
repelled an attack on Jalalabad by 14,000 rebels backed by 3,000
Pakistani advisers.
   It said the rebels are determined to capture Jalalabad and make
it the base for a transitional government.
   Pakistan-based rebels, most of whom are Sunni Moslems, declared
the formation of a provisional government last month.
   Hekmatyar said eight Iran-based rebel groups of Shiite Moslems
are ready to join the provisional government.
   ``They have not rejected us, they have not opposed us,'' he said.
``It is only a question of power sharing, and they will send a
delegation from Iran to negotiate with us in Pakistan on that
score.''
   An estimated 1 billion people in the world are Moslems, and about
10 per cent are Shiites. Sunnis form the majority.
   Hekmatyar appealed to countries to recognize the provisional
government.
   ``An early recognition of our interim government would shorten
the duration of conflict and spare a lot of bloodshed in
Afghanistan,'' he said.
   Only Saudi Arabia, Sudan and Bahrain had granted recognition to
the rebel government by the time the Riyadh conference began.

   Authorities detained at least 240 demonstrators in
two cities who likened communism to czarist tyranny, and officials
jammed U.S.-financed Radio Liberty on Monday as it reported on the
protests, activists said.
   The actions marked the widest reported crackdown on demonstrators
in Moscow and Leningrad in months and the first jamming of Radio
Liberty since the Soviets halted the practice last fall under
President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's program for greater openness.
   Valery Terekhev, 40, said he was one of more than 200 people
detained Sunday in Leningrad in connection with an unauthorized
three-hour demonstration calling for multiple-party democracy in the
Soviet Union.
   ``I think there have never been so many people detained in
Leningrad,'' Terekhev said in a telephone interview.
   All of those detained were released pending trials set for
Wednesday through Friday, said Terekhev, a member of the Democratic
Union, an independent party that challenges the Communist Party's
monopoly on political power.
   He said 15 buses brought about 2,000 police backed up with dogs
to round up protesters in Leningrad who were demonstrating on the
72nd anniversary of the 1917 overthrow of the Russian monarchy.
   Terekhev said the date of the demonstration was chosen to show
that the current ``totalitarian'' one-party system in the Soviet
Union should be replaced with a democratic, multiparty system and a
free press _ just as the 1917 revolution ended czarist
totalitarianism.
   The 1917 revolution took place in February under the old-style
religious calendar then in use.
   In Moscow, about 40 people were detained Sunday during a similar
protest on Mayakovsky Square, said Yuri Mityunov, a Moscow-based
member of the Democratic Union.
   One of the slogans of the multi-city demonstrations was:
``Against the absolutism of the Communist Party,'' which echoed a
slogan of the forces that toppled the Russian monarchy in 1917:
``Against the absolutism of the czar,'' Mityunov said.
   One of those taken away by Moscow police, Sergei Grigoryants,
editor of the now defunct magazine Glasnost, was given a 10-day jail
term, said Viktor Rezunkov, another editor of the magazine. The
magazine was raided by police last year.
   Radio Liberty's reports on the demonstrations and similar
protests in the Siberian city of Irkutsk and the Volga industrial
city of Kuibyshev were blocked when Soviet authorities suddenly
began jamming them, said Mityunov, a journalist whose commentaries
are aired on the radio's Russian-language broadcasts beamed at the
Soviet Union.
   ``It was completely jammed for 45 minutes,'' Mityunov said. He
said in a telephone interview that the jamming stopped momentarily,
but resumed later Monday night.
   Mityunov said the mass detention of protesters reminded him of
abuses committed under the Russian monarchy. ``It's a rebirth of the
same absolutism,'' he said.
   On Nov. 29, the Soviets stopped interfering with the broadcasts
of Radio Liberty, based in West Germany, and several other foreign
radio stations, including Deutsche Welle, also in West Germany, and
the Voice of Israel, Israel's state-run station.
   Mityunov said Radio Liberty was also jammed Monday as it aired an
editorial he had written. He said his editorial accused Moscow party
boss Lev N. Zaikov, a member of the party's ruling Politburo, of
trying to prevent the nomination of his predecessor, maverick

<HEAD>Suits Filed Against Apartment Operators In Fla., Minn.</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The first housing discrimination lawsuits
seeking monetary damages authorized by Congress under new provisions
of the Fair Housing Act were filed Monday by the Justice Department.
   The separate lawsuits were filed against apartment operators in
Florida and Minnesota for compensatory monetary damages under
provisions enacted last year by Congress in the Fair Housing
Amendments Act, which took effect Sunday.
   ``Most discriminatory housing practices have been illegal for
over 20 years; the new act makes them expensive as well,'' Attorney
General Dick Thornburgh said in a statement after the lawsuits were
filed.
   ``Our new authority to seek damages allows us to provide a
complete remedy for victims of housing discrimination, and the civil
penalty provision can constitute a signficant deterrent to such
discrimination,'' Thornburgh said.
   Before the amendments took effect, plaintiffs in housing
discrimination suits filed by private attorneys could only obtain up
to $1,000 in civil penalties.
   And under the old law, the Justice Department lacked authority to
seek any monetary award for a complainant.
   The compensatory damages enacted by Congress are intended to
repay plaintiffs not only for the loss of time and money but for
humiliation and emotional suffering.
   In addition, property owners can be fined $50,000 for the first
finding of discrimination and up to $100,000 for a second violation.
   The suit filed in federal court in Miami charged that Jay Howard
Magid, and two companies he owns, Rent America, Inc. and Skyline
Rental Systems, Inc., discriminate against blacks seeking apartments
in complexes operated in Fort Lauderdale.
   Hal Eubanks, a property manager, was also named as a defendant.
   A similar complaint was filed in Minneapolis against John and
Arnold Klinker, who operate two buildings containing 40 apartments.

<HEAD>Weather Stations To Remain For Time Being</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Commerce Secretary Robert Mosbacher on Monday
directed that all the government's weather stations remain in
service while a program to restructure the National Weather Service
is developed, ending speculation of imminent station closings.
   ``It is not in the best interests of the nation to close any
weather station until the modernization plan is operational,''
Mosbacher said.
   While the department said there would be no immediate closings,
it said plans to modernize the Weather Service make some eventual
closings inevitable.
   Speculation that the department planned to close down or curtail
service at some weather stations because of budget constraints had
prompted criticism from members of Congress concerned about cutbacks
in their home states.
   Mosbacher said the administration's proposed budget for fiscal
1990, which starts Oct. 1, includes a request to finance a
modernization and restructuring program for the Weather Service that
would improve forecasting and weather warning systems.
   The new system would include advanced weather radar, observation
automation and a new communications system.
   ``Closing any of the stations at this point might reduce service
to the public, when we are, in fact, working to improve that
service,'' Mosbacher said. ``I intend to work closely with the
Congress to insure maintenance of the quality and coverage of the
National Weather Service.''

<HEAD>Skinner Announces Plan to Encourage Local Mass Transit Funding</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Transportation Secretary Samuel Skinner told
state and local mass transit officials Monday to stop looking for
more federal funding, and he announced a program to reward
communities that raise more than required to match federal funds.
   Skinner, who was chairman of the Chicago area mass transit system
before joining President Bush's Cabinet, said mass transit needs
federal help but not as much as it has been getting. He also said
more transit systems should contract with private business for some
services.
   Skinner told the American Public Transit Association he would
lead a ``push for greater state and local involvement in mass
transit funding.''
   ``If we become too dependent in mass transit upon Washington, we
will be subject to their whims; we will not control our own
destiny,'' he said.
   Skinner said that communities that ``overmatch'' federal funds in
mass transit programs will get a higher priority and faster funding
from his department.
   He also said he would travel to communities which are having
difficulty raising funds and appear before legislatures or city and
county officials to appeal for an increased local role.
   Money would be available to fund experimental projects that
support local fund-raising, he said.
   Skinner also said he would support programs to provide more
transportation for jobless city dwellers who want to get work in
suburban areas where jobs are more plentiful.
   ``This administration is going to do everything we can to see
that people can get those jobs,'' he said.

<HEAD>Power Failure Cuts Electricity For Millions</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MONTREAL (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Millions of Quebec residents were left without
power in their homes and businesses Monday and Montreal's subway
shut down when a power failure knocked out electricity to most of
the province.
   The blackout occurred at about 2:45 a.m. near the James Bay
hydroelectric project in northern Quebec and affected about 6
million residents of Montreal, Quebec City and most of the rest of
the province.
   ``We don't know the exact cause, but usually with this type of
failure the problem is on a line or in a substation,'' said Jacques
Henri Couture, a spokesman for the provincial electric company,
Hydro Quebec.
   About two-thirds of Quebec had power restored by noon, and crews
were ordered to work through the night if necessary to restore full
power in all areas of the province.
   Traffic lights were knocked out, and there wasn't enough power to
start up the extensive Montreal subway system, which carries about
600,000 commuters a day. Service stations couldn't pump gasoline
because the pumps work on electricity.
   Residents of Quebec, including Energy Minister John Ciaccia,
expressed anger at the power company.
   ``This is very upsetting, not only for the people but for the
government,'' Ciaccia said of the blackout, the third province-wide
failure since April.
   Ciaccia said he demanded a meeting with top Hydro officials for
an explanation. He said the power failures would affect the
utility's credibility in the United States, where it has negotiated
huge sales contracts.
   Some people blamed the big sales of electricity to the United
States for contributing to the blackout by straining the system.
   ``They're selling electricity left, right and center to the
Americans and it's the people in Quebec who are paying for it,''
said Fernand Mathurin, assistant manager at a convenience store in
the Gaspe region of eastern Quebec.
   The outage caused an instant 1,200-megawatt shortage in New
England, which imports Hydro Quebec electricity directly from Quebec
and through New Brunswick, but regional utilities brought operating
reserves on line within 10 minutes, New England Power Pool spokesman
William Sheperdson said.
   After tapping additional generating capacity, the power pool was
shipping 300 megawatts of power back to Quebec through power lines
in northern New Hampshire and Vermont, Sheperdson said.
   Sheperdson and Vincent Iacopino, chairman of New Hampshire's
Public Utilities Commission, said there was no indication that Hydro
Quebec's power sales to New England were to blame for the outage.
   The provincial utility now sells only excess power to New
England, though it plans larger, guaranteed power sales along
dedicated lines to New England in the 1990s as it develops more
hydroelectric resources in the vast James Bay complex of northern
Quebec.
   But Iacopino said the blackout ``confirms that there has to be
some strengthening of the Canadian system for us to rely on that
power.''
   At the Fairmount Bagel Factory in Montreal, the wood-burning
ovens were working, but the bagels weren't coming off the line
because the the dough-making machines were out.
   The Rachel Farm poultry factory was also having problems.
   ``My workers have been here since 3:30 a.m., but we can't do
anything because the plucking machines aren't working,'' said a man
at the poultry farm who identified himself only as Joseph.

<HEAD>McFarlane Says He Withheld Information on North's Work</HEAD>

up in 2nd graf pvs, Previous witnesses, and editing to shorten</HEAD>

   Former National Security Adviser Robert C.
McFarlane testified Monday he thought he was following
then-President Reagan's policy when he withheld from Congress
information about Oliver North's activities for the Nicaraguan
Contras.
   ``The policy of the president to me was to keep this movement
together, and outside contributions from third countries were not to
be shared,'' said McFarlane, testifying as a prosecution witness in
North's trial. He was referring specifically to money solicited from
Saudi Arabia for the rebels.
   In addition, prosecutors read into the court record a separate
McFarlane statement in which he said he had acted ``under the
guidance and emphatic policy instructions of the president.''
   The statement was made 10 days ago to the judge who sentenced
McFarlane to pay a $20,000 fine and contribute 200 hours of
community service for his own part in the Iran-Contra affair.
McFarlane pleaded guilty to four misdemeanors, but North, his former
aide, faces 12 felony counts.
   McFarlane will return Tuesday for a third day of testimony.
   Prosecutor John Keker asked him Monday if he interpreted Reagan's
``instructions to permit lies to Congress.''
   ``No,'' he said.
   Again and again, throughout the day, he said that if there is
blame for North's actions, it should be his because he was North's
superior at the National Security Council.
   McFarlane added that after leaving government ``I probably got a
rise out of him'' when he offered North a job.
   For the first time in weeks of trial, North smiled broadly.
   McFarlane said that on two occasions he talked with Reagan about
the millions of dollars contributed for the Contras by Saudi Arabia.
   The first time, in June 1984 just after Congress shut off U.S.
aid to the guerrillas, McFarlane said, he sent a note with the
president's daily intelligence briefing book informing the president
that the Saudis had agreed to contribute $1 million a month for the
Contra cause.
   ``Good, let's just make sure it stays that way,'' McFarlane said
Reagan told him in a return note.
   In February 1985, McFarlane said, he learned from the Saudi
ambassador that the Middle Eastern country was going to double its
giving and he again told the president. The Saudis eventually gave a
total of $32 million.
   ``If the president of the United States says something like
`let's keep quiet,' is that a direction to lie to other official
bodies?'' Keker asked.
   ``No,'' said McFarlane.
   He pleaded guilty to misdemeanor charges involving withholding
information from Congress. Criminal charges at the core of the North
trial make similar allegations.
   ``Did you ever instruct North to prepare false answers to
Congress?'' he was asked. ``No,'' he said.
   McFarlane left government in December 1985, after accompanying
Reagan in November to Geneva for the summit meeting with Soviet
leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev.
   It was in Switzerland, he said, that he got a call from the
Israeli defense minister who was in New York, asking his help
clearing a shipment of U.S.-made Hawk missiles destined for Iran. He
said he told Reagan, chief of staff Donald Regan and Secretary of
State George Shultz.
   The following May, by then a private citizen, McFarlane said he
went to Tehran at Reagan's request to try to open discussions. The
trip was a failure.
   On the way back during a stop in Israel, ``Colonel North told me
I shouldn't be disappointed because some of the proceeds of the sale
(of weapons) to Iran was going to be available for the Nicaraguan
Contras,'' McFarlane said.
   ``Were you surprised to hear that?'' Keker asked.
   ``Yes.''
   ``Did you ask anything about it?''
   ``No, I should have.''
   Earlier, he testified that North prepared a letter McFarlane sent
to Congress in 1985 denying that anyone on the National Security
Council staff solicited funds for the Nicaraguan Contras.
   Previous witnesses at North's trial _ both private fund-raisers
and contributors _ have testified that around that time North gave a
number of briefings emphasizing the needs of the rebels but always
left the room afterward, letting others make the pitch for
contributions.
   McFarlane said he was troubled by the draft letter and questioned
North about it.
   ``He said `I believe I have not violated the law,''' McFarlane
said.
   ``He said he had spoken to many groups (and) ... if people said
`I want to help,' that in each case he said `I can't be involved'
and said go to the Contra office.''
   One of the 12 charges against North involves the Sept. 12, 1985,
response sent to then-Rep. Michael Barnes, D-Md., who was chairman
of the House subcommittee on western hemisphere affairs. Newspaper
stories at the time were reporting some of North's involvement in
Contra aid and Barnes asked for the facts.
   ``None of us has solicited funds, facilitated contacts for
prospective potential donors, or otherwise organized or coordinated
the military or paramilitary efforts of the resistance,'' said the
McFarlane letter. The government charges that North drafted it,
knowing it was not true.

   The main political adviser to Prime Minister
Yitzhak Shamir said on Monday that proposals by the Bush
administration suggesting even an indirect Israeli-PLO dialogue were
unacceptable.
   Adviser Yossi Ben-Aharon, said on Israel radio: ``If the United
States can help we will be happy to use its assistance, but not
through a dialogue with the PLO.
   ``We do not object to a system of understandings to which we will
also contribute, because we have an interest in creating an
atmosphere for negotiations,'' he said. ``But we are not ready to
accept the PLO as a partner in any deal.''
   A new rift developed in Israel's coalition government over
Israeli and U.S. news reports saying American officials plan to
propose that Israel and the PLO take steps to quell the 15-month
Palestinian uprising in the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip,
creating an ``atmosphere'' for peace talks.
   The appeals to both Israel and the Palestine Liberation
Organization appeared aimed at bringing the two sides together
eventually.
   Israel's government is led by Shamir of the hard-line, right-wing
Likud bloc, with the center-left Labor Party as an uneasy partner.
   Shamir brands Yasser Arafat's PLO a terrorist group and says
peace cannot be made with such an organization.
   Communications Minister Gad Yacobi of the Labor Party said, also
on Israel radio, that Israel should be responsive to the U.S. offer.
   ``The U.S. readiness to become a mediator between Israel and the
Palestinians has to be welcomed by the state of Israel,'' Yacobi
said. ``We have to be ready to negotiate a peace treaty or a
political settlement between Israel and the Palestinians who live in
the territories, even if they are affiliated, directly or
indirectly, with the PLO.''
   Cabinet Minister Mordechai Gur, also of Labor, said ``Israeli-PLO
talks today can lead to a disaster, because the differences of
positions are so deep.''
   But he endorsed an indirect dialogue, saying ``a limited program
of achieving tranquillity by mutual steps ... can lead to a change
in the positions followed by elections in the territories.''
   The Likud faction responded in Parliament by calling on Labor
ministers to confine themselves to their ministerial duties and
avoid making ``irresponsible statements which are damaging for
Israel's interests.''
   Foreign Minister Moshe Arens met President Bush and Secretary of
State James Baker III in Washington on Monday. The trip is in
advance of Shamir's planned Washington visit in April.
   Since Palestinians began their uprising against Israeli rule in
December 1987, the insurrection has killed 396 Palestinians and 17
Israelis.
   A Palestinian, Saris Atawna, 30, was found beaten to death Monday
in Gaza City's main square, and a sign next to his body said he was
killed for selling drugs and helping Israel, Arab reports said.
   The army said the body of a known drug dealer was found and that
it was investigating.
   Two Palestinian teen-agers suffered bullet wounds on Monday in
clashes between soldiers and stone-throwing youths in Beit Hanoun in
the Gaza Strip, Arab news reports said.
   In south Lebanon on Monday, Israeli troops killed at least three
Palestinian guerrillas in a gunbattle illuminated by parachute
flares after a chase through hills near Israel's border.
   It was the second day straight that Israeli soldiers fought
guerrillas in Israel's self-proclaimed security zone who were headed
for attacks in northern Israel.
   Monday's political furor was not seen as threatening the
coalition government as long as its majority, including party leader
and Finance Minister Shimon Peres, oppose direct talks with the PLO
and see themselves bound by the coalition agreement that rules out
talks with the organization.
   But many senior Labor members agree with Cabinet Minister Ezer
Weitzman, who said Sunday that Israel should negotiate under certain
conditions.
   Their feelings reflect a shift in public opinion in Israel.
According to a December public opinion poll, 55 percent of the
public now support peace talks with the PLO.

   Eastern Airlines imposed a cut-rate pay package on
Machinists workers Monday that gives them far less than the wages
that prompted a 9-day-old strike, and makes the airline the lowest
paying of all major carriers.
   ``I think it's obvious they don't want anybody to come back to
work,'' Wally Haber, a general chairman for the Machinists union,
said of the new pay scale, which applies to union workers who cross
picket lines as well as new hires.
   But Eastern continued to display its resolve to fly, renewing
more routes as part of a gradual rebuilding that centers on Latin
American service and cheap Northeast shuttle flights.
   Some Wall Street analysts said Eastern appears likely to expand
its off-price fare strategy, which was so successful last weekend
that hundreds of people were stranded in airports when they couldn't
get aboard packed Eastern shuttle flights.
   At Miami International Airport, people lined up Monday to buy
tickets instead of demand refunds, and the company reported steadily
increasing sales. The company has recalled about 100 employees,
mostly reservations agents, who were laid off one week ago when
Eastern cut back to 1,500 employees.
   Eastern, which on March 9 filed for federal bankruptcy
reorganization, operated 75 flights Sunday and aimed for 85 Monday.
   The company resumed jetliner service between Miami and New York,
Montreal and San Juan, Puerto Rico. Eastern also has renewed service
on 13 Latin American routes since the strike began March 4.
   Eastern had planned to resume jetliner service between Boston and
Washington on Monday but delayed that until Thursday. Company
spokesman Robin Matell said the company had ``to call an audible.''
   The Air Line Pilots Association, meeting in Washington in
national executive session to discuss strike benefits for Eastern
members, ridiculed the company's credibility and its service plans.
   ``We believe they will be significantly hampered in ever reaching
these stated goals because they don't have the pilots,'' Eastern
pilots spokesman Ron Cole said in Miami.
   The pilots union estimated that by Sunday, Eastern was flying
only 3.5 percent of its pre-strike schedule of 1,040 daily flights.
   The pilots union also charged Eastern ``betrayed its trust to the
flying public'' by leaving about 550 passengers at airports in
Boston, New York and Washington over the weekend. Cole said the
shuttle service previously has had backup flights available to
guarantee a seat to every customer.
   Eastern spokesman James Ashlock said all those left in the
airports overnight were moved out Monday morning.
   Eastern flew about 30,000 people during three days of $12 bargain
fares, which Monday went up to $49, still less than half the normal
$99 weekday fare.
   Eastern insisted its advertisements made clear the shuttle
flights were on a first-come, first-serve basis and said it flew 62
flights Sunday, five more than usual on a weekend.
   Meanwhile, the company filed for injunctive relief in the U.S.
11th Circuit Court of Appeals. No timetable was set for hearing
Eastern's argument, rejected last week by a Miami federal judge,
that the pilots' walkout is illegal.
   An Eastern attorney said the company would ask a federal
bankruptcy court in New York this week to approve the sale of its
Northeast shuttle to Donald Trump for $365 million.
   Representatives of the pilots and mechanics unions said they
would challenge the deal. A Machinists official also said the union
was working on its own bankruptcy reorganization plan for Eastern,
which could include a buyout of the airline.
   The Machinists said the new pay rules that Eastern announced
Monday make cuts much deeper than the $150 million in concessions
demands that spurred the Machinists strike.
   Haber said mechanics' pay would drop from the current $18.83 to
$14 an hour, with new hires receiving a minimum $10 an hour. Ramp
service agents, also called baggage handlers, would go from $15.60
to $11.54, with new hires receiving $10. Machinists janitors who
receive $13.21 an hour would drop to $8.25 with new hires getting a
minimum $5.
   Overtime, holiday and night differential pay are also slashed,
Haber said.
   Haber said the new rules go beyond what the management was
entitled by law to impose when the strike began because they are
worse than the company's final contract offer. There have been no
negotiations since the strike began.
   Haber said the package would make Eastern's pay scales lower than
Continental, currently the lowest among major carriers and, like
Eastern, a subsidiary of Texas Air Corp.
   Although Texas Air Chairman Frank Lorenzo has insisted that
Eastern will survive bankruptcy and return as a major carrier, Haber
said Continental is already moving into Eastern routes.
   ``So he's taking money out of his left pocket and putting it into
his right pocket,'' Haber said. ``We've got to figure out a way to
put a hole in his pocket.''
   Eastern officials acknowledged that they imposed the new pay
rules but dismissed the union's concerns about them.

<DATELINE>SURESNES, France (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A young man shot and killed his
half-sister and his half-brother and then took his own life in a
high school courtyard Monday, officials and news reports said.
   Samir Doulim fired at Abil Jbali and Jbali's sister Ilham Jbali,
both in their 20s, for unknown reasons before turning his pistol on
himself, police reported.
   The French news agency Agence France Presse quoted unidentified
police sources as saying the argument was ``a family quarrel,
possibly of a religious character.'' The agency quoted unidentified
students at the school as saying the two young men reproached Ilham
Jbali for dating a non-Moslem. All three were of Moroccan origin.
   Abil and Ilham Jbali were rushed from Paul Langevin Lycee in this
Paris suburb to two Paris hospitals, and the sister died several
hours later, officials said.
   The brother died several hours after his sister, Agence France
Presse quoted hospital officials as saying.
   Assistant Prosecutor Michele Requin said that because the gunman
was dead, there would be no criminal investigation that might
explain his motives.
   Police initially reported incorrectly that the brother and sister
were killed immediately at the school and that the gunman fled.
   Police sources, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the
drama began at about 2 p.m. when the two young men accompanied Ilham
Jbali to school after stopping at a local cafe.
   When they reached the school, Samir Doulim pulled out a pistol
and began firing at his companions, the sources said. He then turned
the gun on himself.
   Staff members answering the phone at the school said they were
uncertain about the details of the incident and referred all queries
to police.

<HEAD>President Winning Slight Majority in Election</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ANTANANARIVO, Madagascar (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Didier Ratsiraka was
winning a slight majority in election returns Monday night, a
dramatic reversal from previous votes in which the socialist leader
ran up huge majorities.
   All three opposition candidates blamed the 52-year-old
presidsent's policies for economic decline on the island off
southeast Africa. Interior Ministry figures released after about
half the 5.5 million votes had been counted gave the president 56.2
percent.
   In the 1982 election Ratsiraka got 80 percent of the votes, and
he won a 1975 referendum on his presidency with 95 percent.
   He must finish with a majority this time to avoid a runoff with
the leading challenger. As expected, Manandafy Rakotonirina of the
Proletarian Movement Party was in second place with 28.89 percent of
the vote.
   No major incidents were reported during the balloting Sunday.
Ratsiraka had denied an opposition request to allow foreign
observers but the Federation of Christian Churches said it would
monitor the vote in case of fraud.
   Final figures were not expected for several days because of
transport and communications problems on the Indian Ocean island of
226,658 square miles.
   The ruling military chose Ratsiraka as president in 1975. He
broke many ties with France, the former colonial power, and with
other Western countries and set the nation on a socialist course,
nationalizing many foreign-owned industries.
   Natural disasters ranging from cyclones to droughts beset the
island and, with the economy near bankruptcy in 1982, Ratsiraka
began restoring economic ties with the West.
   He and his opponents in this campaign all claimed they had the
support of Western governments and lending institutions.

   White House chief of staff John Sununu had
assets and income together last year of between $530,000 and $1.1
million, including a ski condominium, a residential lot next to his
New Hampshire home and a stake in an insurance agency, according to
a financial disclosure report.
   The document also said Sununu has decided to give up tuition
benefits from Tufts University for his children. Sununu has been on
leave from the school since 1982, and last year received $5,500 in
assistance.
   The law requires senior government officials to reveal their
assets, liabilities and sources of income. It does not require them
to list exact amounts but rather to report values within a range of
money, such as $15,000 to $50,000 and $100,000 to $250,000.
   The top category is anything over $250,000.
   Sununu's holdings are largely in real estate.
   He owns a condominium in Cambridge, Vt., and a residential lot
adjacent to his home in Salem, N.H., and each is valued at between
$100,000 to $250,000. He earned between $15,000 to $50,000 in
condominium rental fees last year.
   The report does not require the listing of a personal residence.
In addition to his home in Salem, Sununu recently bought a home
outside Washington in Fairfax County, Va.
   Other major assets include a 40 percent ownership, valued at
between $100,000 and $250,000 in Lakeside Insurance Agency Inc. It
is listed under the name of his wife, Nancy.
   Sununu also said he had a college retirement and equities fund
worth $100,000 to $250,000 and a Keough retirement account valued at
between $15,000 and $50,000. He listed three bank accounts worth
between $17,000 and $60,000.
   He received $7,000 in speaking fees last year and was paid
$69,103 as governor of New Hampshire.
   In other financial filings:
   _Charles G. Untermeyer, White House personnel director, listed
assets including investments, partnerships and oil and gas holdings
totaling between $155,000 and $420,000.
   His single biggest asset was a Prudential-Bache high-yield fund,
made up of a wide range of corporate bonds. He valued his holdings
in the fund at $100,000 to $250,000 and said it yielded between
$5,000 and $15,000 in 1988 income.
   Untermeyer also listed $1,800 for an article for the Texas
Monthly magazine, $800 for ``three travel stories'' for the Arkansas
Democrat, and $520 for an article for the Naval Institute in
Annapolis, Md.
   _Andrew Card, deputy chief of staff, listed a two-family
apartment in Holbrook, Mass., as his major asset, checking the
category between $100,000 and $250,000.
   He said he earned between $5,000 and $15,000 in rental income
from the apartment last year.
   Card listed $5,262 in pay from the Bush transition office and a
$6,000 a month salary as a consultant for the Bush presidential
campaign, from March 1987 to the Republican National Convention in
August.
   After that, he was paid $2,000 a month as a consultant for the
Bush-Quayle campaign _ but drew another $5,000 a month as a
consultant for the Republican National Committee from the convention
through Bush's inauguration.
   Card listed his assets as between $115,000 and $305,000.
   _Robert M. Gates, deputy CIA director, by contrast, showed few
assets _ a savings account worth between $1,000 and $5,000 and two
Individual Retirement Accounts worth from $15,000 to $50,000 apiece,
one for himself and one for his wife.
   _David Q. Bates, secretary to the Cabinet, listed assets of
$29,000 to $100,000.
   _Frederick McClure, assistant to the president, listed $30,000 to
$100,000 in assets and reported that he was paid a salary of
$132,770 in 1988 as an executive with Texas Air Corp.
   _Jane E. Newman, assistant to the president for operations,
reported salaries from 1988 of $105,000 from the New England
Council, a non-profit regional business association of which she was
president, and $47,359 from the Business and Industry Association of
New Hampshire, a trade group that she headed.

<HEAD>Officials Vote To Reopen Church Closed After Polish Protests</HEAD>

   A Roman Catholic church that was closed
to end a protest by dissident Polish parishioners will be reopened,
with warnings that troublemakers could be arrested, a parish
corporation member said Monday.
   The corporation's five-member executive board, which includes
Bridgeport Bishop Edward Egan, voted privately Friday to reopen
predominantly Polish St. Michael the Archangel Roman Catholic
Church, probably by Sunday, which is Palm Sunday, said Edward
Tulinski Sr., one of two lay members of the corporation.
   ``We've been away from home too long,'' Tulinski said.
   The church has been closed since Feb. 18, when church officials
called police into the church to end a weeklong sit-in staged by
about 200 parishioners who were upset by the transfer of a popular
Polish priest, the Rev. Roman Palaszewski.
   On the advice of the corporation's lawyer, signs will be posted
threatening the arrest of anyone who attempts to occupy the church
or start any activity not authorized by the pastor, the Rev. John
Bambol, Tulinski said.
   The dissidents have held prayer vigils outside the church each
Sunday since the closing. They have charged that Bambol engineered
Palaszewski's ouster because he was too active in the Polish
community. They also questioned Bambol's commitment to maintaining
the church's Polish character.
   Bambol and his supporters have blamed much of the unrest on
recent immigrants from Poland, and church officials have refused to
meet with the dissidents.
   Henry Chmiel, one of two parishioners arrested when they refused
to leave the church, vowed to continue the protest despite the
arrest warning.
   ``I'll be the first to get arrested again,'' he said.
   The dissidents are talking about filing a lawsuit challenging the
church's authority to have them expelled last month, said Halina
Chmiel, Chmiel's wife and one of the dissident leaders. They planned
to meet with an attorney this week, she said.
   But Monsignor Nicholas V. Grieco, a spokesman for Egan, said the
protesters' demands remain non-negotiable: Palaszewksi will not be
returned to the church and Bambol will not be removed.
   Tulinski said church officials did not publicize Friday's meeting
or announce plans to reopen the church because they did not want it
to become a media event. A letter was sent to registered
parishioners.
   Tulinski would not divulge exactly when the church will be
reopened and referred questions to the church rectory, where the
telephone was answered by an answering machine and calls weren't
returned.

<HEAD>NASA Administrator Says Replacement To Be Named Soon</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   NASA administrator James C. Fletcher,
who said months ago that he wanted to retire, announced on Monday
that he expects President Bush to name a new space agency leader
within two weeks.
   ``I think he (Bush) will have a successor named hopefully next
week or the week after,'' Fletcher said in an impromptu news
conference following the launch of space shuttle Discovery.
   Fletcher said he had been in contact with the White House and is
``getting a little anxious about my situation. I'm a lame duck, so
to speak.''
   The National Aeronautics and Space Administration chief blamed
the delay in announcing his successor, in part, on the fight between
the White House and the Senate over the failed appointment of former
Sen. John Tower to be secretary of defense.
   ``They (Bush administration officials) got tied up with John
Tower and a lot of other appointments,'' he said. ``I've been
assured _ of course, I was assured it would be February _ that in a
week or two there would be somebody new.''
   Fletcher has twice served as NASA administrator. He first held
the job in the 1970s, and then took it again in the aftermath of the
Challenger disaster in 1986.
   Asked if he thought NASA had improved since the space shuttle
blew up and killed seven astronauts.
   ``You bet I do,'' he said. ``I'm really proud of the team. They
have come a long way.''

   The other young Americans wanted to know about war
and economics. But Nichole Pitman loves a young Russian, so she
asked the Politburo member if it would be all right to marry him. He
said yes, but not just yet.
   Nichole, 18, is from Cincinnati, Ohio. She put the question to
Lev N. Zaikov, 55, the Moscow Communist Party boss, who is more
accustomed to talking about President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's reform
programs.
   She chose the question, Nichole said, because Pavel Lvov, a
17-year-old Moscow student, visited her school on an exchange
program in January and they fell in love. She wanted to know if
Soviet laws would keep them from marrying.
   At the end of the question-and-answer session, Nichole approached
Zaikov and showed him Lvov's picture.
   When she asked for his views on Americans marrying Russians, ``he
said they should, if they're in love,'' Nichole reported later. ``He
wanted to know how old we were. When I told him, he said, `Well,
that's kind of young,' and he suggested we wait awhile.''
   She attends Princeton High School in Cincinnati and was among 140
American high school students received by Zaikov and other officials
at the Moscow city hall.
   ``I was almost afraid to ask,'' said Nichole, who is in her
fourth year of Russian language study. ``Everyone else was asking
about nuclear war and `Star Wars' and economics. But I wanted to
know, so I asked.''
   Her question and part of Zaikov's answer were shown later on
Vremya, the evening television news.

   A man who admitted murdering his teen-age
sister-in-law because ``women flaunt their bodies'' was convicted
Monday of raping and mutilating the girl before killing her.
   John R. Weber, 25, of Phillips in northern Wisconsin, was found
guilty on seven counts of sexual assault and one count each of
mutilation and false imprisonment in the November 1986
torture-murder of Carla Lenz, 17, the sister of his wife, Emily, 22.
   The verdict sets up the second phase of Weber's trial, which will
focus on the defendant's sanity in the death of Miss Lenz and the
attempted murder of his wife last November. Prosecutors said Weber
planned a similar fate for his wife almost two years after killing
Miss Lenz.
   Circuit Judge Gary Carlson ordered the second phase of the trial
to begin Tuesday.
   ``I don't have any reaction to the verdict,'' said attorney John
Reid, who along with lawyer James Lex defended Weber.
   County District Attorney Paul Barnett said he was ``obviously
pleased'' with the verdict. ``If you're asking me if he got what I
think he deserved, yes.''
   During the trial, jurors heard a gruesome tape recording, which
authorities said was Weber's voice describing the torture and murder
of his sister-in-law.
   The tape, found in Weber's car, was played as the prosecution
completed its case Saturday. It said the teen-ager died because
``women flaunt their bodies and think they can get anything they
want.''
   Weber's wife identified the voice on the tape as that of her
husband. The defense rested its case Monday without calling a
witness.
   As the trial was about to start last week, Weber pleaded guilty
to half of the 18 charges against him, including the kidnapping and
first-degree murder of Miss Lenz and the attempted murder of his
wife. But he maintained he was innocent by reason of insanity.
   But Weber pleaded innocent on the nine charges involving the
torture and rape of Miss Lenz.

<HEAD>Senator Complains of Bid-Rigging at U.S. Base in Japan</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A senator complained on Monday that Japanese
contractors rigged bids at the U.S. naval base of Yokosuka on Tokyo
Bay and were let off too lightly by the Japanese government.
   Sen. Frank Murkowski,R-Alaska, was testifying at an investigation
of access to Japanese projects for American construction firms. The
hearing, conducted by the office of U.S. Trade Representative Carla
Hill, was required by the Trade Act of last summer.
   ``The bidding on projects at the U.S. base is supervised by
Japanese nationals employed there, and I'm told that American
contractors have been unable to win any contracts,'' Murkowski said
in an interview afterwards.
   ``I would think we would have enough Americans there to supervise
the bidding.''
   After the investigation, President Bush may have to decide
whether or not the U.S. construction industry has been hurt by
Japanese practises, and if so what retaliation, if any, he wants to
take.
   Murkoswki said that last December, the Japanese Fair Trade
Commission fined 70 Japanese firms for rigging bids on projects at
Yokosuka and issued warnings to 70 others. He quoted a book on the
Japanese industry by Koji Tatezawa as saying that the Japanese
Construction Ministry refused a recommendation from the commission
to ban the firms for six to nine months from bidding on official
projects, and banned them only for a month that ended Jan. 8.
   Murkowski said:
   ``One wonders how this type of penalty is going to effectively
deter firms from engaging in dango'' -- which he defined as a system
for rotating the winning bid among Japanese firms.
   He recalled that last May Japanese Ambassador Nobuo Matsunaga and
Commerce Secretary William Verity exchanged letters on making it
easier for U.S. firms to enter the Japanese construction market.
Significant barriers nevertheless remain, Murkowski said.
   ``The only way these barriers can be removed is through a
commitment by the Japanese government to expand the coverage of the
arrangement, and to devote more resources to the enforcement of laws
prohibiting anti-competitive practices such as dango,'' he concluded.

<HEAD>Papandreou Government Survives Confidence Vote</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The Socialist government of Prime Minister
Andreas Papandreou survived a censure motion early Tuesday by 155
votes to 123 votes in the 300-member Parliament.
   The roll call was held at Monday midnight after a three-day
debate on the motion presented by the conservative New Democracy
opposition party.
   New Democracy leader Constantine Mitsotakis accused the
government of ``undermining the institutions and democracy.'' He
also pointed to a banking scandal in which Papandreou and senior
Cabinet ministers were accused of raking in millions in payoffs.
   Deputies from Papandreou's Panhellenic Socialist Movement cheered
and applauded when Speaker Yiannis Alevras announced the voting
result. The Socialists control 157 seats in the single-chamber
Parliament.
   After the vote, Papandreou announced that three Socialist
deputies who abstained would be dismissed from the party.
   Of 278 deputies in the chamber for the vote, 123 voted for
censure. The Socialists picked up a vote from an independent deputy.
   New Democracy, with 111 seats, received support from independents
and a small, conservative splinter group. The Communists, with 10
seats, abstained.
   In a speech during the debate, Papandreou indirectly accused the
CIA of helping the Greek banker involved in the multimillion-dollar
scandal to flee the country.
   The prime minister rejected a U.S. State Department statement
denying that a self-proclaimed CIA agent ever worked for the
intelligence agency.
   ``The statement issued by the United States Embassy that Mr.
Mailis was not part of the CIA is unacceptable,'' Papandreou said.
   The purported agent, Tom Mailis, told a parliamentary
fact-finding committee last week that banker-publisher George
Koskotas was a CIA agent trying to undermine Greece.
   Mailis has not been available for further comment.
   The State Department, in a statement issued Sunday through the
U.S. Embassy in Athens, said that ``neither he nor the others he
reportedly has alleged to work for the CIA now work or ever have
worked for the CIA.''
   ``In whose interest was it to allow Koskotas to flee Greece? In
the United States he has the entire media available to him to attack
the government. So again I ask, in whose interest was it to make him
flee?'' Papandreou said.
   He reiterated a call for Koskotas' immediate extradition from the
United States and threatened ``painful'' consequences if Koskotas
was not sent to Greece before June elections here.
   ``I will tell you about the consequences before the elections and
they will be painful,'' he said.
   Last week, Papandreau hinted at consequences for the United
States. On Saturday he made a reference to his government's decision
to shut down one of four U.S. military bases in Greece. He said
talks on a new bases agreement were continuing but that ``their
(bases') time of stay in Greece is running out daily.''
   Koskotas fled Greece last November after being indicted in a $200
million fraud, forgery and embezzlement scandal.
   He was arrested in the United States and is in a Salem, Mass.,
jail awaiting an extradition hearing.
   Koskotas, 34, has alleged that Papandreou and senior Cabinet
members authorized plans to siphon millions of dollars from the Bank
of Crete while Koskotas was chairman. He also claimed they received
millions of dollars in payoffs.
   Most of his allegations were reported in the March 13 issue of
the U.S. news magazine Time.
   Mitsotakis, leader of the opposition New Democracy Party, accused
Papandreou of not replying to the allegations and described his
charges of CIA involvement ``a children's story.''
   ``It is not the foreign and domestic centers that are
destabilizing Greece,'' Mitsotakis said, adding that ``you
(Papandreou) are the one that has turned Greece into a banana
republic.''
   Mitsotakis said his party submitted the censure motion because
the government was ``undermining the institutions and democracy.''
   He also charged that Socialist officials were ``deeply involved''
in the Koskotas affair.
   The conservative also accused Papandreou's government of being
involved in illegal arms shipments to the Sandinista government in
Nicaragua and to Iran and Iraq when those two countries were at war.
   ``I believe the arms scandals are much larger than the Koskotas
affair,'' Mitsotakis said.
   Papandreou's only response was to say that ``Mr. Mitsotakis went
overboard tonight with his lies and slander.''

<TEXT>
   National security adviser Brent Scowcroft, who
made at least $527,894 last year as a private consultant and
speaker, has removed himself from decision-making affecting some 70
U.S. companies, including such corporate giants as General Motors
and General Electric.
   Scowcroft's government disclosure form, required under provisions
of the Ethics in Government Act of 1978, also shows the retired Air
Force general was unable to specify for whom he provided services as
a hired consultant for Kissinger Associates.
   In an letter about his financial reporting form, Scowcroft told
White House counsel C. Boyden Gray that former Secretary of State
Henry A. Kissinger, who heads Kissinger Associates, ``denied my
request for a list of the clients for whom I worked.'' Scowcroft
reported receiving $293,300 for his services to Kissinger.
   Scowcroft said that ``under my contractual relationship with
Kissinger Associates, I worked for the company, not directly for its
clients.''
   Scowcroft has at least temporarily removed himself from decisions
involving dozens of companies in which he has a financial interest.
The list reads like a virtual ``Who's Who'' of corporate America,
including several major defense contractors and high-technology
giants such as IBM, Lockheed Corp., the RAND Corp., and Aerospace
Corp. Scowcroft received over $16,000 in consulting fees from
Lockheed, for example. He also got $50,000 to perform as a
consultant to the National Council for Peace and Security.
   The disclosure form showed Scowcroft has extensive bank and stock
holdings. Because officials are required under the law only to list
the valuations of assets in monetary ranges, the form indicated that
Scowcroft's holdings in 1988 were worth between $1,079,000 and
$3,265,000.
   Scowcroft reported liabilities ranging from $200,002 to $500,000.
   Because a part of his income came from interest and dividends,
which also needed only to be listed in value ranges, Scowcroft's
report showed he earned between $527,894 and $649,994.
   In the letter to Gray, Scowcroft said he intends to ``place my
common stock holdings'' in a qualified blind trust _ over which
he'll have no control _ and he would authorize the trustee ``to sell
off my stock in companies that perform services that could create a
conflict or an appearance of a conflict with my duties.''
   In the meantime, he said, ``I am recused from all matters that
have a direct and predictable effect on, or affect the financial
interests of, the entities identified'' in the disclosure form.
   ``Given the industry and sector-wide effect of most matters that
come before the assistant to the president for national security
affairs,'' the letter said, ``I plan to request a ... waiver with
respect to any of my interests that are not so substantial as to
affect my actions in matters involving broad policy issues.''
   Deputy White House press secretary Roman Popadiuk said White
House lawyers are reviewing Scowcroft's holdings to determine which
of the 70 companies could be taken off the recusal list.
   The disclosure form also showed that Scowcroft, formally national
security adviser to President Gerald R. Ford and later a member of
the presidential commission that investigated the Iran-Contra
affair, was a hot commodity on the mashed-potato circuit.
   Scowcroft reported earning $53,751 in speaking honoraria,
including appearances before such diverse audiences as the high-tech
giant, TRW, the Bonneville Knife &amp; Fork Club of Salt Lake City and
Lawrence Livermore Laboratories.
   Scowcroft, whose national security post pays about $89,000 a
year, also received $49,452 last year for his membership on various
corporate boards.

   The state Welfare Department was given
temporary custody Monday of an 8-year-old child taken from the home
of a self-styled inventor who claimed he ``married'' the girl and
her mother on orders from God.

himself as a messenger from God, will remain in welfare department
custody, pending a final hearing March 28.
   Newman claimed in a more than five-year legal battle with the
U.S. Patent Office that he had built a machine that produced more
energy than it consumed. In February 1988, a federal judge upheld
the Patent Office's refusal to grant a patent, saying there was
insufficient scientific evidence to support Newman's claim.
   Barlow, serving as George County Youth Court judge, also ordered
that the girl's 3-year-old brother be taken from their mother and
placed in the care of the welfare agency pending a hearing later in
the week.
   Newman threatened to file suit against all those responsible for
removing the child.
   ``This is going to go a lot greater than right here,'' said
Newman, 52, who claims to follow all major religions.
   Newman's statement said he had ``followed God's orders'' by
marrying his secretary, Anne Mizelle Harrell, 30, and her 8-year-old
daughter. The child was removed from Newman's home Friday by George
County sheriff's deputies.
   Newman said a recent religious conversion led to his revelation
that God wanted him to marry Ms. Harrell while he was still legally
married to his wife of 14 years, Ellen Newman. Mrs. Newman moved to
her parents' home in Alabama after Newman declared he was marrying
the child.
   He said he has not had sexual intercourse with the child. ``I
told her that if there is any sexual relations between me and that
child, God will tell her when, and she should not feel pressured,''
he said.
   Sexual relations with a child under 14 constitutes capital rape,
which carries the penalty of death or life imprisonment in
Mississippi.
   An attorney for Mitchell Harrell, the children's natural father,
said after the hearing that Harrell would seek custody of the girl
and boy.

<UNK>General Strike Called for Tuesday in Brazil ^By STAN LEHMAN ^Associated
Press Writer</UNK>
<DATELINE>SAO PAULO, Brazil (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Labor leaders said they expect Brazil's
major cities to be brought to a complete halt on Tuesday at the
beginning of a 48-hour general strike called to protest frozen wages.
   Jair Meneguelli, president of the radical left Central Workers
Union, predicted on Monday that the strike ``will be the biggest .
.. this country has ever seen'' and will keep millions of workers
off their jobs. .
   It will be the third general strike since Brazil returned to
civilian rule in 1985. A December 1986 strike was only partially
successful and a strike in August 1987 failed completely.
   ``This year, the two labor movements have put aside their
rivalries and we are much better prepared, '' Meneguelli said.
   The strike has been planned for weeks by his union and the more
moderate General Workers Central, the two largest and most militant
labor organizations in this continent-sized nation of 144 million
people.
   Of Brazil's 60 million-strong work force, the two organizations
claim to represent nearly 35 million workers.
   Meneguelli and Joaquim dos Santos Andrade, president of the
General Workers Central, appeared together at a news conference
Monday.
   ``We will stop all economic activity in Sao Paulo (South
America's largest city and Brazil's industrial and financial center
with 10 million people), Rio de Janeiro, Porto Alegre, Belo
Horizonte and many other cities,'' Meneguelli said. Andrade nodded
in agreement.
   Marilia Goncalves, news media spokeswoman for the Labor Ministry,
said by phone the government would respect the workers' right to
strike and that ``everything indicates it will be a peaceful
movement.''
   The wage freeze is part of a government economic package
introduced Jan. 15 aimed at controlling runaway inflation of more
than 1,000 percent.
   The measures included a freeze on prices and brought inflation
down from a rate of 28.7 percent in December to 3.6 percent for the
first 11 days in February, the latest period for which figures are
available.
   But Meneguelli said the wage freeze cut workers' buying power by
up to 49 percent ``and we want it back.''
   The government agrees that purchasing power dropped, ``but it
still has not calculated by how much,'' Miss Goncalves said.
   The Sao Paulo State Federation of Industries said the general
strike was aimed exclusively at destroying the economic package,
``which despite its errors was the only viable way to stop a process
of hyperinflation that threatened to lead Brazil to chaos.''

<HEAD>Eds: CORRECTS spelling throughout of name of program to Brilliant

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The former chief of the ``Star Wars'' research
program urged the Pentagon upon his retirement to embrace a new plan
for an anti-missile defense system relying on thousands of
``Brilliant Pebbles'' floating in space.
   Lt. Gen. James A. Abrahamson, who retired at the end of January,
wrote in an ``End of Tour'' memo dated Feb. 9 that the concept known
as Brilliant Pebbles offered ``both improved performance and
dramatic cost reduction.'' He said the total cost could be $25
billion, far less than previous estimates.
   ``I believe that with continued effort and innovation, a
Brilliant Pebbles concept that meets Phase 1 Joint Chiefs of Staff
requirements can be proven in two years, with deployment starting
three years later,'' Abrahamson added.
   ``This could be accomplished for less than $10 billion.''
   The Brilliant Pebbles program has been disclosed previously and
is based on research underway at the Lawrence Livermore National
Laboratory. The idea is to devise a small, cheap, light satellite
that carries its own small computer, sensors and propulsion system.
   Thousands of these tiny satellites could then be boosted into
space, encircling the globe. If the Soviet Union launched nuclear
missiles against the United States or its allies, the Brilliant
Pebbles could home in on the missiles' exhaust plumes and rocket off
to destroy the missiles by colliding with them.
   While the program has been detailed previously, Abrahamson's
ringing endorsement of the work had not been reported. The Center
for Peace and Freedom, a conservative, Washington-based think tank
that has promoted Star Wars, released a copy of Abrahamson's memo on
Monday.
   Lt. Col. Edwina Palmer, a spokeswoman for Star Wars, said the
Pentagon would have no comment on the matter.
   Abrahamson is traveling, but he did write what is known as an
``end of tour report'' to acting Defense Secretary William H. Taft
III, the spokeswoman said. That report was a ``private
communication'' and the Pentagon has nothing to say on the matter,
she added.
   Abrahamson's successor, Lt. Gen. George L. Monahan Jr., is
scheduled to testify on Tuesday on Star Wars before a House
subcommittee.
   The Star Wars program, known formally as the Strategic Defense
Initiative, is a research effort to develop lasers and other exotic
weapons that could automatically shoot down nuclear missiles fired
at the United States. Launched by former President Ronald Reagan,
the United States has so far spent about $16 billion on the effort.
   The Pentagon just recently estimated that a Phase I Star Wars
system using both ground-based and space-based weapons and sensors
would cost about $69 billion. Abrahamson, in his memo, said the
Brilliant Pebbles program was exciting because it offered ``greater
opportunities for an earlier and more affordable SDI deployment.''
   To complete a Phase 1 system built around Brilliant Pebbles,
Abrahamson said the Pentagon would need to spend only about $11
billion on a new space-based sensor system and about $4 billion on a
new ``command and control ground complex.''
   ``Thus, an entire SDI Phase I system ... should not cost more
than approximately $25 billion,'' he concluded.
   The retired three-star Air Force general also argued in his
report to Taft the Pentagon should increase the size of the staff of
the SDI Organization as research moved to development; that the head
of Star Wars be a four-star general instead of a three-star officer
and that he be given more direct control over the various projects,
and that negotiations be opened with Congress to obtain an ``up
front'' agreement on Star Wars funding for the next two years,
locking in totals that would not be tampered with.

<TEXT>
   A 60-year-old woman was sentenced Monday to
20 years to life in state prison for selling a half-pound of cocaine
to an undercover police investigator.
   The defense attorney for Martha Weatherspoon objected to the
sentence as ``a little harsh,'' noting that his client would be 80
before she is eligible for parole.
   ``At her age, it is life,'' said the lawyer, Hurclee Maye.
   Weatherspoon, a Syracuse resident, was convicted in January of
first-degree criminal sale and possession of a controlled substance
and other drug-related charges.
   She admitted to selling 8 ounces of cocaine last October for
$8,000, but claimed she was only acting as a delivery person for
20-year-old Darryl Gibbs of Brooklyn, her co-defendant.
   However, Gibbs was acquitted of all charges after claiming he
went to Weatherspoon's residence to buy drugs, not sell them.
   Assistant District Attorney Richard Southwick asked Judge Walter
Gorman to impose the maximum sentence of 25 years to life.
   Southwick said Weatherspoon was involved in a ``fairly
sophisticated narcotics distribution system'' that used electronic
pagers and ``stash'' houses.

<TEXT>
   A seaman being winched from a cargo ship
that went aground off southwest England slipped from the harness and
fell 180 feet into the raging sea, helicopter crewmen said Monday.
   He was reported missing and presumed dead.
   Air force and navy helicopters rescued all of the other 15
crewmen, most of whom were Koreans or Filipinos, from the 2,500-ton
Panamanian-registered ship Secil Japan.
   Officials said the vessel's cargo of timber shifted as the ship
was battered by heavy seas Sunday night.
   The captain radioed a distress call when the ship was six miles
off the north coast of the county of Cornwall in southwestern
England, said John Shephard of the Falmouth coast guard service.
   He said the Secil Japan was listing heavily and was driven by
winds into Hell's Mouth, a cliff-encircled bay near St. Ives, and
ran aground on rocks.
   Local residents lined up their cars on the cliff tops and
illuminated the scene with the headlights to help rescuers.
   Petty Officer Marty Dodd who was aboard one of the navy
helicpters told reporters of the unsuccesssful rescue effort.
   ``We got a high line out on to the ship but nobody made an
attempt to pick it up,'' he said. ``Then one man came out and got
into the strop and we brought him through the water as the ship was
engulfed in waves.
   ``But as he got near us he opened his arms, slipped away and fell
into the sea. We could see him swimming in the surf but we were only
five yards from the cliff and couldn't get down to him.''
   A navy spokesman said the harness was checked and no faults were
found.
   There was no immediate identification of the missing crewman.

<HEAD>California Assembly Barely Approves Restrictions On Assault Weapons</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By STEVE LAWRENCE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A bill that would virtually ban the
sale of more than 40 types of assault weapons in California,
including the one used to kill five schoolchildren, was approved
Monday by the Assembly without a vote to spare.
   The measure was sent to the Senate by a 41-38 vote _ the bare
majority needed for approval in the 80-seat lower house _ after a
sometimes heated, two-hour debate.
   The Assembly action means that both houses of the Legislature
have now passed bills to restrict access to the weapons. The Senate
overwhelmingly approved a broader proposal last Thursday.
   But the author of the Assembly bill, Assemblyman Mike Roos, said
supporters of the two measures face still face ticklish obstacles in
getting one of the bills to Gov. George Deukmejian, who has
indicated support for Roos' proposal but not the Senate version.
   ``It's not downhill,'' he told reporters after the vote. ``It's
going to be vote by vote. Every time I change a line (in the bill)
it's a reason for people to drop off.''
   Roos said he had lost some support for the bill over the weekend
because of last-minute pressure from gun groups, who want to prevent
California from becoming the first state to ban assault weapons.
   The two bills were introduced in January after a deranged
drifter, Patrick Purdy, opened fire at a crowded Stockton
schoolyard, killing five young students and wounding 29 others, as
well as a teacher.
   Purdy sprayed more than 100 rounds across the playground, using a
semiautomatic version of the AK-47, an assault rifle that police say
is becoming increasingly popular with street gangs.
   Roos' bill started off as identical to the bill sponsored by
Senate leader David Roberti, which includes a general definition of
assault weapons. But Roos' bill was restricted in committee to cover
about 36 models of rifles, eight types of pistols, three types of
shotguns, and nearly identical weapons.
   The Assembly measure, with few exceptions, would bar the
manufacture, importation, sale, giving or lending of the assault
weapons after next Jan. 1. Use of one of the weapons in a felony
could result in a five-year prison sentence enhancement.
   Adults who legally possessed the weapons before next Oct. 1 could
keep them if they registered them with the state. Anyone who wanted
to legally obtain one of the guns after Sept. 30 and keep it after
Jan. 1 would have to obtain the same type of permit required for a
machine gun.
   Only about 350 machine-gun permits are in use now in the state.
   After next Jan. 1, an assault weapon could only be sold to a
licensed gun dealer or to someone out of state, under the bill's
provisions.
   Differences between the Roos and Roberti measures will probably
be ironed out in a two-house conference committee, Roos said,
assuming that the bills make it through the opposite house.

   Snow and freezing rain were scattered across the northern Plains
and Great Lakes on Monday, and rain spread across the Southeast and
the Northwest.
   A cold front extending from Canada across the northern Plains
brought scattered snow showers to northern sections of the Great
Lakes and freezing rain from western North Dakota into southern
Montana.
   Cold air was expected to drive southward into the northern
Rockies, increasing wind and bringing snow through the region
Tuesday. A high wind watch was posted along the mountains of
southeastern Wyoming through Tuesday.
   As much as 5 to 8 inches of snow was expected around the
Yellowstone National Park region.
   A stationary front separated unseasonably warm air across the
Gulf Coast states from cooler air across the central Plains and Ohio
Valley, and rain was scattered along the front from Kentucky through
North Carolina.
   Low pressure west of Vancouver Island continued to spin off a
series of upper air disturbances across the Northwest. Showers were
scattered along the northern Pacific Coast and Eugene, Ore., had
received 1.74 inches of rain in 24 hours.
   Farther inland, 3 to 6 inches of snow fell overnight in the
mountains near Lake Tahoe, on the Nevada-California border, and wind
gusts over 70 mph were measured south of nearby Reno, Nev.
   But Colorado Springs, Colo., warmed to a record 70 degrees, one
degree above the former record set in 1959.
   Temperatures around the nation at 2 p.m. EST ranged from 18
degrees at Cut Bank, Mont., to 93 at Junction, Texas. Monday's low
for the Lower 48 states was 19 degrees below zero at Fort Kent,
Maine.
   For Tuesday, widespread showers were forecast from the Pacific
Northwest coast into northern Idaho and from northern Iowa into the
upper Great Lakes and northern Illinois. Thunderstorms, some
possibly severe, were forecast from eastern Missouri and much of
Kentucky across Illinois, Indiana and southern Lower Michigan into
western Ohio. Widespread snow was forecast from the Montana Rockies
through the northern Plains into the upper Mississippi Valley.
   Highs in the 20s were predicted from northwestern Montana through
North Dakota and northern Minnesota into northwestern Wisconsin; in
the 30s and 40s from the northern Rockies and the central
Intermountain areas through the middle Missouri Valley and much of
the Great Lakes region into New England; in the 70s from the
southern California valleys through central parts of Arizona and New
Mexico, much of Oklahoma, the Ohio and Tennessee valleys into South
Carolina; in the 80s from the desert Southwest across the southern
Rockies, much of Texas, the lower Mississippi Valley and Gulf Coast
region into Florida; in the 90s across the middle Rio Grande Valley
of Texas; and in the 50s or 60s across much of the rest of the
nation.

   Thousands of newspaper readers in San Francisco, Chicago and
Springfield, Ill., on Monday found mock-ups of their favorite
dailies spouting anti-war harangues printed by groups protesting
U.S. policy in El Salvador.
   Groups in the three cities said they placed fake front pages
around actual copies of the papers in vending machines. Officials at
all three papers denounced the imitations, and at least two were
considering legal action.
   At first glance, the fake front pages appeared to be the real
fronts of The Chicago Tribune, the San Francisco Chronicle and The
(Springfield) State Journal-Register. But readers got a surprise on
closer examination.
   The fake Chicago Tribune had the newspaper's masthead but
contained stories with headlines proclaiming, ``U.S. at War in El
Salvador,'' and ``Death Squad Activities,'' Tribune officials said.
The other phony newspapers had similar headlines.
   Bleary-eyed commuters in San Francisco might not have immediately
noticed that their newspaper was called the ``Chornicle,'' not the
``Chronicle,'' but they may have done a double-take at the
front-page apology from ``Chornicle'' editors for the newspaper's
coverage of El Salvador.
   A news release delivered to The Associated Press in San Francisco
said 100 members of a group called the Citizens against the U.S. War
in El Salvador put out more than 10,000 copies of the phony papers
``to get out the truth about the situation in El Salvador.''
   ``We believe that actions like this can contribute to building a
political movement in the U.S. that can stop the war in El Salvador
and support self-determination for the Salvadoran people,'' the news
release said.
   In Illinois, a group calling itself the People for a Free El
Salvador claimed responsibility for the ploy.
   The Baltimore Sun and The Arizona Daily Star were the targets of
similar stunts in January.
   A Tribune spokeswoman, Ruth Ellen Roguski, said the bogus front
page was placed on thousands of newspapers in the city and in state
editions circulated in Springfield.
   Ms. Roguski said the Tribune assumed the protesters merely placed
a coin in the vending machines to gain access to the newspapers.
   ``While the right of free speech and political protest is
understood and appreciated, tampering with the front page of the
Tribune interferes with and distorts our mission as a newspaper and
our right to do business,'' the Tribune said.
   ``The Tribune will take every legal step possible to prosecute
the people responsible and prevent any reoccurrence.''
   Steve Fagan, editor of the State Journal-Register, said the phony
front page placed around his newspaper had the headline, ``U.S.
Continues to Wage War in El Salvador.'' A box on the page disclaimed
any affiliation with the newspaper.
   Fagan said about 30 of the newspaper's 200 street boxes were the
target of the protesters.
   ``We view this as a childish prank as well as an incident of
vandalism and criminal trespass,'' Fagan said. ``The worst part of
it is this is an unwarranted intrusion on our readers.''
   Jessie Knight, vice president of the San Francisco Newspaper
Agency, which handles printing and distribution functions for the
Chronicle, said he would be meeting with attorneys to see if
criminal or civil action could be filed against those responsible.
   ``We think that it's certainly something that we want to stop
from happening,'' Knight said.
   In Chicago, Leslie Schuld of the Committee in Solidarity with the
People of El Salvador applauded the effort but did not take credit.
   ``There has been little in the press about what is happening down
there,'' Schuld said. ``The Tribune in particular hasn't been
covering the death squad activities adequately.''

<DATELINE>LONG BEACH, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Attorneys defending two Cambodian
immigrants who killed a German shepherd puppy for food say the two
are innocent because the animal was killed humanely.
   Sokheng Chea, 32, and Seng Ou, 33, both of Long Beach,
acknowledged they killed the 4-month-old puppy late last June. They
hit it over the head with a blunt object, slashed its throat and
began skinning it.
   But police, alerted by a neighbor who heard the dog's yelps,
arrived and arrested the men.
   Chea and Ou went on trial last week in Municipal Court for
misdemeanor cruelty to animal charges, which carry a maximum penalty
of one year in jail and a $2,000 fine.
   The trial is being watched by both Asian community leaders and
animal rights groups.
   The defense says the dog was killed humanely in a way consistent
with contemporary slaughterhouses, while the prosecution says the
killing was a crime because it was done in an unnecessarily cruel
way.
   ``If the dog had been some other kind of animal _ like a chicken
or a duck or a pig _ these people wouldn't be in court,'' said Joe
Beason, an attorney representing Chea. ``While Americans consider it
completely acceptable to go out and shoot a deer, those same hunters
would disapprove of killing a dog for food.''
   But prosecutor Sarah Lazarus said, ``We intend to prove that this
was cruelty. It's cultural to the extent that each segment of our
society has its own cultural customs, but some of those customs can
be woven into the fabric of our society and others cannot.''
   Judge Bradford L. Andrews ruled last week that killing a dog for
food is not in itself illegal, and the prosecution must prove the
dog was ``maimed, wounded, tortured, mutilated or tormented'' in a
manner beyond that required to prepare it as food.
   Chea and Ou have refused comment until the case is over.
   Local Asian leaders said dogs and cats are considered delicacies
in some Southeast Asian countries, and fear publicity from the case
may result in intensified anti-Asian bias. At least one death threat
has been received by the defendants.

   A Liberian-registered chemical tanker exploded and
burst into flames off central Japan on Tuesday, and 23 crew members
were reported missing, a coast guard official said.
   The 23,038-ton Maasgusar, which was carrying methanol and other
highly flammable liquids, ``is still burning and explosions are
ripping through its body,'' said Akira Sasaki of the Maritime Safety
Agency. He said the ship was listing to left but still afloat.
   The crew consisted of 19 Filipinos and four Britons. Sasaki
identified the captain as Rickard James, 50, from England.
   The cause of the fire was undetermined, Sasaki said.
   The Maasgusar was bound for Yokohama from Texas when it caught
fire about 60 miles off Nojimazaki, south of Tokyo, the official
said.
   The coast guard sent eight rescue boats and five Self-Defense
Force planes to combat the blaze.''

   The Bush administration is expected to ask
Congress for more than $50 million in additional humanitarian aid
for the Nicaraguan Contras to ensure their survival until early next
year, U.S. officials said Monday.
   The existing $27 million program, which provides for food,
clothing, shelter and medical services, expires at the end of the
month. The request is likely to be sent to Capitol Hill before the
lawmakers begin a two-week spring recess this weekend.
   Later, Contra leader Adolfo Calero told reporters after a meeting
at the State Department he was informed that the administration
request would be ``40 some odd million dollars.''
   As described by officials speaking on condition of anonymity, the
request is part of a broad array of activities by the new
administration designed primarily to achieve a democratic outcome in
Nicaragua through a bipartisan approach by the administration and
the Congress.
   If the Sandinista government shows a willingness to establish
western-style democracy, the administration is prepared to move
toward more normal trade and diplomatic relations with Nicaragua.
   Alternatively, the administration has prepared a list of
potential punitive measures if the Sandinistas do not allow a
democratic system to take root.
   More than 10,000 Contras are assembled in Honduras at camps near
the Nicaraguan border.
   Some members of Congress are prepared to try to link any new aid
program for the Contras to their resettlement in Nicaragua or in
third countries. This would be consistent with the wishes of the
five Central American presidents, who last month called fo the
drawing up of a plan within 90 days for the demobilization of the
rebels.
   In return, Nicaraguan President Daniel Ortega promised to move up
national elections from November 1990 to February 1990. The
administration wants the Contras to remain intact until after
elections as an incentive for the Sandinista government to ensure
opposition forces are treated fairly during the electoral process.
   U.S. officials who asked not to be identified said they are
worried that the Hondurans may be too eager for the demobilization
of the Contras. To underscore the administration's concern, Robert
Kimmitt, the State Department's third-ranking official, was in
Tegucigalpa on Monday to explain the U.S. position to Honduran
leaders.
   He did not plan to visit other Central American countries. But
the special U.S. envoy for Central America, Morris Busby, was in the
region last week sounding out the presidents of the four countries
friendly to the United States _ El Salvador, Guatemala, Costa Rica
and Honduras.
   The United States asked Honduras on Monday to let the Contras
remain in Honduras for another year, the New York Times reported.
   The appeal was made by Kimmitt, the new undersecretary of state
for political affairs, during a meeting in Honduras with President
Jose Azcona Hoyo, the newspaper reported in its Tuesday editions.
   Alluding to the stepped-up pace of Central American diplomacy,
State Department spokesman Charles Redman said Monday, ``It's a very
intensive and fast-paced process that's going on.''
   Meanwhile, the fate of the Contras was the subject of a meeting
Monday in Washington between Honduran diplomats and Contra
representatives.
   A Honduran statement issued after the meeting said the meeting
was part of a process of consultations with all parties on how to
achieve both democracy in Nicaragua and the ``reintegration of the
Nicaraguan resistance into Nicaraguan society.''
   On Tuesday, United Nations officials will hold further
discussions on the creation of an international force with a mandate
to report on violations of border security in Central America.
   West Germany, Canada and Spain have agreed to provide military
personnel to the force.

   Some senior federal judges think the taxpayers
are getting a bargain from the semi-retired jurists even though
dozens accept pay raises after they stop all judicial work.
   But other senior judges are concerned _ even angry _ that
colleagues take pay boosts without working. A third group is
satisfied with current pay levels for semi-retired judges but
believes that younger, full-time judges deserve more money.
   An Associated Press survey, conducted in February and March, of
the nation's 277 senior federal judges found that 48, or 17 percent,
no longer do any judicial work. Nevertheless, they remain eligible _
and in most cases, eager _ for any pay raises granted to active
judges. The survey was undertaken because the government refuses to
release its own data on the workload of individual senior judges.
   The AP found most judges reduce their workload when they take
senior status; many give up criminal cases; some drop complicated
civil cases. Nevertheless, they handle 10 to 15 percent of the total
federal court workload, which is considered a godsend by their 750
active colleagues.

   The Bush administration is prepared to ease the
U.S. trade embargo against Nicaragua and take a number of other
conciliatory measures if that country shows it is serious about
holding fair elections next year, according to U.S. officials.
   Under such circumstances, the administration also would be
prepared to upgrade diplomatic relations with Nicaragua, including
the exchange of ambassadors, the officials said. The two countries
have not been represented at the level of ambassador in each other's
capital since last July.
   The list of possible gestures toward the Sandinista government
numbers about 20, according to the officials, who asked not to be
identified.
   Alternatively, the administration has prepared a potential list
of punitive measures of similar length if Nicaraguan opposition
forces are not given what U.S. officials perceive to be an equal
chance in the balloting, which probably will be held next February.

   Its attempt to blame leftist
rebels a failure, the military is now admitting that its troops
massacred 10 peasants in September and says nine soldiers will stand
trial in the case.
   U.S. Ambassador William Walker hailed Sunday's announcement as a
breakthrough for human rights in this country where right-wing death
squads have for so long slaughtered with impunity.
   ``The high command of the armed forces is admitting that their
earlier versions (of the massacre) have not held up under
examination and were wrong, scurrilous,'' Walker said Sunday.
   But he added that it is too early to tell if the development
signals an end to the military's traditional immunity from
prosecution in human rights cases.

   Prosecutors are preparing to try their
first case in the Defense Department purchasing scandal this month,
nearly three years after they began the coast-to-coast investigation.
   Already, a defense contracting firm, Hazeltine Corp., of
Greenlawn, N.Y., a former top executive of Unisys Corp., a former
procurement officer with the Marine Corps and seven other defense
industry figures have pleaded guilty to a variety of charges.
   U.S. Attorney Henry Hudson of the Eastern District of Virginia,
who is directing the wide-ranging case, said he is pleased with the
progress of the investigation of the $150 billion Pentagon
procurement system.
   Hudson said those pleading guilty have agreed to cooperate in the
``Operation Ill Wind'' investigation that burst into public last
June when FBI agents raided 44 locations around the country.

   The government has just published a booklet
establishing that one man's flounder is another man's eyed platefish.
   It establishes, too, that some folks who give fish their ordinary
names _ their street names, you might say _ would not make it in the
public relations business.
   Not as long as they insist on applying the name longnosed
pigfaced bream to a fish that's marketed under the noble name
emperor.
   And not if they insist on calling the grunt the brown sweetlips.
Or calling the anchovy the smig. Or the grenadier the rattail.
   Just off the government's presses is ``The Fish List: FDA Guide
to Acceptable Market Names for Food Fish Sold in Interstate
Commerce.''
   It is a compilation of the market names that the government
accepts for imported and domestically available fish sold for human
consumption.

<HEAD>Corporate Tie-Ins Lace Up a Hollywood Market</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN HORN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>HOLLYWOOD (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   This article is brought to you by Saab.
   Well, maybe not, but corporate meddling in popular culture is
reaching new levels. Promotional hooks are moving from movies,
television and sports to rock concerts, stage plays, ice shows and
even novels and board games.
   ``Power City,'' a new Hollywood book by former entertainment
industry publicist Beth Ann Herman, is sprinkled with mentions of
both Maseratis and the Rodeo Drive boutique Giorgio. But it wasn't
lifelike detail, it was marketing.
   When ``Power City'' was published, a Beverly Hills Maserati
dealer threw a $15,000 party for it, and Giorgio gave it a window
display.
   In the new L.A. Game, players move around a board in miniature
Porsches, stopping at trendy Southern California restaurants such as
Spago and stores such as L.A. Eyeworks. ``We're just a little store
on Melrose Avenue, and we just saw (the game) as the right thing to
do,'' said store spokeswoman Ruth Handel.
   ``Each company offered a fee to be on the board, anywhere from
$2,500 to $15,000, depending on its placement on the game board,''
said game creator Steve Hutchinson. ``Porsche paid $45,000 to get
its cars in the game.''
   By being featured in the glitzy ``Power City,'' Maserati can
enhance its reputation as a stylish, coveted plaything in one of its
top markets. As one character says in the book: ``It was by far his
biggest toy. His Maserati Biturbo I made life bearable in L.A.''
   ``The uniqueness of the promotion was very attractive to me,''
Michael Savod, Maserati's vice president of sales and marketing,
told Adweek magazine. Said Stan Friedman, who organized the tie-in:
``I think it did as much if not more for Maserati than for the
book.''
   Herman certainly isn't the first author to hype brand names in a
novel and glamorize products of the rich for hungry readers. Judith
Krantz, Harold Robbins and Jacqueline Susann all laced their best
sellers with enough names of cars, furniture, champagnes, designers,
jewelry and such to fill all of Rodeo Drive.
   But while entertainment-oriented promotional gimmicks can't
replace traditional advertising, they can make products stand out in
a crowded marketplace.
   ```Entertainment marketing' is becoming the phrase of the '80s.
There are so many opportunities,'' said Sam Baldoni, president of
the Baldoni Entertainment marketing firm.
   ``Sponsorship of sports has gotten so cluttered that you now move
into the next arena that's available _ entertainment,'' said Jack
MacDonough, vice president of brand management for Anheuser-Busch,
producers of the TV's ``Michelob Presents Sunday Night.''
   The beer company insists ``The night belongs to Michelob.'' On
television and in pop music concerts, it tries to prove the point.
   To make Pepsi the choice of a new generation, the soft-drink
giant has spent millions marrying the soda to pop music superstars
Gloria Estefan, Lionel Richie and Michael Jackson, whose recent
``Bad'' tour was sponsored by Pepsi. Now, it has joined MCA Home
Video in an ``E.T. The Extra-Terrestrial'' rebate deal with
promotional displays for a $5 payback in more than 60,000 stores.
There's a slick TV commercial, and a potential Pepsi cost of $55
million.
   ``We really are looking for that warm association between Pepsi
and the world's best family entertainment movie right now,'' said
Pepsi spokesman Tod MacKenzie. ``Ideally, `E.T.' and Pepsi will
become synonymous.''
   To reward ``user loyalty,'' Pinkerton Tobacco Co. will spend more
than $1 million sponsoring the Red Man Golden Blend Country Concert
Series, which will appear in 25 cities this spring. At each stop,
Pinkerton will cart out more than 150 store displays. ``In certain
situations,'' said Steve Greil, ``we might even lose a few thousand
dollars.'' But the goodwill is priceless.
   Cooperative tie-ins between two companies can be especially
cost-effective and provide instant national visibility.
   Universal Studio Tours and USAir have joined to promote
Universal's theme parks in California and Florida. ``USAir is going
to get a lot of exposure for not spending any additional money, and
we will too,'' said Gordon Armstrong, executive vice president of
corporate sponsorship for Universal Studios.
   In one of the stranger product promotions, the California
Raisins, balancing on skates, have signed on with an Ice Capades
tour. The hope is that the people who enjoy death spirals and toe
loops also hunger for dried fruit.
   ``In the ice show, the Raisins sing and dance and become
entertainers,'' said Jack Morrow, whose Applause Inc. works with
various companies to produce California Raisin memorabilia,
including pencils, Halloween costumes, lunch boxes, pajamas and
kitchenwares. ``The Raisins are cool and they're hip.''
   But corporate sponsorship does have its risks: Mick Jagger,
playing in Reebok-sponsored concerts in Australia, danced on stage
in sneakers made by Nike.

<HEAD>Palestinian Children at Forefront of Clashes with Israeli</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARY SEDOR</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>TAMOUN, Occupied West Bank (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Whenever 7-year-old Seif Hashim
spots Israeli troops approaching this West Bank village, he grabs a
rock, pulls a checkered Arab keffiyeh over his face and runs into
the street shouting, ``The army's coming!''
   Seif and his grade school friends belong to the ``Palestinian
cubs,'' a group linked to the Palestine Liberation Organization.
They set up barricades and throw stones at soldiers in the narrow
alleyways of this village 66 miles north of Jerusalem.
   ``My job is to get the soldiers if they come into the village,''
explained Seif, his big blue eyes flashing. ``There are about 45
kids in my gang. Some are older than me _ they're 8.''
   Leaning back in his chair, Seif added in a high-pitched voice
that he supported Nayef Hawatmeh's pro-Communist Democratic Front
for the Liberation of Palestine.
   ``I want to be a PLO guerrilla when I grow up,'' he said. ``Or a
dentist.'' Increasingly, Palestinian children _ some as young as 5
and 6 _ are at the forefront of violent clashes with troops in the
occupied territories. Sixty-one children 16 and younger have been
killed out of a total of about 390 since the start of the 15-month
uprising. Casualties among youngsters are on the increase, according
to United Nations figures.
   One reason for the involvement of increasingly younger children
is that many of the older youths who spearheaded protests are in
jail or in hiding from the Israeli security forces.
   The phenomenon has prompted charges from Defense Minister Yitzhak
Rabin that Palestinians are putting children in the front lines of
confrontations to win international sympathy and portray Israeli
troops as ruthless.
   ``This is the major problem Israel faces ... Palestinian
protesters surrounding themselves with kids and women at the
front,'' Rabin told visiting U.S. Jewish leaders recently.
   He said clashes with stone-throwers make up 90 percent of the
violent incidents in the West Bank and Gaza Strip. ``And 60 percent
of these involve children from the age of 6 to 14 or 15,'' Rabin
said.
   Children have participated alongside adults and older youths in
protests since the start of the Palestinian revolt. But increasingly
children _ some as young as 5 _ are taking on Israeli troops alone.
   ``The soldiers are now facing situations where the only targets
are young kids,'' said an international relief worker who declined
to be identified. ``That has changed the equation of the conflict.''
   According to U.N. figures, in the first six months of the
uprising that began in December 1987, 65 children 15 or under were
shot in the occupied Gaza Strip. By the second six months, the
number of young shooting victims had increased nearly five-fold to
307. Of the total, 21 died of their wounds in Gaza.
   In January, 61 of the 129 shooting casualties in Gaza were 15 and
under, according to the Arab-run Human Rights Information Center in
east Jerusalem. Three of the children died of their wounds.
   The center's Jan Abu Shakr estimated that hundreds of under-16
youths had been detained during the uprising but said fewer than 100
were currently held. Israeli army spokesmen stressed no one under 12
could be jailed.
   In Tamoun, Seif and about 400 boys 5 to 12 years old belong to
the cubs, which has no relation to non-violent scout groups. Each
week the children participate in anti-occupation marches,
broadcasting nationalist slogans through megaphones and carrying
outlawed Palestinian flags and pictures of PLO Chairman Yasser
Arafat through village streets.
   Children are organized by uprising leaders well aware of the
propaganda value provided by children facing heavily armed soldiers.
   ``We are teaching these kids to be active resisters,'' said
Shehad Gharaybeh, 30, a youth organizer. ``The personality of the
child is formed in the early years. These children will be stronger
than us. They are the PLO's plan for continuing the struggle.''
   ``Also, punishing children is a sensitive issue for the Israeli
army. We know that and it is something we use,'' he added.
   Two boys, 9 and 16, have been killed in Tamoun in the uprising
that began in December 1987, and 13 children have been wounded. The
youngest shooting victim was Ziad Omar Sharat, 7, a member of Seif's
cubs group, who was wounded in the arm in November.
   ``The marches are nice, but I prefer clashing with soldiers,''
said Riad Omar Mohammed Sharat, 13, brother of Ziad. ``I'm not
afraid of soldiers. They have weapons, and we have weapons. Our
weapons are firebombs and stones.''
   Shafiq Masalha, a clinical psychologist at Bir Zeit University in
the West Bank, said the children were not fully aware of the dangers
they faced.
   ``These children cannot really imagine themselves being injured
or killed,'' he said in an interview. ``They don't calculate the
risk in advance. They don't really understand the risks.''
   Seif disagrees. He said he knows what a martyr is:
   ``Being a martyr means that I was attacking the army with stones
and I was hit by a bullet. My family could not get me to the
hospital in time because the army blocked the road. So I died on the
road. Then the other boys had a march in the village for me. That's
a martyr.
   ``Afterward, you go to paradise.''

<DATELINE>RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A planned South American highway,
hailed 25 years ago as a route to progress and development, is now
making headlines as a potential opening to environmental destruction
_ even to increased cocaine trafficking.
   The 695-mile road, to link the remote western Brazilian Amazonian
state of Acre with Peru and thence to the Pacific Ocean, still does
not exist.
   Many Brazilians believe foreign forces, including President Bush,
have aligned themselves against the road. Despite denials from
Washington and elsewhere, Brazilians are telling outsiders to mind
their own business.
   They say the Acre-Peru road eventually must be built.
   The highway idea was born in 1963 when President Fernando
Belaunde of Peru announced, and started to build, the ``Marginal
Jungle Road'' on the undeveloped eastern slopes of the Andes,
connected to Lima, Peru's capital, on the Pacific. The ultimate idea
was to link the Pacific to the Atlantic by land, 3,650 miles across
South America, via Brazil.
   Brazil and Peru in 1978 signed an Amazon Cooperation Treaty in
which the road was listed as a goal. But nothing in fact was done to
build a usable highway between Rio Branco, the capital of Acre, and
the Peruvian border, 560 miles west. Peru's jungle road stopped at
Pucallpa, 135 miles from the Brazilian frontier.
   The road suddenly gained attention in February when Gov. Flaviano
Melo of Acre said he would seek Japanese financing for his side of
it. Supposedly the Japanese would be interest because it would give
them easier access to Amazon timber, a product they need.
   Previous Amazonian highways in Brazil, financed in part by the
World Bank, have led to widespread cutting and burning of the
tropical rainforest, thus aggravating the ``greenhouse effect'' and
potentially provoking major changes in the earth's climate.
   Angry headlines, such as `The Highway George Bush Doesn't Want,''
appeared in the Brazilian press. Gov. Melo, in nationwide newspaper
ads, denounced what he called the ``unacceptable aggression on the
part of foreign governments regarding internal Brazilian affairs.''
He said Acre needs an outlet to end its ``centuries-old, perverse
and unfair isolation.''
   Brazilian and Japanese diplomats later denied there was any
current plan to fund the Acre-Peru road.
   The State Department in Washington said Bush was not involved
with the highway. An official, who asked not to be named, said that
despite concerns over Amazonian deforestation, ``The U.S. government
does not have an established position on the road, and it's not even
clear there is going to be a road.''
   Still, Paulo Tarso Flecha de Lima, the No. 2 man in the Brazilian
Foreign Ministry, and Foreign Minister Guillermo Larco Cox of Peru
told a recent meeting of Amazonian countries in Quito, Ecuador, the
proposed highway is a priority development project.
   ``It is desirable and beneficial,'' Larco Cox said. ``Without
highway links, we cannot have South American unity.''
   The Brazilian Embassy in Tokyo said that although reports of
Japanese financing were untrue, the Acre-Peru Highway ``is a hope,
for the future.''
   Brazil's interior minister, Joao Alves, told The Associated
Press, ``All of a sudden Brazil is being painted as a villain,
destroying nature. This is hypocrisy. The United States and Europe
already destroyed their forests, so they shouldn't be giving us
lessons.''
   ``Brazil is a poor country. Economic development is a question of
survival,'' he added. ``We are convinced that we can achieve
development without destroying the environment.''
   Peru, despite its official stand, is not enthiastic about
completing its side of the highway.
   For one thing, the opening of jungle lands in Peru led to an
influx of peasant farmers who became successful by growing coca, the
basic ingredient of cocaine. Peru has pledged to the U.S. Drug
Enforcement Administration and other international organizations
that it will stop the spread of coca plantations.
   For another, Peru is faced with severe economic difficulties and
can't afford to finish the road, at least not now.

<HEAD>Japan's Foreign Aid: Will Spending More Really Help?</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Japan has become the world's largest donor of
foreign aid, but critics say billions of dollars will be wasted
unless it improves the way it dispenses the aid to the Third World.
   The impact of Japanese development aid on the environment also
has come under fire, the most recent example being what Tokyo
labeled incorrect reports that it would fund a highway westward
through the Brazilian rainforest to Peru and the Pacific.
   The Foreign Ministry said neither the government nor private
Japanese interests would pay for the Amazon project. But the
criticism _ voiced by environmentalists and Sen. Albert Gore Jr.,
D-Tenn. _ was an indication Japan will have to watch carefully how
it spends the huge sums earmarked for development aid.
   Japan, which itself is still repaying loans from the World Bank,
only recently increased its aid budget, helped by the doubling of
the yen's value since 1985.
   The United States, for decades the largest donor, has cut its aid
budget while Japan's official development assistance has risen
dramatically _ from $7.45 billion in 1987 to an estimated $10.95
billion in fiscal 1989, which begins April 1.
   Washington, now in second place in providing non-military aid,
spent $8.78 billion in 1987, the last year for which a breakdown of
U.S. aid is available.
   Without violating its constitutional ban on military assistance,
Japan has responded to U.S. calls to support Washington's strategic
interests, said Robert M. Orr, a foreign aid expert and professor at
the Tokyo branch of Temple University of Philadelphia.
   ``In line with U.S. policy, Japan has increased its aid to
critical areas like Pakistan, Turkey, Jamaica, El Salvador and
Honduras,'' he said.
   Officials and critics alike, however, say Japan must improve the
quality of its aid to promote stability in the Third World.
   The Development Assistance Committee of the Paris-based
Organization of Economic Cooperation and Development said in
December that Japan's projects should be more cost-effective and
avoid disrupting local communities and the environment.
   It added the Japanese should give easier terms on loans and do
more to help the poorest nations.
   Having pledged over $50 billion in aid in the five-year period
ending in 1992, Japan acknowledges difficulties in managing its aid.
   Only 1,500 personnel run the programs. The United States has more
than twice as many, and most Western donor nations have much larger
staffs relative to their aid funding.
   ``We face major problems in implementing foreign aid due to
limitations on personnel,'' said Shigeo Iwatani, Foreign Ministry
senior assistant for economic cooperation.
   ``We are gradually increasing our staff, but government hiring is
strictly limited and few specialists are available.''
   The policy of rotating officials every few years prevents the
training of aid experts, said another senior Foreign Ministry
official, speaking on condition of anonymity.
   Japan should learn from the United States, perhaps by setting up
the equivalent of the U.S. Agency for International Development and
academic programs to train aid professionals, Orr said.
   Foreign Ministry officials readily acknowledge that due to
inadequate staffing the government relies on Japanese trading
companies to identify aid projects.
   ``They have a very extensive information network. If they come up
with a good project, why should we reject it?'' the senior official
said.
   Involvement of the private sector has fueled accusations,
however, that Japan uses aid to give its businesses a foothold in
Third World markets.
   Japanese companies' share in aid contracts fell from 59 percent
in fiscal 1981 to 38 percent in fiscal 1987.
   Trading companies naturally favor lucrative contracts to build
roads, dams and bridges, but Orr said such projects shift the focus
of aid away from basic human needs.
   ``Japan doesn't make environmental impact statements, so projects
have been carried out despite environmental damage,'' he added.
   Takaaki Yasuoka of Sophia University's Institute for Social
Justice in Tokyo said Japan should share its talents and skills with
the Third World instead of building expensive projects.
   ``Japan provides aid to many countries but it's just investment,
it doesn't meet the needs of the poorest people,'' he said. ``It's
as if we have no empathy for their misery.''
   Yasuoka, who has traveled extensively to observe Japanese aid
projects, described a hospital built with Japanese money in the
African nation of Somalia.
   ``It was useless,'' he said. ``The expensive equipment couldn't
be used due to electrical outages. But there was a Chinese clinic
nearby staffed by 200 Chinese doctors and nurses. If such a poor
country can send people, we should send people, too.''
   Inadequate follow-up is another major problem that virtually
invites corruption, Yasuoka said.
   He cited a case in which the Philippine government of President
Corazon Aquino charged that seven Japanese companies participating
in aid projects paid $4.5 million in kickbacks in 1975-1976 to
then-President Ferdinand E. Marcos. The companies have denied the
allegations.
   Japan's emphasis on loans over grants _ which officials say
reflects its belief in promoting self-sufficiency _ has had the
opposite effect on some countries, Orr maintained.
   ``Yen loans are not all shiny and sweet,'' he said. ``Indonesia
is really struggling to repay its debt, most of which is in loans
from Japan. Is that development?''
   Sensitive to these charges, Japan has cut interest rates on loans
and raised the proportion of grant aid, which now stands at 60
percent of the total, compared to the U.S. ratio of 92 percent,
according to the Foreign Ministry.
   In the next fiscal year, 37 new aid officers will be hired, and
the government has pledged to improve its project identification and
assessment.
   By raising grants, Japan could increase support to schools,
clinics and agricultural and other technical training programs to
aid the poor, Orr said.
   ``The key to success is to develop a corps of trained specialists
to make sure aid works.''

<HEAD>Jackson, Democratic Leadership Council Disagree on Strategy</HEAD>
<HEAD>An AP News Analysis</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By WALTER R. MEARS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Special Correspondent</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>PHILADELPHIA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Jesse Jackson was not among allies _ anything
but. So when they lectured him on political science, he lectured
right back.
   In the resulting standoff, the edge belonged to Jackson, the
twice and future candidate for the White House.
   ``The issue is not just who leads us but who needs us,'' the
black leader from Chicago told establishment Democrats, who know
well that they badly need him to stand a chance regaining the
presidency in 1992.
   It was all quite polite, but the lines were clear at the
Democratic Leadership Council conference this past weekend. Centrist
and conservative Democrats organized the council four years ago,
after the landslide defeat of Walter F. Mondale's ticket, in an
effort to turn the party toward what they consider the voter
mainstream.
   Jackson does not accept their map of the mainstream.
   He suggested there was more to be learned about the next
presidential election on the Eastern Airlines picket lines than in a
seminar at a Philadelphia hotel.
   Jackson told the council that white airline pilots who make
$140,000 a year are on his side now because he went to their sides.
``I am one of the few people around this table who has a net gain in
white supporters,'' he told the conference of Democratic workers and
officeholders. ``I understand how to get white votes.''
   Jackson and the Democratic Leadership Council stand on opposite
sides in the argument over a route back from five defeats in the
past six presidential elections.
   After a campaign in which Republicans made the word ``liberal''
into a political curse, most of the Democrats at the Philadelphia
conference want a change in the message and a move toward the
middle. Jackson insists that the party can win by mobilizing its own
constituency and sticking to its own message.
   The council called in a political science professor for advice
and he said the problem is with swing voters, not with turnout.
William A. Galston of the University of Maryland said if everyone
eligible had voted in 1988, President Bush would have been elected
by an even wider margin.
   ``Democratic support is hemorrhaging in the heart of the
electorate,'' said Sen. Sam Nunn of Georgia. Sen. Charles S. Robb of
Virginia said Democrats have to win back the middle class, and can't
afford the ``us against them'' perception he said has taken hold.
   Galston said that to have a chance, the 1992 nominee ``must be
fully credible as commander in chief,'' must respond to the majority
of voters who favor the death penalty and a generally tougher stance
on crime, and must reassure the middle class.
   Jackson listened politely, but if there had been an exam on the
Galston lecture, he would have flunked.
   He offered his summation outside the conference room: ``If we are
all things to all people, we become rather ill-defined, indecisive,
kind of like warm spit.''
   At least Jackson was there, listening and talking to Democrats
who know that his power will remain their problem. He ran first in
13 states and second in 33 in contests for Democratic delegates in
1988, and he shows no signs of slowing.
   Nunn said that despite their differences, ``I also acknowledge
him to be one of the people in the country who has the largest
following ... and the people who support him are an extremely
important element in the Democratic Party.''
   Important enough that none of the establishment Democrats picked
a real fight over Jackson's stance back home in Chicago, where he is
supporting a third-party black candidate against Richard M. Daley,
the Democratic nominee for mayor.
   Robb did mention it, saying Jackson's refusal to support the
primary winner could be a problem for him in 1992. Jackson insists
that the presidential primary elections and party caucuses should
choose Democratic presidential nominees, without intervention by
party leaders.
   ``Let the primary process determine the winner'' in 1992, Jackson
said in Philadelphia.
   But in discussing the Chicago race, Jackson said he had supported
Daley twice in other elections, and ``he's not endorsed me once.''
   ``You should support people who support you,'' Jackson said,
noting that some of those who criticize him now have refused to
support black nominees in the past. ``What is sacred are
relationships, honorable, reciprocal relationships. What is sacred
is not the primary.''
   That's a line that may be replayed when presidential primaries
are again the issue.

   Pat Sajak says he judges the success of his
new late-night talk show not by the ratings but by the happy faces
of CBS big shots.
   ``You can drive yourself crazy looking at the ratings numbers
every day and comparing yourself to everyone else,'' said Sajak. ``I
mainly go by the CBS executives. If they smile and stay out of our
way, I know things are going well.''
   CBS executives have a lot to smile about. ``The Pat Sajak Show''
made its debut Jan. 9, and things are going very well.
   Sajak, of course, is not giving Johnny Carson of NBC's ``Tonight
Show'' anything to worry about and probably never will. But that's
not the point, and never was. The biggest fallacy about late-night
programming is the assumption that you're failing miserably if
you're not beating Carson, or at least breathing down his neck.
   The bugbear Sajak had to overcome was previous late-night
programming on CBS, a hodgepodge of original shows, reruns and
movies. Not only were CBS ratings trailing far behind Carson and
ABC's ``Nightline,'' but many affiliate stations were also dumping
the shows to run their own.
   The rating for the CBS late-night shows in December was 3.3,
while Carson had 5.5 and ``Nightline'' 4.9. In its debut week, Sajak
outdistanced all the competition. Part of that was due to curiosity.
   After two months, Sajak's ratings have leveled off and the show
now runs behind Carson by at least two ratings points. In the last
ratings week, Carson had a rating of 5.7, ``Nightline'' 5.3 and
Sajak 3.4. In the February sweeps, Carson got a 5.6 rating, Sajak
3.5.
   The good news is that the ratings are ahead of the previous
late-night programming.
   ``I feel very good about where we are now,'' Sajak said in a
telephone interview. ``I don't want to sound self-satisfied or smug,
but I like the look of the show. We're going through an evolutionary
process. We don't have meetings and say let's change this or that.
But a year down the road we can look at our shows and say they're
different.
   ``As for the ratings, I really don't keep up with them. They go
up, they go down. After the first few weeks to make sure people were
watching, I stopped checking. We're just out to improve what CBS had
in this time slot before. We're starting a talk show from scratch.
We're not taking viewers away from Johnny Carson, but we are
attracting people who previously haven't been watching network
late-night shows.''
   Meanwhile, Carson renewed his contract with NBC for another year.
``I'm having a ball,'' Carson told NBC Entertainment President
Brandon Tartikoff. It will be Carson's 28th year as host of ``The
Tonight Show.''
   Sajak said he is not trying to break new ground. ``I've said many
times we're out to do a strong, traditional talk show,'' he said.
``I don't think there's anything we should be doing that we're not
doing. We've tried some things that haven't worked, like asking
people in the audience about their worst date. But our out-of-studio
stuff has worked great.''
   The Sajak show is seen on 195 stations. Some defecting CBS
stations have returned to the fold, but a few, like Detroit and
Atlanta, do not carry the show. In those cities, the Sajak show is
broadcast by independent stations. Sajak has 95 percent of the CBS
stations, while Carson has 99 percent of the NBC stations.
   Sajak still goes to NBC on weekends to tape ``Wheel of Fortune,''
but he said he has not run into Carson. Both Carson and David
Letterman, whose NBC late-night show is against the last half-hour
of ``The Pat Sajak Show,'' wished Sajak well when he launched his
show.

   EDITOR'S NOTE _ Geraldo Rivera figures he's the most scrutinized
person on national TV, and he may be right. He likes to think of
himself as an innovator, and he's certainly that. Whatever one
thinks of the controversial talk show host, ``Geraldo'' has a
growing following, capitalizing on an age-old fascination with
criminals, deviants and misfits.

<TEXT>
   We come to you today from the stage at Times
Square Studios in Manhattan, where we'll be bringing you one of the
most provocative pop culture phenomena of our time.
   Geraldo Rivera has been called the ``P.T. Barnum of talk show
hosts'' and ``the Peck's Bad Boy of television news.''
   ``People'' magazine called him ``insufferable.'' The Washington
Post denounced his last special as ``teleporn.'' Los Angeles Times
critic Howard Rosenberg says he doesn't believe a thing he sees
Geraldo do.
   Tell us briefly, Geraldo, in your own words: What is it about you
that so affronts so many in your profession?
   ``I think envy and jealousy plays a part. There's a feeling that
I somehow gypped my way to the top. I've gone too far, gotten too
big. I've defied all their notions. I should've failed a dozen times
by now.''
   He should have failed, but in the 19 years since his television
debut, he has earned more than 150 prizes, including three Emmys and
a Peabody, and his popularity with viewers has never flagged.
   ``The thing about Geraldo is that he's passionate about what he
does,'' says Suzanne Falter-Barns, a free-lance writer in the
audience during a recent studio taping of his syndicated daily talk
show, ``Geraldo.''
   ``There's no passion on TV anymore. Everything is canned,
processed, fake entertainment. Geraldo's show is kind of
fascinatingly morbid. Because it's so dark, you get to experience a
little of your own darkness.''
   Not so, says critic Tom Shales of The Washington Post. ``He's an
emotional cheerleader who tries to sway audiences in a very facile
and sleazy way. I call him The Great Panderer because he keeps
searching for cheaper, more sordid, more sensational topics. At best
he is embarrassing.''
   Despite the reviews, the Investigative News Group he formed in
1986 with his wife, brother and one employee has grown to 30 people.
With Tribune Entertainment, it produces his live specials and his
talk show. The fastest-growing program in syndication, ``Geraldo''
jumped 67 percent in the national Nielsen ratings over the past
year, capitalizing on an age-old fascination with criminals,
deviants and misfits.
   Geraldo also is developing a weekly series, ``The
Investigators,'' and has just announced plans to buy up TV stations
with five other prominent Hispanics.
   Yet he remains the punch line to an industry joke: Heard about
the Geraldo Rivera Home Game? A life-size cardboard cutout of
Geraldo and a folding chair.
   He's a target of everyone from cartoonist Garry Trudeau to Johnny
Carson, and Johnny's nights off bring no reprieve. ``Tonight Show''
guest host Jay Leno finds him equally hilarious.
   Geraldo's law degree has proven invaluable. Much of his career
has been spent defending himself against charges of distorting the
news; of using drugs; of denying his heritage by calling himself
``Jerry Rivers'' or, conversely, of changing his name to Geraldo
Rivera to cash in on ethnic hiring trends.
   He pleads innocent to all counts.
   ``I'm the most scrutinized person on national TV. Everything I
say, everything I do, is X-rayed nine ways to Sunday.
   ``No story is worth a career. Not only is my own honor at stake
but it's the knowledge that everything I do is examined.''
   He's convinced that the fuss concerns style, not substance, and
that one day, ``some biographer _ probably someone not yet born _
will show me as a person who brought innovation to television.''
   The Geraldo style _ explosive, confrontational, the antithesis of
the detatched professional _ mirrors his off-camera personality.
Long after the guests have gone home, Geraldo is still ``Geraldo,''
a Hispanic Dudley Do-Right, a real-life Equalizer. Other men walk
the dog. Geraldo ``patrols the bowels of Central Park'' with a black
Labrador named Spike.
   ``These are not postures,'' he says. He wishes he could wear a
sincerity meter.
   ``It was always there _ the self-assuredness, the cockiness,''
says Marty Berman, executive producer of ``Geraldo.'' They met at
New York's WABC-TV, which persuaded Geraldo to trade poverty law for
the ``Eyewitness News.''
   Berman became his film editor in 1970. ``Nobody else wanted to
work with him.'' Not only was he arrogant, Berman says, ``he was
fearless. He'd walk into a shooting gallery in the Bronx like you'd
walk into a coffee shop. He's still very difficult, very demanding.
But now he's running a grown-up organization.''
   C.C. Dyer, a ``Geraldo'' producer, is his fourth wife _ ``fourth
and final,'' Geraldo says. The one-time notorious womanizer has
finally removed the sign that had long been a fixture on his bedroom
door: ``Abandon hope all ye who enter here.'' For the first time
he's wearing a ring.
   Geraldo is warmer in person than he seems on TV. He laughs more
and pontificates less, and he's forever trying to get people to eat.
He seems happiest when they do.
   He is half Puerto Rican and half Jewish, one of five children of
Lilly Friedman and Cruz Rivera, cafeteria workers who married over
her parents' objections. He speaks fondly of his mother, who lives
in a house he bought her in Florida, and reverentially of his
father, who died in 1987.
   ``My mom is very stereotypical, very Jewish, very oy-vey. My
father was a very loving, sensitive, vulnerable Hispanic gentleman.''
   Geraldo grew up in a blue-collar section of Long Island, ``a
social politician.'' His compulsion to prove himself is rooted in
childhood: ``When I fought, I was proving myself to the street kids.
When I did well in school, I was proving myself to the smart kids.''

   He threw in his lot with the smart kids after he got caught
stealing tires off an Oldsmobile. ``My father was so ashamed he
couldn't look me in the eye.'' Suddenly, making his father proud
became important.
   He's now a proud father himself, of a 9-year-old son by his third
marriage. Gabriel Rivera lives in California with his mother. He and
Geraldo spend every other weekend and all summer together.
   Geraldo hopes to have another child. He and C.C. live in
Manhattan but are house-hunting upstate. They started after a
pregnant doctor was murdered at Bellevue Hospital. ``I said, this is
too much.''
   Of course, the ``Geraldo'' show, with its lineup of neo-Nazis,
hookers, and adolescent murderers, isn't exactly a romp in the park.
   ``Geraldo is good people, but I don't know how long I'll be able
to do this,'' says Alexander Johnson, a thoughtful young producer
who's screening hours of kiddie porn for an upcoming show.
   Geraldo understands. Too many seamy stories and ``the world
becomes a place held together with wire hangers, spit and chewing
gum. That's not an accurate view of the world. But some of it sticks
to you, even after the shower.''
   He tries to end every show with solutions, and occasionally, he
serves up lighter fare. Nudists, female mud-wrestlers atuff on ``Geraldo.''
   Still, ``it's impossible not to take the job away from the
studio. The more I hurt, the more I feel. That's our edge. It's a
net positive.''
   He makes no apology for crying on camera, a habit that dates back
to his early days at WABC where, less than two years into the job
there, he tackled the biggest story of his life. He shed many tears
before he was done.
   It began with a call from Dr. Michael Wilkins, an acquaintance
who had just been fired by Willowbrook State School on Staten
Island, then the nation's largest institution for the mentally
retarded.
   ``He had a key. He knew what time the guards changed, when I
could get inside. I asked what I would find. He said, `Children
being abused.'''
   That night, Wilkins accompanied Geraldo and a cameraman to
Willowbrook, where they filmed five minutes inside one of the 30-odd
buildings. Then the cameraman went outside and threw up.
   ``Geraldo said, `I am not going to give this up. I am going to
come back and come back and come back until this is cleaned up,'''
Wilkins recalls.
   Fifteen years and countless stories later, Willowbrook closed.
   ``I hear him getting panned, but I can only relate to him as I
knew him,'' says Wilkins, now in private practice in Kansas City, Mo.
   ``I do see that same spark that I think is a person with a
Gibraltar of integrity and a feeling that he has a mission other
than self-aggrandizement. I do think that. Otherwise I would be
angry.''
   Geraldo's reporting on Willowbrook won him the George Foster
Peabody Award and catapulted him to the ABC network. He joined the
entertainment division, then the staff of ``20@20.''
   ``I remember Willowbrook like it was two minutes ago, like I
remember my father's death. I still have nightmares about the smell,
the sound. It was the most dramatic thing that ever happened to me.
It is the happiest circumstance of my life that changing the world
is what made me successful.''
   It was also what had drawn him to journalism in the first place.
At Columbia University School of Journalism, where WABC sent him for
a crash course, he came to regard reporting as a vehicle for change.
   Among his professors was Fred Friendly. ``He impressed me with
the nobility, the morality,'' says Geraldo. ``Journalism was bigger
than `Clark Kent' big. It was `Paul Revere' big.''
   He never wanted to be Tom Brokaw. He wanted to bring grim
reality, not pin-striped sensibility, to the small screen. He became
the ``ghetto-crime-punishment'' reporter. ``I was always
staggeringly self-confident in street situations,'' he says with his
usual modesty.
   The swagger survives, along with arrogance, passion and pride _
``my fatal flaw,'' he concedes.
   It was that pride that cost him his network job in 1985. Roone
Arledge pulled a ``20@20'' segment on Marilyn Monroe's relationship
with the Kennedys, and Geraldo threw a tantrum. A less impulsive man
might have stopped to consider that he had not yet signed his new
contract before publicly mouthing off at the boss.
   ``I died of massive, mostly self-inflicted wounds,'' he wrote in
the April 1986 issue of ``Esquire.''
   His obituary was premature. He soon attempted a comeback as a
free-lancer with ``The Mystery of Al Capone's Vault.''
   The gangster's vault, opened with much fanfare on live
television, came up empty. Mortified, Geraldo went into hiding,
setting off on what was to be an epic voyage aboard his 44-foot
sloop, the ``New Wave.''
   He came ashore in a hurry after learning that ``Al Capone's
Vault'' was the highest-rated nationally syndicated show of all time.
   Five specials and one talk show later, he is philosophical about
the career turn that has made him more of an outsider than ever. He
isn't exactly unhappy. But neither is he free of regret.
   ``Ideally, I want to be sorting through the ashes, trying to find
truth. I'd like to be challenging institutional politics, or
reporting on the budget deficit or the Middle East.
   ``But a lot of what I'm doing is really righteous stuff. They
won't remember me for the Chippendales or prostitution. They are
going to remember me for the stories that made a difference.''
   He remains unrepentant about his most recent thrashing by the
critics, over a ``Geraldo'' episode in which his nose was broken by
a flying chair. A former boxer, he maintains it was ``a righteous
fight.''
   The front-page headline of the Nov. 4 New York Post _ ``Geraldo
Bloodied in TV Riot''_ hangs in his office. So does the key to
Willowbrook.

   EDITOR'S NOTE _ Whiskey is the lifeblood of Lynchburg, Tenn., a
true one-company town, the town that Jack built _ Jack Daniel.
Practically everyone in all of Moore County, in fact, owes their
livelihood to that venerable distillery. But to buy a bottle of
their favorite liquor, they have to drive to nearby Coffee County.

<DATELINE>LYNCHBURG, Tenn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Moore County Chamber of Commerce has
no office, no telephone. All of its documents reside in one thin
file folder on a closet shelf in Miss Mary Bobo's Boarding House.
   Lynne Tolley, the chamber's current president and also the
boarding house hostess, shrugs.
   ``We don't really go after new industries,'' she says. ``Oh, if
somebody asks we answer. But we're not looking. Not a bit.''
   In chambers of commerce across America, of course, such a
viewpoint borders on heresy. But in this corner of the remote and
rolling foothills of the Cumberland mountains in Middle Tennessee,
the consensus seems to be that one industry is sufficient. Whiskey.
   Lynchburg, the Moore County seat, is the home of the Jack Daniel
distillery.
   In warehouses atop the ridge above Jack Daniel's hollow _ or
holler as it is pronounced hereabouts _ 47 million gallons of
Tennessee sippin' whiskey reside in charred oak barrels, aging. The
ripe stuff is bottled daily and new barrels filled.
   To the people of Lynchburg and Moore County, that is quite a
reservoir of security.
   There are in America one-industry towns, so-called, where the
economy relies heavily on a dominant employer. But a researcher
would be hard put to find another place in the nation where the
population of an entire county depends for its livelihood, directly
or indirectly, on a single industry, and, as industries go, not a
very large one at that. Jack Daniel's work force runs about 350.
   ``Ten years ago,'' says Moore County Judge Donald Ray, ``I would
have said dependence on the distillery was 100 percent. Now it is
somewhat less, but not much. Some people who live in Moore County
now work in adjoining counties. There are only so many jobs to go
around.
   ``But without Jack Daniel's the county would be in a terrible
situation. Every family in Moore County that has been here a long
time has some member or close relative involved with Jack Daniel's,
if only as a pensioner.''
   Today Moore County _ 131 square miles, all hilly, with a
population of 4,510, or about 34 souls per square mile _ has only
one center of commerce, Lynchburg.
   The city and county government are one. The county has no doctor,
no lawyer, no railroad, no interstate highway, no river, no motel.
It has one post office, one state park, one bait shop, one
undertaker, one pool hall and one traffic light, which, according to
the sheriff, is where most accidents happen because people don't
seem to have the hang of having to stop and wait.
   Jack Daniel's influence extends far beyond the distillery's
studiously quaint buildings and stone fences and crystal-clear
creek, beyond its payroll and pensions, even beyond the pint of
whiskey that goes with every employee's paycheck on the first Friday
of every month, Good Friday as it is known here.
   Every cash register in Lynchburg benefits mightily from the
300,000 tourists a year the distillery draws, but it doesn't stop
there.
   Back in the hills, for example, every farmer relies exclusively
on the distillery's mash byproduct, called slop, for cattle feed.
``The thin soil in these hills won't grow row crops,'' says Ray.
``All it will produce is cattle.''
   With few exceptions, though, the populace appears more than
content with its lot, and why not?
   Unemployment is lower than any adjacent county and per capita
income, at $15,928, among the highest in rural Tennessee. And
because the distillery has been here through good times and bad
since 1866, nobody has the least fear that Jack Daniel's will ever,
figuratively speaking, go on the rocks.
   Back when Reagor Motlow, the grand-nephew of Jack Daniel himself,
was president of the company, his promise was that anyone in Moore
County who wanted a job could have one at the distillery. He lived
up to that. He also said anyone who didn't want a job was welcome to
leave the county. There's that, too.
   ``There is that,'' says Ray. ``But in all my time in Moore County
I have never known the distillery to throw its weight around or
interfere in any election or any county decision. Not so much as a
speeding ticket.''
   But there is also the experience of 1985. That was long after
Reagor Motlow's death and long after he and his three brothers, in
1956, sold the company to the huge Brown-Forman distillery in
Louisville, Ky. It was the year Jack Daniel's laid off one-fifth of
its work force. The reason given was an increase in federal taxes
which the company by itself couldn't meet.
   There is no evidence that Brown-Forman has interfered in Jack
Daniel's policies. ``They know better than to kick a pulling mule,''
said one longtime employee, Roger Brashears. But for the past four
years there has existed in Lynchburg an uncommon element of
uncertainty.
   And back in the hills, cattle raisers dependent on that
high-protein slop are uneasy because of a study the company made in
1984, just before the layoffs, when it was looking for new revenue.
   It showed that a drying process many distillers use to recover
spent mash would allow the company to sell it on the open market for
nearly 10 times what it makes distributing the wet product to local
farmers who come by and pick it up themselves.
   These are undercurrents in an otherwise tranquil sea.
   The company keeps the same low-key image locally as it reflects
in its magazine ads _ just country folks doing unhurried work in a
``tiny little town where things don't seem to have changed very
much.''

   Lynchburg has stayed at a steady population of about 600 for
years. The visitors actually do see old-timers in bib overalls
sitting on benches around the town square, whittling, swapping coon
dogs from the back of pickup trucks. They are not company props.
   On the square, the Lynchburg Hardware and General Store and the
White Rabbit Saloon are two main tourist attractions. Both are owned
by the distillery and neither is what it says it is.
   Lem Motlow, Jack Daniel's nephew, heir and successor, the father
of Reagor Motlow, built the general store in 1921. Old-timey wares
from that era, horse collars and salves and such, still decorate its
shelves and walls but they are not for sale. Coca Cola is, for 10
cents, in a bottle. The only items the store sells in earnest are
Jack Daniel souvenirs.
   As for the saloon, it too has kept its old-fashioned decor. It
serves sandwiches and lemonade. It hasn't sold anything stronger
since 1909 when Tennessee went dry, 11 years before Prohibition.
   The irony is that Lynchburg, the town that Jack built, and all of
Moore County, is still dry. (Well, so is most of Bourbon County,
Ky.) The nearest liquor store from here is in nearby Coffee County _
yes, Coffee _ and anyone in bib overalls on the square will tell you
the door of that store is at a distance from Lynchburg of 12.3 miles
and 14 steps.
   Jack Daniel's also owns Miss Mary Bobo's Boarding House, just off
the square. It is a charming old white-columned home which dates
from 1867. But it is not a boarding house, not since Miss Mary's
death, at age 102, six years ago.
   Yet it contributes much to Lynchburg's down-home mystique. Rather
than let it go to ruin Jack Daniel's bought it. Lynne Tolley, a
great-grand niece of Jack Daniel himself, serves noonday dinner
there to 65 guests daily _ Southern fare, of course: fried okra,
cheese grits, vegetables from the garden out back. Iced tea.
   If such operations can be assigned to Jack Daniel's advertising
budget, other benefactions seem as pure as the iron-free water that
gushes out of Cave Spring at a constant temperature of 56 degrees
year-round, which is why Uncle Jack, as he is known to one and all
in Moore County, built his distillery here in the first place.
   The Lynchburg library, as modern and well-stocked as any in an
affluent American suburb, was a gift of the Motlow family. So was
the land for the Motlow State Junior college, the county's only
institution of higher learning. The county's only ambulance was a
gift of the distillery. So was its fire truck.
   It was the distillery that matched a $260,000 federal grant for
the sewer system. When the county courthouse was falling down in
1968 the distillery rebuilt it.
   ``They do things like that all the time without making a fuss
about it,'' says Carl Payne, the Moore County executive. ``If the
high school needs something it can't handle, like band uniforms or
whatever, they go to the distillery and somebody writes a check.''
   Jobs at the distillery are the most coveted in the county. At the
retirement party for one old-timer, Herb Fanning, it was discovered
that he hadn't taken a vacation in 20 of his 33 years at Jack
Daniel's. ``Since you do for a living what most people would pay to
do he said, why should you go on vacation and pay not to do it.''
   Another longtime employee, Clarence Rolman, 86, said, ``They pay
good and if they've got a job for one hand they usually put two on
it.''
   Rural colloquialisms abound in Moore County, which is about as
rural as you can get.
   Lynchburg is its only incorporated city. A dozen or so
``communities'' nestle in the county's hills and hollows _ Turkey
Creek, Charity, Buckeye, Possum Trot, Owl Hollow, Marble Hill _ some
of which in the long ago had maybe a one-room schoolhouse, maybe a
store, a church, a cemetery.
   In the old days, Uncle Jack built many of those churches, of
whatever sect, and saw to the upkeep of the cemeteries. His
benevolence became a tradition.
   Talk about rural. Many small towns in America boast that their
citizens don't bother to lock their doors. In Moore County they
don't even bother to lock the jail.
   ``Almost 100 percent of our crimes are committed by someone from
out of the county,'' says Sheriff Mark Logan, whose father and uncle
were sheriff before him.
   ``We have a state park with a big lake. Some people who go there
get into burglaries, into drunk driving, into auto theft, into drugs.
   ``But within the county we don't have many problems. I pulled up
a few marijuana plants last year but that's about it. No, I don't
know of any moonshine stills, although my father busted a few.''
   Logan, incidentally, leaves the keys in his patrol car overnight.
   ``When there is crime in Moore County,'' says Ray, ``it is
usually of a personal nature and the families resolve it among
themselves. Nobody files a lawsuit or tries to get anybody arrested.
   ``The people in our communities are so in touch with one another
and with their pattern of life it would be difficult, foolish
really, for someone to commit a crime. If a strange car should pass
down one of those back roads, the sheriff will get a call.
   ``We don't necessarily raise perfect citizens. It's just that any
of our citizens who would normally get in trouble in Moore County go
elsewhere to do it.''
   The area's serene hills and uncluttered blacktop roads are
alluring to many of the visitors who come to see the distillery.
   ``Every weekend during the summer,'' says Carl Payne, the county
executive, three or four people will stop in and ask me about land
for sale for a retirement place. Quite a few from other states have
retired here.''
   Because of its remoteness, it's also small wonder the chamber of
commerce doesn't bother to try to lure new industries.
   ``We don't really want anything that would change the nature of
Moore County, or at least I don't,'' says Payne. ``I want our peace
and quiet and clear streams and clean air to stay just the way they
are.''
   ``What we do need, and our tourists need,'' he adds with a sigh,
``is a place where you can buy a drink.''

   This remote corner of the Cumberland
hills is not a likely place for major industries to want to locate.
And the way Jack Daniel's distillery happened to get here is not apt
to be repeated.
   Jasper Newton ``Jack'' Daniel was born in 1846, the last of 10
children. When he was six his widowed father, hard pressed, sent him
off to live with a neighbor, Dan Call. Call ran a store on Louse
Creek and needed an apprentice for his black slave, Nearest Green,
who was a superb maker of the store's most prominent product,
whiskey.
   Dan Call was also a preacher.
   When Jack Daniel was 14 a traveling evangelist named Lady Love
borrowed Dan Call's pulpit and told Dan's congregation that their
pastor had better decide whether to preach or make whiskey because
in the eyes of the Lord he couldn't do both.
   Jack bought Dan's still, on credit, and went in business.
   When the Civil War ended he moved his still a few miles to a
lovely spring outside Lynchburg, brought with him Nearest Green's
son, George, and prospered.
   A new federal law in 1866 required all distilleries to register
with government tax collectors and Jack Daniel's became the nation's
first. It is celebrated as a national historic site as America's
oldest registered distillery.

   EDITOR'S NOTE _ Hollywood insiders are betting that ``Rain Man''
will dominate this week's Oscar presentations, but there are no
clear-cut favorites for several acting awards. So, unlike last year,
there is considerable suspense in this year's Kentucky Derby of
filmdom.

   America's film industry honors its own at the
61st Academy Awards on Wednesday night, and it's likely that ``Rain
Man'' will make a big splash.
   Leading the field with eight nominations, the cross-country
odyssey of two disparate brothers appears to be the favorite to
capture the best picture Oscar, with Dustin Hoffman the front-runner
for best actor and Barry Levinson for best director.
   ``Rain Man'' has the double advantage of being generally (but not
unanimously) praised by the critics and embraced by the public ($122
million gross in 80 days).
   The other major categories look as unpredictable as a horse race
for 2-year-olds. Critics' awards have been scattered over a wide
field, providing no hint as to favorites.
   The uncertainty of the outcome should add excitement to Wednesday
night's telecast, in contrast to last year's no-surprise awards. The
event returns to the Shrine Auditorium despite the wave of protest
over traffic gridlock and poor sound a year ago. The Los Angeles
police and the sound engineers have promised to do better.
   The Academy also seems resolved to restore glamour to the Oscar
presentations. Producer Allan Carr (``La Cage aux Folles'') will
stage the awards ``like a Broadway show,'' with Marvin Hamlisch
providing the downbeat in the orchestra pit. After 17 years of
directing the awards, Marty Pasetta has been replaced by Jeff
Margolis, who has attracted good ratings with the American Music
Awards show.
   The Oscarcast will have no emcee. Instead, a bevy of ``couples,
companions, co-stars and compadres'' will present the awards. Among
them: Demi Moore and Bruce Willis; Melanie Griffth and Don Johnson;
Kim Novak and James Stewart; Sammy Davis Jr. and Gregory Hines;
Goldie Hawn and Kurt Russell; Farrah Fawcett and Ryan O'Neal; Bo
Derek and Dudley Moore; Kiefer and Donald Sutherland.
   The nominees for best picture _ ``The Accidental Tourist,''
``Dangerous Liaisons,'' ``Mississippi Burning,'' ``Rain Man,''
``Working Girl'' _ offer a wide range of subject matter. But they
have one thing in common: All were released last December.
   This has brought renewed claims that movies released earlier in
the year have less chance of winning Hollywood's big prize. History
seems to bear that out. Since 1934, when films became eligible on a
calendar-year basis, 18 December releases have won as best picture.
The tally: November, 9; October, 5; September, 4; August, 3; July, 3.
   Only 11 movies released in the first six months of the year have
been picked as the best. Interestingly, the only January release to
take the top prize was the classic ``Casablanca,'' first seen in Los
Angeles on Jan. 2, 1943. (For Oscar eligibility, a film must play at
least one week in an L.A. theater.)
   Academy president Richard Kahn offers an explanation: ``The major
serious films are traditionally released in the last three months of
the year. Summer is now reserved for lighthearted, escapist
entertainment. That's the way movies are dealt out to the public.
   ``That doesn't mean that movies released earlier in the year
don't have a chance as best picture. `The Godfather' came out in
March. `Annie Hall' was an April release.'' Other early releases:
``The Sound of Music'' (March); ```Patton'' (February). But 11 of
the last 17 best-picture winners were released in November or
December.
   ``There's no question that a year-end release enhances the
possibility of Oscars,'' observes publicist Booker McClay, who has
conducted campaigns for ``E.T. The Extra-Terrestrial,'' ``Out of
Africa'' and this year's ``Gorillas in the Mist'' for Universal
Pictures.
   ``At the end of the year, Academy voters may have 30 pictures to
see. They are much more likely to be attracted to the new movies
than to return to those they have seen early in the year. It's hard
to generate interest in movies that were released eight or nine
months earlier. You have to book a theater on the west side, so the
film is available to Academy members. Meanwhile the new releases are
attracting all the excitement.''
   McClay cited ``E.T.'' as ``a classic example of a picture that
came out too early. It was released in June of 1982 and unanimously
hailed. It did fabulous business and seemed a cinch to win the Oscar.
   ``But six months later, big campaigns focused on the new
pictures. `Gandhi' was given an $18-million marketing budget. It was
heavily screened, and everything was centered on the Gandhi theme,
making it seem like something more than a spectacular film. The
result: `E.T.' did not win.''
   John Flinn, who has conducted Academy publicity campaigns for MGM
and Paramount, agrees. ``It's much tougher to promote a picture
released early in the year,'' he says. ``The December pictures have
all the ad strength and publicity behind them, and Academy members
are naturally affected.''
   McClay adds: ``Studios are on the horns of a dilemma. If they
hold an important film until December, they are faced with interest
charges. If they release the picture too early, they lessen chances
of an award.''
   But, given the eternal lure of the Oscar and the ego satisfaction
involved, chances are that Academy hopefuls will continue crowding
into Los Angeles theaters during the month of December.

   It's a wretched year for predicting who will
win the Oscars, but somebody's got to do it.
   This most unrewarding of endeavors is made more difficult by the
absence of a groundswell for any of the major contenders. Excuses
aside, here's one Oscar watcher's view of the 61st race for the gold:
   Best Picture _ ``Rain Man.'' Not an overwhelming favorite with
the Academy crowd, but it has the luster of a winner.
   Best Actor _ Dustin Hoffman, ``Rain Man.'' A unique portrayal.
   Best Actress _ It could be any of the five, but the voters do
like newcomers. Melanie Griffith, ``Working Girl.''
   Best Supporting Actor _ Martin Landau, ``Tucker: The Man and His
Dream.'' An acting gem in a flawed film.
   Best Supporting Actress _ Frances McDormand, ``Mississippi
Burning.'' A slight favorite in a wide-open race.
   Best Director _ Barry Levinson, ``Rain Man.''

   EDITOR'S NOTE _ Along with their goat, the midshipmen of the U.S.
Naval Academy are proud defenders of their cows. Cows? Yes, as the
young men and women prepare for a career at sea, they consume
veritable oceans of fresh, rich milk, all produced at the academy's
own farm. Even some West Point cadets concede that the Navy has them
licked in the dairy department.

<TEXT>
   Almost 80 years after a typhoid outbreak
made officials wary of the local milk supply, the U.S. Naval Academy
is still running its own dairy to put milk on the midshipmen's
tables.
   The cows don't graze on this picture-book campus by the Severn
River, but down the road a few miles is the 865-acre U.S. Naval
Academy Farm which they share with Bill the Goat, the middies'
long-horned mascot.
   The fresh, rich milk they produce is much in evidence in King
Hall, the cavernous wardroom or dining hall where the entire
4,500-member brigade takes its meals. They empty nearly 2,500 of the
blue-and-gold, half-gallon cartons daily.
   But there haven't been any typhoid epidemics in trendy Annapolis
lately, so why is the academy still milking its own cows?
   ``I guess tradition,'' says Todd Dander, 21, a second classman
from Dallas. ``That's what everything is around here _ tradition.''
   Several others speculated that it was cheaper for the academy to
get its milk from the source, bypassing the middleman.
   But the civilians who run the $950,000-a-year farm, where they
milk 175 to 250 Holsteins and raise 250 calves, don't claim to be
underpricing the competition. They acknowledge the staff of 16 is
larger than typically found on a dairy farm of similar size, but
they insist that they are only milking cows, not taxpayers.
   The dairy is self-sufficient, relying on sales to the
Midshipmen's Mess, not federal appropriations, says R.H. ``Pete''
Peterson, who has run the farm since 1982, first as a Navy
lieutenant commander and, since retiring in 1984, as the civilian
farm manager.
   He bristles at any suggestion the naval dairy is a white elephant
or, as a recent newspaper headline suggested, a prime candidate
``for the budget ax.''
   And, like many great events n naval warfare, academy officials
point out that this battle has been fought before _ and the middies'
dairy won a decisive engagement.
   The battle erupted in 1966 when the Department of Defense, faced
with complaints from Maryland and Virginia milk producers, suggested
shutting the dairy and selling the farm.
   But the House Armed Services Committee rose to the defense of the
middies' milk supply, and determined that if the farm were sold, the
money would revert not to the U.S. Treasury, but to the Midshipmen's
store fund, which lent $25,000 to start the dairy in Annapolis in
1911. Two years later, Congress lent $155,000 to buy the property in
Gambrills, Md., 13 miles from the academy.
   ``Some bright genius ... wants to close this dairy over at
Annapolis. This will be done over my prostrate body,'' the late Rep.
L. Mendel Rivers, D-S.C., the autocratic committee chairman, barked
at a hearing in October 1966.
   ``We have developed a grade of milk over there that is wonderful,
absolutely wonderful ...,'' declared Rivers. ``There is no reason to
dispose of this property, no reason on earth. It is owned by the
young men over there.''
   None of the 16 people who staff the farm is a civil servant. All
except a secretary live on the farm, where the workday for the
milkers and herders begins before dawn.
   ``Because it's not a self-owned operation where you work until
you drop, we have more employees than a farm this size would take in
a private, commercial operation,'' says Peterson, a former supply
officer looking every bit the farmer in well-worn jeans, boots,
plaid shirt and Dekalb cap.
   The Midshipmen's Mess orders 1,282 gallons a day, paying $1.66
for each gallon of the 2 percent butterfat milk. The dairy also
mixes orange juice, iced tea and other fruit drinks for the middies.
   The blue-and-gold cartons, decorated with anchors and the Naval
Academy insigia, are stamped not with the last date of use but the
date the milk was packed, fresh from the cow, usually two days
before it winds up on the midshipmen's tables.
   Upperclassmen talk wistfully of the milk shakes they used to get
from the cream skimmed from the milk. Peterson says the academy
recently restored homemade ice cream to the menu.
   Of a half-dozen midshipmen stopped at random as they strode the
campus pathways between classes, all but one knew the origin of
their milk.
   Ralita Hildebrand, 18, of Beaver Creek, Ohio, said, ``I knew
after plebe summer started because everybody made such a big deal
about bringing the milk cartons home for parents' weekend. All the
parents wanted to take a milk carton back.''
   If commercial dairy farmers once looked askance at the naval
farm, its neighbors in Anne Arundel County now welcome it as a green
barrier against development, says Jack Merritt, the farm
superintendent.
   ``There is much more widespread and vigorous sympathy for us
staying here simply because the alternative appears to be another
48,000 houses,'' says Merritt.
   Jim Reeder, director of member relations for the Maryland and
Virginia Milk Producers Co-operative, says the $1.66 that the
academy pays for its milk ``is probably a competitive price.''
   Reeder says the dairymen would still prefer that the academy buy
milk from them, ``But we haven't made any effort at all since that
time (in the 1960s) to do anything about it.''
   That's just fine with the middies.
   ``I always take a half-gallon up from the table,'' says Kevin
Harris, 19, a third classman from Alexandria, Va., who stores it in
the communal refrigerator in his company wardroom. ``They leave some
out for us if we want to take it up.''
   Mike Metzger, 21, a first classman from Crofton, Md., who
attended high school just down the road from the farm, says the
dairy also serves another important purpose: ``We need the farm to
keep Bill the Goat there.''
   The academy's long-horned mascot lives in a pen near the milking
parlor. Its fence is topped with barbed wire to thwart kidnappers
from West Point, who often try to liberate the goat before the
Army-Navy football game.
   West Point Cadet Capt. Adam Such, 22, of El Paso, Texas, who
spent a semester at the Naval Academy last year and returned
recently for a leadership conference, spoke with envy of the
midshipmen's copious milk supplies.
   ``The stuff we get doesn't taste as good,'' he says. ``Honestly,
we don't get enough dairy products. There's ice cream here. I would
like to see that kind of stuff with us.''
   But the West Pointer added, ``I don't know if having your own
farm is the answer.''

who doesn't think the world would be a better place if we were all
able to work quadratic equations.
   ``Come to the fifth floor,'' he instructs a visitor, ``and go to
room...this is rather embarrassing given the subject of the book,
but it's either room 540 or 542.''
   A huge poster of Bertrand Russell, one of his idols, looks over
his shoulder as he works. A pyramid of blue and magenta empty
Hawaiian Punch cans _fun to move around in different configurations
_ rests quietly now in a garish display on his windowsill.
   Paulos, a 43-year-old Temple University professor, has written
``Innumeracy: Mathematical Illiteracy and its Consequences,'' a book
whose title would not compel the average reader to snap it off the
shelf. But it's fun, and Paulos tells you it's OK to skip the tough
parts.
   One of the tough parts is the title itself. The word
``innumeracy,'' which means the inability to deal comfortably with
the fundamental notions of number and chance, has been in usage in
England since the 1950s, Paulos says. He first came across it
several years ago in an article in Scientific American.
   ``It will be in American dictionaries soon,'' he says. ``Dan
Rather has used it a few times and that's got to be an imprimatur.''
   But back to that first question. Throughout the book, Paulos has
a knack of breaking things down into easily grasped units.
   He wants people to have a sense of the vast difference among the
members of the ``...illion'' family. He suggests you look at it this
way: One million seconds takes about 11{ days to tick by. A billion
seconds would take almost 32 years. A trillion seconds equals 32,000
years.
   Paulos says he sometimes asks his freshman students how high the
Empire State Building is.
   ``I don't want them to go and look it up,'' he says. ``I just
want to know about their sense of proportion and scale. I would
consider 1,000 feet a correct answer, even 2,000 feet, because it's
in the range. (Actual footage is 1,200 feet.) But if a student said
50 feet or a mile, he has no sense of what a mile is, what a mile is
like straight up in the air.''
   Paulos, who teaches freshmen as well as graduate students, is a
recognized expert in symbolic logic, computer languages and
artificial intelligence. Born in Denver, he grew up in Milwaukee and
describes himself as a bright kid but very shy.
   ``This is a book for educated people,'' he says.
   Paulos notes that he once accompanied his wife, a former French
teacher turned romance novelist, to the doctor to learn more about a
minor procedure she was facing.
   ``Within 20 minutes, the doctor said there was only a
million-to-one shot of something going wrong, that it was a 99
percent safe procedure, and then he said that it usually went quite
well,'' he says. When Paulos tried to explain to the physician that
he just said three entirely different things, he was met with a grim
stare and incomprehension.
   ``Even in their areas of expertise, people just use numbers, not
knowing what they mean,'' he says.
   Paulos has met with blank stares before. When he did the comedy
club act one of his jokes had to do with the sign suggesting
citizens put litter where it belongs. Paulos pointed out that if
people did that, it would no longer be litter, it would be garbage.
Litter, he pointed out, is litter only when it is littering.
   Not too many chuckles.
   ``Actually, most of it went quite well, but some of it was a
little too cerebral for the club,'' he says.
   He also gets blank stares when he quips that something selling at
a ``fraction of its normal cost'' probably is _ and that the
fraction is 4@3.
   His quixotic quest is serious. He feels that innumeracy
contributes to a lack of skepticism and lack of critical thinking,
which leads to poor life decisions.

   ``People should know, for instance, that when they see a headline
that says something like 1 million American children kidnapped every
year, that it's simply not true,'' he says.
   ``Innumerates, if I can use that as a noun, tend to personalize
things and overvalue coincidences,'' he says. ``They don't have a
sense of how unrare coincidences are, so they read entirely too much
into them.''
   These are the people, he says, who get involved with numerology,
astrology, and such largely because they don't understand the laws
of probabilities, nor do they think critically. Do they ever wonder
how many times the psychic was wrong, rather than boasting about the
one time he was right?
   Paulos has many funny examples in his book, such as the Wisconsin
legislator who opposed daylight-saving time on the grounds that that
much more sun would fade the curtains and the carpets faster.
   He blames math teachers, the social acceptability of even
intelligent men and women rather proudly flaunting their innumeracy,
and a general unawareness of how important these things are in a
society that is rapidly becoming more and more scientific and
technical.
   He has no patience with people who proclaim they do not have a
head for numbers.
   ``Anyone can master the elements of mathematics,'' Paulos says.
``The unfortunate thing is that some of it is kind of ugly. It's
like learning to parse a sentence. That's not fun, but it's
necessary to get to the fun things like literature. Before you play
with patterns and structures and have fun with math, you have to go
through the ugly part, too.''
   He partially blames the math teachers who lack imagination. As a
fifth-grader, he was very proud to have computed the ERA (earned run
average) of one of the worst pitchers the Milwaukee Braves ever had
_ a 135. He showed it to his teacher. The teacher told him to go sit
down, announcing authoritatively that the highest possible ERA was
27.
   At the end of the year, the Milwaukee Journal published all the
ERA's, and since this guy had been kicked down to the minors and not
pitched again, there it was in black and white _ 135.
   When confronted with this, the teacher, though dead wrong, told
Paulos to sit down.
   ``I hope that martinet is reading my book,'' Paulos says. ``His
idea of teaching math was getting students to sit down.''
   Paulos also wrote two previous books, ``Mathematics and Humor,''
and ``I Think Therefore I Laugh,'' as well as various newspaper and
magazine articles. He is negotiating a contract to write a
syndicated weekly column on problems great and small, sort of a
Paulos on numbers and probabilities rather than a William Safire on
usage.
   Paulos is also concerned about a blind faith in numbers. He
stresses that the human assumptions must be correct before the math
is good.
   He points out that even the most basic ``one and one is two'' is
not correct if the assumptions are wrong. His example: One cup of
popcorn plus one cup of water does not equal two of anything. It
equals one and one-half cups of soggy popcorn.
   The book, published by Hill and Wang, is an alternate Book of the
Month Club selection and has received generally good reviews.
   Paulos did get one irate call from a fundamentalist because of a
section in which he is trying to make the point that by numerically
looking at things, even in literature, certain inconsistencies crop
up. One example is the description of the Flood in the book of
Genesis. Paulos starts calculating and the figures he comes up with
show the rain came down at a rate of 15 feet an hour for 960 hours,
certainly enough, he points out, to sink a modern aircraft carrier,
much less an ark with a bunch of mangy animals rocking the ship.
   As part of his overall reform, he would like newspapers and
magazines to start using figures differently. He argues that the
mathematical expression ``7.39842 x 10 to the 10th power'' is more
comprehensible and legible than ``seventy-three billion nine hundred
and eighty-four million and two-hundred thousand.'' Actually, most
newspaper computers aren't equipped with scientific notations and
the style would be, for that figure, 73,984,200,000.
   Or did you ever wonder how many cigarettes are smoked each year
in the United States? Paulos' answer: 5 x 10 to the 11th power.
Translation newspaper style: 500 billion.
   Well, he can't always be right. His probabilities are just better.

   EDITOR'S NOTE _ Florida is a paradise lost for many newcomers who
had visions of an idyllic retirement in the sun. Mental-health
experts have begun paying more attention to a malaise that has come
to be known as the Florida Syndrome, often manifested by
stress-related ailments such as depression and chronic anxiety. As
one doctor put it, ``It's the reality of Florida versus the
fantasy.''

   In travel brochures and the songs of
Jimmy (``Margaritaville'') Buffett, Florida is a palm-fringed haven
from the rat race where ordinary troubles dissolve under a blazing
sun.
   But many newcomers are still hunting for paradise among the
impersonal sprawl of shopping plazas and traffic-clogged
thoroughfares.
   ``I came here with stars in my eyes,'' says Francis Greene, a
28-year-old construction equipment salesman who relocated from
Philadelphia in September. ``I ended up with an ulcer in my
stomach.''
   In a state of transplants _ 780 a day by census estimates _
Greene is one of the many rejections, say psychological experts and
counselors.
   Recently, more attention is being paid to the malaise that can
beset Florida newcomers.
   Experts say working families are confronted by demoralizing
commutes, uninviting condominium complexes and the anxiety of random
violence in a state where cash-and-carry gun purchases are still
possible.
   Retirees, they say, can face isolation and boredom. Others simply
drop out.
   ``I call it the Florida Syndrome,'' says Dr. Dean J. Rotondo,
director of the neurological laboratory at Fair Oaks Hospital in
Delray Beach, about 45 miles north of Miami. ``It's the reality of
Florida versus the fantasy.''
   Rotondo believes the funk is particularly strong in the 60-mile
urban strip between Miami and West Palm Beach, where a nearly
twofold population boom in the past 20 years has overburdened roads
and sent developers to the fringe of the Everglades in search of
land.
   Stress-related ailments, such as depression and chronic anxiety,
are the most common manifestations of Florida Syndrome, says
Rotondo, a native of New York City.
   ``I, like many people, came here thinking that if I had a problem
I would just go to the beach,'' he says. ``Well, you can only go to
the beach so much. When people come down here and find all the
problems they left behind _ and sometimes they are worse _ what's
left is a lot of disillusionment and irritability.''
   Dr. Joyce Glasser, a psychological counselor in Fort Lauderdale,
says the normal stress of moving is sometimes amplified in Florida
because relatives and friends are often left behind.
   ``There's always an adjustment process after a move,'' says
Glasser, who came from Chicago in 1977. ``What we have here is
people facing all these new ways of doing things. It hits some
people quite hard.''
   In Dr. Cesar Benarroche's counseling sessions, some newcomers
fret over the crime reports of a homicide every 6.4 hours and a lack
of convenient public transportation. Some are even haunted by the
peninsula's flatness and air conditioners blasting on Christmas Day.
   ``You have to deal with Florida as it is, not like you imagine it
should be,'' says Benarroche, a former Yale University professor.
   But accepting the urbanized Florida is particularly difficult for
the elderly, who may have toiled during their careers with visions
of an idyllic retirement in the sun, says Irwin I. Isaacs, a Fort
Lauderdale psychologist.
   What greets many retirees, he says, is domestic friction and the
aura of death.
   ``You have these large retirement villages and each week there's
someone dying,'' says Isaacs, who conducts seminars for disenchanted
elders in South Florida. ``You just make a new friend and then they
are dead. It can be very disturbing.''
   Isaacs, who moved to Florida from suburban Nassau County near New
York City, says many retirees in his groups often can't cope with
the full-time presence of a spouse.
   ``Here's the person you dreamt of spending your life with and all
of a sudden you say, `I think I hate them,''' he says.
   Still, there are some who find the warm breezes sweep them right
off the mainstream.
   Al Ackerman, 32, came to Miami from Chicago in 1984 seeking to
make a stake in the real estate market.
   He now does odd jobs in the Keys and occasionally hops a sailboat
to the nearby Bahamas.
   ``The only Florida Syndrome I ever had was a hangover from too
much rum,'' he said one recent afternoon in Key Largo.
   He then started to hum a Jimmy Buffett tune.

   Timothy Daly believes that if you're going to
be an actor you also have to be a people watcher.
   ``I watch people, I listen to people, I make up stories about
people,'' says Daly, who stars in the new CBS series ``Almost
Grown.''
   ``I live in New York City and what's so wonderful is that if you
have to research a character all you have to do is walk out the
door.''
   He recalls having a role as a blind man once and found a blind
man on the streets.
   ``I followed him around for a while,'' he says. ``He didn't know
I was there so he wasn't self-conscious.''
   ``Almost Grown'' is a drama that takes Norman Foley (Daly) and
Suzie Long Foley (Eve Gordon) through three decades of courtship,
marriage and divorce. They travel back and forth through their
lives, as though in a time machine triggered by the music of a
particular era. Their relationship, attitudes and roles vary with
the times.
   Foley is program director for a radio station, so there is
constant music to trigger the flashbacks.
   ``It's interesting that when we go back in time the characters
remember it with a different perspective,'' he says. ``He may
remember a time as happy, she may remember it as sad. The story is
usually told from my point of view, but sometimes it's Eve's or
sometimes it's Albert Machlin's, who plays Eve's brother.''
   Daly says he was approached about the series by David Chase, one
of the executive producers. They had previously worked together on
an episode of ``Alfred Hitchcock Presents.''
   ``At first I was very skeptical because of the different ages I
had to play,'' Daly says. ``All the people I've seen in miniseries
who put shoe polish in their hair. How was I going to be accepted as
a 40-year-old?
   ``It's a real acting job. It's more fun. You get to wear wigs and
costumes and switch periods. It's a great part.''
   It's the second series for Daly. Six years ago he played a doctor
in ``Ryan's Four,'' which lasted only a few weeks on ABC. He was in
the miniseries ``I'll Take Manhattan'' and in January starred in the
CBS movie ``Red Earth, White Earth.'' His feature films include
``Made in Heaven'' and the upcoming ``Love or Money'' and
``Spellbinder.''
   Daly grew up in suburban Rockland County, northwest of New York
City. His father was actor James Daly and his sister is Tyne Daly,
formerly of ``Cagney &amp; Lacey.'' He has two other sisters who he says
were ``spared from acting careers.''
   ``Thank God I wasn't a professional kid,'' he says. ``It allowed
me to have my life and little bit of innocence. One of the things
that's really important for an actor is to live. That's what actors
do, reflect life. If you spend your life on a sound stage you don't
get a clear picture of what's going on in the world.''
   Daly says he feels he became a professional actor when he got his
Equity card in 1978.
   ``I was going to play with my dad in `Equus' on a summer stock
tour,'' he says. ``He died the day we were to start rehearsals.
Kevin McCarthy took over the role. I have bittersweet memories about
it. I had worked once before with my dad in `Jenny Kissed Me' at the
Bucks County Playhouse. They wrote in one line for me. I'd always
miss the curtain calls because I'd be out back skipping rocks on the
river.''
   He has never worked with his sister, Tyne. There was some talk of
a role on ``Cagney &amp; Lacey,'' but the show rarely used guest stars.
   ``I took acting very seriously,'' Daly says. ``In my family the
stage was hallowed ground. My mother was also an actress. In the
fourth-grade play the other kids would have adoring parents taking
pictures. I'd get notes. `You upstaged yourself.'''
   Daly's wife, actress Amy Van Nostrand, recently had a guest role
on ``Almost Grown'' and co-starred with Tyne Daly in a TV movie
called ``Kids Like These.''
   They met while playing opposite each other in Sam Shepard's
``Buried Child'' in 1981 at Trinity Repertory Theater in Providence,
R.I. They have a son, Sam, who will soon be 5.

   For much of his career in Broadway musicals,
James Brennan has been paid not to perform.
   You could find his name in tiny type in the Playbill, usually
beneath a sentence solemnly proclaiming, ``Understudies never
substitute for listed players unless a specific announcement is made
at the time of the performance.''
   From ``Good News'' to ``So Long, 147th Street'' to ``I Love My
Wife'' to ``Little Me'' to ``Singin' in the Rain'' to ``Me and My
Girl,'' Brennan has ``stood by'' or ``covered'' roles, terms used to
describe that unsung hero of live performance _ the understudy.
   Now, in a reaffirmation of classic Broadway folklore, the
understudy has become the star. Brennan has taken over the leading
role in ``Me and My Girl,'' the long-running British musical about a
cockney scamp who inherits a title and money but almost loses his
girlfriend because of his new-found wealth.
   ``The day of my first performance here in New York, my wife drove
me by the marquee, and I looked at it,'' he says. ``I had a double
feeling. All at once, I was saying, `I can't believe it.' But I also
thought to myself, `Yeah, it looks just like everybody else's name
did up there.'''
   The 38-year-old Brennan has been part of the ``Me and My Girl''
company since the show opened in 1986. He was the standby for its
original star, Robert Lindsay, and then for Lindsay's replacement,
Jim Dale.
   ``It was the best job in New York,'' Brennan says. ``I could come
in to work and check in at half hour (before curtain time) and then
go to the theater or go to a restaurant or talk with a friend or
read a book or do a crossword puzzle _ and I did all that.''
   During Lindsay's nine-month run, Brennan never went on for the
star, but he played the role for about six weeks during Dale's
20-month engagement. Replacing a big name can be unnerving for a
performer who must face the wrath of disappointed theatergoers
expecting to see someone else.
   ``There is a good understudy mentality and a bad understudy
mentality,'' Brennan says. ``You have to disregard the groans and
the displeasure that the audience exhibits at the beginning of the
evening and hold onto what you know the curtain call will be at the
end of the evening.
   ``I remember going through a time when I thought `How can I live
up to what the audience expects?''' he adds. ``But you get over
that. It's not your job to worry.''
   Brennan originally took the job with ``Me and My Girl'' because
he had heard the lead role was terrific.
   ``I also heard that Bob Lindsay was magic,'' he adds, ``I thought
I could learn something from him, which, in fact, was the case.''
   Last fall, Brennan replaced Tim Curry in the national touring
company of the show, playing three months around the country before
coming back to the starring role in New York.
   ``Because we have good producers, they tried to find someone with
a box-office name,'' he says. ``They didn't find anybody who fit all
the requirements of the role and still had box-office impact.''
   So Brennan was chosen for the demanding part. Now he has thrown
himself into a regimen _ a lot of rest and a lot of food so he'll
have enough strength to get through the marathon workout. But it's
something he has worked for all his professional career.
   Born and raised in Newark, N.J., he remembers discovering theater
programs an aunt had brought back across the Hudson River from
Manhattan. And he recalls lobbying to see either ``The Music Man''
or ``Gypsy.'' He didn't get to either one, but the theater bug had
bit.
   In high school, Brennan appeared in a musical every year. The
director, Robert Hayes, also ran a summer theater in Beach Haven on
the Jersey shore.
   ``He asked me if I wanted to be an apprentice there after my
sophomore year of high school,'' Brennan recalls. ``In Newark,
there's not a lot to do in the summer, so I did. I was there five
years, all summer.''
   Brennan majored in theater at Rutgers University and after
graduating went out on the road with a long national tour of ``No,
No, Nanette,'' starring June Allyson and later Virginia Mayo.
   The director was Donald Saddler who later cast Brennan in the
chorus of a revival of the 1927 college musical ``Good News.'' Since
then, he has never stopped working in the theater. His stints have
included roles in a revue ``Rodgers and Hart'' and in ``42nd
Street,'' two shows where he didn't have to understudy anyone.
   Brennan also has been back to Beach Haven to direct for Hayes and
has worked for the New Amsterdam Theater Company, directing and
choreographing such old musicals as Cole Porter's ``Jubilee'' and
Jerome Kern's ``Sally.''
   ``I find that everything is sort of a chain in show business,''
Brennan says. ``And I've been very lucky.''

<NOTE>EDITOR'S NOTE </NOTE>
<TEXT>
   This is the first in a series of periodic reports
by The Associated Press on economic, social and political turbulence
that has turned South America into a continent in crisis. This
report is on Venezuela, where rioting over price increases focused a
spotlight on the mass of poor who were left out while others
prospered in an oil boom.

<DATELINE>CARACAS, Venezuela (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Oil in the last decade has made some
Venezuelans very rich, but millions of them stayed very poor.
   Hillside shantytowns known as ``ranchos'' never vanished _ in
fact, they multiplied _ as oil gushed up and dollars rushed in. But
mansions of the wealthy became more sumptuous and their inhabitants
more frivolous.
   Not only did they import Scotch whisky, they also imported water
from the Scottish Highlands to go with it.
   And so, on Feb. 27, 11 days after newspapers ran accounts of
Caracas' ``Wedding of the Century'' _ a reception for 3,500 guests,
200 of them flown in at their hosts' expense from as far away as
Tahiti _ the ranchos exploded.
   Their protests of increases in bus fares and the prices of
gasoline and other basics turned into the bloodiest civil unrest in
Venezuela's recent history. By official count, at least 256 people
were killed and 2,000 wounded. Other quarters say the death toll
might have exceeded 300.
   ``The luxury of the few has become an insult to the misery of the
masses,'' said a post-riot document of the Roman Catholic Church,
among the most conservative in Latin America.
   President Carlos Andres Perez, who returned to office in January
after a term in 1974-79, called the five days of violence a struggle
of ``the poor against the rich.''
   He later modified his remark, but the original intent remained
illustrative of what went wrong: Venezuela's oil wealth had not
filtered down to the masses.
   Resentment among the poor grew stronger as real wages steadily
shrank by as much as 30 percent since 1980, putting health care and
housing out of reach of the poor. An estimated 41 percent of
Venezuela's 18 million people live in slums.
   But for the rich, life did not change as the economy weakened
with the collapse of oil prices.
   The wedding of Mariela Cisneros, daughter of Oswaldo Cisneros,
president of Pepsi-Cola's Venezuelan subsidiary, and Gonzalo
Fernandez, from a prosperous business family, reflected high-class
life in Venezuela. Guests were served imported Scotch, vintage
French wines and the finest delicacies from abroad.
   Perez's own inauguration, called ``the coronation'' to which
dozens of world leaders, including Vice President Dan Quayle and
Fidel Castro, were invited, gave the illusion of a return of that
the happy days of affluence, which reached a high point during his
first administration.
   ``Overwhelmed by wholesale promises during last year's election
campaign, people expected nothing but bonanza,'' said Anibal Romero,
professor of political science at Simon Bolivar University in
Caracas. ``It has been a sudden and bitter awakening for all of
them,''
   As the world's eighth-largest oil producer, Venezuela for years
provided its people with Latin America's highest standard of living,
subsidizing everything from eggs to limousines. Oil allowed
government after government to conceal the ills of a developing
nation.
   ``We were falsifying the economy because oil allowed us to do
so,'' the novelist and essayist Arturo Uslar Pietri was quoted as
telling the Caracas newspaper El Universal. ``It led people to
believe prices wouldn't go up, that the government would subsidize
them.''
   A lifestyle supported by oil wealth made possible all kinds of
economic eccentricities.
   Until early this decade, Venezuela imported most of its food,
including potato chips, pears and cherries from the United States.
   But the poor did not benefit significantly from those affluent
years. According to official figures, as of last year four out of 10
Venezuelans lived in the adobe and brick ranchos on the slopes
ringing Caracas and other major cities.
   ``An accusatory crown of thorns,'' the Roman Catholic Church
called them in a housing study published before the riots.
   In the church's post-riot document, published March 9, Archbishop
Jose Ali Lebrun and 20 other priests assailed what they called ``the
widening gap between poor and rich'' and said Venezuela's $33
billion foreign debt should not be the burden of the poor.
   ``We remind economic and political leaders that they have a duty
to give examples of austerity and honesty ... so that the terrible
burden of sacrifices the country must make because of its foreign
debt will not be borne by weak and poor sectors alone,'' the
document said.
   Nearly half of Caracas' 4 million people live in ranchos. Most
migrated from rural areas and neighboring Colombia seeking a better
life, as a result of economic policies that for years neglected the
countryside in favor of urban and industrial growth subsidized by
oil.
   Perez's remarks blaming the riots on a class struggle stirred
furious protests from the private sector.
   ``You ... who are leading the nation for the second time should
be proud that there still are rich people,'' said Fedecamaras, a
business association, in an unusually harsh letter to Perez. ``It
would be incomprehensible to have only poor people after the
gigantic resources oil has provided us.''
   ``It is dangerous to defy poverty,'' Perez responded.
   But it was his government's economic measures that led to the
disorders. On Feb. 16, Perez had announced an austerity program that
included the end of subsidies on basic food items, public services
and gasoline. The government action increased bus fares by 30
percent but private owners raised theirs 100 to 200 percent. Perez
said the measures were necessary to keep the country from heading
into an inflationary spiral.
   As the Caracas upheaval spread across the nation, people living
in the wealthy east side of Caracas formed armed defense brigades.
An Associated Press reporter saw some members of the brigades
carrying sub-machine guns, rifles, pistols and machetes.
   Until the outbursts, it had been commonplace to hear Venezuelans
comment that ``some day'' the people of the ranchos would descend on
the city in rage. But few imagined it would be so bad.
   ``Now the rich will no longer flaunt their opulence so easily,''
said political scientist Romero.
   Others think the time has come to leave the country, which just
few years ago was attracting thousands from Italy, Spain, Portugal
other South American nations.
   ``I am afraid we're going to have social turbulence for a
while,'' said Manuel del Canto, a transport executive. ``I don't
want to stay here for the next explosion.''
   But he added: ``We Venezuelans are too late to join the
immigration currents to the U.S. or Europe. The Argentines,
Brazilians, Chileans or Mexicans are already filling the quotas.''
   Indeed, at least one travel agency anticipates an outward rush.
It ran an advertisement in newspapers offering ``Chileans,
Argentines, Uruguayans, Portuguese, Italians, Spanish'' a special
``operation return'' to their home countries.
   ``We have received numerous calls asking for information about
our return plan,'' said an official of the Chasqui travel agency in
Caracas.

   BISSAU, Guinea-Bissau (AP) _ Two years ago Bissau's Bandim Market
was a ramshackle collection of empty stalls. Today it is so full and
busy that sellers of goods and produce have spilled out into the
highway that runs by it.
   Local merchants and traders from neighboring Senegal and The
Gambia here on Africa's northwest shoulder haggle with milling
crowds from behind counters full of rice, fruits and vegetables,
meat, fish and brightly patterned bolts of cloth.
   Prices are much higher than those at poorly stocked, state-run
Armazens do Povo stores, but supplies are plentiful.
   ``The day I arrived two years ago, there was not one bottle of
beer in the country,'' said Anne Williams of the U.S. Agency for
International Development, illustrating the dearth of things then.
She had brought food and other supplies with her but now relies on
the local markets for her needs.
   The new bounty is due in most part to the government's decision
in late 1986 _ following along with other African countries in
similarly precarious straits _ to cast aside some of the basic
Marxist concepts it adopted after independence from Portugal in 1974
and liberalize one of the world's poorest economies.
   It lifted price controls and trade restrictions at the behest of
the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank and stamped out
black-marketeering all in one swoop. The measures have taken hold if
the Bandim Market is any test.
   State control of the economy was the norm for many African
nations, Guinea-Bissau among them, following independence from
European colonizers.
   Ghana, Tanzania, Nigeria, Zaire and the Ivory Coast are all in
the process of divesting state-own companies and looking for buyers
in the private sector.
   Of the five former Portuguese African colonies, Sao Tome e
Principe, the island nation off Gabon, has taken the greatest
strides to shed Marxist economic trappings, dissolving controls and
opening up markets to private buyers and investment.
   Mozambique and Angola, other former Portuguese colonies that
adopted Marxist economics, are moving toward liberalization, but the
transition is hampered by guerrilla wars that disrupt their
economies.
   Nowadays, Bissauans with money can dine on grilled shrimp and hot
``piri-piri'' sauce at the Galeao restaurant and dance at discos
like the Tropicana and Tabanca.
   Pigs and chickens still scrabble around the open sewers of poorer
areas, but children playing in the shade of long, corrugated iron
verandahs show few of the signs of malnutrition so widespread two
years ago.
   After a long, bloody struggle for independence from Portugal, the
Partido Africano da Independencia da Guine e Cabo Verde (PAIGC),
under the leadership of Luis Cabral, embarked in 1974 on a
then-fashionable road of Marxist-inspired development via
industrialization.
   But by 1980, after channeling investment away from agriculture
and toward large-scale industrial projects like an auto plant that
closed down when parts ran out and the Cumere agro-industrial plant
that never got off the ground, Guinea-Bissau's economy was in ruins.
   A series of droughts drastically reduced rice production, and
food supplies lessened as the population grew.
   Cabral was ousted by the military in a November 1980, and Prime
Minister Joao ``Nino'' Vieira took over.
   Manuel dos Santos, his minister of state for commerce, economic
coordination and tourism, says liberalization of trade has brought a
change in the quality of life as well as financial improvement.
   ``Essential goods have always been available, but only on the
black market,'' he said. ``Now there's hardly a black market to
speak of.''
   Dos Santos said he expects to bring inflation down from its
current annual rate of 50 percent to 15 or 20 percent by year's end.
   Since 1986, Guinea-Bissau's economic growth has averaged more
than 5 percent a year, a reversal of the days when it figured on the
minus side.
   Today, a kilo (2.2 pounds) of Guinean-grown rice costs about
1,000 Guinean pesos (50 cents) in the Bandim Market, but a housewife
in search of something rarer, must pay twice that much for a single
carrot.
   That's expensive in what is still one of the world's 15 poorest
countries; its annual per capita income is about $190.
   But the government hopes two recent accords with Portugal
designed to guarantee the convertibility of the peso into other
currencies and to set up a commercial bank to finance small
businesses, should help increase trade and prosperity.
   In addition to making more funds available from Lisbon, peso
convertibility should halt a considerable flow of goods out through
Senegal, where traders make their deals in CFA francs, which is
backed by the Bank of France. CFA (French initials for African
Financial Community) francs are the currency of former French
colonies in Africa and the currency is pegged to the French franc,
which made it more reliable than the peso.
   According to dos Santos, 70 to 80 percent of trade is now
controlled by the Guinea-Bissau's private sector. Two years ago, he
said, it was just the contrary.
   Diplomats and others say the loosening of economic reins in
Guinea-Bissau is likely to bring more, through less radical,
liberalization in the political sphere.
   The government is expected to approve a simplified foreign
investment code. It will be followed by a revised constitution,
that, though falling short of a shift toward a multi-party system,
will allow more popular participation in government.
   In addition to strengthening ties with Portugal, Prime Minister
Vieira has managed to continue to receive aid from many other
countries, Eastern and Western, to help support his population of
nearly 1 million people.
   ``There's still a huge international aid effort going on here,
and Guinea-Bissau is one of the darlings of the aid agencies,'' said
Robert Collingwood, delegate of the European Economic Community in
Bissau.
   Aid workers say Guinea-Bissau's attraction is due in part to its
success in swallowing bitter IMF and World Bank austerity medicine,
including a sharp devaluation of the peso and massive cuts in public
spending.
   The current foreign debt stands at about $270 million on which
the country pays an annual debt service of $28.9 million.
   ``Humanitarian organizations have always had a romantic sympathy
for the PAIGC, as Guinea-Bissau was one of the few African countries
to actually fight for its independence,'' said one aid official. He
also said agencies are attracted by Guinea-Bissau's small area
(about the size of Connecticut and Massachuetts combined) that makes
experimental projects easy to supervise.
   The country's main export cash crop, cashew nuts, a recent
introduction on World Bank recommendations, accounted for more than
half the $15-million in exports last year.
   Dos Santos says fishing is Guinea-Bissau's best hope since it is
on the Atlantic Ocean.
   ``It could provide us with the most resources in the shortest
time and could make up about 50 percent of our exports.''
   But it needs more fishermen, boats and equipment.
   Bissau's Pindjiguiti port is still a sleepy place; the country
exported only about $500,000 worth of fish last year.
   The United States has provided a $300,000 coastal surveillance
system to help prevent poaching in Guinea-Bissau's waters.
   ``What we really need are more fishing boats with production
facilities on board and better training,'' said dos Santos.

   BISSAU, Guinea-Bissau (AP) _ Women are responsible for one
Guinea-Bissau's economic successes.
   With help from the United Nations Development Program, more than
1,400 women work about 123,000 acres of land on the outskirts of
Bissau, growing tomatoes, lettuce and other vegetables that
supplement their families' basic rice diet and provide extra income
when sold in the market.
   ``The problem is that it works too well and they actually produce
too much,'' said Ursula King, who has worked as a U.N. development
officer for Guinea-Bissau, Mali and Sierra Leone. ``What they need
is food processing to preserve the stuff and get some value added.''
   ``Small-scale industries are the way to go,'' said Rosemary
Galli, co-author of ``Guinea-Bissau: Politics, Economics and
Society.''
   ``They give people jobs and promote trade between villages
instead of just with the city of Bissau or Senegal.''

<TEXT>
   Let's free associate: Paris, lovers, springtime,
chestnut blossoms, couples kissing in a sidewalk cafe. The City of
Light evokes vivid images like that, but none is more enduring than
that of the Eiffel Tower, which turns 100 years old this month.
   The tower built by Alexafel has become the most
beloved of French landmarks, but it was not always so.
   In fact, back in 1887, people living around the tower work site
were appalndre Gustave Eifled by the ``giant and disgraceful skeleton.''
Engineers
warned it would collapse and a lawsuit tried to halt construction. A
newspaper headline exclaimed, ``The Tower Is Sinking.''
   But La Tour Eiffel (Eiffel Tower in French) soared aove it all,
surviving to become the definitive symbol of Paris.
   ``It's true, the public was a little mistrusting in the
beginning, they were afraid and fought the tower,'' said Janine
Yiatman, Eiffel's great granddaughter.
   But Parisians, it seems, understand the human need for the
superfluous. The tower constructed at the entrance to the 1889 Paris
Universal Exposition on the the Seine River across from the
Trocadero survived as a filigree iron homage to the industrial
revolr.
   All of this he accomplished in two years, two months and two days
with a crew of only 200 men _ and he kept within his $1.6-million
budget.
   Building the 555-foot-tall Washington Monument, in contrast, took
36 years.
   ``I should be jealous of the tower,'' Eiffel once said shortly
before his death in 1923. ``It's more famous than I am.''
   Eiffel was 53 years old when his design was selected from 120
others by a government wanting to build a monument expressing the
country's recovery from a humiliating defeat in the Franco-Prussian
War and its achievements in the industrial age a mere 100 years
after the French Revolution.
   An exhibit at the tower, which will run through September, tells
the story of the tower's origin and explores the life of the
masterful engineer who wielded iron in entirely new ways.
   Eiffel designed locks for the Panama Canal and crafted the
internal iron skeleton using cross bracing for the Statue of
Liberty. He built bridges worldwide using a system of pilings that
could support tons of metal and concrete at unprecedented heights.
   Eiffel employed these same techniques in creating his ladder to
the sky.
   Since World War I, the tower has served as a radio and
meteorological post and recently was fitted with television
broadcasting equipment. But its utilitarian value is secondary to
its role as a beautiful perch.
   More than 123 million people have gone up to have a look around
in the past 100 years and the view has never failed to incite the
imagination.
   One man tried to fly from it and was killed when his wings
failed. In 1923 a bicycle-riding journalist careened down the steps
from the top floor to the ground. A moutaineer scaled it in 1954 and
in 1984 two Englishmen parachuted from it.
   A New Zealand man jumped headfirst from the tower's second level
with an elastic cord tied around his feet in 1987 _ and bounced back.
   He wanted to bring the sport of ``bungy jumping'' to Paris and
felt the tower was the right place to do it.
   ``I mean, it's such a beautiful place'' was all he said to
reporters as the police whisked him away.
   In the same whacky spirit, tightrope walker Philippe Petit will
inch his way along a wire high above the Seine on Aug. 26 to
commemorate the centenary.
   Petit, known for balancing between New York City's World Trade
Towers, will carry a copy of the Universal Declaration of the Rights
of Man across the river on a 400-foot tightrope connecting the
second level of the tower with the Palais de Chaillot.
   Other festivities include a sound and light show at the tower
June 17, and an evening of films at the Cannes Film Festival in May,
featuring what the poet Guillaume Apollinaire called ``the
shepherdess of the clouds.''
   In the early 1980s, the tower had a facelift that included new
elevators, a museum, a post office and a spectacular new
292,000-watt lighting system that replaced the old floodlights. The
new lights illuminate the tower from within, creating a pale gold
tracery against the night sky.
   The restaurant ``Jules Verne,'' reached by its own separate
elevator in the tower, was remodeled at the same time, and now
reservations are needed a month in advance for dinner in the chic
gray-and-black room with the spectacular view.
   While thousands of words are being written about the tower in
French newspapers and magazines this year, the most eloquent tribute
may have been written decades ago by the French architect Le
Corbusier who said the tower was the sum of its creator, its time
and its place.
   ``Everywhere and among the humble as among others,'' he wrote,
``the tower is in everyone's heart as a sign of a beloved Paris,
beloved sign of Paris.''

<HEAD>Researchers Looking At Hispanics To Find Diabetes Cause</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID SEDENO</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SAN ANTONIO, Texas (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Inside a small motor home, Joanne
Pierluissi raised her sleeve as nurse Mary Perez inserted a needle
into the vein above her forearm, drawing blood into a tube for a
diabetes test.
   As her daughters watched, Pierluissi, 24, said it was for them,
as much as for herself, that she agreed to be tested for the deadly
killer of Hispanics.
   ``I was concerned because they said an aunt of mine had it and I
just wanted to come for the checkup. All of our family is going to
go through the program to make sure that if we have it that we'll do
something about it.''
   Twelve million Americans have some form of diabetes, but it is
most prevalent among minorities, especially Native Americans, blacks
and Hispanics. Hispanics are three times as likely to develop
diabetes as the general population, and 40 percent of the 700,000
victims in Texas are Mexican-American.
   More than 150,000 Americans die from diabetes each year; another
150,000 deaths are diabetes-related, according to the American
Diabetes Association.
   No one really knows what sparks it, but researchers believe
Hispanics could hold the key. San Antonio, the nation's ninth
largest city, with a population that is 50 percent Hispanic, is
becoming the base for diabetes studies.
   Researchers take a customized mobile home to neighborhoods to
randomly check Hispanics and Anglos for the disease, which deprives
the body of insulin and can lead to complications affecting the
heart, kidneys, eyes and nerves.
   San Antonio's Hispanic makeup led Dr. Ralph DeFronzo to abandon
his prestigious position as a Yale University diabetes researcher
and persuade his four-member team to relocate to the University of
Texas Health Science Center.
   An epidemiologist at the center, Dr. Michael Stern, has devoted
10 years to studying Hispanic diabetes and led the grassroots study
of Type II diabetes.
   Type II, the most common form, develops mostly in obese adults
over 40 who also may have a family history of the disease. In obese
diabetics, the body has too much insulin because it is burning more
fats than sugars.
   Type I diabetes usually develops among adolescents and requires
that they have daily injections of insulin.
   Stern said family studies of diabetic patients are brining him
closer to finding the gene that triggers the disease.
   A genetic marker might identify people who are susceptible, which
could lead to a screening test, he said. ``Then you could go out and
zero in on the genetic susceptibles and you can be more intense on
your recommendations to them and you could also study that group.''
   Stern believes if people exercised more and ate less of the
fat-saturated foods common to the diets of low-income Hispanics,
fewer would get the disease.
   ``We use the term double jeopardy for Mexican-Americans,'' he
said. ``We don't know why, when they get diabetes, they have a more
severe form of the disease _ whether it's a biological difference or
is it that they are not getting as good medical care.
   ``But the interesting thing is that upper-income
Mexican-Americans do not have the same risk as low-income
Mexican-Americans. It may be that the gene is there, but for some
reason it may not be expressed in the upper-income Mexican-Americans.
   ``Also, Mexican-Americans tend to have more body fat in their
upper torso and we can see that as related to diabetes.''
   Between 1979 and 1988, Stern and his staff studied more than
5,000 people and found that 387 of 2,905 Hispanics had the disease,
or 13.3 percent, compared to only 87 of 1,780 Anglos, or 4.8 percent.
   Researchers believe that poor Hispanics' diets of cheap,
processed foods, lack of exercise and infrequent medical attention _
either due to poverty or a cultural bias against doctors _ increases
their risk of acquiring diabetes.
   The study is in its follow-up stage, to see if diagnosed diabetes
patients have changed their lifestyle and have sought medical care.
   Teresa Castro, 54, whose diabetic husband died at age 37, went
through the screening eight years ago. She was told that because of
her weight, 254 pounds, she had hypertension and was at risk of
diabetes. Doctors put her on a strict, low-fat diet and she lost 26
pounds.
   ``I went to the screening because they called and said it was
free. That's why I went to it, because being poor I couldn't afford
to go to the doctor for this type of checkup,'' she said. ``My
mother has diabetes and they tell me I might have diabetes, too, but
I don't know too much about it.
   ``I feel OK, but they tell me that one year you can be OK and the
next year, it can be totally different.''
   DeFronzo, who in 1988 was chosen the top diabetes investigator by
Canadian and Japanese diabetes associations, says his unit at the
Health Science Center will try to use many of Stern's patients for
research. That will include work for Lipha Chemicals, which makes an
anti-diabetic drug called metaforim that improves the body's ability
to respond to insulin.
   ``The problem with Type II diabetics is not that they don't make
enough insulin; they don't respond to the insulin,'' DeFronzo said.
``What we'd like to do is make them more responsive and this drug
will do that.''
   The drug is widely used in Europe, Canada and Mexico and should
be approved by the Food and Drug Administration in several years for
U.S. use, he said.
   Educating elementary-school-age children about healthy diets
would help reduce the number of diabetes cases, DeFronzo said. ``If
you have a 65-year-old mother who weighs 220 pounds and you tell her
to go out and jog five miles Monday, Wednesday and Friday, she is
going to laugh at you.
   ``So you have to design an exercise program that is compatible
with the patient's lifestyle and it is something they can do.''

<HEAD>Researcher Developing Machinery To Braid Ceramic Fibers</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DENNIS PATTERSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>RALEIGH, N.C. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Aly El-Shiekh envisions astronauts on a
three-year trip to Mars ``knitting'' themselves a space station
using ceramic fibers that can be braided into panels, beams, boxes
and practically any other shape.
   ``We believe if they can take the ceramic fibers they need and
the machinery we're developing they would be able to literally make
the space stations they will need as they go,'' said El-Shiekh, a
mechanical engineer at working in North Carolina State University's
textiles school.
   El-Shiekh and his students are developing machinery to braid long
strands of ceramic fibers. Such fibers, bonded with epoxy, also will
form heat shields and many of the parts in the vessel that carries
people to Mars. The parts will withstand speeds of 50,000 mph and
temperatures of at least 4,000 degrees.
   While much of his work relates to the Mars Mission Research
Center here, El-Shiekh sees a big future for composite materials
like ceramic fibers.
   ``The day may very well come when you are driving around with car
engine parts of ceramic fiber,'' he said, adding that the
vibration-damping properties of the materials also would make them
good for torsion bars in cars.
   ``We also are working on the idea of putting this braided fabric
in concrete as reinforcing material instead of metal rods,'' he
said. ``It is stronger than steel, does not rust and would not wear
away _ the road would not deteriorate.''
   The fibers, including Kevlar now used to make bulletproof vests,
also could be used to make some body parts, and El-Shiekh is working
with Duke University researchers on ceramic ``stents,'' collapsible
braces for arteries.
   El-Shiekh, who got his degree in mechanical engineering in his
native Egypt, first saw applications of the ancient art of braiding
to space travel in the 1960s when he was at the Massachusetts
Institute of Technology.
   ``The monkeys they were sending into space then came back dizzy
and they could not understand why. NASA sent us films to try to
figure out why this was happening. What we finally discovered was
that they were using twisted ropes for the parachute on the capsule.
   ``When the parachute opened, the ropes would untwist and that
would make the capsule spin on the way down. It was the spinning
that made the monkeys dizzy, so we suggested they change to braided
ropes.''
   El-Shiekh was working in other textile projects until two years
ago when a friend suggested he turn to developing automated
machinery for ceramic fiber. A year later, NASA began setting up
research projects on a manned Mars mission and his work in ceramic
fibers got their attention.
   ``The possibilities are limitless.'' said El-Shiekh, who can
produce shapes ranging from hollow cubes to panels that have
openings for wiring and conduits already braided into them. ``The
big problem is cost and that's why we're working on this automated
machinery.''
   Using scrap parts and whatever materials he could find, he has
designed and built two computer-operated braiding machines.
   ``By hand, we can make an inch of this every hour,'' he said,
pointing to a one-inch-square column of braided carbon fiber. ``With
automation, we can turn out 36 inches every 15 minutes. And we can
do it uniformly. Done by hand, there is always a difference in the
braid from person to person.''

   Opposition parties today demanded that Prime
Minister Noboru Takeshita resign after members of his governing
Liberal Democratic Party admitted reciving money from the company at
the center of a stock scandal.
   Three lawmakers said they received gifts of $8,000 to $31,000 in
July and August from Recruit Co., an information services
conglomerate.
   Recruit allegedly provided bargain-priced stocks in a subsidiary
to about 150 politicians and business leaders in exchange for favors.
   Japanese newspapers and television stations today quoted an
anonymous source with connections to Recruit as saying the company
gave a total of $300,000 to 15 members of Parliament, including a
current Cabinet member, shortly after opposition parties launched an
investigation last summer into the scandal.
   Opposition parties charged the gifts were hush money to lawmakers
linked to Recruit, and they demanded the Takeshita administration
resign to take responsibility for the scandal.
   The three Liberal Democratic lawmakers _ Vice Secretary General
Hajime Ishii, Masao Endo and Kenichiro Otsubo, said they returned
the money. The names of the other members of Parliament who
reportedly received gifts of money were not immediately known.
   ``It is outrageous if such money was received after the Recruit
scandal surfaced,'' said Shun Ohide of the Japan Socialist Party,
the largest opposition group. ``We will intensify our pressure on
Prime Minister Takeshita to either resign or dissolve Parliament and
call an election.''
   Government spokesman Keizo Obuchi said in response to the news
reports, ``We conducted a thorough investigation of all current
Cabinet ministers last year and understand that no one in the
current administration was involved in such a deal since last
summer. I would like to believe in the result of the probe.''
   Prosecutors have arrested 12 people on suspicion of giving or
taking bribes or violating securities laws in the scandal.
   No politicians have been arrested, but disclosures of alleged
influence buying have eroded public support for Takeshita's
16-month-old government. Polls indicate public disapproval ratings
for Takeshita's administration have soared to about 60 percent while
his approval ratings have plunged to about 20 percent.
   The scandal has aggravated the anger of rural voters _ long a
bastion of support for the Liberal Democratic Party _ who resent
concessions to U.S. demands that Japan open its farm markets.
   Although it refuses to allow rice imports, Japan agreed under
U.S. pressure last year to end quotas on imports of beef and citrus
products.
   Some analysts predict an upset in July elections for half of the
upper house of Parliament, where the Liberal Democrats hold 143 of
the 251 seats. A severe setback would endanger Takeshita's chances
next October to win another two-year term as party president and
prime minister.
   Analysts say, however, that Washington will still be dealing with
the Liberal Democrats next year, regardless of Takeshita's fate.
   Successive scandals have failed to shake the Liberal Democrats'
grip on power. With the exception of 10 months of Socialist
government from 1947 to 1948, the party and its predecessor have
governed Japan since World War II.
   The scandal has caused the greatest political fallout in Japan
since former Prime Minister Kakuei Tanaka was accused in the
Lockheed affair in 1976.
   Tanaka was convicted of taking a $2 million bribe after the U.S.
aircraft company admitted it spent $12.1 million to advance its
sales in Japan.

   The stock market headed higher today, continuing
its rebound from a surprise late last week in the government's
monthly employment report.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials rose 18.75 to 2,300.89 in
the first half hour of trading.
   Gainers outnumbered losers by about 9 to 5 in nationwide trading
of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 397 up, 227 down and
427 unchanged.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 22.22 million shares as of 10
a.m. on Wall Street.
   When the Labor Department reported Friday morning that the
unemployment rate had fallen to a 15-year low in February, stocks
and bonds initially sold off on the news.
   The reasoning was that strains on the capacity of the labor force
might intensify inflationary pressures and tend to push interest
rates higher.
   But stocks began a steady recovery Friday afternoon, finishing
the session with only a moderate loss.
   That apparently encouraged traders, and created a general belief
that the market was ready for a new assault on the 2,300 level,
where it bogged down on two occasions last week.
   Among actively traded blue chips, Merck gained { to 64|; American
Telephone &amp; Telegraph added \ to 30}; General Electric was unchanged
at 45, and International Business Machines was down [ at 118[.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks rose
.95 to 165.80. At the American St New York's LaGuardia
Airport before she returned home to Boston today. ``I'm not so sure
if it was worth it. It was a good idea in theory.''
   Eastern's three-day offer of rock-bottom fares on the
Washington-New York-Boston shuttle attracted 8,000 passengers
Friday, 11,000 Saturday and 12,500 Sunday, said John Siefert, vice
president for the shuttle.
   Although fares went up to $49 today, Eastern said it would honor
through Friday the $12 tickets sold over the weekend. After Friday,
prices will return to $69 on weekends, $99 on weekdays and Sunday
evening.
   About 250 passengers were stuck at LaGuardia late Sunday, 200
failed to get on flights from Boston's Logan Airport and at least
100 were turned away at Washington's National Airport. Many spent
the night at the airports and took the first shuttle flights out
this morning.
   ``The first two went out full, so I'm hoping we got most of
them,'' said Rosa R. Williams, shuttle manager at National Airport.
On Sunday night, Eastern employees had given stranded shuttle
passengers peanuts and decks of cards.
   Pickets outside the Eastern terminal in Boston today took note of
stranded passengers with a sign that read: ``Pay $12 and sleep at
the terminal.''
   On Sunday, the Bush administration reiterated its determination
to stay out of the 10-day-old strike by Eastern's 8,500-member
Machinists union.
   ``We are not in the business of running Eastern Airlines or
negotiating the contract for labor,'' Transportation Secretary
Samuel Skinner said on CBS' ``Face The Nation.''
   Eastern trumpeted the reopening of flights to seven Latin
American cities Sunday as a new start for the troubled airline,
which filed for bankruptcy protection last week after most of its
3,600 pilots honored picket lines.
   The carrier launched 75 flights Sunday and hopes to boost that
number to 140 a day by the end of the week, compared with a
pre-strike schedule of 1,040 a day, spokesman Robin Matell said.
   Debbie McLoughlin of New York planned to spend the night at
Eastern's terminal in Boston. ``It's got to be an adventure,''
McLoughlin said. ``I'm a scab, though, with the $12 flight. I took
advantage of a good thing.''
   Most of those left at LaGuardia were promised a seat on an
Eastern flight this morning or flew on Pan Am's rival shuttle, said
Port Authority Police Lt. Alexander Harvey.
   ``When Eastern said `that's it,' these people went over to Pan
Am,'' said Harvey, whose agency runs the airport. Pan Am added a
flight to Washington and chartered two buses to Boston, he said.
   David Hess, a spokesman at Washington's National Airport, said
some passengers waited five hours for seats. About 40 were spending
the night at the airport.
   Eastern maintained that passengers knew what they were getting
into when they bought the cheap tickets.
   ``Those people were not stranded. We advertised the flights were
on a first-come, first-served basis,'' Matell said. ``I'm sorry they
have to wait for the next flight, but they should have gotten there
earlier.''
   One pilot on a picket line at Logan said he held no animosity
toward shuttle passengers, but he questioned Eastern's strategy in
slashing fares.
   ``They're trying to warm the house by burning the furniture to
keep people coming,'' said pilot Dennis Caldwell.
   Eastern's unions have accused Frank Lorenzo, chairman of Eastern
parent Texas Air Corp., of trying to cannibalize the airline. Pilots
and flight attendants have honored Machinists' picket lines, which
went up when the union refused to grant $125 million in concessions
to the airline.
   In Miami, Atlanta and other cities Sunday, dozens of off-duty
Delta Air Lines pilots walked picket lines with Eastern employees in
the first major public show of support from workers at another
airline. ``Our company has made a moral and economic commitment to
our 50,000 employees' dreams and aspirations,'' said Delta pilot
Michael Foley. ``No one at Eastern has done that.''
   Eastern claims it is losing $4 million a day, but Lorenzo was
quoted in today's Wall Street Journal as predicting the airline
would come out of bankruptcy proceedings with its Atlanta hub and
its operations from the Northeast to Florida and Latin America
intact.
   ``I can't imagine that Eastern isn't going to be a major
(airline) and very similar to what it is today,'' he said.
   Planes departed Sunday with ``relatively light'' passenger loads
from Miami for Bogota, Colombia; Guatemala City; Lima, Peru; Panama
City; Quito, Ecuador; Guayaquil, Ecuador; and San Jose, Costa Rica,
Matell said. Thrice-weekly flights were to resume this week to
Asuncion, Paraguay; Cali, Colombia; and La Paz, Bolivia.
   Eastern also intended to resume thrice-daily flights between
Miami and Puerto Rico today along with service to Montreal, then add
direct flights later this week between Washington and Boston.

   RJR Nabisco Inc. today named American Express
Co.'s president, Louis V. Gerstner Jr., as chairman and chief
executive officer of the cigarette and food giant.
   Gerstner, 47, succeeds F. Ross Johnson, who left the company
following RJR's acquisition earlier this year by buyout specialist
Kohlberg Kravis Roberts &amp; Co. for a record $25 billion.
   Johnson, who resigned on Feb. 9, had led a competing takeover bid.
   Gerstner's appointment follows reports that RJR had been courting
baseball commissioner Peter Ueberroth and Kraft Inc. President
Michael Miles for the job.
   Although Gerstner lacks experience in manufacturing, executives
familiar with his 11-year tenure at New York-based American Express
said his strong management skills made him a good choice to run RJR
through its current transition.
   ``Lou's new job is one of the most challenging in the corporate
world, and I believe he is uniquely qualified for it,'' said
American Express Chairman James D. Robinson III.
   KKR founding partner Henry R. Kravis cited Gerstner's
``distinguished record of leadership at an organization of
comparable size and quality to RJR Nabisco.''
   Gerstner joined American Express in 1978 as president of the
American Express Card Division, and the next year was named
president of the Travel Related Services Group, responsible for
American Express cards, travelers checks and travel service offices.
   When Travel Related Services became a subsidiary of the company
in 1982, Gerstner became its first chairman and chief executive
officer. He became president of the parent company in 1985.
   During Gerstner's career at American Express, the company's card
membership rose from 8.6 million to 30.7 million, and the company
introduced its popular Platinum and Optima American Express cards.
   Gerstner said he was ``delighted to take the helm of a company
with such a rich history as RJR Nabisco.'' He promised to ``work to
further improve the company, grow it, and make it a creative and
exciting place to work.''
   Among RJR Nabisco's operating companies are R.J. Reynolds
Tobacco, Nabisco Brands, Del Monte Foods and Planters LifeSavers.
   Robinson said he will assume the additional duties of president
after Gerstner's departure.
   American Express also announced that Aldo Papone, president and
chief operating officer of Travel Related Services will replace
Gerstner as chief executive officer.

   Hundreds of people who bought $12 tickets on Eastern Airline's
Northeast shuttle headed home this morning, one day late, after
getting stranded in three cities when there were no bargain-basement
seats for them on planes.
   ``Nightmare of nightmares,'' was how Catherine Holtz, 24,
described her night sleeping on the carpet at New York's LaGuardia
Airport before she returned home to Boston today. ``I'm not so sure
if it was worth it. It was a good idea in theory.''

<HEAD>Trustcorp Takes $35.9 Loss On Downtown Investments</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOLEDO, Ohio (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Trustcorp Inc., citing losses on downtown
Toledo projects and other real-estate ventures, announced today that
it would write-off $35.9 million.
   It was the second time in less than three months that the bank
holding company has had to write-off riverfront investments. In
January, the corporation said it would write-off $40.7 million in
connection with loans it had made toward redevelopment in downtown
Toledo.
   A statement released today by the company said the new charges
are ``centered principally in commercial real-estate loans in Toledo
and elsewhere.''
   ``The corporation's financial position remains strong and the
long-term prospects are solid'' despite the charge-offs for bad
loans and loan-loss reserves, said George Haigh, chairman of the $6
billion bank holding company.
   The company did not specify which loans in its portfolio would be
written down or written off.
   The company also said it has rescheduled its annual shareholders'
meeting for June 28. The meeting had been scheduled for April 13,
but was postponed because of a management shake-up last month.
   Several telephone messages left for Katherine Rotte, Trustcorp's
vice president of corporate public affairs, were not returned today.
   In late February, Trustcorp announced a reorganization of its
management because of soured downtown investments. Five officals
retired or were fired in the management shake-up.
   Before the management changes, Trustcorp had announced that it
had formed a committee of outside directors to review the adequacy
of its loan-loss reserves, chargeoffs, and commercial real estate
practices.
   The committee was formed in conjunction with a similar review
being conducted by a federal regulatory agency.
   Banking analysts have said that Trustcorp loaned too much money
to downtown redevelopment projects and did not maintain proper
reserves to cover losses on failing ventures.
   Some analysts also have said that Trustcorp is ripe for a
takeover because of the management changes and bad investments.
   Trustcorp Inc. has offices in Ohio, Michigan, Indiana and Florida.

   The stock market rose sharply today, continuing
its rebound from a surprise late last week in the government's
monthly employment report.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials jumped 27.68 points to
2,309.82 by 11 a.m. on Wall Street.

trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 838 up, 378

<HEAD>Federal Judge Blocks Takeover Firm from Calling Stockholder Meeting</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PHILADELPHIA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Centaur Partners has pledged to appeal a
judge's order blocking a special Pennwalt Corp. shareholders meeting
and says it is determined to take over the chemical company.
   A statement issued Sunday by the investment company also said the
group's $110-per-share tender offer, scheduled to expire March 20,
``remains in full force and effect.''
   On Friday, U.S. District Judge Robert S. Gawthrop III declared
Centaur demands for the special meeting invalid. Centaur had hoped
to use the meeting to replace the board of directors with takeover
proponents.
   Centaur had received enough signed demands from stockholders to
force the meeting late this month under state law.
   In invalidating Centaur's call for the special meeting, Gawthrop
cited a provision included in the group's solicitation to
shareholders.
   Centaur, which owns about 13 percent of Pennwalt's outstanding
shares, had said the call would be voided if a court decided the
shareholders were part of a ``controlling group'' of the company.
   Pennwalt opposed the demand for the meeting, arguing the
shareholders were part of a controlling group, as defined by the
state business code, and financially liable to any stockholders
unhappy with the Centaur offer.
   Gawthrop agreed with Pennwalt.
   ``No one is going to risk that,'' said Stuart H. Savett, one of
the attorneys representing shareholders in the case. ``If you are
part of the control group, you may be liable.''
   For Pennwalt, the court ruling was the first significant skirmish
it has won since Centaur made its first tender offer in December.
   In the statement Sunday, Centaur's principals, Abbey J. Butler
and Melvyn J. Estrin, called the ruling a temporary setback.
   Centaur began buying Pennwalt stock last spring. By December, the
investment group announced an offer of $100 a share for the almost 7
million outstanding shares Centaur did not own.
   In February, the group raised its bid by $10. On Friday the stock
closed on the New York Stock Exchange at $118.50, up 50 cents.
   Pennwalt has repeatedly refused to meet with Centaur and has said
it will explore other options that could include the sale of the
company or further restructuring.

<HEAD>Baker Hughes Announces Intent to Sell Mining Equipment Group</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HOUSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Baker Hughes Inc., the Houston-based oilfield
service company, today said it plans to sell its Mining Equipment
Group in what company officials described as a long-anticipated
restructuring move.
   The mining group, made up of six major and several minor
businesses, manufactures underground equipment for the mining
industry.
   For 1988, the group accounted for $227 million out of Baker
Hughes' $2.3 billion in revenue, the company said.
   ``We have been evaluating our position in that (mining) market
for some time,'' Baker Hughes spokesman Ronald G. Turner said today.
   ``When we segregated the businesses about eight to 10 months ago,
it was clearly with the intention of being better able to analyze
this segment,'' Turner said. ``And this was the conclusion based on
that analysis.''
   The mining group includes about 2,000 of Baker Hughes' 22,000
employees worldwide, he said.
   The First Boston Corp. was retained to assist in the divestiture,
and materials about the mining group were expected to be available
in about 30 days, Baker Hughes said.

   The stock market ran up a sharp gain today,
continuing its rebound from a surprise late last week in the
government's monthly employment report.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials jumped 26.07 points to
2,308.21 by noontime on Wall Street.
   Gainers outnumbered losers by about 9 to 5 in nationwide trading
of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 841 up, 449 down and
531 unchanged.
   When the Labor Department reported Friday morning that the
unemployment rate had fallen to a 15-year low in February, stocks
and bonds initially sold off on the news.
   The reasoning was that strains on the capacity of the labor force
might intensify inflationary pressures and tend to push interest
rates higher.
   But stocks began a steady recovery Friday afternoon, finishing
the session with only a moderate loss.
   That apparently encouraged traders, and created a general belief
that the market was ready for a new assault on the 2,300 level,
where it bogged down on two occasions last week.
   Brokers said the market got a boost in that effort from program
traders engaged in multiple strategies involving stock-index futures
and individual stocks.
   Gainers among the blue chips included Philip Morris, up 2{ at
118; American Telephone &amp; Telegraph, up 1 at 31{; General Electric,
up { at 45{, and International Business Machines, up ~ at 119[.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks rose
1.22 to 166.07. At the American Stock Exchange, the market value
index was up 1.40 at 330.32.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 71.19 million shares at noontime,
against 71.60 million at the same point Friday.

<HEAD>General Mills' Earnings Up 15 Percent</HEAD>
<DATELINE>GOLDEN VALLEY, Minn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   General Mills Inc. Monday said its
third-quarter income rose 15.3 percent and per-share profit grew to
a record amount.
   The company reported after-tax earnings of $82.3 million for the
quarter ended Feb. 26, up from $71.4 million a year earlier.
   On a per-share basis, earnings hit a record $1, compared with 83
cents a share during the same period a year earlier. The record
coincided with a decline in the number of outstanding shares from
86.5 million a year ago to 82.2 million shares, Chairman Bruce
Atwater said.
   Sales in the quarter grew 17 percent to $1.45 billion from $1.24
billion the year before.
   Atwater said the increases in the 13-week period ended Feb. 26
reflect strengths in Big G cereals and Red Lobster and The Olive
Garden restaurants. He said cereals have experienced a 19 percent
unit volume gain and 105 new restaurants have opened in the past 12
months.
   Restaurants led the company's third quarter operating performance
with gains in sales and operating profits of 33 percent and 63
percent, respectively, Atwater said.
   Established Red Lobster restaurants showed average unit sales
gains of 14 percent. In the previous quarter, 27 Seafood Broiler
units in Southern California were converted to Red Lobster
restaurants. The conversions cost about $200,000 a restaurant.
   The Olive Garden Italian restaurants opened 14 new units in the
third quarter, bringing the total to 131 in 21 states compared to 75
at the end of last year's third quarter.
   Consumer Foods third-quarter sales and operating profits grew 12
percent and 10 percent, respectively. Volume increased 7 percent in
the third quarter, with more than 80 percent of the gain coming from
established oat-based cereals such as Cheerios and new products,
Atwater said.

<HEAD>Coastal Corp. Extends Tender Offer for Texas Eastern Stock</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HOUSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Coastal Corp. officials said today they have again
extended a $2.6 billion offer for Texas Eastern Corp. outstanding
stock, the second extension since Texas Eastern agreed to be
acquired by rival suitor Panhandle Eastern Corp.
   The cash tender offer now will expire March 31, unless it is
further extended, Coastal said. The original expiration date was
Feb. 13.
   Also today, Panhandle Eastern said five co-manager banks have
committed to provide $2 billion in financing for its acquisition of
Texas Eastern. Manufacturers Hanover Trust Co. already had agreed to
provide $500 million.
   The battle for Texas Eastern began Jan. 16, when Coastal
announced its surprise takeover bid. But the Texas Eastern board
rejected the offer as too low, signing the merger agreement with
Panhandle Eastern on Feb. 21.
   Panhandle Eastern's $3.2 billion offer includes provisions to buy
up to 80 percent of Texas Eastern's 60.8 million outstanding shares
and a stock exchange at the same $53-a-share value for the remaining
shares.
   The combination of the two Houston-based natural gas companies
would create a 27,000-mile system and result in the nation's
second-largest pipeline company in terms of miles, officials said.
   Coastal spokesman R.W. Wells said Monday that despite the
apparent finality of the Panhandle Eastern deal, Coastal remains
poised for a takeover with its $42-a-share offer.
   ``You've heard the old expression, `There's many a slip between
cup and mouth.' We're just keeping it alive in case something
happens,'' Wells said.
   Separately, Panhandle Eastern said it met last week in Houston
with about 60 financial institutions, including Manufacturers
Hanover and the five co-managing banks: Bank of America National
Trust and Savings Association, Chase Manhatten Bank, Chemical Bank,
Continental Bank N.A. and Morgan Guaranty Trust Co. of New York.
   The combined $2.5 billion commitment amounts to 68 percent of the
bank financing needed for the acquisition, Panhandle Eastern said.

<TEXT>
   Share prices on the London Stock Exchange jumped
sharply Monday, closing at a new post-crash peak in a burst of
enthusiasm before Tuesday's fiscal 1990 budget speech by Chancellor
of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson.
   Trading activity was light, however, as institutional players
remained sidelined in the runup to the budget speech, one of
Britain's major economic events of the year.
   Equities were primarily driven higher as Wall Street rose
strongly in early business.
   At the close, the Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index
was up 17.8 points, or 0.9 percent, at 2,103.0, its best level for
the day and its best post-crash close since reaching 2,096.2 on Feb.
8.
   At its lowest level Monday, the index was down 4 points at the
opening.
   The Financial Times 30-share index was up 14.5 points at 1,739.4
at the close. The Financial Times 500-share index rose 10.61 points
to close at 1,201.05.
   Volume was light, however, as 496 million shares changed hands,
down sharply from Friday's 655 million shares.

<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The U.S. dollar drifted higher in uninspired
European trading Monday as dealers awaited some key economic data
from Britain and the United States.
   Gold prices fell.
   ``There was no enthusiasm in the market at all,'' said Martin
Ely, a chief foreign exchange dealer at Midland Bank. ``People do
wish to buy dollars, but they are also worried about central-bank
intervention at higher levels.''
   Another dealer said, ``People are squaring their positions ahead
of the figures due out later this week.''
   On Tuesday, British Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson is
scheduled to present the spring federal budget to Parliament, and
the U.S. Commerce Department reports the fourth-quarter current
account trade balance.
   Dealers said they were heading into the week in a fairly bullish
mood. They said the dollar has been driven by technical factors over
the past few weeks, and that the technical factors continue to point
toward a higher dollar.
   In London, the dollar gained against the British pound. It cost
$1.7125 to buy one pound, cheaper than $1.7159 dollars Friday.
   Other late dollar rates in Europe, compared with late Friday:
1.8669 West German marks, up from 1.8629; 1.5965 Swiss francs, up
from 1.5918; 6.3230 French francs, up from 6.3185; 2.1040 Dutch
guilders, up from 2.1020; 1,367.40 Italian lire, up from 1,366.00;
and 1.1981 Canadian dollars, down from 1.1987.
   In Tokyo, where trading ends before Europe's business day begins,
the dollar rose 0.69 yen to a closing 129.57 yen. Later, in London,
it was quoted at 129.86 yen.
   Gold fell in London to a late bid price of $392.25 a troy ounce,
compared with late Friday's $393.25. In Zurich, gold fell to a
closing bid of $392.75 an ounce, compared with $393.50 bid late
Friday.
   Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold fell 30 cents to close at a bid
$394.85 an ounce.
   Silver bullion prices rose in London to a late bid price of $6.02
a troy ounce from $6.00 Friday.

<HEAD>Sears Cutting Back on In-Store Outlets for Financial Services, Real
Estate</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Sears, Roebuck and Co. will significantly reduce
the in-store presence of both its financial services and real estate
operations, but expand its insurance outlets, a spokesman said today.
   The number of Dean Witter Reynolds financial service outlets in
Sears, Roebuck stores will be reduced by half _ from about 300 to
about 150 _ and virtually all the Coldwell Banker real estate
offices in about 220 stores will be converted into marketing and
referral booths, said Sears spokesman Doug Fairweather.
   Operations at the company's 824 in-store Allstate Insurance
offices will be bolstered, however, he said.
   Sears, the nation's largest retailer, recently underwent a round
of cost-cutting and adopted a low pricing policy in an effort to
regain market share. Fairweather said there would be few savings in
this latest move.
   ``The way in which we cover these markets has simply changed,''
he said.
   ``We've already experienced a very, very sharp growth since
getting both Dean Witter and Coldwell Banker at the end of 1981. Now
that they're on the map, it makes more sense to emphasize the local
offices as the places to do business and use the store space just
for referrals.''
   Dean Witter has expanded to a total of 650 outlets from just 350
when Sears first acquired it, and the number of account executives
has grown to 8,000 from 4,800. Coldwell Banker has increased from
about 413 offices in 73 residential markets to nearly 2,100 in 298
markets.
   ``In financial services, you do most of your business on the
phone. And most people go to a neighborhood office when they're
looking to buy a house,'' Fairbanks said.
   ``Insurance seems to be the one business where both the timing
and paperwork factors still make an in-store outlet an efficient
service,'' he said.
   Fairweather said there would be a ``minimal'' effect on both
personnel and Sears' bottom line as a result of the changes.
   ``Most of the people who staffed the in-store offices came one
day or so each week from a local office anyway,'' he said. ``Now,
they'll just be spending more time at the other office.''

<BYLINE>American Express' Gerstner Named New RJR Chief Executive</BYLINE>
<HEAD>LaserPhoto AX10</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARC RICE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Louis V. Gerstner Jr., the president of American
Express Co., was named Monday as chairman and chief executive
officer of RJR Nabisco Inc., the food and tobacco giant that became
the prize in an epic takeover battle last year.
   Analysts said Gerstner's immediate tasks would include addressing
RJR's declining domestic tobacco market share and giving its
employees a sense of direction in the wake of the takeover, which
heaped billions of dollars in new debt on the company.
   RJR Nabisco agreed to the record $24.53 billion leveraged buyout
by the firm Kohlberg Kravis Roberts &amp; Co. following a bitter fight
against a group led by former RJR chief executive F. Ross Johnson.
   Gerstner, 47, faces a personal challenge in moving from a giant
financial services company, where he spearheaded such innovations as
the American Express Platinum Card, to a manufacturing company.
   But although Gerstner has little experience in manufacturing,
analysts said, his administrative and marketing skills should ease
his move into RJR Nabisco.
   ``A background...in a specific industry is immaterial,'' said
Lawrence Adelman, a tobacco industry analyst with Dean Witter
Reynolds in New York. ``What's more important is being a good
manager.''
   ``Obviously, it's a different business. But my understanding is
(Gerstner) is a very marketing-driven person,'' said Marc Cohen, an
analyst with Sanford C. Bernstein in New York. ``Some of that is
transferrable.''
   Gerstner joined American Express in 1978 as president of the
American Express Card Division. The next year he was named president
of the Travel Related Services Group, responsible for American
Express cards, travelers checks and travel service offices.
   When Travel Related Services became a subsidiary of the company
in 1982, Gerstner became its first chairman and chief executive
officer. He became president of American Express in 1985.
   During Gerstner's career at American Express, the company's card
membership rose from 8.6 million to 30.7 million and the company
introduced its popular Platinum charge card and American Express
Optima credit card.
   Cohen said Gerstner probably should decide quickly what changes,
if any, should be made at RJR due to the buyout. The company already
has indicated it would sell some lines of business to deal with
antitrust concerns raised by the federal government but the extent
of any further restructuring _ which could involve other
divestitures or employee cuts _ largely is unknown.
   ``I would think those moves must become clarified as soon as
possible to comfort the employees who might be involved,'' Cohen
said. ``He's got to calm the troops and give a sense of direction.
That's an issue there.''
   Gerstner also must develop strategies to address RJR's loss in
tobacco market share, Cohen said.
   Cohen said RJR's market share dropped to 31.8 percent in 1988
from 32.5 percent in 1987. Had RJR maintained its market share, it
would have meant almost another $125 million in revenue, he said.
   But Adelman said RJR's decline did not represent a ``panic''
situation.
   ``He's not walking into a troubled situation,'' Adelman said.
   KKR partner Henry R. Kravis, making the announcement Monday,
cited Gerstner's ``distinguished record of leadership at an
organization of comparable size and quality to RJR Nabisco.''
   Gerstner issued a statement saying he was ``delighted to take the
helm of a company with such a rich history as RJR Nabisco.'' He
promised to ``work to further improve the company, grow it, and make
it a creative and exciting place to work.''
   Gerstner was not immediately available for further comment.
   Among RJR Nabisco's operating companies are R.J. Reynolds
Tobacco, Nabisco Brands, Del Monte Foods and Planters LifeSavers.
   American Express Chairman James D. Robinson III said he would
assume the additional duties of president at American Express after
Gerstner's departure.
   American Express also announced that Aldo Papone, president and
chief operating officer of Travel Related Services, would replace
Gerstner as chief executive officer.

<HEAD>European Finance Ministers Welcome U.S. Plan on Third World Debt</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SALLY JACOBSEN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   European finance ministers Monday
welcomed the new strategy offered by U.S. Treasury Secretary
Nicholas Brady to deal with the staggering foreign debts of
developing nations.
   The ministers of the 12-nation European Economic Community,
however, put off endorsing the plan until they had time to study it
further.
   ``It is a turning point,'' said Spanish Finance Minister Carlos
Solchaga. ``It is a change in the way we deal with the debt
problem.''
   He said the developed nations will have to work with poorer
nations on a case-by-case basis to help solve the problem, which
will require ``a lot of imagination ... and cooperation.''
   The ministers, meeting in a regular monthly session, issued a
statement saying they agreed with Brady that ``the problem contains
economic, political and social elements and welcomed the openness of
his approach.''
   They said they ``considered with interest the suggestions''
offered by Brady and ``agreed that they merited thorough study.''
   Brady's proposal marks a major shift in U.S. debt policy by
calling for an approach that emphasizes debt forgiveness to deal
with the massive problem. It endorses voluntary efforts on the part
of commercial banks to forgive part of the $400 billion they are
owed by the big debtor countries, such as Brazil, Mexico and
Venezuela.
   It also calls on the International Monetary Fund and the World
Bank, sister financing agencies, to help provide guarantees for the
remaining debt owed by poorer countries.
   The United States had been following the Baker Plan, which
opposed writing off the Third World's debts to foreign creditors.
Instead, it urged commercial banks to boost their lending to poorer
nations which agreed to make major changes in their economies, for
example, by fighting inflation or bolstering a weak currency. The
plan was drawn up in 1985 by then-Treasury Secretary James Baker,
who is currently secretary of state.
   The finance officials said that ``voluntary debt or debt service
reduction on a case-by-case basis can play an important role in the
success of sound economic plans.''
   They also urg if necessary, ake changes in their regulatory and
fiscal rules, if necessary, to enable commercial banks to reduce the
debts.
   Solchaga noted that in many industrialized countries, there are
no regulations that would allow commercial banks to forgive the
debts. Such measures should be adopted, he said, so the debt problem
can be solved more easily.
   The ministers' statement also said developing countries must
adopt ``deep economic reform'' policies if their economies are to
expand at a lasting pace.
   ``Efforts to reverse capital flight must be strengthened,'' it
said. ``Both targets will include and be buttressed by increased
openness of markets. Industrial countries should similarly ensure

   The ministers' statement will be part of discussions at the
spring meeting of the International Monetary Fund and World Bank
early next month in Washington.
   The foreign debt of developing countries registered a staggering
$1.3 trillion at the end of 1988. Brazil is the Third World's
largest debtor with $110 billion in loans, followed by Mexico with
$107 billion.

   Grain and soybean futures prices closed higher
Monday on the Chicago Board of Trade.
   Analysts said technical factors _ decisions to buy or sell based
on price-chart relationships _ led to an upswing in the soybean pits
that spilled over into the grains.
   Most of the technical buying Monday was in the May contract,
which has traded in a range of between $7.60 and $7.80 a bushel in
recent sessions. It settled 13 cents higher, closing at $7.82 a
bushel.
   ``I wouldn't make much out of it,'' said one trader. ``We closed
in the $7.80 range plenty of times and haven't gone beyond.''
   Wheat did get some news, and a boost from the hot, dry weather
that swept the growing regions of Texas, Oklahoma and Kansas over
the weekend.
   On the close, wheat was 1{ cents to 4 cents higher, with the
contract for delivery in March at $4.37{ a bushel; corn was \ cent
to 1 cent higher, with March at $2.76 a bushel; oats were 1{ cents
to 2} cents higher, with March at at $2.09 a bushel; and soybeans
were 4 cents to 7{ cents higher, with March at $7.61 a bushel.

   The stock market pushed ahead today, continuing
its rebound from a surprise late last week in the government's
monthly employment report.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials climbed 25.00 points to
2,307.14 by 3 p.m. on Wall Street.
   Gainers outnumbered losers by about 5 to 3 in nationwide trading
of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 877 up, 525 down and
505 unchanged.
   When the Labor Department reported Friday morning that the
unemployment rate had fallen to a 15-year low in February, stocks
and bonds initially sold off on the news.
   The reasoning was that strains on the capacity of the labor force
might intensify inflationary pressures and tend to push interest
rates higher.
   But stocks began a steady recovery Friday afternoon, finishing
the session with only a moderate loss.
   That apparently encouraged traders, and created a general belief
that the market was ready for a new assault on the 2,300 level,
where it bogged down on two occasions last week.
   Brokers said the market got a boost in that effort from program
traders engaged in multiple strategies involving stock-index futures
and individual stocks.
   Gainers among the blue chips included Philip Morris, up 3 at
118{; American Telephone &amp; Telegraph, up ~ at 31]; General Electric,
up { at 45{, and International Business Machines, up } at 119.
   Shaklee jumped 9[ to 47\. The company agreed to be acquired by
Yamanouchi Pharmaceutical Co. for $28 a share after the payment of a
$20 dividend to Shaklee holders scheduled for next week.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks rose
1.22 to 166.07. At the American Stock Exchange, the market value
index was up 1.54 at 330.46.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 114.11 million shares with an
hour to go.

   Ford Motor Co. on Monday recalled more
than a half million 1984 and 1985 Escort, EXP and Lynx automobiles
to check for emission control problems.
   The nation's No. 2 automaker also announced Monday it was
recalling about 57,000 1988 Mercury Tracers to check for worn spark
plug wires or faded bumper covers.
   The company said the cars involved in the emissions recall were
equipped with 1.6-liter engines. Dealerships will make mechanical
changes to vehicles which fail to meet emission standards.
   Cars made for sale in Canada and California aren't subject to the
recall, Ford said.
   Tracers sold in the United States and Canada were recalled to
check for a worn spark plug wire, which can cause poor starting,
engine misfiring, substandard performance and poor fuel economy.
Worn wires will be replaced.
   About 28,200 of the Tracers also will be checked for bumper
covers which have faded from exposure to ultraviolet light. Faded
covers will be replaced with covers with light stabilizers.
   Vehicles owners in each of the recalls will be notified by mail
and repairs will be performed at no cost.

   The settlement reached Monday between the
Justice Department and the Teamsters union removed a huge albatross
from the neck of the nation's largest union _ the unprecedented
threat of being taken over by the federal government.
   Teamsters leaders now can try to settle a bitter internal
dispute, although any such effort could be complicated by provisions
of the settlement giving 1.6 million rank-and-file Teamsters a
direct voice in picking the union's hierarchy.
   For the government, the settlement provided a vehicle through
which it can investigate, with union officials, alleged wrongdoings
by Teamsters and review local union elections, which prosecutors
believe long have been influenced by organized crime.
   Lost by the government was the chance to test whether the scope
of federal racketeering laws includes a government takeover of an
entire union and a rhetorical war in which the former U.S. Attorney
for the southern district of New York, Rudolph Giuliani, accused
Teamsters leaders of making a ``devil's pact'' with the Mafia and
vowed to oust them from their jobs.
   Both sides had reason to claim victory _ the Teamsters for
keeping their union out of court trusteeship and avoiding months of
testimony about its alleged mob ties; the government for winning
dramatic union election reforms that could put the current
leadership at risk when members directly elect a new Teamsters board
in 1991.
   ``We haven't seen all the details as yet but on the surface it
looks good,'' said Ken Paff, the leader of Teamsters for a
Democratic Union, a dissident group that has lobbied for direct
elections. ``It has always been our position that we should use
democracy to clean up any corruption, not government intrusion.''
   The settlement in the suit brought by Giuliani allows all 11
Teamsters who remained as defendants in the case and three others
who settled last week to keep their seats on the union's executive
board, a group still bitterly divided eight months after Jackie
Presser's death brought William McCarthy to the helm of the union
after an intense power struggle.
   That battle was for the most part waged out of the public eye.
   But disputes between McCarthy and his backers and those aligned
with Weldon Mathis, the No. 2 Teamsters official, who lost to
McCarthy despite Presser's endorsement, became public during
pretrial wrangling leading up to Monday's settlement.
   Mathis and two other board members struck settlement deals with
the government last week and at the same time challenged a January
board resolution that prohibited members from settling with the
government if they wanted to keep their seats.
   When called into court by the government to defend the policy,
the McCarthy-led board rescinded it, but not without taking a swipe
at Mathis and the other two by taking the unusual step of releasing
a board resolution calling their actions ``self serving'' and an
impediment to the union's defense.
   That any member of the board would settle defied the statements
of McCarthy, who in the January issue of the union's magazine said
``every single member of the general executive board is committed to
fighting the insulting accusations and personal attacks that have
been leveled against us.''
   Later that month, at a board meeting to discuss an initial
government settlement offer, there were shouting matches between the
feuding factions, according to participants.
   The internal struggle now returns to the secretive Teamsters
board room, where McCarthy has the upper hand of a majority but must
now keep in mind the election reforms.
   The board now is chosen by delegates to Teamsters conventions, a
process the racketeering suit alleged was heavily influenced by
organized crime figures. The settlement gives all union members the
opportunity to vote, by secret ballot, in board elections after
convention delegates nominate candidates.
   ``No matter who wins, he now will have to be responsible to the
membership,'' Paff said.

   Interest rates on short-term Treasury
securities rose in Monday's auction to the highest level in two
weeks.
   The Treasury Department sold $7.2 billion in three-month bills at
an average discount rate of 8.69 percent, up from 8.65 percent last
week. Another $7.2 billion was sold in six-month bills at an average
discount rate of 8.76 percent, up from 8.66 percent last week.
   The rates were the highest since three-month bills sold for 8.73
percent on Feb. 27, and six-month bills averaged 8.77 percent on
Feb. 27.
   The new discount rates understate the actual return to investors
_ 9.01 percent for three-month bills with a $10,000 bill selling for
$9,780.30 and and 9.29 percent for six-month bills selling for
$9,557.10.
   In a separate report, the Federal Reserve said Monday that the
average yield for one-year Treasury bills, the most popular index
for making changes in adjustable rate home mortgages, fell to 9.39
percent last week after averaging 9.40 percent the week before.

   The dollar drifted higher Monday against most key
currencies in quiet worldwide trading as dealers awaited the release
of key economic data.
   Gold prices were mostly lower. Republic National Bank of New York
quoted a bid of $393.00 for a troy ounce of gold as of 4 p.m. EST,
down 50 cents from Friday's late bid.
   Daniel Holland, a vice president at Discount Corp., said internal
market influences were largely responsible for the dollar's advance
but that most dealers were keeping a low profile until economic
reports from the United States, Britain and Japan were released
Tuesday.
   ``The market is a little cautious,'' he said.
   British Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson will present the
spring federal budget to Parliament, the U.S. Commerce Department
reports the fourth-quarter current account trade balance and Japan
releases its latest report on wholesale prices.
   Dealers said sentiment toward the dollar remained fairly bullish,
although worries of possible central-bank intervention kept trading
in a fairly narrow range.
   In Tokyo, where trading ends before Europe's business day begins,
the dollar rose 0.69 yen to 129.57 yen. It was quoted at 129.86 yen
in London, and later in New York it stood at 130.175 yen, up from
129.40 Friday.
   The dollar gained against the British pound. It cost $1.7125 to
buy one pound in London, cheaper than $1.7159 Friday. In New York,
sterling fetched $1.71295, down from $1.7177.
   Other late dollar rates in New York compared with late Friday
included: 1.8675 West German marks, up from 1.86175; 1.5970 Swiss
francs, up from 1.58975; 1.19815 Canadian dollars, down from
1.19865; 6.32625 French francs, up from 6.3140; and 1,369.25 Italian
lire, up from 1,366.75.
   Late dollar rates in Europe compared with Friday: 1.8669 West
German marks, up from 1.8629; 1.5965 Swiss francs, up from 1.5918;
6.3230 French francs, up from 6.3185; 2.1040 Dutch guilders, up from
2.1020; 1.1981 Canadian dollars, down from 1.1987; and 1,367.40
Italian lire, up from 1,366.00.
   On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold bullion for current
delivery closed at $394.40 a troy ounce, up from Friday's $394.30.
   Gold fell in London to a late bid price of $392.25 an ounce,
compared with late Friday's $393.25. In Zurich, gold fell to a
closing bid of $392.75 an ounce, compared with $393.50 bid late
Friday.
   Earlier in Hong Kong gold fell 30 cents to close at a bid $394.85
an ounce. Silver prices gained. On New York's Comex, silver bullion
for current delivery settled at $6.078 a troy ounce, up from $6.068
Friday. Silver rose in London to a late bid price of $6.02 a troy
ounce, up 2 cents from Friday.

   The stock market rallied Monday, rebounding from
the jolt of an unexpectedly strong employment report late last week.
   Trading remained relatively quiet, however.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials rose 24.11 points to a
three-week high of 2,306.25.
   Advancing issues outnumbered declines by about 3 to 2 in
nationwide trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed stocks, with
878 up, 574 down and 508 unchanged.
   Volume on the floor of the Big Board came to 140.40 million
shares, against 146.83 million in the previous session. Nationwide,
consolidated volume in NYSE-listed issues, including trades in those
stocks on regional exchanges and in the over-the-counter market,
totaled 165.84 million shares.
   When the Labor Department reported Friday morning that the
unemployment rate had fallen to a 15-year low in February, stocks

   The reasoning was that strains on the capacity of the labor force
might intensify inflationary pressures and tend to push interest

   Gainers among the blue chips included Philip Morris, up 3\ at

   Shaklee jumped 9\ to 47]. The company agreed to be acquired by

   Shaklee shares trading on when-issued basis without the dividend

   DWG Corp., the most active issue on the American Stock Exchange,

   Duriron fell 1 to 22\ in the over-the-counter market. The company
projected higher profits in 1989 but said it doesn't expect growth
to match its 143 percent rise last year.
   As measured by Wilshire Associates' index of more than 5,000

   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks added

   Fliers who took advantage of Eastern Airlines' $12
shuttle fare this weekend took risks along with the strike-torn
airline, industry analysts said Monday.
   The slashed fare lured more passengers than Eastern had bargained
for, stranding hundreds of people in airports in New York, Boston
and Washington.
   But, analysts noted, all bargains include risks. And for Eastern
owner Frank Lorenzo, this one was better than the spectre of flying
his airline with empty seats.
   ``Eastern had to get the consumer back. Even though it did
inconvenience people, it was worth it,'' said Paul Karos, airline
analyst at First Boston Corp. in New York.
   Although one-way fares went up to $49 this week starting Monday,
Eastern said it would honor through Friday the $12 tickets sold over
the weekend. After Friday, prices will return to the normal $69 on
weekends, and $99 on weekdays and Sunday evening.
   The cut-rate weekend fare in effect Friday through Sunday was
intended to show the airline is still in business despite the 10-day
old walkout by Eastern Machinists and the sympathy of most pilots.
While it drew 31,500 passengers, many were as surprised as Eastern
when it ran out of seats to take the bargain hunters home.
   An estimated 550 people were unexpectedly grounded Sunday in the
three cities linked by the shuttle.
   Created by Eastern in 1961, the shuttle normally offers hourly
service between Boston, New York and Washington. Pan Am Corp., which
runs a rival shuttle between the three cities, did not match
Eastern's special fare.
   Seats can't be reserved on either the Eastern or Pan Am shuttle,
but they are normally guaranteed, even if it means wheeling out
another plane.
   But with last weekend's unusual deal, Eastern warned in advance
that there would be no backup flights, although the crush forced the
airline to bring out its biggest jets and five backup flights.
Anyone unable to return on the weekend was allowed to fly home free
through Wednesday as long as they took an Eastern flight between 10
a.m. and 3 p.m. EST.
   The gimmick went down well with some industry observers.
   ``They wanted to provoke a public reaction and they did, they
just didn't think deeply about it,'' said Mark Daugherty, airline
analyst with Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. in New York.
   ``Buyer beware whenever there is a good deal; the buyer has to
assume a certain amount of risk,'' he said.
   Flying full planeloads on Eastern's shuttle also helps keep up
appearances for real estate developer Donald Trump, Daugherty
suggested.
   Trump agreed in October to buy the Eastern shuttle and is
awaiting clearance for the $365 million deal from a bankruptcy judge
since Eastern filed for Chapter 11 protection from creditors last
Thursday.
   Bruce Nobles, president of Trump Shuttle Inc., liked the bargain
fare. ``It was a smart idea in this circumstance,'' Nobles said from
his New York office.

<HEAD>Software Stores Aren't Just Appealing To Techies</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PETER COY</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   If you want to open a software store in the big
city, it helps to have a background in selling shoes. Or groceries.
Or clothing. Or arts and crafts, for that matter.
   Personal computers aren't just for techies anymore, and software
retailers have learned that if they want to sell to a mass market,
they have to adopt the marketing techniques that work for more
mundane products.
   Software Etc. is carrying that concept to new heights this week
with a hype-filled store opening on Manhattan's Fifth Avenue that
was heralded Monday with ads covering the back pages of all four
sections of the New York Times.
   Analysts described Software Etc.'s splash as a sortie in its
escalating battle for market share with rival Egghead Inc., which
runs Egghead Discount Software stores.
   ``This used to be a ma-and-pa industry. Now it's just so
competitive. These companies need to create market dominance,'' said
Teresa Y. Lotzgesell, an analyst at Ragen MacKenzie Inc. in Seattle.
   Among the celebrities scheduled to make appearances at Software
Etc.'s opening this week were William Gates, chairman and co-founder
of Microsoft Corp.; Earl Weaver, former Baltimore Orioles manager;
Andrew Tobias, personal finance writer; Roger Rabbit, the toon; and
``Hacksaw'' Jim Duggan of the World Wrestling Federation.
   The Amazing Kreskin, self-proclaimed mind reader, appeared
Monday. So did Major ``Wild Bill'' Stealey of MicroProse Software,
who demonstrated his flight simulation software on a video wall made
of 16 television screens in a 4-by-4 array.
   The crowds, reminiscent of a good day at Bloomingdale's, warmed
the hearts of the retail-minded executives of Software Etc.
   ``We can't wipe the grins off our faces,'' said Jordan Levy, who
joined the company last year as director of marketing. ``This is
like a real retail store, not like a computer store.''
   Software-only stores scarcely existed in the early 1980s, but
they are catching on quickly, in part because their bulk buying
allows them to offer low prices and take business away from other
outlets, such as computer hardware stores.
   The proliferation of software titles demands the kind of shelf
space that is only available in a software-only shop. Software Etc.
said its Fifth Avenue shop carries more than 2,000 titles, from
desktop publishing to video games.
   According to a survey of large companies by Computer Reseller
Newslast year, about 40 percent of the personal computer software
they bought was through software-only stores, while 27 percent was
through computer hardware stores, 7 percent was by mail order and 7
percent was direct from the software publishers.
   Software Etc. has the most outlets of any chain _ about 240 _
while Egghead leads in revenue.
   Egghead is a public company based in Issaquah, Wash., while
Minneapolis-based Software Etc. is privately held and does not
announce sales or profit figures. Smaller chains include Software
City, Babbage's and Walden Software.
   All the store chains are increasing the support they give
customers, such as having full-time people demonstrating software.
That's part of the user-friendly attitude, which is subsidized in
some cases by the software publishers.
   The top people in the chains are retailers, not technologists. At
Egghead, chairman and founder Victor D. Alhadeff used to sell shoes
at a Seattle department store, while president and chief executive
Stuart M. Sloan also holds down a job as chairman of an upscale
supermarket chain.
   At Software Etc., Levy used to sell computers wholesale. Stan
Hirshman, the vice president of store operations, used to work at
Banana Republic, the Gap and T.J. Maxx. And Dick Fontaine, the
president and chief executive, came from B. Dalton Booksellers and
Michaels Stores, a Dallas-based retailer of arts and crafts and

<HEAD>Plan Proposed for Dealing With Real Estate of Failed S&amp;Ls</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   White House and Treasury Department officials
are reviewing a plan to protect fragile regional economies from the
quick sale of billions of dollars of real estate repossessed from
failed savings and loans.
   The plan was developed by former Deputy Treasury Secretary R.T.
McNamar, who presented it to Bush administration officials last week.
   According to an outline prepared by McNamar and obtained by The
Associated Press, it would create state or local Real Estate
Liquidation Trusts. The trusts would issue bonds, backed partly by
the federal government and partly by state or local governments, and
use the money to buy distressed S&amp;Ls' real estate from the federal
government.
   The trusts would be independent of local government and would
hire staff who would manage the properties with the goal of selling
them at the highest price possible over 10 to 15 years. Trust
managers' compensation would be based on long-term performance of
the properties under their care.
   White House and Treasury Department officials on Monday did not
immediately return telephone calls seeking comment. McNamar, who
started a merchant banking firm in Los Angeles after leaving the
Reagan administration, said in a telephone conversation, ``These are
just some preliminary ideas we've been working on. They are very
consistent with President Bush's program and may or may not be
useful.''
   The McNamar proposal could be warmly received from members of
Congress from energy-producing states such as Texas, where
already-weak real estate markets could be driven into a tailspin by
the quick sale of repossessed property.
   Sen. Timothy Wirth, a Democrat from Colorado, where savings
institutions and local economies have been hard hit by energy-price
problems, said he had not reviewed the plan, but he said it could
prove to be a worthwhile mechanism for holding real estate off
distressed markets.
   ``It's imperative that the authority given to the (S&amp;L
liquidators) include safeguards against property dumping. Clearly
this has to be left to the discretion of (federal regulators) but
they have to understand the fragility of some economies,'' he said
in a telephone interview Monday.
   According to Wirth, S&amp;L regulators now control about $7.5 billion
in repossessed property. Jerome Blank of the National Association of
Realtors told the Senate Banking Committee on Friday that after all
insolvent S&amp;Ls are closed or sold to new owners ``the U.S.
government ... will become the largest landowner in the United
States and will have to dispose of over $150 billion in real
estate.''
   Other legislators, particularly in the House, may not welcome the
McNamar proposal. Members of the House Banking Committee over the
past year and a half have bitterly complained about the performance
and quasi-private structure of the Federal Asset Disposition
Association, an agency set up by S&amp;L regulators to manage
repossessed real estate and bad loans.
   Critics say real estate disposal is best handled by a government
agency less subject to industry influence and directly under the
oversight of Congress. The McNamar outline would put the real estate
outside the direct control of the federal government.
   Bush's plan for restoring the savings and loan industry calls for
selling $50 billion in bonds over the next 2{ years and using the
money to sell or merge insolvent institutions.
   McNamar would use a portion to ``credit enhance'' some portion,
perhaps 20 percent, of the local real estate trust bonds, which
would also be backed to a similar extent by the sponsoring state or
local government.
   The rest of the interest and principal would be paid off by
selling the repossessed real estate. But the proposed mechanism
would allow 10 to 15 years to sell the property, while the Bush
plan, as it stands, would sell all property within five years.

   Crude oil futures prices surged to a seven-week
high in moderate trading Monday amid reports that fire forced the
shutdown of a major Norwegian oil-producing complex in the North Sea.
   On the New York Mercantile Exchange, the April contract for West
Texas Intermediate, the benchmark grade of crude oil, jumped 53
cents to close at $19.03 a barrel. The last time the near-month
contract closed above $19 a barrel was on Jan. 19, when it closed at
$19.28.
   Other contract months also made strong gains Monday, with the May
contract closing 54 cents higher at $18.63 a barrel.
   Product prices continued to rise, breaking through key technical
levels, analysts said.
   The April contract for unleaded gasoline rose 1.38 cents to
settle at 53.16 cents a gallon, while heating oil rose 1.16 cents to
close at 52.35 cents a gallon. Other contract months also posted
strong gains.
   Analysts said a fire in a crude oil pump unit on a processing
platform forced the closure of Norway's North Sea Ekofisk complex,
including seven crude oil fields.
   The blaze was extinguished quickly but not before damaging
surrounding cables and forcing the shutdown, analysts said.
   The seven fields produce an average of 250,000 barrels a day of
crude oil and about 1 billion cubic feet of gas.
   Phillips Petroleum Co. of Norway, which operates the complex,
indicated the complex could be reopened within the next few days.
   ``It was a strong day,'' said Jim Fiedler, vice president in
charge of energy brokering for E.D.&amp;F. Man International Futures
Inc. ``Fundamental news about Ekofisk moved the market. But there
was an underlying strength before that.''
   Traders said prices picked up steam as they broke through key
technical levels that the market had resisted in recent weeks.
   Demand for oil products, particularly heating oil, have posted
gains recently and continued strong in the wake of reports that
European refiners were reducing refinery runs and product
inventories.

<HEAD>Crude Oil Futures Make Big Gains, Break Key Resistance Levels</HEAD>

   Crude oil futures climbed Monday, including a late surge as the
April contract for the benchmark West Texas intermediate grade
smashed through two key resistance levels and closed above $19.
   On other markets, copper took a pounding following reports that
stocks at the London Mercantile Exchange rose rather than declined
from the previous week; grain and soybean futures posted modest
gains on technical buying and spillover strength; and frozen pork
belly futures continued drifting lower as the underlying cash market
hit nine-year lows.
   The energy futures runup began with reports that operations at
Norway's fire-damaged Ekofisk complex in the North Sea _ which
produces about 250,000 barrels of oil daily _ would be down for at
least another day.
   Additional support came when non-OPEC oil-producing nations _
whose share of the world market exceeds OPEC's _ announced plans to
unilaterally cut another 290,000 barrels from their daily output.
   ``Admittedly, those were small bits of news, but there's been
strength underpinning for the market for a while,'' said Jim
Ritterbusch, vice president of trading and research for
Chicago-based Carson Petroleum Co.
   When the April contract topped $18.92, last year's high, it set
off one wave of technical buying _ a decision based on chart-price
comparisons _ and another wave followed when the market crashed a
second important resistance level at $19.
   Ritterbusch said he believes the energy futures will continue to
rise.
   ``The last time we got to $19 was almost two months ago, and that
was because there was a trading squeeze on when the time came time
for delivery of the Feburary contract. This is a little different.
   ``Whenever you set new highs in an uptrend,'' he added, ``the
line of least resistance is to the upside.''
   Crude oil settled 7 cents to 53 cents higher on
better-than-average volume on the New York Mercantile Exchange, with
the contract for delivery in April at $19.03 a barrel. Heating oil,
which also managed contract highs in the nearby months, were .72
cent to 1.16 cents higher, with April at 52.35 cents a gallon; and
unleaded gasoline was .90 cent to 1.77 cents higher, with April at
53.16 cents a gallon.
   Copper was 3.9 cents to 5.1 cents lower on the Comex, with March
at $1.427 a pound.
   The pressure came with news from London Mercantile Exchange
officials that copper stocks were up 1,775 tons from the previous
week, putting total stocks at 87,525 tons.
   ``That's still a relatively low level,'' said analyst Bette
Raptopoulos of Prudential-Bache Securities Inc. in New York, ``but
some of the trade were looking for a decline. And when no fresh news
came along to buoy it up, it just kept easing (lower).''
   The precious metals, except for platinum, were a model of
consistency. Platinum was $6.80 to $7.60 lower at the New York Merc,
with March at $542.40 a troy ounce. At the Comex, gold was 10 cents
lower to 10 cents higher, with March at $394.40 a troy ounce; silver
was 1 cent to 1.8 cent higher, with March at $6.078 a troy ounce.
   There was little fresh news in the grain or soybean markets, but
technical buying led to an upswing in the soybean pits that spilled
over into the grains.
   Most of the technical buying took place in the May contract,
which had traded in a range between $7.60 and $7.80 a bushel in
recent sessions. It settled 13 cents higher, closing at $7.82.
   Wheat was 2{ cents to 5{ cents higher at the Chicago Board of
Trade, with the contract for delivery in March at $4.38{ a bushel;
corn was } cent to 1{ cents higher, with March at $2.77 a bushel;
oats were 2} cents to 3\ cents higher, with March at at $2.09} a
bushel; and soybeans were 7\ cents to 13 cents higher, with March at
$7.68{ a bushel.
   Livestock futures were mixed and pork futures mostly lower at the
Chicago Mercantile Exchange.
   Live cattle was .45 cent lower to .07 cent higher, with the
contract for delivery in April at 78.12 cents a pound; feeder cattle
were .25 cent lower to .40 cent higher, with March at 81.20 cents a
pound; live hogs were .17 cent lower to .18 cent higher, with April
at 43.62 cents a pound; and frozen pork bellies were .03 cent to .40
cent lower, with March at 38.40 cents a pound.

   The Soviet Union has bought an additional
515,000 metric tons of U.S. wheat at subsidized prices, the
Agriculture Department said Monday.
   Melvin E. Sims, general sales manager for the department's
Foreign Agricultural Service, said the wheat was part of an
authorization on Jan. 25 of more than 2 million tons under the
Export Enhancement Program, or EEP.
   Sims said the wheat is for shipment for April. Only 10,200 tons
are left in the current authorization.
   With the latest sale, the Soviet Union has bought about 4 million
tons of wheat for delivery in the sixth year of a long-term supply
agreement, which was extended last fall to run through Dec. 31, 1990.
   A metric tons is about 2,205 pounds and is equal to 36.7 bushels
of wheat. The 515,000 tons are equal to about 18.9 million bushels
worth around $78 million at recent U.S. farm prices of $4.13 per
bushel.
   The EEP arrangement allows private exporters to sell wheat and
other designated commodities to specified countries at reduced
prices in order to meet foreign competition. The exporters then
collect free government surpluses of grain or other products as
bonuses, or subsidies.
   Sales for delivery in the sixth year of the agreement also
included about 10.2 million tons of corn, along with 450,000 tons of
soybeans, 1.4 million tons of soybean meal, and 507,400 tons of
grain sorghums.
   Sims said the 515,000 tons of wheat were sold by Ferruzzi USA
Inc., 100,000 tons; Cargill Inc., 100,000; Garnac Grain Company
Inc., 75,000; Louis Dreyfus Corp. 40,000; Alfred C. Toepher
International Inc., 50,000; Bunge Corp., 50,000; Gramplex Inc.,
50,000; Mitsubishi International, 25,000; and Continental Grain Co.,
25,000.
   The companies will get subsidies of $22.70 per ton, or about 62
cents per bushel, under the EEP arrangement.

<HEAD>Church's Fried Chicken Revenues Down for 1988</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SAN ANTONIO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Church's Fried Chicken Inc. on Monday posted a
net loss of $16.6 million in the final quarter of 1988 and
attributed the loss partly to the cost of closing unprofitable
stores and coping with a takeover over.
   Church's management agreed last month to be taken over by A.
Copeland Enterprises Inc., the parent of Popeyes Famous Fried
Chicken and Biscuits, for $11 a share in cash and preferred stock.
The tender offer is set to expire March 21.
   Church's loss for the 16-week period ended Dec. 25 contrasted
with a profit of $1.8 million, or 5 cents a share, in the same
period a year earlier. Revenue rose to $128.9 million from $119.8
million a year earlier.
   For the full year, the company had a loss of $14.5 million, in
comparison with a profit of $9.5 million or 26 cents a share a year
earlier. Revenue rose to $419.6 million from $400.5 million a year
earlier.
   Ernest E. Renaud, president and chief executive officer of
Church's, said earnings were affected by higher food costs and
increased operating expenses, plus a provision for revaluation of
properties held for disposal of $20.2 million in the fourth quarter
as a result of closing 109 unprofitable stores with 1988 pre-tax
operating losses of $7.4 million.
   The company also incurred approximately $6.7 million in
investment banking and legal fees related to a tender offer for the
company's shares by Copeland.
   At the end of 1988, Church's operated 998 stores and franchisees
operated 371, a total of 1,369 units. At the end of 1987, Church's
had 1,495 restaurants. The company operated 1,075 units; the
remaining 420 were franchised.

<HEAD>Miller Pulls Ads From College Newspapers Over Sexism Complaints</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MILWAUKEE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Miller Brewing Co. has withdrawn college
newspaper advertising supplements that were intended to capitalize
on the rollicking atmosphere of spring vacation but instead sparked
complaints of sexism.
   More than a million copies of the supplement, titled ``Beachin'
Times,'' were to run in 67 college newspapers across the country to
promote Miller's spring-break welcome centers in Daytona Beach,
Fla., and South Padre Island, Texas.
   But after receiving criticism from some college newspapers and
being censured by the Wisconsin Student Association at the
University of Wisconsin-Madison, Miller announced Feb. 24 it would
withdraw the supplement.
   ``As soon as we heard the reaction, we took immediate steps to
try to stop it,'' said Robert Bertini, a Miller spokesman. But he
said Miller was able to stop the inserts only in 10 papers.
   For the 57 newspapers that already used the supplement, Miller
sent each an apology through a letter to the editor.
   The 16-page insert includes advice to women to ``never trust a
guy who uses an opening line like `That's a great-looking bathing
suit, but it'd look better on my motel room floor.'''
   The supplement has a page on ``Why I are a college student''
gives such reasons as: ``Better than working,'' ``Six years of high
school was enough,'' ``So I can learn to write gooder,'' and
``Unbelievable babes,'' which was listed three times.
   ``We think we blew it in terms of the tone and the content of the
publication,'' Bertini said. ``It was intended as a humorous
takeoff. We did not intend it to be offensive or inappropriate.''
   The insert ran in late February in the Daily Cardinal newspaper
at UW-Madison. The next day, the student association censured Miller
and urged students to boycott Miller products until the
Milwaukee-based company apologized for the material.
   ``Many people in the (WSA) office found it offensive,'' said
Michael Olds, assistant university affairs director for the student
government organization. ``Different women's groups found it
extremely offensive.''

<TEXT>
   A former federal prosecutor and private eye
whose agency was retained by investment banking firm Drexel Burnham
Lambert Inc. misrepresented himself as working for a House
subcommittee investigating corporate takeovers, the subcommittee was
told Monday.
   The allegation before the House Energy ad Commerce Committee's
oversight and investigations subcommittee was made by William G.
Bertain, a Eureka, Calif., lawyer involved in a pending suit over
the 1985 Drexel-assisted takeover of Pacific Lumber Co. by Maxxam
Corp. of Houston.
   Bertain told the subcommittee that John Gibbons, a former
assistant U.S. attorney in California and now a private investigator
for Kroll Associates, had told him on five occasions last year that
he was seeking information about Maxxam's chairman, Charles Hurwitz,
on behalf of a congressional subcommittee.
   In one of the conversations, taped by Bertain at the request of
the subcommittee's staff, Gibbons said he was working for the
oversight and investigations panel, chaired by Rep. John Dingell,
D-Mich., Bertain testified.
   Part of the tape of that conversation in Bertain's office was
played at Monday's hearing, the latest in a series Dingell has held
concerning Drexel's assistance in corporate takeovers by
underwriting high-yield ``junk bonds.''
   Drexel agreed in principle in December to plead guilty to six
charges of securities law violations and pay a record $650 million
fine, largely in connection with its relationship to now-imprisoned
speculator Ivan Boesky.
   The Securities and Exchange Commission also has alleged that
Drexel violated securities laws in Maxxam's takeover of Pacific
Lumber, the largest private holder of redwood timberland in
California.
   The Pacific Lumber takeover was structured by Drexel through a
$300 million bank loan arranged by Irving Trust Co. of New York and
a $450 million junk bond offering sold by Drexel.
   Gibbons declined Monday to answer specific questions from
subcommittee members, saying he had received the panel's subpoena
only a week ago and had not had adequate time to prepare.
   He said he was not aware that his conversation with Bertain in
Bertain's office last Dec. 19 had been taped until this past weekend.
   But Gibbons' boss, Jules Kroll, principal owner of the detective
agency, told reporters after the hearing it is ``totally
inconceivable'' that Gibbons had misrepresented himself and
predicted that he would be vindicated at a continuation of the
hearing next week.
   ``My man was set up by Bertain and others to get our files,''
said Kroll, whose agency specializes in corporate takeover
investigations and includes among its clients several major
investment banking firms in addition to Drexel.
   Included in the subcommittee's subpoena to Gibbons were demands
for copies of any documents regarding Drexel, Boesky, Maxxam,
Hurwitz, five other companies and ``matters involving'' securities
and takeover laws in the Pacific Lumber takeover.
   Last October, Bertain filed a $2.25 billion lawsuit against
Maxxam and Drexel on behalf of former stockholders in Pacific Lumber.
   The subcommittee did not establish Monday that Gibbons was
working for Drexel when he sought Bertain's assistance. Steven
Anreder, a spokesman at Drexel's headquarters in New York, said he
could not establish immediatedly if Gibbons was working on behalf of
his company at the time.
   But Dingell said he would refer to the Justice Department
evidence of anyone representing themselves as working on behalf of
the subcommittee when they were not.

<TEXT>
   After attracting throngs of bargain-hunting
fliers with a $12 Northeast shuttle fare over the weekend,
strike-torn Eastern Airlines could be ready to expand its cut-rate
strategy, observers said Monday.
   But although fare cutting could produce rates as cheap as $49
one-way tickets between New York and Florida, analysts say,
discounts are unlikely to be widespread.
   ``I don't think you're going to see a lot of matching'' by
competitors, said Edward Starkman, an airline analyst for
PaineWebber Inc.
   Like the $12 shuttle fare, further cut-rate ticket promotions
would be an attempt to preserve market share during the crippling
strike by Eastern's Machinists union and walkouts by its pilots and
flight attendants.
   Eastern filed for federal bankruptcy court protection from
creditors last Thursday, citing a cash crisis stemming from the
strike that began March 4.
   Analysts say Eastern's likeliest fare move would be to offer
cheap flights to its primary market of Florida as travelers begin
flocking south for Easter and Spring Break. Industry speculation
points to a $49 one-way ticket between New York and Florida, which
would be about half the prevailing discount fare.
   But experts cautioned that any fare-cutting probably would be
short-lived and unlikely to be matched by Miami-based Eastern's
competitors. Furthermore, some travel agents may refuse to sell the
cheap tickets.
   Eastern's rivals in the lucrative Florida market, notably Delta
Air Lines, already are booked to near capacity on those flights,
Starkman and others said.
   ``We'll have to take a look at each individual (fare) action,''
said Jackie Pate, a spokeswoman for Delta at its Atlanta
headquarters.
   United Airlines spokesman Charlie Lopez in Chicago said that
carrier would reserve judgment until Eastern actually introduced any
new fares.
   Eastern wouldn't say whether it was considering launching the
fares and officials declined to comment on how the airline would
provide enough planes to meet demand if such a promotion was staged.
   Hundreds of passengers were stranded in New York, Washington and
Boston airports Sunday night when Eastern could not get enough
planes in the air to accommodate the throngs that bought $12 shuttle
tickets.
   ``We will approach each market on an individual basis; we have
not indicated what our fare plans are,'' said company spokesman
Robin Matell in Miami.
   If Eastern does slash its Florida fares, some travel agents say
they won't offer the tickets, fearing the risk to passengers of
flying on a strike-bound carrier and a possible deluge of refund
requests if flights are cancelled.
   ``I can't afford to have clients come back to me with
complaints,'' said David Perelman, president of DMS Travel in
Manhattan. ``It's a great deal _ if you can get on a plane.''
   Suzanne Jensen, a spokeswoman for Uniglobe Travel (International)
Inc. in Vancouver, British Columbia, said some of the company's
franchised travel agents would sell the cut-rate tickets only if
customers insisted _ but would not provide refunds.
   Sharply discounted fares have been used in the past by airlines
that have been hit with strikes and wanted to reclaim market share,
analysts said.
   Frank Lorenzo, who controls Eastern and Continental Airlines
through Texas Air Corp., put Continental into bankruptcy in
September 1983, fired striking employees and offered cheap fares to
any destination a few days later.
   Continental remained operating as a low-price carrier, although
the rock-bottom fares were offered only for a few weeks.
   Analysts say they don't expect Eastern to stick with a discount
strategy for long because the company can't afford it.
   ``Eastern has been unprofitable (even) with normal fares,'' said
Louis Marckesano, an airline analyst with Janney Montgomery Scott
Inc. in Philadelphia.
   A $49 one-way fare between New York and Florida would be roughly
the level where Eastern could break even, assuming that planes were
full, Marckesano suggested.

   William Clay Ford Jr., great-grandson of
automobile pioneer Henry Ford, will become head of Ford Motor Co.'s
heavy truck engineering and manufacturing operations in July, the
company said Monday.
   Ford, 31, has been chairman and managing director of Ford of
Switzerland since Sept. 11, 1987. He will return to the United
States in May and take over his new position July 1 when Edward
Mabley retires.
   Ford joined the company in 1979 as a product planning analyst.
His father, Ford Vice Chairman William Clay Ford, retires from the
company at the end of this month. Both are members of Ford's board
of directors.
   The company also announced Monday that vice presidents Walter
Hayes and James Bakken will retire May 1.
   Hayes, now vice chairman of Ford of Europe, was elected a Ford
vice president in 1977. His most recent U.S. assignment was as vice
president for public affairs from 1980-84.
   Bakken also was elected a Ford vice president in 1977. He has
been vice president for corporate quality since last year.
   Hayes and Bakken have their 65th birthdays next month.

   The state petroleum monopoly Pemex has
canceled a leasing contract with a private Mexican company and
announced it will build up its own fleet of oil tankers.
   The board of directors of Petroleos Mexicanos, S.A., decided to
cancel the contract with Flota Petrolera Mexicana S.A. at a late
Sunday meeting because they aren't consistent with current policy,
the oil company said in a press release published in Monday's
newspapers. It offered no further explanation.
   But the independent newspaper Excelsior quoted unnamed sources as
saying cancelation followed ``a series of irregularities observed
recently'' with that company. An editorial in the government
newspaper El Nacional linked it with accusations of corruption
within the petroleum monopoly and its union.
   Neither newspaper went into details.
   Flota Petrolera Mexicana S.A., owned by Isidoro Rodriguez, a
businessman with close ties to several former Pemex directors, had
been leasing two tankers to Pemex since Nov. 29, 1985.
   The powerful Oil Workers Union has claimed the contract leasing
the tankers Antonio J. Bermudez and Antonio Dovali Jaime, signed
shortly before Mario Ramon Beteta stepped down as Pemex director to
run for government of Mexico state, was illegal.
   Union leader Joaquin Hernandez Galicia claimed the lease price of
$19.5 million each was too high and corruption was involved. Beteta
denied any wrongdoing and accusations flew back and forth for more
than three years.
   The attorney general's office, the comptroller general, Pemex and
a special commission in the Chamber of Deputies said their
investigations found no wrongdoing.
   Hernandez Galicia and 50 other oil union leaders were arrested in
a government crackdown Jan 10. Five were released for lack of
evidence.
   The longtime union boss and the other 45 face charges ranging
from homicide to illegal weapons possession and fraud.
   In an editorial Monday, El Nacional called Pemex's cancellation
of the contract a ``drastic correction'' to the problem and praised
the monopoly's decision to build its own tanker fleet.
   Leasing those tankers was ``part of a system of enclaves that
created suspicions, made (Pemex) lose credibility, and strengthened
interests that had nothing to do with Pemex,'' the editorial said.

<HEAD>Japanese Pharmaceutical Firm To Buy Shaklee; Stock Jumps 9\</HEAD>

   Yamanouchi Pharmaceutical Co. and Shaklee
Corp. on Monday announced a merger agreement under which the
Japanese firm would buy the direct marketing company for $395
million in cash.
   The $28-per-share bid by Yamanouchi, which bought Shaklee's
Japanese subsidiary last month, apparently foiled an unsolicited
offer from an investor group led by takeover specialist Irwin Jacobs.
   Following the announcement Monday, Jacobs said he would not make
a new offer for Shaklee.
   ``We will not be competing on it,'' Jacobs said. ``They have a
chance to do very well. We wish them a lot of success.''
   Yamanouchi said the $28 it would pay for each of Shaklee's 14
million outstanding shares would be in addition to a one-time
$20-per-share dividend Shaklee recently declared. That meant each
shareholder would receive $48 per share.
   The merger agreement met with strong approval on Wall Street
Monday, as Shaklee's stock shot up $9.25 to close at $47.37{ a share
on the New York Stock Exchange.
   ``I feel it's a very fair price for shareholders,'' said O. Lee
Tawes, III, an analyst with New York-based Oppenheimer &amp; Co.
   Yamanouchi, which had net income of $173 million and sales of
$1.42 billion last year, beat out a $40-per-share, $528 million cash
offer by Jacobs' group on March 3. The group, which included
Minnesota Twins owner Carl Pohlad, said its offer would be reduced
to $20 per share if the $20 special dividend was paid.
   Jacobs, reached at his Minneapolis office, said his group stood
to make up to $44 million in profit from the Yamanouchi deal.
   ``We're disappointed we didn't get the company, but I'd be a fool
if I said I was disappointed financially,'' said Jacobs, who had
hoped to mesh Shaklee with Watkins Co., a direct marketer of
household products he bought 10 years ago.
   Shaklee had earnings last year of $27.2 million on sales of $627
million. Almost half its 1988 earnings and more than a quarter of
its sales came from the Japanese unit, which it sold to Yamanouchi
for $350 million.
   Shaklee said its board had unanimously approved the merger
agreement. Company President David Chamgerlain said there were no
financing conditions attached to the tender offer or merger.

   The Aluminum Company of America said Monday it
collected a record 16.1 billion used aluminum beverage cans for
recycling during 1988, up 35 percent over the 11.9 billion
containers collected in 1987.
   George L. Cobb Jr., president of Alcoa Recycling Co., said can
collectors earned more than $248 million by returning the cans to
one of Alcoa's 1,800 participating recycling centers.
   ``Used beverage cans are not junk,'' he said. ``They are an
increasingly valuable metal resource.''
   Cobb said the cans, which weighed 597 million pounds, were
remelted, rolled into new aluminum can sheet and sold to can makers.
Half of the aluminum can sheet Alcoa shipped in 1988 was produced
from recycled aluminum, he said.
   Alcoa's record can harvest was prompted by increased public
participation and growing commitment to recycling by brewers, soft
drink bottlers, supermarkets and can companies, Cobb said.
   He estimated that 4 million Americans recycle cans regularly,
with millions more recycling part-time.

   Teamsters union officials reached a tentative
labor-reform settlement Monday that prosecutors said would end years
of alleged mobster influence through permanent reforms, including
the first direct election of top union leaders.
   The settlement, announced just hours before the start of a trial
on a lawsuit to oust the union's allegedly mob-dominated leadership,
was reached at 1:30 a.m. Monday in Manhattan after round-the-clock
weekend negotiations.
   Attorney General Dick Thornburgh announced the terms of the
agreement in Washington, saying it will give the government ``the
tools to clean up this union and return control to rank and file
union members.''
   According to the Justice Department, the tentative agreement is a
compromise that calls for three court-appointed watchdogs to oversee
the union, which would continue to be run by its leaders.
   The overseers would be appointed for three years by U.S. District
Judge David N. Edelstein with the joint approval of both sides. One
would investigate and prosecute alleged union corruption, another
would administer disciplinary action and the third would oversee
elections.
   The settlement was subject to Edelstein's approval. The judge
deferred acting until Tuesday, saying the 30-page document, which he
received at Monday afternoon, was ``very complicated.''
   At a press briefing in New York, the lead prosecutor in the case,
Assistant U.S. Attorney Randy Mastro said that once approved by
Edelstein, changes the under the settlement will be ``incorporated
into the Teamsters' constitution in perpetuity.''
   The Justice Department's lawsuit sought to oust the union's top
leadership as the culmination of the government's decades-long
battle to force reform on the 1.6 million-member union.
   Using federal racketeering laws, the Justice Department also
sought a court-appointed trustee or committee to oversee the
nation's largest union and impose a series of reforms. It was the
first time the government tried to seize control of an entire union.
   Thornburgh told reporters in Washington the settlement contained
``roughly the same kind of remedy that was sought'' in the lawsuit.
   However, James T. Grady, the Teamster's general counsel, said
that in exchange for the agreement, none of the union's ruling
executive board members would have to resign and no court-appointed
trustee or administrator would run the union on a day-to-day basis.
   ``The members are assured there is a mechanism in place to remove
those persons alleged to be conducting improper activities,'' said
Grady. ``The goals of a clean and democratic union are consistent
with the goals of the current leadership.''
   Grady said the union agreed to introduce constitutional
amendments for direct election of top union officers at its 1991
convention, what Mastro called ``sweeping election reforms.''
   ``All Teamsters international union officials will be directly
elected by the membership in secret ballot. That's never happened
before,'' said Mastro.
   He noted that whether the amendments were approved in 1991 was
``irrelevent'' because the reform ``is automatic by virtue of this
decree.''
   The lawsuit, filed last June, claimed the Teamsters' leadership
had been dominated by organized crime, which ``deprived union
members of their rights through a pattern of racketeering'' and a
``campaign of fear'' that included 20 murders, dozens of bombings,
beatings, bribes, extortion and theft.
   Twenty-five of 26 reputed mob figures originally named as
defendants have been convicted of Teamsters-related crimes such as
extortion through threats of union problems, embezzlement of union
funds and illegal labor payoffs.
   Most, however, were dismissed from the case when they either
agreed, or were ordered, to drop any involvement with the Teamsters.
Five, including convicted Colombo crime family boss Carmine
``Junior'' Persico, have been severed from the case and will be
tried later.
   Teamsters President William J. McCarthy was among the 11
remaining individual defendants in the case.
   Mastro said that in addition to the union itself _ the
International Brotherhood of Teamsters, Chauffeurs, Warehousemen and
Helpers of America _ the 11 individual defendants had signed the
agreement.
   On Sunday, the union ran a full page ad in The New York Times,
condemning the government lawsuit. ``Teamsters are not the only ones
on trial,'' the ad asserted. ``So is the American system of
Justice.''
   Last week, three members of the Teamsters executive board,
including Weldon Mathis, the union's second-ranking official, agreed
to a settlement. Three other vice presidents reached settlements
last month. That left 11 board members, including McCarthy, and the
union itself as defendants.
   ``That got us moving,'' Grady said of the Mathis settlement.
   When he filed the lawsuit in June, then-U.S. Attorney Rudolph
Giuliani accused the Teamsters' leadership of making a ``devil's
pact'' with organized crime. Giuliani said the lawsuit was an
attempt to take back the union from the Mafia.
   The government's move was roundly criticized by congressmen and
labor leaders. The AFL-CIO, which allowed the Teamsters to rejoin in
1987 after a 30-year rift over corruption, called the lawsuit ```a
clear abuse of the government's prosecutorial power.''
   Court papers noted that four Teamsters presidents since the 1950s
have faced federal felony charges and three were convicted: David
Beck for embezzlement, James ``Jimmy'' Hoffa for obstructing justice
and mail fraud, and Roy Williams for trying to bribe a U.S. senator.
   The fourth, Jackie Presser, the union's president at the time the
lawsuit was brought, died while under indictment on embezzlement
charges.

<HEAD>Carrier Sends Cut-Rate Offer To Strikers</HEAD>

   Eastern Airlines will sharply cut pay of Machinists
who cross union picket lines and will offer reduced wages to any
workers hired to replace strikers, the airline and union said Monday.
   The pay reductions _ made under work rules the troubled airline
says it can impose during a strike _ were disclosed as Eastern
continued trying to expand its active routes and otherwise rebound
from the 10-day-old, crippling walkout by Machinists, pilots and
flight attendants.
   ``This package would make Eastern the lowest-paid in the industry
(compared with major carriers),'' said Wally Haber, a general
chairman for the Machinists union. ``I think it's obvious they don't
want anybody to come back to work.''
   Under the new pay rules, Eastern would cut mechanics' pay from
the current $18.83 to $14 an hour, with new hires receiving a
minimum $10 an hour. Baggage handlers would go from $15.60 to
$11.54, with new hires receiving $10, and pay for Machinists
janitors would drop from $13.21 an hour to $8.25, with new hires
getting a minimum $5, Haber said.
   Overtime, holiday and night differential pay are also slashed,
Haber said.
   Eastern, which filed for federal bankruptcy protection from
creditors last Thursday, had sought $150 million in concessions from
the Machinists before the strike to stem a continuing tide of
financial losses. The Machinists walked off the job after 17 months
of fruitless negotiations.
   Haber said pay under the new rules is lower than the company's
final contract offer and therefore illegal. He said the Machinists
international organization in Washington had been asked to review
the work rules to determine if the union would challenge the cuts.
   ``I'm sure that if they have a complaint, they'll have a lawyer
address it,'' said Eastern spokesman James Ashlock. ``This is the
way we intend to function in those job categories.''
   Haber said the package would make Eastern's pay scales lower than
Continental Airlines, already among the industry's lowest. Both
carriers are owned by Texas Air Corp.
   In other developments Monday:
   _Eastern appealed a U.S. District Court ruling rejecting the
company's claim that its pilots' walkout in sympathy with the
Machinists constituted an illegal strike.
   _Air Line Pilots Association executives met in Washington to
discuss strike benefits for Eastern members. ALPA's leadership also
was expected to discuss actions pilots at other airlines could take
to support strikers.
   _A temporary injunction that prevented employees of other
airlines from honoring Machinists' secondary picket lines expired at
midnight Monday, the union said. Five airlines _ Northwest, United,
USAir, Piedmont and TWA _ sought an extension of the order by U.S.
District Judge John Pratt in Washington, D.C.
   _Eastern said it was aiming for at least 85 flights a day as it
resumed jetliner service between Miami and New York's La Guardia
Airport, Montreal and San Juan, Puerto Rico.
   However, the pilots union estimated that by Sunday the airline
was flying only 3.5 percent of its pre-strike schedule of 1,040
daily flights. The union estimates Eastern has fewer than 200
pilots, of 3,600 before the strike.

<HEAD>Judge Refuses To Throw Out Patent Suit On Key Drug</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A federal judge refused Monday to dismiss
claims that one of Genentech Inc.'s major products, an
anti-heart-attack drug, violated a rival firm's patent.
   U.S. District Judge Marilyn Hall Patel ruled that Abbott
Laboratories had produced enough evidence to go to trial on the
question of whether its 1983 and 1985 patents were adequate to
produce an artificial protein.
   Patel, however, also allowed Genentech, a South San Francisco
biotechnology company, to make new legal attacks on Abbott's patent,
including claims that it was not a new or useful formula and that
Abbott had committed fraud on the U.S. Patent Office.
   But her refusal to dismiss Abbott's claims makes a trial more
likely in a suit that poses a serious threat to Genentech. Patel set
a tentative trial date of January 1991.
   Genentech's suit, filed last year, seeks to stop Abbott from
claiming that Genentech had violated its patents for an artificial
protein. Abbott responded by countersuing Genentech for patent
infringement.
   Abbott first patented the substance in 1978, using a derivative
of human kidney cells to produce the protein. Its patents in 1983
and 1985 involved genetic engineering techniques.
   Genentech, using a different process, produced a similar
substance, called TPA, which it sells commercially as the heart
disease prevention drug Activase. Abbott has not marketed its
product commercially.
   In pretrial proceedings, Genentech has contended that Abbott's
patent is invalid, arguing it was not reliable or specific enough to
enable others to duplicate the product by using the formula, as
patent law requires. Any product that could be produced from
Abbott's patent would not resemble TPA closely enough to justify a
suit for infringement, Genentech argued.
   But Patel ruled that Abbott's scientific evidence contradicted
Genentech's claims sufficiently to raise factual disputes that could
be resovled only in a trial.
   The judge did not allow Genentech to back its claims with its own
scientific testimony because of her December ruling that Genentech
had tampered with one of Abbott's witnesses.
   Patel found that a Genentech scientist had approached an Abbott
scientist improperly and tried to persuade him to change his
testimony, and that the action had been ``agreed to or winked at''
by Genentech lawyers. She prohibited Genentech from using statements
by three scientists in support of its challenge to Abbott's patents,
and also disqualified three Genentech lawyers from the case.

<HEAD>White House Reserves Judgment on Brady Proposal</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: Subs 8th graf to CORRECT Mulford's title to deputy treasury
secretary. Also moved on general news wires.</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Although Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady's
debt-reduction plan has been well received internationally, the
White House reserved judgement on it Monday.
   ``No final decision has been made in terms of an approach to
Third World debt,'' deputy press secretary Roman Popadiuk told a
White House briefing.
   Brady's plan, which he unveilled in a speech Friday, has as its
central element the partial forgiveness by commercial banks of the
$410 billion in debt run up by developing nations, most of them in
Latin America.
   The plan represents a major shift in administration thinking.
   It would supplant a strategy developed by former Treasury
Secretary James A. Baker III _ now the secretary of state _ that
ruled out debt forgiveness and called instead for new loans by banks
to countries that institute economic reforms.
   This previous strategy, known as the ``Baker plan,'' produced
little in the way of new bank loans, however. In his speech Friday,
Brady all but conceded that the past strategy had failed to solve
the debt crisis.
   The Brady plan has received generally favorable reviews both at
home and abroad, but disagreement remained within the govrnment over
details, administration sources said.
   Deputy Treasury Secretary David Mulford said Monday that Brady's
points were put forward as ``ideas and suggestions'' for debate
among countries and institutions, and not as a definite plan.
   In a briefing on the proposals for foreign reporters, Mulford
insisted Brady's plan enjoyed broad support within the Bush
administration.
   Asked about reports of disagreements with the Federal Reserve
System, which is independent of the administration, Mulford said:
   ``I'm not aware of any deep division between us on these
suggestions.''
   Mulford said ``it would be our hope'' that policy changes will be
in place ``within a matter of some months'' to cut the debts and
interest payments of Third World countries.
   Still, on Friday and again on Monday, the White House appeared to
be going out of its way to put some distance between itself and the
new proposal.
   ``Secretary Brady had a number of ideas. He presented those
ideas. The president was aware of those ideas,'' Popadiuk said.
   And, he said, while Brady as treasury secretary ``speaks for the
administration'' on such matters, ``no final decision has been
reached'' by Bush on whether to embrace the approach.
   Popadiuk said the outline that Brady offered remains ``under
consideration.''
   While remaining noncommittal, Popadiuk characterized the Brady
proposal as one that ``builds on the Baker plan'' rather than
repudidating it.
   A White House official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity,
said that Baker had signed off on his successor's propsal.
   Brady ``isn't out there alone on it,'' the official said.
   The official said that the main reason for the delay in giving
the proposal official White House blessings was that the plan needed
to be mulled over further by aides and by inter-agency groups.
   Brady's plan calls for banks to forgive part of the outstanding
debt by using money from the World Bank and the International
Monetary Fund as collateral.
   The plan also envisions that some of the debt will be swapped by
banks for bonds of lower face value.
