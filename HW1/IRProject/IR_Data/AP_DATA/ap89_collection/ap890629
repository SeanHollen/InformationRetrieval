<HEAD>Heavy Rain Still Falling Over The South, Texas May Get Hit Again</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: Leads with 10 grafs to UPDATE with state of emergency declaration
for parts of Louisiana, Thursday night storm north of of New Orleans; picks

<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Heavy rain fell again Thursday across much of the South, causing
flooding in Louisiana, and temperatures slid to record lows around
the Great Lakes.
   Showers and thunderstorms associated with what once was tropical
storm Allison continued to produce locally heavy rain over eastern
Texas and the lower Mississippi Valley.
   It was the third day of rain for Louisiana, bringing the total
rainfall to 20 inches at Winnfield and leaving homes and highways
flooded throughout much of the state.
   In Baton Rouge, Gov. Buddy Roemer declared a state of emergency
in six Louisiana parishes that sustained flooding and storm damage
this week. He said he sent 44 National Guard troops and 21 pieces of
equipment to the parishes.
   During the six hours up to 2 p.m. EDT, 1.47 inches of rain fell
at Fort Polk, La., and 1.16 inches fell at Alexandria, La.
   In Winnfield, Mayor Max Kelley said about 40 homes and businesses
were flooded and many streets were impassable. Flooding isn't
unusual in lowlying Louisiana, but he said Thursday's problems were
unprecedented.
   ``We're having homes that never ever had water in them before
have water in them now,'' Kelley said.
   The flooding forced about 100 people to take refuge in the Winn
Parish courthouse and, 200 miles to the south a Thursday night storm
threatened to flood homes in the New Orleans suburbs on the north
shore of Lake Ponchartrain.
   St. Tammany Parish authorities reported street flooding in
Covington after a Thursday night storm poured six inches of rain on
the area in 2{ hours and said evacuations might be necessary if
rivers and streams continued rising.
   As it often does, Lake Pontchartrain kept the storm north of New
Orleans, which had no rain Thursday night.
   At least three funnel clouds were sighted in southern Louisiana
in Evangeline Parish and near Lafayette, the National Weather
Service said. But no damage was reported.
   Several Louisiana rivers already were above flood stage and
weren't expected to crest for one or two days.
   Earlier in the week in Texas, Allison had dumped more than a foot
of rain around Houston.
   On Thursday, the dwindling weather system had begun to retrace
its path, slowly drifting westward, prompting reissuance of flash
flood watches in southeastern Texas.
   ``It's not near the storm when it went through a couple of days
ago but it will produce some heavy rain,'' said weather service
meteorologist Tom Fountain.
   Allison had flooded hundreds of Texas homes, closed roads, and
contributed to at least four deaths. Preliminary damage estimates
were approaching $1 billion.
   Numerous showers and thunderstorms also extended across the
central Gulf Coast region and Florida. Fort Myers, Fla., got 1.18
inches of rain in the six hours up to 2 p.m. EDT.
   The roof of a recreation building on the Jones County Junior
College campus at Ellisville, Miss., partially collapsed during a
severe storm Thursday, injuring four students enrolled in summer
school, school officials said. Three were treated on campus; one had
possible head injuries.
   ``Someone thought they saw a tornado and gave warning just before
this happened,'' said Terrell Tisdale, the school's president.
   Showers and thunderstorms developing ahead of a slowly moving
cold front extended from northern Arkansas through northern Georgia
and eastern North Carolina. Early in the morning, a thunderstorm in
extreme northeastern North Carolina spawned a waterspout which came
ashore north of Buxton.
   A cold front nearing the northern Pacific Coast produced showers
in western Oregon and northwestern California.
   Elsewhere, showers were widely scattered over the central Rockies
and showers and a few thunderstorms developed over the upper
mississippi valley.
   Overnight temperatures dropped to record lows around the Great
Lakes, including 38 at Alpena, Mich.; 38 at Chicago; 43 at Madison,
Wis.; 48 at Mansfield, Ohio; 35 at Marquette, Mich.; 46 at Muskegon,
Mich.; and 37 at Sault Ste. Marie, Mich.
   In a balmier setting, Hollywood, Fla., hit a record low of 65
degrees.
   Temperatures around the nation at 3 p.m. EDT ranged from 57
degrees at Klamath Falls, Ore., to 104 at Phoenix. Thursday's low
for the Lower 48 states was 33 at Marquette, Mich.
   For Friday, scattered showers and thunderstorms were forecast
from the eastern half of Texas to the southern Atlantic Coast.
Scattered showers and thunderstorms also were forecast from the
northern and central Pacific Coast to Montana.
   Highs only in the 70s were predicted from New England to the
Great Lakes, in the Pacific Northwest, and along the California
coast; above 90 from south-central Texas to western New Mexico, and
from the northern Plains to Arizona and southern and central
California; and above 100 in the deserts of the Southwest.

<HEAD>Site Development Mortgage Insurance Program to be Cancelled</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Housing and Urban Development Secretary on
Thursday ordered cancellation of another troubled program in his
department, one designed to prepare building sites for housing
projects and said by the department to have been ``riddled with
abuse.''
   Twenty-five of 58 projects financed through the 12-year-old
``Title Ten Land Development Mortgage Insurance Program'' have
defaulted, costing the government $90 million, the department said.
   This program guarantees mortgages to finances land acquisition
and site preparation, such as street construction and sewer line
installation, for smaller developers who would include housing for
low-income and moderate income families in their projects.
   About $500 million in loans has been guaranteed since 1977.
   ``This program was an absolute disaster,'' said spokesman Bob
Nipp.
   Kemp said application fees will be returned for projects that
have not yet been approved. Projects with initial approval or with
commitments for funds will be reviewed ``to determine whether fraud
or misrepresentation warrant the denial of government insurance,''
he said.
   The department will publish a proposed regulation to ``terminate
the program due to the enormity of the losses involved, high
patterns of abuse and the failure of the program to benefit the
needy,'' the department's announcement said.
   The Reagan administration sought legislation to abolish the
program but was unsuccessful. Kemp's proposed regulation will have
to remain open for a period of public comment before it can become
final.
   Kemp ordered an examination of the program in April by the
department's inspector-general. Initial findings caused him to order
a complete audit of the program and related consultant activity, and
the circumstances of the recent approval of a loan for McNair Farms
near Dulles Airport in the Virginia suburbs of Washington.

<DATELINE>JACKSONVILLE, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Eight family members, including a
62-year-old matriarch and her 16-year-old grandson, were arrested
and charged Wednesday with running a thriving, drive-up crack
cocaine service.
   ``We sat out there for an hour and a half and we counted 47
different transactions. That's busier than any 7-Eleven in town,''
said detective Rick Graham of the Jacksonville Sheriff's Office
narcotics unit.
   The eight were arrested in a raid of their home early Wednesday
morning. Three other people also were charged.
   Police said the family and their friends ran a crack service that
made more than $100,000 a year selling drugs to dozens of people an
hour.
   Among those arrested Wednesday was the head of the family, Gussie
Mae Nelson, 62, who police said was selling crack along with at
least six of her 11 children. She was charged with trafficking in
cocaine, sale of cocaine and cultivation of marijuana, which was
growing in the back yard of the house.
   Also arrested were three of Ms. Nelson's sons, twins Ronnie and
Donnie Hadden, 30, and Mike Nelson, 41. All were charged with sale
of cocaine, and Ronnie Hadden additionally was charged with
trafficking.
   Two of Ms. Nelson's daughters, Sharon Hadden, 22, and Gloria
Hadden, 37, were charged with selling cocaine, as was her
16-year-old grandson, Canaryshin Hadden, and a nephew, Richard
Williams, 34.
   Police said they had received dozens of complaints from
neighbors, some of whom supplied detailed information about people
and cars that frequented the area.

<HEAD>Shays Says Some Witnesses Have Come Close to Perjuring Themselves</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: INSERTS grafs 14-16: ``Another prominent,'' with report of Fred
Brown's involvement</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICHARD L. VERNACI</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Some witnesses who testified before a
congressional panel on influence peddling at the Housing and Urban
Development Department have come ``dangerously close to perjuring
themselves,'' a Republican member of the subcommittee said Wednesday.
   Meanwhile, Rep. Tom Lantos, D-Calif., the panel's chairman, said
he has met with lawyers for a key witness who has refused to
testify. But Lantos would not say whether the discussions included a
request for or offer of immunity.
   The hearings before the House Government Operations subcommittee
on housing and employment were to resume Thursday with Fred Bush, a
1988 fund-raiser for George Bush's presidential effort, among those
scheduled to testify. Fred Bush, unrelated to the president,
testified May 25, and the subcommittee recalled him.
   After more than a month of hearings on allegations that big-name
Republicans profited handsomely by using their connections to land
multimillion-dollar contracts at HUD, Rep. Christopher Shays,
R-Conn., said in an interview that some contradictions have emerged
but he refused to specify what they were or who made them.
   ``I think there are some persons who are dangerously close to
perjuring themselves,'' Shays said. ``We have some conflicting
testimony.''
   Shays, a member of the subcommittee, has been outspoken in his
criticism of the management of HUD during the eight years of the
Reagan administration.
   He said that some of the conflicts among witnesses also may be
due to poor memory or misunderstanding the questions.
   But Lantos, while not disagreeing with Shays, said he would wait
until the hearings are nearly over before saying whether any of the
witnesses had lied.
   ``I think everything that Chris Shays ... says may well prove to
be the case,'' Lantos said. ``But I would prefer to make any
comments along those lines much later than at this stage of the
game.''
   ``Obviously in a number of instances we have had people claiming
not knowing, not remembering, and there comes a point where this
appears less and less plausible,'' Lantos said in an interview.
   ``I've tried my very best to give the witnesses the benefit of
the doubt and caution them when I thought they were on dangerous
territory,'' Lantos said.
   Witnesses said they made contact with Deborah Gore Dean, who was
then executive assistant to housing Secretary Samuel Pierce Jr., to
get approval for their projects seeking funds from HUD for
rehabilitating run-down housing for the poor. In some of these
cases, the funds for fixing up the property, rent subsidies and tax
credits ran into the tens of millions of dollars.
   The witnesses have said that Ms. Dean's support for a project was
crucial in gaining department approval. Contact with her often was
made through former HUD employees or by well-placed Republicans,
such as former Interior Secretary James Watt, who hired out their
services for six-figure fees as consultants.
   Another prominent Republican who received a consulting fee for
helping a project win federal housing funds was Fred Brown, a New
York businessman and chairman of the National Black Republican
Council, The New York Times said in Thursday editions.
   A 1987 audit by HUD investigators questioned Brown's $50,000 fee
for consulting work on behalf of New Haven, Conn., in its successful
bid for a $10 million federal Urban Development Action Grant.
   The audit said there was ``insufficient data to determine whether
the fee is reasonable and that this type of service was necessary.''
A lawyer for Brown, Joshua S. Vogel, said his client was
instrumental in obtaining the New Haven grant through his contacts
with Ms. Dean, the newspaper said.
   In his earlier testimony, Fred Bush, whose company made $268,000
as consultant on a HUD project, said that he, too, sought Ms. Dean's
support at the department but said that he was not personally
acquainted with her.
   In her appearance before the subcommittee last month, Ms. Dean
refused to testify, citing her constitutional protection against
self-incrimination.
   Lantos said he remained hopeful that Ms. Dean would testify ``in
which case some of the questions of controversy among the various
businesses will come out into the open.''
   Asked if he has discussed a deal with Ms. Dean's attorneys under
which she would be granted immunity for her testimony before the
panel, Lantos replied: ``I can confirm that I have met with them,
but I am not liberty to discuss what they talked to me about and
what I talked to them about.''
   Ms. Dean, contacted by telephone, declined to talk about meetings
between her attorneys and the subcommittee. She said that she had
been spending her time examining a box full of documents recently
obtained from HUD.
   One of her attorneys, Charles Leeper, also confirmed meetings
with the subcommittee but would not elaborate.

<HEAD>Eds: This item will be released with the Supreme Court's abortion
decision, which may be announced today.</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Here is a chronology of the Supreme Court's
major abortion decisions:
   _Jan. 22, 1973. In Roe vs. Wade, the court for the first time
legalized abortion nationwide. The court, in an opinion by Justice
Harry A. Blackmun, based its 7-2 ruling on a woman's constitutional
right to privacy.
   The court said a woman's decision to have an abortion during the
first three months of pregnancy must be left to her and her doctor.
It said states may impose certain regulations during the second
trimester to protect the woman's health, and may take steps to
protect fetal life in the third trimester. State authority to
regulate abortions after the first trimester was not made absolute,
however.
   _Jan. 22, 1973. In Roe vs. Bolton, the court that same day struck
down by a 7-2 vote restrictions on facilities that could be used to
perform abortions. The decision gave rise to a new kind of medical
facility, the abortion clinic.
   _July 1, 1976. In Planned Parenthood vs. Danforth, the court, by
a 6-3 vote, said states cannot give husbands veto power over their
pregnant wives' decision to abort their pregnancies. By a 5-4 vote,
the court said that neither can parents of minor, unwed girls be
given an absolute veto over abortions.
   _June 20, 1977. In Maher vs. Roe, the court ruled 6-3 that states
have no legal obligation to pay for ``non-therapeutic'' abortions.
   _Jan. 9, 1979. In Colautti vs. Franklin, reached by a 6-3 vote,
the court reaffirmed its intention to give doctors broad discretion
in determining the timing of ``fetal viability'' _ when a fetus can
live outside the mother's womb. The justices said states may seek to
protect a fetus that has reached viability, but the determination is
up to doctors, not courts or legislatures.
   _July 2, 1979. In Bellotti vs. Baird, the court by an 8-1 vote
elaborated on its parental consent decision of 1976. It implied that
states may be able to require a pregnant, unmarried minor to obtain
parental consent to an abortion so long as the state law provides an
alternative procedure to parental approval, such as letting the
minor seek a state judge's approval instead.
   _June 30, 1980. In Harris vs. McRae, the so-called Hyde Amendment
was upheld by a 5-4 vote. The court said the federal government and
individual states are under no legal obligation to pay for even
medically necessary abortions sought by women receiving welfare.
   _March 23, 1981. In H.L. vs. Matheson, the court ruled by a 6-3
vote that states may require doctors consulted by some girls _ those
still dependent on their parents and too ``immature'' to decide such
matters for themselves _ to try to inform parents before performing
a requested abortion.
   _June 15, 1983. In three decisions called City of Akron vs. Akron
Center for Reproductive Health, Planned Parenthood of Kansas City
vs. Ashcroft and Simopolous vs. Virginia, the court, in a 6-3
ruling, said states and local communities may not require that all
abortions for women more than three months pregnant be performed in
a hospital.
   The court also struck down regulations that, among other things,
imposed a 24-hour waiting period between the signing of an abortion
consent form and the medical procedure and required doctors to tell
women seeking an abortion that a fetus is a ``human life.''
   _June 11, 1986. In Thornburgh vs. American College of
Obstetricians and Gynecologists, the court voted 5-4 to strike down
Pennsylvania abortion regulations somewhat similar to those it
invalidated in 1983. The court said states may not require doctors
to inform women seeking abortions about potential risks and about
available medical assistance benefits for prenatal care and
childbirth.
   In that decision, the court also struck down requirements that
doctors performing third-trimester abortions, which are rare, use
procedures least risky to a fetus capable of surviving outside the
womb, and that two doctors always be present for abortions performed
in the third trimester. Also invalidated was a regulation requiring
doctors to make a record, which could become available to the
public, of every abortion they perform.
   _Dec. 14, 1987. In Hartigan vs. Zbaraz, the court split 4-4. The
effect was to invalidate an Illinois law that could have made
abortions more difficult to obtain for some teen-agers.
   The decision was announced two months before Justice Anthony M.
Kennedy joined the court and replaced Justice Lewis F. Powell, who
had retired the previous June.

decision, which may be announced today.</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Throughout the 1980s, about 1.5 million
abortions have been performed on American women each year, according
to a private survey.
   The number climbed steadily after the 1973 Supreme Court decision
legalizing abortion _ from about 750,000 to more than a million by
1976, the survey showed.
   Who are the women seeking and obtaining abortions? The following
statistics have been reported by The Alan Guttmacher Institute, a
New York-based organization that studies reproductive issues:
   _Women in their 20s obtain more than half of all reported
abortions, about 55 percent. About 24 percent are obtained by
teen-agers _ 14 percent by those aged 18 or 19.
   _About 42 percent are obtained by Protestants; about 31 percent
by Catholics. Less than 2 percent are obtained by Jewish women.
About 22 percent of those obtaining abortions belong to no religious
denomination.
   _Women with family incomes below $11,000 accounted for one-third
of all abortions. That group comprises about 29 percent of all women
of child-bearing age.
   _White women have 68.6 percent of all abortions. But non-white
women, who make up 16.7 percent of the childbearing-age population,
have 31.4 percent of all abortions.
   _About 63 percent of the women obtaining abortions are unmarried.
   _Unmarried women living with a man constitute 17.4 percent of the
abortion clients. They make up only 3.4 percent of all
childbearing-age women.
   _Women attending school, who number about one-fifth of the
childbearing-age population, obtain 31 percent of the abortions each
year.

<TEXT>
   A congressional panel produced a memorandum on
Thursday linking a member of George Bush's vice presidential staff
to a project that has figured in alleged influence-peddling in a
federal housing program.
   Meanwhile, Fred Bush, the chief fund-raiser for George Bush's
1988 presidential campaign, making a second appearance before the
House Government Operations subcommittee on employment and housing,
substantially changed his previous sworn testimony about his initial
contacts with the memo's author.
   The memo, dated June 10, 1987, was sent from Deborah Gore Dean,
former executive assistant to then-housing Secretary Samuel Pierce
Jr., to Tony Benedi, coordinator of special projects in the vice
president's office.
   The memo details more than $2 million in funding from the
Department of Housing and Urban Development to the city of Bayamon,
Puerto Rico, during fiscal years 1986 and 1987, information Dean
provided ``per your request'' to Benedi.
   Although no HUD inspector general's investigations at that time
involved Bayamon, the city had been asked to repay $1 million to the
agency.
   ``If advance work is handled properly, this should not present a
problem, but it is potentially dangerous,'' she said.
   On a related matter, HUD Secretary Jack Kemp ordered Thursday
cancellation of a troubled program in his department, one designed
to prepare building sites for housing projects and said by the
department to have been ``riddled with abuse.''
   Twenty-five of 58 projects financed through the 12-year-old
``Title Ten Land Development Mortgage Insurance Program'' have
defaulted, costing the government $90 million, the department said.
   This program guarantees mortgages to finance land acquisition and
site preparation, such as street construction and sewer line
installation, for smaller developers who would include housing for
low-income and moderate income families in their projects.
   Earlier this week, President Bush said he would accept some
responsibility for alleged influence-peddling, favoritism and
mismanagement in several HUD programs while he was vice president in
the Reagan administration.
   ``If you want to assign blame to the vice president for what
happened over the past ... eight years, OK, that's fine, I accept
it,'' President Bush said. He added that he wanted to make sure
there is no recurrence of ``cronyism'' and ``special favors'' in
awarding government contracts.
   Meanwhile, Fred Bush, former deputy chief of staff for then-Vice
President Bush, sought to make what he termed ``clarifying
statements'' to the House subcommittee. Fred Bush, who is not
related to George Bush, previously testified May 25.
   At that time, Fred Bush told the subcommittee he contacted Dean
about the Bayamon project after finding her name in an federal
executive telephone directory.
   However, Bush said one of his former colleagues at Bush &amp; Co.
reminded him later that they had contacted Dean after another former
official at HUD spoke with the colleague at a social gathering.
   ``They have told me of their best recollection. Sometime in late
1984 or early 1985 one of my colleagues met Hunter Cushing at a
social gathering and learned that he worked at HUD,'' said Bush.
   ``My colleague's recollection is that Mr. Cushing told him we
should talk to Deborah Gore Dean,'' he said, adding that the
colleague asked Bush if he knew Dean.
   Bush said he didn't and it was then that he consulted the
directory, subsequently called Dean and later met with her at her
office to discuss the project.
   ``No one at Bush &amp; Co. understood at the time that Ms. Dean might
have the power to approve this project,'' Bush added.
   Bush, ambassador-designate to Luxembourg, said he could not
explain why Benedi had sent the memo to Dean about the Bayamon
project. Bush said he didn't know Benedi, who joined the staff after
Bush had left.
   ``I think it's extremely important that we have this different
version which ... seems to be a dramatically more plausible version
than your initial testimony,'' said Rep. Tom Lantos, D-Calif., the
subcommittee chairman.
   ``I'm getting a little confused as to whether you knew Deborah
Dean or Hunter Cushing first,'' said Rep. Christopher Shays,
R-Conn., questioning Bush extensively on Thursday's version of his
initial contacts with HUD officials.
   Lantos also cited Bush's access to those officials in repeatedly
questioning why the Los Jamines project was subsequently approved by
HUD political appointees over the objections of career HUD
employees. Bush earned $253,000 as a consultant on the project which
was subsequently canceled by the municipality.
   ``I did not feel, nor do I feel today that I had political
infulence,'' said Bush.
   ``I made the distinction between what I call political access and
political influence,'' he added.
   But Rep. Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., countered with a question about
Bush's nomination as ambassador, asking whether it had to do more
with his influence than with his layman's knowledge of foreign
policy.
   Cushing, former deputy assistant secretary for multifamily
housing, on Thursday asked the panel to postpone his testimony until
he could review documents that would help him prepare to answer
questions.
   ``I've only recently been retained and not had adequate
opportunity to review the facts in this case,'' said Jamie Gorelick,
an attorney who accompanied the former HUD official.
   Gorelick said Cushing, a deputy assistant secretary at the
Commerce Department, would appear voluntarily before the
subcommittee after the congressional recess for the Fourth of July.
   Lantos excused Cushing and said he would be recalled.
   Investigators also questioned why Bush had failed in his previous
testimony to mention several other HUD projects in which his company
was involved, including a $268,000 technical assistance grant for
another project in Puerto Rico.
   ``Because there has been no Bush &amp; Co. since November of last
year, it has been particularly difficult to pull all this
together,'' said Bush.
   Additionally, he said he was only peripherally involved in the
projects because from March 1986 to November 1988 he worked from
three offices and was involved in fund-raising.

   Thousands of elderly Americans are hospitalized
and die every year because they take too many medicines and suffer
adverse reactions. Sam Benton, after two decades abusing
prescription drugs, kicked the habit on his own. Science Writer Lee
Siegel is his grandson.

   Sam Benton doesn't look like a junkie, but
for 22 years the unassuming grandfather was hooked on a narcotic
painkiller and sleeping pills.
   ``I've been on so many different kinds of pills you'd have to get
a book to tell you how many. The more you take the worse off you
are. One pill leads to another pill. And I was drinking liquor on
top of that, too.''
   ``It's a wonder he's alive today,'' said Rose Benton, 81, married
for nearly 60 years to the retired clothing factory production
manager. ``You know what living in hell is? Watching somebody go
through this.''
   For Benton, 86, recovery started early last year when he felt
ill, sleepless, confused and like ``my mind wasn't acting properly.''
   He quit cigarettes, most medicines and, finally, the two hefty
shots of whiskey he enjoyed nightly. Last fall he spent two
agonizing months withdrawing from his 22-year habit of three to
seven daily Percodans, a painkiller containing a synthetic narcotic.
   ``He was a Percodan junkie,'' said Benton's son-in-law, Portland
lawyer Sol Siegel, but he quit Percodan ``at home without any help.''
   A doctor first prescribed Percodan in 1966, when Benton suffered
severe stress headaches. Over the years, he mixed Percodan with
Feldene and Indocin, arthritis drugs; Orinase, for diabetes;
antacids; decongestants; Motrin, a non-narcotic painkiller;
Coumadin, to prevent blood clots that caused leg pains; Elavil, an
antidepressant; and Xanax, Ativan, Librium and Serax to fight
sleeplessness, anxiety and nervousness.
   The situation worsened several years ago when a car rear-ended
Benton's, injuring his neck and prompting another doctor to
prescribe more Percodan.
   ``Doctors keep giving you the stuff. You just tell them, `My head
bothers me, my neck bothers me, I can't sleep.' They'll give you
pills,'' he said.
   If any doctor objected, Benton would say, ``Doc, if you take me
off it, you'll hurt me more than if you leave me on it.
   ``The minute it wears off you get a terrible urge. Everything
begins to disturb you. You crave it. I couldn't go to sleep without
it. I couldn't do anything without it.''
   Benton's daughter, Julie Siegel, said his latest doctor kept
urging him to quit Percodan, but was compassionate enough not to cut
off his supply.
   ``Gramp was desperately, profoundly dependent on his various
doctors to keep him in Percodan. He lived in fear of someone cutting
him off. It would be easy to condemn all the doctors involved, but I
can see their position too.''
   ``I don't want to blame my doctor. I was the one who coaxed
him,'' said Benton, who finally decided to quit most medications and
then Percodan because of sleeplessness, weakness, drug-induced hives
and mental confusion.
   As Benton tapered off Percodan, ``I was weak, sweaty, nauseous,
had an inner craving. My mind wouldn't relax. I was hot and cold all
the time.'' He also suffered severe insomnia.
   He now takes only coated aspirin for arthritis and, occasionally,
one-quarter of a sleeping pill. ``My mind is now alert,'' he said.
   He sleeps and feels better, and is starting to regain the
motivation he believes the drugs robbed him of. And he wants other
senior citizens to know the dangers of overmedication:
   ``It wrecks your body and your mind. It's going to ruin your
life.''

<TEXT>
   Here are 10 rules for safer drug use adapted
from ``Worst Pills, Best Pills: The Older Adult's Guide to Avoiding
Drug-Induced Death or Illness,'' by Dr. Sidney Wolfe and others at
the Public Citizen Health Research Group.
   (1) Have ``brown bag sessions'' with your primary doctor. When
you go to a doctor you haven't seen before or with whom you have
never had such a session, dump into a bag all prescription and
over-the-counter drugs you are using, have used in the last month or
are likely to use, and take them along.
   Review the reason each was prescribed, the dose and frequency,
how long you should take it, possible side effects, possible
interactions with foods or other drugs, and whether you can stop
taking any of them.
   (2) Contact your doctor if you have any of the following symptoms
after starting to use a drug: depression, hallucinations, confusion,
delirium, memory loss, impaired thinking, shaking or twitching,
dizziness upon standing, falls, loss of appetite, nausea, vomiting,
abdominal pain, bleeding, constipation, diarrhea, difficulty
urinating and loss of bladder control.
   (3) ``Assume that any new symptom you develop after starting a
new drug might be caused by the drug.'' Report it to your doctor.
   (4) Make sure you really need the drug for your condition and ask
whether the side effects may be worse than the disease.
   (5) ``If drug therapy is indicated, in most cases it is safer to
start with a dose that is lower than the usual adult dose.''
   (6) When adding a drug, see if it is possible to stop another
drug.
   (7) Review with your doctor at least every three to six months
the need to keep taking each drug.
   (8) Before leaving the doctor's office or pharmacy, make sure you
and a family member or friend understand the instructions for taking
the medication.
   (9) ``Discard all old drugs carefully.'' Throw them away when
your therapy is over so you aren't tempted to use or give away
outdated drugs.
   (10) ``Ask your primary doctor to coordinate your care and drugs.
If you see a specialist and he or she wants to start you on new
medicines in addition to the ones you are on, check with your
primary doctor first.''

<HEAD>Actress Breaks Male Barrier in Turkey by Becoming a Mayor</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: Also in Thursday AMs report.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By EMEL ANIL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>ISTANBUL, Turkey (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A leading actress has broken one barrier
for women on Turkey's male-dominated political stage by getting
elected mayor of Sisli, a borough of Istanbul where fancy
residential and shopping areas are ringed by slums.
   Fatma Girik, 46, believes in personal contact with her
550,000-member constituency and in daily personal inspection of
public works rather than relying on reports of her staff.
   Women make better mayors, she recently told a Turkish newspaper.
   ``I see Sisli as my own home and I can communicate much better
with women who deal with day-to-day problems,'' she was quoted as
saying.
   Once a month she opens up city hall to constituents who have
problems.
   White-bearded men clutching worry beads, young mothers carrying
wailing babies, widows without pensions _ people from the underclass
_ come to share their problems with Miss Girik.
   At one recent meeting a young woman, just graduated from high
school, said she was looking for a job.
   ``Don't we have anything, at the switchboard or someplace?'' Miss
Girik asked her staff.
   Not at the moment, she was told. That angered her.
   ``Why did she go to school if she cannot even earn a living? Do
something,'' she ordered the staff.
   ``Grandad,'' she pleaded with another supplicant, ``don't keep
coming here everyday. I promise you your water will be connected
soon.''
   Political experts say it is too early to tell whether Miss
Girik's way of doing things _ putting pressure on bureaucracy and
stretching rules in favor of common people _ will succeed in
Istanbul, Turkey's largest city with an overall population of 7
million.
   She won the mayoralty in March when her Social Democrat Populist
Party swept Turkey's urban centers.
   During the campaign the ruling Motherland Party candidates
attacked her as unsuitable on grounds that she lacked experience and
because of her 25-year-old common-law marriage to film director
Memduh Un.
   ``I am running for mayor of Sisli, not for the imam of the Sisli
mosque,'' she shot back at opponents, referring to the Moslem
religious leader.
   Born in Istanbul to a middle-class family in which the father was
a seaman, she quit school after the eighth grade and a few years
later made her way into the movie world in Istanbul's Yesilcam
district, mainly on the strength of her looks.
   She turned out to be a good actress, ``a natural born one,'' says
movie critic Erman Sener.
   She has made 300 movies since starting her film career in 1958
and many are pot-boilers typical of the Turkish movie industry. But,
in the past two decades she has specialized in the portrayal of
Anatolian peasant women. Heroines played by Miss Girik fight for
their rights and their families against difficult odds and often
prevail.
   Attempting to overcome Turkey's social and economic problems may
be more difficult in real life.
   ``I have no time for books, for movies anymore.,'' she said. ``I
am on my feet all day long and hit the bed exhausted.''

<HEAD>Wildcat Strikers Planning Lengthy Stay At Camp Solidarity</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   It's 8:30 a.m. at Camp Solidarity and the
United Mine Workers' version of the snake dance is about to begin
along narrow coal hauling roads in southwestern Virginia.
   Several hundred Appalachian and Midwestern miners who left their
jobs in sympathetic wildcat strikes have lined up their cars and
trucks in a daily convoy they use to slow coal traffic.
   Most of the miners involved in the walkouts, officially
unauthorized by the union, stay in tents and campers at a 10-acre
campground leased by the union. Others stay in hotels nearby.
   Nearly every working day since June 19, they've driven a few
miles along a dirt road following the path of the Clinch River to
Pittston Coal Group's main processing plant in Russell County.
There, they link up with miners on strike against Pittston in a
contract dispute.
   The vehicles slowly parade bumper-to-bumper for a few miles, turn
around, pass the entrance again, meander for another few miles and
turn around again. A similar, smaller convoy is run along a road
connecting Pittston mines with its other processing plant in McClure.
   Coal trucks occasionally slip into the convoys and into the
processing plants, but far fewer than normal.
   State police say there is little they can do when drivers do not
go too slow and obey traffic laws. Troopers watch the passing parade
of cars and occassionally issue tickets for impeding traffic.
   Strike captain Bill Bise of Lebanon stands at the entrance to
Pittston's main processing plant and marks down the number of trucks
that make it through the union gauntlet. ``How many loads we got?''
``What's the count now?'' miners riding shotgun in convoy cars
periodically ask Bise as they drove slowly by.
   At day's end, the wildcat strikers head back to the campground
for a hearty buffet.
   ``It's a humongous pot luck supper,'' explains Joyce Kiser of
Castlewood, the wife of a retired miner, as she helps dish out food
donated by area families and businesses supporting the strike.
   After the meal, the campers play horseshoes, whittle and talk
about the union or listen to local musicians fill the hollow with
bluegrass or gospel tunes.
   The next morning, after a breakfast of eggs, bacon and potatoes
cooked on a huge makeshift grill, the convoy forms again.
   People coordinating the activity said the wildcat strikers from
West Virginia, Kentucky, Indiana, Pennsylvania, Ohio, Tennessee and
Missouri will be rotated in weekly and bi-weekly shifts indefinitely.
   ``We'll stay as long as it takes,'' said Tim Evans, who is on
strike from Belva Coal Co., a Pittston mine near Logan, W.Va.
   On Monday, U.S. District Judge Glen Williams tried to put a
financial roadblock in the way of the miners. He fined the union and
two officers $240,000 for organizing the convoys. And he promised to
levy fines totaling $120,000 for each day the convoys continue.
   On Tuesday, a federal judge in West Virginia ruled that the
nearly 43,000 coal miners on wildcat strikes in nine states are
violating U.S. labor law and ordered them to return to work.
   But the wildcat strikers said they have a permanent stake in what
happens to the 1,900 union members on strike against Pittston.
   Pittston broke away from an association of coal companies that
signed a national contract with the UMW last year, and miners
believe that if the union loses its dispute with Pittston their
companies may follow suit and lower their benefits, pensions and job
security.
   ``If everybody else does what Pittston is doing, we're all up a
creek,'' Evans said.
   He sleeps on a plastic sheet on the ground in a tent with a dozen
other men. It's been raining almost every day and mud is up to his
ankles in some parts of the campground.
   But the 28-year-old equipment operator is almost gleeful.
   ``If Pittston thinks that this is eventually going to wear us
down, they better think again,'' Evans said. ``When you're from the
West Virginia mountains, you get used to roughing it, staying in the
woods. They've got a saying about it: `A country boy can survive.'
We're in our element.''

fishing trawler fired a flare gun and leaped into the Willamette
River on Wednesday in an apparent attempt to defect, police said.
   A fire boat pulled the man from the water and he was taken to a
hospital and treated for a cut lip suffered in the leap, said police
spokesman Henry Groepper.
   Groepper said the man, whose identity wasn't released, told
police in broken English, ``I want to stay here.''
   After he was treated at the hospital, police took the man to the
Portland office of the Immigration and Naturalization Service.
   A woman at the INS office said there would be nobody available to
comment on the incident.
   Groepper said the trawler from which the man jumped, the
Izumrudnyi, is one of two Russian fishing boats on the Willamette
River in Portland.

<HEAD>Era Ending as King of the Playboys Abdicates to Marry Centerfold</HEAD>

   Hugh Hefner is taking a bride this weekend,
ending the hedonistic fantasy he nourished through Playboy magazine
and as pajama-clad lord of the Playboy Mansion and its flocks of
world-class women.
   ``The king of the playboys is succumbing to romance the way the
rest of the country is doing. We are out of the era of play sex,''
observed media psychologist Joyce Brothers. ``The one-night stand is
over.''
   The 63-year-old founder of Playboy magazine and 1988 Playmate of
the Year Kimberley Conrad, 26, will recite wedding vows Saturday
afternoon at the Playboy Mansion in exclusive Holmby Hills. Some 450
guests will then party the night away beneath a huge white tent
alongside the mansion's exotic grotto.
   The formal ceremony will be elaborate yet traditional, planners
say. In keeping with southern California standards, ushers are
required to have tans.
   Hefner will wear a vested black tuxedo when he walks from a
wishing well to the altar to greet his bride. It was at the wishing
well where he uttered the ``M'' word last July.
   Miss Conrad will make her entrance down the mansion's grand
staircase wearing an off-white taffeta gown by New York designer Jim
Hjelm. The gown's chapel-length train is embroidered with the
couple's initials.
   There won't be a hidden Playboy bunny logo anywhere.
   And Miss Conrad, a former Playboy bunny later picked as last
year's Playmate, already has evicted the bevy of cotton-tailed
beauties from the 5.3-acre estate.
   The ceremony is off-limits to the news media. Pictures will be
taken by former White House photographer David Hume Kennerly. The
guest list was secret, but wedding planner Colin Cowie let it slip
that Bill Cosby was coming.
   ``It was the kind of thing I felt quite certain would never
happen in my life,'' Hefner said of the wedding, adding: ``I guess
I've changed.''
   Or maybe the rest of society just changed less than a reader of
Hefner's Playboy Philosophy might expect. A survey of more than
3,000 adults suggests that if there was a sexual revolution in the
1960s, most Americans missed it. The survey, conducted by
researchers in 1970 but published this week for the first time,
found that Americans overwhelmingly disapproved of extramarital sex
and premarital sex.
   Said Brothers: ``Finding sex that is fun in monogamy is the goal
today. Sex without caring, sex without commitment is just dull.''
   Hefner was married once before, for 10 years to Millie Williams,
and they had two children _ Christie, 36, and David, 34.
   ``I am, most important, excited about it because he's so happy,''
Christie Hefner said, confessing she has often found herself
mothering Hefner and worrying about whom he's dating. ``You want to
be sure somebody they're (Hefner) going with is somebody who's good
enough for him. She has the same interests as him, and is making him
very happy.''
   Christie Hefner is now chairman and chief executive officer of
Playboy Enterprises Inc., the empire Hefner started in 1953, about
10 years before his bride was born.
   The wedding flies in the face of the Playboy ``sexcapades''
lifestyle. His own magazine said in an article last year that Hefner
``has lived by Woody Allen's law: `Marriage is the death of hope.'''
   The gothic Playboy Mansion, just south of Sunset Boulevard near
Westwood's University of California at Los Angeles campus, was a
frequent party stop for Hollywood celebrities.
   It once had a ribald flabor with nude swimming, sunbathing and
cavorting on the lavish grounds. It now seems prosaic.
   Hefner was tamed in part by a mild stroke in 1986. He stopped
smoking his pipe and switched to caffeine-free Diet Pepsi, but he
still wears his trademark purple silk pajamas day and night.
   Playboy magazine now has a circulation of 3.5 million and a
national Playboy Channel cable TV audience.
   Christie Hefner feels the marriage captures the spirit of the
1990s.
   ``On a kind of commercial note ... I think it's fabulous because
the majority of subscribers to the magazine are married now and I
think the '90s are an era of romance and commitment,'' she said.
   Brothers said there will always be room for Playboy magazine.
   ``We still need fuel for our fantasies. Playboy magazine will
still be popular. Paper dolls with staples across their navels are a
lot less dangerous these days,'' she said.

<TEXT>
   It was hailed as the first U.S.-style football
contest played in the Soviet Union and the two all-star high school
teams from Oklahoma had the time of their lives showing the Soviets
what football is all about.
   The announcer tried to lecture the Soviet spectators on the fine
points.
   ``Remember, the idea of the game is to try to move forward,'' he
said.
   ``The main thing is not to fall. The thing is to stay on your
feet as long as possible.''
   The thousands of Soviets who paid four rubles each (about $7) to
get into Moscow's Dynamo stadium for the exhibition Wednesday looked
like they had a good time _ though the basics did sort of elude them
for a while.
   ``I thought the crowd was kind of confused,'' said offensive
tackle Chance Walentiny, 18, a senior from Bixby, Okla., near game's
end. ``But I think they liked it, I think they like American
football.
   ``I've never played in front of so many people before. I'm
ecstatic right now.''
   It was the Boomers against the Stars, and quarterback Matt Cook
had himself a day to remember, passing for three touchdowns and
running for a fourth to lead the Boomers to a 28-6 victory.
   Muscovites know rugby, soccer and baseball, but American-style
football was something new. They cheered when players gestured to
them, but most of the yells in the right places came from family
members imported from Oklahoma.
   And also from youths in black jerseys who journeyed more than
1,000 to Moscow from Chelyabinsk in the Ural Mountains to meet the
American players.
   The Federal football club, whose 80 players include girls, is the
only American-style football team in the Soviet Union and has been
playing since late 1987, coach Alexander Kovrygin said.
   ``The kids had the idea that football means murder and brawls,
and they figured they could fight legally on the field,'' he jested.
   American coach Dan Crookham did report, however, that one
Muscovite approached him before the game with a question.
   ``He asked how many people he could expect to be killed in
tonight's contest,'' Crookham said, smiling.
   The Tass news agency said the three games the Americans play in
Moscow, Leningrad and Tallinn should help football overcome its
violent reputation.
   Kemp Fox, an umpire at the game from Tulsa, Okla., said the match
served as a ``good example of American football,'' with few
penalties and no injuries.
   Up in the stands, Phil Straus, a scientist from Los Angeles,
tried to explain the game to Soviet Vladimir Katashov.
   ``It's the most important thing on Monday nights. You go to the
bar and have a pitcher of beer,'' Straus told him.
   Katashov shrugged. ``It doesn't seem very dynamic to me. It's
rather monotonous.''
   Another Soviet spectator, a policeman who identified himself only
as Sergei, complained, ``It has so many pauses. As soon as any
excitement starts, they stop again.''
   Organizers expect the two 45-player teams' game in Leningrad,
last on the Oklahomans' itinerary, to draw up to 100,000 people.
   The Soviet sports committee that helped organize the tour is
pocketing the proceeds.

<TEXT>
   As Palestinian rioters and Israeli
troops battle in the occupied territories, a young Arab refugee and
an Orthodox Jewish woman have done what is almost unthinkable in
Israel: They married.
   Ignoring their families' outrage and the war that separates their
people, Zaki el-Amoudi and Nurit Yehuda signed a marriage contract
on a parked car in front of Nurit's aunt's apartment last year.
   Since then, Nurit's family has abducted her several times _ and
once sent her to the United States _ and Jewish extremists have
kidnapped the couple's baby daughter.
   Only intervention by Israeli police and the FBI reunited the
couple and their daughter. A restraining order banning Nurit's
family from approaching their home has given the Palestinian
``Romeo'' and Israeli ``Juliet'' a semblance of quiet.
   Zaki said his story of love conquering hate should be a message
to the Israeli and Palestinian people.
   ``My daughter was born in the middle of a war,'' said Zaki,
sitting in his small, suburban apartment near Tel Aviv. ``It shows
how much we need real peace.''
   Zaki, 25, and Nurit, 24, met four years ago when they worked at a
chocolate factory near Tel Aviv.
   ``I invited her for a cup of coffee, but she refused,'' Zaki
said, laughing.
   He pursued the shy, quiet Nurit, and after two months she agreed
to meet him after work in a park.
   For more than a year, they met clandestinely until Nurit's
parents discovered their daughter was seeing a Palestinian from work.
   Nurit said when she returned from a meeting with Zaki, ``My
mother began shouting at me and Moshe (her elder brother) slapped me
in the face and shouted `From tomorrow on, you're not going to
work!'''
   Zaki said when his family found out about his Jewish girlfriend,
they barged into his apartment. ``They wanted to break my legs and
take me home,'' he said.
   Nurit's family forced her to quit her job, but the lovers managed
to meet secretly for two more years.
   Then ``we got the idea that if she was pregnant, her family would
have to accept us,'' Zaki said. ``But things became even worse.''
   When Nurit's parents found out she was pregnant, they took her
and hid her in her aunt's home north of Tel Aviv. Zaki found her and
rushed to the house with a marriage contract, which the two lovers
signed on the parked car.
   Nurit's parents sent her to Baltimore, where they had hoped she
would have an abortion. But doctors refused to perform one when they
discovered she was in her seventh month of pregnancy.
   ``They thought that if we were apart our love would die and the
baby would be unnecessary,'' said Nurit.
   When Zaki learned that Nurit was in Baltimore he called an
Israeli lawyer who contacted the FBI. He said the FBI forced the
Orthodox Jewish family that was holding Nurit to allow her to return
to Israel.
   Zaki and Nurit then moved to Khan Yunis, a town in the occupied
Gaza Strip, to live with his family, which had become reconciled to
the idea of an Israeli-Arab marriage.
   Nurit went into labor late one night when Gaza was under a
military curfew.
   ``I grabbed my brother and told him the pains had started and we
had to go,'' Zaki recalled.
   He and his brother, Samir, took Nurit to a hospital, but when
Zaki returned home he was stopped by soldiers at an army checkpoint.
   ``I told them that my wife was pregnant, but I certainly didn't
tell them she was Jewish,'' he said.
   The soldiers didn't listen and ordered Zaki to clear a roadblock
set up by Palestinian protesters. That's where he was when his
daughter, Lina, was born.
   When the couple returned to Tel Aviv a month later, Nurit's
family again abducted their daughter along with the infant.
   ``I called the aunt and she said, `We have Nurit, we have the
baby. Go to Gaza, go to hell,''' Zaki said.
   Zaki took the case to court in April and won custody of his
child. But the family again seized Nurit, and Jewish extremists
kidnapped the 2-month-old girl and gave her to Jewish settlers in
the occupied West Bank.
   The baby was found only after police detained and questioned
Nurit's father, uncle and brother. A court then issued the order
banning the Yehudas from approaching Nurit and Zaki's apartment.
   ``I fought so hard because I loved her,'' Zaki said of the ordeal
to live in peace with his Jewish wife.
   Nurit, who is pregnant again, said: ``We just want to raise our
children quietly.''

   Warplanes rumble overhead. Bombs whistle down and
explode, shaking the floor. Thick smoke wafts over the wreckage and
a woman's screams mingle with the reassuring tones of a Cockney air
raid warden.
   It's ``The Blitz Experience,'' a vivid museum display that gives
post-World War II generations a taste of London under German
bombardment.
   As those who lived through the 1940-42 bombing of London can
attest, ``The Blitz Experience'' is unnerving. The smoke smells
real, the ground really does shake, and the sounds are authentic
wartime recordings.
   ``The Blitz Experience,'' the centerpiece of the Imperial War
Museum's $31 million redevelopment, begins in a brick shelter like
those in which thousands of Britons cowered during air raids.
   For seven minutes, mostly in chilly darkness when the single
storm lantern is blown out, visitors listen to a raid launched in
the fall of 1940.
   ``If you lived in our street you'd have been in here, 12 hours a
night, night after night,'' says the recorded voice of George
Barker, a Cockney grocer who doubled as an air raid warden,
patrolling the streets in a tin hat, and who lost his shop to a bomb.
   There are moments of humor, in tribute to the legendary spirit of
the Londoners under siege, such as Barker remarking that a shop
whose front was blown up ``put out this big sign. Know what it says?
`More open than usual.'''
   Those on the recording sing ``Roll out the Barrel,'' breaking off
as a woman screams when a bomb explodes close by.
   When the all-clear siren sounds, Barker ushers everyone out,
saying: ``Let's see what Jerry's (the Germans) left us.''
   A man named Albert, who disdains the shelter and ``always sleeps
behind the bar,'' groans in the wreckage of his pub but is pulled
out alive.
   The London skyline is red with fire, an unexploded bomb lies
nearby, the firefighters are running out of water.
   ``Our house _ it ain't there,'' a woman says.
   A little boy hunts for his toys. His mother is heard coaxing him
away from the wreckage, promising him new toys.
   ``It's our job to make the terror, the horror and the sacrifice
as real to people who, we hope, will never experience it as those
who did,'' said the museum's director, Alan Borg.
   The Blitz, he said, has been mythologized by nostalgia. ``It
wasn't fun, and one of the aims of our experience is to show that it
must have been a terrifying thing to live through,'' he said.
   ``It's no good being serious and boring about it and saying
`you've got to listen to me!' I've got to get people in and say,
`this is interesting, come and see!' And then hopefully they'll
think about it.''
   Queen Elizabeth II, who served in the wartime Auxiliary
Territorial Service and whose Buckingham Palace home was bombed in
1940, will visit ``The Blitz Experience'' Thursday when she
officially opens the redeveloped museum.
   The museum arose from a government decision in March 1917 to
collect and display material from World War I.
   It is housed _ appropriately, some say _ in the building that was
the 19th century mental hospital known as Bedlam.
   Its extraordinary relics include caltrops, a sabotage instrument
with four spikes used by the ancient Romans and resurrected in World
War I to damage the feet of men and horses.
   Besides little tins labeled ``Queen Mary's Comforts for the
Troops'' from World War I _ needles and cotton, cigarettes and candy
_ there are guns and gas masks, tanks and two-man submarines,
uniforms and medals, fighter planes suspended from the ceiling,
100,000 books and the world's best war art collection of 12,000
paintings and drawings.
   Next year, it plans to open ``The Trench Experience,'' which will
expose visitors to the mud and smells of a World War I fighting
front.

   No sleeping on the Spanish Steps or foot-soaking in

   The Committee for Order and Public Safety also warned that a law
forbidding wearing bathing suits or revealing clothing will be
strictly enforced.
   This week's action came in response to demands by the area's
merchants and residents following an increase in the past month in
vagrancy, purse snatchings, drug dealing and attempted rapes.
   The mayor's office also promised 24-hour police patrols, better

   The fountain at the foot of the steps is a favorite of tourists,
who like to sit soaking their aching feet in the boat-shaped basin.

   Temperatures in southern and central
Sweden this week hit 82 degrees, the same as reported from the
Mediterranean resort island of Majorca _ good for vacationers but
not so hot for farmers.
   Or maybe a trifle too hot for farmers, who are complaining of the
worst drought in 50 years.
   The national news agency TT said the water table dropped by up to
a foot in parts of Sweden after a virtually snowless winter, dry
spring and early summer.
   Local authorities imposed irrigation bans in some areas,
including the Skane and Blekinge agricultural provinces in the
south, where rainfall in June was 20 to 50 percent below normal.
   Bans on campfires and warnings against forest fires also were
issued in many parts of the country.

<HEAD>Sudden Death A Growing Problem Among Overworked Japanese</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Japanese businessmen aren't concerned just about
market shares and interest rates. These days, some are wondering
whether their jobs might kill them.
   It's called ``karoshi'' _ death from overwork _ or ``pokkuri
byo'' _ sudden death. The number of such deaths among harried
Japanese businessmen is growing at an alarming rate, researchers say.
   Victims share a common pattern: sudden deaths from heart attacks
or strokes after months or years of extralong working hours under
heavy stress, says Dr. Kiyoyasu Arikawa, who advises executives on
how to reduce their risk.
   Arikawa found that sudden deaths among top executives have
skyrocketed in the past 20 years, from 10 in 1969 to about 150 in
1987. Recently, he says, the number of such deaths has grown fastest
among those in their 40s and 50s, men who on average could expect to
live to about 79.
   The risks of Japan's competitive work world were highlighted by
the sudden deaths in the past two years of several prominent men in
their 40s, including publishing executive Koremichi Noma, trading
company president Hirotoshi Inui, Fanuc Co. president Nobuo Hanaoka
and chairman of the mass media group Fuji Sankei, Haruo Shikanai.
   ``Pokkuri byo is a real concern among the businessmen I know,''
said Mitsuya Goto, a former Nissan Motor Co. executive who now heads
an international exchange center. ``They're all pretty concerned
about it.''
   Arikawa runs a clinic in a skyscraper in downtown Tokyo where he
counsels executives on how to minimize damage from their
stress-laden careers. The Arikawa Medical Counseling Club, with its
plush carpets, dim lighting and classical music, serves an elite
clientele.
   But sudden death is not confined to stressed executives.
   Various reports show such deaths occur among taxi drivers,
teachers, journalists, salespeople and maintenance workers.
   A hot line set up by a lawyers' group to handle inquiries from
families of people who suffered premature, sudden deaths estimates
that as many as 600 Japanese may have died of overwork last year.
   In Japan, where time spent on the job and personal sacrifice are
viewed as key measures of company loyalty, the temptation to
overwork is overwhelming, says Hiroshi Kawahito, a lawyer associated
with the hot line.
   ``People feel companies are more important than their individual
rights and they're praised by the company if they work hard. Their
pay and position depend on it,'' he said.
   Families of the victims are usually unprepared to cope with the
loss of a breadwinner. The hot line counsels them on how to obtain
government assistance and in some cases workmen's compensation.
   In over 95 percent of the cases, the government ruled against
paying workmen's compensation because it's difficult to prove
overwork was the cause of death, Kawahito says.
   In the past, the government required that families of sudden
death cases prove the victim was overworked on the day he died. It
now accepts evidence an overwork victim was under extreme stress in
the week before his death.
   For years, Noboru Fujii directed traffic on 24-hour shifts,
sometimes longer, every other day, with only six hours for naps and
meals at the Kobe Ferry Terminal in western Japan. He died at age 60
of a heart attack at work.
   In his case, the local labor standards office judged that Fujii
did die of overwork and awarded compensation to his family.
   Heart attacks and strokes are the second and third most common
causes of death in Japan, claiming 267,535 lives in 1987, 19.2
percent and 16.5 percent, respectively, of the 751,172 people who
died that year.
   Cancer killed 26.5 percent.
   Researchers say the underlying cause of sudden death is the
excessive competition inherent in Japanese society and working life.
   ``Japan lost (World War II) so we feel we have to work harder
than Americans and Europeans,'' says Kawahito.
   Competition and stress permeate the lives of overwork victims,
coupled with poor health habits attributable mostly to their busy
work schedules, Arikawa says.
   ``These people have no psychological or physical space or time
for themselves,'' the physician says. ``It's not so much that they
love to work, but they feel company loyalty demands that their whole
life be work.
   ``Mental stress, business stress and private problems accumulate
until the body just can't take any more.''
   Japanese companies, despite their reputation for concern for
workers' welfare, are just becoming aware of the problem, says Dr.
Tetsunojo Uehata of the National Institute of Public Health.
   ``Japanese with their diet of fish and vegetables traditionally
have good habits,'' says Uehata. ``Because of their jobs, however,
they are expected to go out drinking at night. They smoke, lose
sleep, eat poorly and have no chance to go to the doctor.''
   The government has embarked on a drive to reduce working hours,
but so far with little evidence of success.
   Japanese are on the job an average 2,150 hours a year, compared
with 1,924 hours in the United States and 1,655 hours in West
Germany, according to the Labor Ministry.
   A survey by the government-affiliated Leisure Development Center
in 1987 showed some firms require employees to work up to 3,000
hours a year.
   ``There's a very clear link between these work pressures and
health problems,'' says Uehata.

   Joe Howe, who proudly waves hundreds of
American flags daily atop the Capitol, believes flag burners should
be punished _ no matter what the Supreme Court says _ and says he
hopes he never meets one.
   Howe, 32, of Hollywood, Md., is foreman of the crew that spends
eight hours every weekday on the roof of the Capitol, raising and
lowering flags for members of Congress who send them to constituents
on request.
   For prices ranging from $7.38 to $56.25 each, depending on size
and such accessories as a pole and decorative eagle, constituents
can boast that their flags actually flew over the Capitol _ even if
only for a few seconds.
   ``I take pride in my work,'' Howe said in an interview during a
coffee break from his rooftop labors. ``How many people have the job
of flying the flag over the Capitol?''
   Howe would be surprised if there weren't a patriotic surge in
requests for flags inspired by the furor over the Supreme Court's
ruling last week that flag-burning is a form of free speech
guaranteed by the First Amendment.
   ``I don't agree with that decision, and you can quote me,'' Howe
said, ``and I don't agree with people who burn flags.''
   What would be suitable punishment for a flag burner? A lengthy
stint on Howe's work crew, raising flags on the Capitol roof in the
sweltering heat and suffocating humidity of summertime Washington?
   ``That's not stiff enough,'' Howe replied. He thought a moment
and added: ``I wouldn't want to be up there with someone who's
burned a flag.''
   Howe and his nine helpers raise and lower an average of more than
350 flags each weekday. They sometimes work on weekends to meet
requests for flags to be flown on special anniversary dates that
happen to fall on a Saturday or Sunday.
   The heaviest demand occurs on such patriotic holidays as Memorial
Day and the Fourth of July, when as many as 1,200 flags have been
flown in a single day.
   Using three small flagpoles on the roof of the House side of the
Capitol, they raise a flag for a few seconds, lower it and fold it
back into its box. In bad weather, they use six ropes equipped with
flag hooks under the sheltered skirt of the Capitol dome to ``fly''
their flags.
   The practice began in 1937, when a dozen flags were flown over
the Capitol for legislators' constituents. Last year, the number had
risen to more than 114,000. Altogether, more than 1.4 million flags
have been flown over the Capitol to meet public requests in the past
half-century.
   Down in the ``flag room'' in the Capitol basement, the busy
staging area for the flag flying operation, boxed flags are stacked
to the ceilings in four cramped rooms decorated with portraits of
Betsy Ross and a plaque bearing a poem titled ``Our Flag.''
   Chris Benza, who has run the flag room for 28 years, said the
public demand for the Stars and Stripes is growing so fast that
she's been promised a fifth storage room to handle the crush.
   ``The last few weeks we've been overwhelmed with flag requests,
and I don't know why,'' said William F. Raines, administrative
assistant to the Architect of the Capitol, who oversees the flag
program. Raines said the trend began before the Supreme Court's June
22 decision.
   Asked if the court ruling had any effect on her business, Ms.
Benza replied: ``I haven't noticed any yet, but it's possible we'll
get swamped.''

   Rene Wiegert, the original music
director of ``Cats'' and other hit Broadway shows has died at age 59.
   Wiegert died Monday at Arden Hill Hospital in Goshen. The cause
of death was not given.
   Before his retirement in 1986, Wiegert, a classical musician,
also was the musical director of ``Evita,'' ``Pippin,'' ``The Boys
From Syracuse,'' ``Oh Coward'' and ``Different Times,'' as well as
revivals of ``Oklahoma'' and ``South Pacific.''
   ``Rene Wiegert was an outstanding musician who knew how to get
the best from the singers and players he worked with,'' said
writer-composer Michael Martin Brown, who worked with Wiegert on
``Different Times,'' a Broadway show that opened in 1972 and for
which Wiegert was music director and conductor.
   Wiegert was born March 5, 1930, in St. Louis, and made his debut
at 16 as soloist with the St. Louis Symphony. He graduated in 1951
from the Juilliard School.
   His wife, June Wiegert, an actress and singer, died last year.
Survivors include his fiancee, Brandy Gebhards, and his father.

<HEAD>Return of Wolves to Yellowstone Urged</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RANDOLPH E. SCHMID</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Wolves have an undeserved bad reputation
because they howl at night and scare people, says a congressman who
wants the National Wildlife Service to consider returning the
animals to Yellowstone National Park.
   The issue drew Rep. Wayne Owens, D-Utah, and Morning Star, a
13-month-old female wolf, to the lawn outside the Capitol on
Wednesday. The animal was a relaxed center of attention at the
event, panting occasionally in the humidity and yawning as
wolf-advocates praised her docility.
   Owens is sponsoring a bill requiring the National Park Service to
study the effect of returning wolves to Yellowstone National Park.
   But in Cheyenne, Wyo., Sen. Alan K. Simpson termed Owens' effort
a ``misguided'' effort that does not consider the harm wolves could
cause to people in the area.
   At the center of the dispute is the gray wolf _ canis lupus _
once native to much of America but shot, trapped and poisoned nearly
to extinction over the last century or so. Today, only Alaska has
large numbers of wolves, with about 1,200 in northern Minnesota and
a few reported in Michigan and Montana.
   Wolves have gotten an undeserved bad reputation because they
``howl at night and scare people ... and compete with us for food,''
said Owens. ``Wolves don't eat little children.''
   ``It has been 60 years since a wolf's howl has been heard in
Yellowstone,'' added M. Rupert Cutler, president of the conservation
group Defenders of Wildlife. ``It never should have been silenced.''
   Wolves were exterminated from Yellowstone by hunters and
government trappers, Cutler noted, with the result that today
``thousands of elk and bison are over grazing the Yellowstone range
and many starve to death every winter.
   ``Wolves are needed in the Northern Rockies to restore the
natural balance among animals,'' said Cutler.
   Although backed by Defenders of Wildlife, the National Wildlife
Federation, the National Parks and Conservation Association and
other national and local conservation groups, Owens' measure may
face rough going due to opposition from ranchers who fear wolves
will eat their sheep and cattle.
   Simpson condemned Owens' bill as ``a misguided and zealous effort
to accelerate wolf reintroduction without considering in any way how
wolves will affect other animals in Yellowstone Park and the very
real human beings that also live in Wyoming.''
   Owens' bill requires the study to be completed by Dec. 31, 1991.

   A television personality's decision to
propose on the air didn't really surprise his girlfriend.
   Jed Mescon popped the question to Phyllis Bruce on Tuesday night
during ``Jed's Journal,'' his nightly feature segment WRCB-TV's
evening news broadcast.
   ``I feel like I owed Chattanooga. This is where I feel like I
became a professional and I wanted them to share in my joy,'' said
the 29-year-old Mescon.
   Mescon and Ms. Bruce, whom he describes as his best critic,
routinely watch his evening segment together, and when a camera crew
showed up at his apartment to catch her response to his taped
proposal, he told her it was to shoot a promotional spot. But she
suspected something was up.
   ``I was real nervous,'' said Ms. Bruce, 31. ``I started eating
coleslaw. I don't even like coleslaw. I couldn't swallow and there
was this camera in front of me.''
   She said yes.
   ``It was odd,'' Ms. Bruce said of the proposal, ``but I'm really
happy.''

   A plan to put ``Birthplace of Baseball'' on
New York's license plates is two-for-two with one batter to go.
   The Assembly on Wednesday gave final legislative approval to a
bill that would allow New Yorkers pay an extra $15 to have the
phrase on their license plates. The Senate earlier this month passed
the bill, which now goes to Gov. Mario Cuomo, who played minor
league baseball.
   The idea is to commemorate the 50th anniversary of the National
Baseball Hall of Fame in Cooperstown and the reputed 150th birthday
of the first baseball game, also supposedly played in Cooperstown.
   Some baseball researchers say the first game was really played in
1846 in Hoboken, N.J. New Jersey legislators have sent Cuomo a
petition asking him to veto the bill.
   Cuomo aides said the governor hasn't taken a position on the
bill. Unlike baseball, in government one strike and you're out.

   Studebaker's oldest salesman is still
hitting on all cylinders.
   A 1928 roadster that once roared 25,000 miles in 16 days at a New
Jersey racetrack will be entered in next year's coast-to-coast Great
American Race.
   The plucky Studebaker Commander joined the automaker's sales
force after its 1928 feat. With its convertible canvas top and deep
green leather seats, the car traveled another 25,000 miles to
dealerships nationwide promoting Studebaker.
   The Studebaker Corp. and its dealers have long disappeared,
victims in 1963 of the rough-and-tumble competition of the
automotive industry.
   But the company's once-famed Commander has another sales job, for
another boss. The car is owned now by the Studebaker National Museum.
   The 353 cubic-inch engine develops 86 horsepower teamed with a
three-speed standard transmission.
   ``One of the finest engines ever built,'' says John Hetman, the
89-year-old retired Studebaker mechanic who maintained the car
through the 1928 endurance test.

   The daughter of country singer Hank Williams
Sr. reached a settlement in her inheritance dispute against the
estate of her adoptive parents just before a jury was to decide the
case.
   Cathy Deupree Adkinson said Wednesday she was satisfied with the
settlement with her cousin, Stanley Fountain, but refused to
disclose the terms. The estate was valued at $600,000.
   Mrs. Adkinson said she filed the $5 million suit to ``set the
record straight.'' She said she loved her adoptive parents and they
loved her.
   ``This is not a happy time for either side,'' she said. She said
she's now returning to her music career. She performs as Jett
Williams.
   Mrs. Adkinson was born in Montgomery in 1953, five days after the
death of her father. Williams had lived with her mother, Bobbie
Jett, but they never married.
   In 1987, a judge ruled she was the singer's daughter but under
Alabama law was not entitled to an inheritance from his estate.
   Mrs. Adkinson, 36, was adopted by Mary Louise and Wayne Deupree.
The couple left their estate to Fountain and other relatives. Mrs.
Adkinson's attorneys charged that Mrs. Deupree was under the
influence of prescription drugs when she cut her adopted daughter
out of the will.
   Mrs. Adkinson also has litigation pending in New York over her
attempt to gain rights to some of Williams' songwriting royalties.

<HEAD>AMA Blasts Congressional Move to Limit Medicare Spending</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The nation's largest group of doctors says a
Medicare cost-control plan moving through Congress with Bush
administration support is nothing more than ``a health care
rationing scheme.''
   The American Medical Association attacked the House Ways and
Means Committee's approval Wednesday of a Medicare package that, for
the first time, sets a spending target for payments to physicians in
the program.
   The AMA has lobbied hard to derail this part of the package,
which is designed to help curb soaring growth in the Medicare
program by controlling the volume of services physicians provide to
Medicare patients.
   But so far the organization has been losing the battle, which has
put doctors against key House Democrats and Republicans as well as
the Bush administration.
   A spending target ``is nothing less than a health care rationing
scheme for senior citizens and the disabled covered by Medicare,''
Dr. Joseph T. Painter, vice chairman of the AMA board, said in a
statement after Wednesday's voice vote.
   ``Furthermore, what they are trying to do is make physicians do
the dirty work of deciding which services to cut,'' he said.
   Committee members, who voted in closed session, contend spending
targets will not erode the quality of health care provided to the 33
million elderly and disabled in the program but are needed to
contain its annual 15 percent growth.
   ``They're dead wrong,'' said Rep. Willis Gradison, R-Ohio,
ranking Republican on the Ways and Means health subcommittee. He
said the AMA's lobbying and advertising against the plan was ``an
obvious attempt to scare the frail and elderly.''
   Meanwhile, a group of House Republicans introduced legislation to
delay implementation of major provisions of Medicare's new
catastrophic illness protections, including a controversial income
tax surcharge. The measure introduced Wednesday has 25 sponsors and
is identical to one that failed to pass the Senate by one vote.
   The Congressional Budget Office estimates that just under 40
percent of the 33 million Americans eligible for Medicare have
enough income to subject them to the surtax.
   Under the Medicare savings package approved Wednesday, the first
spending target would be set for fiscal 1990 but would have no
impact on the Medicare budget that year. In future years, the target
along with a change in the payment structure for physicians would
help curb spending, backers say.
   Under the target system, if spending exceeded the target one
year, the excess could be recouped the following year by trimming
payment rates for services performed by physicians.
   Rep. Pete Stark, D-Calif., subcommittee chairman, said the effect
of the target on physicians fees ``will be imperceptible.'' He said
he doubted the change would give doctors reason to drop out of the
program and refuse to take Medicare patients.
   The American College of Surgeons successfully lobbied to have
their own expenditure target, separate from the one that would cover
all other physicians. The surgeons said they would support the
target proposal with that change.
   A third part of the plan is designed to protect Medicare patients
by limiting the amount they can be charged beyond the program's
reimbursement rate.

   The Securities and Exchange Commission is using
greed to battle greed.
   The agency, by a 5-0 vote Wednesday, decided to take advantage of
a new law giving it the power to offer cash rewards to tipsters who
provide information leading to the conviction of inside traders.
   Legislation enacted in November authorizes the SEC to pay
bounties of up to 10 percent of any civil fine it collects from
violators who use inside information to illegally profit or avoid
loss in securities markets.
   ``Rather than relying on scorned lovers or on people who weren't
dealt in on the inside information, it makes sense to treat this as
a business matter,'' said commission member Charles C. Cox.
   The commission will require bounty recipients to apply in
writing, starting when they first contact the SEC but no later than
180 days after a court imposes a fine. Within the 10 percent limit,
the SEC will have sole discretion to decide whether and how much to
pay.
   Meanwhile, in a separate case growing out of the Washington
Public Power Supply System default, the commission voted 5-0 to
adopt rules aimed at providing more information to purchasers of
government bonds.
   Congress included the bounty provision in broader legislation
passed in response to the wave of Wall Street corruption cases.
Inside trading can be difficult to detect and the goal was to
improve the government's chances of uncovering violations.
   The reward is aimed at volunteers rather than people already
subpoenaed by investigators, although anyone can apply.
   The securities industry has been skeptical, arguing that
informants will hold out for SEC rewards rather than passing their
knowledge on to firms' internal compliance officers.
   Gary G. Lynch, SEC enforcement director, said his investigators
have received about 25 tips that could be eligible for bounties
since the legislation passed in November.
   ``Several of the calls were extremely helpful,'' he said.
   Lynch said the agency will make every effort to preserve the
anonymity of bounty recipients when asked, but said it was possible
that a court could order release of an informant's name.
   The new municipal bond rules were written in response to the 1983
default on $2.25 billion in revenue bonds by the Washington Public
Power Supply System, the largest municipal bond default in U.S.
history.
   The system had issued the bonds to pay for the construction of
two nuclear power plants, but cost overruns forced it to abandon the
projects. The SEC decided last September that it could not pursue
enforcement action in the case because that would drain the agency's
resources.
   Instead, the SEC will require firms underwriting municipal bond
issues of more than $1 million to obtain and disclose more extensive
and timely information about the projects being financed and the
governments issuing the bonds.
   Commission member Joseph A. Grundfest said the new regulation
probably will not prevent defaults. But forcing disclosure of more
information will force issuers financing risky projects to pay
higher interest rates, he said.

   President Bush will nominate Commerce
Department official Alfred C. Sikes as the next chairman of the
Federal Communications Commission to succeed the deregulation-minded
Dennis R. Patrick.
   The White House said Wednesday that Sikes, a former Missouri
broadcaster, will fill the seat vacated in December 1987 by Mimi
Weyforth Dawson for the remainder of a five-year term that began
July 1, 1988.
   The commission has had only three of its five-member complement
since the 1987 resignations of Dawson and former chairman Mark S.
Fowler. Patrick, a Republican who often has clashed with Congress,
has been outnumbered by commissioners Patricia Diaz Dennis and James
H. Quello.
   Patrick announced in April he will resign upon confirmation of
his successor.
   Sen. Ernest Hollings, D-S.C., chairman of the Senate Commerce,
Science and Transportation Committee that oversees the FCC, refused
to consider replacements offered by then-President Reagan because of
congressional displeasure with Patrick.
   Hollings has expressed no opposition to Sikes and two other FCC
nominees Bush proposed two weeks ago: Washington attorney Sherrie P.
Marshall, a former Patrick aide, and Illinois Commerce Commission
member Andrew C. Barrett.
   Quello has said he will retire when his commission ends in 1991.
Dennis has indicated she would like to stay beyond Friday, when her
term expires, but no announcement of her fate has been made. If she
stays on, the commission will be at full strength for the first time
since 1987.
   Sikes, 49, an assistant secretary of commerce and head of the
National Telecommunications and Information Administration, is
considered a moderate on regulatory issues. He reportedly won out
over Marshall for the chairman's post because he was considered more
likely to be confirmed by the Senate.
   Sikes was being pushed for the job by Sen. John Danforth, R-Mo.,
a longtime friend and ranking minority member of the Senate Commerce
Committee.
   Danforth, through a spokesman, described Sikes as ``practical,
open and well-regarded in Congress ... He will be confirmed.''
   American Telephone &amp; Telegraph Co. also praised the selection of
Sikes.
   Sikes told FCC Week, an industry newsletter, last week: ``I would
describe myself as a flexible and moderate regulator. I don't
believe in regulation for regulation's sake.''
   Sikes said in in a statement released by his office Wednesday
that he is honored to be asked to lead the FCC ``during an
especially challenging period.''
   As head of NTIA since 1986, Sikes has helped formulate government
policy on telecommunications issues, including governmental
involvement in high-definition television, which is expected to be a
major business in the 1990s.

<HEAD>Unions to Picket Amtrak Friday; Railroad Expects No Disruptions</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Amtrak workers plan pickets and rallies in 25
cities Friday to appeal for higher wages and better working
conditions, but a railroad official says no disruptions in service
are expected.
   The Railway Labor Executives Association, speaking for 16 Amtrak
unions, accused the federally subsidized railroad of ``courting a
national strike'' by trying to cut employee benefits. The pickets
also will protest poor working conditions aboard trains, the unions
said.
   The last wage agreements were signed in 1986 and talks between
Amtrak and the individual unions are at various stages.
   Union leaders say they are being asked to take pay and benefit
cuts of up to 20 percent as Amtrak revenue is improving and
ridership is at record levels.
   ``The picketing Friday will be a warning to Congress and the
public,'' said Ed Wytkind, spokesman for the unions.
   An announcement described the planned picket lines and rallies as
``an attempt to avoid a nationwide strike against Amtrak.''
   The unions said they will protest ``substandard wages, unsafe and
unsanitary working conditions, contracting out and outright
union-busting.''
   Amtrak spokeswoman Sue Martin said officials expect the picketing
to cause no disruptions in service on the railroad's 24,000 miles of
rails serving 500 communities. She said no workers are expected to
walk off the job.
   ``I think we're a long way from a strike,'' she said.
   Ms. Martin said the company has been negotiating with the unions
separately for several months, with both sides applying for federal
mediation in some of the talks.
   She acknowledged that under present contracts, union workers earn
an average of about 12 percent less than employees of other
railroads, but said salaries are ahead of those for similar jobs in
other industries.
   For example, she said, employees who help passengers with luggage
make $23,000 a year, compared to $12,000 to $16,000 for similar jobs
at airports.
   Ms. Martin said the company is taking steps to improve safety and
sanitary conditions in 35 cars used to accommodate on-train
employees, including installation of emergency windows in all rooms
and overhaul of the cars to meet the same standards as passenger
cars. Eighteen of the crew cars have so far been refurbished, she
said.
   An employee was killed in a fire aboard a dormitory car last year.
   Joel Parker, a spokesman for on-board union employees, said
company demands would amount to $100-a-week pay cuts for some
workers.
   He said the union objects to the contracting out of reservations
work and could call a strike on that issue.
   Ms. Martin confirmed that some reservations work will be handled
by outside employees for the peak summer months. However, she said
that is allowed by union agreements and the outside workers will
supplement union workers, not replace them.
   The unions announced rallies in Los Angeles and Oakland, Calif.;
Chicago; Boston; Newark, N.J.; Philadelphia; Baltimore; and
Wilmington, Del. It also said picket lines will be set up at
stations in Seattle; Denver; Atlanta; Indianapolis; New Orleans;
Lorton and Richmond, Va.; New York City; Albany, N.Y.; Canton, Ohio;
Pittsburgh and Altoona, Pa.; Washington D.C., and Sanford, Tampa,
Jacksonville and Miami, Fla.

   A former prostitute has received her
punishment by becoming infected with AIDS, a judge said in sparing
her from prison.
   Elizabeth Kay Sherouse, seriously ill with the deadly disease,
was once charged with attempted manslaughter for having sex with two
men while knowing she had the AIDS virus.
   Those charges were dropped, but Miss Sherouse, 26, appeared
before Circuit Judge Michael Cycmanick on Tuesday for sentencing on
six prostitution-related misdemeanors for which should could have
been sentenced to more than four years in prison.
   The judge placed her on four years' probation, and sent her home
to spend her remaining days with her family.
   ``There is no question that punishment in this case is what you
have sustained and are enduring because of your conduct,'' Cycmanick
told her.
   Miss Sherouse has been living under house arrest with her mother
for more than a year. She was just released from a hospital after a
weeklong bout with pneumonia and weighs 88 pounds.
   Defense lawyer Bill Sheaffer said she sleeps up to 15 hours a
day, eats and sees a doctor.
   ``Any sentence this court imposes would equal a life sentence for
Miss Sherouse,'' Sheaffer told the judge.
   With the probation order, the judge closed the case that cast a
prostitute and drug addict with a seventh-grade education in the
national spotlight.
   Her arrest in December 1987 is believed to have been the first of
a prostitute charged with attempted manslaughter in an AIDS-related
case.
   The two men wore condoms and have since tested negative for the
virus.
   Cycmanick dismissed the attempted manslaughter charges last year,
saying Miss Sherouse showed no intent to kill the men. An appeals
court upheld the judge's ruling, saying the charges did not fit the
crime.
   Earlier this year, Cycmanick also dismissed racketeering charges,
and she pleaded guilty to the six misdemeanors.
   ``The protection of society is best served ... by the home
confinement restrictions that I've assigned,'' said the judge.
   Sheaffer said Wednesday Miss Sherouse was ``relieved that she can
return home to her family. ... Her health is not good.''
   Assistant State Attorney Rick Bogle, who in the past has argued
that Miss Sherouse be imprisoned, agreed with the defense lawyer on
his request for probation.

   ``All I can say is we're in good company,'' said Leonard Gross,
of Our Lady of the Rosary parish. ``David had a lot of opposition
when he went up against Goliath.''
   Wayne County Circuit Judge James A. Hathaway on Wednesday refused
to grant an injunction barring the Detroit Archdiocese's order to
close the churches, saying courts shouldn't settle religious
disputes.
   But the judge agreed to consider issuing a temporary stay of
Cardinal Edmund Szoka's order to close the churches. The delay would
give opponents a chance to go to the Michigan Court of Appeals. A
hearing was scheduled for this afernoon.
   Outside the courthouse, more than 150 demonstrators marched and
sang ``We Shall Overcome'' to protest the closings. Some carried
signs that read: ``Jesus would be in this demonstration'' and ``We
pray the judge to save our church.''
   ``It was Jesus' idea that we love one another, and with a little
effort we can do that,'' Hathaway told a packed courtroom. ``This
idea of walking around with posters and haranguing each other _ I
don't want to see that.
   ``We need to approach the matter from the point of trying to heal
differences rather than exacerbate them.''
   The 17 churches involved in the lawsuit are among 30 that Szoka
contends are no longer financially viable. Since the cardinal issued
his order in January, the 1.5 million-member archdiocese has closed
16 parishes, including five last weekend.
   Five of the 17 parishes that went to court have permission to
remain open until July 16, and four others have longer extensions
tied to priests' retirements or church anniversaries, archdiocese
spokesman Jay Berman said. The eight others in the lawsuit already
have closed.
   As hundreds of thousands of Catholics joined the white and
middle-class flight to the Detroit suburbs in recent decades, fewer
than 50,000 Catholics remained in the nation's sixth-largest city,
according to a church survey.
   Robert Van Cleef, an attorney for the parishioners, argued
Wednesday that Szoka reneged on a promise to conduct open grievance
hearings before closing parishes.
   ``If these churches close, they will be destroyed,'' Van Cleef
said. ``They'll never come back.''
   But Szoka's attorney, Joseph Sullivan, said church members
wouldn't suffer by having their parishes closed until all appeals to
the Vatican are exhausted.
   ``It's a little bit difficult for me to understand that
worshiping at a church a few blocks away or a half-mile or a mile
from where one used to worship is a serious problem,'' he said.
   Church members said Wednesday they haven't lost all hope of
saving their parishes.
   ``I think another judge would have ruled differently,'' said
Sister Jolene Van Handel of Nativity Catholic Church, one of 25
parishes given until 1990 to increase membership and improve
finances or also be closed. ``We have to keep going. We don't have
much choice.''
   Last week, priests, nuns and parishioners from nine churches said
they would defy the closing order. In several cases, they have held
services outside locked buildings.
   But determination to resist the closings began to crumble when
Szoka announced Friday that the Vatican had rejected appeals filed
in March by 14 parishes.
   A second appeal will be filed with the Vatican Supreme Court, and
parishioners will petition Pope John Paul II if that attempt fails,
Van Cleef said.

   Efforts to fund a $5 billion atom-smasher in
Texas _ President Bush's home state _ now move to the Senate as part
of an $18.5 billion spending bill for energy and water projects.
   House members, fearing that water projects in their own states
might also falter, voted overwhelmingly against an amendment
Wednesday to delete Bush's request for the superconducting super
collider from the measure.
   Later approved on a voice vote, the fiscal 1990 spending measure
for energy and water projects also quadruples funds _ to $636
million _ for environmental cleanups at the nation's nuclear weapons
plants.
   Similar legislation has yet to move through the Senate, where
another attempt may be made to eliminate $110 million to begin
construction on the high-energy physics research project.
   Located 25 miles south of Dallas, the project would consist of
two giant rings 53 miles around for accelerating and colliding
protons into each other in an effort to examine subatomic particles.
   Physicists hope the device, to be completed in 1999, will enable
them to duplicate for the first time _ but on an infinitesimally
small scale _ the conditions of the ``big bang'' theory of creation.
   ``The SSC is a critical part of this administration's initiative
to strengthen the position of the nation as a world leader in
science and technology,'' the White House said in a statement
Wednesday.
   ``It will produce discoveries, innovations and spinoffs that
could touch profoundly on every American.''
   Opponents expressed fears that the super collider's construction
cost will balloon to $900 million a year and squeeze out funds for
research on improving computers and finding a cancer cure.
   But the attempt to delay construction was defeated on a 330-93
vote after Bush personally appealed to key legislators.
   Chief among them was Rep. Tom Bevil, D-Ala., who as chairman of
the House Appropriations energy and water development subcommittee,
holds the spending keys to hundreds of water projects in every state.
   Rep. Sherwood Boehlert, R-N.Y., one of the sponsors of the
amendment to strike super collider construction funds from the bill,
said the effort failed partly because of widespread fears of
antagonizing Bevil.
   The bill includes $1.1 billion for construction of 93 Army Corps
of Engineer water projects _ 37 of them new _ in 39 states plus $661
million for Interior Department water projects in 10 western states.
   The Energy Department has put a $4.9 billion price tag on the
super collider project, but the Congressional Budget Office
estimates it will cost at least $6.4 billion.

   Actress Amy Irving filed for divorce from
filmmaker Steven Spielberg.
   The Superior Court petition cited irreconcilable differences in
requesting an end to the 3{-year marriage.
   Ms. Irving's petition, filed Wednesday by attorney Norman M.
Dolin, said a written agreement has disposed of the couple's
property. She seeks child support and joint custody of the couple's
4-year-old son, Max.
   Spielberg and Ms. Irving announced in April their intention to
divorce.
   ``Our mutual decision, however difficult, has been made in a
spirit of caring, and our friendship remains both personal and
professional,'' their joint statement said.
   The couple was married in November 1985 in Santa Fe, N.M.
   Ms. Irving was nominated for the 1983 Academy Award for best
supporting actress for her role in ``Yentl,'' and recently won
acclaim in the film ``Crossing Delancey.''
   Spielberg has produced or directed some of Hollywood's most
successful movies, including ``Close Encounters of the Third Kind,''
and ``Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade.''

<HEAD>Study Sees U.S. Agriculture More Dependent on Free Market</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Farm Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A private study shows that farm policy is
gradually moving toward the free market and away from reliance on
government programs that date back to the early 1930s.
   ``The evolution of agricultural policy toward less government
intervention and control is a very positive trend, based on
fundamental economic and social changes,'' the report said.
``Agriculture today is very different than it was in the 1930s when
most of our current programs were designed.''
   The study, released by Washington consultants Lesher, Russell and
Moos for the farm industry's Agricultural Policy Working Group, said
agriculture is ``a much more integral part of the national economy''
today than 60 years ago.
   Farms also more closely resemble non-agricultural businesses
across the nation than farms of half a century ago, the study said.
   Farm law passed in 1985 expires next year, and Congress has begun
preliminary work on a 1990 bill.
   Although the current law _ the Food Security Act of 1985 _ is
noted for its major commodity programs and their various
price-support mechanisms, it includes provisions for food stamps,
nutrition, conservation, trade, credit, research and many other
functions.
   The study concentrates on the crop programs, including wheat,
feed grains, cotton and soybeans, and their effect on the nation's
economy.
   Officials of the consulting company include Bill Lesher and Randy
Russell, senior economists in the Agriculture Department in the
early Reagan years and chief architects of the 1985 farm
legislation. Gene Moos is a former agricultural aide to House
Speaker Thomas S. Foley, D-Wash.
   Members of the sponsoring group are major companies deeply
involved in agricultural-related enterprises _ Cargill Inc., Central
Soya Company Inc., Louis Dreyfus Corp., IMC Fertilizer Group Inc.,
Monsanto Co., Nabisco Brands Inc., and Norfolk Southern Corp.
   The study was done by Government Research Corp., part of the
public relations firm Hill and Knowlton, and Economic Perspectives
Inc. of McLean, Va., part of Sparks Commodities Inc. of Memphis,
Tenn.
   One course, the study said, would be for Congress to extend
current farm law, which ``is regarded to have worked well.'' But
tacking on another five years ``would produce a stagnant sector,
severely limited by sluggish market growth.''
   Another option calling for ``planting flexibility'' would retain
the basic structure of the 1985 farm law but without specific crop
acreage bases. Instead, the acreage bases for such crops as wheat,
corn and cotton _ plus the acreage typically planted to soybeans _
would be combined into a single farm base.
   Acreage idling programs would still be used to control
production, but the set-asides would be from the whole farm base,
not specific crop bases.
   The flexibility option over five years would result in smaller
annual carryover supplies, or surpluses, ``faster market growth and
somewhat higher incomes'' for farmers, the report said.
   A third option would be to continue federal income supports to
farmers, but without annual requirements for idling specific crop
acreages. Farmers would be free to plant what they choose.
   The report said this would require ``a transition period, during
which prices and sales receipts would decline,'' but that declining
farm income could be avoided by making federal income support
payments larger in the early years.
   ``Following about two years of adjustment, increased market
growth would bring price recovery and higher incomes as well,'' the
report said.
   But analysts said that perhaps the greatest difference between
this and other options is what it could mean for the future.
   ``As U.S. products become more competitive and more widely
available, markets expand significantly, resulting in much stronger
future growth,'' they said.

   The Agriculture Department expanded a drought
emergency measure to permit hay cuttings on land taken out of
production under the long-term Conservation Reserve Program.
   Effective immediately, qualifying farmers in counties where a
livestock emergency has been determined to exist may cut hay from
``permanent wildlife habitat'' acres enrolled in the CRP, officials
said Wednesday.
   ``Haying may not be closer than 20 feet to shrubs or trees
established as part of the habitat practice and is subject to the
earlier provision that at least 25 percent of the field much be left
undisturbed for wildlife cover,'' the department said.
   Haying of alfalfa used for temporary cover was also authorized,
providing the ground is prepared immediately for planting permanent
cover at the next normal opportunity for seeding.

   Agriculture Secretary Clayton Yeutter says milk
price supports will be cut sharply on July 1, removing a temporary
increase ordered last year to help drought-stricken dairy farmers.
   Congress specified in the Disaster Assistance Act of 1988 that
milk price supports be boosted 50 cents per 100 pounds from April 1
through June 30. That put the basic support price at $11.10 per
hundredweight.
   Effective July 1, the support will revert back to the $10.60
level, Yeutter said Wednesday.
   The National Milk Producers Federation had estimated the
three-month boost of 50 cents per hundredweight provided an
additional $300 million in revenues for dairy farmers.

<HEAD>North Trial Juror Says She Forgot About Brother's Prison Record</HEAD>
<HEAD>EDS: Lead prospects uncertain; ruling expected in late afternoon</HEAD>

   A juror in Oliver North's trial acknowledges
she forgot to disclose her brother's prison record when she was
being considered for jury duty in the Iran-Contra case.
   U.S. District Judge Gerhard A. Gesell said he would rule today on
claims by North's lawyers that juror Tara King's misstatements
tainted the proceedings that led to North's conviction on three
felony counts.
   Gesell's most serious remedy would be to grant a mistrial.
   Ms. King testified at a hearing Wednesday that she forgot to
disclose on a jury questionnaire form that her brother, Samuel King,
served a year in prison for armed robbery and that she had been
subpoenaed and testified before a grand jury investigating that case.
   Ms. King answered ``no'' in filling out a jury questionnaire Feb.
1 when asked whether she or any member of her immediate family had
ever been involved in a court proceeding or an investigation.
   ``I had forgotten about it after I shed tears ... I couldn't let
it tear me down,'' she testified.
   Ms. King also acknowledged she failed to note her brother's
military service on the juror questionnaire.
   North lawyer Brendan Sullivan asked whether she had omitted it
``for fear someone would check'' and find out the rest of his
background.
   ``That never crossed my mind,'' said Ms. King, who works as a
copy machine operator. She said she was only 2 years old when Sam
King was in the military. She is 34, while he is 51.
   ``It's all coming back to me now,'' Ms. King said at one point as
Sullivan went over documents in the armed robbery investigation.
   North's sentencing had been set for June 23 but was postponed to
July 5 when the juror problem arose. He faces up to 10 years in
prison for aiding and abetting in obstruction of Congress,
destroying or mutilating official documents and accepting a gratuity.

   The U.S. dollar edged down against the Japanese yen
Thursday, while the key index on the Tokyo Stock Exchange plunged.
   The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues, a 223.61-point
loser the previous day, shed another 289.29 points, or 0.87 percent,
ending the day's trading at 32,956.31.
   The dollar ended at 142.90 yen, down 0.65 yen from Wednesday's
close of 143.55 yen. The currency opened at 143.15 yen and ranged
between 142.85 yen and 143.38 yen.
   Naoto Kawamura, a senior dealer with the Bank of Tokyo, said the
dollar met ``profit-taking selling during early trading, with some
investors trying to cut their long-dollar postions.''
   Kawamura, however, said there were fewer investors to buy the yen
because of political uncertainty in Japan.
   On Wednesday, major Japanese newspapers reported that Prime
Minister Sousuke Uno had expressed his desire to resign over reports
that a new sex scandal involving Uno may be carried in a magazine
later his week. Uno, in office less than a month, denied any
intention to resign.

   Former Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos has
suffered liver failure and the prognosis was ``extremely poor,'' a
hospital administrator said Wednesday night.
   ``Mr. Marcos is semi-comatose, his condition has worsened and
he's not recognizing friends or family,'' said Eugene Tiwanak,
assistant administrator of St. Francis Medical Center, where the
exiled former leader has been hospitalized more than five months.
   ``Everything that can be done has been done. We are hoping for a
miracle,'' Marcos' wife, Imelda, said in an interview outside the
hospital. ``If we could just tell him he could go home, I know that
would save him.''
   The Marcoses' son, Ferdinand ``Bong Bong'' Marcos Jr., also was
at the hospital but declined to talk to reporters.
   The couple's daughter Irene Araneta was on her way to Honolulu
from California, aides said.
   Marcos, who has not been allowed to return to the Philippines,
has been listed in critical condition.
   Marcos suffered heart, lung and kidney failure late last month,
and has been on life-support equipment since.
   ``He's still on the respirator and he's still undergoing kidney
dialysis, but his prognosis is extremely poor,'' Tiwanak said.
   The 71-year-old Marcos has been plagued by a widespread infection
that was not responding to antibiotics, Tiwanak said.
   ``Doctors are trying to treat him, but he's not responding,''
Tiwanak said. ``His fever is real high _ around 103 _ and his
heartbeat is irregular.''
   Marcos and his wife have lived in Honolulu since a 1986 popular
revolt catapulted Corazon Aquino to the presidency, ending his
20-year rule.
   The Marcoses are under indictment in the United States, accused
of stealing more than $100 million from the Philippine treasury and
stashing it in the United States.

<HEAD>Florakis Holds Kingmaker's Position in Divided Greece</HEAD>

<DATELINE>ATHENS, Greece (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A fatherly figure sentenced to death more
than 40 years ago for his communist activities holds the key to a
political deadlock that has gripped Greece since elections failed to
form a government.
   Harilaos Florakis, the 75-year-old leader of the Coalition of the
Left and Progress, has suddenly been thrust into the limelight as he
approaches the twilight of his political career.
   Florakis, jailed for 17 years after the country's civil war, has
spent his entire career criticizing the United States and its bases
in this NATO nation and pressing each government in office to
withdraw from the alliance.
   His coalition, dominated by Florakis' pro-Moscow Greek Communist
Party (KKE), won 28 parliamentary seats in the June 18 general
election _ enough to play the kingmaker's role.
   The incumbent Panhellenic Socialist Movement (PASOK) took 125
seats and the conservative New Democracy won 145 but neither can
govern without leftist suppport because a majority is needed in the
300-member parliament.
   ``Florakis has become the grand old man of Greek politics. No one
could imagine years ago that a Communist would play such an
important role in our political life,'' said a conservative deputy
who spoke on condition of anonymity.
   Florakis emerged as a leader in the illegal Greek communist
movement after fighting alongside national resistance forces against
the Nazis during World War II.
   Two years after the Nazis left, communists under the guise of a
Greek Liberation Army attempted to seize power, kicking off a bloody
three-year civil war that ended in 1949 and a humiliating defeat for
the Communists.
   Florakis, then a 33-year-old idealist with training as a
telegraphist, led the Communist 1st Regiment of the Greek Liberation
Army and was condemned to death by a military tribunal for his role
in the civil war.
   Like thousands of Communists who fought and lost against the
American-backed Greek Nationalist Army, he was imprisoned. Others
were exiled to barren islands or remote villages. Thousands of
Communists also fled to East Bloc countries and the Soviet Union,
never knowing when they could return home.
   But time healed many wounds as Communist exiles slowly came back
to Greece. In December 1982, Premier Andreas Papandreou, head of a
socialist administration, allowed mass repatriation in an effort at
national reconciliation.
   Florakis spent 17 years in prison for his communist activities,
which should have made him bitter, but colleagues say he holds no
grudge.
   The pipe-smoking, silver-haired Florakis, a widower who never had
children, looks more today like a college professor with his
conservative dress.
   In a spirit of political change, conservative premier Constantine
Caramanlis officially recognized the KKE in 1974, months after the
collapse of a seven-year military dictatorship. And with
recognition, Florakis was appointed secretary general, the KKE's top
position.
   Florakis now holds the balance of power. So far he has been able
to frustrate attempts by New Democracy and PASOK at forming a
coalition government.
   He says he wants a coalition of ``widespread acceptance'' that
can fully examine Greek political life, especially former PASOK
ministers accused of involvement in a multimillion-dollar
embezzlement scandal at the Bank of Crete.
   ``We want a government that will not be accused of attempting to
cover up the scandals, a government that will not be accused of
seeking revenge,'' he said.

   Hundreds of imprisoned Chinese activists are in
danger of being executed ``on the whim of officialdom'' and their
safety may depend on protests from abroad, Amnesty International
said today.
   The international human rights organization said its fears for
hundreds of people detained since the pro-democracy movement was
violently crushed June 4 were based on China's ``notorious record''
of executions and unfair trials.
   Chinese authorities have announced 27 executions since soldiers
killed hundreds of unarmed civilians in clearing central Beijing of
protesters.
   Amnesty said there have been 33 executions, though unconfirmed
``unofficial reports'' estimated that hundreds have been put to
death. About 1,800 people have been arrested.
   The group said China's practice of ``verdict first, trial
second'' resulted in as many as 30,000 people being executed in an
anti-crime drive between 1983 and 1987, many after unfair and
summary trials.
   Offenses ranged from murder and rape to stealing bicycles,
hanging political slogans and stealing museum antiques.
   ``In such a situation, the lives of defendants facing capital
charges depend totally on the whim of officialdom,'' Amnesty said in
a statement. ``Their only hope may be the voices raised on their
behalf outside China by governments and ordinary people around the
world.''
   The group rejected the notion that Chinese authorities are
impervious to foreign pleas for restraint, noting that recent
efforts to reassure visiting trade delegations ``shows their concern
for world opinion.''
   Those executed this month were charged with violent offenses, but
``there is no way of determining whether the charges bore any
relation to reality'' because of the swiftness of the proceedings
and the absence of adequate safeguards for the defense, Amnesty said.
   ``Our concerns are heightened by the number of people believed to
have been arrested after the nationwide demonstrations in May and
early June and the danger of many of them being charged with the
wide battery of capital offenses provided for by Chinese law,'' it
said.
   China has announced that 10 people were executed because of the
unrest, and accused the 17 others of ``seriously endangering public
order.''
   Amnesty said trials and appeals are usually ``mere formalities''
in China, that people are often executed within days of arrest, and
that there is no presumption of innocence in Chinese law.
   It said many accused are not given enough time to prepare a
defense and that lawyers may meet clients only when the indictment
is served. In death penalty and other serious cases, the law permits
courts to give a copy of the indictment to defendants only when the
trial starts, it said.
   ``The world must make the Chinese government aware that human
rights violations on the scale of the past few weeks will not be
forgotten,'' said Amnesty, winner of the 1977 Nobel Peace Prize.

   ``Momentum has been lost, but the public should know that we will
be working to find a way to patch this together,'' Rep. Les AuCoin,
D-Ore., said after emerging from a joint meeting of the Oregon and
Washington state congressional delegations Wednesday.
   Last-minute efforts to revive a compromise that came out of a
weekend ``timber summit'' collapsed Wednesday and congressmen said
they would not try and attach it to the House interior
appropriations bill today.
   However, legislative action may still be possible when the Senate
considers the spending bill in late July.
   AuCoin and other lawmakers blamed environmentalists for scuttling
the compromise, but officials of national environmental groups said
they too were prepared to continue negotiations and thought the
proposal offered a framework for a possible solution.

<NOTE>Report Says 40 Percent Of Hispanic Children Living In Poverty</NOTE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Nearly 40 percent of Hispanic children are
living in poverty, yet federal policy makers continue to overlook
their needs, according to a Latino advocacy group.
   A report by the National Association of Latino Elected and
Appointed Officials released this week said a Hispanic child is born
into poverty in this country every 3{ minutes.
   NALEO said two of five Hispanic children in 1987 was living at or
below the poverty level of $11,611 for a family of four.
   ``Moreover, the increasing growth of the Hispanic population, a
community which has increased by 30 percent from 1980 to 1987, in
addition to the relative youth of the community, compounds an
already alarming situation,'' the report said. ``Simply stated,
significant numbers of Hispanic children constitute a population at
risk.''
   While Hispanic children comprise approximately 10 percent of all
children in the United States, they represent 27 percent of all
children in poverty, the report said.
   ``Yet the unique needs of Hispanic children in poverty continue
to be overlooked by the nation's federal policy makers, civil
affairs researchers, and the media,'' the report said.

<NOTE>Efforts to Streamline Nuclear Licensing Suffer Setback</NOTE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A House panel has dealt a major setback to
efforts by nuclear power supporters to simplify and shorten reactor
licensing.
   The Energy and Commerce Committee on Wednesday voted 22-20 to
omit from a Nuclear Regulatory Commission budget bill a provision
that would have allowed a utility to get both a construction permit
and an operating license at the same time.
   Under current law, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission must wait
until construction is complete to commence hearings on whether to
grant an operating license.
   A major streamlining of commission rules, which took effect last
month, limits the issues that can be raised in hearings on an
operating license. But without legislation the commission may not do
away with that step.
   The industry believes the new commission rules will not produce
the simplification the commission expects and will not do enough to
remove uncertainty.
   The industry has complained for years that the two-stage process
takes too much time and causes too much financial risk, since the
second hearing opens the door to last-minute challenges that can
kill plants that already are completed.

<HEAD>HUD Audit: Healthy Apartment Projects Got Undeserved Federal Money</HEAD>

   The Department of Housing and Urban Development
gave millions of dollars in aid to apartment projects around the
country in 1987 and 1988 that did not meet the department's
eligibility requirements, according to an auditor's report.
   The funds came from a special discretionary fund controlled by
Thomas Demery, then an assistant HUD secretary, that was intended to
help financially ailing projects insured by the Federal Housing
Administration, according to the report released Wednesday by Rep.
Bill Green, R-N.Y.
   Green said the audit of 25 projects that got grants in the 1987
and 1988 fiscal years showed found 11 did not meet HUD
qualifications and that $30 million to $35 million ``went to
undeserving or low-need projects.''
   ``That also means more needy projects went without help and some
of those ultimately failed, adding to the FHA's insurance costs,''
said Green, a former HUD regional housing administrator and the
ranking Republican on the House Appropriations housing subcommittee.
   ``Many of the discretionary funds were made in direct conflict
with existing Office of Housing policies,'' the report concluded,
according to today's editions of The New York Times.
   ``Documentation was not available to justify why these policies
were not followed for the particular awards,'' the Times quoted the
report as saying. ``Consequently, these awards raise concern as to
whether any other factors entered into the decision-making process.''
   In some cases, local HUD offices had recommended against awarding
federal assistance to the apartment projects, while in others, the
local HUD office was bypassed, according to the audit of the Section
8 Discretionary Loan Management Set-Aside Program.
   In one instance, a Chicago apartment owner received $11 million
from HUD even though the apartment building had 100 percent
occupancy, no tenants paying more than 40 percent of their income in
rent, and was rated by HUD as being at no financial risk.
   The audit covered grants for the 1987 and 1988 fiscal years; the
report was completed March 31, 1989.
   The program was designed to avoid failures of troubled housing
projects insured by HUD through the FHA. Failure requires HUD to
assume the mortgages.
   Under the program, projects with low vacancy rates and-or low
tenant income levels are eligible for subsidies to improve a
building's cash flow and ability to meet mortgage payments.
   Many of the projects receiving awards did not file formal
requests for aid through local HUD offices but went directly to
headquarters, according to the audit.
   Demery told the Times that decisions were made only on merit and
need.

<HEAD>Japan Welcomes Accord on U.S. Access to Tokyo Cellular Phone Market</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Government and industry officials today welcomed an
agreement that would open Japan's multibillion dollar Tokyo
marketplace to American cellular telephones and ease restraints on
business radios.
   The agreement, reached in Washington Wednesday after 10 days of
high-level talks, averts a threatened showdown on U.S.-Japan
telecommunications trade. Washington had said it was prepared to
impose tariffs of as much as 100 percent on more than 50 Japanese
electronics exports.
   ``I am very pleased that the significance of our country's effort
and proposals toward solving the issue was understood by the U.S.
government. I hope again that the latest agreement will contribute
to maintaining and developing Japan-U.S. friendly relations,''
Kanezo Muraoka, minister of Posts and Telecommunications, told a
news conference Wednesday night.
   Prime Minister Sousuke Uno, meeting Japanese reporters this
morning, also hailed as ``very good'' the accord reached between the
two countries, Kyodo News Service said.
   The latest agreement affects cellular phones and ``third-party''
radios, including pagers and equipment for dispatching taxis and
delivery trucks.
   Motorola Inc., the major American maker of cellular phones and
business radios, based in Schaumberg, Ill. contended that the
Japanese restrictions were caysing it $2 billions in lost sales of
five years.
   The American company began selling its cellular phones in Japan
through a Japanese company, Daini-Denden Inc., in 1987.
   But Motorola's phones do not work in the Tokyo area, because
Motorola equipment is not compatible with the cellular phone network
operated by Japan's giant Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corp.
   ``We highly value that U.S. retaliation was avoided by the
settlement,'' Haruo Ozawa, an executive director of the
Communications Industry Association of Japan, a grouping of 230
telecommunications equipment makers, said in a statement.
   But Ozawa said Japanese industry should not be optimistic about
future trade relations, as the countries' trade imbalance has yet to
be solved. According to U.S. figures, the United States ran a $52
billion trade defict with Japan last year.

   A prosecutor hailed the racketeering convictions
of seven men linked to 11 killings as a victory over some of ``the
most vicious and violent'' mobsters.
   ``The number and ferocity of the crimes charged and proved in
this case are difficult to comprehend for normal individuals,'' U.S.
Attorney Benito Romano said. ``They ruled their turf with absolute
disregard for human life.''
   Five of the defendants were involved in the slayings that
prosecutors claimed were carried out in connection with other crimes
committed by associates of the Gambino family.
   The crimes included narcotics trafficking, pornography, auto
theft, loan sharking and extortion.
   Among those slain were witnesses and intermediaries for Florida
drug dealers. Some victims were dismembered and put in garbage bags.
   A defense attorney, Benjamin Brafman, said there would be an
appeal.
   He said the verdict showed the ``patent unfairness'' of a
multidefendant trial, which took 17 months and was one of the
longest federal criminal trials ever.
   ``If you put enough defendants in a room and enough criminal
charges in an indictment and if the trial takes long enough, the
jurors will feel an obligation to convict in light of the enormous
time and expenditure of the government,'' he said.
   After the verdict, U.S. District Judge Vincent L. Broderick
immediately revoked the bail of all but one defendant.
   ``These defendants were the most vicious and violent members and
associates of organized crime that have ever been brought to
trial,'' Romano said. ``New Yorkers can feel a little safer today
and the mob, I think, considerably weaker.''
   Prosecutors said the crew, which operated out of an apartment in
Brooklyn, was headed by Roy DeMeo, who was killed by gang members in
a power struggle in 1983.
   Jurors, who heard 207 witnesses, appeared grim and tired as the
foreman read back guilty verdicts on all 17 counts.
   They had deliberated 12 days.
   The numerous murder allegations were part of racketeering and
conspiracy charges against Anthony Senter, 34, Ronald Ustica, 44,
Joseph Testa, 34, Salvatore Mangialino, 52, and Douglas Rega, 39.
   Other defendants convicted of racketeering in counts that did not
include murder allegations were Sol Hellman, 63, and Carlo Profeta,
46. Hellman was allowed to remain free on bail.
   Testa and Senter, who were convicted of conspiring to murder a
witness against the stolen car operation, face possible life
sentences. The other defendants could receive prison terms of 20
years.
   Broderick scheduled sentencing for Sept. 13.
   The case, which dates from a 1984 indictment, is one of the last
in a series of widely publicized, mob-related prosecutions brought
by then-U.S. Attorney Rudolph Giuliani.
   The original 78-count indictment charged that Paul Castellano
headed a racketeering enterprise, the Gambino family.
   U.S. District Judge Kevin T. Duffy, who originally had the case,
broke it up in 1985, with the first trial focusing on a car-theft
ring that allegedly stole hundreds of cars in New York.
   Before the conclusion of that case, Castellano was slain outside
a restaurant. Eventually six of eight defendants in that trial were
convicted of various charges.

<TEXT>
   A new, experimental version of a drug that
interrupts heart attacks is a step toward cutting treatment cost and
possibly reducing risk of a second heart attack after therapy, a
researcher says.
   Laboratory results reported today are part of an effort to create
a version of tissue plasminogen activator that will work longer in
the body, said Joseph Sambrook.
   A longer-lasting version might make treatment cheaper by
permitting smaller doses of the drug, called TPA, he said.
   TPA treatment, which costs about $2,000, requires a continuous
infusion over a few hours because a given dose works only briefly.
In contrast, treatment with a drug called streptokinase,
administered in a single injection, costs about one-tenth as much.
   TPA stops heart attacks by dissolving blood clots. Most heart
attacks occur when a clot plugs an artery that feeds blood to part
of the heart muscle.
   But some patients who get TPA therapy develop another clot after
the treatment stops, putting them at risk for another heart attack.
If TPA can be made to remain active longer, it may reduce the
tendency toward forming clots after therapy stops, Sambrook said.
   Sambrook, a biochemist at the University of Texas Southwestern
Medical Center in Dallas, reports on one TPA variant in today's
issue of the British journal Nature with colleagues from the medical
center and the Howard Hughes Medical Institute there.
   In test tube experiments, the variant remained largely potent
when exposed to substances in blood that de-activate the current
form of the drug.
   Such de-activation is one reason the current version of TPA acts
only briefly. Another is the fact that it is removed from the
bloodstream by the liver, Sambrook said.
   Because of this, animal studies will be needed to assess
persistence of altered versions of TPA, said Edgar Haber, president
of the Squibb Institute for Medical Research in Princeton, N.J.
   Some researchers have altered TPA to hamper removal by the liver,
and perhaps that approach can be combined with that of the new study
to create a longer-lasting drug, he and Sambrook said.

   A cleaning-crew worker tried to poison his boss

   Cabassa was charged with reckless endangerment on a government

<HEAD>Grand Jury Called for Rocky Flats Investigation; Safety Agreement
Signed</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A federal judge has ordered a special grand jury
impaneled to investigate alleged environmental violations at Rocky
Flats nuclear weapons plant.
   U.S. Energy Secretary James Watkins, meanwhile, pledged that the
plant will be run safely or not at all. He said, however, that an
agreement signed with Gov. Roy Romer will help ensure that it is run
properly.
   ``There's a whole new ball game at Rocky Flats,'' Watkins said
Wednesday during a visit to New Mexico. ``We have put in a new team
of line managers, working with a new site manager.''
   The agreement, signed during a meeting at the Waste Isolation
Pilot Plant near Carlsbad, N.M., will allow Colorado to monitor
Rocky Flats more closely, Romer said.
   In Denver, U.S. District Court Judge Sherman Finesilver said a
23-member special grand jury was needed because of the possibility
of a long and complicated investigation. It will be the first time
in 27 years that a special grand jury was called in the federal
district of Colorado, said court clerk Jim Manspeaker.
   ``The special grand jury will have to utilize its complete
energies in pursuance of this directive,'' Finesilver said. Colorado
has two regular grand juries.
   On Jun 6, FBI and Environmental Protection Agency investigators
raided the plant, 15 miles northwest of Denver, looking for evidence
of criminal environmental violations, including illegal disposal of
hazardous wastes. The Department of Energy plant is operated by
Rockwell International and uses plutonium to make triggers for
nuclear bombs.
   The FBI affidavit that led to the search warrant alleged that
plant workers illegally burned and dumped hazardous wastes and that
the plant illegally discharged pollutants into two creeks that flow
into water supplies serving four suburbs.
   Agents completed the search of Rocky Flats last week and are now
checking truckloads of documents.
   Acting U.S. Attorney Mike Norton said unlike a regular grand
jury, the special grand jury will have the power to issue public
reports on its investigation, even if no criminal activity is found.
   Finesilver issued the order Wednesday at the request of the
prosecutors. The 23 jurors are to be chosen and ready for duty Aug.
1.
   Romer hailed the decision.
   ``I welcome anything that helps get the complete facts on the
table. We need to remove the mystery about Rocky Flats and I think a
grand jury will help accomplish that. I want all of the truth to
come out,'' Romer said.
   The agreement signed by Watkins and Romer was worked out two
weeks ago after the Justice Department announced its Rocky Flats
investigation. Watkins said the purpose of the agreement was to
ensure the plant was run safely.
   ``If either of us is not convinced of that, then we'll both shut
it down,'' he said.
   The Waste Isolation Pilot Plant near Carlsbad also was a focus of
the meeting. The plant, proposed as the nation's first permanent
nuclear waste repository, originally was scheduled to open last
October.
   That date was revised to September 1989, but Watkins said this
week it won't open until the federal government shows it can safely
transport and bury nuclear waste.
   ``We will open WIPP, but we will open it when it's ready,''
Watkins said at a news conference following a meeting with the
governors of New Mexico, Idaho and Colorado.
   The governors said they were pleased with Watkins' take-charge
attitude toward the growing nuclear waste problem, but they were
unwilling to budge on their stance toward the problem.
   New Mexico Gov. Garrey Carruthers said his state won't accept any
nuclear waste until DOE meets all commitments to the state; Gov.
Cecil Andrus said Idaho won't accept any more waste after August;
and Romer said he will shut down the Rocky Flats if its storage
capacity is met.

   Nancy Harrison says she didn't know until
her husband disappeared last week that he had a hidden past as a
convicted murderer who escaped from an Alabama prison six years ago.
   Mrs. Harrison said the man she knew as Lee Wesley Harrison had
become a good stepfather to her three daughters, and the couple has
a 2-year-old daughter and another child on the way.
   ``This is just unreal,'' Mrs. Harrison said. ``He was just a
great husband and a great father. Even tempered. When we had our
little spats _ which wasn't very often _ he'd just walk away.''
   Her husband, whose real name is Larry Owen Weeks, disappeared for
a week after learning he was under investigation but surrendered
Tuesday to authorities at the Eau Claire County Airport.
   ``When he arrived at the airport he was rather emotional. He was
very scared,'' police Capt. Steve Hahn said. ``He indicated that he
did not want to hurt anybody and he did not want to be hurt himself,
so he felt the best thing to do at that point was to surrender.''
   Officials with the Alabama Department of Corrections said
Wednesday that if Weeks refused to sign a waiver, the state would
start extradition proceedings.
   Weeks appeared Wednesday in Eau Claire County Circuit Court and
was ordered held without bond. He was charged with driving a vehicle
without the owner's consent for allegedly taking his
brother-in-law's vehicle without permission when he fled.
   Authorities said Weeks worked for a contractor and stayed out of
trouble since his 1983 arrival in Eau Claire, 200 miles northwest of
Milwaukee.
   He had been serving a life sentence without parole for the 1981
murder of a 49-year-old man in Alabama. According to reports, Weeks
and a female accomplice kidnapped the man, drove him to a desolate
area and shot him in the head.
   Alabama authorities said Weeks was 21 at the time, although
police in Eau Claire said Weeks told them he was 17 when the crime
occurred.
   Weeks escaped from prison in April 1983 and came to Eau Claire
because he had relatives in the area, police said.
   Mrs. Harrison, 35, said she did not learn of her husband's past
until last week. She said when she asked about his past, he would
tell her he was sexually abused as a child and did not want to talk
about it.
   ``The children can't believe it, and they say there isn't
anything they wouldn't do for him,'' she said.

<HEAD>Advocacy Group Gives California Low Grade for Children</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   California gets an overall `D' grade for its
efforts to keep children healthy, in school and out of jail,
according to a report card from an advocacy group.
   ``I'm anything but proud of the results that have been achieved
in California for children,'' said Wendy Lazarus of Children Now,
which released the report Wednesday. ``We cannot tolerate a
situation in which we are losing so much in human lives.''
   The non-profit, non-partisan group founded last year based its
``Children's Report Card'' on 27 factors, such as test scores and
the number of children in foster homes and jails.
   The report was strongly criticized by Gov. George Deukmejian.
   ``California ... spends more on poor children than any other
state,'' he said. ``If that deserves a D, the report card deserves
an F.''
   But state schools chief William Honig agreed with the report's
conclusion.
   ``There is a major problem on comprehensive children's
programs,'' he said. ``There's been an explosive growth in poverty
... and we're all going to pay the price.''
   Statistics gathered by Children Now showed that compared to other
states, California ranked worse than the national average in many
areas, ranging from the student-teacher ratio in classes to the
number of youth homicides.
   The statistics indicated that the number of children living in
poverty _ 1.6 million _ rose 47 percent between 1981 and 1987 and
that child abuse reports jumped 135 percent between 1980 and 1988.
   The report also found that the percentage of juveniles locked up
in California is twice as high as in the nation overall and the
state's teen-age pregnancy rate is the second highest in the country.
   But the state fared better than most in a few areas, including
infant mortality rates, Scholastic Aptitude Test scores for
college-bound students and public assistance payments.
   The grades were compiled by a panel of five, based on statistics
from various state and federal agencies.
   The panel included California Supreme Court Justice Allen
Broussard; Stanford University President Donald Kennedy; former U.S.
Secretary of Education Shirley Hufstedler; teacher Jaime Escalante
whose life was depicted in the film ``Stand and Deliver''; and
former baseball commissioner Peter Ueberroth.

   An imprisoned bigamist who made the ``Guinness
Book of World Records'' for having more than 100 wives is seeking
his freedom on the grounds he received bad legal advice.
   But a magistrate has delayed making a decision on the case.
   Donald E. Wilkes, Jr., a University of Georgia law professor, on
Wednesday told U.S. Magistrate Morton Sitver that Giovanni Vigliotto
was influenced by questionable counsel when he withdrew his appeal
of his 1983 conviction.
   Vigliotto, now a 60-year-old diabetic and a stroke victim who
needs a wheelchair, is serving a 34-year prison term for bigamy and
fraud. He once acknowledged having married 105 women without
divorcing them, becoming the subject of the news, talk shows and
made-for-TV movies.
   State Assistant Attorney General Joe Maziarz asked Sitver to
dismiss the petition with prejudice _ meaning it could not be
refiled _ because Vigliotto had withdrawn his appeal and failed to
appeal systematically through the state courts.
   Maziarz said the state courts have ``bent over backwards'' for
the bigamist and even have appointed an attorney to discuss with
Vigliotto his decision to withdraw his appeal.
   Instead, Vigliotto refused to talk to the attorney, calling him
``a lackey of the court and a friend of the judges,'' Maziarz told
Sitver.
   Sitver gave Vigliotto's counsel 20 days to submit a revised writ
for habeas corpus to conform with Arizona requirements and said he
would issue his decision once that was done.
   Private investigator Patricia O'Connor, who is coordinating an
effort to free the former flea-market trader who has been declared
indigent by Maricopa Superior Court, said several other lawyers have
been hired to represent Vigliotto.
   ``I thought I was going to be here by myself,'' Wilkes said
before leaving to catch a plane. He was flanked by several others in
the courtroom during a posthearing press conference.
   ``The Vigliotto case is Arizona's `Mississippi Burning' in my
view,'' said Ralph Temple, a former director of the American Civil
Liberties Union in Washington.
   Temple said he and the others were aiding Vigliotto because he
was denied a fair trial and was dealt an irrationally severe
sentence.
   Maziarz said later that Vigliotto's sentencing was more severe
because of prior convictions.
   Vigliotto's petition was filed in federal court because the state
has frustrated his attempts for due process in denying him access to
legal materials needed for a trial, Temple said.
   Asked whether Arizona's courts were capable of giving Vigliotto a
fair trail, attorney Edwin Sigel said, ``They haven't done it in the
past.''
   Vigliotto's legal team claims 277 instances of judicial and
prosecutorial misconduct and ineffective counsel.

   About 1,200 members of the nation's largest anti-abortion lobby
were beginning their meeting today as the U.S. Supreme Court was
expected to release its decision on a Missouri law restricting
abortion availability and defining life as starting at conception.
   On Wednesday, Mayor Don Fraser of nearby Minneapolis urged
conventioneers to remain within the law in any demonstrations.
   Several pro-choice pickets walked outside the Radisson South
Hotel later in the day as delegates arrived.
   ``If they break the law we'll ask the police to intervene. But
we'd like to avoid that,'' Fraser told reporters as about 30
anti-abortion protesters held up posters of fetuses and fetal parts.
   Representatives of abortion clinics in the Twin Cities area had
asked the mayors of Minneapolis, St. Paul and Bloomington to issue
pleas against civil disobedience while conventioneers are in
Minnesota. Mayors George Latimer of St. Paul and Kurt Laughinghouse
of Bloomington issued no statements.
   ``With the convention coming into town, I think it's appropriate
that we call upon our mayors to set a tone,'' said Jeri Rasmussen,
executive director of Midwest Health Center for Women, one of six
Twin Cities clinics that perform abortions.
   Rasmussen said at a news conference she was especially concerned
following a demonstration at her downtown Minneapolis clinic Friday.
Police arrested 153 abortion opponents who blocked the clinic
entrance and packed the hallway outside the clinic.
   ``Clearly there are differing views on the abortion issue in the
United States and in this community,'' Fraser said. ``Active,
vigorous debate and dissent is a part of our American freedoms.
   ``Our concern is that protest and dissent be peaceful and
especially that those dissenting not inflict harm on others.''
   Rasmussen said the last three conferences of the National Right
to Life Committee, which claims 2,500 local affiliates in 50 states,
have coincided with attacks on clinics.
   ``What we're anticipating is conducting our clinic as usual, but
we're prepared for any eventuality,'' Rasmussen said.
   Jackie Schweitz, executive director of Minnesota Citizens
Concerned for Life, the convention's host group, said neither her
organization nor the National Right to Life Committee is involved in
civil disobedience.
   ``I don't know of any demonstrations planned. The business of
this convention is education,'' Schweitz said, as delegates look at
ways to provide alternatives to abortion, infanticide and euthanasia.

<HEAD>Wildlife Group Cautions Anglers on Cancer Risks</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The National Wildlife Federation today said
people who eat Lake Michigan sport fish face a greater risk of
cancer than previously believed due to toxic contamination.
   Wisconsin health officials and toxic-pollution experts, however,
criticized the nation's largest conservation organization's
estimates of cancer risk as too high and likely to confuse fish
eaters.
   The federation calculated that over a lifetime a person who eats
as few as 11 meals of Lake Michigan lake trout longer than 30 inches
faces a one in 10,000 risk of cancer. The figures were based on
levels of four toxic chemicals the fish are likely to contain.
   The wildlife federation recommended that pregnant women, women
who intend to have children, nursing mothers and children age 15 or
younger not eat any lake trout, brown trout, chinook salmon, coho
salmon, walleye or yellow perch from the lake.
   In a 17-page booklet, produced after two years of research, the
federation also urges fishermen to pressure public officials to
control toxic-chemical pollution in the lake.
   ``The problem is the pollution sources, and the solution is to
insist that industry and government clean them up,'' federation
president Jay D. Hair said.
   Wisconsin officials said the group's recommendations may confuse
fishermen and their families because it conflicts with a Lake
Michigan fish advisory jointly issued by Wisconsin, Michigan,
Illinois and Indiana.
   The joint health advisory does not advise women and children
against eating lake trout less than 20 inches long, coho less than
26 inches long, chinook less than 21 inches long or brook trout or
perch.
   The longer and older a fish, the more likely it is have in its
tissues toxic chemicals like PCBs and the pesticides DDT, dieldrin
and chordane.
   ``All it's going to do is confuse the public on an issue that's
already complex,'' Lee Liebenstein, toxic substances specialist in
Wisconsin's Department of Natural Resources, said of the report.
``We've got experts arguing among themselves in the media, and
that's a no-win situation.''
   ``What they've done is not an accurate estimation of the true
risk,'' said Dr. Henry Anderson, chief of environmental epidemiology
for the Wisconsin Division of Health. ``It's a very conservative
assessment.''
   Dean Heili of Manitowoc, legislative chairman of the Wisconsin
Federation of Great Lakes Sport Fishing Clubs, said his group is
sticking with the advice issued by the four states.
   ``Public health and water quality standards are too important to
be used as political footballs,'' he said.
   Lake Michigan fishing is a $4.8 billion a year business, Heili
said, and employs 36,000 people in Wisconsin alone.
   Mark Van Putten, director of the wildlife federation's Great
Lakes Natural Resource Center in Ann Arbor, Mich., said his group
shares the concern that conflicting advice could cause confusion.
   But, according to the wildlife federation, the four states'
advice is based on outdated U.S. Food and Drug Administration
numbers. Lake Michigan anglers also eat more fish than the average
American, a figure used by the FDA to base its calculations, Van
Putten said.
   ``What we're talking about is giving the people the best
information that's available,'' he said. ``We are a conservation and
education organization, and this is consistent with our mission.''
   But Wisconsin's Liebenstein defended the states' advisory. ``We
believe what we have is very good at protecting the public health,''
he said.

   A man accused of killing his wife and then
commandeering an airplane and firing an assault rifle onto Boston
streets from the air was judged incompetent to stand trial for
murder.
   Brockton District Court Judge Charles E. Black made the ruling
Wednesday after reviewing a psychiatrist's evaluation, said Stephen
O'Connell, spokesman for the Essex County district attorney's office.
   Alfred Hunter, 42, was committed to Bridgewater State Hospital
for up to six months. Another competency hearing may be scheduled at
that time.
   Hunter was accused of shooting his ex-wife, Elvira, eight times
with the assault rifle in front of their 5-year-old son on May 10.
   Authorities say he then took a small plane at gunpoint and buzzed
several Boston neighborhoods and Logan International Airport,
forcing officials to flee the control tower twice.
   Hunter later surrendered. He pleaded innocent to charges of
murder and armed robbery.

<HEAD>Shareholders OK Settlement to Dismantle Shoreham Nuclear Power Plant</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PAT MILTON</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WESTBURY, N.Y. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Long Island Lighting Co. shareholders have
overwhelmingly approved a deal that could make Shoreham the first
licensed nuclear power plant in the nation to be abandoned before
coming on line.
   The agreement approved Wednesday by 95 percent of the
shareholders calls for the utility to sell Shoreham for $1 to the
Long Island Power Authority, a state agency.
   In exchange, a tentative rate hike schedule was established under
which the company gets 11 increases over 10 years of about 5 percent
each. The state Public Service Commission must approve each increase.
   The federal Nuclear Regulatory Commission still must give
permission to the company to sell the plant and to Long Island Power
Authority to dismantle it.
   Deputy Secretary of Energy W. Henson Moore said the shareholders'
vote ``is not a fatal blow to the Shoreham nuclear power plant, nor
is it a fatal blow to the energy future for the people of Long
Island.''
   Moore vowed to ``preserve the option of using Shoreham in the
future'' by trying to thwart the transfer of the plant to the state
agency.
   Long Island Lighting Chairman William Catacosinos told
shareholders he doubts the Energy Department can legally block the
sale or keep the plant from being dismantled.
   Gov. Mario Cuomo called the federal government's ``sudden
interest regarding Shoreham ... all the more troubling in view of
the unfolding scandal surrounding its own nuclear facilities and the
threats they pose to public safety and national security.''
   Energy officials say nuclear power is essential to reducing the
country's need for imported oil. Long Island Lighting is almost
entirely dependent on foreign oil.
   In April, the NRC granted a license to Shoreham to operate at
full power. Previously the plant was licensed to operate at 5
percent. Shoreham was completed in 1985, 10 years behind schedule,
at a cost of $5.5 billion. It was supposed to cost $261 million.
Other plants have been abandoned before completion.
   The campaign to close Shoreham centered on contentions by state
and local officials that Long Island could never be safely evacuated
in the event of a nuclear accident.
   Most of the 20 shareholders who spoke at the company's annual
meeting denounced the plant's demise, but Catacosinos called for an
end to the uncertainty surrounding Shoreham, which nearly bankrupted
the utility in 1984.
   The shareholders also approved settlement of a class-action
lawsuit under the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act
in which Suffolk County charged that Long Island Lighting had lied
about costs and the progress of Shoreham to get rate hikes.
   A federal jury convicted the utility, but a judge threw out the
case. A lawyer for the ratepayers settled the case for $390 million,
to be refunded to ratepayers in monthly bills over 10 years.
   Meantime, the NRC has begun its investigation of improper control
room procedures at the nuclear power plant in Seabrook, N.H., during
last week's abrupt shutdown of low-power testing.
   The $6 billion reactor was shut down after a valve in the
non-nuclear part of the plant malfunctioned. NRC observers said they
suggested several times that the plant be shut down before Seabrook
operators responded.
   Seabrook officials have acknowledged it took about five minutes
for operators to react, and that they did not follow proper
procedures.

<TEXT>
   Thunderstorms blew through the Plains with 60 mph winds, damaging
hail and heavy rain, and the remnants of Tropical Storm Allison
continued to swamp Louisiana.
   Storms developed Wednesday evening from the Dakotas to the Texas
Panhandle, with some of the most severe storms in Kansas.
   In the town of Goodland, winds gusted to 68 mph, two-inch hail
smashed windows and car windshields and more than 4 inches of rain
flooded streets and basements. In western Kansas, 8{ inches of rain
covered fields and damaged crops along the Sherman-Thomas county
line.
   Winds gusting to 63 mph downed trees at Mobridge, S.D., and ping
pong ball-size hail fell at Bismarck, N.D.
   Storms also were strong over eastern portions of Colorado and New
Mexico. Winds gusted to 60 mph at Cheyenne Wells, Colo., and
combined with heavy rain to reduce visibilities to near zero.
   Allison continued to make its presence felt along the Gulf Coast.
Eleven inches of rain fell in just over 4 hours at Winnfield, La.,
closing all roads leading to the town. Nearly 2 inches of rain fell
in 2 hours at Lake Charles.
   Many streams and bayous were swollen or out of their banks across
southeast Texas and southern Louisiana, causing street flooding.
   Showers and thunderstorms also were scattered from the middle and
southern Atlantic Coast states into Florida. A thunderstorm dumped 2
to 3 inches of rain in a two-hour period near Fort Valley, Ga.
   A cold front brought showers to the central and northern Pacific
Coast.
   Today's forecast called for showers and thunderstorms from
eastern Texas across the Gulf Coast and the Tennessee Valley to
Florida and the southern Atlantic Coast. Scattered showers and
thunderstorms also were predicted for the upper Mississippi Valley
and eastern Montana. Rain was expected along the northern Pacific
Coast and across the Pacific Northwest.
   Highs were expected to be in the 60s and 70s from the eastern
half of the upper Mississippi Valley across the Great Lakes and much
of the Ohio Valley into New England, and in the Pacific Northwest
and along the California coast; the 90s from the northern Plains
across the central and southern Rockies, much of Arizona and New
Mexico and south-central and southwest Texas, as well as from the
South Carolina coast into Florida; above 100 degrees from the Rio
Grande Valley of Texas to the Desert Southwest; and in the 80s
elsewhere.
   Temperatures at 3 a.m. EDT ranged from 35 degrees at Marquette,
Mich., to 92 degrees at Blythe, Calif.

probed the sewer.
   ``It wasn't in any of the stuff that came out,'' Weir said.
   Crew chief Manuel Terra told her it might take a few months for
the ring to be washed from the house plumbing into the 8-inch line

   On Wednesday, three months later, she called Terra, who came out
again.
   The crew sent a water-powered cleaning ball through the line from
one manhole to the next.
   ``I was losing hope,'' Weir said.
   All of a sudden, Weir said, ``the guy in the manhole was yelling

   A passenger train was rocked by
a bomb blast this morning but no one was injured, police said.
   The device exploded at 7:25 a.m. on the tracks as a Northern
Ireland Railways train was operating a few miles west of Coleraine
on the line to Londonderry, according to the Royal Ulster
Constabulary.
   The driver was badly shaken but not hospitalized, a police
spokesman said. No group immediately claimed responsibility for the
attack.
   The Irish Republican Army has made Northern Ireland Railways the
target of more than 20 bomb attacks since mid-December. All the
bombs were on the Belfast-Dublin line but none caused any injuries
or damaged any trains.
   The IRA had usually given advance warning of bombs on the
Belfast-Dublin line, and police said many of those explosives were
accompanied by booby-trap devices apparently intended to kill
soldiers called to clear the line.
   The IRA, an outlawed, predominantly Roman Catholic paramilitary
group, has fought a 20-year guerrilla war against British rule in
Northern Ireland.

   The tenacity of two detectives finally paid off
when a 27-year-old man was convicted of killing a boy 10 years ago
after he refused to hand over his new 10-speed bicycle.
   Pedro Lozado was convicted Wednesday in the death of 12-year-old
Tireak Ghandy. Lozado faces a mandatory sentence of life in prison
when he's sentenced Aug. 10.
   On July 30, 1979, Tireak took his new $250 bike to Yankee Stadium.
   ``The kid was doing what every kid who ever grew up in the Bronx
did. He rode his bike to Yankee Stadium,'' Detective John Hennessy
said last year after he and Detective Jerry Dunn finally got enough
evidence to arrest Lozado.
   Tireak was leaving the stadium when Lozado demanded the bike.
When the boy resisted, Lozado stabbed him in the heart.
   ``This guy was a lot bigger than him. He could have smacked the
kid in the mouth and taken the bike, that's all he really had to do.
He didn't have to stab him,'' Hennessy said.
   As Tireak fell, the attacker snatched a basketball from his hands
and escaped on his bike. The child was bleeding so badly that police
didn't wait for an ambulance, but drove him to the hospital
themselves. He was dead before they reached the emergency room.
   After getting a lead during questioning of another man, Hennessy
and Dunn spent 18 months tracking down witnesses to the stabbing.
   Hennessy and Dunn arrested Lozado April 20, 1988, after he
visited his parole officer and charged him with murder, robbery and
possession of a deadly weapon.
   Lozado had been released from prison in December 1987 after
serving three years for criminal possession of stolen property.
   ``He couldn't believe that after all these years, it had caught
up with him,'' Dunn said at the time. ``I guess he figured he'd beat
it.''

   Two leading Chinese dissidents who escaped to
the West plan to form a new organization and move their
pro-democracy campaign to a base outside China, a Hong Kong activist
said today.
   Student leader Wu'er Kaixi and intellectual Yan Jiaqi are
expected to release a joint statement next week calling on Chinese
people in and out of China to ``continue the struggle for
democracy,'' said the activist, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
   The pair were smuggled out of China by a Hong Kong-based
``underground railroad.'' Both are reportedly in hiding in a Western
country.
   In statements written after they fled China, both men called for
the overthrow of the current leadership in China.
   Wu'er, in an 18-minute videotaped message, called China's leaders
``wild beasts'' and predicted their government would fall.
   ``Those of us who remain alive, our lives are no longer our
own,'' he said on the tape. ``The lives of those classmates and
countrymen who died for democracy, for freedom and for our beautiful
motherland have melted into ours.''
   In a letter written after his escape, Yan said, ``China's
political situation is in the midst of a white terror.''
   He said the Chinese leadership's ``inhuman policies have not only
intensified the people's desire for revenge and planted the seeds of
democracy and freedom in the hearts of more and more people, they
also hastened their demise.''
   Wu'er, a freshman at Beijing Normal University, was one of the
top leaders of the student movement for democratic reform. He also
was one of 21 students sought by China's government for his role in
what the authorities called ``a counterrevolutionary rebellion.''
   Yan was one of the founding members of an independent union of
Beijing intellectuals who participated actively in the protests. His
name was placed on an another government wanted-list of
intellectuals.
   Chinese troops crushed the pro-democracy movement on June 3-4
when they opened fire on unarmed crowds in central Beijing, killing
hundreds of people.
   The activist said details of the new organization had yet to be
worked out. There are currently a number of organizations in the
United States, Canada, France and Great Britain devoted to
establishing democracy in China.
   But several of them, including the New York-based Chinese
Alliance for Democracy, have been convulsed by internal strife
caused by both personal and ideological clashes.
   Some organizations are supported by Taiwan's Nationalist
government, while others claim to be independent.
   If these groups can solve their problems, Western experts on
China say, they could play an important role in transforming China.
A leading Chinese dissident, Liu Binyan, recently urged overseas
Chinese to send weapons, pro-democracy pamphlets and money to
underground groups on the mainland.
   Overseas Chinese organizations and money played an important role
in the overthrow of the Qing Dynasty in 1911 by Sun Yat-sen.
   Sun relied on Chinese money in Hawaii, New York, San Francisco
and Hong Kong to fuel his rebellion against the decadent Qing.
   Chinese students abroad also played an important role in the
Chinese Communist revolution. Late Premier Zhou En-lai and senior
leader Deng Xiaoping both lived in France and received political
education there. Other Communists were schooled in Moscow.
   Today, Chinese has tens of thousands of students in the West,
including about 30,000 in the United States.

<TEXT>
   A special court convicted three leaders of
the left-wing terrorist group Direct Action today and sentenced them
to life in prison on charges including the murder of a civilian
guard and two policemen.
   The seven-judge court also convicted 14 other defendents and gave
them prison sentences ranging from 10 months to seven years.
   The verdict on charges running to 340 pages, arising from three
murders, three armed assaults, and 32 armed robberies committed
between 1980 and 1986 was handed down after seven hours of
deliberation.
   The Lyon-based group's ideological leader Andre Olivier, 46, and
his hand-picked deputy Maxime Frerot, 33, the group's explosives
expert, must serve at least 18 years of their sentences.
   Emile Ballandras, 40, must serve at least 16 years of his life
sentence, the court ruled.
   Olivier, his companion Joelle Crepet, 32, Frerot and Bernard
Blanc, 29, were convicted of three murders committed during a
hold-up. Killed were Henri Delrieu, an employee of an armored
vehicle company, and two police officers, Guy Hubert and Guy
Delfosse.
   Blanc was given an extra five-year sentence on top of the 15
years the prosecution had demanded, while Crepet received 18 years
in prison.
   The trial began May 16 amid tight security with hundreds of
police stationed around the courthouse.
   After the verdict was announced Andre Olivier broke into the
Internationale, the international anthem of socialism. He was joined
by Blanc and Frerot before they were led away in handcuffs.
   Direct Action first made headlines in 1979 with a series of
bombings and assasinations against Interpol, labor and immigration
offices and corporate headquarters.
   The attacks which formed the basis for the Lyon trial were
principally staged to finance the group's activities, prosecutors
said.
   Most of the defendents in Lyon will face another trial in Paris
on charges related to 27 other terrorist attacks. It has not yet
been scheduled.

<TEXT>
   Thousands of radical students battled
riot police with firebombs, rocks and clubs today to demand they be
allowed to attend a youth festival in communist North Korea. At
least 13 people, including a policeman, were reported injured.
   About 1,500 students attacked 3,000 police at Seoul's Hanyang
University after authorities locked the school gates and refused for
the third day to allow anyone inside for protest rallies.
   Waves of students climbed over school walls, throwing rocks and
firebombs and trying to break through police lines so about 1,000
colleagues several blocks away could get inside the campus.
   As the fighting continued, students from other colleges who had
assembled outside the campus raced through the streets and crawled
over broken walls to gain entrance.
   ``Drive out Yankees who block national unification!'' and
``Overthrow Roh Tae-woo!'' the protesters yelled. Radical students
are demanding the withdrawal of 43,000 U.S. troops stationed in
South Korea and the ouster of President Roh Tae-woo.
   Police threw back rocks and tear gas grenades, injuring at least
a dozen students. One policeman was seriously injured when tear gas
exploded inside the armored van he was driving, authorities said.
   The students were protesting a government ban on attending the
July 1-8 World Youth Festival in North Korea's capital, Pyongyang.
``Let's march to Pyongyang!'' they shouted.
   In downtown Seoul, hundreds of students throwing firebombs and
rocks fought riot police, forcing shoppers to race for shelter.
Traffic came to a halt and tear gas wafted through the air.
   Yonhap, the South Korean news agency, said the downtown fighting
started when about 700 students from three schools marched to the
city center.
   The Seoul government has accused North Korea of using the
festival to stir up dissent in South Korea.
   North Korea invited South Korean students to attend the youth
festival, an athletic and cultural festival mainly featuring
non-aligned and communist nations.
   The two Koreas have been bitter rivals since the peninsula was
divided into the communist North and the capitalist South at the end
of World War II. The North invaded the South to begin the 1950-53
Korean War.

<TEXT>
   A Soviet MiG-29 jet fighter that crashed in flames
at the Paris Air Show went down because a small bird was sucked into
its engine, a commission has concluded.
   Specialists found feathers sticking to the wrecked engine's
blades, the newspaper Socialist Industry said today, quoting the
head of the French-Soviet panel's Soviet contingent, Donat
Ogorodnikov.
   The commission's findings absolved the organizers of the June air
show of all blame, the newspaper said.
   Some reports had said another plane taxiing near the low-flying
MiG-29 might have kicked up a stone from the runway that flew into
the MiG's engine.
   ``That assumption threw a shadow on the organizers of the show,
who were justifiably humiliated,'' newspaper said.
   The fighter crashed June 8 as it was making its final pass over
the Le Bourget airfield north of Paris. Its pilot, Anatoly Kvochur,
survived after ejecting from the low-flying jet and plummeting to
the ground with his parachute only partly opened.
   Days later, he and a Soviet aviation designer speculated that a
bird caused the crash.
   The MiG-29, a twin-engine combat aircraft, has been in operation
since 1985.

   Organizers of a dance festival said two
Chinese couples scheduled to participate had been arrested in
connection with pro-democracy protests in China, but the Chinese
Embassy today denied it.
   Organizers of the weeklong Rencontres Internationales de la
Danse, which opens Sunday, said in a statement Wednesday that the
cultural attache at the Chinese Embassy in Paris told them the
couples were under arrest.
   The attache, Pou Tong, said today he made no such statement.
   ``They were never arrested. They have no political problems,''
Pou Tong said. He refused to explain why the four ballet dancers
canceled their scheduled participation in the festival in the
coastal resort of La Baule.
   The couples are Yang Xing Hua and Xin Li Li, winners of the
Shanghai Ballet grand prix, and Wu Wei and Qu Zijiao, gold medalists
in a 1988 competition at Liaoning.

   A bomb exploded today outside a shoe
store where shoes considered offensive to Islam are sold, and two
people were wounded, police said.
   No one claimed responsibility for the blast, which ripped open
the steel doors of the closed shop in the resort town of Cox's
Bazar, said a police official in Dhaka, speaking on condition of
anonymity.
   Cox's Bazar, on the Bay of Bengal, is 185 miles south of Dhaka.
   The targeted shoe store is owned by the Canadian-based Bata
company. Bata closed its shops in Bangladesh last week, fearing
violence by Moslem fundamentalists who say the design on one of its
slippers is offensive.
   The Moslems contend the design, which the company says is three
interwined bells, resembles the Arabic characters for Allah.
   One person was killed and 50 were wounded Sunday when police
opened fire on a mob that tried to raid a Bata store near Dhaka.
   About 90 percent of Bangladesh's 110 million people are Moslem.
   The country was the scene of violent protests earlier this year
by Moslems who considered Salman Rushdie's book, ``The Satanic
Verses,'' offensive to Islam.

<TEXT>
   Egypt and Lebanon today announced the
resumption of diplomatic ties, severed 10 years ago after Egypt
signed a peace treaty with Israel.
   The resumption of diplomatic relations left Syria and Libya as
the only Arab states that have not restored links with Egypt after a
1987 Arab League summit in Amman, Jordan, gave the go-ahead for
members to do so.
   Cairo's relations with both Syria and Libya improved considerably
after last month's Arab summit in Casablanca, Morocco, which saw
Egypt's return to its League seat after a 10-year suspension.
   President Hosni Mubarak had separate reconciliation meetings with
Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi and President Hafez Assad of Syria on
the sidelines of the Casablanca summit.
   The Libyan-Egyptian border, closed since 1977, has since been
re-opened and air traffic between the two countries resumed.
Egyptian officials expect diplomatic ties with Libya and Syria to be
restored in the near future.
   A joint statement issued simultaneously in Cairo and Beirut said:
``Egypt and Lebanon have decided to resume full diplomatic relations
starting today, Thursday.''
   Lebanon was among 17 Arab countries that severed diplomatic ties
with Egypt in 1979 to protest its treaty with Israel. Egypt's
membership in the Arab League also was frozen.
   At the Casablanca summit, Egypt joined Kuwait and Jordan in
drafting a proposal to end the 14-year civil war in Lebanon. A final
seven-point plan on Lebanon, stressing the country's unity and
territorial integrity, was based on that proposal.
   Today's statement did not mention Lebanon's divided government.
But Egyptian officials said both the Moslem Cabinet of acting Prime
Minister Salim Hoss and the rival Christian Cabinet of Army Gen.
Michel Aoun approved the move.

   Firefighters today worked to protect lakeside
homes from the fiercer of two fickle fires that have blackened
10,000 acres of Southern California brush, forced thousands to flee
and destroyed nine structures.
   ``The fire made a pretty good run toward the homes and actually
came into the structure area, but no buildings were lost,'' Capt.
Will Donaldson of the California Department of Forestry said early
today.
   More than 200 families living on the Lake Elsinore shore and in
the mountains nearby were evacuated because of the 6,500-acre fire
that started Tuesday in the Cleveland National Forest, 60 miles
southeast of Los Angeles.
   The fire destroyed six structures and forced the evacuation of a
youth correctional facility, a nudist colony and many homes and
cabins. It threatened an undisclosed number of homes on the lake and
in the mountains.
   Three firefighters suffered back injuries. More than 750 battled
the blaze, which jumped two fire lines.
   ``I'm nervous, I'm shaking,'' said Cynthia Hayes, who was
evacuated to a high school with her two children. ``I understand I'm
in brush country, but this makes me think twice. You think it's
never going to happen to you.''
   About 300 firefighters in the Antelope Valley 45 miles north of
Los Angeles battled a 3,700-acre blaze that destroyed a ranch house
and its two barns and forced 2,500 residents to flee. The fire began
Wednesday.
   Nearly all the evacuees were back home by early today, said
firefighter Al Smith.
   ``The fire is laying down at this time, but we do expect it to
stand up and take off when the sun rises,'' he said. ``Where it goes
during the day is anyone's guess.''
   ``There was smoke everywhere,'' said Chuck Lamb, who fled from
his Antelope Valley home. ``The flames must have jumped a couple of
hundred yards, and then of course everything got very very dark,
very very smoky, and there was a brief time when I didn't know
whether I lost my house or not.''
   He later discovered his home was safe but said that when he fled,
``I grabbed all sorts of bizarre stuff. I just cleaned out stuff out
of my wife's closet. I don't even know to this minute what I've got
in the suitcase in the back of my car.''

<HEAD>Court Refuses to Hear Conspiracy Theory In Palme Murder</HEAD>

<DATELINE>STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Swedish court refused today to hear
testimony that an international conspiracy may have been behind the
1986 slaying of Prime Minister Olof Palme.
   Stockholm District Court ruled that allegations Kurdish
separatists plotted the assassination are irrelevant to the trial of
Christer Pettersson, who denies killing Palme.
   Palme, who dominated Swedish politics for more than a decade, was
gunned down while walking home from a movie with his wife, Lisbeth.
   Judge Carl Anton Spak rejected a defense request to call former
intelligence agent Jan Henrik Barrling to recount his investigation
of the militant Kurdish Workers Party. The group was the focus of a
yearlong police investigation into the killing. The investigation
was closed for lack of evidence.
   Barrling's testimony ``lacks relevance to the case,'' Spak said.
   The Kurdish group was suspected because the Palme government held
several of its members under house arrest as suspected terrorists
and denied refugee status to one of its leaders.
   The prosecution today called a 34-year-old music teacher to the
stand. He appeared to be the only witness to see the shooting from
beginning to end.
   Inge Morelius said he saw a man standing by a shop window as
Palme and his wife walked past. Morelius said the man, whom he could
not identify, went up behind the couple, put his left hand on
Palme's left shoulder and his right hand in Palme's back.
   Asked if he saw a weapon, Morelius said, ``Its difficult to say
about that, reconstructing it afterward. But I saw clearly and
distinctly two flashes. He pulled off two shots at once. It was
bang, bang, maybe one or 1{ seconds between them.
   ``It was slaughter. It was an execution. It was nothing done in
the heat of the moment,'' Morelius said.
   He said he saw Lisbeth Palme look twice at the gunman. Mrs. Palme
identified Pettersson in court last week as the man she saw lean
over her husband when he fell to the ground. She said she did not
see him shoot Palme or see any gun.
   Morelius said the man took a few steps, then circled around and
looked at Mrs. Palme again while she knelt beside her dying husband.
The man then turned, trotted up a side street and was lost in the
darkness, the witness said.
   Earlier witnesses identified Pettersson as the man who appeared
to wait outside the movie theater for the Palmes to emerge, then
followed them down the street.

   Women once used hangers to end unwanted
pregnancies. Now, health officials say a few desperate women are
using cocaine to induce abortions.
   The National Association for Perinatal Addiction Research and
Education has heard of cocaine-induced abortions in every major U.S.
city during the last three years, said Ira Chasnoff, president of
the Chicago-based organization.
   ``It's probably cheaper, faster and more efficient to do it
themselves'' rather than seek an abortion in a clinic, he said in a
telephone interview Wednesday.
   Doctors say cocaine-induced abortions can cause heavy bleeding in
the mother, and children who survive have a higher risk of
retardation and other problems because the drug can cut off the
blood supply to the fetus.
   The group keeps no statistics on cocaine-induced abortions, but
officials in Miami and Detroit say scattered cases of women who used
large doses of cocaine to end pregnancies are showing up in
emergency rooms as miscarriage patients.
   ``If you pin down some of them and ask questions, you will find
some are using it as an abortifacient,'' said Dr. Gene Burkette,
medical director of the obstetrical and gynecology clinic at Jackson
Memorial Hospital in Miami.
   Even though abortion has been legal since 1973, Burkette said
several factors cause women to attempt to induce abortion themselves.
   ``Some might not be able to afford it and some may figure, `Why
waste the money when you can use it to buy cocaine?''' he said.
   ``It shouldn't be surprising I guess that desperate women will
try anything available to them,'' said Raj Wiener, acting director
of the Michigan Department of Public Health.
   At least one patient at a Detroit drug-treatment program for
pregnant women deliberately increased her drug use after discovering
she was pregnant, according to Dr. Rhonda Beale, clinical director
at the Eleanor Hutzel Recovery Center.
   ``One woman talked about at the beginning of the pregnancy she
started taking more and more coke,'' said Beale, a psychiatrist.
   ``She didn't want to deal with the reality of pregnancy, she
wanted to be rid of the pregnancy. She was happy (when she
miscarried) because she didn't want the baby anyway.''
   Other women tire of being pregnant and use the drug to prompt
early labor and ensure a less painful delivery, Burkette said.
   ``The pregnancy is interfering with their lifestyle. The heavy
weight is interfering with something that they want to do. Women
often get a little impatient in the last three months of pregnancy.
Most normal women are willing to wait it out. These women do not
have that sort of resiliency. They want to deliver early and
painlessly,'' he said.
   Between 1 and 2 percent of the 15,000 women who deliver at
Jackson Memorial each year have used cocaine to cause premature
labor and relieve pain, he estimated. Not all of the babies die.
   Chasnoff, an expert on cocaine addiction and pregnancy, said the
drug causes blood vessels to constrict, cutting off blood supply to
the fetus, and stimulates the pregnant uterus to contract.
   ``It's a setup for pregnancy failure,'' he said.
   Dr. Charles Vincent, chief of gynecology at Detroit Receiving
Hospital, has yet to see a case of cocaine-induced abortion. But he
said that will change if restrictions on abortion, such as a new
Michigan law banning state-paid abortions for poor women, multiply.
   ``If they find out that it works, particularly with the
ridiculous state law that bans Medicaid abortions, I think we're
going to find a lot of women trying it. You get a desperate
teen-ager, they will try almost anything,'' he said.

<TEXT>
   A prosecutor said today he has opened a
criminal investigation involving officials of a company that
contracted to deliver to Iran chemicals that could be used to make
poison gas.
   The Rheineisen Chemical Products company of Duesseldorf said
Wednesday that it canceled its contract to deliver the thionyl
chloride from a company in India. Government officials said they
were investigating whether the deal violated export laws.
   Rolf Chanteaux, the chief state prosecutor in Duesseldorf, where
the company is based, said he opened a criminal probe Wednesday
afternoon that will focus on Rheineisen officials.
   Chanteaux told The Associated Press the company is suspected of
violating West German foreign trade laws by allegedly failing to get
a special permit for the deal. He gave no further details.
   West German officials began looking into the case after U.S.
officials tipped off investigators the thionyl chloride shipment
could be used to make mustard gas, authorities said.
   The incident raised questions about how tough West Germany's new
export control efforts are following last year's scandal over German
links to a suspected Libyan chemical weapons plant.
   ``It may be comforting that West German officials are now
investigating,'' ZDF television network said in a newscast late
Wednesday. ``Not so comforting is the thought that we would again be
totally in the dark without the tip from the United States.''
   The Duesseldorf company insisted West German customs officials
initially assured the firm there was nothing wrong with shipping the
257 tons of thionyl chloride to Iran.
   ``A customs employee confirmed on May 22 that there were no
objections to the shipment,'' company attorney Georg Greeven told
reporters Wednesday night.
   Greeven claimed West German customs authorities didn't alert the
company until Wednesday that under new export control laws adopted
April 7, the firm might need a permit for its involvement in the
Iran transaction.
   He said Rheineisen was able ``at the last moment'' Wednesday to
keep the first delivery of the chemicals from being loaded aboard a
ship in India. He did not identify the ship or the port or give
other details.
   Greeven said the chemicals were made by a company in India called
Transpec. He did not give the location of the firm.
   He also did not indicate whether Rheineisen knew the chemical
could be used to make mustard gas.
   Iran used mustard gas in its eight-year war with Iraq, which
ended with a cease-fire in August, and there have been unconfirmed
reports Tehran is trying to add to its chemical weapons stockpile.
   Rheineisen is run by an Iranian family and was contracted to
arrange the shipment by Iran's state-owned industrial organization
Vezarate Defa, Greeven said. He said Iran approached the Duesseldorf
company about arranging delivery of the chemical in January.
   Under an agreement reached June 1, Rheineisen was to receive
$360,000 from Iran, Greeven said. He did not reveal any details on
the India company's involvement in the transaction.
   U.S. authorities tipped the West German government to
Rheineisen's involvement in the deal last week, Bonn officials say.
   American officials also alerted West Germany late last year about
alleged links between German companies and a suspected chemical
weapons plant in Rabta, Libya, about 40 miles outside Tripoli.
   The West German government at first insisted the United States
had no convincing evidence for its allegations, but later launched
its own investigation.
   West German authorities have since arrested the head of the
Imhausen-Chemie company in connection with the Libyan deal.

   Heavy rain from the breakup of Tropical Storm Allison continued
to soak the eastern half of Texas today, causing more Gulf Coast
flooding.
   Forecasters said 2-4 inches of rain may fall by Friday in areas
where rivers and creeks were at capacity because of 10 inches or
more of rain during the past week.
   Streets and underpasses were flooded this morning at Port Arthur
and Orange, on the Gulf Coast near the Louisiana state line. Strong
thunderstorms extended from just off Corpus Christi 100 miles
eastward into the Gulf of Mexico.
   The National Weather Service, in a preliminary assessment of the
storm, said damage in the Houston area alone was in the millions of
dollars.
   The death toll from the storm rose to four on Wednesday with the
recovery of the bodies of two teen-age boys from a culvert in
Beaumont, Texas.
   The bodies of Mark Shaw, 15, and James Dunbar, 16, were found
Wednesday morning by a diving team, police said. A companion told
officers the two youths were playing in a small rubber raft when it
capsized in the swift current.
   Allison came ashore in Texas on Monday, and the slow-moving storm
dumped more than a foot of rain over many parts of Texas and
Louisiana.
   Many families living near the San Jacinto River east of Houston
remained flooded out of their homes today. Side roads, particularly
in the eastern part of the city and Harris County, also remained
flooded.
   The storm caused as much as 20 yards of beach erosion near
Galveston, where sand was blown over Texas Highway 87, officials
said.
   East Texas received more rain today and showers were forecast for
central and south Louisiana, although additional flooding wasn't
expected.
   More than 13 inches of rain was measured in southern Natchitoches
Parish during a 48-hour period that ended Wednesday night.
   Edward Wright, assistant director of emergency management for the
city-parish government in Baton Rouge, said Wednesday at least 100
homes flooded with at least a couple of inches of water.
   Nearly 10 inches of rain fell Wednesday in the Baton Rouge area.
   Plaquemine, La., south of Baton Rouge, was one of the hardest hit
communities with as many as 280 homes flooded. Two trailer parks
were evacuated.
   Power failures were reported in several areas, including the
Baton Rouge campus of Louisiana State University, where classes were
canceled.
   East Baton Rouge Parish sheriff's Capt. Bob Shortess said he
watched Wednesday as the waters rose around his house.
   First, water covered the street in front of his house. Then,
water creeped up into his yard.
   ``Then, it all came to the house at the same time,'' Shortess
said.
   Linda Becnel, who lives in a flooded Baton Rouge neighborhood,
said although the water didn't get into her house, it covered her
yard and street, Lochness Drive.
   ``I keep laughing, but I know it's not funny,'' she said.
   Water also surrounded the ``For Sale'' sign in her yard.
   ``We showed it yesterday,'' she said. ``We haven't got a purchase
agreement yet, but they seemed interested. I hope they're still
interested. I've lived here seven years, and it never flooded before
today.''
   Allison was the first named storm of the 1989 Atlantic hurricane
season when its sustained winds reached 39 mph. The weather service
said winds gusted to 56 mph Monday at Galveston.
   Elsewhere on Wednesday, lightning strikes across Florida killed
one person and critically injured two others, officials said.
   Greg Lastovica, 32, of Lantana, died Wednesday and Vincent
Kowalski, 20, of Lake Worth, remained in critical condition today at
Boca Raton Community Hospital after they were struck while working
under the roof of an unfinished home.
   In Tampa, Chelvasing Sundramoorthy, a 24-year-old electrical
engineering student at the University of South Florida, was struck
by lightning as he rode his bicycle home from class in a
thunderstorm Wednesday afternoon. He was in critical condition today
at University Community Hospital, a nursing supervisor said.
   And in Mississippi, a tornado in the Centreville area injured
five people and damaged homes Wednesday morning. Two people were in
stable condition at Field Memorial Hospital in Centreville, while
the three others were treated and released, officials said.

   Demonstrating their opposition to flag-burning,
a form of protest the Supreme Court declared legal last week, House
members held an all-night session of speechmaking that ended just
before 9 a.m. today.
   Meanwhile, the House has drafted a constitutional amendment to
forbid flag-burning and President Bush hopes to work with Republican
leaders in Congress to have a final version done as early as Friday.
   House Republican Leader Robert Michel of Illinois, who launched
the all-night session, drafted his own version of what a
constitutional amendment could look like. His would simply give
Congress the authority to ban desecration of the flag.
   Presidential press secretary Marlin Fitzwater said Wednesday that
Bush's proposal would be developed jointly with Michel and Senate
Minority Leader Bob Dole, R-Kan.
   Michel included Democrat Sonny Montgomery of Mississippi in
sponsoring his speech marathon, and more than a dozen lawmakers of
both parties spoke.
   Rep. Charles Wilson, D-Texas, called the Supreme Court ruling ``a
bit of muddle-headed libertarianism'' by the majority, and he
predicted a constitutional amendment would pass.
   The amendment proposals seek to set aside last week's ruling
upholding the constitutionality of flag burning as a form of
political protest.
   Fitzwater had earlier said a final White House amendment would be
ready by the end of the day Wednesday, but later explained the new
target by saying the GOP leaders ``wanted to be part of it.''
   Fitzwater said efforts would be made to reach a consensus
proposal with Republicans and Democrats who favor addressing the
flag issue through a constitutional amendment.
   He said it would likely follow the lines of proposals already
advanced in Congress which have suggested that Congress and the
states have the power to pass laws banning flag desecration.
   Fitzwater said the amendment would likely be only one to three
sentences.
   The outcry began last week with the Supreme Court's 5-4 decision
which overturned flag-desecration laws in 48 states. Both houses
have passed resolutions condemning the decision.
   Gregory Johnson, whose prosecution for participating in a
flag-burning protest at the 1984 Republican National Convention was
barred by the high court's decision, told a news conference in New
York the president should debate him on flag-burning on prime-time
television on the eve of the Fourth of July.
   Johnson said that if the values the flag represents are so
strong, ``you should not have to resort to this kinder, gentler
choke hold on protestors and dissenters.''
   One amendment proposed in Congress by Sen. Strom Thurmond of
South Carolina, senior Republican on the Senate Judiciary Committee,
does not mention criminal penalties but states:
   ``The Congress of the United States and the states have the power
to prohibit the desecrating, mutilating, defacing, defiling or
burning of the flag of the United States.''
   Meanwhile, several House members who voted against a House
resolution condemning the Supreme Court decision said Wednesday they
acted in support of more, rather than less, freedom of expression.
The resolution expressed ``profound concern'' with the ruling.
   Four of the five lawmakers who voted against the non-binding
resolution said they agreed with the 5-4 court majority. The fifth,
Rep. Gus Savage, D-Ill., refused to comment on the vote.
   Rep. William Clay, D-Mo., said the resolution ``just indicates
the hypocrisy in Congress and the nation ... We ought to preserve
freedom of speech. We condemn China for executing (protesters), but
every chance we get, we vote in favor of capital punishment.''

<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Joris Ivens, the documentary filmmaker who believed
movies were political and social tools for bettering the human
condition, has died in Paris, his wife said today. He was 90 years
old.
   Ivens, a founder of the Dutch film industry, died of a heart
attack provoked by kidney failure at Laennec Hospital on Wednesday
night, Marceline Loridan Ivens said.
   Considered one of the world's leading avant-garde documentary
filmmakers, Ivens was known in Holland for his leftist political
beliefs and anti-colonialist views.
   Because of them, he was denied Dutch government support for his
work for decades and at one point was hounded by officials until he
went into self-imposed exile.
   Ivens eventually created about 60 films spanning seven decades,
many devoted to documenting revolutionary struggle.
   His most recent film, ``The Story of Wind,'' was released in
Paris in March. Shot in China, it is a personal view of the Chinese.
   Ivens was hospitalized three times during the filming. But he
always retuned, even though he had to be carried over mountains and
rugged terrain in a rattan stretcher.
   ``He was upset and angry by recent events in China and sent a
telegram just before he entered the hospital calling for economic
sanctions,'' Mrs. Ivens said in a telephone interview.
   Ivens was born Nov. 18, 1898, in Nijmegen, Holland. He briefly
studied economics before turning to filmmaking full time in 1923 and
began to establish an international reputation in 1928-29 with ``De
Brug'' (The Bridge), ``Branding'' (Breakers), and ``Regen'' (Rain).
   His masterpiece is considered ``The Spanish Earth,'' the 1937
film about the Spanish Civil War made with Ernest Hemingway. Ivens
fought on the Republican side during the war.
   He was honored many times and is a French Legionnaire of Honor.
He received the 1955 World Peace Prize in Helsinki, Finland, and the
Special Jury prize at the Venice Film Festival in 1988.
   In 1986, he reconciled with the Dutch Government, which gave him
the Golden Calf award at the Dutch Film Days exhibit in Paris. The
award was accompanied by a formal apology for past treatment by
previous governments.

<HEAD>New Home Sales Rise as Interest Rates Fall</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Sales of new homes edged up 2.7 percent in May
as mortgage interest rates continued to decline, but they remained
well behind the pace set in the previous two years, the government
reported today.
   The Commerce Department said sales of new single-family homes
rose to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 613,000 units in May
following a 9.1 percent increase in April. The April figure was
revised downward from the 10.9 percent increase reported earlier.
   The April increase had been attributed by some economists to an
aberration in sales in February and March, when sales dropped 11.3
percent and 11.9 percent, respectively. Sales had risen 4.6 percent
in January.
   The pace of sales in May still was well behind the 676,000 new
homes sold in 1988 and the 671,000 units sold in 1987.
   For the first five months of the year, new home sales were 7.1
percent lower than in the same period a year earlier.
   The housing industry has been among the sectors of the economy
hardest hit by the Federal Reserve's campaign to push up interest
rates in an effort to slow economic growth and thus restrain
inflation. Recently, it appeared to ease its grip slightly as the
economy showed signs of cooling.
   Fixed-interest rates peaked in March at 11.22 percent and fell
since then to 10.48 percent in the last week in May, according to
the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp.
   The Northeast led the sales rebound in May with a 12.6 percent
increase to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 98,000 units after
falling 20.9 percent in April.
   Sales also were up 7.7 percent in the West to a rate of 197,000
units following a 28 percent jump in April. The South posted an
increase of 2.6 percent to a rate of 234,000 homes after a 16.3
percent hike the month earlier.
   The Midwest had the only decline in sales, off 15.3 percent to an
annual rate of 83,000 units. Sales had been flat in the region
during April and March at an annual rate of 98,000 homes.
   The increase in sales was accompanied by a $9,000 increase to
$125,000 in the median price of the homes sold. The median price
means half the homes sold for more and half for less.
   The average price, which is pulled up by sales of expensive
homes, also increased last month, rising $13,000 to $158,800.

   The state of New Jersey has no right to put
asunder what love has joined together, say a couple who ran afoul of
a regulation barring police officers and court clerks from marrying
each other.
   Joseph and Marie Hughes of North Arlington asked U.S. District
Judge Nicholas Politan on Wednesday to strike down the state
regulation, which was aimed at avoiding any appearance of conflict
of interest.
   Mrs. Hughes has been a municipal court clerk in North Arlington
since 1981, after four years as an acting clerk. Her husband of one
year _ they met in the courthouse _ has been a police officer since
1971.
   ``We happened to fall in love and get married and all of a
sudden, I'm told I'm out of a job,'' Mrs. Hughes said.
   Their lawyer, Lisa Agresti Carey, said the 1977 regulation
interferes with the Hugheses' fundamental right to tie the knot and
is blatantly unconstitutional.
   At Wednesday's hearing, Deputy Attorney General Michael Diller
argued that municipal courts are more intimate than others and are
the most-often used by the average person.
   The rule was necessary to avoid the appearance that police could
influence the court's workings, he said.
   But Politan remarked, ``This is the real world we live in. We're
not dealing with stick men. We're dealing with real people.''
   Politan said he would rule later this summer.
   Under the state Supreme Court regulation that took effect a few
months before Mrs. Hughes became acting clerk, no spouse, parent or
child of a police officer can be made a municipal court clerk or
deputy clerk.
   The Hugheses sued to overturn the rule in February. They have
permission to stay on the job until the issue is resolved.
   Ms. Carey attacked the rule as oppressive to the Hugheses,
illogical and unfair. For one thing, she said, Hughes rarely handles
municipal court cases.
   She said Mrs. Hughes could remove herself from all cases
involving her husband, just as officer-clerk couples who married
before the rule must do.

<TEXT>
   France is allowing shipment of spare parts for
non-lethal military equipment to Libya, the Defense Ministry
announced. It said this will not violate a 1986 European embargo.
   French news commentaries said today the action appears to be a
response to apparent moderation in recent statements and actions by
Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi.
   ``France has simply taken note of a certain number of
demonstrations of appeasement on the part of Col. Gadhafi,'' the
conservative Le Figaro said in a front-page editorial.
   A Defense Ministry statement Wednesday said the exports were
approved by the Interministerial Commission for Export of War
Materiel. It denied that Crotale surface-to-air missiles were
involved and said France will permit no new weapons sales to Libya.
   Reports by Le Figaro, Agence France-Presse and other French news
organizations quoted unidentified officials as saying the parts will
be used to repair radar systems.
   The European Economic Community banned arms sales to Libya in
April 1986 amid reports linking Gadhafi's government to terrorist
attacks. At about the same time, the United States bombed the Libyan
capital, Tripoli, and Benghazi, citing alleged terrorist links.

<TEXT>
   ``The Last Temptation of Christ,''
the subject of one of the most virulent protests in Hollywood
history, is being released today on home video with as little
fanfare as possible.
   Fearful of encouraging more demonstrations and boycotts, MCA Home
Video distributed ``The Last Temptation'' without store displays,
promotional posters or advertising. Some stores refused to carry the
film.
   ``We were conscious of provoking a new controversy, which was
clearly not in anybody's interest,'' said Robert Blattner, president
of MCA Home Video, a company affiliated with ``Last Temptation''
producer Universal Pictures.
   ``On the other hand, we're not willing to keep it on the shelf.
We think it's important that this title be made available in the
marketplace.''
   Many fundamentalist Christian organizations attacked ``The Last
Temptation'' before its debut in theaters last August. Most objected
to director Martin Scorsese's depiction of Jesus, played by Willem
Dafoe, as a doubting messiah with human frailties and sexual
fantasies.
   A secretary for the Rev. Donald Wildmon, a fundamentalist who led
those attacks, said Wednesday that Wildmon planned no protests
against the videocassette debut, as he had threatened to do last
year.
   Blockbuster Video, the nation's largest video-store chain with
343 company-owned outlets, has refused to carry ``The Last
Temptation'' video, which has a suggested retail price of $89.95.
   ``It's certainly unusual, but it was a corporate decision
considering all that went on with the film,'' said Wally Knief, a
spokesman for the Fort Lauderdale-based chain. It is the chain's
first such action against a major studio release, Knief said.
   Nearly 80 percent of Blockbuster's 387 franchise locations also
have indicated they won't carry the video, Knief said.
   Numerous independent stores also will not carry the film. John
Clark, owner of The Video Center in Gilroy, Calif., said that
although the store carries X-rated videos that could be considered
controversial, he would not bring in ``The Last Temptation.''
   ``I just don't need the potential of the community being upset,''
Clark said.
   He said he has a separate room for the sexually explicit movies
and that he was not willing to build another room just for ``The
Last Temptation.''
   Employees of national video retailer Music Plus, which will carry
``The Last Temptation,'' have been instructed to tell patrons that
the chain does not censor its product line because that would not
serve customer needs.
   In New York this morning, clerks at RKO Warner Theater Video and
Tower Video outlets said ``The Last Temptation'' was available for
rental today.
   Although several major theater chains declined to show ``The Last
Temptation,'' it has grossed $8.2 million to date, according to
Exhibitor Relations Co.

   Two trains carrying Serbs from a
nationalist rally in an ethnically troubled province were stoned,
allegedly by ethnic Albanians, Tanjug state news agency reported
today.
   It said two passengers suffered ``severe cuts'' and several
windows were broken when the trains were hit ``by a hail of stones''
Wednesday night as they traveled from the city of Pristina, in
Kosovo, toward mainland Serbia.
   Kosovo is a province within the republic of Serbia.
   The attackers were not caught but are believed to be ethnic
Albanian nationalists, Tanjug said.
   Almost a million Serbs gathered in Kosovo on Wednesday to mark
the 600th anniversary of a legendary battle in which the Ottomon
Turks defeat the Serbs. The defeat started a centuries-long struggle
to keep the Serbian Orthodox Christian faith alive under Islam.
   The majority of people living in Kosovo are Moslem ethnic
Albanians. Serbs are trying to gain more control over the province,
saying it is necessary to prevent harassment by the ethnic Albanians.
   The Serbian campaign has led to ethnic clashes. In March, at
least 25 people were killed in clashes with security forces.

   The U.S. dollar sagged in European trading today
after West Germany, followed by several other countries, announced
higher interest rates.
   The Bundesbank, West Germany's central bank, raised its discount
rate half a percentage point to 5 percent and its Lombard rate by
half a point to 7 percent; both rates are at their highest levels
since the early 1980s. The Lombard is the rate at which the
Bundesbank lends short-term funds using securities as collateral.
   The Swiss National Bank followed by raising its discount rate to
5.5 percent from 4.5 percent, while France added half a point to its
rates, boosting the money market intervention rate to 8.75 percent.
   Austria and the Netherlands also announced interest rate hikes.
   Following the announcements, the dollar dropped to 1.9545 West
German marks, down from 1.9630 late Wednesday. The dollar fell to
1.6715 Swiss francs compared to 1.6870 late Wednesday, and to 6.6060
French francs from 6.6645 late Wednesday.
   The British pound regained ground lost earlier in the session,
moving to $1.5615, compared with $1.5613 late Wednesday.
   In earlier trading in Tokyo, the dollar closed at 142.90 yen,
down from 143.55 on Wednesday. Later in London, the dollar traded at
142.70 yen.
   Other dollar rates in Europe, compared with late Wednesday's
prices, included: 2.2045 Dutch guilders, down from 2.2125; 1,420.70
Italian lire, up from 1,421.50; and 1.1955 Canadian dollars, up from
1.1950.
   Gold opened in London at $374.95, down from $375.25 late
Wednesday. At mid-morning, the city's five major bullion dealers
fixed a recommended price of $376.30.
   Gold traded in Zurich at $375.90 this morning compared to
Wednesday's late price of $373.75.
   Earlier in Hong Kong, gold closed at $376.89, up $2.80 from
Wednesday's close.
   Silver bullion traded in London at $5.30 a troy ounce, unchanged
from late Wednesday.

<HEAD>Court Limits Free-Speech Protections When Commercial Expression Involved</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES H. RUBIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court today placed new limits on
the Constitution's free-speech protections when commercial
expression is involved.
   By a 6-3 vote in a case involving the sale of cookware on State
University of New York campuses, the court said government officials
are not required to adopt the ``least restrictive'' regulations
possible to limit commercial speech.
   Instead, Justice Antonin Scalia said for the court, officials
need only adopt ``reasonable'' _ not ``perfect'' _ rules for
limiting the commercial activity.
   ``Within those bounds we leave it to government decision makers
to judge what manner of regulation may best be employed,'' he said.
   The ``least-restrictive'' test rejected by the court today still
applies to non-commercial speech _ such as political expression.
   In a dissenting opinion, Justice Harry A. Blackmun said the court
was turning its back on important court precedents.
   ``The majority holds that `least-restrictive means' analysis does
not apply to commercial speech cases, a holding it is able to reach
only by recasting a good bit of contrary language in our past
cases,'' Blackmun said.
   He was joined by Justices William J. Brennan and Thurgood
Marshall.
   Scalia said today's ruling is in line with a 1986 ruling that
upheld Puerto Rico's ban on promotional advertising of casino
gambling aimed at Puerto Rican residents.
   In today's case, the justices ordered further lower court
hearings to determine whether a New York state university ban on
commercial activities violates the Constitution because it is too
broad. The court did not answer that question today.
   But the dissenters said the ban does go too far. They said, for
example, it could prevent a student from meeting his doctor or
lawyer in his dorm room if the doctor or lawyer is paid for the
visit.
   It could even prevent a student from paying a music teacher or a
speech therapist to come to the dorm room for tutoring, Blackmun
said.
   Today's case has attracted widespread interest among educators.
   The State University of New York (SUNY) appealed to the court to
revive the university's ban on commercial activities in the dorm _
an appeal supported by university officials in 10 states and groups
representing thousands of college administraors nationwide.
   The SUNY board of trustees adopted a rule in 1966 to prohibit
most commercial enterprises from operating on state university
campuses.
   The ban was challenged by American Future Systems Inc., a
housewares company in Bryn Mawr, Pa., after one of its
representatives was arrested in 1982 at the state university campus
in Cortland, N.Y., for refusing to leave a dormitory.
   The housewares company attracts customers by offering free
Florida vacations to students who arrange sales demonstrations in
their dormitory rooms for groups of their friends.
   A federal judge upheld the SUNY ban. But the 2nd U.S. Circuit
Court of Appeals overturned the judge's ruling last year.
   The appeals court ordered further hearings to determine whether
there may be less restrictive rules to accomplish the university's
purpose.
   In a friend-of-the-court legal brief, officials from 10 states
said, ``The fundamental right of state colleges and universities to
control the use of their premises is at issue.''
   The officials are from state universities in California,
Connecticut, Florida, Michigan, Illinois, Ohio, South Carolina,
Rhode Island, New Jersey and Vermont.
   Other groups that supported the SUNY appeal were the American
Council on Education, the American Association of State Colleges and
Universities, the National Association of State Universities and
Land Grant Colleges and the National Association of Student
Personnel Administrators.
   The case is State University of New York vs. Fox, 87-2013.

<HEAD>Court Limits Indian Tribes' Power to Control Land Use</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICHARD CARELLI</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court today limited the power of
Indian tribes to control, through tribal zoning laws, the use of
land owned by non-Indians within a reservation's boundaries.
   In a case of significance to any state in which an Indian
reservation is located, the court said tribes may be forced to share
the zoning power with state or county officials.
   The justices, in splintered voting that yielded no one majority
opinion, ruled that the Confederated Tribes and Bands of the Yakima
Indian Nation has the authority to regulate _ and may zone _ ``fee''
or privately owned land on about 800,000 acres of its reservation in
Washington state.
   But the court said the tribe has no such power to regulate land
parcels owned by non-Indians on some 500,000 acres of the
reservation.
   The Yakima reservation encompasses 1.3 million acres of land,
most of it within Yakima County. About 5,000 tribal members and
about 20,000 non-members live on the reservation.
   About 800,000 acres, including some 740,000 in Yakima County,
fall within the reservation's ``closed area'' in which the tribe's
zoning ordinance allows no permanent structures.
   Philip Brendale, who owns 160 acres of land within the closed
area, was barred by the tribal ordinance from selling his land for
residential development.
   Stanley Wilkinson, who owns about 100 acres just within the
reservation's northern boundary in the reservation's ``open area,''
was barred from subdividing a portion of his land.
   Neither man is a member of the Yakima tribe. They, along with
Yakima County officials, contended that the tribe lacks the legal
authority to control the use of their land.
   Today, the Supreme Court ruled against Brendale but for Wilkinson
_ drawing a distinction between the ``closed area'' and ``open
area'' lands.
   The closed area is one in which only a very small percentage of
land is held in fee _ by private owners and not the tribe. About
half the land in the open area is privately owned.
   Almost all of the reservation's residents live in the open area.
   The controlling opinion in today's decision was written by
Justice John Paul Stevens, who was joined by Justice Sandra Day
O'Connor.
   He said the difference between the closed and open areas ``is of
critical importance and requires a different disposition'' of the
appeals filed by Brendale and Wilkinson.
   Four court members _ Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist and
Justices Byron R. White, Antonin Scalia and Anthony M. Kennedy _
would have disallowed tribal regulation of private land throughout
the reservation.
   Justices Harry A. Blackmun, William J. Brennan and Thurgood
Marshall voted to allow tribal regulation of privately owned land
throughout the reservation.
   Thus, the vote allowing the tribe to regulate private land in the
reservation's closed area was 5-4. The vote barring the tribe from
regulating private land owned by non-Indians in the open area was
6-3.
   Writing for himself, Brennan and Marshall, Blackmun said,
``Splitting tribal authority over non-Indian fee lands between the
so-called open and closed areas ... is Solomonic in appearance
only.''
   He added, ``Our past decisions and common sense compel a finding
that the tribe has zoning authority over all lands within its
reservation.''
   The efforts to limit tribal control of land use were supported in
friend-of-the-court briefs submitted by the National Association of
Counties, the National League of Cities, the National Governors'
Association and 11 states.
   They are Washington, Arizona, Idaho, Michigan, Montana, Nevada,
New Mexico, North Dakota, South Dakota, Utah and Wyoming.
   Numerous Indian tribes filed friend-of-the-court briefs
supporting the Yakimas.
   The cases are Brendale vs. Confederated Tribes, 87-1622;
Wilkinson vs. Confederated Tribes, 87-1697; and Yakima County vs.
Confederated Tribes, 87-1711.

   An accountant arrested on a TV viewer's tip
June 1 in the slayings of five family members 18 years ago waived
extradition today and left jail for New Jersey.
   Robert P. Clark, who authorities said is actually John E. List,
was escorted by New Jersey sheriff's deputies.
   ``He's gone and we're happy,'' said State Police Major M.H. Bruce.
   Clark was arrested June 1 at the Richmond accounting firm where
he had worked for a year and a half. FBI agents had been tipped off
by a viewer of the program ``America's Most Wanted,'' which 11 days
earlier ran a segment on List.
   The program showed an artist's bust depicting how the
straitlaced, churchgoing List might look today.
   Authorities said List, 63, murdered his mother, wife and three
children in 1971 in Westfield, N.J., then vanished, taking on a new
identity.
   Clark has not admitted he is List, but authorities have
identified him by fingerprints and physical markings. He signed the
extradition papers today as Clark, authorities said.
   Investigators said List had fled to Colorado, then Virginia, and
had built a new life without changing his appearance or profession.

<HEAD>High Court Fails to Issue Decision in Abortion Case</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: Inserts grafs 8-13, In today's decisions, with rulings.</HEAD>

   The Supreme Court did not announce its decision
on the fate of legalized abortions today, instead extending its
1988-89 term until Monday and raising the suspense over the most
closely watched case of the decade.
   The court's lack of action disappointed the scores of abortion
opponents and advocates who waited in line overnight for one of the
few seats available in the courtroom. Others milled outside the
historic court building in anticipation of a decision that could
overturn or retain a woman's right to an abortion.
   The justices are being asked to use the Missouri case to reverse
the court's 1973 landmark Roe vs. Wade decision legalizing abortion.
   Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist said from the bench, ``On
Monday, July 3, the court will announce all the remaining opinions
during this term of the court.''
   In addition, the court left hanging its decision in an important
case on church-state relations.
   That case stems from the holiday displays of a Christmas Nativity
scene and a Hanukkah menorah at government buildings in Pittsburgh.
Lower courts said the displays represented an impermissible
promotion of religion by government.
   The court announced just two rulings from the bench during a
brief public session. The Missouri case called Webster vs.
Reproductive Health Services was not one of them.
   In today's decisions, the court:
   _ Placed new limits on the Constitution's free-speech protections
when commercial expression is involved.
   By a 6-3 vote in a case involving sale of cookware on State
University of New York campuses, the court said government officials
are not required to adopt the ``least restrictive'' regulations
possible to limit commercial speech.
   Instead, Justice Antonin Scalia said for the court, officials
need only adopt ``reasonable'' _ not ``perfect'' _ rules for
limiting the commercial activity.
   _ Limited the power of Indian tribes to control, through tribal
zoning laws, the use of land owned by non-Indians within a
reservation's boundaries.
   In a case of significance to any state in which an Indian
reservation is located, the court said tribes may be forced to share
the zoning power with state or county officials.
   People on either side of the emotional abortion issue were left
with another weekend of anticipation.
   ``It is difficult to wait for the court to hand down these
decisions, of course it is difficult, but we remain optimistic,''
said Olivia Gans of the National Right to Life Committee.
   Faye Wattleton, president of Planned Parenthood, spoke of the
potential for a delay into next year and said it would be ``an
indication of the turmoil that this court is willing to create in
the country.''
   The Webster case is one of three cases separating the court from
its three-month summer recess, which reporters previously had been
led to believe would begin today.
   Despite rumors that some justices are still writing opinions on
the highly controversial abortion and religious cases, the delay
could have an administrative explanation. For example, the court's
computer print shop could be having trouble producing enough copies
of the abortion ruling to meet what will surely be a flood of
requests.
   The case has become the most closely watched Supreme Court
controversy of the 1980s.
   The court must say something about the case, in which oral
arguments were conducted April 26, before ending its current term.
   Rehnquist's statement might indicate that decisions in the
Webster case and two other cases will be announced Monday.
   But instead of announcing a decision, the justices could choose
to order another round of arguments during the term that begins in
October. That would delay a decision until sometime in 1990.
   Roe vs. Wade itself was a case that had to be argued twice before
a decision was announced. Such orders are not rare. The court hears
arguments in about 150 cases each term, and since 1977 has held over
at least one case for reargument the following term.
   In the 1973 decision, the court said women have a constitutional
right, based on their right to privacy, to seek and obain abortions.
   The ruling said a woman's decision to have an abortion during the
first three months of pregnancy must be left to her and her doctor.
It said states may regulate abortions during the second trimester
only to protect the woman's health, and may take steps to protect
fetal life in the third trimester.
   State authority to regulate abortions after the first trimester
was not made absolute, however.
   Suspense grew over the abortion case in the waning weeks of the
court's term, as day after day passed without a decision.
   Opponents and advocates of abortion anxiously awaited the
decision outside the court _ only to be disappointed again today.
   Some opponents prayed; others carried signs protesting abortion,
including one that read ``the child killing must stop.'' Supporters
of a woman's right to abortion toted signs that said ``keep abortion
legal.'' Around them swarmed dozens of reporters and cameramen
waiting to file their stories on a decision that did not come down.
   Competition was keen for the few seats available to the public
inside the courtroom. People began lining up at 6:30 p.m. Wednesday,
more than 15 hours before the justices gathered in the court. Only
about 50 people were allowed inside. The other seats were reserved
far in advance for friends and relatives of court workers, as well
as reporters and lawyers.

   The captain of a tanker that spilled
420,000 gallons of oil was confined to his ship today after being
charged with polluting waters off Rhode Island.
   For the first time since Friday's accident, fishermen were free
today to harvest shellfish from parts of the upper Narragansett Bay.
Officials said almost all the oil had evaporated.
   In two other spills, cleanup crews made headway in mopping up oil.
   Iakovos Georgudis 43, was charged Wednesday with two misdemeanor
counts of discharging pollutants into the water in violation of the
Clean Water Act and Federal Refuse Act. The captain also is under
investigation by a state grand jury.
   Each misdemeanor carries up to a year in prison and a $100,000
fine or double the actual damages, said U.S. Attorney Lincoln
Almond. The Coast Guard has estimated damages at $1.6 million, and
Gov. Edward D. DiPrete said President Bush has promised full federal
reimbursement to the state.
   The Clean Water Act prohibits the negligent discharge of
pollutants; the Refuse Act prohibits unlawfully discharging refuse
into navigable water without a permit.
   Almond said that Georgudis, a Greek resident, was arrested
because of concern that he might leave the United States. The United
States' extradition treaty with Greece does not cover pollution
crimes, he said.
   A federal magistrate set bail at $50,000 and ordered him to
surrender his passport. The magistrate also ordered that the captain
and his Greek tanker World Prodigy remain in Rhode Island waters.
   Almond said Georgudis was confined to the ship ``to insure the
integrity of the vesssel.''
   Meanwhile, in Philadelphia, witnesses at a Coast Guard inquiry
into a spill of about 300,000 gallons on the Delaware River said a
botched anchoring procedure led to the grounding of a tanker and the
spill of industrial heating oil. The hearing was recessed until July
5.
   Hundreds of people have been working to clean up the globs of oil
since the weekend. A hot sun melted some congealed oil on Tuesday,
but cooler weather Wednesday kept the oil in more of a solid
condition. Workers used shovels and pitchforks to remove it.
   ``We believe we are making more progress. And now the weather is
working with us instead of against us,'' said Coast Guard spokesman
Jim Weakley.
   But wind shifts began moving oil toward New Jersey riverbanks,
which had been spared much of the black goo.
   In Houston, crews are nearly finished cleaning up a
250,000-gallon oil spill that occurred Friday when a tanker and a
barge collided in the Houston Ship Channel, but the process has
slowed a bit, officials said.
   Only about 40 of the 6,000 barrels of oil that leaked remained on
the water Wednesday afternoon, U.S. Coast Guard spokesman William
Nash said. But most of the slick was difficult to reach, officials
said.
   Georgudis, who has admitted to Rhode Island's governor and Coast
Guard officials that he made a mistake in navigation, would not be
called to testify before a joint hearing by the Coast Guard and the
National Transportation Safety Board, said the chief investigator,
Coast Guard Capt. David Whitten.
   Whitten said Georgudis intends to invoke his Fifth Amendment
right to protect against self-incrimination.
   The World Prodigy's chief engineer, who does not face
prosecution, was expected to testify today. But Whitten said the
U.S. attorney's office had indicated that testimony by the chief
mate and helmsman could be delayed because of an unexplained snag in
obtaining immunity from prosecution.
   U.S. Attorney Lincoln C. Almond said only that he was trying to
obtain approval for grants of immunity from Washington. He said he
did not know how long it would take.
   Georgudis' lawyer has said the captain would invoke the Fifth
Amendment if brought before the grand jury, which is investigating
possible violations of state pollution laws and a law requiring
harbor pilots aboard ships within Narragansett Bay.
   On Tuesday, helmsman Konstadinos Paraskevopulos invoked the Fifth
Amendment before the grand jury. But after being granted immunity,
he testified Wednesday. He declined to comment afterward.
   Georgudis also declined to comment.
   He said little during the hearing before U.S. Magistrate Jacob
Hagopian except to acknowledge that he spoke English and understood
the charges.
   Coast Guard Lt. Paul Wolf said the unloading of almost 8 million
gallons of oil remaining aboard the ship had been completed to five
barges, where the fuel would be purified.

<HEAD>New Party Chief Calls for Severe Punishment of Protesters</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: New thruout with legislative committee meeting opening, endorsing
crackdown on protesters. No pickup.</HEAD>

   In his first public statement as party chief,
Jiang Zemin said in remarks published today that leaders of the
pro-democracy movement should be severely punished, and he predicted
a long struggle against ``adversaries of socialism.''
   In the remarks, reported in the official press, Jiang also told
intellectuals they would not be victimized for speaking out.
   But he said there would be no tolerance of those ``who stubbornly
stick to bourgeois liberalism,'' or those Western ideals that
infused the student-led movement for a freer China and an end to
official corruption.
   The steering committee of China's legislature held a special
meeting today and endorsed the party's suppression of dissent as
``legal, correct and necessary.''
   Wan Li, chairman of the Standing Committee of the National
People's Congress, opened the meeting of 133 members by praising the
party and government for taking ``resolute measures to quell the
counterrevolutionary rebellion,'' the official news agency Xinhua
said.
   The congress has limited power and is mainly a forum for
endorsing party policy.
   Jiang, the 62-year-old former Shanghai party boss, was named
general secretary of the 47-million-member Communist Party on
Saturday.
   He succeeded Zhao Ziyang, who was dismissed for opposing the use
of military force to crush the pro-democracy movement in Beijing.
   Jiang is considered an economic moderate who supports the line of
senior leader Deng Xiaoping and Premier Li Peng that China must
strike hard at ``counterrevolutionaries'' who led the protests.
   ``We should thoroughly expose and mete out, according to law,
timely and severe punishments to the plotters, organizers and
behind-the-scene commanders'' of the pro-democracy movement, Jiang
said Wednesday during a meeting with leaders of groups affiliated
with the Communist Party.
   ``As for those cruel enemies of the people, we shouldn't have an
iota of forgiveness, or we are making a serious mistake in
history,'' the China Daily quoted him as saying.
   China today expressed ``deep regret'' at the ``unreasonable''
condemnation of the crackdown by the leaders of the 12-nation
European Economic Community. Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Li Jinhua
told a weekly briefing: ``Before finding out the truth concerning
the quelling of the counterrevolutionary rebellion in China, the
European Council worked so fast as to rashly issue a statement on
June 27, making presumptious accusations against China, and
unilaterally adopted decisions jeopardizing the bilateral
relations.''
   The EEC leaders, ending a summit Tuesday, called for an embargo
on arm sales to China and urged the World Bank to postpone new loans
to Beijing. The United States has already cut off arms sales to
China to protest the crackdwon.
   Jiang said in his remarks Wednesday that China would continue to
embrace reform and remain open to the outside world and assured
intellectuals that the policy of ``letting a hundred flowers blossom
and a hundred schools of thought contend'' was unchanged.
   He referred to a 1957 movement initiated by Mao Tse-tung, China's
revolutionary founder, that encouraged freedom of speech.
Intellectuals who spoke out against the party, however, were purged
and jailed in an anti-rightist movement that quickly followed.
   Since the army killed hundreds of unarmed civilians June 4 in
running student protesters out of central Beijing, authorities are
believed to have arrested dozens of intellectuals who supported the
pro-democracy movement.
   In all, about 1,800 people have been arrested, mostly workers who
took part in nationwide protests following the Beijing crackdown.
The government has announced the execution of 27.
   Jiang said the struggle against bourgeois liberalism ``should be
earnestly carried out for a long time.'' He said those who
participated in parades, demonstrations and hunger strikes ``due to
their ignorance of the truth, especially the young students,''
should receive ideological education.
   Beijing radio said today that during summer vacation all primary
and middle-school students will be required to study a June 9 speech
by Deng and the party's June 24 communique on the recent political
turmoil.
   When they return to school in the fall, students will receive a
month of political indoctrination along with their regular studies,
it said.
   Deng's speech, and the communique accompanying Jiang's
appointment, claim ``counterrevolutionary agitators'' infiltrated
the student movement in a bid to overthrow the Communist Party.
   They say that the party was justified in using force to quell the
rebellion.

<HEAD>EDS: New thruout to UPDATE with eight Arabs deported to Lebanon.
No pickup.</HEAD>

   The army today deported eight Arabs accused of
being leaders of the Palestinian uprising against Israeli rule and
sent them to Lebanon, a military communique said.
   The army also announced it demolished the homes of three
Palestinian murder suspects.
   About 20 right-wing legislators guarded by soldiers went on a
hike in the occupied West Bank to dramatize Israel's claim to the
terrritory.
   The expulsions came despite repeated U.S. statements that the
measure is a human rights violation and could mire Washington-backed
efforts to get Middle East peace talks started.
   Israel has deported 55 Palestinians during the 18-month-old
Palestinian uprising in the West Bank and Gaza Strip. Most have been
expelled to neighboring Lebanon.
   An army spokesman said those deported were leaders of the
uprising in the territories and activists of Yasser Arafat's
mainstream PLO faction Fatah and of the Syrian-based Democratic
Front for the Liberation of Palestine.
   There were no immediate details about how they were deported.
   The army communique quoted Defense Minister Yitzhak Rabin as
saying Israel would consider allowing the deportees back home within
three years ``if there will be tranquility in the territories.''
   Israel contends deportations are an effective way to curb
violence.
   In a statement published in February, the Foreign Ministry said
explusions were only done ``in extreme cases where other measures
have not succeeded in stopping hostile activity.''
   Four of today's deportees were from the West Bank and four are
from the Gaza Strip.
   They include two prominent labor union activists _ Mohammed
Abdullah Labadi, 34, and Radwan Ahmad Zayad, 31, both of the
Democratic Front for the Liberation of Palestine, headed by Nayef
Hawatmeh.
   Another is Atah Abu Karesh, 50, from Gaza City, a teacher and a
prominent Fatah activist.
   All three were jailed without trial in the past for anti-Israeli
activities or held on charges of membership in illegal
organizations. The army said all those deported had exhausted legal
appeals.
   Earlier this month, the Democratic Front, to which several of the
deportees belong, warned that expelling more Palestinians would
torpedo negotiations for the return of the body of Samir Assad, a
Druse soldier captured in Lebanon in 1983.
   Palestinians maintained he was killed during an Israeli bombing
raid on a PLO base in 1984.
   The homes razed by the army before dawn included two blown up in
Beit Lahiya and one bulldozed in Rafah, both in the Gaza Strip.
   The Beit Lahiya houses were home to 15 people, including two
members of the Moslem fundamentalist Hamas movement accused of axing
to death an alleged Palestinian collaborator, the army and Arab
reports said.
   The Rafah building belonged to a family whose son was charged
with slaying an Israeli soldier in Gaza two years ago. The son was
shot to death by soldiers last year after escaping from prison.
   Among the right-wing legislators who walked through the West Bank
were several members of Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir's Likud bloc.
   The 20 legislators were guarded by about two dozen soldiers, and
their walk preceded about 50 hikes planned by Jewish settlers Friday
in the West Bank.
   Lawmaker Benny Begin, the son of former Prime Minister Menachem
Begin, told The Associated Press he was hiking to protest stoning
attacks on Jews and to stress there was an important historic link
between Israel and the West Bank.
   ``A Jew can walk on any trail in the Catskill Mountains in
upstate New York,'' Begin said. ``It is discrimination against Jews
to say that in these areas only Arabs can live and walk freely, free
from stones, knives and firebombs.''
   The 90-minute hike went without incident except for an illegal
Palestinian flag unfurled in the nearby village of Kunya after the
legislators passed through.

   Hundreds of steelworkers rallied in a small Virginia town against
Pittston Coal Group Inc. in support of 37,000 defiant miners in
their eight-state walkout.
   At another rally Wednesday, coal miners and supporters planted
small white wooden crosses in the lawn of Pittston's parent company
in Greenwich, Conn.
   In southern West Virginia, where pickets have blocked Pittston
trucks, Circuit Judge Eric O'Briant on Wednesday slapped the miners'
union with more than a dozen contempt citations and set an Aug. 1
hearing to determine whether the union should compensate Pittston
for losses.
   In St. Paul, Va., 300 steelworkers joined nearly 2,700 United
Mine Workers members and supporters from a half dozen states.
   ``Every union man in this country has a stake in this,'' said
Mike Hathaway, a wildcat striker from Steelville, Ill. ``If they
break this union, they'll break every union right on down the line.''
   ``We're just trying to show these miners that unions around the
country are behind them 100 percent,'' said Joe Kiker, a steelworker
from Atlanta and a former coal miner. ``It's our fight, too.''
   About 1,600 Pittston miners went on strike April 5 in West
Virginia and Virginia after working 14 months without a contract.
The company is seeking cutbacks that it says are needed to compete
with foreign coal producers.
   The strikers were joined earlier this month by 300 Pittston
miners in Kentucky.
   The walkout triggered sympathy strikes beginning June 12 and at
one point included 46,000 miners in West Virginia, Alabama,
Illinois, Indiana, Kentucky, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Tennessee, Virginia
and Missouri. The wildcat miners in Missouri and Virginia have gone
back to work.
   Coal industry and union officials estimate 37,000 miners remain
out.
   Before Wednesday night's rally in Virginia, the governors of
three more states joined four others in calling for an end to the
Pittston strike.
   Govs. Richard Thompson of Illinois, Robert Casey of Pennsylvania
and John Ashcroft of Missouri asked the UMW and Pittston to resume
negotiations.
   ``No one knows better than you the terrible economic and
emotional strain of a protracted strike,'' Ashcroft wrote to Paul
Douglas, chairman of The Pittston Co., the coal company's parent.
   There was no immediate response from the union or Pittston.
   The call echoed requests of Govs. Gaston Caperton of West
Virginia, Richard Celeste of Ohio, Gerald Baliles of Virginia and
Wallace Wilkinson of Kentucky.
   A federal judge in Charleston, W.Va., this week ordered an end to
the wildcat strike, but strikers have largely ignored previous
back-to-work orders.
   The UMW says it has not authorized the wildcat strikes, which
violate the contract the union signed in February 1988 with the
Bituminous Coal Operators Association, which represents most major
coal operators but not Pittston.
   On Wednesday, four coal trucks in West Virginia and Virginia were
peppered with bullets and two others were damaged by steel balls
fired from slingshots. No injuries were reported and no arrests were
made.
   Shots were fired at coal trucks and on picket lines late last
week for the first time since the wildcat strikes began. No one was
seriously injured.
   In Virginia, union members continued to create traffic jams on
coal hauling roads despite a federal judge's threat of daily fines
of $120,000.
   Hundreds of cars and trucks paraded slowly on a narrow road
linking Pittston Coal Group's main processing plant with supply
mines, said State Police spokesman Charlie Vaughan.
   At the rally in Connecticut, 350 coal miners and their families
held an emotional but peaceful rally outside Pittston headquarters.
They carried small crosses bearing the names of miners killed in
accidents or dead from black lung disease.
   The demonstrators were bused to Connecticut from Pennsylvania and
Virginia by the union.

   A federal judge has ruled that The Boston Globe may
question participants in a police officer's drug trial under oath
because a court clerk erased the tape recording of the case.
   U.S. District Judge Joseph L. Tauro's ruling Wednesday allows the
newspaper's lawyers to subpoena and take depositions from
participants in the 1987 cocaine possession trial in state court,
the Globe said today.
   Experts couldn't say whether such a re-creation had been allowed
before, but David Sellers, spokesman for the Administrative Office
of U.S. Courts in Washington, said, ``It's certainly something that
sounds highly unusual.''
   The Globe has said its aim is to check out a tip that Salvador
Aponte, who no longer is on the police force, had been found guilty,
but then was acquitted after a defense lawyer told the judge the
officer would be fired if convicted.
   The newspaper sued in federal court 18 months ago to get the tape.
   Last year, Tauro ruled that a law sealing from the public court
records in criminal cases that did not end in convictions was
unconstitutional.
   But the clerk's office later found that the tape recording of the
trial had been erased, James Mannering, assistant clerk, told The
Associated Press today.
   Lawyers for the Globe reported to Tauro that court clerks said
they ran short of tapes and erased the Aponte trial despite a
February 1988 order to keep tapes for at least 2{ years. The
newspaper said the attorney general's office did not tell anyone in
the clerk's office that the Aponte trial was the subject of a
federal lawsuit and had to be preserved.

<HEAD>Yeltsin Says Poverty Will Spark Soviet Revolution In Two Years</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BUDAPEST, Hungary (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Soviet legislator Boris N. Yeltsin said
in an interview shown today that poor living standards will lead to
a revolution in the Soviet Union within two years.
   ``Forty-eight million people live under the poverty line, which
means that we are on the brim of a precipice,'' the maverick
Communist told Hungarian state television in an interview Wednesday
night. The official MTI news agency carried excerpts from the
interview today.
   ``I think patience won't last longer than one or two more years.
That's the maximum. And then the people will take their destiny into
their own hands. The revolution from above will turn into a
grass-roots, spontaneous revolution,'' said Yeltsin, who last month
was named to the new Supreme Soviet.
   He said perestroika, Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev's program
to reform the economy, ``should not have been introduced in so many
fields.''
   ``We should carry out a political reform, this should be the
starting point. Then the scope of perestroika should be narrowed,''
Yeltsin said.
   ``We should postpone the space program, cut defense expenditure
and slash industrial investment costs by 30 percent,'' he said
without elaborating.
   ``If we had done this from the beginning, we could have raised
the living standards of the people over the last four years.''
   Yeltsin was dismissed as Communist Party chief for Moscow in 1987
after he said Gorbachev's changes were not proceeding fast enough.
   When he won a congress seat, he achieved one of the most stunning
political comebacks in Soviet history. He won the seat only after
another legislator stepped down and gave his spot to Yeltsin.

   The scene was set, the demonstrators in place,
the banners unfurled, but no drama occurred on the sun-splashed
plaza outside the U.S. Supreme Court building today.
   The court's long-awaited decision on abortion was postponed once
again, perhaps until Monday, perhaps later.
   The effect was like air escaping from a well-filled balloon.
   ``What a letdown,'' said a young Capitol Hill intern who said she
had waited in line for a seat in the courtroom since 4 a.m.
   Disappointed spectators streamed out of the court shortly after
10 a.m., filing down the marble steps toward the hundred
demonstrators gathered on the broad sidewalk.
   They were almost equally divided between the forces opposing
abortion and those advocating a woman's right to choose.
   On the left were yellow banners with black letters: ``The Child
Killing Must Be Stopped.''
   On the right were purple banners with white letters: ``Keep
Abortion Legal.''
   In between were the large color photographs of bleeding fetuses
that have been seen at anti-abortion demonstrations across the
country.
   In the center, a kneeling, bearded man in the robes of a monk
said his rosary while frowning at pro-choice placards three feet
away.
   Earlier, a line of hundreds of people had snaked around the court
in hopes of a seat inside.
   At its head was Michael Carrier, who identified himself as a
student at Yale University.
   ``I've been here since 6:30 last night,'' he said. ``I've been
sleeping on concrete. I've been not sleeping on concrete.''
   ``I'm here because I feel this is such an important decision,''
Carrier said. ``I just had to be here when it came down.''
   He was not the only person to have spent the night at the court.
Not the only one to be disappointed.
   A woman who was No. 5 in the line had been there since 9:30 p.m.
Wednesday night.
   ``We spent most of the night talking, speculating on what would
happen,'' said another woman. ``You get pretty chummy in a situation
like that.''
   Nearby, other signs. A small girl holds a placard larger than she
is: ``My Mother Chose Life.''
   Another girl holds a sign reading, ``Why Do My Future Playmates
Have to Die.''
   But there was no decision.
   And the commentators, poised to comment, commented anyway.
   The old and emotional arguments, for and against. The speculation
on what the postponement meant.
   But one central figure had nothing to add.
   Frank Sussman, the attorney who argued the case before the court
for pro-choice advocates, was asked to comment.
   He threw up his hands.
   ``There's nothing new,'' he said. ``Nothing happened.''
   ``We've got a paper to put out,'' a reporter shouted.
   ``I've got a paper to read,'' Sussman replied. ``I'll read
another part.''
   Then, referring to the manager of the Cincinnati Reds baseball
team under investigation for gambling, Sussman added:
   ``Go talk to Pete Rose.''

<HEAD>More Abortion Cases Pending Before Supreme Court</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: Top 4 grafs update with delay on ruling; picks up at pvs 4th
graf, If one</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICHARD CARELLI</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   If the Supreme Court wants to plunge back into
the abortion issue after the Webster dispute, three cases _ from
Illinois, Ohio and Minnesota _ now pending before the justices offer
immediate opportunities.
   Any of the three could lead the court to re-evaluate its 1973 Roe
vs. Wade decision, which said women have a constitutional right to
seek and obtain abortions.
   The court already is assessing a woman's abortion rights in a
Missouri case called Webster vs. Reproductive Health Services. No
decision was announced in the Webster case today, but the court said
its 1988-89 term will end on Monday.
   A decision could come then, or the justices could choose to
request new arguments during the next term.
   If one or more of the other three cases is granted review before
the end of the court's current term or early in the 1989-90 term
that begins next October, a decision likely would be announced
sometime in 1990.
   Of the three pending cases, the Illinois dispute might affect Roe
vs. Wade most directly. It would be extremely difficult for the
court to revive the Illinois laws without substantially dismantling
its 1973 decision.
   Th's accident, fishermen were free
today to harvest shellfish from parts of the upper Narragansett Bay.
Officials said almost all the oil had evaporated.
   In two other spills, cleanup crews made headway in mopping up oil.
   Iakovos Georgudis 43, was charged Wednesday with two misdemeanor
counts of discharging pollutants into the water in violation of the
Clean Water Act and Federal Refuse Act. The captain also is under
investigation by a state grand jury.
   Each misdemeanor carries up to a year in prison and a $100,000
fine or double the actual damages, said U.S. Attorney Lincoln
Almond. The Coast Guard has estimated damages at $1.6 million, and
Gov. Edward D. DiPrete said President Bush has promised full federal
reimbursement to the state.
   The Clean Water Act prohibits the negligent discharge of
pollutants; the Refuse Act prohibits unlawfully discharging refuse
into navigable water without a permit.
   Almond said that Georgudis, a Greek resident, was arrested
because of concern that he might leave the United States. The United
States' extradition treaty with Greece does not cover pollution
crimes, he said.
   A federal magistrate set bail at $50,000 and ordered him to
surrender his passport. The magistrate also ordered that the captain
and his Greek tanker World Prodigy remain in Rhode Island waters.
   Almond said Georgudis was confined to the ship ``to insure the
integrity of the vesssel.''
   Meanwhile, in Philadelphia, witnesses at a Coast Guard inquiry
into a spill of about 300,000 gallons on the Delaware River said a
botched anchoring procedure led to the grounding of a tanker and the
spill of industrial heating oil. The hearing was recessed until July
5.
   The focus of the cleanup shifted today as changing winds directed
the oil from the Delaware side of the river toward New Jersey. By
this morning, 98 oil-covered birds had been brought to a rescue
center near Wilmington, Del.
   Coast Guard officials said the cleanup was going well partly
because rain and cooler weather helped congeal the oil, which had
begun to liquefy in the hot sun Tuesday. As of 8 p.m. Wednesday,
146,500 gallons of the estimated 306,000 gallons spilled had been
recovered, the Coast Guard said.
   In Texas, crews were nearly finished cleaning up a 250,000-gallon
oil spill that occurred Friday when a tanker and a barge collided in
the Houston Ship Channel, but the process has slowed a bit,
officials said.
   Only about 840 of the 252,000 gallons of oil that leaked remained
on the water this morning, but most of the slick was difficult to
reach, the Coast Guard said.
   Georgudis, who has admitted to Rhode Island's governor and Coast
Guard officials that he made a mistake in navigation, would not be
called to testify before a joint hearing by the Coast Guard and the
National Transportation Safety Board, said the chief investigator,
Coast Guard Capt. David Whitten.
   Whitten said Georgudis intends to invoke his Fifth Amendment
right to protect against self-incrimination.
   The World Prodigy's chief engineer, who does not face
prosecution, was expected to testify today. But Whitten said the
U.S. attorney's office had indicated that testimony by the chief
mate and helmsman could be delayed because of an unexplained snag in
obtaining immunity from prosecution.
   U.S. Attorney Lincoln C. Almond said only that he was trying to
obtain approval for grants of immunity from Washington. He said he
did not know how long it would take.
   Georgudis' lawyer has said the captain would invoke the Fifth
Amendment if brought before the grand jury, which is investigating
possible violations of state pollution laws and a law requiring
harbor pilots aboard ships within Narragansett Bay.
   On Tuesday, helmsman Konstadinos Paraskevopulos invoked the Fifth
Amendment before the grand jury. But after being granted immunity,
he testified Wednesday. He declined to comment afterward.
   Georgudis also declined to comment.
   He said little during the hearing before U.S. Magistrate Jacob
Hagopian except to acknowledge that he spoke English and understood
the charges.
   Coast Guard Lt. Paul Wolf said the unloading of almost 8 million
gallons of oil remaining aboard the ship had been completed to five
barges, where the fuel would be purified.

   A man who built a $30,000 swimming pool
and patio behind his house may have to dig it all up because it's
not in his back yard.
   David Brady, a real estate developer, said the pool is less than
25 feet from his house and he assumed the Manchester Water Works'
fence at an adjoining reservoir was the boundary line.
   But he had the property surveyed after construction started, and
found out the pool was on the water department's land.
   ``I'd make him yank it out. Or open it up to the public,'' was
Building Commissioner Armand Gaudreault's first reaction Wednesday.
Brady said the pool couldn't be opened to the public because there
is no access.
   The commissioners said they would try to decide next month what
to do, with three possible options: sell Brady the 7,500-square-foot
tract, lease it to him, or have him remove the patio and pool.
   Brady said he'd be happy to lease the land.

   A teen-ager believed to be a member of a
``skinhead'' organization has been sentenced to three years in
prison for painting Nazi insignias on a synagogue and a Jewish
Community Center.
   Frank Joseph Smithart, 19, apologized for the vandalism and
pleaded guilty to two counts of second-degree criminal mischief for
defacing the entrances to the two buildings.
   Circuit Judge Braxton Kittrell said Wednesday he would reconsider
the sentence after Smithart completes a 90-to-180-day stint at the
Department of Corrections ``boot camp'' for new inmates.
   Assistant District Attorney Tom Harrison recommended jail time
for Smithart since property damage exceeded $4,000.
   A 17-year-old boy and a 17-year-old girl also were arrested in
connection with the vandalism last year. They were placed on
probation.
   The defendants painted Nazi swastikas, ``SS,'' ``Hitler rules''
and obscenities on the buildings.

   A farmer who had $30,000 in savings seized
for non-payment of taxes rented a car and rammed it through the
glass doors of the Justice Ministry building, a newspaper reported
Thursday.
   The 38-year-old farmer, who was not identified, had been living
in the Philippines and returned home several months ago to find his
entire savings seized, said the Dagbladet daily newspaper.
   The man said he was forced to live on welfare handouts while
trying to straighten out the dispute over the tax bill, which he
said never reached him, the report said.
   Witnesses to the Wednesday incident said the farmer twice rammed
the glass doors of the building before smashing through.
   The taxpayer quietly waited in the lobby next to the car for
police. He offered to pay for the damages as soon his case was
settled and his savings were released, the newspaper said.
   ``This is clearly a cry for help,'' said his attorney, Odd-Rune
Trostrup. The amount of the tax bill was not disclosed.

<HEAD>Czech Police Warn Havel He Can Be Jailed</HEAD>
<DATELINE>VIENNA, Austria (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Vaclav Havel, the banned playwright who
has become a symbol of dissent in Czechoslovakia, has been warned by
the secret police that he can be jailed again, his brother said
today.
   ``They did not give an explanation for their warning,'' Ivan
Havel said in a telephone interview from Prague.
   Havel, who was freed on probation May 17 midway through an
eight-month jail sentence that drew protest at home and abroad, was
summoned Tuesday to police headquarters in Trutnov. It is 75 miles
northeast of Prague and near Hradecek village where the playwright
was staying.
   Two security officials from Prague met Havel and warned him his
activities could be qualified as incitement to rebellion, Ivan Havel
said. They said the playwright could go back to jail, he said.
   The police did not elaborate on their charges and Havel was
allowed to return to his summer retreat, his brother said.
   Hungarian television Wednesday night broadcast an interview with
Havel in which he criticized the Czechoslovak leadership's
reluctance to embrace reform.
   Havel's interview likely was watched by many of the more than
500,000 ethnic Hungarians living in the Czech border province of
Slovakia.
   Havel was sentenced to eight months in jail for incitement
connected to anti-government protests marking the anniversary of the
suicide of Jan Palach, a Czech student who burned himself to death
in January 1969 to protest the crushing of reforms after the 1968
Soviet-led invasion.
   After being freed for good behavior, Havel spoke out for
political reform and urged those who campaigned for his release not
to forget other political prisoners.
   He noted that Czechoslovak leaders, while adopting the language
of reform, had yet to emulate what he called astonishing changes in
Hungary, Poland and Moscow.
   ``I don't see anything threatening in the Hungarian
developments,'' Havel reportedly told Budapest television. ``Of
course, everything that is happening in Hungary, Poland and the
Soviet Union is a threat to our ruling clique.''
   The Czechoslovak leadership already has expressed concern over
fast-moving political and economic reforms in Hungary, which plans
democratic elections next year.
   ``Eventually (Soviet leader Mikhail S.) Gorbachev will have to
deal with the 1968 invasion ... He knows that as soon as they
(Soviets) review their 1968 move, it will leave this (Prague)
leadership no option but to depart from the scene,'' Havel
reportedly told Hungarian television.

   Police arrested a man and charged him
with killing a Saudi Arabia diplomat near his embassy in January,
police said Thursday.
   Adinant Songkerwala, 31, was arrested June 22 while waiting
outside the office of the inspector general of the Education
Ministry, whom he planned to kill, a police officer said.
   Maj. Gen. Thanu Homhual, commander of southern Bangkok
metropolitan police, said police had been trailing Adinant after the
Jan. 4 killing of the diplomat, but were forced to arrest him since
he appeared ready to kill again.
   Saleh Abdullah Maliki, 35, a third secretary at the Saudi Arabian
Embassy, was killed while walking home from his embassy.
   Adinant confessed he was paid to kill the Education Ministry
official but denied he shot Maliki, Thanu said.
   Thanu said witnesses identified Adinant as the diplomat's killer.
   Police are seeking two others suspected of involvement in the
murder.
   Thanu said Maliki's murder may have stemmed from conflicts
between him and Thai agencies that place Thai workers in Saudi
Arabia. One of the diplomat's chief responsibilities was issuing
visas for Thai workers.

<HEAD>Leading Newspaper Group Barred From Parliament</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Kenya's leading newspaper group has been
barred indefinitely from covering Parliament on grounds it is
anti-government, subversive and tribalistic.
   Deputy Speaker Kalonzo Musyoka, who proposed Wednesday's motion
against the Nation Group, cited its relationship with the St.
Petersburg (Fla.) Times as one reason for the banning.
   ``Some journalists have been trained there on how to subvert
their nation,'' said Musyoka.
   Some current and former Nation staffers worked at the Florida
newspaper under an exchange program.
   There was no comment on Parliament's action from the Nation
Group, which is owned by the Aga Khan, the spiritual leader of the
Ismailia Moslem sect.
   The group includes three Swahili-language newspapers and two
English-language newspapers including the Daily Nation, with a
circulation of about a quarter of a million daily.
   The Daily Nation bore the brunt of Parliament's ire and was
accused of ``twisting facts,'' abusing freedom of speech, subversion
and undermining the ruling party and parliamentarians.
   The tabloid carried an extensive account of the debate in
Thursday's editions but offered no editorial comment.
   ``The Daily Nation has continued to play the role of a divider,''
said Elijah Mwangale, minister for livestock development. ``We
should censor it as an example to other newspapers so that they play
their correct role.''
   Musyoka cited ``cynical and witty'' stories whose ``sole purpose
was to cause disunity'' and divisiveness and an article that
portrayed the House as having lost its freedom to debate openly and
freely.
   ``The newspaper is saying there is no freedom of speech in the
House,'' Musyoka said.
   Members of parliament also accused the Daily Nation of tribalism.
   ``Daily Nation has a racialistic attitude due to its ownership,''
said Johnstone Makau, a minister for state. ``It is out to safeguard
their community and another tribe.''
   The action was taken under a standing order that allows
Parliament to exclude any media that ``neglect or fail to report the
business of the House correctly.''

<HEAD>Rebel Archbishop Attends Ordination of Eight New Priests</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ECONE, Switzerland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Rebel archbishop Marcel Lefebvre
attended the ordinations of eight new traditionalist priests
Thursday, one year after he was excommunicated from the Roman
Catholic church.
   The ceremony was conducted by Bernard Tissier de Mallerais, one
of the four new bishops Lefebvre consecrated in 1988 in defiance of
papal orders, creating what the Vatican said was a historic split in
the church.
   The ordinations raised to 222 the number of traditionalist
priests in Lefebvre's St. Pius X Fraternity, according to the Rev.
Franz Schmidberger, the German priest who succeeded the archbishop
in 1984 as the fraternity's Superior General.
   He said 16 priests and 19 seminarians have left the movement
since Pope John Paul II took the action against Lefebvre and warned
his followers they also would be excommunicated unless they break
with him.
   In the same period, 34 new priests were ordained by the four new
bishops, Schmidberger said. Attendance at the Fraternity's six
theological schools in Switzerland, Australia, the United States,
France and West Germany totals more than 250, he added.
   Despite his ranking as titular head of the Fraternity,
Schmidberger was not consecrated last year and thus escaped
automatic excommunication.
   Lefebvre, 83, watched Thursday's ceremonies from a chair near the
altar in a tent set up on a meadow below the first traditionalist
seminary, opened 19 years ago.
   The Mass was celebrated in the Latin, 16th century rite that was
replaced by the Mass in vernacular under the 1962-65 Vatican Council
reforms, chief target of traditionalist criticism.

<HEAD>Investigators Met With Former Housing Official's Attorneys</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: TOPS with 13 grafs to update with Bush testimony and postponement
of Cushing appearance; edits thruout to conform</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICHARD L. VERNACI</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Members of a congressional panel investigating
abuse and mismanagement in a federal low-income housing program
today allowed one witness scheduled to appear before them to
postpone his testimony while another witness sought to clarify
previous statements he had made.
   Hunter Cushing, former deputy assistant secretary for
multi-family housing at the Department of Housing and Urban
Development, asked congressional investigators to give him more time
to review documents and prepare to answer their questions.
   ``I've only recently been retained and not had adequate
opportunity to review the facts in this case,'' said Jamie Gorelick,
an attorney who accompanied the former HUD official.
   Gorelick said Cushing, a deputy assistant secretary at the
Commerce Department, would appear voluntarily before the House
subcommittee on employment and housing after Congress' July 4th
recess.
   Rep. Tom Lantos, D-Calif., the subcommittee chairman, excused
Cushing and said he would be recalled.
   The subcommittee's hearings resumed today with a second
appearance by Fred Bush, a 1988 fund-raiser for George Bush's
presidential effort who sought ``to make a few clarifying statements
of my earlier testimony.'' Bush, who is not related to the
president, previously testified on May 25.
   Bush earned $268,000 as a consultant on a project in Puerto Rico
funded under the HUD's moderate rehabilitation program and $253,000
on a technical assistance grant to another project on the island.
   Bush, the ambassador-designate to Luxembourg, originally told the
subcommittee he contacted Deborah Gore Dean, former executive
assistant to then-HUD Secretary Samuel, after finding her name in a
federal executive telephone directory.
   Bush said today, however, that one of his former colleagues at
Bush &amp; Co. reminded him they had contacted Ms. Dean after Cushing
and the colleague spoke at a social gathering.
   ``They have told me of their best recollection. Sometime in late
1984 or early 1985 one of my colleagues met Hunter Cushing at a
social gathering and learned that he worked at HUD,'' said Bush.
   ``My colleague's recollection is that Mr. Cushing taold him we
should talk to Deborah Gore Dean,'' he said, adding that the
colleague asked Bush if he knew Ms. Dean.
   Bush said he didn't and it was then that he consulted the
directory ``to see who Ms. Dean was.''
   Members of the panel have met with lawyers for Dean, who won't
testify about influence-peddling for federal money, but neither side
will say whether they are working on a deal.
   Dean, the former official at the center of the dispute, said she
spent Wednesday sifting through a box of documents from her tenure
at the HUD.
   That was about all she would say.
   ``Please don't do this to me,'' Dean said during a brief
telephone conversation. ``I'm very bad at hanging up on people. I
think it's rude, and I always get stuck.''
   One of Ms. Dean's attorneys, Charles Leeper, acknowledged the
meeting with congressional investigators.
   ``Our client has asserted the Fifth Amendment privilege, and
we're not under any obligation, as things stand now, to appear again
before the subcommittee, but we're continuing discussions with
them,'' Leeper said.
   Meanwhile, an auditor's report released Wednesday showed that HUD
gave millions of dollars to private apartment projects around the
country in 1987 and 1988 although they did not qualify under the
agency's own guidelines.
   The funds came from a HUD discretionary fund intended to help
financially ailing projects which were insured by the Federal
Housing Administration, said the report released by Rep. Bill Green,
R-N.Y.
   Green said the audit of awards to 25 projects indicated that $30
million of $35 million granted ``went to undeserving or low-need
projects.''
   Ms. Dean, who appeared before the subcommittee last month, has
invoked her constitutional right against self-incrimination in
refusing to testify about her role in awarding HUD money.
   The panel is investigating allegations that millions of dollars
were steered to developers who were either former HUD employees or
hired top Republicans, such as former Interior Secretary James Watt,
who sold their services as consultants for six-figure fees.
   The New York Times reported today that one prominent Republican
who received a consulting fee to help a project win federal housing
funds was Fred Brown, a New York businessman and chairman of the
National Black Republican Council.
   A 1987 audit by HUD investigators questioned Brown's $50,000 fee
for consulting work on behalf of New Haven, Conn., in its successful
bid for a $10 million federal Urban Development Action Grant.
   Asked if he has discussed a deal with Ms. Dean's attorneys under
which she could be granted immunity for her testimony before the
panelLantos replied: ``I can confirm that I have met with them, but
I am not at liberty to discuss what they talked to me about and what
I talked to them about.''
   A parade of witnesses identified Ms. Dean as the HUD official
whose support was crucial in getting scarce housing funds from the
department. Ms. Dean was executive assistant to Housing Secretary
Samuel Pierce Jr.
   After more than a month of hearings, Rep. Christopher Shays,
R-Conn., said in an interview Wednesday that some contradictions
have emerged, but he refused to specify what they were or who made
them.
   ``I think there are some persons who are dangerously close to
perjuring themselves,'' Shays said. ``We have some conflicting
testimony.''
   Shays, a member of the Government Operations subcommittee, has
been outspoken in his criticism of the management of HUD during the
eight years of the Reagan administration.
   He said some of the conflicts among witnesses also may be due to
poor memory or misunderstanding the questions.
   But Lantos, while not disagreeing with Shays, said he will wait
until the hearings are nearly over before saying whether any of the
witnesses have lied.

   The author of a state law allowing
authorities to withhold the names of crime victims said today he
will seek to repeal the measure, which has angered news
organizations and confused police.
   Rep. Fred Blair, a Democrat, said he asked Gov. Bill Clements to
allow legislators to repeal the law during a special session that
ends July 19.
   ``I think the need at this time is to repeal the bill because of
what is going on now and because of the future misapplication of the
bill,'' said Blair.
   The law, which went into effect June 14 and is thought to be the
first of its kind in the nation, allows police, fire and other
agencies to withhold felony victims' names, addresses or other
information that could lead to their identification.
   Previously, police reports were open to the public.
   Sponsors of the law said they meant to protect crime victims from
sales pitches by security and alarm companies and that their intent
was misinterpreted.
   Now, the news media in some cities cannot get routine crime
information, such as the names of people killed in drunken-driving
accidents. State troopers have been instructed to withhold such
information.
   Amid calls from legislators to amend the law, the Odessa American
newspaper Wednesday left a blank space where its police blotter goes.
   ``It's absurd,'' M. Olaf Frandsen, managing editor of The Odessa
American, wrote. ``You no longer are entitled to know if a burglar
is working your neighborhood, or if an acquaintance or relative has
been traumatized by a criminal and could use your help.''
   Odessa police have sealed arrest reports, though the Ector County
sheriff hasn't changed his release policy, Frandsen said.
   Rebecca Daugherty of the Reporters Committee for Freedom of the
Press in Washington said a scan of the agency's records showed no
other state has enacted a law summarily closing victim information
to the public.
   State Sens. Kent Caperton and Cyndi Krier said they will ask Gov.
Bill Clements to put the issue on the special session agenda.
   ``We need to repeal the harm that is done by this bill,'' said
Caperton. It ``just slipped through.''
   Clements said Wednesday he was surprised by the reaction and how
the bill has been interpreted. When he signed it, the governor said
he thought ``certain victims would be reasonably protected ... but I
didn't think that the records would be put in seclusion, so to
speak.''
   Blair and Sen. John Leedom said they sponsored the bill for the
Dallas Police Department, which has had voluminous requests by
security companies for crime reports that can help them make sales.
   Texas Media, a freedom of information lobby composed of several
statewide news associations, is discussing how to respond to the law.
   In Fort Worth, Police Chief Thomas Windham said he doesn't like
the law but his department would be risking a lawsuit if it did not
strictly follow it. Police will not be able to tell the public about
homicide victims, or even newsworthy crimes of a less serious
nature, the chief said.
   ``If the mayor's car gets stolen _ like it did a while back _ we
wouldn't be able to make that a news story,'' he said. ``It sure
places us in a tremendous confused state over here.''

<HEAD>Spoleto Festival Features Shakespeare to Marilyn Monroe</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SPOLETO, Italy (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Performances ranging from Shakespeare to an
opera based on the life of Marilyn Monroe are part of the 18-day run
of music, dance and art at the 32nd annual ``Festival of Two
Worlds.''
   The international festival's program kicks off Thursday night
with Jacque Levy Offenbach's tragicomic opera ``Tales of Hoffman,''
directed by David Stahl.
   One of the festival's highlights will be the world premiere of
Carlos Gimenz's play ``No One Writes to the Colonel,'' based on the
book by Gabriel Garcia Marquez and interpreted by the Rajatabla
theater company of Venezuela.
   ``Lyrical Scenes from the Life of Sarah,'' inspired by Marilyn
Monroe and written by Belgian composer Paul Uys, and works by
Shakespeare, Oscar Wilde and Italian playwrights and poets will
round out the prose program.
   ``After several years of disappointments,'' wrote Dino Villatico
in the national daily La Repubblica, ``this year's festival finally
offers works that are worthy of its fame.''
   Laurie Anderson, the American avant-garde musician who was
scheduled to perform, won't appear due to ``technical
difficulties,'' newspapers reported Thursday.
   Among the dance troupes to perform are the Senegal National
Ballet, American choreographer Mark Morris' Monnaie Dance Group and
the Teatro Lirico Nacional of Madrid directed by Russian ballerina
Maya Plissetskaya.
   The 1989 program includes three operas, three dance and 11 prose
productions, and 42 concerts, in addition to art exhibits and films.
Films to be shown are a sampling of American horror and Italian
classics.
   After several years of financial difficulties, this year's
festival has a budget of $5.5 million, thanks to grants and
sponsors. About $750,000 in tickets were sold.
   Giancarlo Menotti, the Pulitzer Prize-winning composer and
founder of the festival, chose Spoleto in 1957 as a site to merge
the cultural worlds of Europe and America. In 1977 he brought the
annual festival to Charleston, S.C., and in 1986 he expanded the
project to Melbourne, Australia. He still participates in the
festival's organization.
   This year's festival runs through July 16.

<HEAD>City Reservoir Is Bathtub For Pigs</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SAN FRANCISCO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A city-owned watershed is teeming with wild
pigs, which splash around in city drinking water, root up the land
and may create a health threat.
   ``They reproduce like crazy, and there are no predators to get
rid of them,'' said Arthur Jenson, Water Department deputy manager.
   The department hopes to trap and sell the animals as pork. The
animals are descendants of farm animals that either escaped or were
abandoned.
   City water managers fear the feral swine could spread livestock
diseases such as cholera and hoof-and-mouth. They are also concerned
the pigs' rooting up the ground on hillsides in search of food may
promote erosion of the watershed area.
   Jenson said about 250 pigs are roaming San Francisco's
37,000-acre watershed containing the Calaveras and San Antonio
reservoirs near the dividing line of Alameda and Santa Clara
counties.
   The city' Public Utilities Commission on Tuesday unanimously
approved the Water Department's plan to conduct a ``swine damage
survey,'' to determine the pig population and study ways to
eliminate, or at least control, the animals.
   But because the state Fish and Game Department lists feral swine
as a game species, the city will need a permit to kill the pigs.
   And under state law, the pigs cannot be killed and disposed of or
sold as dog food, but must be sold for human consumption or given to
a soup kitchen or shelter. ``We are trying to avoid wanton waste,''
said Jim Swanson of the state Department of Fish and Game.
   As a result, the U.S. Department of Agriculture must inspect and
certify the meat.

<TEXT>
   Cuba replaced its interior minister today and
said the new minister will conduct ``a deep analysis'' into how
officials became involved in drug trafficking, the Cuban news agency
Prensa Latina said.
   A brief communique from the Communist Party's political bureau
signed by President Fidel Castro said Gen. Abelardo Colome Ibarra
had been appointed to replace Gen. Jose Abrantes, according to the
agency, monitored in Mexico City.
   The change was made ``considering the great deficiency which
occurred in the main office of the interior ministry in relation to
the conduct of a group of officials who for 2{ years, with impunity
and without being discovered, conducted drug trafficking
operations,'' Prensa Latina quoted the statement as saying.
   Cuba said it arrested nine military officers this month in
connection with drug trafficking. A military tribunal has
recommended a court-martial for one of them, Maj. Gen. Arnaldo
Ochoa, and said he should be executed by a firing squad if convicted.
   The communique said the new minister should ``adopt all measures
that make repetition of the deficiency impossible,'' Prensa Latina
said.
   U.S. officials have questioned the sincerity of Cuba's new war on
drugs, partly because of continued reports of smuggling through Cuba.
   Colome Ibarra, born in 1939, is the third highest military
officer in Cuba after Castro and his brother, Defense Minister Gen.
Raul Castro, Prensa Latina said. Since Dec. 31, 1988, he has been
the only three-star general in the armed forces and holds the
highest military honors the country awards, including the title Hero
of the Revolution, it said.
   He has been a member of the Communist Party's Central Committee
since 1965 and a member of the politburo since 1980, it said.

   Chris Lainis has an eye for trains, such a
good eye that he spotted a problem CSX Transportation says could
have derailed one of its freight trains.
   Chris, 14, said he has been in love with trains since he was 10,
reads all about them in books and magazines, watches them go by,
waves to the crews and monitors their radio calls.
   Last month, as a 133-car coal train rumbled empty past his
favorite viewing spot, he heard a screeching of metal and saw white
smoke coming from under one of the cars. After it passed, Chris
checked the rails and found a groove.
   He called CSX, where yardmaster Bob Ford had heard reports on
trains from Chris before. CSX took Chris' advice and checked the
train and found a worn wheel that could not have gone more than a
dozen miles without cracking.
   ``If it hadn't been for Chris' call, the wheel might not have
been detected until it derailed and caused us a lot of damage and
maybe some injuries,'' Ford said. ``He saved the company a good bit
of money and maybe some lives.''
   CSX awarded Chris a gold watch and a company cap.
   Chris said he just wanted to help.
   ``Trains are like big, huge cars rolling past,'' Chris said.
``They're more detailed. When the crews wave to me, it makes me feel
good inside. I get chill bumps when they say `Hi' from the train.''

   Beware the Batman emblems.
   Opal Marie Nojunas reports that she was hanging a display of
Batman stickers in the window of her florist shop, O'Marie's, when a
bat flew in and began screeching at the black and gold emblems.
   ``It just came in from nowhere. I thought it was going to attack
me,'' Nojunas said.
   ``I was scared to death and started screamin' because I hate
those things,'' she said. ``I can't stand flies, so you can guess
how I acted when I saw this creepy thing.''
   Mary Elizabeth Smith, Nojunas' mother and manager of the store,
said that when her 35-year-old daughter started screaming Wednesday
she thought someone on the street had been killed.
   ``My daughter's a big girl _ about 230 pounds _ and when I saw
her screaming and crying in the window I figured something really
awful had happened.''
   When Smith discovered that it was only a bat, she rushed to
capture it with a flower vase, and called the police. Bats are
sometimes rabid.
   ``It was a real Bat-call,'' said police Sgt. John Haywood.
   Haywood called the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to
Animals, which removed the bat and released it.

   A legislator who often opposes budget requests
in the Oregon Senate found herself happily endorsing the
Legislature's latest spending measure. It was for $2.
   ``This is a proven budget you can vote for,'' Sen. Mae Yih, a
Democrat, said Wednesday.
   The $2 spending bill, approved unanimously, resulted from
lawmakers' disapproval of Gov. Neil Goldschmidt's proposed
allocation of $80,000 for transition expenses when the governor's
office changes hands.
   The proposal of $40,000 for an outgoing governor and $40,000 for
an incoming governor was about 16 percent more than the total spent
when Goldschmidt took office after the 1986 election, Yih said.
   She said the appropriation was trimmed in committee to $1 for an
outgoing governor and $1 for an incoming governor.
   Yih said contingency funds would be found to meet transition
expenses if Goldschmidt isn't re-elected.

<HEAD>Ad Exec Charges In $7.5 Million Suit That He Was Fired For Stuttering</HEAD>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An advertising executive is suing his former
agency for $7.5 million, claiming he was fired because he stutters.
   In the suit filed Wednesday, David C. Lehmkuhl, 42, said he was
dismissed by Ammirati Puris Inc. following four months in the
$125,000-a-year job after being told by the president, ``We can't
have you getting any closer to the clients.''
   Lehmkuhl is seeking $5 million in compensatory damages and $2.5
million in punitive damages.
   The company's president, Edward Vick, said Lehmkuhl, who was
senior vice president and director of media services, was fired
``for not performing.'' He would not comment on Lehmkuhl's
stuttering.
   ``The whole case is so far off base and so without merit, there
is almost no point in getting into a discussion of the specifics,''
Vick said.
   Lehmkuhl's attorney, Barry R. Fischer, said his client, because
of his stutter, often had subordinates make presentations.
   ``But there was no evidence that it held him back in any way,''
Fischer said. ``His career speaks for itself, that he has come a
tremendous way despite his disability.''
   In a 1987 issue of Marketing &amp; Media Decisions, a media trade
journal, Lehmkuhl was described as one of the ad industry's ``most
influential authorities on print media.''
   He worked for 18 years at another agency, N W Ayer Inc., rising
to senior vice president, before being recruited by Vick, who knew
he stuttered, the suit said.
   The suit said that just after Lehmkuhl began at Ammirati Puris,
new-job jitters made his stutter worse. Lehmkuhl signed up for
speech-therapy classes and a public-speaking course, but on March
15, he was fired, the suit said.
   Fischer said his client is now a self-employed consultant making
a fraction of what he used to earn.

<HEAD>Sales of New Home Edge Up, But Expected to Remain Slow</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN D. McCLAIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Sales of new homes rose 2.7 percent in May as
interest rates continued to fall, the government reported Thursday.
But analysts predicted that sales would remain slow because of the
weakening economy.
   Declining interest rates should produce increased home sales in
the next few months, said Michael Carliner, vice president of the
National Association of Home Builders.
   ``However, while interest rates are more favorable now, the
economy is weaker ... so the response will be less than it would
be,'' he said.
   David Berson, chief economist for the Federal National Mortgage
Association, said slower overall ecnomic growth is a negative for
housing.
   ``We're not looking for a surge'' in sales as rates decline,
Berson said. ``The improvement will be slow but steady.''
   The slower economic growth and high interest rates have resulted
from the Federal Reserve campaign against inflation. Although
interest rates have begun to fall as the central bank appears to
ease its grip, the economy continues to moderate.
   Richard Peach, a Mortgage Bankers Association economist, also
blames a satiated market for the slow sales pace.
   ``We've had several years of generally favorable conditions for
home purchases,'' Peach said. ``We don't have the pent-up demand, so
things are kind of sluggish.''
   The Commerce Department said sales of new single-family homes
rose to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 613,000 units in May,
but still trailed the 676,000 rate in 1988 and the 671,000 rate in
1987.
   For the first five months of the year, new home sales were down
7.1 percent from the same period a year earlier.
   The May sales increase followed a 9.1 percent jump in April,
although the figure was revised downward from the 10.9 percent
increase reported earlier. Sales in February and March had dropped
11.3 percent and 11.9 percent respectively after rising 4.6 percent
in January.
   John A. Tuccillo, an economist with the National Association of
Realtors, said part of May's increase was due to first-time buyers
entering the market because of lower interest rates.
   Fixed-interest rates have been dropping since March when they
peaked at 11.22 percent. The rates averaged 10.48 percent the last
week in May and were 10.19 percent last week, according to the
Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp.
   ``We anticipate the interest rate drops that occurred in June
will allow more first-time buyers back in, boosting sales of both
new homes and existing home,'' Tuccillo said.
   May's sales rebound was led by the Northeast, which posted a 12.6
percent increase to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 98,000
units after falling 20.9 percent in April.
   Other increases occurred in the West, up 7.7 percent to a rate of
197,000 units after a 28 percent increase in April, and the South,
up 2.6 percent to a rate of 234,000 homes after a 16.3 percent
increase a month earlier.
   The Midwest had the only decline in sales, off 15.3 percent to an
annual rate of 83,000 units. Sales had been flat in the region in
April after falling 4.9 percent to an annual rate of 98,000 homes in
March.
   The median price of homes sold in May rose $9,000, to $125,000.
The median price means half the homes sold for more and half for
less.
   The average price, which is pulled up by sales of expensive
homes, rose $13,000, to $158,000.

<HEAD>Haughey Fails to Win Re-election as Premier</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DUBLIN, Ireland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Charles Haughey failed to win re-election
as prime minister Thursday, losing a parliamentary vote by 86 votes
to 78.
   The impasse pushes Ireland into tricky constitutional terrain,
and could force State President Patrick Hillery, whose post is
largely ceremonial, to make the next move.
   Haughey needed 83 votes, but mustered only the 78 of his Fianna
Fail party and independent lawmaker Tom Foxe. One legislator
abstained.
   The 166-member Dail, or parliament, voted on other candidates,
but rejected all of them. Alan Dukes, leader of the opposition Fine
Gael party, was defeated 103-61 with one abstention.
   Proceedings halted for two hours. Haughey proposed adjourning
until Monday, but opposition lawmakers demanded he resign as party
leader and make way for a new candidate.
   If no compromise is reached, the president must decide whether to
give Haughey another chance to muster a majority, or _ an option
seen as less likely _ order another election.
   The crisis arose from the June 15 election which Haughey called
in an unsuccessful bid to win an outright majority.
   Haughey had led Ireland with a minority government for more than
two years with tacit support of the Fine Gael and Progressive
Democrat parties.
   He called the election when opinion polls showed him likely to
win a majority. But his ratings slid in the days before the vote,
and he won 77 seats, four fewer than he had held.

<TEXT>
   Shells exploded in Beirut's Moslem and
Christian sectors today as Syrian and Christian gunners fought
despite a call by Arab leaders for a truce. Six people were killed
and 26 wounded, police said.
   The whooshing sound of outgoing rockets and the thuds of
exploding shells rocked the city. Smoke and dust billowed from
several targeted areas.
   By police count, 380 people have been killed and 1,497 wounded
since March 8, when the current round of violence broke out pitting
Christian Army Cmdr. Gen. Michel Aoun's troops against Syrian and
allied militia forces.
   A police spokesman said today's fatalities included two civilians
killed in Moslem west Beirut when a shell crashed on their car. The
two were driving on a seaside boulevard where the Syrians have
several artillery batteries firing on Christian districts.
   A civilian also was killed at west Beirut's Barbir hospital, near
the capital's dividing Green Line, when the facility took several
direct rounds from Christian gunners, said the spokesman who could
not be named in line with standing regulations.
   He said the three other civilians were killed in Christian east
Beirut.
   A hospital official, speaking on condition he not be named, said
the man killed at the hospital had taken refuge there after shelling
started while he was in the street.
   Syrian artillery batteries also shelled the Christian coastline
north of the city to maintain a blockade of the enclave, home to
about 1 million Christians.
   Christian radio stations interrupted their programs to flash
reports of the renewed Syrian shelling and urge the population to
take the needed precautions.
   ``This is the way the Syrians responded to the cease-fire called
by the tripartite Arab committee,'' the Voice of Lebanon radio said.
   The truce was requested Tuesday by King Hassan II of Morocco,
King Fahd of Saudi Arabia and President Chadli Bendjedid of Algeria.
   The three leaders, concluding talks in Oran, Algeria, also called
for lifting the siege of the Christian enclave. It invited Lebanon's
Parliament to meet outside the country to forge a settlement to the
14-year-old civil war.
   An Arab League leaders' summit in Morocco last month asked the
three heads of state to find a settlement to the civil war by
November.
   Christian and Moslem leaders have welcomed the call by the three
Arab leaders for an end to ``violence in all its forms,'' but
differed on whether Lebanon's Parliament should meet overseas.
   Christian parliament members in general have opposed meeting
outside Lebanon, saying if the siege were lifted and crossing
gateways re-opened there would be no need to travel.
   Shafiq Badr was the only Christian deputy who expressed readiness
Wednesday to ``go anywhere to discuss an end to the war.''
   The independent daily paper An-Nahar said Aoun, a Maronite,
expressed reservations over parliament's meeting abroad because it
``contradicts Lebanon's sovereignty.''
   ``However, it is up to the deputies to decide,'' the paper quoted
the 54-year-old general as saying.
   Syria's 40,000 troops in Lebanon besieged the Christian enclave
early in March to retaliate for a blockade imposed by Aoun against
illegal ports run by Syrian-backed militias south of Beirut.
   Aoun and other Christian leaders accuse the Syrians of failing to
achieve a 1976 peacekeeping mandate from the 22-nation Arab League
by siding with the Moslems against the Christians in the Lebanese
civil war.
   Pro-Syrian Moslem and leftist factions say Syrian troops should
remain in Lebanon until the Christians agree to reform the 45-year
political system in a way that guarantees equal shares to the
various sects in running the nation's affairs.

   Syrian and Christian gunners brushed aside
an Arab call to end the Beirut bloodbath and fought ferociously
Thursday. Police said six people were killed and 26 wounded.
   The latest casualties, mostly civilians caught in the cross-fire,
raised the toll to 380 killed and 1,497 wounded in the 15-week
confrontation between Syrian troops and mainly Christian soldiers of
the Lebanese army.
   A police spokesman said victims included two civilians killed in
Moslem west Beirut when a 155mm shell crashed on their car.
   Another civilian was killed at west Beirut's Barbir Hospital,
which took several direct hits from Christian gunners, said the
spokesman, who cannot be identified under standing regulations.
   He said the other three civilians were killed in Christian east
Beirut.
   Barbir Hospital's two upper floors could be seen burning from a
distance.
   A hospital official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the
man killed there took refuge at the hospital after shelling started.
   None of the patients and medical staff were hurt, the official
said. They evacuated to the basement and an underground shelter.
   Barbir, one of four major medical centers in the Moslem sector,
is near the Green Line that divides Lebanon's capital into Christian
and Moslem sectors.
   The sound of exploding shells rocked Beirut around noon. Smoke
and dust billowed from stricken targets and ambulance sirens wailed.
Panicking motorists abandoned their cars and took refuge in building
entrances. Shopkeepers lowered their shutters.
   Parents rushed to the few open schools to bring children home.
Some schools reopened last week when the security situation appeared
to improve.
   The latest fighting erupted March 8, two days after Christian
leader Gen. Michel Aoun blockaded illegal ports run by Syrian-backed
militias south of Beirut.
   Retaliating Lebanese Druse militiamen started to besiege the
310-square-mile Christian enclave north of Beirut that is home to
about 1 million people. That siege has been enforced by Syrian
troops in Lebanon under an Arab League peacekeeping mandate.
   ``This is the way the Syrians responded to the cease-fire called
by the tripartite Arab committee,'' the Christian Voice of Lebanon
radio complained.
   The Arab League has given its committee _ comprising Algerian
President Chadli Bendjedid, King Hassan II of Morocco and Saudi
Arabia's King Fahd _ until November to negotiate a settlement in
Lebanon.
   On Tuesday, the committee repeated calls for a cease-fire and a
lifting of port blockades.
   It said once the cease-fire is consolidated, it will invite
Lebanon's parliament to meet outside the country to negotiate a new
power-sharing formula and end the 14-year conflict between
Christians and Moslems.
   Leaders of both sides welcomed the peace call, but the Christians
do not want to meet abroad.
   Christian legislators say that if Syria lifts the siege, they
could meet at Beirut's mid-city parliament building.
   The leftist daily paper As-Safir quoted Moslem parliament speaker
Hussein Husseini as calling on deputies to ``carry out your duty and
cooperate with the tripartite Arab committee.''

   Police today arrested a suspect in the
poisoning of Austin's centuries-old Treaty Oak.
   No details were immediately available. Police scheduled a news
conference to discuss the arrest of the person suspected of applying
the potent herbicide that is making the 50-foot oak's leaves turn
brown and fall off.
   Legend has it Stephen F. Austin, the father of Texas, signed a
treaty with the Indians under the tree's branches, although
historians give little credence to the story. Over the years, people
have proposed marriage under its boughs.
   The attack on the venerable oak saddened many, and offerings
ranging from get-well cards and flowers to crystals and chicken soup
have been left at the ailing tree, which has a 127-foot limb spread
and is 52.5 inches in diameter at chest height.
   The vandal could be charged with criminal mischief, punishable by
up to 20 years in prison.
   The Austin American-Statesman, citing unidentified sources,
reported earlier that a man is suspected of poisoning the tree in an
attempt to invoke a magic spell.
   The circle of herbicide poured next to the tree may be a symbol
of unrequited love, the newspaper said.
   It was not immediately known if the man cited in the report was
the one under arrest.
   Du Pont Co., which produces the herbicide, Velpar, at a plant in
La Porte, put up a $10,000 reward for the vandal's conviction. The
Texas Forestry Association added $1,000.

<TEXT>
   Secretary of State James A. Baker III,
disapproving of moves in Congress for further sanctions against
China, said Thursday that U.S. foreign policy cannot be guided
entirely by human rights considerations.
   He urged Congress to work out a compromise with the White House
that would preserve President Bush's flexibility in framing a U.S.
response to the crackdown on pro-democracy forces and permit the
United States to speak with one voice on the subject.
   Baker said Bush, who headed the U.S. liaison office in Beijing
from 1974 to 1975, knows as much about China as any elected
official. ``We do recognize the desire of elected officials to speak
to this and to vote on this issue,'' Baker said at a White House
news conference.
   ``But we really and firmly believe that the leadership in this
instance must come from the executive branch and it should come from
the president of the United States as commander-in-chief and as one
who is thoroughly and completely versed in the affairs of China.''
   Therefore, Baker said, the Bush administration could not endorse
the package of sanctions being put together on Capitol Hill to
register congressional concern over a wave of arrests and executions
and to try to moderate the Chinese leadership.
   Within hours of his comments, the House voted 418-0 for the
package, which endorses previous Bush moves but would add suspension
of trade and development programs, a ban on the sale of police
equipment and a limit on transfer of high-technology and nuclear
materials or components.
   The House provision is part of a foreign aid bill that has not
yet been debated in the Senate.
   Even though Bush and Baker have expressed outrage over
developments in China, including the attack by the military on
students in Tiananmen Square June 3-4, several members of Congress
have exhorted them to take stronger action and make more damning
statements.
   But Baker said ``we will not use inflammatory rhetoric.''
   He said U.S.-Chinese relations served a variety of purposes and
should not be jettisoned as a response to the crackdown.
   ``The principle of human rights has to be a major foundation
principle for our foreign policy,'' Baker said. ``It has been, it
continues to be, and in my view it will continue to be well into the
future. That is a very, very important principle.''
   But, he said, ``it is not the only principle which determines our
foreign policy. And it is not, and cannot be, the sole and only
principle which determines the extent and scope and degree of the
response of the United States in a situation such as this.
   ``When we say the relationship is important, and that we ought to
try and preserve the relationship, we do not suggest that we do so
at all cost. And we are not suggesting that it is important solely
from an economic basis.
   ``It is important economically, yes, but it is important as well
from a geopolitical and geostrategic standpoint.''
   Baker did not elaborate on the point. But U.S. relations with the
Communist government in Beijing, built up over the last two dozen
years, has sometimes been used as leverage in dealing with the
Soviet Union.
   The sanctions imposed by Bush suspended military sales to China
and prohibited visits by senior U.S. military and civilian officials.
   The congressional package, an amendment to a two-year $23 billion
foreign aid bill, would put these executive actions into law,
suspend trade and development programs, ban the sale of
police-related weapons and limit transfer of high technology and
nuclear materials or components.
   The amendment also included some harsh rhetoric condemning the
``unprovoked, brutal and indiscriminate assault'' on peaceful
demonstrators that left at least 700 dead.

   Defense Secretary Dick Cheney said today he was
``generally pleased'' with the House Armed Services Committee's
action on the defense budget, but he questioned Congress' desire to
cut spending without canceling weapons systems.
   The House panel on Wednesday restored funds for the Marine Corps
V-22 Osprey aircraft and F-14D Tomcat fighter _ two programs Cheney
wants to eliminate. Against the advice of its chairman, the
Democratic-controlled committee rejected an amendment to accept
Cheney's $64 billion procurement budget without additions or
deletions.
   Cheney, in a statement released at the Pentagon, said he was
``generally pleased'' with the committee's decision. But he added:
``The problem is, that while Congress wants to cut defense spending,
some don't want to cancel any systems or close any bases.''
   ``We must not preserve the fiction that we can keep all the
weapons and bases everyone wants and still spend less money,'' he
said.
   Pentagon spokesman Pete Williams said Cheney ``clearly wished''
the Armed Services Committee had accepted the budget proposal
without change ``but understands that's the way the process works.''
   Republicans on the panel warned that restoring funds for the V-22
and F-14D by amending Cheney's proposal for the fiscal year starting
Oct. 1 will lead to chaos on the House floor when the legislation is
debated.
   But Democrats who changed the package and also cut funds for the
B-2 stealth bomber said their efforts indicate they won't ``roll
over and play dead.''
   By virtue of a 26-26 tie _ the result of last-minute ``no'' votes
from Reps. Patricia Schroeder, D-Colo., and Ron Dellums, D-Calif. _
the committee defeated a proposal to accept Cheney's procurement
budget without changes.
   This let the panel approve 44-5 a budget that includes funds for
the Osprey and Tomcat planes.
   The bill goes to the full House. The overall defense budget is
$295 billion.
   Under the individual amendments approved earlier by the panel,
the Bell-Boeing Osprey, which is built in Fort Worth, Texas, would
receive $157 million in fiscal 1990 beginning Oct. 1.
   The Tomcat, manufactured by Grumman Corp., on Long Island, would
get about $1 billion.
   The National Guard and reserves would receive about $1 billion,
half of which had been earmarked for the B-2 bomber while the other
half had been appropriated for spare parts.
   Rep. Les Aspin, D-Wis., chairman of the House Armed Services
panel, urged his colleagues to accept Cheney's procurement budget
without revision.
   Rep. Herbert Bateman, R-Va., added that breaking Cheney's plan
``breaks a logjam that will bring total chaos.''
   But others on the panel were not deterred.
   Rep. Marvin Leath, D-Texas, said that after 11 years of hard work
he will not ``roll over and play dead.''
   Dellums introduced an amendment to cancel the B-2 bomber, which
at $500 million to $650 million each is considered the most
expensive plane in history.
   ``It's time to cut ... loose from the monument to misallocated
money,'' Dellums argued. ``We've obligated ourselves to $22 billion
without knowing whether this plane can fly.''
   Rep. John Kasich, R-Ohio, who backed the amendment, said that
every week the Air Force changes the mission for the radar-evading
plane.
   But Aspin argued that a vote on the B-2 will take place on the
House floor and ``total termination at this point is wrong.''
   Dellums' amendment lost 36-16, but a handful of members responded
``no for now,'' indicating that when the question comes up on the
House floor they may oppose funds for the costly radar-evading plane.
   The panel also rejected Dellums' amendment to delete $164 million
requested by the Pentagon to move 50 MX missiles from silos to
railroad cars.
   The panel did approve language that transferred money from B-2
purchasing to research and development on the stealth bomber. A day
earlier, the panel rejected an amendment to restore $351 million for
the bomber that the research and development subcommittee voted to
spend on the Osprey.
   That vote left $2.7 billion in purchasing funds for the B-2 and
cut the proposed $1.8 billion for research and development to about
$1.5 billion.
   The budget vote came one day after the panel slashed $1.1 billion
from Star Wars, formally known as the Strategic Defense Initiative.
By voice vote, the committee approved a $3.5 billion budget for SDI,
considerably less than the $4.6 billion Bush proposed for the
program.

   Zaire President Mobutu Sese Seko and President
Bush promised closer economic ties between the two nations after two
hours of private talks today at the White House.
   Bush, calling Mobutu ``one of our most valued friends'' in
Africa, said he and the African leader exchanged paperwork for a
treaty to encourage greater U.S. investment there.
   He also said the United States supports Zaire's efforts to win
new loans from the International Monetary Fund and praised its
commitment to reform its economy.
   In a departure ceremony outside the White House, Bush also
praised Mobutu for his role in bringing about the recent cease-fire
in the bordering nation of Angola, where civil war has raged for 14
years.
   Bush said that ``the total withdrawal of Cuban troops from
Angola'' remained a joint U.S.-Zaire goal.
   Mobutu, the first African head-of-state invited by Bush to the
White House, thanked the president for giving U.S. support to
efforts to strengthen his nation's economy.
   Speaking in French, Mobutu also said he told Bush of recent
human-rights improvements in Zaire.
   Mobutu has long supported U.S. policy goals in Africa while
compiling a human rights record widely regarded as one of the worst
on the continent.
   ``Zaire can be ranked among those countries which observe the
rule of law, not to be confused or mistaken with any incidental
mishaps that are attributable to an administration or to
individuals,'' Mobutu said.
   The two leaders made their formal remarks in public at the end of
their two-hour meeting and lunch.
   Mobutu won plaudits from U.S. diplomats last week for the key
role he played in helping arrange the Angolan cease-fire, which was
agreed upon at an 18-nation African summit meeting hosted by Mobutu.
   Mobutu brushed aside questions Wednesday about his human rights
performance, saying he has no reason to repress any Zairean because
``100 percent'' of his subjects support him.
   The United States and Zaire have enjoyed close ties for most of
the 24 years Mobutu has ruled his country. Zaire has received
substantial U.S. assistance over the years while serving as a
transit point for U.S. military supplies destined for anti-communist
rebels in neighboring Angola.
   But concern on Capitol Hill over the rights situation in Zaire is
expected to lead to a cut in the administration's Zaire military aid
request from $9 million to $3 million in fiscal 1990. Mobutu's
schedule today included an afternoon meeting with members of the
House Foreign Affairs Committee.
   Freedom House, a New York-based group which promotes democracy
around the world, ranks Zaire with the worst human rights violators
in Africa.
   The annual State Department human rights report, released in
February, said that among the human rights abuses in Zaire are
torture and other forms of physical mistreatment of detainees.
   State Department deputy spokesman Richard Boucher said Wednesday
that Mobutu recently has taken a number of steps to correct abuses.
He added, however, that ``human rights problems and deficiencies are
part of our ongoing dialogue with Zaire.''
   There also have been allegations about widespread corruption in
Zaire. A State Department document cited in a New York Times article
two years ago estimated Mobutu's wealth at more than $5 billion.
   Among Mobutu's assets are a number of castles and palaces in
Zaire and in Europe.

   Peter Secchia, dubbed the ``ambassador of dirty
words'' by the Italian press, arrived in Rome on Thursday to take up
the U.S. ambassador's post, and he defended his ability to handle it.
   U.S. Senate confirmation of his nomination was blocked for a
month by a dispute over the nomination process of President Bush's
administration, a controversy unrelated to Secchia's qualifications.
But some senators also expressed concern about Secchia's tendency to
make vulgar remarks.
   Secchia was confirmed last week by the Senate.
   ``I'm delighted to be here at last,'' said Secchia's wife, Joan,
when the ambassador presented his family to journalists.
   ``La famiglia,'' (the family), Secchia said in Italian, gesturing
to his wife, two sons and one of his two daughters.
   Secchia, a Michigan businessman and a leading Bush backer in the
1988 presidential campaign, is the grandson of Italian immigrants.
   He was asked if he was confident he could successfully be the
chief U.S. diplomat in Italy with the negative coverage of his
nomination in the Italian press.
   Among the widely reported incidents was one in which Secchia
reportedly called a female delegate to the 1988 Republican National
Convention a ``bitch'' in front of other party members. He has
repeatedly said he was misquoted.
   ``I'm very confident I can carry out the role my president has
given me. I've done it before,'' Secchia said.
   He said of reports about him in the Italian press, ``I'm a pretty
strong person. I can handle that,'' adding ``I'm very proud of my
accomplishments.''
   Asked again about questions over whether he was fit to serve in
the post, he replied, ``That's behind me. I'm not here to win the
Italian press,'' although he promised the reporters he would meet
with them regularly.
   Secchia announced that as of late July, Italian tourists and
business people will be able to enter the United States without a
visa. Bush announced the change in a visit to Rome in May but no
date had been announced when it would go into effect.

<TEXT>
   The leader of the governing
National Party said today the party's plan to eventually give blacks
a direct vote in national affairs will end South Africa's isolation.
   Anti-apartheid activists and conservatives reacted with
skepticism to the proposal, which envisions blacks having a vote in
national affairs within five years. Anglican Archbishop Desmond
Tutu, who won the 1984 Nobel Peace Prize for his fight against
apartheid, rejected the plan outright.
   The plan is part of the party's new election platform, which also
holds out the possibility of giving the black majority a voice in
writing a new constitution.
   The party held a one-day congress in Pretoria today and accepted
the platform. No vote was held _ the congress simply adjourned with
no delegates voicing objections to the plan.
   Party leader F.W. de Klerk, designated to replace retiring
President P.W. Botha after the Sept. 6 parliamentary elections,
opened the meeting by saying the party could lead the country back
into the international community, which has condemned South Africa's
system of racial separation.
   ``Our cause is just and the doors must open. We will not have to
go crawling back, we will walk in proudly and with our heads high,''
said de Klerk, who wept when the 1,500 delegates greeted him with a
standing ovation in Pretoria City Hall.
   A less enthusiastic ovation followed his brief tribute to Botha,
who did not attend the meeting. The two have had strained relations
since March, when party leaders indicated they wanted Botha to
resign so de Klerk could take over.
   An editorial in the anti-apartheid Cape Times of Cape Town
complained that the proposal provided for a bill of rights only as a
``possible option'' and failed to say how blacks would be
incorporated into the government.
   ``Whatever its vote-winning merits for the NP, as a plan to
resolve the South African crisis it is much too tentative,'' the
newspaper said.
   Tutu said the platform it was designed to make apartheid more
comfortable rather than dismantle it.
   ``We are not interested in reform. We want to see apartheid
abolished,'' Tutue said today in Hilleroed, Denmark, where he was
attending a festival of the Danish national church.
   Ferdi Hartzenberg, deputy leader of the pro-apartheid
Conservative Party, said the plan would lead to majority rule by
South Africa's 28 million blacks and deprive the 5 million whites of
influence in the writing of a new constitution.
   Political analysts say the Conservative Party may gain some seats
in the national legislature as a result of the National Party reform
proposals.
   South Africa's apartheid system denies blacks a voice in
government and relegates them to separate housing, schools and
health care facilities. Whites also control the nation's economy.
   Many foreign governments have imposed economic sanctions and
other limitations on dealing with South Africa in efforts to force
an end to apartheid.
   Much of the National Party's platform represents a softening of
policies designed to maintain white control, and is seen as
reflecting the views of de Klerk.
   The five-year program includes removal of criminal penalties for
residential apartheid violations, more government subsidies for
multiracial schools, removal of race as the major criterion for
identifying political groups, a bill of rights, and negotiating a
new constitution with black leaders.
   In London, a leader of the outlawed African National Congress
guerrilla group called the platform an advance, but from a wrong
position.
   ``It's a step forward to the extent that the National Party
recognizes that South Africa cannot be ruled on the basis of
exclusive power for the white minority,'' Thabo Mbeki, secretary for
international affairs, said Wednesday en route to the ANC's base in
Lusaka, Zambia.
   ``But the position is wrong because it continues to define people
as black and white and not as the people of South Africa. The period
of transition must emerge from negotiations.''
   Clive Derby-Lewis, spokesman for the Conservative Party, likened
the plan to ``the sales talk of an unscrupulous car dealer'' and
said the National Party was hiding plans to go further in reducing
racial laws.
   ``It is completely different from what they really intend to do.
It is real skulduggery,'' he said in a telephone interview. ``It
will generate further distrust in the Nationalists by the
electorate.''
   Beeld, the leading Afrikaans-language newspaper, pro-government
but generally moderate in its views, said the party's plan ``has the
potential to create a new South Africa'' if carried out with vigor.

<HEAD>Army Says Chemical Weapons Residue Should Be Buried in U.S. Landfills</HEAD>

   The non-toxic waste produced when chemical
weapons stored on a Pacific island are destroyed should be buried in
U.S. landfills, the Army said Thursday.
   The Army had hoped to dump some of the waste from Johnston Atoll
into the ocean, but said in a statement that it decided against
asking Congress for an exception to a law that bans such disposal.
   Landfills that might be used in the project weren't named in
Thursday's environmental impact study. Sites won't be known until
the project is approved and bids solicited from private companies,
said Army spokesman Lt. Col. John Chapla.
   The disposal cannot proceed until public comments are reviewed
and the Army's impact statement approved.
   The impact study deals with the first part of a long-term program
to destroy thousands of rounds of aging chemical weapons stored at
various Army depots.
   The Johnston Atoll depot was used by the Army to test and develop
an incineration process to destroy the weapons. The environmental
impact studies for that depot are farther along than for those
inside the United States.
   The incineration process will destroy the toxic chemical gases.
However, it produces three types of waste: liquid brine; solid waste
that can be sold for scrap; and solid waste without value.
   The Army said the liquid brine should be dried and shipped to
landfills in the United States.
   ``This alternative will be used unless other considerations _
cost, logistics impact or political factors _ make it not viable,''
the Army said. ``No significant adverse environmental impacts are
expected.''
   If the plan isn't approved, the brine likely would be stored in
drums on the island.
   The Army refuses to disclose the size of its chemical stockpile.
However, published estimates range from 25,000 tons to 40,000 tons.
   The Army's existing chemical stocks average more than 25 years
old. Within the United States, they are stored at depots in Utah,
Alabama, Maryland, Indiana, Kentucky, Oregon, Colorado and Arkansas.
   Congress, in approving the production of new chemical weapons
during the Reagan administration, specified the Army would have to
proceed simultaneously with the destruction of existing stocks.

   Zsuzsa Polgar of Hungary moved into
second place behind her top-ranked sister, Judit, in the new women's
chess rankings released Thursday by the International Chess
Federation.
   In the men's category, world champion Garri Kasparov maintained
his lead over fellow Soviet Anatoly Karpov. Vassily Ivanchuk, a
20-year-old Soviet among the youngest in the world's top 100
players, shot from sixth to third place, ahead of Britain's Nigel
Short and Viktor Korchnoi of Switzerland.
   Judit Polgar, who at 13 is the youngest leader ever, stayed first
in the women's list as her older sister, Zsuzsa, moved up one spot
to overtake Maya Chiburdanidze of the Soviet Union. Pia Cramling of
Sweden broke a tie with Nana Ioseliani of the Soviet Union to take
undisputed fourth place.

<HEAD>House Panel Votes to Ban Oil Exploration in Alaskan Bay, Elsewhere</HEAD>
<TEXT>

</TEXT>
<NOTE>Associated Press Writer</NOTE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The House Appropriations Committee, citing
concerns about a possible oil spill, approved legislation today
imposing a year-long moratorium on oil or gas exploration in
Alaska's Bristol Bay, one of the nation's premier fishing areas.
   The legislation also would extend existing prohibitions against
oil or gas exploration along vast stretches off the coasts of
California, Florida and New England, and impose a new moratorium on
leases along a coastal stretch from Rhode Island to Maryland.
   The curbs, which would deal a sharp blow to the petroleum
industry if they prevail in final legislation, were included in an
$11.6 billion fiscal 1990 appropriation bill for the Interior
Department, which oversees the leasing of offshore oil exporation
rights.
   It prohibits Interior from using any funds during the fiscal year
beginning Oct. 1 on oil leases in Bristol Bay.
   An amendment that would have allowed exploration to proceed in
the bay off southwestern Alaska was defeated by a vote of 29-22. Its
sponsor, Rep. Ralph Regula, R-Ohio, argued development of the bay's
oil reserves is badly needed to meet the country's energy needs.
   But Rep. Sydney Yates, D-Ill., chairman of the appropriations
subcommittee that had recommended the moratorium, cited the
devastation left by the oil spill from the tanker Exxon Valdez in
Alaska's Prince William Sound last March 24.
   ``We've seen what's happened in Prince William Sound,'' Yates
declared and began reciting details of the environmental and
economic chaos left by the spill. He said the $1 billion fishing
industry in Bristol Bay is ``is probably 50 times as significant.''
   The Alaska state government has said the fishing industry in
Bristol Bay could be even more vulnerable to a major oil spill as in
the area of Prince William Sound. The oil from Bristol Bay would
likely be transported by tanker.
   In Juneau, Alaska Gov. Steve Cowper called the committee action
clear evidence that ``our views are being heard in Washington.'' The
Alaska congressional delegation had sought the moratorium on Bristol
Bay exploration.
   The Interior Department last year sold exploratory leases for a
half-dozen sites in Bristol Bay for $95 million. The legislation
would call for repurchasing those leases.
   In addition to the curbs on oil exploration in Bristol Bay, the
legislation also calls for a moratorium on exploration in three
areas off the California coast; in the Gulf of Mexico off the
southern Florida coast; in the Georges Banks off the New England
coast, and along a coastal buffer from Rhode Island to southern
Maryland.
   The Bush administration already has postponed issuing leases in
southern and northern California, pending further environmental
review. The House bill would extend the moratorium to leases off the
central California coast as well. The leases off southern Florida
also have been put on hold by the administration.
   A moratorium also has been in effect previously for the leases in
the Georges Bank.

<HEAD>Western Governors Stand Firm on Nuclear Waste</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: RECASTS throughout to ADD governors refusing to give ground
on accepting nuclear waste; No pickup.</HEAD>

   Three Western governors at odds with
Washington over disposal of nuclear waste in their states stood
their ground despite assurances from Energy Secretary James Watkins
that the government is serious about safety.
   Gov. Garrey Carruthers said New Mexico won't accept any
radioactive waste until the Energy Department meets all commitments
to the state; Gov. Cecil Andrus said Idaho won't take any more
shipments after August, and Colorado Gov. Roy Romer said he will
shut down the Rocky Flats weapons plant when it reaches its storage
capacity.
   During a meeting with the governors on Wednesday, the secretary
said the plutonium-waste storage facility built a third of a mile
underground near here won't open until the government shows it can
safely transport and bury nuclear waste.
   The department's Waste Isolation Pilot Plant is designed for
permanent storage of radioactive waste created by military projects.
The waste would be kept 2,150 feet below ground in ancient salt beds
26 miles southeast of here.
   ``We will open WIPP, but we will open it when it's ready,''
Watkins said.
   The WIPP was supposed to open last October, but questions about
the long-term safety of the salt beds and how waste is to be
transported to it have delayed the opening. Watkins has said he
expects to open the plant next year but has not given a target date.
   With Rocky Flats expected to run out of storage space by early
next year _ and the three Western governors standing firm _ the
government could find itself without a place to store nuclear waste,
a stalemate that federal officials said could endanger maintenance
of the nation's nuclear arsenal.
   ``The president asked me to come into this job to clean up the
mess dealing with the production reactors, the waste facilities, so
this nation can stand tall again on the peace-through-strength
concept, which WIPP is all about,'' Watkins said.
   Watkins said he couldn't speculate on where waste would be stored
if Rocky Flats became filled. But he said it is unlikely Idaho,
Colorado or New Mexico would be used for any type of interim storage
facility.
   After the meeting, the governors said they were pleased with
Watkins' take-charge attitude.
   ``There is a new breeze blowing across Eddy County and across the
United States with respect to the Department of Energy,'' Carruthers
said. ``I like the fact the secretary has committed to us that he
will operate at his pace _ a pace that he determines is safe.''
   But none of the governors was willing to budge on accepting more
waste.
   Andrus said Idaho, as planned, will accept four boxcars of waste
from Rocky Flats in August and then close its border. ``Idaho's
position is not going to change,'' he said.
   Romer said Rocky Flats may not expand its storage capacity _
``and when we reach the limit, we will close Rocky Flats.''
   Carruthers said, ``The state of New Mexico believes WIPP is not
yet ready to accept waste, and we will resist all efforts to open
until such time as DOE commitments to New Mexico are met.'' Those
commitments include compensation for road improvements and
assurances on safety and environmental protection.

   By the hundreds they waited in line, some all
night long, for the abortion decision. What they got, those few who
actually made it into the Supreme Court Thursday, were decisions
affecting Indian reservations and Tupperware sales.
   People who have waited for a space shot that eventually is
postponed would know how that feels.
   Disappointing is too weak a word. Frustrating doesn't make it.
Neither does thwarted, letdown or dissatisfied. Thursday's failure
to deliver a decision in the abortion case was like a countdown to
nothing. A scrub. No go.
   Molly Yard, president of the National Organization of Women
likened the wait to a Chinese water torture.
   ``I have to say that I think in my fantasizing that there must be
an argument going on,'' she said. ``We've always believed that
Sandra Day O'Connor was the swing vote, and I hope and pray that she
will join with our four friends on the Supreme Court who are for the
right of a woman to control her reproductive life under the privacy
interpretation of the Constitution.''
   Randall Terry, national director of Operation Rescue said it was
``a little frustrating to keep coming again and again and again and
again,'' and added: ``Frankly, I just think they want to get the
decision and get out of town. I mean, if I was a Supreme Court
justice, I would throw the decision off the airplane as I was
leaving the country.''
   Olivia Gans, director of Victims of Abortion, a right-to-life
group, acknowledged it was hard to wait ``but we're optimistic.''
   When the word came out that the only decisions Thursday were in
the cookware and Indian reservation cases, the cameras and
microphones were dismantled, but the demonstrators got into a little
dialogue of their own.
   ``Not the church, not the state, women must decide our fate,''
chanted the pro-choice side.
   ``What about the babies' fate?'' was a chant in response.
   Two male demonstrators faced off:
   ``Do you have the right to decide the choice of someone else?''
   ``No, neither does the woman. She doesn't have the right to. ...''
   ``But it's her body.''
   ``Oh, come on, man, a fetus is not a woman's body.''
   ``You can't tell her what to do with her body.''
   ``Then she can't tell the baby that baby's got no right to live.''
   ``It's her body and you don't have the right to make that choice
for her.''
   ``A fetus is not her body.''
   ``It's inside her body.''
   ``A tapeworm's inside you. Does that make a tapeworm your body?''
   A young woman, holding up a placard of the National Organization
of Women, told an older woman ``I don't believe it is human until it
is born.'' The response: ``You don't believe it is human til it is
born? You had better study science, honey.''
   Of the line of people stretching around one side of the building,
only about 50 got in for the brief session. First in line was
Michael Carrier, a student at Yale University, who said he had
waited since 6:30 p.m. Wednesday.
   ``I'm here because I feel this is such an important decision,''
Carrier said. ``I just had to be here when it came down.''
   In front of the meditative female statue on one side of the
entrance stairs of the Supreme Court, the forces opposing abortion
were arrayed, holding yellow banners with black letters: ``The Child
Killing Must Be Stopped.''
   On the right, in front of the vigilant male statue that typifies
execution of the laws were the pro-choice demonstrators, holding
purple banners with white letters: ``Keep Abortion Legal.''
   A kneeling, bearded man in the robes of a monk said his rosary
while frowning at pro-choice placards. One small girl held a placard
larger than herself: ``My Mother Chose Life,'' another's read ``Why
Do My Future Playmates Have to Die?'' There were the usual people
displaying large color photographs of bleeding fetuses, a staple of
anti-abortion demonstrations.
   In space lingo, a launch scrub is followed by a turnaround _
readying the ship for its next try. For the court, the
demonstrators, the cameramen and the tourists caught up in a
headline making activity on a fine summer day, the turnaround aims
for another try on Monday.

<HEAD>Police Begin Search for Convicted Nazi Murderer Who Escaped</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GEORGE BOEHMER</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>FRANKFURT, West Germany (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Authorities have begun an
international manhunt for a convicted Nazi murderer who fled to
avoid arrest, a state prosecutor said Thursday.
   Wuppertal prosecutor Friedhelm Gabriel did not rule out the
possibility that an underground group may have aided the escape of
former Nazi death camp guard Gottfried Weise.
   Weise, 69, was convicted Jan. 28, 1988, of killing at least five
prisoners in 1944 at the Auschwitz concentration camp. Weise
disappeared after a federal court upheld his conviction and life
sentence.
   Gabriel said Weise was allowed to remain at his home near
Wuppertal pending appeal to care for his sick wife after officials
confiscated his passport and Weise mortgaged his house to post a
$150,000 bond.
   But when police went to arrest him on April 20 to begin serving
his prison term, Weise had disappeared.
   Asked about speculation that an underground organization similar
to one described in Frederick Forsyth's 1972 novel, ``The Odessa
File,'' could have helped Weise escape, Gabriel said: ``There are
suspicions that groups like Odessa exist, but we don't have concrete
evidence.''
   ``Such an organization would have to be very secretive,'' Gabrial
said in an interview from Wuppertal, about 210 miles northwest of
Frankfurt.
   The novel is about a ruthless group of Nazi sympathizers who help
smuggle war criminals to safety in South America and other parts of
the world.
   ``But Weise had to have some sort of help, he had to get new
identity papers somewhere, because we have his passport. He also
doesn't have much money; he was on a pension,'' Gabriel said.
   He said Weise's wife, Ursula, 62, subsequently disappeared.
   ``She suddenly left, we think on June 22, and her relatives
refuse to tell us where she's gone. We believe she's trying to join
her husband,'' the prosecutor said.
   Police issued an international arrest warrant for Weise.
   Alfred Streim, who runs the federal Nazi Document Center in
Ludwigsburg, said it was possible Weise was helped to escape ``but
there has never been proof that an Odessa-type organization exists.''
   Streim's office is responsible for tracking fugitive war
criminals in West Germany.
   ``There were some people in Italy who helped in escapes after the
war, but they were not as organized as Odessa,'' Streim said.
   During Weise's 15-month trial he became known as the ``William
Tell of Auschwitz'' when witnesses testified that he killed an
8-year-old boy and a 17-year-old girl by forcing them to balance tin
cans on their heads, which he used for target practice.
   He was convicted in their deaths and of killing two male
prisoners who tried to escape by hiding in a supply truck. Weise
also was convicted of killing an inmate because he responded too
slowly to orders.

<HEAD>EDS: Top 7 grafs new with speech. Picks up 6th graf pvs, Bush's proposals.</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Bush promised today that he will
``work with Congress'' toward attaining a pay raise for members and
top federal officials, but he stopped short of offering a specific
proposal.
   In a speech centered on campaign finance proposals to ``truly
clean up the system,'' Bush also proposed new restrictions on
political action committees and curtailing some advantages enjoyed
by incumbent members of Congress.
   Regarding a pay raise, which members rejected earlier this year
amid public outrage, Bush said, ``I will also work with Congress on
the development of details for increasing the pay of those in
Congress as well as other senior employees of the executive branch.''
   He said he would also send Congress separate legislation to ban
honoraria members earn for outside speaking engagements and ``to
address certain aspects of compenstation for federal officials,''
including a 25 percent pay increase for judges that he endorsed
previously.
   Campaign finance reform was the focus of Bush's speech before a
group of congressional interns.
   The president said his proposals were designed to loosen ``the
grip of special interests'' in politics and strengthen the role of
the political parties, which he called ``the indispensable
organizers of democracy.''
   Several of his proposals would have the effect of harming
Democrats the most since they hold the majority in Congress and
control most statehouses, which have the power to draw political
district lines.
   Bush's proposals would:
   _Abolish political action committees that are connected to
corporations, unions or trade groups, while allowing so-called
ideological PACs that operate independently of any such organization.
   _Reduce the per-candidate contribution limit for the remaining
PACs from the current $5,000 to $2,500.
   _More than double the amount of money political parties are
allowed to give to each congressional candidate. For Senate races,
the amount currently ranges from $92,000 to about $1.5 million,
depending on state population.
   _Ban carrying over campaign funds from one election to the next.
That would require congressional candidates to return leftover funds
to the contributors or give the money to the political parties or
the government.
   _Curtail gerrymandering methods of drawing political district
lines to benefit one political party or group over another. The
districts would have to be drawn according to geographical and
community boundaries, said a senior administration official, who
acknowledged litigation would be the only way to enforce such laws.
   _Require full disclosure of so-called ``soft money''
contributions to political parties. Soft money refers generally to
corporate and labor donations that are barred in federal campaigns.
Such money often takes a back channel path into federal campaigns
when the funds are contributed to political parties, which then help
the candidates.
   _Require disclosure by unions, corporations and trade
associations of any money they spend for election activity, such as
voter registration drives.
   _Restrict franking privileges, which allow members of Congress to
send mail to their constituents free. Blanket constituency mailings,
such as the curent practice of sending newsletters, would be banned.
   A group of GOP congressional leaders discussed the proposals with
Bush at the White House today and later praised him for taking a
leadership role on the issue.
   Although Congress has consistently squelched previous efforts to
restrict PACS and make other campaign reforms, Rep. Guy Vander Jagt,
R-Mich, said that will change because there exists in the country
``a growing prairie fire where people are going to rise up and say
we'd like these elections back in our hands.''
   Administration officials sought to emphasize the campaign reform
proposals and downplay the pay-hike issue, which covers ground the
president has trod before.
   Bush endorsed a 51 percent salary increase for Congress,
executive branch officials and judges in January at his first news
conference, but Congress squelched the pay hike under a firestorm of
criticism in February.
   In April, Bush endorsed a 25 percent pay increase for federal
judges, a measure still pending in Congress. He has said he wanted
to separate the question of congressional pay hikes from raises for
judges and executive branch officials, because the politically
sensitive Congress is skittish about raising its own pay.
   By all accounts, there is little sentiment on Capitol Hill for
delving into the pay raise-honoraria flap again.
   On the election law reform, Bush has been consulting with a
variety of experts and met this week with advocacy groups that have
long criticized the current system as allowing special interest
groups to buy influence through a variety of backdoor campaign
contribution methods.
   Bush won their praise for his direction, but they said he did not
appear willing to take the dramatic steps they think will solve the
problem.
   Ellen Miller, who heads the non-profit Center For Responsive
Politics, said that disclosing contributions and expenditures of
soft money will shed light on the sources but will not eliminate the
practice.
   Fred Wertheimer, president of the lobby group Common Cause, said
abolishing corporate and union PACs but allowing non-connected PACs
would merely allow people to reorganize PACs.

<HEAD>China Criticizes EEC for Denouncing Crackdown</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   China on Thursday said the European Economic
Community was presumptuous in denouncing the suppression of the
pro-democracy movement and that its actions could harm relations
with Beijing.
   ``Before finding out the truth concerning the quelling of the
counterrevolutionary rebellion in China, the European Council worked
so fast as to rashly issue a statement ... making presumptuous
accusations against China,'' said Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Li
Jinhua.
   ``The Chinese government cannot but express deep regret over this
unreasonable act,'' she said.
   The leaders of the 12-nation EEC Tuesday condemned ``the brutal
repression taking place in China.''
   They also called for an embargo on arm sales to China and urged
the World Bank to postpone new loans to Beijing. The United States,
Australia, Japan and Canada have taken similar steps.
   The crackdown on the movement for a freer society began on June 3
when the army drove student protesters from Tiananmen Square in
Beijing. Since then, the government has arrested more than 1,800
people and announced the executions of 27.
   The EEC urged the Chinese government to halt the executions,
respect human rights and ``take into account the hopes for freedom
and democracy deeply felt by the population.''
   Ms. Li said China put down the ``rebellion'' in accordance with
the Chinese constitution and that the European countries had
``unilaterally adopted decisions jeopardizing the bilateral
relations.''
   ``All attempts by all foreign governments or organizations to
bring pressures to bear on the Chinese government or interfere in
China's internal affairs in this or that manner are unwise and
futile,'' she said.
   Ms. Li said the government hoped Eurepean leaders, after learning
the ``truth,'' would ``treasure our friendly relations established
after years of efforts.''
   The government says a small group of people instigated the seven
weeks of demonstrations leading up to the crackdown.
   It also says only 200 to 300 people, most of them soldiers, were
killed in the clashes in Beijing. Chinese witnesses and Western
intelligence reports say the death toll could be as high as 3,000
and that most victims were unarmed civilians.

<HEAD>UN Imports 20 Tons of Armaments; Commander Says It's Normal</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The United Nations has imported more
than 20 tons of arms and ammunition, including 15,600 hand grenades,
for its peacekeeping forces in Namibia, officials said Thursday.
   Kenyan army Brig. Daniel Opande, deputy commander of the force,
said the consignment is a ``normal entitlement'' for U.N. troops in
such a situation. He did not say why it was needed.
   The shipment, including 200 anti-tank rockets and 2,600 mortar
shells, is destined mainly for Kenyan and Malaysian combat troops
with some explosives to go to an Australian engineering unit,
according to Die Republikein newspaper. Among other duties, the
Australians are building refugee centers and schools.
   Thousands of U.N. personnel from more than 40 countries are in
Namibia to supervise a yearlong transition to independence for this
former German colony.
   They include 4,500 troops, among them combat battalions of about
900 men each from Malaysia and Kenya and 600 from Finland, deployed
in the northern part of the country where a U.N.-sponsored
cease-fire ended a 23-year bush war earlier this year.
   Die Republikein said the arms arrived in mid-April at Walvis Bay
port in Namibia, which South Africa refuses to give up. The paper
printed copies of the import licenses.
   U.N. peacekeepers normally patrol, report truce violations and
stand between belligerent forces to prevent new fighting.
   No fighting has been reported in Namibia since a sudden
infiltration of South-West Africa People's Organization guerrillas
triggered bloody clashes with South African forces that ended April
1. South Africa since has withdrawn all its military from Namibia as
part of a regional peace accord that includes the withdrawal of
50,000 Cuban troops from Angola.
   The Kenyans and Malaysians patrol the Namibia-Angola border,
scene of the earlier hostilities. The Finns, who brought their own
arms supplies, are deployed farther east.

   The Legislature has voted to relax a
Napoleonic-era law that forces parents to leave a portion of their
estate to their children.
   The legislation amending Louisiana's unique ``forced heirship''
law would guarantee an inheritance only to offspring who are under
23 when a parent dies.
   ``By that time, the parents have raised and educated their
children,'' the bill's sponsor, Rep. Sydney Nelson, said Wednesday.
   Critics of the law complained it deprives people of the right to
dispose of their estates as they see fit, such as withholding an
inheritance from a wayward son or daughter.
   Louisiana adheres to a civil code first adopted by France,
including forced heirship, which requires parents with one child to
leave that child at least one-fourth of the estate. Parents with two
or more children must leave 50 percent to them.
   On Tuesday, the House placed routine amendments on the bill and
gave it 65-36 passage. The Senate on Wednesday concurred in the
amendments 26-10.
   The bill was sent to Gov. Buddy Roemer, who is expected to sign
it, Nelson said.
   ``If we concur, we will be wipping out 181 years of history.
We'll be wiping out equality among children,'' warned Sen. Oswald
Decuir. He said parents could pick out a favored child and leave the
others with nothing.
   ``Forced heirship. The key word is `force,''' Rep. Randy Roach
said during the debate. ``What right has the state to tell parents
they've got to leave a certain portion of their estate to adult
children they've already raised and educated?''

   Under pressure to tear down a littered,
illegal shantytown of cardboard and decaying tents in the shadow of
City Hall, officials say they hope housing and job programs will
solve the problem.
   ``It's become about the most gross, smelly, awful thing I've ever
seen in my life,'' said Lois Chang, a 43-year-old travel agent who
reaches her job by crossing the Civic Center Plaza encampment.
   ``A lot of these people are just taking advantage of the kindness
and tolerance the city's tried to show,'' said Chang, who says she
has been spit on by plaza panhandlers. ``Now, it's out of hand, and
has got to go.''
   The number of makeshift shelters has doubled in the past week
after growing steadily for several months, said police Capt. Dennis
Martel. He said he fields about 10 complaints a week about the
shantytown.
   Advocates for the homeless and some shantytown residents say they
fear any trouble breaking out at the plaza could cause police to
sweep in and make arrests despite a pledge by Mayor Art Agnos to let
them stay.
   A city ordinance forbids sleeping in parks. But Agnos has an
unwritten pact with the rag-tag group, which grows to as many as 400
people nightly: They can remain beneath the plaza's olive trees
until he implements his housing programs, but there must be no
public defecation, no structures and no harassment of passersby.
   Opponents say the rules have been ignored, making the shantytown
a health and safety threat. Agnos, urging patience, says police are
``diplomatically'' reminding the homeless of the rules.
   ``I believe the people of San Francisco have the good will and
compassion to accept this temporary situation until we as a city can
provide the substantive, meaningful, humane alternatives we all
want,'' Agnos said.
   Social worker Lorett Vergara of the non-profit Tenderloin Housing
Clinic said she has been able to house 22 people from the plaza.
Although she has identified 61 people with job skills, she has been
able to find work for only three.
   ``The mayor's doing all he can do, and he's bucking a lot of
people to do it,'' Vergara said.
   Public pressure for a crackdown has grown with an increase of
auto break-ins, assaults, public drunkenness and indecent exposure
at the plaza, said police Sgt. Jerry Senkir.
   Last week, a couple complained that while they ate lunch in the
plaza, one man exposed himself, another urinated next to their bench
and a third demanded money while threatening them with a pipe.
   ``We're trying to keep the lid on this situation, but whether or
not we're going to be able to enforce city law or not remains to be
seen; mainly we're waiting to see what happens from the mayor's
office,'' Senkir said.
   The shantytown homeless claim that for several days this week
police arrived with bullhorns at 4 a.m., warning people they must
remove structures or face eviction. Senkir said bullhorns were only
used once.
   Under former Mayor Dianne Feinstein, the city spent millions each
year providing temporary shelter for the city's 10,000 homeless.
Agnos, who took office 18 months ago, called that a wasteful,
dead-end approach.
   He has cut back use of hotels and has earmarked $1.5 million in
next year's budget for ``transitional housing'' where homeless
people can spend the night, do laundry, make phone calls, receive
mail and get job counseling and welfare services. Agnos said Tuesday
the city had received $6 million in federal grants to support his
homelessness programs.
   ``The homeless aren't all just alcoholics or drug users,'' said
23-year-old Kevin, who like other shantytown residents would tell a
reporter only his first name. ``But those kinds of people have taken
over out here so it's giving the rest of us a bad name.''
   ``I come here for the camaraderie,'' said 33-year-old Reggie,
homeless for several years and sharing a bottle of cheap wine with
three fellow campers about 9 a.m.
   ``We all look out for each other here,'' Reggie said. ``There's
strength in numbers.''

<HEAD>Students Battle Police to Go to North Korean Youth Festival</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Riot police and radical students
battled with tear gas, steel bars and rocks Thursday as students
demanded the government lift a ban barring them from a youth
festival in North Korea.
   President Roh Tae-woo said leftists threaten democracy in South
Korea, and Unification Minister Lee Hong-koo said the government may
postpone planned talks with Pyongyang's communist government.
   About 1,500 students fought riot troopers around Seoul's Hanyang
University after 3,000 police sealed off the campus to stop other
college students joining the protest.
   Waves of students poured over the school walls, throwing rocks
and firebombs. Small groups wielding metal pipes charged through
broken walls and attacked police.
   Riot police fought back, firing volleys of tear gas from armored
vans and rifles and hurling tear gas grenades and rocks across the
walls and locked gates.
   A dozen students were seen injured. One policeman was injured
seriously when tear gas shells exploded inside an armored van.
   In downtown Seoul, about 700 students wanting to get into Hanyang
campus occupied a major intersection. They fought riot police with
firebombs and rocks, forcing shoppers to race for shelter.
   ``Drive out Yankees who block national unification!'' the
protesters screamed. ``Overthrow Roh Tae-woo!''
   Radicals back North Korea's calls for the Seoul government to
expel 43,000 U.S. troops whose presence they say hinders dialogue on
unification. Roh says the troops deter the north from invading again.
   ``Let's march to Pyongyang!'' the students shouted, demanding the
government allow them to attend a July 1-8 youth festival in North
Korea.
   Seoul says Pyongyang is using the festival to stir up radical
movements. North Korea denies the charges about the sports and
cultural event that is attended mainly by non-aligned and communist
nations.
   Meanwhile, Roh pledged today he will maintain a ``strong''
government against illegal acts and leftists who he claimed threaten
democracy.
   Roh said individual contacts with North Korea undermine his
government's efforts to advance national unification.
   He was referring to Wednesday's surprise arrest of opposition
legislator Suh Kyung-won for a secret trip to North Korea and talks
with its leader, Kim Il Sung.
   Suh's arrest stunned South Koreans and prosecutors moved quickly
to broaden their investigations. The lawmaker visited Pyongyang in
August after contacting North Korean agents in West Germany.
   Security officials said Suh, already charged with violating the
National Security Law forbidding contacts with ``anti-state''
bodies, also could be accused of espionage if it is found he worked
with North Korean agents.

<HEAD>Communists Press for Coalition; Mandate Running Out</HEAD>

<DATELINE>ATHENS, Greece (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Greece's communist alliance, with a day
left to form a government, Thursday continued to press for a
coalition of all parties despite continuous rejections from the main
conservative and socialist parties.
   Harilaos Florakis, leader of the Coalition of the Left and
Progress, met with ailing caretaker Premier Andreas Papandreou at
Athens' General State Hospital and with conservative party leader
Constantine Mitsotakis.
   More such meetings are planned before the Coalition on Friday
stands to lose its mandate to negotiate a governing alliance.
   After a 55-minute meeting with Papandreou, Florakis said the
coalition ``will assess the results of today's talks.''
   The Coalition's proposals for a ``national unity government'' to
include all political parties has run up against strong opposition,
mainly because of its insistence that a Coalition politician lead
the government.
   The impasse follows inconclusive June 18 elections at which the
Coalition, made up of the pro-Moscow Greek Communist Party and the
Eurocommunist Greek Left, won 28 seats after receiving 13 percent of
the vote and emerged as a power broker.
   President Christos Sartzetakis gave the Coalition a three-day
exploratory mandate after the dominant conservatives and socialists
failed to negotiate alliances. It was the first such mandate
received by the communists since the party was recognized officially
in 1974.
   Their proposal has been turned down both by Mitsotakis'
center-right New Democracy Party and Papandreou's Panhellenic
Socialist Movement.
   The stumbling point is the Coalition's insistence that neither
Mitsotakis nor Papandreou head a coalition.
   ``We believe that the demand to place certain persons above the
possibility to find a solution is very wrong,'' said Eurocommunist
leader Leonidas Kyrkos.
   ``The premier of the new government should be able to reflect a
greater deal of trust,'' Kyrkos said.
   Papandreou failed to win a third term in office because his
government has been rocked by a series of scandals for the last 10
months.
   Mitsotakis, whose party racked up 44 percent of the vote and 145
seats in the 300-member Parliament, said the Coalition demand is
``impossible.''
   ``How is it possible for 13 percent of the people to impose their
will on the 44 percent?'' Mitsotakis said.
   Papandreou, who received 39 percent and 125 seats, also refused.
   ``We consider this term unacceptable because, for us, Papandreou
is our leader,'' said acting government spokesman Sotiris
Kostopoulos.
   The socialist leader was hospitalized one week ago suffering from
kidney failure and heart problems. His condition is gradually
improving.
   If the coalition does not form a government by Friday,
Sartzetakis will ask the three parties to try to resolve their
differences and form a coalition.
   If that fails, then Sartzetakis must appoint a caretaker
government of high court judges and call early elections.

   Colleagues and friends of John McCarthy

   Their statement was written in Arabic and issued in Beirut.
   It was addressed to the captors and said: ``We plead with you in
the name of humanity for which Islam is known to release our
colleague John out of mercy for his dying mother, whose only wish
now is to see him before she passes away.''
   The Beirut office of London-based Worldwide Television News
handled the appeal's distribution. McCarthy, 32, worked for the
organization when he was kidnapped April 17, 1986, on the way to the
Beirut airport.
   It was the third appeal in 10 days. McCarthy's father, Pat,
pleaded for his release June 20, saying the captive's mother,
Sheila, was ``gravely ill in hospital.''
   ``The doctors have told us she is dying,'' the senior McCarthy
said.
   On the next day, Dr. Terrance Wheeler, the physician treating
Mrs. McCarthy for cancer in London, said she ``has at best a few
days to live.''
   ``It would be the kindest of humanitarian gestures on the part of
those holding John McCarthy to release John in the final moments of
his mother's life,'' Wheeler said.
   McCarthy is among 14 foreigners missing in Lebanon and presumed
to be hostages, including nine Americans. Held longest is Terry A.
Anderson, chief Middle East correspondent of The Associated Press,
who was abducted March 16, 1985.

   Country music star Johnny Cash, honored
for his songwriting achievements, says his songs are as dear as
family members.
   Cash received the Aggie Award on Wednesday night from the
Songwriters Guild of America. He became the 18th recipient of the
award, joining other composers like Sammy Cahn, Johnny Mercer and
Henry Mancini.
   ``I've found that songs are our children, an extension of
ourselves,'' Cash said after receiving the award. ``It's what's most
important to me.''
   Some of the songs he has written include ``I Walk the Line,''
``Folsom Prison Blues'' and ``I Still Miss Someone.'' A new version
of the latter song has just been done by rock 'n' roll singer Stevie
Nicks.

   Jaime Escalante, the math teacher portrayed in
the movie ``Stand and Deliver,'' will be sweating it out in the
classroom again this summer.
   A program of accelerated mathematics and science instruction
headed by the Garfield High School calculus teacher will be expanded
because of a $457,033 grant from the National Science Foundation.
   Escalante, whose teaching success was the basis for the movie,
lost federal money targeted for the summer program three years ago.
   The reinstated classes will be held at East Los Angeles College
and will provide intensive instruction for about 560 students from
two predominantly Latino high schools, the foundation said.
   Escalante will also give daily lectures for elementary
instructors on his teaching techniques.

   Actress Amy Irving has filed for divorce from
producer and director Steven Spielberg, citing irreconcilable
differences during their 3{-year marriage.
   Miss Irving's petition, filed Wednesday, said the couple had
disposed of property in a written agreement. She seeks child support
and joint custody of the couple's 4-year-old son, Max.
   ``Our mutual decision, however difficult, has been made in a
spirit of caring, and our friendship remains both personal and
professional,'' their joint release said.
   The couple was married in November 1985 in Santa Fe, N.M.
   Miss Irving was nominated for the 1983 Academy Award for best
supporting actress for her role in ``Yentl,'' and recently won
acclaim in the film ``Crossing Delancey.''
   Spielberg has produced or directed ``Close Encounters of the
Third Kind,'' ``E.T. The Extra-Terrestrial'' and ``Raiders of the
Lost Ark.'' His second sequel to ``Raiders,'' ``Indiana Jones and
the Last Crusade,'' broke box-office records earlier this year.

   New York Yankees outfielder Dave Winfield is
facing divorce and property proceedings after a jury ruled his
live-in relationship with the mother of his 6-year-old daughter was
a common-law marriage.
   The verdict could force Winfield to pay the woman, Sandra Renfro,
half his income of the past seven years.
   The jury Wednesday voted 10-2 in favor of Ms. Renfro, a
34-year-old Houston flight attendant who said she and Winfield lived
as husband and wife from 1982 to 1985. Winfield married another
woman in a formal ceremony in 1988.
   A divorce hearing is set for July 10. Ms. Renfro is seeking
unspecified damages and child support for her and Winfield's
daughter.
   ``This means that she'll know that her mother and father were
married,'' Ms. Renfro said. ``And we love her very much. That's what
it means to her and she can hold her head up high.''
   Winfield did not dispute fathering the child but denied he ever
intended to marry Ms. Renfro. He testified he has been paying $1,400
monthly child support and provided a condominium for Ms. Renfro and
his daughter.
   Tom Alexander, Winfield's lawyer, said he will appeal.

<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court issued a free-speech ruling
Thursday that gives public officials more power to ban advertising
and sales pitches _ including the peddling of cookware in college
dormitories.
   Justice Antonin Scalia, writing for the court in a 6-3 decision,
said government restrictions on commercial speech may be valid even
if they ``go beyond the least restrictive means to achieve the
desired end.''
   As long as the rules are ``reasonable (and) narrowly tailored to
achieve the desired objective ... we leave it to governmental
decision makers to judge what manner of regulation may best be
employed,'' Scalia said.
   By contrast, the least-restrictive test remains in force for
other forms of expression _ particularly political speech.
   The court acted in the case of a ban on cookware sales on
campuses of the State University of New York, SUNY.
   While the justices said university officials may place some
restrictions on commerical activity on campus, they left unanswered
another issue raised by the case _ whether the univeristy's ban is
too broad because it also limits non-commercial speech.
   The justices said a lower court should study that issue.
   The three dissenters, Justices Harry A. Blackmun, William J.
Brennan and Thurgood Marshall, said the rules involving
non-commercial speech do go too far.
   Blackmun said the ban could prevent a student from meeting his
doctor or lawyer in his dorm room if the doctor or lawyer is paid
for the visit. It could even prevent a student from paying a music
teacher or a speech therapist to come to the dorm room for tutoring,
Blackmun said.
   The court, he said, is turning its back on its own free-speech
precedents.
   ``The majority holds that `least-restrictive means' analysis does
not apply to commercial speech cases, a holding it is able to reach
only by recasting a good bit of contrary language in our past
cases,'' Blackmun said.
   However, Scalia said Thursday's ruling was in line with a 1986
decision that allowed Puerto Rico to ban advertising promoting
casino gambling that was aimed at Puerto Rican residents.
   Scalia also cited a week-old ruling in which the court made it
easier for communities to turn down the volume at rock concerts. In
that decision, the court upheld a New York City rule that
rock-concert sponsors use a sound system operated by a
city-designated engineer.
   The SUNY board of trustees adopted a rule in 1966 to prohibit
most commercial enterprises from operating on campuses.
   The ban was challenged by American Future Systems Inc., a
housewares company in Bryn Mawr, Pa., after one of its
representatives was arrested in 1982 at the campus in Cortland,
N.Y., for refusing to leave a dorm.
   The housewares company attracts customers by offering free
Florida vacations to students who arrange sales demonstrations in
their dormi rooms for groups of their friends.
   A federal judge upheld the SUNY ban, but the 2nd U.S. Circuit
Court of Appeals overturned the ruling last year. The appeals court
ordered further hearings to determine whether there might be less
restrictive rules to accomplish the university's purpose.
   SUNY's appeal was supported by university officials in 10 states
and groups representing thousands of college administrators
nationwide.
   ``The fundamental right of state colleges and universities to
control the use of their premises is at issue,'' said a
friend-of-the-court brief filed by the university officials from
California, Connecticut, Florida, Michigan, Illinois, Ohio, South
Carolina, Rhode Island, New Jersey and Vermont.
   The appeal also was supported by the American Council on
Education, the American Association of State Colleges and
Universities, the National Association of State Universities and
Land Grant Colleges and the National Association of Student
Personnel Administrators.
   Also Thursday, the court ruled in a case from Washington state,
limiting the power of Indian tribes to use zoning laws to control
land owned by non-Indians within a reservation's boundaries.
   The court said tribes may be forced to share the zoning power
with state or county officials.

   American tourists will top the list of visitors
expected to swell the nation's coffers by participating in the July
celebrations of the French bicentennial, the tourism minister said
Thursday.
   Tourism Minister Olivier Stirn said he expected a 2.5 million
Americans in France this year as France celebrates the 200th
anniversary of the French Revolution, centered on Bastille Day on
July 14.
   He said the ``bicentennial factor'' would significantly improve
tourism income and help France move up from fourth slot to recapture
first place worldwide as a tourist destination.
   ``While July is usually relatively empty in Paris with hotels
only 50 percent occupied, this year there will be almost full
occupancy. We anticipate between 30 and 40 percent more foreigners
will visit the capital and the Paris region,'' Stirn told
France-Inter radio.
   In 1988, tourism brought in $3.8 billion, compared with $3.3
billion in 1987, he said.
   Stirn estimated France could attract up to 5 million Americans in
the next two years. As of July 1, American tourists no longer need
to obtain visas to make visits of up to three months in France.

<TEXT>
   Mitzi Newhouse, widow of newspaper and
magazine publisher S.I. Newhouse and a longtime patron of the arts,
died at home Thursday after a brief illness. She was 87.
   Mrs. Newhouse donated $1 million in 1973 to help establish the
Mitzi Newhouse Theater at Lincoln Center, which was a key to
allowing Joseph Papp's New York Shakespeare Festival to become a
part of the performing arts center.
   Papp praised her Thursday.
   ``Mitzi had no airs about her, a very down-to-earth woman, who
was very supportive of the arts and the work of the New York
Shakespeare Festival,'' he said.
   Mrs. Newhouse was also a contributor to the Parsons School Of
Design, where she studied as a young woman, and to the Manhattan
School of Music.
   Within the Newhouse enterprises, she was active as a corporate
officer and took a special interest in Vogue magazine, one of the
Conde Nast group publications bought by her husband in 1959.
   The Newhouse family holdings also include 26 newspapers in 22
cities; the Random House book publishing group; Parade, a Sunday
newspaper supplement; and cable television systems serving a million
homes.
   Mrs. Newhouse grew up on Manhattan's west side, the daughter of
Judith and Sam Epstein, who operated a clothing business. She met
Newhouse on a blind date in the fall of 1923 and they married eight
months later.
   Newhouse once said in an unpublished memoir that his gregarious
wife opened a new way of life for him.
   ``Mitzi was a born New Yorker,'' he said. ``I acquired the
taste.''
   In 1979 the couple moved to Palm Beach were Newhouse died later
that year. After his death, Mrs. Newhouse became active in Palm
Beach cultural affairs.
   Survivors include her two sons, Donald and S.I. Newhouse Jr., six
grandchildren, four great grandchildren and a brother, Walter Evans
of St. Louis and Florida.
   Services were set for Wednesday at Temple Emanu-el in New York
City.

<HEAD>House Defeats Measure To Cut Aid For Philippines</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The House of Representatives voted Thursday to
uphold $1 billion in U.S. aid for an international effort to help
the Philippines, defeating a motion to cut the money by 60 percent.
   The action was taken during debate of a $23 billion, two-year
foreign aid bill, but its future was uncertain in light of delays by
the Senate in crafting its version of the foreign aid authorization.
   An amendment by Rep. Toby Roth, R-Wis., _ defeated 233-185 _
urged the House to limit the U.S. commitment to the Multinational
Aid Initiative (AID) to $400 million over two years, rather than $1
billion for an indefinite period as requested by the Bush
administration.
   Japan is expected to be the largest donor to the international
effort _ a project designed to ease the economic straits of Corazon
Aquino's fragile democratic government.
   Secretary of State James A. Baker III will represent the United
States at an international conference on Philippines economy in
Tokyo next week.
   ``If the Roth amendment is adopted, Secretary Baker will be
humiliated before all the other countries,'' said Rep. Stephen
Solarz, D-N.Y., a supporter of the aid plan.
   A cut in the U.S. commitment ``would pull the rug out from under
our efforts to get other countries'' on board the project, Solarz
added. It would also endanger democracy in the Philippines, where
Communist rebels are waging a guerrilla war to unseat the
government, he said.
   Roth argued that a large sum for the Philippines was
inappropriate at a time when U.S. domestic spending was being
reduced and the U.S. national debt was at a record high.

   Hundreds of supporters of an anti-Castro Cuban
militant threatened with deportation called a general strike
Thursday in the city's Little Havana section and more people joined
a hunger strike in his support.
   Hundreds gathered for a noontime march and most businesses in the
neighborhood participated in a three-hour work stoppage in the
growing protest of the Justice Department's decision to deport
Orlando Bosch.
   ``We're trying to do the most that we can for Bosch,'' said Sonia
Alfonso, a Cuban-American who closed her Universal Unisex hair
salon. ``If Cubans don't stand up for him, who's going to do it?''
   The Justice Department announced last week it will deport Bosch
because secret U.S. intelligence information implicates Bosch in
several bombings and assassination attempts during Fidel Castro's
30-year rule of Cuba. The Justice Department has said its requests
that other countries expel terrorists will not be taken seriously if
it grants asylum to Bosch.
   The deportation order galvanized Bosch supporters, many of them
Cuban exiles who consider the 62-year-old pediatrician a patriot. He
has been in federal prison since he returned to the United States
illegally in February 1988.
   His daughter, Myriam Bosch, said she was heartened by Thursday's
show of support.
   ``My father was never alone,'' she said. ``He's very happy to see
this kind of outpouring from the Cuban community.''
   Demonstrators rallied at a monument to participants in the Bay of
Pigs invasion.
   ``Dr. Bosch isn't sitting alone in his jail cell. He's got the
entire Cuban community sitting beside him,'' said Domitila Sanchez,
a friend of the Bosch family. ``This is the most visible display we
have given to date. Never since the Cuban community arrived in Miami
have they united this strongly for a cause.''
   Miami Herald Publisher Richard Capen told listeners of WQBA radio
he had raised the Bosch case during a recent meeting with President
Bush, but that the president said he could not comment on the case
while it was under review.
   U.S. Sen. Connie Mack, R-Fla., has requested a meeting with
President Bush to discuss the case, and a Spanish-language radio
station asked listeners to send telegrams to the White House
requesting a review of the case.
   Justice Department attorneys told U.S. District Judge William
Hoeveler on Tuesday that the government would not deport Bosch
before July 14.
   Hoeveler has set a Sept. 13 hearing to examine whether the
Justice Department has handled the Bosch case properly.
   Lauri Filppu, an attorney for the department, said the government
probably would not deport Bosch before the September hearing.
   Bosch was jailed from 1968 to 1972 for firing a bazooka at a
Polish freighter docked in the port of Miami. He then spent 11 years
in Venezuelan prisons fighting charges that he masterminded the 1976
bombing of a Cuban jetliner that killed 73 passengers. He was
acquitted three times in Venezuela.
   Bosch's son, William, ended a protest hunger strike Tuesday for
medical reasons. But at least 18 other supporters of Bosch said they
were on hunger strikes Thursday, while several would-be fasters were
turned away by a doctor who said they would be health risks.
   Several Nicaraguan exiles joined the hunger strike. Several
others marched through a Little Havana street Tuesday night carrying
a casket they said symbolized what would happen to Bosch if he is
deported.
   Nicaraguan exiles have identified with the plight of Miami's
Cuban community because they fled their country after it was taken
over by the leftist Sandinistas in 1979.

   A Colombian woman has been arrested and accused of
attempting to smuggle cocaine inside four girdles, the second such
arrest within three days, the U.S. Customs Service said.
   Customs spokesman Charles Conroy said the 32-year-old woman, who
arrived Wednesday at Houston Intercontinental Airport on a Taca
Airlines flight from Guatemala, was detained after Customs
inspectors became suspicious of her behavior and dress.
   A search revealed 16 pounds of cocaine hidden inside her girdles.
   The seizure was almost identical to Monday's arrest of Blanca
Nellie Dominguez Toloza, 38, of Colombia, who faces charges of
smuggling more than 5 kilograms or 11 pounds of cocaine in girdles
she was wearing.
   In both cases, the women were stopping in Houston en route to
European destinations and were traveling on altered passports, said
Candace Vice, chief Customs inspector at the airport.
   Ms. Vice speculated that the women were transporting cocaine to
Europe because the drug's value is about three times higher there
than in the United States.
   Ms. Vice said the cocaine seized Wednesday was divided into
square packets and concealed in pouches inside the woman's four
girdles.
   The name of the woman arrested Wednesday was not released pending
formal charges.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Prices farmers got for raw products dropped 2
percent from May to June but still averaged 5 percent more than a
year ago, the Agriculture Department said Thursday.
   The department's Agricultural Statistics Board said in its
preliminary report that lower prices for tomatoes, cattle, wheat and
corn were mostly responsible for the decrease from the May average.
   Higher prices for lettuce, hogs, lemons and strawberries partly
offset the decline for the other commodities.
   ``The June hog price was at the highest level since August last
year,'' the report said. ``Cattle and calf prices were mixed. All
feed grain and oilseed prices decreased from May.
   ``Wheat prices were down while the rice price increased slightly.
Lower broiler prices more than offset slight increases for eggs and
turkeys.''
   Department economists say net cash income of farmers is expected
to fall 5 percent to 14 percent this year to a range of $50 billion
to $55 billion from the record 1988 level of $58 billion.
   Net cash income is the amount farmers have to spend during the
year and represents the difference between gross cash income and
cash expenses. Cash income rose last year despite drought partly
because of higher market prices and crops farmers had stored from
previous harvests.
   The decline this year is expected to stem from farmers' larger
cash expenses as they boost plantings, and also because of lower
federal subsidies.
   Consumer food prices are forecast by USDA to rise an average of 4
percent to 7 percent this year, following a 4.1 percent increase in
1988.
   Based on the preliminary figures, the price index for livestock
and livestock products as a group declined 0.6 percent from May to
June but still averaged 5.4 percent above the year-earlier level.
   Crop prices, overall, dropped 2.8 percent from May but averaged
6.2 percent more than in June 1988.
   The overall index of prices paid to farmers in June averaged 146
percent of a 1977 base used for comparison, down from a revised
record-matching 149 percent in May. That was the lowest reading
since December, when the index was 145 percent.
   The report said:
   _Cattle averaged $67.60 per 100 pounds of live weight nationally,
down from $68.80 in May but still up from $65 in June 1988. Those
are averages for all types of cattle sold as beef.
   _Hogs averaged $44.20 per 100 pounds, compared with $41.60 in May
and $47.10 a year earlier.
   _Corn, at $2.46 a bushel, was down from $2.58 in May but was up
from $2.41 in June 1988.
   _Wheat prices at the farm, according to preliminary figures,
averaged $3.78 per bushel, compared with $4.01 in May and $3.37 a
year earlier.
   _Rice averaged $6.85 per 100 pounds, up from $6.76 in May but
well below the year-earlier level of $7.69.
   _Soybeans were $7 per bushel, compared with $7.21 in May and
$8.18 a year earlier.
   _Upland cotton was reported at 59.1 cents per pound, up from 58.8
in May but below the 62 cents of June 1988.
   _Eggs were 63.3 cents per dozen, compared with 62 cents in May
and 46.3 cents a year earlier.
   _Milk was $12.10 per 100 pounds, compared with $12.20 in May and
$11.30 a year earlier.
   _Broilers were 42.6 cents per pound, live weight, compared with
45.2 cents in May and 37.4 cents a year ago.

<TEXT>
   President Bush on Thursday praised Zaire
President Mobutu Sese Seko for ``setting the stage for national
reconciliation'' in neighboring Angola and vowed closer U.S.-Zaire
economic ties.
   Bush agreed to encourage more U.S. investment in Zaire and lent
his support to new loans it is seeking from the International
Monetary Fund, the two leaders said after a two-hour White House
session.
   It was the president's first White House meeting with an African
head-of-state.
   Mobutu, speaking in French at the outdoor ceremony, said his
meeting and lunch with Bush had been one of ``warmth and
friendship.''
   He also sought to defend his regime's human rights record.
   ``Zaire can be ranked among those countries which observe the
rule of law, not to be confused or mistaken with any incidental
mishaps that are attributable to an administration or an
individual,'' he said.
   Mobutu has long supported U.S. policy goals in Africa. However,
his regime has been criticized by Amnesty International of
widespread human-rights abuses.
   Still, Mobutu noted that the UN Commission Human Rights had
withdrawn his country from the list of nations it monitors for human
rights.
   ``I informed the president of the arrangements and measures of
protection (for human rights) which have been set up in Zaire for
some years now,'' Mobutu said.
   Bush is the sixth U.S. president to work with Mobutu, Bush
himself observed in his remarks. ``The strong ties of friendship
between Zaire and the United States endure and prosper.''
   He called Mobutu ``one of our most valued friends'' in Africa.
   Mobutu, who has also met with other administration officials and
with congressional leaders, was to meet on Friday with Vice
President Dan Quayle.
   Bush warmly praised Mobutu for his role in bringing about the
recent cease-fire in Angola, where civil war has raged for 14 years.
   ``Just last week, he brought together, for the first time, in the
presence of 18 African chiefs of state, the leadership of Angola's
warring factions, setting the stage for national reconciliation in
that country,'' Bush said.
   The president said the cease-fire was the first step toward
``long elusive'' peace in southwestern Africa, and toward ``the
total withdrawal of Cuban troops from Angola,'' which he called a
joint U.S.-Zaire goal.
   The two leaders exchanged paperwork for a treaty to encourage
greater U.S. investment there. Bush also said the United States
supports Zaire's three-year program to restructure its economy as
part of a package for getting new IMF loans.
   Mobutu's last meeting with a U.S. president was a 1986 session
with then-president Reagan.

   Gen. Wojciech Jaruzelski says the Communist
Party's automatic leading role in Poland ``already is history'' and
it will never return to the monopoly rule of the past.
   In an interview with The Associated Press, Jaruzelski also
praised Solidarity leader Lech Walesa and said Poland would seek
``friendly American support'' but not ``charity'' during the July
9-11 visit of President Bush.
   As to his own political plans, he said he would seriously
consider the opposition's stance before deciding whether to accept
the new office of president, to be decided by the National Assembly
before Bush's visit. Solidarity legislators who are a minority in
the assembly have said they'll vote against Jaruzelski if, as
expected, he is nominated by the party.
   The state news agency reported Thursday a Central Committee
plenum, at which the party was expected to name its candidate, would
take place Friday.
   ``I am not striving for this office the way known and typical in
the West. ... I will not crawl to this post,'' Jaruzelski said.
   He said political and economic changes in Poland put it in the
vanguard of East bloc reform but the opportunity for change could be
lost if society rejects economic steps that are ``painful _ like
every surgery that is expected to bring health.''
   Jaruzelski, party leader and president of the Council of State,
discussed his eight years in power from the martial-law period to
the historic reforms of recent months in an interview Wednesday in a
reception room near his office in the Council of Ministers building.
He also answered other questions in writing.
   The Polish leader, who wore a gray business suit and his familiar
dark glasses, spoke in soft tones as he sat on a green velvet settee
beneath a huge oil painting of a winter scene by 19th century Polish
artist Julian Falat.
   He said the communists did poorly in the June 4 and June 18
elections, losing 99 of the 100 seats in the freely contested
Senate, because voters had not yet realized the extent to which the
party has changed its program in favor of democracy and reforms.
   ``That is why I think that if the party will honestly ...
implement its program, then it will have a chance to rebuild its
influence in society,'' he said.
   But he added the party's influence could never again be ``on the
basis of monopoly.''
   ``We have become convinced that monopoly is a very unhealthy
thing, not only in the economy, but also in political life,'' he
said.
   On the party's ``leading role'' _ by which the party in the
constitution claims an automatic right to rule _ Jaruzelski replied
in writing: ``The leading role of the party, understood in a
mechanical way, already is history. Today the party, like other
political forces, seeks social confidence and support.''
   When there was no challenge to party rule, he said later, it
actually lost support because it became bureaucratic, grew used to
not having to compete for popular support, and was blamed for
economic failures.
   ``What was supposed to be a strength turned out to be a
weakness,'' he said.
   Jaruzelski, who imposed martial law to suppress Solidarity in
1981 and then led his party to restore the independent union this
year, made clear during the interview that he remained fully
committed to both decisions.
   Imposing martial-law was ``personally very painful,'' he said.
   ``Looking at it from a certain distance today, I don't want to
blame the opposition alone. We were somehow not mature. ... There
was a lot of distrust on both sides,'' he said.
   He also blamed a rise in East-West tensions in the early 1980s
and ``the situation in the East'' _ a reference to pressures from
the Soviet Union under Leonid Brezhnev.
   ``Internal and external conditions formed such a knot that it is
difficult to say today whether another course of events was
possible,'' he said.
   Of the tumultuous January party plenum in which the key decisions
were taken to open talks with the Solidarity-led opposition, and at
which Jaruzelski emerged victorious from a vote of confidence, he
said: ``I really threw everything onto the scale, my destiny and my
dignity. ...
   ``It would be the greatest drama for me if history one day said
these decisions were wrong. That's why I wish so much that the
agreement, that this pluralism, passes the test in real life.''
   Jaruzelski, who turns 66 on July 6, demurred when asked if he
would take the presidency, a decision he will likely have to make
within the next week.
   ``I haven't gone to confession in a very long time and I can see
that you want me to confess,'' joked the communist who grew up in a
Roman Catholic family. ``But I used to go, I used to go.''
   He said his candidacy would depend on ``democratic''
consultations within the party and could not be decided by him alone.
   ``I will also seriously consider the stand of the opposition,
understanding that the president, especially in our conditions when
we have to unite the nation's efforts and build platforms of accord,
should have at least a minimum of support'' from all sides, he said.
   ``I am a soldier, so I have a deep-rooted feeling of duty _ but
also of honor. I will not crawl to this post,'' he said.
   Turning to Walesa, Jaruzelski said:
   ``I must appreciate Lech Walesa's realism. Especially today, when
I see him as a man who has developed his political possibilities
very much.''
   Of Bush, he said: ``I am very happy that Mr. George Bush is
president ... . Of course it is not interfering in U.S. internal
affairs to express such an opinion, especially since the next
elections are in four years. ... He sees world problems, European
problems, including Polish ones, in a friendly way. ``We don't want
gifts or some kind of charity,'' he said, but called attention to
the U.S. voice in international lending organizations, with which
Poland desperately wants to reschedule its $39 billion debt.
   ``Many of the problems mired today may move much more quickly
with friendly American support,'' he said.

   Students at Tufts University can wear T-shirts with
raunchy messages in dorm rooms and on campus lawns, but not in
classrooms under a new policy that officials said Thursday tries to
balance free speech with decorum.
   ``We feel it's our obligation to say that there are no
constituencies that are fair game,'' said Dean of Students Bobbie
Knable.
   The T-shirt zones were created after a male student marketed 200
T-shirts that gave 15 reasons ``Why Beer is Better than Women at
Tufts,'' all disparaging to women. One of the more printable lines
was ``Hangovers go away.''
   ``There were complaints about it,'' Knable said. The T-shirt
dealer was placed on probation and sentenced to 50 hours of
community service, which was later revoked. Officials of the private
liberal arts school then decided to draft a policy curtailing the
bodily display of hostile or derogatory slogans.
   The new rules, which take effect this fall, could involve some
fast changing. For instance, a student might wear a risque T-shirt
in his own room, then cover up the offending portion on his walk
through the dormitory common area before reaching the campus lawn, a
free area.
   But Knable says the circuitous policy stems from efforts to
comply with free speech rights.
   Students in classrooms or dormitory common areas can't escape
looking at the offending message, so the T-shirts are banned, she
said. But dormitory rooms are private and general campus grounds
can't be controlled.
   ``We didn't expect that we could protect our students from all of
the manifestations of bigotry or prejudice,'' Knable said.
   The writing of the policy stirred lively debate on campus. The
final decision on what constitutes a derogatory slogan will be made
on a case-by-case basis, she said.
   ``We really tried to narrow the definition (of offensive) to
derogatory and demeaning,'' Knable said. ``There are a lot of ideas
that people will encounter on campuses in a diverse community that
will be offensive to them and we are not trying to protect people
from ideas,'' she said.
   Knable said the policy is intended to be more of a deterrent than
a disciplinary tool. If complaints are lodged with the dean of
students, the matter will be taken to a panel of faculty and
students. Possible penalties might be probation or community service.
   Knable said officials at Tufts, known for its foreign policy
department, don't expect to have to enforce their penalty frequently
this fall.
   ``It's not as if we are a campus in which we expect the most
virulent kind of things will happen and happen frequently, it's just
that we are still a part of the world,'' she said.

<HEAD>House Defeats Measure To Cut Aid For Philippines</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RUTH SINAI</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The House of Representatives voted Thursday to
uphold $1 billion in U.S. aid for an international effort to help
the Philippines, defeating a motion to cut the money by 60 percent.
   The action was taken during debate of a $23 billion, two-year
foreign aid bill, but its future was uncertain in light of delays by
the Senate in crafting its version of the foreign aid authorization.
   An amendment by Rep. Toby Roth, R-Wis., _ defeated 233-185 _
urged the House to limit the U.S. commitment to the Multinational
Aid Initiative (AID) to $400 million over two years, rather than $1
billion for an indefinite period as requested by the Bush
administration.
   Japan is expected to be the largest donor to the international
effort _ a project designed to ease the economic straits of Corazon
Aquino's fragile democratic government.
   Secretary of State James A. Baker III will represent the United
States at an international conference on Philippines economy in
Tokyo next week.
   ``If the Roth amendment is adopted, Secretary Baker will be
humiliated before all the other countries,'' said Rep. Stephen
Solarz, D-N.Y., a supporter of the aid plan.
   A cut in the U.S. commitment ``would pull the rug out from under
our efforts to get other countries'' on board the project, Solarz
added. It would also endanger democracy in the Philippines, where
Communist rebels are waging a guerrilla war to unseat the
government, he said.
   Roth argued that a large sum for the Philippines was
inappropriate at a time when U.S. domestic spending was being
reduced and the U.S. national debt was at a record high.

<HEAD>Federal Judge Gives Newspaper Right To Re-Create Trial Testimony</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ARLENE LEVINSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A federal judge has given The Boston Globe
permission to compel participants in a trial to re-create their
testimony because a clerk destroyed the official record, depriving
the newspaper of its legal access to the record.
   The unusual decision handed down Wednesday by U.S. District Judge
Joseph Tauro stems from the newspaper's efforts to obtain a tape
recording of the 90-minute drug trial in 1987 of then-police Officer
Salvador Aponte in West Roxbury District Court.
   The ruling allows the newspaper's lawyers to subpoena and,
through depositions, question the trial participants under oath.
   A Globe reporter was told that Aponte had been found guilty, but
then acquitted after a defense lawyer told the judge Aponte would be
fired if convicted.
   When the Globe requested the tape recording of the trial to check
out the tip, court clerks wouldn't provide it because a state
statute required courts to seal all verdicts of innocent.
   The newspaper filed suit in federal court challenging that
statute. Last year, Tauro ruled the law unconstitutional.
   The attorney general's office appealed Tauro's ruling but said it
would provide the Globe with the tape of Aponte's trial if the
appeal were rejected.
   The Globe won on the appeal this year, then found that the
recording of the trial was erased last November.
   Court clerks routinely reused audio tapes 13 months after trial,
James Mannering, assistant clerk for West Roxbury court, said
Thursday.
   The tape of the Aponte trial ``was reused in its normal course of
events,'' he said.
   Clerks have since been ordered to keep tapes for 2{ years after a
trial ends.
   E. Susan Garsh, a Globe attorney, said Tauro's ruling to
re-create the trial is a remedy to the loss of the newspaper's First
Amendment right to the trial record.
   While judges sometimes order evidence and even testimony
re-created for participants in a trial, Wantland Sandel Jr. of the
American Bar Association said Tauro seemed to be stretching the idea
in a novel way by using it to serve the public's right to know.
   ``I've never heard of this particular application of the concept
before,'' said Sandel from his Chicago office, where he is director
of the ABA's judicial services. ``It's really the public's right
that's being protected.''
   ``It's an interesting application of the unwritten theory that
the news media are quasi-government, in that they have not only the
right but almost the duty to represent the public in news gathering
and dissemination,'' Sandel added.
   Professor Donald Lively, who teaches constitutional and
communications law at the University of Toledo in Ohio, also called
the ruling rare if not unique. ``I sure have never heard of anything
like that,'' he said.
   ``That's really trying to bend over backward to promote the
spirit of the First Amendment,'' he said.
   But Lively said he was skeptical that it would work.
   ``I don't see how he can order those people to participate,'' he
said.
   Mary Coughlin, a clerk for Tauro, said that since the depositions
were ordered by the court, participants defying the order would risk
a charge of contempt. However, trial participants can file a motion
to quash the subpoena order, Ms. Coughlin said.
   Anthony Cardinale, who was Aponte's attorney during the trial,
was in court Thursday and could not be reached for comment.

   Vice President Dan Quayle said Thursday the
Strategic Defense Initiative will help, not hinder, U.S.-Soviet
efforts to curb long-range offensive missiles.
   Quayle criticized as ``misguided'' the House Armed Services
Committee's recommendation for a $1.1 billion cut in President
Bush's requested $4.6 billion budget for SDI.
   Quayle said the U.S. space-based defense shield could help the
two sides make progress toward a START treaty in Geneva ``and
facilitate its ratification by the Senate.''
   Quayle, in a speech to the American Defense Preparedness
Association, said the proliferation of ballistic missile launching
capability among smaller, less stable nations also makes it all the
more essential for the United States to develop and deploy strategic
defenses.
   ``The more progress we make toward offensive reductions, th more
we will need to rely on SDI to help us deter, or deal with, possible
Soviet cheating or breakout,'' Quayle said.
   ``SDI is an insurance policy for START,'' the vice president said.
   And it ``provides the American people with much-needed insurance
against an acidental or inadvertent attack or against a deliberate
launch by an irrational government,'' he said.

<HEAD>Britain Wants Chinese Troops Out of Central Hong Kong After 1997</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By EDITH M. LEDERER</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Britain will argue vigorously that China should
keep its army out of central Hong Kong after the colony reverts to
Chinese sovereignty in 1997, a British official said Thursday.
   The senior official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, briefed
reporters as Foreign Secretary Sir Geoffrey Howe prepared to travel
to Hong Kong on Saturday to reaffirm Britain's commitment to the
colony.
   Howe's schedule during his three-day visit includes meetings with
officials and residents.
   Concern among Hong Kong's population of 5.7 million about life
under Chinese rule has increased since June 3, when the Chinese
government ordered thousands of troops into Beijing to crush the
seven-week pro-democracy movement.
   ``We shall be arguing very strongly that it would be very
misguided of China to put their troops in the center of Hong Kong,''
the British official said.
   Under the 1984 Joint Declaration, the British pact with China
that guarantees at least 50 years of autonomy for Hong Kong under
Chinese rule, authorities in Hong Kong are responsible for public
order.
   ``This is not the responsibility of people in khaki uniforms.
That is what we have to underline in thick, thick ink,'' the
official said.
   Chinese troops stationed in Hong Kong have to abide by Hong Kong
law, the official added.
   He said the questions of how many Chinese troops would be allowed
in Hong Kong and where they would be stationed are still subject to
negotiation.
   Britain will raise the issues during the next round of talks on
Hong Kong. Britain postponed the July meeting because of the
crackdown on the pro-democracy movement.
   ``No decision has been made on when the meetings will be resumed
but I would think certainly before the end of the year, maybe in the
autumn,'' the official said.
   Under the Joint Declaration, meetings are to be held three times
a year and Britain plans to stick ``to the letter of the agreement,
if we want China to do the same,'' the official said.
   Since the crackdown began, some Hong Kong residents have called
for the Joint Declaration to be torn up.
   The official said Britain has no intention of doing that but
wants to change a few things in a draft constitution under which
China will govern capitalist Hong Kong as a ``special administrative
region'' after the British withdraw.
   The Times of London quoted a report by the powerful House of
Commons foreign affairs committee as saying the British government
should mobilize an international effort to resettle Hong Kong
residents should China violate the Joint Declaration.
   The committee recommends that limited categories of residents be
given the right to settle in Britain, but rejects such rights for
all 3.25 million British passport holders, the newspaper said.
   The report, to be published Friday, also calls for an
acceleration of the timetable for introducing democracy in the
colony so it is firmly established before 1997, The Times said.

<HEAD>Bush Says He'll Work to Raise Congress' Pay, Revamp Campaign Financing</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RITA BEAMISH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Bush, reviving a topic buried by
public outcry four months ago, promised Thursday to work with
Congress to get members a pay raise. He didn't say how big the raise
should be.
   In a speech focused on another prickly issue _ campaign finance
reform _ the president mentioned the pay-hike question only briefly.
   He said he would send Congress legislation in a few days seeking
to ban the outside income senators and representatives earn from
speaking engagements, a restriction many have said they would accept
only if accompanied by higher salaries.
   Bush said he would ``work with Congress on the development of
details for increasing the pay of those in Congress as well as other
senior employees of the executive branch.''
   He already has endorsed a 25 percent pay increase for judges, and
the legislation he sends to Capitol Hill on outside income will
include a specific increase amount for senior officials, White House
counsel Boyden Gray said. He refused to disclose the amount.
   Bush described his campaign finance package _ which includes
provisions to abolish most political action committees _ as an
effort to cut special interest influence in politics and make
campaigns more fair by decreasing the significant advantages of
incumbents.
   Since a majority of incumbents are Democratic, however, the
proposals have the effect of helping the Republican Party's chances
to improve its standing.
   ``We need reforms that curtail special interest influence,
enhance the role of the individual and strengthen the parties,''
Bush said to an audience of congressional interns. ``We must do more
to truly clean up the system.''
   His proposals also include curtailing congressional franking
privileges, which he said ``pay for mass mailings that amount to
political advertising,'' and doing away with gerrymandering, the
drawing of crazy-quilt congressional districts to help certain
candidates.
   The president declined to endorse public financing of
congressional campaigns or overall spending limits, which have been
urged by Democratic officials as well as private groups.
   Democratic National Committee Chairman Ronald H. Brown said that
in failing to call for spending limits, ``the president's campaign
finance bill ought to be labeled the Fat Cat Protection Act of 1989.
He wants to make it easier to give Republican candidates access to
big money contributors.''
   Bob Dreyfuss, spokesman for the advocacy group Public Citizen,
said that in dismissing public financing and spending limits, Bush
``tends to really allow the people with money to have undue
influence in politics.''
   House Speaker Thomas S. Foley, D-Wash., has already promised the
House will produce an ethics and campaign reform package this
session, and he said Bush was joining the bandwagon late.
   ``I want to say this as kindly as I can: We welcome the
president's involvement, but he is not leading this matter. He is
joining an issue which the Democrats and the congressional
Republicans ... have been participating in, and actively, since the
first of the year,'' he said.
   Bush said public financing would exclude individuals from the
political process by denying them the opportunity to contribute, and
spending limits would discourage them from contributing.
   Congress has repeatedly rejected proposals for campaign finance
changes. But Republican supporters from Capitol Hill said they hoped
Bush's leadership and heightened public opinion on the issue would
change that this time around.
   Bush proposed to bar corporations, unions and trade associations
from financially sponsoring political action committees, effectively
abolishing most of the PACs that contributed more than $151 million
to congressional candidates in the 1987-88 election cycle.
   That move, Bush said, would help ``free our electoral system from
the grip of special interests.''
   He also proposed:
   _Reducing the per-candidate contribution limit for the remaining
PACs from the current $5,000 to $2,500.
   _Banning a practice known as ``bundling'' in which a group
gathers individuals' contributions and delivers them to candidates,
rather than having the individual donate directly.
   _Requiring full disclosure of ``soft money'' contributions and
spending.
   ``Soft money'' refers generally to corporate and labor money that
is barred for federal candidates but finds its want into the system
when the funds are contributed to political parties, which then help
the candidates.
   Touching on an area that has bedeviled the Federal Election
Commission for three years with no resolution, Bush called for
guidelines on how to differentiate between such money and funds
raised within federal standards for generic activity such as voter
registration and get-out-the-vote efforts that benefit both federal
and non-federal candidates.
   Bush would decrease the advantage of incumbents by:
   _Restricting franking privileges, which allow members of Congress
to send mail to their constituents free. Blanket constituency
mailings and newsletters, for instance, would be banned.
   _Curtailing gerrymandering methods of drawing political district
lines to benefit one political party or group over another. The
districts would have to be drawn according to geographical and
community boundaries, said a senior administration official.
   ``No single factor is more important in restoring competitive
elections,'' Bush said, than doing away with the crazy quilt
district maps that have been drawn in some states to group voters in
a blocks that benefit one party.
   The redistricting is controlled by state legislatures, 28 of
which are controlled by Democrats to eight by Republicans. Thirteen
are split, and Nebraska has a nonpartisan one-chamber legislature.
   _More than doubling the amount of money that political parties
are allowed to give to their candidates for House and Senate. For
Senate races, the amount currently ranges from $92,000 to some $1.5
million, depending on state population. Since incumbents are able to
attract far more money than challengers in private contributions;
this provision would mean more to the cash-strapped GOP challengers.
   _Banning carrying over campaign funds from one election to the
next, thus requiring congressional candidates to return leftover
funds to the contributors or give the money to the political parties

<HEAD>National Party Leader Commits Whites to Sharing Power with Blacks</HEAD>

   National Party leader F. W. de
Klerk declared ``a new chapter'' in South African history Thursday
and wept before committing the white rulers to sharing limited power
with the black majority.
   Conservatives among the nation's 5 million whites condemned the
plan as a sham to surrender control to blacks. Clive Derby-Lewis of
the Conservative Party likened the plan to ``the sales talk of an
unscrupulous car dealer.''
   Spokesmen for the 28 million disenfranchised blacks said the
proposal uses ``new labels for old dogmas'' as a ploy to retain
white rule and impress foreign leaders. Anglican Archbishop Desmond
Tutu said the proposal would not do away with apartheid.
   Tears brimmed over de Klerk's eyes as 1,500 delegates gave him a
standing ovation when he opened the governing party's congress with
promises the Nationalists, responsible for 41 years of apartheid
rule, can lead South Africa back into the international community by
ending many racist practices.
   ``We have reached a great moment of truth in the history of our
country. A new chapter is to be written,'' he said at Pretoria City
Hall.
   But de Klerk resolutely avoided specifics. He said the form of a
future government and constitution must be negotiated.
   Although the party's manifesto seeks to avoid using race to
define political groups, de Klerk clung to the principle, promising
the Nationalists will ``not forsake the whites'' and declaring
``group security is a prerequisite to constructive cooperation.''
   The Congress of South African Trade Unions, the nation's largest,
said:
   ``We are insulted, if not surprised, that the NP thinks that the
people of South Africa will be so easily fooled by new labels for
old dogmas.
   ``The bottom line is that (de Klerk) and the NP remain wedded to
white minority rule in the form of group rights.''
   The congress, beginning its campaign for Sept. 6 parliamentary
elections after which de Klerk is designated to replace President
P.W. Botha, adopted an ``action plan'' that envisions giving blacks
a direct vote in national affairs within five years.
   It calls for removing criminal penalties for violating laws on
segregated housing, more government subsidies for multiracial
schools and a bill of rights.
   The Nationalists' declared goal is to provide blacks with a
national political voice in a way that preserves rights of whites
and other minorities. De Klerk made it clear the plan will not
encompass majority rule.
   But the reform proposals could cost the Nationalists
parliamentary seats to the pro-apartheid Conservative Party.
   De Klerk, who just returned from a visit with European leaders
and is expected to meet President Bush next month, sees reform as a
way to end South Africa's isolation and the economic punishment it
has brought.
   ``Our cause is just and the doors must be open. We will not have
to go crawling back. We will walk in proudly and with our heads held
high,'' he said to uproarious applause.
   A less enthusiastic ovation followed his brief tribute to the
absent Botha. Relations between the two men have been strained since
March, when Botha resigned as party chief following a stroke and was
shocked to find party leaders also wanted him to resign from the
presidency.
   The congress clearly signaled the end of the Botha era _ from new
party logos and slogans festooning the hall to de Klerk's blunt
statement at a news conference:
   ``President Botha is no longer active in politics. He prefers it
that way and we respect his wishes.''
   He went on to tell reporters: ``We still have one big challenge
which we face. We've already received a mandate from our (white)
electorate for power-sharing with blacks. The final test is to work
out a system which will enable us to do that on the basis of
non-domination.''
   He said the government will not scrap two cornerstones of
apartheid _ the Population Registration Act requiring race
classification and the Group Areas Act designating segregated
residential areas _ unless they are replaced by other protections
for those who want to live separately.
   Archbishop Tutu, winner of the 1984 Nobel Peace Prize for his
opposition to apartheid, said on a visit to Denmark that no
effective change can take place in South Africa while the Population
Registration Act remains.
   He said the government ``wouldn't remove that, because the basis
of everything is still race, and power still resides with the white
race.''
   In London, a leader of the outlawed African National Congress
guerrilla movement called the platform an advance, but from a wrong
position.
   ``It's a step forward ... but the position is wrong because it
continues to define people as black and white and not as the people
of South Africa,'' said international affairs secretary Thabo Mbeki.

   A former doctor convicted in a $3.7 million
Medicaid fraud has been sentenced to five to 10 years in prison.
   Surinder Singh Panshi also was ordered to pay $300,000 in
restitution by the trial judge, Supreme Court Justice Herbert A.
Posner, at the sentencing Wednesday. He pleaded guilty in March to
127 felony counts.
   Panshi and his father, Gurdial Singh Panshi, along with eight
other people and three medical laboratories controlled by Panshi,
were indicted in August.
   Panshi, 40, set up companies that collected blood from the
down-and-out for $10 a pint and used each pint to generate as much
as $2,000 in Medicaid billings for expensive but unnecessary, said
Edward J. Kuriansky, the state's special prosecutor for Medicaid
fraud.
   Three salesmen had entered guilty pleas before Panshi and
received sentences ranging from five years on probation to as much
as 4{ years in prison, plus a total of $495,000 in restitution.
   Panshi's father and five other defendants are fugitives,
Kuriansky said.

<HEAD>Bankruptcy Examiner Sees No Hope for Eastern As Major Carrier</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A court-appointed bankruptcy examiner told
Congress Thursday that the only alternatives for strikebound Eastern
Airlines are a reduction in its size or liquidation.
   David I. Shapiro said at a crowded hearing that a plan by a
Chicago businessman to take over the airline in partnership with
Eastern's unions and with temporary management by former Defense
Secretary Frank C. Carlucci is not viable.
   Carlucci and businessman Joseph Ritchie, however, told the House
Public Works and Transportation aviation subcommittee that their
plan offered the only hope for restoring Eastern as a major airline.
   The subcommittee, in calling the hearing, had said its goal was
to find a way to rebuild Eastern, which was the nation's sixth
largest airline prior to the March walkout of its mechanics, pilots
and flight attendants.
   The panel is also examining the role of the New York bankruptcy
court, which has had authority over Eastern since the airline filed
for reorganization under bankruptcy laws after the strike.
   ``These past months have left me with the reluctant but firm
conviction that only two practical alternative remain in this
case,'' said Shapiro, who represents the bankruptcy court. ``The
first is a reorganization plan premised on a smaller Eastern
Airlines; the second is liquidation.''
   Eastern's management, which filed for reorganization under
bankruptcy laws after the strike, has announced plans to sell of
$1.8 billion in assets and operate the airline at a smaller scale.
   Ritchie's plan would add about $200 million in new debt to the
airline and restore its full operations.
   ``I intend to use my energies to oppose liquidation and promote
the best reorganization plan possible,'' said Shapiro. He said he is
continuing to meet with unions to try to get them to accept the idea
that Eastern's operations must be scaled down to survive.
   Shapiro said the Ritchie plan to purchase Eastern presented no
firm offer to Frank Lorenzo's Texas Air in payment for the airline
and failed to present an operational plan that would keep the
airline flying.
   Carlucci said he is still willing to act as an interim chief
executive of the airline if Ritchie's offer is accepted.
   ``This approach is the only one that has a chance of restoring
Eastern to its once proud status,'' said Carlucci, who was defense
secretary in the latter part of the Reagan administration.
   Ritchie, president of Chicago Research &amp; Trading group, said his
plan would restore Eastern as ``a major competitor in the airline
industry.'' It includes $100 million in new money from Ritchie, the
unions and other investors and $200 million or more in new financing.
   Lorenzo rejected Ritchie's earlier union-backed attempt to buy
the airline, along with several other offers. Carlucci said he had
agreed to serve as interim chief executive officer of the airline
because Ritchie's plan appeared to have the support of both
employees and creditors.
   Several committee members said they feared that Lorenzo planned
to sell off all the airline's assets once he is allowed to
reorganize.

   The economics minister reacted to
the second chemical weapons scandal in six months by declaring
Thursday the government will devise laws to eliminate such deals by
West German companies.
   Prosecutors said they had opened a criminal investigation of a
Duesseldorf company that allegedly contracted to deliver more than
250 tons of a mustard gas component to Iran.
   Officials have said that the Rheineisen Chemical Products
company, run by an Iranian family, was contracted to arrange the
shipment by Iran's state-owned industrial organization Vezarate Defa.
   A company official, Mojtar Ashtari, said Thursday night in an
interview with the West German TV network ZDF that the company had
complied with export regulations before making the deal final.
   ``We were given the green light by the export licensing
authorities for this shipment,'' said Ashtari, a buyer for
Rheineisen who helped arange the deal.
   He said Rheineisen had no indication the chemical would be used
to produce poison gas, adding that the shipment was halted and would
be returned to Bombay, India, were it originated.
   Six months ago, an international furor arose over involvement by
West German firms in building a plant in Libya the United States
said was designed to produce chemical weapons. Libya said it was a
pharmaceuticals factory.
   After disclosure of the Libyan project, Chancellor Helmut Kohl's
government said it it would take legal steps to prevent a recurrence.
   On Thursday, Economics Minister Helmut Haussmann said he would
make sure there are no ``loopholes'' in the new measures.
   ``Such corrections are completely possible as a result of further
discussions of the law,'' he said in an interview with Saarland
state radio.
   The government has expanding the list of weapons-related products
that require a special export permit, and also is trying to cut down
on transactions conducted by West German companies outside the
country.
   In addition to the chemical deals, West German firms also are
said to be involved in illegal shipments of arms to several foreign
countries.
   Parliament will consider more regulations, including larger fines
and longer prison terms for violators, when it returns from summer
recess.
   ``In the future we will be able to catch and punish such cases,
and eliminate them from West Germany,'' Haussmann said.
   Federal authorities have arrested Juergen Hippenstiel-Imhausen,
whose company Imhausen-Chemie allegedly played a centrol in building
the Libyan plant at Rabta, south of Tripoli.
   As in the case of the Libyan plant, the United States gave Bonn
the first tip about the scheduled shipment of the mustard gas
chemicals to Iran.
   Rheineisen is run by an Iranian family, company attorney Georg
Greeven told reporters.
   Rolf Chanteaux, chief state prosecutor in Duesseldorf, told The
Associated Press on Thursday he had begun a criminal investigation
of the company.
   ``The facts show that the Rheineisen firm agreed on a delivery
contract for the chemical, rather than just a broker's contract,''
he said. ``A special permit is needed for a delivery contract.''
   Chanteaux said the company had not obtained a permit for the
chemical, which was to be delivered to Iran from a company in India.
   Rheineisen says it canceled the contract for arranging delivery
of 257 tons of thionyl chloride to Iran from a company in India
called Transpec, and there would be no shipment.
   Under an agreement reached on June 1, Rheineisen was to receive
$360,000 from Iran. Rheineisen has said West German customs
officials assured the company there was nothing wrong with shipping
thionyl chloride to Iran.
   Both Iran and Iraq used poison gas in their eight-year war, which
began in September 1980. A cease-fire was reached in August.

<HEAD>President Asks That Indian Troops Stop Fighting Tamil Rebels</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DEXTER CRUEZ</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>COLOMBO, Sri Lanka (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Ranasinghe Premadasa, unable
to get India to withdraw its peacekeeping troops, now has asked that
they stop fighting Tamil rebels.
   Premadasa made the appeal the day after his government and the
Tamil Tigers, the main rebel group, agreed to stop fighting.
   At least 40,000 Indian soldiers are stationed in the
Tamil-dominated north and east under a civil war peace plan India
worked out in 1987 with the last president, Junius Jayewardene.
   Continued deployment of the Indian troos has become a contentious
issue between Colombo and New Delhi.
   Last month, Premadasa asked India to withdraw by the end of July,
but India refused. Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi's government said a
hasty withdrawal could lead to even more ethnic violence.
   A government statement issued Thursday said: ``The president of
Sri Lanka has ... requested the prime minister of India to ensure''
that the Indian peacekeeping force ``does not take any action
against the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam.''
   Other militant Tamil groups, who gave up the fight for a separate
state in exchange for limited autonomy, support the Indian presence.
   Arthur Ranasinghe, deputy information minister, told reporters:
``If Indian troops refuse to leave by the end of next month, we will
send them back. India might bomb us or destroy all of us, but we
will fight back to the last man.
   ``If India tries to be here by force, without our consent and the
consent of our people, we will not tolerate it.''
   Tamils, nearly all of whom are Hindus, make up 18 percent of Sri
Lanka's 16 million people and claim discrimination by the majority
Sinhalese, most of whom are Buddhists.
   Militants began fighting in 1083 for an independent Tamil
homeland called Eelam in the north and east. More than 10,000 people
have been killed in the civil war and in violance by Sinhalese
extremists who want no concessions to Tamils.
   India became involved because it is the major power in the
region, is overwhelmingly Hindu and has a Tamil population of 60
million concentrated across the Palk Strait from Sri Lanka.
   The soldiers were deployed in July 1987 to accept the surrender
of arms by the rebels, but the Tamil Tigers refused to go along with
the peace plan.
   Talks between the Tigers and the government began last month
after Premadasa offered amnesty to Tamil rebels who gave up their
weapons.
   On Wednesday, the rebels and government announced an agreement to
stop fighting and settle their differences by negotiation.

   A man was arrested and charged Thursday with
the poisoning of the centuries-old Treaty Oak tree during what
police described as a ritual.
   The culprit may have been trying to use magic to cast a spell to
protect a woman or because of a rivalry over a woman, according a
report in Wednesday's Austin-American Statesman, which cited sources
it did not identify.
   Police Sgt. John Jones said in the arrest warrant that Paul
Cullen poisoned the Treaty Oak ``in a ritual'' with the herbicide
Velpar. The warrant said Cullen got the herbicide from his job at a
farm and ranch supply business.
   Cullen, 45, was arrested in Elroy, a town south of Austin, and
was held in lieu of $20,000 bond, police said. He was charged with
criminal mischief causing damage of more than $20,000, which is a
second-degree felony punishable by a maximum of 20 years in prison.
   Judge Jon Wisser said that before he signed a warrant for
Cullen's arrest, investigators told him Cullen had checked out books
from the public library on black magic and the occult.
   Jones said in the affidavit that Cullen drove around west Austin
looking for a live oak tree on which to apply the Velpar.
   Legend says Stephen F. Austin, a founding father of Texas, signed
a treaty with the Indians under the oak's branches.
   Even though The Handbook of Texas, a guidebook that includes
state history, says the story has little foundation, the tree
occupies a special place in Texans' hearts.
   Couples have been married under its branches and since the
poisoning, scores of visitors have left get-well messages in front
of a roped-off area that limits access to the ailing oak.
   A yellow ribbon also was tied around the base of the 50-foot tree
this week as a bright reminder of people's concern.
   A reward of $11,000 was offered for information leading to the
conviction of the person who poisoned the tree. DuPont, which makes
Velpar, put up $10,000 of the reward, and the Texas Forestry
Association added $1,000.
   Dallas billionaire H. Ross Perot also has pledged money and given
advice in the effort to save the tree.
   The Treaty Oak is struggling to survive the poisoning. Since it
was discovered early this month, state and national experts have
recommended several forms of treatment, but it was not known if the
tree would live.

   The growth in Americans' standard of living
lagged behind other major industrialized nations last year despite a
surge in U.S. export sales, according to a report released Thursday.
   The report, prepared by the Council on Competitiveness, said the
United States had failed to keep pace with its major trading
partners over the past 16 years, losing additional ground in 1988.
   The findings came from the council's second annual
``competitiveness index,'' an effort to measure U.S. standing in the
world economy in terms that have meaning to the average American.
   The council tracks competitiveness in four areas _ living
standards, worker productivity, the U.S. share of the world export
market and American investment in education and non-defense research
and development.
   Those categories were chosen because of their relationship to
America's changing fortunes in the world economy.
   U.S. investment must keep pace with expenditures of other nations
to boost American productivity, a measure of output per hour of work.
   Rising productivity is needed to make American products
competitive on world markets, thus lowering America's huge trade
deficit and providing the income growth to boost American living
standards.
   While the council found that the growth in America's living
standard was lagging behind other countries, the United States still
had the second highest living standard. West Germany is first.
   In 1988, the standard of living, defined as economic output on a
per capita basis, was $15,250 in West Germany, $13,840 in the United
States and $11,820 in Japan.
   The competitiveness index found that America had made progress in
trade and investment last year, compared with its major trading
partners, but had lost ground in living standards and productivity.
   The index measures U.S. performance against the six other leading
industrial countries _ Japan, West Germany, Britain, France, Italy
and Canada.
   Leaders from the seven nations meet each year for an economic
summit. The next meeting is July 14-16 in Paris.
   ``The 1988 index shows that American products are now capturing a
growing share of world markets, but the downside is that other
nations are still outperforming us in terms of standard of living
and productivity growth,'' said council chairman John Young, head of
Hewlett-Packard Co.
   Lawrence Chimerine, an economic adviser to the WEFA Group, a
consulting company that helped prepare the index, said the need to
improve America's productivity was emphasized by a separate report
Thursday. That report showed that the United States widened its lead
as the world's largest debtor country with a net debt position of
$532.5 billion last year.
   The net debt figure means that foreigners own more in U.S. assets
than Americans own in foreign assets.
   ``Our foreign debt burden will become bigger if our productivity
does not go up and allow us to compete more effectively in global
markets,'' Chimerine said. ``If we don't get our productivity growth
back up again, there is no way we will see our living standards
improve.''
   The U.S. living standard grew 3.1 percent in 1988. However, that
lagged behind a 5.1 percent increase in living standards in Japan
and a 3.8 percent increase for the other six summit nations.
   Because of those developments, the council's standard of living
index dropped from 90.3 percent to 89.7 percent of 1972, the base
year of the index.
   Among the report's other conclusions:
   _In 1988, the U.S. export boom fueled a rise in the trade index
from 76.9 percent to 89.6 percent of its 1972 base, reflecting a
partial rebound in America's share of the world export market. The
U.S. share of world exports was 10 percent last year, still below a
high of 14 percent in 1974.
   _Productivity, the output per worker, fell to 87.4 percent of its
1972 base, down slightly from 87.8 percent, reflecting faster
productivity improvements in the other six industrial countries.
   _Long-term U.S. investment rose from 97.5 percent to 100.4
percent, the only measurement doing better than the 1972 base year.
This reflected gains in education spending, research and development
and spending on plants and equipment.
   The council, founded in 1986, is composed of officials from
business, labor and higher education who are trying to improve the
ability of American companies to compete in world markets.

<HEAD>House Committee Approves Moratorium on Coastal Oil Exploration</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By H. JOSEF HEBERT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Legislation calling for a year-long moratorium
on oil exploration along vast stretches off America's coast _
including New England and Alaska _ won approval Thursday from a key
House committee where members repeatedly cited concern about
possible oil spills.
   The Bush administration immediately promised to fight the curbs,
probably in the Senate, saying mandatory prohibitions on off-shore
oil exploration would stifle badly needed domestic petroleum
development.
   ``We believe they (congressionally-imposed bans) are a delaying
tactic,'' said Interior Secretary Manuel Lujan.
   The action by the House Appropriations Committee on a fiscal 1990
spending bill for the Interior Department would put a temporary halt
to oil exploration in Alaska's Bristol Bay, one of the nation's
premier fishing centers, where the government already has sold a
half dozen exploratory leases for $94 million.
   The legislation also would extend or impose prohibitions on oil
or gas exploration off California, off the Everglades of
southwestern Florida, in the Georges Bank off New England, and along
a 50-mile wide coastal strip that stretches from Rhode Island to
Maryland.
   ``This is a critical victory at a critical time,'' said Rep. Leon
Panetta, D-Calif., chairman of the House Budget Committee. ``The
message is clear. We will not tolerate more tragic oil spills.''
   An exploratory drilling moratorium already has been in effect on
leases in many of those areas, but the ban would be extended to the
center coast of California and to the mid-Atlantic region under the
legislation. It also would ensure that no exploratory activity is
taken before October 1990, the end of the next fiscal year.
   The $11.6 billion Interior money bill, which prohibits any money
being spent on oil lease in the areas cited, cleared the House
committee by a voice vote after two amendments aimed at softening
the impact of the oil exploration moratorium were defeated by votes
of 29-22 and 28-22.
   The first amendment would have deleted reference to Bristol Bay,
while the second would have allowed a variety of ``pre-lease''
activities off the California coast, although actual exploratory
drilling would still have been put on hold.
   Opponents of the Bristol Bay drilling ban argued that oil
development in the pristine Alaska waters _ home for a $1 billion
fishing industry _ is needed to keep America free of having to
depend increasingly on oil imports.
   ``What we're doing in the name of the environment is cutting off
our energy sources ... We're going to have brown-outs and then there
will be black-outs,'' argued Rep. Bob Livingston, R-La.
   Rep. Ralph Regula, R-Ohio, maintained that the danger from oil
spills was not from off-shore drilling, but from tanker traffic,
prompting Rep. Sidney Yates, D-Ill., to point out that tankers
likely will transport the oil that would come from Bristol Bay.
   Yates, chairman of the Interior subcommittee that had recommended
the moratorium, cited the devastation left by the Exxon Valdez oil
spill last March.
   ``We've seen what's happend in Prince William Sound,'' declared
Yates, adding that the same potential for damage is present in other
coastal areas.
   Rep. Silvio Conte, R-Mass., described having on numerous
occasions gone fishing off the southern Alaska coast and said the
oil damage from the Exxon spill ``brings tears to my eyes.''
   ``We've got to wait,'' declared Conte in arguing for a moratrium
on further off-shore oil exploration.
   Alaska's congressional delegation and its governor have strongly
urged for a temporary halt in oil exploration in Bristol Bay in
light of the Exxon spill until greater assurances can be made that
the environment will be protected.
   ``If the Exxon Valdez oil spill proved one thing, it's that the
current ability to respond to spills in open seas is inadequate at
best,'' said Alaska Gov. Steve Cowper in praising the House
committee action.
   ``I'm not willing to roll the dice on development in Bristol Bay
and threaten the livelihood of hundrds of Alaskans and the resources
on which they depend,'' the governor said in a statement issued in
Juneau.
   The Interior Deparment sold exploratory leases for a half dozen
sites in Bristol Bay last year. The legislation would call for
repurchasing those leases. The bay is considered by experts to be
even more vulnerable to pollution from an oil spill than Prince
William Sound.
   ``This is no less than a major victory for the environment,''
said Lisa Speer of the Natural Resources Defense Counsel, a private
environmental group, reacting to the House committee action.
   But Interior's Lujan maintained that the moratorium on offshore
drilling does little ``to address the real issue'' which is tanker
safety, while it could stifle domestic oil development.
   An Interior spokesman, Steve Goldstein, said that Lujan intends
to personally campaign to overturn the moratorium provisions in the
House bill in the coming weeks.
   President Bush earlier this year ordered lease sales off Southern
and Northern California as well as off southwestern Florida
postponed, pending an environmental review. A report on that review
is to be issued to the president by the end of the year.
   After that, oil exploration would be free to continue if given
the goahead by Interior, unless Congress determines otherwise.

<HEAD>Reputed Mobster Gene Gotti Goes to Jail</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Reputed mobster and convicted heroin trafficker
Gene Gotti went to jail Thursday, seven years after he was arrested
on charges of running a major heroin operation.
   With eight minutes to spare before a 10 a.m. deadline set by a
judge, Gotti and co-defendant John Carneglia _ both wearing nylon
jogging suits and sneakers _ stepped out of a maroon Lincoln and
swaggered into the federal courthouse in Brooklyn, where they
surrendered to U.S. marshals.
   ``Afraid we weren't going to show up?'' Gotti, the brother of
reputed Gambino crime family boss John Gotti, joked to his lawyer.
   U.S. District Judge John R. Bartels on Wednesday revoked their $1
million bail after a three-day hearing, saying both men continued to
pose a danger to the community, and ordered the pair to await their
July 7 sentencing in jail.
   Prosecutors maintained that Gotti and Carneglia continued to
traffic in heroin and deal in Gambino family affairs after their
conviction.
   Prosecutors asked that they be jailed immediately after the bail
hearing in U.S. District Court, but Bartels gave them an additional
night to be with their families and pick up the personal items they
will need during their stay at the Metropolitan Correctional Center
in Manhattan.
   ``His mood is hopeful. Certainly, he's not happy about going to
jail. No one is,'' said Gotti's lawyer, Ronald Fischetti.
   The two men will appeal their convictions, but that process could
take up to a year and their lawyers said it was unlikely Gotti and
Carneglia could gain release on bail while awaiting a decision.
   Gotti, 42, and Carneglia, 44, were found guilty on May 22 of
running a multimillion-dollar heroin ring. Two earlier trials in
federal court ended in mistrials.
   Gotti, described by law enforcers as a capo or captain in the
Gambino family, faces up to 50 years in prison. Carneglia, a reputed
soldier in the Gambino group, faces 55 years.

<HEAD>HUD Probe: Buffalo Broker Kept Thousands</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: SUBS 9th graf, ``Richard Tyksinski,'' with 2 grafs bgng: ``But

<BYLINE>By KIM I. MILLS</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A onetime broker for the Department of Housing
and Urban Development in Buffalo, N.Y., withheld payments,
overbilled and paid himself advances, so when he died in 1987 he
owed the department almost $73,000, according to a federal audit.
   After Bernard A. Brady died, his widow continued to withdraw
money from his HUD escrow account, according to the audit, obtained
under the Freedom of Information Act.
   Brady had been a closing agent on the sale of single-family HUD
homes and manager of at least one HUD rental property, said the
audit by HUD's office of inspector general. He died May 10, 1987,
but while the audit was being conducted, his widow, Maureen, somehow
withdrew $20,100 from the HUD account in her husband's name, said A.
Paul Kane, HUD's regional inspector general for audit, who oversaw
the probe.
   ``We don't know whether she was forging the checks ... or whether
they had a book of pre-signed checks,'' Kane said in an interview
from HUD's Region II office in New York City.
   Brady had comingled personal and HUD funds in the account, Kane
said Thursday. No criminal charges against Mrs. Brady are
anticipated since she recently agreed through her lawyer to pay the
$24,832 HUD says she and her husband's estate owe, Kane said.
   ``We expect to get it all back,'' he said.
   The escrow account was eventually frozen, but HUD has been unable
to get at the money, believed to be $48,139, according to Kane. The
audit was completed Jan. 19 and covered the period from Jan. 1,
1985, to Dec. 31, 1987.
   ``We've been trying to find out from the field office whether or
not the money has been turned over. We haven't been able to get an
answer,'' Kane said.
   But Joseph B. Lynch, manager of the Buffalo field office, said
Thursday the bank has finally agreed to turn over the money,
although it is not clear when.
   ``The auditors ... had some difficulty in getting the bank
initially to release the accounts and canceled checks and finally we
had to resort to a subpoena,'' he said. ``The reason became apparent
later on. When this Mr. Brady died, a death certificate was
submitted to the bank and his widow continued to draw down on that
account, apparently forging his name on some checks. So there was
some liability on the part of th bank, that's our feeling.''
   Kane blamed the field office for not keeping closer tabs on what
Brady was doing, and said it was the lawyer for the Brady estate,
Harold Fein, who brought the bank account problems to the local
office's attention. The field office then called in the inspector
general, Kane said.
   ``The amount of activity involved with Brady was not that great
so it was not likely for us to look at him if it had not been
brought to our attention,'' Kane said.
   Fein did not immediately return a phone call Thursday.
   Brady was not alone in using HUD money as if it were his own
during the laissez-faire administration of housing Secretary Samuel
Pierce. Cases are turning up almost daily where HUD accountants,
brokers and others apparently misused or stole millions of dollars
from the department.
   Bernard A. Brady, a lifelong Buffalo resident, had been in
business for himself for 32 years, as a fee appraiser for the
Federal Housing Administration, an expert witness for the courts, an
apartment manager for a HUD-owned property and from 1974 to 1981, a
HUD management agent, according to his obituary in The Buffalo News.
He was 58 when he died.
   Brady also appraised real estate for the state Department of
Transportation, a bank, Surrogates Court and the city of Buffalo. He
attended the University of Buffalo law school.
   As a HUD closing agent and broker, according to the federal
audit, Brady:
   _Did not turn over $97,371 from the sale of six HUD-owned
single-family houses.
   _Did not forward to HUD $12,407 in rental income collected from
tenants in a HUD-owned property.
   _Overcharged HUD $2,460 for wire transfers, sometimes
triple-billing the agency for wires never sent.
   _Wrote checks from the HUD account either to himself or his wife
totaling almost $44,000.
   According to the audit, 18 checks totaling $20,100 and payable to
Mrs. Brady were drawn from the account after Brady's death, the
investigation found.
   For the 18 months from April 1985 to September 1986, Brady did
not submit a single monthly accounting report to the department, as
required under his contract.
   At the same time as he was shortchanging HUD, Brady was not paid
some $26,000 in monthly management fees from the department, the
audit found. He also wired the same $12,500 in net sales proceeds
twice to the U.S. Treasury. And he overpaid HUD several hundred
dollars in other cases.
   Subtracting what HUD owed Brady, the auditors concluded that
Brady owed the department $72,970.66.

<TEXT>
   Alan Woods, administrator of the Agency for
International Development (AID) in the Reagan and Bush
administrations and a strong advocate of linking U.S. assistance to
economic reform, died Thursday of cancer at the age of 43.
   He was also a former deputy U.S. trade representative and a
proponent of open trade policies.
   In one of his last appearances, Woods on May 12 argued for
concentrating U.S. aid assistance on what he called ``sustainable
development.'' Instead of being given away, Woods said, aid should
be a temporary bridge to private support and ``self-sustained
growth.''
   In the trade post, which Woods held from 1985 to 1987, he was the
Reagan administration's chief strategist in dealing with Congress on
trade legislation and the lead negotiator with Canada on lumber and
also on U.S. market access to Portugal and Spain.
   Then at AID, beginning in 1987, Woods promoted market-oriented
economic policies, believing they and open trade held the key to
progress, in developed and undeveloping countries alike.
   Woods, whose first name was Michael, was a native of Mexico, Mo.,
and served in 1973-74 as chief of staff for Christopher Bond, then
the governor of Missouri and now a U.S. senator.
   In the Nixon administration Woods was the deputy director of the
office of presidential personnel and later become assistant press
secretary. In the Ford administration he was a Pentagon spokesman
and an adviser on the budget.
   His wife, Cameron, and two young daugters, Alexandra and
Caroline, survive him, as well as his parents, Donald and Darlene
Woods of Mexico, Mo.

<HEAD>Legislators Grill Cabinet Nominees About Pollution, Shortages</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ANDREW KATELL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Cabinet nominees, who used to need only Kremlin
approval, were quizzed and harangued by the rambunctious new Soviet
legislature Thursday on matters ranging from the toilet paper and
soap shortages to pollution.
   After questioning and debate, the 542-member Supreme Soviet
approved Alexandra P. Biryukova as a deputy premier in charge of the
government social agency and Vladimir K. Gusev as a deputy premier
overseeing chemicals and timber. Both were incumbents.
   Ms. Biryukova, head of the Bureau for Social Development since
October, faced questions about why women so often are given
physically demanding jobs and put on the night shift.
   Women fill many menial jobs in the Soviet Union, from shoveling
asphalt for road repairs to clearing the snow from Red Square in
winter.
   Lawmakers also complained about a shortage of furniture and
school supplies.
   Ms. Biryukova, the only woman in the top leadership, proposed
government aid to families with many children and said it was
necessary to get 3 million women off night shifts in various
industries.
   She said production of such basic consumer goods as soap and
toothpaste would be increased dramatically.
   ``Still, this is insufficient,'' she declared. ``We must return
again and again to the issue of increasing production of consumer
goods.''
   A shortage of disposable needles made headlines last year when
several dozen children were infected with AIDS in a hospital that
used unsterilized, non-disposable syringes. Ms. Biryukova said
production of disposable needles is being increased and they also
are being purchased abroad.
   Gusev, head of the Bureau for the Chemical and Timber Complex
since May 1988, was grilled for 1{ hours about why those industries
have not met production goals and are polluting the environment.
   ``I am not satisfied with my work,'' Gusev told the legislators.
``There are too many problems in the country due to our
deficiencies.''
   He said 85 percent of his agency's investment budget for
1990-1995 would be be used to modernize chemical factories and paper
mills and install anti-pollution devices. He said 47 percent of the
investment budget now goes for those purposes.
   Pollution and poor social conditions have been leading targets of
public complaint under President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's policy of
glasnost, or openness.
   Officials have said 50 million people, nearly one-fifth of the
population, live in cities in which air pollution exceeds acceptable
levels.
   Lawmakers also questioned Gusev about a paper shortage that
prevents the Soviet Union from publishing enough books or meeting
the demand for toilet paper.
   He said the paper industry lacks the equipment to increase
production, but is trying to expand capacity.
   Valentina S. Shevchenko, a legislator from the Ukraine, told
Gusev she had heard promises before and admonished: ``You must show
more character and be more demanding.''
   In defense of his nominee, Premier Nikolai I. Ryzhkov declared:
``The question isn't Gusev, it's chemicals (the agency). No matter
who we put in the job, the problems will remain.''
   Earlier this week, Ryzhkov withdrew seven Cabinet nominees the
Supreme Soviet found unacceptable.
   On Thursday, he asked legislators to focus less on personalities
and more on balancing the need for the chemical industry's products
with the environmental harm it causes.
   The Supreme Soviet, which replaced the old rubber-stamp
legislature this year, has approved six Cabinet nominees and is to
review more than 50 others during a session scheduled to run through
Aug. 4.

<HEAD>Activists Demand that Czechoslovakia Release Prisoners</HEAD>
<DATELINE>VIENNA, Austria (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Prominent Czechoslovak rights activists
are demanding that their country release all political prisoners,
allow peaceful demonstrations and reassess the 1968 Soviet-led
invasion, emigre sources said Thursday.
   A source in Vienna said about 1,800 intellectuals, actors and
artists and many blue-collar workers signed an appeal urging the
Prague government to open a dialogue with people outside the
communist establishment.
   The document was issued in the name of four activists, including
banned playwright Vaclav Havel and Sasa Vondra, spokesman for the
Charter 77 human rights manifesto, according to the London-based
Palach Press newsletter and other sources.
   Havel was warned by secret police this week that he may be jailed
again for his activities, his brother Ivan Havel said Thursday in a
telephone interview from Prague. Ivan Havel said two security
officials warned his brother his activities could be construed as
incitement to rebellion.
   In an interview Havel gave to Hungarian television, broadcast
Wednesday night, the playwright criticized Prague's reluctance to
embrace reform.
   Havel was freed on probation May 17 midway through an eight-month
jail sentence that drew protests at home and abroad.
   In Prague, Czechoslovakia's official CTK news agency reported
Thursday that police arrested four people, accusing them of
organizing terrorism, arson and murder and having ``close relations
with independent initiatives.''
   CTK identified the four only as being ``in their 40s'' and said
they reportedly directed and organized a group of youngsters,
allegedly ``setting several industrial targets on fire on Czech
territory since 1986 and killing a 17-year old person in connection
with this criminal activity.''
   The appeal signed by the activists demanded ``a free discussion
... to review not only the 1950s but also the Prague Spring, the
invasion of Czechoslovakia by the five armies of the Warsaw Pact,
and the process of `normalization'' which followed.''
   The Czechoslovak leadership, still suspicious of Kremlin-style
political reforms, has refused to re-examine the 1968 reforms
introduced in the ``Prague Spring'' and the Soviet-led invasion that
crushed the reforms. The invasion is officially still described as a
necessary action to defend socialism.
   The sponsors also proposed that ``1. all political prisoners be
released immediately, 2. that restrictions on freedom of assembly be
lifted'' and that the government stop persecution of independent
initiatives, according to the text released in London and Vienna.
   It demanded an end to political manipulation and censorship in
the news media and religious freedom.
   It urged authorities to submit to expert and public review all
projects ``which are designed to change permanently the environment
of our country and are thus likely to condition the lives of future
generations.''
   This was an apparent reference to the huge hydropower project
near Gabcikovo in Czechoslovakia nearing completion. Prague refuses
to discuss the issue with independent critics and environmentalists.

<HEAD>Bush, Wife React to ``Ugliest Dog'' Label Given to Millie</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   President Bush laughed off a magazine's
``ugliest dog'' label for pet Millie Thursday while his wife pushed
a mike in the maligned pup's face and suggested reporters interview
the dog.
   Millie kept her silence.
   Bush chuckled at questions from reporters seeking his response to
an article in the July issue of ``Washingtonian Magazine'' entitled
``Best and Worst'' and declaring: ``Our pick as ugliest dog: Millie,
the White House mutt.''
   ``Beautiful, beautiful, look at her,'' Bush exclaimed, pointing
at the floppy-eared, brown-and-white pet cavorting at his feet after
an outdoor ceremony at the White House.
   Mrs. Bush, however, had a sharper defense of the springer spaniel.
   ``She'll get the last word. She'll get the last word, don't you
worry,'' said Mrs. Bush, who noted earlier this week that she
planned to ghostwrite a book ``by'' Millie, as she had done for a
previous dog, ``C. Fred.'' ``She's writing the book.''
   Asked when the book was coming out, Mrs. Bush retorted: ``I don't
know, but she's started now anyway.''
   Would the book be about life in the White House?
   ``I don't know. You have to ask her. Come here, Millie,'' called
Mrs. Bush.
   The pet springer spaniel dutifully trudged over to Mrs. Bush, who
grabbed a boom mike _ a reporter's microphone on an extended pole _
and placed it in front of the dog's face.
   Millie seemed unimpressed.
   ``You'll notice she's turning her back on the question,'' said
the first lady.
   It's not the first time the president and his wife have been
called upon to defend Millie's honor since the magazine hit the
newsstands several days ago.
   ``Imagine, picking on a guy's dog,'' Bush told interviewers from
the Los Angeles Times on Wednesday. ``I know how Franklin Roosevelet
felt with the attack on (his dog) Fala.''
   The Washingtonian article, subtitled ``The Annual Guide to What's
In and What's Out,'' declared: ``Ugly Dog. Best: Millie, the White
House mutt. The first lady loves her, and she's a wonderful mother.
She hasn't bitten the president during their showers together. But
let's face it: This is a very homely springer spaniel.''

   Secretary of State James A. Baker III met
Thursday with a leading South African anti-apartheid activist,
Albertina Sisulu, to discuss ways of achieving democratic reform in
her homeland.
   The meeting is one of a number of high level contacts the
administration has had or is planning with South Africans across the
political spectrum.
   Ms. Sisulu, one of three joint presidents of the United
Democratic Front, an anti-apartheid group, will meet with President
Bush on Friday.
   Ms. Sisulu was invited here for talks to acknowledge ``her
courageous struggle for human rights and human dignity,'' a State
Department official said. The official added that Ms. Sisulu's views
are shared by large numbers of South African blacks.
   Two of her five children have fled into exile to avoid arrest.
Mrs. Sisulu has served various jail terms and been under house
arrest and other government restrictions for 18 years.
   South Africa gave her a 31-day passport to make the visit, the
first time she's been allowed out of the country.
   Her husband, Walter, is serving a prison sentence since 1964 for
helping found the guerrilla arm of the outlawed African National
Congress.

   Grzegorz Bialkowski, rector of Warsaw
University and a Solidarity-backed senator in the National Assembly,
died Thursday, state media reported. He was 56.
   State television said he died of a heart attack.
   Bialkowski, a respected physicist and poet, studied at Warsaw
University and spent his entire working career there.
   Active in opposition causes despite his position as the top
academic official at the state-run institution, he maintained good
relations with the banned pro-Solidarity Independent Students
Association and offered university facilities for such events as an
Independent Culture Forum last spring.
   On June 4, he was elected to the Poland's new Senate in the East
bloc's first fully democratic election since World War II,
representing the central province of Piotrkow. However, he never was
sworn in as a senator.
   The senate, in which 99 of the 100 members elected were backed by
Solidarity, is expected to convene for the first time next week.
   He also was a participant in the historic negotiations that led
to the legalization of Solidarity after a seven-year ban and the
holding of the elections.
   Solidarity deputies and senators have been meeting on the
university grounds in recent weeks to prepare for the upcoming
session of the legislature.

   Democrats charged Thursday that President
Bush's campaign finance proposals were designed for public relations
and would do more to help Republican candidates than accomplish
meaningful reform.
   ``The president's campaign finance bill ought to be labeled the
Fat Cat Protection Act of 1989,'' said Democratic National Committee
Chairman Ronald H. Brown, referring to the lack of campaign spending
limits in the proposal.
   House Speaker Thomas S. Foley, D-Wash., also criticized Bush.
   ``While I welcome the president's willingness to join our ongoing
reform efforts, I regret that he has chosen to submit proposals that
blatantly favor the Republican Party and jeopardize bipartisan
(reform) efforts already under way,'' Foley said.
   Bush said in a speech Thursday that he was proposing a plan to
``clean up the system'' of congressional elections, with
restrictions on political action committees and benefits enjoyed by
incumbent members of Congress.
   Because a majority of incumbents are Democratic, the proposals
have the effect of helping the Republican Party's chances to improve
its standing.
   Democrats, while welcoming what they called a tardy interest in
the issue by the top man in the GOP, charged that Bush's plan was a
transparent attempt to hurt the Democrats who control Congress by
skewing the political finance system toward Republican fund-raising
strengths.
   ``A totally partisan package has been set forward,'' said Rep.
Beryl Anthony, D-Ark., chairman of the Democratic Congressional
Campaign Committee.
   Anthony called it ``a P.R. effort on the part of the president''
that ``appears to have been written by (Republican national
chairman) Lee Atwater and (GOP House campaign chief) Ed Rollins.''
   However, Anthony said some elements in the president's package
would find favor with Democrats, such as rules requiring fairness in
redistricting of House seats and more disclosure of ``soft money'' _
corporate and labor contributions given to candidate through back
channel loopholes in the law.
   Bush proposed restricting political action committees, but
Democrats said that only the type of PACs that tend to help
Democrats would be curtailed.
   The president also suggested more money would be channeled
through the political parties _ a move away from public disclosure
of campaign contributions.
   ``This really just sets up another `hide-and-go-seek' game,''
said Rep. Al Swift, D-Wash., co-chairman of the House task force
that has been studying campaign reform proposals.
   But Swift said Bush's participation might help increase chances
of action on a campaign reform bill.
   Democrats repeatedly pointed out that it was Senate Republicans
who killed chances for a campaign reform bill in the last Congress.
   Sen. David Boren, D-Okla., sponsor of last year's reform package,
said he hoped the president's proposals would ``break the stalemate
in the Senate on this important issue.''
   But, Boren said in his statement, Bush's proposal was deficient
because it did nothing to limit the amount of money that could be
spent on an election campaign.
   ``We cannot have real reform unless we address the runaway costs
of congressional elections,'' he said.
   ``Without spending limits, all you do is turn elections into
auctions,'' said Rep. David Obey, D-Wis. ``I think what the
president is doing is posing for political holy pictures on this
issue.''

   Bush is keeping Kathleen Day Koch as general counsel of the labor

mid-1970s. Kopp, a lawyer, is also a former official of the Union

<HEAD>Hazardous Waste Sites Permitted To Expand, GAO Says</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Seven hazardous waste sites on the
Environmental Protection Agency's ``Superfund'' priority cleanup
list are among 400 municipal landfills permitted by states to expand
in the last few years, the General Accounting Office reported
Thursday.
   GAO, the investigative arm of Congress, conducted a 50-state
survey to chronicle a widespread expansion of municipal landfills by
communities struggling with shortages of space to handle trash.
   Between October 1986 and October 1988, 42 states received 640
municipal landfill expansion applications, and approved 396 of them,
the report said.
   Seventy-two applications were denied and 172 were awaiting action
at the end of the survey period.
   Eight states said similar information was not available.
   ``This is the first time anyone has inventoried the landfill side
of Superfund,'' said Andrew McElwaine, an aide to Sen. John Heinz,
R-Pa., who requested the study with Rep. Bill Goodling, R-Pa.
   Of special concern to the lawmakers was the finding that 14
landfills on the EPA's Superfund list had applied to states to
expand, and that seven had been approved. One permit was denied and
six were pending as of late last year, GAO said.
   Three of the seven landfills allowed to expand are in
Pennsylvania, and the others are in Colorado, Indiana, Oklahoma and
Wisconsin, GAO said. It did not identify them.
   There are no rules against such expansions. GAO said all the
states granting approvals required development of a cleanup plan,
with the exception of Oklahoma, where the operator had to close the
original site or post a bond to pay for proper closure of the
landfill eventually.
   Heinz and Goodling requested the survey after learning that a
Superfund site in Goodling's southeastern Pennsylvania district had
aroused citizen concerns by asking the state for permission to
expand. The application was recently rejected, Goodling said.
   McElwaine identified the site as the Keystone Sanitation Landfill
in Adams County, near the Maryland border. It was placed on the
Superfund list in July 1987, making it eligible for federal cleanup
money. Tests conducted by EPA and the state found that ground water
on and off the site had been contaminated by lead and other
pollutants.
   ``Citizens residing near this landfill have expressed concern
about contamination at the site, and whether the owner's past
operating record will lead to additional contamination if the site
receives approval to expand its operations,'' GAO said in the
report. EPA said the owner had cooperated with the cleanup by
conducting an evaluation of the site and pumping ground water to the
surface and treating it.
   Under the Superfund program, states and EPA track down
individuals or companies responsible for the dumping of hazardous
wastes and try to make them pay for the cleanup. If no one can be
found or the responsible parties resist, EPA can conduct the cleanup
and sue to recover the government's costs.
   EPA is in the process of developing new minimum criteria for the
operation of municipal landfills. The guidelines are expected to be
completed by the end of the year.
   Municipal landfills may be owned by private firms or state or
local governments. Municipal waste _ generally garbage and trash _
is normally not particularly hazardous, but it may contain dangerous
chemicals or substances that degrade into toxic material.
   Landfills to handle hazardous wastes are licensed under a
different program run by EPA.

   Japanese holdings of American companies and
real estate shot up by 51.7 percent in 1988, the biggest increase
for any nation, the government said Thursday in its report on
America's net debtor position.
   Here is a ranking of the top five countries in terms of their
direct investment holdings in the United States. Direct investment
is defined as ownership of at least 10 percent of a company. It also
includes holdings of such assets as real estate and office buildings.
   BRITAIN _ Retained its ranking as the largest foreign holder of
U.S. assets with a total of $101.9 billion, up 27.8 percent from
1987. The biggest increases were in acquisitions of manufacturing
companies, department stores and insurance companies, including the
$5.2 billion purchase of Farmers Group, a Los Angeles-based
insurance company, by B.A.T. Industries of Britain.
   JAPAN _ Displaced the Netherlands for the No. 2 spot in holdings
of U.S. assets. The Japanese total of $53.4 billion, a gain of $18.2
billion over 1987, reflected increases in acquisitions of
manufacturing companies and real estate. In manufacturing, the
biggest Japanese purchase was the $2.7 billion sale of Firestone to
Bridgestone, the Japanese tiremaker.
   NETHERLANDS _ Saw its U.S. assets edge down 0.3 percent to $49.0
billion with its biggest holdings still in the petroleum industry.
   CANADA _ Held U.S. assets of $27.4 billion at the end of 1988, up
13.9 percent from 1987. The increase included the $6.5 billion
purchase of Federated Department Stores by Campeau.
   WEST GERMANY _ Held U.S. assets of $23.8 billion last year, up
17.4 percent from 1987 with the increase primarily reflecting
several medium-sized acquisitions in the manufacturing sector.
   The total of all direct investment in the United States in 1988
was $328.9 billion, up 21 percent from 1987.
   Direct investment represents about one-fifth of total foreign
assets in the United States, which totaled $1.786 trillion last year.
   The other assets, including stocks not totaling 10 percent of a
company, corporate and government bonds and bank deposits, are not
tracked on a country-by-country basis.

<DATELINE>UNITED NATIONS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Leaders of the Greek and Turkish ethnic
communities on Cyprus ended a fourth round of unsuccessful
reunification talks Thursday and agreed to prepare a draft
settlement before another try in September.
   Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar, who acted as mediator,
issued a statement saying new ideas had ``offered a real possibility
of bridging the positions of the two sides and made a just and
lasting agreement possible. ... This effort could be brought to an
early and successful conclusion.''
   He invited President George Vassiliou of Cyprus and the Turkish
Cypriot leader, Rauf Denktash, to meet with him again in September
``to consider the completed outline and to launch the negotiation of
an overall agreement.''
   Perez de Cuellar said the two leaders pledged their cooperation
in completing the outline of a draft agreement before the next
meeting.
   Vassiliou and Denktash spent nearly four hours with the U.N.
chief executive, and both described the talks as productive.
   Little progress has been made since negotiations began last
August. The outline agreement now due in September originally was
intended to be ready for this meeting.
   The purpose is to form a federated state on the eastern
Mediterranean island. Cyprus was divided when Turkey invaded in July
1974, with the stated purpose of protecting the ethnic Turkish
minority, after a short-lived coup against the late President
Makarios led by Greek army officers.
   Denktash has declared an independent state in the northern 37
percent of the island occupied by Turkish troops. The state,
recognized only by Turkey, has only 120,000 people, about 18 percent
of the island's total.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A former foreign editor for the Washington Post
was named Thursday as ombudsman for the Stars &amp; Stripes military
newspapers, a post created in response to allegations of censorship.
   Philip M. Foisie was executive editor of the International Herald
Tribune after spending 26 years at the Washington Post, including a
long stint as foreign editor.
   He is credited with originating the ombudsman position at the
Post.
   Foisie's job will be to monitor the journalistic performance of
the newspapers and to argue with military brass over news coverage
and decisions on behalf of reporters and editors.
   He also will be able to write a column, spotlighting errors or
discussing the manner in which news judgments are made. Foisie will
be paid about $70,000 a year, the Pentagon said.
   Stars and Stripes is published in two separate editions by
largely autonomous bureaus in West Germany and Japan. Designed to
serve as the ``hometown paper'' for American servicemen overseas,
the papers have a history that dates to World War I.
   The papers are staffed by military and civilian journalists, but
both are led by an officer who holds the title of commander and
editor-in-chief. Those officers answer to the heads of the European
and Pacific Commands.
   The Pentagon describes the papers as ``authorized, but unofficial
publications.'' Both operate under a charter to provide ``a free
flow of news and information ... without censorship or news
management.''
   However, reporters who have worked for the papers say they must
walk a tightrope between reporting the news and satisfying military
commanders who are worried about sensitivities in the host country.
   General Accounting Office officials testified before a House
subcommittee in February on an investigation of the two newspapers,
saying they had found that military commanders and their
representatives ``have attempted to influence the reporting of
news.''

<HEAD>House Committee Passes Amendment That Would Block Shoreham Plan</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KIM I. MILLS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The House Energy and Commerce Committee passed
an amendment Thursday aimed at blocking the closure of a new but
unused nuclear power plant on Long Island.
   The amendment, introduced by Rep. Don Ritter, R-Pa., was approved
23-19 and attached to a bill renewing the basic legal authority of
the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. The legislation must still be
passed by the full House and the Senate.
   Ritter's provision would ban the planned transfer of the
operating license of the plant to a new local agency, the Long
Island Power Authority.
   Ritter said after the vote, ``LIPA was brought into being for the
express purpose of shutting down the Shoreham plant, which has been
judged to be safe by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, and the
authority is totally unqualified to engage in the decommissioning of
a nuclear plant.''
   However, the license could be transferred to ``a competent
authority,'' such as the New York Power Authority, according to John
Hambel, a committee spokesman.
   But the amendment forbids the NRC from spending funds to
decommission the plant unless the plant is certified unsafe, he said.
   ``The NRC authorization hasn't made it across the president's
desk in five years,'' said Peter Coogan, a spokesman for Rep. George
Hochbrueckner, D-N.Y., whose district includes Shoreham.
   Hambel said chances are good that the amendment will be picked up
by the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee and attached to
legislation sure to pass.
   Voicing strong support for the House amendment Thursday was Rep.
Norman F. Lent, ranking Republican on the Energy and Commerce
Committee and a longtime Shoreham supporter.
   He said consumers ``would be spared the whopping 63 percent rate
hike proposed by Gov. (Mario) Cuomo that would arise as a direct
result of the decommissioning of Shoreham.''
   The amendment passed one day after shareholders of the Long
Island Lighting Co. approved a deal to close Shoreham. Under the
agreement, the company would sell the unused will unused $5.5
billion reactor to New York state for $1 in exchange for a decade of
5 percent annual rate increases. Shoreham's license would be
transferred to the new Long Island Power Authority, which would then
contract with the New York Power Authority, operator of other
nuclear plants, to decommission Shoreham.

<HEAD>Coastlines are Littered with Plastic</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The nation's coastlines are littered with
plastic from cups to trash bags, an environmental group said
Thursday after releasing a report on what volunteers found on more
than 3,000 miles of beaches.
   The Center for Marine Conservation said the assessment, made from
items collected by 47,000 volunteers, demonstrates that America's
beaches, ``once famous for their beauty and biological richness,''
now are often littered with trash.
   In addition to being unsightly, the ocean trash has become deadly
to marine life, the group said.
   ``Thousands of marine mammals, sea turtles, seabirds, and fish
die every year when entangled in debris such as rope, nets, and
fishing line, or from ingesting items like plastic bags and
sheeting, mistaking them for food,'' said the report.
   The group said that in combing more than 3,000 miles of beaches
in 20 states, the volunteers gathered nearly 1,000 tons of debris.
In all, nearly 2 million separate pieces of debris were found and
recorded, the report said.
   Despite the uproar about medical wastes, only a small percentage
of the items were reported in that category. The volunteers recorded
finding 1,718 plastic syringes during their searches, which account
for about 0.09 percent of all the debris found, said the report.
   There were other ``medical'' items found, including caps, gowns,
tubing and even a set of dentures, said Kathryn O'Hara, who
coordinated the project.
   By far the greatest amount of trash involved some sort of plastic
product: 78,025 plastic trash bags, 26,148 milk or water jugs,
19,300 plastic bleach cleaner bottles, 14,721 foam plastic trays,
and 9,526 egg cartons.
   Among the ``dirty dozen'' items, glass beverage bottles ranked
No. 6, with 95,028 bottles littering the beaches. That didn't
include another 65,819 ``glass pieces'' found in the sand and among
the rocks. There were also light bulbs, fluorescent light tubes,
wooden crates, assorted fishing lines, rubber gloves, fishing nets,
and 857 plastic hardhats.
   Some states had more trash than others.
   ``The amount of trash reported per mile of beach was consistently
higher in states bordering the Gulf of Mexico,'' said Ms. O'Hara.
   Here are the states where the most pounds of debris per miles of
beach were located: Georgia (4,000), Texas (3,549), and Louisiana
(2,337).
   The debris was collected in September and October of 1988 by
volunteers over a three-hour period.

<HEAD>Autopsy Shows Diplomat Shot Twice In Back</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ALISTER HUGHES</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>ST. GEORGE'S, Grenada (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An autopsy found that a U.S.
diplomat killed in a shooting spree at police headquarters was shot
twice in the back, a government spokesman said Thursday.
   In addition to shooting John Butler, the U.S. Embassy's political
officer, on Wednesday, the assailant also killed Grenada's acting
police commissioner, Cosmus Raymond, and wounded two senior police
officials.
   The killer, Grafton Bascombe, acting assistant police
commissioner here, was later found dead in a police cell. Cause of
death was listed as cardiac arrest.
   Bascombe's motive remained unclear, but U.S. and Grenadan
officials said the incident had no political overtones.
   Grenada, a former British colony of about 100,000 people in the
southern Caribbean, has been politically stable since the island was
invaded in October 1983, by U.S. Marines and paratroopers, along
with a small Caribbean force. The invasion toppled a leftist junta
that had seized power in a bloody coup.
   The State Department said Wednesday in Washington that Butler was
shot ``point-blank in the heart'' after trying to subdue Bascombe .
   But Albert Xavier told a news conference Thursday a pathologist's
report showed Butler, 33, of Twentynine Palms, Calif., was struck by
two bullets, both of which entered from the back.
   ``The ... report suggests that Butler could not have been
attempting to restrain Bascombe,'' said Xavier, an adviser to Prime
Minister Herbert Blaize.
   Roy Sullivan, 56, the embassy's administrative officer who was
with Butler at a meeting, said he ``hit the floor'' when shooting
broke out and was unhurt. ``The last thing I remember was John
rising and going toward the guy who was wielding the pistol,''
Sullivan said.
   Butler's body was flown home Thursday.
   Officials said Bascombe killed Raymond and then burst into
another room and killed Butler and wounded Deputy Police
Commissioner Collis Barrow and Assistant Police Superintendent
Daniel Searles.
   They said Bascombe, 45, was previously assistant police
superintendent in neighboring St. Vincent island and was on loan to
Grenada police.
   Xavier said Bascombe's scheduled return to St. Vincent last week
was delayed because he had charge of funds involving a joint police
and military exercise and was to give Raymond an accounting
Wednesday.
   A government source, speaking on condition of anonymity, said
about $25,000 was involved and it was not known if any discrepancies
had cropped up.
   Bascombe apparently surrended after the shooting. He later was
prounced dead in a police cell.
   Xavier said pathologist Robert Hannon gave cardiac arrest as
cause of death and said Bascombe also had suffered a concussion, an
unspecified wound above the left eye, and a bruised and cut left
cheek.
   Xavier said cardiac arrest was consistent with an examination
made by Bascombe's personal physician, who said Bascombe suffered
from an enlarged heart and high blood pressure.

<HEAD>FEC Fines Cranston for Campaign Violations</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Sen. Alan Cranston, D-Calif., has been fined
for violating campaign finance laws in connection with his failed
1984 bid for the Democratic presidential nomination.
   The Federal Election Commission, which also levied fines against
Cranston's campaign and five individuals, said the campaign spent
too much in Iowa, accepted too much money from 77 people and one
political action committee, illegally accepted letters of credit
from six people and one corporation and failed to disclose those on
financial reports.
   In addition, the commission said Cranston put too much of his own
money into the campaign.
   The commission levied a $17,000 fine against Mark Weinberg, who
gave $55,000 to Cranston's campaign. Under federal law, an
individual can give no more than $1,000 to a particular campaign.
   The commission said Weinberg's violations were ``knowing and
willful.''
   The fines were imposed last month, but the files remained sealed
until this week. Under FEC practice, final disposition of a case is
reached when none of the parties involved dispute the facts and all
sides have agreed to the fines.
   The $50,000 fine was to be divided among Cranston, his campaign
and five other individuals.
   ``In the intensity of presidential elections, people working on
campaigns try, but experience shows do not always succeed, in
conforming with all the meticulous regulations of the Federal
Elections Commission,'' Cranston said in a statement Thursday.
   ``Nonetheless, I believe FEC regulations should be followed so
long as they remain in force. I was not involved in the day-to-day
administrative details of my presidential campaign. But as the
candidate, I take full responsibility for the actions of my campaign
and I deeply regret the violations of the rules.''
   Among the commission's findings:
   _The Cranston campaign spent $791,462 in Iowa, $106,924 more than
the legal limit.
   _Cranston spent $117,803 of his own money, while the limit is
$50,000 for candidates who accept matching funds from the federal
Treasury.
   _Cranston's campaign failed to itemize contributions toaling
$20,309 from 60 political action committees.
   _The campaign accepted excessive contributions from 77
individuals. No action was taken against them.

   Alan C. Nelson, abruptly ousted this week as
immigration commissioner, will continue working as a consultant to
help smooth the transition for his successor, the Justice Department
said Thursday.
   Nelson, a holdover from the Reagan administration who was
replaced Monday as head of the Immigration and Naturalization
Service, said he expected to continue working for several months as
a consultant.
   ``There is a lot going on the last eight years that needs to be
packaged for the new commissioner,'' said Nelson, commissioner since
1981.
   Nelson said he would be paid the top consulting rate of $284.50
per day, the equivalent of an annual salary of $73,970. As
commissioner, Nelson earned $80,700.
   Nelson said he expects to work ``on a relatively short-term
basis. That could be three months or so.''
   Justice Department spokesman David Runkel confirmed that Nelson
would remain as a consultant.
   Nelson, criticized earlier this year in an audit of INS ordered
by Attorney General Dick Thornburgh, was replaced Monday by Deputy
INS commissioner James L. Buck as acting commissioner until a
permanent replacement for Nelson is nominated by President Bush and
confirmed by the Senate.
   Gene McNary, chief executive of St. Louis County, Mo., is
expected to be nominated to the INS job.
   ``Obviously the departure could have been a smoother
proposition,'' Nelson said. He likened himself to the national
leader ``who is out of his country and the palace coup takes place.''

<TEXT>
   Inflation and a shortage of goods have made Tehran,
Iran, the world's most expensive city, ending Tokyo's four-year run
at the top of the list, according to a survey of 105 cities
published Thursday.
   Despite high inflation rates, Latin American cities remain the
most financially attractive to expatriates, according to the
twice-yearly study by Business International, a Geneva-based
research and consulting company. It said Ecuador's capital, Quito,
was the least expensive city.
   Taking New York as the base of 100 and using the dollar exchange
rate of April 3, the study said Tehran had a cost-of-living index of
209, followed by Tokyo at 202 and the Japanese cities of Osaka and
Kobe at 200.
   The strength of the Central African franc and heavy import taxes
put six West African cities in the top 10 most expensive worldwide
locationsa, it said. Gabon's capital, Libreville, rated 166.
   No. 8 Oslo, Norway, continued to be the costliest European city
for expatriates paying in dollars, with an index of 142.
   Moscow rose 14 points from December 1988 to 111, making it more
expensive than Paris, 110, or London, 109.
   Five of the six cheapest cities in the world are in Latin
America, the report said. Quito had an index of only 34, and
Caracas, Venezuela, and the Brazilian city of Sao Paulo were rated
at 42.
   Brazil had an inflation rate of 1,200 percent in the 12 months to
April 1989, but the impact on expatriates was offset by devaluation
of the cruzado against the dollar, according to the study.
   The survey uses a weighted index based on a variety of items
including food, entertainment and transportation but not housing. It
is aimed at helping international companies determine cost-of-living
differentials for their expatriate employees.
   Listings included:
   1. Tehran 209

<TEXT>
   Specialized teams to treat post-traumatic
stress disorder are being added at 23 of the VA's medical centers,
the Veterans Affairs Department said Thursday.
   The four-member teams, headed by a psychiatrist, will concentrate
on outpatient treatment, the agency said. Each team will also have
one clerk, with the other two members being chosen by the facility.
   ``This is a supplemental effort,'' said agency spokeswoman Donna
St. John. ``Treatment is available at the hospitals.''
   Post-traumatic stress is the Vietnam-era equivalent of what was
earlier called ``shell shock.'' The department says it affects 15.2
percent of male veterans of the conflict.
   It is characterized by recurrent thoughts of the trauma, reduced
involvement in work or outside interests, hyperalertness, anxiety
and irritability.
   In announcing the new teams, the agency said it gave prime
consideration to areas ``with significant underserved veteran
populations, including those with large rural, black and Hispanic
populations.''
   The units are at Albuquerque, N.M.; Battle Creek, Mich.; Boise,
Idaho; Baltimore; Boston, Canandaigua, N.Y.; Charleston, S.C.;
Chicago (West Side); Dallas; Denver; Gainesville, Fla.; Hines, Ill.;
Jackson, Miss.; Kansas City, Mo.; Los Angeles Outpatient Clinic;
Minneapolis; Mountain Home, Tenn.; New Orleans; Philadelphia; San
Antonio, Texas; San Francisco; San Juan, Puerto Rico; and Seattle.

   Patriotism fluttered in shades of red, white
and blue Thursday as citizens of ``Flag City USA'' turned out to
support efforts to make burning the American banner a crime.
   ``We may not be able to do anything about flag burning in Libya
and Iran, but we ought to be able to stop people from burning the
flag in the streets of America,'' said U.S. Rep. Michael Oxley at
the Rally for Flag and Country.
   ``This isn't a protest rally,'' said Oxley, a Republican from
Findlay. ``It's a rally to honor our flag.''
   Nearly 1,000 people turned out to express outrage at a recent
Supreme Court ruling overturning flag desecration laws in the United
States.
   Flags hanging from stores and homes along the narrow streets
leading to this northwestern Ohio city flitted in a light breeze.
Vendors sold T-shirts that read: ``Only a Commie Would Burn the
American Flag.'' Most people held or waved small flags.
   An act of Congress in 1974 designated Findlay as ``Flag City
USA,'' said Marjory Buckingham, manager of the Hancock County
Convention and Visitors Bureau, who coordinated the rally.
   ``I knew the city would support it,'' Buckingham said. ``It's a
patriotic issue and Findlay is a flag-waving, patroitic city.''
   Members of Citizens to Protect Our Flag, who also helped organize
the rally, went through the crowd asking people to sign petitions
stating that the Supreme Court's ruling was ``an affront to the
American People.''
   By the end of the rally, the group had collected about 5,500
signatures on the petitions, which they gave to Oxley. The petition
drive started earlier this week.
   Among those at the rally was Robert Heft, who as a high school
junior in Lancaster, Ohio, submitted the winning design for the
current 50-star U.S. flag as part of a class project in 1958.
   Heft said his first reaction to the Supreme Court ruling was
``disappointment and disbelief.'' Since then, however, ``it has
turned to anger,'' Heft said.
   ``I believe very strongly in freedom of speech when we show
displeasure with government or business or anything else,'' he said.
``But how far do we go with that freedom of speech? Does it apply to
desecration of the flag. I don't think so.''
   The U.S. Senate has passed a resolution condemning the Supreme
Court's decision. In the House, constitutional amendments have been
introduced to overturn the ruling. President Bush has said he would
support such an amendment.

<HEAD>U.S. Envoy To Afghan Resistance Pushes Interim Government Despite
Divisions</HEAD>

<DATELINE>ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The U.S. envoy to the Afghan
resistance on voiced strong backing Thursday for a new
government-in-exile despite sharp opposition by many of the
insurgents.
   ``We support the Afghan resistance as a whole, but are of the
view that the interim government is the most important manifestation
of the resistance,'' Peter Tomsen told a news conference.
   The U.S. envoy urged patience among guerrilla leaders opposing
the interim government that wants to end a 10-year-old civil war and
replace the Soviet-backed government of President Najib.
   ``It's only 3{ months old,'' he said. ``It is a slow and
laborious process, but our policy is to encourage and assist this
interim government.''
   One of the moderate guerrilla leaders, who spoke on condition of
anonymity, said Tomsen's outspoken support for the provisional
government ``is a stupid thing to say.''
   ``This government is the cause of the disintegration of our jihad
(holy war), the cause of dissent and infighting among Afghans,'' he
said.
   The United States eventually wants to funnel its humanitarian and
military assistance to the guerrillas through this government rather
than Pakistan, which has acted as a conduit during the past 10
years, said Tomsen.
   Some of the most vocal critics of this government belong to
so-called moderate guerrilla groups, many of whom support a return
of the former monarch or a neutral transitional Cabinet, which would
eventually oversee elections.
   But even some of the loosely-defined fundamentalists among the
Afghan resistance, such as Jamiat-e-Islami commander Ahmad Shah
Massood, blasted the guerrilla government as unrepresentative, said
members of his party based in the Pakistan capital.
   Abdul Rahim, a Jamiat spokesman, reported: ``Massood said it is
unsuccessful and he is right. ... Up to now this government has done
nothing.''
   So far this government represents only Afghan guerrilla groups
headquartered in Pakistan, where more than 3 million war refugees
live. It does not include the more than 2 million living in Iran,
the majority of whom belong to the Shiite sect of Islam, which is
practiced by most Iranians.
   In pre-war Afghanistan the Shiites represented about 17 percent
of Afghanistan's 15 million people. Most of the rest are Sunni
Moslems.
   Tomsen, who arrived in Pakistan Wednesday, said it is impossible
to meet Afghans in Iran. He met Pakistani Foreign Minister Sahabzada
Yaqub Khan Thursday and is expected to meet Afghan leaders in the
frontier city of Peshawar, about 40 miles from the Afghan border
during the next week.
   In mid-February the Soviet Union finished withdrawing its force
of more than 100,000 troops, in line with a United Nations accord.
The Soviets sent the Red Army into Afghanistan in 1979 to back the
Marxist government.

<HEAD>Agency Says New Compound Effective Against Mites</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A new compound called amitraz has proved
effective against tiny mites that infest the breathing tubes of
honey bees, the Agriculture Department said Thursday.
   Amitraz was developed in Europe and is approved for use in the
United States against ticks and lice of cattle and hogs, and against
certain mites that infest pears, said entomologist William T. Wilson
of the department's Agricultural Research Service.
   In early tests at the agency's honey bee research laboratory in
Weslaco, Texas, Wilson found that amitraz was ``at least 90 percent
effective'' against the tracheal mite, Acarapis woodi.
   The compound was also effective against the Varroa mite, another
major bee parasite, he said.
   Wilson said amitraz needs approval of the Environmental
Protection Agency before it can be marketed for tracheal mite
control.

<HEAD>Mortgage Bankers Sue VA Over Foreclosure Policy</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT GREENE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The nation's mortgage lenders are suing the
Veterans Affairs Department over a policy they say will increase
already excessive losses on VA defaulted mortgages.
   The lawsuit, filed Wednesday by the 2,200-member Mortgage Bankers
Association, asks the U.S. District Court for the District of
Columbia to block the policy, scheduled to take effect Aug. 1.
   Under the policy, the VA will add borrowing costs to the formula
to determine whether to acquire a foreclosed home at full price or
let the private lender take it over for a loss.
   Lenders say a growing tendency by the VA to cover only a portion
of the losses on defaults and leaving the property in the hands of
lenders is wreaking economic havoc.
   The order covers the cost the VA incurs to borrow money to
acquire and hold foreclosed property until it can be resold. Other
such costs that now might be deducted include repairs, cleanup and
commissions.
   The industry group says the revision will worsen problems in the
VA program caused by economic problems in the Southwest and the
lingering effects of the recession of the early '80s. It says banks
and mortgage companies may have to cut back on the low-interest,
reduced down-payment loans to veterans.
   When the VA doesn't bid on the foreclosure of a VA-guaranteed
home, the lender must acquire and dispose of the property, adding to
its losses, the bankers' group said in a statement accompanying the
lawsuit.
   The VA, in turn, pays only the portion of the loan that it
originally guaranteed, which is 40 percent or 50 percent, up to
$36,000.
   The lenders group, whose members hold 80 percent of VA loans,
says the loss to its members for each piece of property not acquired
by the VA will be $18,000.
   Thomas W. Maher, assistant director for property management at
VA, said the change would increase the numbers of pieces of property
that it will decide not to acquire because the loss would be too
great.
   Maher said the problem of defaults and foreclosures appears to be
abating.
   In the peak month of December 1987, there were 16,200 defaults;
there were 13,600 at the end of May. There were 22,200 foreclosures
as of December 1987, compared with 20,100 in May, he said.

<HEAD>Cuba Fires Interior Minister, But Crackdown Questioned</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: SUBS 11th graf, ``The State ..., with 4 grafs to UPDATE with
comment from administration official.</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Cuba's interior minister was fired Thursday and that
nation's drug purge continued, but the crackdown has failed to touch
other leaders U.S. officials say are involved in trafficking.
   Interior Minister Gen. Jose Abrantes, in charge of Cuba's
domestic law enforcement, was replaced to allow an investigation of
how a group of officers ``conducted drug trafficking operations ...
with impunity and without being discovered,'' a government
communique said.
   The firing came two days after a special military tribunal
recommended a court-martial and death penalty for Gen. Arnaldo Ochoa
Sanchez, who confessed to smuggling drugs, ivory and diamonds.
   But one member of that tribunal, Vice Admiral Aldo Santamaria
Cuadrado, is himself under a 1982 federal indictment in Miami
alleging he aided convicted marijuana and methaqualone smugglers.
   Other issues also call the Cuban crackdown into question: the
continued presence of fugitive U.S. financier Robert Vesco on the
island, accusations that Cuban leader Fidel Castro mediated for the
Medellin cocaine cartel of Colombia, and continued reports of
smuggling through Cuba.
   The selectivity of the Cuban crackdown has led experts here to
suggest there were two drug-smuggling operations in Cuba.
   ``I think there was a official operation sanctioned by Raul and
Fidel Castro, and then there was a second private operation by
Ochoa, so Fidel and Raul decided to clean house,'' said Jaime
Suchlicki, head of the Institute for American Studies at the
University of Miami, and author of a new book on the Cuban military.
   Thursday's firing of Abrantes ``is intended to put a wall between
Castro and Ochoa,'' Suchlicki said. It is impossible for
military-backed drug-smuggling operations to continue without the
Castro brothers' knowledge, he added.
   As recently as Sunday, a plane carrying a ton of cocaine passed
over Cuba and dropped its load in the Bahamas, federal officials say.
   Within the last six months, U.S. patrols have observed the Cuban
navy ``in the immediate area while an actual operation, an airdrop,
was going on'' in Cuban water, said Coast Guard Lt. Jeff Karonis.
   An administration official who spoke on condition of anonymity
told The Associated Press on Thursday that the United States wanted
Santamaria and others brought to justice, but does not preclude
joint action against drug trafficking.
   ``There have been other non-political areas where we have
cooperated, like air-sea rescue,'' the official said. ``If they are
prepared to go ahead with this on a non-political basis, we would
welcome cooperation.''
   Most accusations against Cuba are public record.
   The February 1988 indictment of Panama's military ruler, Gen.
Manuel Antonio Noriega, says Fidel Castro mediated a dispute between
the general and the Medellin drug cartel in June 1984.
   In 1982 and 1983, the U.S. attorney's office here prosecuted the
case in which Vice Admiral Santamaria was indicted. He and three
other Cuban officials were accused of helping a group of Miami-based
exiles smuggle 23,000 pounds of marijuana and 10 million
methaqualone tablets. Five Cuban exiles were convicted.
   Cuba has refused to extradite the vice admiral and the others,
including the former Cuban ambassador to Colombia.
   Vesco was indicted in Jacksonville this year for allegedly
helping convicted Medellin cartel trafficker Carlos Lehder Rivas
conspire to import cocaine. Lehder sent a messenger to Vesco in Cuba
to get permission to smuggle cocaine across the island, according to
the indictment.
   Cuba has not acknowledged Vesco is in its territory.
   Reinaldo Ruiz, who has pleaded guilty to cocaine smuggling
charges and is awaiting sentencing in Miami, flew cocaine _
accompanied by an undercover Customs agent _ into Cuba's restricted
Varadero air base in Cuba in 1987.
   ``In recent years, when we run into dope planes, they immediately
dip into Cuban air space, they signal Cuban defense forces, and they
are allowed to seek protection where the Coast Guard can't fly,''
said Richard Gregorie, former No. 2 man in the U.S. attorney's
office here.
   On a secretly recorded videotape, Ruiz once claimed his operation
was putting money in ``Fidel's drawer.''
   In August 1983, Cuban defector Jesus Raul Perez Mendez, who
worked with one of the Cuban officials indicted in 1982, told U.S.
officials that Raul Castro took money from drug traffickers to allow
smuggling through Cuba.
   Rep. Charles Rangel, D-N.Y., said his House Narcotics Committee
has never found conclusive evidence against Castro.
   ``If I wanted to say something bad about Cuba, it's easy to do,''
Rangel said. ``But meanwhile, Castro has arrested some bums. We
should explore opportunities that come to us.''

   The spinning propellers of power boat motors
cause thousands of deaths and injuries that could be prevented with
the addition of protective devices, a consumer group said Thursday.
   The Institute for Injury Reduction called for ``propguard''
devices to be installed. A Coast Guard analysis in 1979 showed as
many as 3,400 injuries are caused a year by the propellers.
   It said the leading makers are Mercury Marine of Waukegan, Ill.,

<HEAD>Bush Urged to Pressure Banks on Mexico</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The House Banking Committee urged President
Bush on Thursday to put more pressure on private U.S. and foreign
banks to negotiate larger debt forgiveness agreements with Mexico.
   The committee, on a 41-9 vote, approved a resolution saying the
reduction should be big enough to permit Mexico ``to achieve a
sufficiently positive rate of economic growth to ensure the
maintenance of social and economic stability.''
   The resolution also urged U.S. banking regulators _ the Federal
Reserve Board and the Comptroller of the Currency _ to make banks
set aside more reserves for covering impaired foreign debt.
   Mexico asked for a 55 percent reduction in the $54 billion it
owes private lenders _ about $15 billion of it to U.S. banks _ after
Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady unveiled his Third World debt
relief plan in March.
   The banks, led by Citicorp, Manufacturers Hanover and Chemical
Bank in New York, and Bank of America in San Francisco, initially
offered to share in a 15 percent to 20 percent reduction.
   Even with its decision last week to extend an anti-inflation
austerity program for another nine months, Mexico has claimed the
banks' offer still would take too much of its foreign exchange
earnings to permit a resumption of growth in its domestic economy.
   The two sides are negotiating, and sources close to the talks say
discussions are centering on a debt reduction target in the range of
30 percent to 40 percent.
   The committee resolution is a reaffirmation of Brady's plan,
which offers the private banks government-backed guarantees they
will be paid interest on the remaining balance, but only if the
banks voluntarily reduce the debt Third World countries owe them.
   The administration has been hoping that a general agreemen could
be reached before mid-July so Bush could proclaim the Brady plan a
success at the Paris economic summit.
   But the split vote by the House committee indicated a growing
sentiment that the Bush administration initiative isn't working.
   Some lawmakers, particularly Republicans, are beginning to
distance themselves from it. A few are echoing remarks by European
officials that the plan amounts to little more than a taxpayer
bailout _ through the World Bank and International Monetary Fund _
of bad loans made by private banks.
   ``Where's the money coming from?'' asked Rep. Toby Roth, R-Wis.
``It's coming out of the hide of our taxpayers.''
   Rep. Jim Bunning, R-Ky., said the private banks have a duty to
write off Third World loans that have turned sour.
   Roth and Bunning were among the six of the 20 Republicans and
three of the 30 Democrats on the committee to vote against the
resolution.

<TEXT>
   A man-made fire destroyed six homes
Thursday, and authorities said most of the houses burned because
owners failed to clear away dry brush before the start of Southern
California's fire season.
   The Riverside County blaze faded under dying winds later
Thursday, along with another that claimed one home and three other
buildings in Los Angeles County's Antelope Valley. Thousands had
been forced to evacuate both areas briefly as the fires burned 9,750
acres of brush.
   The Riverside fire ravaged five mobile homes and one house near
Lake Elsinore, 60 miles southeast of Los Angeles, but no damage
estimate was available, said Riverside County Fire Department
spokesman Barton Ball.
   ``It was man-made _ not caused by lightning or an act of
nature,'' said Ball, who added that there were witnesses but refused
to divulge details. Results of the investigation will determine if
the fire was arson, he said.
   The fire was first reported Tuesday afternoon in the Cleveland
National Forest near here. Ball said 1,000 acres of forest wildland
burned in the blaze, which was fanned by winds.
   ``Most structures that were lost were lost because of failure to
comply with state clearance requirements,'' said Ball. ``Those that
were saved were saved because they did. It's as simple as that.''
   He said depending on conditions, homes are required to have 30
feet to 100 feet of brush cleared around them.
   On Wednesday, authorities evacuated more than 200 families living
on the Lake Elsinore shore and in the nearby mountains, but most had
returned home by Thursday morning.
   `Our last family just left,'' said Red Cross shelter manager
Patti Hanna at Lake Elsinore High School. She said the shelter would
remain open during the day in case authorities called for another
evacuation.
   Ms. Hanna said 126 evacuees had registered at the shelter on
Wednesday, and 48 stayed the night. During its course, the fire also
forced the evacuations of a youth correctional facility, a nudist
colony and many homes and cabins.
   Ball reported 1,910 firefighters on the line, assisted by 12 air
tankers and six water-dropping helicopters. He said the only
significant fires left were burning islands of brush surrounded by
already charred areas.
   ``They have nowhere to go,'' Ball said.
   In the Antelope Valley 45 miles north of Los Angeles, meanwhile,
firefighters were mastering a 2,250-acre blaze that slowed Wednesday
night and was 95 percent contained by Thursday afternoon.
   ``The reason we are doing so well is because the wind has died
down,'' said county Fire Inspector Chris Button. The cause of the
fire was still under investigation, and reports that it was started
by a downed power line had not been confirmed, he said.
   ``It's now looking good,'' said U.S. Forest Service spokesman
Robert Brady. ``There are still lots of coals and embers, but no
massive flame fronts.''
   About 400 firefighters were battling the blaze, along with two
water-dropping helicopters.
   The fire destroyed one home, two barns and one other building and
forced 2,500 residents to flee the communities of Green Valley,
Leona Valley and Elizabeth Lake.
   ``It's hard to look at 25 years of your life, all the pictures,
the things that no amount of money can replace,'' said Velma Majors
as she looked over the remains of her family's home near Lake Hughes.

   Prosecutors said Thursday a juror in the Oliver
North case gave inaccurate information to the court due to
``inattentiveness, forgetfulness or lack of comprehension,'' but
that there is no evidence she lied.
   The assertions came in a seven-page court filing, the day after
North juror Tara Leigh King testified that she had forgotten that
one of her brothers had served a year in prison for armed robbery.
North's lawyers say his trial was tainted by King's presence on the
jury.
   In connection with the armed robbery investigation of her
brother, Tara King was contacted by a police detective at
Christmastime 1986, was subpoenaed and testified before a grand
jury, it was disclosed at a court hearing Wednesday.
   She responded ``no'' last Feb. 1 when asked on a courtroom
questionnaire whether she or any relatives had been involved in
court proceedings or an investigation.
   On Wednesday, she testified that she shed tears when she found
out her brother had been sent to prison and then forgot about the
episode.
   ``There is absolutely no evidence that Ms. King deliberately
answered'' the questionnaire falsely Feb. 1 when being considered
for the North jury, prosecutors in the North case said.
   ``Ms. King's testimony ... makes clear,'' said the prosecutors,
that ``whether because of inattentiveness, forgetfulness or lack of
comprehension, or a combination of the three,'' the questionnaire
``simply failed to trigger in Ms. King's mind her own involvement
and the involvement of her brother Sam King in the armed robbery
case.''
   There was no decision Thursday from U.S. District Court Judge
Gerhard A. Gesell on whether King's incorrect answer to the court
had tainted the former White House aide's three-month trial.
   Gesell was tied up much of the day on other matters. Gesell said
at the end of a court hearing Wednesday he would issue a ruling
Thursday.

<HEAD>Task Force Urged To Rule Out NorCal Offshore Oil Exploration</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Lawmakers, businessmen and citizens urged a
presidential task force on Thursday to ban proposed offshore
drilling on the rugged northern California coast.
   ``The north coast simply can't afford the risks of an economic
shutdown that are associated with spills from offshore oil and gas
development,'' said Sen. Pete Wilson, a Republican from California.
   Recent oil spills off Alaska, Rhode Island and elsewhere
demonstrate that there are ``some risks that are not worth taking,''
he said.
   Wilson's comments to the five-member panel came in the second and
last day of hearings to evaluate the environmental effects of
proposed drilling in parts of northern and southern California and
the west coast of Florida.
   The panel is scheduled to make its recommendations to President
Bush in January.
   Numerous local politicians opposed any drilling off the scenic
coast of Humboldt and Mendocino counties, parts of which are
included in the proposed Lease Sale 91 that is under review by the
task force.
   ``We cannot allow northern California to be leased and our
valuable ocean resources blown out the tailpipe of a gas guzzler
when there is no national energy policy,'' said Wesley Chesbro,
chairman of the Humboldt County Board of Supervisors.
   Chesbro and others called for increased conservation efforts and
a policy based on renewable energy sources like wind and solar
power. Oil drilling opponents fear spills could devastate the local
tourism and fishing industries.
   Some likened the prospect of drilling in the region to drilling
in the Grand Canyon, while others threatened to stage a ``seaweed
rebellion'' in the boardroom and court to fight any approved lease
sales.
   Eureka City Councilman James Worthen, however, testified that his
council voted unanimously to support ``orderly and environmentally
safe exploration of oil and gas preserves.''
   Stressing the importance of safety, Worthen said he believes most
transportation problems can be overcome with technology and that
pipelines to shore can avoid many tanker transport risks.
   His was the minority view. At a rainy rally outside the hearings,
about 250 people gathered in support of a national ocean sanctuary.
   ``If there was an oil spill ... it would put me out of work
absolutely,'' said commercial crab fisherman Bill Reid.
   The task force is comprised of members of the departments of the

   The first sales of Lease Sale 91 were scheduled for February but
Bush postponed the sales for additional review. As many as 22
drilling platforms could be built on the 1.1 million acre parcel,
according to federal estimates.
   In a related development Thursday, the House of Representatives
approved a moratorium on new offshore oil drilling along the entire
California coast until at least Oct. 1, 1990.
   If approved by Congress, the moratorium would halt preparations
for Lease Sale 91, as well as proposed lease sales in southern and
central California.

<HEAD>Irish Prime Minister Will Try To Form New Government</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: LEADS throughout, UPDATING with Haughey's plans to form new
government. No pickup</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DUBLIN, Ireland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Prime Minister Charles Haughey resigned
Thursday night and set out to form a new government after Parliament
defeated his bid for re-election.
   Facing what he called an unprecedented political crisis, Haughey
was expected to spend the next few days trying to line up more
support before making a new bid for election by the 166-member Dail,
or Parliament.
   He told Irish political correspondents he was sure he could reach
``a policy-based arrangement'' with the six-seat Progressive
Democratic Party that would keep him in office. The only alternative
was a general election, he said.
   Haughey, 63, announced he would stay on as caretaker prime
minister, and not ask President Patrick Hillery to dissolve
Parliament and call an election.
   His resignation was seen as largely a formality enforced by
demands from the left-wing Labor Party that he follow constitutional
procedure.
   Before that, he left no doubt he intended to try to remain prime
minister.
   ``Our paramount task now is to provide a government which can
meet the challenges and the problems facing the country,'' he told
the house.
   The Dail adjourned until Monday, allowing three days for
interparty negotiations.
   The Dail rejected his nomination by 86 votes to 78, underlining
the failure of Haughey's gamble in calling an election June 15 in
hopes of strengthening the parliamentary base of his Fianna Fail
party.
   The Progressive Democrats are a breakaway of the Fianna Fail. The
main opposition is the Fine Gael, which has 55 seats.
   ``The situation which now obtains, where the Dail has failed to
agree on the nomination of a taoiseach (prime minister), is
unprecedented in our history,'' Haughey told the hushed house after
the votes were counted.
   ``I am confident that with a full appreciation of the political
realities, and mindful of the best interests of the country, our
efforts will meet with success,'' he said.
   After the Dail adjourned, Haughey went to offer his resignation
to Hillery, whose post is largely ceremonial. Hillery has the power,
however, to allow Haughey more time to line up support for a new
vote or dissolve Parliament and force a new election.
   Haughey had been governing for more than two years with a
parliamentary minority and called the June 15 election on the
strength of opinion polls that forecast a majority for his party.
   Instead, Fianna Fail slid from 81 seats in the 1987 election to
77, and on Thursday, the Fine Gael and the Progressive Democrats
joined forces with socialist factions and independents to deny him a
majority.
   Only one independent backed Haughey, another abstained, and the
speaker does not vote except to break a tie.
   Other candidates had little hope of winning a majority to form a
government. Fine Gael leader Alan Dukes was defeated 103-61 with one
abstention.

   A federal grand jury charged eight people
Thursday with illegally siphoning off proceeds from church bingo
operations, prosecutors said.
   The grand jury indictment, part of a two-year probe of
Tennessee's bingo industry, named H.T. ``Tommy'' Powell, a former
state legislator and union leader, and W.D. ``Donnie'' Walker, a
former lobbyist and state bingo regulator.
   Also charged with mail fraud, obstruction of justice and illegal
gambling, were Ottis Cato, James Thompson, William McBee, James
Long, Jack Roden and Randolph Woody.
   The indictment charges that the Holy Family Miracle Temple and
Fairway Baptist Church, both in Memphis, sponsored bingo games and
illegally skimmed off part of the proceeds.
   The indictment says that Walker was made a silent partner in
bingo operations to prevent detection of illegal gambling.
   Powell introduced the original bill legalizing bingo in the early
1970s and is now president of the West Tennessee chapter of the
AFL-CIO.
   Walker pleaded guilty on Jan. 26 to charges of trying to bribe a
state senator, taking payoffs while working as a bingo inspector and
conspiring to set up fake charity bingo games.
   The U.S. attorney's office said the investigation by the Internal
Revenue Service, FBI and the Tennessee Bureau of Investigation is
continuing.
   All Tennessee bingo licenses were suspended March 9 after the
state Supreme Court ruled the games are lotteries, which are banned
by a section of the Tennessee Constitution.
   Before that, churches and other tax-exempt groups could operate
bingo games for charity as long as they filed necessary paperwork
with the state.
   But Attorney General Michael Cody estimated in 1986 less than 2
percent of the $44 million in bingo proceeds in the state went to
charity.
   Cato, from South Carolina, is involved in bingo halls and bingo
supply operations throughout the southeast, prosecutors said. Long,
from South Pittsburg, Tenn., is a bingo supply distributor and a
former lobbyist, and Woody is a former bingo hall operator who lives
in Chattanooga.
   McBee, from Camden, Tenn., formerly operated a bingo supply
manufacturing plant near Dickson, Tenn. Roden is a Chattanooga
businessman who formerly operated a bingo supply company, and
Thompson was described as a bingo hall operator in Pensacola, Fla.

   Lawyers for U.S. District Court Judge Alcee
Hastings asked another federal judge Thursday to block a Senate
impeachment trial which could result in his removal from office.
   Hastings, of Miami, faces a trial next month before a Senate
committee on 17 articles of impeachment voted last year by the
House. He is accused of participating in a bribe conspiracy and of
lying about it at a 1983 criminal trial in which he was acquitted.
   The full Senate ultimately would vote on his removal.
   Hastings, who sued the Senate on June 1, is seeking a preliminary
injunction to block the trial scheduled to begin July 10.
   The judge' constitutional rights are being violated because too
much time has elapsed and he essentially faces a second trial on
charges on which he was exonerated, Terence Anderson, one of
Hastings' lawyers, said at a hearing.
   ``Witnesses are dead ... documents have been destroyed ...
memories diminish,'' Anderson told U.S. District Court Judge Gerhard
A. Gesell.
   Anderson also argued that the Senate should pay Hastings' legal
fees and other costs connected with the Senate impeachment trial.
Hastings' net worth is less than $10,000, said Anderson.
   Another of Hastings' lawyers, William Kunstler, said the entire
Senate, not just a committee, must conduct any impeachment trial.
   ``I think they have to really watch the witnesses,'' Kunstler
said.
   Impeachments are not criminal proceedings and Hastings isn't
being tried twice for the same crimes, responded Senate legal
counsel Michael Davidson.
   The Senate ``has the authority to conduct this trial and will do
it,'' said Davidson.
   Davidson said the Senate opposes paying legal expenses for
Hastings: ``They have just never done it,'' said the Senate legal
counsel.
   U.S. District Judge Walter L. Nixon of Jackson, Miss., who is
serving a five-year prison term for perjury, joined Hastings'
lawsuit.
   A 12-member impeachment committee in the Nixon matter is
scheduled to begin a trial Sept. 6.
   One of Nixon's lawyers, David Stewart, also said the full Senate
should conduct the impeachment proceedings.
   ``The Senate cannot evade its constitutional duty to conduct this
trial,'' said Stewart.

   Israel deported eight Palestinians from the
occupied territories Thursday, disregarding demands by the United
States and international organizations that it stop.
   The army said they were leaders of the uprising in the occupied
West Bank and Gaza Strip.
   The deportations brought to 55 the number of Palestinians sent
into exile since the rebellion began Dec. 8, 1987. At least four
other cases are pending.
   At U.N. headquarters in New York, Secretary-general Javier Perez
de Cuellar said he was ``greatly dismayed'' by the Israeli action.
   Adam Shub, a State Department spokesman, said in Washington: ``We
are strongly opposed to deportations. We have ... spoken to ...
Israel many times about this. It is fully aware of our views.''
   He said deportations are especially harmful now while the Bush
administration seeks support for an Israeli proposal to hold
elections among Palestinian Arabs in the occupied lands.
   Twenty right-wing members of Israel's parliament hiked into the
West Bank a day ahead of 50 marches planned by Jewish settlers for
Friday to dramatize their claim to the territory, part of the
biblical land of Israel. Two dozen soldiers guarded them and no
incidents were reported.
   The umbrella group for settlers called Gush Emunim, or Bloc of
the Faithful, said the hikes were an effort to counter the revolt.
About 1.7 million Palestinians and 70,000 settlers live in the West
Bank and Gaza, which Israel captured from Jordan and Egypt in the
1967 war.
   Gush Emunim said: ``The terrorists and instigators will not
frighten us off, neither from the roads nor from the hiking trails
of Israel.''
   Residents of the territories held a general strike Thursday to
protest settler attacks on Palestinians, which have increased in
recent weeks. Scattered confrontations with Israeli soldiers were
reported, and Arab hospital officials said 13 Palestinians were
wounded by army gunfire.
   At least 538 Palestinians and 23 Israelis have been killed in
more than 18 months of revolt in the occupied lands. More than 8,000
Palestinians have been wounded.
   Army spokesmen reported Thursday that soldiers demolished the
homes of three murder suspects in the Gaza Strip and four houses in
the West Bank belonging to Palestinians accused of bomb attacks.
   The International Committee of the Red Cross contends
deportations contravene the Geneva convention on treatment of people
in occupied territory, which Israel has signed.
   Israel says the convention permits selective deportations ``in
extreme cases.''
   An army communique said the eight Palestinians deported were
``leaders of the uprising in the territories and outstanding
activists'' of Fatah, the guerrilla group led by PLO chairmanb
Yasser Arafat, and of the Syria-based Democratic Front for the
Liberation of Palestine.
   Expulsion orders for all of them were issued in August, but were
not carried out until the Supreme Court heard appeals by some of the
Palestinians. All the appeals were rejected.
   Lebanese police said the deportees, four each from the West Bank
and Gaza Strip, were flown by helicopter to Israel's ``security
zone'' in south Lebanon and driven to the Zommaraya crossing, a
gateway between the border strip and the rest of the country.
   Among those deported Thursday were two prominent West Bank labor
union activists, Mohammed Abdullah Labadi, 34, and Radwan Ahmad
Zayad, 31, and Abu Karesh, 50, a Gaza City teacher.
   Efforts are under way in Israel to speed the expulsion process.
Defense Minister Yitzhak Rabin has asked that deportations be
allowed before completion of the appeals process.

<HEAD>Menem Expected to Broaden Amnesty for Military</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By OSCAR SERRAT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BUENOS AIRES, Argentina (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Carlos Menem was quoted Thursday
as promising action on the military impasse soon after becoming
president July 8. He is expected to offer a broader amnesty for
officers accused of human rights violations.
   ``Now is the time to close the open wounds of Argentine
society,'' the newspaper La Nacion quoted the president-elect as
saying.
   Aides said he favors calling off the trials of 18 generals and
admirals accused of abuses during the ``dirty war'' against leftist
subversion during military rule in 1976-83, and releasing six who
were convicted in 1985 and imprisoned.
   In the interview, Menem did not specifically say he would ask
Congress to widen a 1987 partial amnesty to include the 18 or that
he would pardon the six jailed officers, who were members of ruling
military juntas and include two presidents.
   La Nacion said he conveyed that impression, however, when he
said: ``I can't stand to see even a bird locked in a cage.''
   Leaders of Menem's Peronist Party said privately that Menem views
an end to the trials as a path to national reconciliation.
   The ``military problem,'' as many call it, has plagued the
country since President Raul Alfonsin's civilian government was
installed in December 1983.
   Officers demanding an end to the trials organized three barracks
revolts, in April 1987 and in January and December 1988. All were
nearly bloodless, but Argentines considered them a threat to
democracy.
   Reports after his election May 14 said Menem urged Alfonsin to
resolve the issue by amnesty or pardon, but the president refused.
Alfonsin then announced he would leave office five months early, on
July 8.
   A commission appointed by Alfonsin documented nearly 9,000 cases
of people who disappeared during the anti-leftist campaign and are
presumed dead. Human rights groups put the total at up to 30,000.
   Alfonsin was unable to find a compromise between those who accuse
the military of a campaign of extermination and officers who say
they were merely using unconventional tactics in a war on terrorists.
   Menem rejected an anmesty or pardon during his campaign and has
repeated the position since the election, although nearly always
adding ``for now.''
   His designated defense minister, Italo Luder, signed an order
while acting as provisional president in 1975 that authorized the
military to ``annihilate'' leftists trying to overthrow President
Isabel Peron. The armed forces overthrew her the following year.
   When asked last week whether he favored amnesty, pardon or a
national referendum on the issue, Menem said he opposed a referendum
but left the other two courses open.

<HEAD>Agencies Ordered to Prepare for Budget Cuts</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Bush administration on Thursday ordered
domestic agencies to prepare for budget cuts of 5 percent after next
year because current deficit-reduction plans won't meet future
targets.
   ``It will... be necessary to present the president with options
for further spending reductions,'' said Richard Darman, the
president's budget director, in a memo to department heads.
   Fiscal 1991 budgets submitted for White House approval must
include not only the spending levels they'd like to see but also a
freeze and a 5 percent reduction, he said.
   The memo does not cover military spending.
   The required program cut proposals would not include
entitlements, which are ongoing programs that pay benefits to
individuals. However, Darman said such suggestions would be welcomed.
   ``Any such proposals, including reductions in entitlement
programs or increased user fees, may be suggested. If these are
sufficiently attractive,'' he said, agencies could avoid other cuts
or even offset increases in their regular spending.
   The president submits his budget in January for fiscal 1991,
which begins Oct. 1 of next year. The Gramm-Rudman budget law
requires that the plan reduce the federal deficit to $64 billion,
less than half of the projected deficit this year.
   Darman said that simply extending the deficit-reduction
agreements worked out with Congress for fiscal 1990, which begins
this fall, ``will not provide sufficient restraint'' on spending.
   The White House and congressional budget writers have not yet
begun hard bargaining on spending guidelines for fiscal 1991, as
Congress is still trying to enact the accord for fiscal 1990.
However, many lawmakers have said the 1991 deficit targets could not
be met without a tax increase _ something President Bush has said he
won't allow.
   A congressional aide, who spoke on the condition he not be
identified, said Darman's memo indicated the administration was
``having real difficulties meeting the target.''

<HEAD>Conservation No Longer Efficient, TVA Says</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Energy conservation through insulating homes is
no longer cheaper than generating new electricity, the Tennessee
Vally Authority told Congress on Thursday in defense of its decision
to end its residential conservation program.
   Several House members attacked the decision despite the utility's
assertion that continuation of the conservation program would mean
higher electricity rates.
   ``TVA seems to be out of step with most other utilities in
America and to have sacrificed its pioneering reputation in the
field of energy conservation,'' said Rep. Jim Cooper, D-Tenn.
   The government-owned utility announced in early May that on July
1 it would end its 12-year-old home insulation program for
residential customers in the seven-state region it provides power.
   TVA Chairman Marvin Runyon told a hearing convened by Cooper
before the energy and power subcommittee of the Energy and Commerce
Committee that conservation programs ``have reached a point of
market maturity and diminishing returns.''
   ``The benefits of further investments no longer outweigh the
costs,'' he said.
   Initiated during the interim between the oil and related energy
price spikes of 1973-1974 and 1978-1979, the TVA program became a
model for a congressional directive to other utilities to offer
their customers free home energy audits.
   Ironically, that nationwide program, the Residential Conservation
Service, also expires on Saturday _ Congress, like TVA, having
concluded that its benefits no longer outweigh its costs.
   During the life of its own conservation program, TVA provided
free enery audits to some 1.1 million homes in Tennessee, Kentucky,
Georgia, Alabama, Mississippi, Virginia and North Carolina. It made
no-interest or low-interest loans totaling more than $400 million to
install insulation and otherwise seal heat leaks from 600,000 of
them.
   But Runyon said the agency has found that it is now less
expensive to generate a kilowatt-hour of electricity than to save it
through conservation.
   The conservation program was costing 11.4 cents for each
additional kilowatt-hour of electricity it saved, Runyon said. By
comparison, completing six nuclear reactors either under
construction or being refurbished will cost only 7.3 cents to 8.7
cents for each kilowatt-hour of power they generate.
   ``If we didn't have billions of dollars in debt sitting out there
(already invested in those plants) conservation would look a lot
better,'' he said.
   Runyon estimated that a continuation of the program at a cost of
$20 million a year would require annual rate increases of one-half
of 1 percent.
   After averaging rate increases of 6 percent annually for the past
20 years, partly to finance its once-ambitious nuclear power
program, Runyon said he is committed avoiding a rate increase for
three years.
   ``At this particular time, conservation will add to our rates,
and that's true for out to 10 years from now,'' he said. ``I can't
answer that question for 20 years from now.''
   Several congressmen questioned whether if what is good for TVA as
a utility is necessarily good for its customers, but Cooper conceded
that with the expiration of the Residential Conservation Service
law, there is nothing Congress can do to force TVA's program to
continue.

   Vacations for thousands of United Mine
Workers members brought calm to the coal fields after violence that
had accompanied a wildcat strike by coal miners.
   A newspaper reported Thursday that a strike by 1,900 UMW members
against Pittston Coal Group Inc. in West Virginia, Virginia and
Kentucky is endangering two troubled funds that provide health
benefits to more than 100,000 retired miners.
   The broader wildcat strike is in support of the contract dispute
strike against Pittston.
   In southwestern Virginia, striking Pittston employees and wildcat
strikers from Appalachia and the Midwest continued to clog traffic
on coal-hauling roads Thursday.
   In West Virginia, a state judge has cited the UMW for contempt in
picketing two Pittston subsidiaries in Logan County. Judge Eric
O'Briant said he will decide by early next week whether further
restrictions are needed on picketing at mines owned by Elkay Mining
Co. and Buffalo Mining Co.
   Health benefits are a sticking point between the UMW and Pittston
in the strike that began April 5 and since has prompted the wildcat
walkouts involving as many as 46,000 miners in 10 states.
   Industry officials estimate about 37,000 miners remained off the
job late this week, and about half of the nation's UMW coal miners
are on vacation for a two-week period that began last Friday.
   Pittston has refused to contribute to the two health plans and
two related retirement funds since its contract with the UMW expired
in February 1988, court documents show.
   The union and the UMW Health and Retirement Funds have filed
lawsuits against Pittston over the issue. UMW spokesman John Duray
estimates Pittston owes as much as $10 million to the UMW Health and
Benefits Fund, a figure Pittston would't confirm, the Charleston
Daily Mail reported.
   If Pittston is allowed to stop paying into the program, the
miners fear other large companies will follow suit.
   In addition, employers are not required to contribute to the
funds for woerkers on an unauthorized strike. As a result, miners
striking to protect their health plans are creating hardship on the
funds, industry officials say.
   ``That can create a problem,'' Duray said, adding that miners
believe they can't afford to give in to Pittston on such an
important issue.
   Documents show that the two health plans spent more money than
they earned last year.
   The 1950 Benefit Trust, which covers 150,000 miners who retired
before 1976, ended fiscal year 1988 with an $18 million debt, while
the 1974 Benefit Trust, which covers 36,000 miners who have retired
since 1976, lost one-third of its assets and ended with only $22
million in net assets, the annual report on the funds said.
   The Daily Mail reported that both funds continue to lose money
even though coal operators' rates have increased.
   Pittston lawyer John Wood contends Pittston had the right to pull
out of the benefit plans when its UMW contract expired in February
1988.
   The coal fields in southern West Virginia have been mostly quiet
since the vacation period began, said state police Sgt. D.L.
Belcher, although some isolated shooting incidents were reported
earlier in the week.
   On Wednesday, four coal trucks in West Virginia and Virginia were
peppered with bullets and two others were damaged by steel balls
fired from slingshots. No arrests hade been made.
   However, in Virginia, about 1,600 wildcat strikers from a
half-dozen states stayed overnight at a campground near Pittston's
main processing plant. Virginia state police reported that three
trees were cut across three coal-hauling roads Thursday afternoon to
further hinder traffic.
   State police spokesman Charlie Vaughan said traffic was stalled
for about an hour before the trees were cleared.
   Gayla Hoffman, a spokesman for Peabody Coal Corp., which operates
26 mines in states hit by the strike, said Peabody was losing $5
million a day in sales.

   President Bush and congressional Republican
leaders agreed Thursday on their version of a constitutional
amendment to overturn the Supreme Court ruling that allows flag
burning.
   The amendment would read:
   ``The Congress and the states shall have power to prohibit the
physical desecration of the flag of the United States.''
   Bush will endorse the amendment language in a ceremony Friday at
the Iwo Jima Memorial, White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said.
   It was a continuation of Bush's presidential campaign tactics,
which included appearances at flag factories in an effort to paint
Democrat Michael Dukakis as less patriotic.
   He attacked Dukakis, the Massachusetts governor, for vetoing as
unconstitutional a bill requiring teachers to lead the pledge of
allegiance in schools.
   Friday's ceremony at the statue of the famed Marine flag-raising
in World War II will be held for ``a public endorsement by members
of Congress and the president,'' Fitzwater said.
   House Minority Leader Michel, R-Ill., introduced the resolution
Thursday before the House left for its holiday recess. He said he
expects Senate Republican leader Bob Dole to introduce it there when
that chamber returns from its extended July Fourth holiday, which
began last week.
   House Speaker Thomas S. Foley, D-Wash., said Thursday the House
Judiciary Committee will begin hearings on the flag issue in July.
   Foley, while condemning flag burning, has urged caution about
amending the Constitution. Michel said he generally agreed, but
believed in this case such action was the only answer.
   ``I just have to assume we're not going to be thwarted,'' he
said, insisting he did not view the issue as a Republican attempt to
paint the Democrats as less patriotic.
   Michel said the amendment avoids specific methods of desecration
because any list might leave one out. He pointed out, however, that
the amendment referred only to physical desecration in order to

<TEXT>
   The remnants of Adolf Hitler's yacht,
sent to a watery grave recently by a group of Holocaust survivors,
were refloated and sunk again Thursday in a deeper resting place off
Miami Beach.
   Air bags were used to raise the skeleton-like remains of the
Ostwind from atop a shallow reef, where it was mistakenly dumped
June 4 during ceremonies observing the 50th anniversary of the
``Voyage of the Damned.''
   ``We've said all along that ship has bad vibes,'' said Linda
Arter, a marina worker at A-1 Marine and Commercial Wrecking in
Jacksonville. ``It just doesn't seem to want to go away quietly.''
   The yacht, intended as an artificial reef, threatened marine life
on the coral reef and was a hazard to ships.
   An apparent navigational error caused the yacht to be dumped into
25 feet of water as 27 survivors from the SS St. Louis' 1939 voyage
watched. The ceremony commemorated the United States' refusal that
year to accept the ship carrying 937 Jewish refugees, many of whom
perished later in Nazi concentration camps.
   A tugboat spent more than three hours Thursday pulling the
85-foot yacht underwater to a 250-foot-deep spot two miles offshore,
where the steel cable was cut with a blow torch and the ship sunk to
the rocky bottom. The event was supervised by state environmental
officials.
   ``This is an opportunity to retell the story of the Voyage of the
Damned,'' said Rabbi Barry Konovitch of the Cuban-Hebrew
Congregation in Miami Beach. ``A bit of good may have come from this
event.''
   The Fountainebleau Hilton hotel on Miami Beach put up $10,000 to
move the Ostwind into deeper water. The Army Corps of Engineers
ordered the yacht moved or government crews would dismantle the
remains and bill Miami Beach officials.
   Prior to the resinking a Senate proclamation acknowledging the
Voyage of Damned was read by State Sen. Ileana Ros-Lehtinen of
Miami, a Republican candidate to succeed the late congressman Claude
Pepper.
   The Ostwind was commissioned in 1938 by Hitler as an Olympic
racing vessel, but it was never entered in competition and was used
instead by Nazi officials. Hitler apparently only used the vessel
once or twice.
   The United States took possession of the Ostwind as a war prize
and it was used as a training craft at the U.S. Naval Academy in
Annapolis, Md., until it was sold as surplus in the late 1950s. The
yacht was then held by various owners in Florida and sold in the
mid-1970s to a Nazi memorabilia collector from Massachusetts.
   The collector brought the Ostwind to A-1 Marine and Commercial
Wrecking for repairs. But the collector never completed work on the
vessel and failed to pay for the dock space.
   Marina owner J.J. Nelson took possession of the yacht in 1981.
The boat was repeatedly vandalized and Nelson rejected an offer by a
Nazi group in Chicago to buy the vessel for a shrine.
   Last year, Nelson contacted Miami Beach officials about using the
remains as a reef. It was transported last month from Jacksonville
aboard a large barge.

<HEAD>British Ads To Appear For Astronaut Job On Joint Mission</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CAREY GOLDBERG</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Britain's first astronaut will team up with two
Soviet cosmonauts on a trip to the orbiting Soviet space station Mir
in 1991, under an agreement signed Thursday.
   The astronaut job, open to a man or a woman, is to appear in
advertisements in the British press in the next few days.
   The British consortium behind mission is trying to raise $25
million to cover the astronaut's costs, project director Malcolm
Magee-Brown told a Moscow news conference.
   The mission, named Juno, ``does not rely on state support of any
kind, making it unique in space history,'' Magee-Brown said.
   The consortium, Britain In Space, Ltd., hopes to find the funding
through corporate sponsorships, contracts for scientific experiments
in orbit and the sale of broadcast and publishing rights, he said.
   Experiments the astronaut could perform might reap benefits for
pharmaceutical companies, biology and basic science, said Heinz
Wolff, the project's science chief.
   The project pairs the British consortium with Glavkosmos, the
Soviet space agency. Glavkosmos is already planning to send an
Austrian and a Japanese journalist up to Mir in 1990 or 1991,
director Alexander Dunayev said.
   Two British astronaut candidates will be selected by November,
one to fly aboard the orbiting station and the other to serve as
understudy. They will train in a Glavkosmos center for 18 months to
learn Russian, practice experiments and prepare physically for the
flight, organizers said.
   Candidates should be between 21 and 40, physically fit, have a
degree in science and an aptitude for handling delicate scientific
equipment, said Vice-Marshal Peter Howard, in charge of astronaut
selection. Marshal is former director of the British air force
Institute of Aviation Medicine.
   Dunayev said Glavkosmos expects to barely cover its costs on the
Juno mission but is interested in developing international
cooperation in the commercial space business.
   The Anglo-Soviet project was named for Juno, the Roman goddess of
marriage, because it marks ``the start of a very special
relationship between Glavkosmos and the British space
administration,'' Magee-Brown said.
   The United State was never in the running for the contract with
the British, Wolff said. ``There were no other offers of the kind
the Soviet Union made from countries with human launch
capabilities,'' he said.
   Mir is currently unmanned, but a new crew is scheduled to fly to
the station in late August, Dunayev said.

<HEAD>Big Prices for Junk Sculptures</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Strange-looking works by German sculptor Joseph
Beuys, including a felt suit and a ``silent phonograph,'' sold
Thursday for a total of $1.85 million, auctioneers Christie's said.
   Beuys, who died in 1986, became a celebrated figure in the
avant-garde art movements in the 1960s. He held that living itself
was a creative act and his sculptures were mostly made from junk and
materials such as fat, dead hares and old iron.
   A ``backrest'' of rusty iron set an auction record for his work
Thursday when it sold to an anonymous Swiss buyer for $377,500,
Christie's said.
   Of 102 sculptures, drawings and prints offered, 85 were sold,
often far above estimate. One was simply a wood-handled iron shovel
on a stand and another, called a telephone, consisted of two tin
cans linked by string.
   The felt suit went to an unidentified buyer for $81,100 and the
phonograph _made from a cardboard box, an old record and a bone _
was bought by London dealer Sam Fogg for $309,000.
   Fogg also paid $206,000 for a cardboard box with a roll of felt
and a razor on top, and the same sum for a box containing two rough
bronze and wax human-like figures.
   A 7-foot-tall color photo of Beuys, wearing his customary gray
hat, standing in front of a mastodon's skeleton in a Darmstadt
museum and labeled ``Kunst = Kapital'' (art equals money) was
bought for $55,000 by the Fuji TV Gallery in Tokyo.

   A potter's field has become the final resting
place of a growing number of babies, many of them the littlest
victims of the city's twin problems of crack addiction and AIDS.
   ``Two years ago. That's when it started. That's when I began
carrying more dead babies,'' said Jose Santiago, a city worker who
drives the tiny pine coffins to the common grave on Hart Island.
   ``Poor little kids. Crack is killing them all, crack and AIDS,''
he told New York Newsday columnist Dennis Duggan, who wrote about
the problem for Thursday's editions.
   In 1986, 1,128 babies were buried at the potter's field. Last
year, 1,489 were buried there, a 32 percent increase, according to
the Department of Health. On Wednesday 42 newborns were buried. The
babies arrived at a City Island pier in a van driven by Santiago.
   The babies had been placed in unmarked shoebox-sized coffins,
with pink slips giving their names and dates of death.
   The coffins were stacked onto a truck and headed toward a common
grave in the middle of the island. There, the babies are buried
1,000 to a grave 15 feet wide by 40 feet long and 6 feet deep.

<HEAD>35 Initial Presidential Candidates Try To Enter Iranian Race</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Thirty-five potential candidates showed up
on the first day of registration for Iran's presidential elections,
but not one got to register, the official Islamic Republic News
Agency reported Thursday.
   IRNA quoted local press reports as saying the documents of all 35
were judged incomplete Wednesday. Registration ends July 2.
Elections are July 28.
   The report, monitored in Cyprus, named none of the hopefuls,
saying it was illegal until the Council of Guardians approves their
qualifications.
   IRNA said a prominent deputy from the Majlis, or parliament, was
the only face recognized by reporters.
   Others included a retired judge, a psychology student and a
shopkeeper.
   Interior Minister Ali Akbar Mohtashemi told a news conference
most of the aspirants were under 35 years old. He said the turnout
``shows public interest in the presidential election and the freedom
in the present Iranian society,'' IRNA reported.
   Mohtashemi said special security committees will be set up
throughout Iran to stop any action by ``counterrevolutionary
groups'' during voting.
   ``I had a chat with friends and I decided that I must become a
presidential candidate,'' one hopeful was quoted as telling the
daily Kayhan. ``Of course I know that (Parliament speaker) Hashemi
Rafsanjani can be the most credible and prominent candidate in this
election but I thought my presence could add heat to the campaign.''
   Rafsanjani announced his candidacy at a news conference right
after Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini died on June 3 and remains the
only leading political figure in the race.
   He is widely expected to win, and would have to give up his
parliamentary seat. Mohtashemi said by-elections will be held three
months after the presidential election.
   Under a new constitution to be voted on in a referendum July 28,
the presidency will be much stronger. The already powerful
Rafsanjani is expected to take over day-to-day running of Iran.
   The Council of Guardians, a committee of 12 religious and legal
experts who review all laws passed by parliament, must approve each
presidential candidate.
   The Interior Ministry said a presidential candidate must have
Iranian citizenship and ancestry; a background in religion and
politics; management and administrative experience, and must be a
believing, honest and pious Moslem.
   IRNA earlier quoted the Farsi-language daily Abrar as saying the
Freedom Movement of Mehdi Bazargan, the only opposition figure
allowed to stay in Iran, has not yet decided whether to nominate a
candidate.
   Bazargan, 81, was the first prime minister after the Islamic
revolution came to power in February 1979. Khomeini fired him eight
months later, however, saying his attitides were too liberal.
   The government-run, Persian-language daily Jomhuri Islami said
Thursday that the speed with which Iran was electing a new president
and writing a new constitution after Khomeini's death was proof of
Iran's stability.
   Outside analysts have said the speedy elections could indicate an
attempt by Rafsanjani and Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, the current
president and Khomeini's elected successor, to consolidate their
control over the government.
   The are considered pragmatists, desiring a greater role for the
private sector in the economy and outside financing for Iran's
reconstruction after the 8-year war with Iraq. The more radical
camp, including Mohtashemi, support a centralized economy and oppose
ties with the West.
   Jomhuri Islami's editorial mocked analysts who it said were
waiting for Iran to plunge into turmoil after Khomeini's death.
   It said developments since the revolutionary patriarch died
``disappointed them even more than any other development since the
establishment of the Islamic Republic.''
   Khamenei said Thursday that Iran's hostility toward Washington
would abate only if the United States stopped backing Iranian
anti-revolutionaries, Tehran radio reported.
   The broadcast, monitored in Nicosia, quoted Khamenei as saying
that ``the big powers such as America must repent from supporting
the anti-revolutionaries, and until that happens the rage of the
Iranian nation against America will not abate.''

<HEAD>Taiwan, Korea May Face Trade Sanctions Over Driftnet Fishing</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LES BLUMENTHAL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Taiwan and South Korea were given 60 days
Thursday to complete and implement North Pacific driftnet agreements
with the United States or face possible trade sanctions on their
fishery imports.
   Secretary of Commerce Robert Mosbacher told President Bush that
efforts to reach agreement with Taiwan and South Korea over the use
of the driftnets by their fishing fleets have failed so far.
   Under a 1987 law, Thursday was the deadline for reaching
agreements on monitoring and enforcement. A 60-day time clock now
starts running and if agreements still are not reached by the end of
that period, the administration could impose an embargo or other
trade sanctions on Taiwanese and Korean fishery products.
   Taiwanese imports, mostly tuna and shrimp, were valued at $372
million last year and Korean imports, mostly pollock and oysters,
were valued at $250 million.
   ``We have been unable to get the guarantees we consider
absolutely necessary to protect critical marine life and valuable
salmon stocks,'' said Mosbacher. ``During this 60-day period I
sincerely hope that negotiations will continue so that we can avoid
a disruption in our fisheries trade.''
   Talks with the Taiwanese continued Thursday while talks with the
Koreans may resume in July.
   An estimated 700 fishing boats from Japan, Korea and Taiwan have
been using driftnets ostensibly to fish for squid since the early
1980s. The nets, which sometimes can stretch more than 30 miles in
length, have been dubbed by environmentalists as ``walls of death.''
   The small-mesh, monofilament nets hang in the water snaring
almost any fish, bird or marine animal they come in contact with.
   On any given day, the nets can cover more than 30,000 miles of
ocean.
   U.S. fishermen claim the driftnet fleets are catching North
American salmon and that runs in Alaska, Washington and Oregon have
declined as a result of the illegal fishing.
   The United States and Japan reached agreement on a driftnet
enforcement and monitoring treaty last Friday. Under that one-year
agreement the Japanese will allow closer monitoring of their catch
and a test program of using satellite transponders on research
vessels.
   The transponders can be used to keep track of where vessels are
located. However, the agreement fell far short of what some members
of the U.S. fishing and environmental community had wanted.
   Brian Gorman, a spokesman for the National Oceanic and
Atmospheric Administration, said in the past roughly half-a-dozen
countries have faced possible trade sanctions for failing to reach
agreement on various whaling issues with the United States.
   ``In each case the countries had a change of heart and acceded to
our demands,'' Gorman said.
   Northwest lawmakers praised Mosbacher's action.
   ``I suspect that with the threat of sanctions hanging over their
heads, driftnetting countries will be a bit more anxious to talk,''
said Rep. Jolene Unsoeld, D-Wash. ``If not, they better be willing
to suffer the consequences.''
   Unsoeld called for an international ban on the use of driftnets.
   Rep. John Miller, R-Wash., said Mosbacher had ``taken a major
step to protect U.S. salmon fisheries and the ocean environment.''
   Miller said the ``piracy'' by the driftnet fleets has already
delivered a ``painful blow'' to the U.S. salmon supply.
   ``These ships are supposedly fishing for squid, but they are
taking millions of pounds of our salmon and everything else swimming
in the ocean,'' Miller said.

   The Federal Communications Commission on
Thursday asked Paramount Communications Inc. to clear up ``apparent
inconsistencies'' in a document that discusses the company's plan to
take over Time Inc. through a temporary transfer of stock to a
trustee.
   In a letter, an FCC official asked Paramount to explain just when
it plans to take control of Time from the trustee, former Defense
Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld.
   The letter came a day before Time stockholders were to consider
Paramount's $12.2 billion hostile takeover bid.
   Central to the takeover plan is Paramount's receiving a special
temporary authorization from the commission to allow Rumsfeld to
acquire Time stock and operate the company. This authorization would
be issued pending FCC review of Rumsfeld's qualifications to hold
licenses for microwave relay systems operated through Time's cable
TV subsidiary, American Television &amp; Communications Corp.
   The commission has jurisdiction over the transfer of relay
facilities, while local municipal authorities must approve transfers
of the actual cable system franchises.
   Warner Communications Inc., which is being pursued by Time in a
$14 billion friendly takeover, has claimed that if the FCC approves
the authorization, Paramount will transfer stock to Rumsfeld on July
5, without prior approval from local authorities.
   In a letter to Paramount and Rumsfeld on Thursday, Alex Felker,
the chief of the FCC's mass media bureau, said that ``based on
earlier statements made in this proceeding, it had been my
understanding that you intended to await approval of Paramount by
local cable franchising authorities before Time stock would be
transferred from Mr. Rumsfeld to Paramount, but that you did not
intend to await approval of Mr. Rumsfeld by local cable franchising
authorities before he acquired Time stock and took temporary control
of its cable systems.''
   But Felker noted that in its June 26 response to Warner,
Paramount characterized as ``patently false'' Warner's claim that
Paramount would effect an immediate transfer of control of Time to
Rumsfeld without any required local franchise approvals.
   Felker said the Paramount statement ``appears to suggest, in
contradiction to your earlier statements, that stock will not be
paid for and Mr. Rumsfeld will not take control of Time until local
franchising authorities have approved Mr. Rumsfeld's
qualifications.''
   Felker requested a clarification ``in light of these apparent
inconsistencies'' and that the STA process would be held up in the
interim.
   Felker said that in the event Paramount intends to first await
local authorization before transfering control to Rumsfeld, the
company should inform the FCC how long the process will take.
   In a statement Thursday, Paramount said ``The FCC staff has
understandably been misled by Time's repeated mischaracterization of
our position. We have repeatedly and consisently said that our offer
to purchase Time shares is conditioned on obtaining both FCC
approval and material state and local cable approvals.''
   Time and Warner have told the FCC that Paramount's request for
special temporary authorization called for an ``unprecedented
extension'' to the cable TV industry of the FCC's rules. Time and
Warner claim the rules allow expedited transfer of broadcast
licenses, pending FCC approval of the applicant's worthiness to hold
them, but not for cable franchises, which must be transferred by
local authorities.
   Norman Leventhal, a Paramount attorney in Washington, said
``We'll be filing a formal response tomorrow and we're confident
we'll be able to satisify the commission concerns as expressed in
the letter.
   ``We believe our (plan) is fully consistent with commission
precedent,'' Leventhal said, citing three instances in which the FCC
has issued special temporary authorizations for non-broadcast
acquisitions.

<TEXT>
   Opposition leader Neil Kinnock on
Thursday attacked Britain's biggest union, the transport workers,
for continuing to support unilateral nuclear disarmament, a
vote-losing policy his Labor Party is giving up.
   ``You voted to meet the change in the world by making no
change,'' Kinnock told a conference of the 1.3 million-member
Transport and General Workers' Union.
   Kinnock is a member of the left-led union, which voted on Tuesday
to keep its anti-nuclear policy.
   Kinnock, a longtime anti-nuclear campaigner, said Labor would
never win power again if it kept the anti-nuclear policy it adopted
in 1981. In a policy overhaul announced in May, Labor dropped
unilateral nuclear disarmament.
   The policy was cited as a key factor in Labor's 1983 and 1987
election defeats by Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher's Conservatives.
   Kinnock, 47, joined Britain's Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament as
a teen-ager. He says he changed his mind because superpower nuclear
arms reduction agreements and the possibility of more deals have
altered the circumstances.

   Ships like the tanker that spilled
420,000 gallons of heating oil into Narragansett Bay are given
federal guidelines that contradict state law governing where harbor
pilots should board, according to evidence presented Thursday.
   In addition, the coxswain of a pilot's boat told the Coast
Guard-National Transportation Safety Board inquiry he often dropped
off or picked up pilots nearly inside the bay, miles closer than
where they should have boarded.
   The tanker World Prodigy had no pilot on board when it ran
aground inside the area in which the state requires a pilot.
   In other oil spills that occurred last weekend, a Delaware state
official said 75 percent of the heavy oil leaked into the Delaware
River when a Uruguayan tanker ran aground has been cleaned up.
   In Texas, crews using hand-held skimmers and absorbent pads were
completing the cleanup of the last of about 6,000 barrels of oil
that leaked into the Houston Ship Channel from a barge that collided
with a tanker. A commercial fisherman complained that several
patches of oil patches are passing over oyster reefs miles beyond
where the Coast Guard said the spill peaked.
   In the investigation of the Rhode Island spill, the Justice
Department approved immunity against prosecution for the World
Prodigy's helmsman and chief mate so they could testify.
   World Prodigy captain Iakovos Georgudis, 43, remained confined
aboard ship in lieu of $50,000 bail on misdemeanor charges he
violated the federal Clean Water and Refuse Acts that prohibit
negligent discharge of pollutants or discharge of pollutants without
a permit. He was arrested Wednesday.
   A statewide grand jury is investigating possible violations of a
state law that require a harbor pilot on board vessels inside a line
from Point Judith to Sakkonet Point.
   But the ``United States Coast Pilot,'' a Commerce Department
guide entered as an exhibit at the hearing, says pilots normally
board at the Brenton Reef Light Tower, about 1{ miles inside the
line and in the approximate area where the tanker ran aground.
   Norman Lidstone, coxswain of the boat that brought pilot David
Leonard to the tanker, said that while most pilots meet their ships
up to 1{ miles away from the tower, some ships whose captains are
familiar with the area meet pilots closer to the reef.
   In other testimony, Chief engineer Konstantinos Tzalas, aided by
an interpreter, told the Coast Guard-National Transportation Safety
Board investigating panel he was in the engine room and knew the
ship had grounded ``from the shudder.''
   The engineer, however, said speed was controlled from the bridge
and he could not estimate it from his measure of engine revolutions.
He said Georgudis provided little information about the accident.
   Coast Guard Capt. David H. Whitten said he decided not to attempt
to call the captain or chief mate, Georgios A. Vlahos, after their
lawyer, John McFadden, wrote that they would invoke their right
against self-incrimination.
   U.S. Attorney Lincoln C. Almond said he was trying to obtain
approval for the immunity grants from Washington.
   Testimony by the helmsman, Konstadinos A. Paraskevopulos, also
was delayed by the immunity question. He was granted state immunity
Wednesday and testified before a grand jury investigating whether
state pollution laws or a statute requiring a harbor pilot on board
were violated.
   Coast Guard crews and a private contractor had pumped the last of
the ship's almost 8 million gallons of oil into waiting barges and
were waiting for plans from the owner on where the ship would be
repaired, Lt. Paul Wolf said.
   Little shoreline pollution remained.
   In Delaware, Edwin Clark, secretary of Natural Resources and
Environmental Control, said 99 percent of the oil spilled by the
tanker Presidente Rivera had been cleaned from the shoreline and
about 75 percent total or 75,000 gallons had been cleaned up. Clark
said the state has kept its estimate at more than 100,000 gallons
while the Coast Guard said the tanker spilled 306,684 gallons.
   Tri-State Bird Rescue &amp; Research Inc. has gotten about 100 birds,
mostly mallard ducks and Canada geese, to be cleaned of the thick
oil clogging their feathers. Two ducklings have died at the center,
said spokeswoman Joyce Ponsell.
   A Galveston Bay oysterman said the extent of the Houston Ship
Channel spill may be broader than initially believed because patches
of oil particles are passing over oyster reefs miles away from the
spill.
   ``I had understood the oil was being contained and recovered, so
it was a surprise to me,'' oysterman Joe Nelson of Smith Point said.
``I was not expecting to see anything.''
   The Coast Guard reported Thursday said a light sheen of oil
stretched for about four miles from the cleanup site. ``It might
have been some oil that got out during the storm that we didn't know
about,'' Lt. David Atkinson said.

<HEAD>Judge Grants Injunction to Stop Newspaper Sale</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A federal judge agreed Thursday to stop the
sale of The Register-Mail in Galesburg to Thomson Newspapers Inc.,
saying two of the newspapers's trustees ``were blind to their
duties'' in agreeing to the deal.
   ``I think the conduct of the trustees constitutes self-dealing,
that is looking out for their own interests,'' U.S. District Judge
Michael Mihm said in granting an injunction sought by John T.
Pritchard, former publisher of The Register-Mail, which is owned by
his family.
   Mihm scheduled a hearing Friday to determine how the trustees
should proceed in selling the newspaper, which has a circulation of
about 20,000.
   Pritchard, his brother, Lester T. Pritchard, and their cousin,
Sally Day, are the three trustees who control 54 percent of the
newspaper's stock.
   Mihm said he granted the injunction because Lester Pritchard and
Ms. Day stood to benefit personally from selling the stock to the
exclusion of the other trustee, John Pritchard.
   In his lawsuit, Pritchard alleged that his brother and his cousin
breached their fiduciary responsibilities as trustees by accepting
the Thomson offer without adequately considering other offers.
   Mihm agreed with John Pritchard's allegations that his brother
and cousin took the Thomson offer because of personal benefits.
   Under the Thomson offer, they would receive additional payments
of $1.5 million for agreeing not to start a competing paper and Ms.
Day and her family would get health insurance coverage. Those
payments bypass the trust.
   The decision reversed Mihm's initial ruling Wednesday night after
12 hours of testimony and arguments. It blocks Friday's scheduled
closing of the sale to Lincoln Publishing Inc. of West Virginia.
   Lincoln is a Thomson affiliate created to buy The Register-Mail
and two weekly newspapers, according to its attorney, Dan Webb.
   The judge, however, rejected arguments by Pritchard's attorney,
Harold C. Hirshman, that Securities and Exchange Commission rules
were violated in Thomson's tender offer of $14.7 million for the
newspaper.
   Mihm ruled the Thomson offer was a negotiated sale, not a tender
offer, so the cited SEC rulings did not apply.
   There are several other offers for the newspaper and its two
weeklies that Lester Pritchard and Ms. Day have failed to
investigate thoroughly, the complaint alleged.
   The Peoria Journal Star has made two offers directly to the
shareholders _ one for $15 million that will create an employee
stock ownership plan for The Register-Mail, and another for $16
million for a direct purchase. There are also two other offers for
$15.5 million and $18.25 million.
   More than 91 percent of the shares in The Register-Mail have been
tendered to Toronto-based Thomson Newspapers, said Richard Franklin,
the attorney representing the majority of shareholders.

<HEAD>Guerrilla Spokesman Quits After Being Mentioned During Havana's Drug
Trail</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A guerrilla leader resigned Thursday
after a Cuban colonel being tried in Havana on drug charges
mentioned him as his only contact with the Colombian insurgency.
   Ramiro Lucio Escobar, spokesman for M-19, the April 19 movement,
announced he is resigning in an effort to avoid further allegations
against his organization.
   ``I am conscious of the gravity of the accusations. I want to
assume my personal defense and prevent this matter to be politically
exploited against the M-19,'' he told Colombian RCN broadcast
station.
   Cuban Col. Antonio de la Guardia testified Wednesday in Havana
that Escobar was the only person he dealt with during his trips to
Colombia. In the testimony, broadcast on Colombian television, de la
Guardia did not specifically say the dealings were part of alleged
cocaine-smuggling activities.
   Escobar acknowledged he met the Cuban army colonel but only to
trade Colombian paintings in exchange for Cuban sugar, tobbaco and
alcohol.
   ``De la Guardia ... cannot reveal his real drug connections, and
that probably is why he named me, a person with whom he had many
commercial contacts,'' Escobar said.
   ``I am one of the most watched man in Colombia today because of
my public condition of political spokesman for a guerrilla
organization. Consequently, the Colombian government has a full
information on my businesses with Cuba,'' he said.
   In the Havana trial, Cuban military officers are being tried on
charges they helped drug barons of Colombia's Medellin cartel
smuggle into the United States up to six tons of cocaine using Cuban
airports' facilities.
   Colombian authorities have repeatedly charged the Colombian
pro-Castro guerrillas with involvement with drug traffickers.
   The charges usually spared the M-19, a nationalist guerrilla
currently holding peace talks with the government aimed at a full
incorporation of the movement into the Colombian political system.

   A new Florida National Guard helicopter
crashed during a training exercise Thursday, killing one man and
injuring another, officials said.
   The AH-64 Apache gunship helicopter went down at about 11 a.m.
during a flight from Craig Field in Jacksonville to Camp Blanding in
Clay County, said Guard spokesman Lt. Col. Ken Forrester.
   The Army acquired the helicopter two months ago, officials said.
   Investigators have not yet determined what caused the crash,
which occurred in far south Jacksonville, the spokesman said.
   Chief Warrant Officer Bruce A. Pinner, 44, of Gainesville was
dead at the scene. Pinner, a Vietnam veteran who had been with the
Guard for 10 years, was the chopper's co-pilot, Forrester said.
   The pilot, Chief Warrant Officer David J. Mullen, 30, of
Jacksonville suffered burns over 10 percent of his body and a
fractured pelvis, Forrester said. He was listed in fair condition at
University Hospital in Jacksonville, officials said.
   A few hours after the accident, all rescue personnel and others
who ventured near the crash were checked for possible lung
irritation from burning magnesium and aluminum in the aircraft,
Forrester said.
   No one suffered any serious smoke inhalation problems, he said.
   An Army team from Fort Rucker, Ala., was flown in to investigate
the crash.

<HEAD>Legislature Nominates Noriega Ally for Canal Administrator</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ELOY O. AGUILAR</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>PANAMA CITY, Panama (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The legislature Thursday nominated
Tomas Altamirano Duque, a newspaper publisher and friend of de facto
leader Gen. Manuel Noriega, as the administrator of the Panama Canal.
   But Panamanian and American sources expressed doubts Altamirano
Duque will get the approval of the U.S. Senate to head the Panama
Canal Commission, which is a U.S. federal agency.
   Under treaties signed by the two countries in 1977 turning
sovereignty of the waterway over to Panama, a Panamanian citizen is
to be the canal administrator as of Jan. 1, 1990. But the candidate,
after being nominated by Panama, must have the consent of the U.S.
Senate.
   ``If they don't like me, they can fire me,'' said Altamirano
Duque told reporters after the legislature voted 42-0, with 13
abstentions, to nominate him over four other candidates.
   ``I am not anti-American and I am not a Communist. The U.S. has a
great people that believe in democracy, but sometimes its governent
goes down a different path,'' he added. ``The U.S. should have no
objection, but if it opposes it, it will be another violation of the
treaties.''
   Altamirano Duque, 55, is a prominent businessman, former Cabinet
member and publisher of La Estrella, Panama's biggest newspaper. He
is also is a longtime legislator for the ruling Revolutionary
Democratic Party and holds a business administration degree from the
University of Florida.
   A visa he had to travel to the United States was revoked by the
embassy in September, ostensibly because of his friendship with
Noriega and other top military officers who hold power.
   Another obstacle apparently is that the Bush administration does
not recognize acting president Manuel Solis Palma's government and
insists ousted President Eric Arturo Delvalle is Panama's legitimate
president.
   Noriega was indicted by federal grand juries in Florida on drug
smuggling and money laundering charges in February 1988. A few days
later, Delvalle fired Noriega as chief of the Defense Forces.
   But Noriega, who controlled a majority of congressmen, had the
legislature fire Delvalle instead and named Solis Palma, then the
education minister, acting president.
   Since then, efforts by the U.S. to oust Noriega, including
economic sanctions against Panama, have failed to budge him from
power.
   The commission, created to administer the canal until the year
2000 when Panama takes over the waterway, has an American
administrator _ currently Dennis McAuliffe _ and a Panamanian deputy
administrator.
   The deputy administrator, Fernando Manfredo, was considered a
strong candidate whom the United States would have approved without
reservations.
   But Panamanian government identifies Manfredo too much with U.S.
interests, and he received no votes when his name was proposed in
the legislature.

   Premier Li Peng on Thursday dismissed
international criticism that China's crackdown on the pro-democracy
movement violated human rights, and he said the suppression was
carried out legally.
   The government also denounced the European Economic Community for
condemning the attack on the student-led movement.
   Government-run newspapers on Friday continued quoting leaders'
criticism that foreign lands were trying to isolate China in the
name of human rights.
   The China Daily quoted President Yang Shangkun as telling a
delegation from Bolivia Thursday he hoped the world ``will
understand that the suppression of the rebellion represents a
reasonable act in handlng our internal affairs.''
   The steering committee of China's legislature held a special
meeting to endorse the Communist Party's suppression of dissent as
``legal, correct and necessary.''
   Li said many nations had shown understanding for China's tough
stance.
   ``At the same time, China has also noticed an anti-China adverse
current. Under the banner of human rights, these people have made
unwarranted accusations of China for its quelling of the
counterrevolutionary rebellion and punishment of criminals according
to law.''
   The official Xinhua News Agency said Li made the comments in a
meeting with Foreign Minister Carlos Da Graca of Sao Tome and
Principe, a tiny island nation off the west coast of Africa.
   ``Your visit is a support for China,'' Li told Da Graca, the
highest-level foreign dignitary to visit China since soldiers
marched on Beijing the night of June 3-4 and crushed the movement
for a freer society.
   The troops, backed by tanks, fired on unarmed civilians and drove
thousands of protesters from Tiananmen Square. The government says
200 to 300 people, most of them soldiers, were killed in the
confrontation. Chinese witnesses and Western intelligence reports
say that most of the dead were civilians and that the toll was as
high as 3,000.
   Authorities since have arrested more than 1,800 people and
executed 27, and China has become increasingly isolated from the
international community.
   The 12-nation EEC on Tuesday condemned the ``brutal repression
taking place in China'' and called for an embargo on arms sales. It
also urged the World Bank to postpone new loans to Beijing.
   The United States, Canada, Japan and Australia have taken similar
steps.
   Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Li Jinhua said the EEC had made
``presumptuous accusations against China and unilaterally adopted
decisions jeopardizing the bilateral relations.''
   ``The Chinese government cannot but express deep regret over this
unreasonable act of the European Council,'' she said.
   Wan Li, chairman of the Standing Committee of the National
People's Congress, opened the committee meeting by praising the
party and government for taking ``resolute measures to quell the
counterrevolutionary rebellion.''
   ``This decision was in line with the fundamental interests of
people of all nationalities in China, and thus was legal, correct
and necessary,'' Xinhua quoted him as telling the 133 members
present.
   The full congress has about 3,000 members and meets once a year.
It has limited powers and mainly serves as a forum for endorsing
party policy.
   The committee meeting was part of a nationwide campaign to unify
China's 1.1 billion people behind the crackdown on the seven-week
pro-democracy movement.
   The committee canceled a June 20 session, at which it had planned
to discuss political reforms demanded by students. The demands,
including a freer press, were replaced on Thursday's agenda with a
proposal to tighten control over people's rights to stage rallies
and demonstrations.
   ``Stability represents China's highest interest,'' said Wan, once
considered a moderate.
   The Communist Party last week dismissed party chief Zhao Ziyang,
also considered a moderate, because he had expressed sympathy for
the student protesters demands.
   The party replaced him with Shanghai party boss Jiang Zemin, who
in his first public statement Wednesday called for ``severe
punishments'' for leaders of the movement.
   Jiang and other newly appointed hard-line members of the
Politburo Standing Committee, the party's top decision-making body,
appeared Thursday with hundreds of military officers to celebrate
the 68th anniversary of the Chinese Communist Party, which is
Saturday.
   Jiang, standing next to Premier Li, sang patriotic songs with the
officers.

   U.S. Rep. Jim Wright was welcomed home
Thursday by 3,000 people who jammed a hotel convention center and
cheered when the ousted House speaker thanked them for forgiving his
mistakes.
   ``I want to thank you for being broad-minded enough, tolerant
enough, big-spirited enough to tolerate my problems, my
eccentricities and my mistakes, occasionally,'' Wright said. ``And
you let me do the big and important things.''
   The remarks drew thunderous applause in the Round Up Inn's
cavernous convention center.
   Wright did not specifically mention the allegations of unethical
behavior that forced his resignation, which takes effect Friday, but
he criticized the news media for what he called negative coverage.
   ``I've come home to live among you,'' he said. ``We'll be active
citizens. There are other things we can do. There are other ways we
can serve. Maybe we can help in some ways to create lasting peace in
Latin America _ peace throughout the world.''
   Wright also told the crowd he might be interested in teaching on
the university level.
   After his speech, Wright shed his jacket and sat on the edge of
the stage where he shook hands and accepted personal thanks from
well-wishers.
   Betty Wright, also a target of ethics allegations, sat by her
husband during most of the ceremony and said she too was glad to be
back in Texas.
   ``I think it's wonderful,'' she said. ``It couldn't be better.
It's great.''
   Wright got a loud cheer when he first walked onto the
red-curtained stage that bore a large ``Welcome Home Jim'' sign
beside a 10-foot-tall caricature of himself. He stood smiling, with
his hands up in the air as the crowd applauded for a half-minute.
   Mayor Bob Bolen, a Republican, helped organize the party, which
was free and open to the public.
   ``Jim's support here in the community is bipartisan,'' said
Tarrant County Democratic Chairman Dennis Sheehan, citing a poll the
Fort Worth Star-Telegram published Sunday that showed almost half
the district's Republicans support Wright.
   Wright, facing 69 allegations of House ethics rules, announced
his resignation May 31. A special election will be held Aug. 12 to
fill the vacant seat.

   A senior U.N. environmental official says
entire nations could be wiped off the face of the Earth by rising
sea levels if the global warming trend is not reversed by the year
2000.
   Coastal flooding and crop failures would create an exodus of
``eco-refugees,'' threatening political chaos, said Noel Brown,
director of the New York office of the U.N. Environment Program, or
UNEP.
   He said governments have a 10-year window of opportunity to solve
the greenhouse effect before it goes beyond human control.
   As the warming melts polar icecaps, ocean levels will rise by up
to three feet, enough to cover the Maldives and other flat island
nations, Brown told The Associated Press in an interview on
Wednesday.
   Coastal regions will be inundated; one-sixth of Bangladesh could
be flooded, displacing a fourth of its 90 million people. A fifth of
Egypt's arable land in the Nile Delta would be flooded, cutting off
its food supply, according to a joint UNEP and U.S. Environmental
Protection Agency study.
   ``Ecological refugees will become a major concern, and what's
worse is you may find that people can move to drier ground, but the
soils and the natural resources may not support life. Africa doesn't
have to worry about land, but would you want to live in the
Sahara?'' he said.
   UNEP estimates it would cost the United States at least $100
billion to protect its east coast alone.
   Shifting climate patterns would bring back 1930s Dust Bowl
conditions to Canadian and U.S. wheatlands, while the Soviet Union
could reap bumper crops if it adapts its agriculture in time,
according to a study by UNEP and the International Institute for
Applied Systems Analysis.
   Excess carbon dioxide is pouring into the atmosphere because of
humanity's use of fossil fuels and burning of rain forests, the
study says. The atmosphere is retaining more heat than it radiates,
much like a greenhouse.
   The most conservative scientific estimate that the Earth's
temperature will rise 1 to 7 degrees in the next 30 years, said
Brown.
   The difference may seem slight, he said, but the planet is only 9
degrees warmer now than during the 8,000-year Ice Age that ended
10,000 years ago.
   Brown said if the warming trend continues, ``the question is will
we be able to reverse the process in time? We say that within the
next 10 years, given the present loads that the atmosphere has to
bear, we have an opportunity to start the stabilizing process.''
   He said even the most conservative scientists ``already tell us
there's nothing we can do now to stop a ... change'' of about 3
degrees.
   ``Anything beyond that, and we have to start thinking about the
significant rise of the sea levels ... we can expect more ferocious
storms, hurricanes, wind shear, dust erosion.''
   He said there is time to act, but there is no time to waste.
   UNEP is working toward forming a scientific plan of action by the
end of 1990, and the adoption of a global climate treaty by 1992. In
May, delegates from 103 nations met in Nairobi, Kenya _ where UNEP
is based _ and decided to open negotiations on the treaty next year.
   Nations will be asked to reduce the use of fossil fuels, cut the
emission of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases such as
methane and fluorocarbons, and preserve the rain forests.
   ``We have no clear idea about the ecological minimum of green
space that the planet needs to function effectively. What we do know
is that we are destroying the tropical rain forest at the rate of 50
acres a minute, about one football field per second,'' said Brown.
   Each acre of rain forest can store 100 tons of carbon dioxide and
reprocess it into oxygen.
   Brown suggested that compensating Brazil, Indonesia and Kenya for
preserving rain forests may be necessary.
   The European Community istalking about a half-cent levy on each
kilowatt-hour of fossil fuels to raise $55 million a year to protect
the rain forests, and other direct subsidies may be possible, he
said.
   The treaty could also call for improved energy efficiency,
increasing conservation, and for developed nations to transfer
technology to Third World nations to help them save energy and cut
greenhouse gas emissions, said Brown.

   Thirty Cub Scouts from Nome plan to spend the
Fourth of July in the Soviet town of Provideniya for a wienie roast
and baseball games with their neighbors across the Bering Strait.
   The group from Pack 98 got visas from the Soviet Union on
Thursday, said Nome businessman Jim Stimpfle, organizer of the trip.
   The Cub Scouts are to cross the Bering Strait by airplane on
Monday for four days in the Provideniya area. Their parents will pay
travel expenses.
   Their hosts will be the Young Pioneers, a Soviet scouting
organization. Plans include a gift exchange, baseball games and
roasting hot dogs and marshmallows.
   The master of Pack 98, Glenn Martin, said the Alaska delegation
will include several Eskimo Cub Scouts and their parents, whose
native language is spoken by some natives of the Soviet Far East.
   The trip, months in the planning, comes about a year after an
Alaska group's ``friendship flight'' to Provideniya. That was the
first of several trips that have taken Soviets to Alaska and
Alaskans to the Soviet Union.

   Women once used hangers to end unwanted
pregnancies. Now, health officials say a few desperate women are
using cocaine to induce abortions.
   The National Association for Perinatal Addiction Research and
Education has heard of cocaine-induced abortions in every major U.S.
city during the last three years, said Ira Chasnoff, president of
the Chicago-based organization.
   ``It's probably cheaper, faster and more efficient to do it
themselves'' rather than seek an abortion in a clinic, he said in a
telephone interview Wednesday.
   The group keeps no statistics on cocaine-induced abortions, but
officials in Miami and Detroit say scattered cases of women who used
large doses of cocaine to end pregnancies are showing up in
emergency rooms as miscarriage patients.
   Chasnoff, an expert on cocaine addiction and pregnancy, said the
drug causes blood vessels to constrict, cutting off blood supply to
the fetus, and stimulates the pregnant uterus to contract.

   The White House has drafted a constitutional
amendment to forbid flag-burning and President Bush hopes to work
with Republican leaders in Congress to have a final version done as
early as Friday.
   Presidential press secretary Marlin Fitzwater said Wednesday the
measure would be developed jointly with Senate Minority Leader Bob
Dole, R-Kan., and House Minority Leader Robert Michel, R-Ill.
   The proposal would seek to set aside last week's Supreme Court
ruling upholding the constitutionality of flag burning as a form of
political protest.
   Fitzwater had earlier said a final White House amendment would be
ready by the end of the day Wednesday, but later explained the new
target by saying the GOP leaders ``wanted to be part of it.''

   The captain of a tanker that spilled
420,000 gallons of oil was confined to his ship today after being
charged with polluting waters off Rhode Island.
   For the first time since Friday's accident, fishermen were free
today to begin harvesting shellfish from parts of the upper
Narragansett Bay. Officials said almost all the spilled oil had
evaporated.
   Iakovos Georgudis 43, was charged Wednesday with two misdemeanor
counts of discharging pollutants into the water in violation of the
Clean Water Act and Federal Refuse Act. The captain also is under
investigation by a state grand jury.
   Each misdemeanor carries penalties of up to a year in prison and
a $100,000 fine or double the actual damages, said U.S. Attorney
Lincoln Almond. The Coast Guard has estimated damages at $1.6
million, and Gov. Edward D. DiPrete said President Bush has promised
full federal reimbursement to the state.

   House leaders agree on a package of limited
sanctions against China over its deadly crackdown on pro-democracy
demonstrators, and say they're near winning the Bush
administration's endorsement.
   The sanctions, drafted late Wednesday by senior members of the
Foreign Affairs Committee, were virtually certain to be accepted
today by the full House as an amendment to a two-year, $23 billion
foreign aid bill.
   The move will ``send a very strong signal'' to China's leaders
while steering ``a middle course between those who believe we should
completely sever diplomatic and commercial relations with China, and
those who believe we should continue business as usual,'' said Rep.
Stephen Solarz, D-N.Y., chairman of the Asia subcommittee.
   In addition to placing in law moves already taken by Bush, the
list included suspension of trade and development programs, banning
the sale of police-related weapons and limiting transfer of
high-technology and nuclear materials or components.

   In the remarks, reported in the official press today, Jiang also
told intellectuals they would not be victimized for speaking out.
   But he said there would be no tolerance of those ``who stubbornly

   Japanese businessmen aren't concerned just about
market shares and interest rates. These days, some are wondering
whether their jobs might kill them.
   It's called ``karoshi'' _ death from overwork _ or ``pokkuri
byo'' _ sudden death. The number of such deaths among harried
Japanese businessmen is growing at an alarming rate, researchers say.
   Victims share a common pattern: sudden deaths from heart attacks
or strokes after months or years of extralong working hours under
heavy stress, says Dr. Kiyoyasu Arikawa, who advises executives on
how to reduce their risk.
   Arikawa found that sudden deaths among top executives have
skyrocketed in the past 20 years, from 10 in 1969 to about 150 in
1987. Recently, he says, the number of such deaths has grown fastest
among those in their 40s and 50s, men who on average could expect to
live to about 79.

<DATELINE>KABUL, Afghanistan (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   On most mornings, the roar of a missile
overhead is the alarm clock for Omar Khan and his neighbors.
   Government officials make no secret that it is another
Soviet-supplied Scud-B missile, the heaviest weapon used so far in
the decade-long war against Moslem guerrillas known as the
mujahedeen.
   When the missiles come over it is always just before dawn; only
their targets and directions are changed _ somewhere in the
mountains or plains outside Kabul.
   To Omar Khan and others in the capital the missiles are a
reminder that while Soviet forces have withdrawn from Afghanistan
the fighting goes on. And people are weary of it, even though it is
far away, except for the times guerrilla rockets fall erratically in
the city.
   ``There is a struggle here between two great powers, but we are
the ones dying,'' said the 52-year-old Khan, who sells plastic shoes
in Kabul's old bazaar. ``The Russians and the Americans are talking
to each other about limiting atomic weapons, but both are sending
rockets and bombs to kill our people. Why? What is our guilt?''
   When Moslem guerrillas overran his village in eastern Kunar
province in 1980, Khan and his family packed the few belonging they
could carry, left their small farm and walked 125 miles to the
capital.
   He set up a small wooden stand in the bazaar, where veiled women
display fruits, nuts and spices and the shouts of peasants selling
camel legs compete with the muezzins calling the Moslem faithful to
prayer at the city mosques.
   Four of Khan's seven sons have died in the war. Two still fight
on the side of the guerrillas, and he worries that his only
surviving child will be called for military duty to fight the
guerrillas, possibly even his brothers.
   ``Forget? You can't forget about this war,'' Khan said, speaking
through an interpreter. ``But what are we supposed to do? Run and
hide?''
   During the 11 years that the guerrillas have been fighting to
overthrow the Soviet-backed government, the harshest of consequences
have fallen on the civilians. Many if not most of the 1.3 million
killed in the war have been civilians.
   The guerrillas control Afghanistan's countryside, but it is the
cities they must capture.
   That they have failed so far to do, and with casualties rising on
both sides, doubt is growing that either side has the power to break
the impasse.
   ``We are simple, poor people,'' Khan said. ``Our families may be
with the government, they may be with the mujahedeen. But this has
to stop.''
   While he and others in the bazaar praise the guerrillas for their
struggle against the Soviet forces that intervened to help the
Marxist government in 1979, they remain apprehensive about the
fundamentalist guerrilla leaders and of the destruction the rebels
inflicted while seizing provincial towns.
   And even among those who speak contemptuously of the government,
the tendency is to question the decision of the United States to
continue arming the guerrillas after the Soviets left Feb. 15.
   Guerrilla projectiles _ almost always are Chinese-made
107mm-rockets packed with shrapnel and designed to spray jagged
metal shards over a wide area _ are fired at random from the rebels'
mountain hideouts about 15 miles outside Kabul. They usually land on
houses, courtyards, parks and mosques but seldom on the intended
targets _ military outposts, government installations and the
airport.
   In the wards at Indira Gandhi Children's Hospital, feelings are
strongest among the doctors trained by Westerners before war erupted.
   ``We would like to see the world's two most powerful countries
trying to help us, not destroy us,'' said Dr. Mohammad Jalail as he
checked an 11-year-old boy whose legs had to be amputated after a
rocket slammed into a park where he was playing.
   ``I am not a politician, but those who supply these weapons
should think. If they were here and they could see this, how would
they feel? Would they want to continue sending the weapons or would
they think it better to help us with the medicines and food we
really need?'' said the California-educated Jalail.
   Few people in Kabul expect a unified opposition to emerge. And if
the war continues, many fear the uneasy alliance between the seven
Pakistan-based guerrilla groups could rupture, creating a country so
divided by a warlord system that no outside influence would be
likely to control.
   Most believe that almost any negotiated settlement would be
better than one won on the battlefield.
   A common preference seems directed toward an ill-defined
compromise that would install a government that would be neither
Marxist nor committed to Islamic fundamentalism.
   One hope is that some outside force will end the fighting and
restore peace. One who is frequently mentioned is the exiled King
Mohammad Zahir Shah, dethroned by a military coup in 1973.
   ``He was a good king, and he isn't killing anybody,'' Khan said.
   Now 74 years old, Zahir Shah lives in Rome. But most diplomats in
Kabul say the chances of his playing a significant role are not
rated very highly, partly because of allegations among some
guerrilla groups that his personal behavior as king fell short of
the standards expected of a devout Moslem.
   But the yearning for a solution runs deep.
   ``The Americans give bombs to the mujahedeen; the Russians give
bombs to the government,'' Khan said. ``The Americans don't die and
the Russians don't die. Only Afghans died. It's time to say, `OK,
enough. Finished.'''

<HEAD>Betting and Investing, Similar and Different</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN CUNNIFF</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Analyst</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Wall Street hates the word ``bet,'' which it
associates with the somewhat frantic and relatively low-brow
activities at casinos and racetracks that contrast with the serious
business of stock exchanges.
   Betting is gambling, Wall Streeters say. They consider it an
often irrational and addictive activity that generally brings
nothing but woe to participants and families, whereas investing
builds happiness and nest eggs.
   As they see it, gambling is for the uninformed, the unfortunate,
the touts and dreamers. In contrast, investing is rational,
considered, informed, calculated, prudent. It is productive; it
builds the economy.
   Betting is low-class, investing is high. Betters are hot-headed,
investors are cool. Betting is blind, investing is informed. Betting
is for losers, investing for winners. Betting may flirt with the law
and sometimes flout it, but investing is all-American, wholesome,
democratic.
   But _ with due respect for such definitions and opinions _ some
of the people who run U.S. free enterprise aren't strongly inclined
to make either a bet or an investment in the very companies with
which they associate.
   Proxy statements tell the tale, showing that executives of major
U.S. businesses sometimes have surprisingly small investments in
their own companies. Directors sometimes have what is called an odd
lot, or fewer than 100 shares.
   Still, these are the people whose job it is to convince others to
invest in their corporations, and for most people the most
convincing argument for investing is the potential for corporate
growth and profit.
   The case of managers and directors who decline to invest heavily
in their own companies, or who sell when others are buying, has long
been a curious phenomenon in U.S. corporate life. And it is closely
watched.
   It is, in fact, a key measure used by smart investors. If
managers and directors aren't enthusiastic investors, why should
outsiders want to buy in? If managers are selling, doesn't that
suggest a lack of faith in the future?
   Often, but not always. High-level managers sometimes are
compelled to sell for personal reasons, such as to pay taxes, settle
estates or raise money to support a certain life style.
   But when several insiders lower their holdings simultaneously it
often is enough to provoke speculation that they know something the
public doesn't. That type of speculation now involves Lockheed Corp.
   The Wall Street Journal noted this week that Robert Fuhrman,
Lockheed vice chairman, sold 8,635 shares in February and 5,000 more
on May 25, reducing his holdings to 1,000 shares. Seven other
insiders were sellers in recent months.
   While such decisions could be personal, they are watched closely
by advisory services as potential evidence the future might contain
some bad news. Indeed, that is often the case.
   Are these managers, therefore, betting against their own
``team''? That's where the distinction between betting and investing
and sports and business becomes clearer. Managing a business is not
managing a team.
   Business, unlike sports, isn't played a game at a time, but all
the time. The season isn't limited, but endless. Both business and
sports keep score _ the former with runs or goals or points, the
latter with dollars _ but sports scoring is much more precise. In
baseball, winners are emphatically declared, but what appears to be
a loser in business may, on reflection, turn out to be a winner.
   Above all, the power and influence of one individual in a
professional sports organization may be far greater than that of any
one person in business. Teams are small, generally a fraction of the
size of even small corporations.
   Yes, there are differences between betting and investing _ big
ones _ but sometimes the two become remarkably alike. If corporate
managers sell heavily, it's a good bet that you, as an investor,
should examine the reasons.

<HEAD>Mid-Atlantic Islanders Trying for Economic Comeback</HEAD>
<HEAD>LaserPhoto Planned</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TONY SMITH</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>LAJES DO PICO, Azores (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Silt has built up in the harbor
where whaling fleets once anchored. On shore, factories stand
derelict. Only a few tourists sip coffee at the Moby Dick Cafe or
wander around in the whaling museum.
   Since the 1983 international whaling ban, things have been
looking bleak for Lajes do Pico and almost all of the 250,000 people
living in the Azores, the Atlantic archipelago 740 miles west of
mainland Portugal.
   But as a Portuguese possession, the Azores now are part of the
European Economic Community, headquartered in far-off Brussels,
Belgium, and that has rekindled hopes for modernization and a return
of some of the prosperity of old.
   Even so, Azoreans are in a struggle.
   With a per capita gross national product of $1,286 in 1985, they
rank among the poorest in Europe, trailing Portugal, with $2,160,
and Greece, with $3,280. About 28 percent of islanders work the land.
   ``All through history, we've concentrated on one product _ wheat,
then oranges, now dairy products. And that's left us very open to
crisis,'' said Carlos Cordeiro, history lecturer at the Azores
University on Sao Miguel, the largest of the nine Azores islands.
   Portugal's entry into the EEC in 1986 meant a new source of
money. According to government figures, EEC funds will increase from
$41 million in the previous three-year period to $511 million, or a
quarter of the Azorean budget, for 1989-1992.
   The U.S. Air Force base at Lajes on Terceira, the island in the
middle, was once a source of vital income for the islands and
provided jobs for about 1,500 Azoreans.
   But revenue from the U.S.-Portuguese base agreement is becoming
less significant as EEC assistance rises.
   And regional President Joao Bosco Mota Amaral has set his
priorities _ modernize agriculture and fisheries, and promote
tourism.
   Across the water from Pico, the capital of Faial island, Horta,
is already booming. Boat crews record their visits with graffiti on
the docks and private yachtsmen pack Pete's Bar, ordering drinks in
French, English, German and Spanish.
   Maria da Graca Sousa, director of two luxury hotels on Faial and
Pico, says the Azores will offer 3,000 beds by next year but can't
rely on tourism alone.
   ``The destiny of the Azores in tourism is not cheap _ it costs a
lot to get here and it's a very specific market _ nature, walking
and watersports.''
   Profitable alternatives are hard to find, however.
   ``Nearly all our main sectors are in crisis _ meat and milk are
products already in surplus in the EEC,'' said Mario Fortuna, a
leading Azorean economist.
   After more than a year of negotiations, EEC officials recently
authorized the islands to set up a duty-free manufacturing zone on
Santa Maria, the easternmost of the Azores.
   Under the plan, companies can operate tax-free through the year
2011 and the government plans incentives for potential shareholders.
   ``We're hoping to attract manufacturers _ electronics,
pharmaceuticals, plastics _ all light and cheap to transport,'' said
Fortuna, who is chairman of the free-zone administration board
ZOFRAM.
   ``It was difficult to persuade the EEC to make an exception just
when it's trying to standardize countries for 1992, but if (the
Azores) had to use the same rules as regions in the heart of Europe,
that would be unfair competition _exactly what the EEC's against.''
   High cost of transporting goods and supplies to the Azores is a
chief problem and island shopkeepers charge about 15 percent more
for wares than stores on the European mainland.
   The Portuguese government in Lisbon plans to move some 140 air
traffic controllers responsible for mid-Atlantic operations from
Santa Maria island to the mainland by 1990. That will mean a loss of
purchasing power on the island of 5,000 people and turn its main
community, Vilo do Porto, into another Lajes do Pico.
   ``Many shopkeepers here say they'll close their doors when the
controllers leave. They're not optimistic that foreigners will want
to come and set up business here,'' said Luis Pereira of the
commercial radio station in Vilo do Porto.
   Because of their isolation, Azoreans are superstitious and
religious on one hand and open to travel, adventure and foreign
ideas on the other. The latter is a main theme of the novel ``O
Barco e O Sonho'' (``The Boat and the Dream'') by the Azorean writer
Manuel Ferreira.
   Recently turned into a popular Portuguese television series, the
novel tells of two Azoreans who build a tiny sailboat to cross the
Atlantic in search of a new life.
   They see the America of the 1950s as ``a marvellous world over
the sea ... its flag _ a shower of stars and dollars.''
   Emigration has always been a safety valve against poverty, famine
and unemployment on the Azores.
   Between 1960 and 1980, some 160,000 Azoreans emigrated, mainly
for the United States and Canada. Today emigrants and their
descendants in North America number about a million _ four times as
many as live on the islands.

<HEAD>Byrne's `Ile Aiye' Starts New Season of `Alive From Off Center'</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KATHRYN BAKER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Television Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   When David Byrne creates a rock group, it's the
brilliant ``Talking Heads.'' When he makes a movie, it's the unique
social satire ``True Stories.''
   So it's not surprising that when he makes a documentary, it's the
unusual and enlightening ``Ile Aiye.'' Byrne's one-hour offering can
be seen on most PBS stations Wednesday, opening the new season of
the alternative film and video series ``Alive From Off Center.''
   Byrne's film is a portrait of Candomble, a religion practiced in
Bahia, the northeastern province of Brazil, by descendants of
African slaves.
   ``Ile Aiye'' means ``the house of life.''
   Pulsating music is an integral part of the high-spirited and
graceful rituals of Candomble. Byrne, like many composers and
musicians, has a long-standing fascination with the Afro-American
influences on American rock and jazz.
   ``The music led me to ask what was the underlying spirituality
underneath the music,'' he said at a cafe near his home in
Manhattan's Soho section. ``I honestly think that some kind of
spirituality that has some of the elements that that kind of
religion has is going to be our saving grace.
   ``It's going to help us survive, because it's a certain kind of
spirituality that doesn't deny any part of human nature, like
sensuality or sex or good or evil. They're all thrown in there.
   ``One could say that this religion helps people get along with
one another in funny way. Because each person is presumed to be
ruled by a specific god. ... People can kind of get along with
people whose behavior is different from theirs. They don't try to
make everybody behave the same, act the same. They can say, oh, that
persons acts that way because Oshun rules their head.
   ``Look at it on the good side, it works that way,'' Byrne said,
adding with a smile, ``on the bad side, it can be just an excuse.''
   Byrne had arrived at the restaurant toting a small tape recorder
he uses for orally jotting down lyrics. He's working on a new album
for release in the fall featuring Latin jazz musicians from New York
no doubt strongly influenced by the music that is an integral part
of Candomble.
   Byrne first went to Bahia in 1987 on the way to a film festival
in Rio de Janeiro. On the return trip to do the film, he attended
several Candomble ceremonies before asking permission to film them.
   ``Ile Aiye'' utilizes split screens and inserts rather than
narration to tell the story. Information is presented mostly through
music and image for the viewer to absorb.
   ``A lot of these techniques, they used to be used sometimes in
narrative films and sometimes in rock videos and stuff,'' said
Byrne, ``and sometimes in those contexts they don't make much sense
or they don't serve any purpose other than being kind of groovy. But
in a documentary, you might be able to use them where they actually
convey more information.
   ``Sometimes we'd show a pan of the city, we'd show it 50 years
ago and as it is today at the same time. We don't tell you all that,
but you get the idea. And sometimes if somebody's making an offering
of a basket, we show in an insert them making the basket.
   ``It seemed a way to include all those kinds of cross-references
and things without having to say it. You can pick it up visually and
you don't have to have an intrusive voice come in and tell you about
it.''
   Byrne doesn't pretend that his documentary is a work of
journalism. In fact, he left out one important ritual of Candomble,
animal sacrifice, because he figured it would be off-putting, even
though the animals used in the ritual are also used as food.
   ``I think you can get a sense of the religion without it, without
seeing it. It's something they don't do all the time. They
apparently would do it only on festival days, if they can afford it,
if they can afford a goat or some chickens or whatever. ... Part of
the price we had to pay for filming was to buy a couple of goats and
chickens and stuff like that _ and we'd all get to eat pretty good
later, too.''

   Elsewhere in television:
   PAYING THE BILL _ The MacArthur Foundation has given public
television documentarian Bill Moyers $5 million. For the next three
years, $3.75 million will go for production of Moyers' series ``A
World of Ideas.'' The other $1.25 million will be for new
productions. ``A World of Ideas'' previously benefited from a
MacArthur Foundation grant that also helped fund Moyers' critically
acclaimed series of interviews with mythologist Joseph Campbell.

<HEAD>Scholar's Work Being Revised Because Scrolls Were Inaccessible</HEAD>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   In 1972, Bible scholar Delbert Hillers completed
what was intended as the most thorough, comprehensive volume on the
Old Testament Book of Lamentations.
   Now he has to revise it because he and scholars generally were
unaware that much earlier chapters of Lamentations had been
available for years in the Dead Sea Scrolls, but only a select group
knew about it.
   The particular chapters have finally been issued, but more than
half of the immense trove of ancient manuscripts remains hidden from
public view.
   Furor erupted anew this week over the long delay in releasing
much of the scroll contents. It's been ``a problem'' to get access
to the scroll material, said Theresa Dorsogna, an editor for
Doubleday publishers of the huge Anchor Bible series, expected to
exceed 70 volumes, of which Hillers' book is a part.
   ``It's something that scholars have been fighting for a long
time,'' she said in a telephone interview. ``It works a real
hardship on them.'' Hillers, of Johns Hopkins University, was
expected to have his revision finished by year's end.
   The scrolls contain parts of every book in the Old Testament
l,000 years older than any ever available before, as well as
extensive material on first- century Judaism in which Christianity
arose.
   David Noel Freedman, professor of biblical studies at the
University of Michigan and editor of the Anchor Bible series, said
the scroll team kept their work ``in the dark while a whole
generation has gone by.''
   The delay has ``been almost 40 years, and that's too long to keep
the material from public scrutiny,'' he said. ``It's a serious
matter and long past time for some changes.''
   Less than half of the scrolls have been published, although the
first were discovered in a cave near the Dead Sea in 1947 and many
more were found in 11 caves over the next decade.
   They've been in the hands of a small international team of
scholars since the early 1950s, now overseen by Israel's Department
of Antiquities.
   Their editor-in-chief, John Strugnell, Harvard University
professor of Christian origins, said the work was being speeded up
and hopes were to have all the manuscripts published by 2000.
   ``It's slow business,'' he said. ``We are producing. And we're
getting faster. An immense amount of work is being done.''
   He noted that only three volumes of the scrolls had been produced
in the first 20 years of the project, nine of them since 1976. He
said only a third to half of the material has been published so far.
   Strugnell scoffed at suspicions once voiced that religious
authorities, such as the Vatican, were covering up the materials
because they threatened church teachings. ``Anyone who would believe
that would believe anything,'' he said.
   The notion also was derided in the current bimonthly, Biblical
Archeology Review, which had raised new challenges to the delay in
issuing the scrolls, calling it a ``conspiracy of silence and
obstruction.''
   But the magazine said it had ``tried to scotch these rumors'' of
religious supression, and ``we do not believe there is any credible
evidence'' for such conclusions.
   There also was early speculation linking Jesus to the Qumron
community of ascetics called the Essenes, who produced the Dead Sea
documents, but Strugnell said this has ``virtually been dropped.''
   However, Jesus' movement and the Essenes were contemporary, he
noted. ``The two groups lived in the same century and there must
have been some contact, but it was no closer than that,'' he said.
   Concerning complaints about a still unpublished scroll letter
from the Qumron community leader, the ``Teacher of Righteousness,''
to Jerusalem's high priest, Strugnell said it should be out by
year's end.
   ``That's a top priority,'' he said.
   The high priest, whose leadership the Qumron community had
rejected, was the same one that pushed for the elimination of Jesus.
   Strugnell said while the material on first-century Judaism did
not refer directly to Jesus, ``it relates to the background of
Christianity'' in that period and country.
   Freedman, who alternates teaching at the University of Michigan
and the University of California at San Diego, said that among still
unpublished documents are parts of the two books of Samuel and the
book of Jeremiah.
   Such material ``belongs to the whole scholarly community and
should be released right away,'' he said. He said after such
archeological finds, photographic slides should be generally
available within a year or two.
   The Anchor Bible series issued its first volume in 1965 on the
book of Genesis, and is scheduled to issue its 47th volume this fall
on the book of Amos, with 70 volumes expected to be out by 2000.

   What was termed the first
multi-denominational baptism service since the 16th century
Protestant Reformation was held recently at the Roman Catholic
cathedral here before about 1,000 people.
   Taking part in the 90-minute service were bishops of the
Catholic, Episcopal, Armenian Orthodox and Lutheran churches. Four
children were baptized, one from each church, using the same liturgy.
   In a sermon afterward, Kathleen Hurty, National Council of
Churches secretary on local ecumenism, told the children:
   ``As you grow older, you will come to appreciate the richness of
God's gift given you today. And you will remember that we are one
family: Orthodox, Anglican, Roman Catholic and Protestant, with an
extended family of all who believe.''

   An American scholar on Soviet religion said
legislation has been proposed by the Soviet Council on Religious
Affairs that would legalize most church activities there.
   Kent Hill, executive director of the Institute on Religion and
Democracy, says copies of the draft Law on Freedom of Conscience has
been provided to the church and is further evidence of a ``genuinely
liberalizing situation.''
   In a telephone interview with Religion News Service, he said the
law would give Christians opportunities to spread faith openly and
provide religious education for children and alternative services by
conscientious objectors to military draft.

   Already working on a project to help send a

jolted by word that Christians there need at least 20 million.
   Terje Hartberg, a publishing consultant, says Russian Orthodox
leaders told him the demand for Bibles ``would not even slow down''
until at least that number were in the hands of the people.
   Bishop Vladimir, deputy head of Russian Orthodoxy's external
affairs department, was quoted as saying that not only believers but
non-believers want Bibles.
   The Rev. Cirilo A. Rigos of Reading, England,, general secretary
of United Bible Societies, which includes about 100 national
societies, says the request ``is without a doubt the greatest
challenge we have ever faced _ and we welcome it.''

<HEAD>Official Says Zimbabwe Gives Up on Socialism and Seeks Investors</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ANGUS SHAW</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>BULAWAYO, Zimbabwe (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Zimbabwe has made a U-turn on the road
to socialism set out by President Robert Mugabe and is opening the
way to foreign investors, a Cabinet official says.
   ``Even dreaming of socialism is a non-starter,'' Hebert
Ushewokunze, the minister of political affairs, told businessmen
assembled here recently. ``We won't see true socialism here. Nor
will our children.''
   Mugabe came to power after independence from Britain in 1980
vowing to lead the former colony of Rhodesia on a Marxist-Leninist
path, and his government introduced sweeping social and economic
changes.
   Those changes included cheap schooling, free health care, price
controls on a broad range of commodities and stringent, protective
labor laws that critics said promoted inefficiency.
   But Mugabe had inherited a mixed capitalist-style economy that
has remained largely in the hands of a 100,000-member white minority
that favors the free enterprise system.
   For years, government and the business community coexisted
uneasily. All the while, the economy stagnated and unemployment
increased.
   Next year, experts say, some 300,000 students will leave school
and enter an economy that is producing only about 7,000 new jobs a
year. Unemployed voters will outnumber employed voters 3-1 in the
1990 parliamentary election.
   So in May, after months of speculation that something of the sort
was coming, Mugabe announced a new investment code.
   It was expounded by Ushewokunze to the businessmen in Bulawayo,
Zimbabwe's second largest city after Harare, the capital formerly
called Salisbury.
   ``We have lifted the lid by inviting external investors,'' he
said. ``I don't see this investment atmosphere as conducive to the
goals of a socialist state.''
   The investment code, Zimbabwe's first, has brought a mixed
reaction. Many businessmen say it is too little, too late, while
radical students and others have condemned it as a sell-out.
   On June 9, Kempton Makamure, a university professor and an
outspoken Marxist idealogue, was detained by police for questioning
after criticizing the code on state radio as a violation of
socialist principles. Two journalists involved in the broadcast were
suspended.
   While Makamure and his disciples think the code strays too far
from socialist philosophy, a great many businessmen believe it
doesn't go far enough.
   ``We have been given a bone, but there's not enough meat on it,''
said Arthur Chapman, a business executive in Harare.
   A black entrepreneur, who requested anonymity, said the state's
ideological dilemma created an investment policy that ``was not
dramatic enough to attract the high rollers we really need.''
   The code allows foreigners to hold 25 percent of the share value
of new investments, up from 15 percent. It also permits them to send
25 percent to 100 percent of their profits to home offices in hard
currencies, depending on the type and priority of the investment.
   Mugabe also pledged less state interference in business affairs
and set up a ``one-stop center'' to approve investment applications
within a maximum of 90 days. He also proposed lifting most price
controls, scrapping fixed wages in favor of collective bargaining
and liberalizing labor laws.
   In the past, an employer had to have Labor Department approval to
fire any worker, and most such applications were turned down.
   ``We are not neo-colonialists looking for vast hard currency
returns,'' said one Western investment expert, speaking on condition
of anonymity.
   ``What we want is a strong economy we can do business with.
Zimbabwe has not made the quantum leap, but they've made a start.''

<TEXT>
   The birds are dead or gone. Maria San
Martin says she ``would like to have wings and fly away, too.''
   But she hasn't the money to leave. It's a plight shared by
thousands in this and other villages beneath southern Chile's
9,400-foot Lonquimay volcano, which rumbles and spits ash and toxic
gases since erupting Christmas Day.
   Lonquimay, a village of 3,800 people 21 miles from the volcano,
is surrounded by mountains that block the winds that could bring
fresh air in and blow the ash and gases out.
   According to a special government census, 10,472 people in
Lonquimay and several Indian reservations of the Mapuche tribe are
being affected. Doctors say most are suffering irreversible damage
to the central nervous system.
   A strong, disagreeable sulfurous odor pervades the area. Ash
lodges in people's teeth, their eyes itch and breathing becomes
difficult.
   Without birds, the dominating sound is the volcano's crackle and
roar, especially at night.
   ``Lonquimay is dead,'' said Mrs. San Martin, 43, the mother of
four.
   A team of 20 scientists, sent recently by the government's
National Science Commission, found that the air contained
potentially toxic levels of particles including silicon, iron,
calcium and aluminum. Fluoric, sulfuric and chloric gases also were
found, and the poisons were detected in the drinking water.
   According to local doctors, residents complain of headaches,
stomach and back pains, itching of the eye and throat.
   ``I feel terrible, I can't eat, and I feel totally
incapacitated,'' Nuria Quintana, 63, said. ``The government should
take us all out of here.''
   Doctors in the area agree that evacuation is a urgently needed,
but the government in Santiago, 375 to the northwest, has so far
refused.
   The subsecretary for regional development, Gen. Patricio Serre,
maintained that the symptoms were psychosomatic.
   ``People are living a psychosis because of something they think
might happen,'' he said during a recent visit. ``Air in Lonquimay is
pure and fresh, probably even better than in Santiago.''
   Santiago has a high level of smog.
   Serre said the government has allocated the equivalent of
$280,000 to help residents, especially those who have lost cattle to
the volcano. But he added that the area would not be declared a
catastrophe zone, which would make more money available.
   About 15 percent of Lonquimay's residents who had the money to go
elsewhere have left. Many others who must stay, including soldiers
and police assigned to the area, have sent their children away.
   A confidential report by the chief regional government health
official, a copy of which was obtained by The Associated Press,
seems to contradict Serre's assessment. The report, which recommends
evacuation, says: ``Human and animal life in the area is seriously
threatened, and the enviromental damage is grave.''
   Trees and plants died first, followed by the birds and other
animals. A man and an infant died recently, but government doctors
say there's no evidence they were the victims of the volcano.
   Many residents wear government-issued face masks of cotton gauze,
although experts said months ago they were ineffective. Only some
rich cattlemen, the military and police have masks with proper
filters.
   Animals are dying by the hundreds in the area, where most people
make their living raising a few head of cattle on small ranches.
   Hens and ducks have died by the thousands.
   Emaciated oxen and cattle were seen in the villages. Some could
not stand.
   The town's veterinarian, Carlos Ducom, said heavy concentrations
of fluorine are often found in dead animals. The fluorine damages
bones and causes paralysis, he said, and some dead cattle had as
much as 3{ pounds of ash in their stomachs.
   Erasmo Rivero, a father of five, said he wanted to sell his
animals but they were too sick.
   Without healthy oxen, people haven't been able to gather firewood
as the the snow and cold of the Southern Hemisphere winter begin to
arrive.
   Morelia Aguilera, a woman in her mid 40s, says she even misses
the cockroaches and the worms. ``My dogs no longer bark,'' she said.

<TEXT>
   As the ragtag Continental Army struggled
through the brutal winter at Valley Forge, Gen. George Washington
turned to colonists like Jacob De Haven, who died broke after
loaning $450,000 in money and supplies.
   Or did he?
   Every generation or so, somewhere in the country, someone
claiming ancestry to Jacob De Haven insists he did, and seeks
repayment. Whether interrupted by civil war or failure of Congress
to act, the efforts have been fruitless.
   In U.S. Claims Court in Houston, an attorney fresh out of law
school is awaiting the government's response to the latest request.
The lawsuit filed in March on behalf of some 50,000 De Haven
descendants asks for $450,000 plus 6 percent interest compounded
annually since at least Jan. 1, 1778.
   Put away your calculator _ that's a whopping $98.3 billion.
   This is the first attempt to go through the federal courts
instead of Congress, which was dunned in the 1850s, '70s, '90s and
early in this century. A repayment resolution was introduced, but
tabled, in the House in 1966.
   Jo Beth Kloecker, who took the case about two months after
hanging a shingle outside her first office, in Stafford, Texas,
expects the government's response to the suit _ due in May _
sometime this month.
   The claim is not without legal obstacles:
   The six-year statute of limitations expired about 205 years ago.
The suit seeks repayment from a United States that didn't exist when
the money was lent. And a receipt bearing a red seal of the
government has been missing for years.
   In addition, there's no record of a wealthy Jacob De Haven whose
family owned much of Upper Merion Township, now suburban
Philadelphia.
   According to tax records for 1769-1812, the area's only Jacob De
Haven lived in nearby Whitpain Township, owned an acre of land in
1791 and worked as a laborer, said Judith Meier of the Historical
Society of Montgomery County.
   ``There's no proof of a Jacob De Haven who lived in that time or
died'' who could have loaned $450,000, said Mrs. Meier, whose
curiosity was piqued by the family's claim. ``It looks like it's out
there hanging on an imaginary nail.''
   A family history describes the De Havens as the wealthy owners of
a tract stretching about 10 miles from Norristown to Philadelphia.
Mrs. Meier says the history is a fairy tale and the relatives of the
Jacob De Haven she found were all farmers, weavers, masons, tanners
and other tradesmen.
   The family history also puts De Haven's grave in the cemetery of
Christ (Old Swedes) Church, now in the shadow of an elevated stretch
of Interstate 76. The Rev. John Miller Jr., vicar of the Episcopal
church, said records don't show a Jacob De Haven and most of the
marble markers have been worn bare.
   Kloecker, however, thinks she's got a case.
   ``I know what you're talking about,'' she said of the lack of
records, adding that she has some unrecorded deeds showing Jacob De
Haven existed as in the legend. ``We've got some evidence. I can't
comment on what we've got.''
   Beyond deeds and tax records, the one piece of evidence that
would prove a loan was made _ a receipt _ has been gone for
generations, said Carl DeHaven, a descendant of Jacob's brother,
Samuel. DeHaven, a retired police officer who lives in Gulph Mills,
said it was probably kept in a family bible, now lost.
   Kloecker's client, Thelma Weasenforth Lunaas, is decended from
William De Haven, another brother of Jacob's. Kloecker is asking the
court to declare all the descendants of Jacob and his nine brothers
and sisters part of the class.
   ``They just want his ancestry recognized for his contributions,''
she said.
   DeHaven doubts any of the relatives will see any money.
``Nothing's ever been done over the years and I don't think anything
will be done this time.''
   He would be happy with a monument at Valley Forge National
Historical Park commemorating the De Havens and other families who
gave to the cause.
   In that legendary winter of 1777-78, Washington's troops were
encamped at Valley Forge, about 25 miles from British-occupied
Philadelphia. About 3,000 of the 11,000 troops living in crude log
cabins died. The Continental Congress couldn't appropriate any more
money to send food, so the call went out for citizens to lend the
army money and food.
   Jacob De Haven and many others responded, his descendants say.
Most were repaid after the revolution in Continental dollars. Jacob
refused to accept the unstable scrip, which Kloecker describes as
not ``worth a flip.''

   Seven newborns lie sleeping, swaddled in pink
and blue blankets and tucked into bassinets in a hospital nursery.
Six were born to mothers addicted to crack cocaine and then
abandoned.
   In the same pale yellow room with green curtains, a 6-month-old
girl smiles and gurgles in a swing near two children in playpens.
They, too, are ``boarder babies,'' whose addicted mothers abandoned
them.
   Hospital officials say boarder babies like these at Howard
University Hospital are taking up space that could be used for
treating sick children.
   ``Sometimes there's not a vacant bed in neonatal intensive care
between Richmond and Philadelphia,'' says hospital director Dr.
Haynes Rice.
   ``See that,'' he says, pointing to the baby in the swing, right
next to the infants. ``You shouldn't have them with newborns. But
what can we do?''
   The material cost for dealing with these children is high _ from
$750 a day to $1,768. The physical and psychological price is
immeasurable.
   Statistics gathered by the House Select Committee on Children,
Youth and Families suggest that 375,000 newborns a year may be
harmed by drug exposure and that last year 11 percent of pregnant
women used drugs.
   Although hospital officials say the number of boarder babies is
growing, the problem is so recent that nationwide statistics aren't
available. There's not even a standard definition, although Rice
defines boarder babies as infants who are ready for discharge but
have not had a parental visit for 30 days.
   A recent visit to the Howard hospital found 21 of the abandoned
children. They appeared healthy, although some had been born
drug-addicted.
   ``Healthy is a word I'd be careful about using with these
children,'' Rice says. ``They're not sick, but some of them will
have problems later on. We're told these babies will have problems
for the rest of their lives.''
   Two of the recent infants tested HIV positive, meaning they carry
the virus believed to cause AIDS.
   In the typical case, a multiple drug user gives birth, stays for
three days and goes, leaving behind what Rice calls ``these little
itty-bitty ones.''
   ``They just leave and you never know if they plan to abandon the
baby.''
   The sign on the nursery door says: ``Daily visiting hours
restricted between 10 a.m. and 12 noon.'' But the only visitors many
of the infants have are the busy nurses who tend to them when they
can.
   On another floor, an 11-month-old boy, the oldest boarder baby at
the hospital, sits in a carriage eating ice cream in a pediatrics
ward covered with wallpaper of clowns and Raggedy Anns. The nurses
call him by his name, Terrail, but to hospital officials he is
``Baby 3.'' A sick child wails in the background.
   Terrail is not ill but already is developmentally handicapped by
a life spent entirely in the hospital. The shortage of staff means
he can't crawl and play as youngsters his age normally would, and
the nurses say he hasn't taken any steps toward walking.
   ``It's wrong for a baby to be in a hospital for a year and not
sick,'' Rice says.
   Hospitals must swallow the cost of caring for the boarder babies,
an expense that eventually is passed along to the public through
higher fees and insurance premiums. Meanwhile, hospitals appeal to
the welfare bureacracy to find homes for the children.
   Nationally, boarder babies' fates varies by circumstance and
jurisdiction. After 11 months, Terrail has not been placed for
adoption or foster care.
   After 30 days the Howard hospital notifies the District of
Columbia Department of Human Services about the abandoned children.
But the babies wait as forms are filled and papers are processed.
   Out of desperation, Rice joined with the department to place ads
in local newspapers asking people to ``please open your home and
heart'' and adopt or take in one of the children. In the first three
days, the department received 30 inquiries.
   But ad responses alone are unlikely to keep pace.
   In California, for example, the foster child population increased
by 28 percent from 49,978 in December 1986 to 64,900 in December
1988.
   And as many as 60 percent of drug-exposed infants end up in the
foster care system, says Neal Halfon of the Children's Hospital in
Oakland.
   ``The dramatic increase in crack cocaine use is mirrored by
increases in the number of foster children,'' he said. ``An already
bad situation is becoming disastrous.''

   Mongolian cashmere sweaters hang from
Bloomingdale's racks and General Electric still hopes to sell China
its locomotives, but the $14 billion trade relationship between the
United States and the People's Republic has been damaged after years
of patient nurturing.
   Following the Tiananmen Square massacre and subsequent string of
executions, experts point to pockets of vulnerability among U.S.
companies working with China as well as a decline in Chinese imports.
   ``It won't be because Americans don't want to buy, but delivery
and reliability will be perceived widely as going down, and that
will affect orders irrespective of whether it's true,'' said David
M. Lampton, president of the National Committee on United
States-China Relations.
   China had replaced other Pacific Rim nations as a low-cost
producer of everything from clothing to luggage to tents while
steadily improving productivity and quality as workers became more
motivated.
   As Chinese workers and managers become more fearful of
associating with foreigners, Lampton said, ``The problem is going to
be whether the work force will continue to be as productive.
   ``Communications are snarled, we don't know if longshoremen will
load ships on time,'' and American importers just may not want to
deal with those uncertainties, he noted.
   Without Chinese imports, Americans would pay more for Nike
running shoes, silk blouses and painted porcelain bowls.
   Experts say toy and game importers, already stocking up for
Christmas, are scrambling to line up suppliers in other low-cost
nations such as Thailand and Mexico. Last year China exported $1.17
billion worth of toys and games to the United States.
   On the flip side, Midwest farmers would take a beating if their
exports were curtailed. Last year they shipped to China about $700
million in wheat, the largest U.S. export to the People's Republic,
according to the Commerce Department.
   Computer makers could lose a $150 million-plus outlet for their
goods.
   Military suppliers already are bearing the brunt of a
presidential decree prohibiting further sales to China. Grumman
Corp. said earlier this month it would eliminate 250 jobs associated
with a $500 million U.S. Air Force contract to develop and modernize
a weapons control system for Chinese fighters.
   U.S. companies that sell products like power-generating equipment
to the Chinese goverment could face trouble because China ``is going
to have a foreign exchange shortage,'' said Roger Sullivan,
president of the U.S.-China Business Council.
   ``They've taken a big hit on their balance of payments. They
can't buy what they thought they would buy, and they're going to
have to cut imports,'' he said.
   Roughly 80 percent of U.S. companies' investment in China lies in
industries that manufacture goods for the domestic market, Sullivan
said. Plans for expanding those operations are evaporating rapidly.
   But most U.S. businesses are not likely to suffer substantially.
While they have committed $3.4 billion to joint ventures in China,
each firm's individual exposure is limited.
   General Electric Co., for example, sold $500 million of
locomotives, aircraft engines and medical systems to China in the
last five years, but the number pales in comparison with GE's annual
revenue of $50 billion.
   And Ball Corp., a $1.1 billion-a-year container maker in Muncie,
Ind., has spent just $2 million since 1987 on its joint venture in
China.
   ``From our perspective, it's a very small percentage of sales,''
said Ball spokesman Brad Wilks.
   Still, companies do not want to mothball their China operations.
``It's clearly not because of the money,'' Sullivan said. ``It's the
effort. They've spent five or six years building'' relationships.
   For businesses, the attraction is formidable: China looms as the
world's fastest growing economy, with a gross national product
expanding at more than 10 percent a year.
   As a market for consumer goods, China is virtually untapped. The
nation's 1.1 billion population is a solid reason ``companies are
reluctant to just bag it. You can't just write off 25 percent of the
globe,'' one China watcher said.
   While most U.S. companies are taking a wait-and-see approach, a
few have found opportunity in the crisis. Jack Shamash, president of
the New York-based trading company Shamash &amp; Sons Inc., said he has
been snapping up Chinese-made products ranging from silks to nails.
   Now that Shamash's competitors are skittish about buying, prices
of Chinese-made goods are lower and the goods are more abundant.
   The U.S. Embassy in Beijing said some American staff of the 175
U.S. companies operating out of the Chinese capital are returning
despite a travel advisory and the embassy's counsel against it.
   The Chinese government is pulling out all the stops to lure
businessmen back, even as it simultaneously wages a media campaign
against the U.S. government for alleged interference.
   American companies are being bombarded with long-sought
concessions from the Chinese government and atypical promises of
prompt payment.
   Government-owned Noble Tower, a modern Beijing building that
houses foreign companies, sent faxes to every tenant ``asking them
to come back and that everything is peaceful,'' said one American
tenant.
   But businesses are wary that they may become pawns in China's
powerful propaganda game.
   ``We don't want to be in a position where we're manipulated and
paraded in front of cameramen,'' said Ball Corp.'s Wilks.

<HEAD>A ``Let's Get Together'' Summit?</HEAD>
<HEAD>An AP News Analysis</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By WALTER R. MEARS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Special Correspondent</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   It's an unlikely opening for a superpower
summit conference, the president of the United States calling the
leader of the Soviet Union to say, ``Hey, let's get together.''
   President Bush says maybe that's the way he'll arrange to meet
with Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev when the time comes. He's
not saying when that time will be, although he often is asked.
   When there is a Bush-Gorbachev summit, arrangements won't be
quite that casual, despite the president's breezy suggestion. But
his latest observations on summit prospects underscore that such
meetings usually are longer on drama than on diplomatic results.
   What Bush's cautious course toward Moscow lacks in excitement it
may make up in continuity. The president says he's comfortable with
the state of U.S.-Soviet relations and feels they are on the right
wavelength.
   He took his time getting there despite unilateral troop and
weapons cuts Gorbachev announced last winter and spring, scoring
public relations points in the process. Bush ordered a strategic
review and stuck to his methodical pace despite complaints in
Congress. He announced his proposal for swift, drastic cuts in U.S.
and Soviet forces in Europe at NATO on May 29.
   Bush said he'd never felt pressured. ``I said when I first came
in we were going to take our time and we were going to study and
we're going to think it out, and we did exactly that.''
   He seems to be handling summit talk the same way.
   ``There will, obviously, at some point be a meeting,'' he said
Tuesday, ``but I still feel I'd like the meeting to be seen as
productive rather than just the meeting itself.
   ``... I feel comfortable about the wavelength we're on with the
Soviet Union now.''
   Bush said he thinks the Soviets feel the same way, knowing that
the United States wants to move forward on strategic arms reduction
talks and on negotiations for conventional force cuts.
   He said that while a summit has to be seen as productive, that
doesn't necessarily mean signing an agreement as evidence of
progress. ``I would like to think that the criterion, the governing
criterion, would be so that the world would see the meeting as
having been successful, something good happening out of it.
   ``... I've been around this track long enough to know that you
can always whip out something to sign, a fishing agreement or
something of that nature.''
   Gorbachev and President Reagan did sign fishing and maritime
agreements at their Moscow summit in 1988. Their major arms treaty,
eliminating intermediate range nuclear missiles, was signed at a
Washington summit in 1987.
   They met five times, all during Reagan's second term. The
president who once called the Soviet Union an evil empire spoke at
the end of his terms about a satisfying new closeness in relations
with Moscow.
   No such mood swing is likely in the new administration. While
Bush thinks relations are headed in the right general direction, he
still is ``guided by a certain sense of caution,'' citing the
tremendous differences that remain with the Soviet Union.
   ``I must admit that I would not have predicted after first taking
office that some day I would be waxing nostalgic about my meetings
with Soviet leaders,'' Reagan said before his final summit, in New
York, with Bush on hand as president-elect. ``But here we are, for
the fifth time, Mr. Gorbachev and I together, in the hope of
furthering peace.''
   Bush said he won't insist that there be ``a major treaty of some
sort before I would sit down with Mr. Gorbachev.
   ``Maybe we'll do it like this: say, `Hey, let's get together.'
And I'm interested in what he thinks about it.''
   But it's clear that there is no hurry, and there is no high
expectation. There's a ration of realism in that. U.S.-Soviet summit
meetings usually have been significant because they were held rather
than for any specific results.

<HEAD>Nation's Largest Union Choosing New President, Charting Course</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JILL LAWRENCE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Education Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The National Education Association, a favorite
conservative target during the 1980s, convenes on Sunday to choose a
new leader and determine its course for the coming decade.
   It will be up to 8,500 delegates to decide whether the huge
teachers union continues its recent movement into the mainstream of
education reform efforts or harks back to the hard-line stands that
prompted repeated broadsides from President Reagan and former
Education Secretary William Bennett.
   The 2 million-member union, the country's largest, is a potent
political force with a formidable Washington presence and the
ability to organize in nearly every nook and cranny of the nation.
Reagan and Bennett constantly described it as an obstacle to better
education.
   NEA President Mary Futrell steps down this summer after six
tumultuous years during which she weathered the conservative
attacks, led the NEA into the reform movement and won overwhelming
affection from her troops.
   On Monday, delegates will choose between two candidates to
succeed her: Keith Geiger, an inside player and experienced
negotiator who as vice president has helped improve the NEA image,
and John Wilson, a self-described activist who promises never to
compromise for the sake of ``a good editorial.''
   The outcome of the Geiger-Wilson race will be one indication of
where the teachers want their union to go. Another clue will come
from the position the delegates take on public school choice, the
current rage among reformers and the primary education cause
advanced by President Bush.
   Choice plans allow parents to pick the schools their children
attend. Some operate within school districts but some let families
choose any school in the state. In Minnesota, for instance, state
money follows the students to any new district they choose, but they
have to provide their own transportation.
   Futrell predicts that choice will be ``the most hotly debated
topic'' at the meeting. Three proposed resolutions on the subject
reflect NEA attitudes ranging from militant opposition to serious
misgivings.
   The hard-liners, led by Wilson supporters in California, propose
that the NEA help state affiliates oppose choice plans and develop a
national strategy to fight the concept's spread. Without a national
effort against choice, the California affiliate said, ``state and
local agencies will foster educational discrimination and weaken
national commitment to public education.''
   At the other end is a more image-conscious resolution proposed by
the NEA board of directors. It says the NEA continues to support
alternative programs in public schools ``for specific purposes.''
Deliberately leaving a loophole, it adds that the NEA ``opposes
federal, state or locally mandated choice plans that compromise the
association's commitment to free, equitable, universal and quality
public education for every student.''
   The board's proposal is a revision of the third alternative, a
resolution on the original NEA conference agenda, with changes its
sponsor said make it ``more positive and less restrictive.''
   Futrell, at a news conference last week, said the NEA has always
supported magnet schools, alternative schools, alternative curricula
and other options.
   The board resolution ``basically says we do support some forms of
choice but we have to be very careful as we look at this new form of
choice'' to make sure the broader programs do not further segregate
schools along racial and economic lines, she said.
   Futrell described the California approach as ``very rigid.'' ``We
are hoping they will go with the more moderate position,'' she said
of the delegates.
   She hasn't said as much, but Futrell apparently hopes they will
go with Geiger as well. She has tried to steer the union to greater
flexibility on issues ranging from merit pay to teacher
certification, restore professional concerns to the NEA agenda and
generally ply a moderate course that is reflected in her vice
president's campaign literature and rhetoric.
   Futrell said last week she wouldn't make an endorsement unless
the race wasn't going the way she wanted it to go. So far, she said,
it was going her way.
   Geiger is reporting endorsements from at least 46 state and local
boards of directors or delegate assemblies, including large states
such as Florida, Pennsylvania and his home state of Michigan. He has
spent the last few years traveling to teacher events large and
small, in the process winning friends all over the country.
   By contrast, Wilson, of Raleigh, N.C., has won support from a
majority of his colleagues on the executive committee and majorities
on the budgetary committee and the board of directors.
   But neither man's high-powered endorsements may count for much
Monday, when the delegates will file state-by-state into a special
room at the Washington Convention Center to cast their secret
presidential ballots.

   Twelve years, three planets and 4.4
billion miles after leaving Earth, Voyager 2 is converging on
Neptune, a swirling, blue-green planet with a backward moon, for the
last stop on an extraordinary tour.
   ``The solar system is our neighborhood, and we're getting to the
end of the neighborhood,'' said Norm Haynes, Voyager project manager
at the National Aeronautics and Space Admnistration's Jet Propulsion
Laboratory.
   Voyager 2 already has detected a dark spot on Nep
a giant storm like Jupiter's Great Red Spot. As it nears the planet,
the probe will search for undiscovered moons and partial rings. And
at 9 p.m. PDT on Aug. 24, Voyager will swoop within 3,000 miles oftune
that may be
Neptune's north pole cloudtops _ the closest of its close encounters
and the first spacecraft to visit the planet.
   It will be 2.75 billion miles from Earth after traveling 4.43
billion miles along its curving path. The information it sends back
at the speed of light will take four hours and six minutes to arrive.
   Five hours after the closest encounter, Voyager will fly within
25,000 miles of the backwards-orbiting moon, Triton. The other known
moon is Nereid.
lion through the Neptune
encounter, the Voyagers ``returned more new knowledge about the
outer planets ... than existed in all of the preceding history of
astronomy,'' according to NASA.
   Neptune, discovered in 1846, is 30,700 miles in diameter _ six
times Earth's size and the fourth largest planet after Jupiter,
Saturn and Uranus. A Neptunian year lasts 165 Earth years, and a day
lasts 17 to 18 Earth hours _ a detail Voyager may pinpoint. Neptune
usually is the eighth planet, but because of Pluto's elongated orbit
Neptune will be the ninth and outermost until 2007.
   Scientists expect Voyager to discover at least 10 small moons,
said deputy project scientist Ellis Miner.
   Some moons may confine or shepherd the 5- to 12-mile-wide
incomplete rings, called ``ring arcs,'' orbiting Neptune, said
physicist Ed Stone, NASA's Voyager project scientist and a vice
president at California Institute of Technology.
   Voyager also may discover dust bands and 50 to 100 partial rings
in addition to the three to six arcs scientists believe they
detected from Earth, Stone added. The partial rings, possibly made
of dust and pebbles, most likely are debris from the collision of a
comet and an ancient moon, he said.
   Voyager should be some 33,400 miles above Neptune's clouds when
it crosses the ring region, so it is unlikely to be destroyed by an
unseen arc, he said.
   The probe also will study Neptune's weather. Scientists believe
the 6,200-mile-wide dark spot it found probably is similar to
Earth's hurricanes or Jupiter's Great Red Spot. The source of the
internal heat driving Neptune's storms is a mystery; Earth's comes
decaying radioactive material in rocks.
   Neptune is pale blue-green because methane, or natural gas, in
its mostly hydrogen-helium atmosphere absorbs red light. Scientists
suspect that a third of the way toward the planet's center the
atmosphere becomes a superhot slurry of hot water and rock, so
Neptune _ like neighboring Uranus _ probably lacks a distinct
sky-sea boundary, Stone said.
   Despite any internal heat, Neptune receives 900 times less
sunlight than Earth, so the temperature at the top of its atmosphere
is 350 degrees below zero Fahrenheit, about the same as on Triton,
Stone said.
   Scientists believe Triton _ 1,400 to 2,240 miles wide, roughly
the size of Earth's moon _ will be the most fascinating part of
Voyager's flyby.
   When a planet and its moons form from a spinning disk of gas and
solid material, the moons should orbit in the direction the planet
rotates. Triton's reverse orbit suggests it once orbited the sun
like a comet or a planet but collided with a moon to form a new
backwards-moving satellite, Stone said.
   Triton probably is cold and geologically inactive, with an icy
mantle over a rocky core. But it once may have had a molten interior
that created ridges, valleys, cliffs, canyons and volcanoes that
Voyager might photograph.
   Observations from Earth indicate Triton's atmosphere contains
methane and nitrogen. Sunlight likely converts methane into complex
hydrocarbons, creating a transparent reddish-orange photochemical
haze, Stone said. The hydrocarbons may form heavier particles,
coating the surface with frozen sludge.
   Could the organic chemicals have allowed life to develop on
Triton?
   ``The temperature is very, very cold, so I think it's unlikely,''
he said.
   Scientists believe Triton has extreme seasons because its orbit
around Neptune is highly inclined: One pole faces the sun for 82
years and the other remains in darkness. This may mean Triton's
atmosphere gets thinner and thicker as methane-nitrogen icecaps
cover one pole, then the other.
   Researchers discarded the theory that Triton has liquid nitrogen
oceans, but puddles or lakes are possible, along with fields of
nitrogen ice crystals, Stone said.
   Nereid, about 190 to 620 miles wide, has a very elongated
elliptical orbit. Caltech astrophysicist Peter Goldreich speculates
Nereid once had a circular orbit that was disturbed by gravity from
Triton or a large passing object.
   If Voyager confirms that Neptune has a magnetic field, the planet
also may have an aurora like Earth's, and a mysterious ultraviolet
``electroglow.'' A magnetic field should trap a radiation belt
around Neptune similar to Earth's Van Allen belts. Jupiter's
radiation belts damaged some of Voyager's equipment; Haynes doubts
similar problems at Neptune.
   Voyager 2 has worked 12 years with only relatively minor
failures, although it contains electronics equal to 10,000
television sets, he said.
   Commands sent to Voyager, and photos and information it sends to
Earth, travel at the speed of light. But the one-way trip still take
four hours, six minutes. NASA is using 38 dish-shaped radio antennas
in New Mexico, California, Australia, Spain and Japan to capture the
radio signal, which is like trying to see a 20-watt light bulb
burning 2.75 billion miles away.
   ``Both Voyagers are expected to return valuable data well into
the 21st century'' before their power supplies run out in about
2020, NASA said.
   After Neptune, Voyager 2 will join Voyager 1 and Pioneers 10 and
11 in seeking the true edge of the solar system, where solar wind
gives way to interstellar wind billions of miles beyond the planets.

   Imagine a 20-watt
refrigerator light bulb burning in the dark, 2.75 billion miles away.
   Now imagine the sophisticated eyes needed to see the light.
   Voyager 2, heading for Neptune, is emitting 20 watts of radio
signals, information coded in binary bits _ ones and zeros _ on the
space probe's health and from its scientific instruments and cameras.
   ``Think of that lightbulb as flickering, and that flickering
contains the information that Voyager is sending back to us,'' said
Bill Brundage, Voyager preparation manager for the Very Large Array
radio telescope.
   The signals have become fainter since Voyager's encounters with
Jupiter in 1979, Saturn in 1981 and Uranus in 1986. The signals, and
commands sent to the 12-year-old probe, take four hours and six
minutes to cross 2.75 billion miles at the speed of light. Larger
antennas and more sensitive receivers are needed on Earth to receive
the signals, and more power is needed to transmit commands to the
craft, which will pass fly within 3,000 miles of Neptune on Aug. 24.
   The National Aeronautics and Space Administration's Deep Space
Network is used to talk to Voyager. The DSN has three complexes:
Goldstone in California's Mojave Desert; Madrid, Spain; and
Tidbinbilla, Australia, near Canberra.
   When Voyager flew by Uranus, the California and Australian
listening posts used three antenna dishes each _ one 210 feet across
and two 112 feet _ and the Madrid station used one of each, said
Mary Beth Murrill, a spokeswoman for the NASA Jet Propulsion
Laboratory in Pasadena, Calif. The Canberra complex also was linked
to Australia's 210-foot Parkes Radio Astronomy Telescope.
   For Neptune, the 210-foot dishes at Goldstone, Canberra and
Madrid have been increased to 230 feet and another 112-foot antenna
was built at Madrid. In addition, the VLA is being used in
conjunction with Goldstone, Parkes again is linked with Canberra,
and a Japanese telescope will be added to the network.
   The different sites ensure that at least one station can
communicate with the spacecraft despite the Earth's rotation,
Brundage said.
   ``The VLA alone gives us almost a third more images than if we
didn't have it,'' said Norm Haynes, Voyager project manager at JPL.
   The VLA is a one-of-a-kind space-age erector set sitting on an
ancient lake bed. The site is skirted by four mountain ranges,
protecting it from much of the electronic interference from
television, radios, aircraft and the like.
   It consists of 27 white dish-shaped antennas, each 82 feet in
diameter, 92 feet high and weighing 235 tons. The dishes sit on the
Plains of San Augustin amid tumbleweed, cattle and sparse vegetation
at an altitude of 7,000 feet.
   The dishes are arranged along three arms of railroad track, laid
out in the shape of a Y. Two arms are 13 miles long and the third is
11.8 miles. The Earth rotates the Y like a turntable, creating
images that have the same detail as if using a radio telescope up to
26 miles in diameter.
   A special 36-wheel transporter moves each antenna to one of 72
observation stations along the three arms. This acts like a zoom
lens _ the farther out the dishes, the higher the resolution; the
closer in, the larger the field of view.
   NASA spent $6.5 million to equip each dish to receive Voyager's
signals. It also set up special techniques and installed two big
diesel generators to guard against lightning-caused power
fluctuations during the thunderstorm season.
   The separation of the listening posts around the world _ just
like the separation of the VLA dishes _ strengthen the sensitivity
of the network. The signal VLA gets from Voyager is sent via
satellite to Goldstone, where the two signals are combined, decoded
and sent via microwave to JPL in Pasadena.

<HEAD>TB Treatment Being Evaluated For Use Against Cancer</HEAD>

   The U.S. Food and Drug Administration is
evaluating the use of a tuberculosis vaccine derived from a harmless
bacteria to fight some forms of bladder cancer, which kills 10,000
Americans a year.
   The American Urological Association is urging the FDA to speed up
the approval process for the use of Bacillus Calmette-Guerin. FDA
spokesman Mike Shaffer declined to discuss details of the review,
but said it was ``pretty far along'' and that approval could come in
as little as a year.
   ``It isn't so much a matter of safety because it's already being
used for something,'' Shaffer said. ``It's a question of
effectiveness.''
   Doctors have known since the 1880s that severe bacterial
infections can shrink some tumors by stimulating the immune system.
``Some doctors actually treated patients with bacterial infections
before the advent of chemotherapy and radiation therapy,'' said Dr.
Donald Lamm, chairman of the urology department at the West Virginia
University Medical Center.
   Chemicals and radiation replaced bacteria therapy in the 1950s.
But research on BCG, which has been used as a TB vaccine since 1921,
continued because of its powerful effect on the body's immune system.
   Lamm said his research and studies by Memorial Sloan-Kettering
Cancer Center in New York have indicated that BCG is cheaper than
surgery and more effective than chemotherapy against early cases of
superficial bladder cancer.
   ``My frustration and the frustration of doctors caring for
patients with bladder cancer is that the FDA has failed to approve
BCG for use in treating the disease,'' said Lamm, who heads a
urological association committee that is urging the FDA to speed up
its approval process for BCG.
   Research indicates that BCG reduces the recurrence of bladder
cancer nearly twice as effectively as traditional chemotherapy and
dramatically decreases the mortality rate of bladder cancer
patients, he said.
   Doctors can treat bladder cancer patients with BCG only with
federal approval, and must warn patients that it is an experimental
treatment whose effectiveness and safety cannot be guaranteed, Lamm
said. ``They can receive the vaccine but their insurance companies
and Medicare won't pay for it.''
   A typical six-week treatment costs about $435 for the vaccine;
comparable chemotherapy costs would run from about $1,000 to $2,500,
he said.
   ``BCG has been used as an experimental cancer treatment for 20
years and it's been given to billions of people as a TB vaccine with
just a handful of deaths,'' said Dr. Michael Groves, head of the
pharmaceutical department at the University of Illinois at Chicago
Institute of Tuberculosis Research.
   The Chicago college was the only producer of thestrain of BCG
used in the United States until 1987, when it transferred production
to Bionetics Research Inc. of Rockville, Md., which is concentrating
on its use against cancer.
   BCG works best on the earliest stages of bladder cancer, before
the malignant cells have had a chance to spread to the deeper layers
of tissue to muscle that make up the balloon-shaped organ, Lamm said.
   Bladder cancer is the fifth most common cancer in the United
States. It kills about 10,000 Americans annually, typically male
smokers over age 50, and more than 47,000 new cases are expected to
be diagnosed this year. The most common warning signs are blood in
the urine and frequency of urination.

<HEAD>What Have All Those Moon Rocks Revealed to Scientists?</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By HOWARD BENEDICT</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   When two explorers first set foot on
the moon two decades ago, they found a lifeless world, baked by day
and frozen by night in temperatures ranging from 230 degrees below
zero to 270 degreees above.
   They found no wind, no storms, no clouds, no water, no magnetic
field, the thinnest of atmospheres and gravity one-sixth the
strength of Earth's.
   ``It has a stark beauty all its own,'' said Neil Armstrong. Buzz
Aldrin described it as ``magnificent desolation.''
   Armstrong, Aldrin and 10 other Americans who followed them to the
moon in the next 3{ years returned with 842 pounds of rocks and
soil. They left behind sensors that sent data on moonquakes,
meteors, radiation and the solar wind.
   Slowly, almost grudgingly, this trove is yielding secrets about
the moon and its place in the solar system.
   A picture is emerging of a birth in searing heat, a brief,
violent life of boiling lava and shattering collision, and
geological death 3 billion years ago when volcanic activity ceased.
The moon's surface has remained essentially unchanged since, except
by impact from an occasional meteorite and almost imperceptible
dustings from solar and cosmic radiation.
   This stability means much of the history of the solar system
during those 3 billion years can be read by studying lunar rocks.
But the revelations go back even further because samples dating to
more than 4 billion years and fragments at 4.6 billion _ back to the
begining _ have been found in the Apollo samples.
   Most experts agree the solar system was born 4.6 billion years
ago when great masses of gaseous matter called the solar nebula
began condensing to form the sun and planets. The nebula condensed
into debris ranging from pebbles to miles-wide boulders, that
collided and fused to create celestial bodies.
   Scientists believe the young Earth underwent the same period of
meteor bombardment and volcanism that the moon did for half a
billion years. The weak lunar gravity couldn't keep volcanic gases
from escaping into space. But Earth, with its stronger gravity, held
on to its volcanic vapors and they helped form an atmosphere and
oceans, creating conditions for the development of life.
   Because erosion, tides and weather have scoured Earth's surface,
the oldest rocks found date back only 3.7 billion years. The older
lunar rocks, therefore, are helping scientists piece together
Earth's formative years.
   However, less than 20 percent of the samples have been studied.
The rest are in air-tight, nitrogen-filled stainless steel cabinets
locked in vaults at the Johnson Space Center and at Brooks Air Force
Base in San Antonio, Texas.
   John W. Dietrich, deputy chief of the National Aeronautics and
Space Administration's Planetary Science branch and curator of the
material, said the samples will stay there until better analytical
techniques are found.
   The rocks have not revealed exactly how the moon originated, but
they have eliminated some old theories and raised a new one.
   Before Apollo there were three theories about the origin: that it
formed near Earth as a distinct body; that it was once a piece of
the Earth; and that it formed elsewhere in the solar system and was
captured by Earth's gravity.
   ``We have determined that all three of them are impossible. The
theory best accepted at the moment is a hybrid between two of
those,'' Dietrich said.
   The new theory is that the moon resulted from cataclysm: When
Earth and the other would-be planets were still partly molten a body
perhaps the size of Mars _ which has one-tenth the mass of Earth _
collided with our planet.
   The high-speed impact caused a giant explosion and the outer
layers of the intruder disintegrated, at least partially vaporizing
the rocky material. That and vaporized chunks from Earth's outer
layer were ejected, with some of the material flying high and fast
enough to orbit Earth, forming a ring.
   The vapors cooled and condensed into solid particles, which
coalesced over a few hundred or a few thousand years into the
primitive moon.
   ``That would explain why the moon has so many of the same
chemical properties as the Earth, but in different proportions,''
Dietrich said. ``It also would explain the low metallics on the
moon, the deficiencies in iron, and ... the loss of a lot of
volatile components that would have been vaporized and lost in the
collision.''

<HEAD>Murder-Victim ID Techniques To Be Used On Damaged Mummy</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOUISVILLE, Ky. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An anthropologist who reconstructs faces
to help identify murder victims has taken up a case that's 3,400
years old.
   Virginia Smith is working on the face of the mummy of Then-Hotep,
an Egyptian woman believed to have met a violent death. X-rays taken
of the mummy in 1985 revealed that both thigh bones were shattered
and her head was gashed.
   Smith is making a rubber mold of Then-Hotep's skull and will
build a clay replica of the woman's presumed features.
   The process involves a series of measurements to indicate the
thickness of tissue that would have covered specific points on the
skull, following formulas based on sex, age, weight and ethnic
background.
   Then-Hotep's mummy was damaged in the 1937 Ohio River flood,
which washed away the dried skin and the ears and promoted growth of
mold on the linen wrappings. The mummy was baked and dried, but has
never been restored.

<HEAD>Researchers Nearing End of Three-Year Pine Forest Study</HEAD>
<DATELINE>EATONTON, Ga. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Some pine forests react to pollution while
others don't, and researchers hope by December to have some idea why.
   University of Georgia and Emory University researchers are
wrapping up a three-year study, costing $800,000 to $1 million, on
the effects of acid rain and other pollutants on pine forests.
   The researchers are particularly concerned about the loblolly
pine, one of the mainstays of Georgia's timber industry. The number
of loblolly pines in the region has decreased, though the drop may
have resulted from drought, changing land use patterns or normal
variation, said forest hydrologist John Dowd.
   The study is looking at material deposited by rain and
particulate matter in the air, as well as ozone, Dowd said. ``The
ozone is a photochemical oxidant not emitted by a source. It's
produced by the atmosphere. It's quite high in this non-urban area.
The air here is cleaner than that in the Northeast but it's dirtier
than that in the West. The air here is intermediate.''
   Researchers also are trying to determine whether acid rain pulls
nutrients from the soil, said biologist Larry Ragsdale of Emory.

   Share prices on the Tokyo Stock Exchange plunged in
early trading Thursday, while the U.S. dollar moved lower against
the Japanese yen.
   The dollar was changing hands at 143.30 yen at late morning.
Opening lower at 143.15 yen, down 0.40 yen from Wednesday's
143.55-yen close, the dollar moved in the range of 142.90 to 143.38
yen.
   The dollar closed at 142.98 yen in New York overnight.
   The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues, which shed
223.61 points Wednesday, lost another 266.71 points, or 0.80
percent, ending the morning session to settle at 32,978.89 points.
   Dealers said the index fell mainly because Japanese investors
were concerned about recent political instablity.
   A Nomura Securities dealer said a majority of institutional
investors remained on the sidelines, avoiding major moves due to
political uncertainty. The dealer spoke on condition of anonymity.
   On Wednesday, major Japanese newspapers reported Prime Minister
Sousuke Uno had expressed his desire to resign over reports that
allegations of a new sex scandal involving Uno may be carried in a
magazine later this week. Uno, in office less than a month, denied
any intention to resign.
   ``Mr. Uno's scandal had affected the foreign exchange rates and
weakened the yen, which further discouraged participants' buying
incentives,'' the dealer added.
   In currency dealings, traders said the dollar inched down earlier
in Tokyo as Japanese investors began selling it for profit-taking.
   Kyodo News Service reported the Bank of Japan intervened in the
market by selling dollars, which aided the currency in staying
lower. The intervention could not be confirmed through commercial
banks and the central bank does not comment on its monetary
activities.
   Minori Takeuchi, trader with Chemical Bank, said Thursday's
fluctuation was mainly due to by foreign investors' position
adjustments.
   ``Tokyo investors avoided making major moves,'' she said, ``and
very few people wanted to buy the yen because of Mr. Uno's geisha
scandal,'' she said.
   ``Also, Japanese investors are trying not to buy much yen before
the elections,'' Ms. Takeuchi said.
   Tokyo's elections for its prefectural council take place Sunday,
and elections for Japan's upper house of Parliament are scheduled
for July 23.

   Construction contracts fell by 3 percent in May,
although commercial building rebounded sharply from April, according
to an industry survey.
   The value of newly started construction contracts fell to an
annual rate of $249.9 billion last month from $256.8 billion in
April, the F.W. Dodge Group of McGraw-Hill Information Services Co.
said Wednesday.
   Despite last month's slight decline, the group said the
construction outlook in the second quarter and for the rest of the
year looked promising due to a downturn in interest rates.
   ``Lower interest rates in the rest of the year will help sustain
the current rebound, and we're upgrading our 1989 outlook for
construction,'' said George A. Christie, F.W. Dodge's chief
economist.
   Overall construction contracting for the first five months of the
year totaled $100.72 billion, down 1 percent from a year earlier.
   During May, newly started commercial, industrial and
institutional structures rose 11 percent to an annualized $91.4
billion, Dodge said.
   Industrial construction, which set the pace for nonresidential
work in May with a 40 percent increase, included a $300 million
expansion of a petrochemical complex near Houston.
   Residential building, meanwhile, slipped 9 percent in May to an
annualized $115.3 billion, largely due to previously higher interest
rates.
   Contracting for non-building construction, including public works
projects, fell 11 percent last month to an annualized value of $43.2
billion.

<HEAD>Who Lied? Business Week Tussles With Creator Of Joe Isuzu</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The advertising agency that created fibbing car
pitchman Joe Isuzu is charging that Business Week lied _ or rather
``lied'' _ in its June 12 issue about American Isuzu Motors Inc.'s
car sales.
   The quotation marks are important because The Wall Street Journal
had refused to run an advertisement about the accusation until the
agency put quotation marks around the word ``lied.''
   The full-page, $82,000 ad is scheduled to appear in Thursday's
editions of the Journal, according to Jerry Della Femina, chairman
of Della Femina, McNamee WCRS Inc., the agency that created the Joe
Isuzu character.
   In an article about the auto industry, Business Week accurately
reported in a one-sentence mention of Isuzu that the company's car
sales fell 38 percent last year. But it failed to note that Isuzu's
sales of trucks and other vehicles, which account for 80 percent of
its business, rose 4 percent.
   The magazine said the Joe Isuzu character ``hasn't created a
positive image for Isuzu.'' The character smiles as he spouts
exaggerations or untruths about the vehicles while captions point
out, ``he's lying.''
   Business Week ran the agency's letter to the editor criticizing
the article. But the magazine turned down Della Femina's ad, ``the
reason being we did not lie, and the ad says we lied. It's not a
logical ad as far as we're concerned,'' spokeswoman Mary McGeachy
said Wednesday.
   ``They're angry and they want to kill me but the fact is they
managed to screw up a very successful character and make it seem
like it wasn't doing well, when it really is,'' Della Femina said in
an interview Wednesday.
   Della Femina said his agency, rather than the automaker, was
paying the full cost of the Wall Street Journal ad. He said it may
run in other publications as well. He said he was pleased with the
addition of the quotation marks around ``lied.''
   ``I didn't want it to be that strident. I was just so mad when I
wrote it,'' he said.
   The Wall Street Journal, by company policy, declines to comment
on ads appearing in forthcoming editions. But Robert Higgins, the
Journal's director of advertising services, said Wednesday, ``I have
talked to Jerry and we did work something out.''

<HEAD>Avon's Sale of Health Care Unit Falls Through</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Avon Products Inc. says it has called off an
agreement to sell the health care operations of its Mediplex Group
partly because the buyer appeared unable to get financing for the
deal.
   The sale agreement with an acquisition group called West Corner
also was terminated because of a lawsuit filed by Meditrust, which
leases properties to Avon's Mediplex division.
   Meditrust, a real estate investment trust that specializes in
health care properties, contends that it has the right to approve
buyers of the Mediplex holdings under terms of its property leases.
   Avon said Wednesday it may sue Meditrust for interfering in its
sale plans.
   The deal with West Corner was to have closed on June 30 but it
appeared that the acquisition group wouldn't be able to raise
adequate financing by then, Avon said.
   Under the agreement, Avon was to receive $55 million in cash for
the Mediplex health care division.
   Mediplex's health care business includes nursing homes, alcohol
and drug abuse treatment centers and psychiatric treatment
facilities. Mediplex, based in Wellesley, Mass., also has a
construction division which has about $100 million of work in
progress. Once the work is finished Avon intends to close the
construction arm of Mediplex.
   The Mediplex sale was to be an element in the cosmetics maker's
strategy to divest its holdings in the health care services field so
it could concentrate more closely on its beauty products business.
   This strategy came under intense scrutiny earlier this spring as
Avon fought off an unsolicited $2.1 billion takeover bid from
another direct-selling company, Amway Corp. Avon's board rejected
the bid and Amway withdrew its offer.
   Avon said it still plans to sell Mediplex and noted that Mediplex
has become profitable so it won't be a drain on its parent company.
   The collapse of the deal with West Corner won't impair Avon's
financial prospects, the company said. Earnings still are expected
to range between $2.30 and $2.40 a share this year, Avon said in a
news release.

<HEAD>FCC Allows LIN To Transfer Control Of TV Station Licenses</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAY ARNOLD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Federal Commmunications Commission says it
will allow LIN Broadcasting Corp. to transfer control of the
licenses of seven television stations to a new company, LIN
Television Corp.
   The commission, ruling Wednesday that the proposed transfer was a
routine transaction that does not violate FCC rules, said it would
remain neutral as to whether or not the transfer would affect the
$6.5 billion hostile takeover bid McCaw Cellular Communications has
made for LIN.
   LIN announced in late May _ a week before McCaw's tender offer _
that it would spin off its television stations. The New York
City-based LIN said it would operate its cellular telephone and
specialty publishing business as a separate company, with LIN
shareholders to own stock in both LIN Broadcasting and LIN
Television.
   The decision by LIN was viewed as an attempt to complicate
McCaw's takeover bid, which would combine two of the nation's
largest cellular telephone companies.
   McCaw, through MMM Holdings, objected to the LIN transfer at the
FCC.
   McCaw, which is the nation's largest cellular company with 50
million potential customers, on June 6 said it would offer $120 a
share for the 90.2 percent of LIN it does not already own. With the
merger the Kirkland, Wash.-based McCaw would have 68 million
potential customers.
   But McCaw made its tender offer contingent on LIN staying intact.
LIN has lucrative cellular franchises in New York, Los Angeles,
Philadelphia, Dallas and Houston. McCaw has cellular operations in
Seattle, San Francisco, Miami, Denver, Minneapolis and Portland, Ore.
   McCaw told the FCC that approving the transfer would allow LIN to
use the spin-off as a ``tactical weapon'' which ``would unduly favor
incumbent management'' in violation of commission policy.
   McCaw also said Securities and Exchange Commission rules require
that LIN's board consider McCaw's offer.
   But the FCC said LIN's proposal was ``a quintessential pro forma
transfer of control, a corporate restructuring which does not result
in a substantial change in the ownership or control of the licensed
facilities.''
   ``We conclude that it would inappropriately thrust the FCC into
the midst of this hostile tender offer if we were to act in a
non-routine manner here,'' the FCC said in a statement signed by
Alex Felker, chief of the commission's mass media bureau.
   The FCC said it would leave it to the SEC to decide whether LIN's
board of directors was properly considering McCaw's tender offer.
   The television stations are: WAND, Decatur, Ill.; W68AA,
Danville, Ill.; WAVY, Portsmouth, Va.; WOTV, Grand Rapids, Mich.;
WISH, Indianapolis; WANE, Fort Wayne, Ind.; KXAS, Fort Worth, Texas;
and KXAN, Austin, Texas.

<HEAD>IBM Announces New Personal Computer Advertising</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   International Business Machines Corp. is
beginning a third wave of advertising for its personal computers
today, and this time there are no famous characters akin to Charlie
Chaplin's Little Tramp or the cast of M-A-S-H.
   The tag line of the new campaign is ``How're you going to do it?
PS-2 it!'' The television ads are singing commercials and the print
ones are based on cartoons by artists for The New Yorker magazine.
   The new campaign is the first major one prepared for IBM by
Lintas:New York, which is dividing IBM's account with Wells, Rich
Greene Inc. Those agencies took over last year when IBM fired Lord
Federico Einstein Inc., the creator of the Little Tramp and M-A-S-H
ads.
   A company spokesman, Ray Meurer, described the new ads as ``bold
and contemporary.''
   ``The ads respond to business people who say they want to use the
computer as a competitive tool today and in the future,'' IBM said.
   The TV commercials will air during the Wimbledon tennis
tournament coverage Saturday and Sunday and during the All-Star
Baseball Game on July 11. The print ads were scheduled to start
running Thursday in publications such as The Wall Street Journal,
Business Week, Forbes and Fortune, the company said.

<DATELINE>ORLANDO, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A state panel has endorsed a $500 million,
300-mph magnetically levitated train that would run between the
Orlando airport and Walt Disney World.
   The Florida High Speed Rail Transportation Commission voted
Wednesday to recommend certification of the project, subject to a
list of conditions aimed at satisfying a number of concerns. The
train's builders say it will be a showcase project to demonstrate
the technology worldwide.
   ``This project is of major significance to Florida because it
brings in absolutely brand-new technology'' that may eventually be
blended into a mass transit system for the area, Commission Chairman
Malcolm Kirschenbaum said.
   The governor and his Cabinet will make the final decision on the
project after a series of public hearings.
   In making a recommendation for certification, the commission's
executive director, Charles H. Smith, said, ``The project is
financially feasible and no public subsidies are needed.''
   Under the plan, the 17.5-mile long system would be built by
Maglev Transit Inc. and would begin operating in 1994.
   The technology involves powerful magnets that levitate the train
a fraction of an inch above an elevated track, eliminating friction
and allowing high speeds.
   Magnetic levitation trains have been used experimentally in Japan
and Germany for years, but no commercial system is in operation.
   Transportation experts expect other cities in this country and
other nations to follow Orlando's lead if the technology is
successfully demonstrated with paying customers.
   ``The key is to get one system to operate successfully, and
people will just jump on board, and they will say this is the way to
go,'' said Jim Powell, a scientist at the Massachusetts Institute of
Technology.
   Maglev and other high-speed rail systems are seen as one answer
to highway traffic congestion and crowded airports.
   ``The interest is just picking up all over the country,'' said
Robert Casey, director of the High Speed Rail Association, a
Pittsburgh trade group.
   Sen. Daniel Moynihan, D-N.Y., a major booster of maglev trains,
intends to lobby the Bush Administration to allocate at least $1
billion to help U.S. industry develop the technology, said a staff
member.
   Powell, who pioneered maglev research during the early 1960s,
said government funding and lack of interest halted research in this
country in the early 1970s. But West Germany and Japan continued
working and are now the leaders in the field.

<HEAD>Business Optimism For Third Quarter Declines Slightly</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Business executives have lowered their
expectations for third-quarter sales and profits in line with
economic data suggesting the economy is slowing, according to a
national survey.
   Most of the 1,500 business executives polled believe the economy
will slow enough to curb inflation in the July-September period but
not enough to fuel a full-blown recession in the second half, said
the report, released Wednesday by Dun &amp; Bradstreet Corp.
   The latest quarterly Survey of Business Expectations by the
business research company was conducted May 15-31 and included
manufacturers, retailers and wholesalers.
   The decline in optimism was particularly strong among
manufacturers, due to the recent rise in the dollar against major
currencies and increased foreign competition, said Joseph W. Duncan,
Dun &amp; Bradstreet economist.
   Nevertheless, overall optimism remained at historically high
levels, he said.
   ``The recent declines in interest rates, as well as continued
exports to Europe and Japan should continue to boost manufacturers'
sales,'' Duncan said.
   The Sales Optimism Index declined to 67, down seven points from
the second quarter and off six points from the third quarter of
1988, the survey found.
   Manufacturers were the least optimistic, followed by wholesalers
and retailers.
   Profit expectations also fell, down 8 points to 61 from a
five-year high of 69 in the second quarter. However, the outlook for
higher profits remained slightly higher than in the first quarter of
1989.
   Manufacturers and wholesalers believe prices will not rise as
much as in the second quarter but retailers expect to see some
gains. That index posted a seven-point drop to 39.
   Business executives also expect tighter inventories, fewer new
hires and lower durable goods orders, the survey showed.
   The survey's indexes are calculated by subtracting the percentage
of respondents predicting decreases from the percentage of those
expecting increases.

<TEXT>
   A union official told Congress that the
government should closely monitor an industry-sponsored study and
also undertake its own study of potential health hazards facing
workers at semiconductor manufacturing plants.
   Barbara J. Easterling, executive vice president of the
Communications Workers of America, said Wednesday that employees at
semiconductor factories frequently work under ``very dangerous
conditions.''
   ``The carnage in the semiconductor workplace is not scored in the
spilled blood of wage earners or visible damage to their bodies,''
she said. ``Instead, it is imposed on the invisible world of
workers' chromosomes and tissues through ingestion of hazardous
substances.''
   The Semiconductor Industry Association, representing the
country's major semiconductor manufacturers, is currently sponsoring
a three-year study in response to concern over reported high rates
of miscarriages among pregnant workers and other potential health
effects.
   Testifying before the House Education and Labor subcommittee on
health and safety, Ms. Easterling said that ``the National Institute
for Occupational Safety and Health should closely oversee the
Semiconductor Industry Association study.''
   ``In fact, it would be best if the federal government initiated
its own study of semiconductor factories, utilizing government
scientists to examine possible health hazards,'' she said.
   The communications union represents about 7,000 employees of
semiconductor manufacturers, while most workers in the industry are
not covered by union contracts.
   Potentially hazardous substances to which workers can be exposed
at semiconductor plants include toxic solvents, acids, caustics,
metals, plastics, resins and asbestos. Workers also may be exposed
to radio-frequency radiation, lasers and ultraviolet light.
   Lee Neal, the Semiconductor Industry Association's director of
occupational health, safety and environmental programs, told the
House panel that ``SIA has sponsored the development and maintenance
of the most comprehensive industry-sponsored occupational injury and
illness surveillance system in operation in the U.S.''
   He said Labor Department statistics show that in 1987, the rate
of occupational injury and illness was 4.3 cases per 100 employees
in the semiconductor industry, as compared with an average of 11.9
cases for all manufacturing sectors.
   Late last year, Neal said, SIA signed an agreement with the
University of California at Davis to undertake the three-year, $3
million study to examine the health of workers at 16 semiconductor
manufacturers.

<HEAD>Miller Says Safety Violations on Offshore Rigs Are Going Unpunished</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DIANE DUSTON</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Rep. George Miller, chairman of a House
Interior subcommittee, says that thousands of safety violations on
offshore oil rigs are going unpunished.
   The California Democrat told reporters Wednesday that ``the
failure to enforce the offshore oil drilling law shows the
scrupulous indifference of the Reagan administration and its
successor toward environmental law enforcement.''
   Miller, head of the subcommittee on water, power and offshore
energy resources, said he has learned that 16,000 safety violations
were found on such rigs in the last four years but no civil
penalties have been imposed and there has been only one criminal
punishment.
   Miller said his office began investigating offshore rigs when
word was received of a $750,000 criminal penalty against Texaco last
year for failing to conduct certain safety tests on a rig off the
California coast in 1986. Through information from the Interior
Department's Minerals Management Service, Miller said he found that
civil penalities stopped in 1983.
   In that year, a federal court, acting on an appeal of a case
involving Chevron U.S.A. Inc., ruled that civil penalities could be
assessed but only after the responsible party was given notice of
the violation and a reasonable period to correct it.
   Miller said he has asked for information about what kind of
follow-up, in lieu of fines, is done by the service. Interior
Secretary Manuel Lujan said in a June 2 letter to Miller that the
service is working on guidelines that would comply with the 1983
federal court requirements.
   Miller said the Interior Department should have acted long ago to
correct its enforcement policies, and ``by its inaction, the Bush
administration has extended the Reagan-Watt-Hodel lackadaisical
approach toward the environmental hazards of offshore oil
drilling.'' James G. Watt and Donald P. Hodel were interior
secretaries under President Reagan.
   ``We're just getting access to information as to exactly how bad
the previous administration was and how hard they were working to
diminish the effectiveness of the federal government,'' said Miller.

<HEAD>Dollar Down, Tokyo Stocks Off Sharply</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The U.S. dollar edged down against the Japanese yen
today, while the Tokyo Stock Exchange's key index plunged.
   The dollar closed at 142.90 yen, down 0.65 yen from its 143.55
yen close the previous day. It opened at 143.15 yen and ranged
between 142.85 yen and 143.38 yen. The dollar had climbed 3.37 yen
in the two previous trading days.
   The 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average shed 289.29 points, or 0.87
percent, closing at 32,956.31. The index had lost 223.61 points
Wednesday.
   Stock dealers attributed the index's fall to a lack of energy in
the market amid uncertainties over the political effects of
allegations that new Prime Minister Sousuke Uno had kept paid
mistresses in the past.
   In thin trading today, volume on the first section was estimated
at 400 million shares, down from Wednesday's 600 million.
   Kazuhiro Nomura, a dealer with the New Japan Securities Co., said
most investors stayed on the sidelines due to uncertainties over
domestic politics and fluctuations in the foreign exchange rate.
   ``The stock market has been gradually recovering from the initial
impact of Mr. Uno's geisha scandal, but many institutional investors
were still reluctant to buy any issues,'' he said.
   On Wednesday, major Japanese newspapers reported that Uno had
expressed a desire to resign, after less than a month in office,
over allegations concernin his ``woman problems.'' Uno denied any
intention to resign.
   ``Also, we can't expect much buying incentive among Japanese
market players before the major elections,'' Nomura added.
   Tokyo citizens vote Sunday for their municipal council, and
elections for Japan's upper house of Parliament are scheduled July
23.
   In currency dealings, traders said the dollar's fall resulted
from selling for profit-taking.
   ``Although Japanese market players had little incentive to buy
the yen, they were not aggressive enough to buy the dollar beyond
the 144 yen level either,'' said Bank of Tokyo trader Masafumi
Koyama. ``That's because they're afraid the dollar might keep rising
again after surpassing that level.''
   After the currency rose beyond the 144-yen level June 12, it kept
rising and reached a close of 151.30 yen on June 15. Many investors
consider 144 yen as a dividing point that determines market
direction.
   Koyama said Japanese investors also were generally pessimistic
over the ruling Liberal Democratic Party's prospects in the upcoming
elections and were reluctant to make major moves.
   The Bank of Japan was believed to have sold dollars to support
the yen, but neither the amount nor the intervention were confirmed.
The central bank does not comment on its foreign exchange market
activitites.

<HEAD>European Banks Raise Interest Rates</HEAD>
<HEAD>By The Associated Press</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Several key European central banks announced today they would
raise interest rates in a move that took financial markets by
surprise and put pressure on the dollar.
   West Germany's Bundesbank led a wave of rate hikes when it
announced it would raise the nation's discount and Lombard rates by
a half a percentage point each, effective Friday, to their highest
levels since the early 1980s.
   The central banks of France, Switzerland, Austria and the
Netherlands followed suit shortly afterwards by announcing similar
rate increases.
   The dollar fell sharply in hectic early trading in New York. The
dollar plunged to 1.9465 West German marks, from 1.9620 at
Wednesday's close, and to 142.45 Japanese yen, down from 143.25 yen
in the previous session.
   The Bundesbank's hike in the discount rate _ to 5 percent _ puts
the key lending rate at its highest level since early 1983. The
discount rate is the cheapest form of bank refinancing.
   The Lombard rate, the rate at which the Bundesbank lends
short-term funds using securities as collateral, increased to 7
percent, its highest level since 1982.
   The Bundesbank said in a statement the move was prompted by
strong economic growth and the potential for rising inflation. The
rate increases would aid the bank in stemming money supply growth
and would help stabilize the West German mark.
   The decision took some market participants in Europe by surprise,
but many analysts pointed to comments made last week by Bundesbank
President Karl Otto Poehl as a harbinger that a rate hike was in the
offing. Poehl said West Germany's current economic boom could cause
a deterioration in German price stability.
   In Paris, the Bank of France boosted its benchmark lending rate
by a half a percentage point in the country's first credit
tightening since Jan. 19. The rise will put the money market
intervention rate at 8} percent.
   The move had been promised earlier in the day by Economics
Minister Pierre Beregovoy as part of France's European cooperation
strategy.
   Beregovoy stressed, however, that domestic concerns didn't call
for a rate hike. But private economists said the hike was an
opportune way for France to curb the rapid expansion of domestic
demand and address its trade deficit.
   Separately, the Swiss National Bank announced it would raise the
nation's discount rate a full percentage point to 5.5 percent
effective Friday. The increase marked Switzerland's second hike so
far this year.

   Stock prices showed a broad loss today amid
persistent interest-rate worries and uncertainty about the economy.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials fell 17.07 to 2,487.67 in
the first half hour of trading.
   Losers outnumbered gainers by more than 4 to 1 in nationwide
trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 187 up, 817
down and 438 unchanged.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 23.60 million shares as of 10
a.m. on Wall Street.
   West Germany today raised two key interest rates by half a
percentage point in an evident effort to curb strong economic growth
in that country.
   Analysts didn't expect that to have any immediate effect on the
Federal Reserve's credit policy in this country, where all signs
point to slowing growth in business activity.
   In fact, some brokers say, investors in the U.S. markets lately
seem to have begun worrying more in recent days about a possible
economic slump.
   On Wednesday the government reported that the index of leading
economic indicators dropped 1.2 percent in May.
   Losers among the blue chips included International Business
Machines, down 1[ at 112}; General Electric, down } at 52|; Eastman
Kodak, down } at 48\, and Philip Morris, down ~ at 142.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks
slumped 1.18 to 180.69. At the American Stock Exchange, the market
value index was down 1.33 at 364.68.
   On Wednesday the Dow Jones industrial average dropped 21.63 to
2,504.74.
   Declining issues outnumbered advances by about 2 to 1 on the

   America's foreign debt burden soared to $532.5
billion in 1988, pushing the United States further into hock as the
world's largest debtor country, the government reported today.
   The Commerce Department said the new debt total was $154.2
billion higher than the $378.3 billion in debt to foreigners that
the United States owed at the end of 1987.
   The debt figure means that foreigners own more in U.S. assets
than Americans own abroad.
   For 1988, the government reported that foreign holdings in the
United States increased 15.4 percent to $1.79 trillion. American
investments abroad also rose, but by a smaller 7.2 percent, climbing
to $1.25 trillion.
   The difference between those two figures in America's net debtor
position.
   The huge 41 percent jump in the debt total in just one year was
certain to rekindle the debate over what the run-up in foreign
holdings means for America's future.
   Many private economists believe the United States is losing
control of its economic destiny and the debt burden will ultimately
lower American living standards as more and more wealth is
transferred into the hands of foreigners to service the debt,
leaving less money for distribution in this country.
   However, the Bush administration, like the Reagan adminisration
before it, contends that foreign investment has been good for the
nation, bringing an infusion of capital needed to rejuvenate many
aging American industries.
   Foreign director investment, defined as ownership of at least 10
percent of a company, soared by 21 percent last year to a record
$328.8 billion, reflecting something of a foreign buying-spree for
American companies.
   The overall net debtor position of $532.5 billion showed how
rapidly the foreign debt is piling up. As recently as 1983, the
United States was the world's largest creditor nation with an
investment surplus of $89 billion.
   That surplus fell to $3.3 billion in 1984 and disappeared
altogether in 1985, the year the country became a net debtor for the
first time in 71 years.
   The country's investment surplus evaporated as the United States
ran up huge merchandise trade deficits during the 1980s,
transferring billions of dollars into the hands of foreigners to pay
for imported cars and television sets.
   These dollars, now in foreign hands, have been reinvested in the
United States in everything from stocks and bonds to factories and
real estate, raising alarms in Congress that something must be done
to curb the ``selling of America.''
   The transformation of the United States from the largest creditor
country to the world's biggest debtor is often seen by critics as
the one of the biggest failures of former President Reagan's
economic policies.
   A report by the congressional Office of Technology Assessment,
which reviewed the situation last year, concluded: ``As the United
States sinks deeper into debt, foreign investors and creditors will
be less inclined to commit ever-increasing amounts of capital to a
$4 trillion economy on a spending spree.''
   Many private economists have warned that the United States is
increasingly vulnerable to a sudden withdrawal of funds on the part
of investors. Foreign uneasiness with a plunging U.S. dollar and
rising interest rates have been cited as an underlying cause of the
October 1987 stock market collapse.
   However, officials of the Bush administration, using identical
language as the Reagan team, contend the rising foreign investment
is really a sign of strength showing that overseas investors believe
the United States is an excellent place to put their money.
   Commerce Undersecretary Michael Darby, discussing the issue with
reporters Wednesday, noted the United States was a net debtor from
the founding of the country until 1914. During that period,
foreigners provided the investment needed to develop America.
   Darby said that foreign investment by itself ``doesn't make you a
weak nation. It doesn't make you a strong nation.'' He said what was
important was that the investment be used to modernize American
industry so that the country is better able to compete in the global
economy.
   But Nigel Gault, an economist at DRI-McGraw Hill, an economic
consulting firm, said that through the 1980s, much of the foreign
money has gone to support America's huge federal budget deficits and
over-consumption by American consumers.
   ``It is plainly clear that the foreign funds have not been used
to boost our competitive position,'' he said.

<HEAD>Judge Refuses to Block Time Shareholders Meeting</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: NEW throughout with Paramount announcing financing commitments.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOYCE M. ROSENBERG</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Paramount Communications Inc. announced today
that seven banks have agreed to serve as co-agents in the syndicate
being formed to finance the company's $12.2 billion tender offer for
Time Inc.
   The syndicate of banks will provide 90 percent of the financing
for the $200-a-share unsolicited offer. Paramount has said the
syndicate would provide $14 billion of the $15.6 billion estimated
financing costs, while the remaining $1.6 billion is to raised
through the sale of debt securities.
   The lack of financing commitments for Paramount's bid is one of
the objections raised by Time to the unwanted offer. Today's
announcement does not mean Paramount has obtained the commitments,
but it is a step toward satisfying that condition.
   Time is trying to preserve a merger with Warner Communications
Inc. and fight the Paramount bid.
   Time stock _ which has fluctuated as traders tried to forecast
the outcome of the three-way struggle _ was up $1.62{ a share to
$158.87{ in early New York Stock Exchange trading, indicating Wall
Street feels somewhat more optimistic today about the Paramount bid.
   Warner stock was off 62{ cents to $60.12{ a share, while
Paramount slipped $$1.12{ to $61.75 a share.
   On Wednesday, Delaware Chancery Court Judge William T. Allen said
Time's shareholder meeting can proceed as scheduled Friday.
   Allen, ruling in a suit brought by several major Time
shareholders, declined to issue a restraining order postponing the
meeting scheduled in New York.
   The meeting originally was called for June 23 for shareholders to
vote on Time's planned stock-swap merger with Warner and on the
election of four Time board members.
   After Paramount announced its original $10.7 billion takeover bid
for Time June 6, the meeting was rescheduled and Time officials
withdrew the merger proposal from the agenda.
   Time and Warner have since restructured their merger agreement,
under which Time is making a $14 billion tender offer for Warner.
   Several major Time shareholders, including Texas investor Robert
Bass, have complained that information Time has given them about
Friday's meeting was incomplete and inadequately reflected
takeover-related events that had occurred since proxy materials were
sent to shareholders. Those events include Paramount's tender offer
and Time's rejection of it.
   Four incumbent members of the Time board _ including Chairman and
Chief Executive Richard Munro and President Nicholas J. Nicholas Jr.
_ are running unopposed for re-election at Friday's meeting.
   Allen said there might be some merit to arguments raised by
shareholders but that he would rather spend his time preparing for
the July 11 hearing in a suit brought by Paramount against Time than
to take two days to determine the legal merits of the shareholder
complaint.
   Allen said no irreparable harm would result from allowing the
meeting and the likely re-election of the board members to proceed,
as the four would continue serving on the board anyway until a new
meeting was called.
   Before the meeting could be restrained or prohibited, the
shareholders had to prove irreparable harm would result from
allowing that action to occur.
   Observers believe the July 11 hearing could be pivotal in the
battle for Time. The hearing is expected to deal with Paramount's
contention that Time effectively put itself up for takeover bids by
announcing in March it would merge with Warner.
   Under state law in Delaware _ where all three companies are
incorporated _ if a company has put itself up for sale its board is
required to seek the maximum value for shareholders.
   If Allen rules Time put itself up for sale, the company's board
could be hard-pressed to reject Paramount's $200-a-share cash bid,
which is $74 higher than the price at which Time stock traded before
Paramount announced its bid.
   Time has rejected Paramount's offer, calling it financially
inadequate and subject to too many conditions.
   Time has said shareholders won't be asked to vote on any issues
related to the Time-Warner merger at Friday's meeting, but it is
likely some angry stockholders _ who believe Time should accept the
Paramount bid _ will vehemently express their displeasure with the
board.
   ``It's going to be a circus,'' Jerome E. Hass, a professor at
Cornell University's Johnson Graduate School of Management, said
Wednesday of the meeting. ``People are going to fight for the
microphone and chastise management.''

<HEAD>Rostenkowski Gives Up on Cutting Capital Gains Tax</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The chairman of the House Ways and Means
Committee has given up the idea of cutting the capital gains tax
because of Democratic opposition, according to a published report
today.
   Rep. Dan Rosetenkowski, D.-Ill., said he plans to fill a $5.3
billion tax-increase bill with revenue-raising provisions instead of
coupling a temporary reduction in the capital gains tax with
expansions of tax breaks for low-income people.
   Rostenkowksi said in an interview with the Wall Street Journal
that he encountered stronger resistance than expected from Democrats
on his committee to reducing the tax on gains from the sale of
securities and other assets.
   ``I never anticipated there would be as much resistance to
capital gains as there was,'' he told the newspaper.
   Democrats had argued the tax break would be too large a benefit
for wealthy people and also probably would cost the government
revenue in the long run.
   Rostenkowski's plan, which he termed a ``trial balloon,'' would
have paired the cut with a reduction for low-income people in areas
such as earned income tax credit and child care credit.
   He said President Bush had supported the idea of cutting the
capital gains tax and that his balanced plan came after the
president had suggested ``Why don't you try to put together a
package?''
   The chairman's plan would have reduced the capital gains rate for
a year from the current top rate of as much as 33 percent, and to
help lower-income individuals with expended tax credits.
   He said the plan would have raised about $15 billion over two
years because of churning of assets during the short-term change.
   Rosetnkowski said he now will focus on ways of raising the $5.3
billion tax increase called for in the congressional budget
resolution for fiscal 1990, which begins Oct. 1.
   He said because of that need, some tax breaks due to expire this
year will have to wait a year to be extended. He said he was
considering a variety of provisions that Bush would be most likely
to accept given his pledge not to increase taxes.

<TEXT>
   Grain and soybean futures prices were mostly lower
in early trading today on the Chicago Board of Trade, reflecting
wetter weather forecasts for the Midwest and a weakening of bullish
attitudes in the wheat market.
   The early selling of corn and soybean futures was partially a
reaction to Wednesday's six-to-10-day National Weather Service
outlook for near-normal rainfall in the Midwest.
   The soybean market also was pressured by prospects for a
temporary resumption of soybean sales to processors in Brazil after
a 2{-week boycott. Brazilian producers are considering the
government's request for a 10-day cooling-off period in the
soybean-growers' protest against the government's agricultural and
economic policies.
   The wheat market slipped on ideas that the gains of the three
previous sessions were overdone and on fears that the relatively
high prices could stifle export business.
   In early trading, wheat was 1 cent to 4} cents lower with the
contract for delivery in July at $4.07{ a bushel; corn was 1{ cents
lower to 1 cent higher with July at $2.63\ a bushel; oats were 2
cents lower to { cent higher with July at $1.48{ a bushel; soybeans
were 1 cent to 8} cents lower with July at $7.19 a bushel.
   Cattle futures were mostly higher while pork futures were mixed
in early trading on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.
   Live cattle were .03 cent to .40 cent higher with August at 70.82

<HEAD>Hooker Likely to Liquidate U.S. Retail, Property Holdings, Newspaper
Says</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Hooker Corp., the financially troubled Australian
real estate developer and retail concern, may liquidate all of its
U.S. department stores and shopping malls, according to a report
published Thursday.
   The Wall Street Journal quoted J. Frank Haasbeek, president of
Hooker's U.S. subisiary, as saying: ``It looks like Hooker will sell
everything over the next 12 to 24 months.''
   An assistant to Haasbeek at his office at L.J. Hooker Corp. in
Atlanta said Haasbeek was traveling Thursday and unavailable to
comment.
   Hooker might maintain a presence in the United States if it finds
investors willing to become joint-venture partners in proposed
shopping malls in Florida and North Carolina, the Journal said.
   Earlier this month, Hooker said it was looking for partners to
take stakes in its B. Altman and Bonwit Teller department store
chains and in malls in Cincinnati, Denver and Columbia, S.C.
   The Journal said Haasbeek indicated Hooker thinks chances of
finding partners for those operations are bleak.
   Haasbeek said Hooker is looking for an investment banking firm to
handle the B. Altman and Bonwit Teller divisions. He hopes to have a
tentative agreement to sell both chains by the early autumn.
   Hooker acquired Bonwit Teller, which has stores in the East,
Midwest and Florida, for about $92 million in August 1987. It bought
B. Altman, with stores in the Northeast, for about $100 million the
following month of that year.
   The investment firm First Boston Corp. already has been hired to
handle the sale of Hooker's malls in Cincinnati, Denver and Columbia
as well as the Merksamer Jewelery chain.
   Hooker also has put up for sale its interests in Sakowitz, a
Houston-based retailer, and in Parisian Inc., major department store
chain in the Southeast.
   Among its other U.S. holdings that Hooker is selling are a U.S.
residential construction business, nine strip shopping centers in
Florida and Ohio and six vacant tracts of land. Hooker already has
reached an agreement to sell its U.S. industrial operations to
divisions of Japan's Kajima Corp.
   Hooker has said it is suffering from a cash squeeze largely due
to high Australian interest rates and other unfavorable economic
conditions that have hurt its property develpment business in that
country.
   Last week, Hooker reached an agreement with its creditor banks on
a four-month moratorium on repaying principal on outstanding loans.
The banks, to which Hooker owes about $700 million, also agreed to
maintain credit lines at current levels.

<TEXT>
   Tyson Foods Inc., which last week won a
protracted fight for rival Holly Farms Corp., says it plans to sell
two Holly Farms divisions by mid-August to help pay off some of the
costs of the acquisition.
   Tyson Chairman Don Tyson said Wednesday company managers decided
to sell Holly Farms' rendering and flour and bakery supply divisions
and hoped to have the businesses sold by Aug. 15.
   In a proxy statement prepared for a special stockholders meeting
in April, Holly Farms projected the flour division would have sales
of $298 million, with income of $21 million this year, while the
rendering division would have $172 million in sales and income of
$18 million for the year.
   Tyson said he had not yet decided which, if any, of the Holly
Farms director-officers he'll keep on his management team.
   ``We'll make that decision on the 18th when I pay for the Holly
shares,'' Tyson said, referring to the July 18 deadline for Holly
Farms shareholders to tender their stock to Tyson.
   Tyson Foods, which began its efforts to take over Holly Farms in
October, clinched the deal last week with a cash offer of $1.4
billion or $70 a share. Holly Farms had tried to thwart Tyson's
efforts by agreeing to merge with ConAgra Inc. of Omaha, Neb.
   Holly Farms and ConAgra terminated their merger agreement, which
had been rejected by Holly Farms stockholders.

   Sears, Roebuck and Co. says it will lease space in
three of its stores to Kuppenheimer Mens' Clothiers.
   The announcement Wednesday came just a month after Sears said it
planned to discontinue sales of suits and sportscoats and emphasize
more casual clothing in its men's clothing departments.
   The deal with Kuppenheimer is the first time Sears has contracted
with a big apparel retailer.
   The nation's largest retailer's new strategy is similar to the
recent move by Montgomery Ward &amp; Co. to rent space in its stores to
specialty outlets including Toys `R' Us and Rose Records.
   Sears Chairman Edward Brennan is the brother of Ward's Chairman
Bernard Brennan.
   Sears officials said Kuppenheimer will set up shop at the Sears
store in Northridge Shopping Center in Milwaukee and at two other
undisclosed stores on the East Coast and in the Midwest.
   The clothier is scheduled to open in August at the Milwaukee
store, where it will occupy 2,000 square feet.
   Kuppenheimer is a 115-store subsidiary of Chicago-based Hartmarx.
It primarily sells private-label suits, sportscoats, dress shirts,
slacks and neckwear.
   In a separate announcement Wednesday, Sears said it plans to test
the sale of office equipment, including a line of IBM personal
computers and Bell Atlantic cellular phones.
   Meanwhile, Sears' Merchandise Group announced Thursday it had
completed plans for its new field-operations management structure,
which it will implement by mid-August.
   The reorganization will eliminate 825 management jobs. Sears said
425 management-level employees already have accepted an incentive
package to leave the company since the reorganization was announced
in March 1988.

<TEXT>
   Banc One Corp., an Ohio banking company known for
its consumer innovations, overcame six other bids to win the 20
failed banks of Dallas-based MCorp in what is estimated to become
the nation's third-largest bank bailout, regulators said today.
   L. William Seidman, chairman of the Federal Deposit Insurance
Corp., told reporters in Washington, D.C., the best estimate of
government assistance required for MCorp is $2 billion, with the
risk that the cost could ultimately be 10 percent to 15 percent
higher.
   He said the MCorp rescue likely will prove to be the second
biggest in the history of the FDIC, which insures commercial bank
deposits.
   The initial government payouts were larger for both the 1988
rescue of First RepublicBank of Dallas and the 1984 deal involving
Continental Illinois of Chicago. However, Seidman said the ultimate
cost of First RepublicBank will likely be $3 billion _ more
expensive than MCorp _ while the eventual pricetag of the
Continental Illinois rescue will be a less-costly $1.5 billion.
   The FDIC, which insures the nation's bank deposits, announced
Banc One's selection Wednesday, but withheld details of the
government assistance package until today.
   Analysts praised the decision, saying it would add a strong
competitor to Texas' troubled banking industry. Bidders who lost out
said they are prepared to compete.
   Seidman said in a statement Wednesday that Banc One was selected
in ``a highly competitive process'' from among ``attractive
proposals.''
   Banc One said it would begin managing the banks July 5 under the
name Bank One Texas, and would purchase the banks after a four- to
six-month period during which problem assets would be identified.
   The holding company said it would invest about $500 million to
buy all of Bank One Texas' equity.
   Bill Boardman, a Banc One senior vice president, said the FDIC
would take over problem loans and ``bring the balance sheet to a
zero position.''
   ``We won't know how many dollars are involved until the closing
of the transaction,'' Boardman said. Banc One has its own estimate
of the cost, but Boardman declined to say what the estimate was.
   Analysts predicted it could take as much as $2 billion to bail
out the banks, ranking only behind 1984's $4.5 billion rescue of
Continental Illinois of Chicago and last year's $4 billion deal
involving First RepublicBank of Dallas.
   Seidman has said that MCorp is the agency's last remaining major
commercial bank problem.
   However, the FDIC also is reviewing bids for National Bancorp. of
Texas of San Antonio and Texas American Bancshares Inc. of Fort
Worth, with combined assets of $7 billion. They are likely to be
sold in a package requiring about $500 million in government
assistance.
   Banc One, the country's 25th largest banking company with $25.3
billion in assets, was one of the first institutions to offer
automated tellers and has been a leader in packaging credit card
debt into securities for sale to investors.
   The Columbus company allocates more of its earnings to research
and development than most banks, but has remained one of the five
most profitable banks every year since 1984.
   On March 29, the 20 failed MCorp banks, which stretch across much
of Texas including Houston and Dallas, were packaged into a
government-owned institution called Deposit Insurance Bridge Bank,
or DIBB.
   The seizure left MCorp with five subsidiary banks, plus trust and
investment operations, that continue to operate, although the parent
company has filed for protection from creditors under the federal
bankruptcy code.
   MCorp also has challenged the takeover of eight of the subsidiary
banks, saying they were solvent at the time they were seized.
   Among the other prominent bidders for Bridge Bank were NCNB Corp.
of Charlotte, N.C., which bought First RepublicBank last year;
Houston-based Texas Commerce Bancshares Inc., a subsidiary of
Chemical Banking Corp., the nation's sixth largest banking company;
First City Bancorp. of Houston, itself the recipient of $1 billion
federal bailout in 1987; the New York-based leveraged buyout firm
Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co.; and the Bank of Scotland.
   Buddy Kemp, chairman of NCNB Texas, the new name of First
RepublicBank, said his company was disappointed with the FDIC's
decision, but added, ``We remain committed to serving the Texas
market by expanding our franchise throughout the state.''
   Kohlberg Kravis, which has no banking interests, said in a
statement, ``We are extremely disappointed. We've spent an enormous
amount of time, resources and effort on this matter.'' It noted that
its proposal would have maintained an independent bank in Texas.
   Analysts have blamed MCorp's failure on the collapse of the
energy market, even though the bank had focused more on real estate
loans than energy loans. The collapse of oil prices earlier in the
1980s snowballed into a real estate bust and a regional recession in
the Southwest.

   Former Defense Secretary Frank C. Carlucci told

   Carlucci told the House Public Works and Transportation aviation
subcommittee he supports the plan of Chicago businessman Joseph
Ritchie, already spurned by Eastern Chairman Frank Lorenzo, to buy
the airline in partnership with Eastern's striking employees.
   ``This approach is the only one that has a chance of restoring
Eastern to its once-proud status,'' said Carlucci, who headed the
Pentagon in the latter part of the Reagan administration.
   Ritchie, president of Chicago Research &amp; Trading group, submitted
to the subcommittee a plan he said can still restore Eastern as ``a
major competitor in the airline industry.''
   Lorenzo rejected Ritchie's earlier union-backed attempt to buy
the airline, along with several other offers. Carlucci said he had
agreed to serve as interim chief executive officer of the airline
because Ritchie's plan appeared to have the support of both
employees and creditors.
   Eastern's management has said it plans to rebuild the airline as
a smaller carrier. Eastern, which had been the nation's
sixth-largest airline, has operated only limited flights since a
Machinists strike in March led to a sympathy walkout by pilots and
flight attendants.
   Other witnesses scheduled at the hearing included officials of
Eastern, its striking unions, the bankruptcy court, the Department
of Transportation and the Federal Aviation Administration.
   The committee, in a letter seeking testimony, said it ``believes
that restoration of Eastern as a major carrier is critical, to avoid
a substantial loss of jobs, economic damage to the communities in
which Eastern's employees are based, and an adverse impact on
consumers.''
   Subcommittee chairman James L. Oberstar, D-Minn., said the panel
is concerned that the course chosen by a New York bankruptcy court
to allow Eastern to sell off assets ``will lead to the liquidation
of Eastern.'' The airline filed for protection from creditors under
bankruptcy laws after the strike began.
   Oberstar said the panel seeks to determine how the loss of
Eastern as a major carrier will affect service and fares in the
markets it serves.
   He said the committee will examine both Ritchie's and Eastern's
plans, the bankruptcy court's ability to consider the public
interest, and any steps the Transportation Department has taken to
consider the effects of the airline's reorganization on air travel,
Eastern's employees and its creditors.
   Rep. Newt Gingrich of Georgia, subcommittee member and House GOP
whip, has asked Transportation Secretary Samuel Skinner to intervene
in the bankruptcy court's proceedings.
   ``Our concern is urgent,'' Gingrich said in a letter to Skinner
last week, ``because it appears likely Eastern Airlines will be sold
off in pieces, resulting in less than a fully integrated competitive
carrier.''
   Gingrich accused Lorenzo, head of Texas Air Corp. which owns
Eastern, of having an interest in not building up Eastern as a
competitor to his other airline, Continental.
   Gingrich said that because no assistant attorney general for
antitrust has yet been confirmed, ``the bankruptcy and possible sale
of Eastern Airlines is taking place without proper guidance from the
Bush administration.''

   Persistent interest-rate worries and uncertainty
about the economy combined to drive stock prices sharply lower today.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials fell 40.97 points to
2,463.77 by 2 p.m. on Wall Street.
   Losers outnumbered gainers by more than 5 to 1 in nationwide
trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 248 up, 1,290
down and 378 unchanged.
   West Germany today raised two key interest rates by half a
percentage point in an evident effort to curb strong economic growth
in that country. Several other European nations also raised their
rates.
   Analysts didn't expect that to have any immediate effect on the
Federal Reserve's credit policy in this country, where all signs
point to slowing growth in business activity.
   In fact, some brokers say, investors in the U.S. markets lately
seem to have begun worrying more in recent days about a possible
economic slump.
   On Wednesday the government reported that the index of leading
economic indicators dropped 1.2 percent in May.
   Losers among the blue chips included International Business
Machines, down 2[ at 111}; General Electric, down } at 52|; Union
Carbide, down | at 26, and American Telephone &amp; Telegraph, down | at
35{.
   Banc One led the active list, up 5{ at 33{. The company, which
had been considered a long shot, won the bidding to acquire the
failed banks formerly operated by MCorp.
   Technology stocks traded in the over-the-counter market came
under pressure for the second straight session. Intel dropped 1] to
29[; Apple Computer 1\ to 40{; Sun Microsystems ] to 16|, and
Ashton-Tate } to 17}.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks
slumped 2.62 to 179.25. At the American Stock Exchange, the market
value index was down 4.59 at 361.42.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 121.14 million shares with two

   Airbus Industrie announced Thursday that
Gulf Air will buy 24 aircraft for use on its Middle Eastern routes
in a deal worth at least $960 million.
   The deal includes 12 each of Airbus' A320 and A321 planes with
options to purchase six additional A320s.
   The A320 is a single-aisle, twin-engine aircraft seating 150
passengers in a two-class layout. The A321 is a stretched version of
the A320, seating 186 passengers.
   Gulf Air, which is owned jointly by the Arab states of Bahrain,
Oman, Qatar and the United Arab Emirates, will begin taking delivery
of the A320s in the spring of 1992, and A321s in the second half of
1994.
   Airbus and Gulf Air, which is based in Bahrain, did not release a
total package price of the deal, but Airbus said the A320's basic
price is $38 million, while the A321 sells for $42 million, making
the minimum price for the 24 aircraft $960 million, exclusive of
spare parts and training.
   The new planes will replace Boeing 737-200 aircraft.
   Airbus has received firm orders for 505 A320s from 25 customers,
and commitments for 30 A321s from three customers.

<HEAD>London Shares Close Sharply Down As Rate Fears Return</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Renewed nervousness about the British interest-rate
outlook, following a rate increase in West Germany, pushed share
prices on London's stock exchange sharply down Thursday.
   Still, the British pound's relative resilience helped to reassure
the stock market that British rates could perhaps hold at current
levels.
   ``Nobody's panicking yet,'' commented one dealer.
   At the close the FT-SE 100-share index was down 27.4 points, or
1.24 percent, at 2182.0. Volume slowed to 426.8 million shares from
Wednesday's 456.6 million shares.
   Dealers and analysts noted the London market had been vulnerable
to bad news following its recent strong runup on relatively little
volume.
   Dealers and analysts say nervousness is likely to persist as
participants wait to see how the pound weathers British inflation
data and further reports on Britain's trade deficit in coming weeks.
   ``The (equity) market won't get carried away until the trend in
the balance of payments is confirmed to be improving and until there
is an improvement in the inflation profile,'' Reynolds said. This is
likely to keep the British market on hold at least until late
summer, the Prudential-Bache economist predicted.

<HEAD>Japanese Company Rejects Pickens' Bid for Board Seat</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SUSAN MOFFAT</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   T. Boone Pickens was joined by a group of Japanese
racketeers in seeking greater shareholders' rights in Koito
Manufacturing Co., but the corporate raider lost his bid for three
board seats Thursday even though he is the company's largest
shareholder.
   It was ``the most unusual shareholders' meeting I've ever
attended in my life,'' said Pickens, who in March bought a 20.2
percent stake in the automobile lighting manufacturer.
   Among the 200 shareholders present, Pickens' was the only hand
raised in favor of electing himself and two associates to Koito's
20-member board.
   During a 20-minute address, Pickens said that Japan should open
up more and give foreign investors a chance to participate in its
economy.
   Pickens said his inability to gain representation on the Koito
board showed that the Japanese investment market is not as open to
Americans as the U.S. market is to Japanese.
   ``You invest freely in my country ... yet I invest in Japan and I
am excluded,'' he told shareholders at the three-hour meeting.
   But Koito officials said their reluctance to support Pickens was
based on his history of corporate raiding in the United States, not
his being an American. They said they doubted he had a long-term
interest in the company and pointed to his lack of experience in
manufacturing.
   Pickens said after the meeting he would testify before the U.S.
Senate Finance Committee on July 11 about his difficulties in
breaking into the Japanese investment market.
   The shareholders present included Koito employees loyal to the
company and racketeers known as sokaiya who generally took Pickens'
side in their questioning and heckled Koito executives. In the end,
however, they voted against Pickens.
   The sokaiya, often speaking in the rough cadences of yakuza, or
gangsters, scolded Koito management for not thinking of Japan's
international responsibilitiesand drew frequent laughter from the
large contingent of Japanese reporters watching on a television
monitor in a nearby room.
   Sokaiya are a regular part of shareholders' meetings of major
companies in Japan. Companies pay them to be quiet or sometimes to
silence other shareholders.
   Although paying sokaiya is illegal, industry sources say it is
common to avoid filibusters by the racketeers, who cannot be
excluded because they are legal shareholders. Koito executives deny
any ties with sokaiya.
   Pickens said ``the sokaiya asked good questions'' and criticized
Koito management for not answering them fully.
   But he called the meeting ``something of a sham,'' complaining
that it was filled with Koito employees who supported management
statements ``almost as if they'd practiced.''
   After the meeting, Koito President Takao Matsuura said it was
difficult to tell whether Pickens' intentions were those of a
corporate raider.
   ``Mr. Pickens asked only very appropriate questions,'' Matsuura
said.
   Koito was just one of more than 1,500 companies holding annual
meetings Thursday, and more than 5,000 police were dispatched to
prevent disturbances. Japanese firms are increasingly holding their
meetings on the same day to discourage sokaiya, but the result is
that individual shareholders can attend only one or two meetings,
reducing their voice.

   Grain and soybean futures prices closed mostly
lower Thursday on the Chicago Board of Trade, with wheat leading the
way on ideas that the strong gains of the three previous sessions
had been exaggerated.
   Despite a rain-related slowdown in the winter wheat harvest,
especially in the South and Southeast, analysts said the movement of
new wheat to market was bound to force prices lower.
   Further selling of wheat futures was prompted by fears that the
relatively high prices reached this week could stifle export demand.
   Corn and soybean futures slipped following Wednesday's
six-to-10-day National Weather Service outlook for near-normal
rainfall in the Midwest.
   The soybean market also was pressured by prospects for a
temporary resumption of soybean sales to processors in Brazil after
a 2{-week boycott. Brazilian producers are considering their
government's request for a 10-day cooling-off period in their
protest against the country's agricultural and economic policies.
   At the close, wheat was 2{ cents to 7\ cents lower with the
contract for delivery in July at $4.05 a bushel; corn was { cent

<TEXT>
   Net profits at Telefonica de Espana, the
state-controlled telephone monopoly, rose 18 percent in 1988 over
the previous year as the fast-growing Spanish economy continued to
spur strong demand, company president Candido Velazquez said
Thursday.
   Velazquez said net profits in 1988 totaled 62.84 billion pesetas,
or $507 million, up from 53.24 billion pesetas in 1987.
   Revenue in 1988 increased to 612.53 billion pesetas, or $4.93
billion, from 568.70 billion pesetas the previous year.
   Velazquez said the company expected to catch up with exploding
demand for telephone services by mid-1992, in time for the Barcelona
'92 Summer Olympics and the Expo '92 World's Fair to commemorate
explorer Christopher Colombus' voyage to the New World.
   Consumer and media criticism of Telefonica has been great for the
last year due to months of waiting required for installation of new
lines.
   Former Telefonica president Luis Solana left his post last
December to take over as director general of state-run Spanish
Television after being blasted by the media and consumers for
failing to foresee the explosion in demand.

<HEAD>Chrysler's New Laser Expressive</HEAD>
<HEAD>With LaserPhoto and LaserGraphic</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ANN M. JOB</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>For The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Chrysler Corp. and Mitsubishi Motors Corp. of Japan worked
together to design and produce the 1990 Plymouth Laser RS Turbo and
its twin, the Mitsubishi Eclipse GS. The result is a fine example of
joint workmanship that young, single car buyers can enjoy.
   The Laser test car was expressive, from its sporty design to its
leave-others-in-the-dust turbo engine.
   It was, as Car and Driver magazine said in naming it one of the
10 best cars this year, a modestly priced sports coupe with enough
performance to embarrass a Porsche 944.
   Slip down into the Laser RS driver's seat and examine the
cockpit-like dashboard arrayed in front. Notice how the right side
of the dash curves out and around, toward the driver. Knobs, buttons
and dials are all around. Shift a bit in the seat to rest your right
arm on the thick center console that houses the smooth-shifting
five-speed gearbox. Don't worry about the cigarette lighter that's
also on the console next to you. The lighter has a collar around it
so it won't depress casually.
   Now, push in the clutch and start up the car. Don't let the
relative quiet from under the hood fool you. This is a car with a
2-liter, turbocharged, 16-valve engine that's deceptively quick and
really fun. Thank heavens the companies installed passive shoulder
belts in the car for front-seat passengers who might be caught
unaware. The sporty front seats, too, help hold a body in place.
   In he first five months of sales since its January debut,
Chrysler sold about 6,000 Lasers. But company spokeswoman Rebecca
Caruso noted there are enough back orders to keep the assembly plant
in Normal, Ill., going at its current pace until November 1990,
though production at that Chrysler-Mitsubishi plant known as
Diamond-Star Motors will crank up with time and should shorten that
waiting list.
   The new Laser, which isn't related to an earlier Plymouth Laser
that was in dealer showrooms until 1986, is designed for young
adults with median age of 29 and college education, Caruso said.
Sixty-five percent will be single. More than half of the Laser
buyers are expected to be females.
   But the RS Turbo version is likely to attract more men than
women, Caruso said, adding that the Laser comes in two trim levels
and with three engine offerings, a smaller, 1.8-liter, non-turbo
engine, a 2-liter engine with no turbo and the top-of-the-ine
2-liter turbo that was in the test car.
   Base price of the Laser RS turbo was $13,394, making it quite
competitive in the small, sporty coupe market that includes the Ford
Probe GT, Mazda MX6 and Toyota Celica GT-S. The Probe GT, for
example, starts around $14,000, and the Celica GT-S starts around
$15,400.
   Caruso added that the Laser RS Turbo also is faster than the
competitors.
   From the outside, the Laser RS Turbo test car looked a lot like
the Probe _sloping and aerodynamic. Underneath is a modified
platform borrowed from another Mitsubishi car, the Gallant.
   Handling on the Laser was fine, and the suspension was not as
stiff as in other sporty cars. I would stress that buyers consider
whether they will use the Laser to carry more than one other
passenger with any regularity, because the Laser RS Turbo back seat
was made for a contortionist.
   Once I got in the back _ with a couple of bruises along the way _
my head was up against the ceiling, and I'm just 5-feet-4. The seat
does fold down, however, for more room in the hatchback area for
carrying non-human items.
   There were just a couple other drawbacks. The AM-FM
stereo-cassette player buttons were small and, therefore, had to be
hit with precision. And there was considerable torque steer with the
accelerator pushed down quickly _ especially when the car hit bumps
and uneven pavement.
   But those still didn't take the edge off all the fun. Because the
Laser RS Turbo is new for this year, Consumer Reports magazine does
not have owner reports of trouble.

funds fell $445.8 million in the latest week, the Investment Company
Institute said Thursday.
   It was only the third weekly decline in the funds' assets since
anuary.
   The decline, to $320.82 billion in the seven-day period ended
Wednesday, followed eight straight weekly increases, all of them
topping the previous record at the time, according to the
Washington-based mutual fund trade group.
   The funds' assets hit their last record high of $321.26 billion
in the week ended June 21, 1989.
   The Investment Company Institute said that in the latest week,
assets of 231 general purpose funds rose $137.9 million to $103.07
billion, assets of 95 broker-dealer funds increased $385 million to
$136.02 billion, and assets of 143 institutional funds declined
$968.7 million to $81.74 billion.
   The seven-day average yield on money market mutual funds in the
week ended Tuesday was 8.89 percent, unchanged from the previous
week, according to Donoghue's Money Fund Report, a trade journal
based in Holliston, Mass.
   The 30-day average yield fell to 8.96 percent from 9.01 percent
the previous week, Donoghue's said.
   The average maturity of the portfolios held by money funds
remained unchanged at 39 days, Donoghue's said.
   Separately, the newsletter Bank Rate Monitor said its survey of
100 leading commercial banks, savings and loan assocations and
savings banks in the nation's 10 largest markets showed the
effective annual yield available on money market accounts was to
6.56 percent as of Wednesday, unchanged from a week earlier.
   The North Palm Beach, Fla.-based newsletter said the effective
annual yield available on special savings accounts, called Super NOW
accounts, also was unchanged, at 5.14 percent.
   Bank Rate Monitor said the effective annual yield was 8.84
percent on six-month certificates of deposit, down from 8.88 the
previous week. Yields were 8.89 percent on 1-year CDs, down from
8.94 percent; 8.73 percent on 2{-year CDs, down from 8.77 percent;
and 8.67 percent on 5-year CDs, down from 8.70 percent.

   Stock prices took their steepest drop in more
than three months Friday, yielding to increasing uneasiness over the
slowing economy.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials tumbled 46.47 points to
2,458.27, for its biggest loss since it tumbled 48.57 points on
March 17.
   Since the end of last week, when the average reached a new
post-crash high, it has fallen 73.60 points.
   Declining issues outnumbered advances by about 5 to 1 in
nationwide trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed stocks, with
273 up, 1,325 down and 395 unchanged.
   Volume on the floor of the Big Board came to 167.10 million
shares, up from 158.47 million in the previous session. Nationwide,
consolidated volume in NYSE-listed issues, including trades in those
stocks on regional exchanges and in the over-the-counter market,
totaled 199.22 million shares.
   West Germany raised two key interest rates by half a percentage
point in an evident effort to curb strong economic growth in that
country. Several other European nations also raised their rates.
   Analysts didn't expect that to have any immediate effect on the
Federal Reserve's credit policy in this country, where all signs
point to slowing growth in business activity.
   In fact, some brokers say, investors in the U.S. markets lately
seem to have begun worrying more in recent days about a possible
economic slump.
   On Wednesday the government reported that the index of leading
economic indicators dropped 1.2 percent in May.
   What was particularly striking about Thursday's drop in stock
prices, some observers said, was that it occurred against a backdrop
of declining interest rates in the domestic credit markets.
   Losers among the blue chips included International Business
Machines, down 2] at 111{; General Electric, down 1 at 52]; USX,
down ~ at 34}; Eastman Kodak, down 1] at 47|, and American Telephone
&amp; Telegraph, down | at 35{.
   Banc One led the active list, up 4~ at 32~. The company, which
had been considered a long shot, won the bidding to acquire the
failed banks formerly operated by MCorp.
   Amdahl, the most active American Stock Exchange issue, fell 3{ to
16|. The company said its second-quarter earnings would be down
significantly despite an expected increase in revenues.
   Numerous other technology issues followed Amdahl shares lower.
   By contrast, L.A. Gear, one of the best percentage gainers of
1989 among NYSE issues from a starting point in the low 20s, rose 2{
to 60. The footwear company posted sharply higher quarterly profits
and said its order backlog continued to increase.
   As measured by Wilshire Associates' index of more than 5,000
actively traded stocks, the market lost $53.58 billion, or 1.67
percent, in value.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks
dropped 3.12 to 178.75.
   Standard &amp; Poor's industrial index fell 7.22 to 365.70, and S&amp;P's
500-stock composite index was down 6.13 at 319.68.
   The NASDAQ composite index for the over-the-counter market
dropped 6.99 to 437.91. At the Amex, the market value index closed
at 360.61, down 5.40.

   Federal bank regulators estimated Thursday they
will spend $2 billion to rescue the 20 failed banks of the
Dallas-based MCorp in the second-costliest bank rescue in history.
   L. William Seidman, chairman of the Federal Deposit Insurance
Corp., which backs commercial bank deposits, said he foresees no
failures rivaling it in the immediate future.
   Regulators picked Banc One Corp. of Columbus, Ohio, the nation's
25th largest banking company, from among six firms bidding to take
over the insolvent banks with $13.1 billion in assets.
   Banc One Chairman John B. McCoy assumes the chairmanship of the
Texas institutions on July 5 and will operate them under the name of
Bank One Texas.
   The Ohio company, one of the most innovative retail banking
operations in the country, is contributing $500 million in a complex
arrangement that will permit it to exclude the Texas operation from
its consolidated balance sheet and maintain its record as one of the
nation's five most profitable banks.
   The MCorp banks have been under federal control since March 28
when regulators stripped them from the parent holding company,
leaving five banks and a trust operation still in private hands.
   Seidman said $2 billion was the agency's ``best estimate'' of the
bailout cost, but cautioned that could end up being $200 million to
$300 million too high or too low. Most of the subsidy comes from
covering losses on the failed banks' $3 billion to $3.5 billion in
sour commercial real estate loans.
   The FDIC will be part owner of Bank One Texas for at least five
years.
   ``This transaction ranks as the second most expensive in the
FDIC's history,'' Seidman said.
   The costliest was last year's bailout of First RepublicBank of
Dallas, which the agency estimates will wind up costing it $3
billion. Third, he said, is the bailout of Continental Illinois of
Chicago, which should ultimately require $1.5 billion in federal aid.
   ``At this time, for the year 1989, we do not foresee any
transactions near this size,'' Seidman said.
   Bank failures have risen for seven years, hitting 221 in 1988,
the fifth consecutive post-Depression record. For the first time
since it began operating in 1934, the FDIC saw its reserves decline,
dropping from $18.3 billion at the end of 1987 to $14 billion a year
later.
   Seidman said the agency booked its loss for the MCorp rescue last
year and he expects it to begin rebuilding its reserves this year.
He is predicting bank failures will decline slightly from 1988.
   However, Bert Ely, a financial institutions analyst in
Alexandria, Va., said, ``The slate of problems has not been wiped
clean. ... We've still got some weak sisters out there in the
banking world.''
   He said the sharp deterioration of the Arizona real estate market
would produce banking problems there. FDIC-insured savings banks in
the Northeast also are slipping because of real estate weakness and
bank involvement in financing corporate buyouts will make some big
institutions vulnerable, he said.
   Banc One, in winning the MCorp banks, fended off five rivals:
NCNB Corp. of Charlotte, N.C., which bought First RepublicBank last
year; Houston-based Texas Commerce Bancshares Inc., a subsidiary of
Chemical Banking Corp.; First City Bancorp. of Houston, itself the
recipient of $1 billion federal bailout in 1987; the New York-based
leveraged buyout firm Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co.; and the Bank of
Scotland.
   ``The selection of Banc One was the result of a highly
competitive bidding process in which the margin of difference among
the finalists was extremely narrow,'' Seidman said.

<HEAD>Recession Fears Clobber Precious Metal Futures</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID DISHNEAU</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Futures prices of silver, gold and platinum fell sharply Thursday
amid growing fears that the U.S. economy is sliding inexorably into
a recession.
   On other markets, coffee futures sank; energy futures climbed;
grains and soybeans were mostly lower; and livestock and meat
futures were mixed.
   On New York's Commodity Exchange, gold settled $5.30 to $6.20
lower with the contract for delivery in August at $373.90 a troy
ounce; silver was 16.5 cents to 19.8 cents lower with July at $5.12
a troy ounce.
   Platinum was $4.40 to $6.70 lower on the New York Mercantile
Exchange with July slipping below the psychologically important $500
level to settle at $496.90 a troy ounce.
   Analysts said fears of a recession have pervaded the financial
markets, encouraged by weakening economic indicators and relatively
high interest rates, which tend to slow the economy's growth.
   To explain Thursday's selloff in precious metals, they cited such
diverse factors as this week's stock market decline, a general
downturn in commodity prices, a stronger dollar and the tightening
of interest rates in Europe.
   ``It appears the Europeans are now going to take strong measures
in combating inflation,'' said Peter Cardillo, a commodity trading
adviser with Josephthal &amp; Co. in New York.
   Some experts had turned bullish on precious metals after last
week's strong rally in the gold market, but with little
follow-through buying by investors this week, those attitudes are
fading.
   ``The lack of bullion demand from just about every quarter makes
these rallies weak rallies and without any real backup,'' said
William O'Neill, director of research with Elders Futures Inc. in
New York.
   Coffee futures gave up nearly all of Wednesday's gains on New
York's Coffee, Sugar &amp; Cocoa Exchange, falling amid renewed
pessimism about the prospects for a new international price-support
agreement.
   Members of the International Coffee Organization are scheduled to
vote Monday on two proposals for a pact to succeed the current
6-year agreement, which expires on Sept. 30.
   But neither proposal is expected to pass, and some of the largest
coffee-producing nations are pushing for a suspension of export
quotas if neither proposal is accepted.
   The International Coffee Organization is composed of 74 major
coffee-producing and consuming nations. It attempts to stabilize
coffee prices by limiting sales of coffee by the producers to the
consumers.
   Coffee settled unchanged to 2.78 cents lower with July at $1.116
a pound.
   Oil futures prices rose on the New York Mercantile Exchange in a
moderate rebound from Wednesday's steep decline.
   West Texas Intermediate crude oil settled 2 cents lower to 23
cents higher with August at $20.26 a barrel; heating oil was .24
cent lower to .27 cent higher with July at 49.45 cents a gallon;
unleaded gasoline was .14 cent to .37 cent higher with July at 61.52
cents a gallon.
   Wheat futures retreated on the Chicago Board of Trade on ideas
that the strong gains of the three previous sessions had been
exaggerated.
   Corn was nearly unchanged but soybean futures were lower,
pressured by prospects for a temporary resumption of soybean sales
to processors in Brazil after a 2{-week boycott by producers to
protest their government's agricultural and economic policies.
   Wheat settled 2{ cents to 7\ cents lower with July at $4.05 a
bushel; corn was \ cent lower to { cent higher with July at $2.64{ a
bushel; oats were 3 cents to 4\ cents lower with July at $1.46\ a
bushel; soybeans were 1 cent to 6\ cents lower with July at $7.22{ a
bushel.
   Livestock and meat futures were mixed in cautious trading ahead
of Friday's quarterly hogs-and-pigs inventory report from the
Agriculture Department.
   Live cattle settled .25 cent lower to .35 cent higher with August
at 70.77 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .02 cent to .20 cent
higher with August at 81.22 cents a pound; live hogs were .60 cent
lower to .17 cent higher with July at 48.90 cents a pound; frozen
pork bellies were .20 cent to 1 cent lower with July at 34.70 cents
a pound.

   Colgate-Palmolive Co. and Marrow-Tech
Inc. announced Thursday they will collaborate on researching
possible alternatives to using animals in product tests.
   Under the agreement, Colgate's scientists will study the use of
Marrow-Tech's living skin replacement in a variety of skin
sensitivity and toxicity tests, according to Marrow-Tech spokeswoman
Susan A. Noonan.
   Marrow-Tech, based in Elmswood, N.Y., has been working on methods
of growing human tissues outside the body. The company has
successfully replicated bone marrow, skin and liver tissues, Ms.
Noonan said.
   Colgate is one of the country's major makers of consumer products
ranging from toothpaste to soaps.
   A number of companies in a variety of industries such as
cosmetics, pharmaceuticals and chemicals, are engaging in efforts to
find ways to assure their products are safe for consumer use without
having to test them on animals.
   Last week, Avon Products Inc. announced a permanent end to animal
testing, becoming the first major cosmetics maker to completely
replace animal tests with alternatives.

   Eastern Airlines union members on Thursday took
actions against former colleagues who have defied their nearly
4-month-old strike, picketing the homes of three pilots and the
business of another and announcing plans to fine working pilots.
   Tim Holder, an Air Line Pilots Association official in Atlanta,
said disciplinary proceedings will begin July 26 to seek fines
against some 220 pilots who have flown during the strike. Holder
said he expects penalties to be ``substantial,'' running to
thousands of dollars for each offender.
   The ALPA constitution calls for penalties against members who
disobey orders from the master executive council of the union, which
represents pilots at most major airlines. Disciplinary hearings for
Eastern pilots will be conducted by a three-member panel of pilots
from other airlines, Holder said.
   Meanwhile, Eastern union officials said they would continue
pickets at flying pilots' homes.
   ``This has sunk to a new low,'' said Tom Bueter, a 23-year
Eastern pilot who confronted seven pilots and a flight attendant
outside the home of his neighbor, pilot Roberto Freytes. ``These
people are losing, they perceive they're losing, and now they're
becoming more and more desperate.''
   Bueter and Freytes have continued to fly for Eastern during their
union's strike.
   ``We're going to do this every day at different homes,'' said
Edgar Belaval, a striking Eastern pilot picketing outside Freytes'
home in suburban southwest Dade County, Fla.
   ``Our striking pilots, flight attendants and (Machinists)
apparently lost all sense of decency today,'' Eastern spokesman
Robin Matell said in a message to employees. ``Whatever happened to
the notion that a man's home is his castle? Wouldn't you know the
chicken-hearted picketers selected homes where for the most part the
husbands were out flying and only the wife and kids were home.''
   Matell, a management veteran of strikes at several airlines, said
he had never heard of picketers going to private homes.
   Gary Greksa, a spokesman for ALPA, said the union obtained police
permits to picket three homes and the Keg South, a tavern owned by a
pilot and flight attendant who have crossed picket lines.
   ``There's been a lot of press lately and a very heavy advertising
campaign by the company ... it's led a lot of people to believe that
the strike is over,'' Greksa said. ``We do every little bit of
activity we can to keep it in the public eye.''
   Greksa said ALPA has begun running radio ads about the strike.
Other union sources have indicated the strikers plan a mass protest
July 4 at Miami International Airport and at other airports at which
Eastern flies.
   At least 3,400 of the 3,600 Eastern pilots joined the Machinists
union March 4 when that union went on strike. The flight attendants
union also is honoring picket lines.
   Eastern last week asked the bankruptcy court to terminate its
contract with the pilots union.

<TEXT>
   The dollar staged a puzzling turnaround Thursday
when it finished mostly higher in domestic trading despite
announcements that a string of European central banks will hike key
lending rates.
   Gold prices were mixed. Republic National Bank of New York quoted
a troy ounce of gold at $370.15 as of 4 p.m. EDT, down from $374.40
late Wednesday.
   The dollar began to tumble after West Germany's Bundesbank
announced it would hike its discount and Lombard rates by half a
percentage point each, effective Friday. The discount rate will rise
to 5 percent and the Lombard rate to 7 percent, their highest levels
since the early 1980s.
   Similar actions followed in France, Switzerland, Belgium, the
Netherlands, Denmark and Austria.
   Higher rates overseas typically depress the dollar by enhancing
the value of foreign investments. Rather than purchase dollars to
invest in U.S. securities, foreign investors will keep their funds
overseas when rates there are attractive.
   Following the central banks' announcements, the dollar fell a
steep 2.3 pfennigs to 1.9390 West German marks. But before trading
ended in Europe and midway through the domestic session, the dollar
began to turn around, a phenomenon that had many traders scratching
their heads.
   ``There's no reasonable justification for it,'' said Frank Conte,
vice president of foreign exchange at Barclays Bank PLC in New York.
``The dollar should be a lot lower.''
   Some said the recovery was due to a variety of technical factors,
including the fact that traders already had begun to square up their
positions ahead of the July 4th holiday weekend.
   But Robert Ryan, a vice president at Irving Trust Co., noted that
heavy Japanese dollar-buying in the face of political difficulties
in Tokyo worked to boost the U.S. currency.
   ``The yen kept weakening and it impacted the other currencies,
and the dollar came back,'' he said. ``Today's activity showed total
bearishness toward the yen.''
   While the European rate hikes may have caught some traders by
surprise, more dealers were jolted by the dollar's resilience.
   Still, Bank of Boston senior trader Scott Horwitz cautioned that
the dollar's strength should not necessarily be interpreted as ``a
trendsetting reaction.''
   ``The dollar turns on a dime,'' he said, adding that Thursday's
recovery was ``more a product of a four-day U.S. holiday.''
   In Tokyo, the dollar slipped to 142.90 Japanese yen from 143.55
on Wednesday. Later in London, the U.S. currency traded lower at
142.53. In New York, however, the dollar climbed to 144.00 yen, from
143.25 yen on Wednesday.
   In London, one British pound cost $1.5650 late Thursday, more
expensive for buyers than Wednesday's late $1.5613. Later in New
York, it cost $1.5435 to buy one pound, cheaper than $1.5580 on
Wednesday.
   Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late
Wednesday, inlcuded: 1.9640 West German marks, up from 1.9620;
1.6880 Swiss francs, down from 1.6885; 6.6690 French francs, up from
6.6605; 1,419.00 Italian lire, up from 1,416.00, and 1.1946 Canadian
dollars, down from 1.1965.
   Other late dollar rates in Europe, compared with late Wednesday,
included: 1.9430 West German marks, down from 1.9630; 1.6650 Swiss
francs, down from 1.6870; 6.5925 French francs, down from 6.6645;
2.1875 Dutch guilders, down from 2.2125; 1,407.00 Italian lire, down
from 1,421.50, and 1.1950 Canadian dollars, unchanged.
   On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold bullion for delivery
in the current month, August, slipped to $373.90 a troy ounce, from
Wednesday's late bid of $379.20.
   Gold bullion prices were unchanged in London at a bid price of
$375.25 a troy ounce late Thursday, but rose in Zurich to $376.00 an
ounce bid, from $373.75. Earlier in Hong Kong, gold closed at a bid
$376.45, up from $373.55.
   Silver prices fell. On New York's Comex, silver bullion for
current delivery settled at $5.120 a troy ounce, down from $5.282.
Silver bullion traded late in London at $5.28 bid a troy ounce, down
from $5.30.

<HEAD>Whitney Launches Tender Offer for Prime; MAI Still Mulling Counter
Offer</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ALAN COOPERMAN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   J.H. Whitney &amp; Co. launched a $1.25 billion tender
offer for Prime Computer Inc. on Thursday, but rival bidder MAI
Basic Four Inc. said it would try to exceed that price.
   ``MAI's position is, it is still evaluating the situation and is
hopeful that we will be able to beat the Whitney offer,'' said Toni
Lee, a spokeswoman for the Tustin, Calif., computer firm.
   Wall Street, however, treated MAI's statement with skepticism.
Prime's stock closed at $19.25, up 25 cents, while MAI shares
dropped 12{ cents to $5.75 in composite trading Thursday on the New
York Stock Exchange.
   Securities analysts said they doubted MAI would be able to obtain
financing for an offer high enough to wrest Prime away from J.H.
Whitney.
   ``I don't think we're going to see a bidding war,'' said Stephen
K. Smith, who follows the computer industry for the brokerage firm
of PaineWebber Inc. in New York.
   Prime is a Natick-based maker of minicomputers and computer-aided
design and manufacturing equipment. In the face of a hostile, $1.1
billion bid from MAI, its board of directors agreed June 23 to a
merger with J.H. Whitney, a private venture capital firm in New York
City.
   Whitney's offer is $21.50 a share in cash for Prime's 49.5
million outstanding shares of common stock, which represents about
79 percent of the company's stock on a fully diluted basis.
   For the remaining 21 percent of the shares, Whitney said it would
exchange securities with a face value of $22 per share. Securities
analysts have estimated the overall value of the offer at about $20
a share, or $1.25 billion.
   The Whitney offer expires July 27, the day after Prime's annual
meeting. MAI has said repeatedly that it would wage a proxy battle
to elect its nominees to the board of directors at the meeting.
   Prime, which has about 11,200 employees and annual revenues of
$1.6 billion, has seen its earnings plummet during the takeover
battle. It reported a loss of $5 million on sales of $387 million
during the first quarter of 1989.
   MAI, which had 1988 revenues of about $421 million, has offered
$19.50 a share in cash for about 75 percent of Prime's shares and a
mixture of preferred stock and bonds for the remainder. Analysts
have valued that offer at about $18 a share.
   MAI Chairman Bennett S. LeBow had said June 22 it would increase
its offer, but no increase has yet been announced. On Thursday, the
company extended its previous offer until July 6.

   The United States, already the world's largest
debtor nation, strengthened its hold on that dubious title in 1988
as its foreign debt surged 41 percent to $532.5 billion, the
government said Thursday.
   The Commerce Department, releasing its annual balance sheet on
America's global economic standing, said the U.S. debt burden had
risen by $154.2 billion in 1988, up from $378.3 billion in debt to
foreigners the United States owed at the end of 1987.
   The figures mean that foreigners own more in U.S. assets than
Americans own abroad. The report was certain to fuel the already
heated debate over whether the United States is losing control of
its economic destiny to foreigners.
   Last year, the government said that foreign holdings in the
United States increased 15.4 percent, to $1.786 trillion. American
investments abroad rose a smaller 7.2 percent, to $1.253 trillion.
   The difference between those two figures represents the United
State's net debtor position.
   Britain remained the country with the largest stake in the United
States, with $101.9 billion in direct investment holdings, up 28
percent from 1987. Japan moved into second place with $53.3 billion
in direct holdings, up a sharp 52 percent from 1987.
   Some economists predict that the debt total could surpass the $1
trillion mark early in the next decade.
   They warn that the burden of servicing that debt will put a
severe strain on domestic resources, lowering living standards in
the United States as more and more money, in the form of interest
payments and dividends, flows into the hands of foreigners.
   ``We are exceedingly vulnerable as a country,'' said C. Fred
Bergsten, director of the Insttute for International Economics, a
Washington research group.
   ``We have a huge foreign debt and that means that decisions taken
abroad can increasingly influence our own economy. That is an
untenable postion for a country that wants to be a global power.''
   The Bush administration, like the Reagan administration before
it, played down the significance of the debt, noting that it still
represented a tiny fraction of America's $5 trillion economy and had
nowhere near the adverse impact as the smaller total debt carried by
Third World nations such as Brazil and Mexico.
   Commerce Secretary Robert Mosbacher said that the increase showed
that America was still viewed by foreign investors as a good place
to put their money.
   ``It just shows that this country is where everybody wants to
be,'' he said in an interview with Associated Press Radio.
   Commerce Undersecretary Michael Darby noted that the United
States was a net debtor from the Revolutionary War until 1914 as
foreigners provded the investment needed to develop America.
   ``It (foreign investment) doesn't make you a weak nation. It
doesn't make you a strong nation,'' Darby said, adding that what was
important was for the foreign funds to be used to modernize American
industry so that the country can compete in the global economy.
   Foreign direct investment, defined as ownership of at least 10
percent of a company, soared by 21 percent last year to a record
$328.8 billion, as foreigners went on something of a buying spree of
American companies.
   One of the largest purchases was the $6.5 billion acquisition of
Federated Department Stores by the Campeau Corp. of Canada.
   In addition to 10 percent ownership or more in companies, direct
investment includes holdings of office buildings and real estate.
   The foreign purchases of American companies and choice real
estate have set off alarms in Congress. Rep. John Bryant, D-Texas,
is leading an effort to require better accounting of foreign
ownership of U.S. assets.
   Bryant contends that the true value of foreign holdings in the
United States could be twice the official estimates because the
Commerce Department is forced to rely on ``incomplete, inaccurate
information.''
   The new debt figure highlighted the speed at which America's debt
is piling up.
   As recently as 1983, the United States was the world's largest
creditor nation with an investment surplus of $89 billion. That
surplus fell to $3.3 billion in 1984 and disappeared in 1985, when
the country became a net debtor for the first time in 71 years.
   The change has occurred because the United States transferred
billions of dollars into the hands of foreigners to pay for cars,
television sets and other imported goods. Those dollars are being
reinvested by foreigners in the United States in everything from
stocks and bonds to factories and real estate.

<HEAD>NWA Suitor Gets Commitments for Bank Financing</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MINNEAPOLIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The investor group led by Alfred Checchi
announced Thursday it has commitments from a group of banks for more
than $3.35 billion to finance its proposed $121-a-share purchase of
NWA Inc., parent of Northwest Airlines.
   The investor group, Wings Holdings Inc., issued a statement from
New York saying that its agent bank, Bankers Trust Co., had received
commitments for ``significantly more'' than the amount needed for
the purchase. It said the commitments would be adjusted to produce
the required $3.35 billion.
   Bankers Trust has agreed to commit $500 million toward an 8-year
loan, while Wings Holdings has pledged $700 million in equity toward
buying the Eagan, Minn.-based airline and related NWA subsidiaries.
   Participating lenders are being asked to commit $100 million to
$400 million each, said Tom Parisi, senior vice president at Bankers
Trust.
   He said loans would be secured by all of Northwest's assets,
consisting largely of more than $3 billion worth of aircraft.
   The NWA board of directors last week agreed to sell the company
to Wings Holdings for $121 a share. Checchi's buyout offer to NWA
shareholders holds through July 21. NWA and Checchi expect to
complete the sale by Sept. 18.
   Mike Hamilton, an analyst for the investment firm Piper Jaffray &amp;
Hopwood, said the Wings Holdings announcement reinforced Checchi's
earlier statements that he would have no trouble securing financing
for the deal.
   Analyst Kurt Rivard of Dain Bosworth Inc. agreed.
   ``This shows there's more than enough money available for them to
close the financing. And the positive thing is that it is bank
financing rather than junk bonds. It shows Checchi has been able to
convince the lending institutions that there's value there,'' Rivard
said.
   ``It's another hurdle he had to get through and he's through that
one,'' he added.
   Inanother development Thursday, the U.S. Department of
Transportation sent a letter to NWA, as expected, asking for more
information about the proposed acquisition.
   ``Basically, they asked for details on management structure,
financial forecasts, and explanation of the debt and equity
arrangements,'' Hamilton said.
   The request is part of the government's attempt to determine how
the acquisition will affect the airline's ability to operate,
Hamilton explained.
   ``To my knowledge, the DOT has not given any indication as to
when they'll have a decision on it,'' he added.
   NWA stock closed at $115 a share Thursday, down [ on the New York
Stock Exchange for the second straight day.

<HEAD>Brady Says Administration Still Seeking Capital Gains Cut</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady said
Thursday the administration will continue to seek a capital gains
tax cut despite a leading Democratic congressman's decision to look
elsewhere for revenue-raising provisions.
   Chairman Dan Rostenkowski of the House Ways and Means Committee
was reported Thursday to have said he had given up the idea of
cutting the capital gains tax because of Democratic opposition.
   Instead, the Illinois Democrat told the Wall Street Journal in an
interview, he plans to file a $5.3 billion tax-increase bill with
revenue-raising provisions instead of coupling a temporary reduction
in the capital gains tax with expansions of tax breaks for poor
people.
   Rostenkowksi said he encountered stronger resistance than
expected from Democrats, who argued the tax break would be too large
a benefit for wealthy people and also probably would cost the
government revenue in the long run.
   Brady noted in a statement Thursday that President Bush has made
a capital gains tax cut a key element of his economic program.
   ``It will lower the cost of capital, create incentives for
investment in the long-term productive capacity of American
industry, make American firms more competitive internationally and
create new job opportunities,'' Brady said.
   ``All Americans will benefit. We will emphasize these economic
benefits as we work with Congress to achieve enactment of the
capital gains measure,'' he added.
   In the interview, Rostenkowski described his capital gains tax
cut proposal as ``a kind of test balloon'' that he floated at Bush's
suggestion.
   The plan would have reduced the capital gains rate for a year
from the current top rate of as much as 33 percent, and would have
helped lower-income individuals with expanded tax credits for earned
income and child care.
   He said the plan would have raised about $15 billion over two
years because of churning of assets during the short-term change.
   Rostenkowski said he was considering a variety of revenue-raising
provisions that Bush would be most likely to accept given his pledge
not to increase taxes.

<TEXT>
   Vestron Inc., running out of cash after
losing a $100 million line of credit, said Thursday it had severely
curtailed its film production and distribution business and laid off
about 140 employees.
   ``This is a cash squeeze put on by Security Pacific National Bank
revoking their loan,'' said Stephen Einhorn, executive vice
president and chief financial officer of Stamford-based Vestron.
   ``The layoffs are the result of the practical matter of a
constricted cash situation. We are really unable to do the
distribution and production that the staff is there to do,'' Einhorn
said
   He said the affected employees were notified Thursday of the
layoffs, which were effective immediately.
   Einhorn said Vestron has been severely damaged by the revocation
of the credit line in October. Security Pacific has not made clear
its reason for withdrawing the credit, he said.
   Vestron company has been working to establish new sources of
financing by Monday, the day its short-term credit line from Wells
Fargo Bank expires.
   The layoffs came mostly at Vestron Pictures, the company's film
production arm, said J. Garrett Blower, a company spokesman.
   ``While we intend to persevere, we will have to do so on the
basis of a more narrowly defined business plan,'' Austin O. Furst
Jr., Vestron's chairman and chief executive officer, said in a
statement.
   The 8-year-old company's domestic home video business will not be
changed and some motion picture projects will continue, Einhorn said.
   Among Vestron's completed or near-finished films are ``Little
Monsters,'' starring Fred Savage; ``Fear'' with Ally Sheedy; and
``Blue Steel'' with Jamie Lee Curtis. Einhorn said it has not been
determined how or if Vestron will release the films.
   Despite the cutbacks, the company will continue to push forward
with production of ``Dirty Dancing II,'' the sequel to ``Dirty
Dancing,'' Einhorn said. ``Dirty Dancing'' grossed $60 million in
1987 and was Vestron Pictures' sole major success.
   Vestron Pictures' current releases include ``Earth Girls Are
Easy,'' ``The Rainbow,'' ``Wonderland'' and ``Far From Home.''
   Vestron Pictures was launched in January 1986 as an offshoot of
Vestron Video, at that time the country's largest independent video
casette distributor.
   Vestron has announced its intention to sell its The Video Store
chain of retail video rental outlets.

   Alan Woods, administrator of the Agency for
International Development (AID) in the Reagan and Bush
administrations and a strong advocate of linking U.S. assistance to
economic reform, died Thursday of cancer at the age of 43.
   He also was a former deputy U.S. trade representative and a
proponent of open trade policies.
   President Bush called Woods ``a personal and professional friend
who served his country with compassion and distinction.''
   ``Alan was committed to focusing AID's work on promoting growth
in developing countries'' to eliminate poverty, Bush said. ``He
cared deeply for those people around the world who needed our help.''
   Even during his battle against cancer, the president said, ``he
also continued to promote the ideas and programs in which he
believed.''
   In one of his last appearances, Woods on May 12 argued for
concentrating U.S. aid assistance on what he called ``sustainable
development.'' Instead of being given away, Woods said, aid should
be a temporary bridge to private support and ``self-sustained
growth.''
   In the trade post, which Woods held from 1985 to 1987, he was the
Reagan administration's chief strategist in dealing with Congress on
trade legislation and the lead negotiator with Canada on lumber and
also on U.S. market access to Portugal and Spain.
   Then at AID, beginning in 1987, Woods promoted market-oriented
economic policies, believing they and open trade held the key to
progress, in developed and undeveloping countries alike.
   Woods, whose first name was Michael, was a native of Mexico, Mo.,
and served in 1973-1974 as chief of staff for Christopher Bond, then
the governor of Missouri and now a U.S. senator.
   In the Nixon administration, Woods was the deputy director of the
office of presidential personnel and later became assistant press
secretary. In the Ford administration, he was a Pentagon spokesman
and an adviser on the budget.
   His wife, Cameron, and two young daughters, Alexandra and
Caroline, survive him, as well as his parents, Donald and Darlene
Woods of Mexico, Mo.

<HEAD>Sears' Retail Reorganization Taking Shape</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID DISHNEAU</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Sears, Roebuck and Co. said Thursday it had
created a new management structure for its retailing headquarters
that will eliminate at least 400 jobs and make Sears stores more
responsive to customers.
   The job reductions, added to cuts already made among headquarters
management workers and in field operations staff, will bring to more
than 1,600 the number of Sears management jobs eliminated since the
nation's largest retailer announced its streamlining plan in March
1988.
   Already, 425 headquarters management workers have left and about
800 positions have been eliminated in a corresponding reorganization
of field operations.
   The new management structure will eliminate 400 management-level
jobs from the Sears Merchandise Group, said Ernest Arms, a spokesman
for the division.
   To cut the 400 jobs, Sears will offer incentives to quit or
retire to most of the 3,700 management workers in the Chicago-based
retail headquarters, the company said. The incentives will include
two weeks of severance pay for every year worked at Sears, up to 52
weeks of pay, the company said.
   Arms said the company expects more than 400 employees to accept
the incentive package, but if fewer do it would lay off the
necessary number to reach 400. He said any employee laid off would
receive the incentive package.
   Sears announced earlier this week that the Merchandise Group will
move from the Sears Tower to the Chicago suburb of Hoffman Estates
within three years. The Sears Tower, the world's tallest building,
has been put up for sale as part of the restructuring.
   Arms said the new management structure, which should be in place
by mid-August, will create a ``vertical'' chain of command _ from
the retail store to the group vice president _ for each of the
retail group's six major business lines.
   For example, the manager of a store's Brand Central appliance and
electronics department will no longer report to the manager of that
store but to a district manager who is also involved solely with the
appliance-and-electronics business.
   The other business lines are home fashions, home improvement,
women's apparel, men's and children's apparel, and automotive.
   Arms said the management structure would fit well with the
``store of superstores'' concept that Sears is pursuing in the
radical restructuring of its retail business.
   ``What this all means is that we are becoming quicker on our
feet, more responsive to the customer, able to act faster in today's
retailing environment,'' Arms said.
   In an effort to battle discount chains, Sears has cut prices and
increased the number of brand-name products at its stores.
   In yet another departure from tradition, Sears announced
Wednesday it would lease space in three of its stores to
Kuppenheimer Mens' Clothiers.
   The announcement came just a month after Sears said it planned to
discontinue sales of suits and sportscoats and emphasize more casual
clothing in its men's clothing departments.
   The deal with Kuppenheimer is the first time Sears has contracted
with a known apparel retailer.
   The strategy is similar to the recent move by Montgomery Ward &amp;
Co. to rent space in its stores to specialty outlets such as Toys
`R' Us and Rose Records.
   Sears officials said Kuppenheimer will set up shop at the Sears
store in the Northridge Shopping Center in Milwaukee and at two
other undisclosed stores on the East Coast and the Midwest.
   Kuppenheimer is a 115-store subsidiary of Chicago-based Hartmarx.
It primarily sells private-label suits, sportscoats, dress shirts,
slacks and neckwear.

<TEXT>
   A computer entrepreneur accused of stealing
nearly $1 million from investors was sentenced to up to 15 years in
prison Thursday after he was convicted of 46 of 50 criminal charges.
   A jury that convicted Tex Z. Hildreth on 26 of 28 counts of
larceny Wednesday found him guilty on 20 of 22 additional charges
Thursday. Norfolk Superior Court Judge Roger J. Donahue sentenced
him to state prison in Walpole.
   The jury reached its decision on the first 28 counts Wednesday
after deliberating more than eight hours.
   Prosecutors contended Hildreth, 25, stole nearly $1 million from
investors and three banks between 1985 and 1988.
   He was accused of misrepresenting the success of his computer
consulting company, Massdata Corp. of Braintree, and claiming
falsely that he was on the verge of inheriting a multimillion-dollar
family trust fund.
   When a criminal investigation of Massdata began in May 1988,
Hildreth and his mother, Rose, fled and attempted suicide in a New
Hampshire hotel room.
   In a surprise move Tuesday, Hildreth chose not to take the stand
in his own defense, although his lawyer had said at the beginning of
the trial that Hildreth would testify. His trial lasted 12 days.
   Hildreth's defense has been that he was innocent by reason of
insanity.
   Two psychiatrists and a neuropsychologist who examined him
testifed that he suffers a variety of psychiatric troubles,
including personality disorders and manic depression. But under
questioning by the prosecution, they acknowledged that Hildreth is
not psychotic or unable to distinguish reality from fantasy.

<DATELINE>RANDOLPH, Mass. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A cold shoulder from Dunkin' Donuts
management won't deter two Canadian companies that want to gobble up
the doughnut chain, the Canadian firms said Thursday.
   Dunkin' Donuts' board of directors advised shareholders Wednesday
not to tender their shares for the $43 per share offered by Cara
Operations Limited and Kingsbridge Capital Group, both of Toronto.
   In a statement, the Canadian firms said the rejection of their
``all-cash, all-shares offer ... demonstrates the continuing
contempt of the Dunkin' Donuts board of directors for its fiduciary
duty to the owners of Dunkin' Donuts _ the common shareholders.''
   Dunkin' Donuts, based in this Boston suburb, has rejected a
friendly buy-out offer from the groups and taken several steps to
make itself a less tasty takeover target, including adopting a
``poison pill'' preferred stock plan and an employee stock ownership
program.
   Cara and Kingsbridge said those measures will cost shareholders a
total of $7.6 million, more than 40 percent of Dunkin' Donuts 1988
net income, substantially damaging earnings.
   Furthermore, Dunkin' Donuts agreed to pay its financial advisers
and backers, Goldman Sachs &amp; Co. and General Electric Capital Corp.,
more than $2.5 million at shareholders' expense, the Canadian
companies said.
   The companies reaffirmed their offer, which expires July 13, and
said they are prepared to commit up to $80 million in equity and
debt as well as short-term financing to making the takeover succeed.
