   President Bush on Friday awarded the
Presidential Citizens Medal to Ezra Taft Benson, a former
agriculture adviser to two presidents.
   Benson, a former adviser to Presidents Franklin D. Roosevelt and
Dwight Eisenhower, is ``one of the most distinguished Americans of
his time,'' the medal citation said.
   The Utah native was a ``leader of his church, and 60-year friend
of the Boy Scouts of America,'' the citation said.
   Benson is president of the Mormon Church.
   The medal is given to people who have performed exemplary deeds
of service for their country or fellow citizens.

<HEAD>Finnish Tourist Drowns After Chunk of Glacier Drops Into Lake</HEAD>
<DATELINE>OSLO, Norway (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Finnish tourist standing on shore drowned
when a huge block of glacial ice dropped into a lake and caused a
wave that swept him into the frigid water, local news reports said.
   The 34-year-old victim, who was not identified, was on land
about 20 feet from the edge of a small, deep lake when the wave hit
him on Wednesday, the Dagbladet newspaper reported on Thursday.
   A large group of tourists was watching when Svartisen, a glacier
near the northern Norway town of Mo I Rana, dropped chunks of ice
into the ocean, at the time of the accident, reported the newspaper.
   ``The Finnish tourist was ... about 35 meters (112 feet) from
the glacier itself. He probably lost his balance when the mass of
water hit him,'' acting Rana Sherrif Terje Storroe was quoted as
saying.
   Sightseers fled the wave that crashed onto the shore and watched
helplessly as the tourist was washed into the lake, Dagbladet said,
citing eyewitnesses.
   ``It would have been madness for anyone to have tried to swim
out to him in that icy water,'' he said.

   An 80-year-old woman who allegedly beat
her husband with a crutch during an argument over their will has
been charged with his death, police say.
   Stavroula Plexidas was arrested Wednesday in Megalochori, a
small farming village on this outskirts of this town in central
Greece, and charged with the murder of her husband, Nikolaos, 78.
   Plexidas was arrested after her dying husband told police that
she had beaten him with her wooden crutch as he lay in bed Tuesday
night after an argument over their estate, a police spokesman said
Thursday, speaking on condition of anonymity.
   Nikolaos Plexidas died in hospital on Wednesday of a heart
attack and an autopsy also showed lacerations on his neck and legs,
the spokesman said, requesting anonymity in accordance with Greek
practice.
   Mrs. Plexidas told arresting officers that her husband fell off
his bed and struck his head on the floor, the spokesman said.
   He said the suspect had circulatory problems and could not walk
without the support of crutches.

   Teddy is an ordained minister who can
perform religious services, marry people and baptize them _
provided he doesn't get distracted by a mouse.
   Teddy happens to be a calico cat who got a preacher's
credentials after the Better Business Bureau in Huntsville decided
to check out a mail-order business.
   Kathleen Calligan, Teddy's owner and the president of the
Huntsville Better Business Bureau, said she spotted an ad in a
free-circulation newspaper for United Christian Church and
Ministerial Association in Cleveland, Tenn.
   Ms. Calligan filled out an application for her cat, mailed in
$20 cash and waited about a month. Teddy received his preacher's
license last week by return mail.
   Ms. Calligan stressed that nothing illegal was found with the
way United ordains people, or pets. But she added that she sent in
the bogus application to point out the nature of the business.
   ``I don't want to say this is good or this is bad, but they just
ordained a cat. This could be Charles Manson,'' Ms. Calligan said.
   The founder and president of the United Christian Church &amp;
Ministerial Association rejected her criticism, saying Ms. Calligan
lied and fraudulently obtained the license.
   ``I can't check all these licenses. This is a master liar,'' the
Rev. H. Richard Hall said of Ms. Calligan's application.
   The Better Business Bureau office in Chattanooga, Tenn., has
received a few calls about Hall's organization since the beginning
of the year, according to John Myers, president of the office.
   ``We have questioned them about whether this is a diploma
mill,'' Myers said. ``They offer phony credentials.''
   Myers said such licenses granted through the mail give the false
impression that the holder has been through a post-secondary school
education.
   Hall said his organization checks out most applications, but
this one slipped through.
   While Ms. Calligan did not state that the applicant was a cat,
she did provide enough unusual information to raise questions, she
said.
   On the application, Ms. Calligan wrote that the applicant's
birthdate was April 2, 1989, and that the cat's calling to the
ministry was ``to make people happy and not hunt birds.''
   She listed two Huntsville preachers as references to be
contacted. Both had been briefed on the application and were told
to tell United officials that the applicant was a cat. Neither was
contacted, Ms. Calligan said.

   No one noticed Dr. Olin S. Allen II as
he drifted off to sleep in a rocking chair in the furniture section
of a Sears department store.
   When the store closed, Allen was still slumbering. His nap
lasted four hours.
   When he awoke at 1 a.m. Wednesday, sensors inside the store set
off alarms at his first movement, and security guards and city
police surrounded the building.
   ``I was standing there trying to figure out how to use the store
phone when a security guard and a police officer came in,'' said
Allen, 64, who thinks the Chinese food he had for dinner
contributed to his languor.
   ``I heard them say, `We have our robber.' I said, `You don't
have a robber. I just want to get out of the store.'''
   Police and security believed Allen, a radiologist, and did not
press charges.
   Allen called the security office later to thank guards and
police for their courtesy _ and for not shooting him.
   ``He was grateful,'' said Dick Russell, head of security for the
store. ``I tried to sell him the chair, but he wasn't buying.''

   Richard Johnson goes to great lengths to
get to work. Really.
   From Lebanon to Oak Ridge _ 281 miles and five hours a day on
the road. Seventy-thousand miles a year just to get to work and
back.
   He does this because his wife is a nursing supervisor in Lebanon
and the drive ``is easier on me than ruining her career.''
   Johnson, a tooling engineer at Pic-Air Co. in Oak Ridge,
recently was picked from among 200 entrants to win the title of
``No. 1 Commuter in the USA'' in a contest sponsored by Kraco, a
California automotive electronics company.
   Johnson leaves his house in Lebanon at 3:30 a.m. central time,
loses an hour on the way to Oak Ridge, which is in the eastern time
zone, then picks it back up to arrive home about 6 p.m.
   ``The time change doesn't bother me,'' he said.``I keep my watch
on central time and automatically think one hour ahead when I'm
here.''
   Johnson's year-old Chevrolet replaced a 1985 Renault with
175,000 miles on it.
   ``I retired the Renault,'' he said. ``Well, not retired. It just
doesn't want to go forward or backward.''

   Many of us have waited _ and waited _
for the card or letter that never arrives. But don't give up; it
just may someday.
   The summer of 1958, when Mary Garrison and her husband moved to
Utah, they took a trip to Yellowstone National Park with Mary's
sister, Leah Kerby. At the lodge at Old Faithful, Mary Garrison
sent a postcard to her parents in Columbus, Miss.
   A few weeks ago, Kerby, who still lives in Mississippi,
discovered the card when she stopped by the post office to pick up
the mail. One postmark was dated June 2, 1989, in Columbus. The
other: ``Yellowstone Park, Wyo. Jul 14 8:30 AM 1958.''
   She called her sister in South Ogden.
   ``Leah says, `I just came from the post office and received a
postcard from you,''' said Garrison. ``I said, `Where in the world?
I didn't send you a postcard.' She said, `Yes you did, in 1958.'''
   Jim Sherman, postmaster of Yellowstone Post Office at Mammoth
Hot Springs, Wyo., said he doubts the card had spent all those
years lost in Yellowstone because all the postal buildings have
been torn down and replaced with new structures since 1958.
   Perhaps, he said, it stuck to another piece of mail and went to
another address.
   ``That happens occasionally,'' Sherman said.
   Columbus Postmaster Roy Smith said he has ``no earthly idea''
where the postcard could have been. The only other similar case
he's heard of is a letter that wound up hidden under a radiator for
several years. It wasn't discovered until the post office was moved
to another location.

published after he and his wife had died, is set for publication in
October.
   Warner Books announced the publication date for ``Where the Buck
Stops,'' a collection of previously unpublished personal and
private writings by Truman, president from 1945-1953.
   In the September issue of Writer's Digest, New York literary
agent Scott Meredith says he is collaborating with Truman's
daughter, Margaret Truman Daniel, in editing the writings.
   Meredith says in his article that the book is ``blunt and frank
and honest in typical Truman fashion.''
   Chapter titles include: ``Why I Don't Like Ike,'' `My Favorite
President: Andrew Jackson,'' ``Becoming a World Power: Dropping the
Bomb.'' Other chapters treat the American Revolution, treatment of
the Indians, and Truman's thoughts on George Washington.

   A Chinese dissident leader, who fled his homeland
after the crackdown on student protests in Tiananmen Square,
appeared on a television news show Thursday and said he was no
longer afraid of the Chinese government.
   ``I can no longer be afraid,'' Wu'er Kaixi said on the ABC News
program ``Nightline'' late Thursday. ``I've already said what I
have to do is to carry forward the cause of those who died.
   ``I must do what they cannot have done. I have no time to
fear,'' he said.
   Wu'er and Yan Jiaqi, pro-democracy fugitives from China, arrived
in Chicago on Wednesday for the first Chinese Students Congress in
the United States, but failed to appear as scheduled at two news
conferences.
   Wu'er, speaking from a television studio in Chicago, said
conditions in China have grown more dangerous in recent weeks as
the government continues its crackdown on students who led the
pro-democracy demonstrations in Beijing and other Chinese cities.
   He said it may not be possible for all student leaders to escape
the country as he did.
   ``I'm not sure anyone else will be able to come out,'' he said.
``But those who manage to come out should carry forward the tasks
that they wish to carry out, and those who died wished to carry
out.''
   Earlier Thursday, organizers of the student congress said Wu'er
and Yan were in danger.
   ``They are in physical danger. They're really hiding,'' Minxin
Pei, a Harvard political science student and spokesman for the
fledgling congress, said at a news conference.
   The visitors escaped from China after the military crushed
student protests in Beijing's Tiananmen Square on June 4. They
later surfaced in Paris, where they have been trying to rally
worldwide support for the democracy movement in their homeland.
   The pair were scheduled to participate in Friday's formal
opening of the three-day meeting of Chinese students at American
schools. Pei said the FBI is protecting the two leaders and he did
not know their whereabouts.
   Wu'er, 21, was an organizer of the student demonstrations, and
Yan, 47, is the former director of the Political Science Institute
of the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences.
   ``They are honored guests. We want them to arrive safely and
leave safely,'' Pei said.
   Pei said Chinese officials have been harassing Chinese student
activists at U.S. universities by making death threats during
anonymous telephone calls. He said officials from the Chinese
consulate in New York even visited his apartment, called him a
traitor and a fool for his pro-democracy activities and threatened
``big trouble'' if he persisted.
   The Congress of Chinese Students in the United States, held at
the Chicago campus of the University of Illinois, is expected to
draw 500 Chinese students attending 154 U.S. colleges and
universities to discuss the democracy movement in China, Pei said.
   ``Our fellow brothers and sisters died in China, and we should
at least speak up for them,'' said Zhang Xin, a 33-year-old student
at the University of Chicago who helped organize the congress. ``It
is our fundamental duty.''
   The congress will try to set up a radio station south of China,
said Zhongdang Pan, a 31-year-old journalism graduate student at
the University of Wisconsin.
   ``Transmission will be very powerful and we will put this
transmission station very close to the border,'' Pan said.
   Pan said he also hopes to get a Chinese language newspaper
published in America and send copies to China.
   The congress plans to mail and fax news to Chinese offices,
hoping some of it will leak to the public. The news will be
addressed to businesses rather than to individuals to protect the
people who receive the messages.

   This poverty-stricken rural town has
received pledges of toilets, sinks and bathtubs from Florida to
Alaska for residents who only a few days ago had to haul water from
a muddy creek.
   ``We've come a long way in a short time, but we've still got a
long way to go,'' said Janie Cole, who with her husband have led a
decade-old fight to bring the community of about 40 homes into the
20th century. ``It's a warm feeling to know people still care about
each other.''
   Running water came only a week ago to the town of weathered
shacks and mobile homes sprinkled along a twisting gravel road in
southwest Mississippi.
   Until then, most residents hauled water from a creek or
collected rainwater from rooftops.
   Federal money was used to pipe water into the community, and
appeals by Cole and others resulted in a donations to pipe the
water from the main line along the road to front porches of each
home.
   But there progress has stopped.
   ``There are about 20 homes that have no inside plumbing, so they
are still getting their water for cooking and bathing from the
outside tap,'' Cole said.
   ``Many of these people are old and they have no money to take
care of the problem themselves,'' said Cole, whose family has a
private well. ``Without help, there is little they can do.''
   News coverage focused on the community's plight resulted in at
least 25 calls from groups and individuals offering donations of
fixtures and money, Cole said.
   ``A man in Florida has said he may provide water heaters, a
woman with an advertising agency in Kentucky pledged commodes, and
a man in Ohio has said he can help us with fixtures and possibly to
install sewer lines,'' she said.
   If the pledged fixtures show up, the major need would be
plumbing work for the homes, obtaining fittings to install fixtures
and a sewage system.
   Perhaps the most impressive offer, Cole said, came from
officials with the Alaska State Housing Authority.
   ``We have 150 substandard, low-income housing units we are
demolishing and replacing them with newer units and as a result we
will have fixtures and items we will be surplusing,'' said Ray
Price, the authority's executive director in Anchorage. ``Rather
than put these items in the shelf or auction them off, we felt it
would be best to send them down to those who need them.
   ``As you know, our state has been through some tough times the
last few years and we have rural communities here _ we are not
oblivious to what these guys are going through.''
   Mike Wadell, the authority's project manager, said officials
were negotiating with Federal Express to transport tubs and other
fixtures to Memphis, Tenn., and with a truck line to haul them to
Blue Hill.
   ``You really don't think people care that much any more but now
you see that they just needed to be made aware of your problems,''
said Mary Moore, who is raising her three sons in a mobile home in
Blue Hill.
   Moore said water had been piped inside her trailer ``and you
cannot believe how thrilled we are. But we are the lucky ones.''
   John W. Engerd, who owns a furniture plant and store in Berlin,
Ohio, called offering his help with plumbing and fixtures, but said
he may end up financing septic tanks and field lines.
   ``There are always people heading to South America or somewhere
else to help out, '' Engerd said. ``When I read about their
problems, I thought it would do more good to help someone right
here at home.''

<TEXT>
   Outgoing U.S. Customs Service Commissioner
William von Raab harshly criticized the federal government, saying
the United States is not serious about fighting illegal drugs,
according to a television report.
   In an interview Thursday with ABC-News, von Raab, who was not
reappointed and forced to resign his position of eight years, said
the State Department during the Reagan Administration ignored drug
production in other countries.
   ``I think that certainly is the case with Secretary (George)
Schultz who never really had anything to do with the drug issue. It
was totally foreign to him,'' he said in the ABC interview.
   He said the United States has failed to apply political and
economic pressure against drug-producing countries which allow
traffickers to roam freely.
   ``They feel no pressure whatsoever,'' von Raab said. ``They are
happily living out their lives as feudal barons in the hills of
Colombia, Peru, and Bolivia and no one's touching them, including
the United States. There's so much cocaine out there that we can't
control it.''
   After a U.S. drug agent was killed in 1985 by drug dealers in
Mexico, von Raab sealed the border to pressure the Mexican
government into finding the killers.
   President Reagan and Schultz were furious with his actions, von
Raab said.
   ``The administration went absolutely ballistic,'' he said.
``George Schultz, secretary of state, accused me of being
troglodyte. I often felt that it was sort of the Mexican government
and the U.S. government against me in the war on drugs.''
   He told ABC-News that President Bush and William Bennett, head
of the president's anti-drug program, are committed toward stemming
the flow of illegal drugs into the country. But he warned that not
much is being done while Bennett prepares his program.
   He said that Secretary of State James Baker, however, does not
seem to care about fighting illegal drugs.
   ``There's a sort of cowardly streak, I think, in our State
Department ... It really is scandalous,'' he said in the interview.
   He also criticized his boss, Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady,
saying that Brady is preoccupied with other issues instead of
dealing with the drug problem.
   ``It's just out of control,'' von Raab said, ``and in that sense
our national policy has been a total and abysmal failure.''
   ``As long as our war is being fought with phrases, words, empty
phrases, empty words, we're not going to win,'' he said. ``We've
got to turn the war from a war of words to a war of action.''
   State Department spokesman Adam Shub said he had seen the
program Thursday night and heard von Raab's comments on the Reagan
and Bush administrations but could not comment.
   Shub said Melvin Levitzsky, assistant secretary for narcotics,
has been on Capitol Hill two days and is expected to return Friday
in briefing Congress on the administration's anti-drug efforts.

<HEAD>NIH Researchers Say New Drug is Powerful Weapon Against AIDS</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PAUL RECER</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Early tests of a new AIDS drug are so
promising that federal scientists are expressing hope it may become
a powerful new weapon against the epidemic that now numbers 100,000
cases.
   Scientists say they hope to start an expanded second phase of
tests this fall and perhaps have the drug available for wide use
next year.
   Phase I trials, described in a report published today in the
journal Science, showed that the drug, called DDI, controlled the
growth of the AIDS virus and enabled patients to gain weight, feel
better and develop some resistance to infection.
   ``This is not a cure for AIDS,'' said Dr. Robert Yarchoan, a
National Cancer Institute researcher who helped direct the Phase I
trials. ``But it appears to control the disease.''
   The number of AIDS cases reached the 100,000 mark in recent
weeks, the Centers for Disease Control said, and 58,014 AIDS
patients had died as of June 30. No one is known to have recovered
from the disease.
   DDI, laboratory shorthand for 2',3'-dideoxyinosine, combats AIDS
by blocking reproduction of the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)
which causes the disease. This action is similar to AZT, or
zidovudine, the only drug now approved to directly treat AIDS, or
acquired immune deficiency syndrome.
   ``Like AZT, it (DDI) appears to reduce the replication of the
virus and controls the disease,'' Yarchoan said in an interview.
``It can keep the virus from replicating, but it can't rid the body
of the virus.''
   Yarchoan said NCI researchers hope to receive Food and Drug
Administration approval by September to start Phase II clinical
trials involving some 1,000 patients and 20 centers around the
country.
   He said these trials could last six months to a year, and, if
they go well, could lead to FDA approval for wide use of DDI.
   The journal Science said that after the new clinical trials are
underway, DDI manufacturer Bristol-Myers hopes to distribute the
drug without charge to patients who are in critical need. No
agreement for this distribution has been reached with the FDA,
however, the magazine said.
   Yarchoan said DDI's action of blocking reproduction of the AIDS
virus enables patients to recover some ability to fight infection.
This could prolong life since most AIDS patients die because immune
systems weakened by the HIV virus cannot combat infection.
   DDI, said Yarchoan, has important advantages over AZT: it is
less toxic, better tolerated by patients, and needs to be taken
only two or three times a day. AZT must be taken six times daily
without fail, which requires patients to awaken during the night.
   Yarchoan said the clinical trials of DDI started 47 weeks ago
for 26 patients. Five patients, who earlier were taking a closely
related compound called DDA, were added later.
   ``We started at very low doses and as the patients tolerated
each dose we worked our way up,'' Yarchoan said. ``After the first
four doses, we found hints of activity, but nothing that was too
substantial.
   ``But in our fifth dose, we found very consistent improvement in
immunologic function and at the same time evidence that the amount
of virus in the people was going down,'' he added.
   Meanwhile, a coalition of activists on Thursday said government
inaction regarding AIDS threatens to isolate people with the
disease and overburden the nation's health-care system.
   ``The greatest threat we face may not be the virus itself but
the complacency we see around us,'' said Jean McGuire, executive
director of the AIDS Action Council and head of the National
Organization Responding to AIDS.
   The groups called for federal anti-discrimination protections
for people with AIDS, more aggressive health-care planning and more
money for research and early intervention efforts with

   Actor Jack Lemmon said he's glad to be back on the
London stage and would ``much rather play here than on Broadway,
frankly.''
   The Oscar-winning actor appeared Thursday at a news conference
with Michael Gambon and Robert Flemyng, his co-stars in Donald
Freed's ``Veterans Day,'' and extolled Britain's well-known theater
culture.
   ``British audiences know how to listen. They know how to be
there when the damn curtain's going to go up. They understand
theater,'' said the 64-year-old Lemmon, sporting a crewcut from
filming his role in the upcoming film ``Dad.''
   ``In America, we do not culturally, unfortunately, go to the
theater often enough. It is an event and it shouldn't be.''
   ``Veterans Day,'' directed by Kevin Bellington, opens Aug. 22 at
London's Theater Royal and runs through Dec. 9.

   Singer Ella Fitzgerald is among the six musicians
chosen as the first inductees to the new Jazz-Blues-Gospel Hall of
Fame.
   ``Chicago has been the seat of gospel music for a long time,''
said Charles Colbert, the hall's president. ``Blues _ Muddy Waters,
Willie Dixon and many others are from here.
   ``This is naturally the place where it should be,'' Colbert said
at a ceremony Thursday honoring the hall.
   Although similar memorials to each of the three kinds of music
exist, the new Hall of Fame is the first single institution
honoring all of them, he said.
   The initial inductees for jazz are Ms. Fitzgerald and the late
trumpeter Louis Armstrong; Waters, the late singer and slide
guitarist, and bass player Dixon for blues; and composer Thomas
Dorsey, called ``the father of gospel music,'' and the late singer
Mahalia Jackson for gospel.
   They will be formally inducted at a ceremony later this year.

   Bobby Daniels, a former drummer for
singer Kenny Rogers, was found guilty of murder in the shooting
death of Daniels' ex-wife last year.
   The Criminal Court jury deliberated about seven hours over two
days before reaching its decision Thursday.
   Daniels, 41, testified Wednesday that all he remembers is seeing
Sylvia Coakley's lifeless body on the floor of her Nashville home
last August. Ms. Coakley, 35, who was a real estate agent, was shot
five times through a closed storm door.
   Daniels had been Rogers' drummer for about 12 years. He toured
with Rogers as recently as July 1988.

   Some of Bobby Brown's fans may be singing
``Don't Be Cruel'' after the singer canceled the 20 concerts in the
final leg of his U.S. tour.
   ``The reasons are very nebulous ... and the fair interprets this
as a lack of concern for Brown's fans and the public in general,''
said Maynard Potter, general manager of the California Mid-State
Fair in Paso Robles, who had booked Brown for Aug. 13.
   Brown's ``Don't Be Cruel'' album has sold nearly 5 million
copies and spawned four straight Top 5 singles.
   Richard Hofstetter, Brown's New York-based attorney, said the
singer wants to take some time to begin work on his next album.
   ``He had to make a choice here,'' Hofstetter said. ``He could
have made a lot more money staying on the road. But there's a lot
of pressure on him for the next album. He wants to make it right.''
   Brown has been touring since September and his latest song, ``On
Our Own,'' the theme from the movie, ``Ghostbusters II,'' is
climbing the music charts.

   Ex-Beatle Paul McCartney will begin a world tour
in September and promote the environmental group Friends of the
Earth along the way.
   The tour, McCartney's first in 13 years, begins in Oslo, Norway,
Sept. 26 and rolls through nine countries in Europe before heading
out to Asia and North and South America, wrapping up in the summer
of 1990.
   McCartney, 47, said Thursday he will play in the United States
in November or December and again later in the tour, but gave no
details on scheduled stops.
   Joining the bandwagon of stars campaigning to save the
environment from acid rain and to halt the depletion of the
atmosphere's ozone layer, he said: ``When I was a kid, if you had
told me when I grew up there would be a hole in the sky and the
rain would have acid in it and the seas would have nuclear
pollution in them, I wouldn't have believed you.''
   His band includes bass player Hamish Stuart, formerly of the
Average White Band; guitarist Robbie McIntosh, formerly of The
Pretenders; drummer Chris Whitten; and Wix, one of Britain's top
session keyboard players.

   Milan Williams, a founding member of the
Commodores, said he has been fired from the rhythm and blues band
for refusing to perform with the group in South Africa.
   Williams said at a news conference Wednesday that he was
dismissed after 20 years with the Commodores following a vote by
the other band members earlier this month.
   Williams refused to accompany the band to South Africa and made
his decision public. After a firestorm of criticism, the band
reluctantly agreed to cancel its trip.
   ``My moral position, as a black person and as a former member of
the Commodores, was to protect my integrity and the integrity of an
organization that existed for 20 years as a role model for the
black community,'' he said.
   The other three members of the band _ Walter Orange, William
King and J.D. Nicholas _ said in a recent letter to Williams that
they could be ``ostracized and financially ruined'' from the
adverse publicity Williams generated.
   Orange has said the group intended to use its visit to a black
homeland in South Africa to call for an end to that country's
policy of racial separation.

<BYLINE>How About Two Khe Sanhs for a Ho Chi Minh Trail? ^By LARRY McSHANE</BYLINE>

   This pack of cards doesn't come with a stick of
gum. And the ``VIETNAM'' emblazoned in red across its wrapper is a
clear sign it won't hold Dwight Gooden or Jose Canseco.
   Inside are ``Vietnam Fact Cards,'' part of a 66-card set
developed by Canadian collector Dino Frisella, making it possible
to swap two Khe Sanhs for a Ho Chi Minh Trail or flip Richard Nixon
and LBJ cards.
   ``The time to make a decision on whether the war was right or
wrong is long past. We thought if we just stuck with the facts _
major incidents, major players _ it would stir up conversation,''
said Frisella, whose Dart Flipcards Inc. produced the set.
   ``It's struck a real nerve with collectors.''
   Frisella didn't produce the cards as a joke or a novelty;
instead, he said from his Quebec home, he hoped they would be used
as an educational tool to teach youngsters about Vietnam.
   ``We know it's impossible to tell the story of Vietnam on the
back of 66 cards, but the only way you'll start to know about it is
if you can read about it,'' said Frisella.
   The cards were targeted for children 8 to 14, although many have
since been scooped up by collectors, he said.
   The cards are 2-by-4 inches; they come a half-dozen to a pack,
wrapped like baseball cards but without the gum. The complete set
costs $8.50. Frisella and partner Stewart Sergeant, who developed
the idea about 2{ years ago, printed more than 45,000 sets.
   The front of most cards feature color depictions of different
Vietnam events: The Battle of Xuan Loc or The Ho Chi Minh Trail. Or
they depict key figures of the era: Nixon and Henry Kissinger share
a card, presidents Lyndon Johnson and John F. Kennedy each have
their own.
   They do have one thing in common with baseball cards: The back
is filled with information _ not RBIs and home runs, but details
about whatever's on the front. The cards begin in 1945 and run
through 1975.
   ``We had about 400 source books and hundreds of hours of tape we
went through, pulling out facts and figures,'' said Frisella.
   One of his greatest fears was angering Vietnam vets who might
see the cards as trivializing the war. But compared to some other
products, Vietnam trading cards are the epitome of good taste.
   ``We've had all kinds of people out there selling the Vietnam
War in one shape or another _ comic books, you name it. One guy was
selling Vietnam War tombstones, with your service time right on the
stone,'' said Barry Kasinitz, spokesman for the Washington-based
Vietnam Veterans of America, although he hadn't seen the cards.
   The sets have won acceptance in certain sections of America's
heartland.
   Military museums in Johnson City, Ill., and Massillon, Ohio,
feature promotional displays for the cards; at the latter, the
response has been entirely positive.
   ``Basically, we get all military-oriented people. We thought at
first some people would be upset, but that hasn't happened,'' said
Barbara Tate, director of the Ohio Society of Military Information.
``People are really interested _ young kids, and a lot of Vietnam
vets too.''
   Some feedback has been negative _ an unidentified veteran was
quoted in Baseball Cards magazine as saying the Vietnam War didn't
belong on bubble-gum cards.
   Overall, Frisella couldn't be happier with the ways things have
gone.
   ``Some distributors were a little leery of anything with the
topic of Vietnam, afraid of retribution,'' he said. ``But all the
letters we've received _ and there's been a ton of 'em _ are
favorable.''

   A television station that packed
nearly an hour of commercials around a 91-second boxing match has
been fined $11,600 for airing too many advertisements, a
broadcasters' group said today.
   The Philippine Broadcaster's Association levied the fine against
station ABS-CBN after a public outcry over the large number of
commercials during the June 1988 bout between heavyweight boxers
Mike Tyson and Michael Spinks.
   Although Tyson took only 91 seconds to defeat Spinks, the
station stretched the program to more than one hour with
commercials.
   Vic de Vera, association executive director, said the industry
watchdog agency first levied a $48,000 fine last year but reduced
it to $11,600 this month after the station appealed.
   The station said the high cost of televising the Las Vegas match
and the ``unpredictability of its duration'' forced them to air
lengthy commercials. ABS-CBN added that it should also have been
given just a reprimand because it was the station's first violation
of the broadcast association's code.

   Now that an immigration appeals panel
has ruled that leftist writer Margaret Randall is an American
citizen who cannot be deported, the first thing she wants to do is
fly to Paris.
   ``Ironically, she will now finally be able to leave the country
and visit her grandchildren,'' said David Cole, Randall's attorney.
   The U.S. Board of Immigration Appeals ruled Thursday that
Randall became a Mexican citizen in 1967 under economic duress, and
the Immigration and Naturalization Service should not have
considered her politics in seeking to deport her.
   The board, which operates independently of the INS under the
U.S. Justice Department, determined that Randall never freely
renounced U.S. citizenship when she left in the 1960s for Mexico,
where she married a Mexican man.
   ``I'm absolutely thrilled, of course,'' the 52-year-old college
professor said. ``To tell you the truth, I'm a little numb.''
   Attorneys for Randall, an outspoken critic of U.S. policy who
lived 14 years in Cuba and Nicaragua, said the INS was trying to
punish her for her pro-communist views.
   Cole said the ruling ``should say to the INS, `Be a little more
careful in instituting deportation proceedings against citizens.'''
   Justice Department attorneys are reviewing the decision,
spokesman Dan Eramian said. Attorney General Dick Thornburgh will
have the final word on the case. INS cannot appeal it to another
court.
   Randall, a poet, author and photographer, has written 45 books
in English and Spanish, including 17 books of poetry. She has
taught at the University of New Mexico, Trinity College in
Hartford, Conn., and the Macalester College in St. Paul, Minn.,
since returning to the U.S. in 1983 on a visitor's visa.
   The INS claimed that Randall gave up her U.S. citizenship as a
political protest and wanted Mexican citizenship in order to get a
passport to Cuba. It also claimed that as the wife of a Mexican
citizen, she could have found work.
   Randall claimed her husband, from whom she separated in 1967,
ceased providing for their three children, one of whom was ill. She
also said she was led to believe that work laws in Mexico forced
her to be a citizen before she would find a job.
   Randall was ordered deported in 1985 after her request for
permanent resident status as an alien was denied based on what the
INS said were communist and anti-American beliefs espoused in her
books.
   Norman Mailer, Kurt Vonnegut, Alice Walker, Arthur Miller and
William Styron were among writers who filed suit in U.S. District
Court in Washington, D.C., after the INS denied her application.
   Cole said the 3-2 decision by the appeals panel was unexpected.
   ``I think the decision affirms that U.S. citizenship is a
constitutional right and that one cannot lose one's citizenship
because the government doesn't like what you say,'' said Cole of
the New York-based Center for Constitutional Rights. ``It's sort of
a nice rebuke to the INS.''
   ``Now we just go to the passport office to pick up her
passport,'' Cole said. ``She's a U.S. citizen.''
   Randall, who has been living near her parents in Albuquerque,
said she wants to fly to Paris for the birth next month of her
third grandchild.
   ``I'm hoping I can be there when he's born, which was not
possible the first two times around,'' she said.

<HEAD>Fetal Blood Cells Found in Pregnant Women's Blood</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PAUL RAEBURN</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   Researchers have isolated fetal cells
from pregnant women's bloodstreams, suggesting it should be
possible to diagnose genetic disorders in a fetus simply by taking
a blood sample from the mother.
   If the preliminary finding of fetal cells in mother's
bloodstreams is confirmed, it should be possible to do the same
kind of genetic tests on those fetal cells as are now done on fetal
tissue samples obtained through amniocentesis. That procedure
involves the withdrawal of some of the fluid surrounding the fetus.
   Making the diagnosis from a blood sample would eliminate the
small risk associated with amniocentesis, the researchers said.
   The method, however, cannot be used to screen for Down's
syndrome and other disorders in which the chromosomes must be
examined under a microscope, because the fetal cells isolated from
the mother's bloodstream do not allow chromosome diagnosis.
   The method could be useful for diagnosing such disorders as
sickle cell anemia, cystic fibrosis and phenylketonuria, in which
the precise genetic defect is known, the study's authors said.
   In those cases, the genetic defect can be detected chemically,
and examination of chromosomes under a microscope is unnecessary.
   Researchers have known that fetal cells could occasionally break
off of the placenta and get into a pregnant woman's bloodstream.
But no one had demonstrated that this occurred often enough so that
fetal cells could be routinely found in the mothers' blood.
   The study, headed by Dr. Diana Bianchi of Boston Children's
Hospital, shows that the fetal cells can be regularly isolated from
mothers' blood, but not 100 percent of the time.
   That accuracy must be improved, and it may be some years before
the method is reliable enough for routine use, Bianchi said in a
telephone interview.
   Furthermore, researchers need better ways to be certain that the
cells they isolate are from the fetus, she said Thursday.
   Bianchi's results will be discussed Saturday at a meeting of
geneticists at the Jackson Laboratory in Bar Harbor. She presented
preliminary findings at a meeting in Washington of the Society for
Pediatric Research in May and has submitted more detailed findings
for publication in a medical journal.
   Dr. Laird Jackson of Thomas Jefferson Medical College in
Philadelphia said that Bianchi's research provides the most
convincing evidence yet that a blood sample from the mother can be
used to diagnose fetal disorders. He noted, however, that the
method is not yet perfected.
   Bianchi and her colleagues, who sampled the blood of four
pregnant women, said looking for the fetal cells was far worse than
looking for a needle in a haystack. The mothers' blood contained
roughly one fetal cell for every billion mothers' cells.
   ``You're really at the limits of technology,'' Bianchi said.
   Fetal cells were extracted by adding an antibody to the blood
sample that would stick to fetal red blood cells but not to adult
red blood cells. The cells with antibodies attached to them could
then be separated with a sophisticated electronic sorting machine.
   But the researchers then had to prove that the cells they had
isolated were indeed fetal cells. Three of the mothers tested were
carrying male fetuses. Males have Y chromosomes and females don't,
so the researchers tried to show that the cells they'd isolated had
Y chromosomes. That would mean that the cells came from the male
fetus, not the mother.
   The researchers were able to prove the existence of the Y
chromosome in two of the three cases in which mothers carried male
fetuses. Bianchi said subsequent tests on more mothers have shown
that the method is reasonably accurate but not perfect.
   The fetal cells that they isolated are called nucleated red
blood cells. Unlike adult red blood cells, these cells have a
nucleus that carries a complete set of the fetus's genes. It is
these genes that can be analyzed for the presence of disorders.

   A report on black Americans attacks the belief
that poor people are locked into a self-perpetuating ``culture of
poverty'' that sets them apart from society and saps them of the
will to work or sacrifice.
   Many of the nation's poor ``are hard-working people who save
when they can, endure numerous deprivations, worry about the future
and urge their children to do well in school and on the job,''
experts said after a four-year study.
   The conclusion was a central finding in ``A Common Destiny:
Blacks and American Society,'' issued Thursday by a panel of the
National Research Council, an arm of the National Academy of
Sciences and Engineering.
   Yale economist Gerald Jaynes directed the study, participated in
by nearly 100 academic experts. Foundations paid most of the $2.7
million cost.
   The report was described as the most comprehensive study ever
undertaken of the condition of blacks in America. Its chief finding
was that while discrimination still holds blacks back, economic
stagnation that took hold in the mid-1970s is the chief factor in a
widening gap between American whites and blacks.
   Whites have changed their attitudes but not their behavior, and
that's another cause of the gulf between equal opportunity for
blacks and its actual attainment, Jaynes said.
   ``Whites desire equal treatment for blacks in society, but many
are reluctant to put this desire into practice in their personal
life,'' he told a news conference.
   ``This is a great improvement over 45 years ago, when majorities
of whites openly supported segregation or discriminatory treatment
of blacks, but the divergence between principle and practice
frequently means that social institutions do not produce the equal
opportunity that Americans desire,'' he said.
   As for the ``culture of poverty,'' the report disputed the
assumption that poverty is perpetuated from generation to
generation as children learn self-indulgence, have low aspirations
in school and lose any ability to sacrifice for the future _
qualities that lock them in poverty.
   Most poor families move in and out of poverty several times over
a lifetime, which would not happen if such a condition existed, the
report said; the chronically poor are only a minority of all poor
people.
   Moreover, ``many poor people do not exhibit the stereotypic set
of characteristics supposedly constituting the culture of poverty,
such as apathy and an unwillingness to defer gratification.''
   The report also cited studies which found no difference in the
values and goals of people who are poor and those who aren't.
   The ``insecure and deprived conditions of life of poor families,
when long continued, do result in `cultural' differences from
well-to-do and secure families,'' the report said, but those
difference vanish when the poor are given economic opportunity and
the incentives to live better.

<HEAD>Legislation Would Impose Restrictions On Environmentalists' Court

<TEXT>
   A regional dispute that pits Northwest timber
interests against defenders of the spotted owl is spiraling into a
national struggle over whether Congress should impose extraordinary
restrictions on the legal rights of environmentalists.
   After winning a string of preliminary court victories blocking
logging in vast sections of the ancient forests where the owls
nest, environmentalists say a temporary cease fire Congress may
impose would set a precedent that could be used to block judicial
review of a wide range of federal decisions and actions.
   Environmentalists have enlisted the aid of organizations ranging
from the American Civil Liberties Union to the Center for Auto
Safety and the Mexican American Legal Defense and Education Fund to
the Union of Concerned Scientists.
   ``Prohibiting citizen challenges to government actions places
agencies above the law and violates fundamental principles of
democratic government,'' the groups said in a letter to senators.
   While the groups noted that recent limitations on judicial
review set by Congress have involved public land and resource
issues, ``the practice could be used to bar citizen challenges to
any government agency.''
   The interior appropriations bill is headed for a House-Senate
conference committee to iron out differences in the two versions
before final passage by both houses. The House version does not
include the timber amendment.
   An amendment attached by Northwest lawmakers to the
Senate-passed bill would bar federal courts from enjoining or
overturning any timber sale planned in the federal forests of
Oregon and Washington known to contain spotted owls. The ban would
be in effect for 14 months.
   In addition, the amendment requires that environmentalists agree
by Oct. 1 to release more than half of the roughly 2 billion board
feet of timber enjoined for immediate sale. If they don't, the
amendment would allow the Forest Service and the Bureau of Land
Management to proceed with the sales regardless of the injunctions.
   Jay Hair, president of the National Wildlife Federation, said
the amendment would allow the Forest Service to ``break virtually
every environmental law Congress has ever set.''
   Northwest lawmakers said that even though they were reluctant to
limit judicial review, it was necessary if they were to keep the
timber industry afloat until a permanent fix can be imposed.
   Lawmakers say mills in Washington and Oregon already are closing
because of a severe shortage of timber resulting from the
injunctions.
   ``No one was eager to do this,'' said Rep. Al Swift, D-Wash.
``But we needed some certainty in the timber supply and that
couldn't be achieved if the sales were tied up in the courts. This
is only a short-term fix.''
   Sen. Brock Adams, D-Wash., said that lawmakers were ``under
great pressure to act'' and the amendment was aimed not only at
ensuring mills had enough logs to operate but also at the beginning
to protect some of the most significant stands of old-growth timber.
   ``We did what we had to do,'' said Adams, adding that despite
the judicial limitations, lawsuits challenging Forest Service and
BLM management plans for spotted owl habitat would be allow to
continue ``on their merits.''
   Lawmakers also said the precedent for limiting judicial review
previously had been set by Congress, though Adams said it had
always been used sparingly.
   Congress in the 1930s limited the ability of federal courts to
issue injunctions in labor strikes. And in authorizing the Alaska
oil pipeline in the early 1970s, Congress said the issuance of
construction and operation permits would not be subject to judicial
review.
   More recently, Congress enacted a statute in 1980 that allowed
the Secretary of Transportation to impound federal highway funds
despite court injunctions prohibiting it. In 1983, Congress
exempted the MX missile program from federal environmental laws in
the midst of an ongoing court challenge.
   Sen. Mark Hatfield, R-Ore., has four times over two years
attached amendments to appropriations bill that barred appeals of
several planned timber sales.
   When the timber amendment was offered in the Senate
Appropriations earlier this week, three Democratic senators spoke
against it _ Wyche Fowler of Georgia, Dale Bumpers of Arkansas and
Harry Reid of Nevada.
   ``This is unprecedented,'' said Fowler, adding that Congress
needed to be careful in approving such legislation despite the
timber crisis.

   The tick-carried Rocky Mountain spotted fever, a
potentially deadly disease, increased nearly 4 percent last year,
with dramatic hikes reported in Missouri, Arkansas and Kentucky.
   The national Centers for Disease Control reported Thursday that
615 cases of Rocky Mountain spotted fever occurred in the United
States in 1988, up 3.9 percent from 592 cases in 1987.
   The largest number of cases occurred in North Carolina, with
108, followed by Oklahoma with 97 and Missouri with 57.
   The Missouri data indicate that the geographic focus of the
disease may be shifting. That state's case total was up nearly
threefold from just 19 cases in 1987.
   ``The increase in Missouri may reflect an extension of the area
in which RMSF is endemic in the West South Central states,'' the
CDC said.
   Large increases also occurred in Arkansas, from 12 to 32 cases,
and in Kentucky, from 13 to 30.
   The disease causes symptoms including fever, headache and rash.
At least 21 deaths were reported in 1988.
   ``Because no vaccine exists ... the best preventive measure is
avoidance of tick-infested areas,'' the CDC said in its report.
   The CDC recommends that people who are in tick-infested areas
wear protective clothes and use tick repellent.
   Tick bites were reported in 63 percent of the U.S. cases. The
CDC said such reports are important because in cases where tick
bites are not reported, ``diagnosis may be delayed,'' increasing
the ``likelihood of serious or fatal complications.''

<HEAD>WASHINGTON TODAY: Why Hasn't Felix Bloch Been Arrested?</HEAD>
<BYLINE>An AP News Analysis</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   It is now six weeks since Felix Bloch was
ordered to surrender his pass to the State Department on the
suspicion the veteran diplomat was engaged in espionage for the
Soviet Union.
   But the suspended bureaucrat, still collecting his pay, is free
to travel to visit relatives in New York's Westchester County _
trailed by FBI agents, themselves reportedly trailed by Soviet
agents. He also is evidently free to leave the country.
   It could be that the FBI and other investigators simply do not
have the evidence to arrest the 54-year-old Bloch and are hoping
the Soviets will try to make contact with him.
   To a reporter who knew him casually, Bloch is a most unlikely
spy. Courtly and pleasant, he was engaged in the European Bureau in
the driest of jobs.
   Bloch headed the Office of Regional Political-Economic Affairs,
which has nothing to do with the NATO military alliance and
conventional and nuclear weapons issues.
   Instead, he was concerned with trade and development _ and with
two Western groups headquartered in Paris: the Organization for
Economic Development and the Coordinating Committee on Strategic
Materials.
   The first is devoted to joint development efforts both in the
wealthy West and in the impoverished Third World. The second seeks
to restrict the sale of security-sensitive material to the Soviet
Union and the Eastern bloc.
   The job took Bloch to Paris where he was videotaped handing a
briefcase _ contents not revealed _ to a Soviet agent.
   Bloch was in the French capital in mid-May to address West
European economic officials on the European Community's effort to
establish a single integrated market by 1993. He also went to
Madrid for the semiannual meeting of the European Community's
political directors. At the end of May he was in Brussels for
President Bush's meeting with Jacques Delors of the European
Commission.
   Only last Tuesday _ a month after he was put an administrative
leave _ Bloch and other State Department officials attended a
meeting here in Washington of the Atlantic Council, a private
foreign-policy group.
   As Alice in Wonderland might have said: ``It just gets curiouser
and curiouser.''
   If Bloch was under suspicion of spying for the Soviets, why was
he allowed to roam around this country and Western Europe?
   If he is a spy, why hasn't he been swapped quietly for an
American agent or some other prize in Soviet hands?
   After all, as President Bush observed on Monday, ``espionage
goes on'' all the time.
   Bloch has hired two lawyers to help him contest the accusations,
which may stem from his work in Vienna first as the economics
officer and then as deputy chief of mission in the U.S. Embassy
there.
   Senior State Department officials have confirmed that as the No.
2 person in the embassy, Bloch was informed of Central Intelligence
Agency activities. ``He saw everything, especially when he worked
for two political appointees,'' Helene Von Damm and Ronald Lauder,
who were unschooled in foreign policy.
   He also had the job of trying to keep Austria, a neutral
country, from shipping sensitive materials to the East.
   Bloch, who fled Austria as a child as Nazism spread across
Europe, never lost his love for his native land.
   But reports that he hampered U.S. efforts to stiffen controls on
strategic exchanges have not been substantiated. And a former U.S.
ambassador cautioned against exaggerating Bloch's contacts with CIA.
   ``In all my time I heard from the CIA only once,'' the ex-envoy
said.
   Perhaps the FBI is engaged in a waiting game with Bloch, who
apparently was first questioned by the FBI on June 22, the day he
was suspended from the State Department.
   James Nolan, who worked for the FBI for 28 years and then headed
the State Department's Office of Foreign Missions until his
retirement last year, said Wednesday that ``it's not uncommon at
all'' for time to pass before an arrest, even when a confession has
been made.
   Confessions can be challenged in court, sometimes successfully.
The delay provides time to gather evidence.
   ``You have to go find a specific classified document he turned
over and someone in the government who will testify in court that
it is classified,'' Nolan said.

<HEAD>Lung Cancer Deaths Have Not Peaked for Women</HEAD>
<HEAD>With PM-Prenatal Diagnosis, Bjt</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Smoking among American men has been dropping
since the early 1950s, but federal researchers say women kept
taking up the habit into the next decade and are now paying the
price with higher rates of lung cancer.
   ``Unless women start quitting in significant numbers, the public
health problem is going to get more significant _ no question about
it,'' said Dr. Edward J. Sondik, a National Cancer Institute
specialist who helped prepare a federal health report on smoking
and cancer.
   The Atlanta-based Centers for Disease Control reported Thursday
that lung cancer deaths increased 15 percent in the United States
between 1979 and 1986, to a rate of about 50 deaths per 100,000
people. More men than women die of lung cancer _ about 74 deaths
per 100,000 for males in 1986, compared to 27 per 100,000 for women.
   But the mortality rate from lung cancer among women is soaring
compared to the rate for men. Between 1979 and 1986, the lung
cancer death rate for women jumped 44 percent, while the rate for
men was up just 7 percent.
   The CDC said male smoking has been on the decline since the
early 1950s, but smoking among women peaked at about 1965. The
recent dropoff in smoking among women _ from 32 percent in 1965 to
27 percent in 1987 studies _ isn't nearly as sharp as the drop in
smoking by men _ from 50 percent to 32 percent.
   ``The men are in a very significant downward trend, while the
women _ a lot of them were taking up smoking (in the 1950s and
'60s),'' Sondik said.
   Statistically, the CDC reported, peaks in smoking seem to be
followed by peaks in lung cancer deaths about 35 years later. More
than eight out of 10 lung cancer deaths are believed to be caused
by smoking.
   ``The burden of lung cancer and other smoking-related chronic
diseases (such as bronchitis and emphysema) will be substantially
higher ... for many decades because of the long latency periods
between exposure to tobacco and onset of these diseases,'' the CDC
said.
   That, the agency said, means the death rate from lung cancer
among women continues to climb, and will do so until the turn of
the century or possibly longer, assuming the 35-year lag between
peak smoking and peak deaths.
   The CDC noted that lung cancer already has passed breast cancer
as the most common cause of cancer death among women.
   While almost half of all Americans who ever took up smoking have
quit, the CDC said, more than 50 million people in the United
States continue to smoke.
   In 1986, the last year statistics are available, 85,050 men died
of lung cancer in the United States, compared to 40,461 women, the
CDC said. Nearly two-thirds of those deaths were people over 65.
   The lung cancer death rates are about the same for white females
and black females _ 27.4 per 100,000 for white women and 26.4 for
black women in 1986. The death rate among males, however, is higher
for blacks, 98.4 to 72.3.
   The highest lung cancer death rate among the states in 1986 was
in Alaska, with 148 such deaths for a rate of 70.5 per 100,000
people. The lowest was in Utah, with 275 such deaths, or a rate of
24.3.

<HEAD>Administration to Fight Back on Clean Air Bill</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LARRY MARGASAK</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Bush administration, after weeks of
absorbing unrelenting criticism on its clean air bill, is taking
the offensive by questioning the motives of its critics.
   The stepped-up defense surfaced Thursday when a top
Environmental Protection Agency official, William Rosenberg,
accused Democratic critics of making ``unfair and totally biased
attacks'' on the bill and of falsely calling the proposal a sellout
to automakers.
   Rosenberg handed out a comparison sheet that said a rival bill
would be far costlier while achieving only marginally more
pollution reduction.
   The competing legislation was sponsored by Rep. Henry A. Waxman,
D-Calif., the most vocal critic of the administration plan. Waxman,
a staunch supporter of environmental groups that have denounced the
Bush proposal, held the first hearing on the administration measure
Monday.
   Rosenberg said the session was scheduled to ``politicize'' the
issue.
   While a number of House Democrats, as well as Senate Majority
Leader George J. Mitchell, D-Maine, have attacked the
administration's bill, it was introduced in the House on Thursday
night with bipartisan support _ 90 Republicans and 57 Democrats.
   Several EPA officials said the final straw that triggered
Rosenberg's heated comments was the Waxman-chaired hearing of the
House Energy and Commerce environment subcommittee.
   For five hours, EPA administrator William Reilly, a career
environmentalist, and Rosenberg, the EPA's assistant administrator
for air, sat at the witness table while Waxman and other Democrats
excoriated the bill.
   Waxman even produced an ``auto lobbyists' scorecard'' to
emphasize his contention that the legislation won't reduce auto
emissions.
   Singled out was a provision to allow automakers to average
pollution emissions by an engine category instead of forcing each
vehicle to meet new anti-pollution requirements _ a ``red
herring,'' Rosenberg said Thursday.
   Committee Democrats complained about the exclusion of controls
on toxic chemicals emitted by cars, trucks and small industries,
and about the consideration of economic factors in determining the
health threat from toxic emissions. They also contended that the
bill failed to protect national parks.
   ``The reaction when we walked out was, `The stuff being said was
unfair, much of it was inaccurate, and we weren't given the chance
to get a word in edgewise,''' said EPA spokesman David Cohen.
   The agency's chief lobbyist, Patrick Quinn, said Reilly ``had
not been in a hearing with that level of antagonism. Reilly's
life's work has been as an environmental professional, and to sit
there and have such distortions and verbal badgering ... doesn't
sit well in a lot of people's stomachs.''
   Cohen said no formal strategy for aggressiveness was devised
after the meeting, but other EPA officials said a number of
staffers decided it was time to respond better to the criticism.
   Waxman said the hearing was fair and ``highlighted the
differences that we have for controlling emissions from cars and
trucks.'' He praised Reilly for doing ``as good a job as he could,
putting a good face on a bill that could actually increase
emissions for motor vehicles.''
   Rosenberg chose to make his comments at a news conference that
had been scheduled to release EPA figures on ozone and carbon
monoxide pollution. He immediately ripped into the critics.
   Asked by a reporter ``Why should we trust you?'' Rosenberg
replied, ``The issue is, why you should trust the critics?''

<TEXT>
   The seaside resort that once looked
to Mayor James L. Usry to end a legacy of corruption has seen him
and 13 others charged in conspiracies that include bribes, illegal
gifts and extortion.
   The City Council president and zoning board chairman also were
among those arrested on corruption charges Thursday after an
eight-month state investigation. A 14th person has not yet been
arrested.
   ``We've been the laughingstock of the country for a long time,''
said Republican Assemblywoman Dolores Cooper, who lost the last
non-partisan mayoral election to Usry. ``This sets us back another
decade.''
   Usry, president of the National Conference of Black Mayors, was
elected Atlantic City mayor five years ago as a reformist candidate
after his predecessor was implicated in an influence-peddling
scandal and lost a recall election.
   The 67-year-old Republican mayor is charged with bribery,
conspiracy, official misconduct and accepting unlawful gifts.
   A criminal complaint against the 14 people alleged five
overlapping conspiracies, including an attempt to gain control of a
lucrative Boardwalk electric cart business and a gift shop
franchise at the Atlantic City International Airport. The carts are
used by tourists to travel the Boardwalk.
   State police Superintendent Col. Clinton L. Pagano said the
complaints ``charge that the regulation of economic activity in
Atlantic City, as administered by those arrested, has been up for
sale.''
   State Attorney General Peter Perretti Jr. said none of the
investigations involved the casino industry.
   The mayor said nothing in court during a bail hearing. Usry and
the other city officials were released on their own recognizance.
   Attorneys from the state Division of Criminal Justice are
expected to present a case to a state grand jury within several
weeks. Usry and the others do not have to forfeit their public
offices on the basis of a criminal complaint, Perretti said.
   In a search of Usry's home on Thursday, police confiscated
$6,000 in cash, alleged to be conspiracy money, Pagano said.
   Usry is in his second term as mayor. He won his first term on
May 13, 1984. His predecessor, Michael Matthews, was ousted in a
recall election. Matthews was found guilty in an influence-peddling
scheme involving casino-zoned land, and and was sentenced to a
15-year prison term for extortion.
   Usry was swept into office with help from disgruntled white
voters and the city's large black population. He was considered an
ally of Gov. Thomas H. Kean.
   According to the attorney general, the arrests resulted from an
investigation that began in November, prompted by a complaint by
Atlantic City businessman Albert Black. Black said some city
officials had demanded a bribe from him to get a business proposal
approved by the zoning board.
   The initial investigation involved bribery and influence
peddling by some members of the City Council and zoning board,
officials said. That probe led to investigations against the mayor
and others on similar charges.
   The others arrested Thursday included Walter Collette, 61, City
Council president; Kaleem Shabazz, 52, chairman of the Atlantic
City zoning board; Lillian Bryant, 45, an Atlantic County
freeholder; Gene Dorn, 47, councilman; Arnold Orsatti Jr., 46,
chairman of the Atlantic City council's transportation committee;
and Sylvetta Pilgrim, 44, an administrative assistant with the city
landlord-tenant affairs board.
   Also charged were: W. Oscar Harris Jr., 46, former director of
the Atlantic City Housing Authority; Harold Mosee, 47, former
councilman and an aide to Collette; Robert McCurdy, 46, a former
business partner of Harris; Jack Wolf, 57, a business consultant;
Ernest English, 32, a local businessman; and Clarence Gillard, no
age or occupation available.
   The 14th person, Barbara Woodall, was out of the state Thursday.
The 49-year-old candidate for Atlantic County freeholder faces
charges of campaign contribution violations and conspiracy.
   Black, a lifetime resident of the Atlantic City area and the
manager of a local Wells Fargo security agency, said he filed the
complaint that started the probe because he wanted to give the
casinos a chance to restore the city of his youth to something more
than glitzy gaming halls ringed by poverty.
   ``I would like Atlantic City to be a respected town _ not for
people to say there's a bunch of scumbums here,'' he said.

with 14 grafs to include past denials by Obeid to being Hezbollah leader,
background on relationship with group; no pickup</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Israeli commandos kidnapped Sheik Abdul
Karim Obeid, Iran's closest ally in south Lebanon, early Friday and
killed a neighbor who rushed to his rescue, Lebanese authorities
said.
   Police said Obeid, 29, a Shiite Moslem, was kidnapped from his
second-floor apartment in the village of Jibchit, 20 miles north of
the border with Israel. Israel radio identified Obeid as a leader
in the Hezbollah movement, but he had repeatedly denied links with
the pro-Iranian extremist group.
   A police spokesman said an Israeli helicopter landed the force
about two miles west of Jibchit early Friday.
   He said 12 commandos walked into Jibchit and ``encircled Sheik
Obeid's three-story building on the eastern edge of the village.''
   The spokesman, who cannot be named in line with police rules,
said ``someone with the Israelis spoke Arabic. They knocked on the
door and someone from the sheik's family opened.
   ``The Israelis quickly moved in, pointing silencer-equipped
pistols at the sheik, his cousin Ahmed Obeid and Majid Fahs, a
friend who was staying with them,'' the spokesman said. He said the
commandos tied up the sheik's wife.
   As the Israeli force was leaving the apartment, a neighbor,
Hussein Abu Zeid, ``apparently heard some noise and opened his door
to find out what was happening. They shot him in the head and he
died instantly,'' the spokesman added.
   He said it was Abu Zeid's family that notified the mainstream
Shiite Amal militia, in charge of security in Jibchit, of what
happened.
   Residents of the community of 18,000 people, reached by
telephone, said Amal mobilized its militia in the region in an
effort to confront the Israeli force and rescue Obeid, but it was
too late.
   One resident, speaking on condition of anonymity, said local
Amal leaders urged ``whoever is capable of carrying weapons to join
a campaign in search of Sheik Obeid.''
   ``I heard the helicopter flying as the general mobilization call
was blared through mosque minarets in Jibchit and the neighboring
villages,'' the resident said.
   The captives were taken to Israel, said Israel radio, quoting
Lebanese reports.
   Sheik Obeid, widely reputed to be the spiritual guide of
Hezbollah in south Lebanon, has been the Jibchit's imam, or local
religious leader, since 1984.
   Obeid negotiated the safe withdrawal of Hezbollah gunmen and
Iranian Revolutionary Guards from Jibchit when the town was
besieged by Amal during a crackdown on the Shiite zealots in 1988.
   Hezbollah, or Party of God, seeks an Iranian-style Islamic
republic in Lebanon. Activists of the party have carried out
suicide bombings against U.S., French and Israeli forces in
Lebanon, killing hundreds.
   Hezbollah is believed to be the umbrella for extremist Shiite
factions who hold most of the 17 foreign hostages in Lebanon, nine
of them Americans.

<HEAD>Impeachment Trial Witness Refuses to Testify in Hastings Case</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Senators are threatening action that could
lead to jail for a disbarred lawyer who refuses to answer questions
in the impeachment trial of federal Judge Alcee L. Hastings.
   ``If you continue to refuse to testify, I believe this committee
will take steps that will force your incarceration,'' Sen. Joe
Lieberman, D-Conn., told William Borders on Thursday.
   Hastings, 52, a U.S. District Court judge in Miami, was
impeached by the House last August and is on trial in the Senate.
   Conviction by the Senate on charges of plotting to get a
$150,000 payoff, perjury and improper disclosure of wiretap
information would mean the loss of his judicial post and $89,500
salary.
   A federal court jury acquitted him in 1983 of criminal charges
of conspiracy to obtain a bribe.
   Borders, a law school classmate of Hastings' and once a
political power in Washington, was imprisoned after being convicted
on the charges in a separate trial. He was arrested in October 1981
as he drove out of a suburban Virginia motel with a cash-stuffed
garment bag and an undercover FBI agent by his side.
   Flanked by two attorneys, Borders angrily described for the
12-member Senate panel hearing evidence how he had ``lost my former
livelihood'' as a result of the case and been accorded ``harassing
and somewhat contemptible'' treatment by federal authorities.
   He refused to answer questions, saying that to do so would
violate his right against self-incrimination under the Fifth
Amendment to the Constitution as well as his rights under five
other amendments.
   He asked to ``finally be left alone to pursue the speck of
happiness that was left to me.''
   ``I respectfully refuse to answer any and all questions,'' he
said.
   Lawmakers threatened to cite Borders for civil contempt because
of his refusal. Jailing him would require action by the full Senate
and court approval. Senators warned there was no assurance that he
would not face only a civil contempt citation but charges of
criminal contempt.
   Senators said there was still time for him to extricate himself
by testifying, if necessary in a deposition witnessed by at least
one senator while lawmakers are on their August recess.
   At the hearings, the senators have heard tapes of FBI undercover
agent H. Paul Rico posing as a racketeer who wanted to have his
three-year sentence and a similar term imposed by Hastings on his
brother changed to probation.
   On the tapes, Borders is heard to say that he could get Hastings
to make such a change and even persuade the judge to return
$845,000 that had been forfeited to the government.
   Hastings says Borders, a longtime friend, was a ``rainmaker''
who was using his name to obtain payoffs. Hastings says he had
nothing to do with the scheme.

<HEAD>Senate OKs $225 Million for Atom Smasher, Increases Food Spending</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ALAN FRAM</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Senate continues its rush to finish major
portions of its budget work as it nears the recess wire, deciding
to provide the first federal funds for building a giant atom
smasher in Texas.
   On a voice vote Thursday, lawmakers approved an $18.4 billion
bill for fiscal 1990 energy and water projects that contains $225
million for the superconducting supercollider, the $4.4 billion
research facility planned for Waxahachie, Texas.
   Final passage was delayed by a futile attempt _ that lasted
hours _ by opponents of the Medicare catastrophic care program to
delay the surtax many of the nation's senior citizens will have to
pay to finance the initiative.
   Earlier in the day, the Senate approved a separate $44.3 billion
agriculture bill that boosts spending on domestic food aid programs
and pressures the government to tighten its requirements for food
labels.
   Both Houses of Congress have approved three of the 13
appropriations bills for fiscal 1990 needed annually to finance
federal agencies. But the two chambers still must agree to
compromise versions of the three measures before sending them to
President Bush for his signature.
   Fiscal 1990 begins Oct. 1, but lawmakers are scheduled to begin
their four-week summer recess Aug. 5.
   In its energy legislation, the Senate provided $135 million to
begin construction of the 53-mile-long, doughnut-shaped
supercollider and $90 million for research and development.
   The underground facility would be the world's largest particle
accelerator, capable of throwing two proton beams at each other at
nearly the speed of light. Scientists say their research could help
them learn about nature's most basic building blocks.
   The project, expected to take five to seven years to complete,
would create an anticipated 3,500 construction jobs and 2,500
permanent jobs. It would be built 25 miles south of Dallas.
   The bill also contains $4.2 billion for water projects; $9.6
billion for nuclear weapons programs, and $350 million to study a
potential high-level nuclear waste storage site in Yucca Mountain,
Nev.
   Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., was defeated 58-40 when he offered an
amendment that would have delayed the Medicare surtax for a year.
   But the issue will persist. The House Ways and Means Committee
has already voted to cut the levy in half, and White House budget
director Richard Darman told reporters Thursday that the
administration was ``in the process of compromising'' on rolling
back the program.
   The agriculture legislation would expand federal spending for an
assortment of domestic food assistance programs to $18.8 billion,
$1.5 billion more than Bush sought in the budget he sent Congress
in February and $2 billion above 1989 levels.
   This includes $4.9 billion for child nutrition programs, about
the same as Bush's request; $2.1 billion for food aid to women,
infants and children, $200 million above Bush's figure; and $15.4
billion for food stamps, $1.3 billion above the Bush number.
   A report approved with the bill also directs the Food and Drug
Administration to ``move forward'' with clarifying the meanings of
``natural,'' ``low-fat,'' ``lite,'' and other terms food producers
commonly place on their labels.
   However, the report did not address the controversy over red dye
No. 3, the food coloring that is considered a potential carcinogen.
In its measure, the House ordered the government to refrain from
banning the food coloring until long-range studies of its health
effects are completed.
   Report language is not legally binding. Agencies must take such
commands seriously, however, or risk antagonizing lawmakers who can
retaliate against offending bureaucrats in future bills.

   The Internal Revenue Service commissioner says
he'll look into allegations by an Arkansas legislator that the IRS
blocked congressional and police efforts to investigate an alleged
drugs-for-arms operation.
   Rep. Bill Alexander, D-Ark., said Thursday that two House
subcommittees, the Arkansas State Police and the General Accounting
Office have been investigating possible violations at the Mena,
Ark., Airport, where cargo planes apparently left for Central
America with arms and returned with drugs.
   ``This investigation led us to the IRS about a year ago,''
Alexander said during House Government Operations subcommittee
hearings on alleged corruption at the IRS.
   Alexander's comments came during questioning of newly appointed
IRS Commissioner Fred Goldberg, former Commissioner Larry Gibbs,
Senior Deputy Commissioner Michael Murphy and other IRS officials.
   Alexander said Congress and the state police wanted access to
William Duncan, then an agent for the IRS Criminal Investigative
Division, who was investigating a money laundering scheme connected
to the overall narcotics trafficking probe.
   But, Alexander said, the IRS would not cooperate, citing privacy
restrictions.
   ``The effect of the failure of your cooperation has been to let
the statute of limitations run out on drug traffickers,'' Alexander
said to the IRS officials.
   Goldberg said he would personally look into the matter.
   ``I will make it crystal clear to all our employees that they
will cooperate to the fullest extent of the law'' with you, he said.
   Duncan was investigating the activities of the late Barry Seal,
a convicted drug smuggler turned government informant, who operated
out of the Mena Airport from 1984 until he was slain in February
1986 at Baton Rouge, La., the Arkansas Gazette reported Thursday.
   Alexander told the Gazette that Duncan was under orders from
then-Attorney General Edwin Meese's office in Washington to
withhold evidence in federal grand jury proceedings that examined
activities at the Mena Airport.
   Alexander said it was only through Duncan's resignation from the
IRS that any information became available.
   Duncan, who testified earlier Thursday, said he resigned after
17 years with the IRS because he was advised by an IRS attorney to
lie to Congress about the investigation.
   The subcommittee heard three days of testimony from
investigators and present and former IRS employees who described
threats, intimidation and retaliation against IRS workers who
reported wrongdoing by superiors.
   Committee Chairman Doug Barnard, D-Ga., in a sometimes heated
exchange with Murphy, harshly criticized the agency Thursday.
   ``The IRS world that you describe, where wrongdoers are
systematically punished and where whistle blowers are cherished, is
a world I don't recognize, not from our investigation,'' Barnard
said.
   ``It's the Land of Oz and you are the wizards,'' he bellowed,
nearly rising from his chair.
   Barnard blew up at Murphy when he said the IRS had ``cooperated
fully'' with the subcommittee and that misdeeds that were exposed
were ``isolated instances.''
   Barnard said the agency was not cooperative and suggested the
law should be changed to allow other congressional committees with
oversight over the agency access to records.
   Only Ways and Means, Senate Finance and the Joint Committee on
Taxation now may see taxpayer files without the individual
taxpayers' permission.

   The House apparently will begin its August
recess without voting on a Democratic-backed statute designed to
overcome the Supreme Court ruling that allows flag burning.
   The House Judiciary Committee approved the flag-protection bill
on Thursday, 28-6, with Republican support. But the GOP turned
around and made parliamentary objections that blocked Speaker
Thomas S. Foley's plan to bring the bill to the full House next
week.
   Foley, D-Wash., told reporters he would bring the bill to the
floor in September.
   But the lack of full House action before the Aug. 5 recess hurts
the Democrats' strategy of making their argument to the public that
Congress should pursue a statute before any constitutional
amendment.
   The bill includes penalties of up to a year in prison plus an
unspecified fine for physically desecrating a flag, and it was
drafted to address the high court's decision that existing statutes
against flag burning were an attempt to squelch free speech.
   ``It protects the flag and it protects the Constitution,'' said
Rep. Steny Hoyer, D-Md., chairman of the House Democratic Caucus.
   Republicans insist that only a constitutional amendment can
overcome the Supreme Court ruling that flag burning was a protected
form of free speech.
   House Majority Leader Richard Gephardt, D-Mo., said GOP refusal
to try a statute before a constitutional amendment showed that the
Republicans were mostly interested in partisan advantage.
   ``The people who pose as the most vigilant supporters of flag
protection ... seem more interested in adding political graffiti to
the Constitution than in protecting the physical integrity of the
American flag,'' he said.
   House Minority Leader Bob Michel, R-Ill., told reporters that
Bush's chief of staff, John Sununu, urged Republican leaders at a
White House meeting Tuesday to push the flag amendment because it's
a ``wedge issue'' _ one that divides and injures the Democratic
Party.
   Although to protect themselves politically they're voting for
the statute also _ 12-1 in the Judiciary Committee _ Republicans
ridicule the Democrats for pursuing it.
   ``This bill is essentially useless,'' said Rep. Carlos Moorhead,
R-Calif., who voted for it in committee along with 12 of 13 voting
Republicans.
   ``It's obviously going to get a try. And I may end up voting for
it,'' Michel said, but said it would be ``a meaningless vote.''
   Democratic leaders Thursday defended their position at a news
conference, toting along with them the flag that flew over the
Capitol on the day Pearl Harbor was attacked by the Japanese. The
flag saw service in the European theater and then flew on the
U.S.S. Missouri when the Japanese surrendered in 1945.
   Judiciary Committee chairman Jack Brooks, a decorated Marine in
World War II, said he would sponsor a constitutional amendment if
the statute didn't work, but said it would be foolish not to try. A
statute could be passed far quicker than an amendment, which
requires ratification of the states, said Brooks, D-Texas.

   After spending years in Ronald Reagan's
shadow, George Bush is getting upstaged at the White House by
another actor.
   Robert Redford dropped by Thursday to discuss environmental
issues, causing staffers accustomed to seeing high-powered people
to crane their necks for a glimpse of the blond superstar.
   Redford came to the Capitol on Wednesday to confer with House
Speaker Thomas Foley about his efforts to obtain U.S. permission to
go to Cuba to work on a movie. Rep. Robert Dornan, R-Calif., a
one-time neighbor of the actor in Santa Monica, agreed to help.
   Dornan, Redford in tow, burst into the room where Vice President
Dan Quayle was meeting with some members of Congress. Some say
Quayle resembles Redford.
   When Quayle asked what Redford was doing there, the actor
quipped, ``I'm looking for a double.''
   President Bush saw Dornan at a dinner Wednesday night and asked
why he hadn't brought the actor to the White House.
   As a result, Bush and Redford spent 40 minutes together
Thursday, discussing environmental matters, Dornan said. The actor
has devoted much effort to a Utah institute he founded that works
toward mediation of environmental disputes.
   ``Within a few minutes they were like old friends,'' although no
specific projects were agreed to, Dornan said.
   Redford, who campaigned for Democratic presidential candidate
Michael Dukakis last year, won no commitments on his bid to go to
Cuba, Dornan said.

<HEAD>Conviction Doesn't End Mystery of Premier's Slaying</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ARTHUR MAX</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The conviction of Christer Pettersson
for the 1986 killing of Prime Minister Olof Palme is not likely to
lift the aura of mystery that surrounds one of Sweden's most
infamous crimes.
   Pettersson, a 42-year-old social misfit with a long record of
crime, drunkenness and drug abuse, was sentenced Thursday to life
imprisonment.
   But the Palme file still has plenty of blank pages for advocates
of conspiracy theories. It promises to become Sweden's equivalent
to the 1963 assassination of President John F. Kennedy.
   Palme, a dynamic four-term premier and Sweden's leading
political figure for two decades, was shot as he walked home with
his wife, Lisbeth, from a downtown movie theater on Feb. 28, 1986.
   The two professional judges on the jury voted to acquit
Pettersson for lack of evidence, but they were overruled by the six
lay jurors.
   In a 46-page verdict, the jury pinned its judgement on Mrs.
Palme's identification of Pettersson. She said she saw him standing
15 feet away just after her husband crumpled to the street.
   ``The way she identified him at the trial is, according to the
court, very convincing,'' the judgement said.
   It cited other witnesses who saw Pettersson waiting for the
Palme couple and following them. This testimony ``supported Lisbeth
Palme's identification to such a degree that the court finds it
without reasonable doubt that he fired the two shots.''
   The two dissenting judges noted that the murder weapon, a .357
Magnum revolver, was never found, and no physical evidence surfaced
to link Pettersson to the shooting. No one swore to seeing him fire
a weapon.
   ``The factor of uncertainty is so prominent that we can't vote
to convict,'' said Judge Michael af Geijerstam.
   ``It's evident that the verdict hinged on the relative
subjectivity of the jurors,'' as opposed to the legal approach of
the judges, said Anders Stening, a lawyer, in a television debate.
   The motive is the biggest unanswered question in the case. Why
would Pettersson kill Palme?
   The written judgement ignored the issue. During the five-week
trial the prosecution intimated that Pettersson simply hated all
authority. Pettersson, who maintained his innocence, claimed to be
an admirer of Palme.
   Why did no one claim the $8 million reward?
   Since Pettersson was arrested Dec. 14, news reports have
questioned whether Pettersson, a heavy drinker and user of
amphetamines, could have kept his mouth shut about the killing.
   ``Doubts will continue to gnaw, because Pettersson doesn't fit
the picture of the killer of a prime minister,'' said Ulla
Bondeson, a criminologist from Malmo. ``No official investigation
can ever kill the speculation,'' she said.
   ``This verdict is the worst possible conclusion. The national
trauma will continue,'' said political commentator Yrsa Stenius.
``There is no motive, no logical chain of events leading up to the
incident.''
   Palme's international stature and involvement in disarmament
issues gave rise to theories of international intrigue.
   Investigators focused on possible conspiracies during the first
year. Most centered on militant Kurdish exiles, angered at a
crackdown by Palme's social democratic government.
   The Iranian regime of Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini and the Iraqi
secret service were among others suspected. Those theories were
eventually dismissed as groundless, but speculation is bound to
haunt the case.
   Four hours before Palme was shot, the files on a tax
investigation against him disappeared in a break-in at the county
administrative appeals court.
   All computer files were obliterated and all documents stolen. No
connection with the murder was ever established.
   Among many initial lines of inquiry later dropped were accounts
that Palme was followed by men with walkie-talkies. These reports
led to speculation of a right-wing plot by policemen against the
leftist premier.
   Several Stockholm policemen were questioned and released well
before the arrest of Pettersson.

<HEAD>Elks Say No to Women; Yes to Rule That Could Bring in More Blacks</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The Elks is still a ``men-only''
organization, but in the future more of those men may be non-white.
   Members voted against admitting women and for doing away with
the Elk's ``blackball rule'' at a closed business meeting Thursday
on the final day of the Benevolent and Protective Order of Elks
125th annual convention.
   Repeal of the blackball rule was approved at the urging of the
Elks Lodge at Lompoc, Calif. Two black applicants there were
blackballed recently, and as a result the California Attorney
General's Office is investigating possible civil rights violations.
   The old policy allowed any three members of an Elks lodge to
reject, or ``blackball'' a prospective member. Some said that made
it difficult for blacks to join the Elks.
   Under the new policy, a two-thirds majority of a lodge's
membership could approve a new member.
   ``I think it was a step forward. It was a rule that has caused
problems for a number of lodges. I think everyone felt it was time
to change,'' said William Wodarczak, the exalted ruler of the
1,800-member Santa Barbara lodge.
   In Lompoc, about 35 miles northwest of Santa Barbara, two black
men whose membership bids were rejected said they planned to
reapply.
   ``I'm elated at the outcome,'' said Ernie Hutchinson, 57, a
local housing official. ``I'm proud of the lodge here because they
spearheaded this thing.''
   Hutchinson said he plans to reapply immediately. Should he be
accepted, ``I don't think there will be a strain. I am not going in
with any animosity.''
   Joe Martin, 56, also said he was pleased by the vote.
   ``I am a bit surprised, though, but it restores my faith in
America,'' said Martin, a real estate agent.
   While the Elks do have some black members nationally, several
California lodges threatened legal action if rules were not changed
to allow more minority representation in the group's 2,300 lodges.
   Members also voted overwhelmingly against the resolution to
admit women, said Donald D. Dapelo, the newly installed grand
exalted ruler.
   Sexism was not behind the rejection of female membership, Dapelo
said.
   ``I think perhaps it could also be considered that the Elks are
interested in protecting the rights of women to have their own
organization just like we have,'' Dapelo said. ``And there are
twice as many of those, so I am told.''
   Elks boast a nationwide membership of roughly 1.5 million, but
membership has been declining and those who wanted to admit women
said that might remedy the problem.
   Dapelo disagreed.
   ``It's a fact that we don't see too many of our members standing
in line to join those ladies' organizations either.''
   An estimated 12,000 people attended the convention.

   The licenses of two Las Vegas slot
machine companies were suspended after gaming authorities found
evidence that keno and video poker games were rigged to prevent
players from hitting jackpots.
   The alleged slot-rigging involved American Coin Enterprises and
American Coin Machine Co.
   The Nevada Gaming Commission voted Thursday to temporarily
suspend more than 30 licenses held by the two companies after
getting an emergency request Wednesday from its enforcement arm,
the state Gaming Control Board.
   The principals in the companies are Rudolph LaVecchia and Frank
Romano. LaVecchia's son, also named Rudolph, is a principal in
American Coin Enterprises. All are from Las Vegas.
   A woman who answered the telephone at American Coin Machine said
only, ``We don't have any comment right now.'' At American Coin
Enterprises, a woman also declined to comment and said the
LaVecchias and Romano were not available.
   The companies have electronic games at 94 locations, mainly bars
and taverns in the Las Vegas area. Gaming Control Board agents
began seizing machines on Wednesday, and continued the roundup on
Thursday.
   Commission Chairman John O'Reilly said the Control Board's
allegations ``are extremely serious'' and warranted the license
suspension pending further review.
   Control Board Chairman Bill Bible said his agents found evidence
that the machines had been altered in a manner that ``cheats the
players'' by altering the odds of hitting a jackpot.
   Board agents said the changes prevent players from hitting a
high-paying royal flush on the companies' video poker machine, and
also prevent a big keno payoff.
   The Control Board released an affidavit from agent Ron Harris
saying an investigation started in June after the board got
information that slots had unapproved computer chips, or eproms,
which determine how the devices operate.
   The American Coin machines were sealed July 14 and unsealed only
after the computer chips were replaced in all the machines, the
board said.
   But the Control Board said further investigation this week by
its lab technicians and agents revealed more unapproved features in
the slot machines ``which the board determined to be cheating
devices.''
   Asked whether there was any evidence of complicity on the part
of bar or tavern owners who got machines from the companies, Bible
said, ``It is an ongoing part of this investigation.''
   American Coin Enterprises and American Coin Machine Co. hold
licenses as slot route operators, manufacturers and distributors of
slot machines.

<TEXT>
   The arrest of a leading Communist
figure has been hailed as a major blow to the rebels. But the
insurgency that has persisted for two decades has weathered the
capture of other key figures.
   Satur Ocampo, 50, a member of the Communist Party's central
committee, was arrested Thursday in a Manila suburb with his
common-law wife, Carolina Malay.
   `His arrest will hit the party quite hard because of his
position in the movement,'' said military Chief of Staff Gen.
Renato de Villa.
   Maj. Gen. Ramon Montano, chief of the Philippine Constabulary,
said the arrest was ``the beginning of the end'' of Southeast
Asia's last major communist insurgency.
   But in an editorial Friday, the independent Philippine Daily
Globe said, ``We have had days like this before. ...Despite all the
hoopla, the insurgency simply moved on, renewing itself and
becoming more resilient than ever.''
   A leftist human rights group also expressed concern that
Ocampo's arrest diminished chances for resuming peace talks to end
the 20-year insurgency.
   ``Most likely, the leadership will go deeper underground and
might answer the military operations with counter-military
actions,'' the Ecumenical Movement for Justice and Peace said.
``Peace will be as elusive as ever.''
   Ocampo's arrest follows claims by the military that the rebels
are in disarray because of leadership differences. The rebels
gained strength during the authoritarian rule of ousted President
Ferdinand Marcos but have not found a formula for promoting their
cause under the more popular administration of President Corazon
Aquino.
   About 10 members of the Central Committee have been arrested
since 1987 although one of them, Romulo Kintanar, escaped. The
military claims the party's armed wing, the New People's Army, has
declined by about 8 percent to about 23,500 fighters, only half of
whom are fully armed.
   During a press conference shortly after his arrest, Ocampo
insisted that his capture will make little difference.
   ``The organization is a big one,'' he said. ``There is a long,
wide bench with responsible comrades who would take over.''
   Such bravado was to be expected. But the rebellion has persisted
despite past arrests of its leaders and despite improvements in the
economy under Mrs. Aquino.
   The party grew after its founder, Jose Maria Sison, and the New
Peoples Army commander, Bernabe Buscayno, were arrested in 1976.
They were released in 1986 after Mrs. Aquino took power.
   Those arrested since Mrs. Aquino took office include
Secretary-General Rafael Baylosis and Chairman Rodolfo Salas.
   ``We should not be lulled into complacency,'' said Senate
President Jovito Salonga. ``They seem to have replacements for
captured leaders.''
   The party's base remains the impoverished rural areas, where 70
percent of the 58 million Filipinos live. The government admits
that the poorest third of all Filipinos still control only 9
percent of the national income, virtually no change from the final
years of Marcos' administration.
   But Ocampo's capture was a propaganda coup because he was one of
the few rebels widely known by the public. But it is unclear how
much influence Ocampo wielded on rebel policy or in the New Peoples
Army.
   During a 60-day cease-fire, declared in December 1986, Ocampo
and Malay appeared on numerous radio and television shows, urging
the government to accept their demands to end the fighting.
   After the cease-fire ended, Ocampo gave clandestine interviews
and issued statements in the name of the party. He was believed in
charge of recruiting among youth, teachers, clerics, farmers and
other groups.
   At the time of their arrest, Ocampo and Malay were living a
block from the Makati police station.
   The anonymous nature of the rebel leadership has been one of its
strengths. Philippine politics revolves around personalities. But
the Communists have no charismatic figures whose arrests would
shatter the movement.
   National Security Adviser Rafael Ileto admits the military is
not even sure who runs the party. The military has variously named
Sison, who lives in the Netherlands, Kintanar, and Benito Tiamzon
as party chairman.
   Unlike Communist rebellions in Thailand, Vietnam and elsewhere
in the region, Filipino rebels are not openly supported by any
foreign government. China and the Soviet Union have both assured
Mrs. Aquino of their support for her.
   But the party's ability to survive without foreign support also
shows the resilience of the communist movement, which dates back to
1930.

   Federal prosecutors have conceded defeat in
the government's effort to prosecute six people charged with
capturing or killing wild horses and burros in rural Nevada.
   ``We underestimated the difficulty of proving these cases,''
Bill Maddox, the U.S. attorney for Nevada, said Thursday by
telephone from his Las Vegas office. ``We didn't do a very good
job.''
   On Wednesday, U.S. District Judge Howard McKibben gave Maddox
permission to drop charges against the two remaining defendants in
a much-publicized case that grew from the suspected slaughter of
some 600 mustangs in central Nevada.
   Dave Morehead and Shannon Brennan were scheduled to go on trial
Aug. 8.
   ``I just took a very critical look at the case and, in my
opinion, we would have had a very difficult time proving their
guilt beyond a reasonable doubt,'' Maddox explained. ``This type of
case needs to be handled like a homicide. And with the information
we had that was too difficult.''
   Don Hill, an attorney representing Morehead, said the government
would have been wasting the court's time to go forward and
commended Maddox for ``having the courage to admit there wasn't
enough evidence.''
   Morehead, 38, a foreman at the C-Punch Ranch 70 miles north of
Lovelock, and ranchhand Brennan, 21, were charged with killing
about 40 horses and burros. The charges are misdemeanor violations
of the federal Wild, Free Roaming Horse and Burro Protection Act.
   The two were riding the range Thursday and could not be reached
for comment. But Dave Morehead's wife said they were relieved.
   ``We were hoping they'd drop charges a long time ago because
they never had anything to begin with,'' Vina Morehead said in a
telephone interview from her north-central Nevada home.
   ``It's been the worst time of our lives. It's just thrown us
into a tizzy. ... He should never have been charged in the first
place.''
   The original indictment was issued in January after months of
investigation following the Bureau of Land Management's discovery
of hundreds of dead mustangs over a vast area of north-central
Nevada.
   Bureau investigators believe the wild horses were shot over a
period of about two years, but the condition of many of the
carcasses made it impossible to determine whether they were killed
or died of natural causes.
   Last week, a jury returned an innocent verdict in the case of
Betty Irwin, a 63-year-old California woman who's part owner of the
sprawling C-Punch Ranch.
   Jury members said there wasn't enough evidence to convict her of
misdeameanor charges of attempting to convert a wild burro into a
pet.
   Nearly a month ago, U.S. District Judge Edward Reed dismissed
charges against cousins Eugene ``Skeeter'' Thacker, a 27-year-old
cowboy, and Ronald Hage, a 23-year-old miner. Reed said the
government didn't specify exactly which five horses the pair
allegedly killed.
   Assistant U.S. Attorney Will Mattley earlier dropped charges
against a sixth defendant when the accused proved he wasn't in
Nevada at the time he allegedly killed mustangs.

<HEAD>Wealthiest Taxpayers Are Biggest Cheats, Study Says</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   If the federal government had the staff to
audit upper-income Americans, it could collect billions of dollars
in unpaid taxes, says a study sponsored by a Democratic group.
   People who earn more than $50,000 a year, 12 percent of all
taxpayers, owed 40 percent of the $72.5 billion in taxes owed to
the government in 1985 but not collected, said the study, which was
based on data from the Internal Revenue Service.
   The top 3 percent of taxpayers, consisting of those who earn
more than $100,000 a year, accounted for 26 percent of the unpaid
taxes, said the study financed by Leadership for the New Century, a
group of progressive Democrats.
   The study was based on detailed audits of 50,000 to 60,000
Americans that the IRS conducts every three years to determine how
well taxpayers are complying with the law.
   People who earn less than $25,000 a year, 62 percent of all
taxpayers, owed 30 percent of the government's uncollected taxes in
1985, the study said. Taxpayers who make $25,000 to $50,000 a year
accounted for 31 percent of the unpaid taxes.

   A national service bill that blends several
Democratic proposals should be on its way to the floor next week,
senators say.
   Sen. Edward Kennedy, D-Mass., chairman of the Senate Labor and
Human Resources Committee, said Thursday at least 10 national
service bills ranging in cost from $5 million to $5 billion have
been introduced this year in the Senate.
   The compromise plan is designed to promote public service among
Americans of all ages, Kennedy said. Incentives include academic
credit, stipends, job training, educational aid and assistance for
first-time home buyers.
   Kennedy said his committee is scheduled to complete work on the
bill next week in preparation for floor action after the August
recess.
   Kennedy and Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell, D-Maine,
said they hope to achieve a bipartisan measure with Bush
administration support.
   Bush favors a purely voluntary approach to such service without
incentives or stipends and has proposed a $25 million program to
encourage such efforts.

<NOTE>CIA Opened Station at Costa Rica's Request</NOTE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The CIA helped set up a communications station
in Costa Rica at that Central American country's request and
developed a program dealing with Nicaraguan nationals, according to
a court filing by Iran-Contra prosecutors.
   The document, filed Thursday in the criminal case against a
former CIA station chief, demonstrates the spy agency's efforts to
help prepare Costa Rica for a possible invasion by the leftist
government of Nicaragua starting in late 1984.
   The Costa Rican government asked the United States for help,
says the court document filed by prosecutors from the office of
independent counsel Lawrence Walsh.
   A program to assist and improve the effectiveness of Costa
Rica's defense forces was initiated as a result of the request, the
court document said.
   Costa Rica doesn't have a standing army, but rather a civil and
rural guard of 9,500, including 3,000 reservists.
   Prosecutors had proposed that the summary of information about
the three highly sensitive CIA programs be presented in the trial
of Joseph Fernandez, the agency's former station chief in Costa
Rica. He is charged with lying to the Tower Commission and the CIA
inspector general's office about his help to Oliver North's
resupply network to the Nicaraguan Contras.
   Fernandez says that he must be allowed to introduce greater
detail about the three programs to properly defend himself against
criminal charges. U.S. District Court Judge Claude Hilton in
Alexandria, Va., agreed.
   On Monday, the Justice Department, citing national security
concerns of the CIA, stepped in and obtained a stay of Fernandez's
trial from a U.S. Court of Appeals judge in Richmond, Va.

   Hospital workers are doing too little to protect
themselves from the AIDS virus, even though one in 16
emergency-room patients was found to be infected at a major medical
center last year, a study has found.
   Health workers failed to take adequate precautions, such as
wearing gloves, masks and gowns, 66 percent of the time during a
six-week study period in the emergency room at Johns Hopkins
Hospital in Baltimore, researchers said.
   The failure rate for taking precautions rose to more than 80
percent when patients were bleeding rapidly, said the researchers,
led by Dr. Gabor D. Kelen of the hospital's emergency department.
   Many of the workers _ who included doctors, nurses and
technicians _ said putting on protective gear was too difficult or
time-consuming, or they believed the gear might get in their way,
the researchers said.
   Such responses were made even though it had been reported that
5.2 percent of emergency-room patients at Johns Hopkins were
infected with the AIDS virus in 1987, up to 6 percent by 1988, the
researchers said.
   The AIDS virus is believed to be passed mainly through sexual
intercourse and the sharing of contaminated hypodermic needles
among drug abusers. But health-care workers are in danger of
catching it from needle pricks, blood sprayed to the eyes, nose or
mouth or from getting infected fluids on skin cuts.
   At least 169 health care workers nationwide have become infected
with the virus through contact with patients, according to the
federal Centers for Disease Control in Atlanta.
   Johns Hopkins had tried to educate staffers at all levels about
the need to wear protective clothing, and had displayed 10 highly
visible posters outlining recommended precautions in strategic
areas of the emergency department, researchers said.
   In addition, gloves, masks, gowns and goggles had been placed at
the entrances of rooms where they might be needed, they wrote in
today's Journal of the American Medical Association.
   Still, ``health care workers took inadequate precautions,
particularly in those situations that most called for them,'' the
researchers said.
   Overall, workers donned needed gear 44 percent of the time, they
found, basing data on direct observations.
   In patients with profuse bleeding, the rate fell to 19.5
percent, the researchers said.
   In procedures requiring only gloves _ those that might involve
contact with blood or other body fluids but were unlikely to
involve being sprayed by such fluids _ workers wore gloves 64.8
percent of the time, they found.
   But for procedures requiring gloves, mask, gown and goggles _
those in which a worker might get sprayed with body fluids _ the
rate of wearing adequate gear plummeted to 16.5 percent, the study
found.
   The Johns Hopkins study found 152 infected people among 2,544
patients treated in the emergency room during the research period.
Ninety-five of them showed no signs of infection and didn't know
they were carrying the AIDS virus, researchers said.
   Being infected with the virus does not necessarily mean a person
has acquired immune deficiency syndrome, because the virus can be
present for years before symptoms of the deadly disease begin to
appear.
   The total number of AIDS cases reported since 1979 is 99,936, of
whom 58,014 have died, the CDC says.

   The opening of the Menominee County Fair
centers once again around the Theuerkauf family.
   Last year, fair manager Shirley Charlier began the festival by
handing Carl Theuerkauf a plaque commemorating the centennial of
his family's dairy farm.
   Today, Charlier planned to start the fair with a moment of
silence. Theuerkauf and four family members died one by one
Wednesday as they tried to save each other from suffocating in a
manure storage pit.
   Dead were farm patriarch Carl Theuerkauf Sr., 65; sons Carl Jr.,
37, and Tom, 28; grandson Daniel, 15; and nephew Bill Hofer, 63.
   The elder Theuerkauf would have celebrated his 66th birthday
Saturday, a sheriff's deputy said. Instead, the farmer will be
buried that day.
   The entire county is grieving.
   ``People are devastated,'' said Charlier. ``Somebody asked why
would they do that. I don't know if I could say if one of my
children had fallen in the river if I would use my reason and not
go and help.''
   Menominee County officials believe four of the men died on
missions of mercy.
   ``I'm sure that when one person slipped or fell, out of love and
for help, one after another went in,'' said Richard Breyer with the
county farm extension service. ``It's just something there will not
be an answer as to why it had to be five people.''
   The five men were using a pump to empty the partially covered,
12-foot deep concrete pit Wednesday morning and were almost
finished when the drainage pump clogged.
   Hofer descended into the darkness to clear the blockage. Instead
of air, he breathed methane gas, and collapsed.
   Police can only theorize what happened next, since everyone who
saw the incident died.
   ``It's unknown which one went in next, but eventually they all
went in to save the rest,'' said Menominee County Sheriff's Deputy
Booth Whipp.
   County medical examiner Dr. Paul Haupt estimates it took about
90 seconds for each of the men to collapse and suffocate in the
invisible cloud of gas.
   Methane is an odorless gas that can be generated by animal
waste. The pit collects manure from the dairy barn until it can be
moved to an outdoor pit or loaded into a manure spreader.
   A week of very hot, humid weather likely caused the deadly
methane gas to build up faster than usual, Breyer said.
   Whipp said he believed the Theuerkaufs realized the danger ``but
they were more concerned with their loved ones.''
   A funeral for the four Theuerkaufs will be held at Christ
Evangelical Lutheran Church on Saturday. A service for Hofer will
be held later that same day at Faith Lutheran Church in Marinette.
   Breyer said close to 1,000 area residents helped the Theuerkaufs
celebrate the centennial of their farm last summer. And he said the
elder Theuerkauf was named Michigan Farm Manager of the Year
several years ago. The dairy farm near the Wisconsin line had more
than 250 cows and was one of the largest in Michigan's Upper
Peninsula.
   Former farmhands are pitching in to keep the farm running.
   ``We're all stunned and shocked by it,'' said Harry Theuerkauf,
the elder Theuerkauf's brother, who owns a Milwaukee law firm.
``It's hard to grasp. They all are going to be missed. Everybody
had plans for the fifth generation of Theuerkaufs to take over the
farm. Now things are up in the air.
   ``I wish there was an easy way to cope with this.''

<HEAD>Dollar Holds Steady Against Yen, Stocks Fall</HEAD>

   The dollar rose slightly against the Japanese yen
today, while stock prices on the Tokyo Stock Exchange fell
moderately.
   The dollar closed at 139.45 yen, up 0.10 yen from Thursday's
close of 139.35 yen. After opening marginally lower at 139.30 yen,
the U.S. currency traded between 139.30-139.88 yen.
   The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues, which gained
269.45 points Thursday, shed 79.65 points, or 0.22 percent, to
finish the week at 34,705.63. The market's main index had gained
46.33 points at the end of the morning session.
   ``The dollar moved on a firm tone, though trading as a whole was
thin,'' said Shinichi Kato, a senior dealer with Mitui Bank.
   Investors seeking to put money in the United States bought
dollars despite the moderate decline in U.S. interest rates
following the second-quarter U.S. gross national product report
showing slower-than-expected economic growth, Kato said.
   The U.S. Commerce Department reported Thursday that the nation's
economy grew at a seasonally adjusted rate of 1.7 percent in the
April-June period, down from the previous quarter's revised annual
rate of 3.7 percent.
   Theoretically, lower interest rates tend to make
dollar-denominated investment less attractive.
   On the stock market, the reversal in the Nikkei index's
direction came after the morning session that ended at 34,831.61, a
new high.
   Volume traded on the first section reached 900 million shares,
down from Thursday's 1.39 billion shares.
   ``The market needed a respite,'' said a dealer with Yamaichi
Securities Co., speaking on condition of anonymity.
   There still remains political uncertainty in in the market over
who will be Japan's next prime minister following Monday's
announcement by Prime Minister Sousuke Uno that he will resign to
take responsibility for a major defeat in Sunday's elections for
half the seats of the upper house, the dealer said.
   The governing Liberal Democratic Party has decided to elect
Uno's successor as party president on Aug. 8 at a caucus of party
lawmakers. The party president will will be elected the new prime
minister in a special parliamentary session scheduled for Aug. 10.

   Outgoing U.S. Customs Service Commissioner
William von Raab has accused the federal government of lacking the
commitment to win the war on drugs.
   Von Raab, who is leaving office next week after being forced to
resign his position of eight years, said in a report today in The
New York Times that drug-fighting efforts were not working.
   Senior officials were too preoccupied with other problems,
according to von Raab, who has played a major role in combating
drugs during the Reagan and Bush administrations.
   He said Secretary of State James A. Baker III was worried about
Eastern Europe, Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady only cared
about Third World debt and fixing the troubled savings and loan
industry and Dick Thornburgh, the attorney general, was concerned
about jurisdictional matters at the Justice Department.
   ``I'm very concerned that there is not enough real commitment of
a deep-seated nature among the members of the administration, bar
one or two, like Jack Kemp or Bill Bennett, that is necessary to
drive a tough, winning drug policy,'' von Raab said.
   Kemp is secretary of Housing and Urban Development, and William
Bennett was appointed by President Bush as the nation's drug czar.
   Referring to unnamed officials as ``country club Republicans,''
the commissioner said, ``You cannot have a Cabinet secretary or a
senior official in a department take the position that we cannot
get ourselves too deeply into this exercise because it will become
another Vietnam.
   ``If we don't approach this war with the intention of winning it
and doing what's necessary to win it, we won't win it,'' he said.
``And that means you have got to have fire in your belly to want to
win it.''
   Some officials dismissed von Raab's remarks. One Treasury
official who spoke on condition of anonymity said von Raab felt
rebuked by the appointment of a new commissioner. Others said he
was angered because he had been passed over for drug czar, a newly
created position in the Bush administration.
   Von Raab told ABC News that Bush, along with Bennett, is
committed toward stemming the flow of illegal drugs into the
country but blasted the State Department for having a ``cowardly
streak'' about drugs.
   He also warned little is being done while Bennett prepares his
program.
   ``It's just out of control,'' von Raab said, ``and in that sense
our national policy has been a total and abysmal failure.''
   He said the United States has failed to apply political and
economic pressure against drug-producing countries which allow
traffickers to roam freely.
   ``They feel no pressure whatsoever,'' he said in the television
interview. ``They are happily living out their lives as feudal
barons in the hills of Colombia, Peru, and Bolivia and no one's
touching them, including the United States. There's so much cocaine
out there that we can't control it.''
   After a U.S. drug agent was killed in 1985 by drug dealers in
Mexico, von Raab sealed the border to pressure the Mexican
government into finding the killers.

   David Horning started his day with a swim
in Paris and ended it splashing in San Francisco Bay in a marathon
dip marking his 41st birthday and the 200th anniversary of the
French Revolution.
   ``Is this San Francisco?'' the sports promoter laughed as he
emerged from the bay Thursday night after swimming 1\ miles from
Alcatraz Island to Aquatic Park near Fisherman's Wharf.
   The swim down the Seine in Paris was ``wonderful,'' he said, but
the final leg in San Francisco took 45 minutes, a bit longer than
anticipated.
   ``The ebb tide was stronger than I expected,'' Horning said.
   Horning failed to complete his initial plan, which included an
additional swim from the Statue of Liberty in New York to Battery
Park at the tip of Manhattan. Airplane connection problems scuttled
that effort.
   ``The swims are the easy part,'' said Horning. ``It's catching
the planes that can be tricky.''
   Anyway, he did manage to swim to one Statue of Liberty.
   He swam through Paris from the Bastille to the little-known
French Statue of Liberty, on an island in the Seine down river from
the Eiffel Tower. The statue is a reduced-scale version of the one
in New York Harbor. Americans gave it to France in thanks for
France's gift of the original to the United States.
   The swim in France took 1 hour and 15 minutes, making his total
time in the water Thursday two hours.
   Such ventures are not unusual for Horning, who lives in nearby
Berkeley.
   Last year he marked his 40th birthday by swimming under 40
bridges in Moscow, New York and San Francisco.
   Why does he do it?
   ``I'm an epileptic and I hope this gives others confidence to do
what they want to do,'' he said shortly after getting out of the
water to the applause of a small crowd of friends, relatives and
reporters.

   Kansas wimpy?
   Not in Gov. Mike Hayden's book. And any Texan who says so is
stirring up a twister full of trouble, he says.
   He shot off a telegram Thursday to Texas State Treasurer Ann
Richards, taking exception to her characterization of Kansas as a
wimpy state.
   After all, the Republican governor pointed out, Wichita State
University blasted the University of Texas in the College World
Series earlier this year.
   ``We refer Ann Richards to the members of the Texas University
baseball team if she has any questions about Kansas fortitude,''
Hayden said.
   Richards is a Democratic gubernatorial candidate in Texas who
delivered the keynote address last year at the Democratic National
Convention that made the phrase ``Where was George?'' part of the
campaign rhetoric.
   She says the proposed new slogan for the Texas license plate,
``The Friendship State,'' was too wimpy, although it might be fine
for Kansas or Ohio.
   Hayden retorted, ``She tried the wimpy strategy at the
Democratic Convention last year when she lashed out at George Bush.
Now she's lashing out at Kansas with the same attack. We say, Ann,
read our lips: Give the wimpy routine a rest.''

<HEAD>Sudanese Rebels Agree to Peace Talks</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ADDIS ABABA, Ethiopia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Sudanese rebels said today they had
agreed to peace talks with Sudan's new military rulers but that no
date had been set.
   Maj. Deng Alor, a spokesman for the Sudan People's Liberation
Army, said only that he hoped the talks he described as preliminary
would begin soon.
   Sudan's leader, Lt. Gen. Omar Hassan el-Bashir, said Thursday
that the talks would begin in early August. El-Bashir said the
Sudanese government delegation would include one member of the
15-member junta that ousted an elected civilian government in
Khartoum June 30.
   Deng said the rebel delegation would include a high-ranking
member of the rebel's military command but rebel leader John Garang
would not take part in the preliminary discussions.
   The talks, to be held in Ethiopia's capital, Addis Ababa, are
aimed at ending Sudan's 6-year-old civil war, which has killed and
displaced millions of people and created waves of refugees into
countries neighboring Sudan.
   The rebel movement, which is headquartered in Addis Ababa, took
up arms against Khartoum's Moslem-dominated government in 1983,
demanding greater autonomy and economic reforms for the nation's
predominantly Christian and ethnically African south.
   In an interview published July 13, el-Bashir said he would agree
to partition of his country if southern residents decide it would
end the civil war. The United Arab Emirates newspaper Al-Khaleej
quoted him as saying he would also accept forming a federation with
southern Sudan.
   El-Bashir has said one of the reasons he ousted Prime Minister
Sadek el-Mahdi's government was because it failed to end the war.
He ordered a unilateral cease-fire, which rebels appear to have
tacitly accepted.
   U.N. officials said earlier this month that Sudan's new military
rulers and the rebels have pledged to cooperate with U.N. efforts
to save 100,000 Sudanese threatened by famine and disease.
   Food has been used as a weapon in the civil war, and the United
Nations estimates 250,000 Sudanese died last year from starvation
due to flood, drought, and war-induced famine.

   Syrian and Christian gunners pounded
Beirut today with an estimated 50,000 shells and rockets, killing
at least 13 people in what police called ``Beirut's night of terror
and horror.''
   A police spokesman said 65 people were wounded in the eight-hour
bombardment, which he called the heaviest shelling in the
four-month standoff between Gen. Michel Aoun's mainly Christian
troops and the Syrian army.
   ``We're being killed in our beds. ... Beirut is being massacred

said an announcer on the Christian Voice of Lebanon radio, his
voice choking with emotion.
   The Moslem-controlled Voice of the Nation described the
ear-splitting artillery duel as ``a night of insane terror.''
   One Grad rocket crashed into the top floor of the seven-story
building that houses the offices of The Associated Press and the
television networks CBS and NBC.
   ``The explosion blew me out of my bed. I found myself flat on
the floor with glass shards showering me,'' said Associated Press
correspondent Farouk Nassar, who lives on the sixth floor of the
building.
   The blast shattered windows and sent pieces of furniture
tumbling into the street.
   Screams for help echoed from nearby apartment buildings.
   ``His leg is chopped off!'' one woman shouted as she guided
civil defense rescuers to the second floor of another building
struck by a rocket.
   The victim was Jawhar al-Jawhari, a Druse janitor, who was
rushed to the American University Hospital. Dozens of stretchers
with screaming wounded crowded the hospital's emergency ward.
   The U.N. headquarters in west Beirut and the Soviet Embassy
compound also took direct hits. But no casualties were reported
among their staff, police said.
   Shells tore wide holes in scores of high-rise apartment
buildings and hundreds of stores and boutiques had their iron
shutters blown off.
   The International Committee of the Red Cross in Beirut appealed
``for an immediate cessation of (the) indiscriminate bombardment.''
   The casualties raised the overall toll to 494 killed dead and
2,014 injured since the latest round in the 14-year civil war
fighting erupted March 8.
   The police spokesman, speaking on condition of anonymity, said
an estimated 50,000 shells and rockets were fired. He called the
bombardment ``the worst in four months in terms of firepower
unleashed and destruction.''
   It was the third deadliest bombardment. Thirty-nine people were
killed on March 14 and 28 people were killed on Thursday.
   An electrical tools warehouse in west Beirut's Sadat
neighborhood was still blazing midmorning with fire engines unable
to put out the blaze because of water shortages. Smoke blackened
the facades of neighboring apartment buildings.
   The police spokesman said the heavy shelling started around 8
p.m. when Syrian gunners in west Beirut and north Lebanon hit
Jounieh, east Beirut and the Christian port of Byblos.
   Aoun's troops and the Lebanese Forces, the main Christian
militia, retaliated with howitzer fire in west Beirut. The shelling
tapered off around 4 a.m., the spokesman added.
   Almost every part of Beirut and Jounieh were hit ``as if by a
killer earthquake,'' the spokesman said, adding: ``It was Beirut's
night of horror and terror.''
   The current confrontation erupted two days after Aoun ordered
his gunboats and helicopter gunships to blockade three illegal
harbors run by Moslem militias south of Beirut.
   He said the blockade was aimed at restoring state authority
eroded during the civil war and to recoup an estimated $100 million
a year in lost customs revenues.
   Druse warlord Walid Jumblatt retaliated by shelling the
Christian enclave north of Beirut, where Aoun's 20,000 troops are
stationed.
   The Syrians, who maintain 40,000 troops in Lebanon under a 1976
peacekeeping mandate from the Arab League, later joined in the
shelling and enforced a sea and land blockade of the enclave.

<HEAD>Dollar Steady, Gold Lower</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The dollar held steady in thin European trading
this morning as the market digested U.S. economic growth figures
released Thursday.
   Gold prices were lower.
   Foreign exchange dealers said the dollar was lacking firm
direction following the release of data that showed the U.S. gross
national product slowed in the second quarter to a seasonally
adjusted annual rate of 1.7 percent from 3.7 percent in the first
quarter. A growth rate of 2 percent had been expected.
   One dealer in Frankfurt said while the dollar was pushed lower
by the news, the figures had not had a drastic impact on the
currency.
   ``It shows that there is still demand,'' said the dealer at a
U.S. bank on condition of anonymity.
   Traders also noted that at the end of a summer week and month,
the dollar was not expected to fluctuate widely.
   In London, the British pound cost $1.657, cheaper for buyers
than Thursday's late $1.6598.
   The fall in the pound was a change from its recent gains of 10
cents against the dollar over the past seven weeks and four cents
this week. British interest rates stand at 14 percent, making the
pound very attractive to investors.
   Other midmorning rates for the dollar in Europe compared with
Thursday's late rates:
   _ 1.8774 West German marks, up from 1.8692
   _ 1.6158 Swiss francs, up from 1.6075
   _ 6.3530 French francs, up from 6.3310
   _ 2.1163 Dutch guilders, up from 2.1085
   _ 1,350.50 Italian lire, up from 1,346.00
   _ 1.1832 Canadian dollars, up from 1.1827
   In Tokyo, where trading ends before London's business day
begins, the dollar closed at 139.45 yen, up 0.10 yen from
Thursday's close. In London, the yen traded lower at 139.30 yen.
   Gold opened in London, the major market, at a bid $372 a troy
ounce, down from $374 late Thursday. At midmorning, London's
dealers recommended a bid price of $371.95.
   Gold traded in Zurich at a bid price of $371.60, down from late
Thursday's $374.05.
   Earlier in Hong Kong, gold dropped $1.87 dollars an ounce to
close at a bid $373.
   Silver bullion traded in London at a bid $5.21 a troy ounce,
down from $5.23 late Thursday.

<TEXT>
   Scattered thunderstorms along the mid-Atlantic Coast early today
produced high winds and drenched several areas, while forecasters
predicted a slight break in the Northeast's heat.
   Nearly 3 inches of rain fell in Meridian, Miss., in less than
two hours late Thursday. Scattered thunderstorms lingered over
parts of Ohio, Georgia, South Carolina and Florida early this
morning.
   Thunderstorms developing ahead of a cold front crossing the
Great Lakes region weakened Thursday night.
   Earlier, the storms produced large hail and damaging winds in
Wisconsin and Illinois.
   In the Northeast, thunderstorms produced severe weather in New
York and Vermont.
   Hail the size of dimes fell in Ira, Vt., while in the northern
part of the state, winds gusted to 58 mph at Milton. Also in
Vermont, winds blew down trees in at least five northern
communities, including Stowe.
   Evening thunderstorms in New York produced high winds that
downed trees and power lines at Rensselaer, while thunderstorms in
Massachusetts downed trees at Pittsfield.
   At least 30,000 people in New York had lost electricity by
midevening, but most had power back in less than an hour, according
to the Niagara Mohawk Power Corp.
   Severe thunderstorms in the state were expected this morning,
but the National Weather Service said the rain should clear by the
afternoon, with high temperatures in the 80s.
   The region had three straight days with highs over 90 degrees.
   On Thursday, New England's electricity demand hit an all-time
summer high.
   In Connecticut, hospitals treated dozens of people for heat
exhaustion and respiratory problems. Forty-one children on a trip
in eastern Connecticut were treated at Windham Community Memorial
Hospital for heat exhaustion. They were all released by Thursday
night.
   Out West, high winds overturned a trailer near Lewistown, Mont.,
and isolated thunderstorms lingered over northwestern Montana and
the Nebraska Panhandle early today.
   Scattered showers and thunderstorms in the Southwest produced
locally heavy rains in Utah and Arizona Thursday night. Flash
flooding was reported in southwestern Utah and in two counties in
southwestern Arizona.
   The high for the nation on Thursday was 112 degrees at Bullhead
City, Ariz.
   Today's forecast called for showers and thunderstorms likely
across New England and the mid-Atlantic states; scattered showers
and thunderstorms from the south Atlantic coastal states across the
lower Mississippi and Tennessee valleys to southern and eastern
portions of the Ohio Valley; scattered showers and thunderstorms
over western North Dakota, the northern Rockies, Utah and Arizona;
and isolated thunderstorms during the afternoon over the central
and southern Rockies, the southern Plains and Missouri.
   Predicted highs: in the 80s and 90s across most of the nation;
in the 70s over the Upper Great Lakes, the northern Pacific Coast,
and along the California coast; and from 100 to 110 degrees over
the desert Southwest.
   Temperatures around the nation at 3 a.m. EDT ranged from 48
degrees at Olympia, Wash., to 89 degrees at Las Vegas.

   New York state says it's beaten Jason, the
indestructible hockey-masked killer of ``Friday the 13th'' fame.
   But Jason says this wasn't a battle he planned to fight anyway.
   State Economic Development Department officials claimed victory
Thursday in a battle with Paramount Pictures over use of the
copyright ``I Love New York'' logo in promoting the newest ``Friday
the 13th'' movie.
   The ads showed Jason, who periodically rises to slash up a camp
full of teen-agers, cutting through the heart of an ``I Love New
York'' poster.
   The ads were promoting the eighth in the series of ``Friday the
13th'' movies, titled ``Jason Takes Manhattan.''
   But New York officials objected to the filmmaker using the ``I
Love New York'' logo without paying the proper franchise fee.
Earlier this month, they threatened to sue for copyright
infringement.
   ``You slash our heart, we'll cut you off at the knees,'' said
state agency spokesman Harold Holzer. ``There's someone in New York
who's tougher than Jason,'' he said, referring to state Economic
Development Commissioner Vincent Tese.
   On Thursday, according to state officials, Paramount said it
would drop the ``I Love New York.''
   Paramount spokeswoman Deborah Rosen said the poster was intended
as a ``teaser'' that was scheduled to be dropped from circulation
once the movie is released today.
   A new poster, to be released with the movie, shows Jason looming
over the New York City skyline wielding a hunting knife. It carries
the slogan, ``New York has a new problem.''
   Holzer said the state has dropped its lawsuit.

<TEXT>
   The New York Athletic Club, which for 121 years
was a bastion of male exclusivity, has agreed to accept women as
members.
   The 10,000-member club decided Thursday to end its holdout and
join other previously men-only clubs that have agreed to admit
women to comply with a 1984 city law upheld last year by the U.S.
Supreme Court.
   ``I am very pleased that the New York Athletic Club has voted to
admit women as members. My only regret is that it did not do so
sooner. But all's well that ends well,'' said Mayor Edward I. Koch.
   A letter dated Thursday to members from president Wallace L.
Beneville said the club was dropping ``with great regret'' its
challenge to the city law in view of the high court's unanimous
June 20, 1988, decision.
   Beneville wrote that the club's Board of Governors had reached
agreement with the city Commission on Human Rights ``that women,
properly sponsored by other members, will be considered for
membership on the same basis as male applicants.''
   ``In that connection, however, the women applicants will be
subject to the same waiting list as our male applicants,'' the
letter said.
   The Human Rights Commission, which has filed complaints against
several men-only clubs in the past five years, would not comment.
   The city law governs clubs that have more than 400 members,
serve meals and rent facilities to non-members for business
purposes. Such clubs cannot deny membership because of sex, race,
creed, color or national origin.
   The New York State Club Association, representing about 125
clubs, had challenged the law.
   In his letter, Beneville said board members ``felt (and still do
feel) that this law is an invalid governmental intrusion on our
right of freedom of association. We also felt that our membership
should have the right of self determination, i.e., to decide whom
they wished to be members.
   ``While we still feel strongly about this, we have now reached
the point where it appears that further litigation would be
fruitless. Our counsel have advised us that in their view were we
to pursue the case through the courts we would ultimately lose.''

<TEXT>
   Saudi financier Adnan Khashoggi has traded his
jail cell for a 30,000-square-foot luxury apartment and an
electronic monitoring device he must wear after posting $10 million
bail.
   Khashoggi, who had been jailed in New York since Switzerland
extradited him to the United States on July 19, was released
Thursday after his brothers posted two $5 million checks.
   As he left the federal courthouse, Khashoggi smiled for cameras
and promised he would stay in the United States to face charges
that he helped former Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos and his
wife Imelda defraud the Philippine treasury.
   ``I am pleased that the courts have granted me bail,'' he said
before being driven away in a silver limousine to his Fifth Avenue
apartment. ``I am anxious to begin work for my defense and look
forward to clearing my name at trial.''
   Khashoggi, Mrs. Marcos and another defendant, the California
Overseas Bank of Los Angeles, are scheduled to go on trial in
March. Marcos has been severed from the trial for health reasons.
The Marcoses are charged with stealing more than $100 million from
their government's treasury to buy real estate and art in New York.
   Khashoggi, who allegedly posed as the owner of some of the
assets as a cover, was indicted on racketeering, conspiracy, mail
fraud and obstruction of justice charges. However, Switzerland
released him on the last two charges only.
   Khashoggi's movements will be monitored by an electronic device
he must wear on his ankle. Although he can leave his apartment, he
is not allowed to travel outside the court's jurisdiction _
Manhattan, the Bronx and the northern New York suburbs.
   The duplex apartment, featured in House &amp; Garden magazine in
1984, was carved out of 16 separate apartments and contains such
amenities as a swimming pool in a two-story atrium, a sauna, a
7-by-10-foot bed covered in sable, marble floors, and Cartier
knickknacks.
   The Saudi-based National Commercial Bank filed a foreclosure
suit on the apartment last month. But defense lawyers told the
court the bank has given Khashoggi a year to clear up the $28.7
million default.
   Khashoggi, once one of the world's richest men, submitted
documents to the court last week indicating a net worth of $53.8
million.
   Khashoggi was released after an appeals judge denied a request
by prosecutors to revoke the bail arrangement set Tuesday by U.S.
District Judge John Keenan.
   One of the Barclays Bank checks posted as bail was signed by his
brother, Essam Khashoggi, and the other by his half-brother, Amr
Khashoggi.
   Prosecutors had opposed his release, saying that Khashoggi had
concealed his true wealth and was likely to flee.
   Khashoggi faces up to five years in jail and a $250,000 fine on
each of the two charges of mail fraud and obstruction of justice.

<HEAD>Pope to Visit Mexico in May</HEAD>

<DATELINE>MEXICO CITY (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Pope John Paul II will visit Mexico for a
week in May and may take part in the canonization of Juan Diego,
the Aztec peasant whose visions of the Virgin Mary gave Mexico its
patron saint.
   Several officials said the pope's visit also may coincide with
an official rapprochement between the Mexican government and the
church.
   The Foreign Ministry said the Mexican government gave its formal
approval for the papal visit, John Paul's first to Mexico since
January 1979.
   ``The trip was confirmed quite a long time ago; the only thing
that remained was the consent of the government,'' Monsignor Genaro
Alamilla, spokesman for the Episcopal Conference of Mexico's Roman
Catholic Church, told a news conference Thursday.
   It was not clear if the pope is intending to visit Cuba on the
overseas trip. President Fidel Castro in January invited him to the
Communist-ruled country, and Cuban and Vatican officials have held
discussions since then.
   Church officials said the pope would tour several southern
Mexico states and may take part in a ceremony canonizing Diego.
Diego has already been beatified, the next-to-the-last step in
attaining sainthood.
   The constitution of this overwhelmingly Catholic nation, written
when the church was considered closer to the upper classes than to
most of the people, does not recognize the church as a legal entity
and bars priests from any political activity, even voting.
   However, President Carlos Salinas de Gortari said in his
inaugural address Dec. 1 that it was time to revise relations
between the church and the state.
   Representatives of the church and the government have been
holding talks on the possibility of amending the constitution and
opening relations with the Vatican.
   ``The papal visit is not a confirmation that these institutions
will establish relations, but we can't discard the possibility of
an historical coincidence,'' said Archbishop Juan Jose Posadas of
Guadalajara, the head of the organizing committee for the papal
visit.
   Monsignor Geronimo Prigione, the Vatican representative in
Mexico, said the seven-day visit in May is not ``to steal power or
press for a legal change in the church-state relationship.''
   Diego's visions of the Virgin of Guadalupe are regarded by many
scholars as crucial to the conversion of Mexico from a pagan,
Indian nation to a Catholic, Spanish colony.
   Contemporary accounts say Diego first saw the virgin on Dec. 9,
1531, on a hillside where there had been a temple to the Aztec
goddess Tonantzin. She told him to tell the bishop she wanted her
own temple built on the spot.
   The bishop didn't believe Diego and asked for proof. The fourth
time she appeared, according to the accounts, the virgin filled
Diego's cloak with out-of-season roses. The accounts say that when
Diego unfurled the cloak to show the roses to the bishops, it was
imprinted with the virgin's portrait.
   The cloak is the centerpiece of the main altar at the Basilica
of Guadalupe in Mexico City, the shrine built on the site of
Diego's visions.

   A man who while drunk yanked from the
ground miniature American flags planted along a street has been
sentenced to six months in prison and fined $200 for flag
desecration.
   William Frank Erlston, 22, was sentenced Thursday by District
Justice William L. Breech.
   Police said Erlston discarded the miniature American flags,
planted by members of the Veterans of Foreign Wars for the Fourth
of July. Erlston had been drunk and apparently was not making a
political statement, police said.
   The U.S. Supreme Court recently upheld the right of political
protesters to burn flags as a protected form of free speech. But
Erlston did not use that defense, and instead pleaded guilty to
flag desecration, which in Pennsylvania carries a maximum penalty
of two years in prison and a fine of $5,000.

<HEAD>Investigators Say Youth Committed Suicide in Cyanide-Yogurt Death</HEAD>

<DATELINE>CAMDEN, N.J. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The investigation of the poisoning of a
teen-ager who died after eating cyanide-tainted yogurt has ended,
but the youth's parents are still searching for answers.
   Investigators ruled Thursday that Thomas Lee, 17, of Haddonfield
committed suicide and had not been a victim of product tampering.
   His parents, Frances and Hsin-Yi Lee, a professor at Rutgers
University in Camden, angrily denounced the findings and said they
did not believe their son committed suicide.
   ``Why would Tom commit suicide,'' Frances Lee said shortly after
the couple, both immigrants from Taiwan, were informed of the
conclusion. ``Everyone who knows him said he was the last person
who would commit suicide.''
   Lee slipped into a coma in January after eating several
spoonfuls of cyanide-laced Breyer's black cherry yogurt on his way
to school. He died on Feb. 7 at a hospital after he was removed
from a respirator.
   The resulting six-month investigation was to determine if the
case should be treated as a homicide, suicide or tampering.
   On Thursday, Camden County Prosecutor Samuel Asbell said ``the
hard facts indicate to us that it was suicide.''
   Lee, a high school junior, was described by classmates as a
well-liked, artistic student. Investigators, however, said the
youth left musical tapes and poetry indicating he had been
depressed because of poor grades and thought about dying.
   The poisoning prompted a tampering scare and led grocers in the
mid-Atlantic region to temporarily remove yogurt from shelves.
Breyer's said its investigation determined the cyanide did not
originate at its plants.
   Asbell said the potassium cyanide found in the yogurt matched
cyanide found in professor Lee's laboratory at Rutgers. Lee is
chairman of the biology department and is an award-winning
researcher, recognized as an expert on early brain development.
   Asbell said Thomas Lee had a key to the laboratory and had
visited it last summer.
   The Lees contend investigators bungled the probe, misplacing a
vial of cyanide found in a trash can outside the Lee home.
   Asbell said the vial was examined by U.S. Food and Drug
Administration officials in Philadelphia. He said it was lost when
it was flown to an FBI lab in Washington, but he said a seal
recovered from the vial did not contain any indentifiable
fingerprints.
   ``There is something very wrong in this investigation,'' said
Mrs. Lee, who has a master's degree in immunology. ``I got the
feeling they were trying to cover up.''
   A grand jury was convened to review the case. The 23-member
panel adjourned in March without handing up an indictment.

   Helmsley businesses footed the bill for
thousands of dollars' worth of shoes and other items bought by
hotel queen Leona Helmsley, her former personal assistant said.
   Testifying at Mrs. Helmsley's tax-evasion trial in U.S. District
Court on Thursday, Martin Goldstein, the former assistant, said the
Park Lane Hotel paid most of Mrs. Helmsley's personal credit card
bills.
   Goldstein said the bill for Mrs. Helmsley's American Express
card, which she used only for catalog purchases, was passed on to a
Helmsley real estate company.
   In other testimony, Goldstein said he discovered Mrs. Helmsley's
record book listing expenses at her Greenwich, Conn., mansion more
than a year after government investigators had issued subpoenas for
documents relating to the estate, Dunnellen Hall.
   Mrs. Helmsley, 69, is accused of evading taxes by disguising
renovations at the estate and other personal items as business
expenses. Two former aides, Joseph Licari and Frank Turco, are
charged with assisting in the alleged scheme.
   Mrs. Helmsley's 80-year-old husband, Harry, was indicted but
severed from the trial because he was found mentally incompetent.
   Goldstein said he discovered Mrs. Helmsley's Dunnellen file in
April 1988, a short time after her indictment, as he helped her
look through her office desk for a personal letter.
   Mrs. Helmsley told him to give the file to one of her lawyers,
he said.
   Assistant U.S. Attorney James DeVita submitted copies of Mrs.
Helmsley's credit card bills as evidence.
   They showed numerous purchases at tony stores such as Tiffany &amp;
Co., Henri Bendel, Ann Taylor, Marshall Fields, Saks Fifth Avenue,
Gucci Shops and Delman Shoes, where Mrs. Helmsley bought thousands
of dollars in footwear. Many of the items were later returned.
   Among the purchases she made were $280 in clocks and watches
from Tiffany's, a $281 belt from Ann Taylor, a $345 men's robe from
Henri Bendel and $259 worth of briefs from Saks.
   Goldstein testified that Mrs. Helmsley did some of her shopping

   ``She would mark what she wanted, fold the page and give them to
me,'' Goldstein said, adding that he would give the catalogs to a
secretary to call in the orders.
   Goldstein was to be questioned by defense lawyers when the trial
resumes Monday.

<HEAD>Guard Confirms Report of Parts Theft Ring</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICK HAMPSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The state Army National Guard has confirmed
reports that a group of soldiers and civilians has been stealing
military automatic weapons parts and using them to assemble and
sell rifles, machine guns and pistols.
   Lt. Col. Peter Kutschera, spokesman for the guard, said Thursday
that over the past seven years, a substantial number of parts were
stolen in western New York state and used in the assembly of at
least 58 automatic or semi-automatic guns.
   But he said a report in Thursday's Gannett Westchester
Newspapers that entire weapons were stolen from the guard was
unfounded and that all weapons were accounted for.
   Kutschera said evidence gathered by guard investigators and the
U.S. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms was being presented to
federal prosecutors in Buffalo.
   Sen. Pete Wilson, R-Calif., a member of the Senate Armed
Services Committee who has held hearings on military weapons
thefts, called for an investigation by the U.S. General Accounting
Office.
   ``This could very well be a national problem,'' Wilson said.
``Unfortunately, we're not surprised that this exists ... since the
Defense Department's inventory system is so riddled with problems.''
   Kutschera said the ring appeared to succeed because the
military, which audits fully assembled weapons in its arsenals each
month, conducts no such audits of weapon parts _ including barrels,
stocks and firing mechanisms.
   The guard, Kutschera said, ``has no accounting procedures to
detect the loss of parts if they're pilfered on a small basis.''
   Trigger units do have serial numbers, however, and the ring
apparently did not steal any of them from the guard but instead
purchased others from civilian sources.
   Kutschera said the guard learned of the ring in March 1988
through an unrelated investigation of sales of stolen military
equipment and clothing to an Army-Navy store in the Buffalo area. A
soldier accused of involvement in those sales informed
investigators about the weapons ring.
   According to investigators' records, members of the ring stole
weapons parts from guard repair and supply facilities, mostly in
Buffalo and Rochester, and reassembled them with serial-numbered,
non-military parts. Then they were traded or sold.

<TEXT>
   Hashemi Rafsanjani, all but assured of
victory in today's presidential election, has begun forming a
Cabinet that includes economists and technocrats to help guide this
troubled nation into the post-Khomeini era, sources say.
   The early turnout in Tehran was sluggish despite the
exhortations of Iranian leaders over the last few days for a
massive demonstration of unity. The opposition claimed there was
little enthusiasm for the election.
   Only a few dozen people were seen at polling stations in Tehran
after they opened at 7 a.m., although voting appeared to pick up
later.
   However, Interior Minister Ali Akbar Mohtashemi told Tehran
Radio that voting was so heavy in some provinces that ``the polling
stations are asking for more personnel ... because of the crowds.''
   He said polling was extended for two hours beyond the scheduled
5 p.m. closing time.
   There was no word on when the results would be announced. The
government did not say how many eligible voters there are, but the
number was estimated at 25 million _ about half the population _
during parliamentary elections last year.
   The main Iranian opposition group, the Mujahedeen Khalq or
People's Holy Warriors, claimed polling was ``extremely quiet.''
   Among the voters was Rafsanjani, the 55-year-old Parliament
speaker and commander in chief, who was so confident of victory he
did not campaign.
   Rafsanjani voted at a special booth in the courtyard of the
modest residence that belonged to the late Ayatollah Ruhollah
Khomeini in the north Tehran suburb of Jamaran.
   Rafsanjani cast two votes in separate boxes _ one for the
presidential ballot, the other for a referendum on whether to
increase the president's powers _ before camera crews from Iran's
state-run television.
   ``I'm happy to see the people voting, and this proves that the
revolution is strong. But I'm sorry the imam is no longer with
us,'' Rafsanjani said. Khomeini was referred to as the imam, a
Moslem term for religious leader.
   About 100 Revolutionary Guards and local residents chanted ``God
is great!'' and cheered the turbanned Rafsanjani, a middle-ranking
cleric, as he cast his votes.
   Prosecutor-General Mohammad Musavi Khoeniha, who led the crowds
that stormed the U.S. Embassy in Tehran in November 1979, also
voted at Khomeini's house with other senior Iranian religious and
political figures.
   Iranian leaders and the state media for days have been exhorting
Iranians to turn out to demonstrate unity following the Khomeini's
death on June 3.
   ``Each vote cast is a bullet fired at the heart of Iran's
enemies,'' the radical Jomhuri Islami daily said this week.
   But one disgruntled merchant, who declined to be identified,
said: ``Why bother to vote? Rafsanjani has been part of the
government for years and he's responsible with the other clerics
for mess the economy's in.''
   Diplomatic sources, speaking on the condition they not be
identified, say Rafsanjani already has selected a Cabinet that
would include economists and technocrats, some of them dumped from
earlier administrations because of ideological and policy
differences.
   Newspapers polls predict Rafsanjani will win 86 percent of the
vote.
   The elections were moved up from Aug. 18 to accelerate the
transition of power following the death of Khomeini, who founded
the fundamentalist republic in 1979 that toppled the regime of the
late Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi.
   Also on the ballot is a referendum on proposed constitutional
amendments that would give the presidency new powers. Khomeini
urged the changes to eliminate competing power centers that have
paralyzed the government.
   Incumbent President Ali Khamenei's second four-year term expires
Oct. 5 and he cannot run for a third term. He was elected Iran's
spiritual leader to succeed Khomeini on June 4.
   Khamenei is allied with Rafsanjani, who heads Iran's
``pragmatist faction.'' They are expected to open up the economy,
which conservative radicals have kept under tight reins since the
revolution, and to build bridges with the West, although that could
take time.

leader, no explanation given. Pickup 10th pvs, `Going into...'</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN DANISZEWSKI</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WARSAW, Poland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Wojciech Jaruzelski challenged
his fellow Communists today to decide what their party stands for
in a Poland that has thrown its allegiance to the Solidarity-led
opposition.
   Jaruzelski, the party chief, opened a crucial session of the
Central Committee that is expected to result in a new leader for
the first time in eight years and perhaps lead to fundamental
changes in the party itself.
   Later in the meeting, Politburo member Wladyslaw Baka,
considered a candidate to become prime minister and a critic of
outgoing Prime Minister Mieczyslaw F. Rakowski, gave up his duties
as the party leader in charge of the economy. There was no
immediate explanation.
   The scheduled two-day meeting comes a month after the candidates
backed by the newly legalized Solidarity trade union movement
captured 260 out of 261 seats they contested in the parliamentary
elections.
   Jaruzelski, who opened the meeting by thanking the party for
helping to elect him president July 19, was expected to resign from
the party leadership post he had held since 1981 in order to devote
himself to the new office.
   He told the meeting that it ould be ``one of the most
important'' meetings since the last party congress in 1986, the
state's PAP news service reported.
   Jaruzelski challenged the Central Committee to decide: ``What as
a party do we stand for? What should we defend against? What do we
fight for? And what tasks should we begin in pursuit of social
support?''
   The party also heard reports on the nation's poor economic
situation by Baka, assessing the election results by Politburo
member Janusz Reykowski and on the probles and future of the party
by Politburo member Marian Orzechowski.
   State radio reported that Baka at the end of his speech quit as
economic secretary for the Central Committee. The resignation could
be to free him to take the prime minister's job, or it could
indicate that he has lost out in a power struggle with Rakowski.
   In his speech, Baka had pointedly criticized Rakowski's
government as lacking ``stubbornness and consistency'' in its
handling of the economy.
   Reykowski expressed hope that the elections will have a
``curative effect on the party'' and spur it to change its ways of
functioning ``as soon as possible,'' PAP reported.
   ``Most of society has had enough of the party as it has been.
Secondly, a significant part of the party grass roots has had
enough of the style and ways of functioning of the party
leadership,'' Orzechowski said, according to PAP.
   Going into today's meeting, some party members said the
230-member Central Committee may call for a party congress, the
first in three years, to consider dissolving the 2 million-member
party and forming new groupings on the left.
   The party also was expected to be consulted on Jaruzelski's
choice to succeed Prime Minister Mieczyslaw F. Rakowski, who has
submitted his resignation as premier but is believed interested in
succeeding Jaruzelski as first secretary.
   On Thursday, one unidentified regional official quoted by state
radio said the party congress, considered for later this year,
``should be the last congress in the history of the (party). I
think that new parties should be created where everyone would be
able to find a place for himself.''
   After the party's June thrashing in the parliamentary elections
_ the freest in 40 years _ a Central Committee official told
reporters: ``This Polish party cannot win elections. This Communist
Party will not win elections.'' The official, speaking on condition
of anonymity, suggested that radical reforms were necessary.
   Splitting the party into a leftist or social democratic party
and a more orthodox Communist Party appeared to be favored by
reformists in the party close to Jaruzelski. But Rakowski has
opposed such division.
   Rakowski argues that a united Communist Party should protect
living standards and win support by appealing to economic issues.
   Jaruzelski, 66, was appointed party first secretary in October
1981 and ordered martial law two months later to crush Solidarity.
But this year, in an effort to pull the nation out of its economic
crisis, he urged party leaders to legalize the trade union and
ushered in Poland's first free elections in more than four decades.
   He has promised Solidarity lawmakers that he would leave his
party position if elected president, but he did not specify when.
   On July 19, he was elected president by the National Assembly
with the minimum majority, thanks to passive support from a handful
of Solidarity legislators.
   Interior Minister Czeslaw Kiszczak or party ideologist Marian
Orzechowski also are considered in the running for party leader,
assuming Jaruzelski does resign at the Central Committee meeting.
   Jaruzelski had been urging that the next government be a ``grand
coalition'' that would include Solidarity.
   But Solidarity leader Lech Walesa rejected the offer Tuesday and
said if the opposition would not be allowed to form the whole
government, then it would stay entirely in the opposition.

   Typhoon Judy struck flood-stricken
southern areas with more rain and high winds today, uprooting trees
and forcing thousands of ships to seek refuge in ports, weather
officials said.
   The typhoon, packing winds of 78 mph, hit the southwestern tip
of the peninsula around 9 p.m. and was moving northwest at 15 mph,
the officials said.
   Five days of floods caused by torrential rains in South Korea
have already killed at least 70 people, disaster relief officials
said. The National Disaster Center said 45 other people were
missing and 54,500 were homeless. Property damange was estimated at
$200 million.
   It is the third typhoon in two weeks in East Asia, where more
than 130 people have died in flooding this week alone.
   Typhoon Judy was expected to lose much of its power and weaken
to a tropical storm as it continued a northwesterly course along
the peninsula's west coast, the officials said.
   In Yosu and other ports on the southcoast, high winds uprooted
trees, blew away commercial signboards and smashed hundreds of
windows. People in low-lying areas were evacuated and thousands of
ships were brought in to ports.
   The National Disaster Center issued a new flood warning for
southern areas and asked people in low-lying areas to take refugee
in highlands.
   Cargo waiting to be loaded on ships were tied down, small craft
were pulled ashore and pedestrians were warned to avoid beaches due
to heavy surf.
   In Japan, officials said the typhoon killed a 1-year-old boy who
was buried in a landslide that destroyed his home in Tarumizu city,
Kagoshima, 610 miles southwest of Tokyo.
   Nearly 390,000 homes on Kyushu Island were without electricity
this morning, but the number had decreased to 270,000 by midday,
according to Kyushu Electric Power Co. Scores of homes were flooded
in Kagoshima prefecture alone.
   Most of the victims in South Korea were killed in landslides or
drowned in creeks or rivers in the southern provinces of South
Cholla and North Cholla and South Kyongsang. Up to 17.6 inches of
rain has fallen in the past five days.
   Thousands of homes and buildings have been inundated or
destroyed, rice paddies submerged and highways and railroad tracks
have been washed out, National Disaster Center officials said,
speaking on condition of anonymity in keeping with South Korean
practice.
   President Roh Tae-woo called a Cabinet meeting today to review
relief efforts. The Defense Ministry said troops and military
equipment would be mobilized to help cleanup and relief efforts.
   In China's central Sichuan province, at least 14 people have
drowned in floods this week, the official China Daily reported
today.
   Six people were injured and eight were missing in heavy rains
since Tuesday, the paper said, quoting the state Flood Control
Headquarters.
   Sichuan, China's most populous province, has been hit by
torrential rains since early this month that have killed more than
800 people and injured 3,000 people, it said. About 1,800 people
have died in flooding in 15 provinces across China since mid-June.
   Police in Taiwan said floods left eight people dead and one
missing. Police rescued thousands of people as hundreds of houses
were inundated throughout the island. Floodwaters as high as 16{
feet smashed houses, bridges and inundated rice paddies in several
villages, officials said. They estimated property damage at about
$3.8 million.
   Vietnam's official news agency reported today that heavy rains
this week killed 49 people in the northern province of Thanh Hoa.
   Two typhoons, Gordon and Hope, swept across East Asia last week.
Gordon began in the Philippines where it killed 26 people and left
17 dead in China's Guangdong and Guangxi provinces and one dead in
Hong Kong. Hope killed at least 36 people in China's Fujian
province.

   The battle of the poisoned Treaty Oak goes
on, with a self-described tree wizard claiming the centuries-old
majestic oak is dead and city forestry experts disagreeing.
   The wizard, who rode to the rescue from his home in Pennsylvania
on $1,000 raised by friends, said the city's latest antidote ``was
the final nail in the coffin.
   ``I felt the spirit of the tree leave,'' said Stephen Redding,
42, of Green Lane, Pa., who stayed near the tree for six days,
sleeping on a park bench.
   City officials Thursday insisted the tree is clinging to life
and that their rescue attempts were devised by experts.
   The tree was poisoned at least four months ago with an
herbicide. A 45-year-old man has been charged with felony criminal
mischief in what authorities say was a ritual poisoning.
   The tree is called Treaty Oak because legend has it that Texas
patriarch Stephen F. Austin made peace with Indians under its
branches.
   John Giedraitis, city forester, and several experts ordered the
injection of a saltwater solution into Treaty Oak in more than 100
places earlier this week to offset the herbicide, Velpar.
   ``The tree has huge amounts of poison in it,'' Giedraitis said.
   Experts decided to use the saltwater solution after tests showed
twigs on the tree had no carbohydrates, or energy reserves, he said.
   He said the injection process is standard technology.
   Redding, who says he owns a tree maintenance business, said the
treatment hurt the tree.
   ``In my opinion that oak expired at 5:20 p.m. Tuesday,'' when
the crews started injecting the solution, he said.
   He also complained that the city applied sewer sludge around the
roots. But Giedraitis said the sludge is a mild organic fertilizer
that to trees is like ``chicken broth.''
   Geidraitis said Redding is a tree lover, but ``he doesn't
understand what is exactly going on in the tree. He's a little on
the wrong track.''
   Redding said, ``If that tree is alive a year from now, I'll
invite the public to throw rotten tomatoes at me.''

<HEAD>Party Orders Breakup of Company Linked to Deng's Son</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KATHY WILHELM</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BEIJING (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Communist Party leaders today ordered the breakup
of a major trade company linked to senior leader Deng Xiaoping's
son and announced audits of other leading companies in its most
serious attack yet on corruption.
   A notice handed down by the party Politburo, a top
decision-making body, also ordered an end to the banquets, bribes,
foreign jaunts and luxury cars enjoyed by many high officials, and
put limits on what their children can do for a living.
   The notice, read on the national television news, said the
Politburo acted ``to inspire party spirit and the people's
aspirations by starting first from the leaders in the party Central
Committee and the State Council.'' The State Council is China's
cabinet.
   It called for a spirit of ``hard work and plain living,'' one of
the leadership's favorite slogans since it crushed student
pro-democracy protests in June and purged party General Secretary
Zhao Ziyang.
   The protests showed public confidence in the leadership to be at
an all-time low, as hundreds of thousands of people rallied to the
students' slogan, ``Oppose corruption.''
   Among other things, the students lampooned children of high
officials who enjoy high posts in government and business,
including Deng's son, Deng Pufang, whom they nicknamed ``Prince
Pufang.''
   The Politburo, ordering that corruption be investigated ``no
matter who'' is involved, said a company linked to Deng Pufang will
be disbanded.
   The Kang Hua Development Corp. was formed under the auspices of
the younger Deng's China Welfare Fund for the Handicapped, and it
allegedly used the connection to evade taxes while developing into
one of China's largest foreign trade companies.
   The Politburo also ordered an audit of the China International
Trade and Investment Corp., the country's leading company for
attracting foreign investment.
   It gave the spouses and children of ``high officials'' until
Sept. 1 to resign from jobs in goods distribution companies but did
not list any names. The Politburo notice also:
   _Ordered a shake-up of state companies dealing in foreign trade,
material supplies and finance.
   _Banned party Politburo, Secretariat and State Council personnel
from driving imported cars and exchanging banquets and gifts paid
for with state funds.
   _Said all trips abroad by ``leading officials'' should be for
work only, not ``inspection,'' an apparent euphemism for tourism.
   _Ordered an end to the practice of providing special supplies of
scarce food items to high officials and said they would have to buy
all their food at the market price instead of at discount.
   As early as the 1960s, the public image of China's Communist
leaders had changed from that of spartan revolutionaries to a
pampered elite. But it took the economic decentralization of the
past decade and rapid growth in incomes to add bribery and black
marketeering to the list of official privileges.
   The party has issued repeated orders in recent years to cut
spending on luxuries and crack down on corruption, all with little
effect. However, none of the orders have been as sweeping.
   The latest move also comes in a crisis atmosphere, as party
leaders warn that the student movement disclosed weaknesses in
party organization and political education.

   Two Greenpeace U.S.A. ships sailed
toward an off-limits danger zone today to try to halt the test
launch of a Navy Trident 2 missile from a submerged submarine,
protest leaders said.
   A motorized inflatable raft carrying three members of the
environmental group was within 100 yards of the surfaced submarine
this morning, a Greenpeace spokesman said.
   ``The inflatable was warned over the radio it is in danger,''
spokesman Steve Shallhorn said by ship radio to Miami from the M.V.
Greenpeace. That ship was several miles from the submarine USS
Tennessee, he said.
   ``We can see the submarine being escorted by a destroyer,''
Shallhorn said, adding that the activists didn't plan to leave the
area.
   Greenpeace contends its vessels are free to enter the Navy-set
danger zone because it is in international waters.
   Earlier today, Lt. Jim Wood, a Navy spokesman at Port Canaveral,
said the Navy was aware of Greenpeace's protest plans but would not
say say what action it would take. He also would not confirm the
test launch. The Navy does not announce Trident launches in advance.
   ``We plan just to enter the security zone for a non-violent
peaceful protest,'' Greenpeace member Joel Clement said Thursday.
``We're not trying to begin any kind of a confrontation. We are
campaigning for nuclear-free seas.''
   The security zone is a large area of the Atlantic more than 30
miles east of Cape Canaveral that is placed off-limits to
non-essential ships during a submarine test-firing. The Navy would
not disclose the exact size of the area.
   Ships in the zone could be hit by missile debris in the event of
a misfiring. Normally, a countdown would be stopped if a ship
wandered into the off-limits sector.
   It would be the second underwater test firing of the Trident 2,
the Navy's newest, most powerful nuclear-armed missile. The first
test, in March, ended in an explosion when the $23.7 million weapon
pinwheeled out of control four seconds after it cleared the surface.
   In addition to the M.V. Greenpeace, a 190-foot vessel flying the
Dutch flag, the organization sent out the Monticivitano, a 60-foot
sailing ketch under Swedish registry.
   The Monticivitano, with seven people on board, left Fort Pierce,
about 70 miles south of here, on Thursday. The Greenpeace, with
about 20 on board, set off a few hours later from Daytona Beach, 60
miles north.
   The Navy has said it plans to have the Trident 2 operational and
on sea patrol by next March. The weapon has a range of 4,600 miles
and each can carry up to eight nuclear warheads.
   The Navy plans to develop a 21-submarine force carrying Trident
2 missiles at a cost of about $155 billion over the vessels'
30-year lifetime, according to a report from the congressional
General Accounting Office.

   A drifter accused of killing two people on
a municipal bus in Florida had a concealed-weapon permit from that
state, a newspaper reported.
   Joseph Besaraba, who was arrested in Nebraska and is fighting
extradition to Florida, obtained a Florida concealed-weapon permit
in September 1988, listing a church's soup kitchen as his mailing
address, the Sun-Sentinel in Fort Lauderdale reported today.
   Besaraba was accused of boarding a municipal bus in Hollywood
Sunday and fatally shooting driver Sydney Granger and passenger
Wesley B. Anderson with a 9mm semiautomatic pistol.
   Besaraba then allegedly commandeered a getaway car, critically
wounding driver Scott Yaguda, 31, a bakery manager from Alexandria,
Va., with gunshots to his back and legs. Yaguda was in stable
condition today at Hollywood's Memorial Hospital, said spokeswoman
Cynthia Wine.
   Since 1987, when the Florida Legislature made sweeping changes
in the state's gun laws, concealed weapons permits have been issued
by the state instead of counties, and background checks done by the
Florida Department of Law Enforcement usually involve only a
computer check for felony convictions.
   Since the relaxed requirements of the state law took effect,
thousands of concealed-weapon permits have been issued in South
Florida, where only a few hundred had been issued before.
   The 1987 law pre-empted tough local standards, said state Sen.
Howard Forman.
   ``In Broward County, for example, you had to not only have a job
and an address but your occupation had to be one in which your life
was in danger on a regular basis,'' said Forman, a former Broward
County commissioner. Hollywood is in Broward County.
   Besaraba, 44, is being held in lieu of $1 million bail after his
decision on Thursday to fight extradition to Florida. He was
arrested Wednesday as he lunged for the suspected murder weapon in
a car stolen from the shooting scene, police said.
   Florida has issued an arrest warrant on two counts of
first-degree murder and one count of attempted first-degree murder.
He could face the death penalty if convicted of first degree murder.
   He is facing Nebraska felony charges of attempted assault on a
police officer and possession of stolen property.
   Keith County Attorney Deborah Gilg offered to drop the charges
if Besaraba would accept extradition to Florida. If convicted of
the Nebraska charges, he faces a maximum of 20 years in jail and a
$25,000 fine, said Judge C.G. Wallace of Kimball County, who
presided over the Keith County Court hearing.
   Wallace scheduled an Aug. 22 preliminary hearing.
   Besaraba has long been a gun fancier, said his father, Joseph
Alexander Besaraba Sr., 69, of New York City.
   The elder Besaraba said his son had been arrested several times
and had been convicted of a crime in Boston several years ago, but
he was uncertain of details. Police said a national crime computer
system showed that Besaraba had no criminal record.

<HEAD>Report: Prostitute Tells of Party At Australian Embassy</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A prostitute who worked for an escort service
under federal investigation says she had sexual encounters with
several men last November in a room with ``office-type
furniture''at the Australian Embassy, the Washington Times reported
today.
   An embassy spokesman said an internal investigation was launched
three weeks ago when the newspaper first questioned officials about
the woman's story but has developed no evidence to corroborate her
account.
   ``We have not been able to corroborate this story and with the
processes we have in place we would have expected to have found
something if such a gathering took place,'' spokesman Brett Bayly
told The Associated Press.
   He said all guests have to sign into the building and would need
an escort to enter non-public areas.
   Bayly said embassy officials were continuing their investigation
and ``have been in touch with American authorities.'' He declined
to be more specific when asked to identify the U.S. officials or
agencies that had been contacted.
   The Times said the woman also provided accounts of paid sexual
encounters with a Canadian diplomat and a soldier who also acted as
a bodyguard to Washington lobbyist and host Craig J. Spence and the
newspaper said it was able to confirm these accounts.
   The Times had previously identified Spence as a major client of
a homosexual prostitution ring that allegedly involved the escort
service for which the prostitute said she worked.
   The U.S. attorney's office in Washington reportedly is
investigating credit card fraud involving escort services.
   According to the Times, the woman said she and the two other
prostitutes had sex with at least three men each at the Australian
embassy and that she was paid $800 in ``crisp, new $100 bills''
after the party. The newspaper said the woman asked not to be
identified.
   Kunjurit Singh, who operates Jet Set escort service, confirmed
to the Times that his agency employed the three women last
November. Singh said he would not release details of clients and
said the agency does not condone and is not aware of any illegal
sexual activities by its employees.
   The newspaper said the woman provided a detailed description of
the embassy party. She said the men ``took me one at a time'' into
a room ``which was like an office, it had office-type furniture.''
   She said the men did not identify themselves.
   The newspaper said it questioned embassy officials about the
woman's account on July 6 and was told officials would investigate.
It said the embassy's minister for congressional liaison, John
McCarthy, later told the newspaper that the internal investigation
had found the woman's story ``improbable,'' although it had not
ruled out the possibility that such a party was held.
   ``The embassy's investigations produced no corroboration of the
allegations,'' said a report on the review.
   The Times said the woman provided a list of embassy officials
who she said were clients, including a Canadian diplomat who
initially denied and then confirmed his involvement. The newspaper
did not identify the official but quoted him as saying his personal
life was ``none of the newspaper's business.''

   A man who was a target of a freeway
sniper sped after the suspect and then watched in horror as the
gunman pulled alongside another auto and shot the driver to death,
police said.
   Charlie A. Stevens, 20, of Oakland, was booked on one charge
each of murder and attempted murder after the witness identified
him as the gunman in the shootings early Thursday, said Lt. Mike
Sims.
   Raymond August, 28, of Oakland, died of multiple bullet wounds
in the attack, which occurred about two miles from where
36-year-old Lori Anne Rochon was fatally wounded July 6 as she
drove on the freeway.
   The witness, a 24-year-old Oakland man who asked police not to
release his name, said the gunman shot at him from a passing car
and missed.
   The witness turned off his headlights and followed the suspect
to a freeway exit and then called police.
   Officers spotted a car parked near the freeway that fit the
description provided by the witness, Sims said.

<TEXT>
   The Mississippi School for the Deaf has
its first deaf superintendent, a move applauded by critics who said
reported abuse could have been prevented if the administration were
more sensitive to students' needs.
   Michael Finneran, vocational principal at the California School
for the Deaf in Fremont, said Thursday that getting the job
achieves a near lifelong goal.
   ``This has really fulfilled my dream _ I've wanted to be a
superintendent since I was a little boy,'' Finneran, 41, said
through an interpreter, his 14-year-old daughter Clara.
   The state Board of Education offered Finneran the
$49,000-per-year post last week. He is to begin in mid-August.
   ``I don't think there's any question that this will be a big
boost,'' said Walter Moore, associate superintendent for programs
at the state Department of Education. ``I think the deaf community
will respond very favorably.''
   Finneran inherits a school on the rebound from months of scandal
that led to the ouster of longtime Superintendent Alma Alexander in
January.
   Hinds County Youth Court officials ruled in December that 21
students had been abused or neglected and mandated sweeping changes
in the organization of the 135-year-old school.

   A onetime top aide to former HUD Secretary
Samuel Pierce failed to appear today before a congressional panel
investigating abuses in housing programs, and the chairman said he
will seek to subpoena the witness.
   Lance Wilson, former executive assistant to Pierce, did not
appear as scheduled today before the House Government Operations
subcommittee on employment and housing.
   Rep. Tom Lantos, D-Calif., chairman of the subcommittee, on
Thursday turned down a request by Wilson for a postponement.
Wilson, now a first vice president at Paine Webber brokerage in New
York, said his attorney was in the hospital.
   It was the third time Wilson had asked for an extension, Lantos
said.
   ``There are certain questions that I want to ask Mr. Wilson with
respect to his request for a postponement,'' Lantos said. ``With
186 attorneys listed on the law firm's letterhead, could another
attorney not be able to advise Mr. Wilson, who is himself an
attorney, as to his constitutional rights?''
   Lantos said the subcommittee will vote Wednesday on issuing a
subpoena for Wilson to appear Sept. 27 and to produce ``all
relevant documents and records.''
   Lantos also read aloud a letter from HUD Inspector General Paul
A. Adams detailing his office's unsuccessful attempts to persuade
Wilson to answer questions for an investigation of HUD's moderate
rehabilitation program.
   Wilson would have been questioned today about his involvement in
several projects through a development group led by Philip Winn,
former assistant secretary of housing and current ambassador to
Switzerland, Lantos said.
   Appearing before the panel today was Joseph D. Monticciolo,
HUD's former New York regional administator.
   The panel planned to question him about his involvement in HUD
projects in White Plains, N.Y., and Puerto Rico, Lantos said.
   Wilson, 41, served as Pierce's top aide from 1981-84. He was
succeeded by Deborah Gore Dean, whom he recommended. Dean has cited
her Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination for
refusing to testify before the panel.
   After leaving HUD, Wilson worked at the New York City Housing
Development Corp., a group that raised money through bond issues
for low- and moderate-income housing development.
   Wilson also has been revealed as the owner or developer of six
projects that received HUD rehabilitation funds after he left the
agency.
   Monticciolo, a 51-year-old architect from Woodbury, N.Y., was
regional administrator from 1981-88, overseeing HUD programs in New
York, New Jersey, Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands.
   Since January 1988, he has been chief executive of Eagle Capital
Group, a real estate development company whose partners benefited
handsomely a result of Monticciolo's recommendations as
administrator, according to records and published reports.
   He was offered the $125,000-a-year job in 1987 by Sheldon
Goldstein, a wealthy Rockland County, N.Y., developer, the
company's lawyer told New York Newsday last month.
   Government records and published reports reveal that most
members of Eagle were involved in a Goldstein-led investment group
that bought seven housing projects from HUD in 1983. The group put
up $550,000 in cash, selling the projects three years later at an
estimated $17 million profit.
   On his last financial disclosure form filed with the federal
government a month after his retirement, Monticciolo listed a 15
percent ownership in Eagle. He did not place a monetary value on
his share.
   Eagle's 10 initial investors put up a total of $500,000 to
launch the company, Newsday reported. Monticciolo kicked in just
``several hundred dollars,'' the paper said.

<TEXT>
   The crippled oil tanker Exxon Valdez is still
aiming for a Sunday arrival in San Diego Bay, but the war of words
between state officials and Exxon isn't over.
   The Valdez, which spilled 11 million gallons of crude oil after
slamming into a reef in Alaska, must pass final navigational and
environmental tests before being allowed into the bay for extensive
repairs at the National Steel and Shipbuilding Co., Coast Guard Lt.
Larry Solberg said Thursday.
   The ship will be required to execute a series of maneuvers
offshore to simulate what it will have to do once inside the harbor
and it also must pass a final underwater inspection when it reaches
the mouth of the bay.
   A series of suspicious oily spills and other problems off the
California coast caused state officials to halt the Exxon Valdez so
tests could be conducted and emergency repairs could be made.
   ``Test results confirm that recent slicks that were reported in
the vicinity of the Valdez ... could not have come from the
Valdez,'' Frank Iarossi, president of Exxon Shipping Co., said
Thursday in a statement.
   State environmental officials said Iarossi was mistaken.
   ``I have not seen any results that indicate that,'' said Lt.
Reed Smith, pollution-response coordinator for the California
Department of Fish and Game.
   ``I'm quite concerned that we have a company that has had
releases of oil from its ship and which denies having releases.
That heightens my concern.''
   Smith said his department and the Coast Guard have gathered
evidence of three separate releases of oil from the Exxon Valdez
since it arrived off the coast of San Diego.
   Exxon officials said following the devastating oil spill in
Alaska that the Valdez was oil-free and that towing it southward
presented no threat to the environment.
   Among stipulations of an agreement reached Wednesday with Exxon
was one requiring it to have no discharges for 24 hours before any
attempt to enter the bay.
   The Valdez has been about 50 miles offshore for the past two
weeks since the Coast Guard ordered it away from the bay until any
leakage problems were solved.
   Exxon has put up $20 million to guarantee the Valdez's
performance in the bay and to cover the costs of a cleanup should a
spill occur.

<HEAD>First Arab Israeli Consul General to Leave Atlanta</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The only Arab ever to head an Israeli diplomatic
mission is leaving his post as consul general in Atlanta.
   Mohammed Khalid Massarwa, 46, said Thursday that the Israeli
Foreign Ministry told him his two-year term would not be extended
because the ministry was considering closing the Atlanta consulate.
   An Israeli Embassy spokesman in Washington, David Peleg, said
there are no immediate plans to close the consulate. He would not
discuss the reasons for not extending Massarwa's appointment.
   Much of Atlanta's Jewish community supported Massarwa as
evidence of Israel's commitment to pluralistic democracy.
   ``First and foremost, I thought it was terrific to have him
here,'' said Harriet Zimmerman, a vice president of the American
Israel Public Affairs Committee. ``I have a lot of respect for
him.''
   But critics who campaigned for Massarwa's return to Israel said
the ministry is dismissing him because of his comments favoring a
Palestinian homeland.
   Jay Starkman, leader of a ``Massarwa Must Go'' campaign, also
said an Arab could not properly represent the Jewish state.
   Israeli Foreign Minister Moshe Arens had denounced Massarwa for
comments he made last summer in a speech to the Atlanta chapter of
the United Nations Association. Two Israeli newspapers reported in
September that Massarwa said allowing the Palestinians to establish
a homeland might solve Israel's security problems.
   Massarwa's statement conflicted with the policy of Israel's
governing Likud bloc. The rival Labor Party was responsible for
Massarwa's appointment in 1987.

<TEXT>
   The House Rules Committee has rejected an
amendment that would tie the future of some military bases to an
audit, a measure that some lawmakers hoped would keep their
installations open.
   The move means the amendment will likely be dropped next week
when the military construction bill is considered by the House.
   The committee, which sets the ground rules for votes on the
House floor, said Thursday that the amendment violated rules that
bar ``legislating'' in spending bills.
   The committee, however, delivered a victory to supporters of the
Presidio, a San Franciso base that has been ordered to close.
   When the military construction bill goes to a floor vote,
lawmakers will be allowed to offer an amendment that would keep the
base open.
   ``As you can see, a little favoritism was played by the Rules
Committee,'' said Rep. Ed Madigan, R-Ill., whose district includes
Chanute Air Force Base, one of several that was covered by the
amendment rejected by the Rules Committee.
   Madigan said he will ask lawmakers to defeat the rules when the
military construction bill comes up next week, but he added: ``I
don't think that effort will be successful.''
   The amendment, as approved by the Appropriations Committee on
Wednesday, would have prevented the government from closing some
bases unless a audit found the savings to the Pentagon over six
years exceeds the cost of closure or reorganization.
   These bases, ordered to close or reorganize, were affected by
the Rules Committee action:
   George AFB, Mather AFB, Norton AFB, and Hunters Point Naval
Station, all in California; Pease AFB in New Hampshire; Fort
Sheridan and Chanute AFB in Illinois; Jefferson Proving Ground in
Indiana; Fort Dix in New Jersey; Lexington Army Depot in Kentucky;
Fort Meade and Fort Holabird in Maryland; Fort Devens in
Massachusetts; and Fort Huachuca in Arizona.

<HEAD>Black New Orleans Catholics Already Incorporate Culture Into Worship</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARY FOSTER</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>NEW ORLEANS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The pianist pounds the keys to a ragtime beat
as the choir members, dressed in white, hit the center isle,
clapping and singing.
   ``Here I am in the service one more time,'' the choir sings as
worshipers pick up the beat and join in.
   ``Yes Lord, here I am,'' shouts an elderly woman as ``Amen!''
resounds throughout the church.
   The scene varies little from that at the black Baptist church
around the corner. But this is the 10:30 Gospel Mass at St. Monica
Catholic Church.
   The priest and the congregation are mindful of a controversy in
Washington, D.C., where the Rev. George Stallings Jr. has accused
the Catholic Church of failing its parishioners.
   ``If they could be with us today, all those people worrying
about what's going on in Washington would know we've already united
our heritage and our faith,'' the Rev. Thaddeus C. Boucree tells
the St. Monica congregation.
   Stallings wants to form an African-American Catholic Rite, which
he says would still be part of the Catholic Church. He was
suspended by the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Washington after
holding services with what he says is a brand of Catholicism that
better serves blacks.
   But in New Orleans, several mostly black Catholic churches have
already adapted the Mass to fit their style of worship, combining
gospel music and revival-style preaching with the traditional
Catholic liturgy.
   ``We worship God not just from the eyebrows to the top of the
head. We worship with our whole bodies,'' Boucree said.
   Louisiana's seven dioceses have more black Catholics per capita
than any other state. In the New Orleans Archdiocese, there are
100,000 black Catholics. One of the reasons Pope Paul II visited
the city in September 1987 was to speak to black Catholic leaders.
   With all the options to adapt the Mass now available to priests,
the Rev. Kenneth J. Hedrick, director of the Office of Worship for
the New Orleans Archdiocese, said he is not sure how much farther
Stallings wants to go.
   ``I think you can see from the black churches in New Orleans the
current liturgy is easily adaptable to any culture, not just the
black culture. You can use nonsecular readings, but you can
certainly make use of many kinds of religious music and writings,''
he said.
   But Stallings has his supporters among New Orleans black
Catholics. The Rev. Glenn V. Jeanmarie, pastor of St. Theresa of
the Child Jesus, said Stallings' call for change goes deeper than
the liturgy.
   ``What Rev. Stallings is saying is for effective and true
evangelism to take place in a community not only cultural needs but
aspirations must also be addressed. Just as you have an Eastern
Rite, you should have an African-American Rite. Basically we're
talking about respecting the leadership of black Americans,'' he
said.
   Jeanmarie said the rite would not mean a split in the church.
   ``It's a myth to say this will create division when in reality
there already exists in America and in the church a division
because of racism. This is a way to address that racism,''
Jeanmarie said.
   Boucree said most black Catholics will be faithful to the
existing Catholic church.
   ``There will not be a separate church formed. This is the most
effective melting pot in the world. All of us are so mixed,'' he
said. ``We fight for the blackness because it is so oppressed, but
we have so much of the rest of the world in us we can never go our
separate way.''

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The band around Adnan Khashoggi's right ankle is
the size of a snazzy Rolex watch, but it's Khashoggi who is being
watched, not the time.
   Khashoggi was released Thursday on $10 million bail on condition
he wear the black band that will keep tabs on his whereabouts.
   ``It's not the be-all, end-all panacea _ but it's the hottest
thing in the business,'' Michael Mahoney, executive director of the
Chicago-based John Howard Association, a prison watchdog group,
said Thursday.
   Khashoggi, who is being tried in U.S. District Court in
Manhattan, is charged with mail fraud and obstruction of justice
for allegedly helping Ferdinand and Imelda Marcos plunder the
Philippine treasury.
   After his release Thursday, he was driven to an apartment he
owns in the luxury Olympic Towers building on Fifth Avenue.
   The duplex apartment, featured in House &amp; Garden magazine in
1984, was carved out of 16 apartments and contains such amenities
as a swimming pool in a two-story atrium, a sauna, a 7-by-10-foot
bed covered in sable, marble floors, and Cartier knickknacks.
   Khashoggi, once one of the world's richest men, submitted
documents to the court last week indicating a net worth of $53.8
million.
   The Wristlet, the brand of bracelet Khashoggi wears, is around
his right ankle, according to the U.S. Marshal's office. Here's how
it works: Computerized telephone calls will come randomly into his
apartment.
   A computerized voice will tell him he has 30 or 60 seconds to
touch his device with a flashlight-like wand attached to the
telephone, according to Marc Renzema, associate professor of
criminal justice at Kutztown University in Pennsylvania, who knows
the device.
   A code will decide if this is Khashoggi; he will state his name
and the conversation will be taped, said Renzema.
   Khashoggi is restricted to the court's jurisdiction _ Manhattan,
the Bronx and the northern suburbs. However, the company that
operates the Wristlet said it had not gotten instructions to set up
another telephone device to monitor the defendant outside his home.
   If the signal is lost for a certain period of time, ``It phones
home and says Mr. Khashoggi or whomever is not home any more, send
out the SWAT team,'' Renzema said.
   In 1988, nearly 2,300 offenders were using electronic monitoring
devices in 33 states, about three times the number using them a
year earlier, according to Department of Justice statistics.
   This year, 5,400 offenders in 37 states and Puerto Rico are
making their presences known electronically, according to Renzema.
   Offenders given the opportunity to use the devices, Renzema
said, are ``white-collar offenders, people they are not worried are
going to rape and kill.''
   Renzema said most of those using the devices are on probation.
An additional 1,200 to 1,300 are on work furloughs or early release
who would be charged with escape if they miss a beep.
   Enthusiasm for the monitoring devices is high and growing,
Mahoney said, mainly because ``for the most part it works.''
   But if a convicted drug dealer is released with a band and gets
busy racking up sales, the device simply answers the question of
where the inmate is: ``All it means is he's in the home.''

<TEXT>
   A governing party elder today took himself out of
the running to be Japan's next prime minister, strengthening the
chance that the party's youngest ever secretary-general will reach
the nation's highest office.
   The scandal-plagued Liberal Democrats formally decided today to
choose a new leader Aug. 8 in a vote by the party's members of
Parliament and seek his approval in Parliament Aug. 10, party
officials said.
   The secretary-general, Ryutaro Hashimoto, is in charge of the
search for a successor to Prime Minister Sousuke Uno, who announced
his resignation to take responsibility for the Liberal Democrats'
unprecedented defeat in parliamentary elections on Sunday.
   Former Deputy Prime Minister Shin Kanemaru, 75, who had been
viewed as opposing the 51-year-old Hashimoto, today said he had no
intention to be prime minister.
   Speculation centered on Hashimoto, whose star has been rising
fast in the conservative party in the past two months while Uno's
leadership was cut short by an influence-peddling scandal and
allegations he paid a geisha for sex.
   Hashimoto's chances were further bolstered when former Finance
Minister Kiichi Miyazawa, who controls the third largest faction in
the party, also said he preferred to have an ``young and
progressive'' person to head the party and the government.
   Uno announced his resignation after Sunday elections in which
his party lost control of the 252-member upper house of Parliament
for the first time in its 34 years.
   The party has a majority in the more powerful lower house of
Parliament, which chooses the prime minister.
   A party official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said
``leaders seem to be trying to build consensus within the party
over Hashimoto and I have not heard anyone express strong
opposition so far.''
   But, he said, some party elders insist it is ``premature for the
party to give power to such a young politician in such a turbulent
time.''
   For decades, Japan's prime ministers have been men in their
middle 60s or older who reached the office after a serving a series
of increasingly important Cabinet and party posts. Hashimoto, in
Parliament since he was 26, has not held top Cabinet posts. He rose
to the No. 2 party post in June.
   Uno was virtually handpicked by former Prime Minister Noboru
Takeshita two months ago, after Takeshita resigned to take
responsibility for a widespread influence-peddling scandal that
touched much of the party's top leadership.
   Officials of the Japan Socialist Party, which seeks to form a
coalition with three small centrist parties against the governing
party, said it would ask them to support Socialist leader Takako
Doi in the prime ministerial election in Parliament.

   ``It's just becoming an unduly great issue considering the fact
the pollen is relatively insignificant in terms of our total
counts,'' said Mark Sneller, who runs the Pima County Health
Department's pollen- and mold-detecting programs.
   He said Thursday he would include marijuana pollen in the
catch-all category of ``others.''
   Since the early 1980s, the pollen of Cannabis sativa, or
marijuana, has appeared on the list, publicized during the spring
and summer to warn the allergy-prone of high pollen levels.
   But in recent years, police and public attention has focused on
the occasionally high marijuana pollen counts around the city.
   ``The growing goes on all the time. That's always there. It's
been there for 20 years,'' Sneller said.

   Retired librarian William Bryan Cruse
received two death sentences today for his shooting rampage at two
shopping plazas that left six people dead and 10 wounded.
   Circuit Judge John Antoon sentenced the 61-year-old Cruse to the
electric chair in the shooting deaths of two police officers who
tried to halt the massacre in nearby Palm Bay, a central Florida
coastal city.
   Antoon added four consecutive sentences of life in prison
without possibility of parole for at least 25 years in the other
shooting deaths and three years on 26 other counts, for a total of
103 years. Parole would be possible only if the death sentences
were overturned.
   Cruse, dressed in a red jail outfit, expressed little reaction
to the proceedings, except he appeared to wipe his eyes at one
point when a shooting victim read a statement before the judge.
   A Polk County jury convicted Cruse last April 5 on 32 counts of
murder, attempted murder and kidnapping in the April 23, 1987
incident.
   Besides the police officers, those killed were an engineer, two
college students from Kuwait and a woman sitting in her car outside
a store.
   In addition to the 10 wounded, the jury found that Cruse tried
to kill 14 other people and held two women hostage inside the
supermarket, where he barricaded himself for more than seven hours
following the shootout.
   Cruse told investigators after he was captured that he ``got
into trouble'' because everybody believed he was homosexual.
   The trial jury rejected arguments from specialists and Cruse's
public defenders that he was temporarily insane because of
delusions brought on by mental illness.
   Although medical experts for both sides agreed that Cruse is
mentally ill, prosecutors argued that under Florida law, mental
illness is only one factor in a legal definition of criminal
insanity.
   Cruse told investigators after his capture that he was ``trying
to get back'' at people who taunted him. He said he was ``drunk and
crazy'' during the shootout.
   Before the sentencing, Public Defender James Russo said he
believed there was little chance that Cruse wouldn't get the death
sentence.
   But he said the frail prisoner might not outlive the state's
lengthy appeal process for death row inmates.
   Cruse has spent most of the time since his arrest in a
single-person cell, eating only a sparse diet of fruit and cereal.
His eating habits were the result of his fears that jailers were
trying to poison him, and he has lost considerable weight and
energy.
   The two officers killed were responding to reports of a wild man
shooting an assault rifle at shoppers and passers-by in the parking
lots of Publix and Winn-Dixie supermarkets across a busy street
from each other.

   Mount McKinley still is North America's
tallest mountain, but it is not as tall as people have been saying
for years.
   Using extremely sensitive gravity meters and satellites,
scientists from the University of Alaska-Anchorage have determined
the mountain is 20,306 feet high.
   That's 14 feet less than what Bradford Washburn calculated in
1954. But it still is 456 feet taller than the runner-up, Mount
Logan in Canada.
   ``I wish it had gone up 14 feet,'' said Jeff Yates, assistant
coordinator of the project. ``It's kind of an intangible thing from
a climber's standpoint. People just like the bigger mountains.''
   A few more measurements might vary the new measurement slightly,
but not more than a foot, Yates said.
   The scientists say that because of its great mass, McKinley
exerts enough gravitational pull to distort standard surveying
techniques like those used by Washburn to calculate the mountain's
height.

<HEAD>Bicyclists Move Over for Skateboarders in Palo Alto</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JENNIFER McNULTY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>PALO ALTO, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Bicyclists spent years training
motorists to share the road in this two-wheeler town, but now they
must make room for a brash new four-wheeled rival: the skateboard.
   The Palo Alto City Council recently approved an ordinance
authorizing skateboards on all but 25 of the city's busiest streets.
   To cyclists who fought for years to develop 45 miles of bicycle
paths, the new law smacks of dashed promises and perilous road
hazards.
   Bicycling has taken on major cultural significance in Palo Alto,
where city employees are reimbursed seven cents per mile for riding
their bikes to work and some corporations provide showers and even
free towels for cycling employees.
   The police department even offers a bicycle traffic school for
juveniles.
   Cyclists reject accusations they're reluctant to share the road
with skateboarders and point instead to their brakes, lights and
reflectors, claiming to be the superior mode of alternative transit
in this affluent, highly-educated community.
   But skateboarders say they know better.
   ``They think they're cars,'' Bobby Angus, 13, of Menlo Park,
said of bicyclists.
   ``They could get out of our way, but no. We have to get out of
their way,'' said 14-year-old Justin Aranda.
   ``People think we want to knock over old ladies, and it's not
true,'' said 14-year-old Mark Nelson of Menlo Park, straddling his
bicycle. ``I stop faster on my board than on my bike. Biking's sort
of lame.''
   Walter Williams, 14, dropped his board to the ground to
demonstrate a ``power slide'' stop, in which sharp, mid-air
maneuvering brought the board to an abrupt halt.
   Many cities simply prohibit skateboard riding.
   In San Francisco, 35 miles north of Palo Alto, skateboarding is
illegal on all roadways and the sidewalks of any business district,
and has been since 1976.
   In Sacramento, police recently painted skateboards next to the
graphics of bicycles and roller skates, both indicating vehicles
already prohibited on pathways in Capitol Park.
   Even the city of Petaluma, about 60 miles north of Palo Alto,
which modified its laws in 1987 to allow skateboarders to use
public streets, still bans skateboarding in shopping centers, on
sidewalks, in parks and after dark without reflectors.
   But in Palo Alto, city councilman Leland Levy has hailed the
skateboard as a ``terrific mode'' of transportation because it's
``small, easy to deal with and you can carry it around with you.''
   Compared to popular multi-speed bicycles that sell for hundreds
and even thousands of dollars, skateboards are a cheap way to get
around, at $150 each for top-of-the-line equipment, and they are
particularly popular with students.
   But this does little to endear cyclists to skateboarding.
   ``I don't care if they're using it for transportation, but when
they start showing off, they take up the road,'' said Ben Brown,
13, of Menlo Park. ``The ones who get obsessed with it, they're the
ones who get in your way.''
   Skateboarders have a long way to go before they will come close
to matching the number of bicyclists, and unlike bicyclists they so
far have no organization to represent them when lobbying the city.
   Dave Uggla of the Palo Alto Bicycle Advisory Committee, formed
by City Council to advise it on issues relating to bicycles,
likened much of the skateboarders' current struggle for respect to
that of cyclists in the early 1970s.
   ``We had a long, hard fight'' to win community awareness, he
said.
   And Bob Noyes, an avid cyclist who commutes three miles each way
to work, warned of the downside of respectability.
   ``There's a rough side to it, too,'' he said. ``You get moving
violations just like a car. I got two for running stop signs.''

   A ferry carrying 200 passengers
collided with a cattle boat on a southern Bangladesh river and
sank, police said Friday, and at least 50 people were feared
drowned.
   The collision occurred Thursday between the ferry M.L. Prince
Boira and the M.V. Leo on the Pangushi River near Bagerhat, about
85 miles south of Dhaka, police said.
   The M.V. Leo was slightly damaged but did not sink, police said.
   Ten bodies had been recovered by Friday.
   A police officer supervising rescue operations said 125
passengers swam ashore and 25 others were rescued by fishermen. The
captains of the boats survived, and they were being questioned by
investigators, he said.

<TEXT>
   India today signed an agreement to
start withdrawing its peacekeeping troops, and at least 74 people
were reported killed in one of the worst days of ethnic violence on
this island nation.
   An Indian official said the pullout would begin Saturday, the
same day that talks would begin in New Delhi to set a timetable for
the withdrawal.
   The troops arrived in Sri Lanka two years ago, and President
Ranasinghe Premadasa had ordered them to be out of the country by
Saturday.
   ``We should be grateful to the government of India for agreeing
to recall the Indian army,'' Premadasa said in a prepared speech
for broadcast over television and radio tonight.
   Indian Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi had said a hasty withdrawal
could lead to more bloodshed on the island, where Tamil rebels are
fighting the Sinhalese-dominated government for a homeland in the
northeast.
   But an Indian Foreign Ministry spokesman, Aftab Seth, said the
two countries signed an agreement in Colombo today to begin pulling
out the estimated 45,000 Indian troops stationed in the region.
   In New Delhi, the Indian government said its troops would begin
pulling out Saturday. The government did not say how many soldiers
were to leave or when the withdrawal is to be completed.
   A Sri Lanaka Foreign Ministry official, speaking on condition of
anonymity, said a seven-member Sri Lankan delegation headed by
Foreign Minister Ranjan Wijeratne would fly to New Delhi Saturday
to start discussing a timetable.
   On Thursday, Wijeratne demanded that before he would travel to
New Delhi, India also would have to accept Premadasa as
commander-in-chief of all forces in Sri Lanka and honor a
cease-fire with the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam, the largest
and the most militant rebel group. But Seth said Wijeratne will
discuss those two conditions when the minister travels to New Delhi.
   Sri Lanka's government clamped a nationwide curfew at midnight
Thursday and posted soldiers and heavily armed policemen in all
major cities. The curfew was extended this evening until 6 a.m.
Sunday.
   Despite the curfew, state-run television said at least 74 people
were killed in ethnic violence and nearly all of the deaths
occurred in the Sinhalese heartland, where extremists oppose
limited autonomy the government has offered to the Tamils and want
all the Indian troops out immediately.
   Sri Lankan television said most of those who died were killed by
Sri Lankan forces in areas where the Indians do not operate. No
other details on the killings were immediately available.
   Indian troops initially were deployed to supervise the July 29,
1987, accord that promised limited self-rule to Sri Lanka's
minority Tamils.
   In exchange, militant Tamils had to agree to surrender their
weapons. While most militias abided by the accord, he Tamil Tigers
backed out and began attacking Indian soldiers. About 1,000 troops
have died.
   After the Tamil Tigers opened peace talks with the Sri Lankan
government on June 1, Premadasa demanded that Indian troops
withdraw. His repeated calls for the withdrawal and Gandhi's
refusals led to fears of an armed confrontation between Indian and
Sri Lankan troops.
   However, Wijeratne ruled out a military clash with the powerful
neighbor in the northeast, saying ``we know our limitations.''
   Sri Lanka's army has about 40,000 troops.
   A leader of the Eelam People's Revolutionary Liberation Front, a
Tamil party that fears genocidal by the Tamil Tigers once the
Indian soldiers leave, said his party can mobilize ``10,000
cadres.''
   But the figure given by Ira Kuganeswaran, a member of
Parliament, is believed by observers to be highly inflated.
Kuganeswaran spoke by telephone from Vavuniya, 135 miles northeast
of Colombo.

   A leader of the rebel Holy Spirit
Movement has surrendered to the government, Radio Uganda reported
Friday.
   Seberino Lukoya, the father of the movement's former warrior
priestess, gave himself up Tuesday to government troops in the
northern Ugandan town of Gulu, the report said.
   The Holy Spirit Movement has concentrated its activities in the
Gulu region since late 1987 when government troops crushed the
rebels' attempts to march on Kampala. The rebels died by the
thousands.
   The rebellion began earlier that year under the leadership of
Alice Lakwena, who convinced her followers to go into war unarmed
and smeared with an oil they believed would ward off bullets.
   Ms. Lakwena fled to Kenya in December 1987, while Holy Spirit
remnants fled north where her father took over its leadership.
   Lukoya said his surrender was a sign the guerrilla warfare
plaguing northern Uganda would soon end, according to Radio Uganda.
   The Holy Spirit Movement is one of several insurgencies fighting
President Yoweri Museveni's 3-year-old government.

   The Soviet Union has proposed that the Japanese
provide technology for a joint project to develop a space aircraft,
Japanese officials said Friday.
   The proposals were made Tuesday when six Soviet officials
visited Japan's National Space Development Agency, an agency
official said.
   The delegates said the Soviet Union is ready to provide Japan
with technology to manufacture the Energia rocket, the world's
largest rocket that is capable of launching an 18-ton payload, or
export to Japan a rocket that can lift a two-ton payload, said the
official, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
   The smaller rocket is priced at about $30 million, according to
the major economic daily Nihon Keizai Shimbun.
   ``We were just amazed at the (Soviet) proposals,'' the agency
official said.
   He said a Soviet delegation visited the government-financed
organization handling Japan's space development and rocket
launching, but never made such ``business-oriented proposals.''
   The latest Soviet offer is considered aimed at obtainining
foreign currency under President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's program of
social and economic reforms, the official said.
   An official of the Science and Technology Agency, who also would
not allow his name to be used, said the Soviet delegates visited
his agency July 17 but put forth no concrete terms regarding joint
projects.
   Japan plans to develop an unmanned spacecraft in the next decade
and eventually wants to send its own astronauts into space aboard
Japanese-made vessels.
   Last month, the Space Development Commission, Japan's highest
government organ supervising Japanese aerospace programs, announced
a 10-year plan that included development of the next-generation H-2
rocket, capable of lifting a two-ton payload.
   To date, Japan has had 19 successful launches with its N- and
H-series rockets, each of them carrying up to 1,200 pounds.
   It has yet to test a two-stage liquid combustion engine to be
used in the H-2 rocket, scheduled to be launched in 1993.
   The Soviet delegates, who came for the opening of a design
exposition, also met July 18 with officials of the Society of
Japanese Aircraft Contractors, a group of 180 Japanese companies
engaged in space-related products manufacturing.
   Western observers say it will not be long until Japan ventures
into the commercial arena to compete in space technology just as it
has in the automobile, computer and electronics markets.

   Flight attendants from United Flight 232 today
described the horror of the DC-10's fiery crash in Sioux City,
Iowa, last week, and the joy at finding so many survivors.
   It was ``a roller-coaster ride with special effects,'' said
flight attendant Timothy Owens, who was seated in the middle of the
plane when it went down.
   He was one of five of the eight Chicago-based crew members who
were aboard the plane when it crashed July 19 who appeared at a
news conference this morning sponsored by their union, the
Association of Flight Attendants.
   Seven of the eight were among the 185 survivors of the crash.
   Association spokeswoman Cindy Yeast said the news conference was
an opportunity for the flight attendants to tell how they were
involved in the crash that killed 111 people.
   Most who spoke were teary-eyed and choked up as they described
the terror of the crash.
   ``The first time we hit, we bounced and I had my eyes open,''
Owens said. ``I saw overhead bins and coils and wires from the
ceiling. ``After that, that's when the tail section of the plane
just split apart and I saw a big beam of sunlight just coming
through the big opening in the back. And that's when we started to
roll over on the right wing.''
   Donna McGrady, one of the flight attendants, said she had her
eyes open as the plane crash-landed.
   ``I said, `Oh, God ....' The important thing that I thought
about was when's it going to stop.''
   McGrady remained belted in her seat as the DC-10's tail section,
where she was located, split off from the rest of the plane and
came to rest.
   ``At that particular time, to come out and to look and to see
nothing but debris...'' she said, her voice breaking. ``I said,
`Oh, God, where is the other part of the aircraft.'''
   Many of the at least 75 United employees in the audience at the
news conference dabbed at tears as McGrady told of the aftermath of
the crash, and her happiness at seeing survivors emerge.
   ``I said, `Thank you, Jesus, for the things that you've done for
us because we know there's no other way we could have made it
without your presence,'' she said.
   The head flight attendant on the plane, Janice Brown, said she
could not think of anything the flight attendants could have done
to save more people, and could not explain why those who survived
did while others died.
   ``I'm not going to second-guess God,'' Brown said.
   The crowd at a ballroom at O'Hare International Airport gave a
standing ovation to the five flight attendants from Flight 232, as
well as three of their colleagues who assisted on the ground. One
crew member and a flight attendant who was on board the plane but
not on duty at the time remain hospitalized. The eighth member of
the original crew, flight attendant Rene Le Beau, was killed in the
crash.
   After the news conference, United employees held a memorial
service for Le Beau and for four other United employees who were
aboard but off-duty and died in the crash.

<HEAD>Remains of British Soldier Stolen From Museum For Burial</HEAD>

<DATELINE>SCHAGEN, Netherlands (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Skeletal remains believed to be
those of a British soldier killed in a World War I battle were
stolen from a museum by a Dutch veteran who says he's seeking an
honorable burial for the man.
   Draped in a vintage British military coat and posed in a trench
mock-up, the skull and left leg bones formed the centerpiece of the
Somme Museum. The private collection of war memorabilia is devoted
to the 1916 battle by the same name that killed more than 1 million
British, French and German soldiers.
   John Bluming, who served in the Dutch contingent in the Korean
War, said in a telephone interview Friday that he walked into the
museum Tuesday, wrapped the remains in a Union Jack and spirited
them away for eventual burial with military honors.
   ``It isn't right for some imbecile to charge money just so you
can see the remains of a dead soldier,'' said Bluming, who added he
had handed the bones over to a former British commando for transfer
to the British authorities. He refused to identify the commando.
   The episode has pitted the French-born owner of the Somme Museum
against the British Embassy, the British Commonwealth War Graves
Commission and others who thought the exhibit was in just plain bad
taste.
   Museum owner Sembeau Lecocq said he found the skull and bones in
a trench near the village of Thiepval in the Somme district about
25 years ago and decided to take them home for use in the exhibit
housed in a castle in this northern Dutch town.
   Lecocq said he dubbed the bones ``Soldier John'' because he had
found some British uniform buttons nearby and assumed the remains
to be those of a British soldier.
   Surrounded by stuffed rats, rusty rifles and dented helmets,
``Soldier John'' became part of a trench exhibit meant to underline
the hardships endured by soldiers in World War I.
   Earlier this month, the newspaper De Telegraaf published an
article about the museum, including a picture of the bones of
``Soldier John.''
   Bluming said that spurred him to action because the bones ``just
didn't belong'' in the museum.
   Bluming said he had taken the law into his own hands as a
gesture of gratitude to the British for their part in the
liberation of the Netherlands from Nazi occupation in 1945.
   But he added, ``I'd have done the same thing for a German.''
   British Embassy spokesman Brian Bennett said the Commonwealth
War Graves Commission had been negotiating for permission to bury
the remains since 1985 but added an initial deal with Lecocq had
fallen through.
   The commission, based in the Belgian city of Ypres, looks after
the graves of British, Australian, Canadian and other commonwealth
soldiers buried in Europe after both world wars.
   ``It's most unfortunate,'' Bennett said. ``We would like to take
possession of the remains and give them an honorable burial'' near
the northern French site where they were found.
   He added such a funeral would require permission from the Dutch
government and that the remains had not been handed over to the
embassy.
   The Netherlands was neutral in World War I, but there are dozens
of exhibits like the Somme Museum in Belgium and France. Those
include the Verdun Ossuary near that northeastern French city,
where hundreds of thousands of bones are on display.

   A breeze of change has begun to blow through the
Imperial Palace since Emperor Akihito took the throne. But change
doesn't come easily to a 1,200-year-old monarchy.
   To most of the nation, Akihito remains a distant figure seen
only through the bits of news gathered by a small group of
reporters who cover the daily activities of the royal family from
offices behind the Tokyo palace's moat and high stone walls.
   That news, however, has portrayed the man on the Chrysanthemum
Throne in a softer, more personable light than his enigmatic
father, Hirohito, who died Jan. 7.
   ``He is a more democratic person than his father was, because
they were raised in a different era,'' said one palace reporter,
who has covered both emperors. ``He really wants to get out among
the people, and has surprised some attendants by suddenly changing
his schedule to do so.''
   Such comparisons between Hirohito, who was revered as a god
until the end of World War II, and Akihito _ the first emperor to
assume the throne not as a deity but as a man _ have dominated
Akihito's seven-month reign.
   On his first trip away from the capital, Akihito used a less
regal form of speech than his father when addressing a crowd and
insisted on fewer uniformed guards along procession routes, though
more plainclothes police were deployed.
   The 55-year-old emperor reportedly even asked for the removal of
a curtain separating himself and Empress Michiko from other
passengers on a chartered flight to the tree-planting festival in
late May.
   ``I think it's fine. ... The imperial household must adapt to
historical developments,'' said Prince Mikasa, Akihito's uncle and
the oldest male member of the imperial family. The 74-year-old
spoke in a rare interview with the Yomiuri Shimbun, Japan's largest
newspaper.
   Akihito shocked traditionalists in 1959, while still crown
prince, when he married a commoner, a union warmly welcomed by the
Japanese public.
   The royal couple then broke with the past by raising their two
sons and daughter by themselves. Akihito was sent off to be reared
by chamberlains at the age of 3.
   More changes were expected after the death of Hirohito, 87,
whose 62-year reign covered a tumultuous period of history many
Japanese still struggle to understand.
   During his reign _ the longest in Japanese history _ Japan waged
a disastrous war in Asia, suffered a humiliating defeat against the
Allies in 1945 and rose from the ashes of its bombed-out cities to
become a modern economic superpower.
   His death was the end of an era. But it remains difficult for
Akihito to make major changes in an institution that can trace its
roots back to at least the 8th century and by legend to Emperor
Jimmu in 660 B.C.
   Akihito's first news conference, open to 50 selected foreign and
Japanese reporters, is scheduled for Aug. 4, seven months after he
became emperor. It is likely to be as formal as those his father
used to hold.
   Like Hirohito, who met with the foreign and Japanese news media
in several such encounters, Akihito will answer only a set of
questions submitted in advance and negotiated with palace officials
for several weeks.
   The meeting is expected to last less than an hour and cover
questions such as those Hirohito accepted from reporters: the war,
his role in modern Japan, palace life, whether things are likely to
change.
   A a handful of chamberlains, personal doctors, nurses and
ritualists continues to surround the emperor.
   Most of Hirohito's chamberlains continue to carry out palace
duties of some sort, and disagreements between the Akihito and
Hirohito camps are not uncommon, the palace reporter said,
requesting that he not be identified by name.
   The chamberlains, themselves often descended from nobility or
illustrious families, are known to oppose innovation, even by
younger chamberlains, as many see themselves as the protectors of
tradition.
   ``It will take at least 10 years for the new emperor to come
into his own,'' the reporter said.
   Little change is expected in the daily rituals carried out at
three shrines on the palace's wooded grounds.
   Ritualists dressed in traditional robes and headwear present
offerings of food and wine at the shrines _ dedicated to the gods
in general, the imperial ancestors and the sun goddess, Amaterasu,
from whom Japan's royal line is said to have descended.
   Hirohito renounced his divinity as a ``false concept'' at the
urging of the U.S.-led occupation forces in 1946, and a new
constitution, omitting passages stating that the emperor had a
special relationship to the gods, was drafted in 1947.
   The 1947 constitution also put an end to state backing of
Shinto, Japan's indigenous religion, which had been transformed
from a kind of nature worship into an emperor-centered form of
nationalism by a military government seeking to fuel its war
machine.
   But just before Hirohito's death, senior ritualist Toshinobu
Maeda said the renunciation of divinity did not affect palace
rites, and neither would Akihito's accession.
   Since the revised constitution took effect, the ritualists have
been the private employees of the emperor instead of being in
government pay.
   Fear of stirring up the state-religion controversy has delayed a
government announcement of where another rite, the Daijo-sai, will
be held.
   During that mystical ceremony, which will be held in November
1990, the emperor traditionally has had his first communion with
Amaterasu and then be reborn a god. News reports have said staging
the complex Daijo-sai could cost as much as $70 million.
   Tokyo has apparently been chosen for security reasons, but
officials refuse to publicly rule out Kyoto, the ancient capital in
western Japan where the imperial family resided for more than a
millenium.

<HEAD>Congressman Suggests Tax Break for Developing Space Products</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   U.S. industry could be encouraged to invest in
space research if the federal government would allow companies a
decade of tax-free income from products developed in orbit, Rep.
Robert S. Walker suggested Friday.
   Walker, ranking Republican on the House Science, Space and
Technology Committee, said that such a tax incentive would be one
way for the United States to maintain world leadership in space
during an era when the federal budget may be unable to finance such
research.
   ``If you told manufacturers that if you develop a product in
space and bring it back to Earth and sell it, then you can market
it for 10 years tax free'' it would encourage industry to invest in
space research, Walker said at a breakfast for reporters.
   ``It would cost us (the federal government) absolutely nothing
to give this kind of incentive'' because there currently are no
such products being made and sold, the Pennsylvania Republican said.
   Walker said the tax incentive is one way for the nation to
encourage the development of research and manufacturing in space
without the government having to finance all of the effort.
   He said there already are ideas that could be researched in
orbit, but companies are reluctant to make the high investment
required. For instance, said Walker, a firm in Pennsylvania has
proposed a plan to grown human nerve tissue in orbit and then
return it Earth where it could be transplanted into humans with
optic nerve blindness.
   Walker said the nerve tissue cannot be grown on Earth because
gravity distorts the cell structure. But in the weightlessness of
orbit this is not a problem.
   Industry, he said, also could be encouraged to develop new
booster rockets if the government, particularly the military, would
assure manufacturers that commercial launch services would be used
to put NASA and Air Force satellites into orbit.
   Such assurances, said Walker, could lead to the commercial
development of what he called ``a big, dumb booster'' _ a simple,
but powerful, rocket, built with current technology, that could put
large satellites into orbit routinely.
   He said that instead of encouraging the commercial production of
simple ``big, dumb booster'' rockets, the military and NASA are
attempting to persuade Congress to finance new generations of
rockets that would require government-financed development.

<TEXT>
   President Victor Paz Estenssoro is to
step down on Aug. 6, but there is no leader waiting in the wings to
assume control of this impoverished nation of 6.9 million people.
   No party won an absolute majority in May 7 elections and the top
three vote-getters have been unable to choose the next president.
   Uncertainty over who will be Bolivia's 77th president has raised
political and economic tensions in this impoverished nation of 6.9
million.
   In May, voters chose among nine presidential candidates.
   Gonzalo Sanchez de Lozada, candidate for the governing
Revolutionary Nationalist Movement, won a relative majority with 24
percent of the vote. Former military dictator Gen. Hugo Banzer
Suarez of the conservative Nationalist Democratic Action Party
trailed Sanchez de Lozada by just 1 percent and Jaime Paz Zamora of
the Social Democratic Movement of the Revolutionary Left, won 19
percent of the vote.
   According to the constitution, the president must be elected
from the top three parties by a new congress chosen according to
the percentage of popular votes each party received.
   A presidential candidate must receive 79 congressional votes to
be elected. Sanchez de Lozada party's has 49, Banzer's party has 46
and Paz Zamora's party, 41.
   The new congress is scheduled to meet Aug. 4 and should elect a
president in time for the Aug. 6 inauguration. But three leading
candidates have been unable to form an alliance to provide
sufficient congressional votes to elect a president.
   Earlier this week, Roman Catholic bishops mediated negotiations
between Banzer, Sanchez de Lozada and Paz Zamora and the three
candidates signed a declaration promising congress will choose a
new president by Aug. 6.
   In recent weeks, Paz Zamora's left-of-center party negotiated
its support for Banzer in return for the presidency of Congress and
regional development corporations. Leaders in Zamora's party,
however, broke ranks and refused to support Banzer, who persecuted
them during his 1971 to 1978 dictatorship.
   Sanchez de Lozada, 59, offered Paz Zamora a major role in the
government in exchange for his support. Sanchez de Lozada also said
that his party would back Paz Zamora for president after his four
year term ended.
   Paz Zamora, 50, has not yet responded to Sanchez de Lozada's
proposal.
   Business leaders have asked the three candidates to resolve
their differences out of concern for the conflict's impact on the
economy.
   Banks have frozen the disbursement of loans, and businesses
report a slowdown in the economy. In response to the political
crisis, citizens have also pulled millions of dollars in deposits
from banks.
   Despite an uncertainty over who will be the next president,
however, the government has managed to keep a lid on inflation and
maintain the confidence of foreign governments and lending
organizations. Inflation since January is running at 5 percent, one
of the lowest rates in South America.
   The U.S. government also granted Bolivia a $100 million loan to
shore up the economy.
   The three candidates have said that if elected president, they
will maintain the basic elements of the government's free market
economic program, which managed to halt 24,000 percent inflation in
1985.
   The economy is expected to expand by at least 3 percent this
year, the first real growth in more than a decade.
   After presidential elections in 1979 and 1980, a similar
stalemate resulted in bloody military coups.
   Today, however, the military high command is supportive of the
democratic process and there are no rumblings from the barracks.
   The Aug. 6 swearing-in would be the first time in 25 years that
a civilian president has completed his term and turned over the
presidency to a democratically elected government.

   A ``goddess of democracy'' will again be erected
in Tiananmen Square despite a bloody crackdown on demonstrators
there by the Chinese military, a leader of the Chinese
pro-democracy movement said today.
   ``Some say China has no hope for democracy, but I say the hope
is just beginning,'' said Wu'er Kaixi, 21, an organizer of the
student demonstrations in Beijing, at the opening session of a
weekend Chinese Student Congress in the United States.
   ``I believe the Chinese can be united and will erect a goddess
of democracy in Tiananmen Square one day,'' he said.
   Such a ``goddess,'' made of plaster and fashioned after the
Statue of Liberty, had been erected in the square by the
demonstrating students before the military moved in on June 4.
   More than 300 people attended today's the session at the
University of Illinois-Chicago. Students or teachers from 150 U.S.
schools were expected.
   T-shirts being sold at the gathering included some depicting a
man blocking a line of tanks in Beijing's central square. The
statement ``You are not alone'' is printed on the shirts.
   Wu'er, speaking in Chinese, took aim at his homeland's
government.
   ``If the present communist government is so confident that
people love them, why should they be scared of elections?'' he
asked. ``Because there is a chance they may end up in history's
wastebasket.''
   Wu'er and Yan Jiaqui, 47, a political scientist, fled China
after the military crushed protests. They surfaced in Paris, where
they have been trying to rally worldwide support for the
pro-democracy movement in their homeland.
   They came to Chicago for the weekend strategy session, and both
were among a dozen people on stage at today's meeting, despite
earlier reports that they feared for their safety.
   ``I can no longer be afraid,'' Wu'er said Thursday night.
   ``I've already said what I have to do is to carry forward the
cause of those who died,'' he said on the ABC News program
``Nightline.''
   Wu'er, speaking from a television studio in Chicago, said on
``Nightline'' that conditions in China have grown more dangerous in
recent weeks as the government continues its crackdown on students
who led demonstrations in Beijing and other Chinese cities.
   ``I'm not sure anyone else will be able to come out,'' he said
of other student dissidents. ``But those who manage to come out
should carry forward the tasks that they wish to carry out, and
those who died wished to carry out.''
   Chinese officials have been harassing Chinese student activists
in the United States by making death threats in anonymous telephone
calls, Minxin Pei, 31, a Harvard political science student and
spokesman for the fledgling student congress, said at a news
conference.
   He said officials from the Chinese consulate in New York visited
his apartment, called him a traitor and a fool for his
pro-democracy activities and threatened ``big trouble'' if he
persisted.
   The student congress will try to set up a powerful radio station
south of China, said Zhongdang Pan, a 31-year-old journalism
graduate student at the University of Wisconsin.
   Pan said he also hopes to get a Chinese language newspaper
published in America and to send copies to China.

   Warring Syrian and Christian forces
battered Beirut with 50,000 shells and rockets overnight, killing
13 people in a random bombardment that one radio station called ``a
night of insane terror.''
   The eight-hour barrage sparked fires that raged out of control
and gutted scores of warehouses, shops and apartment buildings.
   Orange flames blazed against the night sky as residents cowered
in basements and bomb shelters.
   Almost every neighborhood in the divided capital and the
Christian port city of Jounieh were hit ``as if by a killer
earthquake,'' said a police spokesman. ``It was Beirut's night of
horror and terror.''
   He said 13 people were killed and 65 wounded, raising the toll
to 494 dead and 2,014 injured since the latest fighting erupted
March 8 between Lebanese army commander Michel Aoun's mainly
Christian troops and an alliance of the Syrian army and Druse
Moslem militiamen.
   It was the heaviest shelling duel in the four-month
confrontation ``in terms of firepower used and destruction
wreaked,'' said the police spokesman.
   Syrian gunners in west Beirut and north Lebanon joined forces at
8 p.m. Thursday and started blasting Jounieh, east Beirut and the
Christian port of Byblos, he said.
   Aoun's forces struck back at Syrian batteries with 155mm
howitzers, but their allies from the Lebanese Forces militia fired
an indiscriminate barrage at west Beirut. The shelling tapered off
at 4 a.m.
   People emerged from bunkers and jammed supermarkets, buying food
and bottled water in anticipation of another bombardment.
   ``Is this apocalypse?'' asked Hisham Sinno, a Sunni Moslem
grocer whose shop was destroyed. ``I'm destroyed. I have no source
of income left.''
   ``Let them all roast in hell, those who are roasting Beirut!''
said Albert Tawil, a Christian bank employee in east Beirut. ``I
wish one day I'll drink their blood.''
   Broken power cables dangled on streets littered with craters and
glass shards. Hundreds of burned-out cars smoldered.
   An electric tools warehouse in west Beirut burned from midight
to midday. Fire engines wre unable to battle the fire because of a
water shortage.
   ``A night of insane terror,'' the Moslem-controlled Voice of the
Nation radio said of the thunderous duel waged with multibarreled
launchers that spit 40 rockets a minute.
   ``We're being killed in our beds .... Beirut is being massacred
and no one in the Arab world or the outside world seems to care,''
said an announcer on Christian-run Voice of Lebanon, his voice
choking with emotion.
   One rocket devastated the top floor of the seven-story building
housing offices of The Associated Press and the U.S. television
networks CBS and NBC.
   ``The explosion blew me out of my bed. I found myself flat on
the floor with glass shards showering me,'' said AP correspondent
Farouk Nassar, who lives on the sixth floor.
   The blast shattered windows and hurled pieces of furniture down
the street.
   Screams for help rang out as one rocket tore through the second
floor of a nearby apartment building, chopping off the left leg of
Druse janitor Jawhar al-Jawhari, 38. He was taken to the American
University Hospital, where dozens of stretchers with screaming
wounded crowded the emergency ward.
   The U.N. headquarters in west Beirut and the Soviet Embassy
compound also took direct hits, but police said no casualties were
reported.
   Another exodus followed the bombardment. Police estimated at
least 100,000 residents fled Beirut on Thursday and Friday, in
addition to a quarter-million last weekend. The city's population
of 1.5 million has been halved since March.
   The International Committee of the Red Cross issued an ``urgent
appeal to all warring factions for an immediate cessation of
indiscriminate bombardment of civil properties and population,
which constitutes an unacceptable violation to the simplest
humanitarian norms.''
   The spiraling violence underscores the lack of progress made by
an Arab League committee appointed in May to help end Lebanon's
14-year civil war.
   This latest confrontation erupted after Aoun blockaded illegal
harbors run by Moslem militias, aiming to restore eroded state
authority and recoup $100 million a year in lost tax revenues.
   Druse warlord Walid Jumblatt retaliated by shelling the
Christian enclave north of Beirut, where Aoun's 20,000 troops are
stationed.
   The Syrians, who maintain 40,000 troops in Lebanon under a 1976
peacekeeping mandate from the Arab League, later joined the
shelling and enforced a sea and land blockade around the enclave.

<TEXT>
   The federal aviation director said today
the instrument landing system at Tripoli's airport was not working
when a Korean Air DC-10 undershot the runway and crashed while
trying to land in heavy fog.
   The system gives the pilot an automatic indication of the center
of the runway, but it had not worked for several months, Mohamed
Abughres, director of civil aviation, told reporters.
   Airline officials said 77 people died in the crash Thursday,
including six killed on the ground when the jet slammed into
farmhouses and cars about a mile short of the runway. They said 128
of the 199 people on board survived. Libyan officials said 78
people died on the jet.
   A diplomat at the South Korean Embassy in the Libyan capital,
who identified himself only as Mr. Chun, said many victims were
badly burned, making a precise count difficult.
   The crash was the second of a DC-10 in eight days. A United Air
Lines DC-10 went down July 19 in Sioux City, Iowa, killing 111
people. That crash occurred when a tail engine blew apart, cutting
off the flow of hydraulic fluid needed to control the jet.
   The president of Korean Air ruled out pilot error in the Tripoli
crash, but an investigator quoted the pilot as saying he may have
been wrong to try to land in the fog.
   Another KAL pilot was quoted as saying the jet had experienced
mechanical problems and that pilots had complained about it. ``We
pilots complained a lot about the DC-10 because it made lots of
squeaking sounds when flown in bad weather,'' South Korea's Munhwa
Broadcasting Corp. quoted the unidentified pilot as saying.
   That pilot said the airline and the government's Transportation
Ministry ignored their complaints about the 17-year-old jet.
   Libyan authorities defended as ``excellent'' the actions of the
air traffic controllers who were working when the plane crashed.
   JANA said the airport control tower told the pilot, Kim Ho-jung,
there was heavy fog and and visibility was only 800 feet. It said a
Soviet Aeroflot jetliner, informed of similar conditions about an
hour earlier, went instead to Malta.
   Abughres told reporters that all pilots of incoming aircraft had
been informed of the problem with the instrument landing system. He
said airport radar, radio beacons and other navigation aids were
all working.
   Libya's chief investigator, Mustapha Maghrebi, said Kim, one of
the 128 survivors, told officials he may have been wrong to attempt
a landing in the fog.
   But Korean Air president Cho Chung-kun told reporters and family
members in Seoul today that the pilot apparently confronted ``an
unexpected situation'' while trying to land. He ruled out pilot
error or mechanical problems.
   Cho did not say what he meant by ``an unexpected situation,''
but Korean Air officials privately indicated the control tower
improperly directed the jet.
   South Korea's Yonhap News Agency quoted an unidentified airline
official as saying, ``The plane was ordered to make a 270-degree
turn by the control tower and crashed at the moment of turning when
it hit an unidentified object.''
   Yonhap also quoted an airline official as saying the crew told
authorities the landing guidance system may have been out of order.
   JANA quoted unidentified sources in Libya's Civil Aviation
Commission as saying the crash was either caused by mechanical or
pilot error. It said the airport provided ``excellent'' aviation
assistance.
   Investigators from South Korea arrived in Libya today to help in
the investigation, and a medical team arrived to help treat with
survivors.
   In Seoul, an aviation expert of the Transportation Ministry said
``each side is trying to say they are not wholly responsible for
the accident.'' He spoke on condition of anonymity.
   The jet hit cars and two houses and split into three pieces
before coming to rest about a half-mile from the airport.
   JANA said more than 110 people were hospitalized. Airline
officials in Seoul said 40 people with minor burns were expected to
be released today.
   Most of the passengers on Flight 803 were South Koreans
returning to their jobs on engineering and construction projects in
Libya. Flight 803 originated in Seoul and had made stops in
Bangkok, Thailand, and Jiddah, Saudi Arabia, the airline said.
   In Seoul today, about 100 relatives of crash victims staged a
protest march for two hours on a road leading to Seoul's Kimpo
International Airport.
   Some carried signs calling airline officials ``murderers.''
Others demanded they be allowed to fly to Libya to view the plane.

<TEXT>
   Rep. Tommy Robinson of Arkansas, complaining
there is no room for conservative Southerners in the national
Democratic Party, announced today he is switching to the Republican
Party.
   Robinson, a third-term congressman, made the announcement at a
White House briefing where President Bush welcomed him to the GOP
as ``a man of the people'' who believes in a strong defense and
traditional American values.
   Robinson became the third Democratic official in three days to
switch to the Republican Party, and the second House Democrat to
join the GOP this year. Rep. Bill Grant of Florida made the switch
in February.
   Robinson's defection leaves the party lineup in the House at 256
Democrats and 176 Republicans, with three vacancies.
   ``Even after losing five of the last six presidential elections
in the nation and Arkansas, the leadership of the Democratic Party
still is unwilling to listen to the majority of the American
people,'' Robinson said.
   ``... I simply cannot wait any longer for the liberal leadership
of the Democratic Party to see the light,'' he said. ``The hard
fact is that there is and will be no room for conservative Southern
Democrats in today's national Democratic Party.''
   On Thursday, retiring District of Columbia Police Chief Maurice
Turner made a similar announcement. Turner, who is considered a
mayoral prospect for the capital city, was welcomed to the
Republican Party in a meeting with Bush and Lee Atwater, chairman
of the Republican National Committee.
   On Wednesday, Louisiana Secretary of State Fox McKeithen shed
the Democratic affiliation carried for a lifetime by his father,
eight-year former Gov. John McKeithen.
   Bush called the younger McKeithen and told him, ``Yours was a
courageous decision.'' McKeithen, who is considering a bid next
year against Democratic Sen. Bennett Johnston, said his father told
him, ``You must be crazy.''
   A former sheriff, Robinson was elected to the House in 1984 from
Arkansas' 2nd Congressional District. He has a conservative, strong
pro-defense record and serves on the House Armed Services, Veterans
Affairs and Aging committees.
   Robinson's switch brings to 130 the number of party converts at
all levels _ mostly state and local officials _ announced by the
Republicans in their bid to realign the voter registration patterns.
   The number takes in party and elected officials, and some no
longer in office, down to the level of local clerk, alderman, local
committee member and school board member. The RNC did not provide
dates for many of the changes, but the dates that were given were
for this year.
   All the party switchers were from southern states.
   Robinson was in the news earlier this year for giving a
$60,000-a-year job on his congressional staff to the 22-year-old
daughter of his close friend, business partner and financial
backer, Dallas Cowboys owner Jerry Jones.
   Robinson reported owing at least $100,000 to Jones.
   Although not illegal, the hiring of Jones' daughter raised
questions because other Capitol Hill aides at her level _ just out
of college _ earn far less and hold jobs less elevated than her
trio of titles _ administrative assistant, office manager and press
secretary.

pounds of homemade explosives and various other bomb-making
equipment they believed were intended for IRA use, a spokesman said.
   The cache was discovered as part of a search of houses in the
mainly Roman Catholic Ardoyne area of the city, said the spokesman,
speaking anonymously.
   One man, who was not identified, was detained and was ``helping
with police inquiries,'' the police spokesman said.
   Police believed the items, which included detonation cords and
chemicals, were for use by the outlawed Irish Republican Army.
   The mainly Roman Catholic IRA is fighting to oust the British
from the province and unite it with the Republic of Ireland.

   President Bush said today that William Lucas,
his embattled nominee to head the Justice Department's civil rights
division, ``has my confidence'' and had been personally assured of
his support.
   Fielding questions from reporters, Bush ascribed mounting
criticism of Lucas' qualifications to ``pure gut politics'' and
said he thought Lucas was paying a political price for switching
from the Democratic to the Republican party.
   Lucas, a former public official in the Detroit area, has denied
a new but unverified allegation that he once complained about a
federal housing discrimination suit against a predominantly white
Detroit suburb.
   Justice Department spokesman David Runkel said late Thursday
that Lucas, nominated as assistant attorney general for civil
rights, denied urging the government to drop a housing
discrimination suit against the city of Birmingham, Mich.
   The allegation was contained in a letter to the Senate Judiciary
Committee from Michael Sussman, a former Justice Department civil
rights lawyer who now represents black plaintiffs in the landmark
desegregation case against Yonkers, N.Y.
   Bush, appearing in the White House briefing room today, said,
``I strongly support Bill Lucas. I'm strongly convinced that much,
not all of, but much of the criticism of him, is pure gut politics.
And it started before day one of the (confirmation) hearings.''
   ``He has my confidence,'' the president said. ``But, let the
record show, I made phone calls for him. ... I told Bill last
night, `I am staying with you a hundred percent and it's going to
be right there and solid.'''
   Bush had been asked whether he thought he had spoken up
sufficiently forcefully for his Justice Department nominee.
   Runkel, the department spokesman, called Sussman ``a disgruntled
former employee of the department and said of the latest
allegation: ``This kind of a last-minute tactic is reprehensible
from somebody who is certainly aware of the system to raise an
issue without any substance at all at this point,''
   Civil rights organizations have questioned Lucas' qualifications
to serve in the post. The 61-year-old black Republican from Detroit
was sheriff and later chief executive of Wayne County, Mich. He is
a lawyer who has never appeared in court.
   Sussman's letter describing a 1980 telephone call by Lucas was
circulated Thursday by congressional sources after the Judiciary
Committee postponed a vote on the nomination until Tuesday at the
request of Sen. Howell Heflin, D-Ala.
   Heflin, whose vote could decide whether the panel gives Lucas a
favorable recommendation to the full Senate, said he wanted time to
study the new information.
   ``I don't want to injure anybody _ the allegations are not
substantiated,'' Heflin told reporters.
   Lawmakers, lobbyists and Justice Department officials professed
ignorance about the new information to which Heflin referred. The
Alabama senator told colleagues he would not necessarily support
Lucas if forced to vote Thursday.
   In the letter circulated later in the day, Sussman said he ``was
not personally the recipient of Mr. Lucas' call (but) I distinctly
recall discussing it with my supervisor.''
   ``It particularly struck me that Mr. Lucas _ who then was
sheriff of Wayne County and a political figure familiar to me from
my frequent visits to the area _ would attempt to intervene on
behalf of the defendant white officeholders,'' Sussman said.
   The Justice Department, which eventually won the suit, charged
that the city of Birmingham violated the Fair Housing Act by
preventing the construction of racially integrated low-income
housing. Birmingham is in Oakland County.
   Runkel said the lawyer who tried the case, Brian Heffernan,
never heard of Lucas until his nomination this year.
   But Sussman, reached by telephone at his home in suburban New
York, said he clearly remembers a conversation with his supervisor,
Joel Selig, after Lucas telephoned the department three to four
weeks after the lawsuit was first filed.
   Sussman said Selig told him that Lucas was one of several
callers who complained about the suit being filed. The calls were
``a vindication of his (Selig's) arguments that the case would
generate a lot of heat,'' Sussman said.
   Selig, who teaches at the University of Wyoming law school, said
from his home in Laramie, that he doesn't recall a telephone call
from Lucas.
   ``But it is entirely possible that such a contact occurred and
that I simply do not remember it because I attached no particular
significance to it at the time,'' he said.
   Selig said he was contacted about the allegation several weeks
ago by someone investigating Lucas for an organization. Selig said
he spoke with the person, whom he refused to identify, and Lucas on
a conference telephone call.

   They're baring all for the last time.
   ``Oh! Calcutta!'', Broadway's long-running nude revue, will
close Aug. 6 after a run of 5,959 performances, executive producer
Maria Di Dia, announced Friday.
   ``It's been an exciting ride, and I'm sad to see it end,'' said
Ms. Di Dia. ``But I'm also happy because no one ever expected this
show to succeed.''
   The current edition of the show opened Sept. 24, 1976, at the
Edison Theater. It was the second major incarnation for the revue,
which premiered originally in 1969 at off-Broadway's Eden Theater,
moved in 1971 to Broadway's Belasco Theater and ran there until the
following year.
   The show has been seen by more than 85 million people in 18
countries, according to Ms. Di Dia, and has grossed more than $350
million.
   Among the more than 1,400 performers who appeared in various
productions of the revue are Bill Macy, formerly of ``Maude''; Alan
Rachins of ``L.A. Law''; Samantha Harper, Steven Keats and
choreographer Margot Sappington.
   ``Oh! Calcutta!'' was first put together in 1969 by British
critic Kenneth Tynan, who wanted to stage a musical revue about
``the pursuit of happiness through sex.''
   Among the contributors to the revue were Jules Feiffer, John
Lennon, Sam Shepard, Robert Benton, David Newman and Sherman Yellen.
   The current production of ``Oh! Calcutta!'' was produced by
Norman Kean, who operated the Edison Theater. Kean jumped to his
death last year from his New York apartment after stabbing his
wife, actress Gwyda DonHowe, to death. During its long run, ``Oh!
Calcutta!'' has been engaged in a battle of statistics with ``A
Chorus Line.'' Although it opened on Broadway more than a year
after ``A Chorus Line,'' ``Oh! Calcutta!'' has given more
performances because its schedule calls for 10 performances each
week rather than the customary eight.
   ``A Chorus Line,'' which opened on July 25, 1975, at the Shubert
Theater and is still going, advertises itself as ``Broadway's
longest-running show.'' The current edition of ``Oh! Calcutta!''
bills itself as ``the world's longest-running erotic musical.''
   Ms. Di Dia said she currently is negotiating a Latin American
tour for the revue, as well as another American touring company.

<HEAD>Mayan Manuscript Found in Ancient Indian Village</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BOULDER, Colo. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An archaeological team from the University
of Colorado excavating an ancient Indian village in El Salvador has
discovered what specialists think are the oldest known remains of a
Mayan manuscript.
   The fragmented remains of what appears to be a ``codex,''
pre-Columbian written records, were found on an adobe shelf in a
house buried by a volcanic eruption 1,400 years ago.
   Only three other Mayan codices are known to have survived the
destruction of the Spanish conquest. The origin of a fourth remains
in dispute among scholars. Most codices were religious records
dealing with the astronomical complexities of the Mayan calendar.
   If the fragments prove to be remains of a Mayan codex, it would
be not only the oldest such manuscript, but also the only one ever
discovered in an archaeological excavation, said Dr. Payson Sheets,
director of the dig and a professor of anthropology at CU-Boulder.
   The Joya de Ceren site, on the edge of a small farming village
about 16 miles north west of San Salvador, the capital, was buried
under 15 feet of powdery volcanic ash during the eruption of nearby
Laguna Caldera in the year 600, during the mid-Classic period of
pre-Columbian culture.
   ``The site probably contains the best preserved pre-Columbian
houses and organic remains in Central America,'' Sheets said.
   The fine-grained ash packed tightly around organic material,
giving a level of preservation rarely encountered in archaeology.
Before finding the codex, Sheet's team found wooden poles,
carbonized roof thatch, well-preserved beans in a pot, and intact
leaves.
   Rae Beaubien, a Smithsonian Institution preservation specialist,
flew to El Salvador last week to examine the codex. It is in
extremely poor condition, consisting of ordered layers of paint
flecks embedded in a block of volcanic ash. The paint probably once
covered pages of pounded bark parchments long since deteriorated,
said Beaubien.
   She said the find is ``extremely valuable,'' and even if none of
the writings are legible, scientists will analyze the types of
paint used and the components of the white background coating that
covered the parchment.
   Beaubien will transport the ash block containing the codex to
Smithsonian Institution laboratories in Washington for further
excavation and analysis.
   The oldest known codex prior to this find is dated at A.D.
900-1000.
   Most archaeological research in Central America has focused on
stone palaces and ceremonial centers that survived intact.
   ``As a result,'' said Sheets, ``we know a lot about how the
upper classes lived. But here at Ceren, the unusual level of
preservation provides us with an extraordinary opportunity to learn
about the lives of the lower and middle classes.''
   The Ceren site was discovered during a government construction
project in 1976 and partially excavated by Sheets in 1980. But that
work was suspended for nine years because of the Central American
nation's civil war.
   The current excavation began May 25 and will last through Aug.
12. The work is financed by a $90,000 grant from the National
Science Foundation.
   In the first house excavated, the team has identified women's
work areas for cooking, pottery and clothmaking. Chipped obsidian
tools were made, most likely by men, on a nearby thatch-roofed clay
platform. About 30 ceramic vessels, several intact, have been been
found.
   The scientists used ground-penetrating radar and measurements of
electrical resistance in the ground to find two more underground
structures that also are being excavated this summer.

   A ``Night on the Town with Billy Dee
Williams'' was no fun for a contest winner who says the star was
busy doing deals and signing autographs and then left a nightclub
without her.
   ``I was very humiliated, very upset,'' Delphine Hamilton, 30,
said this week of her recent date.
   Hamilton bought a new outfit for the night and borrowed her
sister's $80 patent leather bag, which she lost.
   ``I was excited. Everybody in the neighborhood was happy for me.
They couldn't hardly believe it was me,'' she said.
   At the nightclub, Williams signed autographs for 1{ hours, she
said.
   When Hamilton realized the entourage was leaving without her,
she burst into tears, complaining loudly she hadn't gotten the cab
fare she was promised.
   She said she ran to the limousine and was told to get the fare
from radio station WDAS, which ran the contest.
   Both E. Steven Collins, WDAS promotion director, and Bill Owens,
a spokesman for Williams, denied her account.
   Collins, who described Hamilton's behavior as unruly, said he
gave her $40 for cab fare.

   Movie tough-guy Chuck Norris and former Chicago
Bears star Walter Payton lost their bid to upset a world speedboat
record held by former President Reagan's son, Michael.
   It took the two over 14 hours to make the open-water powerboat
trip Thursday from Chicago to Detroit. Reagan's trip in 1983 was
made in a little over 12{ hours.
   A mechanical malfunction forced the Norris-Payton boat to dock
in Mackinaw City to replace a 49-cent part. The repairs took almost
two hours.
   The boat also lost a propeller, Norris said. Crew chief Ed
Morenz did an in-water replacement.
   ``It was bad,'' Payton said. ``We had 30 to 40 mph winds ... and
some nine- and 10-foot waves. I'm not sore. But I probably will be
tomorrow. I'm more mad than anything else.''
   Since retiring as the NFL's all-time rushing leader, Payton has
done some auto racing. It was his first start in a raceboat.

   Jason, the hockey-masked killer who is back
for more slashing in the latest ``Friday the 13th'' film, lost one
battle where he was out of his depth.
   Ads for the new movie, ``Jason Takes Manhattan,'' didn't sit
well with state Economic Development officials who objected to
their use of a copyrighted ``I Love New York'' logo.
   The ads showed Jason, who periodically rises to slash up a camp
full of teen-agers, cutting through the heart of a logo poster.
   ``You slash our heart, we'll cut you off at the knees,'' said
state agency spokesman Harold Holzer. ``There's someone in New York
who's tougher than Jason,'' he said, referring to the agency's
commissioner, Vincent Tese.
   Paramount Pictures said it would drop the ``I Love New York,''
logo state officials said Thursday.
   Paramount spokeswoman Deborah Rosen said the poster was to be
dropped anyway once the movie was released Friday.

   Pickfair, the fabled mansion where
Mary Pickford and Douglas Fairbanks held court for early Hollywood
stars, is about to be transformed into a Renaissance-style Venetian
palazzo by Pia Zadora and her husband.
   The redone mansion will have tile roofs, leaded windows,
balconies, verandas and a new, Italian-style front entrance, made
up of two tiers of flanking stairs ascending from a driveway.
   ``The house has been changed through the years a number of times
so that it no longer is the original Pickfair,'' said Paul Selwyn,
chairman of the city's Planning Commission, which gave its initial
approval to the project Wednesday night.
   One thing that won't change is the name.
   ``Pickfair will be called Pickfair,'' the actress' husband,
multimillionaire businessman Meshulam Riklis, said in a statement.
   The couple bought the estate, which sits atop a knoll on three
acres, from Los Angeles Lakers' owner Jerry Buss for $6.675 million
last year.
   The home, built as a hunting lodge in 1910, was bought by
Fairbanks in 1919. During the '20s and '30s he and Miss Pickford,
the reigning star of her day, played host to a list of guests that
read like a page from ``Who's Who.''
   Among them were Jack Dempsey, Albert Einstein, Amelia Earhart,
F. Scott Fitzgerald, Henry Ford, Babe Ruth and H.G. Wells. Charlie
Chaplin, who once lived next door, also dropped by regularly, as
did Miss Pickford's childhood friend Lillian Gish.

   More than 30 years after a standoff
that rocked the nation, former Gov. Orval Faubus came to praise the
civil rights leader who pushed school integration despite his call
up of the National Guard.
   Daisy Bates, known for her role in the 1957 integration of
Central High School, was honored Thursday as part of a series of
tributes to outstanding Arkansans.
   ``In many of the controversies, we were often appropriately, but
sometimes inaccurately, portrayed in opposing roles,'' Faubus told
250 people gathered for the Bates tribute. ``But there was never
any animosity from me toward her and I never detected any animosity
of her toward me.''
   During his 12 years as governor, Faubus said he met often with
Mrs. Bates, who headed the state chapter of the National
Association for the Advancement of Colored People.
   ``Her aim was not to attain a high-paying salary,'' he said.
``She was not motivated by fame. She worked for a cause. Her aim
was to help others. She was never deterred from her cause and she
remained constant in her faith and loyal to her cause. She earned
the respect of those who share the American dream.''
   Mrs. Bates, 75, said of Faubus, 79: ``I told him once, `Yeah, we
did have a good fight, didn't we? But I won.'''

<HEAD>Bush Depending on Aspin to Help Preserve Defense Authorization Requests</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: Top 10 grafs new with Bush remarks; picks up 5th graf pvs, The
Senate.</HEAD>

   President Bush said today he is depending on
the Democratic chairman of the Armed Services Committee to help
prevent Congress from gutting a defense authorization bill already
torn asunder in House votes.
   In two days of votes on a $295 billion defense authorization
bill, the House ignored White House and Pentagon lobbying and
turned Bush's defense priorities on their head.
   Rep. Les Aspin, D-Wis., chairman of the Armed Services
Committee, said the House had ``shredded'' Bush's defense
priorities to produce ``a Michael Dukakis defense bill.''
   Bush told a White House news conference he is disappointed at
the House votes cutting back virtually every major strategic
program, but said that with the help of the Senate, ``we will
prevail.''
   ``I'm going to put a lot of emphasis on the Senate and we will
work with people like Chairman Aspin, who does not want to see the
defense bill gutted,'' Bush said.
   ``And I do think we will prevail for most of what we want _ a
strong SDI (Star Wars) program, a strong B-2 (stealth bomber)
program,'' he said.
   ``But I do not want to negotiate with the Soviet Union without
as many cards in my hands as possible,'' he said.
   Bush said Defense Secretary Dick Cheney had made tough cuts in
defense programs even before the House acted.
   ``I want to get support across the board in the Congress for our
defense program, and yesterday was not the House's most memorable
moment, but we're going to keep fighting on for what we believe
in,'' he said.
   The House restored funds for conventional aircraft discarded by
the Pentagon while suspending most production of the radar-evading
stealth bomber. It cut money for the Star Wars missile defense
system, stripped funds intended to make the MX missile a mobile
weapon and eliminated all of the $100 million provided for the
Midgetman missile.
   The Senate, meanwhile, only narrowly turned aside a strong bid
to freeze research and development of the Star Wars strategic
defense initiative. It tabled the amendment offered by Sen. Bennett
Johnston, D-La., 50-47.
   But that action may result in the chamber retaining needed
leverage to resist House cuts on that and other weapons systems.
   The Senate will need all the leverage it can muster when
representatives of the two bodies meet in conference to resolve the
many differences between the two bills.
   Senators are to continue their consideration of the measure next
week.
   ``We are watching the strategic position of the administration
unwind step by step on the floor of the House,'' said Sen. Sam
Nunn, D-Ga., chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee.
   ``It is important that we not emasculate this program,'' Nunn
said as the vote neared on an amendment to cut Star Wars by $558
million in addition to the $400 million trimmed earlier by the
Senate panel.
   ``If the Senate does not come out with a reasonable budget on
all strategic programs, then we are going to be going to conference
in a hopeless situation,'' he said.
   The House adopted its version of the bill, 261-162.
   In the final minutes of debate, an unusual coalition of
Republicans and liberals turned against the Midgetman.
   Republicans were prompted by anger at an earlier vote cutting
$502 million from the $1.1 billion the administration had asked for
the rail lines needed to make the MX a mobile and less vulnerable
weapon. Joining them were many liberal members.
   Aspin appealed to members not to reject Minuteman ``on a motion
of spite.''
   But on a head-count vote of 176-90 the House approved the
change, removing all the money for the single-warhead missile.
   The House also revived money for the Navy's F-14D jet fighter
and the Marine Corps' V-22 Osprey vertical takeoff assault
transport _ two programs Bush planned to eliminate as low priority
items in a tight-money budget.
   Summing up the result, Aspin told reporters that in effect,
``Mike (Dukakis) won the election. No Midgetman. No rail MX ... Big
cuts in SDI, and slow up the B-2 (stealth) bomber.''
   Dukakis, the Democratic governor of Massachusetts, was soundly
defeated by Bush in the 1988 presidential election after a campaign
in which the Republican portrayed the Democrat as weak on defense.
   As Aspin saw it, the Democratic majority which controls the
House carried out the defeated candidate's campaign promises in
writing its version of the defense bill.
   The House's military spending plan suspends production of the
B-2 stealth bomber, priced at about $530 million each, until the
Pentagon scales back its $70 billion, 132-plane program, widely
viewed as unaffordable in an era of soaring budget deficits.
   The bill also requires the administration to show that the
stealth can successfully evade radar detection and penetrate Soviet
airspace before production resumes.
   Bush and Defense Secretary Dick Cheney had lobbied hard for
stealth, Star Wars and the other strategic programs.
   But the House slashed $1.8 billion from the president's $4.9
billion Star Wars request.

   A man pleaded guilty to second-degree
murder Friday for the slaying and dismemberment of his chess
companion and was immediately sentenced to prison.
   Robert Eugene Bennett, 51, of Klamath Falls, Ore., also waived a
presentence investigation during what was to have been only an
arraignment hearing. Third District Judge James Sawaya sentenced
him to an indeterminate term of five years to life.
   Deputy Salt Lake County Attorney Tom Vuyk said he had been
informed earlier that Bennett intended to plead guilty.
   Defense attorney Andrew Valdez said his client was concerned
about subjecting the family of his victim, Larry Duane White, to
the ordeal of a trial. Valdez said Bennett also wanted to avoid
revelations about his and White's sexual preferences.
   White, 51, disappeared Feb. 21. The next day, his severed legs
were found in a trash bin in suburban Salt Lake. His head and torso
were found May 8, buried at a home once rented by Bennett, who also
is known as Joe King Bennett and Roy William Anderson.
   Bennett occasionally played chess with White, a writer living
with his father in Salt Lake City. Bennett and White were to have
started work at a telemarketing company the week White disappeared.
   Bennett was arrested April 6 in Las Vegas on a federal charge of
falsely applying for a Social Security number.
   Bennett was investigated but never charged in the disappearance
of his wife, Floyd Jeanie Better, 36, in Beaverton, Ore. She was
last seen Feb. 22, 1988. Detectives dug up a piece of property
where they believed she might be buried, but found nothing.

   A Soviet deputy prime minister said Friday she
ordered 50 million pairs of pantyhose and 1.7 million pairs of
women's shoes on a $165 million shopping spree to replenish her
country's shelves.
   Alexandra Biryukova, the Soviet Union's top-ranking woman
politician, then topped off a week-long trip with a visit to Marks
&amp; Spencer, the department store chain favored by Prime Minister
Margaret Thatcher and millions of budget-conscious Britons.
   Mrs. Biryukova, who met Mrs. Thatcher earlier in the week, is
leading a delegation of five ministers to promote Soviet-British
trade.
   She said the group had visited more than 20 firms since arriving
Monday, reached agreements on joint ventures and ordered goods from
coffee and toothpaste to the pantyhose and shoes.
   ``We assess our visit to this country as very useful and
effective,'' said the deputy prime minister, who is in charge of
social development and joined the ruling Communist Party Politburo
as a non-voting member last autumn.
   She and the accompanying ministers said their purchases were
influenced by shortages, and were to be delivered by the end of
this year.
   Although the Soviet government had postponed a revision of the
pricing system after discovering it would be harder to undertake
than first imagined, it was trying out emergency measures to
replenish stores, Mrs. Biryukova said.
   ``We realize the problem of saturating our market with consumer
goods is something which has to be addressed very closely,'' she
said.
   Along with $110 million in pantyhose, shoes, coffee, toothpaste,
razor blades, cassette tapes, soap, women's clothing and other
goods, the Soviets said they purchased $55 million in various
drugs. They did not give specific values for other goods.
   The 60-year-old deputy prime minister, who began her career in a
calico mill, also did not give details of joint ventures. Soviet
Embassy officials did not return telephone calls and British
officials said they didn't know details.
   Mrs. Biryukova described her meeting Wednesday with Mrs.
Thatcher as ``friendly and constructive,'' saying they had
discussed the two nations' trade target set last year.
   The countries agreed to try to raise the volume of their trade
to $4.1 billion by 1990, but Mrs. Biryukova said they hoped to hit
the target this year.
   The Confederation of British Industry, which invited the
Soviets, said Britain exported $925 million in goods to the Soviets
last year.
   The Soviets exported $1.2 billion in goods, including oil,
timber and minerals, to Britain, according to the industrial
organization.
   A spokesman for Mrs. Thatcher said she and Mrs. Biryukova also
discussed women in politics during their 45-minute meeting.
   Later Friday, Mrs. Biryukova toured a department store she had
asked to visit.
   She spent two hours in a Marks &amp; Spencer store, visiting the
sales floor, a training class and the staff restaurant, where she
drank a cup of tea, said Director Nigel Colne.
   ``We talked about how we identify what the customer wants and
how we go about providing it,'' he said. ``She asked a number of
questions about how ideas are generated in the business.''
   Colne, who described Mrs. Biryukova as ``warm and engaging,''
said she didn't buy anything herself but had previously ``shopped
with us and enjoyed the garments.''

<HEAD>Consumer Spending Slows, Threatening Economic Growth</HEAD>

   Personal incomes rose a lackluster 0.3 percent
in June as consumer spending, after adjusting for inflation,
declined for a second straight month, the government said Friday in
a report that renewed recession fears.
   The Commerce Department said consumer spending, after taking
inflation into account, edged down 0.1 percent in June following a
0.2 percent May decline. It marked the first back-to-back monthly
declines in spending since September and October, 1987, a period
when consumer confidence was shaken by the stock market crash.
   Consumer spending, which accounts for two-thirds of overall
economic activity, has been the driving force behind the record
peacetime expansion, now in its seventh year. But economists are
fearful that consumers, worried about their economic prospects,
could begin to cut back sharply on their purchases.
   The Commerce Department report said that personal incomes grew a
modest 0.3 percent in June following an even smaller 0.2 percent
May increase. The gains were the weakest this year and reflected in
part a slowdown in job growth, which has sent the unemployment rate
edging upward.
   ``The economy, here at mid-year, is beginning to flirt with a
recession,'' said Allen Sinai, chief economist of the Boston Co.
``We are seeing consumers' spending power being squeezed by higher
inflation at the same time that pent-up demand for big-ticket items
is pretty much exhausted.''
   The government reported Thursday that the overall economy, as
measured by the gross national product, expanded at a sluggish
annual rate of 1.7 percent in the April-June quarter, the slowest
pace in almost three years.
   The Bush administration insists that growth will rebound in the
second half of the year, fueled by lower interest rates engineered
by the Federal Reserve.
   But Sinai said he believes the sluggish growth will intensify,
leading to rising unemployment in coming months and further
weakening consumer confidence. He predicted the economy would enter
a mild recession either late this year or early in 1990.
   David Jones, chief economist with Aubrey G. Lanston &amp; Co., said
he felt the country would be able to skirt through this period of
sluggish growth without a full-fledged downturn, helped in large
part by further moves by the Fed to lower interest rates.
   The central bank earlier this week acted for the third time
since June to ease credit. Jones said the rapid pacing of these
interest-lowering moves demonstrated how worried the Fed is about a
possible recession.
   ``The Fed is concerned that some interest-rate sensitive sectors
of the economy, such as autos and housing, are still quite weak,''
Jones said. ``This will lead to further easing on the Fed's part in
August.''
   Before adjusting for inflation, consumer spending was unchanged
at an annual rate of $3.44 trillion in June following a modest 0.3
percent May increase.
   The key income category of wages and salaries was up 0.5 percent
in June but this was in part a bounceback after wage income was
essentially unchanged in May.
   Farmers' incomes plunged at an annual rate of $12 billion in
June following a $1.4 billion May decrease. The weakness in June
reflected a drop in federal subsidy payments.
   On the spending side, purchases of durable goods, items expected
to last three or more years, fell by $1.7 billion, following a $9.6
billion decrease in May, with much of the weakness in both months
reflecting a slump in car sales.
   Purchases of non-durable goods edged up $400 million following a
much bigger $4.9 billion rise in May, an advance that had been
propelled by higher food and gasoline costs.
   Purchases of services were up $2.5 billion following a giant
$12.7 billion May jump that had reflected a surge in utility bills
caused by hot weather.
   Disposable, or after-tax, incomes climbed by 0.6 percent in June
following a rise in May of 0.8 percent.
   The personal savings rate _ savings as a percentage of
disposable income _ climbed to 5.9 percent in June, the highest
level since March, when it was 6.2 percent. In April, the savings
rate took a nosedive to 4.9 percent as Americans had to write
checks to pay income taxes.
   Analysts said a rising savings rate is an indication that
consumers are becoming more cautious.

   Investigators believe the U.S. diplomat
suspected of spying was recruited by the Soviets 14 years ago, and
a published report today says he told the FBI he was paid ``a lot
of money'' for his efforts.
   A congressional source told The Associated Press the FBI
believes Felix S. Bloch was recruited by the KGB, the Soviet
intelligence service, while he was serving at the U.S. Embassy in
East Berlin 14 years ago.
   The New York Times today quoted an unnamed official as saying
Bloch admitted receiving money for spying. It said he made the
admission during his only interview with the FBI on June 22, the
day he was placed on administrative leave from his State Department
job.
   Bloch has not been charged with any crime but remains under
heavy FBI surveillance.
   President Bush told reporters today ``I can't give you the
facts'' on the case while it is under investigation. But he added
he was ``very concerned out premature discussion and disclosure _
that means leaks _ on this matter, because I think you can
jeopardize the case itself and perhaps the man's ability to get a
fair hearing.''
   Officials in Washington disclosed Thursday that Bloch received
State Department merit raises of more than $13,000 while he was the
No. 2 officer in the American embassy in Vienna.
   The raises are given to diplomats whose work is ``well above
average,'' said a U.S. official who spoke on condition of anonymity.
   During the FBI interview, the Times said, Bloch refused to
discuss his motives for spying or give details on his activities.
But it said he admitted spying for the Soviets ``for many years''
and told the FBI that they ``paid me a lot of money.''
   Three administration sources familiar with the Bloch case said
in Washington Thursday night that they had not been told of such
admissions.
   The Times said the FBI had received information that prompted
major interest in a recent trip Bloch was making to Europe and
planned a surveillance operation.
   The agency notified foreign intelligence services and
congressional committees, and somehow the information got out, the
paper said. As previously reported, U.S. eavesdropping picked up a
Soviet agent telling Bloch, ``A bad virus is going around and we
believe you are now infected.''
   The FBI also got permission to search his home but found nothing
incriminating, the paper said.
   Government sources say Bloch was videotaped in Paris handing a
briefcase to a Soviet agent earlier this year. The contents of the
briefcase remain unknown.
   The Austrian government's top police official said today that a
suspected KGB agent who may have been a contact man for Bloch
traveled to Vienna several times in the past 10 years on false
Finnish papers.
   Robert Danzinger told reporters that Austrian authorities were
told by U.S. officials on June 23 about a suspected KGB agent who
allegedly had contacts with Bloch.
   ``We assume he worked for the KGB,'' Danzinger said. ``We have
no information of our own that he is KGB. That information came
solely from Washington.''
   Austrian Interior Minister Franz Loeschnak confirmed news
reports that Bloch had a ``friendship'' with an Austrian woman over
a period of several years.
   The woman, a Vienna resident, returned from a vacation in Egypt
and was questioned by Austrian authorities this week, Danzinger
said, but this yielded no evidence she suspected anything about
Bloch.
   In Moscow, Foreign Ministry spokesman Gennady I. Gerasimov
denied any Soviet connection with Bloch. Gerasimov said Thursday he
made inquiries about Bloch's activities. ``The name of Bloch was
not familiar. We have no connection with him,'' he said.
   Bloch's merit raises included an increase of $4,500 for fiscal
1983-84, $4,000 for 1984-85 and $4,800 for 1985-86, said an
official who spoke on condition of anonymity.
   But Bloch's raise was the lowest of three merit pay grades in
the Senior Foreign Service, with the highest reaching about $9,000
a year, the official said.
   The pay increases were given to Bloch while he was in Vienna,
where he was posted from 1980 to 1987. Former U.S. ambassador to
Austria Helene Von Damm, who has been publicly critical of Bloch,
was among those who recommended the raises, said the official.
   After 30 years with the State Department, Bloch reached one of
the most senior gradings in the foreign service and makes about
$80,000 annually, officials said.
   Merit raises in the Senior Foreign Service are sometimes given
to diplomats who are eligible for more senior postings but cannot
get them because of a shortage of vacant slots.
   Bloch continues to draw his paycheck and benefits, although his
diplomatic passport and credentials have been revoked, the
department says.
   Bloch has been under tight FBI surveillance for several weeks.
Agents followed him Thursday as he ended a three-night stay at his
father's East Side co-op in New York City and returned by car to
his daughter's house in Chappaqua, N.Y., north of the city.
   Agents are engaged in what is expected to be a lengthy search
for the specific evidencethat would be required to charge Bloch
under the Espionage Act, including what secrets, if any, were
compromised.
   An FBI team has arrived in Vienna to assist in the investigation
there, according to Friday's editions of the Neue Kronen Zeitung.
FBI spokesmen in Washington would not confirm that.
   Meanwhile, President Bush added his voice to those advocating
improved U.S. counterintelligence efforts.
   ``The question is: Can we improve our counterintelligence? We
always ought to be striving to do that. Can embassy security be
improved? We go through this periodically and the answer is, I'm
sure it can,'' Bush told reporters Thursday.

   Hashemi Rafsanjani, who has become the
most powerful figure in Iran since Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini
died, is known to his countrymen as ``kuseh'' _ ``the shark.''
   Some say it is because of his political ruthlessness, cunning
and business acumen that made him a millionaire, all masked behind
a smile and a sly wit.
   Others cite a more mundane reason: his lack of facial hair,
revealing Mongolian ancestry, in a nation where beards are a badge
of revolutionary manhood.
   Rafsanjani's election to a new, more powerful presidency would
cement the 55-year-old cleric's hold on power after the death June
3 of Khomeini, to whom he was close throughout the decade of
Islamic revolution.
   His partnership with incumbent President Ayatollah Ali Khamenei,
the revolutionary patriarch's successor as religious leader, is
considered by many to herald a new era in Iranian politics. Both
advocate better relations with the West.
   Constitutional reforms up for approval in the same election
abolish the office of prime minister and put the president in
charge of the government, answerable only to the parliament.
   Rafsanjani is a hojatoleslam, a cleric of middle rank, and has
been a central figure in Khomeini's revolution. He was jailed for
several years under the late Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, who was
overthrown in February 1979.
   Since the revolution, Rafsanjani is said to have survived
several assassination attempts and crushed his rivals with brutal
efficiency.
   Like many Iranian leaders who have seen friends and rivals
killed in Iran's deadly political wars, Rafsanjani travels in an
armor-plated limousine and is surrounded by bodyguards.
   He has dominated the parliament as its speaker and built strong
support in Iran's critical power centers and among the
350,000-member Revolutionary Guards Corps, which he briefly
commanded.
   Abolhassan Bani-Sadr, who was Iran's first president and fled
when hard-liners turned on him in 1981, said before Khomeini died
that Rafsanjani ingratiated himself with the patriarch by playing
the court jester.
   ``He's a man who makes people laugh,'' Bani-Sadr said in an
interview in exile in France. ``It's a great art. He uses this to
gain his objectives.''
   Rafsanjani often delivers the ``sermon,'' a political speech
more than religious discourse, at Tehran University's Friday prayer
sessions.
   Clutching the barrel of an automatic rifle, his white turban
tilted back on his head, he speaks for hours without notes. Unlike
other speakers, he peppers his sermons with jokes.
   Bani-Sadr described Rafsanjani as a Machiavellian figure.
   ``He's a political animal,'' he said. ``He's not brilliant as an
organizer and he doesn't have too many original ideas, but he's a
manipulator and he's highly intelligent.''
   During the eight-year war with Iraq, in which a truce was
reached last August, Rafsanjani was Khomeini's representative on
the Supreme Defense Council, a nine-man board that determined
military strategy.
   He was given control of military affairs in June 1988, charged
with reversing Iran's defeats and turning its tired, fractious
forces into an effective fighting machine.
   Diplomats said Rafsanjani had sensed a growing weariness among
Iran's 50 million people and believed continuing the war was futile.
   Amin Taheri, former editor of the mass-circulation Tehran daily
Kayhan and now in exile, wrote in a recent book: ``Rafsanjani, a
conservative in social and economic policy, is a radical when it
comes to the issue of exercising power by revolutionary
institutions.''
   Taheri described Rafsanjani is ``a master of intrigue and a
capable tactician.''
   To many Western leaders, Rafsanjani represents a more acceptable
face of the Islamic revolution because he believes Iran needs
outside help with reconstruction and that most Iranians are weary
of being pariahs.
   While Rafsanjani appears committed to the fundamentalist
revolution and its spread, his pragmatism _ some call it
opportunism _ sets him apart from most Iranian leaders.
   He was at the center of the clandestine arms-for-hostages deal
with the United States in 1985-86 and was vulnerable when rivals
sought to discredit him, but with characteristic political agility,
he emerged on top.
   Rafsanjani was born in Behraman, a village in Rafsanjan province
on the edge of Iran's central desert. His father was a pistachio
farmer of moderate means.
   Khomeini was one of his instructors at the theological seminary
in the holy city of Qom, and Rafsanjani joined Khomeini's
opposition to the monarchy. He helped organize riots in 1963, and
was instrumental in establishing the network of clerics that became
Khomeini's revolutionary underground.

   Parliament speaker Hashemi Rafsanjani
appeared certain to win the presidency Friday, and Iranians who
flocked to vote expressed hope he would provide a better life after
10 years of revolution and war.
   Interior Minister Ali Akbar Mohtashemi said voting was so heavy
that many of the 26,000 polling stations would stay open an extra
seven hours until midnight. Some were reported to have run out of
ballots.
   Mohtashemi said on television his security agencies had foiled
plots to disrupt voting by opposition groups with the support of
``global arrogance,'' an Iranian synonym for the United States and
its allies. He did not elaborate.
   Nearly all voters questioned by reporters in Tehran said they
supported Rafsanjani because they believed he would put the economy
before revolutionary ideology.
   The 54-year-old parliament speaker has emerged as Iran's most
powerful figure since the death June 3 of Ayatollah Ruhollah
Khomeini, the Shiite Moslem patriarch whose fundamentalist
revolution overthrew Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi in February 1979.
   Rafsanjani, a cleric of middle rank, is expected to move toward
restoring relations with the West and making the economy and
society more liberal than the stern models laid down by Khomeini.
   ``We know Rafsanjani can't perform miracles, but we feel he's
the only man who can improve things,'' engineer Parzolah Armandi
said after voting in Tehran's southern slums.
   ``We're tired of lining up for food,'' said Masoumeh Gazian, a
housewife in the Nehdat Islami district who said she voted for
Rafsanjani.
   ``We expect him to make goods more plentiful and bring down
prices,'' she said, herding her six children.
   Those comments reinforced the widely held belief that Rafsanjani
would win the two-candidate race by a landslide and become the
fourth president since the revolution.
   He also will be the most powerful, if voters endorse
constitutional changes that increase the office's power. The
amendments submitted to a referendum abolish the post of prime
minister and put the president in charge of the government,
answerable only to the 270-seat parliament.
   The aim is to eliminate competing power centers that have
paralyzed government and impeded economic reform.
   Rafsanjani's opponent, Abass Sheibani, is a member of parliament
and former agriculture minister. He was a student activist against
the monarchy in the 1940s, spent 13 years in prison and was a
candidate for president in 1981.
   Sheibani, 58, has no national political base and was generally
considered a token opponent.
   Newspaper polls predicted a vote of 86 percent for Rafsanjani
and 11 for Sheibani.
   No estimate was available of how many of the 25 million eligible
voters turned out in the stifling summer heat. The minimum voting
age in Iran is 16.
   About 17 million participated in parliamentary elections last
year and in the last contest for president in 1985, during the
eight-year war with Iraq in which a truce was reached in August.
   Whole families went to Tehran's voting stations Friday. Women in
black head-to-toe chador robes voted in booths separate from those
for men.
   Mohtashemi, the interior minister, said at noon that ``polling
stations are asking for more personnel'' in some provinces to
handle the crowds.
   Rafsanjani was so confident of victory that he did not bother
campaigning. Diplomatic sources said he already had formed a
Cabinet, including economists and technocrats to handle the massive
task of reconstruction.
   An expected challenge from radical rivals led by Mohtashemi and
Khomeini's son Ahmad has not materialized, apparently because
Rafsanjani and his ally, incumbent President Ali Khamenei,
outmaneuvered them.
   Diplomats and analysts have not ruled out trouble, however, if
Rafsanjani tries to move too fast or to compromise what the
radicals view as Khomeini's ideological legacy.
   Television showed Rafsanjani voting at a special booth in the
courtyard of the revered Khomeini's modest residence in Jamaran, a
north Tehran suburb.
   Like other voters, he put two ballots into separate boxes, one
wrapped in white cloth for president, the other in green cloth for
the referendum.
   About 100 Revolutionary Guards and local residents chanted
``Allah is great!'' and cheered as Rafsanjani arrived and walked
down a path strewn with flowers.

   President Bush today deplored votes by the
House of Representatives to cut four major defense systems but
predicted that his view would prevail by the time Congress finishes
work on his military budget.
   At a wide-ranging news conference, Bush adopted a soft-toned
approach to the House's defense bill slashes. But he said Thursday
was ``not the House's most memorable moment.''
   ``But we're going to keep on fighting for what we believe in,''
the president said. He said he would not accept further cuts in the
Star Wars budget to protect his other defense programs.
   ``I do not want to negotiate with the Soviet Union without as
many cards in my hands as possible,'' he added.
   Bush also foresaw ultimate victory in his fight to keep $50
billion of the cost of rescuing the savings and loan industry out
of the budget _ and the deficit. House-Senate conferees voted
Thursday night to reject Bush's plan and make the cost of the
bailout reflected in the deficit and reduce the long-term interest
cost.
   And on a third controversy in Congress, Bush disputed critics
who contend his attempt to amend the Constitution to prevent the
desecration of the American flag will wind up weakening the rights
of all Americans.
   ``We thought about it because you don't want to weaken
anyuthing, but I feel so strongly that a very carefully drawn
amendment can solve this problem that I don't worry about it.''
   He declined to say if he would sign a Democratic bill that would
make the act of destroying the flag illegal but stop short of
making it part of the Constitution. A House committee approved such
a measure Thursday, with bipartisan support even though many
Republicans agreed with Bush that a constitutional amendment is the
proper solution.
   Bush said he felt no ``disrespect'' for members of Congress who
want to go the legislative, rather than the amendment route, to
deal with the flag desecration issue.
   The issue arose when the Supreme Court ruled 5-4 that a Texas
law against flag burning was an unconstititoonal interference with
the rights of free speech.
   Bush called the news conference to ballyhoo the decision by
Arkansas congressman Tommy Robinson to switch parties, from the
Democratic to the Republican fold.
   Robinson, the third Democrat in three days to make the switch,
explained his decision: ``I simply cannot wait any longer for the
liberal leadership of the Democratic Party to see the light.''
   The focus of the news conference was clearly not on Robinson but
on the legislative setbacks that Bush has suffered in the last few
days.
   If he had to rate Congress' record so far, Bush said, ``I
wouldn't give it very high marks.'' He said that just because he
isn't attacking Congress ``in a personal way does not mean I'm
happy with the legislative calendar.'' He said Congress had
discarded his appeal to act on the S&amp;L crisis within 60 days.
   Still, Bush told reporters, ``I think we will prevail for most
of what we want.'' He pointed to the forthcoming defense battle in
the Senate, which he hopes will rescue his defense program.
   The House voted this week to slash spending for the B-2 Stealth
bomber, the Star Wars program, to make the MX missile mobile and to
eliminate all funding for the Midgetman missile.
   ``I'm going to put a lot of emphasis on the Senate and we will
work with people like (House Armed Services Committee) Chairman
(Les) Aspin, who does not want to see the defense bill gutted,''
Bush said.
   ``And I do think we will prevail for most of what we want _ a
strong SDI (Star Wars) program, a strong B-2 (stealth bomber)
program,'' he said.
   On other issues:
   _Bush said he still has confidence in William Lucas, his
embattled nominee to become chief civil rights enforcer in the
Justice Department.
   ``I am convinced that much of the criticism (against Lucas) is
pure gut American politics,'' he said.
   Bush said he was working hard to save the nomination. Critics
say Lucas lacks experience.
   _Bush carefully sidestepped questions about Felix S. Bloch, the
ranking American diplomat suspected of spying for the KGB.
   ``I can't give you the facts on it,'' the president said of the
spy case. ``I don't want to go into it while it is under
investgation.''
   He said he was ``very concerned about premature discussion and
disclosure _ that means leaks _ on this matter, because I think you
can jeopardize the case itself and perhaps the man's ability to get
a fair hearing.''
   _He came down on the side of the Commerce Department in its
decision to allow the export of small personal computers to the
Soviet Union, while acknowledging that Defense Secretary Dick
Cheney had opposed the switch in policy.
   ``We did have a difference inside the administration on this
question,'' Bush said. But he said he was confident that the
Commerce Department stance ``will not endanger the legitimate
national security needs of this country.''
   _Bush also defended his proposal to cut the rate at which
capital gains are taxed. Speaker Tom Foley and other Democratic
leaders have been fighting it.
   Bush hinted he would accept a compromise on that issue, but he
said his plan would stimulate the creation of both jobs and new
small businesses.''

   Here is a transcript of President Bush's news
conference Friday.
   Bush: Well, in the past seven months, many distinguished
Americans serving in congressional, state, and local offices across
this country have decided to change their party allegiance from
Democrat to Republican.
   Men and women of great diversity, but they're united by a deep
devotion to this nation's traditional values, to building an
economy that provides growth and opportunity, and to ensuring that
America stands for peace with freedom in every corner of the globe.
   They represent a growing groundswell of support, a new majority
that sees the Republican Party, our Grand Old Party, the Grand New
Party, as best able to lead a strong America through the decade of
the '90s into the new millennium.
   And so it is a great privilege for me to welcome to the
Republican Party a man who stands by the faith of his principles
and has helped keep America free, Arkansas' Rep. Tommy Robinson, a
man of exceptional caliber.
   Tommy Robinson is a man of the people, a man who believes in
straight talk, hard work, and getting the job done; rebuilding our
defenses, standing up for veterans, for small business; and
fighting the war on drugs.
   So, Tommy _ whoops _
   Robinson: I'm on the wrong side.
   Bush: Welcome to our party.
   Robinson: He's used to me being a Democrat. He looks to his
left. (Laughter).
   Bush: Well, I should welcome my _ your party, the Republican
Party.
   We look forward to working with you.
   And I'm going to ask the congressman to say a few words, and
then both he and I will respond to some questions.
   I might welcome my old colleague John Paul Hammerschmidt here,
and Guy Vander Jagt, two classmates of mine in the Congress who
feel as enthusiastic about this as I do, and also, of course, our
party chairman.
   (It's) all yours.
   Robinson: Thank you, Mr. President, for your kind words of
welcome to the Republican Party.
   I am grateful for your confidence and support.
   I look forward to working closely with you in building an even
stronger America in Arkansas.
   Public service has been the cornerstone of my life.
   I have served at the local, county, state, and federal levels
for the past 30 years.
   I chose a life of public service because my parents taught me
that if you worked for the government, you worked for the people,
you served people.
   My parents raised me in the tradition of Harry Truman,
lunch-bucket Democrats, and patriotism without apology.
   But today, to best serve the people of Arkansas and to stay true
to the values of my family and an ever-increasing number of
Arkansans, I can no longer be a member of the national Democratic
Party.
   This is a very personal, private decision.
   It has been long in coming because, frankly, I hoped that the
national Democratic Party would come back home and once again be in
touch with the mainstream of the American people.
   But even after losing five of the last six presidential
elections, both nationwide and in Arkansas, the leadership of the
national Democratic Party still is unwilling to listen to the
majority of the American people.
   If I am to meet the needs of my people, I simply cannot wait any
longer for the liberal leadership of the Democratic Party to see
the light.
   The hard fact is that there is and will be no room for
conservative Southern Democrats in today's national Democratic
Party.
   Now my conscience is clear.
   I have made my decision.
   I am excited about our new partnership with President Bush.
   I know it will be good for the future of all the people of
Arkansas.
   Mr. President, I am proud to stand with you and the Republican
Party, knowing we share the common goal of getting the job done for
America and Arkansas.

<HEAD>President Hints at Compromise on Capital-Gains Taxes</HEAD>
<HEAD>With AM-Bush</HEAD>

   President Bush said Friday he is willing to
compromise with Congress on his proposal to cut capital-gains taxes
and he repeated his contention that such a reduction would actually
increase revenues.
   ``If there's some compromise that can spur investment, spur
jobs, increase employment _ the cause of new jobs starting up _ I'd
be interested in it,'' Bush told a news conference. ``I don't think
I should ever say it's got to be done just this way in terms of the
bills up there in the House Ways and Means Committee right now.''
   Bush's proposal would cut the 33-percent maximum capital-gains
rate to 15 percent, which would apply to stocks and most other
assets, but not timber and real estate. There is little support for
that proposal among Democrats on the committee.
   However, all 13 committee Republicans and six Democrats _ a
majority of the panel _ are backing a substitute by Rep. Edgar
Jenkins, D-Ga. It would cut the top rate to 20 percent for two
years for assets including timber and real estate, then raise it to
28 percent and protect against taxation of gains that are
attributable solely to inflation.
   Democratic leaders have blocked a vote on that proposal while
they negotiate toward a compromise with the Bush administration.
   Rep. Dan Rostenkowski, D-Ill., the committee chairman, told
reporters Friday: ``All we have been doing is discussing but
there's no offer'' of a compromise.
   ``A rate ... (reduction) is absolutely out of the question,'' he
added.
   Under discussion is a plan that, instead of cutting the
capital-gains rate, would prevent taxation of inflation-caused
profits and exempt from taxation an additional 1 percent a year of
asset value.
   Democrats generally oppose a cut in the capital-gains tax rate
because 80 percent of the tax reduction would go to those with
incomes over $100,000 a year. They also insist that while a
reduction would accelerate sales of investment temporarily, after a
year or so a cut in the rate would reduce revenues.
   Bush addressed both points Friday, as he did regularly during
his campaign last year.
   ``I have a good sound proposal. It was tested'' during the
campaign. ``And the other side, particularly the liberal Democrats,
... attacked me as having some kind of tax cut favoring the rich,''
he said. ``It's nothing like that at all.''
   As for causing a long-term revenue loss, he pointed to the
experience of a capital-gains reduction enacted in 1978. ``It's not
a revenue loser,'' he said.
   The Treasury Department predicts Bush's proposed reduction in
the capital-gains tax rate would raise $16.1 billion over five
years but then would lose $20.1 billion over the next three years.
   The staff of the Joint Committee on Taxation estimates that a
total revenue gain of $4 billion in 1989 and 1990, followed by a
string of losses that would total $71 billion through 1999.

War</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Moslem guerrillas fired rockets into
Kabul on Friday, killing 10 people, and Foreign Minister Abdul
Wakil accused the United States and Pakistan of preparing a major
offensive to oust his government.
   Bakhtar state news agency reported 17 surface-to-surface rockets
hit residential areas of the Afghan capital, killing 10 people and
injuring 19.
   Wakil told reporters the United States and Pakistan are talking
peace but preparing for war against his Soviet-backed government.
   He urged the two countries to stop arming Afghan rebels ``and
take some effective, practical steps toward a political solution.''
   He expressed hope that U.S. and Soviet diplomats will focus on a
comprehensive political settlement of Afghanistan's 11-year civil
war when they meet Monday in Stockholm.
   As Wakil left the airport after returning from a 12-day trip to
Ethiopia and India, a rocket exploded less than a mile away,
churning up a cloud of dust. The extent of damage or casualties was
not known immediately.
   Several other rockets later struck the same Microrayon area, a
residential district for government employees that once housed
Soviet officials before the last Red Army troops withdrew Feb. 15.
   In the past month, fundamentalist Moslem guerrillas have been
launching long-range rockets from behind the hills that ring the
mile-high capital. More than 200 people, nearly all civilians, been
killed in the attacks and a car bombing.
   Wakil was asked whether he has discerned any progress toward a
political settlement following last month's Washington meeting
between President Bush and Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto of
Pakistan.
   The two agreed for the first time to press for a political
solution in Afghanistan but said they will continue arming the
guerrillas and seeking to oust President Najib, a former secret
police chief who is staunchly backed by Moscow.
   ``I think they verbally speak of political settlement, but in
practice they have concentrated all their efforts to intensify
aggression and war,'' he said.
   The foreign minister cited reports quoting unidentified Bush
advisers as saying Washington will arm the guerrillas with advanced
new weapons to combat high-altitude bombing attacks by the Afghan
air force.
   ``We are of the opinion that the United States of America is
getting prepared for the battle season and for the extensive
offensive in the coming months instead of preparing for a peaceful
solution,'' he said.
   The foreign minister said the Afghan government considers the
U.S.-Soviet meeting in Stockholm useful. The U.S. delegation will
be led by John Kelly, assistant secretary of state for Near Eastern
and South Asian affairs, and roving Ambassador Nikolai I. Kozyrev
will guide the Soviets.
   ``The most important thing that the United States and the Soviet
Union should do ... (is) encourage hostile groups to find the
possibility for starting dialogue, talks and negotiations,'' Wakil
said.
   ``I think the United States and the Soviet Union in the meeting
should talk over an extensive, comprehensive program for the
Republic of Afghanistan for the settlement of the problem because
the cessation or stopping of the supply of weapons is not enough.''
   Wakil said the United States won't succeed in a military
solution. The Kabul government did not collapse after the Soviet
pullout, as Western governments predicted, and it won't fall in the
future, he said.
   He also said the Afghan leadership's desire for a settlement has
dictated its great patience in dealing with Pakistan, which he
charged is openly at war with Kabul.
   In Addis Ababa, Wakil said, he received support for
Afghanistan's peace initiatives from 30 leaders of the Organization
of African Unity meeting there.
   He said he also held talks in New Delhi on Thursday with Indian
Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi, who has discussed a political
settlement in Afghanistan with Ms. Bhutto, Soviet President Mikhail
S. Gorbachev and U.N. Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar.

<TEXT>
   India decided to resume withdrawing
its peacekeeping troops Friday, on one of the island nation's worst
days of ethnic violence in which state TV reported 74 people were
killed.
   The decision to start pulling out more troops starting Saturday
averted a showdown with Sri Lankan President Ranasinghe Premadasa,
who had called the continued Indian presence a threat to his
nation's independence.
   The Bush administration said it hopes the agreement saves lives.
   ``We welcome this development and hope that India and Sri Lanka
will be successful in reaching an agreement on a timetable for
withdrawal that minimizes bloodshed while recognizing Sri Lanka's
sovereignty and independence,'' said State Department spokeswoman
Margaret Tutwiler.
   Television in Colombo said most of those who died were killed by
Sri Lankan forces in areas where the Indians are not deployed. Most
died in the Sinhalese heartland, where extremists from Premadasa's
own ethnic community have violently protested government peace
efforts with the Tamil minority and the continued presence of the
Indian troops.
   Tamils, who make up 18 percent of Sri Lanka's 16 million people,
say they are discriminated against by the Sinhalese, who account
for 75 percent of the population and control the government and
armed forces.
   India, spurred by its own politically powerful Tamil minority of
60 million, sponsored the July 29, 1987, peace accord designed to
give Tamils some autonomy in northern and eastern Sri Lanka. But
the biggest Tamil guerrilla group, the Liberation Tigers of Tamil
Eelam, reneged on the pact and started attacking the Indians.
   The telecast referred to those who died Friday as
``troublemakers and disruptive elements'' _ terms frequently used
for Sinhalese radicals.
   It said 16 people were killed when they attacked a police
station at Mannikhina near Kandy, about 60 miles northeast of
Colombo.
   Sri Lankan security forces killed 21 more people who defied a
curfew to stage anti-India demonstrations in the Monargala district
about 100 miles east of Colombo, state TV said.
   Five people were killed when they ignored a curfew in the
predominantly Tamil town of Batticaloa, 100 miles northeast of
Colombo, the newscast said.
   The other deaths were scattered throughout central and southern
Sri Lanka.
   Premadasa originally sought the departure of all of India's
45,000 soldiers by Saturday. He announced the decision about an
hour after it was publicized by government spokesmen in Colombo and
New Delhi.
   Neither side indicated how many Indian soldiers would leave, but
only a token force was likely to depart.
   Foreign Minister Ranjan Wijeratne and six other Sri Lankan
officials were to fly to New Delhi to discuss a timetable for the
withdrawal of the rest of the Indian troops.
   Premadasa sought to portray the Indian decision as a victory.
The two-year Indian military presence has fueled Sri Lanka's ethnic
violence among the Tamil guerrillas that the Indians were supposed
to disarm and Sinhalese extremists who denounced the Indian
presence as a violation of Sri Lankan sovereignty.
   ``The protests staged against the continuance of the IPKF
(Indian peace keeping force) in our country can now cease,'' he
said. ``By resorting to strikes and disruptive activities based on
such protests we are causing damage and harm to ourselves. It is
our own people who get killed.''
   Military troops and police were enforcing a nationwide curfew
designed to thwart threatened disruptions by Sinhalese radicals
accused of killing 4,000 people _ mostly Sinhalese government
officials and supporters _ since Indian troops started arriving
July 30, 1987.
   The curfew began Thursday and was to continue until dawn Sunday.
   Another 11,000 people, including 1,000 Indian soldiers, have
died in the Tamil separatist war that started in 1983.
   Premadasa said the talks in New Delhi were ``to prepare a time
frame, a timetable, for the complete withdrawal of the Indian army
and also to ensure the cessation of offensive military operations
and for reviewing the implementation of the Indo-Sri Lanka accord.''
   The compromise under which India was to resume its troop
withdrawal was signed Friday in Colombo by the Indian High
Commissioner, or ambassador, Lakhan Lal Mehrotra, and by Sri Lankan
foreign Secretary Bernard Tillekeratne.
   In New Delhi, Foreign Ministry spokesman Aftab Seth called the
agreement a ``victory of reason, goodwill and good sense.''
   At the peak of its involvement in Sri Lanka, India's
peacekeeping force numbered at least 70,000. The most recent
withdrawals were in January and February when about 5,000 Indian
soldiers left shortly after Premadasa took office.

<HEAD>WASHN: and Arkansas.</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   I am, as are most people in my state, impressed with the
philosophy and the practical solutions you are presenting.
   I, too, believe in less government, not more.
   And I, too, believe that we must first seek government
efficiency and cut government waste before asking the American
taxpayers to pay even more.
   I, too, believe that we must dramatically improve our
educational institutions if we are to compete in the modern world.
   I, too, believe in the strong defense policy which has finally
forced the Soviets to real negotiations.
   Mr. President, peace through strength is once again a proven
concept, and I, too, believe in preserving the traditional family
values that must be the moral backbone of the nation.
   Mr. President, today I am translating our shared beliefs into
positive action by joining the Republican Party.
   I am enthusiastic about working with you.
   I know that my optimism about what this new partnership will
mean for all the people of Arkansas is fully warranted.
   Thank you, Mr. President.
   We in Arkansas are proud of you.
   Bush: Thank you, Tommy.
   Now, be glad to take questions, and I expect the congressman
will, so address them as you will.
   But we should start off with the AP I think today.
   Q. Mr. President, the House has just turned your Pentagon
spending priorities inside out, and it's leaving a shambles that
Congressman Aspin says is a ``Michael Dukakis defense bill.'' What
steps are you _ what movement are you willing to make to turn it
back to a George Bush defense bill? And I have a follow-up.
   Bush: Putting a lot of emphasis on the Senate, work with people
like Chairman Aspin who does not want to see the defense bill
gutted, and I think that we will prevail for most of what we want.
   We have a strategic concept, and what I need is a strong SDI
program, a strong B-2 program.
   We're doing reasonably well on many of our conventional force
allocations there.
   But I do not want to negotiate with the Soviet Union without as
many cards in my hand as possible, so there's an arms control
dimension to what we're talking about, too.
   But we've sent up a solid strategic program.
   I am disappointed that the House did what they did.
   We have a defense secretary who has made some tough cuts, and
set some priorities, and done that which many have failed to do,
and that is to cut out some systems.
   But then the House, regrettably, is looking at it more narrowly
than I am, and they have restored some of the very things that the
secretary of defense and the Joint Chiefs felt that we could get
along without.
   In fact, I see that they are even talking about trying to keep
open some of the bases that we have suggested be closed, and that
isn't _ it's not easy to close a base.
   So I want to get support across the board in the Congress for
our defense program, and yesterday was not the House's most
memorable moment.
   But we're going to keep fighting on for what we believe in.
   Q. You've said that you think you can get most of what you want.
Would you be willing to scale back on SDI, for example, to win back
some money from stealth bomber which you think is so critical?

   The state comptroller refused Friday to
certify Yonkers' 1989-90 budget because the City Council refuses to
clearly allocate money for court-ordered school construction in a
desegregation plan.
   The move could send the city into technical default and subject
it to a spending plan imposed by a judge.
   The budget struggle stems from the City Council's long-term
opposition to court-ordered desegregation, a stance that nearly put
the city into bankruptcy last year when a federal judge imposed a
series of fines.
   Spokesman Marvin Nailor said state Comptroller Edward Regan
would not sign off on the $372.3 million budget approved by the
City Council on Thursday because there was no clear inclusion of
$24 million for court-ordered school construction.
   The state Emergency Financial Control Board had refused to
approve an earlier, similar version of the budget because the $24
million had been drawn from the city's surplus and was not in a
fund designating it specifically for the schools.
   A compromise budget, submitted by the control board, utilized
about $12 million of the surplus combined with cuts and other
funding in an account earmarked for the schools, but it was
rejected two weeks ago by the City Council.
   The control board has imposed a wage and hiring freeze on the
city.
   The budget rejected by Regan had the school funding money in an
account called ``Claims and Judgments,'' with no particular
reference or formal allocation to the Board of Education.
   ``The majority of this council is dead set against putting their
fingerprints on anything related to desegregation,'' complained
Mayor Nicholas Wasicsko.
   Without a certified budget, the city would be technically in
default Monday, a situation under which the comptroller is supposed
to ask a state judge to impose a budget.
   City officials have indicated that the comptroller's office
would ask the judge to impose the control board's compromise
budget, which would avert layoffs, maintain service, and allow
leeway for raises.
   U.S. District Judge Leonard Sand had ordered new schools built
as a way of remedying the more than 40 years of segregation he had
found in the city's schools and housing.
   Earlier this week, the city voted to challenge the location for
one of the schools, saying it was parkland.
   Defiance of the housing portion of Sand's plan last summer left
the city on the brink of bankruptcy when fines he imposed escalated
to $1 million a day. On the first day of the $1 million fine, the
city agreed to comply with his housing order.

<TEXT>
   Israeli commandos armed with
silencer-equipped pistols today kidnapped a Shiite Moslem leader
allegedly linked to the abduction of a U.S. Marine and carried him
off to Israel in a helicopter, police said.
   Sheik Abdul Karim Obeid, 33, was seized at his apartment in
Jibchit, 21 miles north of the Israeli border.
   The Israeli military confirmed the seizure and said Obeid was
suspected of instigating attacks on Israel. It gave no details of
the abduction.
   President Bush told reporters in Washington he was unsure what
effect the raid would have on attempts to free the Marine. But Bush
added, ``I don't think kidnapping and violence helps the cause of
peace'' in the Middle East.
   He said his administration would contact Israeli officials to
discuss the abduction of Obeid and its consequences.
   Obeid is reputed to be the spiritual guide of the pro-Iranian
Hezbollah militia in south Lebanon and is Iran's closest ally in
the region. He denies links to Hezbollah, which is affiliated with
Shiite Moslem factions holding most of the 17 foreign hostages in
Lebanon. Nine hostages are Americans.
   Security sources in south Lebanon said one of the Americans,
Marine Lt. Col. William R. Higgins, was briefly held at Obeid's
apartment after his abduction in south Lebanon on Feb. 17, 1988.
   Lebanese police said an Israeli helicopter landed a commando
force about two miles west of Jibchit at 1 a.m.
   About 12 commandoes walked into Jibchit, surrounded Obeid's
building, then knocked on the door of his second-floor apartment
and forced their way in when the door was opened.
   ``The Israelis quickly moved in pointing silencer-equipped
pistols at the sheik, his cousin Ahmed Obeid and Majid Fahs, a
friend who was staying with them,'' the spokesman said.
   As the Israeli force was leaving with the three men, a neighbor,
Hussein Abu Zeid, ``apparently heard some noise and opened his door
to find out what was happening. They shot him in the head and he
died instantly,'' the spokesman added.
   Israel radio said the man was a bodyguard to Obeid.
   The Israeli army communique made no mention of the slaying. It
said the Israelis suffered no casualties.
   The police spokesman said Obeid's wife, Mona, was locked in a
room with her hands tied and her mouth taped. He said the Israelis
also locked the door where Obeid's three sons and two daughters
were sleeping.
   A security source in Lebanon said there was speculation Obeid
may have been kidnapped ``as a possible swap'' for Higgins or for
three missing Israeli soldiers.
   Two of the soldiers, Yossi Fink and Rahamin Alsheikh, were
captured Feb. 17, 1986, when guerrillas ambushed their patrol in
Israel's self-proclaimed ``security zone'' in southern Lebanon. The
third, navigator Ron Arad, was captured by Shiite militiamen Oct.
16, 1986, when his plane was shot down over southern Lebanon.
   Higgins, 44, of Danville, Ky., was heading an observer group
attached to the U.N. peacekeeping force in Lebanon at the time of
his abduction. He was seized in the southern port of Tyre, near the
base of the mainstream Shiite Moslem Amal militia.
   One of the Lebanese security sources said the late leader of
Amal in south Lebanon, Daoud Daoud, sent ``a group of his followers
to obtain Higgins' release from Obeid's apartment, but the force
was encircled by Hezbollah gunmen, stripped of its weapons and sent
back.''
   The source said Higgins' kidnappers, the Organization of the
Oppressed on Earth, then moved the Marine out of Jibchit.
   Residents of Jibchit, which is 35 miles south of Beirut, said
Amal called a general mobilization of its militia in the area to
confront the Israeli force and rescue Obeid, but it was too late.
   One resident, speaking on condition of anonymity, said local
Amal leaders urged ``whoever is capable of carrying weapons to join
a campaign in search of Sheik Obeid.''
   ``I heard the helicopter flying as the general mobilization call
was blared,'' he said.
   Obeid has been the imam, or local religious leader, of Jibchit
since 1984. He succeeded Sheik Raged Hard, who was shot to death by
unknown gunmen.
   The Israeli communique, issued more than 15 hours after the
raid, said Obeid was raised and educated in Iran and was an
instigator of attacks on Israeli army forces and Israel.
   ``He dealt with encouraging the struggle and authorizing
terrorist attacks against Israel,'' the communique said. ``He also
dealt with passing on weapons to Hezbollah guerrillas in the south
and arranging shelter for those who committed the attacks.''

<HEAD>Rabbis: Israel Forbidden to Withdraw From West Bank</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SERGEI SHARGORODSKY</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>JERUSALEM (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Leading Orthodox rabbis issued a religious
ruling Friday that said Jewish law forbids Israel from withdrawing
from the occupied West Bank.
   In response, a left-leaning religious legislator accused the
chief rabbinate of interfering in politics and another politician
called for an investigation of the religious body.
   In the one-page ruling published Friday, the rabbis said
``pikuach nefesh,'' a central idea in Judaism that saving life
overshadows other religious commandments, ``obliges us not to
retreat from the borders we hold today.
   ``Withdrawal of the Israeli army may increase the danger of
fatal attacks from the abandoned territory,'' they said.
   Rabbinate spokesman Eitan Aizman said he interpreted the ruling
as saying ``it is a religious commandment to retain the land of
Israel in our hands.''
   Although not binding, their ruling is bound to be influential:
most Israeli Jews are Orthodox. Conservative and Reform Jewry, the
largest groups in the United States, are not represented in the
chief rabbinate.
   Israeli media reports said the ruling was issued in response to
a statement by Israel's former Chief Rabbi Ovadiya Yosef, who told
Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak last week that Halacha, or the
body of Jewish religious teaching, justifies a land compromise as a
matter of saving lives.
   The rabbinate said it was ``surprised and sorrowful'' because
Jews could tell a ``non-Jewish ruler: we are obliged by law to hold
on to Judea and Samaria but you are prepared to kill Jews if we
don't withdraw. Therefore, we have to withdraw.''
   The 19-month Palestinian uprising against Israel's 22-year
occupation of the West Bank and Gaza Strip has left more than 560
Palestinians and 36 Israelis dead. Israel fought wars with Arab
countries in 1967 and 1973.
   The chief rabbis' ruling referred only to Judea and Samaria, the
biblical names for the West Bank, and did not mention the occupied
Gaza Strip.
   It was published a day after Israel's Prime Minister Yitzhak
Shamir made an impassionate speech to leading rabbis in Jerusalem
for retaining all occupied land.
   ``It's possible to reach peace without, heaven forbid, giving up
a grain of the holy land of our forefathers,'' Shamir said. ``Peace
is not a monopoly of the traitors, concession-makers and
defeatists.''
   The chief rabbinate is presided over by Israel's two chief
Orthodox rabbis, Mordechai Eliahu representing Sephardi Jews from
Middle Eastern countries and Avraham Shapiro representing Ashkenasi
Jews from Europe and America.
   Sephardis and Ashkenasis have separate religious traditions.
   The rabbinate has made repeated but unsuccessful efforts to halt
movies and sports events on Saturday, the Jewish sabbath.
   Elazar Granot, a leader of the leftist Mapam party, responded to
Friday's ruling by demanding a government investigation to
determine whether the ruling ``wasn't an explicit and serious
deviation from the (rabbinate's) authority and whether proper
sanctions shouldn't be taken against this deviation.''
   Abraham Burg, a religious legislator from the Labor Party and
the son of a former Interior Minister Yosef Burg, charged that the
Rabbinate ``became part of the political establishment and somehow
lost its spiritual authority, becoming a pawn in the political
game.''
   ``Just as I don't expect the premier to rule about kosher, and
the chief of staff to teach me commandments, I don't expect chief
rabbis to get involved in state affairs,'' Burg told Israel army
radio.
   Burg's left-leaning Labor party advocates trading parts of the
occupied lands for peace. Shamir's right-wing Likud bloc opposes
any territorial compromise.
   The Palestine Liberation Organization has officially endorsed a
two-state solution but Islamic groups, another leading force in the
Palestinian uprising, want a Moslem state that would include Israel.

   A judge rejected mental-illness pleas
Friday and sentenced a retired librarian to the electric chair for
killing two policemen during a 1987 shopping-center rampage in
which four other people also died.
   William Bryan Cruse also was sentenced to 100 years in prison
without parole on the other four killings and lesser prison terms
on 26 other convictions of attempted murder, kidnapping and false
imprisonment.
   Judge John Antoon called the shooting spree in which 10 people
were wounded in nearby Palm Bay ``perhaps unsurpassed in the state
of Florida.''
   Under mandatory-minimum sentencing regulations, Cruse's total
prison sentence would be 103 years in prison unless he is executed
for the slayings of the two police officers.
   ``We are pleased that William Cruse has been finally sentenced
to death. We feel it is a just punishment for the war Mr. Cruse
declared on Palm Bay two years ago,'' said State Attorney Norm
Wolfinger.
   Assistant Public Defender Marlene Alva, Cruse's chief trial
lawyer, would not comment on the sentences except to say that
``somewhere down the line, someone has to determine competency for
execution.''
   An appeal of the convictions and sentences will be filed soon,
she said.
   Cruse told investigators after his capture, following a
seven-hour siege, that he ``got into trouble'' because everyone
believed he was homosexual. He said he was trying to get even with
people who taunted him and that he was ``drunk and crazy'' during
the shootout.
   Cruse refused an opportunity to address the court Friday, as he
has in the past, but he did appear to wipe away a tear or two while
one of the shooting victims recounted his experiences amidst sobs.
   ``When we entered that battlefield, we did not know whether we
would come out alive,'' said Larry Glynn, 43, as he told the court
how he and a friend, drove more than 15 shooting victims to safety
in their pickup during the shootout.
   ``If you really want to punish Mr. Cruse, let him live,'' Glynn
said.
   The central issue in the case was Cruse's mental state. The
defense pleaded temporary insanity caused by mental illness.
Psychiatric specialists on both sides agreed that Cruse was
mentally ill.
   But the prosecution convinced a jury in April that mental
illness was only one factor involved in a finding of criminal
insanity under Florida law.
   The jury recommended the death penalty on each of the six
first-degree murder counts, but the judge did not have to follow
that recommendation.
   Although rejecting insanity, the judge did accept arguments of
``extreme mental disturbance'' that lessened the penalties in the
slayings of the four civilians.
   He imposed life sentences, without possibility of parole for 25
years, in each of those murders.
   Antoon imposed life terms on each of 22 counts of attempted
first-degree murder and the kidnapping of a store clerk who was
held hostage most of the time Cruse was barricaded inside a
supermarket.
   Antoon also handed down 30-year sentences on each of two counts
of attempted second-degree murder and a 15-year term for false
imprisonment of a second store employee.
   Except for the first-degree-murder sentences, all other prison
terms are to run concurrently, and each carries a mandatory-minimum
of three years.

   Bush: I will point out to the American people that SDI has
already been cut in our own setting of priorities.
   We didn't want to do it.
   It was a tough decision for Secretary Cheney to make.
   I approved the decision and we don't need further cuts in SDI.
   Helen?
   Q. Mr. President, in the veto department, will you veto the S&amp;L
bill if a portion of the bailout is on the budget and will you veto
the flag desecration bill?
   Bush: It won't come to vetoing the S&amp;L because we have 40-plus
votes in the Senate that, staying firm, will see our proposal
prevail.
   The House, as you know, has disagreed with us, but I'm confident
that we will do all right on that one.
   I worry about bending and breaking the Gramm-Rudman limits and I
think it would send a very bad sign to international markets.
   So I don't think there's a problem there and on this other one,
different people have different ways of expressing their outrage
about the desecration of the flag.
   It's very interesting to see a groundswell of support for the
principle of protecting the American flag and so I will see what
comes down here, but I will continue to push for the approach that
I think is the best, given the Supreme Court decision.
   Q. It sounds like you might sign it.
   Bush: (I) didn't say that.
   Q. Mr. President, you have courted members of Congress
individually and collectively quite assiduously. You've been gentle
in your criticism of them when things have not gone your way. You
have been so again here today. In light of what is happening up
there to these defense priorities and in light of what I think many
members of Congress would acknowledge is a lot of parochial
politics being played with that bill, do you think it may now be
time for stronger medicine from you?
   Bush: Well, if I could think of a medicine that would cure the
ill, I would certainly apply it, because I'm not sure name-calling
or questioning somebody's motives _ it sometimes happens on the
hill questioning my motives _ Helen just asked about the flag _ but
I don't know that that's the approach that's going to be successful.
   We're going to keep working with the Congress, but _ Tommy
Robinson _ here's a good time to say, with the underpinning of the
principles that I was elected on and we're going to keep doing that.
   I'm not sure I need to get into the name-calling.
   We'd be out here all day, if I said what I felt on that.
   Q. Well, are you not concerned, sir, that this affable approach
to this sort of thing will make you appear weak?
   Bush: No, I'm not concerned at all.
   We have a Democratic majority in the Senate, a Democratic
majority in the House.
   I have to work with these people.
   I will work with these people.

   Thousands of striking Russians went
back to work Friday in Estonia as their representatives began talks
with a government commission set up to consider complaints that new
Estonian laws infringe on their voting rights.
   ``We are working during the talks,'' said Gennady Korol, a
strike committee spokesman at the Tallinn shipyard.
   Local activists, meanwhile, applauded preliminary approval in
Moscow by the national legislature of a law giving the three Baltic
states _ Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania _ greater control over their
economies, including the possibility of creating their own
currencies.
   The Russian workers went on strike a week ago to protest a law
requiring many of them to learn to speak Estonian, and another
demanding two years residency to vote and at least five years
residency to stand for office. Russian speakers make up a third of
the Baltic republic's 1.6 million population.
   Mark R. Shlendukhov, a strike committee spokesman, said as many
as 32 factories had stopped work at the height of the strike. But a
journalist for the Estonian Telegraph Agency, Elkond Liebman, said
the number was about 15.
   In Moscow, the Supreme Soviet on Thursday approved the first of
three necessary readings of two resolutions that would give the
republics economic independence by Jan. 1.
   ``We thought it was a great victory because we got an
overwhelming majority in the parliament,'' said Rein Veidemann,
chairman of the 11-member governing board of the Estonian Popular
Front. ``It's an economic victory and also a big political
victory.''
   Mikhail Bronstein, an Estonian economist credited with devising
the autonomy plan, said the version given preliminary approval
Thursday by the Supreme Soviet will allow his republic to have its
own monetary and financial system.
   Bronstein said a separate currency would allow for price reform.
Many state-set prices have no relation to costs in the Soviet
Union, but the Kremlin has hesitated to eliminiate hidden subsidies
of food and housing for fear of mass unrest.
   The resolutions, if passed into law, would wrest control of
industry from Moscow-based ministries and gives it to the republic.
Businesses or groups of enterprises would be permitted to trade
directly with firms in the other 14 Soviet republics.
   ``We can use the ruble for trade with other republics, while our
own currency would be used to defend the population against
inflation and wild fluctuation of prices'' by controlling the new
money supply while introducing market force economics, Bronstein
said.
   The Soviet Union blames a vast oversupply of rubles for many of
its own economic problems. Wages have risen faster than production,
so workers have plenty of cash, but there is nothing to buy.
   The Baltic republics have complained for years that Moscow
ministries exploited the once-independent republics, taking away
their natural resources and giving little back.
   The legislature debated two days before initial approval of the
two resolutions by what the Tass news agency said was an
overwhelming majority of the 412 deputies present. It called on the
Cabinet to draw up draft laws for ratification by the Supreme
Soviet by Oct. 1.
   The first resolution calls for Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia to
convert to a profit and loss cost accounting system, which would
allow them to sign independent trade agreements with the other 12
Soviet republics.
   The second approved a draft law on economic independence.
Lithuania and Estonia have already declared themselves sovereign.
   Vice President Anatoly I. Lukyanov made it clear the resolutions
apply to all three republics, although Latvia's Supreme Soviet only
approved economic independence plans Thursday and had no time to
give its proposals to Moscow.
   Critics of the resolutions said it was unfair to grant the
Baltics economic freedom before such rights were offered to all the
republics.
   Under the proposed legislation, Baltic trade relations between
Moscow and other Soviet republics will be based on contracts rather
than the present ``command system'' whereby ministers in Moscow
make economic decisions, said Tarmu Tammerk, an editor at the
Estonian newspaper Kodumaa.
   Estonia, with Western-style shops and an atmosphere more like
nearby Finland than the Soviet Union, has been a proving ground for
many of President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's economic and political
reforms.
   In the republic of Georgia, meanwhile, a newspaper said clashes
there in the past two weeks have killed 14 people and injured 448.
   Nine of the 14 dead were Abkhazian, the Georgian newspaper Zarya
Vostoka said, while 302 of the 448 injured were Georgian.
   At least three of the dead may have been killed for non-ethnic
reasons, the newspaper said. Tass has reported a higher death toll
of 21, but there was no explanation of the discrepancy.
   Georgian activists claim that the Abkhazian rioting was preceded
by weeks of threats by Abkhazian activists, and during that time
they obtained massive amounts of arms.
   Although both Georgians and Abkhazians claim discrimination,
Georgian activists say the unrest was deliberately instigated to
divert attention from their demands for independence, and to break
Abkhazia off from the rest of Georgia.

   Explorer Will Steger and his
International Trans-Antarctica Expedition team were into the second
day Friday of their $11 million, 4,000-mile, seven-month traverse
of the continent.
   Steger, of Ely, and his five foreign companions left from the
northwestern tip of the Antarctic Peninsula on Thursday, five days
ahead of schedule on a quest intended to alert the world to
environmental dangers and to Antarctica's tradition of peace.
   The trek also could establish Steger as the contemporary expert
on cold-weather survival, putting him in the company of such
turn-of-the-century heroes as Robert Peary, Roald Amundsen and
Robert Falcon Scott.
   ``I'm still too busy to think about what all this means,'' the
44-year-old Steger said moments before his anxious dogs broke free
of the sled brake and raced off. ``I've got a lot riding on this
and it'll be good to be out on the ice so I can sort it all through
my mind.''
   An ABC-TV field producer and a three-person film crew from
France loaded their own sled and mushed after the expedition team
to record its first week on the ice.
   The St. Paul-based expedition team spent Wednesday night camped
on the Larsen Ice Shelf beneath a ridge of mountain peaks known as
Seal Nunataks, on the northwestern tip of the Antarctic Peninsula.
Temperatures fell to about 8 below zero, but the sky remained
unseasonably clear and still.
   TV and newspaper reporters flew to the peninsula from King
George Island Thursday morning, capitalizing on a rare and
expansive window of clear weather to chronicle the official launch.
The ice shelf was slick with hard-packed snow and patches of blue
ice. Daytime temperatures reached 10 above zero, with the sun
blindingly bright.
   The four-day window of clear weather that has held since Steger
arrived at King George Island Monday is rare for this time of the
austral winter.
   ``We've been really blessed with this weather,'' Steger said.
``This is probably the warmest it will be for the next seven
months.''
   Once on the ice, the mushers seemed little concerned with the
deeper meaning of their journey and were focused on more immediate
matters: weather, packing, teaming sled dogs to avoid fights.
   ``I can't think about seven months,'' said Keizo Funatsu of
Japan. ``I only think about one day and one day and one day.''
   French arctic explorer Jean-Louis Etienne, a physician, pointed
reporters away from the dramatic mountains of the peninsula toward
the endless white monotony of the ice shelf.
   ``The peninsula is the best part of Antarctica and is very
beautiful,'' he said, then nodded to the flat, featureless plateau.
``But that is what we will look at most of the time _ nothing.''
   In 1986, Steger and several other companions reached the North
Pole via dogsleds and joined forces with Etienne, who had skied
there alone.
   The Antarctic expedition will be accompanied by film crews again
in October in the Ellsworth Mountains where the peninsula widens
into the endless interior ice cap, and at the South Pole about
Thanksgiving. The mushers hope to reach the Soviet scientific base
of Mirnyy, on the continent's eastern shore, by March 1.

<HEAD>Mississippi Won't Appeal Ruling on Opening Sovereignty Records</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A federal judge has ordered that records
of the defunct state Sovereignty Commission _ which tried to thwart
the work of civil rights groups in the 1950s and 1960s _ be opened
to the public.
   ``The state of Mississippi acted directly through its state
Sovereignty Commission and through conspiracy with private
individuals to deprive the plaintiffs of rights protected by the
Constitution to free speech and association, to personal privacy,
and to lawful search and seizure, and statutes of the United
States,'' U.S. District Judge William H. Barbour Jr. ruled Thursday.
   Barbour permanently barred the state from enforcing a law making
it a crime to disclose the records, which have been sealed since
1977. But the judge ruled that the records won't be released
pending a possible appeal.
   Assistant Attorney General Jim Warren said Friday the state
won't appeal. Gov. Ray Mabus said he supported that decision.
   ``We feel that by closing this chapter of Mississippi and
opening the files will allow Mississippi to focus on the future,''
Mabus said.
   The records are held in six file cabinets by the state
Department of Archives and History in a vault in Jackson.
   The commission was created in 1956 and shut down in 1973. The
1977 Legislature ordered the records sealed until 2027. The ACLU
and civil rights activists sued the state the same year to open the
records.
   Barbour noted in his ruling that some records were destroyed or
removed years ago.
   ``A memo in the record establishes that in 1965, the commission
director ordered the destruction of all files which might show
interference by commission agents with voter registration. There
are other gaps which indicate that files have been lost, pilfered
or destroyed,'' Barbour wrote.
   Former Forest Mayor Erle Johnston was commission director from
1963 until 1968.
   ``Regardless of whatever information that was available to Judge
Barbour, we did not destroy files in 1965 or any other year,''
Johnston said.
   Johnston said neither he nor his secretary, who was in charge of
the files, disturbed the files, except for one which concerned
David Bowen, later a five-term congressman.
   ``The short file was actually a subtle criticism of Bowen's
fraternizing with ultra-liberal professors while he was at Millsaps
College,'' he said.
   Most plaintiffs in the lawsuit sought to make the documents
public but two of them, the Rev. Edwin King of Jackson and John
Salter Jr. of Grand Fork, N.D., requested the records remain closed
while an appeal is pursued, American Civil Liberties Union lawyer
Shirley Payne said.
   ``I just feel everybody's privacy was violated by the state in
illegally spying on people and it shouldn't be violated again by
making these records public,'' King said Thursday.
   ``My position is ... that the rights of citizens not to be spied
on or to be manipulated by a secret police is very important. I
don't think people who've been spied upon should have that material
released. The state should never have secured it,'' King said.
   Salter said private or personal information obtained by the
commission illegally should remain closed, but other, general
documents should be open.
   ``We always felt the personal material should be released only
to the victims. The victims would be free to use the material any
way they wish, including bringing damage suits against the state,''
Salter said.

   Central Russia is suffering from an extended
drought in this year when the Soviet Union desperately needs to
improve its food supply, Tass said Friday.
   President Mikhail S. Gorbachev discussed the situation Thursday
with leaders from several areas stretched across nearly 1,000 miles
which haven't seen sufficient rain for up to three years.
   The areas include Chelyabinsk, Omsk, Kurgan, Novosibirsk,
Sverdlovsk, Perm and the Bashkiria region, Tass said.
   Meat and cheese already is rationed in much of the country.
Hundreds of thousands of Soviet workers went on strike in the past
several weeks, in part over chronic shortages of food and consumer
goods.
   Gorbachev said the bad weather is hurting agricultural areas
that provide food to key cities inhabited by millions of people. He
stressed the need to make full use of all local reserves to
increase fodder for livestock, and to show concern for farm workers.

<TEXT>
   President Bush said Friday he did not condone
the kidnapping of a Shiite Moslem leader by Israeli commandoes in
Lebanon and doesn't know if the act will lead to freedom for an
American hostage.
   Bush, responding to questions at a news conference, also said he
had not been in touch with the Israelis after their capture of
Sheik Abdul Karim Obeid in the Lebanon village of Jibchit, 21 north
of the Israeli border, earlier in the day.
   Bush was asked whether Obeid's capture enhanced the cause of
peace in the Middle East.
   ``I don't think kidnapping and violence helps the cause of
peace,'' he responded.
   Sources in Lebanon said Obeid is considered Iran's closest ally
and was linked to the abduction of Marine Lt. Col. William R.
Higgins, head of the 75-man observer group attached to the U.N.
Interim Force in Lebanon, on Feb. 17, 1988.
   Higgins is one of nine Americans held in Lebanon, presumably by
pro-Iranian Shiite Moslems.
   Bush said he didn't know what ramifications the capture of Obeid
would have.
   ``I can't tell you ... whether I think ... these two things can
interact _ the kidnapping and perhaps the subsequent release of
this man _ whether that'll benefit the Higgins case or not,'' the
president said.
   He did say, however, that ``the freeing of Colonel Higgins is
very much on my mind and the freeing of the other hostages is.''
   Bush said he had not contacted the Israelis, although other
Americans had. ``This thing ... just happened.''
   Obeid is reputed to be the spiritual guide of Hezbollah, or
Party of God, in south Lebanon.
   He has repeatedly denied, however, any ties with the pro-Iranian
group, which is affiliated with factions holding most of the 17
foreign hostages in Lebanon. Nine Americans are among the hostages.

   I am convinced that much _ not all but much _ of the criticism
of him is pure gut American politics.

   Yeah?
   Q. Mr. President, back on the Israeli kidnapping, does this help
the cause of peace in the Middle East, particularly at a time when
there seems to be a lot of behind-the-scenes activity with the PLO
and the Israelis passing messages in various ways?

<TEXT>
   Austrian officials said Friday the United
States alerted them about a man who visited Vienna often and may
have been a Soviet contact for Felix Bloch, the American diplomat
suspected of spying for Moscow.
   Robert Danzinger, the national police chief, said U.S. officials
told Austria on June 23 about the man, who traveled on fake Finnish
papers.
   ``We assume he worked for the KGB,'' Danzinger said. ``We have
no information of our own that he is KGB. That information came
solely from Washington.''
   Danziger said the man, whom he did not identify, first visited
Vienna in 1979 and often spent weeks or months at a time in the
Austrian capital, using papers issued by the Finnish Embassy that
were based on a false identity. Bloch began his seven-year tour at
the U.S. Embassy in 1980.
   The man who ``allegedly had contacts with Bloch'' left Austria
June 11, supposedly for Helsinki, Danzinger said.
   Whether Bloch might have met the man in the normal course of
diplomatic duties was not known. Bloch, who served four years as
deputy chief of mission, had many contacts and regularly attended
diplomatic and other parties.
   Danzinger said the visitor always registered with police in
accordance with Austrian regulations and had not been the object of
suspicion until the notice from Washington. Austrian authorities
now believe he is the man U.S. authorities suspect of KGB activity,
the police chief said.
   In Paris, Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze said
Friday his country never had any connection with Bloch and ``I'm
surprised by the fuss over this affair. It's not serious.''
   At a news conference in Vienna, Danzinger and Interior Minister
Franz Loeschnak said Austrian security authorities were told of a
possible spy investigation June 23, when the tip arrived about the
man with Finnish papers.
   Chancellor Franz Vranitzky said earlier this week he learned of
the Bloch investigation July 7 from U.S. Ambassador Henry A.
Grunwald.
   Loeschnak confirmed Friday that Bloch had a ``friendship'' with
an Austrian woman over several years. Danzinger said she was
questioned this week after returning from a vacation in Egypt and
there was no evidence she had suspicions about Bloch.
   The interior minister said the suspect visitor to Vienna also
had a relationship with an Austrian woman, and the women apparently
were not acquainted. Danzinger said authorities had to assume
``neither had any idea of a possible link between Bloch'' and the
man with Finnish papers.
   Bloch, 54, was economics chief in the Vienna embassy in 1980-83,
then deputy chief of mission until he returned to Washington in
July 1987. He is the highest-ranking U.S. diplomat ever
investigated for espionage.
   He was put on paid leave June 22 and is under constant
surveillance by the FBI, but his travel has not been restricted.
   Reports have said he refused to discuss any possible spying
activities with the FBI, but The New York Times reported Friday he
admitted in a brief interview with the FBI on June 22 to being paid
``a lot of money'' by the KGB over ``many years.''
   A congressional source in Washington told The Associated Press
the FBI believes the KGB recruited Bloch when he was stationed in
East Berlin 14 years ago.
   Loeschnak said preliminary Austrian investigations of Bloch had
been completed and prosecutors received the report Friday. He said
they would decide whether further action should be taken.
   Suspicions about the diplomat are ``the affair of the United
States,'' he said, but ``we have to see whether Austrian interests
were affected.''
   ``Some things have been established which indicate the activity
of a KGB man,'' Loeschnak said, but he would not say whether there
was a direct link to Bloch.

   Bush: I don't think kidnapping and violence helps the cause of
peace.
   Dick?
   Q. Mr. President, recently your secretary of commerce announced
that we would sell computers to the Soviet Union _ we hadn't sold
them before _ which drew a protest from Secretary Cheney. In light
of the Felix Bloch case and the new allegations of possible spying,
do you think it's time to begin relaxing our controls on technology?
   Bush: I don't want to send technology to the Soviet Union that
will enhance their military capabilities.
   And we did have a difference inside the administration on this
question.
   I am confident that, after having looked at it subsequent to
Secretary Mosbacher's decision, that this will not enhance the
technological _ won't _ put it this way _ that this will not
endanger the legitimate national security needs of this country.
   So we're _ we have had a difference on it.
   I've talked to both Cheney and Mosbacher.
   I don't see any connection, however, to the allegations against
Mr. Bloch.
   Yeah, Bernie?
   Q. Sir, how concerned are you that the Bloch case will actually
endanger national security? And can you give us any indication how
long this has been going on?
   Bush: I can't give you the facts on it.
   I don't want to go into it while it is being under investigation.
   I am very disturbed about the premature discussion and
disclosure _ that means ``leaks'' _ on this matter, because I think
you can jeopardize the case itself, and perhaps the man's ability
to get a fair hearing.
   So I am troubled by it, but I can't really help you on the facts
on the matter.
   Yes, Frank?
   Q. I'd like to continue with this kinder, gentler theme for a
moment. You've tried this with Congress for the entire six months
you've been in office, yet your crime bill has failed, your defense
bill appears to have been savaged, your nominee for civil rights
post, whom you say is qualified, is being given a rough ride, to
say the least, and the S&amp;L bill, you have great concerns about. How
would you rate your own legislative success in your first six
months?
   Bush: I'd be rating the Congress, wouldn't I, if I rated the
legislative success, and I wouldn't give it very high marks.
   I sent a savings and loan bill up there, and it's been there for
_ (aside) _ how many days?
   Staff: Since February 23rd.
   Bush: Since February 23rd.
   And I challenged the Congress to get something done in 60 days,
and it wasn't done.
   So in not going after people in a very personal way, attacking
some congressman or senator with whom I differ, that does not mean
I am happy or relaxed about the legislative calendar and the
performance on legislation.
   I am concerned about it.
   Every day the savings and loan sits out there unsolved _ it's
costing the American taxpayer 30 _ some estimates go from $10
(million) to $30 million a day.
   And if the fault _ I'll take the fault, the responsibility, when
we're slow getting legislation up; we've been criticized, and I
think properly so, from on a couple of subjects _ not getting the
legislation there on time.
   But on this one, I think the Congress has been taking too long
to resolve the matter.
   And there are others.
   The defense budget's not a question of timing so much as it is
the mix on our strategic system.
   So I would not give Congress very high marks on doing what I
want done on legislation.
   In giving it _ putting their spin on it, why that's something
else.

<HEAD>U.S. Troop Withdrawal Would be Costly to West Germany, Study Determines</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CAROL J. WILLIAMS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BONN, West Germany (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Public support for the presence of
U.S. troops is withering, but West Germany would lose more than $5
billion a year if those forces were withdrawn, according to the
German Economics Institute.
   West Germany earns more than $5 billion each year from U.S.
military expenditures in West Germany, after the costs of hosting
the troops are deducted, according to an institute report.
   The institute warns of ``economic collapse'' in some regions if
the troops are withdrawn.
   An extensive analysis of the U.S. military presence was
undertaken because of the growing public tendency to see American
troops as a burden, said Otto Vogel, director for economic and
scientific affairs at the industry-supported institute.
   ``We wanted to make an independent analysis of the costs and
benefits that would be useful to both those in the economic sector
and those in politics,'' Vogel said Friday.
   As West Germans perceive a diminishing military threat from the
Soviet Union, public support for the more than 250,000 U.S.
soldiers stationed in West Germany has lessened.
   The $5 billion figure represents only about 1 percent of the
gross national product. But the study, based on official U.S. and
West German figures for defense and social spending, said that a
U.S. withdrawal could trigger ``economic collapse'' in
Rhineland-Palatinate and Hesse states, as well as parts of Bavaria.
Those regions have heavy concentrations of American troops.
   Citing U.S. military expenditures in 1986, the institute said
West German companies were awarded contracts worth $3.45 billion,
and that another $1.3 billion was paid to the 171,000 West German
employees of U.S. defense installations that year.
   U.S. soldiers also spend an average of 28 percent of their
salaries on rent, goods and services in West Germany, which
accounted for another $1.5 billion in 1986, the study said.
   The analysis did not consider the presence of thousands of
American civilians in West Germany in some NATO-related role.
   On the cost side, the report said that in 1986, the West German
government spent the equivalent of $991 million to host the U.S.
soldiers, including $646 million in lost rent for land used
cost-free by the U.S. forces.
   It also mentioned losses totaling $8.6 million for damage to
private property caused by U.S. maneuvers.
   The researchers said certain social costs of hosting the troops
could not be quantified, such as increased prostitution and drug
use in areas with a heavy military presence.
   Researchers Christian Thimann and Hartmut Bebermeyer also noted
that their report did not include public assistance costs for
German wives divorced from U.S. soldiers or children left behind.
   But they concluded that the U.S. military presence ``in 1986
provided a material advantage of 12.5 billion marks.'' That would
be $5.39 billion at the exchange rate then in effect.
   Vogel said his institute conducted the study to ``determine the
financial facts'' amid changing political and social attitudes
toward U.S. troops.
   Asked whether the report would influence public opinion, he
replied: ``That's difficult to say. But certainly having available
an independent analysis of the economic considerations will have
some effect on the population's attitudes.''
   Public resentment of the U.S. military presence, especially
low-level flying exercises and war games, has intensified over the
past year.
   The shift in opinion was most notable after the Aug. 28, 1988,
disaster at the U.S. air base at Ramstein, where three Italian jets
collided during an aerobatic demonstration and fell in flames into
the crowd below. The accident claimed 70 lives.
   There have also been suggestions in Congress that efforts to cut
costs with U.S. base closures be extended to Europe.
   President Bush announced at the May 29-30 NATO summit in
Brussels, Belgium, that the United States would offer to withdraw
about 30,000 soldiers from Europe as part of Vienna-based
negotiations with the Warsaw Pact on conventional force reductions.
   But some observers believe pressure will mount for deeper cuts,
or a full-fledged U.S. pullout, as relations between East and West
improve.
   Thomas Enders, a U.S. affairs expert with the German Society for
Foreign Policy, said he could ``imagine a situation, after a
successful conclusion of the Vienna talks, when a significantly
lower level of American troops would be appropriate.''
   Edward Harper, a retired U.S. diplomat with long service in West
Germany, wrote in Thursday's International Herald Tribune that for
U.S. troops in Europe, ``the time has come to go.''
   ``The advantages of such a course are immense, including an
immediate reduction in the federal budget deficit and a
corresponding improvement to the balance of payments,'' Harper
wrote.

   Burma's military government said it
freed thousands of criminals this week, but diplomats said
authorities also have arrested hundreds of political activists.
   The government also has sentenced to death three opposition
party members for a bombing at an oil refinery.
   Radio Rangoon reported Wednesday that 1,187 criminals were freed
nationwide that day, bringing to 5,131 the number released under an
amnesty announced July 20.
   The amnesty commuted death sentences to life imprisonment,
reduced life terms to 10 years and cut other terms cut by
two-thirds.
   But the amnesty applied only to cases before Sept. 18, 1988, and
not to cases of high treason or breaches of martial law imposed
since that date.
   On Sept. 18, the army under Gen. Saw Maung moved to crush a
nationwide mass movement for democracy, killing hundreds of people,
mostly unarmed protesters. He declared martial law that severely
curtailed public gatherings and freedom of speech.
   On July 18, the eve of a planned mass opposition rally, the
government tightened martial law and threatened offenders with
death sentences.
   Two days later, Aung San Suu Kyi and Tin Oo, the leaders of the
National League for Democracy, were placed under house arrest. The
government charged they had attempted ``to destroy the military and
create anarchy in the country.''
   On Thursday, a military tribunal sentenced to death three
members of their party who allegedly confessed they were
responsible for a package bomb that exploded and killed two people
at the country's main oil refinery on July 7.
   No details of the trial of Than Zaw, 27, Moe Kyaw Thus, 17, and
Nyi Nyi Oo, 25, were made public.
   Dissidents and Western diplomats in Rangoon said authorities
have arrested up to hundreds of dissidents since putting the two
opposition leaders under house arrest.
   ``They are going to people's houses at night, they are pulling
them off the streets, even off of buses or out of offices and
hotels,'' one diplomat said in a telephone interview from Bangkok.
   British officials say the Burmese government also has restricted
the movements of Ms. Suu Kyi's British husband, Michael Aris. He
had returned to Rangoon from Britain on Saturday last week.
   At a government news conference Friday, Foreign Minister Ohn
Kyaw denied rumors that Ms. Suu Kyi had begun a hunger strike to
protest her detention.
   He said both opposition leaders ``are in good health in their
respective houses.''
   Before her arrest, Ms. Suu Kyi said the suspects in the oil
refinery bombing were members of her party, but she had seen no
evidence that implicated them.
   Diplomats in Rangoon said Thursday they were baffled by the mass
release of criminals but speculated that the jails were being
cleared to make way for political prisoners.
   The government also released thousands of criminals during last
year's protests in a move diplomats said was designed to convince
the people that they needed a tough army presence.
   Saw Maung has sought to justify his rule by saying the country
was facing anarchy.

<TEXT>
   Typhoon Judy lashed the flood-stricken
southern coast with more rain and 78 mph winds Friday, uprooting
trees and stranding thousands of ships, weather officials said.
   Judy is the third typhoon in two weeks in Asia, where storms and
flooding have killed at least 2,500 people and left hundreds of
thousands of people homeless since mid-June.
   The typhoon swept across Japan earlier Friday, killing three and
leaving hundreds of thousands without electricity before heading
for the Korean peninsula.
   It was moving northwest at 15 mph and dumped six inches of rain
on southern regions as it hit the peninsula Friday night, the
officials said.
   Its high winds uprooted trees along streets, blew away
commercial signboards and shattered hundreds of windows in Yosu and
other ports on the southern coast.
   People in low-lying areas were evacuated. Thousands of ships
were brought into ports as the National Disaster Center issued a
new flood warning for southern areas.
   Weather officials said the typhoon was expected to lose much of
its power and weaken to a tropical storm as it continued a
northwesterly course along the peninsula's west coast.
   The typhoon hit South Korea after five days of flooding that
killed at least 70 people, officials said. The National Disaster
Center said 45 others were missing and 54,500 were homeless.
Property damange was estimated at $200 million.
   Judy reached Kyushu Island late Thursday, destroying homes and
causing 25 landslides, police spokesman Osamu Takano said.
   Police said landslides killed a 1-year-old boy and a 63-year-old
farmer on Kyushu, about 560 miles southwest of Tokyo. A 90-year-old
woman also drowned in Kagoshima, police said.
   Almost 390,000 homes on Kyushu were without electricity early
Friday, but the number had decreased to 270,000 by midday,
according to Kyushu Electric Power Co. Police estimated property
damage at $3.8 million.
   Rain-triggered landslides and floods also disrupted train
service and forced closing of a highway in central Taiwan. Floods
Thursday left eight people dead and one missing, police said.
   Vietnam's official news agency reported that heavy rains this
week killed 49 people in the northern province of Thanh Hoa.
   At least 14 people in China's central Sichuan province have
drowned this week, the official China Daily reported Friday. About
1,800 people have died in flooding in 15 provinces across China
since mid-June.
   India's worst monsoons in 25 years have battered rural
communities since Sunday, killing at least 500 people and causing
millions of dollars in damages, Indian officials say. The storms
left 31 people dead and 20,000 homeless in neighboring Pakistan,
authorities in Karachi said.
   Last week, typhoons Gordon and Hope swept across east Asia.
Gordon began in the Philippines where it killed 26 people and left
17 dead in China's Guangdong and Guangxi provinces and one dead in
Hong Kong. Hope killed at least 36 people in China's Fujian
province.

<HEAD>Exxon Says Cleanup to Resume if Necessary; Bush Says It Better</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By H. JOSEF HEBERT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Exxon Corp. told Congress on Friday it is
committed to any ``reasonable'' continuation of the Alaska oil
spill cleanup next spring. President Bush said he would do his best
to make sure Exxon doesn't ``pull back on an agreement.''
   Exxon officials testified the company intends to suspend cleanup
activities in September because of oncoming winter weather and
would return to see if more work is necessary in the spring.
   But a top U.S. Coast Guard official said he expects
``disagreements on what should be done'' next year, with no clear
consensus on how free of oil the stretches of rocky Alaska shore
must be before being declared clean.
   Exxon's plans in the cleanup of more than 700 miles of
shoreline, damaged by the Exxon Valdez tanker spill last March,
came under scrutiny this week with the disclosure of an internal
company memorandum which said ``no commitment should be made'' on
the timing of suspending or resuming cleanup operations.
   Asked by reporters about the matter at a White House news
conference Friday _ hours after Exxon officials testified on
Capitol Hill _ Bush made clear he considers Exxon to have made a
commitment to stay with the cleanup.
   ``If I had the feeling Exxon was going to pull back on an
agreement or fail to fulfill an agreement they'd made with us, with
the government, or with the state of Alaska, I would be very much
exercised and try my best to do something about it,'' said the
president.
   Alaska officials publicly interpreted the July 19 Exxon memo as
an indication the company was preparing to pull out of a cleanup
effort that was far from completed. The brouhaha prompted Friday's
hearing by the Interior Subcommittee on Water, Power and Offshore
Energy Resources, during which Exxon was asked to detail its
intentions.
   The memo, written by the manager of Exxon's cleanup operation in
Alaska, ``suggests Exxon is putting together its plan for
demobilization without Coast Guard approval,'' said Rep. George
Miller, D-Calif., chairman of the subcommittee.
   W.D. Stevens, president of Exxon Co. USA, said the wording of
the memo was ``unfortunate.''
   He said the company will withdraw its equipment and estimated
10,000 workers from the contaminated region beginning Sept. 15
because of potential safety problems with rough seas and weather.
But he said Exxon would ``return to the areas in the spring of 1990
to reinspect the area, to assure that the job has been properly
done, and if not, to put it right.''
   Pressed by Miller on whether Exxon plans to resume cleanup
operations in the spring, Stevens said he could not give ``an
unequivocal commitment'' and added, ``I think it would be naive to
do that.''
   ``We will follow through on any reasonable request that is made
(by the U.S. Coast Guard),'' said Stevens, adding that there likely
will be ``scientific disagreement'' over what areas are clean and
whether further work is needed.
   Coast Guard Vice Admiral Clyde Lusk told the subcommittee that a
working group of federal and state officials as well as various
scientists and representatives from Exxon will participate in the
inspection next spring.
   But Lusk acknowledged that while the Coast Guard can ask Exxon
to perform additional cleanup at a specific site, it has no
authority to require the company to do so.
   ``I have absolutely no doubt there are going to be disagreements
over what should be done'' in terms of continuing the cleanup
efforts, he said.
   ``What is clean?'' Lusk asked rhetorically at another point. ``I
don't know how we're going to make that decision.''
   The potential for sharp disagreement over when a stretch of
shoreline should be considered cleaned became evident at Friday's
hearing.
   Exxon executives contended that about 600 miles of contaminated
shoreline already had been treated, while Alaska's chief
environmental official put the number at about 190 miles and said
in many cases oil has seeped back into the rocks and pebbles.
   ``We cannot imagine how Exxon can conclude 600 miles have been
treated,'' Dennis Kelso, the commissioner of Alaska's Department of
Environmental Conservation, told the House panel. ``If that
statement were made in Kodiak or Homer the roof would rise. Maybe
they're looking at a different gulf.''

<HEAD>Musicians' Strike Forces Dean Martin to Cancel Vegas Act</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LAS VEGAS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Striking musicians picketing Bally's Hotel and
Casino for using taped music in lieu of live musicians have forced
Dean Martin to cancel his act there indefinitely.
   Martin had been scheduled to open a weeklong engagement at
Bally's on Thursday night. It was the first time a Strip headliner
has been affected in the two-month dispute between hotels and
musicians. Picketing continued Friday.
   The musicians set up picket lines after Bally's switched from
live music to taped numbers for their production show, Jubilee,
Thursday night.
   Several Las Vegas hotels that feature lavish production shows
have announced they are dropping live music for some production
numbers. Name stars still use live musicians.
   Bally's announced earlier this summer that it was cutting out
live music for the Jubilee show, but would continue using musicians
for headliners such as Martin appearing in the hotel's Celebrity
showroom.
   However, Celebrity room musicians joined the picket lines to
support colleagues who lost their jobs in the Jubilee changeover.
   Martin said he was upset by the strike.
   ``For over 35 years I've played Las Vegas, always utilizing Las
Vegas musicians,'' Martin said in a statement Thursday. ``At no
time has Bally's ever asked me to perform without live musicians.
I'm saddened by the musicians' union strike which occurred today at
Bally's and by the effect it has had on many people. Any time
people are out of work, it is personally upsetting.''
   Cancellation of the show left 86 people out of work _ 23
musicians who would have played for Martin and 63 other union
members who work in the Celebrity room as stagehands and food
service employees.
   The musicians previously struck the Tropicana Hotel when that
resort switched from live music to tape for its Folies Bergere
show. And the union set up informational pickets at the Flamingo
Hilton earlier this week when that resort switched from live music
to tape for its City Lites show.
   The switch from live to taped music directly affected 45 union
musicians _ 19 at Bally's and 13 each at the Tropicana and Flamingo
Hilton.

<HEAD>Outlook Improves For Younger Politician To Become New Prime Minister</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TETSUO JIMBO</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A former deputy prime minister said Friday he did
not want the job of prime minister, improving the chances of the
governing party's No. 2 leader, an unusually young politician
untainted by Japan's recent scandals.
   The governing Liberal Democratic party, whose president becomes
prime minister due to a comfortable majority in lower house,
decided Friday to choose a new leader Aug. 8 and seek his approval
in Parliament Aug. 10, party officials said.
   Ryutaro Hashimoto, who at 51 is the youngest secretary general
of the Liberal Democratic Party and is in charge of finding a
replacement for Prime Minister Sousuke Uno, has said little about
his possible candidacy.
   On Friday, however, former Deputy Prime Minister Shin Kanemaru,
75, who had been viewed as opposing Hashimoto, said he had no
intention to be prime minister.
   Hashimoto's chances were bolstered further when former Finance
Minister Kiichi Miyazawa, who controls the third-largest faction in
the party, also said he prefered to have an ``young and
progressive'' person to head the party and the government.
   The conservative Liberal Democrats have worked quickly to
minimize the political vacuum created by Uno's decision to step
down to take responsibility for Sunday's election defeat, in which
the conservative party lost control of the 252-member upper house
of Parliament for the first time in 34 years.
   Hashimoto declined to comment about his candidacy, because ``I
am in a position to help the party to select the next president.''
   For decades, Japan's prime ministers have been men in their
mid-60s or older who reached the office after a steady
apprenticeship through a succession of increasingly important
Cabinet and party posts. Hashimoto, in Parliament since he was 26,
has not held top Cabinet posts such as the finance portfolio, and
he became party secretary general only in June.
   Untainted by scandal, Hashimoto was the most active campaigner
for July 23 election, making 90 appearances during the 14-day
campaign while Uno stayed in the background.
   Uno was virtually hand-picked by former Prime Minister Noboru
Takeshita behind closed doors after Takeshita resigned to take
responsibility for a widespread influence-peddling scandal that
touched much of the party's top leadership.
   ``The real key is to make the process (of selecting the next
prime minster) as transparent as possible,'' Hashimoto said in an
interview.
   Whoever becomes party leader and prime minister will have to be
in effect reconfirmed in October when the term as party leader
expires.
   The party is ``working to find a candidate strong and popular
enough to be re-elected unanimously'' in the fall, Hashimoto said.
   ``This time around, we are aware we have to have a new leader
whose leadership can been forseen in longer terms,'' he said. Uno
had been seen as a caretaker leader, lacking a power base within
the party.
   Meanwhile, officials of the Japan Socialist Party, which seeks
to form a coalition with three small centrist parties against the
governing party, said it would ask them to support Socialist
Chairwoman Takako Doi in the prime ministerial election in
Parliament.
   An opposition party official, speaking anonymously, said the
negotiations for a common candidate ``have to overcome many
hurdles'' before reaching an agreement.
   Analysts said opposition parties are unlikely to come up with
one common candidate because of policy gaps among themselves, but
they have a good chance to force the governing party into agreeing
to early elections for the more powerful lower house before its
four-year term ends in July 1990.

<TEXT>
   Garlic, normally considered a good way to
keep others from getting too close, has drawing power in these
parts where the 11th annual festival got under way Friday with
150,000 visitors expected for the weekend.
   Highlights include 80 food booths dishing up everything from
garlic-laced vegetarian chili to garlic-flavored ice cream.
   The celebration of the ``stinking rose'' was expected to
generate whooper traffic jams as folks traveled long distances to
sample the delicacies and shop the wares of dozens of artisans.
   For the third year, organizers hoped to reduce the vehicular
nightmare by operating the ``Garlic Express,'' a shuttle train
originating in San Francisco, about 60 miles north.
   But for those who prefer to soar over the crowd of stalled
drivers and fly into the San Martin Municipal Airport, local pilot
Jean Blake, 67, planned to help flyers get to the party.
   ``I'm going to do what I can,'' said Blake.
   Gilroy claimed the title of Garlic Capital of the World when it
threw the first festival in 1979, but an irony of the celebration
is that Gilroy now produces only a small portion of the state's
garlic crop, according to Mike Henry, a spokesman for the
California Farm Bureau.

   Oklahomans have been in a partying mood all
year, the centennial of the state's land run, but folks here have
gone to the extreme of calling a square dance at the post office
just to celebrate their zip code.
   Tuttle's zip is 73089 and Sunday is 7-30-89, so why not dance?
   Postmaster Steve Buchanan and others in the community have lined
up a number of activities for Saturday, since, what-the-heck,
Sunday's meant to be a day of rest.
   An open house and square dancing are planned at the post office
before the official dedication of the building built last year.
Sack races, a petting zoo, buggy rides, a tennis tournament and a
kid's fun run also are planned.
   Buchanan checked up and said Tuttle isn't the only community
that can plan on a Zip code date party as future July 30s roll
around: Union City in 1990, Velma in 1991, Verden in 1992,
Washington in 1993, Wayne in 1995, Weatherford in 1996, Wheatland
in 1997, Wynnewood in 1998 and Yukon in 1999.

   Q. Do you think this is just harbinger of things to come _ a
Republican president working with a Democratic Congress _ converts
notwithstanding?
   Bush: Nobody ever said it would be easy.
   Yeah.
   Q. Mr. President _
   Bush: In this department.
   Q. _ on a related matter, there are some fairly intense
negotiations on your capital gains tax cut proposal going on right
now. Are you willing to accept some kind of an indexing of capital
gains rather than the cut you've asked for as an alternate that
might be more acceptable to Democrats?
   Bush: Look, what I want to do is see capital income at different
rates.
   I want what's known as the ``differential.''
   And so let's see what can be worked out.
   If there's some compromise that can spur investment, spur jobs,
increase employment, the cause of new jobs starting up, I'd be
interested in it.
   And so I want to see what could be worked out.
   I don't think I should ever say it's got to be done just this
way in terms of the bills up there in the House Ways and Means
Committee right now.
   But I have a good, sound proposal, and it was tested _ it was
one of the things, I think, that was clearly in focus in the
campaign.
   And the other side, particularly the liberal Democrats,
particularly, attacked me as having some kind of a tax favoring the
rich.
   It's nothing like that at all.
   It will stimulate jobs.
   It will encourage business _ small business creation.
   And I stand for it.
   And if there's some way that that can be achieved by changing
the proposal I sent up there, fine, I'm willing to listen.
   Q. Is there a compromise in the works?
   Bush: Well, there's been some discussions _ and I can't tell you
how far along it is _ but there has been some discussion.
   I want to see something happen.
   I don't want to fall on my sword.
   I want to see this country have more job creation, and that
would be a part of this.
   And I want to see us get on with the job of balancing this
budget eventually.

<HEAD>Hitachi Drops Suit Against Motorola</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Hitachi Ltd. has dropped a patent infringement suit
filed against the U.S. electronics firm Motorola Inc., a Hitachi
spokesman said Friday.
   Hitachi spokesman Yoichi Suga said the company withdrew the suit
because of new information that suggested ``what we thought had
been under the scope of the patent was not.''
   Motorola said: ``Hitachi's action removes all doubt that Hitachi
now admits the invalidity of the Hitachi patents.''
   The lawsuit filed in U.S. district court in Austin, Texas, in
May alleged that Motorola's 68HC11 microcontroller infringed on a
Hitachi patent.
   Hitachi initiated the suit a week after Motorola filed a
litigation alleging Hitachi microprocessors violated at least four
Motorola patents.
   Their disputes center on patents for digital electronic devices
that perform control and arithmetic functions in televisions,
watches, videotape recorders and other products. They often contain
hundreds of thousands of microscopic transistors on silicon chips
smaller than a fingernail.
   Motorola says it granted patent licenses concerning use of
microprocessing technology to Hitachi over a 10-year period.
   Problems started when Hitachi introduced its Zero Turn-Around
Time microprocessors in 1986, which Motorola claims use technology
not covered in their agreements.
   In its statement, the U.S. company indicated its intention to
continue its suit against Hitachi, which goes to trial Oct. 23.
Motorola is seeking an injunction against continued sales of
Hitachi H-8 and H-16 processors in the United States as well as
damages.
   ``We intend to use all available resources to protect our
design, intellectual property and technology investments,'' Steve
Marsh, marketing director of Motorola's Microcontroller Division,
said.

<TEXT>
   A defense consultant was sentenced to 27
months in prison Friday for his role in a scheme to bribe a Navy
engineer for confidential bid information about Pentagon contracts.
   Fred H. Lackner, 52, was also fined $25,000 by U.S. District
Judge Claude Hilton and ordered to serve a three-year term of
supervised probation following his release from prison.
   Lackner, of Woodland Hills, Calif., was sentenced on his March
31 guilty plea to conspiracy, bribery and wire fraud, admitting his
role in a scheme to bribe Navy engineer Stuart Berlin.
   Lackner could have received a 25-year prison term and been fined
up to $750,000.
   He testified at the April trial of two Teledyne Electronics Inc.
vice presidents that he had been a middleman between defense
consultant William Parkin and Berlin to obtain inside bid
information from the Navy.
   Lackner testified that he, Parkin, Berlin and another
co-conspirator were to share $150,000 that Teledyne paid Parkin for
help in getting an electronics contract. But Berlin was actually
told the four were sharing $100,000 because ``everyone felt he
really didn't do anything to aid the procurement.''
   Parkin and Berlin were each sentenced to 26 months in prison and
fined $25,000 for their roles in the bribery scheme.
   Parkin and Berlin also testified at the trial of George H. Kaub
and Eugene R. Sullivan, the two Teledyne executives who were
convicted of conspiracy and wire fraud. A third Teledyne executive
was acquitted.

<DATELINE>SEOUL, South Korea (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The leading opposition legislator said
Friday he will comply with a court order that he testify on a
secret visit to North Korea by one of his party's lawmakers, news
reports said.
   Kim Dae-jung, president of the Party for Peace and Democracy,
said the warrant was based on charges ``fabricated by the national
intelligence agency,'' but said he has no choice but to comply,
said reports.
   Also Friday, newspapers reported that Im Su-kyong, a radical
student illegally visiting North Korea, has started a hunger strike
at the border village of Panmunjom.
   Ms. Im arrived at the border Thursday with pacifists from a
reported 30 countries and is demanding that she re-enter the south
through the demilitarized border zone as a gesture of national
unification.
   The government says she will be arrested on her return and
charged with violating national security.
   In Seoul, the Agency for National Security Planning said
Thursday it will serve Kim with a warrant for questioning about an
illegal trip to North Korea by National Assemblyman Suh Kyung-won.
Suh is in jail on charges of espionage for visiting the north and
allegedly taking $120,000 from communist agents.
   Yonhap, South Korean's official news agency, said Kim told
reporters Friday in the provincial capital of Kwangju that the
court order is called a writ of detention.
   ``Detention means taking a person against his will,'' he said.
``I have no choice.''
   The order is bound to create more tensions between the
government and the leading opposition party and to bewilder further
South Koreans already shocked by the illegal trips of Suh, Ms. Im,
and a dissident clergyman.
   Unauthorized travel to the communist north is a crime, and many
South Koreans who fought the northern invasion 1950-53 remain
highly sensitive to suggestions a political leader may have
communist sympathies.
   Kim has charged the government with harassment and his party
Thursday filed a libel suit charging intelligence agency chief Suh
Dong-kwon and two investigators purposely spread unfounded rumors.
Kim has turned down three summons for questioning from the
intelligence agency, arguing he knew nothing about Suh's trip.
   Suh was expelled from the party after his June 28 arrest.
   About 200 lawmakers and party officers staged a sit-in Wednesday
at their headquarters after Korean newspapers claimed an
unidentified intelligence agent said Kim was suspected of writing a
letter to North Korean leader Kim Il Sung.
   ``The Roh Tae-woo regime has tried everything it can to destroy
and wipe out the party by taking advantage of the Suh Kyung-won
case,'' the opposition leader said Friday.
   ``We have fought to establish a foundation for democratization
in this country. We will not surrender to the politics of a
security agency.''

   There will be no change in the 5 percent
acreage reduction program for wheat in 1990, Agriculture Secretary
Clayton Yeutter announced Friday.
   Yeutter had set the 5 percent reduction _ the amount of land
farmers have to idle to qualify for federal supports _ on May 31,
just before the June 1 deadline. The law allows the percentage to
be adjusted if there is a significant change in the wheat supply.
   ``While severe drought has reduced wheat production, the
expected supply-demand balance has changed little since the end of
May and does not require a change in the previously announced wheat
acreage recution program for 1990,'' he said in a statement.

<TEXT>
   The Food and Drug Administration will consider
major changes in the way foods are labeled, Health and Human
Services Secretary Louis Sullivan announced Friday.
   The FDA review will cover nutrition labeling, ingredient
labeling, the format of labels as well as manufacturers'
descriptions of foods and the health messages they put on their
products, Sullivan said.
   ``Interest in food labeling has never been higher,'' Sullivan
said in a statement announcing the FDA review.
   On Thursday, the Nutrition Labeling and Education Act was
introduced in Congress, amid criticism from lawmakers that the FDA
was moving too slowly on the issue. Hearings on the bill are
expected to begin next week.
   The measure would make nutrition labeling mandatory, require
disclosure of certain information such as the amount of fiber, fat
and cholesterol and provide uniform standards for food descriptions
such as ``lite'' and ``cholesterol-free.''
   The FDA said it will hold three or four public hearings across
the country beginning in the fall ``to find out what consumers want
and need on food labels.'' The FDA is expected to propose new
federal rules on food labeling early next year.
   The FDA currently requires certain food labeling, including such
information as ingredients and net weight on packaged foods. About
55 percent of packaged foods now include information on labels
about the nutrition of the foods.

<TEXT>
   Israeli commandos on Friday kidnapped a
Shiite Moslem clergyman reputed to be a leader of the pro-Iranian
Hezbollah and allegedly linked to the kidnapping of a U.S. Marine
held hostage in Lebanon.
   Security sources, speaking on condition of anonymity, suggested
Sheik Abdul Karim Obeid may have been kidnapped in a swap for the
American, Lt. Col. William R. Higgins, or for three Israeli
soldiers captured in south Lebanon more than three years ago.
   President Bush said he did not know if the incident would help
Higgins or the other eight American hostages but added, ``I don't
think kidnapping and violence helps the cause of peace'' in the
Middle East.
   The Israeli army confirmed the incident and accused Obeid, 33,
of instigating attacks on Israel and of being a major Hezbollah
figure.
   An Israel army spokesman, Col. Raanan Gissin, indicated a swap
was possible. ``Clearly when you capture one of their (Hezbollah's)
top leaders, it can deter terrorism and you also have a certain
amount of leverage in your hands,'' he said.
   Gissin said Obeid and two ``assistants'' seized with him were
``safely in Israeli hands and undergoing questioning.''
   Killed in the overnight raid was at least one resident of the
village of Jibchit, about 20 miles from the Israeli border and 35
miles south of Beirut.
   State Department spokeswoman Margaret Tutwiler said the United
States was not consulted about or involved in the abduction.
   Lebanese police said the commandos entered Jibchit about 1:30
a.m. after landing in a helicopter outside town.
   A police official, speaking on condition of anonymity in line
with standing regulations, said about 12 commandos with
silencer-equipped pistols surrounded Obeid's building, then knocked
on the door of his apartment and forced their way in.
   They fled with Obeid; his cousin, Ahmed Obeid; and a friend,
Majid Fahs, the spokesman said.
   Obdeid's wife, Mona, was locked in a room with her hands tied
and her mouth taped shut, the spokesman said.
   Mrs. Obeid, interviewed later, said one of the attackers spoke
Arabic. ``He told me he would kill me if I yelled,'' she said.
   The Israeli military refused to give details of the raid, but
Israel television reported the commandos blew offthe front door of
Obeid's apartment with plastic explosives and whisked the three men
away in a helicopter in less than a half-hour.
   Lebanese police said a neighbor, Hussein Abu Zeid, opened the
door of his apartment to find out what was happening and was shot
to death. Israel radio said the man killed was a bodyguard for
Obeid.
   Another neighbor, Fayez Shokor, who lives across the street from
Obeid, said three helicopters were involved in the operation.
   ``I heard a suspicious noise... and went out to the balcony. I
heard someone shouting (in Arabic) `Kill me! I won't go with
you!''' said Shokor, a member of the mainstream Amal militia, which
has been fighting Hezbollah for control of Lebanon's Shiite Moslems.
   Shokor said he and five other Amal militiamen rushed to a nearby
valley in search of Obeid but came under Israeli fire.
   ``Two Israeli helicopters hovered overhead and they started
shooting at us with machine guns,'' he said. ``As the clash was
under way, a third helicopter took off, apparently carrying the
Israelis, Sheik Obeid and his companions.''
   Iran's Foreign Ministry said in a statement: ``This shameless
act by the Zionist regime will not remain unanswered by the Moslem
and combatant forces.'' The statement, carried by the official
Islamic Republic News Agency, said the operation was a ``clear
example of state terrorism.''
   The Iranian-backed Hezbollah, or Party of God, urged Moslems to
``let out their anger until Obeid is released safely.''
   Obeid is reputed to be the spiritual guide of Hezbollah in south
Lebanon. He has denied involvement with the fundamentalist group,
believed to be an umbrella for the kidnappers of 17 foreign
hostages in Lebanon.
   Higgins, 44, of Danville, Ky., headed an observer group attached
to the U.N. peacekeeping force in South Lebanon. Security sources
said he was briefly held at Obeid's apartment after his abduction
near the southern port city of Tyre on Feb. 17, 1988.
   His captors, the Organization of the Oppressed on Earth,
believed to be one of Hezbollah's affiliates, later took Higgins to
another hideout.
   The State Department and Israel described Obeid as a Hezbollah
member.
   Britain, which has three citizens held hostage in Lebanon, said
the raid could hurt the hostages, but Gissin said it would help
them.
   ``We believe Hezbollah leaders will now think twice before
harming their hostages,'' he said.
   Two Israeli soldiers, Rahamim Alsheikh and Yossi Fink were
captured Feb. 17, 1986, when guerrillas ambushed their patrol in
Israel's self-proclaimed ``security zone'' in south Lebanon.
Israeli officials said they believe Hezbollah was behind the
kidnapping.
   An air force navigator, Ron Arad, was captured by Shiite
militiamen on October 16, 1986, when his plane was shot down in
south Lebanon.
   The American held longest in Lebanon is Terry Anderson, chief
Middle East correspondent of The Associated Press, who was
kidnapped March 16, 1985. A Shiite Moslem group, the pro-Iranian
Islamic Jihad, or Islamic Holy War, claims to hold him.

<HEAD>Soviet Ship Turns Fleeing Cubans Over to US</HEAD>

<DATELINE>MIAMI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Soviet ship on Friday turned over to amazed Coast
Guard officials three sunburned Cubans fleeing their communist
homeland on a flimsy raft.
   ``This is a first for us,'' said Coast Guard spokesman Luis
Diaz. ``It went very well. We had no trouble with the exchange.
This is not a common occurrence, and we were very happy to take the
men.''
   The three refugees were badly sunburned, dehydrated and had
difficulty talking and walking after their six-day, 125-mile voyage
that relied on Atlantic currents to push them to Florida.
   ``They are safely being attended by paramedics and glad to be
free,'' Diaz said as the men were brought ashore. All three were
taken to Jackson Memorial Hospital and still were being evaluated
at mid-afternoon.
   Coast Guard Petty Officer Veronica Cady could not explain why
the Soviets would surrender the Cubans instead of taking them home.
   The Soviet ship, identified in the reference book Jane's
Fighting Ships as an intelligence-gathering Zaporozhye, spotted the
three floating in a raft made of inner tubes and picked them up
Friday morning, 26 miles southeast of Cape Florida, the Coast Guard
said.
   ``The negotiations were very short and brief,'' Diaz said. ``We
were notified by the Soviet warship that they had picked up the
three men ... and they wanted to transfer them over to us.''
   When the 274-foot Soviet ship rendezvoused with a 41-foot Coast
Guard patrol boat for the transfer, the Soviet captain refused to
allow a Coast Guard party to board. The Cubans were transferred by
raft to the patrol boat for their trip to Miami.
   So far this year, the Coast Guard has picked up 97 Cubans on
rafts, including 31 this month alone.
   The refugees identified themselves as Arsenio Gomez Hernandez,
46, his son Pedro Gomez Cruz and a man who said he was 47 and gave
the name Gomez.
   Cuban refugees who make the raft trip to Florida are routinely
transferred to the custody of the Immigration and Naturalization
Service and released to relatives after questioning.
   The ship, the Soviet's first with on-board intelligence
capability, has been operating for several months off Cape
Canaveral on intelligence collection operations, said U.S. Navy Lt.
Cmdr. Steve Burnett, Atlantic fleet spokesman in Norfolk, Va.
   Heading in the opposite direction Thursday, two Cuban lobstermen
accused of smuggling Cubans to the Florida Keys were escorted back
to their island nation.
   The Coast Guard cutter Seahawk escorted the Sigma VII and the
two fishermen to international waters where they were met by a
Cuban gunboat.

   Q. Mr. President, when Sen. Phil Gramm of your adopted state
resigned his House seat, he _ he switched parties and resigned his
seat. Have you advised Congressman Robinson that that would be the
noble thing to do, to see if the voters approve of that conversion
you just announced?
   Bush: Well, I don't know that he needs any advice from me, just
like Phil didn't seek any from me in that regard.
   But you can ask him the question, if you want.
   Q. Congressman, do you plan to offer yourself for election as a
Republican?
   Robinson: That sounds like a typical Democratic question.
   The press: Awwww! (Laughter).
   Robinson: Let me say this, I represent 550,000 people in the 2nd
District of Arkansas _ Democrats, Republicans, independents, and
people, quite frankly, that don't care about any of the three above.
   We have no party registration in Arkansas.
   Republicans vote for me, Democrats, independents, the like.
   I am not going to resign.
   I'm going to be a good Republican congressman over the rest of
this session of Congress and work very hard for President Bush.
   Q. Mr. President, airline passengers would like to see the DC-10
planes grounded in the wake of that accident in Sioux City. There
have been other concerns about hydraulic problems with planes. Are
you concerned at all about the safety of our fleet, and do you have
any _ an opinion about the grounding of the DC-10s?
   Bush: I don't have an opinion about the grounding, but any time
there are accidents of this nature, you are concerned.
   The safety board is doing a thorough investigation, obviously,
on the flight coming out of Colorado.
   And the _ I expect the Department of Transportation has taken a
hard look at this in the light of the two recent happenings.
   But I don't really _ can't really give you a judgment as to
whether I personally feel that the answer at this juncture is the
grounding of this fleet.
   Yeah, Saul, then Dan.
   Q. Yes, on the flag desecration bill. There was testimony in the
Judiciary Committee that however you word it, such a constitutional
amendment would make an exception for the first time in 200 years
to the First Amendment. I wonder if you have any misgivings about
the possibility that you may be weakening the First Amendment?
   Bush: I thought about it, Saul, because you don't want to _ I
don't want to weaken anything.
   But I feel so strongly that a narrowly _ that a very carefully
drawn amendment can solve this problem, that I don't worry about
it, because I also fall back on the fact that the founding fathers
did provide for the amendment process.
   And _ but it's not a _ I mean, I don't have disrespect for those
who want to find a different answer.
   The thing that I think is heartening is that there's a wide
array of support for doing something about this question, people
that have maybe in the past not been identified, as I got to be
over some years, you know, in this department.
   But there _ so I don't question motives on this one.
   But I know what I think is right, and I know what our attorneys
have advised me is right, given the recent Supreme Court decision.

   Turkish Cypriot authorities on Friday
freed eight Greek Cypriot men detained for nine days after they
protested in the U.N.-policed buffer zone splitting this
Mediterranean island.
   The last two people among 108 arrested during the demonstration,
Greek Orthodox Bishop Chrysostomos of Larnaca and Father Giorgios
Papachrysostomou, remained jailed in the northern Turkish-occupied
sector after refusing to pay fines.
   The detentions have triggered a political crisis that has
aggravated sectarian tensions and delayed a round of reunification
talks between the Greek and Turkish Cypriot leaders.
   The 10 men were arrested July 19 with 98 women when Turkish
Cypriot riot police and soldiers burst into a church the protesters
were occupying on the Green Line dividing Cyprus.
   The women, who staged the demonstration to mark the 15th
anniversary of a Turkish invasion in 1974, have been released.
   The eight men freed on Friday were taken from a jail in the
Turkish-held zone and driven to the village of Astromeritis, 12
miles west of Nicosia, where they were handed over to United
Nations soldiers.
   The men, unshaven and several wearing torn shirts, linked arms
and sang a Byzantine hymn and the Greek national anthem as
relatives crowded around them.
   ``We were horribly treated at first ... beaten and threatened. I
was made to stand on one leg, blindfolded, while they questioned
me,'' said Dr. Andreas Constantinides, a surgeon who was providing
medical aid for the protesters.
   Parliament Speaker Vassos Lyssarides, standing in for President
George Vassiliou, who was on a visit to Greece, welcomed them on
behalf of the government.
   The protesters were sentenced on Saturday last week to three
days in jail on charges of entering the self-proclaimed republic of
northern Cyprus without permission and through an illegal gateway.
   The eight men released Friday were detained an additional five
days after they refused to pay a fine of $100 each. The bishop and
priest were expected to remain in jail until Thursday of next week
because they refused to pay $200 each in fines. None of the women
was fined.
   The Turkish Cypriots arrested the protesters even though they
were inside the Green Line area because they said the zone, even if
demilitarized, was still part of the breakaway state. The buffer
zone recently was expanded to include the church when Greek and
Turkish Cypriot forces agreed to pull back a bit in certain areas
of Nicosia as a confidence-building measure.
   Vassiliou said he was willing to go to reunifications talks set
for Wednesday, but the talks were called off when Turkish Cypriot
leader Rauf Denktash decided not to attend. The closed-door session
was to be held at the home of U.N. Special Representative Oscar
Camilion.
   The negotiations on a U.N. blueprint for reuniting the island as
a two-zone federation are expected to resume next week, but no date
has been set.
   Greek Cypriots staged marches and demonstrations in Nicosia to
press for the detainees' release. Women protesters were holding a
sit-in that blocked the main entrance to the U.N. Peacekeeping
Force's headquarters in the buffer zone.
   Cyprus has been divided since the Turks seized the northern
third of the island after a short-lived coup by supporters of union
with Greece. The Turkish Cypriots, who make up about 17 percent of
the population declared their own republic in 1983, but only Turkey
recognizes it.
   The U.N. peacekeepers have been in Cyprus since sectarian
fighting erupted in 1963. The 2,300-man force now patrols the
112-mile buffer zone known as the Green Line that zigzags across
the island.

   Communist Party leaders met Friday to
discuss plans for a fall congress to unite their divided ranks and
find attractive policies to win back waning support before
competitive elections next year.
   The meeting comes three days after party general secretary
Karoly Grosz and chairman Rezsoe Nyers, two of four members running
the party until the congress, held talks in Moscow on Hungary's
future.
   Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev appeared to endorse
Hungary's move to a multiparty system, telling the Hungarians that
socialist nations are searching for ways to create ``a society of
free people, masters of their lives and countries.''
   Hungary's MTI news agency said the party's Central Committee
convened Friday, and added that the congress would open Oct. 6 _ a
day earlier than scheduled _ to accommodate a large number of
speakers. It did not specify the duration of the meeting.
   State TV reported that the Reform Circles, a network of
reform-oriented party members, would hold a separate national
congress Sept. 1-3.
   There has been speculation over the possibility of a split
within the party, but reformists have so far sought to maneuver
within the organization.
   MTI quoted Central Committee Secretary Jenoe Kovacs as saying
there would be 1,300 delegates to the congress.
   The choice of delegates, due Aug. 25, is considered crucial to
the program and new leadership the congress is to endorse to try to
boost the party's waning popularity ahead of multiparty elections.
They will be Hungary's first free general elections since 1947.
   The Budapest meeting comes as Poland's Communist Party Central
Committee holds crucial talks to decide its future after a similar
experiment led to devastating election defeats. Poles
overwhelmingly supported independent Solidarity-led candidates.
   MTI also reported that negotiations for a timetable and
framework for Hungarian elections encountered setbacks Thursday.
   The party and democratic opposition failed to agree on how to
divide the property of the Communist Party and arrange financial
support for competing parties.
   MTI said the party insisted at closed-door talks that its
extensive property does not belong to the people, as the opposition
argued.
   The opposition wants a moratorium on sales of party property
after the communists recently sold some buildings, and suggested it
be divided up so the party enjoy no unfair financial or
organizational advantages going into the elections.
   Hungarian opposition activists have complained that, in a
state-run economy, it is hard for them to find property and install
such basic necessities as telephone lines to enable them to compete
with the communists.
   The two sides also split over whether or not parties should
operate at workplaces, as the communists have done in the past, MTI
said.
   No date was announced for the next negotiations. The slow-moving
talks have yet to bring agreement on key points such as an election
date and access to the media.
   The daily newspaper Magyar Nemzet quoted unidentified sources as
saying the absence of Imre Pozsgay, the Communist Party's leading
reformer and a member of the four-man leadership, was ``palpably
felt'' at Thursday's talks. Pozsgay is on vacation, the daily said.
   In his absence, a more conservative member of the party
negotiating team, Gyoergy Fejti, tried to renege on previous
agreements, it reported.

illegally importing chemicals not on the federal approved list,
improper certification of a chemical, and failure to notify an
intention to test a chemical. The fine was reduced by 25 percent
because the infraction was voluntarily reported.
   _$85,000 against Cavedon Chemical Co., Inc., of Woonsocket,
R.I., for failing to notify the EPA of its intention to manufactuer
four chemical substances. The company reported the violation and
had its fine reduced by 50 percent.
   _$28,000 against Surface Coatings Inc., of Wilmington, Mass.,
for failing to properly notify the EPA of the manufacturer of seven
chemical substances.
   _$10,000 against Howard Hall International of Cos Cob, Conn.,
for illegally importing a chemical not on the federally approved

<HEAD>Leadership Unable to Check Ethnic Tensions, Agency Says</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Communist leadership, deeply
split along regional lines, is to blame for the slide into a
``nationalist precipice,'' the official Tanjug news agency said
Friday.
   ``Relations between Yugoslavia's ethnic groups have reached the
lowest point in the postwar period,'' Tanjug said in an unsually
blunt commentary, as the Communist Party's Central Committee
prepared for a meeting devoted to ethnic and nationalist tensions.
   The meeting, scheduled to open Sunday and last for two days, is
being convened after a two-month delay during which the quarrelsome
leaders of Yugoslavia's republics tried to compromise on
nationalistic differences.
   The leadership in Serbia, the country's largest and most
populous republic, on Thursday attacked a draft declaration that
will be taken up at the two-day committee meeting.
   The declaration calls on the party ``to oppose all forms of
nationalist discrimination,'' including increasingly frequent
demands for privileged treatment of larger nationalities at the
expense of small ones.
   In a statement, Serbia's leadership branded the draft
``unacceptable,'' because of its implication that Serbs sought a
``privileged position'' within Yugoslavia. The leaderships of
Slovenia and Croatia welcomed the draft as a good basis for
discussion.
   According to official statistics, Serbs make up about 40 percent
of Yugoslavia's 23 million citizens, while Croats account for 20
percent and Slovenes for less than 10 percent. Macedonians,
Montenegrins, Moslems, ethnic Albanians and several other
minorities comprise the rest.
   Croatia and Slovenia have traditionally been wary of what they
claim are Serbian attempts to dominate Yugoslavia economically and
politically. Serbs deny this, contending that strong separatist and
nationalist tendencies exist in both northern republics,
Yugoslavia's wealthiest regions.
   ``What can the Central Committee and the Communist Party as a
whole ... do to stop the slide into a nationalist precipice?''
asked the Tanjug commentary. ``The geopolitically divided,
quarrelsome and confederalized party and its leaderships ... have
themselves contributed decisively to the drastic worsening of
ethnic tensions.''
   During the past month news media have reported a spate of
``nationalist incidents'' in various parts of the country,
particularly in resorts along the country's Adriatic coastline.
Most of those resorts are in Croatia.
   The incidents, usually involving brawls between local Croats and
Serb tourists, started after about 50,000 Serbs, chanting
nationalist slogans, staged a mass rally in western Croatia at the
beginning of July.
   In the past year, the leaderships and media of the different
regions have waged an all-out propaganda feud over ways to overcome
Yugoslavia's worst economic and social crisis.
   The country _ a loose federation of six republics and two
autonomous provinces _ is burdened with a $21 billion foreign debt,
a 700 percent annual inflation rate and stagnating economic growth.
   The living standard has been in steep decline since 1980, and
Yugoslavia, whose economic growth rate was second only to Japan's
in the 1970s, now has trouble manufacturing export products that
measure up to Western standards.
   The Communist leaderships of the republics, divided between
reformers and hardliners, have been unable to agree on whether to
introduce an open, free-market economy and greater political
freedoms as a way out of the crisis.

<HEAD>Deputy Back at Work After Shooting</HEAD>
<DATELINE>KANSAS CITY, Kan. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A deputy returned to work Friday, 10
hours after being shot in the back of the head when he tried to
stop a robbery _ when he wasn't even on duty.
   ``Somebody upstairs liked me; that's the only thing I can
figure,'' said Wyandotte County Deputy John Poke, 37, who was
wearing a gauze bandage around his head.
   The bullet entered Poke's head behind his left ear and went out
behind his left eye. Three pieces of fragment were left in his
temple. Poke spent just 90 minutes at the hospital.
   Police said four men apparently were involved in the holdup, but
no one was in custody Friday.
   Poke was off-duty when he drove by a grocery store late Thursday
and saw a man pointing a gun at the manager and forcing him toward
the store's safe.
   Poke said he pulled into the parking lot and pulled out his gun
as he walked toward a phone booth. The next thing he knew, someone
behind him was telling him to drop the gun.
   ``I saw a light flash. Then I felt a heat sensation from the
left side of my head,'' he said.
   Poke said the man fired four or five more shots and he fired one
shot at the assailant.
   ``I had blood in my eye, so his face was blurry,'' Poke said.
``When I got my bearings, it was like they disappeared into thin
air.''
   Poke estimated the gunman was no more than six feet away when he
shot the deputy. He said he could not figure out how most of the
gunfire missed him.
   Poke waved down a Board of Public Utilities employee, who called
the police. The thieves fled with no money. The store manager was
not injured.

<HEAD>Government to Investigate Reported Police Brutality Toward Boat People</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HONG KONG (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government on Friday promised a thorough
investigation of a report from the main U.N. refugee organization
alleging police brutality toward detained Vietnamese seeking asylum.
   Neither the government nor the United Nations High Commissioner
for Refugees would disclose details of the report. U.N. officials
have said previously, however, that it would focus on a disturbance
at a detention center in which more than 100 Vietnamese boat people
were injured.
   Authorities say the violence at the Sek Kong enter began Sunday,
when some of the Vietnamese detained there hurled stones at police
guards trying to prevent escapes through holes cut in fencing
around the camp. The unrest flared again several hours later.
   The camp holds 7,000 of the 50,000 Vietnamese languishing in
this British colony after fleeing their communist homeland by boat.
    Police said only four Vietnamese requested treatment for
injuries after the incident, including three who said they were
hurt accidentally.
   The U.N. report also was expected to contain allegations of
previous incidents of police violence at Sek Kong and other
detention centers.
   In response to the report, a government statement said officials
were taking the complaints ``very seriously and all allegations
against the government staff concerned will be fully and swiftly
investigated.''
   Police already are investigating the case of a 59-year-old
Vietnamese man who died the night of the Sek Kong disturbance. An
autopsy showed the man did not die of natural causes, but no
details have been released.
   The Vietnamese at Sek Kong are among the boat people who must
prove they fled political persecution or face repatriation.
   Local news media have reported growing tension in the detention
centers amid signs that Britain and Vietnam are near agreement on a
program of forcefully repatriating boat people who do not qualify
as refugees.

<HEAD>Bush Says He'll Still Win Defense Bill Fight</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Bush on Friday predicted victory for
his military priorities on Capitol Hill despite a series of defeats
this week when the House demolished his defense spending proposals.
   ``I think we will prevail for most of what we want,'' the
president said, standing behind the costly Strategic Defense
Initiative, popularly known as Star Wars, and the B-2 stealth
bomber as key components of his ``strategic concept.''
   Funds for those two systems, along with Bush's request for the
MX rail missile and the single-warhead Midgetman missile, were
reduced or cut out completely in the House-passed version of the
defense authorization bill on Thursday.
   ``I am disappointed that the House did what they did,'' Bush
said. He noted that the lawmakers restored money for some of the
systems that he and Defense Secretary Dick Cheney advocated cutting
out. ``Yesterday was not the House's most memorable moment, but
we're going to keep fighting on for what we believe in,'' he said.
   Bush made the comments at a wide-ranging news conference that he
called to spotlight the switch by Rep. Tommy Robinson of Arkansas
from the Democratic to the Republican Party.
   The president also expressed confidence he would prevail with
his multibillion-dollar bailout plan for the savings &amp; loan
industry, even though House and Senate negotiators this week agreed
on a plan that rejects a key funding mechanism he has insisted on.
   Touching on other areas in which he is encountering rough
sledding in Congress, the president:
   _ Staunchly defended his embattled nominee to head the Justice
Department's civil rights division, William Lucas.
   _ Said he still wants a constitutional amendment to ban burning
of the American flag, but ``I will see what comes down'' in
congressional legislation that Democrats say would do the same
thing. The House Judiciary Committee this week approved the
legislation and blocked consideration of a constitutional amendment.
   _ Said he is willing to ``see what can be worked out'' on
cutting the capital gains tax. His proposal has encountered
substantial Democratic opposition as a boon to the rich. ``I don't
think I should ever say it's got to be done just this way in terms
of the bills up there in the House Ways and Means Committee right
now,'' he said.
   Asked about the legislative roadblocks that have met several of
his proposals on Capitol Hill, Bush said, ``Nobody ever said it
would be easy.''
   ``I would not give Congress very high marks,'' he added.
   But he said he did not want to engage in inflammatory rhetoric
because, with Democratic majorities in both the Senate and House,
``I have to work with these people.''
   ``It's a question of style, I think. I'll take a shot at them
once in a while if they get too outrageous,'' he said.
   On defense spending, Bush said his own proposals already
included cuts in Star Wars spending, and ``we don't need further
cuts in SDI.''
   The House chopped $1.8 billion from his request for $4.9 billion.
   The president said he needs the ``solid strategic program'' he
has proposed in part because it strengthens his hand in arms
control talks with the Soviet Union. ``I do not want to negotiate
with the Soviet Union without as many cards in my hand as possible
so there's an arms control dimension to what were talking about,
too.''
   On other topics, the president:
   _ Said he was ``very concerned about premature discussion and
disclosure _ that means leaks'' about the case of Felix S. Bloch,
the U.S. diplomat suspected of spying for the Soviets, ``because I
think you can jeopardize the case itself and perhaps the man's
ability to get a fair hearing.''
   _ Acknowledged his advisers disagreed over allowing the export
of small personal computers to the Soviet Union, with Defense
Secretary Cheney opposed to it because of potential security
applications. But Bush said he supported the Commerce Department
decision to allow the exports, which ``will not endanger the
legitimate national security needs of this country.''
   _ Said he did not condone the kidnapping of a Shiite Moslem
leader by Israeli commandos in Lebanon and doesn't know if the act
could lead to freedom for an American hostage.
   _ Expressed frustration over the U.S. inability so far to get
Panamanian ruler Manuel Noriega out of power. He said, ``I wish I
could give you a much clearer answer that there is some plan that
is going to solve this problem in the way it must be solved.'' He
spoke of the diplomatic effort by the Organization of American
States as a sign of ``some hope'' to resolve the situation.
   _ Refused to respond directly to harsh criticisms leveled by
outgoing Customs Commissioner William von Raab who said he saw a
lack of commitment or interest in the departments of State and
Treasury on fighting the drug war. Bush said the real question was
``how do we do better?'' and that nothing would be gained by
``going around assigning blame to people that are trying hard.''

<TEXT>
   President Bush said Friday he felt confident
Senate Republicans would block Democrats from adding the
multibillion-dollar cost of the savings and loan bailout to the
budget deficit.
   House and Senate negotiators reached agreement late Thursday on
landmark legislation that would cost $166 billion over 10 years to
close and rescue hundreds of failed S&amp;Ls, sweepingly overhaul the
regulatory bureaucracy and impose tough new financial standards on
the industry.
   However, Bush wants to keep $50 billion of the spending out of
the budget deficit in the next three years. He objects to the
Democratic plan which would balloon the reported deficit, while at
the same time waiving the Gramm-Rudman deficit-reduction law to
avoid automatic spending cuts.
   The package next goes to the full House, where a vote is
expected Wednesday or Thursday, and then to the full Senate before
Congress recesses Aug. 5 for vacation.
   Senate rules permit 41 senators to block any waiver of the
Gramm-Rudman law and Bush predicted at a news conference his
position would prevail.
   Sen. Phil Gramm, R-Texas, chief sponsor of the deficit-cutting
law, has already collected signatures from 40 other Republicans
vowing to support the president on the issue.
   ``It won't come to vetoing ... because we have forty-plus votes
in the Senate that, staying firm, will see our proposal prevail,''
Bush said. ``The House, as you know, has disagreed with us, but I'm
confident that we will do all right on that one.''
   Gramm, at a separate news conference, said the Democratic plan,
by waiving Gramm-Rudman, would destroy the spending discipline
imposed by the law.
   ``The problem with this sham is that next week we could do the
same thing for the nuclear cleanup ... education ... the war on
drugs ... and pretty soon we would have a balanced budget where the
deficit was $300 billion or $400 billion,'' he said.
   ``Unless God palsies my voice I intend stand up and raise a
budget point of order under the Gramm-Rudman law against this $50
billion increase in the budget deficit,'' he said.
   Democrats, however, argue that their plan will reduce the cost
of borrowing S&amp;L money. They say both plans evade Gramm-Rudman, but
theirs has the virtue of more honestly accounting for the spending.
   ``The bill provides funding on-budget, a provision that will
ensure ... that the facts about the cost will be laid clearly
before the American people,'' said Rep. Henry B. Gonzalez, D-Texas,
chairman of the House Banking Committee.
   He said Gramm, by holding up money badly needed to rescue failed
S&amp;Ls, risks political damage in Texas, where about half the
industry's losses are concentrated.
   ``If Mr. Gramm or I or anyone else were seen as obstructionist,
we would have to face public indignation,'' Gonzalez told a third
news conference.
   His Senate counterpart, Sen. Donald W. Riegle Jr., D-Mich.,
noted at the same briefing that S&amp;L losses are accumulating at $20
million a day and urged Gramm and Bush not stand in the way of
swift resolution of the crisis.
   He argued that Bush, except for the financing mechanism,
received virtually everything else he requested when he first
outlined the administration's proposal six months ago.
   ``We ought not to get tangled up in parliamentary maneuvers at
this point. ... I would hope the administration would take a very
close look at what we have done here. We've given President Bush
his plan in every essential detail,'' Riegle said.
   Gramm, however, said Democrats, not Republicans, are delaying
the legislation. He said he warned in early June he would block
their funding plan on the Senate floor but they adopted it anyway.
   ``Quite frankly we are engaged in a game of chicken. It was not
a game I sought,'' he said.

   Former President Jimmy Carter said
Friday he is confident peace talks between the Ethiopian government
and Eritrean rebels can bring an end to the civil war.
   Carter came to Zimbabwe from Ethiopia and said Ethiopian
President Mengistu Haile Mariam's Marxist government and the
Eritrean People's Liberation Front have agreed to set up
negotiating committees to discuss their differences.
   The front has been fighting for 28 years for autonomy in the
northern province of Eritrea.
   ``I think there is a better prospect now to end ... war than
there has ever been since the war began,'' Carter told reporters in
Harare.
   He said more than a million people have been killed in the
warfare.
   ``Both sides are now willing to try and bring about a resolution
of the conflict through direct talks,'' Carter said. ``We have been
doing everything we can to orchestrate direct talks between
President Mengistu and the Eritrean liberation forces.''
   He said Mengistu accepted an offer by the Atlanta-based Carter
Center to help bring the warring sides to the negotiating table.
   ``Any specific announcements will have to come from the parties
in the conflict,'' he said.
   Carter said that during the July 24-26 summit of the
Organization of Africn Unity in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, he met with
Sudanese military leader Lt. Gen. Omar Hassan El-Bashir and
discussed possible peace talks to end Sudan's 6-year-old civil war.
   ``I was encouraged by his commitment to the peace process,''
Carter said.
   He also said experts in mediation and arbitration supported by
the Carter Center were in contact with the rebels' Sudan People's
Liberation Army.
   ``We have been and will remain in touch with the leaders of both
sides,'' he added.
   Most of the rebels in southern Sudan are Christians or animists
and accuse the Moslem majority that controls the country of
discrimination.
   Carter announced earlier in Harare the establishement of a
non-government aid program called Project Africa to assist African

<HEAD>Letter From Gorbachev Critic Assails Reformers</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Denunciations of Josef Stalin and other Soviet
leaders are a prelude to open attacks on Lenin and the Bolshevik
Revolution itself, a critic of President Mikhail S. Gorbachev says
in a letter published in a magazine.
   The letter from Nina Andreyeva, a 51-year-old Leningrad
chemistry teacher, also said political reforms initiated by
Gorbachev are being used for personal gains by opponents of the
Communist Party.
   Her letter was published in the July issue of the conservative
monthly Young Guard.
   She said attacks on Stalin and other Soviet leaders ``are only a
screen to camouflage a gathering of forces for the beginning
attacks on Lenin, Marxism-Leninism, the October Revolution and the
victory of the U.S.S.R. in the Great Patriotic War (World War II).''
   ``It is hard for many people to see where the plurality of
opinion ends and open jeering at everything sacred begins,'' she
said.
   Since Gorbachev initiated a policy of glasnost, or openness,
after coming to power in 1985, figures such as dictator Josef
Stalin and the corrupt Leonid I. Brezhnev have been denounced
publicly.
   In March 1988, a letter from Mrs. Andreyeva defending Stalin was
published by the newspaper Sovietskaya Rossiya, setting off a storm
of controversy and worrying liberals that glasnost might be ending.
   Some Soviet observers said that letter was sponsored by
conservative Politburo member Yegor Ligachev. Ligachev, who remains
on the Politburo but has since slipped from his No. 2 position,
also has complained that glasnost goes too far in uncovering past
mistakes and failing to praise past achievements.
   A month later, the Communist Party newspaper Pravda castigated
Sovietskaya Rossiya for printing the letter, and the reprimanded
newspaper admitted it had been irresponsible.
   In her latest letter, Mrs. Andreyeva questions Gorbachev's
program of perestroika, or reconstruction, of the political and
economic structure of the country.
   ``I have been getting mail from everywhere and people are
wondering why we are restructuring socialism. For years, we have
been talking about perestroika more than actually working on it,''
she wrote.
   She assailed reformist historians Roy Medvedev and Yuri
Afanasyev.
   ``Medvedev has published almost 30 books in the West without
even disturbing dust accumulated on archive files,'' she said.
``Afanasyev has surprised even foreign anti-Soviets by condensed
statements and assessments that heap ignominy on the Soviet order
and are insulting to our people.''
   Mrs. Andreyeva said sensational revelations by the historians
``lead not only to their popularity with the public at large, but
also to an impressive financial well-being.''
   She said opponents of the Communist Party are using perestroika
and glasnost to further their own means.
   While communists campaigned in the March election using methods
of socialist democracy, opponents ``armed themselves with
parliamentary methods of bourgeois democracy which, as is well
known, are not characterized by decency or nobleness,'' she said.
   She said unofficial groups are amassing large amounts of money
from the black market to push for legality in the country where the
Communist Party is the only legal political party.
   ``Fed by millions of rubles from the shadow economy, they are
striving to become legal. They lead to an aggravation of
inter-ethnic relations and stimulate the growth of nationalism,
which is finding an awesome expression in tendencies toward
separatism, which leads to tragedies and appeals for secession from
the U.S.S.R.,'' Mrs. Andreyeva said.
   She called for a return to earlier values.
   ``Socialism, though far from being perfect, is a fact of our
life,'' she said.

<TEXT>
   Q. Mr. President _
   Bush: But I don't _ and I also would say, I don't think this
does violation to the Constitution of the United States.
   If I did, I wouldn't be making this proposal.
   Dan, and then Ann.
   Q. Mr. President, if I could follow on capital gains, if the
goal is to generate new investment and jobs, why not design the tax
so that it only applies to new investment and long-term investment
rather than providing a windfall to people who already hold assets?
   Bush: Because it _ it _ I think there are also revenue aspects
of it, so when you turn over in accordance with this capital gains
proposal, you're actually going to increase revenues to the federal
government, as happened when the Steiger amendment was passed.
   So it's not a revenue loser.
   Yes?
   Q. Mr. President, without discussing the specifics of the Bloch
case, could you tell us whether you would support random
polygraphs, or some other increased security measures to lessen the
possibility that this might happen in the future, or that espionage
might happen in the future?
   Bush: Well, when I was head of the intelligence community I
supported the polygraph program there in CIA.
   I'm not sure that it needs to be extended to other agencies.
   I am one who is very concerned about the security implications
of this, and _ but I _ polygraphing, regrettably, has taken on a
concept of being against somebody's rights, like drug testing in a
sense.
   And I think it's got to be very careful because you want
whatever program you have to be effective; you don't want to
discourage good people from signing up.
   But I haven't rethought my position _ if that's the question _
in the wake of the allegations against Mr. Bloch.
   In the middle over here.
   Q. Mr. President _
   Bush: I'm getting the hook put on me.
   Two more.
   Once, twice _ right in the middle.
   Q. Customs Commisioner von Raab has _
   Q. OK _
   Bush: Not quite _ sorry.
   Yeah?
   Q. Customs Commissioner von Raab has said that the war on drugs
by the federal government is a ``dismal failure,'' that the State
Department is ``a department that wasn't there,'' that Treasury
Secretary Brady is disengaged and disinvolved in the war on drugs.
I suspect I have an idea of what your answer to that might be, but
it is true that drug use is way up, that Congress has not funded
the drug programs that have been passed in the last couple of
years. What can you say in light of those facts, how could you
dispute Commissioner von Raab, if indeed you'd like to do that?
   Bush: Well, I don't see much reason getting into a _ into a _
I'll phrase this very politely _ (laughter) _ a ``match'' of any
kind with _ (laughter) _ Willie von Raab as he leaves the
government.
   And I think he's worked very hard in his field at Customs.
   I worked with him when I was on the vice president's task force
that I headed up.
   Look, the answer is not to respond to criticism who goes after
people that are working hard, like Secretary Brady, who has my full
confidence, but it is to do better.
   And that's what I'm confident the whole drug plan that Bill
Bennett is coming up (with) will address itself to, how do we do
better?
   You know, it's easy to sit and without a tremendous amount of
experience in foreign affairs, and say, ``Well, we ought to cut off
Colombia. We ought to do nothing, give no business with Colombia
whatsoever,'' because an awful lot of this insidious stuff comes
out of Colombia.
   The Colombian government is trying, they are cooperating with us
_ President Barco is.
   We _ what I think we ought to do, instead of doing _ taking that
kind of action, is find ways to help him more.

   And I talked about that, incidentally, with Margaret Thatcher
and Helmut Kohl on the recent tirp.
   But, look, I can't _ I can't go into responding to the personal
criticisms, but I want to see us do better.
   We've got good proposals that _ some of which we have made, and
some that are on the drawing board right now.
   And no American can be relaxed about where things stand.
   But going around assigning blame to people that are trying hard,
I don't think that's the answer.
   This is the last one.
   Q. Mr. President, Noriega is still in charge in Panama. The GAO
says the sanctions haven't worked. Where are you going on Panama,
and are you going to accept the situation the way it is?
   Bush: Well _ a little competition over here _ OAS meeting passed
a resolution that offers some hope.
   Our _ the American position is and will remain that Noriega has
to get out.
   We are _ I wish I could give you a much clearer answer that
there is some plan that is going to solve this problem in the way
it must be solved.
   And the way it must be solved is Noriega out, and a free, fair
election recognized; or, if the Panamanians decide to go with
another election, held and recognized.
   But there's a great frustration level for me on this one;
there's no question about that.
   Thank you all.
   Ellen, are you feeling deprived? (Laughter.)
   You thought I had pointed to you, and I had.
   Go ahead, and then I'll do the walking act with you. (Laughter.)
   Q. Exxon says it wants to take its cleaning equipment and go
home and -- (inaudible). You said during the campaign you're an
environmentalist. Is there anything you can do to convince them to
finish the job?
   Bush: Well, Exxon _ I haven't _ I don't know whether John has
talked to them _ or Sam Skinner.
   An awful lot has been done _ thank heavens _ on this cleanup.
   And we will stay engaged and encourage whoever it is to stay
engaged until this cleanup is complete.
   The reports on fishing and some of these matters are quite
encouraging, I might add.
   So we'll wait and see.
   You know, the final assessment won't be in for a long time.
   But I don't want to see Exxon prematurely leave the scene or
prematurely fail to live up to the firm commitments they have made.
   I heard a statement _ again, it was only a part of it _ which I
took to be somewhat encouraging _ from an Exxon spokesman, who
referred to taking a look, once the weather was agreeable again, to
the kind of work that needs to be done.
   So _ but if I had the feeling Exxon was going to pull back on an
agreement or fail to fulfill an agreement they'd made with us, with
the government or with the state of Alaska, I would be very much
exercised about that and try my best to do something about it.
   The press: Thank you.

<HEAD>Bush Skirts Veto Question on Flag-Burning Proposal</HEAD>
<HEAD>With AM-Bush</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Bush on Friday refused to say
whether he'd veto a Democratic-sponsored effort to outlaw flag
burning because their statute does not go along with his insistence
on a constitutional amendment.
   ``I will see what comes down here, but I will continue to push
for the approach that I think is the best, given the Supreme Court
decision,'' he said.
   Asked if that meant he might sign the bill, Bush said, ``I
didn't say that.''
   The House Judiciary Committee on Thursday approved a
Democratic-sponsored criminal statute with a year in jail and an
unspecified fine for people who burn flags.
   House Speaker Thomas S. Foley, D-Wash., and others argue that a
regular statute could overcome the Supreme Court ruling that flag
burning was a protected form of political protest. A constitutional
amendment, they argue, could erode First Amendment rights.
   Bush told reporters Friday the amendment he supports is
carefully drawn, so he isn't worried about infringing on the First
Amendment.
   ``I don't have disrespect for those who want to find a different
answer,'' he said. It was ``heartening ... that there's a wide
array of support for doing something about this question,'' he said.
   The president's words seemed to downplay the political battle in
Congress between supporters of the amendment and of the statute.
But the president's political operatives are working to use the
issue against Democrats who oppose his amendment by painting them
as somehow unpatriotic.
   House Republican Leader Bob Michel, R-Ill., said Thursday that
White House Chief of Staff John Sununu urged GOP leaders this week
to speak out because the flag amendment was a ``wedge issue'' _ one
that divides and troubles Democrats.
   Foley said Friday he found it troubling that ``they want to take
the respect that Americans have for the flag and twist it into a
political issue.''

<TEXT>
   Exhausted from battling a current pushing her
away from shore, a Canadian marathon swimmer gave up early Friday
in her charity fund-raiser swim from Santa Catalina Island to the
mainland.
   Vicki Keith's support crew persuaded her to quit at 3:19 a.m.,
after she had gained less than half a mile in the last eight hours
of her swim, said crew member Craig Williams.
   Keith was less than six miles from Cabrillo Beach, the goal she
had set for herself 19 hours earlier, when she stopped. She started
the swim at Santa Catalina's Emerald Bay, about 24 miles from
Cabrillo Beach.
   Keith, who was asleep Friday and unavailable for comment, also
had been hallucinating and thought that a huge tanker was alongside
her, Williams said.
   ``That was something else that told us that she was too tired,
because usually she doesn't hallucinate until the second night,''
Williams said.
   Last summer, Keith mastered all five of the Great Lakes in a
similar venture that raised more than $550,000 for a Toronto sports
training and fitness center and a children's aquatic center.
   She has made the 42-mile English Channel crossing and swam
Australia's Sydney Harbor in previous marathons, also associated
with children's charities.
   The sea off the California coast is dominated by currents
carrying cold water southward from Alaska, but the current Keith
fought through the night was running westward, Williams said. The
water temperature was in the 60s.
   Keith wanted to continue, but the crew was worried that she
would be so exhausted by the effort that she would be unable to
recover sufficiently for a scheduled swim at Juan de Fuca, British
Columbia, on Aug. 10.
   Keith also ``worried if she didn't complete the swim that she
wouldn't raise as much money for the kids,'' Williams said.
   Keith's swim was intended to raise funds for the Los Angeles
chapter of Variety Children's Charities, which sponsors
fund-raising events for children's philanthropic programs in the
Los Angeles area.

<HEAD>Britain Hopes for Better Relations with Argentina</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Foreign Office Minister Tim Sainsbury said Friday
that Argentina's new president appears to be seeking ``more
normal'' relations, and Britain will respond positively.
   ``I hope we can look forward to a period of tangible achievement
in our relations with Argentina; that's certainly our aim,''
Sainsbury told the House of Commons Friday before Parliament
adjourned for the summer recess.
   Sainsbury, under questioning from a legislator, refused to say
if Argentine President Carlos Menem has sought to reopen
negotiations with Britain over the disputed Falkand Islands, off
the coast of Argentina, and the restoration of diplomatic relations.
   ``It is a very delicate matter. You would not expect me to go
into details at this stage,'' said Sainsbury. ``But you may rest
assured that we will respond positively to any proposals consistent
with our commitment to the Falkland Islanders.''
   He said Menem, who took office July 8, apparently seeks improved
relations while while putting aside the ``delicate issue'' of
sovereignty over the Falklands.
   Argentina invaded and occupied the British colony in 1982, but
British forces recaptured the islands in a 74-day war.
   After the war Britain promised the 1,600 Falklands residents,
most of whom are of British descent, that it would not negotiate
the issue of sovereignty.
   Previous attempts to improve relations have foundered on the
question of sovereignty.
   Britain wants to normalize trade relations with Argentina,
negotiate a fishing agreement, re-establish air links and reduce
tension. That could lead to a reduction of the costs of maintaining
a British military garrison on the islands.
   During the debate Conservative Party legislator Ray Whitney said
Menem had created a ``distinct and new atmosphere which we must
seize and take advantage of.''
   ``We cannot miss the opportunity which is now opening up,''
added Whitney, who was chairman of the governing Conservatives'
foreign affairs committee during the war for the Falkland Islands,
known in Argentina as the Malvinas Islands.
   He said new diplomatic moves would disturb the islanders, who
want to maintain the present status, but their long-term interests
``can only be guaranteed by a different set of relationships''
between Britain and Argentina.

   A research lab where a technician
died of a rare virus contracted from a monkey was cited and fined
Friday for unsafe working conditions and failure to tell employees
about the job risks.
   International Research and Development Corp. of Mattawan was
fined $30,600 for six violations, ``five for willful violations and
one for a serious violation,'' of the Michigan Occupational Safety
and Health Administration rules, the Department of Public Health
said.
   The investigation followed the June 20 death of Thomas McGeorge,
23, who was infected with the herpes B virus after being scratched
or bitten by a rhesus monkey, a species commonly used in lab
experiments.
   The violations include failure to record and medically monitor
77 employee monkey bites and scratches during the two months before
McGeorge's death.
   Other violations include failure to properly train employees in
the hazards and health risks of their jobs and failure to perform
follow-ups on injured employees, according to the report, signed by
Michael S. Mosher, district supervisor of the state OSHA.
   Questionnaires given to employees by the agency found that of 71
employees who had direct contact with the monkeys, 29 said they had
never heard of the B virus before McGeorge's death.
   Guidelines drawn up two years ago by the federal Center for
Disease Control say that all employees handling such potentially
infected monkeys should be told of the risks.
   Beside McGeorge, another former laboratory employee also is
infected with the virus. The 21-year-old man, whose name has not
been released, was discharged from Bronson Methodist Hospital in
Kalamazoo last week following three weeks of treatment, hospital
officials said.
   IRDC ``emphatically denies the cruel and untrue `allegations'
outlined in the MiOSHA report,'' company spokesman James Webb said
in a statement. ``No employee of IRDC has ever been willfully
injured nor has the company ever violated any laws.''
   Webb said the company plans to appeal the report's findings.
   The report said IRDC's records show tests conducted on the
approximately 190 rhesus monkeys from China before the experiment
began found that about 40 percent of them carried the virus.
   The virus is commonly found in rhesus monkeys and is harmless to
the animals. But it has an estimated 70 percent mortality rate
among humans once symptoms appear.
   The company has said the two infected employees never reported
any bites or scratches; but the report found that no illness or
injury log was kept, as recommended by the CDC.
   The company, also under investigation by the U.S. Department of
Agriculture, employs about 350 people, uses thousands of animals,
including monkeys, dogs, rabbits and rats, to test drugs and
chemicals for pharmaceutical companies.
   Blood tests on about 140 current and former IRDC employees have
not turned up any other cases of the virus, which attacks the brain
and central nervous system. Twelve inconclusive tests are being
redone, officials said.

   The Soviet Navy will disband several air, sea,
marine and coastal artillery units this year and next as part of a
general reduction in Soviet armed forces, Tass reported Friday.
   The official news agency quoted Adm. Vladimir Chernavin, the
navy commander, but gave no details.
   Last December, President Mikhail S. Gorbachev announced plans to
trim the Red Army by 500,000 men and reduce the defense budget by
14.2 percent.
   Chernavin, in the interview with Tass, blamed recent accidents
of Soviet navy vessels on faulty design, poor workmanship and low
naval training standards.
   A nuclear-powered submarine carrying nuclear weapons sank off
Norway in April, and in June, a pipe burst in the reactor cooling
system of another sub.
   The admiral said the Soviet Union has lost only three
nuclear-powered subs in 25 years. Western sources count at least
five submarine sinkings and numerous other accidents resulting in
crew deaths and radiation leaks, but it is not known whether all
lost subs were nuclear.

   The United States will tell the Soviet Union
at a meeting this weekend in Stockholm it would be a mistake to
rearm Iran and Moscow should use its improving ties with Tehran to
help American hostages held in Lebanon, an American official said
Friday.
   The meeting in the Swedish capital between a U.S. delegation
headed by Assistant Secretary of State John Kelly and a Soviet
delegation led by Nicolai Kozyrev is part of a series of regional
sessions the two superpowers have been holding as part of their
improving relations.
   The main topic will be Afghanistan, where, the official said,
the Soviets have increased weapons shipments to the Kabul
government to a rate of $2{ billion to $3 billion a year. That is
about double the lethal aid Moscow had given President Najibullah's
government before the Red Army withdrew its last troops in
mid-February.
   Despite an over-all improvement in relations, the Soviets have
complained publicly about continued U.S. arms shipments to rebels
seeking to overthrow Najibullah. They charge both the United States
and Pakistan, which funnels the weapons to the Mujahedeen, with
violating the Geneva Accords that led to the Soviet troop
withdrawal.
   The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the U.S.
weapons deliveries would continue in an effort to counter
stepped-up Soviet military supplies.
   In Washington Friday, Soviet Marshal Sergei Akhromeyev, a
military adviser to President Mikhail Gorbachev, said both the
United States and the Kremlin ``ought to take steps to end
hostilities'' in Afghanistan.
   The Soviets meanwhile, are expected to reiterate their
complaints when Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze meets
Saturday with Secretary of State James A. Baker III in Paris, where
they will attend the opening of a month-long conference on Cambodia.
   After the death of the Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, the Soviets
agreed to provide arms to Iran, but the official said it was not
clear whether potent weapons would be delivered or spare parts for
old Soviet arms.
   ``We think it would be bad for them to start rearming Iran and
we wouldn't like to see new military systems delivered,'' he said.
   The U.S. view is that Soviet weapons in Iranian hands would be
destabilize the Persian Gulf region. Kelly also is expected to tell
Kozyrev that arming Iran would hurt the Soviet image in the Arab
world.

<TEXT>
   Rep. Tommy Robinson of Arkansas became the
second House Democrat this year to switch to the Republican Party,
lambasting his old party Friday as ``unwilling to listen to the
majority of the American people.''
   The third-term congressman, making his announcement in a
nationally televised appearance from the White House, was welcomed
by President Bush as ``a man of the poeple, a man who believes in
straight talk, hard work and getting the job done.''
   Robinson, a former sheriff of Pulaski County, was the third
Democrat this week to be commended by Bush after announcing he was
changing his party affiliation.
   The others were retiring District of Columbia Police Chief
Maurice Turner, said to be considering a run for mayor of the
nation's capital, and Louisiana Secretary of State Fox McKeithen,
son of Democratic Gov. John McKeithen and a prospective opponent to
Democratic Sen. Bennett Johnston.
   Robinson has reportedly been considering a run for governor of
Arkansas in 1990. Robinson has said he has made a decision but
won't announce it until Congress finishes its business this year.
   Robinson's switch leaves the House with 256 Democrats and 176
Republicans, with three vacancies.
   The conservative lawmaker's party switch brought immediate
derision from his former Democratic colleagues.
   ``We Democrats are happy that Robinson has finally come out of
the closet politically so we can fight him out in the open,'' said
Rep. Bill Alexander, D-Ark., who called Robinson ``a Republican
sympathizer since he's been here.''
   ``I'm glad to have him out in the open instead of snaking me
behind my back,'' Alexander said.
   Rep. Beryl Anthony, D-Ark., called Robinson ``a cagey politician
(with) the ability to confuse a lot of people.''
   Democrats called on Robinson to resign his seat and seek
election as a Republican. ``The most important thing is for the
voters to render a verdict,'' said Democratic National Committee
spokesman Mike McCurry.
   But Robinson said he would not resign, as Texas Sen. Phil Gramm
did in 1983, when, as a Democratic member of the House, he changed
party affiliation. Gramm later won his seat back in a special
election.
   ``We have no party registration in Arkansas. Republicans vote
for me, Democrats, independents, the like. I am not going to
resign,'' Robinson said.
   Rep. Bill Grant of Florida made the switch from the Democratic
to the Republican party in February.
   As for his former comrades, Robinson said there is ``no room for
conservative Southern Democrats in today's national Democratic
Party.''
   ``Even after losing five of the last six presidential elections
in the nation and Arkansas, the leadership of the Democratic Party
still is unwilling to listen to the majority of the American
people,'' he said.
   Robinson, first elected in 1984, and re-elected in 1986 and
1988, serves on the House Armed Services, Veterans Affairs and
Aging committees.
   Earlier this year Robinson made headlines because he hired the
22-year-old daughter of his close friend, business partner and
financial backer, Dallas Cowboys owner Jerry Jones, and paid her
$60,000 as a member of his congressional staff.
   Robinson reported owing at least $100,000 to Jones.
   Other Capitol Hill aides just out of college generally make far
less than Miss Jones' salary.

<HEAD>Autopsy Shows Suspect's Father Didn't Die Of Arsenic Poisoning</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BURLINGTON, N.C. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The father of a woman charged with two
arsenic murders had the poison in his system when he died, but it
wasn't a fatal dose, the state's chief medical examiner said Friday.
   The body of Parker Kiser was exhumed a week ago to determine if
he was a victim of arsenic poisoning. His daughter, Blanche Taylor
Moore, is charged with two counts of murder and one of assault in
the arsenic poisonings of her two husbands and a boyfriend.
   Mrs. Moore, 56, a retired grocery clerk, has said she is
innocent.
   ``We did not find toxic concentrations of arsenic in Mr.
Kiser,'' said Dr. John Butts, the medical examiner. ``We did find
he had severe heart disease. We feel he died as a result of his
heart disease. We did find some arsenic in his system at low
concentrations.''
   Kiser died in September 1966 at age 62.
   Butts said the amount of arsenic wasn't a reliable indicator of
whether the poisoning was accidental or intentional.
   Lt. Steve Lynch the arsenic levels were a cause for concern, but
he said no charges have been filed in the case.
   Kiser's body was exhumed as police expanded their investigation
to consider other possible victims. Butts said he is examining the
medical records of four other dead people and expects to get more.
   Lynch said he also has made inquiries into sicknesses of living
people, including both of Mrs. Moore's sons-in-law.
   Mrs. Moore was charged earlier this month with murder in the
October 1972 death of James Taylor, her first husband, and the
October 1986 death of Raymond Reid, a boyfriend. She is facing
assault charges in the arsenic poisoning of her current husband,
the Rev. Dwight Moore, who was hospitalized shortly after the
couple's honeymoon this spring.
   Mrs. Moore is being held without bail in the Alamance County
Jail.

<DATELINE>WINNIPEG, Manitoba (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Hundreds of evacuees who fled forest
fires began returning to their homes Friday, but thousands more
awaited rains to dampen fires that still burned in central Canada.
   Firefighters said they had brought some fires under control,
allowing 1,400 more people to begin the journey to homes in
northern Manitoba and Ontario.
   On Thursday, more than 4,000 evacuees from those provinces and
Saskatchewan were allowed to return to their remote northern
communities.
   Canada's worst forest fire season in memory kept 19,000 people
in makeshift accommodations Friday, however, most of them in
Manitoba.
   Cooler temperatures and scattered rains have helped in the past
few days, but firefighters say a good downpour is the only
solution. Skies were mostly clear Friday.
   In Quebec, a forest fire that started more than three weeks ago
in the James Bay area flared again near a hydroelectric site. About
150 tourists were evacuated from there Tuesday.
   The first contingents of about 1,000 residents of Grand Rapids
in Manitoba set out in buses from Winnipeg for the five-hour drive
home Friday.
   Another 400 from Bearskin Lake, Ontario, began the long process
of being ferried back to their remote community in a 40-seater Dash
7 plane from Cochenour, north of Red Lake, and Big Trout Lake,
another reserve where many sought shelter.
   ``It's going to be a long day,'' said Deborah MacLean, spokesman
for the Ontario Ministry of Natural Resources, which she said is
looking for more aircraft to hasten the process.
   At last count, there were 236 fires burning in Manitoba, 188 in
Ontario and 114 in Saskatchewan. Most were started by lightning.
   Manitoba has been worst hit. Fires there consumed more than 1. 7
million hectares, including large tracts of prime timber.
   Officials say the fires have caused $30 million damage in
Manitoba and could drain $150 million more from the provincial
economy in lost revenue from tourism, fishing and logging.

<HEAD>Oldest Atomic Reactor In Latin America Threatened With Shutdown</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ANTHONY CAPLAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CARACAS, Venezuela (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Latin America's oldest atomic reactor
may be shut down after 30 years of operation because of a lack of
funds, said scientists using it for research.
   The RV-1, at Venezuela's Institute for Scientific Investigation,
enjoyed a heyday during the oil-boom decade of the seventies, said
Alberto Maneiro, one of two engineers still involved in programs
using the reactor.
   ``The main benefit we've gotten from it has been the training of
over 300 technicians and scientists in nuclear technology,'' said
Maneiro.
   The reactor, with a potential for producing just 3 megawatts of
power from its chain reactions, is running sporadically at about
half power, said Maneiro.
   ``We do the best we can for maintenance. The problem is the
government funding has dried up,'' said Maneiro.
   The institute uses isotopes from the reactor in medical
research, including the formulation of new parasite medications,
said Maneiro.
   Since the fuel used is primarily uranium and not plutonium, use
of nuclear waste as material for nuclear weapons is impossible,
according to Maneiro.
   Venezuela is a signatory of the Rio de Janeiro pact, which holds
it to maintaining a nuclear-free military.
   The head of the institute's physics department, Maximo Garcia
Sucre, said the reactor needs just $160,000 in immediate funding to
keep it running safely.
   If the money is not forthcoming in the next several months, the
institute will shut down the reactor, said Garcia Sucre, closing an
ambitious chapter of the small nation's efforts to lift itself into
the modern age.

<HEAD>Congressman Fighting $180,000 Tax Bill Tries To Cut IRS Jobs</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A congressman who's fighting the Internal
Revenue Service in court over $180,000 in contested taxes, fines
and penalties fought the IRS in the U.S. House of Representatives
on Friday. He lost.
   Rep. James Traficant, D-Ohio, tried to cut funding for 100 new
IRS agents.
   ``The American people are upset,'' he argued on the House floor.
   ``The need for revenue cannot be deceived nor denied. But I say
here today that the need for justice is more compelling than the
need for revenue,'' Traficant said.
   His amendment to cut $3 million from a $5.6 billion
appropriation failed on a vote of 398-12, extending Traficant's
losing streak against the IRS.
   Before he was elected to Congress, Traficant successfully fought
a felony bribe case in which the government failed to prove that he
kept money from alleged organized crime figures.
   But based on evidence introduced in the 1983 criminal trial and
a signed statement Traficant gave the FBI, the IRS found that he
owed back taxes.
   U.S. Tax Court Judge John B. Williams Jr. ruled in the
government's favor.
   He concluded that Traficant owed back taxes of $59,278 and
penalties of $29,636. More penalties and interest accumulated
during Traficant's appeal, and his bill now totals an estimated
$180,000 _ roughly double his congressional salary.
   Earlier this week the congressman's lawyers argued his appeal of
that ruling to a three-judge panel of the 6th U.S. Circuit Court
Appeals in Cincinnati. The judges did not indicate when they might
rule.
   The case dates back to 1980, when Traficant was a candidate for
sheriff of Mahoning County, Ohio.
   He was accused of accepting bribes during the campaign from
organized crime figures. In the statement to the FBI, Traficant
admitted he took money with the understanding that if elected he
would not interfere with certain criminal activities.
   But Traficant said he gave the money back and signed the
statement under duress. A U.S. District Court jury cleared him of
the criminal charges.
   Traficant won that 1980 campaign and four years later was
elected to Congress. He's been re-elected twice.

<TEXT>
   The Communist Party met Friday and debated
the government's responsibility for the nation's collapsing economy
and the party's dismal performance against Solidarity in the June
elections.
   Party chief Wojciech Jaruzelski opened the two-day meeting, but
party sources said he was likely to resign before the end of the
session, attended by the 230-member Central Committee and the 173
party deputies of the Parliament.
   Jaruzelski was elected president by the National Assembly July
19 and had said he would resign the party post he has held since
1981 if he won the presidency.
   Party spokesman Jan Bisztyga said at a news conference that
personnel matters will be taken up Saturday.
   Before the meeting, newspapers were filled with debate over the
idea of dissolving the party and forming new factions of the left,
or whether to fight to keep the party together.
   Politburo member Janusz Reykowski told reporters Friday: ``The
course of today's debate gives no justification to the opinion that
the party is breaking into factions. There is an idea of respect
for pluralism within the party.''
   The first day's discussion was marked by sharp criticism of the
party's performance in June elections, when the Solidarity trade
union won 260 of the 261 seats it contested, and of the
government's handling of the economy.
   In a surprise development, Politburo member Wladyslaw Baka quit
his post as party secretary in charge of the economy.
   Bisztyga said Baka resigned because he disagrees with the
government's inflation policy.
   Baka has been considered a likely candidate to succeed former
Prime Minister Mieczyslaw F. Rakowski, who handed in his
government's resignation when the new parliament was seated last
month.
   Rakowski in turn is angling to succeed Jaruzelski in the top
party post.
   Baka could be shedding his party duties in preparation for
heading the government, or his resignation could be a sign Rakowski
has locked up the party post and Baka is being shoved aside.
   Baka accused Rakowski's government of lacking necessary
``stubbornness and consistency'' in its handling of the economy.
   Deputy Prime Minister Ireneusz Sekula, also considered a leading
candidate for prime minister, later rose to defend the government's
performance. ``The government was criticized for doing too much and
too little,'' he said. ``The assessments could be different when
emotions calm down.''
   Inflation is in triple digits, and basic foods such as bread and
meat are in short supply.
   Baka and Rakowski have disagreed over government plans to
sharply raise food prices Aug. 1. Baka agrees that increases are
necessary but that steps should first be taken to ensure proper
supplies and to assist people on fixed incomes.
   Politburo member Janusz Reykowski presented a report on the June
election, saying the party was unprepared for competitive balloting
and had not anticipated how much the Roman Catholic Church would
rally parishioners to support Solidarity.
   The PAP news agency said the report expressed hope the elections
will have a ``curative effect on the party'' and spur it to change.
   Chief party ideologist Marian Orzechowski, who also is
considered a possible successor to Jaruzelski, said the party must
change ``quickly and thoroughly.''
   ``Most of society has had enough of the party as it has been.
Secondly, a significant part of the party grass roots has had
enough of the style and ways of functioning of the party
leadership,'' PAP quoted him as saying.
   Jaruzelski challenged fellow Communists to decide what ``we
stand for.''
   He also said the next full congress of the 2 million-member
party ``should be set soon.'' The last was in 1986.
   Party sources said a congress could be called as early as this
fall, but Bisztyga said no date would be set during the meeting.
   ``The prevailing opinion is that the congress should be held as
soon as possible, as long as there is good preparation,'' he said.
   Besides Rakowski and Orzechowski, Interior Minister Gen. Czeslaw
Kiszczak is considered a possible successor to Jaruzelski.
   In addition to Baka and Sekula, Roman Malinowski, leader of the
Communist-allied Peasant Party, is a likely candidate for prime
minister. Malinowski would be the first non-communist head of
government in the East bloc since World War II.
   Jaruzelski as president must nominate the prime minister, who
then must be approved by Parliament. Parliament is scheduled to
meet Monday.
   Rakowski, despite the worsening of the economy during his nine
months as prime minister, was believed to be gathering support for
the party chief's post from hard-liners and party members fearful
of Solidarity's growing influence.
   Rakowski is disliked by Solidarity for his antagonism toward the
union during the martial-law crackdown of 1981 and for his decision
last year to close the Lenin Shipyard, where Solidarity was founded
nine years ago.

   One of China's leading dissidents, now in the
United States, was fired from his post in a youth organization, the
official news ageny Xinhua said Friday.
   Political scientist Yan Jiaqi, was expelled from the All-China
Youth Federation and its standing committee, but there are no
reports of dismissal from his job as a researcher in the Chinese
Academy of Social Sciences.
   Xinhua said the youth federation voted to remove Yan because he
``acted as a plotter behind the scenes during the recent Beijing
turmoil.''
   The federation includes the Communist Youth League, which
strives to promote patriotism and Communist ideology.
   Yan, 47, participated in the seven-week, pro-democracy student
movement that was crushed by the army June 3-4. He helped draft an
essay criticizing senior leader Deng Xiaoping.
   He helped organize an unofficial ``Federation of Intellectual
Circles'' and was named president of the symbolic Democracy
University set up by the students who occupied Tiananmen Square.
   Police have issued an arrest warrant for Yan, but he fled with
his wife, Gao Gao, to Paris via Hong Kong. They are in Chicago this
week to attend the first Chinese Students Congress in the United
States.
   Several dissidents have been dismissed from minor posts in
recent weeks.
   Scientist Fang Lizhi, who has taken refuge in the U.S. Embassy,
was removed from all posts on the China Natural Dialectics Research
Society last week but officials at the Beijing Observatory, where
he works, said they had no orders to fire him.

   Gunmen attacked a group of American
tourists viewing wildlife in southern Kenya and killed a woman,
wounded a man and robbed others of money, a source said Friday.
   The attack Thursday, the second on tourists in Kenya this month,
took place as 19 tourists were riding in three vans along the
40-mile road between the Amboseli and Tsavo national parks, the
source said.
   A woman was killed instantly when shot through the head by two
men with AK-47 assault rifles, and a man was shot in the chest,
according to the report.
   In Washington, State Department spokeswoman Frances Jones said
Marie Esther Ferraro, age unknown, of New Haven, Conn., was shot
and killed and another American was slightly wounded. She did not
give the wounded person's name.
   The gunmen apparently ambushed the tourists along a bad stretch
of road that forced them to slow down, said the source, who spoke
on condition of anonymity.
   The trip was organized by the Connecticut Audubon Society and
had 19 participants _ 18 from Connecticut and one from Georgia,
said Lauren Brown, a society spokeswoman in Fairfield, Conn. She
would not identify the victims but said both were from Connecticut.
   The two-week tour began July 17, she said.
   Police Commissioner Philip Kilonzo and Richard Leakey, director
of wildlife, went to the scene to investigate.
   It was the latest in a series of attacks on tourists that began
in September when a Dutch tourist was shot in the chest in Meru
National Park.
   Also in September, the remains of a British woman were found in
sprawling Masai Mara Game Reserve in southwestern Kenya. An inquest
begins Aug. 7 into her death, which her father says was murder.
Police have said she could have fallen prey to wild animals.
   In the first week of July, two French tourists were shot to
death in Meru National Park, east of Mount Kenya, by poachers.
Leakey had called it an isolated incident, and said he did not
think the poachers were ``looking for tourists to shoot.''
   In April, three West German tourists were wounded by gunmen who
ambushed their vehicles in about the same spot between Tsavo and
Amboseli.
   Two Americans remain hospitalized after being beaten up last
week while on a horseback riding safari in Masai Mara. The U.S.
Embassy refused to release any details about the two.
   Maintaining the security of Kenya's parks and tourist locations
is vital to the East Africa nation, which says it has had nearly 3
million tourists since 1984. Tourism last year brought in nearly
$350 million and has become Kenya's top foreign exchange earner.
   After the French couple was killed, the government said it
stepped up security to make sure the national parks and game
reserves were ``peaceful and comfortable havens'' for tourists and
to ensure the survival of wildlife.
   Kenya has suffered increased poaching activity in which armed
bandits seeking valuable ivory tusks have been stalking and killing
elephants, primarily in Tsavo National Park.
   Since Leakey became director of wildlife in March, Kenya has
stepped up its anti-poaching efforts. Since January, game rangers
have killed more than 20 poachers.

<TEXT>
   The Energy Department on Friday asked the
Nuclear Regulatory Commission to require an environmental impact
statement and conduct a full-fledged hearing before deciding on the
proposed dismantling of the Shoreham nuclear power plant in New
York.
   Energy Secretary James Watkins, who has expressed strong
opposition to the dismantling of the plant, said in a letter to the
commission that closing it for good would be ``a colossal mistake''
and increase the threat of power shortages in the Northeast.
   Watkins also asked the commission to halt removal of the uranium
fuel from the reactor, now under way, and to block plans to reduce
the plant's work force.
   The Long Island Lighting Co. has agreed with the state of New
York to turn the $5.5 billion plant over to the Long Island Power
Authority for $1 so that it can be dismantled. In exchange for
yielding the plant, the company has received assurances of rate
increases, expected to be about 5 percent annually, for the next 10
years.
   Utility shareholders approved the plan June 28 and a New York
state judge upheld the plan earlier this week.
   State and local officials contend that a workable evacuation
plan cannot be drawn up for the area around the new plant, which
though completed in 1985 and licensed in 1988 has yet to produce
electricity commercially.
   The 813-megawatt plant is about 50 miles east of New York City
on the northern shore of Long Island.
   Watkins said in his letter to Kenneth Carr, chairman of the
commission, that dismantling Shoreham ``would be contrary to every
principle associated with the establishment and maintenance of a
sensible national energy policy.''
   Under federal law, the commission must approve the transfer of
the company's license to operate a nuclear power plant to the Long
Island Power Authority. The commission then must approve and
oversee decommissioning.
   Watkins said the permanent shutdown of the plant would require
greater use of fossil fuels, resulting in environmental damage
because of increased emissions that contribute to global warming
and other environmental problems.
   Therefore, the energy secretary argued, the commission should
conduct a full hearing and require a formal environmental impact
statement before making a decision.
   Frank Ingram, a spokesman for the commission, said Carr and
other commissioners have yet to review the letter. He said the
agency would have no immediate comment.

   President Bush said Friday he supports his
embattled Justice Department appointee William Lucas ``100
percent,'' and charged Lucas' opponents are playing politics with
the nomination.
   ``I strongly support Bill Lucas,'' Bush said at an impromptu
news conference. ``I am convinced that much _ not all _ that much
of the criticism of him is pure American politics.''
   Criticism of Lucas stemmed from the Michigan lawyer's decision
to switch from the Democratic Party to the Republican Party, Bush
said. ``Then people piled on to a fare-thee-well,'' he said.
   Lucas, who Bush has tapped to head the Justice Department's
civil rights division, has yet to be confirmed by the Senate.
   The Senate Judiciary Committee on Thursday postponed for a week
the vote after Sen. Howell Heflin, D-Ala., asked for more time to
study what he said was new information about Lucas. Heflin appears
to hold a key vote on the panel.
   Heflin said he wanted to look into a contempt of court citation
filed against Lucas over jail conditions when he was Wayne County,
Mich., sheriff. Additionally, Heflin said he was interested in
Lucas' problems gaining admission to the bar, as well as a finding
by the U.S. Customs Service that Lucas failed to report $4,000 in
jewelry on returning from a trip to Asia.
   Lucas' critics say he is unqualified for the job and is not a
strong enough civil rights advocate.
   But Bush said he is lobbying for Lucas' confirmation by making
telephone calls. The president said he told Lucas on Thursday
night, ``I'm staying with you 100 percent and it's going to be
right there and solid.''

   The Communist Party on Friday shut down two
state-owned conglomerates, including one linked to senior leader
Deng Xiaoping's son, and ordered an end to many of the special
privileges enjoyed by high officials.
   Imported luxury cars, special supplies of food, pleasure trips
abroad and rounds of banqueting all must come to an end, the party
Politburo ordered in its most serious attack yet on endemic
corruption that has cost the party much popular support.
   If carried out, the Politburo order would affect officials at
the uppermost levels of the party and government, who have been
exempt from anti-corruption and austerity drives.
   The Politburo's notice was read on television at the end of a
two-day closed meeting in Zhongnanhai, the party compound where top
leaders maintain homes of relative luxury. Zhongnanhai once was
part of the imperial palace, and its red walls have become a symbol
to ordinary Chinese of the privileges of those in power.
   The Politburo order clearly was triggered by the student
democracy movement that was crushed in June, which drew hundreds of
thousands of supporters with the slogan, ``Oppose corruption.''
   The students also lampooned children of senior officials who
enjoy top posts in government and business, including Deng's son,
whom they nicknamed ``Prince Pufang.''
   The Politburo ordered two companies directly under the State
Council, or cabinet, be shut down, including the Kang Hua
Development Corp., which is linked to Deng Pufang.
   Kang Hua was formed under the auspices of Deng Pufang's China
Welfare Fund for the Handicapped, and it allegedly used the
connection to evade taxes while developing into one of China's
largest foreign trade companies.
   The party also shut down the China Industry and Commerce
Economic Development Corp. and ordered two leading investment
companies to merge.
   It gave the spouses and children of senior government and party
officials until Sept. 1 to resign from jobs in ``commercial
business and trading companies.''
   The Politburo notice also:
   _ Ordered a shake-up of state companies dealing in foreign
trade, material supplies and finance. Trade officials already have
said they plan to sharply reduce the number of companies authorized
to conduct foreign trade.
   _ Banned party Politburo, party Secretariat and State Council
personnel from driving imported cars and exchanging banquets and
gifts paid for with state funds.
   _ Said ministers and provincial leaders may travel abroad only
on business relevant to their posts, and cannot accept invitations
from foreign businessmen. Offers of trips abroad have become
popular bribes.
   _ Ordered an end to special food supplies for high officials
``who shall have the same ration and pay the same price as ordinary
citizens.''
   _ Ordered severe punishment for corruption.
   As early as the 1960s, the public image of China's Communist
leaders had changed from that of spartan revolutionaries to a
pampered elite. But it took the economic decentralization of the
past decade to add bribery and black marketeering to the list of
official privileges.
   Since ending the student protests and purging party General
Secretary Zhao Ziyang, the party has blamed him for its corruption
problem, although he was party chief for only two years.
   A Chinese student who helped lead the pro-democracy
demonstrations in Beijing told a conference in Chicago that a
``goddess of democracy'' statue will be raised again in Tiananmen
Square.
   ``Some say China has no hope for democracy, but I say the hope
is just beginning,'' said Wu'er Kaixi, 21, speaking in Chicago at
the opening session of a weekend congress of Chinese students in
the United States.
   ``I believe the Chinese can be united and will erect a goddess
of democracy in Tiananmen Square one day,'' he said. A statue made
of plaster and resembling the Statue of Liberty was placed in the
square by the demonstrating students but it was torn apart when the
military moved in June 3-4.
   Wu'er fled during the crackdown and managed to escape to Paris.
More than 300 people attended Friday's session at the University of
Illinois-Chicago.
   Wu'er, speaking in Chinese, said, ``If the present communist
government is so confident that people love them, why should they
be scared of elections?
   ``Because there is a chance they (the leaders) may end up in
history's wastebasket.''

   Prime Minister Hun Sen of Cambodia and resistance
leader Prince Norodom Sihanouk said Friday they expect positive
results from an international conference aimed at finding a
solution to the Cambodian conflict.
   The conference of nearly 20 nations opens Sunday in Paris.
   Speaking at a news conference, Hun Sen reiterated his hope that
while negotiations over Cambodia's internal problems were ``totally
bogged down,'' the conference could provide some solutions to other
problems.
   He was referring to the withdrawal of Vietnamese troops and the
assurance that foreign aid to the warring factions will be halted.
   Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze also indicated
optimism when he arrived Friday for the conference.
   ``If there were no hope for peace I wouldn't be here,'' he said.
   Secretary of State James A Baker III was expected to arrive
Saturday.
   In an interview on Radio Monte Carlo, Sihanouk predicted ``there
will be results,'' but he refused to be more specific.
   The four Cambodian factions, comprised of Hun Sen's government
and a three-party resistance coalition headed by Sihanouk,
confirmed their participation in the conference by reaching a
compromise Thursday on how they will be represented.
   The factions will sit under a Cambodian banner but with separate
plaques identifying each of the four groups.
   Hun Sen had demanded two separate delegations _ his own and
another representing the resistance. Sihanouk wanted one
``unified'' delegation.
   Hun Sen also said it was his hope that the four factions could
reopen internal talks during the monthlong international conference.
   Talks between the four factions broke off Tuesday after only
four hours in a dispute over the role of the Khmer Rouge, the
resistance group with the strongest guerrilla force.
   The Khmer Rouge was responsible for the deaths of hundreds of
thousands of Cambodians while it was in power from mid-1975 to
December 1978. Vietnam toppled the Khmer Rouge when it invaded
Cambodia in 1978. It has promised to withdraw its troops by the end
of September.
   Sihanouk is demanding a four-party interim government in
Cambodia that includes Hun Sen and the Khmer Rouge. Hun Sen opposes
the Khmer Rouge having a role.
   Khmer Rouge leader Khieu Samphan said in an interview on French
television that Vietnamese expansion was the real danger to
Cambodia and it would be conterproductive for the conference to
discuss atrocities during the Khmer Rouge rule.
   ``Everyone is free to judge,'' he said, but to discuss the Khmer
Rouge actions ``is to fall into the Vietnamese trap.''

<TEXT>
   Attorney General Dick Thornburgh's spokesman
spent an hour and a half in front of a federal grand jury Friday.
   The spokesman, David Runkel, was called into the grand jury room
by Justice Department attorney Dana D. Biehl, who is spearheading a
probe of leaks to the news media about a federal investigation into
office hiring practices of House Whip William Gray, D-Pa.
   Earlier, reporters watched in a courthouse hallway as Runkel
turned in a grand jury subpoena to a U.S. marshal.
   Thornburgh's spokesman declined all inquiries after his grand
jury appearance. Biehl also refused to answer questions.
   Gray and other congressmen have contended that the leaks this
spring were a politically motivated attack timed to scuttle Gray's
chances of being elected whip, the third-ranking position in the
House.
   On May 31, Gray asked Thornburgh to appoint an independent
counsel to investigate ``illegal and unconscionable'' news leaks
indicating that Gray was under FBI scrutiny.
   Thornburgh declined to appoint an independent counsel but said
he had ordered ``a full investigation of the apparent unauthorized
disclosure of information in this matter.'' The attorney general
said he would dismiss anyone caught leaking material about criminal
investigations.
   FBI agents have interviewed several advisers to Thornburgh and
asked them whether they have been aware of leaks in the Gray case.
   Gray told reporters he was interviewed by FBI agents in
Philadelphia over the Memorial Day weekend, but was told he was not
the target of an investigation. He denied having a no-show employee
on his staff.
   Gray told Thornburgh in a letter that the leaks ``erode
confidence in due process in your agency.''

<DATELINE>TRIPOLI, Libya (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Libya's civil aviation director said
Friday the instrument landing system at Tripoli airport was not
working when a Korean Air DC-10 crashed short of the fog-shrouded
runway, killing at least 77 people.
   The system gives the pilot an automatic indication of the center
of the runway, but it had not worked for several months, said the
official, Mohamed Abughres.
   The DC-10 crashed Thursday at least a half-mile short of the
runway. Most of those killed were South Koreans returning from
vacation to jobs on engineering or construction projects.
   There were conflicting reports on the number killed. Libyan
officials said 78 people on the plane were killed. The airline in
Seoul said 71 of the 199 people aboard were presumed dead, while
the South Korean Embassy in Tripoli said 72 people on the jet died.
   Six others were killed on the ground when the airliner
cartwheeled into several houses and falling wreckage struck a car,
officials said.
   Abughres said the airport radar, radio beacons and other
navigation aids all were working perfectly when pilot Kim Ho-jung
decided to try landing.
   Libya's minister of transport, Mobarak Shamak, said he had named
a Libyan-Korean committee to find the causes of the accident.
   ``We gave the pilot all the information about the fog,'' he
said. ``The last report we gave him was that visibility was down to
50 meters (150 feet), but he decided to land anyway. He trusted his
own instruments.''
   Shamak said a Soviet Aeroflot plane and a Libyan plane that
approached the airport shortly before the Korean Air crash decided
to fly instead to Malta and Benghazi, Libya, he said.
   When Shamak visited the pilot in the hospital and presented him
with roses, Kim burst into tears. He told the minister he was not
at fault. Earlier, another Libyan investigator quoted Kim as saying
he may have been wrong to try to land in the fog.
   Shamak said he believed the accident was caused by either a
technical fault in the DC-10 or a miscalculation by the captain.
   Korean Air President Cho Chung-kun defended the pilot and
indicated the control tower was at fault.
   ``In view of the pilot's long, outstanding professional
experience and the plane's good maintenance records and condition,
it is unlikely that the accident was the result of a human error or
mechanical malfunction,'' he told reporters and relatives of the
victims in Seoul.
   ``We, therefore, believe that the pilot suddenly confronted an
unexpected situation beyond his control as he attempted to land in
a thick fog,'' he said.
   He did not elaborate but airline officials indicated privately
that the plane had not received proper guidance from air
controllers.
   Korean Air and South Korean government officials ruled out
terrorism but expressed concern about reports that the DC-10, built
by the McDonnell Douglas Corp., might have had a structural problem.
   Thomas Downey, a McDonnell Douglas spokesman at the Douglas
Aircraft headquarters in Long Beach, Calif., said the aircraft was
first delivered to Air Siam on Nov. 18, 1974, and was sold to the
Korean airline Feb. 5, 1977.
   As of December 1988, it had flown 39,628 hours and completed
10,926 cycles, the count of times the fuselage has been
pressurized, he said.
   The crash was the second of a DC-10 in eight days. A United Air
Lines DC-10 went down July 19 in Sioux City, Iowa, killing 111
people. Preliminary reports indicate the tail engine blew apart,
damaging the hydraulic system needed to control the jet.
   Downey said there was ``no indication that the circumstances of
the Tripoli and Sioux City accidents are related, nor that they
relate to previous DC-10 accidents.''
   Shamak visited the 84 people who remained hospitalized and
presented each with two flowers. All but three were expected to be
discharged shortly, said Mohamad Haras, director of Salahadding
Hospital.
   South Korean officials flew to Tripoli on Friday to supervise
care for the injured and the return of the bodies.
   Libya's leader, Col. Moammar Gadhafi, expressed his ``heartfelt
condolences'' to South Korean President Roh Tae-woo, the official
Libyan news agency JANA said.
   Flight 803 originated in Seoul and had stopped in Bangkok,
Thailand, and Jiddah, Saudi Arabia. Korean Air said 10 foreigners
were on the plane _ seven with Arab names and three Japanese. One
Japanese died but a further breakdown was unavailable.
   In Seoul on Friday, about 100 relatives of crash victims marched
in protest for two hours on a road leading to Seoul's Kimpo
International Airport. Some carried signs calling airline officials
``murderers.'' Others demanded they be allowed to fly to Libya to
view the site of the crash.

<HEAD>Brothers' Attorney Says IRS Lawyers Dragging Out Trial</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JENNIFER DIXON</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A U.S. Tax Court judge admonished Internal
Revenue Service attorneys for wasting time questioning the Hunt
brothers Friday in their $300 million tax dispute trial.
   ``This witness has been completely unresponsive. You haven't
gotten a nickel's worth of evidence out of him,'' Judge Jules G.
Korner III told government attorney Deborah Butler, who had been
questioning Lamar Hunt.
   An hour into her examination of Hunt, the owner of the Kansas
City Chiefs football team, Korner gave Ms. Butler 10 minutes to
finish her questioning.
   ``You've spent a pound of time and gotten less than an ounce of
information. You'll conclude your examination of the witness in the
next 10 minutes,'' Korner said, declaring the questions a waste of
time under a federal court rule.
   After the proceedings ended, Ms. Butler said: ``If he can't
remember the facts, why was that a waste of time?''
   Hunt, subpoenaed to the stand by the IRS, repeatedly said he
could not recall specifics of conversations or documents leading up
to a partnership formed to repay the three brothers' debts of up to
$2 billion after the silver price collapse of March 1980.
   The brothers are contesting more than $300 million in 1982 taxes
the IRS says are owed from the dissolution of the partnership with
their family's Placid Oil Co.
   Ms. Butler contended Lamar Hunt had guaranteed a $1.1 billion
loan to Placid from a consortium of banks, even though he claimed
on the stand he could not remember many specifics of the agreement.
   Placid contributed $824 million of the loan to the partnership,
while the brothers contributed silver, gold stocks, and North
Dakota coal properties.
   Earlier Friday, Korner told IRS attorney Rebecca Wolfe she was
``wandering all over the lot'' in questioning William Herbert Hunt
on what the judge said was ``amply established'' in the record.
   The non-jury trial was recessed until Aug 21. The government has
almost 70 witnesses on its list to testify when the trial resumes.
   Michael Henke, attorney for Herbert and Nelson Bunker Hunt,
accused IRS attorneys of treating the wealthy Texans to a
``filibuster'' since the beginning of the trial three weeks ago.
   ``Deborah Butler has successfully filibustered the three weeks
alloted for this trial,'' Henke told a reporter.
   Ms. Butler rejected accusations of delay, saying, ``No one would
have been happer to finish (by Friday) than us.''
   Bunker is contesting $155 million in 1982 taxes, while Herbert
is contesting more than $158 million and Lamar is contesting
$505,377 in taxes.

   A Canadian Airlines DC-10 landed safely at
Pearson International Airport Friday after it lost a wheel on
takeoff in Brazil, airport officials said. None of the 254 people
on board was injured.
   Airport spokesman Bruce Reid said the flight crew was aware of
the problem and the aircraft circled the control tower to confirm
the wheel was missing. He said fire crews and ambulances were
dispatched before the pilot was allowed to land at 7:30 a.m. EDT.
   ``We wanted to be prepared in the event that something went
wrong,'' Reid said.
   Canadian Airline spokesman Mike Dukelow said the missing wheel
was not critical to the landing, but that passengers were told to
assume the crash position as the jetliner came down. ``I'm sure
there was apprehension,'' he said.
   It was the latest in a series of recent incidents involving the
DC-10, including two crashes in the past nine days that killed at
least 188 people.
   Dukelow said that when the plane took off from Rio de Janeiro,
Brazil, the flight crew reported what they thought was a blown
tire, but pieces of metal on the tarmac indicated otherwise.
   The DC-10 has 10 wheels _ four on each wing and two on the nose.
Dukelow said the wheel that fell off was on the left wing. He said
company and federal officials were investigating.
   The International Airline Passengers Association said Thursday
it wants the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration to order DC-10s
out of use. The FAA and McDonnell Douglas Corp., which manufactures
the jets, rejected the demand.
   On Thursday, a Korean Air DC-10 crashed in thick fog near the
airport in Tripoli, Libya, killing at least 77 people. The crash
was under investigation.
   On July 19, a United Airlines DC-10 crashed in Sioux City, Iowa,
killing 111 people. That crash occurred when a tail engine blew
apart and cut off the flow of hydraulic fluid needed to control the
jet.
   A United Airlines DC-10 with 240 people on board experienced
hydraulic problems on Thursday night but landed safely at Los
Angeles International Airport, aviation officials said.
   On Tuesday, a Continental Airlines DC-9 made a rough landing at
Newark, N.J., also after experiencing hydraulic trouble. The plane
blew four of six tires and skidded about 7,500 feet before
stopping. None of the 89 passengers was injured.
   On Thursday night, a Piedmont Boeing 727 landed at Newark after
developing hydraulic problems, but a backup system made it a smooth
landing, officials and passengers said. There were 138 passengers
and seven crew members on board.

   A line of heavy thunderstorms crossed New England on Friday, and
showers and thunderstorms also were scattered from the Rockies to
the Appalachians.
   Showers and thunderstorms were scattered ahead of a cold front
pushing across New England with hail, gusty wind and heavy rain.
During the afternoon, the storms extended from Pennsylvania across
eastern New York, Massachusetts and southern Vermont into Maine.
   Wind caused minor damage to a house near Gorham, Maine, and
downed trees in Franklin County, Mass. During the morning, the
thunderstorms had produced strong, gusty wind that downed trees
south of Cooperstown, N.Y.
   Wind gusts over 58 mph were reported at Greenfield, Mass.
   A few showers and thunderstorms spread across North Dakota into
northwestern Minnesota.
   Showers and thunderstorms also developed over the middle
Mississippi Valley into the southern Plains and the central Gulf
Coast states.
   Scattered showers and thunderstorms developed from eastern
Wyoming through Colorado into the southern Rockies.
   Elsewhere, showers were scattered across the central
Appalachians.
   Temperatures around the nation at 3 p.m. EDT ranged from 55
degrees at Arcata, Calif., to 99 at Needles, Calif. Friday's low in
the Lower 48 states was 29 at Truckee, Calif.
   For Saturday, scattered afternoon and evening showers and
thunderstorms were forecast from the upper Mississippi Valley
through the middle and lower Mississippi Valley, the Tennessee
Valley and the Gulf Coast states to the southern Atlantic Coast.
Scattered showers and thunderstorms also were forecast over the
northern and central Rockies.
   Highs in the 70s were predicted along the central Pacific Coast,
the Pacific Northwest, parts of northern Arizona, and from the
Great Lakes into the upper Ohio Valley and much of New England;
between 100 and 110 from the central California valleys into the
desert Southwest; and in the 80s or 90s across much of the rest of

   PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti (AP) _ Police on Friday prevented
nationalist militants from staging a demonstration to mark the 74th
anniversary of the U.S. invasion of Haiti, an organizer said.
   ``At the last minute the police forced us to change our route,
cordoned off the area and scared away potential demonstrators,''
said Francois Pierre-Louis, a leader of the leftist National
Popular Assembly, as he sat in a pickup truck equipped with a
loudspeaker.
   Several dozen militants stood around for about an hour before
dispersing.
   They had planned to begin the march on a seafront boulevard near
the compound for the U.S. Agency for International Development,
where a detachment of about 20 presidential guardsmen was posted on
Friday.
   ``We relocated them for security reasons,'' said Maj. Renaud
Sainbert, who led the unit. ``No one is preventing the
demonstration.''
   He did not say where the militants would be allowed to
demonstrate. The government had issued the group a permit limiting
the demonstration to a few downtown streets.
   After a long period of chaos, U.S. Marines invaded Haiti in 1915
and left in 1934. Between 10,000 and 18,000 Haitians who fought the
occupation were killed by the Marines between 1915 and 1922,
according to prominent Haitian historian Roger Gaillard.
   The Marines created a 4,000-man Garde d'Haiti, which evolved
into the 6,000-man army that now rules the impoverished Caribbean
island.
   ``Today we must recall what this invasion means to the
consciousness of our so-called sovereign people,'' Jean Dominique,
owner of the private station Radio Haiti Inter, said in an
editorial broadcast Friday.
   Haiti's biggest union, the Autonomous Central of Haitian
Workers, backed the demonstration.

<HEAD>Bush Warns Against Spy Leaks as Leakers Say Bloch Spied For 14 Years</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: CORRECTS spelling of ``Sattler'' in 12th graf: ``In the,''</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MICHAEL J. SNIFFEN</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   President Bush expressed concern Friday that
news leaks may jeopardize the espionage investigation of U.S.
diplomat Felix S. Bloch, who investigators now believe began spying
14 years ago while serving in East Berlin.
   Like the FBI and Justice Department, Bush declined to provide
any facts about the Bloch investigation, which was leaked to the
public a week ago.
   ``I don't want to go into it while it is under investigation,''
Bush told reporters at a White House news conference. ``I am very
concerned about premature discussion and disclosure _ that means
leaks _ on this matter, because I think you can jeopardize the case
itself and perhaps the man's ability to get a fair hearing.''
   No charges have been filed against the 54-year-old diplomat, but
the State Department revoked his diplomatic passport and put him on
paid leave June 22. Under heavy FBI surveillance, he has been
visiting relatives in New York since last Saturday.
   Last Friday, State confirmed news leaks that the FBI is
investigating Bloch for possible ``illegal activities'' involving
``agents of a foreign intelligence service.''
   Since then, government sources, demanding anonymity, have said
he was videotaped passing a briefcase to a Soviet agent in Paris
recently and that the same Soviet agent was monitored telephoning
Bloch with what appeared to be a warning he was under investigation.
   A congressional source told The Associated Press the FBI
currently believes Bloch was recruited as a spy while he was
serving at the U.S. Embassy in East Berlin 14 years ago. The New
York Times reported Friday that Bloch admitted to the FBI he spied
for the Soviets ``for many years'' and that they ``paid me a lot of
money.''
   Government sources have said Bloch, who now has a lawyer, has
refused to cooperate with the FBI since a brief interview June 22.
   In 1974, Bloch became economic counselor in the newly opened
U.S. Embassy in East Berlin. He served there for two years after
transferring from West Berlin where he was economic-commerical and
trade promotion officer in the U.S. mission from 1970 to 1974.
   The 1970s were the heyday of Markus Wolf, 66, the very
successful head of East Germany's foreign intelligence operations
for 29 years until he retired in 1987. Wolf's agents worked
hand-in-glove with the Soviet KGB spy agency, U.S. officials have
said.
   In 1974, Willy Brandt resigned as chancellor of West Germany
after one of his closest aides was unmasked as a hand-picked spy
for Wolf.
   In the early 1970s Wolf's agents also recruited an American
student, James Frederick Sattler, who returned to Washington to
work for the Atlantic Council, a prestigious, private foreign
policy study group. Satler was unmasked as a spy in 1976 when he
was about to get a job on the House Foreign Affairs Committee.
Because he had not yet passed any secrets, U.S. officials could not
charge him with espionage, but they used a little-known spy
registration law to force him to register publicly with the State
Department as having East German spy training.
   Former CIA official George Carver said, ``Wolf makes (British
author) John le Carre's (fictional Soviet spymaster) Karla look
like a rank amateur.'' Carver said Wolf used every trap in the
book, including sex.
   In Austria, where Bloch served from 1980 to 1987 as economic
counselor and then as the No. 2 official in the U.S. Embassy,
Interior Minister Franz Loeschnak confirmed news reports that Bloch
had a ``friendship'' with a Viennese woman over a period of several
years. Austrian officials earlier described her as a callgirl.
   The woman returned from a vacation in Egypt and was questioned
by Austrian authorities this week, Austria's top police official,
Robert Danzinger, said, but this yielded no evidence she suspected
anything about Bloch.
   Danzinger said Friday that a suspected KGB agent who may have
been a contact man for Bloch traveled to Vienna several times in
the past 10 years on false Finnish papers.
   Danzinger said Austrian authorities were told by U.S. officials
on June 23 about a suspected KGB agent who allegedly had contacts
with Bloch.
   ``We assume he worked for the KGB,'' Danzinger said. ``We have
no information of our own that he is KGB. That information came
solely from Washington.''
   For the second day in a row, a top Soviet official denied any
links with Bloch. ``He had no connection with us, no link that
could raise the slightest suspicion,'' Soviet Foreign Minister
Eduard Shevardnadze told reporters at Orly airport in Paris.
   Several administration sources have suggested that any
admissions made by Bloch to the FBI or State Department security
officers fell well short of the legal requirements of a confession.
   The New York Times said the FBI had received information that
prompted interest in a recent trip Bloch was making to Europe and
planned a surveillance operation.
   The agency notified foreign intelligence services and
congressional committees, and somehow the information got out, the
paper said. As previously reported, U.S. eavesdropping picked up a
Soviet agent telling Bloch, ``A bad virus is going around and we
believe you are now infected.''
   The FBI also got permission to search his home but found nothing
incriminating, the paper said.

<HEAD>Blacks Who Seek Treatment at White Hospitals Face Jail Terms</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID CRARY</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Blacks who seek treatment at
whites-only hospitals in a mass defiance campaign may be imprisoned
for two years, authorities said Friday.
   In the tiny black homeland of Venda, thousands students
boycotted classes to protest what they say is a coverup by
officials investigating recent killings.
   Adriaan Vlok, the law and order minister, contends the effort to
seek treatment at white hospitals will include acts of violence
intended to disrupt segregated national elections scheduled for
Sept. 6.
   A militant black labor federation accused Vlok on Friday of
deliberately misrepresenting the plans for peaceful acts of
defiance before the election.
   In the first phase of the defiance campaign, to begin Wednesday,
anti-apartheid groups have asked blacks and people of mixed race to
seek medical treatment at eight whites-only hospitals.
   Authorities in Transvaal province, where four of the hospitals
are located, issued a directive saying no one could enter public
hospitals without official authorization. A violator can be
imprisoned for up to two years and fined $740.
   ``Of prime importance is the interest of our patients,'' said
Andre Cornelissen, a provincial administrator. ``I would therefore
make an urgent appeal to persons not to be a part of this defiance
campaign, which will exacerbate the fate of defenseless, sick
persons.''
   The Congress of South African Trade Unions, the largest
organization involved, issued a statement denying Vlok's allegation
that the plans called for firebomb attacks on homes of election
candidates and other acts of violence. The congress said it was
considering legal action against Vlok.
   ``We want to state openly and categorically that the minister is
lying,'' it said. ``The arrogance of the minister and his
government is such that they seem to think they can make any
allegations they like and get away with it.''
   In a speech Thursday, Vlok said the call for ``militant mass
action'' was tantamount to a call for violence.
   Protests in Venda have prompted the homeland legislature to
consider a state of emergency, clouding preparations for
festivities in September marking the 10th anniversary of the
homeland's ``independence'' from South Africa.
   At the University of Venda, classes for 4,000 students have been
halted since Wednesday. Boycotts began earlier at some primary and
secondary schools.
   Venda is in the northeast corner of South Africa and has about
500,000 residents. It is one of four tribal homelands designated as
independent by South Africa but not recognized abroad.
   According to reports in two anti-apartheid newspapers, the
protests were inspired in part by three unsolved killings in the
past two weeks, believed by residents to be ritual murders.
   In South Africa, ritual murders are killings in which parts of
the victims' bodies are cut off and used in potions.
   Last year, police in Venda confirmed several ritual murders and
denied charges of a coverup aimed at protecting tribal chiefs and
government officials accused of involvement. The killings last year
prompted a general strike and the justice minister was dismissed.

   The contracts of athletic officials at
state universities here must be open to public inspection, a
Superior Court judge said Friday in a ruling that limits what can
be shielded in personnel files.
   The ruling came in a lawsuit filed March 30 by The Associated
Press against five schools.
   ``Information of this kind which is related to the conduct of
public business and to the expenditure of public funds is required
to be disclosed,'' said Wake County Superior Judge E. Lynn Johnson.
   Contracts were sought to examine employment conditions of
coaches and athletic directors at Division I schools in basketball
and football. But the institutions said the contracts cannot be
made public because they are contained in personnel files.
   The lawsuit was filed against Western Carolina University, East
Carolina University, the University of North Carolina at
Wilmington, the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill and
North Carolina State University.
   Two schools, University of North Carolina at Asheville and
Appalachian State University, complied with the request for
contract information.
   ``We feel it is important that the conditions of employment for
these state officials be open to taxpayer scrutiny,'' said Ambrose
D. Dudley, chief of bureau for AP operations in North Carolina.
``The judge agreed.''
   State Deputy Attorney General Andrew A. Vanore Jr., who
represented the schools, was out of town and not available for
comment. A spokesman for the attorney general's office said a
decision hadn't been made on whether to appeal.

<HEAD>Soviet Defense Minister Says NATO Should Not Update Lance Missile</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   If NATO modernizes its Lance missile, Moscow may
resume production of medium-range SS-23 nuclear missiles banned
under a superpower treaty, the Soviet defense minister said Friday.
   Dmitri Yazov, addressing London's Royal Institute of
International Affairs, said a proposal to replace the Lance with a
longer-range version violated the 1987 Intermediate-range Nuclear
Forces treaty.
   He was winding up a four-day official visit, the first by a
Soviet defense minister to a NATO country since World War II.
   ``Why should we continue liquidating our Okas if NATO will not
renounce the modernization of Lance?'' said Yazov, referring to the
missile by a Soviet name.
   Under the treaty, all Soviet and U.S. land-based missile with
ranges of between 300 and 3,000 miles must be eliminated by 1991.
   Yazov said later that if ``the Americans begin to build Lances
with a range up to 500 kilometers (300 miles), we will be forced to
again make this Oka.''
   He said the Soviet Union believed the United States ``does not
have the right to build such a missile.''
   In Washington, a Bush administration official said SS-23s are
clearly covered by the INF treaty and that Lance missiles are not.
``It would be absurd for the Soviets to suggest that while we're in
compliance with the accord, they would have reason to violate it,''
the official said, speaking on condition of anonymity.
   NATO, at a summit meeting in May, deferred a decision on
modernizing the Lance missiles. A proposal calls for tripling the
range of the current missiles, to just under 300 miles.

<HEAD>Newspaper Prints Prostitute's Story of Sex in Australian Embassy</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A prostitute has told a newspaper she was paid
$800 for having sex with three men at an Australian Embassy party
while working for an escort service now under federal investigation.
   The unidentified woman's account, published in Friday's editions
of The Washington Times, drew a lengthy denial from Australian
Ambassador Michael Cook, who questioned her credibility and
reputation.
   Cook, in a letter to the newspaper's editor, said ``weeks of
careful investigation have entirely failed to substantiate'' the
woman's story.
   ``We cannot disprove your story, simply because no one can ever
prove a negative,'' Cook wrote.
   The Times reported that the woman worked for an escort service
that is now under federal investigation for credit-card fraud.
   Cook said the story was ``unfortunately bare of hard facts'' and
relied on sketchy information from ``one woman of uncertain
reputation.''
   Wesley Pruden, the newspaper's managing editor, defended the
story and noted it had also appeared in an Australian newspaper and
was aired on television in that country.
   ``We've been reporting this story for several weeks,'' Pruden
said. ``We are very confident that we got it right and when the
ambassador completes his own investigation I think he will see that
we were right.''
   The embassy's investigation was continuing and spokesman Brett
Bayly said Australian diplomatic officials here ``have been in
touch with American authorities.'' Bayly declined to specify what
U.S. agencies had been contacted.
   Cook noted in his letter that top embassy officals worked with
Times reporters and ``investigated the matter thoroughly'' after
they were contacted by the newspaper several weeks ago.
   ``For the story to be true would have required those involved
knowingly to have run extraordinary risks of being surprised,''
Cook said. ``If the party was supposed to have taken place during
the week, plenty of poeple would still have been working in the
embassy.''
   The newspaper said the woman, whom it did not identify, also
told of paid sexual encounters with with a Canadian diplomat and a
U.S. soldier who had worked as a bodyguard to Washington lobbyist
and host Craig J. Spence.
   Spence has been previously identified by the Times as a client
of a homosexual prostitution ring linked to the escort service for
which the prostitute said she worked.
   The U.S. attorney's office is investigating credit-card fraud
involving the escort services, according to sources, who have spoke
on condition of anonymity.
   The newspaper quoted the woman as saying that she and two other
prostitutes each had sexual relations with at least three men at
the embassy. The woman said she was paid $800 in ``crisp, new $100
bills'' after the party.
   The newspaper said the woman provided a detailed description of
the embassy party. She said the men ``took me one at a time'' into
a room ``which was like an office, it had office-type furniture.''
   She said the men did not identify themselves.
   Cook said that the woman's ``descriptions of the embassy's
interior geography and its furnishings simply do not fit the
facts.''
   He also said that her ``descriptions of the men are so vague as
to be useless in identifying who in the embassy might have been
involved.''
   Cook said that ``the source even appeared uncertain that the men
alleged to have been in the incident were Australians.''

<HEAD>Police Act on Petition for Reform Signed By 11,500</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PRAGUE, Czechoslovakia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Six dissidents whose homes were
searched by police are being investigated for sedition in
connection with a petition for democratic reform signed by more
than 11,500 people, authorities said Friday.
   If charged and convicted, they could be sent to jail for five
years.
   Activist Petr Uhl said late Thursday that police searched the
six homes and confiscated documents. He said the targets appeared
to be Obroda, a new reform group, and the petition for liberalism
in Czechoslovakia, among the strictest of Eastern Europe's
communist states.
   By the middle of this week, more than 11,500 people had signed
the petition, which began circulating last month, Uhl said.
   The official news agency CTK said in a terse report that
Thursday's searches in Prague, central Bohemia and south Moravia
were carried out with a warrant from the Prague city prosecutor and
focused on the homes of those ``suspected of elaborating,
circulating and organizing actions of signatures of this appeal.''
   ``Further investigation concentrates on determination of the
responsibility of concrete persons,'' it said.
   Uhl said those whose homes were searched included Jan Urban, a
Charter 77 signatory who accompanied a visiting delegation from the
Polish union Solidarity to meetings with former Communist Party
leader Alexander Dubcek and with activists in Prague and Bratislava.
   Others, also of the Charter 77 dissident group, were former
spokespersons Libuse Silhanova, Stanislav Devaty and Milos Hajek,
current spokesman Sascha Vondra and Vladimir Kolmestr.
   Hajek told The Associated Press in Vienna by telephone the
documents police seized at his home included a draft of a letter to
Communist Party members and a draft for a declaration on the
anniversary Aug. 21 the 1968 Soviet invasion that ended Dubcek's
``Prague spring'' of reforms.
   About 10,000 people marched through Prague on the anniversary
last year.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Bush administration, hoping to increase
U.S. influence in Southeast Asia, will play a prominent role in a
conference opening this weekend in Paris on Cambodia's future.
   Secretary of State James A. Baker III, symbolizing U.S. interest
in a settlement of the 10-year war in the hapless country, will
represent Washington in a 20-nation conference that almost broke up
before it began.
   Baker will meet on the side Saturday with Soviet Foreign
Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze, possibly laying the foundation for
a superpower summit meeting later this year.
   The secretary left Washington Friday afternoon for Paris.
   Disarray among four Cambodian factions threatens to cause a
breakdown at any point in the month-long conference, which will
have its ceremonial opening Sunday. Baker and Assistant Secretary
of State Richard Solomon, who will head the U.S. delegation after
Baker goes home Monday, are hoping that an agreement can be worked
out that preserves Cambodia's independence.
   A 10-year civil war between the forces of pro-Vietnam Prime
Minister Hun Sen and three guerrilla factions widened the
destruction of what remained of the Cambodian civilization after
the murderous rule of Pol Pot from 1975 to 1978. Before that, the
United States, in the Indochina war, contributed to the devastation
of the country.
   Currently, the United States is providing $3 million to $5
million a year in training and non-lethal supplies to the factions
headed by Prince Norodom Sihanouk and Son Sann, while China is
arming the Pol Pot forces.
   The U.S. goal is a transitional government that does not return
Pol Pot's group to power _ it is suspected of murdering more than 1
million Cambodians _ nor leaves Hun Sen in charge after Vietnamese
troops pull out in late September.
   Frederick Z. Brown, a former State Department official who has
written a new book, ``Second Chance,'' about Cambodia, said at a
news conference Friday that the United States could be a major
player in Paris.
   ``A lot of people are looking to us because our involvement has
been relatively aloof,'' Brown said.
   He agreed with the stance taken by the Bush administration,
though, that the Cambodian parties themselves must arrive at a
solution for their country.
   Referring to the Indochina war, Brown said this was not the
occasion for ``a new crusade'' by the United States, which warred
with North Vietnam and bombed Cambodia. But, he said, the United
States now has ``a second chance'' to help in the country's
rehabilitation and to improve its standing in the region.

<HEAD>PLO Attitude Toward Elections Remains Unchanged</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TUNIS, Tunisia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An independent Palestinian state remains
the PLO's major condition for agreeing to elections in the
Israeli-occupied territories, Ahmed Abdel-Rahman said Friday.
   Abdel-Rahman, spokesman for the Palestine Liberation
Organization, said in a telephone interview that reports that the
PLO has softened its position on elections were ``fabricated by the
Israeli leadership.''
   ``The PLO position is that we are for elections but in the
context of a comprehensive settlement,'' he said. Such a settlement
would specify that the final result of negotiations would be a
Palestinian state, he added.
   Comments by a Soviet official and Palestinians who met with
Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir had indicated the PLO might
have changed its stand.
   Abdel-Rahman said the comments did not represent the PLO's
position toward elections.
   Shamir has proposed elections in which the 1.7 million
Palestinians in the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip would choose
representatives to negotiate an interim self-rule plan. Talks would
be held later on the final status of the territories.
   But Shamir has said the PLO conditions are not acceptable and he
would not deal with the PLO, which Israel considers a terrorist
group, even it the PLO abandoned those conditions.
   Israeli Labor Party legislators have said a U.S. document
reflected a softer PLO position. An Israeli official, speaking on
condition of anonymity, said Wednesday the document was relayed to
Israel by Soviet Middle East envoy Gennady Terrasov. The official
said Terrasov met an aide to Vice Premier Shimon Peres after
holding talks earlier with PLO chairman Yasser Arafat.
   In Washington, State Department spokeswoman Margaret Tutweiler
denied that such a memorandum existed.
   Abdel-Rahman said Terrasov met with Arafat and then with an aid
to Peres but insisted Terrasov only relayed the established PLO
conditions for accepting elections.
   He said Israeli leaders were behind the reports of a softened
PLO stance ``so they can say to the Americans that the PLO is
coming to their position.... Mr. Shamir is trying to win time.''
   A PLO leader, commenting on the reports of Palestinians meeting
with Shamir, said, ``The PLO did not authorize any Palestinian
inside the occupied territories to negotiate with the Israeli
government.''
   Salah Khalaf made the statement in an interview with the Kuwaiti
newspaper Al-Watan.
   Khalaf is the No. 2 man in Arafat's Fatah, the leading
Palestinian group in the PLO.
   He denied reports that four Palestinians from the occupied
territories met with Shamir on instructions from the PLO.
   Al-Watan, in a dispatch from Tunis where the PLO is
headquartered, quoted Khalaf as saying the PLO leadership ``did not
ask the four Palestinians who met the Israeli prime minister
recently to do so.''
   He said the PLO ``is against allowing any party outside the
legitimate institutions ... the power to open talks with the
Israelis under any circumstances.''
   Khalaf also denied the he had agreed during a recent meeting
with Robert Pelletreau, the U.S.ambassador to to Tunisia, that the
four Palestinians meet with Shamir.
   ``Such a topic was not raised during the meetings with
Pelletreau,'' he said.
   Pelletreau opened a dialogue with the PLO leadership after the
United States dropped its opposition to dealing with the PLO when
the organization renounced terrorism and recognized the state of
Israel in a statement last November.
   In an interview with the Bahrain-based Gulf News Agency, one of
the Palestinians who met with Shamir said details of the meeting
``reached the PLO leadership in Tunis via different channels.''
   Jamal Al-Tarifi, a pro-PLO lawyer, was intervewied by telephone
in London. He did not say he had received PLO clearance for the
meeting but told the agency, ``No meeting or initiative from any
Palestinian figure can succeed if it does not have the approval of
the PLO leadership.''

   Moscow's deputy mayor said Friday he
hopes to learn something from American methods of finance and
budgeting during a tour of U.S. cities, and has already found some
pleasant surprises _ like Boston Harbor.
   ``They told us there was a necessity to clean the harbor, but we
found that it was much cleaner and fresher than we were told,''
Valery A. Zsharov said after a George Bush-style inspection
tour.The harbor became a political issue during last year's
presidential campaign.
   Zsharov and his interpreter, Albert S. Gasparian, head of the
protocol unit for Moscow's Foreign Relations Department, said they
hope to learn how to deal with some of the problems of
decentralization in Soviet cities under Soviet leader Mikhail
Gorbachev's policy of perestroika.
   ``The cities have some of the good things in common, and some
problems in common, too,'' said Valery A. Zsharov. But he said the
economic approaches to solving the problems in his city will be
``quite different'' from that in U.S. cities.
   Zsharov arrived in Providence last week. He and his interpreter
and two other colleagues will leave Providence on Aug. 7 and will
travel to New York, Los Angeles and Atlanta before returning to the
Soviet Union.
   Their trip was sponsored by Brown University's A. Alfred Taubman
Center for Public Policy and American Institutions at the school's
Center for Foreign Policy Development.
   The visitors were taken to Boston for two days to meet with
present and former elected officials on the state, local and
federal levels, along with the heads of various state agencies,
developers and builders.
   As a result of legislation designed to decentralize bureaucracy
in the Soviet Union, the Moscow Soviet, or City Council, is trying
to improve its abilities in budgeting and finance and in boosting
economic development.
   The city has some 2 million employees, handling functions
usually carried out by private enterprises in the United States.
   As deputy mayor, Zsharov directs Moscow's main department of
trade, restaurants and consumer services, and coordinates joint
ventures for the city. He also has a strong voice in how the city's
4-billion-ruble budget is spent.
   Zsharov, 53, said that while there are similarities between
Boston and Moscow, there are strong differences such as employment.
   ``In Boston there is unemployment and we need labor. We have a
very high labor shortage,'' he said, chain-smoking Russian
cigarettes. ``The shortage creates some difficulties.''
   ``Moscow's problems are very open and clear,'' he said. ``The
most acute are housing and transportation. ... Much of our housing
was destroyed in World War II. It's much more acute than in the
U.S.''
   Zsharov was most impressed with the construction and building
industry in the United States.
   ``Up to now, we cannot boast that level of construction,''
Zsharov said. He said Moscow is working on a long-term program
through the year 2000 in an attempt to build enough apartments to
house everyone in the city.
   At Brown, the Soviets are studying how local, state and federal
governments in the United States make up budgets, distribute money
and interact with one another. They also will tackle problems like
environmental damage and urban revitalization.

   A man diagnosed as carrying the AIDS
virus was charged Friday with attempting to poison a police officer
by biting him, according to news reports.
   Agence France-Presse quoted a prosecutor as saying Philippe
Bouille, 29, bit a policeman on the finger when the officer tried
to arrest him for drunkenness in the village of Saint-Louis near
Mulhouse early Thursday.
   The prosecutor, who was not identified, said the bite was so
severe the officer's hand bled and Bouille shouted, ``I have AIDS

   ``This is the first time in France that a magistrate has decided
to bring criminal charges in this type of affair,'' AFP quoted the
prosecutor as saying.
   The report did not say if the policeman had requested or been
given a test for acquired immune deficiency syndrome. The fatal
disease is caused by a virus that damages the body's immune system,
leaving victims susceptible to infections and cancer.

<TEXT>
   A man who spent 13 years in prison for the
killing of a police officer was freed Friday after an appeals court
upheld a federal judge's ruling that crucial evidence had been
suppressed by prosecutors.
   ``I feel great,'' said V. James Landano as he left the federal
courthouse. ``Right now, I just want to get away.''
   Judge Leonard I. Garth, of the 3rd U.S. District Circuit Court
of Appeals, on Friday denied the state's appeal to overturn the
decision of a federal judge who reversed Landano's conviction on
Thursday.
   U.S. District Judge H. Lee Sarokin vacated Landano's conviction,
ruling that prosecutors covered up evidence casting doubt on
eyewitness identifications of Landano as the man who shot dead a
Newark policeman during a 1976 robbery.
   Sarokin said the prosecution showed a ``pattern of failures'' in
turning over exculpatory evidence.
   Sarokin was the judge who last year freed Rubin ``Hurricane''
Carter, a boxer serving life for a triple murder, on grounds that
Carter's conviction was tainted by racism and suppressed evidence.
   Garth set Tuesday as the deadline for prosecutors to appeal
Landano's release.
   ``The state does plan to continue with its appeal,'' said
Christopher Florentz, a spokesman for the state Attorney General's
office. ``We're going to do it as quickly as possible.''
   Landano, sentenced to life in prison, has maintained he was
framed by motorcycle gang members protecting the real killer _ his
childhood friend.
   Landano and three others were charged in the killing of 23-year
veteran Officer John Snow at the robbery of a check-cashing
establishment in Kearny. Landano was convicted as the gunman.
Victor Forni was later convicted of planning the crime for the
Breed motorcycle gang and served nine months of a two-year sentence.
   When Landano supporters compiled evidence pointing to his
innocence, Sarokin last month ordered investigative files seized,
and from them, Landano's lawyers found the papers on which the
judge based Thursday's decision.
   One was a Kearny police interview report with a witness at a
warehouse near the crime scene, who identified a picture of Forni
as the getaway car driver. The driver had been identified as the
gunman. The report was never given to Landano and the picture never
found.
   Sarokin also cited a handwritten document from Kearny police
files saying that the only eyewitness of the shooting had said of
Landano, ``hair not right _ suspect had curly hair.'' Notes on
another witness said the same thing.
   Newark police officials decried the judge's decision, saying
Landano should have been kept in custody until the crime was
resolved.
   ``To have him walk out of jail without being retried or the
triggerman who killed Officer Snow being located would be a great
injustice,'' said Newark Police Chief John Golba.
   The Newark lodge of the Fraternal Order of Police, the
bargaining agent for about 1,000 Newark policemen, said it opposed
freeing Landano and would protest the decision if Landano did not
get a retrial.
   Bail was set at $50,000, but Landano, a New York City resident,
was released on his own recognizance into the custody of his
attorney, Neil Mullin. It was not clear Friday if Landano would
face another trial. State Deputy Attorney General Carol Henderson
said the state would appeal Thursday's decision on the grounds that
the federal courts did not have the right to intervene in the case.
Ms. Henderson said Landano did not exhaust all his options under
the state court system.

   A mental patient released on an
eight-hour pass fatally stabbed a 9-year-old girl at a street fair
as her mother and horrified bystanders watched, police said.
   Two police officers and a passerby pulled the man off the girl,
but not before he had repeatedly stabbed her in the head and chest,
police said.
   Jessica Short of Wallingford was pronounced dead at Middlesex
Memorial Hospital in Middletown, in central Connecticut, a hospital
spokesman said.
   David Peterson, 37, a patient at Connecticut Valley Hospital, a
state mental hospital in Middletown, was charged with murder in
what police Chief George R. Aylward called a ``random act of
violence.''
   Peterson was ordered confined at the hospital for 15 years in
May 1988 after being found innocent by reason of insanity on
assault and burglary charges, said Martha Lewis, executive director
of the state Psychiatric Security Review Board.
   Lewis was unsure of his exact diagnosis, but said ``he suffers
from a major mental illness.''
   Aylward said he was told by the hospital that Peterson was free
on an eight-hour pass Friday.
   Hospital Superintendent Carl Cappello referred all questions to
Lewis, who said the hospital didn't have the authority to issue
Peterson a pass to leave the hospital grounds.
   The stabbing took place at about 2:15 p.m., on Main Street,
which was closed for an annual sidewalk sale and street fair.
   A woman who saw the attack said the girl had just come out of an
F.W. Woolworth Co. store, and apparently was walking toward her
mother.
   ``Everybody started screaming,'' said a witness who asked would
not give her name. ``Nobody was helping her.''

<HEAD>Garcia Calls for Death Penalty for Terrorists</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ANDREW SCOTT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LIMA, Peru (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Alan Garcia, in his final
state-of-the-nation address, urged Congress Friday to adopt the
death penalty for acts of terrorism.
   He also told Congress that a system of military courts should be
established to try suspected terrorists.
   Peru now has the death penalty only in cases involving treason
during time of war. Garcia did not elaborate on proposed military
courts to try cases involving terrorism. Those cases now are tried
in civil courts.
   Garcia also said that presidential elections will be held next
April as specified by law.
   Some members of his center-left Aprista party had called for
early elections because of the possibility of runoff balloting if
no candidate wins a majority of the vote. The law sets the date for
the presidential balloting to be on the second Sunday of the
election year and Garcia said the election would be on April 8,
1990.
   He said he would name a bipartisan congressional commission to
``guarantee an absolutely clean election.''
   Garcia is barred by the constitution from running for a second
term and the winner is to be installed on July 28. It is expected
there will be three major candidates representing Aprista, the
center-right Democratic Front alliance and a coalition of leftist
parties.
   Deputies wanting the presidential election to be held early said
that if a runoff is required the winner might not be determined in
time for the installation. A runoff election between the top two
vote getters would be held within 30 days after the first election.
Some deputies noted that in the last presidential election in 1985
it took more than two months for ballots from outlying areas to
arrive and be counted in Lima.
   Garcia, referring to attacks by guerrillas of the Maoist Shining
Path and pro-Cuban Tupac Amaru Revolutionary Movement, said ``the
armed forces are the greatest guarantee for our democracy against
subversion.''
   His address, on television and radio, could not be seen or heard
by many Peruvians because of a power failure. The blackout in
sections of Lima and other areas was caused by rebel bombings
Wednesday of substations in the power network near Huancayo, 140
miles east of Lima.
   Garcia spoke of disappointments during the first four years of
his 5-year term.
   ``After four years I can make a confession,'' he said. ``I
wanted to do more, to move the country along very quickly, change
the structure of economic power.
   ``But this is difficult to do, sometimes impossible, when you
use as your instrument a centralized, bureaucratic state made to
serve the big powers.''
   When he took office in 1985 Garcia said Peru would no longer
deal with the International Monetary Fund, which he called an
instrument of imperialism. He also announced Peru would limit
payments on its foreign debt to 10 percent of its foreign exchange.
   Money diverted from the debt service was used to finance jobs
programs, raise the minimum wage and subsidize imports.
   Public opinion polls showed that during his first year in office
Garcia's popularity soared to 90 percent. But surveys indicate it
has dropped to about 10 pecent now as the economy faltered and fell
with deficit spending, crippling inflation and labor strikes.
   In 1988 Peru's gross national product decreased by nearly 9
percent and inflation registered 1,780 percent.
   The foreign debt of $16.5 billion more than double's the nations
gross national product of $30 billion.

   A chemical fire in a tank car finally
burned itself out six days after the derailment of a CSX
Transportation Inc. train, but about 200 residents remained
evacuated Friday.
   ``It was a lazy fire at times. We had introduced air ... through
an intake valve to intensify the burn'' and speed it up, CSX
spokesman R. Lindsay Leckie said.
   Emergency crews pumped about 2,000 gallons of chlorosilene out
of the tank car while the chemical, a liquid used in silicon
production, continued burning, he said.
   About 200 people living near the derailment site were asked to
remain evacuated at least through Friday night, Leckie said. They
will be allowed to return home after two other tank cars loaded
with flammable chemicals _ both intact _ could be removed from the
site, he said.
   Fourteen cars, seven loaded and seven unloaded, derailed just
before noon July 22, sparking fires that sent up huge plumes of
thick black smoke and initially forcing the evacuation of about
3,000 people within a 15-square-mile area.
   The accident cost CSX at least $1.5 million in damage to
equipment and other costs, Leckie said. The railroad, headquartered
in Baltimore and Jacksonville, Fla., is the nation's largest in
terms of revenue _ about $4.5 billion yearly.

<DATELINE>HARARE, Zimbabwe (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Former President Jimmy Carter said
Friday he is confident peace talks between the Ethiopian government
and Eritrean rebels can bring an end to the civil war.
   Carter came to Zimbabwe from Ethiopia and said Ethiopian
President Mengistu Haile Mariam's Marxist government and the
Eritrean People's Liberation Front have agreed to set up
negotiating committees to discuss their differences.
   The front has been fighting for 28 years for autonomy in the
northern province of Eritrea.
   ``I think there is a better prospect now to end ... war than
there has ever been since the war began,'' Carter told reporters in
Harare.
   He said more than a million people have been killed in the
warfare.
   ``Both sides are now willing to try and bring about a resolution
of the conflict through direct talks,'' Carter said. ``We have been
doing everything we can to orchestrate direct talks between
President Mengistu and the Eritrean liberation forces.''
   He said Mengistu accepted an offer by the Atlanta-based Carter
Center to help bring the warring sides to the negotiating table.
   ``Any specific announcements will have to come from the parties
in the conflict,'' he said.
   Carter said that during the July 24-26 summit of the
Organization of Africn Unity in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, he met with
Sudanese military leader Lt. Gen. Omar Hassan El-Bashir and
discussed possible peace talks to end Sudan's 6-year-old civil war.
   ``I was encouraged by his commitment to the peace process,''
Carter said.
   He also said experts in mediation and arbitration supported by
the Carter Center were in contact with the rebels' Sudan People's
Liberation Army.
   ``We have been and will remain in touch with the leaders of both
sides,'' he added.
   Most of the rebels in southern Sudan are Christians or animists
and accuse the Moslem majority that controls the country of
discrimination.
   Carter announced earlier in Harare the establishement of a
non-government aid program called Project Africa to assist African
nations in agricultural development.
   He said the program will deal primarily with food security
strategies and ways of providing low-cost basic tecnology for
African farmers.
   Carter is to leave Harare Saturday and visit Zambia, Nigeria and
Ghana before returning to the United States.

<HEAD>Mexican Police Officer Arraigned in Torture-Murder of Drug Agent</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Mexican police officer was arraigned Friday
in the 1985 torture-murder of U.S. drug agent Enrique Camarena.
   Juan Jose Bernabe-Ramirez, described as a police officer from
the western state of Jalisco, was arrested Thursday in Los Angeles
as he was about to return to Mexico, according to a U.S. Drug
Enforcement Administration affidavit.
   The affidavit alleges that Bernabe told two undercover DEA
agents he was present when reputed Mexican drug lord Rafael
Caro-Quintero tortured Camarena. Last year, a jury in the United
States convicted three men of the murders, including a former
Mexican police officer, Raul Lopez-Alvarez.
   Assistant U.S. Attorney Jim Walsh said Bernabe, 30, was charged
Friday with the murder of a federal agent. Following a brief
afternoon hearing, U.S. Magistrate Ralph J. Geffen ordered Bernabe
held without bail, Walsh said.
   A preliminary hearing in U.S. District Court has been
tentatively scheduled for Aug. 14, he said.
   Camarena and his pilot, Alfredo Zavala Avelar, were killed after
the narcotics agent led a series of damaging raids on marijuana
plantations allegedly operated by Caro-Quintero, authorities have
said.
   Camarena's body was found March 5, 1985, on a ranch 65 miles
southeast of Guadalajara, the capital of Jalisco.
   Caro-Quintero was indicted by a federal grand jury in the United
States, but authorities never sought his extradition because the
Mexican government promised to prosecute him as a Mexican citizen.
He has been convicted only of drug charges and remains in custody
in Mexico City.

<HEAD>California Fires Force University Evacuation While Idaho Blazes Rage</HEAD>

<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Two California wildfires threatened homes and forced the
evacuation of a university campus Friday, and Idaho's governor
declared a state of extreme emergency because of hundreds of forest
fires there.
   A 6,000-acre wildfire bore down on ranch homes near the central
California city of Atascadero. In the Los Angeles community of
Walnut, a fast-moving fire edged toward several homes and the
nearby California Polytechnical Institute, Pomona campus, officials
said.
   In Idaho, Gov. Cecil Andrus authorized military reinforcements
Friday to join the battle against hundreds of forest fires burning
out of control. His emergency proclamation, which allows the state
to use the National Guard, will last for 30 days or until the fire
danger subsides.
   About 200 Los Angeles County firefighters were battling a
300-acre blaze, but officials could not estimate how soon they
would have it contained, said County Fire Department spokeswoman
Barbara Sapien. Firefighters were assisted by 21 engines and
bulldozers battling the blaze, about 30 miles east of Los Angeles,
the spokeswoman said.
   Campus police decided to evacuate the school as the fire
approached from the south, said Inspector John Tabak, of the Los
Angeles County fire department. It not immediately known how many
people were forced to leave.
   In central California, teams were deployed to water down homes
in the sparsely populated area near Atascadero, said California
Department of Forestry spokeswoman Tish Teely.
   The blaze had destroyed between 15 and 20 outbuildings,
including barns and corrals, Ms. Teely said. Owners evacuated
animals from some ranches, she said.
   ``It's very close to some homes and moving at a good clip,'' Ms.
Teely said.
   About 680 firefighters had the blaze 30 percent contained late
Friday. Teely said full containment was expected Saturday.
   Firefighters in northern Idaho were helped by high humidity that
slowed the flames, while the opposite was true for the Boise
National Forest.
   ``The humidity dropped considerably,'' said Lynette Davis, Boise
forest spokeswoman. ``When the air dried out, the fires got up and
ran.''
   A lightning storm earlier this week covered central Idaho with
500 fires, some limited to just a burning tree. Firefighters
concentrated on the larger blazes, while parachuting smokejumpers
or helicopter-borne crews tackled the small ones.
   The containment of small fires and shuffling of crews Friday
left it difficult to assess total acreage burned or manpower on the
fire lines.

<HEAD>Ruling Party Drops References To Marxism</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MAPUTO, Mozambique (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The ruling Frelimo party presented a
new policy document Friday that drops all references to Marxism,
Leninism and Western imperialism.
   The document, submitted at the party's first national congress
since 1983, says Frelimo, the Front for the Liberation of
Mozambique, remains committed to socialism. But it deletes
references to ``the class struggle'' and says party members should
``express the aspirations of the entire people.''
   The alterations coincide with a new drive by the government to
end a 12-year-old civil war that has devastated the economy and
left millions of Mozambicans dead, displaced or dependent on food
aid.
   President Joaquim Chissano has asked Presidents Robert Mugabe of
Zimbabwe and Daniel arap Moi of Kenya to arrange for preliminary
peace talks with rebels of the Mozambique National Resistance.
   For many years, Mozambican authorities have accused neighboring
South Africa of supporting the rebels, but Chissano said this month
he was prepared to accept assurances that the South African
government no longer sanctioned such aid.
   Frelimo took power in 1975 after a prolonged guerrilla war
against Portuguese colonial rule. Frelimo leaders established a
one-party, Marxist-Leninist state and described themselves in a
1983 policy document as ``the vanguard of the worker-peasant
alliance.''
   The new document describes the party as ``the vanguard of the
Mozambican people'' and deletes a previous reference to
Mozambique's role in a ``world anti-imperialist front.''
   That change reflects Mozambique's improving relations with
Western countries such as the United States, Italy and Britain,
which supply substantial quantities of aid.
   Mozambique's government has maintained its close ties with the
Soviet Union and other East bloc countries. The new policy document
calls for ``an independent foreign policy based on the defense of
national interests.''
   The government for several years has been moving to end central
control of the economy. It has met loan conditions from the
International Monetary Fund and the World Bank and has experienced
modest growth in the past two years after a decade of sharp decline.
   Frelimo also has proposed allowing businessmen, property owners,
shopkeepers and religious believers to join the party after years
of poor relations.
   About 200,000 of Mozambique's 15 million people belong to
Frelimo.

   A jury Friday night found former
Cleveland Mayor Carl B. Stokes innocent of a petty theft charge for
taking a $17.25 bag of dog food from a store without paying.
   The eight-member jury deliberated for about three hours before
returning with the verdict.
   Stokes, now a Cleveland municipal judge, testified in his own
defense Friday that he had always intended to pay for the dog food.
   ``I'm not going to take a bag of anything without paying for
it,'' said Stokes, in his testimony in Shaker Heights Municipal
Court. Three of his children and his brother, Rep. Louis Stokes,
D-Ohio, were in the courtroom.
   After the verdict was read, Stokes rose from his seat in the
courtroom to the cheers of family and friends in the courtroom
gallery. He smiled broadly while accepting handshakes.
   Louis Stokes, who also is Carl Stoke's longtime political ally,
commented: ``I'm happy for my brother. He's been totally
vindicated. He maintained his innocence from the beginning. The
victory tonight reasures my faith in the judicial system.''
   Carl Stokes, 62, said he twice entered a pet store the morning
of June 2 through a rear door and asked two dog groomers about
buying dog food for his Rottweiler, Max. Each time they said the
store's regular employees had not yet arrived for the day, Stokes
testified.
   ``I said, `The hell with it, I'll get a bag of dog food and come
back and pay for it in the afternoon','' Stokes said.
   He said he was in a hurry to drive to downtown Cleveland for
three morning appointments.
   Five hours later, Stokes said, he returned to the store with the
intention of paying for the dog food but sensed hostility from two
regular employees he had known from past shopping trips to the
store.
   ``I really didn't feel safe,'' said Stokes. He concluded that
``they think I stole it.''
   Stokes said he was scared and again left the store without
paying for the dog food because he felt even the appearance of
wrongdoing could hurt his reputation or ruin his career.
   ``With a person like me, it doesn't have to be true for those
things to happen,'' said Stokes, citing television crews in the
courtroom of this Cleveland suburb as evidence of interest in
public officials.
   Asked by defense attorney Gerald Messerman if he could prove
whether he intended to return to pay for the dog food, Stokes said,
``There's no way to prove.'' But he said he had twice asked to buy
some dog food, had said hello to a police officer outside the store
moments later and returned to the store that afternoon.
   If he had been convicted of the first-degree misdemeanor of
petty theft, Stokes would have faced a maximum penalty of six
months in jail and a $1,000 fine.
   Stokes served two terms as Cleveland mayor, from 1967 to 1971,
and chose not to seek a third term.
   He worked as a news reporter for WNBC-TV in New York before
returning to Cleveland in 1980 to become a labor lawyer. He was
elected to the municipal bench in 1983.
   Last December, a hardware store security guard stopped Stokes,
who had a $2.39 screwdriver in his pocket. Stokes said he had
forgotten to pay for it. The store did not pursue shoplifting
charges.

<TEXT>
   The Hearst Corp. told employees of The Los
Angeles Herald Examiner on Friday that it is selling the daily
newspaper, an editor at the paper said.
   ``We got the announcement today,'' said Andrea Herman, the
paper's features editor. ``They have put up the paper for sale and
will evaluate offers from interested parties.''
   The reason for the sale was not publicly announced. But a
statement issued to newspaper employees said the sale stemmed from
``intense pressure'' from the paper's competition in the nation's
second-largest newspaper market.
   ``For a number of years, the Herald Examiner has been in an
extremely challenging situation,'' said the statement by Robert J.
Danzig, vice president and general manager of Herald Newspapers.
   In recent years the Herald Examiner has lost readers to the Los
Angeles Times and the Los Angeles Daily News, as well as growing
suburban papers.
   With a circulation of 238,392 daily and 183,122 on Sunday
editions, the Herald Examiner ranks as the 42nd largest newspaper
in the country, Ms. Herman said.
   Daily circulation peaked at 729,000 in 1967, when the Herald
Examiner was the nation's largest afternoon daily. The Newspaper
Guild launched a 10-year strike that year from which the newspaper
never recovered economically.
   ``We have weighed these considerations carefully and have
reached a conclusion that continuing our ownership of the Herald
Examiner is not compatible with the strategic direction of our
newspaper company,'' Danzig said.
   Hearst, a privately held company, has acknowledged financial
losses at the Herald Examiner but does not disclose specific
figures for the newspaper.
   Despite its financial difficulties, the Herald Examiner has
earned a reputation as a scrappy newspaper with vigorous coverage
of the city.
   The newspaper was the first to delve into the financial dealings
of Mayor Tom Bradley, and its queries into Bradley's ties with a
commercial bank prompted this week's City Council hearings into a
controversial deposit of city funds with the bank.
   Hearst hired the investment banking firm of Lazard Freres &amp; Co.
of New York to handle negotiations for the sale, according to the
announcement given newspaper employees.
   The paper has 760 editorial and administrative employees, Ms.
Herman said.
   John J. McCabe, the Herald Examiner's chief operating executive,
could not be immediately reached for comment. Editor Maxwell
McCrohon was out of town.
   The internal company announcement did not cite possible a
possible sales price or say if there would be any personnel
changes, Ms. Herman said.

<HEAD>Former Premier To Be Investigated In Wiretapping Scandal</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PATRICK QUINN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>ATHENS, Greece (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Parliament on Friday voted to investigate
allegations that former Premier Andreas Papandreou ran an illegal
wiretapping network.
   The 300-member unicameral Parliament voted 170 to 119 in favor
of setting up a 12-member committee to probe the allegations, made
by the center-right New Democracy Party. Five of the 294 deputies
present abstained.
   New Democracy is the dominant party in Greece's
conservative-Communist coalition government. Papandreou is a
Socialist.
   Once the committee is formed it has one month to investigate the
allegations. If it finds that charges can be pressed, a special
high court will convene to try Papandreou.
   Papandreou's Panhellenic Socialist Movement governed Greece for
eight years until it was swept from power in June 18 elections, in
which no party won a majority.
   The Conservatives and the Communist-dominated Coalition of the
Left and Progress agreed to govern together for three months to
clean up Greek politics.
   But in a surprising move, the coalition voted against
investigating three former heads of the Ministry of Transport and
Communication.
   ``The proposal for forming an investigative committee was
accepted for Mr. Papandreou and rejected for the others,'' said
Parliamentary speaker Athanassios Tsaldaris.
   Papandreou, on a honeymoon with his new 35-year-old wife, was
not in Parliament.
   During the often stormy eight-hour debate, New Democracy
deputies charged that Papandreou used facilities provided by
Greece's National Intelligence Service and the state-run Greek
Telecommunications Corporation to eavesdrop President Christos
Sartzetakis, political foes and his own Cabinet ministers.
   ``None of us ever compained about legal wiretaps, but there was
an unprecedented network eavesdropping on politicians, journalists
and even members of their party,'' New Democracy leader Constatine
Mitsotakis said.
   Parliament has ordered a committee to investigate allegations
that Papandreou and other senior ministers were involved in a $210
million fraud, forgery and embezzlement scandal.
   The financial and wiretapping scandals as well as other charges
of official wrongdoing led to Papandreou's electoral defeat.
   Socialist deputies have described the accusations against
Papandreou as ``fabrications'' and claim they are part of a
conspiracy to destroy the party.

   Early tests of a new AIDS drug are so
promising that federal scientists are expressing hope it may become
a powerful new weapon against the epidemic that now numbers 100,000
cases.
   Scientists say they hope to start an expanded second phase of
tests this fall and perhaps have the drug available for wide use
next year.
   Phase I trials, described in a report published today in the
journal Science, showed that the drug, called DDI, controlled the
growth of the AIDS virus and enabled patients to gain weight, feel
better and develop some resistance to infection.
   ``This is not a cure for AIDS,'' said Dr. Robert Yarchoan, a
National Cancer Institute researcher who helped direct the Phase I
trials. ``But it appears to control the disease.''

bloodstreams is confirmed, it should be possible to do the same
kind of genetic tests on those fetal cells as are now done on fetal
tissue samples obtained through amniocentesis. That procedure
involves the withdrawal of some of the fluid surrounding the fetus.
   Making the diagnosis from a blood sample would eliminate the
small risk associated with amniocentesis, the researchers said.
   The method, however, cannot be used to screen for Down's
syndrome and other disorders in which the chromosomes must be
examined under a microscope, because the fetal cells isolated from
the mother's bloodstream do not allow chromosome diagnosis.

   The seaside resort that once looked
to Mayor James L. Usry to end a legacy of corruption has seen him
and 13 others charged in conspiracies that include bribes, illegal
gifts and extortion.
   The City Council president and zoning board chairman also were
among those arrested on corruption charges Thursday after an
eight-month state investigation. A 14th person has not yet been
arrested.
   ``We've been the laughingstock of the country for a long time,''
said Republican Assemblywoman Dolores Cooper, who lost the last
non-partisan mayoral election to Usry. ``This sets us back another

   Usry, president of the National Conference of Black Mayors, was
elected Atlantic City mayor five years ago as a reformist candidate
after his predecessor was implicated in an influence-peddling
scandal and lost a recall election.

   William Lucas, President Bush's embattled
nominee to be the chief civil rights enforcer, is denying a new but
unverified allegation that he once complained about a federal
housing discrimination suit against a predominantly white Detroit
suburb.
   Justice Department spokesman David Runkel said late Thursday
that Lucas, nominated as assistant attorney general for civil
rights, denied urging the government to drop a housing
discrimination suit against the city of Birmingham, Mich.
   The allegation was contained in a letter to the Senate Judiciary
Committee from Michael Sussman, a former Justice Department civil
rights lawyer who now represents black plaintiffs in the landmark
desegregation case against Yonkers, N.Y.
   ``This kind of a last-minute tactic is reprehensible from
somebody who is certainly aware of the system to raise an issue
without any substance at all at this point,'' Runkel said, calling
Sussman ``a disgruntled former employee of the department.''

   Democrats and Republicans are heading for a
showdown on the Senate floor over a compromise landmark savings and
loan bailout bill that would balloon the federal budget deficit.
   A House-Senate conference committee, finishing its work with two
marathon sessions lasting late into the evening, decided Thursday
night to reject Bush's complex plan to exclude $50 billion in
rescue spending from the deficit.
   The agreement sends the legislation to the full House and Senate
for votes next week. However, the Bush administration has raised
objections and senators warned that Republicans could block the
plan in the Senate.
   Nearly six months ago, Bush asked Congress for emergency action
to close or rescue hundreds of failed, but still-operating, savings
institutions.

<HEAD>A Renaissance of Book Publishing in Haiti</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MICHAEL NORTON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti (AP) _ A new freedom of expression in book
publishing has flourished in Haiti in the three years since the
overthrow of Jean-Claude Duvalier as president for life.
   Although impoverished and highly illiterate, this nation of 6
million people now has about 500 locally published book titles
available, including more than 200 so far this year.
   The publication of books has risen even though Haiti has seen
army repression, anti-government demonstrations, massacres and
three coups since the downfall of the Duvalier-family dynasty in
1986.
   Laennec Hurbon, a sociologist and one of Haiti's leading
writers, says Haiti now publishes more books than any other country
in the Caribbean.
   ``There has been an intellectual renaissance,'' he said.
   Haitian authors introduce their new works every week at cultural
centers such as the National Library, the French Institute, La
Pleiade Library and Bato Fou Restaurant.
   During the 29 years of Duvalier rule, freedom of speech and book
publishing were stifled. Magazines and newspapers were not allowed
to print stories on local politics. State censors regularly cut out
articles considered subversive from French and American weekly
magazines before they were displayed on newsstands.
   When Francois ``Papa Doc'' Duvalier, Jean-Claude's father, was
in power from 1957 until his death in 1971, entire rooms of the
main post office in Port-au-Prince were stacked to the ceiling with
books confiscated from the mails.
   Haiti exhibited 300 recently published books at the convention
earlier this year of the Association of Caribbean Research and
Institutional Libraries in Jamaica.
   ``The other exhibitors were absolutely dumbfounded by their
quantity and quality,'' said Ludmilla Joseph, legal-deposit
secretary of the National Library.
   Jamaica, with 22 new books, was the second most abundant
exhibitor, Joseph said.
   Since independence from France in 1804, Haitians have published
some 17,000 titles, the vast majority in French, the language of
the educated elite, according to the National Library.
   Haitian authors say that the country's political uncertainty,
poverty and widespread illiteracy make the publishing boom even
more impressive.
   ``When you take our 75 percent illiteracy rate into account,
Haiti is one of the front-runners of the world,'' said historian
Dr. Georges Michel, who in July autographed his newly published
``History of Haitian Railroads'' during promotional sales at
several Port-au-Prince cultural centers.
   Since Jean-Claude Duvalier was overthrown, Henri Deschamps,
Haiti's major publisher, has issued 150 new books, including a
series of Haitian literary and historical classics, novels, essays
and textbooks.
   The Deschamps catalogue includes 40 titles in Creole, a language
derived from 18th century contact between French-speaking
slaveholders and African slaves, and spoken by all Haitians.
   The Montreal-based, Haitian-run International Center of Haitian
Documentation and Information has published 26 new titles in the
past three years and plans to publish world classics in Creole.
   But book sales are limited in a country with an annual per
capita income of less than $300.
   ``Our market is small and for many of our customers the average
of $10 per book is high,'' said Monique Lafontant, co-owner of the
bookstore La Pleiade.
   ``We authors cannot make a decent living from our writings, in
spite of our hard work,'' said historian Georges Corvington, who
has never sold more than 2,000 copies of any one of the six volumes
of his popular ``Port-au-Prince Through the Ages.''
   Hurbon is the author of five books on Haiti and research
director at the National Center for Scientific Research in Paris.
His most recent title, ``Comprendre Haiti'' (Understanding Haiti)
has sold 4,000 copies.
   Other contemporary Haitian authors include novelist Roger
Dorsainvil and historians Roger Gaillard and Jean Fouchard.
   Two titles to be published later this year are an illustrated,
two-volume history of Haitian art by Philippe Lerebours, director
of the National School of Arts, and a new edition of the
internationally acclaimed ``Thus Speaks the Uncle,'' by the founder
of the Haitian negritude movement, Jean-Price Mars.
   ``Last Christmas we made a cultural breakthrough; for the first
time, our customers bought more Haitian titles than French and
foreign titles combined,'' Lafontant of La Pleiade said.
   Though most Haitians are unable to read their country's
publications, ``the information is filtering down to the
intellectually alert but non-reading masses by word of mouth and
through the radio,'' said Deschamps.
   High school and college students make up the bulk of those who
visit autograph-promotional sales, where authors offer 50 percent
discounts.
   ``I am publishing for the future, for 20 years from now,''
Deschamps said. ``In the long run, the investment in human
resources will pay off.''

<HEAD>Cyprus Divided as Ever 15 Years After Turkish Invasion</HEAD>
<HEAD>An AP Extra</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   On the dun-colored slopes of the Kyrenia
Mountains overlooking this divided capital, Turkish Cypriots have
carved a huge Islamic crescent and a fashioned a huge Turkish
Cypriot flag in stones.
   They're a constant taunt to the Christian Greek Cypriots,
reminding them that one-third of the east Mediterranean island is
still occupied by the Moslem Turks 15 years after they invaded July
20, 1974.
   Not that most Greek Cypriots want to forget or let anyone else
do so. Travellers leaving from Larnaca airport on the south coast
pass roadside posters reading: ``Don't forget the Turkish
invasion.''
   Greek Cypriots believe they hold the moral high ground and by
keeping the division of Cyprus prominent in the international arena
they will be able to end the occupation.
   The Kyrenia range, which looms over the island's central plain,
is in the territory the Turkish Cypriots declared a breakway
republic in 1983.
   Nicosia itself is split by the so-called Green Line, a
112-mile-long buffer zone that snakes across the island.
   It is patrolled by 2,300 United Nations peacekeeping troops who
have been in Cyprus since sectarian bloodletting erupted in 1964.
   Along the line, soldiers of the rival communities' forces face
each other from sandbagged pillboxes in urban alleyways and hilltop
bunkers, sometimes only yards apart.
   On the July 20 anniverary of the invasion, 1,000 Greek Cypriot
women, many of them refugees from the north, stormed through the
buffer zone to occupy a war-ruined, weed-encrusted school and
church.
   Turkish Cypriot riot police stormed the roofless buildings,
beating the women with clubs. One hundred women were arrested and
put on trial, a move that infuriated the Greek Cypriots.
   The protest by women demanding the right to return to their
homes in the Turkish Cypriot sector and the Turkish response
aroused sectarian passions and threatened to wreck U.N.-sponsored
talks on reunifying the island in a bizonal federation.
   The current round of negotiations between President George
Vassiliou, the Greek Cypriot leader, and Turkish Cypriot leader
Rauf Denktash have continued for 10 months with little sign of
progress, despite initial hopes of a breakthrough.
   Denktash wants complete political equality, even though the
Turkish Cypriots form only 17 percent of the population, with the
north's Moslem identity intact.
   The Greek Cypriots want a federal framework, with the 200,000 of
their people who fled the north allowed to return, a move that
would swamp the Turkish Cypriots.
   Denktash, president of the Turkish Cypriot state, has cast
doubts on a federation.
   ``The Greek Cypriot leadership did not contribute to peace by
pushing the women toward our border,'' he said.
   The bottom line is that after the sectarian atrocities of the
past, the 120,000 Turkish Cypriots feel secure with their own
state, even if it is only recognized by Turkey and totally
dependent on the Turkish government economically and militarily.
   Denktash noted in a broadcast on Radio Bayrak, the breakaway
state's radio: ``The Greeks continue to have claims on the north.
But the Turks ... do not intend to be divided again.''
   If 1974 brought the Turkish Cypriots security, it traumatized
the Greek Cypriots.
   More than 2,000 of their people were killed. An additional 1,600
are missing, still unaccounted for.
   One-third of their number are refugees in their own land and
although many have successfully rebuilt their lives and businesses,
the issue remains inflammatory, as the women's protest showed.
   The Turkish army lost 2,000 men killed and the Turkish Cypriots
900 in 1974. Seven hundred others remain missing. Forty thousand
moved north.
   There are 30,000 Turkish regulars with tanks and missiles in the
north. To the Greek Cypriots, that's an intolerable violation of
Cyprus' internationally recognized sovereignty.
   ``Legitimacy is our main counterweight to the Turkish troops in
the north,'' President Vassiliou's adviser, Michael Attalides,
noted recently.
   There are also some 50,000 mainland Turkish settlers in the
north. The Greek Cypriots accuse Turkey of trying to alter the
island's demography.
   The politically powerful settlers are not welcomed by all
Turkish Cypriots either. Many see them as a threat.
   ``If the settler trend continues ... in 10 years the Greek
Cypriots will probably find they're negotiating with mainland
Turks,'' said Ozker Ozgut, leader of the opposition Turkish
Republican Party in the north.
   Many Greek Cypriots prefer to forget that the invasion was
triggered by a short-lived coup by militant supporters of union
with Greece, backed by the right-wing military junta that ruled in
Athens at the time.
   The Turks said they struck to protect the Turkish minority, for
whom union with Greece means total Greek domination.
   In the 15 years since 1974, differences have, if anything,
deepened.
   The Greek Cypriot economy has flourished, despite the loss of 70
percent of the island's agricultural land and the port of Famagusta.
   But the Turkish Cypriots, cold shouldered by the international
community, remain impoverished, dependent on Turkey for survival.
   A generation of young people on both sides of the dividing line
has grown up with no knowledge of the other.
   They are unable to grasp the passions of their elders and are
more prepared to accept the status quo.

   Japhet Isaack fled Namibia in 1978 to
join the SWAPO guerrilla movement and fight South African rule.
   But he said his toughest battle was for his own survival at
SWAPO prison camps in southern Angola, where hundreds of his
countrymen allegedly have been tortured and remain locked in
dungeons run by the guerrillas who accused them of being South
African spies.
   Isaack has worked with other recently released SWAPO detainees
to compile the names of 439 people they believe still are held and
94 more they think have been killed by SWAPO, the South-West Africa
People's Organization. They say the number of detainees could be as
high as 2,000.
   ``These people have been falsely imprisoned and tortured,''
Isaack said in an interview. ``We must not forget about them until
we know they are safe.''
   The lists have dates and locations in Angola where each
individual was last seen. The United Nations says it is
investigating but maintains it has no concrete evidence of
additional detainees.
   ``The population would like to know the whereabouts of 2,000
men,'' U.N. Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar said after a
recent visit to Namibia.
   SWAPO, which has waged a 23-year bush war against South
African-led security forces, is favored to win elections set for
November and form a government when the territory receives
independence early next year on a date still to be decided.
   The organization said it released all 201 of its political
prisoners in April, including Isaack, from a camp in southern
Angola where they were registered by U.N. officials.
   But only 153, including women and children, have returned to
Namibia. Neither the United Nations nor SWAPO has said where the
remaining 48 are.
   Martti Ahtisaari, who heads the U.N. contingent monitoring
Namibia's independence process, declined to say whether the United
Nations has requested permission from the Angolan government or
SWAPO to visit the prison camps.
   The International Committee of the Red Cross says it has
repeatedly sought but never received access to SWAPO camps.
   ``We know there are missing people,'' said Nicolas de Rougemont,
head of the Red Cross operation in Namibia. ``Whether there still
are people in detention, we don't know because we can't verify.''
   SWAPO has acknowledged abuses against detainees, saying it was
engaged in a ``war for survival'' and had to ferret out suspected
South African spies. South African security officials continue to
boast that they have a huge network of agents working inside SWAPO.
   ``We considered (the prisoners) as spies, but not as enemies,''
said Theo-Ben Gurirab, SWAPO's long-time U.N. representative and
now head of its foreign affairs office. ``We recognized they were
brainwashed and we decided to detain them during the course of the
war.''
   More than a dozen ex-prisoners were interviewed by The
Associated Press, and all said they were falsely accused of spying
and that the guerrilla movement never presented evidence to support
the charges.
   ``We have committed no crime against the Namibian revolution and
we pledge to remain faithful to the total liberation of our
people,'' the ex-prisoners said in a joint statement.
   Virtually all the former detainees have long, thick scars
crisscrossing their backs, legs, wrists and ankles.
   Isaack said he was arrested and accused of spying in May 1986,
shortly after he had been named SWAPO's deputy representative to
the United Nations.
   During his time in detention, he said, he was hung upside down
from a tree and beaten unconscious with sticks and electrical
wires. He also was buried in sand with a plastic bag over his face
for minutes at a time, he said.
   Others have told similar stories and said additional forms of
torture included pouring gasoline onto open wounds after hours of
beatings.
   Several female prisoners said they were sexually abused and
beaten while pregnant. After giving birth, they remained imprisoned
and had no access to medical care for themselves or their children,
they said.
   The prisoners also said that during the regular torture sessions
they were threatened with death unless they confessed to being
South African spies.
   They told of living in filthy, overcrowded pits. Most said they
knew many people who suddenly disappeared from the prisons or died
in detention because of the unsanitary conditions and the severity
of the torture.
   Many of the former detainees are young, articulate and educated,
unusual in a territory where more than half the population is
illiterate. Three of the detainees were former members of SWAPO's
Central Committee.
   Ex-detainee Eric Biwa and other former prisoners say they
believe the old guard SWAPO leadership concocted a ``spy bogey'' as
an excuse for cracking down on young challengers who questioned
strategy, particularly the military effort.
   ``SWAPO has been unable to solve its internal differences in the
past,'' said Biwa, who was arrested while studying in Cuba in 1984.
``We will work against a SWAPO election victory because we fear
what they will do if they come to power.''
   SWAPO's Gurirab claims the organization will prosecute people
suspected of torture. SWAPO also has said that thousands of SWAPO
members or supporters were harassed, tortured or detained without
trial by the South African-led security forces.
   But the prisoners held by SWAPO say details about the past
abuses must be made public.
   ``Our hope is that Namibia will never again be ripped asunder by
war,'' the ex-detainees' joint statement said. ``But SWAPO must
release all Namibians unjustifiably called `enemy agents' and must
announce how many people it killed and why.''

   Thousands of refugees are streaming
back to Namibia as independence approaches, but their numbers are
well short of the 80,000 that the SWAPO movement claimed and
received money for during its years in exile.
   The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees has given
SWAPO, the South-West Africa People's Organization, more than $21
million in aid for the 80,000 refugees that guerrilla officials
said they cared for in neighboring Angola, Zambia and Botswana.
   But when SWAPO registered exiles for repatriation earlier this
year, it produced only 41,000 names. U.N. officials accepted this
figure without taking their own count, according to Sylvester
Awuye, deputy director of the U.N. refugee office in Windhoek.
   Fewer than 30,000 of the 41,000 have returned under the U.N.
program, which began in mid-June.
   SWAPO leader Sam Nujoma has said the conflicting refugee figures
are due to large numbers of schoolchildren who are not being
returned because war damage to schools and villages in northern
Namibia would deprive them of classrooms.
   ``In any nation you find that children are in a majority so
those who are registered to return are those ... above the age of
18,'' said Nujoma, who has yet to return to Namibia himself.
``After independence when we build the schools we will take them
along.''
   In addition to the U.N. program, an estimated several thousand
refugees have entered northern Namibia from Angola informally in
recent months. The border is more than 600 miles long and is
unmarked in many parts. Formal entry points are staffed irregularly
and can ususally be crossed with a few polite words to the border
guards.

<DATELINE>CHINLE, Ariz. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Navajos' disdain of community living has
long given fits to an industry whose trademark is poles stretching
to the horizon.
   Where people live close together, the traditional telephone
system works fine, but when they are scattered most companies can't
justify the cost, said Francis Mike, general manager of Navajo
Communications Co. ``Navajos don't live in large clusters. They
live miles apart.''
   For Suzie Randall, that meant a 12-mile trek from her home in
Nazlini to Chinle every two to three weeks for the past 21 years to
call her daughters in Denver and Fort Defiance, followed by a
12-mile return trip.
   The old days and the new now meet at the 79-year-old Mrs.
Randall's one-room house. Sheepskins dry in a shade house out
front. Hugging the back wall, looking like a giant mushroom beside
an inverted carrot, are a satellite dish and transceiver for
Ultraphone, a system that is bringing telephone service to the
Navajos using radio instead of cables, for about one-eighth the
cost.
   International Mobile Machines Corp. of Philadelphia began
working on what would become Ultraphone in 1981. Its first
installation was in September 1986, for Mountain Bell in the
Douglas, Wyo., area.
   Last November, the Federal Communications Commission decided
that the time had come for radio to improve rural phone service,
organized a Basic Exchange Telecommunications Radio Service, and
allocated frequency channels to it.
   Twenty companies or groups are investigating or have installed
Ultraphone from St. Lawrence County, N.Y., to the sparsely
populated Southwest, Mike said. Navajo Communications introduced it
in November on the 25,000-square-mile reservation, a West
Virginia-sized area that is home to 175,000 people.
   Now, demand exceeds supply, he said. Navajos are ``up on
technology. They all have television, and now they'd like phones.
They're coming in here and saying, `We want telephone service now.'
''
   The key to Ultraphone is digital radio technology, using an
encoder to convert voices into the computer, or binary, language
for transmission as a radio signal. Beamed to a tower atop a mesa
nine miles from Chinle, the signal is relayed to destination, where
it is decoded by a transceiver. Users converse over standard
telephones _ the magic is in the means, not the end.
   The signal covers a circle with a radius of 37{ miles, so
customers have the benefit of being able to make a 75-mile local
call. Bills run $15 to $23 per month for basic service, Mike said.
   That presents a unique challenge for Cecil Jones, Navajo
Communications' Chinle service area manager, whose job runs the
gamut from marketing to helping customers make out checks to pay
for the service.
   ``I have to sit down and explain what a telephone bill is,'' he
said. ``It's very educational for us, really something we need to
do as a person. The other thing is to explain to them the
capabilities of the equipment _ the difference between a local call
and long distance.''
   Navajo Communications has invested about $750,000 in the system,
which currently has about 100 customers of 460 possible. Jones
estimated it would cost at least $6 million to run wires into the
same clusters of dwellings.
   The company plans to cover most of the reservation _ most of
northeastern Arizona and parts of Utah and New Mexico _ with
installations in its three other service areas, based in Window
Rock, Tuba City and Shiprock, N.M.
   Ultraphone is the only digital system on the market, said IMM
spokeswoman Marcia Bexley. It offers improved transmission quality
and the ability to time-divide a radio channel to allow four
simultaneous conversations.
   ``The big thing is spectrum efficiency. We make the most out of
the radio spectrum,'' Ms. Bexley said.
   ``It relates to the cost, because in radio, channels are the
cost,'' said IMM regional director Kris Shelton in Denver, who
added that the digital format ensures privacy. ``With a normal
mobile radio, you can sit with a broadcast scanner and listen in;
with digital, all you hear is a hissing sound.''
   But spectrum efficiency, signal splitting and security aren't
the important things to Suzie Randall. ``I really like the service
and it's a communication I have with my kids,'' she said in Navajo,
translated by Jones.
   The only problem, she said, is neighbors who have no phones
turning up with increasing frequency to make calls.

   J.D. ``Mac'' MacGillis' motto, gleaned from a

the hill.''
   It probably won't be that easy, though, when Mac, played by

against a wise-mouthed space alien who lives on a very large hill
called NBC.
   ``Major Dad's'' assignment in the fall is to anchor CBS'
all-comedy Monday-night lineup. It's an uphill battle. A succession
of CBS half-hour comedies have tried and failed to make headway
against NBC's powerhouse puppet ``ALF'' in the 8 o'clock (Eastern)
time period.
   But after a second season in third place, and with a schedule
filled with aging hour dramas or new ones struggling to build an
audience, CBS desperately needs a breakout comedy it can move to
another night.
   The fate of two other new comedies will rely in part on the
popularity of their lead-in. ``Major Dad'' will be followed by a
new offbeat fantasy-comedy, ``The People Next Door.'' Sandwiched
between last season's hit ``Murphy Brown,'' and the proven
``Designing Women'' _ which, incidentally, stars McRaney's new
bride, Delta Burke _ is the other new show, ``The Famous Teddy Z,''
starring teen hearthrob Jon Cryer in a sophisticated comedy from
the creator of ``WKRP in Cincinnati'' and ``Frank's Place.'' The
venerable ``Newhart'' rounds out the night.
   Most of the television critics meeting here had a favorable
reaction to the pilot for ``Major Dad,'' in which the conservative
MacGillis and a liberal reporter for the local newspaper (played by
newcomer Shanna Reed) fall in love at first sight and decide to
marry. He has no experience with children. She has three daughters,
13, 11 and 6.
   In his first visit to their house, 6-year-old Casey (Chelsea
Hertford) peers at him out the window, then runs excitedly to her
mother to announce, ``It's G.I. Joe!'' Elizabeth (Marisa Ryan), 13,
observes over dinner, ``This guy has no hair.''
   ``Major Dad'' is not a show about the military, said executive
producer Earl Pomerantz, who noted, ``I'm a Jewish person from
Canada, and I know nothing about the Marine Corps,'' which he said
he had heretofore thought of not as fodder for comedy, but ``just
guns and sharp things.''
   ``I do `people' shows,'' he told the television critics. ``I
like shows with people in them ... rather than pieces of felt. . ..
That's what we're on against, a piece of felt,'' said Pomerantz,
referring to ``ALF.'' ``It's doing very well.'' ``ALF'' wins its
time period virtually every week.
   Pomerantz created the critically praised but short-lived ``Best
of the West,'' was co-executive producer of ``The Cosby Show'' and
has written for ``The Mary Tyler Moore Show,'' ``Cheers'' and
``Taxi,'' among others. He said it is impossible to sit down and
create a show with the purpose of being a network hit.
   ``In 1984, nobody thought `Cosby' was going to be a hit. ... All
the questions were, how are you going to beat `Magnum, P.I.'? _
such a big hit,'' he said.
   Pomerantz and McRaney, who helped come up with the concept for
``Major Dad,'' think the chemistry between the seemingly mismatched
lovers will charm viewers.
   ``I think a lot of people have a notion of a Marine being about
as far right-wing as you can go without becoming Genghis Khan, and
a lot of other people have the notion that journalists are about as
left-wing as you can go without actually pledging allegiance to the
red flag,'' said McRaney.
   ``So you've got these two extreme differences, and the thing
that we would like to carry out in this show is the notion that you
can have divergent points of view, but we're all in the same game
here. Maybe it's too much of a cliche to say that love conquers
all, but it can conquer a lot.''
   Much of the research for the show was conducted at Camp
Pendleton in California and some outdoor scenes will be filmed
there, said Pomerantz. But most of it is filmed on a soundstage in
front of an audience, some of whom are Marines, he said.
   A Marine Reserve officer is an adviser on the show, and the
extras are real Marines, said Pomerantz, ``because we couldn't get
extras to get a haircut for $35 a day.''
   Marines seem to like the show.
   ``We showed this show to Marines,'' Pomerantz said. ``Actually
we didn't show it, all of a sudden it was bootlegged all over the
camps, and so when we came down there, they were already talking
demographics and can we beat `ALF.'''

<HEAD>Files of Ex-Pierce Lieutenant Cast Light on Her Power At HUD</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN KING</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   At times Deborah Gore Dean's endorsement came
full of enthusiasm.
   ``This is a must! A go! I love this project!'' she said in an
April 1986 note about a proposal for a Department of Housing and
Urban Development grant to help finance a Baltimore project.
   No matter how it was delivered, Ms. Dean's endorsement carried
considerable weight, a fact not lost on HUD and congressional
investigators who question whether the woman who served as former
HUD Secretary Samuel Pierce's top lieutenant was qualified or
authorized to make such decisions at all.
   ``It's amazing to see all the things that she signed, most of
which she had no authority to do,'' said a new official at HUD who
asked not to be identified. ``She does appear to have enjoyed
considerable power.''
   As Pierce's executive assistant, Ms. Dean's job ostensibly was
to push the secretary's agenda and manage the day-to-day affairs of
his office.
   But a review of her files at HUD offers little evidence of a
Pierce agenda and ample evidence that Ms. Dean, whose position
carried no management authority, involved herself in a wide range
of HUD activities _ and considered hers to be the final word.
   Developers, consultants and others who did business with HUD
during Ms. Dean's three years as executive assistant appear to have
agreed with her self-assessment.
   ``We are very appreciative of your assistance in expediting this
matter,'' former HUD Secretary Carla Hills said in a March 1987
note to Ms. Dean thanking her for her intervention on behalf of a
Hills client.
   ``She has proven herself not only very capable of handling
day-to-day administrative matters but also of making the `wheels of
government' turn in an expeditious manner,'' then-Republican Rep.
Trent Lott of Mississippi said in an April 1987 letter to Pierce.
   Ms. Dean is a central figure in the current investigations of
HUD, internal, congressional and Justice Department reviews of
allegations of fraud, mismanagement and political cronyism at the
agency during the Reagan administration. She came to HUD after a
brief stint as an Energy Department aide and prior to that was a
part-time bartender and publisher of a lifestlye magazine.
   The 34-year-old daughter of a prominent Republican family
refused to testify when called before Congress, invoking her Fifth
Amendment right against self-incrimination. She also has declined,
through her attorney, repeated recent requests for interviews.
   She has, according to sources, offered to implicate Pierce in a
number of funding decisions in exhance for a grant of immunity. But
the subcommittee conducting the review has to date balked at the
offer and sought to gather information about Pierce through other
witnesses. There is nothing to indicate any impropriety by Pierce
but such testimony by Ms. Dean would contradict Pierce's earlier
sworn statement that he took no direct role in funding decisions.
   Ms. Dean's files, reviewed under provisions of the Freedom of
Information Act, do indeed contain evidence Pierce was more
involved in certain HUD decisions than he indicated in his
congressional testimony.
   Letters kept by Ms. Dean indicate Pierce intervened on projects
involving jazz musician Lionel Hampton, former GOP Sen. Edward
Brooke of Massachusetts and a Mississippi state lawmaker.
   But more abundant is evidence that those seeking help at HUD saw
Ms. Dean as their problem solver. Equally abundant is evidence that
she went to great lengths to keep in touch with prominent
Republicans and members of the Reagan administration. In between,
she wrote thank-you notes for the chocolates, roses, Teddy Bears
and other gifts given her by associates and admirers.
   The entreaties for help came from an array of sources _
developers, consultants, members of Congress and on occasion the
White House.
   Not all the mail, however, was complimentary.
   ``It is not that I have never been lied to before,'' Rep. Gene
Snyder, R-Kan., said in a 1986 letter to Ms. Dean protesting a
decision affecting a project in his state. ``I have been but not by
my own administration.''
   Also in the files is an angry letter from then-New Hampshire
Gov. John Sununu to Pierce, protesting a newspaper article in which
Ms. Dean was said to have speculated that home prices in the state
would drop if it had an income tax.
   Ms. Dean sent a letter of apology to Sununu and said she had
been misquoted. He is now White House chief of staff.
   Another letter offers evidence that Ms. Dean kept in touch with
former allies at the agency who left to go into HUD-related
business.
   ``I have tried to keep all of the commitments that you made and
that I made to you,'' Ms. Dean said in a 1985 letter to Philip
Abrams, one of a handful of HUD officials who teamed up on a number
of lucrative HUD projects after leaving government.
   In that same letter she wrote of a fight with Shirley McVay
Wiseman, then an assistant secretary at HUD, over a new policy
proposal. ``Shirley is impossible,'' she wrote Abrams.
   Three months later, when Pierce distributed a memo informing
senior staff that Ms. Wiseman was resigning, Ms. Dean could not
control her glee.
   Across the note, in inch-high letters, she scribbled: ``YEAH!''

   Bernard C. Duse Jr. never thought being
black posed any problems he couldn't overcome.
   ``I have always said whatever problems I will hit in that
regard, I will overcome that, and I have always done that by simply
working harder and putting my shoulder to the wheels ... to work
harder to overcome that,'' Duse said.
   His life seemed unlikely to prove him wrong, until January 1984,
when he complained of racial discrimination at IBM, his employer of
14 years.
   In the months that followed, Duse's mental stability was
questioned and he was falsely accused of sexual harassment.
Security agents put him under around-the-clock surveillance,
tailing his car and watching him through binoculars. Finally, he
was fired.
   ``You can't overcome situations where people are paid hundreds
of thousands of dollars to do the things that were done to me. It
was racially motivated in the extreme,'' Duse told Stamford
Superior Court Judge Sidney Landau.
   To be treated ``like some two-bit drug dealer ... took my sense
of self and flushed it down the toilet,'' he said.
   Landau in May awarded Duse a $4 million default judgment after
one of the detective agencies that shadowed him didn't answer a
lawsuit. It was a largely moral victory because the firm, LSI Inc.
of Fairfield, is insolvent. But Duse, 48, says the record is clear:
IBM was suffering from paranoia, not him.
   ``The damage done to my character has been considerable,'' he
said in an interview. ``I will get a great deal of pleasure having
these things exposed.''
   Duse is suing IBM and seven former and current executives, in
U.S. District Court in New Haven, for alleged discrimination,
breach of contract, invasion of privacy and trespassing. He is
seeking unspecified damages.
   IBM, which has earned praise for hiring and promoting blacks and
this year was ranked by Black Enterprise magazine as one of the top
50 places for blacks to work, denies Duse's allegations and says it
is eager to tell its side of the story in court.
   IBM spokesmen said they could not respond to specifics because
of an order the company sought from U.S. District Judge Ellen Burns
barring access to much of the evidence and limiting what Duse and
attorneys can say.
   But IBM doesn't dispute that its fears about a once-rising
manager led to extraordinary security measures and surveillance
costing more than $450,000.
   Duse earned an engineering degree at the University of
Pittsburgh, served two years in the Army _ six months of it in
Vietnam as a platoon leader and as a company executive officer _
then went to work for Procter &amp; Gamble Co. as assistant manager of
a regional data center in Los Angeles.
   Unsatisfied with the pace of advancement, he left for Harvard
Business School, earning an MBA in 1970. He was recruited by IBM,
which marked his rise with superior job ratings and a trip to
middle-manager school in 1980.
   But then things changed. He didn't get an expected promotion.
His job rating dropped. In August 1983, Duse's immediate boss,
James H. Beall Jr., was put in charge of a project Duse says he had
developed.
   In January 1984, after Duse told IBM through his attorney that
he believed he was the victim of discrimination, Beall embarked on
a campaign to harass and discredit him, Duse said. Beall said ``if
it were up to him he would summarily execute me,'' and twice
commented about sending the Ku Klux Klan to his home.
   Duse also contends Beall was behind a sexual harassment
complaint filed by a woman Duse had hired. IBM found that complaint
to be groundless.
   It also found Duse's charges against Beall groundless and
ordered him in May 1984 to stay away from work pending psychiatric
examination.
   An IBM psychiatrist said Duse appeared to be suffering from a
paranoid personality disorder and should work with different
managers. A psychiatrist picked by Duse said he was
obsessive-compulsive, but that ``most executives, if they are any
good, are obsessive, compulsive and they are also hypomanic.''
   It was on the first weekend of his forced leave that Duse
started to suspect someone was following him. He noticed suspicious
cars parked on roads around his property, then caught someone
looking at his home with binoculars.
   He returned to work in July 1984, to a non-managerial position,
filed his lawsuit against IBM that month, and was fired in November.
   IBM said Duse had instilled fear of physical harm in people.
   ``I know of no one who in any way ever told me my presence
instilled fear in them,'' Duse said. ``It might be just being black
instills fear. Or it might be having served in Vietnam instills
fear. I would recommend anyone who feels that way to get
psychiatric treatment.''
   Security agents who took part in the Duse operation said they
watched IBM offices in Stamford and Westchester County, N.Y., and
the Connecticut homes of three of Duse's bosses, around-the-clock
starting in early May 1984.
   Investigative reports obtained by Duse and his attorney, David
S. Golub, in 1985 show that security agents kept close tabs on him.
One agent reported heading down Duse's driveway at 2 a.m. on May
11, 1984.
   Two former members of one security detail, who spoke on
condition of anonymity, said IBM officials became alarmed when Duse
applied to New Cannan police in late April or early May 1984 for a
permit to carry a weapon.
   IBM was haunted by a 1982 attack in Bethesda, Md., the agents
said. Edward Mann, a black former employee who had complained of
racial discrimination years earlier went on a shooting rampage that
May, killing three people and wounding six. Mann hanged himself in
1986 in a Baltimore prison.
   ``I remember that being an issue of why they were going to such
great lengths,'' said one of the agents, a retired police officer.
``They were afraid they might have another incident like in
Maryland.''
   Duse, who is divorced, lives in a home in New Canaan that sits
100 yards from the road, hidden by foliage. He said he bought a
small-caliber handgun in mid-May, while on leave, only because of
the alleged Klan threats.
   ``I think the security apparatus at IBM was embarrassed at what
happened in Maryland and they had a chance with me to do several
things showing top management they could carry out their security
responsibilities,'' Duse said.
   ``Based on what happened in Bethesda they probably considered
all black males a potential danger. We were not seen as
individuals,'' he said.
   According to court documents, IBM made nearly all of its
payments for the Duse operation to a Virginia firm, Richard W.
Kobetz &amp; Associates. Duse also is suing Kobetz and All-Facts Inc.
of Briarcliff Manor, N.Y., alleging invasion of privacy,
trespassing and unfair trade practices. Both deny any illegalities.
   Meanwhile, the ordeal has taken a toll.
   Duse said he hasn't been able to find a comparable job _ he was
making $72,000 a year _ because he has been blacklisted. He said he
suffers continual headaches and difficulty sleeping, and at one
point considered suicide.
   IBM lawyers say Duse has not been serious about seeking a new
job and ask why he has not seen a doctor for the health problems he
claims.
   ``A psychiatrist cannot give me back my good name and compensate
me for the damages done to me or give me employment. That is what I
need,'' Duse said.
   ``I take great pride in respecting the laws of the country, the
state, the town and the rights of other people, and to be treated
in the way I was treated _ it simply is unconscionable,'' he told
Landau. ``I believe if I were white I would not have been treated
that way.''

   When Leonhard Wiegandt moved here
nine years ago he thought he had found paradise.
   ``I came up here and carefully picked this place because I
wanted to be away from highways, any kind of noise,'' said
Wiegandt, 52, who grazes 80 head of cattle on a 440-acre spread in
the peace and quiet of St. Lawrence County.
   It is a paradise about to be lost.
   Strategic Air Command bombers flying out of four Northeast bases
will soon begin making 75 to 100 flights a month _ never on
weekends _ as low as 500 feet along a training route that passes
right over Wiegandt's barn.
   The West German native already knows what it will be like living
under IR-806, as the Air Force calls the route. In May, the F-111A
fighter-bombers and aging, eight-engine B-52s made demonstration
flights for two days.
   ``Almost every one of the planes went right dead-center over my
barn,'' he said. ``The cows got spooked, broke down the gate and
ran into the barn because of the noise. I'd hate to be milking when
they fly over, I'd probably get my head kicked off.''
   The 440-mile route begins over Montpelier, Vt., with the planes
cruising at 7,000 feet. They enter New York at the northern tip of
Lake George, begin to descend as they fly northwest past Lake
Placid, then head southwest to Fort Drum for bombing runs before
heading out over Lake Ontario and home.
   The planes are based at Griffiss and Plattsburgh air force bases
in New York, Pease in New Hampshire and Loring in Maine.
   ``It's extremely loud when you are directly underneath the
flight path. Incredibly loud. It's painful,'' said Kathleen
Fitzgerald, who moved here 13 years ago from New Jersey to escape
suburbia and big cities.
   The northern fringe of the Adirondacks ``is an area where I can
confidently enjoy life. Where serious crime is not a substantial
problem. Where the air is clean. Where the people care about the
homey things in life,'' said Dick Mooers, deputy director of the
St. Lawrence County Planning Office.
   St. Lawrence County is vast _ its 2,840 square miles make it
larger than Delaware. Farming is the main business _ 800 full-time
dairy farms and another 800 part-time farms dot the gently rolling
countryside.
   More than 95 percent of those farms are privately owned, and
farmers like Wiegandt are constantly under pressure to produce
more. ``I'm working 16 hours a day, every day,'' he said.
``Physically, I can't give no more. The smallest thing that goes
wrong on a farm is a hassle.''
   For many northern New Yorkers, low-flying planes are not new;
Air Force jets have been training over the Adirondacks for 23
years. But in January the Air Force decided to modify a couple of
the routes to allow flights as low as 400 feet. A required
environmental assessment was drawn up; it concluded that no
significant negative environmental impact would be felt.
   However, the assessment was perceived as superficial and the
announcement brought a storm of protest from environmentalists
concerned about maintaining the tranquility of the 6 million-acre
Adirondack Park and the safety of such endangered species as
peregrine falcons and bald eagles, which nest there.
   The Air Force compiled a second, more detailed assessment, and
made changes that have relieved some of the apprehensions of park
advocates. After a meeting in June with local officials, SAC
decided to raise the altitude to 1,000 feet over parts of St.
Lawrence County, but the noise won't be appreciably cut.
   The new proposal says planes will avoid the endangered species
and other sensitive wilderness areas, and shifts more flights onto
IR-806, which has an area the Air Force calls a ``racetrack,'' a
rounded triangle 30 miles wide that allows each plane to make three
passes per flight over Fort Drum. In an era of budget restraint,
that cuts costs and gives pilots more training per flight.
   ``We need to use that range,'' said Sgt. Alan Dockery, a SAC
spokesman. ``Our bases in the Northeast have to go a long way to
ranges out West. If they can have access to a range in the
Northeast where they can drop their training devices, that will
save us as much as $50,000 on a B-52 mission. Nowadays, we have to
pinch every dollar. That gets expensive, even for the Air Force.''
   But the proposal also means three passes over Wiegandt's farm.
``You're talking an excess of 4,000 planes flying over my place in
a year's time. And if they don't fly over my place, they fly over
somebody else's,'' he said.
   The perception persists here that the Air Force hasn't done its
homework.
   Hermon-DeKalb Central School ``is not mentioned, they said they
didn't know we were there,'' complained school board president Bob
Josephson. ``Well, we have 600 kids in the school every day who
know where we are.''
   ``The racetrack is over farms and forest land,'' Mooers said,
though 12,500 people live directly under the flight path. ``That
even surprised us. And there are six colleges with over 8,000
students.''
   There are also 76 Amish families in the county who rely on
horses for both transportation and agriculture, he said. Horses
frighten easily, so there is a concern that noise from a low-flying
jet might cause an accident. People want to know who would end up
paying if that happened.
   Noise isn't the only concern. A string of accidents during
low-level NATO flights over West Germany last year killed more than
100 people.
   ``I keep thinking that if they veered it wouldn't take much for
them to land in my back yard,'' Hodge said. ``They're not very far
above the ground, it wouldn't take much, just a little mistake, for
one to crash. We know they hit the ground, that's why they're upset
over in Germany.''
   The Air Force plans to monitor the flights and assess their
environmental impact for a year before SAC decides on a long-term
commitment.
   Wiegandt winces at the thought.
   ``The funny thing is I like airplanes. It used to be a hobby of
mine. When I was a kid I used to make all the models. And I like to
see them, don't get me wrong. We gotta have an air force, and I
think we've got the best air force in the world. And they gotta
train somewheres to keep 'em the best.
   ``But that's not the point. I was here first.''

   When American dramatist Richard Nelson was asked
to write a play for Britain's Royal Shakespeare Company, he set one
condition: ``There was no way I would write about English people;
that would be wildly presumptuous.''
   Instead, Nelson chose as his topic a troupe of American
academics leading a theater tour of England. The result is ``Some
Americans Abroad,'' the first play the state-subsidized RSC has
ever commissioned from an American.
   Reviews have been mixed to favorable. Michael Billington in The
Guardian thought it was ``beadily funny'' in Nelson's
``characteristically wry, ironic'' style.
   But Martin Hoyle in The Financial Times found the play ``a
frequently delicious joke (that) may be as insubstantial as dry
ice,'' adding, ``Had an Englishman created these Americans ... it
would have been a case for the Race Relations Board.''
   The play, directed by Roger Michell, had its world premiere July
19 at the RSC's small studio theater, The Pit, located in the
depths of London's Barbican Center. It runs in repertory through
Sept. 12.
   It would have been easy for ``Some Americans Abroad'' to pander
to the cultural snobbism of some English intellectuals who love
mocking American theatergoers for laughing in the wrong places or
romanticizing anything British.
   But the 38-year-old Nelson said in an interview that he was
after greater complexity. His characters are mostly duplicitous,
money-obsessed and culturally bereft, but the play, he said, ``deep
down is about exile, not only geographically but out of time. These
are people of a liberal consciousness adrift in a time when to be
of the liberal left in the United States is very frustrating.
   ``I never thought, `Let's go bash on Americans and really make
fun.'''
   An all-British cast plays American tourists _ faculty, mostly,
and several students _ who frequent theaters in London and
Stratford-upon-Avon omnivorously feasting on a culture which, it
becomes clear, they don't really understand.
   Chief among them are Joe (Anton Lesser), an erstwhile leftist
and cynical professor of English; Philip (Oliver Cotton), his
broodingly handsome colleague accused of molesting one of the 22
students on the tour; and Henry (Simon Russell Beale), the young
lecturer being quietly ousted from his job.
   Nelson said he wanted to explore attitudes towards culture: ``I
think we (in America) are, by and large, a country that is
unconcerned about its own culture and the continuity of that
culture.
   ``We latch on to things that don't matter, that we can put on a
pedestal.''
   Accordingly, his characters sentimentalize plays whose titles
they can't remember and, in one especially peculiar scene, appear
on Westminster Bridge in the rain reciting William Wordsworth's
celebrated poem about it.
   The theme of exile, physical and spiritual, is common to
Nelson's plays. ``Between East and West,'' seen in London in 1987,
examines the displacement of a Czech theater director and his
actress wife who have moved to New York from Prague.
   ``Principia Scriptoriae,'' which ran off-Broadway and at the RSC
in 1986, is about an American writer in self-imposed exile to Latin
America.
   ``Principia'' was better received in London than New York, and
its acclaim prompted the RSC to commission the current play.
   ``The two experiences I've had with the RSC have been the two
best I've ever had with plays of mine,'' said Nelson, who talks in
the same Anglophile terms that he derides in his new play.
   ``The reaction here has been much more generous, much more
understanding,'' he said. ``(My plays) have been critically
perceived and understood and argued about.''
   But Nelson, a Chicago native and Yale Drama School graduate, has
no plans to uproot his family to move to London from their home in
Rhinebeck, N.Y.
   ``I love my country,'' said Nelson. ``I'm American; I love
living in America.''

   Lee Iacocca, the driver behind the
restoration of Chrysler Corp. and Statue of Liberty, the irreverent
executive who's done his own ads and guest-starred on prime-time
TV, is content these days to sit back a little and take it easy,
letting others run the business.
   But when it comes to key decisions at Chrysler, the 64-year-old
chairman is ready to assert himself over subordinates with
undisputed authority.
   ``I try not to get in their hair, but I do,'' Iacocca said in an
interview. ``I'm trying to stay out the best I can. But right now,
we've got a lot of tough, tough decisions to make. How do you
prioritize?''
   He jumped right in this past week, proclaiming a $1 billion
cost-cutting program to make the automaker more competitive.
Iacocca broke the news that Chrysler will retire or lay off 2,300
of the company's 31,000 salaried workers by year-end, and said
profitability must ``become a part of our culture.''
   Company executives are confronting several problems: a declining
market share, a slowing economy, the relentless competition from
Japan and now Korea, improving the mix of vehicle models and
allaying investor concerns.
   Chrysler's second-quarter earnings are due Monday. Analysts
expect a slight increase over the $320.4 million the nation's No. 3
automaker made during the same period last year. But they hedge the
prediction because Chrysler has spent so much on incentives to sell
its cars and trucks.
   Through July 20, Chrysler's car and truck sales were running 8
percent behind the pace of last year, a worse showing than its Big
Three rivals, General Motors Corp. and Ford Motor Co.
   There's little doubt the total market demand this year will fall
well below the 15.8 million vehicles sold last year, one of the
best in industry history.
   Iacocca estimates sales between 13.5 million and 14 million
vehicles this year, the lowest estimate of the Big Three chairmen.
GM's Roger Smith predicts about 15 million, and Ford's Donald
Petersen reckons about 14.7 million.
   ``I've been saying this for a lot of years, and it's the old
story, I'll have to be right one year. We're going to have to have
a pause, a recession,'' Iacocca said. ``I thought it would be
mid-'88 to mid-'89, I think I was off by a good, solid year.''
   He predicted a tough time for the next 12 to 18 months, but said
Chrysler, the auto industry and the U.S. economy are in better
shape now than they were before the last big industry slump in the
early 1980s.
   ``We were worst of the three at that time, but they (GM and
Ford) weren't very far behind if this would have kept up,'' he said.
   In a move that's been written into the business history books, a
sickly Chrysler beseeched the federal government for help in the
late 1970s and eventually secured $1.5 billion in loan guarantees
to survive.
   Under Iacocca's guidance, Chrysler repaid the loans seven years
early, and he frequently talks about that with a mix of humor and
bluntness.
   When he first disclosed Chrysler's early-repayment plan at the
National Press Club in Washington in July 1983, Iacocca told
reporters: ``We at Chrysler borrow money the old fashioned way. We
pay it back.''
   Nonetheless, the company is still a bit wobbly and faces
significant questions about its long-term direction.
   Measured by sales, Chrysler is becoming a truck company. Through
the first six months of the year, it sold more trucks than cars,
partly because of the trend-setting minivans _ the Dodge Caravan
and the Plymouth Voyager _ and Jeeps, which Chrysler got buy
purchasing American Motors Corp. in August 1987.
   Chrysler commands more than 55 percent of the minivan market,
which Iacocca says will be impossible to hold because of
competition from imports and a new line of GM minivans.
   Iacocca recalled when he introduced minivans in 1983: ``I
remember some wise-ass at Ford said, `They are on dope over there.'
They said it was a little nothing, it was sort of a fad. Who would
want a little van when they could get a big van?
   ``What they forgot is that you weren't going after the van or
wagon owner, you were going after the four-door sedan owner and
there's 5 million of those a year.''
   Whether they're minivan buyers or not, Iacocca goes after them
all, many times personally.
   Since Nov. 1, 1978, when he was fired as president of Ford and
went to Chrysler with the same title, he's become synonymous with
Chrysler.
   Iacocca's contract with Chrysler runs through 1991 and he isn't
saying whether he'll stick around thereafter, or want to.
   ``I've got to do a lot in the next 2{ years,'' he said. ``I
always thought that compared with the Japanese, we put the good
guys out _ 65 and over. That's when they're just coming into their
own in Japan. I thing it is stupid the way we take assets and throw
them out.''
   Besides salary, bonuses and stock-option rights, Iacocca will
receive 225,000 shares of Chrysler common stock in 1990 and 1991
worth, at today's prices, about $6 million.
   He has withstood the wrath of the United Auto Workers union and
others in the past for multimillion-dollar annual earnings that
critics have called obscene and unjustified. The chairman not only
hasn't apologized, he's called his compensation the prize that
comes with the task of saving a big company.
   There is little Iacocca won't do to create a friendly image for
himself and Chrysler.
   He's appeared in television ads, did a guest spot on ``Miami
Vice'' and said in newspaper ads: ``Did we screw up? You bet we
did'' when the federal government nailed the company for odometer
fraud.
   His personal life has snared attention too. He was involved in a
well-publicized divorce from his second wife, Peggy, whom he
married after the death of his first wife, Mary. He nearly was
drafted for president in 1988 and, in perhaps one of the proudest
efforts by the son of Italian immigrants, Iacocca spearheaded the
restoration of the Statue of Liberty.
   Like many of his other projects, controversy swirled around the
multimillion dollar rejuvenation of America's freedom symbol in New
York harbor.
   Like other ventures, Iacocca said he learned from it. In four
years of the project, Iacocca became fed up with the infighting and
red tape obstacles lobbed at him by Washington bureaucrats.
   ``I decided, `How would you like to go down there and do that
for a living on everything?' So maybe it's the best lesson I ever
got,'' he said. ``If it hadn't, maybe I'd have been stupid enough
to run for president.''

   Hundreds of thousands of rural Americans every
year are giving up and moving to cities and suburbs. Frustrated by
farming troubles or left without jobs when factories close, many
leave houses, schools, even whole towns abandoned to the winds.
Congressional hearings on the crisis begin this week. Yet as one
part of rural America disappears, another part is hanging on, even
flourishing: the town that attracts a shopping mall, that happens
to lie along an interstate route. In this first story in an AP
Extra series, ``Rural Crossroads,'' Midwest Regional Reporter
Sharon Cohen and Mountain States Regional Reporter Tad Bartimus
look at the two rural Americas.

   As unobtrusive as a church bell, as final as a funeral notice,
the passing away of so much of rural America began with a
going-out-of-business sign.
   Perhaps it appeared in a shoe store window, or the florist's
shop where every bride of the past 50 years ordered her bouquet. It
happened because the railroad died, the hotel closed, jobs dried
up, folks moved on.
   The vast stretch of America, beyond the nighttime glow of
cities, where stars and a few street lights mean rural life, has
been shrinking and struggling for decades.
   As the nation faces the 1990s, farmers and small-town citizens
no longer live in the countryside found in a Willa Cather novel or
on a Norman Rockwell canvas. Today there are two rural Americas:
one is dying, the other surviving, often by its wits.
   Isolated, one-industry towns and backroads hamlets that once
defined ``country'' are fading into history. At the same time
modern little communities with diverse economic foundations and
fortuitous locations are going strong.
   ``The remote rural areas that are falling farther and farther
behind have little prospect for attracting industry,'' said Cynthia
Duncan, associate director of the Rural Economic Policy Program of
the Aspen Institute, a think tank that does social and economic
research. ``Rural areas that are closer to cities ... are more
resilient and are going to recover faster.''
   The dying rural America is evident in the country school, its
once-white clapboards peeling gray in the unrelenting wind of the
Nebraska prairie, and in the dilapidated homesteads of North Dakota
where roof-high lilac bushes grow untended.
   A way of life is disappearing when, in Montana, a homemakers'
group cancels its annual Mother's Day tea because so few members
remain.
   But the other rural America, the one that will survive, has its
symbols, too.
   Aggressive communities in Missouri and other states entice
business with free land and other incentives. In Iowa, little towns
struggling to pay for police protection or individual schools are
banding together in ``clusters'' that share the costs. In Texas,
the county with the largest quail population started organizing
hunts that now attract hunters from 26 states.
   ``If they can do it, you can do it all over,'' said David
Guarino of the Texas Department of Agriculture, which helped with a
grant.
   For almost two centuries, the historical and emotional pull of
rural and small-town life put the heartbeat in the heartland. The
idealized myth of a homogeneous rural America, where a family lived
off a bountiful land, shopped in a small town free of crime and
perpetuated itself in prosperity and harmony through grit, hard
work and lofty moral principles goes back to the day the Pilgrims
landed.
   Thomas Jefferson articulated the ideal, holding that land
ownership must be broad-based, that democracy must be rooted in the
individual efforts of small farmers and merchants.
   And yet, except for a brief ``rural renaissance'' in the 1970s,
when 4.5 million people fled the cities to earn livings in the
country as coal and farming boomed, much of rural life has been on
a long decline.
   ``In the '80s,'' said Calvin Beale, chief Agriculture Department
demographer, ``we simply do not see many of the
back-to-the-landers, homesteader or urban refugees who go out to
upper Michigan, upper Minnesota, the Ozarks, northeastern New
England to make their living in a small-town community because they
prefer to do it.''
   The '80s added new crises to old challenges: tumbling land
values, farm foreclosures, two droughts, school consolidation,
falling commodity and petroleum prices, deregulation and declining
services, a brain drain and a loss of jobs caused by mechanization,
factory closings and increased use of cheap Third World labor.
   The result has been an exodus to urban centers and dire
predictions for the future.
   ``Unless action is taken, virtually every citizen of the country
will be forced to live in a metropolitan area,'' said Rep. Glenn
English, D-Okla., whose House Agriculture subcommittee opens
hearings Monday on rural development. The first hearing is in
Clarksdale, Miss. Future hearings will be in Amarillo, Texas;
Marshalltown, Iowa, and Blackfoot, Idaho.
   Nearly 1 million people left rural America in 1986-'87. ``That
scenario is good for no one,'' said English. ``It would overburden
our cities and suburbs as much as it would devastate our rural
communities.''
   Through the '80s, rural America has witnessed a decline in
services and jobs and a rise in poverty.
   ``You can draw a lot of parallels between remote rural areas and
the inner city,'' said the Aspen Institute's Duncan. ``In both
cases, people with education and skills left. ... You end up
without a middle class, without role models. They don't have the
economic security and economic opportunity. They can't invest in
the schools and good government at the local level.''
   Television has let the rural poor ``know how different their
lives are from the rest of the world,'' said David Lollis, director
of the Federation of Appalachian Housing Enterprises in Kentucky.
   Propping up many dying small towns is the elderly retired
population, which lives off transfer payments such as pensions,
medical and disability insurance and income maintenance programs.
In nearly half of Kansas' counties in 1985, 44 percent of income
came from transfer payments or property income.
   ``The world has changed and our population has aged,'' said Mary
Schissel, city clerk in Dougherty, Iowa, a town of 128. ``A lot of
our leaders want to take a break. They're in their mid- to
late-60s. They say it's time for someone else to do this.''
   But who? Not young people. Of the hundreds of thousands leaving
rural places in 1986-87, one-third were 18 to 24 years old. More
than half had at least one year of college.
   ``The brain drain in rural areas is enormous,'' said Bob
Bergland, agriculture secretary under President Carter and now head
of the National Rural Electric Cooperative Association. ``The kids
who stay are the ones who fail to graduate. ... You can't get an
employer who requires a high level of skill to come into a place
with crummy schools.''
   And without jobs, people leave.
   ``If you've got a college degree, about the only thing you can
do is become a teacher or a nurse, and there are dozens of
applicants for every job,'' said Anne Smith of Bainville, Mont.,
who spends her work week 100 miles from her husband so her
teacher's salary can help pay for their ranch.
   Hard times on ranches and farms in the early '80s also pushed
many people off the land.
   ``Our biggest worry right now is that we've lost an entire
generation of farmers,'' said Heather Ball, an economist with the
Texas Department of Agriculture. ``You don't go out to rural Texas
and find young farmers anymore. The whole future has packed up and
moved away.''

   It's a new chapter in an old story. Farm population has been
dropping since 1916 and and small towns have been struggling for
more than a century, said Beale, the Agriculture Department
demographer. He cites a book titled ``Dead Towns of Georgia'' _
published in 1874.
   New figures do provide a bit of good news for farmers who
toughed out the '80s. For 1988, Agriculture Department studies said
net farm income was at a record high of $57.7 billion _ though some
experts caution that a small percentage of large-scale farmers
account for a huge chunk of that.
   Also last year, loan delinquencies reported by the Farm Credit
System dropped $2 billion to half the level of two years ago. Two
thousand farmers filed Chapter 12 bankruptcies, but that was less
than a third of 1987's filings.
   There is prosperity in some rural areas _ often in towns with a
unifying core such as a county courthouse or a medical center,
usually near a major highway.
   ``If your town isn't on an interstate, forget it,'' said James
R. Shortridge, a cultural biographer at the University of Kansas.
   ``Development comes more quickly within 100 miles of a major
trading center or a city,'' Bergland said.
   For many small towns, survival is assured with the arrival of a
major merchandising center with an anchor store, usually a Wal-Mart.
   And yet this regional draw for one town often takes customers
away from the Main Street retailers of surrounding communities.
   Rex Campbell, a University of Missouri rural sociologist,
considers the spread of chain stores a major reason for the
shifting rural landscape.
   ``Wal-Mart is the innovator, they know how to target growth and
they're expert marketers and mass merchandisers. They were able to
go into smaller markets than K mart or other competitors, and now
they're replacing several mom-and-pop businesses, which formerly
sold hardware, dry goods, clothes, shoes, and such.''
   After Wal-Mart and some other discounters moved into Mason City,
Iowa, people in outlying towns noticed their business dropping off.
   Gene Persons, who has a grocery in Sheffield, 16 miles away,
acknowledged, ``We sit here and try to do what we can to stop them.
... There's only so many dollars to go around.'' He and others have
formed a ``commonwealth'' of neighboring small towns that pool
resources to promote themselves.
   For other pragmatic rural residents, adapting means working in
the city in order to live in the countryside.
   Some Missourians, for example, drive 150 miles each way to the
Chrysler Corp. plant in the St. Louis suburb of Fenton to earn $15
an hour, Campbell said. ``For every $1 of hourly wage, they'll
commute an average of 10 miles each way.''
   Ultimately, authorities say, these approaches will not be enough
to ensure the survival of many little towns. They must rebuild
their economies locally _ get access to investment money,
telecommunications, transportation and educational opportunities.
Perhaps most importantly, they must diversify.
   ``How does rural America participate in the growth of a
service-oriented economy? That's the basic underlying question,''
Beale said. ``It can't come out of agriculture. It has to come of
the industries driving the national economy.''
   Rural residents must even look beyond that, to the global
economy. Whereas corporations in the '50s and '60s moved to rural
America for cheaper labor, now the Third World market is even more
enticing.
   ``What it means for people is the same _ someone is out of a
job, a small town is dying,'' said Ann Tickamyer, assistant
professor of sociology at the University of Kentucky. ``Unless
major efforts are taken to re-evaluate what we want in a rural
economy, the prognosis is fairly grim.''
   A few residents, perhaps, will stay on in small towns that don't
rethink and adjust, that don't go looking for employers to
diversify a one-industry, boom-and-bust economy.
   ``Those little places are never going to die, there will always
be a housing unit or so, but they'll deteriorate,'' Campbell said.
``What has been lost is the heart, and what you're left with is the
shell.''

   At 40, Bill Hoch has been gone from
his parents' Emporia dairy farm half his life, but he says he
carries its early lessons with him every day.
   He believes many of his generation left rural life behind
because they were profoundly influenced by global images conveyed
through mass communications.
   ``All of a sudden we started seeing things from around the
nation, around the world, even from the moon. For our parents that
was the stuff of which daydreams were made, not reality. But for
us, it could become reality.
   ``The mid to late '60s created an enormous, almost magnetic pull
on people like myself, pulling us away from small-town rural life.
The attraction was political, social, artistic, but it all crested
on the wave of the communications revolution.''
   Hoch remembers growing up on the farm and delivering milk to
small towns, country schools and neighborhood farms that no longer
exist.
   ``When you look at rural life and how it's changed in the last
20 years it's easy to get depressed,'' he said. ``I find it
destructive and regrettable that so much has disappeared, because
beyond the economic impact, the loss has created a vacuum.''
   Now a resident of this suburb, Hoch regularly enjoys the
concerts, plays and sporting events Kansas City offers, ``and I'd
be reluctant to give that up. I enjoy the amenities of a city.'' He
says he needs the metropolitan environment for his communications
business.
   But he and his wife, Ellen, visit Emporia frequently. His
hometown, 100 miles southwest of Kansas City, has grown from 15,000
residents when he lived there to about 30,000 today.
   ``There's an enormous sense of stability in knowing my family
still lives on that same 100 acres we've owned for the better part
of a century.''
   Hoch's pet pony, Rusty, died only a few years ago at the age of
35 and was lovingly buried in his corral near the ancestral home. A
baby raccoon he rescued from a city tree was turned loose to roam
free in his parents' pastures. The pull of the place, where wheat
still grows and coming home for Christmas is expected, remains
strong for Bill Hoch.
   ``There used to be dozens of trucks and cars coming and going
every hour to the dairy. Now Mom and Dad go to town once a day and
that's the only dust churned up in the driveway. Even town has
changed. It used to be 10 miles away. Now it's grown so much it's
only three or four miles to the outskirts.''
   Hoch is grateful for the values he learned in his first two
decades on the farm. He credits them as the foundation upon which
he's built his urban life.
   ``I never turned away from the farm, I just physically left. I
wrestled with the choices. On the one hand there were dependable,
stable values and a very predictable way of life. On the other was
the excitment and challenge of the unknown.
   ``I never intended to stay away. I always thought I would go
back. I still think that.''

<TEXT>
   Here are some facts about rural America, provided by the U.S.
Department of Agriculture, the Census Bureau, the American Hospital
Association, and the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a
research organization.
</TEXT>
<NOTE>POPULATION:</NOTE>
<TEXT>
   Nearly 64 million people live in rural America _ more than a
quarter of the U.S. population. In 1950, rural residents were more
than a third of all Americans.
   In 1985-86, 632,000 people moved out of non-metro areas, the
government says. In contrast, in the 1970s, non-metro areas (often
used synonymously with rural) netted more than 350,000 people a
year.
</TEXT>
<NOTE>FARMING:</NOTE>
<TEXT>
   Farming reached an apex in 1916 and the population has been
falling since. In the early and mid 1980s, rising interest rates
and declining land values contributed to an exodus that saw more
than 1 million people leave the land and 273,000 farms go out of
business from 1980 to '88.
</TEXT>
<NOTE>UNEMPLOYMENT:</NOTE>
<TEXT>
   The fading small-town economy, the early '80s recession, the
movement of factory jobs to the Third World and increasing
mechanization in coal mining, agriculture, timber and paper mills
have shrunk employment opportunities.
   From 1979 to '86, rural areas lost 733,000 manufacturing, mining
and farm jobs, the government reports.
   Unemployment in non-metro areas averaged 6.9 percent for 1988
compared with 5.1 percent in metro areas. In 1979, the metro
jobless rate was higher.
   Another major shift in rural America has been the dramatic rise
of farm women in the labor force in the past two decades. According
to 1980 census figures, more than half of all farm women worked
outside the home; 78 percent in a University of Nebraska
seven-state study said economic reasons drove them into their new
jobs. In 1940, 12.1 percent of farm women were in the labor force;
in 1960, it was 22.9 percent.
</TEXT>
<NOTE>POVERTY:</NOTE>
<TEXT>
   More than 9 million of American's poor live outside metro areas,
according to a 1989 report by the Center on Budget and Policy
Priorities, a Washington group that researches issues relating to
the poor. The rate of non-metro residents living in poverty
increased from 13.7 percent to 16.9 percent from 1977 to '87, the
report said.
   For blacks, poverty is more common in non-metro areas than in
central cities, it said. More than half of all non-metro poor live
in the South and less than 10 percent of the rural poor live on
farms.
</TEXT>
<NOTE>SERVICES:</NOTE>
<TEXT>
   Deregulation led to cutbacks in air and bus service, leaving
many small towns more isolated than ever. From 1982 to 1986, 4,514
places lost bus service, according to the Interstate Commerce
Commission. From 1980 to '88, 208 rural hospitals closed, the
American Hospital Association said.
   Medicare payments to rural hospitals are smaller than to urban
ones, based on the premise that services cost less. One result is
many small facilities have drastically cut the level of care or not
bought sophisticated equipment.

   Following is a breakdown of rural and farm population trends,
provided by the U.S. Department of Agriculture, the Census Bureau
and a report, ``The Rise of Poverty in Rural America,'' published
by the Population Reference Bureau.
</TEXT>
<NOTE>RURAL POPULATION:</NOTE>
<TEXT>
   1950 _ 54.5 million (36 percent of the population).
   1960 _ 54.1 million (30.1 percent)
   1970 _ 53.6 million (26.4 percent)
   1980 _ 59.5 million (26.3 percent)
   1987 _ 63.9 million (26.8 percent)
   Experts say the 1987 number is expected to decline as some areas
are reclassified to reflect population shifts. Rural, according to
the government definition, is open country and towns with
populations less than 2,500 beyond the suburban fringe.
</TEXT>
<NOTE>FARM POPULATION:</NOTE>
<TEXT>
   Farm population peaked in 1916, when it was about 32.5 million.
   1920 _ 32 million
   1930 _ 30.5 million
   1940 _ 30.5 million
   1950 _ 23 million
   1960 _ 15.6 million
   1970 _ 9.7 million
   1980 _ 6.1 million
   1988 _ 5 million
   Between 1970 and 1980, the definition of farming changed to
apply to just those who sell at least $1,000 in products a year.
</TEXT>
<NOTE>FARM POPULATION BY REGION:</NOTE>
<TEXT>
   Northeast _ 302,000
   Midwest _ 2.52 million
   South _ 1.43 million
   West _ 725,000
</TEXT>
<NOTE>POPULATION TRENDS:</NOTE>
<TEXT>
   _Between 1970 and 1980, the annual rate of population growth in
rural America was 1.4 percent, compared with 1 percent in urban
areas.
   _ In the first half of the 1980s, rural population grew at an
annual rate of 0.7 percent, compared with 1.2 percent in urban
areas.
   _ During the '70s, rural areas experienced a net in-migration of
about 350,000 people each year. In contrast, there was a net exodus
of 632,000 people in 1985-86 and 952,000 in 1986-87.
   About a third of the '86-'87 loss was in the 18-24 age group.
More than half the adults who left rural areas in that period had
at least a year of college; almost 27 percent had four years.
   These figures are from the 1988 rural poverty report by the
Population Reference Bureau. Rural refers to non-metro counties,
those not surrounding large cities. About two-thirds of the
nation's counties are non-metro, but they have only 23 percent of
the population.
   The report also noted the data was based on Census Bureau
samplings, which were redesigned in 1984. As a result, there are
inconsistencies between statistics gathered before and after 1984.

   Arthur and Marion Vassmer ordered a shipment
of Woodstock key chains and cigarette lighters for their general
store in plenty of time for any crowds this year.
   It's what they didn't order 20 years ago this summer that still
causes a few pangs of regret.
   The shelves of their country store were nearly stripped bare
that August 15-17 when about a half million youngsters camped out
nearly two miles away at the Woodstock music festival.
   For one long weekend Vassmer's, open since 1901 on the shores of
White Lake to serve residents of this 6,000-population town,
operated like an exclusive nightclub. Bouncers stood at the front
door and let customers in a few dozen at a time to shop.
   ``If I'd known, I would have had 50 cases of peanut butter up
front and said, `there you go, take all you want,''' said Arthur
Vassmer.
   The Vassmers never made it up to Yasgur's farm during the
Woodstock festival in 1969 when flower children frolicked in the
mud and listened to The Who, Jimi Hendrix, Santana and others. They
were too busy.
   But they could hear the music wafting through the air at all
hours of the day and night. ``I didn't believe it would come off,''
Marion Vassmer said, ``and I still don't believe it was here.''
   The Vassmers remember kids abandoning their cars in town late
Thursday night, sitting on hoods and playing guitars and camping
out in the streets and nearby fields at night.
   Vassmer's, the closest store to the festival site, hadn't even
ordered any extra provisions. All of their canned goods were prized
items, along with the peanut butter. Despite the crowds, Arthur
said he doesn't remember any shoplifters and none of the 25 checks
he cashed bounced.
   ``They didn't bother anybody,'' Marion said. ``They were no
problem. I'm sure a lot of them were on drugs, but they helped each
other out. If one kid didn't have enough money, someone else would
give him some.''
   Arthur Vassmer said he dropped about 12 pounds over three days,
mostly because he couldn't bear to turn on his light and cook
something in his apartment above the store with so many hungry kids
on the street below.
   The couple love reminiscing about the festival with visitors,
but they know enough not to bring up the name ``Woodstock'' to
longtime Bethel residents.
   ``It's not a good topic for conversation because people who were
against it, they still feel the same way they did then,'' said
Marion Vassmer.
   Bethel and the surrounding Catskill Mountain region has let it
be known they're not particularly sentimental for the 20th
anniversary. Bethel refused offers from promoters to be host to an
anniversary concert, even when businessmen dangled enticements such
as paying for a new town sewer system.
   Town officials are expecting several thousand people to show up
at the former Yasgur farm for the anniversary.
   The concert was originally planned for the town of Woodstock,
about 50 miles away, but moved when promoters couldn't get
permission to hold it. At Woodstock today, cynical store owners
sell T-shirts with a map of the area making clear the festival took
place in Bethel, not in the famous arts colony.
   The Vassmers are part of a contingent of Bethel residents who
wish the town could cash in on its place in history by more
actively seeking tourists, but anti-festival opinion has held sway.
   Arthur Vassmer said some people still wander into the general
store and recognize him from the movie ``Woodstock,'' in which he
was interviewed. Some even ask for autographs, which still leaves
him tickled. His store, with the worn wooden floorboards, hasn't
changed much since 1969.
   Times have, though, and that's why he can't see a repeat
performance of Woodstock.
   ``Today you couldn't do it,'' he said. ``It's a different
attitude. These people were the peace people. They came up here for
love and peace and music and that's what they got.''

<HEAD>USDA Says Dairy Outlook Improving As Congress Begins New Farm Bill</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Farm Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Last year's drought put the squeeze on dairy
farmers, but Agriculture Department analysts say that 1988 milk
production still set a record and that another boost can be
expected this year.
   The brighter outlook for milk producers comes as Congress begins
work to replace the expiring 1985 farm law. The 1990 farm bill, as
its predecessor, will have to contend with dairy price supports,
long a foundation of the industry.
   Relatively high milk prices and falling feed costs are the main
reasons cited by the department's Economic Research Service in a
new dairy outlook report. Despite the bullish view, there are a few
caveats.
   ``The past year may have sapped the financial strength of some
producers,'' the report said. ``Although higher milk prices
compensated producers fairly fully for rises in concentrate (grain)
prices, forage costs in most areas also were sharply higher.
   ``This financial strain may have been particularly acute for
those producers who expanded in late 1988 in spite of the drought
or were somewhat weak financially before the drought.''
   Farm milk prices in the second quarter averaged $12.20 per
hundredweight, up 77 cents from April-June of last year. Cow
slaughter has remained high and growth of milk output per cow has
slipped.
   But analysts said that if dairy farmers can recover quickly from
the recent slump _ as they expect will happen _ total milk output
in 1989 could exceed last year's level by 1 billion to 3 billion
pounds.
   Specifically, the agency forecasts 1989 milk output at 147.2
billion pounds, up from the record of 145.5 billion last year.
   ``The average price received by farmers in June was $12.10 per
hundredweight of milk, up 80 cents from a year earlier and the
highest June price since 1985,'' the report said. ``Thus far in
1989, milk prices have averaged 82 cents more than a year ago.''
   If prices go as expected from here on, the 1989 average of
prices paid to dairy producers would be the highest since the late
1960s, the report said.
   The boost for dairy farmers has not been without its cost to
consumers. Retail prices of dairy products continued ``to post the
largest year-to-year rises of recent years,'' the report said. In
June, the retail dairy index was up 6 percent from a year earlier.
   ``However, year-to-year increases during the second half may not
be as large as during the first half,'' the report added. ``For the
year, retail dairy prices are expected to rise 5 percent to 6
percent, the largest since 1981.''
   Department economists predict that consumer food prices overall
may rise an average of 4 percent to 7 percent in calendar 1989.
   At a House Agriculture Committee hearing July 12, the head of
one of the nation's most effective farm lobbying groups, the
National Milk Producers Federation, said the dairy industry is in
``a vastly different position'' than it was when the current law
was debated four years ago.
   ``Gone are the burgeoning surpluses of dairy products purchased
under the dairy price support program,'' said federation president
Tom Camerlo. ``Gone also is the $2 billion-plus price tag of the
dairy program.''
   Camerlo noted that U.S. milk production and consumption are in
close balance. As a result, he said, USDA has not had to buy any
cheese or non-fat dry milk this year to bolster market prices.
   However, USDA says that there have been heavy butter purchases
by the Commodity Credit Corp. and that some probably will be bought
in the second half of the year.
   According to a review of USDA spending operations, CCC spending
on dairy programs in the fiscal year that began last Oct. 1 will be
about $658 million, which Camerlo said will be ``a far cry from the
$2.1 billion cost'' of the program as recently as 1985.
   One reason for the reduction in dairy program costs has been an
insistence by Congress and the administration to roll back some of
the milk price supports from their record highs of the early 1980s.
   At that time, the high supports and rising production caused CCC
surplus inventories of dairy products to grow, which added to the
costs of operating the program. In 1983, for example, the support
program cost a record $2.7 billion.
   Fees were levied against dairy producers and other steps taken
to ease some of the growing financial burden. And the 1985 farm law
authorized a ``dairy termination program'' to reduce production and
program costs. The $1.8 billion program began April 1, 1986, and
lasted for 18 months, with producers themselves paying about a
third of the cost.
   Under the 18-month DTP, which also was called the ``whole-herd
buyout'' program, the department paid participating farmers to
dispose of entire herds, either through slaughter or export, and to
remain out of dairying for five years. More than 1.6 million dairy
cattle were cut from the U.S. herd.
   A report by the General Accounting Office, an investigative
agency of Congress, said earlier this month that the DTP ``will
reduce milk production from 1986 through 1990 by 39.4 billion
pounds below what it would have been without the program.''
   But the GAO report also said that the dairy buyout ``will not
have a lasting effect on milk production.''
   Thus, the report said, ``it is difficult to predict the benefits
or costs of a similar program that might be used to address future
dairy surplus problems.''

<TEXT>
   John F. Kennedy used to say that a rising tide
lifts all boats, but the opposite apparently is not true. A
four-year study by nearly 100 researchers has concluded that when
the tide goes out of the nation's economy, the poor sink fastest
and deepest.
   The experts found that something happened in America about 1973.
The tide reversed. Stagnation set in. The years since have been
rough on Americans at the bottom and in the middle, white or black.
   A generation ago, a man with low skills could easily get a
blue-collar job that paid enough to raise a family. Today, those
jobs, if available, pay poverty level wages.
   Among blacks and whites alike, what is paid to those near the
bottom buys less in 1986 than 1969.
   What's more, ``The poor may be getting poorer in the 1980s: the
average poor family has persistently had a yearly income further
below the poverty line than any year since 1963,'' the report said.
   That's a central finding in ``A Common Destiny: Blacks and
American Society,'' a 600-page report issued this past week by the
National Research Council, an arm of the congressional-chartered
National Academy of Sciences and Engineering.
   The study, its $2.7 million cost mostly absorbed by private
foundations, is billed as the most comprehensive look at the status
of black Americans since the 1968 Kerner Commission report. That
was the one which said America was moving toward ``two societies,
one black, one white _ separate and unequal.''
   But the picture is not all bleak.
   The report concludes that, in fighting poverty, nothing works
like work, and more jobs for the poor are coming.
   ``Economic opportunity alone will not solve all problems, of
course, but it is the essential ground for other constructive
developments,'' it says. ``All the evidence reviewed in this report
points to the central importance of jobs for men and women at pay
levels that permit families to live above the poverty line.''
   Because of population trends, people of working age are becoming
scarce. Employers will have to hire those they now shun. They may
be forced to do what schools and society haven't _ to prepare those
at the bottom for jobs.
   As a result, says study director Gerald Jaynes, a Yale
economist, ``The opportunities for launching a successful
nationwide effort to ameliorate the problems of poverty and
underachievement may in fact be greater now than at any time in the
recent past.''
   Another central conclusion: race relations in American and the
status of blacks are much better than they were before World War
II. But almost all the progress occurred before 1970, especially
during the civil rights revolution of the 1960s and the Great
Society.
   And another: White people, by and large, want black people to
advance _ in principle. That's a giant improvement since the end of
World War II, when most whites were satisfied with the
segregationist status quo. But white people won't put their
principles into practice. They resist integration, especially in
housing.
   And another conclusion, probably controversial: there is no
truth to the belief that poor and segregated people develop habits
and beliefs and values that lock them into poverty.
   The name for that supposed phenomenon is the ``culture of
poverty,'' the assumption that ways of living poor are passed along
from generation to generation so that children know no other way,
have no work habits, develop no ambition.
   People who think a culture of poverty exists say the poor are
self-indulgent, need instant gratification, can't sacrifice or plan
for the future, don't think that education will do them any good.
   Not so, argues the report. Looking at the lives of the poor
shows that ``many are hard-working people who save when they can,
endure numerous deprivations, worry about the future, and urge
their children to do well in school and on the job. ...
   ``Work for pay that will support a decent living standard ... is
a central value among low-income black men and women.''
   And many people move in and out of poverty several times over a
lifetime. If poverty were instilled in them, they wouldn't, or
couldn't.
   So, there's hope, the report suggests. Government programs can
help; changes in behavior by white people toward black people can
help; prosperity can help most.

against being represented by the United Auto Workers, denying the
union a foothold in the nation's fully Japanese-owned auto plants.
   Employees voted 1,622 to 711 against the UAW at Nissan's sole

   The balloting followed an 18-month drive by the UAW and was seen
as a test of union muscle and a challenge to automakers' strategy
of locating plants in the traditionally anti-union South.

<HEAD>Discovery Channel Latest to Scramble Signal</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAY ARNOLD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>

   The Discovery Channel will become the latest
cable TV programmer to scramble its satellite-delivered signal to
fend off video pirates, a company official said.
   The Landover, Md.-based company will begin scrambling its signal
June 30, 1990, said Sandy McGovern, senior vice president of
affiliate sales and relations.
   So-called basic cable services such as CNN Headline News, ESPN
and USA Network already are scrambling their signals, as are pay
cable services such as Home Box Office, Cinemax, Showtime-The Movie
Channel and The Disney Channel.
   Backyard satellite dish owners and cable TV systems must have
proper equipment to decode the scrambled signals.
   McGovern said Thursday the company did not know how much
business it was losing to theft. But she said it counts 43 million
paying subscribers, while the A.C. Nielsen ratings company reports
``a few million'' more homes than that are watching.
   ``So we know there's some fairly significant theft,'' she said.
   Scrambling began in January 1986 when HBO first encoded its
signal. More cable companies followed suit, much to the dismay of
backyard satellite dish owners, many of whom paid about $2,000 for
their equipment.
   Congress passed the Satellite Home Viewer Copyright Act last
year, guaranteeing access to the scrambled signals to backyard dish
owners as long as they have paid for them.
   The law was a boon to a new group of cable TV middlemen who put
together packages of cable channels and sell them to satellite dish
owners for monthly or yearly fees.
   Despite the scrambling, however, the cable industry claims it
still loses millions of dollars to illegal decoding devices.
   The Discovery Channel, which began service in June 1985, offers
non-fiction entertainment in the areas of nature, science,
technology, history and exploration.
   It typically is provided to cable subscribers as part of basic
packages of cable channels, with the cable system operator paying
The Discovery Channel a fee per subscriber.

   Visa cardholders have moved closer to the day
when a single piece of plastic will enable them to conduct nearly
any kind of business, including long-distance calls.
   Visa U.S.A and MCI Communications Corp. announced Thursday that
beginning Oct. 1, Visa card account numbers also will serve as MCI
long-distance calling numbers.
   Holders of Visa cards will be able to call from any telephone in
the United States to nearly anywhere in the world, with monthly
charges billed as one line on their Visa accounts.
   MCI will provide a separate, itemized billing.
   Roger Peirce, Visa's chief operating officer, said the MCI link
``represents a significant market opportunity and moves us closer
to Visa's goal of providing customers one card for all payment
needs.''
   Tim Price, MCI's vice president for sales, said the service will
be phased in over the next 18 months, with participating banks
representing 30 million cardholders scheduled to come into the
system by the end of 1989.
   By the end of 1990, the service will be available automatically
to any Visa cardholder, Price said.
   ``We'll be able to place ads saying `If you have a Visa card you
already have an MCI calling card,'' Price said.
   Major credit card companies already allow callers at some
airport pay phones and airplane phones to use credit cards, in bids
to grab larger shares of the credit business.
   The nation's largest long-distance company, American Telephone &amp;
Telegraph Co., confirmed in May that it was considering converting
its 40 million calling cards into general credit cards.
   The Wall Street Journal reported in May that AT&amp;T had reached an
agreement with Total Systems Services Inc., the nation's second
largest processor of credit card transactions. Total Systems would
not confirm the story.
   AT&amp;T spokesman Herb Linnen said Thursday that AT&amp;T still is
exploring several options, including using the calling card as a
general charge card, but he said no final determination has been
made.
   Bert C. Roberts Jr., MCI's president and chief operating
officer, called the link with Visa ``one of the largest service
integration pacts involving two distinct customer bases and
operating systems.''
   An an incentive to cardholders, MCI will provide new customers
with 30 free minutes of long-distance calls for each MCI calling
service they subscribe to through VisaPhone.
   Cardholders will pay no enrollment or service fees for the
VisaPhone services.
   Initially, the service will be limited to Visa classic, gold and
business cardholders in the United States. Eventually, VisaPhone
will be available to 120 million Visa cardholders in the United
States.

   Interest rates on 52-week Treasury bills fell
in Thursday's action to the lowest level in 13 months.
   The Treasury Department sold $9.04 billion of the bills at an
average discount rate of 7.22 percent, down from 7.58 percent at
the last auction on June 29.
   The rates were the lowest since June 30, 1988, when the one-year
bills sold for 7.04 percent.

_ 7.75 percent with a $10,000 bill selling for $9,270.00.

<HEAD>Progress Reported in Advanced Television, Digital Audio Tape</HEAD>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Progress has been reported in the development of
the next two gizmos in the world of consumer electronics:
high-definition television and digital audio tape.
   Record companies and consumer electronics manufacturers
announced Thursday in London, as expected, that they had agreed on
a system that clears the way for introduction of digital audio
tape, or DAT, players in the United States.
   The players will permit people to make digital copies of music
from sources such as compact disc players, but they will not be
able to make digital copies of the copies.
   That is intended to prevent piracy through wholesale, high-speed
copying of digitally recorded music.
   ``The proposal for a technical restriction on unlimited DAT
copying establishes an important precedent for the protection of
intellectual property,'' Jason Berman, the president of the
Recording Industry Association of America, said in a statement.
   On high-definition television, progress in an interim step known
as advanced television was revealed by NBC, Thomson Consumer
Electronics Inc. and the David Sarnoff Research Center.
   French-owned Thomson, which makes RCA- and GE-branded television
sets, demonstrated the first wide-screen picture tube designed for
advanced television receivers. It said it would invest $75 million
in its Marion, Ind., plant to produce the new wide screens, which
have a 33 percent bigger width-to-height ratio than conventional
sets, as well as bigger conventional screens.
   NBC said it had conducted the first UHF broadcast of an advanced
television signal and the first cable transmission test of the
signal, which it calls ACTV 1.
   NBC also said it plans to test advanced television production
equipment by shooting news and sports _ including a New York Jets
football game this fall.

<HEAD>United, Delta, USAir Profits Rise, Midway Earnings Fall</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   UAL Corp., United Airlines' parent company, said its
second-quarter profit rose nearly 14 percent from a year earlier,
while Delta Air Lines' net income soared 85 percent, boosted by
business it picked up from strikebound Eastern Airlines.
   USAir Group said Thursday its second-quarter earnings rose 9
percent and Midway Airlines Inc. said its net income tumbled 48
percent from a year earlier.
   For the second quarter ended June 30, UAL had net income of $141
million, or $6.52 per share, up from $124 million, or $5.77 a
share, for the same period a year ago. Revenue of the Chicago-based
company rose to $2.5 billion from $2.3 billion.
   The company, which has been the object of heavy takeover
speculation in the stock market during recent weeks, also announced
that its board of directors amended UAL's ``poison pill''
antitakeover plan to make it tougher for a hostile bidder to buy
the company.
   Delta's fourth-quarter profit was $190.8 million, or $3.87 a
share, up from $103.3 million, or $2.11 a share, in the same period
last year. Revenue totaled $2.31 billion, up from $1.9 billion a
year ago.
   USAir reported net earnings of $100.7 million, or $2.29 a share
in the second-quarter, up from $92.5 million, or $2.14 a share, in
the same 1988 period. Revenue rose 16 percent to $1.7 billion from
$1.5 billion last year.
   Midway Airlines' net earnings fell 48 percent to $5.1 million,
or 46 cents a share, in the second quarter from $9.7 million, or 87
cents a share, a year ago. Revenue rose to $126.5 million from
$111.5 million.
   UAL reported higher operating expenses and declines in both
revenue passengers and revenue-passenger miles, resulting in a 1
percent drop in operating earnings.
   Spokesman Rob Doughty said he did not know how the crash last
week of a United jetliner in Sioux City, Iowa, would affect UAL's
third-quarter results. ``There would be expenses, of course, but we
really haven't seen an impact on revenue so far,'' he said.
   UAL's original shareholder rights plan, adopted in 1986, granted
shareholders the right, in the event of a threatened takeover, to
purchase for $185 one one-hundredth of a share of a new series of
junior participating preferred stock and two shares of common stock
for each share of common stock they already owned. The amended plan
changes the common-stock ratio to three for one.
   Such plans typically are used to make a hostile takeover
prohibitively expensive by creating more stock for a suitor to
acquire.
   UAL's stock has risen sharply in the past month on takeover
speculation. Doughty declined to comment on takeover rumors.
   UAL reported a 71 percent drop in net income for the first six
months of 1989 to $206.5 million, or $9.55 a share, from $701
million, or $19.12 a share, in the year-earlier period.
   The 1988 results included a $549 million one-time gain from
UAL's sale of its Westin Hotel Co.
   First-half revenue rose to $4.8 billion from $4.3 billion in
first-half 1988.
   Delta Air Lines said the strike by Eastern Airlines employees,
now in its fifth month, increased business for the Atlanta-based
carrier and contributed to record fourth-quarter earnings.
   ``Traffic in the last four months of the fiscal year was
inflated by a strike against a major Delta competitor, but traffic
also grew strongly in markets not directly affected by the
strike,'' said Thomas J. Roeck, Delta's senior vice president for
finance and chief financial officer.
   Hartsfield Atlanta International Airport was Eastern's largest
hub prior to the March 4 walkout by Machinists, pilots and flight
attendants, and is the center of the Miami-based airline's
rebuilding effort.
   Eastern was virtually grounded during the early days of the
strike by its pilots, flight attendants and Machinists unions.
   For its fiscal year ended June 30, Delta posted a profit of
$460.9 million, or $9.37 a share, up 50 percent from $306.8
million, or $6.30 a share, a year earlier. Revenue rose 17 percent
to $8.1 billion from $6.9 billion in the previous year.
   USAir, based in Arlington, Va., had first-half income of $116.2
million, or $2.65 a share, up 58 percent from year-earlier results
of $73.7 million, or $1.70 a share. First-half revenue rose to $3.2
billion, up from $2.7 billion.
   Strong traffic results by both USAir and Piedmont helped offset
softer yields stemming promotional fares, such as its Kids Fly Free
programs and reduced fares in the California markets, the company
said.
   USAir acquired Piedmont Aviation in 1987 and plans to merge with
the airline on Aug. 5.
   For the first six months of the year, Chicago-based Midway said
its net income grew 83 percent to $8 million, or 72 cents a share,
from $4.4 million, or 41 cents a share. Revenue was 21 percent
higher at $243.7 million, compared with $201.1 million in the 1988
period.

<HEAD>Louisiana Company Cleans Up on Alaskan Oil Spill</HEAD>

<BYLINE>By MARY FOSTER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW ORLEANS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   It's been called ``black gold,'' and for a
little company in Louisiana, the thousands of gallons of oil that
the Exxon tanker Valdez spilled into Alaska's Prince William Sound
have proven to be just that.
   Oil Mop Inc., which makes systems to clean up, soak up and
remove oil from water, says its profits have increased sharply and
that it expects to make $4 million this year, double the 1988
figure.
   It has boosted permanent employees from 15 to 50 and hired an
additional 50 temporary workers, and announced plans to expand its
manufacturing facility by 80 percent.
   ``There's no doubt about it. The cleanup operation in Alaska is
the reason we're booming,'' said General Manager Wallace Landry.
   Exxon disclosed earlier this week that its estimated cleanup
cost for the March 24 spill would total $1.28 billion, making it
one of the most expensive industrial accidents in history.
   The giant oil company said the figure represented the price for
3,000 workers running hundreds of vessels and pumping equipment in
Alaska.
   Landry said Oil Mop is one of at least 100 small companies that
have benefited from the cleanup operation. In Louisiana, where the
depressed oil-based economy has hurt many companies, the spill has
been a boon.
   ``A lot of equipment and people that probably would not be
working right now are employed because of the spill. It will end,
of course, but I would envision staying in a pretty fast-paced mode
for at least another two months,'' Landry said.
   Companies that supply tow boats, pumps and generators, as well
as service and catering companies, are all busy, Landry said.
   Oil Mop, founded in 1970, is not new to the job of cleaning up
major spills. The company helped clean up the Ixtoc I well blowout
on Mexico's Bay of Campeche in 1979, which spewed 100 million
gallons of crude and ranks with the Exxon spill as one of the worst
oil disasters.
   Oil Mop's technicians had to recover diesel fuel from beneath
three feet of ice to clean up a spill in Nome, Alaska. When a
tanker went aground in the St. Lawrence Seaway, the company
recovered 100,000 gallons of oil in seven days.
   The Oil Mop system uses a rope made of a fiber that attracts oil
and repels water. An engine pulls the rope across the water surface
then and between rollers that squeeze the recovered oil into a
container.
   ``It's really simple,'' Landry said. ``The rope goes out for 100
feet or so and then it's pulled back through grandma's old fashion
wringer.''
   The company's manufacturing operation is running three shifts,
24 hours a day, to meet the demand for its products. The fiber is
whirled around special looms to form the mops and then attached to
10 and 15 foot sections of rope. The ropes are then strung together
in 100 foot lengths. Oil Mop is shipping thousands of feet of the
rope mops and dozens of wringer mop engines and wringers to Alaska.
   Oil Mop plans to work in the oil industry program, Petroleum
Industry Response Organization, which is being designed to take
aggressive action in preventing oil spills, responding to oil
spills and conducting spill-related research.
   In addition, the program will provide the equipment in the event
of a major oil spill. The anticipated initial outlay for the plan
will be $70 million to $100 million, plus annual maintenance of
between $30 million and $100 million. Oil Mop expects to get part
of that.
   ``The oil spill business is a funny business. I guess you could
say one company's poison is our meat. We've shown that we can
respond to a client's needs. With the new attention any spill is
going to get, you'd better be able to do that. If you can, it pays
off,'' Landry said.

<HEAD>Chrysler Embarks on $1 Billion Cost-Cutting Plan</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By FREDERICK STANDISH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>DETROIT (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   No part of Chrysler Corp. will be sacred as a
cost-cutting knife carves $1 billion from the automaker's expenses
in the next 15 months, executives say.
   Chairman Lee Iacocca told Chrysler's top 700 managers in a
regularly scheduled meeting Thursday that the company was embarking
on a program that will result, among other things, in a reduction
of its white-collar work force by 8.3 percent, or about 2,300 jobs,
by the end of this year.
   The cuts were mandated by lower-than-expected vehicle sales
levels; rising costs, especially in sales incentives; and forecasts
of a softening economy as the 1990s begin, said Bennett Bidwell,
chairman of Chrysler Motors Corp., the company's vehicle-making arm.
   ``It is not a recession, knee-jerk reaction,'' he said. ``We've
got to get costs out to get competitive.''
   Bidwell said the company has a budget this year of about $26
billion and a $1 billion cut ``is a big deal.''
   Industry analysts had mixed reactions.
   Ron Glantz of Montgomery Securities Inc. of San Francisco
doubted whether much of the cut would show up in Chrysler's profits.
   ``This is an industry that kills to take a dollar out of the
cost of building a car,'' he said. ``Not very much of this
billion-dollar reduction is going to flow to the bottom line. They
are going to have to reduce advertising and marketing, which will
hurt sales.''
   But Scott Merlis, of Morgan Stanley &amp; Co. Inc. in New York, told
The New York Times that the move should boost earnings.
   ``If they can cut $1 billion in a little over a year, that would
be a super achievement, with a profound impact on their bottom
line,'' he said.
   Each of the Big Three automakers has been involved in
cost-cutting programs of some scale. Many of the programs stemmed
from the tough times the companies weathered in the early 1980s.
   The cuts, industry officials and analysts have said, put the
companies in better positions to withstand vehicle sales slumps or
other economic pressures, such as rising interest rates or flagging
consumer confidence.
   At Chrysler, employees 55 years and older with more than 10
years of company service will be offered early retirements and
buyouts to get them off the payroll.
   Bidwell said the personnel cuts will begin in about six weeks,
possibly decreasing white-collar employment levels in some
operations by up to 25 percent.
   ``Nothing is hands off,'' he said.
   Meantime, the company expects to save money through a voluntary
pay-cut plan linked to Chrysler stock prices and progress on the
overall cost-cutting program.
   In essence, the plan would ask 2,000 salaried workers to reduce
their pay 5 percent to 15 percent, with the money going into the
company coffers. The money would be repaid in 15 months on a
sliding scale, linked to the stock price, if cost-cutting reaches
at least half of its goal.
   If the program is less successful than that, the employees would
forfeit the money.
   Bidwell and Chrysler Chief Financial Officer Robert S. Miller
said it was unknown how much money the plan would save Chrysler in
the short term, but it would be in the millions of dollars.
   ``We put this together last night,'' Bidwell told reporters
Thursday afternoon.
   Elsewhere in the corporation, managers were told to tighten some
already tight belts. Bidwell said the company had just conducted a
study of job redundancy and fluff, indicating where savings could
be made.
   The company, whose two other divisions operate financial
services and Gulfstream Aerospace, may cut its advertising,
marketing and sports event promotions budgets, he added.
   ``We've got to go after everything that walks,'' he said.

<HEAD>Paramount Selling The Associates to Ford For $3.35 Billion</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Paramount Communications Inc. has completed its
transformation from a conglomerate to a media company with the sale
of its financial services arm, The Associates, to Ford Motor Co.
for $3.35 billion.
   Paramount said in a statement Thursday the sale would give it an
after-tax gain of $1.3 billion. When the company announced plans to
sell The Associates in April, it said it planned to use the money
to finance acquisitions.
   Thursday's announcement came three days after Paramount, having
failed in its attempt to stop the merger of Time Inc. and Warner
Communications Inc., dropped its $12.2 billion hostile bid for
Time. Paramount said then that it remained committed to expanding
its publishing and entertainment businesses through mergers,
acquisitions, joint ventures or partnerships.
   The purchase marks the latest expansion of Ford's financial
services segment. Ford, the nation's second-largest automaker after
General Motors Corp., owns First Nationwide Bank, one of the
nation's biggest savings and loan institutions. First Nationwide,
with federal assistance, bailed out two failing Michigan thrifts
late last year.
   The Associates is the third-largest independent finance company
in the United States, with assets of nearly $14 billion. It has a
wide range of consumer finance services, and its principal
commercial business is in heavy-duty truck and trailer financing.
   The Associates was the last asset that Paramount _ formerly
known as Gulf &amp; Western Inc. _ put on the block as part of Chairman
Martin Davis' plan to change the company into an entertainment and
publishing empire.
   Gulf &amp; Western embraced a wide variety of businesses when Davis
became chairman in 1983, including sugar, zinc, chemicals, energy
products, race tracks, Kayser-Roth apparel and hosiery, Simmons
bedding and automotive, electronic and construction products.
   Davis pared the company to its core media businesses, among them
Paramount Pictures and Television, and publishers Simon &amp; Schuster
and Prentice Hall.
   The Associates' chairman, Reece A. Overcash Jr., will continue
in that post and will report to Kenneth Whipple, head of Ford's
Financial Services Group, Ford said.

<HEAD>McCann-Erickson Dropped as Ad Agency For Winston, Camel Cigarettes</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SKIP WOLLENBERG</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   In a move to streamline its marketing efforts,
R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Co. fired McCann-Erickson as the advertising
agency for its Winston and Camel cigarette brands in the United
States.
   The tobacco company, based in Winston-Salem, N.C., said Thursday
it was assigning the two brands to two agencies that already handle
other domestic cigarette advertising assignments for Reynolds.
   FCB-Leber Katz Partners, the New York-based agency that handles
advertising for Reynolds' Salem and Vantage brands, has been
assigned the Winston brand.
   Young &amp; Rubicam, another New York agency which handles the More
and Now accounts, has been assigned the Camel brand. The changes
are effective Oct. 30.
   The dismissal came as a surprise to McCann-Erickson, a New
York-based agency that also creates ads for Coca-Cola Co. and
American Telephone &amp; Telegraph Co. Agency insiders said Reynolds
never told the agency it was reviewing the brand assignments before
telling them of the decision Wednesday.
   But Peter J. Hoult, executive vice president of marketing for
Reynolds, said the consolidation of advertising business ``will
allow us to streamline our marketing efforts and to more
efficiently meet our overall objective of strengthening our
cigarette business.''
   The company refused to disclose how much it spends on
advertising either brand, but one industry source said that
advertising spending in the first quarter would extrapolate to
about $45 million for the year. Another source, however, said the
company spent twice that much on the two brands in 1988.
   While the brand reassignments came as a surprise to the
agencies, one advertising executive said changes were expected in
the wake of the massive $24.5 billion leveraged buyout completed
earlier this year of Reynolds' parent, RJR Nabisco Inc. The buyout
by the New York investment house Kohlberg Kravis Roberts &amp; Co. left
RJR with huge debts and new management.
   Betsy Annese, a spokeswomen for Reynolds Tobacco, said the ad
agency shift ``has nothing to do with the LBO.''
   The Winston brand has been losing ground in the battle for
market share in the cigarette business. McCann-Erickson got the
Winston assignment in 1985 and Winston's market share has since
slipped to 10.4 percent from 11.2 percent.
   Each percent of market share is worth about $366 million in
retail sales, Ms. Annese said.
   McCann's most recent campaign approach pitched Winston's
``Winning Taste.''
   McCann developed a hip ``New Joe'' camel figure with the theme
``Smooth Character'' for Camel last year, but the brand has been
mired for the past five years at 4.4 percent to 4.5 percent of the
market. McCann won the Camel assignment in 1983.
   McCann continues to handle foreign cigarette advertising
assignments for Reynolds and handles its domestic direct marketing.
In addition, McCann has advertising responsibilities for other RJR
divisions, including Ritz crackers and Wheat Thins and Del Monte
canned fruits.
   McCann-Erickson's total billings amounted to $675 million at the
end of 1988.
   FCB-Leber Katz Partners, a unit of Foote Cone &amp; Belding
Communications, has had the Vantage ad assignment since the
cigarette was introduced 20 years ago. It received Salem in 1986.
   Young &amp; Rubicam has handled Now and More cigarette advertising
since 1986, and has been running test market advertising for
Chelsea cigarettes since April.
   Reynolds also has a third ad agency, Long Haymes &amp; Carr, which
is responsible for Doral, Magna and the company's special events
advertising.

<HEAD>Commerce Dept. Says Asian Nations Dumping Business Phones Here</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Commerce Department says a preliminary
investigation showed manufacturers in Japan, Taiwan and South Korea
were ``dumping'' small-business telephone equipment in the United
States at prices far below their fair value.
   In a preliminary finding Thursday that could lead to hefty
antidumping duties on these phone products, the department's
International Trade Administration said equipment prices in Japan
were as much as 2{ times higher than the prices being charged in
the United States for comparable equipment.
   The U.S. International Trade Commission in February also made a
preliminary determination that the three nations' practices had
harmed U.S. manufacturers.
   Dumping is a practice in which overseas companies sell their
products in other countries at prices near or below cost in order
to force their way into a market. The difference between the
average domestic and average foreign prices of a product is called
the margin and is expressed as a percent.
   Companies found guilty of dumping must pay the margin in the
form of duties collected by the U.S. Customs Service to bring the
cost of the imported item up to its fair market value.
   The ITA established the following margins for Japanese
companies: Toshiba Corp., 136.77 percent; Matsushita, 178.93
percent and all others, 157.85 percent.
   For Taiwan, the companies and margins were: Taiwan Nitsuko,
129.73 percent; Sun Moon Star, 0 percent; and all others, 129.73
percent.
   For South Korea, they were: Samsung, 9.33 percent; Goldstar,
6.09 percent; and all others, 7.79 percent.
   After notice of the ITA finding is published in the Federal
Register _ a process that may take about five days _ antidumping
duties will be levied on the products.
   But the duties will be held in escrow pending a final
determination by the ITA, which is expected by about Oct. 10, and
pending a separate final determination by the International Trade
Commission.
   The ITC must find that U.S. businesses were injured by the
dumping, and a final determination is expected by mid-November, ITC
spokesman Jim Craig said.
   The U.S. investigation was prompted by a complaint filed in
December by American Telephone &amp; Telegraph Co. and Condial Corp.
   AT&amp;T claimed it and other U.S. phone manufacturers had been
injured by unfair pricing practices of 12 manufacturers in the
three countries.
   AT&amp;T spokesman Herb Linnen said the ITA finding ``represents
major progress on the way to the ultimate result AT&amp;T seeks _ the
elimination of unfair pricing in the United States.''
   AT&amp;T said the foreign manufacturers had captured about 60
percent of the U.S. market for small business phone systems,
growing from about 40 percent in three years. AT&amp;T and its U.S.
competitors claimed their business in that area had declined
dramatically in the interim.
   The ITA said imports of certain small-business phone systems and
subassemblies from Japan in 1988 were valued at $775.7 million;
from Taiwan, $342 million; and from South Korea, $227 million.

   The Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. has been
named managing agent for nine savings and loan institutions,
bringing the total in the government management program to 253 in
33 states.
   The new institutions declared insolvent and placed under
government management Thursday were five in Texas, two in
Louisiana, and one each in Arkansas and Michigan.
   Federal regulators transferred all deposits, offices and
substantially all of the institutions' assets to the newly created
federal mutual institutions.
   Depositors are not affected in any way by the action and can
continue to transact business as usual, federal regulators said in
announcing the action.
   The government management teams work to minimize operating
losses and ensure that the institutions are operated in a prudent
manner. The management teams will supervise operations at the
institutions until Congress approves the funding needed to sell or
merge the institutions.
   Placed in receivership Thursday and issued new charters by the
Federal Home Loan Bank Board were:
   _Capital Savings and Loan Association, West Helena, Ark.
   _Lafayette Savings and Loan Association, Gretna, La.
   _Commercial Federal Savings Bank, Hammond, La.
   _Guaranty Federal Savings Bank, Taylor. Mich.
   _Capitol City Savings Association, Austin, Texas.
   _Federal Savingsbanc of the Southwest, Kilgore, Texas.
   _New Braunfels Savings and Loan Association, New Braunfels,
Texas.
   _Hallmark Savings Association, Plano, Texas.
   _North American Savings Association, San Antonio, Texas.

<HEAD>Larger Soybean Crop Means Lower Grower Prices</HEAD>

   A much larger soybean crop will mean lower
prices for growers but some relief for users, according to a new
Agriculture Department report.
   The department's Economic Research Service said Thursday the
assessment was based on the July 12 estimate of 61.3 million acres
planted to soybeans this year and a projected harvest of 1.95
billion bushels, up 27 percent from 1988 output.
   Analysts said the soybean crush in 1989-90 could climb to 1.115
billion bushels from 1.07 billion expected for 1988-89.
   Soybeans are crushed by processors into high-protein meal for
livestock feed and oil for cooking and other food use.
   ``Exports, too, should rise next year, but at a forecast 600
million bushels will lag the larger volumes of the early 1980s,''
the report said.
   By the end of the next marketing year, Aug. 31, 1990, soybean
inventories are expected to be about 265 million bushels, up from
125 million bushels at the beginning of the season, Sept. 1.
   As a result of the larger crop this year, soybean market prices
are expected to decline to an average of $4.75 to $6.25 per bushel
in 1989-90 from an estimated $7.35 this season.
   The larger soybean crush in 1989-90 ``will allow the United
States to maintain soybean meal exports'' at the current level of
about 5.5 million tons and still meet an expected increase in
domestic demand, the report said.
   Soybean meal prices may drop to an average of $140 to $180 per
ton in 1989-90 from this year's estimated $230 per ton.
   However, burdensome supplies of soybean oil will keep year-end
inventories at above 2 billion pounds for the third straight year.
Domestic oil use has lagged because ``substitute oils have been
widely available and aggressively priced,'' the report said.
   Exports of soybean oil in 1989-90 could be slightly below this
year's 1.43 billion pounds and will be shipped mostly under U.S.
assistance programs.
   Looking at other oilseeds, the report said peanut plantings of
1.68 million acres are expected to produce 4.5 billion pounds of
peanuts this year, up from 1.66 million acres and 3.98 billion
pounds in 1988.
   Domestic food use of peanuts is expected to reach a record of
2.25 billion pounds this season, based on strong increases for
peanut butter and salted nuts, the report said. Peanut exports are
projected at 650 million pounds.
   Sunflower plantings are down 12 percent from last year to about
1.82 million acres. Even so, sunflower seed production is projected
at 1.05 million metric tons (of 2,205 pounds each), up 205,000 tons
from last year's drought-stricken crop.
   Corn oil production for 1988-89 is estimated at 1.5 billion
pounds, up 5 percent from last season, the report said.
   Domestic use is expected to increase 13 percent to 1.2 billion
pounds, but exports are forecast to decline 10 percent to 331
million pounds. Corn oil production in 1989-90 is forecast at 1.55
billion pounds, up 3 percent from this year.

   The Agriculture Department says the war
against foliage-eating gypsy moths has gained in Oregon but has
lost ground in North Carolina and Utah.
   James W. Glosser, administrator of the department's Animal and
Plant Health Inspection Service, said Thursday that Oregon has been
removed from the gypsy moth quarantine list because the pest has
been eradicated from Lane County, which had been the insect's
toehold in the state.
   Federal quarantine regulations restrict the interstate movement
of outdoor household articles _ lawn furniture and certain camping
equipment, for example _ that might harbor moths and spread them to
other states.
   ``Based on treatments and subsequent surveys, we have determined
that (the) gypsy moth no longer occurs in Lane County and that
there is no further need to restrict the movement of outdoor
household articles from this area.''
   Lane County was the only quarantined area in Oregon, so the
state has been removed from USDA's official list of gypsy moth
states.
   Meanwhile, Glosser's agency is designating all or portions of
Currituck and Dare counties in North Carolina as gypsy moth
``low-risk'' areas, thus adding North Carolina to the list.
   Glosser said inspectors have found the counties are infested by
the moths but that the number of egg masses per acre is not high
enough for them to be rated as high-risk areas.
   By agency reckoning, an area is high-risk when it has more than
50 masses of moth eggs per acre.
   Glosser said a portion of Salt Lake County, Utah, is a high-risk
area and that this adds the state to the moth list.

<HEAD>Workers Reject Union Due to Expansion Plans, Honeymoon, Analysts
Say</HEAD>

   Workers at Nissan's Smyrna plant
rejected the United Auto Workers by a 2-1 margin because of
expansion plans and a continuing ``honeymoon'' period with the
company, industry and labor analysts say.
   Nissan Motor Manufacturing Corp. U.S.A. workers voted 1,622-711
to keep the union out, officials announced Thursday. The UAW has
not organized any of the three fully Japanese-owned auto plants in
the United States.
   ``I think there's certain peculiarities to the Nissan situation
that contributed to this vote. The one that stands out is Nissan's
planned expansion, adding 1,800 or so jobs,'' said Harley Shaiken,
a labor relations professor at the University of California at San
Diego.
   ``I think that expansion tends to diffuse some of the
discontent. People who have trouble with their job today can
perhaps look forward to a promotion tomorrow with that kind of
expansion,'' Shaiken said.
   The company recently announced it would expand the capacity of
the plant to 440,000 vehicles a year from the current 265,000,
making it the largest single auto assembly plant in the country.
The plant has 3,200 employees, including 2,400 hourly workers who
were eligible to vote.
   David Cole, an industry expert at the University of Michigan,
said he was surprised by the vote margin, but noted that the plant
opened only six years ago. He said that isn't much time to build
ill will.
   ``There's still a bit of a honeymoon period. ... These plants
are comparatively new, and there's still about a third of the labor
force that's got problems with the system,'' said Cole, director of
the Office for Study of Automotive Transportation at the
university's Transportation Research Institute.
   Worker safety and assembly line speeds had emerged as the two
major issues in the UAW's 18-month campaign to organize the plant
that began making light pickup trucks in 1983. The plant also makes
Sentra cars, and a third _ as yet unannounced _ model will be added
when the expansion is completed in 1991.
   ``I guess the UAW didn't make its case inside the plant. I
imagine they'll keep trying, but if an effort like this fails, they
won't have much luck at other Japanese plants,'' said David Healey,
an analyst for Drexel Burnham Lambert in New York.
   Wages at the Nissan plant in Smyrna range from $11.10 to $15.74
an hour plus $1.45-an-hour guaranteed bonuses. Other bonuses are
tied to quality and financial performance. That is slightly lower
than wage rates at UAW plants, but the cost of living is low in
central Tennessee.
   Many workers at the $760 million plant 25 miles southeast of
Nashville have embraced the company's Japanese-style management, in
which they have a say in production and the shop floor is organized
into teams whose members rotate tasks as often as every two hours.
   Worker Redgie Gentry said a union would have been an end to the
teamwork.
   ``It was like someone was trying to divide our family,'' he said.
   The UAW accused Nissan of misrepresentation and intimidation to
keep out the union, including ``captive audience'' meetings and a
barrage of anti-union videos.
   In a statement, UAW President Owen Bieber and other union
officials said the election demonstrated that when a company was
``willing to use threats and misrepresentation to an unlimited
extent, that company can delay if not escape its day of reckoning.''
   Jerry Benefield, president of Nissan Motor Manufacturing U.S.A.,
denied the charges.
   ``I think the results of this election are very strong support
for the participatory management philosophy here at the company and
we're very happy we're going to continue that,'' Benefield said.
   Nissan offers many benefits not seen in many manufacturer
workplaces.
   Workers can lease Nissan cars and trucks at a discount; exercise
at a fitness center and a recreational facility that includes
tennis courts, a golf driving range and swimming pools; and put
away tax-free dollars in a 401(K) plan in which the company matches
employee contributions.
   Some analysts said the vote will keep the union out for some
time, but Cornell University labor relations professor Harry Katz
didn't think so.
   ``The UAW says you can get the flexibility with the cooperation.
But they've got to convince management to make that choice. So I
don't think they're doomed,'' Katz said.

<HEAD>House Committee Votes Restrictions on Cellular Phone Tax Writeoff</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: also on general news wires.</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   House tax-writers are looking no farther than
the halls outside their closed meeting room to find $5 million a
year for a new tax break for a few corporations.
   The target: the cellular telephone favored by the lobbyists,
accounting firm representatives, paralegals and even a few of the
reporters who fill the halls any time the Ways and Means Committee
considers tax legislation.
   The committee, still adding pieces to a catchall tax bill that
originated as a deficit-reduction measure, voted Thursday to make
it more difficult to claim a tax deduction for cellular phones.
   Present law permits a partial writeoff for depreciation of
cellular phones used partially for business. Thus, if a lawyer uses
a phone 30 percent of the time for business, 30 percent of the cost
may be deducted.
   Committee aides said there is evidence some corporations and
individuals abuse the deduction by claiming personal calls as a
business expense.
   Under the committee amendment, no deduction will be permitted
unless more than 50 percent of the use is for business; the user
will have to keep records to substantiate the use. The same rule
already applies to cars and personal computers.
   The restriction was approved to pay for an amendment by Rep. Guy
Vander Jagt, R-Mich., that would save money for a few U.S.
corporations whose income is earned entirely in a foreign country.
Because the government is out of money, the panel requires that any
new tax cut be offset by a tax increase on somebody else.
   Vander Jagt's amendment was one of several added to a proposal
by Chairman Dan Rostenkowski, D-Ill., that simplifies the corporate
minimum tax. That levy was created to ensure that profit-making
corporations pay some tax even if their deductions and credits are
big enough to wipe out their regular liability.
   In another voice vote Thursday, the committee added to the bill
a permanent extension of the Reagan-era Caribbean Basin Initiative,
which temporarily granted tariff-free treatment of certain imports
from that region. The proposal also extends the preferential
treatment for the first time to apparel and other textile products.
   The CBI changes would guarantee that Caribbean countries would
be able to export as much sugar to the United States as they are
allowed to under existing quotas this year. Any reduction in total
U.S. imports of sugar would have to be borne by nations outside the
Caribbean.
   Meantime, Rostenkowski continued to delay a vote on reducing the
tax on individual capital gains. A majority _ 13 Republicans and
six Democrats _ of the panel supports a temporary reduction in the
tax, which applies to stocks and other assets.
   President Bush has called for a cut to spur the economy and to
raise revenues. Most Democrats oppose the cut on grounds it would
lose money after a year or two and because 80 percent of the tax
cut would go to those with incomes above $100,000 a year.
   Rostenkowski and House Speaker Thomas S. Foley have been
appealing to fellow Democrats to oppose a reduction. But as a
fallback, the two leaders are weighing a counterproposal that would
continue taxing capital gains at the same rates that apply to wages
and other income but to ``index'' capital gains so that profits
caused solely by inflation are not taxed.

<HEAD>Consumers Groups: Eastern Airlines Ticket May Be No Bargain</HEAD>

   Eastern Airlines says concerns expressed by
consumer groups that the carrier is using inexperienced pilots and
scheduling phantom flights are silly.
   Jim Ashlock, a spokesman for the strike-bound airline, dismissed
questions raised Thursday by three national consumer groups and
said the airline is following all Federal Aviation Administration
requirements in rebuilding its service.
   Public Citizen, the Airline Consumer Action Group and the
National Consumer League accused Eastern of hiring too many
inexperienced pilots, scheduling ``phantom flights'' that never
take off, generating excessive complaints and failing to give
refunds.
   ``The bottom line is that the flying public has a right to know
what's going on _ that they may be flying with an inexperienced
crew, that they are not getting much of a bargain flying Eastern,''
said Linda Golodner of the consumer league, a private non-profit
membership organization that promotes consumer and worker welfare.
   She endorsed a nine-page statement by Public Citizen, which
takes pro-consumer stands on a wide variety of issues, and the
airline consumer group.
   ``We're providing information travelers have to take into
account to decide for themselves whether to fly Eastern,'' said
Cornish Hitchcock, spokesman for Public Citizen.
   He said a major concern was that some Eastern flights would use
both an inexperienced pilot and copilot in the same cockpit,
contrary to FAA recommendations that at least one pilot have more
than 100 hours of experience on the type of aircraft to be flown.
   ``These are the silliest things I've ever heard,'' Ashlock said.
   Eastern planned to increase from 225 to 390 daily flights Aug.
1, but Ashlock said from Miami that the number would be held to
about 350 until mid-August because of the inability to get enough
pilots through training.
   Before the strike began March 4, the airline flew about 1,000
flights a day.
   Ashlock acknowledged that the airline has ``zeroed out'' some
scheduled flights by stopping ticket sales, but he said it was only
done to protect consumer on flights where crews likely would not be
available.
   He said the high number of complaints recorded by the
Transportation Department in a report earlier this month does not
reflect current problems but stems from the immediate aftermath of
the strike when Machinists, pilots and flight attendants walked off
the job, leading the airline to file for reorganization under
bankruptcy laws.
   The bankruptcy court has power over ticket refunds, Ashlock
said, adding that the airline is following all FAA requirements in
training and assigning pilots.
   ``We wouldn't want to break any FAA rules and we couldn't if we
did want to,'' Ashlock said.
   Hitchcock, at a Public Citizen news conference, said passengers
should be aware that a bankruptcy court decision earlier this month
setting up a $5 million reimbursement fund for travel agents may be
acting as an incentive for agents to sell Eastern tickets.
   The agreement, he said, requires that Eastern increase the fund
only if agents sell more than $3.6 million in Eastern tickets each
week.
   ``From a passenger's standpoint ... this agreement raises
serious conflict of interest issues,'' Hitchcock said.

   Sen. Howard Metzenbaum's recipe for better
health has one major ingredient: a heaping measure of accurate
nutritional information.
   ``For far too long, we Americans have been shopping in the
dark,'' the Ohio Democrat said Thursday as he and other lawmakers
joined together to support the proposed Nutrition Labeling and
Education Act.
   ``Today we're here to shine a little light on the food that
lines our supermarket aisles.''
   The bill comes as food companies try to attract an increasingly
health-conscious American public with products that are labeled
``lite'' or ``cholesterol free.''
   Hearings on the proposed legislation will begin next week before
the House subcommittee on health and the environment.
   Metzenbaum said the mandatory uniform labels required by the
bill would eliminate what ``are at best confusing _ at worst,
downright deceptive'' labels voluntarily provided by many food
manufacturers and processors.
   About 55 percent of food includes some nutritional labeling.
   ``This bill will, in a sense, give us a stomach-impact
statement,'' said Rep. Jim Cooper, D-Tenn. Product labeling, he
said, is a decade behind in giving consumers the kind of
information they want.
   The legislation has the support of 23 nutrition and health
organizations, including the American Heart Association, Center for
Science in the Public Interest, American Cancer Society, American
Dietetic Association, American College of Physicians, and Public
Voice for Food and Health Policy.
   Representatives from most of the groups appeared at a Thursday
news conference, praising the bill for recognizing longstanding
scientific research and educational efforts linking nutrition with
deadly illnesses such as heart disease and cancer.
   Ellen Haas of Public Voice for Food and Health Policy, a
nutrition advocacy group, said the legislation would refocus
emphasis on food contents such as fat, sodium and cholesterol and
would give the consumer more understandable information.
   The Grocery Manufacturers of America, which represents 140
national brand food manufacturers, ``strongly supports efforts to
comprehensively reform and standardize health and dietary
information which appears on food labels,'' said spokesman Jeff
Nedelman.
   But he said the bill had ``no provision to mandate national
uniformity,'' and would instead set specific requirements and put
restrictions on the information that must be made available. He
also said it would not allow enough flexibility in labeling to
account for future changes in scientific information.
   Karen Brown, a spokeswoman for the Food Marketing Institute,
said her group had not examined the proposal but agreed that it was
time to reexamine how nutritional information is provided.
   The bill would:
   _Make nutrition labeling mandatory on processed food sold in the
United States.
   _Require disclosure of certain essential pieces of information,
including the amount of fiber, fat, type of fat and amount of
cholesterol.
   _Use recommendations from the National Academy of Sciences to
improve the format of labels and provide comparative context for
the information.
   _Provide clear and definite standards governing claims and
statements involving such terms as ``lite'' and
``cholesterol-free.''
   Metzenbaum criticized the Food and Drug Administration for
moving slowly on the issue.
   Sen. John Chafee, R-R.I., echoed that concern in a written
statement supporting the bill. He said it had been 16 years since
any fundamental change had been made in the way foods are labeled.
   Other cosponsors of the bill are Democratic Reps. Joe Moakley of
Massachusetts and Dan Glickman of Kansas.

   Shortly after noon on the second day of the
National Candy Wholesalers Association's summer convention, sugar
shock hit and the guy in the big M&amp;M costume started to look fuzzy.
   No thanks, no mas, enough already. No more chocolate bars,
gumdrops, gumballs, rock candy, licorice sticks, fudge, toffee
crunch, jelly beans, peppermint creams, caramel-coated popcorn,
Moon Pies or Mellow-Munchies.
   Take away your heart-shaped Valentine's Day boxes, your Count
Dracula treats for Halloween, your chocolate Easter bunnies. Get
thee hence, Garbage Can-dy, Heavenly Passion and Pee-Wee's
Playhouse Fun Paks.
   Glucose levels were going through the roof of the Washington
Convention Center when the semiannual confab of 6,500 candy
wholesalers got into full swing Thursday. At midday, sales people
began tempting passersby with heaps of sweets, chewing gum and
munchies at 630 booths covering the floors of two large exhibition
halls.
   Other conventioneers swarmed through the ``sample room'' filling
small paper tote bags with goodies while a tape-recorded voice
repeatedly urged guests to exercise restraint. ``Thank you, and
have a sweet tooth,'' the voice said.
   The hottest items on the market this year seem to be gummy bears
_ a chewy confection long popular among European children _ upscale
``gourmet'' chocolates from such exotic locales as Belgium, and
bubble gum that looks like pizza, served in a tiny Domino's Pizza
box.
   For the health-conscious, there is tofu chocolate (``non-dairy,
no white sugar, no cholesterol''), granola bars and ``high-fiber''
candies coated with yogurt.
   For those who don't care, there are white chocolate lollipops in
the shape of big-bosomed blondes and ``shelf-stable'' cotton candy
in cardboard Ringling Bros. and Barnum &amp; Bailey circus wagons.
   Licorice comes in vines, ropes and twists. Popcorn comes in
barbecue, nacho and jalapeno flavors. Kids' candies come in toy
light bulbs, water pistols, skeletons, skulls, rockets, whistles,
snakes, UFOs, spaceships and parachute jumpers.
   Two of the oldest candy brands in America _ both introduced in
1912 _ are still on the market, according to industry historians.
They are the Nut Goodie bar, made by Pearson's of St. Paul, Minn.,
and the Goo Goo Cluster manufactured by Standard Candy Co. of
Nashville, Tenn.
   Association president Ernest D. May, a candy packager and
distributor from Grove City, Pa., said the $9.6 billion candy
business is growing steadily after a slump in the 1970s caused
partly by high sugar prices and a stagnant population in the
biggest candy-buying age bracket, 15 to 30.
   Consumption had risen to 19.3 pounds of candy per capita last
year, and May says the wholesalers' goal is 25 pounds for every
American man, woman and child by 1995.
   ``It's a real challenge but I think it's reachable,'' May said
in an interview. ``The future is bright.''
   After gummy bears, what fantastic new candy treat is next?
   ``If I could answer that,'' he replied, ``you and I could both
retire.''

   Federal regulators and the manufacturer of DC-10
jets have rejected a call by an airline passengers group to ground
the aircraft to check for structural problems following last week's
deadly plane crash in Iowa.
   The International Airline Passengers Association said Thursday
it wants the Federal Aviation Administration to order the planes
out of use in the wake of the July 19 crash of a United Airlines
DC-10 in Sioux City, Iowa, that killed 111 people, said spokesman
Daniel Smith.
   Citing the crash, Smith said it is evident that the aircraft's
hydraulic systems, necessary for flight control, do not work and
the systems need to be separate.
   In a letter to FAA chief James Busey in Washington, IAPA said it
wants to ``first, find out what's wrong with the aircraft; and
secondly, get it fixed.''
   Although IAPA has not ruled out court action, the group, which
claims 110,00 members around the world, said it hopes the plane
will be grounded without having to resort to legal means.
   Jay Leyden, a FAA spokesman in Washington, rejected the demand.
   ``There's nothing that's come out of the Sioux City accident
indicating a basic design flaw that would warrant such an action,''
Leyden said.
   Also on Thursday, eight days after the Iowa DC-10 accident, a
Korean Air DC-10 crashed short of a fogbound airport in Tripoli,
Libya, killing at least 75 people. But a spokesman for the South
Korean embassy there said no mechanical problem was reported before
the crash.
   McDonnell Douglas, maker of the DC-10, held a news conference at
the Long Beach headquarters of Douglas Aircraft to denounce the
IAPA's call to ground the aircraft.
   ``I find it difficult to believe that a rational public, a
rational FAA and even a rational Congress will put very much
credence in the statements of the IAPA,'' said Dale Warren, a
McDonnell Douglas vice president.
   ``The real concern, in my opinion, is that we worry about the
credibility of our aircraft to the traveling public,'' Warren said.
   Nevertheless, Warren said, engineers are studying the crashes to
determine whether a design modification is needed.
   ``It would appear at this time that some action is
appropriate,'' Warren said.
   Changes under consideration are additional backup controls, ways
of containing the damage from a jet engine explosion and methods of
shielding the hydraulic system from such damage.
   An initial investigation of the Iowa crash indicates that an
explosion in the plane's tail-mounted engine threw pieces of the
turbine through the tail section, rupturing at least two of the
three hydraulic lines.
   McDonnell Douglas technical experts have been sent to Tripoli in
hopes of assisting in the investigation of the Korean Air crash
there, Warren said.
   He said there are no indications to link the two recent crashes
other than the make of the aircraft.
   After a DC-10 crash in Chicago in 1979, the IAPA won a federal
court order grounding the DC-10 fleet for more than a month while
inspections were performed on some parts of the aircraft.
   IAPA then had asked the FAA to separate the hydraulic systems of
the aircraft.
   In all, Smith said at least 17, or 3.8 percent, of the 445
DC-10s built have been wrecked because of their problems, a higher
percentage of flaws than Boeing 747s or Lockheed L-1011s.

<HEAD>No Scrap Parts Were Used in United DC-10 Engine, GE Says</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: also on general news wires.</HEAD>

<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>EVENDALE, Ohio (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   General Electric Co. says the engine that
apparently failed in a United Airlines jet crash in Iowa could not
have been made with scrap parts from an Air Force plane.
   Dwight Weber, a spokesman at the GE plant in suburban Cincinnati
that built the DC-10's three CF6-6 engines, on Thursday rejected a
suggestion by Rep. John Dingell, D-Mich., that GE may have used old
parts in new production engines.
   ``The parts Dingell refers to, we can categorically say, were
not used in the Flight 232 engine,'' Weber said. ``GE does not use
recycled parts in new production engines. However, repaired parts
are commonly used in overhauled engines.''
   Dingell, in a letter Wednesday, asked the Federal Aviation
Administration to investigate whether scrap parts were used in the
tail engine of the United jet that crashed July 19 at Sioux City,
Iowa, killing 111 people.
   Dingell chairs a House Energy and Commerce subcomittee that
oversees such investigations.
   Weber said the fan section parts of the engine that failed on
United Flight 232 are not interchangeable with fan parts from the
GE-manufactured TF-39 engine which powers the Air Force's C-5A
aircraft.
   ``The TF-39 parts wouldn't fit in the CF6-6,'' Weber said.
   GE said the CF6-6 engine, produced from 1971 to 1981 for use
specifically on DC-10 series 10 craft such as the crashed United
jet, has established a reliable safety record during 17 million
hours of commercial flight.
   Dingell's letter asks a response from the FAA by Aug. 4. Dingell
told reporters Thursday in Washington that he is not making
allegations against manufacturers, but wants a government
assessment of the issue.
   ``We're simply following up on an inquiry we made to the FAA
several years ago in which we asked them to look into the problems
of spare parts. We have no information, and are making no
allegations, about the behavior of any manufacturer,'' Dingell said.
   National Transportation Safety Board investigator Jack Young was
at GE's Evendale plant Thursday to examine GE's manufacturing
records for the No. 2 engine of Flight 232. Federal investigators
want to know why the engine's fan section disintegrated about 45
minutes into the flight from Denver to Chicago, NTSB spokesman Ted
Lopatkiewicz said. The NTSB investigation was to continue today.
   Lopatkiewicz said wreckage of the engine is to be transported,
probably next week, from the Iowa crash site to GE Evendale for a
thorough, tear-down examination under NTSB supervision.
   Lopatkiewicz said the No. 2 engine's fan section was missing
from the wreckage.
   Weber also said a different generation of GE's CF6 series
engines powered a Korean Air DC-10 jet which crashed early Thursday
in heavy fog short of the airport in Tripoli, Libya, reportedly
killing at least 75 of the 200 people on board. The Korean plane
was powered by GE's CF6-50 engines, a higher-thrust model which
entered commercial service in October 1972, Weber said.

<HEAD>Ford, GM Point to Incentives For Earnings Dip</HEAD>
<HEAD>With PM-Chrysler Cuts, Bjt</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The nation's two largest automakers in part
blamed their own costly incentive programs for shaving profits in
the second quarter.
   General Motors Corp. and Ford Motor Co. on Thursday reported
earnings slipped 3.9 percent and 15.6 percent, respectively,
compared with the year-ago period.
   ``With all the incentives and the slower sales in the United
States, it was anticipated,'' said analyst Joshua Harari of
Standard &amp; Poors Corp. of New York.
   As the quarter began, both companies broadened their incentive
programs, featuring higher cash rebates and lower financing rates
than previously offered.
   The incentives continued through the quarter and could run at
least through the end of the model year, usually noted on Sept. 30.
   Chrysler Corp., which has rebates or low-interest financing
deals on nearly all of its cars and trucks, is scheduled to
announce its second-quarter results on Monday.
   GM earned $1.45 billion, or $2.23 a share, during the three
months ended June 30, compared with $1.51 billion, or $2.26 a share
during the same time last year.
   GM's revenue, including sales by the GM Hughes Electronics
Corp., Electronic Data Systems Corp. and General Motors Acceptance
Corp. subsidiaries that reported earnings Wednesday, rose 1.3
percent during the quarter to $33.6 billion, from $33.18 billion
last year.
   Ford reported it earned $1.4 billion, or $3 a share, compared
with $1.66 billion, or $3.43 a share in the second quarter last
year.
   Ford's revenue rose to $25.9 billion during the quarter, from
$24.96 billion in the same period last year.
   Earnings from Ford's financial services group fell 19.9 percent
to $173 million, due to lower net interest margins, the company
said.
   Ford's U.S. profits softened due to expensive incentive programs
and reduced profit margins, said David McCammon, the company's vice
president for finance and treasurer.
   He said incentives during the second quarter cost Ford between
$600 and $700 a vehicle, up sharply from the $200 to $300 average
cost per vehicle during the previous quarter and the second quarter
of last year.
   GM spokesman Terry Sullivan said per-car incentive costs for the
quarter were unavailable. However, GM spent about $715 per car last
year on incentives and said costs for the programs would be higher
this year, he said.
   Chrysler Motors Corp. Chairman Bennett Bidwell, who oversees the
company's vehicle-making arm, said the nation's No. 3 automaker
spends about $700 per vehicle in incentives.
   The buyer enticements are a double threat to automakers'
profits. When sales slump, profits generally do, too. To boost
sales and profits, companies take a gamble by offering incentives
that are costly in the short-term but designed to produce more
buyers in the long-term.
   But when interest wanes, as recent sales declines apparently
indicate, returns on incentive costs may come later, if at all, and
that cuts into short-term profits.
   GM's domestic car and truck sales through the first half of this
year were 7.7 percent behind last year's pace, and Ford's were down
by 3.6 percent.
   Both Ford and GM reported increased profits in their overseas
operations.
   ``They both had good first halves of the year in Europe,''
Harari said. ``This plays an important part in supporting their
earnings _ it has for the last two years.''
   For the first six months of the year, GM earned $3.01 billion,
or $4.60 a share, up 15.7 percent from $2.6 billion, or $3.82 a
share, during the first six months of last year. Revenue during the
January-June period rose to $59.63 billion, from $56.34 billion.
   Ford's earnings for the first half of 1989 fell 7.6 percent to
$3.04 billion, or $6.45 a share, from $3.29 billion, or $6.74 per
share, a year earlier. Revenue rose to $51.76 billion, from $48.15
billion.
   GM and Ford said they were continuing cost-cutting programs.
Also on Thursday, Chrysler announced a cost-cutting program aimed
at carving $1 billion from its $26 billion budget during the next
15 months. Cuts will come from all operations, included about 2,300
salaried employees who will be taken off the payroll.

<HEAD>Margin Rules: SEC Report Reopens Debate Over Index Futures</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN M. DOYLE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A debate is heating up again over margins, the
amount of money investors must put up to buy stock index futures
contracts, and whether they cause sharp market fluctuations because
they're too low.
   At issue is how much money or collateral investors must deposit
with brokers when buying or selling futures contracts tied to the
rise and fall of stock indexes such as the Standard &amp; Poor's
500-stock index.
   A futures contract is an agreement to buy or sell a specific
amount of a commodity or financial instrument at a set price for
future delivery. The collateral used in buying futures contracts
and other commodities and securities is known as a margin.
   On Thursday, an SEC report to a House subcommittee considering
legislation to reform the securities industry expressed concern
that low margins ``may lead to market volatility in the future.''
   In the stock market, which is regulated by the SEC, investors
must put up at least 50 percent of a security's value. But in
commodity markets, which buy and sell stock index futures, the
margin requirement is a fraction of that, about 5 percent for
speculators and 2.5 percent for hedgers.
   Critics say volatility _ like the wave of selling thta occurred
during the 1987 market crash _ scares investors away from the
market. Others maintain that sharp price movements are a problem
only when prices are dropping.
   The SEC report said that during the Oct. 19 crash, low stock
index futures margin requirements contributed to sharp price
movements.
   ``Aside from the direct impact on market volatility, low stock
index futures margin can contribute to disruptions for market
systems and participants during periods of short-term volatility,''
said the report, prepared by the SEC's division of market
regulation.
   But commodity exchange officials in Chicago said the SEC was
comparing apples and oranges.
   ``Margins on futures and margins on securities are not
comparable,'' said Andrew A. Yemma, a spokesman for the Chicago
Mercantile Exchange, where futures tied to the S&amp;P 500 are traded.
``Margins on stocks are a downpayment of a purchase of an asset.
Margins on futures are deposits on a binding contract to perform.''
   At the Chicago Board of Trade, which trades stock index futures
based on the Major Market Index of 20 blue chip industrial stocks,
spokesman Mark Prout noted that larger traders can post margins as
low as 10 percent.
   The SEC long has sought to raise the levels of futures contracts
margins. Last May, SEC Chairman David Ruder recommended lifting
margins to 20 percent or 25 percent of contract value.
   But the exchanges in Chicago, Kansas City and New York that deal
in stock index futures are regulated by the Commodity Futures
Trading Commission, which lets the exchanges set margin limits.
   A CFTC spokeswoman, who did not want to be identified, said
Ruder was the only member of a four-person presidential panel
appointed to investigate the 1987 crash that believed high margin
levels would reduce volatility.
   ``There's no proof of this,'' she said, adding that the CFTC
``believes that higher margin levels will raise transaction costs
and will have a negative effect on liquidity and efficiency.''
   The SEC report came in response to a request from Rep. Edward J.
Markey, D-Mass., chairman of the House Subcommittee on
Telecommunications and Finance.
   The report also said there was a correlation between volatility
and computerized program trading, although it could not prove one
caused the other.
   Program trading, the rapid, computer-driven buying and selling
of baskets of stocks, was considered a key factor in the crash.

   Stock prices were higher at midday Friday with the
market still encouraged by Wall Street's gain in the previous
session and healthy futures-related buying.
   Many traders said they expected a fresh wave of buying after
Wall Street opened and after a new trading account opened later in
the session. London's Stock Exchange divides trading into two-week
and three-week periods for accounting purposes.
   At midday, the Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index

   McCaw Cellular Communications Inc.
officials say they have lined up $2.5 billion in financing to
finance its $5.6 billion bid for LIN Broadcasting Corp.
   A statement issued by McCaw, based in this Seattle suburb, said
the investment firm Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. said it was
confident the money could be raised ``either privately or publicly
in today's capital markets.''
   The deal is ``a key element of our overall $5.6 billion
financing plan,'' said Peter L.S. Currie, McCaw senior vice
president for finance, ``and we remain highly confident as well
that we will complete arrangements for the balance of the financing
on a timely basis.''
   Meanwhile, LIN released an exchange of letters Thursday between
McCaw Chairman Craig O. McCaw and LIN, indicating the two companies
remained at odds on the takeover bid.
   McCaw, the nation's largest cellular telephone company in terms
of ``pops,'' a measurement of market potential, is offering $110
for each LIN share, while LIN management is seeking $127.50 a share.
   At $127.50 a share, the buyout would value the New York-based
cellular telephone, television broadcasting and publishing company
at nearly $6.9 billion.
   McCaw already owns 5 million of LIN's 53.9 million shares.
   McCaw initially offered $120 a share, which LIN rejected as
inadequate. The offer was lowered to $110 after a court ruling that
went against LIN concerning cellular operations owned jointly by it
and Metromedia.
   On July 13 a joint statement said a buyout for $127.50 a share
in cash and stock was under negotiation, but McCaw withdrew from
those talks last week and extended its $110-a-share tender offer.
   On Tuesday, LIN Chairman Donald A. Pels said he would support a
McCaw buyout offer of no less than $127.50 per share if a
definitive agreement were reached by Monday.
   McCaw replied in the letter that he was still willing ``to
entertain a price above our current offer,'' but ``the
inflexibility of your requirements ... has made it impossible to
reach a definitive agreement.''

<HEAD>Payoff of Sears New Strategy is Slow in Coming _ As Expected</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARYBETH NIBLEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Anyone searching through Sears, Roebuck and
Co.'s latest financial results for clues about the success of its
new retail strategy should remember one thing. Giants usually don't
move quickly.
   ``It's not something that we're going to see in a quarter or two
_ just because of the amount of change that has to occur,'' says
retail analyst Linda R. Morris of PNC Financial Corp.
   Karen Sach of Standard &amp; Poor's Corp. offered a similar
assessment after Sears, the nation's biggest retailer and also a
power in financial services, released its second-quarter earnings
figures last week.
   ``It's going to be awhile before we see any turnaround in the
merchandising group,'' says Ms. Sach. ``That's something that's
maybe a year down the road. I didn't expect anything fantastic this
soon.''
   At first glance, Sears' stats looked attractive:earnings grew
21.4 percenton a 9.2 percent revenue gain. Earnings in the quarter
ended June 30 rose to $391.2 million, or $1.11 a share, from $322.2
million, or 85 cents a share, a year earlier. Revenue rose to
$13.28 billion from $12.16 billion.
   But two special factors inflated the figures.
   The $69 million earnings increase included a $54.9 million gain
from the sale of the commercial division of the Coldwell Banker
Real Estate Group, counted as a discontinued operation. Earnings
solely from continuing operations declined to $334.9 million from
$338.3 million.
   For the merchandise group, which accounts for the bulk of the
corporation's business, a change in the method of accounting for
inventory added $21.9 million to earnings. The group's earnings
totaled $161.6 million in the second quarter vs. $157.6 million in
1988.
   If not for the one-time gain from the change in accounting
procedures, the Sears Merchandise Group would have had an earnings
decline.
   Despite expectations for a slow revival in its core retailing
operation, securities analysts aren't raising red flags of warning
about holding Sears' stock.
   This is partly because its financial services divisions, such as
the Discover credit card, Allstate insurance and Dean Witter
Reynolds investment unit have been doing well and should continue
to do so.
   For another thing, the retailing giant could end up clobbering
the competition if its new everyday low-pricing policy and other
new marketing tactics produce the desired benefits.
   Ms. Sach says it will take time to re-educate Sears' customers
and persuade them that they don't have to wait for sales _ they can
come into stores any day and pick up bargains.
   Sears hasn't abandoned special markdowns completely. Since the
March introduction of ``everyday low prices'' it has run several
``this week only'' promotions and other campaigns advertising
extra-low prices on certain items.
   These special promotions might confuse customers who may think
they'd be better off delaying purchases at Sears in hopes of lower
prices to come, some retail analysts say.
   Some of the changes at Sears have hefty price tags that will
probably impair earnings for awhile. But they are intended
eventually to yield significant savings and enhance profits.
   ``There are short-term negatives that hopefully will turn into
long-term positives,'' said Ms. Morris, citing severance pay to
departing employees whose jobs were eliminated as part of Sears'
restructuring and the cost of relocating the merchandise group out
of downtown Chicago to a nearby location.
   Many aspects of Sears' new strategy have yet to be put fully in
place. More name-brand merchandise is appearing gradually in Sears
stores, an addition that Sears and industry analysts expect will
boost business, for example.
   Sears and its rivals may all face a tough time if an economic
downturn causes consumers to shut their pocketbooks. Low-to
moderate-income consumers, who typically shop at discounters _ may
be the first to react in a recession.
   ``It just seems to me that this group is usually the one with
very little savings, living pay check to pay check and they're the
ones who get concerned about the economy first,'' says Ms. Morris.
``You really start to pull back and you don't take that weekly trip
to Sears or K mart to see what you need.''

<HEAD>Judge Approves Raise For Wheeling-Pitt Employees</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PITTSBURGH (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A federal bankruptcy judge approved a 50-cent
hourly pay increase for 5,000 union employees of financially
troubled Wheeling-Pittsburgh Steel Corp.
   But Judge Warren Bentz said Thursday that he found the motion
requesting the pay hike ``offensive'' because it referred to the
company's recent profitability. He noted that there are about $1.2
billion in bankruptcy claims ``on which not a nickel has been
paid.''
   Union employees, who haven't had a wage hike in a decade, make a
minimum of $9 an hour.
   Bentz initially threatened to tie the wage increase to a
two-month deadline for the company and creditors to submit a final
plan of bankruptcy reorganization. The steelmaker filed for Chapter
11 protection from its creditors in 1985.
   ``How soon can I get a plan finalized,'' he asked company
attorneys. ``Why can't you do this in two months?''
   A major issue in the reorganization is a new labor agreement
with the United Steelworkers to replace one that expires 10 days
after the company emerges from bankruptcy court protection.
   The union has insisted it could not negotiate a new contract
until a long-running dispute is resolved with the federal Pension
Benefit Guaranty Corp.
   But Bentz said that issue, which is before U.S. District Judge
Paul Simmons, could take years to solve.
   ``You'll have the same uncertainties a year from now, two years
from now,'' he said. ``You might as well get on with it.''
   Paul Whitehead, an attorney for the union, said the interim
raise was requested after the USW learned the company was granting
merit pay increases of about 5 percent to salaried employees.

<HEAD>Asset-Backed Bonds: Growing Market For Repackaged Debt</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BART ZIEGLER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   From boat loans to credit-card accounts, it
seems like almost any type of bank debt these days is fair game for
repackaging by financial experts, who then resell it at a markup to
other investors.
   The debt is ``securitized,'' or restructured in the form of
bonds, and peddled in the credit markets in what has turned into a
multibillion dollar business.
   It works like this: Say a bank has a bunch of loans on its books
that it wants to get rid of so it can meet net capital requirements
and loan more money. The bank creates a trust and ``sells'' these
loans to the trust.
   The trust then turns the debt into bonds for sale to investors.
When the monthly payments on the original loans come in, some of
the money is passed on to the trust, which in turn gives some of it
back to the bond investors as interest.
   Along the way, the bank and the underwriter, often a Wall Street
investment house, take a cut in the interest paid on the original
loans, so that the investor in the securitized bonds may see a
yield of 9 percent or so while the bank may be receiving 19 percent
on the loan payments.
   To be fair, not all the interest rate spread is profit for the
bond issuers. Some must be used to buy letters of credit that
insure the bondholders will be paid even if there are defaults by
loan-holders, some represents reserves against such bad debt, and
some represents processing costs.
   Still, it's a pretty neat deal for everyone involved. The bank
gets unwanted loans off its books, investment houses have a new
profit generator, and investors have a place to put their money
that yields more than Treasury bonds but is rated almost as safe.
   No wonder the market for these ``asset-backed'' bonds has
boomed. Though the market originated in mortgage-backed securities
in the 1970s, the first of the new-wave, non-mortgage issues came
to market in March 1985, according to Merrill Lynch &amp; Co. Since
then, more than $44 billion in such bonds has been issued, Merrill
Lynch said.
   Until the past few months, all asset-backed bonds were aimed at
institutional investors, such as insurance companies and pension
funds. The minimum investment required was in the millions of
dollars. But with the introduction of two new credit card-backed
bonds, small investors can now take part.
   The first of these issues was introduced in May by Citicorp. The
bonds are backed by payments on the big bank's credit card accounts
and sold in chunks priced at $1,000 each.
   These bonds have been dubbed ``plastic bonds'' from the nickname
for credit cards. They were priced to yield about 9 percent _ far
less than the 19.8 percent Citicorp charges in interest on the
credit cards themselves, but more than Treasuries. They are rated
``AAA'' by the credit rating agencies.
   The Citicorp bonds hold the potential for this interesting
scenario: Some of the investors buying the bonds are most likely
among the 600,000 Citicorp MasterCard and Visa card holders
creating the debt in the first place. So, in effect, these
investors are getting back some of the interest they pay on their
credit card accounts through the yield on the bonds.
   The second asset-backed bond issue aimed at individual investors
came out last month and is backed by Sears, Roebuck and Co. credit
cards. Both have been well-received, said Ira Weiss, who helps
manage the marketing of these issues for Merrill Lynch.
   ``Sales have been gratifying,'' he said. ``The yields are more
attractive than what they can find in alternative investments of
the same quality.'' In addition, he said, investors receive a
monthly interest payment, a convenience unavailable from other
bonds.
   Merrill Lynch, which helped underwrite the Sears and Citicorp
bonds, plans to market more credit-card bond issues to small
investors later this year, Weiss said.
   He said credit-card issuers and other credit-creating
institutions will most likely jump at the chance to exploit this
new market for asset-backed securities.
   ``They have enormous amounts of assets on their balance sheets
that they'd like to securitize,'' he said. ``It's in its infancy.''
   Clifford Griep, a managing director at Standard &amp; Poor's Corp.,
sees the same future for the institutional market.
   ``The market is still assimilating the technology and I think
we're in a pretty rapid growth phase here,'' he said.
   S&amp;P predicts the public market for asset-backed bonds will top
$20 billion this year.

<HEAD>Japan's Current Account Surplus Falls 33 Percent</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Rapidly rising imports pushed Japan's current
account surplus down in June for the fourth consecutive monthly
decline from year-earlier levels, the Finance Ministry reported
Friday.
   The ministry said the surplus for the month was $4.12 billion,
down 33 percent from the $6.12 billion registered a year earlier.
   The imbalance in the current account, which includes merchandise
trade and other financial flows, was up from $3.39 billion in May,
it said.
   The trade surplus followed the same pattern, falling to $6.44
billion from $7.39 billion a year earlier, but rising from $5.06
billion in May, as measured when contracts were settled.
   Finance Ministry officials said imports were sharply higher than
a year earlier due to continuing strong domestic economic demand.
They said imports of manufactured goods were particularly brisk.
   On the other hand, exports of some products, including steel and
automobiles, fell short of year-earlier levels, the officials said.
They said political unrest in Beijing in June, which disrupted
China's economy, may have had a bearing on the relatively sluggish
export performance.
   Steel and auto industry associations have said the turmoil in
Beijing hurt Japan's shipments of steel and motor vehicles to China.
   Imports climbed 12.8 percent from the year-earlier level to
$15.8 billion dollars, while declining 2.7 percent from May.
Exports grew a modest 3.9 percent from a year earlier to $22.3
billion while rising 4.4 percent from May.
   After seasonal adjustment, the current account surplus came to
$2.92 billion, down from $3.36 billion the preceding month.
   Officials attributed the growing deficit in services to a surge
in the number of Japanese tourists traveling overseas to capitalize
on the yen's strength.

<DATELINE>PITTSBURGH (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Westinghouse Electric Corp. says a new
configuration of electronic circuitry holds promise as an
all-in-one radar system that will take up less space on Stealth
aircraft and offer advantages in other settings.
   ``This is kind of a leapfrog. This is the wave of the future,''
said Donald K. Alexander, manager of antenna design and development
at the Westinghouse Electronic Systems Group in Baltimore.
   On the heels of a $2 million defense grant, Westinghouse on
Thursday unveiled a project that's been in the works secretly for
the last three years. The company hopes to succeed in stacking
wafers of microcircuits and connecting them into one system that
would replace several bulkier and heavier radar systems.
   The six-month grant is the first installment from the Defense
Advanced Research Projects Agency, which is expected to contribute
a total of $9.2 million over two years. Westinghouse had been
developing the wafer radar with its own money and assistance from
McDonnell-Douglas Aircraft Corp.
   A single wafer radar system would be able to watch for aircraft
or missiles, follow them and map terrain and control weapons,
functions now performed by separate systems with separate antennas.
   A combined radar system would have a special value in the
Stealth program because of the nature of the radar-defeating planes.
   ``The one thing you don't want to do with a stealthy airplane is
cut holes in it for additional systems,'' Alexander said.
   Stealth technology relies in part on smooth, uninterrupted
surfaces of uniform material to slip undetected through the probing
electronic beams of surveillance radar.
   Other applications for the new radar include lightweight space
communications, smart weapons control, portable and mobile ground
communications and submarine radar.
   Like today's most sophisticated radar, the integrated wafer
circuitry is made of gallium arsenide, which conducts electricity
much faster than silicon. Gallium arsenide circuits are also
resistant to radiation.
   The biggest drawback of gallium arsenide chips is that they are
harder to make. Westinghouse said it has demonstrated manufacturing
techniques that will help overcome the production problems.
   The defense grant covers the design and fabrication of prototype
wafer components. The next steps would be to produce a useable size
antenna and demonstrate it. Full-scale application might be six to
10 years away, Alexander said.

<HEAD>MAI Basic Four Won't Extend Deadline to Take Prime Computer</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By EVE EPSTEIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   MAI Basic Four Inc. announced it is backing off
its $1.1 billion attempt to take over Prime Computer Inc., but is
still vying for Prime's minicomputer business.
   MAI said in a statement it would allow its tender offer to
expire at midnight Thursday. MAI said it had ``concluded that it
could not obtain extensions of its financing commitments ...
because of the frequent changes which have occurred in Prime's
estimates and projections.''
   However, the announcement did not end the battle for Prime. J.H.
Whitney &amp; Co., which has agreed to buy Prime for $1.2 billion, has
been unable to complete its offer because of two lawsuits and
financing problems.
   Whitney announced today it was extending its offer until Aug. 4.
   MAI offered $19.50 in cash for about 75 percent of Prime's
shares and a package of bonds and preferred stock for the rest.
   J.H. Whitney, the nation's oldest venture capital firm, has
offered $21.50 a share in case for about 50 million Prime shares
and would exchange notes for the rest.
   Spokesmen for Prime and Whitney said they had no comment on
MAI's announcement.
   Prime stock rose 50 cents to $16.25 a share in New York Stock
Exchange trading Thursday.
   Stephen K. Smith, an analyst with PaineWebber Inc. in New York,
said the continued uncertainty over Prime's future was hurting the
company, but predicted J.H. Whitney would still come out the victor.
   ``Just the fact that these things are dragging on so long are
dragging them down,'' said Smith. ``We still feel Whitney will come
through.''
   The J.H. Whitney bid has been delayed by a suit brought by Prime
bondholder Conarb Partners seeking to extend the deadline for the
offer.
   U.S. District Court Judge David Edelstein denied Conarb's
request for a temporary restraining order on Thursday, J.H. Whitney
said in a statement.
   Theodore Altman, an attorney for Conarb, said news that Whitney
needed additional financing for a merger with Prime sparked the
suit. ``We weren't fighting for anything but more information,'' he
said.
   Conarb Partners holds bonds that can be converted into Prime
stock.
   Prime faces a lawsuit from a Miami-based company seeking to stop
a merger with J.H. Whitney, according federal court documents.
   United Trust Fund Inc. filed suit against Prime July 21 over a
lease agreement with Prime's wholly owned subsidiary,
Computervision Corp., saying Prime had agreed it would not enter
any merger that would decrease its net worth below $250 million
according to the suit filed in U.S. District Court in Boston.
   In an order issued Wednesday, U.S. District Judge Joseph Tauro
said he would only rule on an injunction seven days before the
proposed merger between Prime and J.H. Whitney.
   Two banks also have asked J.H. Whitney to obtain additional
financing before they will back the friendly buyout of Prime.
   Prime, based in Natick, has about 11,000 employees. It makes
minicomputers and is the second to International Business Machines
Corp. in the computer-aided design and manufacturing systems field.
MAI Basic, of Tustin, Calif., is about one-quarter Prime's size.

<TEXT>
   A clash between Eastern Airlines pickets and newly
hired pilots resulted in a striking pilot's arrest and a Machinists
leader being placed in handcuffs.
   The pilot was charged with disorderly conduct Thursday after a
melee in which Eastern pickets claimed they were threatened with
guns by people they believed to be strike-breaking pilots.
   Pilots union spokesman Hank Weber said 30 to 40 strikers were
picketing early Thursday outside the Doral Country Club and Hotel,
where some pilots hired by Eastern during the strike are being
housed, when people in two cars waved revolvers at them.
   In the second incident, Weber said, pilots stopped the car and
one pilot kicked in its door before it sped away. He said picketers
turned the car's license tag number over to police.
   Pilot John Sorensen was charged with disorderly conduct and
Frank Ortis, vice president of Machinists Local 702, was handcuffed
but released without arrest after talking with police.
   Eastern spokesman Robin Matell said the company was still
gathering information.
   Separately, Weber said the pilots want a trained National
Mediation Board mediator, not bankruptcy examiner David Shapiro, to
oversee contract talks. Eastern on Wednesday withdrew its request
that the Bankruptcy Court terminate the pilots contract and
suggested Shapiro serve as mediator.
   ``Eastern may want that, but we need a trained mediator,'' Weber
said.
   The pilots had asked for an NMB mediator and reported no
progress after talks last week under Shapiro's auspices. Eastern, a
unit of Texas Air Corp., filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy
reorganization March 9, five days after the Machinists struck when
mediation failed and the pilots and flight attendants unions joined
the strike.

<HEAD>Sales Of DAT Players May Proliferate Soon</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID THURBER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Widespread sales of digital audio tape (DAT)
recorders may begin next year under a new agreement between
international record and electronic industry groups, officials said
Friday.
   DAT machines can make high-quality sound recordings using the
same digital technology as compact disc (CD) players. But their
introduction has been slowed by opposition from record companies,
who feared they would encourage pirating and cut into CD and record
sales.
   In a pact announced this week, record and audio industry groups
agreed on a new worldwide standard for DATs that clears the way for
widespread marketing but limits the machines' ability to make
repeated copies of CDs and other recorded material.
   Industry officials said it would take a minimum of eight to nine
months before new DAT recorders are introduced and marketing begins
in countries such as the United States because of the time needed
for design and government approval.
   ``It will require new integrated circuits. You will not see a
machine coming out from my company this year,'' said a Sony Corp.
spokesman, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
   DAT players currently are being marketed in Japan and some parts
of Europe. The more than 10 Japanese electronics firms that produce
most of the world's DAT equipment have refrained from actively
selling the machines in the United States because of opposition
from the U.S. record industry.
   DAT players combine many of the technologies used to make
videocassette recorders and compact disc players. U.S. electronics
companies have largely abandoned the manufacture of both products,
and therefore are unlikely to make DATs.
   DAT is not expected to become a serious threat to the thriving
compact disk industry until the price of DAT recorders and tapes
comes down. The least expensive DAT models in Japan currently cost
about $800, while one-hour tapes sell for considerably more than
$10.
   Both prices are expected to fall substantially as production
increases due to economies of scale, Hata said.
   Kinji Kawamoto, general manager of Panasonic's Audio and Video
Research Laboratory, said the pact would have ``virtually no
effect'' on DAT production costs. ``It will only involve a slight
redesign of the semiconductor chips controlling logic functions,''
he said.
   Included in Friday's agreement were the Recording Industry
Association of America, the International Federation of the
Phonographic Industry, and Japanese and European electronics makers.

<HEAD>Checchi Completes Northwest Airlines' Parent Takeover</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ED STYCH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MINNEAPOLIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An investment group led by Los Angeles
businessman Alfred Checchi says it has completed its $3.6 billion
tender offer and appeared to have won control of NWA Inc., the
parent of Northwest Airlines.
   But Checchi's victory Thursday was soon followed by a worsening
of labor problems at the nation's fourth-largest airline. Northwest
and its pilots union announced that 28-month-long talks on a new
contract had broken down.
   The union said it would seek binding arbitration from the
National Mediation Board.
   Checchi's group, Wings Holdings Inc. said it accepted for
purchase all duly tendered shares of NWA common stock, and that it
now controlled 99 percent of the company's common shares.
   As of May 31, NWA had 29.4 million shares outstanding. The
$121-per-share takeover offer expired at 5 p.m. EDT Wednesday.
   ``We are delighted to have completed this acquisition,'' Checchi
said in a statement released in New York. ``Now we can get on with
the real job which is continuing to build Northwest over the long
term.''
   He said the new owners hoped to double the company's revenue
over the next five years, while improving service and assuring
harmonious relations between management and employees.
   Mark Daugherty, an analyst for Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. in New
York, was wary about NWA's prospects.``If you're looking at the
future of the company, I'd be very worried,'' he said.
   Daugherty said Checchi's buyout plan, which includes $700
million in cash and $3.35 billion in financing, is risky because
the airline industry is capital intensive, volatile and cyclical.
   ``If I were a pilot or any other employee, I would be very
concerned that my company would have to support this debt burden,''
he said.
   Checchi has said fears about debt in the deal are ``almost
laughable.''
   ``The amount of debt in this proposal is not the least bit
excessive,'' he said last month.
   The pilots' union and another analyst say they also don't fear
the debt.
   ``I don't think the man is foolhardy,'' said Kevin Murphy, an
analyst with Morgan Stanley &amp; Co. in New York. ``It provides a lot
of debt, but who cares if it's a private company?''
   Murphy noted that Checchi already has passed several checkpoints
designed to make sure he can continue to provide the service,
safety and growth Northwest has in the past.
   But he also said Northwest's ticket prices may increase to pay
for the debt.
   Steve Arnold, a spokesman for the 5,000-member Air Line Pilots
Association local at Northwest, said the union became less
concerned about the debt level after reviewing Checchi's plan
earlier this year.
   ``While his debt is a concern to us, we feel he can accomplish
what he says he can do,'' Arnold said.
   Northwest's talks with the pilots recessed due to what was
called a dispute over pay issues.
   Rich Siakel, a spokesman for the pilots, said some progress had
been made until Thursday, ``and today apparently everything went
sour.'' The pilots made a counterproposal on pay issues to which
Northwest would not respond, he said.
   Alan Muncaster, Northwest's vice president for corporate
communications, said several key issues had been resolved:
pensions, work rules and job security.
   But ``some big dollars'' still separate the two sides on wages,
health insurance for retirees and a special payment fund for
pilots, he said.
   The National Mediation Board must decide whether to grant the
pilots' request for arbitration. If Northwest rejected arbitration,
a 30-day cooling-off period would begin, after which the pilots
would be free to strike and the company would be free to impose its
latest offer.
   Although Checchi has become Northwest's new owner, a few more
steps must be taken to make the change formal.
   The merger of NWA with a subsidiary of Wings must be consummated
and Wings needs an operating permit from the U.S. Transportation
Department, which is conducting a financial fitness review of the
new owners.

<HEAD>Consumer Spending Unchanged in June</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: also on general news wires.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARTIN CRUTSINGER</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Consumer spending was unchanged in June,
turning in its weakest performance in nine months, while personal
incomes rose a modest 0.3 percent, the government reported today.
   Both figures provided further evidence of an economy that is
beginning to slow significantly. Consumer spending, because it
represents two-thirds of total economic activity, is closely
followed by economists for warning signs of a possible recession.
   Many economists are predicting, however, that consumer spending
will rebound somewhat in the second half of the year because of a
belief that recent moves by the Federal Reserve to lower interest
rates will spur home sales and purchases of big-ticket items such
as autos.
   Consumer spending stayed at an annual level of $3.44 trillion in
June after a modest increase of 0.2 percent in May. The June
performance was the weakest since spending actually fell by 0.1
percent in September 1988.
   These figures are calculated in current dollars. If inflation is
factored out, spending was even weaker, edging down 0.1 percent in
June after falling 0.2 percent in May. It was the first
back-to-back declines in inflation-adjusted spending since
September and October of 1987.
   The rise in personal incomes of 0.3 percent followed an even
smaller 0.2 percent increase in May. It left incomes at an annual
level of $4.41 trillion in June.
   The key category of wages and salaries rose by 0.5 percent in
June after showing essentially no change in May.
   On the spending side, purchases of durable goods, items expected
to last three or more years, fell by $1.7 billion, following a $9.6
billion decrease in May. Much of this weakness reflected a slump in
car sales.
   Purchases of non-durable goods edged up $400 million following a
much bigger $4.9 billion rise in May, an advance propelled in part
by higher costs for gasoline and food.
   Purchases of services were up $2.5 billion following a giant
$12.7 billion jump in May. The May increase had been attributed to
a sharp rise in electricity purchases for air conditioning because
of hot weather.
   Disposable, or after-tax incomes, climbed by 0.6 percent in June
following a 0.8 percent May advance.
   The personal savings rate _ savings as a percent of disposable
income _ climbed to 5.9 percent in June, the highest level since
March when it was at 6.2 percent. In April, the savings rate took a
nosedive to 4.9 percent as Americans had to write checks to pay off
their federal tax bill.

<TEXT>
   WINSTON-SALEM, N.C. (AP) _ After a long engagement between two
original puddle-jumpers, one of the biggest airline marriages will
take place Aug. 5, when Piedmont Airlines assumes the name of
suitor USAir Group Inc.
   The union will create an airline that employs more than 48,000
people operating a fleet of 426 jets in 36 states, two Canadian
provinces, the Bahamas and Britain.
   Figures compiled by the Air Transport Association in Washington
show the combined operations would rank USAir as the seventh
largest in terms of capacity. The two airlines flew more than 59
million passengers last year.
   The courtship between USAir and Piedmont was brief and
expensive, and came at a time when the airline market was becoming
carnivorous. USAir bought Piedmont for $1.59 billion cash.
   ``Piedmont folks expected people would have to spend a heck of a
lot of money,'' said Dan Brock, vice president of marketing
services for USAir and former senior vice president of marketing
for Piedmont.
   ``There was a strong feeling of self worth,'' he said. ``We knew
we were good, and we wanted to be good. I don't think it surprised
anybody that we went for such a big price.''
   The USAir-Piedmont merger reflected a broad move throughout the
deregulated airline industry to gain strength through size. Delta
Airlines bought Western Airlines, Texas Air acquired People Express
and Eastern, Northwest Airlines bought Republic Airlines, and Trans
World Airlines bought Ozark Airlines.
   TWA also had wanted to buy USAir, making the Piedmont purchase
more important to USAir's struggle to retain its identity.
   Piedmont employees are expected to miss their own identity,
established by the company 41 years ago when it began flying out of
Winston-Salem with small noisy prop-planes. But Brock said Piedmont
isn't moving into hostile territory.
   ``It is a marriage to a partner who is so similar to us,'' Brock
said. ``We have had to struggle. So have they. We began with a role
of flying from small cities to big cities, and USAir was much the
same. We were lucky to be acquired by someone so much like us.''
   ``Employees felt a sense of loss, from the sense that (Piedmont)
was more than just a company,'' he said. ``The company was, and in
a sense still is, a family.''
   The employees have had 2{ years to adjust to the idea of merging
with USAir, which is headquartered near Washington.
   ``(Company officials) didn't want to rush into the merger,''
Brock said. ``They wanted to plan it out, get the issues behind us,
and know where we were going.''
   At a hangar at the Smith-Reynolds Airport in Winston-Salem,
workers who wore Piedmont patches toiled in the weeks before the
merger to remove the Piedmont name from jets and replace it with
the red and blue USAir logo.
   By Aug. 5, Piedmont's logo will be history.
   In 1978, when deregulation of the airline industry began, the
logo represented one of only a few airlines serving the small
Southeastern towns that other carriers decided to skip. Piedmont's
main competition was USAir.
   Rather than leave these small towns, both airlines chose to
branch out and fly elsewhere as well, as deregulation allowed them
to do.
   ``Our job had been to feed these people to other airlines in
major cities,'' Brock said. ``With deregulation, we could start
trying to feed ourselves.''
   Merger talks began as early as 1986 when Piedmont Chairman
William Howard held the first of several discussions with USAir
Chairman Edward Colodny. Later, the bids began coming.
Norfolk-Southern Corp., in February 1987, offered $1.49 billion, or
$65 a share for Piedmont. The Norfolk, Va.-based transportation
company already owned 19.5 percent of Piedmont's stock.
   USAir offered $71 a share, with half the 23 million outstanding
common shares to be purchased in cash and the rest exchanged for
USAir stock.
   Piedmont wanted cash, USAir wanted Piedmont, so USAir came back
with an all-cash agreement of $69 a share. Piedmont accepted the
deal in March 1987, the U.S. Transportation Departmer approved it a
half-year later, and the planning for a smooth merger has been
under way since.
   Piedmont was founded by Thomas H. Davis, who bought the
controlling interest in a flying service and renamed it. Two
twin-engine DC3s were purchased and another was leased, and the
first Piedmont flight departed at 7:05 a.m. on Feb. 28, 1948.
   Davis, 29, along with company officers and one paying passenger,
Bill Turner, a Shell Oil employee, were on the flight from
Wilmington, N.C., to Cincinnati, with five stops in between. The
entire trip took about 5{ hours.
   Piedmont's schedule in the early years shows why it acquired the
puddlejumper image, even though the carrier began flying to Los
Angeles and London in the mid-1980s.
   In the first year of business, Piedmont stopped in places like
Bluefield, W.Va., Goldsboro, N.C., and Lynchburg, Va. Passengers
could fly one way from Winston-Salem to Roanoke, Va., for $13.85.
The most expensive flight went between Morehead City, N.C., and
Chicago, and cost $52.25.
   The final Piedmont flight will leave Dayton, Ohio on the night
of Aug. 4, and will arrive at South Bend, Ind. No special ceremony
is planned.
   But after Aug. 5, at least one Piedmont policy will be continued
_ a full can of Coca-Cola will be part of the in-flight services.
   ``That's one of the things many people were quite concerned
about,'' Brock said.

   Americans are more concerned by the economic
threat from Japan than by the military threat from the Soviet Union
by a 3-to-1 margin, a new poll indicates.
   In the poll for Business Week magazine, 68 percent of
respondents named Japan as the bigger threat to the future of the
United States, while 22 percent named the Soviet Union and 10
percent rated them equal or were not sure.
   Sixty-eight percent felt American companies' troubles exporting
to Japan were partly the result of unfair Japanese barriers, while
57 percent said American products were too expensive and 38 percent
said they were not as good as Japanese products.
   Pollsters mentioned proposals that might ``make the Japanese
markets more receptive to this country's products.'' Seventy-nine
percent favored requiring that a certain amount of U.S. products be
allowed into Japan; 61 percent favored higher tariffs on imports
from Japan; 69 percent favored a limit on imports from Japan; and
59 percent favored restricting the flow of technology from the
United States to Japan.
   The poll of 1,250 adults was connected July 7-11 by Louis Harris
&amp; Associates. Results should be accurate to within 3 percentage
points.

   Grain and soybean futures prices were mostly
lower in early trading today on the Chicago Board of Trade,
reflecting forecasts for scattered showers this weekend in the
Midwest.
   Further selling stemmed from disappointment that Thursday's
modest rally in the corn and soybean markets was not stronger.
Analysts said traders who bought following Monday's steep decline
had been hoping for a much bigger rebound.
   Predictions for isolated showers in the Corn Belt promise
further improvement in the corn and soybean crops, which have
benefited from near-perfect growing conditions in the last two
weeks.
   ``The sentiment is pretty negative,'' said Joel Karlin, research
analyst with Research Department Inc. in Chicago.
   In early trading, wheat was 1\ cents lower to { cent higher with
the contract for delivery in September at $3.88} a bushel; corn was
\ cent to 1{ cents lower with September at $2.32\ a bushel; oats
were 1 cent to 2 cents lower with September at $1.41 a bushel;
soybeans were 1{ cents lower to { cent higher with August at $6.66{

   Cattle futures were slightly lower while pork futures were
modestly higher in early trading on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.
   Live cattle were .02 cent to .15 cent lower with August at 72.50

August at 83.05 cents a pound; hogs were .03 cent to .55 cent
higher with August at 46.35 cents a pound; frozen pork bellies were

<TEXT>
   A federal bankruptcy judge today
ordered a trustee be appointed to identify assets of convicted bank
swindler Marvin Warner that could be sold to pay off creditors who
claim they are owed a total of $4.5 billion.
   Refusing to grant Warner's request for more time to organize his
affairs, U.S. Bankruptcy Judge George L. Proctor set a hearing Aug.
25 on motions in the case.
   Daniel Bakst, a West Palm Beach attorney, was appointed trustee
by the U.S. Trustee's Office to examine Warner's holdings and
lawsuits against him before deciding what to do with his assets.
   Warner withdrew his latest plan to emerge from protection from
his creditors Thursday after all but one of the unsecured creditors
rejected it. He asked today for another 30 days to develop a new
plan, but Proctor moved the case from Chapter 11 reorganization to
Chapter 7 liquidation instead.
   Among the secured creditors is Home State Savings Bank of
Cincinnati, which is owed more than $275 million, according to
court records. Warner was president of the bank prior to its
collapse in 1985.
   American Savings &amp; Loan Association of Miami, where Warner
served as a director, also is listed among the unsecured creditors.
It is suing Warner for breach of fiduciary duty and claims to be
owed $316 million.
   Warner, who now lives in Ocala, claims his estate is worth $2
million to $3 million, although creditors' attorneys hope to
include another $30 million to $40 million that creditors allege
Warner fraudulently transferred to members of his family.
   According to documents filed by attorneys representing Warner's
creditors, he transferred $500,000 in diamonds and $3.6 million in
cash to his wife.
   He also transferred 168 acres at his Ocala horse ranch to his
son and $4.2 million worth of thoroughbred horses to Fred M. Cone,
his trustee, court records allege.
   Warner filed for reorganization under Chapter 11 of the U.S.
Bankruptcy Code in October 1987. He listed $4.5 billion in debts
and later claimed $20 million in assets, although creditors say the
amount is higher.
   His filing followed the collapse of Home State in March 1984,
which lost $144 million in investments arranged by Warner with ESM
Securities Inc., a security trading company in Fort Lauderdale, Fla.
   Warner is appealing his 1987 Ohio conviction of illegally
funneling Home State Funds to ESM. He was sentenced to 3{ years in
prison and ordered to pay $22 million in restitution.

<HEAD>Lawyers of Commodities Traders Summoned In Anticipation of Indictments</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Lawyers representing commodities traders have
been asked to meet today with top U.S. Justice Department officials
before indictments are sought charging traders with cheating
customers, published reports say.
   The Chicago Tribune said up to 50 traders could be hit with
charges that they engaged in illegal practices at the Chicago Board
of Trade and the Chicago Mercantile Exchange. Unidentified sources
quoted by The Wall Street Journal said the number of traders ranged
from 10 to more than 20.
   The charges would be the first from a two-year investigation of
the nation's largest futures exchanges in which FBI agents
infiltrated the trading floors to gather evidence on suspected
corrupt practices.
   Indictments could come as early as next week, unidentified
sources told both papers.
   Their number and timing could depend on the outcome of the
closed-door meeting where prosecutors will begin unfolding their
case. Defense lawyers are expected to try to convince them not to
seek charges against clients under the federal Racketeer Influenced
and Corrupt Organizations Act, known as RICO.
   Under RICO, convicted traders could lose their exchange seats
and any assets judged to have been acquired through illegal actions.
   Federal prosecutors typically call in individual defense lawyers
on the eve of major indictments for one-on-one negotiations to seek
cooperation in exchange for reduced charges.
   But such a large meeting is unusual, the Tribune said, noting
that at least a dozen defense attorneys have been invited and the
Justice Department has flown in its top RICO expert.
   The attorneys invited to meet with prosecutors represent clients
who were told two weeks ago that they had 14 days to decide to
cooperate with the government or face a racketeering charge, the
newspaper said.
   The Journal noted that the Justice Department could name the
futures trading pits as ``racketeering enterprises,'' an unlikely
and unprecedented step.
   Not only would such action damage the image of the exchanges,
the paper said, it would allow traders to be indicted and tried
together even if they did not trade with each other.

   The Exxon Corp. promised today to pursue the
cleanup of oil-contaminated beaches in Alaska into 1990 if directed
by the U.S. Coast Guard, saying it would go along with any
``reasonable request.''
   W.D. Stevens, president of Exxon Co. USA, told a House
subcommittee the oil company stands behind earlier pledges to
return to the contaminated shoreline next spring ``to reinspect the
area to assure the job has been properly done, and if not, to put
it right.''
   Stevens said ``we intend to more than achieve'' cleanup
objectives by mid-September and the company intends to go ahead
with plans to demobilize most of its operation then for the winter.
   Coast Guard Vice Adm. Clyde Lusk said the contaminated areas
would be surveyed in the spring and if additional work needs to be
conducted Exxon would be told to resume cleanup efforts. But Lusk
suggested if Exxon disagrees, the government's only option is to
federalize the effort and assume resposibility.
   Lusk said he had ``no doubt'' that during the spring survey
there will be ``disagreeements on what should be done.''
   When pressed by subcommittee Chairman George Miller, D-Calif.,
on what Exxon would do if the Coast Guard demanded additional
cleanup actions, Stevens stopped short of committing the company to
complying with any Coast Guard directive.
   ``We will follow through on any reasonable request that is
made,'' said the Exxon executive. He said he could not make ``an
unequivocal commitment'' and told the hearing he ``would be naive
to do that'' in light of expected disagrements within the
scientific community on what should constitute a clean horeline.
   Concern about Exxon's cleanup plans arose this week after
disclosure of an internal company memorandum that implied Exxon
will not commit itself to further cleanup efforts next spring.
   The memo said current activity to clean oil from an estimated
700 miles of shoreline along southern Alaska resulting from the
Exxon Valdez spill will stop Sept. 15 because of oncoming cold
weather.
   Stevens said the wording of the memo ``was unfortunate'' and
under questioning from Miller, said it was not meant to suggest
Exxon was pulling out of the cleanup effort after September.
   Miller said the focus of the hearing before the House Interior
subcommittee on water power and offshore energy resources was
amined at determining Exxon's future cleanup plans and what actions
the U.S. Coast Guard intends to take should Exxon not pursue a
cleanup.
   In separate testimony, Dennis Kelso, Alaska's commissioner of
environmental conservation, criticized Exxon's decision to pull its
heavy equipment back to Anchorage for the winter, saying there
would be no way to launch emergency response efforts should new oil
slicks threaten key fishing areas.
   ``Anchorage by road is about six hours from Valdez across two
mountain ranges,'' said Kelso.
   The Coast Guard has overall federal authority over the cleanup
effort and subcommittee members are looking for an assurance that
it will force Exxon to pursue the cleanup into 1990 if necessary.
   Most environmentalists believe the cleanup will be far from
completed by mid-September, although Exxon officials have said they
continue to expect to ``stabilize'' the contaminated areas by that
time.
   Exxon said earlier this week it expects the cost of the cleanup
from the March 24 tanker spill in Prince William Sound to soar to
as much as $1.25 billion, making it likely the most expensive
industrial accident in U.S. history. That figure does not include
possible compensatory or punitive damage claims.
   The cleanup of the many miles of shoreline has become much more
difficult than many had anticipated, as areas of beaches have been
partially swept of oil by streams of high-pressure heated water
only to become soiled by oil days later.
   Disclosure of the July 19 memo prompted a storm of criticism.
Alaska Gov. Steve Cowper reminded reporters that Exxon had promised
to stay until the cleanup job was done. ``It's not enough to
declare victory and go home,'' the governor said.

   Stock prices soared to a new post-crash high
Friday as strong speculative interest, a firm showing on Wall
Street and a the start of a new trading account period encouraged a
flurry of buying interest.
   The Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index ended up 22.3

early low of 2286.2 recorded at the opening.
   Dealers said the market's upward move featured a buying squeeze
on several lines of stock. ``No one wants to sell at the moment and
the institutions are still buying strongly,'' one trader said.
   Dealers also had expected Wall Street to open slightly lower but
it moved ahead and the London market followed.
   Most dealers expect the market to rise higher in the near-term,
unless institutions find an excuse to start selling. London's Stock
Exchange divides trading into two-week and three-week trading

   Volume was 585.7 million shares Friday, up from 481.3 million

<HEAD>Era Ends in Spanish Markets On Eve of Market Reform</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By FRANCISCO CONDE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MADRID, Spain (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An era came to an end for Spain's
158-year-old stock market Friday as investors and market operators
traded for the last time under old rules to be swept away over the
weekend in Spain's so-called Big Bang market reform.
   A law set to take effect Saturday introduces the most sweeping
changes in markets in Madrid, Barcelona, Bilbao and Valencia since
the founding of the first bourse in the Spanish capital in 1831.
   The privatization of the exchanges is expected to introduce
greater competition in the markets, which could mean that many of
the new, privately-owned brokerage firms created by the Big Bang
won't last long.
   Monday will be the first day of trading under the new system,
which Spanish National Radio termed ``an authentic revolution in
the Spanish financial system.''
   On Friday, civil servant stockbrokers enjoyed their last day of
monopoly over trading rights. The new law forced them to establish
or join new private brokerages or broker-dealer companies or
abandon trading altogether and act as public notaries.
   Market operators and regulators marked the final day under the
old rules at a ceremony in the Madrid Stock Exchange building
following the morning trading session.
   Javier Ramos Gascon, head of the old Madrid state-entity
exchange, symbolically turned over power to 36-year-old Pedro
Guerrerro, who was elected last week to preside over the new
private exchange. It is now owned and managed by new member
brokerages and dealer firms.
   National Securities Commission president Luis Carlos Croissier
acknowledged that ``survival in the new tough market is going to be
difficult'' for some of the more than 50 new member brokerages or
dealer-broker firms.
   Many analysts have predicted that from 20 to 30 of the new firms
won't be around within two years because of a greater competition
spurred by the reform.
   ``There are too many new firms,'' Ramos Gascon told reporters.
``I'm afraid a good number of them will not last.''
   The government set up the securities comission nine months ago
to implement the June 1988 market reform law. The commission is the
chief markets supervisory body and watchdog agency.
   A key part of the reform law established the Computer Automated
Trading System, or CATS, last April. So far 23 stock issues
accounting for 22 percent of trading volume have gone onto the
system.
   Croissier predicted that by the end of the year more than 50
percent of the total trading volume in Spain would take place on
the CATS system, which was pioneered by the Toronto Stock Exchange.
   On Friday, as in recent weeks, trading volume remained low on
the four stock exchanges, partly because of investor concerns about
the market reform changeover process and because of recent
government moves to restrict credit and slow down a booming
economy, analysts said.
   Trading volume Friday on the Madrid stock exchange, which
accounts for nearly 70 percent of trading in Spain, totaled 3.3
million shares or the equivalent of $62.3 million.
   Last April, when the Madrid market was surging, trading volume
moved between 5-6 million shares a day and $85.5 million to $102.5
million a day, said Madrid stock exchange spokesman Jaime Sanz.
   The Madrid general index Friday rose a slight 1.43 points to
302.23.
   The Barcelona exchange general index dipped 0.26 points to
105.80 and the Bilbao exchange general index climbed 3.56 points to
418.49. The Valencia exchange general index rose 1.50 points to
243.32.

<TEXT>
   In times like these, when stock market
speculators run up numbers as fast as the scores on pinball
machines, talk of 10 percent annual returns gets little attention.
   This is a market in which takeover talk can jump a stock 25
percent in a day, and when on some days scores of stocks on the New
York Stock Exchange may rise or fall by 5 percent without any
rumors at all.
   It is a fast market, a market of big changes and high
expectations, and 10 percent a year seems trivial in comparison.
But it isn't. Over time it can produce wonders, like turning $1,000
into $8,000 in less than 25 years.
   A review of market statistics shows, in fact, that 10 percent a
year is the average return for the period 1926-1988. That is the
annual rate for the Standard &amp; Poor's 500-stock index, which
includes good stocks and poor.
   By taking the time, spending the effort, studying the market and
making shrewd selections, many investors have done much better. And
unless market logic has been overturned, the future is likely to be
as good.
   Using the law of 72 _ in which the annual rate of return is
divided into 72 to obtain the number of years it will take for a
sum to double _ a $1,000 investment at 10 percent might be worth
$4,000 in about 15 years.
   Not good enough? Then assume you are highly talented, select
wisely and benefit from a surging economy, and thus obtain a 15
percent return. By the time those 15 years have elapsed your $1,000
would have grown to $8,000.
   Investment history shows that relatively few investment advisers
could top that record, no matter how convincing their literature,
their graphics, their publicity, their claims or their
self-acknowledged brilliance.
   The 10 percent return of the S&amp;P 500 in the 1926-1988 period was
made up of an annual 4.6 percent dividend income and 4.9 percent
earnings growth. In addition, the price-earnings ratio rose by an
average of 0.5 percent.
   These are averages, derived from good years and bad, including
an entire decade of the deepest economic depression ever. In some
periods of years the return was double that 10 percent. For the
entire decade of the 1950s it was 19.4 percent.
   Nobody can say what the future will bring. Everyone has heard
the caveat that past performance is not necessarily an indication
of the future. But when those words are used the ``past
performance'' usually is but a few years.
   In contrast, the 10 percent expectation is based on a 62-year
average, as compiled by Wright Investors' Service.
   True, there are some offsets about which little can be done.
   Taxes, for example, can cut the return from dividends, because
they are taxed each year. And capital gains taxes apply when the
investment is redeemed. In the latter case, however, the investor
benefits from the tax deferment.
   Inflation also cuts into returns; it took away 3.1 percent a
year in the 62-year period. Still, the equity premium over
``riskless'' investing in Treasury Bills came to 6.5 percent a
year. Equities clearly were the way to go.
   Time isn't mentioned much by investment advisors in these days
of instant results and quick dollars. But time and compounding are
factors that eventually produce the amazing results sought by many
investors.

   The stock market registered modestly higher
readings in afternoon trading today, steadying a bit after the
strong advance of the past two sessions.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials was up 1.14 to 2,636.57

   Democrats and Republicans are heading for a
showdown on the Senate floor over a compromise landmark savings and
loan bailout bill that would balloon the federal budget deficit.
   A House-Senate conference committee, finishing its work with two
marathon sessions lasting late into the evening, decided Thursday
night to reject Bush's complex plan to exclude $50 billion in
rescue spending from the deficit.
   Bush, asked at a news conference today about the S&amp;L
legislation, said every day the S&amp;L crisis remains unresolved,
``it's costing Americans. Some estimates have been $10 million to
$30 million dollars a day.''
   Asked if he could foresee any need to veto S&amp;L legislation, Bush
said, ``It won't come to vetoing the S&amp;L because we have 40-plus
votes in the Senate that, staying firm, will see our proposal
prevail. The House, as you know, has disagreed with us, but I'm
confident that we will do all right on that one.''
   The agreement sends the legislation to the full House and Senate
for votes next week. However, the Bush administration has raised
objections and senators warned that Republicans could block the
plan in the Senate.
   Nearly six months ago, Bush asked Congress for emergency action
to close or rescue hundreds of failed, but still-operating, savings
institutions.
   Under the compromise, the government's largest-ever bailout
would involve spending $166 billion, including interest, over the
next 10 years _ the vast majority of it from taxpayers.
   The bill includes a number of provisions to prevent a recurrence
of what analysts call the worst financial crisis since the
Depression.
   It requires S&amp;L owners to risk more of their own capital to
absorb losses before government deposit insurance kicks in. S&amp;Ls
would have to devote more of their assets to financing housing and
disclose how well they serve minorities and the poor. They also
would be prevented from using deposits to invest in high-yield,
high-risk junk bonds.
   The bill would enact the most sweeping restructuring of the
regulatory bureaucracy since the 1930s. It would dismantle the S&amp;L
agency, the Federal Home Loan Bank Board, dividing its duties
between an office in the Treasury Department and the Federal
Deposit Insurance Corp., now solely a bank regulator.
   The conferees decided to defy Bush on his funding proposal.
   The administration argued that the Democratic plan, which
inflates the budget deficit but exempts it from triggering
automatic spending cuts under the Gramm-Rudman law, will inspire a
congressional spending spree on other programs.
   Democrats, however, say their plan allows the government to
borrow the needed S&amp;L money at a lower cost and is a more honest
way to account for the spending.
   The five-member Senate delegation had been split 3-2 in favor of
the Bush plan, with Sen. Alan Cranston, D-Calif., joining the two
Republicans on the panel.
   But, after 5{ hours of debate and the House rejection of a
Senate compromise offer, Cranston shifted his position and joined
Sens. Donald W. Riegle Jr., D-Mich., and Paul Sarbanes, D-Md., in
accepting the House plan.
   Sen. John Heinz, R-Pa., chided his fellow conferees for
effectively postponing the difficult question.
   ``It will result, I fear, in a stalemate, not in this
conference, but on the Senate floor,'' he said.
   Sen. Phil Gramm of Texas, an ardent opponent of the House
funding plan, says he has the support of 40 other Republicans,
enough to block the compromise package under that chamber's rules.
   And even if the full Senate goes along with the House, Bush's
advisers have threatened to recommend a veto.
   White House Budget Director Richard Darman told reporters
Thursday that he favors a veto, joining Treasury Secretary Nicholas
F. Brady who has previously threatened to push for one.
   Brady, however, stopped short of such a threat in commenting on
the agreement, which he called ``an excellent product.''
   But, he added, ``The administration's position on financing is
perfectly clear and remains unchanged. We continue to actively
oppose the House financing plan which requires a Gramm-Rudman
waiver.''
   Riegle noted that S&amp;L losses are mounting at a rate of $20
million a day and warned against holding up the badly needed bill
until after Congress returns from its August vacation.
   House Democrats gave in to Cranston's plea to let the top
federal S&amp;L regulator, M. Danny Wall, stay in his job without
Senate reconfirmation.
   At confirmation hearings, Wall would be sure to face questions
about his role in delaying regulatory action against Lincoln
Savings and Loan Association of Irvine, Calif., which has since
failed and likely will require millions of dollars in government
aid.
   Such questions would be uncomfortable for Cranston and Riegle
because they accepted campaign contributions from Lincoln's owner,
Charles Keating, and later intervened with regulators on Lincoln's
behalf. Riegle has since returned Keating's contribution, but
Cranston has not.

   The cost of producing a television commercial
rose 15 percent to $168,000 last year, with automobile ads ranking
as the most expensive product category, according to an industry
survey.
   The American Association of Advertising Agencies said in
releasing the report Thursday that the increases ``were not as
dramatic as some of those reported earlier this decade.''
   The survey included 2,624 commercials produced in 1988 for
products ranging from automobiles and soft drinks to toys and
financial services.
   The average cost of a commercial created for national broadcast
was $176,000, up 15 percent, while costs rose 29 percent to
$132,000 for regional commercials and leaped 37 percent to $78,000
for local commercials.
   Automotive ads were the most expensive to produce, rising 28
percent to an average of $213,000. The average cost of ads for fast
food, beer, soft drinks and snacks fell 9 percent to $210,000.
   Some other categories, followed by percentage change and average
costs, included: beauty, fashion and cosmetics, up 40 percent to
$209,000; consumer services, travel and corporate image, up 34
percent to $190,000; appliances, office equipment and audio visual
products, up 10 percent to $182,000; packaged goods, up 7 percent
to $127,000; and toys and recreation, up 29 percent to $152,000.

   Televised home shopping, once heralded as a
revolutionary leap that would turn millions of living rooms into
shopping malls, has lurched through a painful childhood because
many potential customers aren't buying.
   Sales of items ranging from zirconia jewelry to fancy electronic
hardware have failed to meet the projections of analysts who had
predicted remarkable growth in a business that's less than a decade
old.
   Dozens of shopping networks begun with high ambitions have
closed or shifted focus. Some aspiring networks are finding it
difficult to persuade cable television system operators to make
room for them.
   Nonetheless, many analysts say home shopping's prospects remain
promising because they expect operators to put aside territorial
battles and concentrate on marketing themselves to prospective
buyers, those cable TV viewers who either aren't watching or don't
like what's for sale.
   ``Home shopping channels have a place in the future,'' said
Larry Gerbrandt, who follows the business for the media research
firm Paul Kagan Associates Inc. of Carmel, Calif. ``We have just
seen the tip of the iceberg of what they can do.''
   Recently, two of the three biggest home shopping network owners,
CVN Companies Inc. and QVC Network Inc., proposed to join forces in
a move that would reduce Home Shopping Network Inc.'s commanding
lead.
   Minneapolis-based CVN, which operates Cable Value Network, the
Fashion Channel and America's Shopping Channel with more than 23
million subscribers, would be acquired for about $400 million in
cash and stock by QVC, the West Chester, Pa.-based operator of the
14 million subscriber QVC Network.
   Home Shopping says its three services are carried on cable and
broadcast stations that can be seen by more than 60 million
households.
   The only other national home shopping service of significant
size is the J.C. Penney Television Shopping Channel, formerly known
as Shop Television Network. It is available on cable systems with
5.3 milion subscribers.
   The management consulting and accounting firm Touche Ross &amp; Co.
had estimated in 1986 that all home shopping programs would have a
combined total of more than $5 billion in annual sales by 1990.
   Douglas Hosking, a top executive in electronic retail consulting
at the San Francisco-based firm, concedes the projection was too
optimistic and expects industrywide revenues will reach $3 billion
to $5 billion in five years.
   Paul Kagan Associates estimates industry revenues totaled $1.4
billion in 1988 and projects growth to $2.75 billion by 1993.
   Critics say they are not surprised that home shopping has failed
to meet expectations. They say the public's appetite for closeout
merchandise and gadgets is bound to fade further.
   But Gerbrandt notes that home shopping channels are available to
more than 60 percent of the nation's television households.
   William Block, vice president of research at the brokerage
Newhard Cook &amp; Co., said surveys have shown more than half of all
cable subscribers aren't even of home shopping, an untapped
opportunity.
   Gerbrandt said the typical home shopping channel customer is
over 35 years old with a college education and household income
exceeding $35,000.
   ``That's more upscale than some people may have thought, but
then again nobody ever admits going into a K mart,'' he said.
   Home Shopping Network was the industry's first big star when it
went national in mid-1985 with the shopping service that it had
been running for three years on a local cable TV system in
Florida's Tampa Bay area.
   It put hosts on the air who tried to create a bargain-basement
atmosphere as they described eight to 12 products an hour, often
with a monitor counting down the number of items left or the number
of seconds remaining until the sale would end. They tooted horns
and chatted with callers who only had to make a purchase to be
admitted as a member of the ``club.''
   Its approach was to offer a range of products _ a VCR may follow
a gold necklace, for instance _ to catch the impulse buyer.
   ``Our entertaining format where you don't know what is coming
next keeps the viewer tuned in,'' said spokeswoman Kathy Jurado.
   But QVC Network _ the letters stand for quality, value and
convenience _ took a different approach after it aired in November
1986, about six months after CVN debuted.
   QVC segments its programming by spending an hour at a time on
one product category and promoting the presentations in advance.
   QVC may spend an hour on telephones, for instance, discussing
the features and pricing of each model. QVC executive vice
president Bruce Sellers said the approach allows people to shop as
they would at a mall and gets fewer complaints than catalog
retailers.
   While HSN, QVC and CVN built an audience, Gerbrandt said three
dozen or more home shopping channels came and went over the past
three years.
   Among the casualties were Shoppers' Casino, Collectible
Showcase, Caravan of Values and Crazy Eddie's World of Home
Entertainment.
   Hosking said one reason why so many failed was the relatively
small startup cost.
   ``It didn't take a lot of capital to get into the business, but
it takes a lot to be successful,'' he said.
   Another problem was that many cable systems reached their
capacity and decided they had no room for more than two shopping
channels. That was especially true when networks such as QVC signed
long-term agreements with cable operators and offered them equity
stakes in the service.
   Home Shopping has failed to meet the ambitious sales goals its
top executives have set, and is embroiled in a civil trial in
Florida with GTE Corp. over telephone problems that HSN said cost
it millions of dollars in lost business. GTE has denied
responsibility.
   Financial News Network joined the ranks of shopping service
dropouts in May when its discontinued its 2{-year-old FNN: Telshop
service.
   Telshop had been running overnight and on weekends on the same
channel as the Financial News Network.
   ``We didn't lose our enthusiasm for the home shopping business,
but felt a need to go 24 hours a day with business information,''
said former Telshop general manager John Berentson.
   He said within a few years, expansion of cable channel capacity
may reopen the door to new shopping services. ``It's a darn good
business,'' he said.

   Soybean futures prices plunged below $6.50 a
bushel, a 16-month low, in late trading Friday on the Chicago Board
of Trade amid expectations for continued improvement in Midwestern
growing conditions.
   Other grain futures also closed lower, largely in sympathy with
the plummeting soybean market.
   Analysts cited a bevy of bearish signals, including improving
crop conditions, forecasts for another week of scattered showers in
the Midwest, lower cash soybean prices and increased farmer selling
of soybeans.
   ``There was no incentive for anyone to buy,'' said Janice
Kincheloe, a market analyst in Chicago with Cargill Investor
Services Inc.
   Soybean futures prices have been moving lower since reaching
nearly $11 a bushel during last summer's drought.
   At the close, soybean futures were 1{ cents to 19{ cents lower
with the contract for delivery in August at $6.48{ cents a bushel,
the lowest price for a near-month contract since March 30, 1988.
Wheat was 1} cents lower to 1 cent higher with September at $3.88 a
bushel; corn was 2 cents to 3} cents lower with September at $2.28}
a bushel; oats were 6 cents to 8 cents lower with September at
$1.36 a bushel.

<HEAD>American Express Apologizes To Safra Over Media Attacks</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   American Express Co. said Friday it had apologized
to international banker Edmond Safra for what it called ``an
unauthorized and shameful effort'' to encourage false media reports
that Safra's banks had been involved in money laundering.
   American Express also agreed to pay $4 million to charity as
part of its unusual apology.
   In letters released by the two sides, American Express Chairman
James D. Robinson III said people ``acting on behalf of American
Express began an unauthorized and shameful effort to use the media
to malign'' Safra and Republic National Bank of New York, in which
Safra holds a 33 percent stake.
   Robinson said he regarded the reports as ``untrue and
defamatory.''
   ``While I believe in vigorous competition, there is no room in
our organization for actions which could cause unjustified harm to
a competitor,'' Robinson said.
   The letters were dated Monday.
   Robinson also said in his letter that American Express, the
giant U.S. financial services company, would make payments to four
charities at Safra's request, in an attempt to open a ``new
chapter'' with Safra and his banks. The charities were the
Anti-Defamation League of B'nai B'rith, United Way of America,
Hopital Cantonal de Geneve and the International Red Cross.
   Luc Giacobino, a Republic Bank spokesman in Geneva, said news
reports had alleged that Safra's banks were involved in laundering
money.
   Safra and his associates launched an investigation lasting
several months after noticing that articles containing the same
information appeared in news media throughout the world, including
Latin America and Europe.
   The investigation eventually led to American Express, but the
Republic spokesman refused to discuss the nature of the links
between the news reports and company.
   American Express refused to discuss the matter, stating only
that it ``is an internal matter'' and that ``appropriate steps are
being taken.''
   Safra has filed at least two lawsuits accusing newspapers of
publishing defamatory material.
   A hearing on a suit against L'Hebbo, a Lausanne, Switzerland,
weekly newspaper, is scheduled for next month in Geneva. The second
suit involves Minute, a French newspaper.
   In his reply to Robinson's letter, Safra said he was grateful
that Robinson had ``agreed to take appropriate action'' to prevent
further attacks.
   ``I believe you had no personal involvement in or knowledge of
the false rumors and innuendos about me and Republic National Bank
of New York,'' Safra wrote.
   Safra, a member of a Lebanese banking family who now lives in
Geneva, has made a career of providing banking services to the very
rich. His most recent venture was to form Safra Republic Holdings
SA last year from the European private banking operations of
Republic Bank.
   American Express and Safra became partners in private banking
briefly after Safra sold his Trade Development Bank Holdings SA to
the U.S. financial services conglomerate in 1983 for $520 million.
Safra quit two years later following a falling out with American
Express' top management.

which owns newspapers in Indiana and Arizona, on Friday approved a
recapitalization plan that clears the way for the company's first
public stock offering.
   Central Newspapers subsidiaries publish eight newspapers,
including The Indianapolis Star, The Indianapolis News, The Arizona
Republic and The Phoenix Gazette. Vice President Dan Quayle is
among under 200 stockholders.
   The company said in a statement that the Eugene C. Pulliam
Trust, which has had voting control of Central Newspapers since
1965, permits the recapitalization as long as it retains at least
53.77 percent voting power.
   Pulliam, Quayle's grandfather, was publisher of The Star and
News. He died in 1975. His son, Eugene S. Pulliam, Quayle's uncle,
is the current publisher.
   Under the recapitalization plan, the number of shares authorized
for issuance would be increased from 200,000 to 75 million for
Class A stock; 20,000 to 50 million for Class B; and 120,000 to 25
million for preferred stock.
   The plan grants limited voting rights to holders of Class A
stock and convertibility of Class B stock into Class A. It also
permits a 200 for 1 stock split in Class A and Class B stock.
   Central Newspapers also publishes the Arizona Business Gazette
and, in Indiana, The Muncie Star, The Muncie Evening Press and the
Vincennes Sun-Commercial.
   The company reported net income of about $29 million last year
on revenue of nearly $418 million.

<TEXT>
   More than 2,500 striking Eastern Airlines
workers and union representatives rallied Friday to draw attention
to the nearly five-month-long walkout.
   ``Frank Lorenzo is saying, `We are flying the planes, the strike
is over.' The strike is not over,'' said George E. Leitz,
international president of the Transport Workers of America.
   ``That's why we have this today, that he gets the message load
and clear,'' he said. ``They're still out on the picket lines and
they won't go back to work unless they get a decent contract,
something they can live with.''
   Lorenzo is chairman of Texas Air Corp., parent of Miami-based
Eastern. Texas Air also owns Continental Airlines.
   Eastern, which virtually was grounded when its Machinists,
pilots and flight attendants walked off the job March 4, has
undertaken a restructuring plan that calls for selling $1.8 billion
in assets and emerging from bankruptcy reorganization as a smaller
airline.
   The company, which has been hiring and training replacement
pilots, also has reached agreement with its creditors on a
bankruptcy reorganization plan.
   The striking employees have endorsed a separate plan to rebuild
the airline, centering on a buyout by a group led by Chicago
options trader Joseph Ritchie.
   Friday's rally was held at Rockefeller Center outside a
Continental ticket office. Some participants went to other ticket
offices in the area to demonstrate opposition to flying Eastern,
Continental and Scandinavian Airlines, which has financial ties to
Texas Air.
   ``This is like the last hurrah here. We're trying to do
something before it's too late,'' said Betsy Hartmann of Transport
Workers local 553 in Newark, N.J.
   Among those joining the rally were members of the International
Association of Machinists and representatives from the local postal
workers union, District Council 37, the Air Line Pilots
Association, United Mine Workers of Virginia and AFSCME Local 420,
representing hospital workers.

   The stock market steadied today after its strong
advance over the past two sessions.
   The market's performance was unsurprising: many Wall Street
watchers had expected stocks to bump into some profit-taking.
   ``I think in some ways today was kind of a day off,'' said Hugh
Johnson of First Albany Corp. ``It was a day of rest after the good
days we've had recently.''
   Trading slowed in the afternoon as market participants closed
out positions ahead of the weekend.
   A government report showing U.S. personal income edged up 0.3
percent in June while consumer spending fell slightly after
adjustment for inflation boosted bond prices, sending interest
rates lower, a movement which was welcomed by the stock market.
   ``Good things happened in the bond market and because good
things happened in the bond market the stock market was able to
handle the profit taking that occurred very easily,'' said Johnson.

<HEAD>House Votes Delay in Tax Rule Opposed By Business</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ALAN FRAM</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The House voted Friday to delay for one year a
business-opposed tax rule that would encourage companies to expand
the number of employees covered by health insurance.
   The provision is included in a spending bill the House approved
376-26 and sent to the Senate. Proponents hope that, eventually,
enough pressure will build to convince Congress to repeal the
so-called Section 89 entirely.
   The House Ways and Means Committee and the Senate have already
approved legislation that would revamp the regulations and delay
them until Jan. 1, but would not rescind them.
   Section 89, enacted in 1986, requires employers to demonstrate
that their health plans do not favor higher-paid workers.
   Some business groups have lobbied Congress to drop the rule,
claiming that it is so complicated, time-consuming and expensive
that it ends up having an effect that is the opposite of what was
intended.
   ``Many of them (employers) may cancel their health insurance
plans for employees rather than go through all the red tape of
Section 89,'' said Rep. Louise Slaughter, D-N.Y.
   ``Employers in my district are hopping mad,'' said Rep. Silvio
Conte, R-Mass.
   The rule was to take effect last Jan. 1 but became so
controversial that the Treasury Department delayed its
implementation until Oct. 1.
   The delay voted on Friday was part of a bill providing $18.4
billion for fiscal 1990 for the Treasury, the Postal Service and
several smaller agencies. Fiscal 1990 begins Oct. 1.
   The legislation provides $5.6 billion for the Internal Revenue
Service, $363 million more than this year. Most of the increase is
to strengthen the IRS's ability to enforce tax laws and to process
returns.
   The bill includes $148 million for the new Office of National
Drug Control Policy, headed by former education secretary William
Bennett, most of which he is to disperse to law enforcement
agencies.
   The bill also contains $2.1 million to upgrade security at Vice
President Dan Quayle's official residence at the Naval Observatory
in Washington and an additional $200,000 to help remodel and
renovate the third floor of the residence, which is used by
Quayle's three children.

<TEXT>
   Hooker Corp. on Friday ruled out a
``fire sale'' of its $1.8 billion assets while a team of advisers
headed for the United States to investigate ways to head off
foreclosure by U.S creditors.
   Hooker, a major Australian property company with significant
U.S. retail and real estate interests, turned itself over to a
court-appointed provisional liquidator on Wednesday in one of
Australia's biggest corporate collapses.
   The Sydney-based company, which owns B. Altman &amp; Co., Bonwit
Teller plus other U.S. department stores and shopping malls, owes
the equivalent of $1.2 billion to more than 42 banks.
   Hooker has blamed its financial mess on sluggish U.S. consumer
spending, exchange rate fluctuations, and Australian economic
troubles such as high interest rates that have hurt operations
there.
   Prime Minister Bob Hawke said Thursday the collapse had nothing
to do with the fundamental strength of the Australian economy.
   ``...We live in a situation where, as far as this government is
concerned, we deregulated the market, we let market forces oeprate
and market forces have operated here.''
   John Harkness, appointed provisional liquidator on July 26, told
a news conference Friday he was in the process of assessing the
situation and hoped to stabilize the corporation and then reduce
its debt.
   He said there would be no fire sale of assets and every attempt
would be made to maximize their value. The company has 10,000
employees and 13,000 shareholders.
   On Friday, subsidiary L.J. Hooker Homes, a U.S. residential
construction company based in Atlanta, denied published reports
that it was shutting down its operations as a result of this week's
developments.
   Brian McGregor, president of the company, issued a statement in
Atlanta saying Hooker's financial problems had temporarily altered
normal business operations at the subsidiary, ``but we are still in
business, all of our employees are at work, and we have no plans at
this time to close down.''
   Earlier this week, First National Bank of Chicago reportedly
started foreclosure proceedings on Hooker's Richland Fashion Mall
in Columbia, S.C. Hooker's financial advisers Friday said they were
aware of possible foreclosure but declined to comment further.
   The officials also said a delegation was preparing to fly to the
United States this weekend to consider whether Hooker would seek
court protection under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code.
   A Chapter 11 filing would protect the company from creditors'
lawsuits in the United States while Hooker works out a plan of
reorganization.
   Richard Grellman of the accounting firm Peat Marwick Hungerfords
has been advising Hooker and is part of the delegation. He said the
company's U.S. interests are vital to its future.
   ``The actions of creditors that hold specific securities is
something that will have to be addressed very carefully,'' Grellman
said. ``Whether Chapter 11 or some other alternative is most
appropriate is really the purpose of our trip.''
   Grellman acknowledged that some of Hooker's U.S. creditors have
certain rights over some of the company's assets.
   ``If they act within those rights, then so be it,'' he said.
``Clearly, actions along those lines will have to be examined very
carefully from the company's point of view.''
   Harkness, in ruling out a fire sale, said: ``We are running the
business as it was run and (will be) continuing business as usual.''
   He said it was essential the company be given time to conduct an
orderly sale of assets so their value could be maximized.
   Hooker's other U.S. interests include Sakowitz Inc., Parisian
Inc. and Merksamer Jewelers Inc. It has interests in shopping
malls, commercial property developments and house building.
   Hooker was suspended from share trading on Thursday. George
Herscu, who owns 50 percent of Hooker, resigned as chief executive
July 11 but remains chairman.

<HEAD>Department Store Chain Files for Chapter 11 Bankruptcy</HEAD>
<DATELINE>RICHMOND, Va. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Miller &amp; Rhoads Inc., a century-old
regional department store chain battered by creditor claims, filed
Friday for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in a reorganization
effort described by the firm's president as ``a positive step to
strengthen the company.''
   John E. Stokley, president of the Richmond-based chain of 15
department stores, said the bankruptcy filing will allow the
company to continue business as usual.
   Under Chapter 11 of the federal bankruptcy code, a company can
function under court protection while it devises a way to pay the
bills.
   Stokley said there were no immediate plans to close or sell
stores or to make major changes within the company.
   He said the decision to declare Chapter 11 bankruptcy was
triggered when an attempt to sell two stores in Roanoke and
Lynchburg failed.
   Sale of the stores would have provided some relief from
cash-flow problems that have steadily worsened at Miller &amp; Rhoads.
The 104-year-old company has been besieged by lenders, at least 15
of whom have filed lawsuits.
   Lawyers representing creditors said payments of claims have
slowed or stopped recently.
   Stokley said the bankruptcy filing will allow the company to buy
merchandise for the fall season, even though the company will have
to continue to pay cash for much of its goods.
   The company does not have a target date for emerging from
bankruptcy, Stokley said.
   Last December, then-president and chief executive officer Robert
J. Rieland left the chain. Rieland was hired in April by the
company's chief competitor, Thalhimer Bros. Inc., as president and
CEO.
   In May, M&amp;R's principal owner, Philadelphia developer Kevin F.
Donohoe, acknowledged the company had a cash-flow problem. But said
the chain was sound, would continue renovations at existing stores
and would build six more stores.
   Donohoe led a $65 million debt-financed takeover of the company
in 1987. He controls his interest in the chain through KFD Stores
Co., the retail arm of The Kevin F. Donohoe Cos., a diversified
real estate conglomerate.

   A mid-year cattle inventory showed 108.6
million head on the nation's farms and ranches as of July 1,
virtually unchanged from 108.5 million a year ago, the Agriculture
Department said Friday.
   ``This stops the seven-year trend of a declining cattle
industry,'' said the report by the department's National
Agricultural Statistics Service.
   However, the July 1 total was down 1 percent from the 109.5
million head reported two years ago. Last year's inventory was said
then to be the lowest since the July 1 count began in 1973.
   In February, the agency reported the Jan. 1 cattle inventory at
a 28-year low of fewer than 99.5 million head.
   Officials said the 1989 calf crop is expected to be 40.7 million
head, down fractionally from last year but up 2 percent from 1987.
   The July 1 inventory of 108.6 million head, which includes
calves and dairy cattle as well as beef stock, included these
categories:
   _Beef cows, 34.2 million, up slightly from July 1, 1988 and 1
percent above July 1, 1987.
   _Milk cows, 10.1 million, down 1 percent from last year and 3
percent below two years ago.
   _All heifers, 500 pounds and over, 16.7 million, up 1 percent
from last year but down 2 percent from two years ago.
   _Beef replacement heifers, 5 million, up 4 percent from each of
the past two years.
   _Milk replacement heifers, 4.5 million, up 2 percent from last
year but down 2 percent from two years ago.
   _Other heifers, 7.2 million, down 1 percent from a year ago and
down 5 percent from two years ago.
   _Steers weighing 500 pounds and over, 14.5 million, unchanged
from last year but down 2 percent from two years ago.
   _Bulls weighing 500 pounds and over, 2.2 million, unchanged from
both years.
   _Calves under 500 pounds, 30.9 million, down fractionally from
last year and down 1 percent from two years ago.

<TEXT>
   Rising global demand for cereal
boosted Kellogg Co.'s second-quarter earnings by 15 percent, the
world's largest cereal maker said Friday.
   Kellogg reported earnings of $129.7 million, or $1.06 a share,
for the three months ended June 30, up from $112.7 million, or 92
cents a share, for the second quarter of 1988.
   Sales for the quarter were $1.23 billion, up 13.6 percent from
$1.10 billion for the year-earlier period.
   For the first six months of the year, Kellogg said earnings
increased 23.7 percent to $289.2 million, or $2.36 a share, on
sales of $2.37 billion. That was up from $233.8 million, or $1.90 a
share, on sales of $2.13 billion in the first half of 1988.
   The six-month earnings included a one-time credit of $48.1
million from implementation on Jan. 1 of an accounting change
involving income taxes. Without the change, earnings for the six
months would have been up 3.1 percent to $241.1 million, or $1.97 a
share, the company said.
   Kellogg expects demand to continue to rise, said William
LaMothe, board chairman and chief executive officer.

<HEAD>Oil Futures Finish Mixed</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Crude oil futures fell through a key
psychological price barrier Friday as concern about excess supply
and weakening demand continued to depress prices.
   Unleaded and heating oil futures ended the day mixed.
   On the New York Mercantile Exchange, the September contract for
West Texas Intermediate, the benchmark grade of U.S. crude oil,
fell 19 cents to close at $17.93 a 42-gallon barrel. The contract
has fallen for six consecutive days and lost $1.58 since last
Friday when it cost $19.51 a barrel.
   Among refined products traded on the exchange Friday, August
unleaded gasoline rebounded 0.97 cent to finish at 52.95 cents a
gallon. Gasoline prices had weakened steadily over the last few
weeks as consumption dropped due to exaggerated pump prices.
   Gasoline contracts for delivery in September and October also
gained.
   Domestic heating oil for August delivery dropped 1.03 cents to
48.23 cents a gallon, while other contract months also recorded
declines.
   Analysts said crude oil broke through a psychologically
important level of $18 as it continued to slide back to February
levels. The near-term contract last closed lower on Feb. 23 at
$17.83 a barrel.
   Bearish sentiment continued to plague the market in the face of
weakening demand and growing supplies, market observers said.
   ``It's a combination of feeling that August refinery runs will
be lower and that OPEC is producing more than an ideal level,''
said Peter Beutel, assistant director of the energy group at Elders
Futures Inc.
   Refineries have eased off near peak runs of earlier in the
summer as demand for gasoline slackened off in the last few weeks.
Crude oil tends to pile up as refinery output slows.
   Also, the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries is
believed producing at least 2 million barrels a day above its
self-imposed quota of 19.5 million barrels. OPEC set a new
production ceiling recently in an attempt to stabilize prices for
Middle Eastern crude at $18 a barrel. Several of the 13-member
group, however, are producing above their limits.
   Andrew Lebow, senior broker and analyst with E.D.&amp;F. Man
International Futures Inc., said that crude prices could weaken
further before they get better.
   ``I don't think we'll see a price collapse,'' Lebow said. ``As
we head into the third and fourth quarters, I think the market will
show signs of improvement.''
   Analysts said Friday's gains in gasoline prices could continue.
``We could start to see some increase in demand. After all, August
is a big driving month,'' Beutel said.

<HEAD>Slowing Economy, Rains Spark Broad Drop In Commodity Prices</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID DISHNEAU</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Commodity futures prices tumbled Friday as traders of gold,
crude oil, soybeans and coffee reacted to bearish signals ranging
from signs of an economic slowdown to ideal growing conditions in
the Corn Belt.
   The worsening economic outlook was reflected on New York's
Commodity Exchange, where gold futures plunged $6.50 to $7.40 with
the contract for delivery in August settling at $367 a troy ounce.
Silver was 8 cents to 8.7 cents lower with September at $5.183 a
troy ounce.
   Analyst Bette Raptopoulos of Prudential-Bache Securities Inc.
said the sharp drop in gold prices was due to ``the convergence of
a number of moderately bearish factors,'' chief among them the
firming of the dollar Friday against other other major currencies.
   A stronger dollar discourages foreign purchases of U.S. goods,
which could reduce the incentive for the Federal Reserve Board to
ease up on interest rates. The Fed has recently been allowing
interest rates to fall in a bid to encourage borrowing and steer
the economy away from a recession.
   But economic data released this week have shown the economy
slowing, which has added to the pessimism in the gold market and
discouraged investment buying of gold as an inflation hedge.
   Some analysts found little cause for alarm in gold's decline,
noting that the market has held up well in recent weeks despite the
darkening economic scenario.
   ``I don't find today's sell-off to be terribly depressing or
negative,'' said Sharon Ziemian of Citibank in New York. ``I think
it's quite reasonable.''
   Crude oil futures prices continued a week-long slide on the New
York Mercantile Exchange that analysts have attributed to growing
supplies and slackening demand.
   West Texas Intermediate crude oil for September delivery fell
below $18 a barrel for the first time since late February and some
observers predicted further losses next week.
   Crude settled 14 cents to 19 cents lower with September at
$17.93 a barrel; heating oil was .55 cent to 1.03 cents lower with
August at 48.23 cents a gallon; unleaded gasoline was .54 cent
lower to .97 cent higher with August at 52.95 cents a gallon.
   Soybeans for near-term delivery plunged below $6.50 a bushel for
the first time in 16 months on the Chicago Board of Trade amid
expectations of continued improvement in Midwestern growing
conditions.
   Other grain futures also closed lower, largely in sympathy with
the plummeting soybean market. Wheat's losses were limited by
rumors of new export business. The Agriculture Department announced
after the close that it had targeted Algeria for sales of 1 million
metric tons of wheat at subsidized prices.
   Soybeans settled 1{ cents to 19 cents lower with August at $6.49
a bushel; wheat was 2 cents lower to 1 cent higher with September
at $3.87} a bushel; corn was 2 cents to 3} cents lower with
September at $2.29 a bushel; oats were 6 cents to 8 cents lower
with September at $1.36 a bushel.
   Coffee futures fell to a new 13-year low on on New York's
Coffee, Sugar &amp; Cocoa Exchange amid aggressive selling by
coffee-producing countries in an escalating battle for market
share. The price drop follows the International Coffee
Organization's July 3 suspension of coffee export quotas.
   Coffee settled 1.20 cents to 2.25 cents lower with September at
82.02 cents a pound.
   Cattle futures settled mostly lower on the Chicago Mercantile
Exchange in cautious trading ahead of the USDA's semi-annual cattle
inventory report. The report, released after the close, confirmed
perceptions of a modest expansion of the U.S. cattle herd and was
considered neutral for futures prices.
   Live cattle were .18 cent lower to .05 cent higher with August
at 72.57 cents a pound; feeder cattle were unchanged to .40 cent

   Many stock prices continued to move ahead in
moderately active trading Friday but a rally in blue chips stalled
as investors sold to collect profits.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials ended almost even at
2,635.24, off 0.19 for the day but up 27.88 points for the week.
   Advancing issues outpaced declining ones by about 6 to 5 in
nationwide trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed stocks, with
819 up, 679 down and 480 unchanged.
   Volume on the floor of the Big Board eased to 180.61 million
shares from 213.68 million in the previous session.
   Nationwide, consolidated volume in NYSE-listed issues, including
trades in those stocks on regional exchanges and in the
over-the-counter market, totaled 216.31 million shares.
   The performance by blue chip stocks was unsurprising: many Wall
Street watchers had expected stocks to bump into some profit-taking.
   ``I think in some ways today was kind of a day off,'' said Hugh
Johnson of First Albany Corp. ``It was a day of rest after the good
days we've had recently.''
   The good days carried the Dow Jones industrial average to two
consecutive post-crash closing highs on Wednesday and Thursday. At
its current level, the widely watched market measure is only 87.18
points below its record of 2,722.42 reached in August 1987.
   Broader measures of market activity managed to post new highs
again Friday. The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common
stocks edged up 0.16 to 190.38 and the Standard &amp; Poor's 500-stock
index went up 0.16 to 342.15, both beating their all-time highs set
Thursday.
   A government report showing U.S. personal income edged up 0.3
percent in June while consumer spending fell 0.1 percent after
adjustment for inflation boosted bond prices, sending interest
rates lower, a movement which was welcomed by Wall Street.
   The yield on the 30-year Treasury bond, a benchmark for interest
rates, dropped below 8 percent. The key bond's yield closed at
7.985 percent, down from 8.02 percent late Thursday.
   ``Good things happened in the bond market and because good
things happened in the bond market the stock market was able to
handle the profit-taking that occurred very easily,'' said Johnson.
   Some of the selling involved drug stocks that had been bid
sharply higher Thursday in a rally inspired by word that
Bristol-Myers and Squibb planned to merge.
   Squibb, which soard 24} on Thursday, pulled back slightly and
fell 2[ to 110]. Bristol-Myers was the Big Board's volume leader,
on turnover of nearly 6 million shares, and closed down 1\ at 48\.
   Losers among the blue chips included: American Telephone &amp;
Telegraph, down { at 40[; Eastman Kodak, down \ at 48{; Exxon, down
[ to 44~; Philip Morris, down 2 to 155; Coca-Cola, down | tp 63{;
and Merck, down 1] to 76[.
   As measured by Wilshire Associates' index of more than 5,000
actively traded stocks, the market rose $2.13 billion, or 0.06
percent, in value.
   Standard &amp; Poor's industrial index declined 0.56 to 391.31.
   The NASDAQ composite index for the over-the-counter market rose
0.34 to 452.82. At the American Stock Exchange, the market value
index closed at 374.51, off 0.84.

<HEAD>Gold Plunges, Dollar Mostly Stronger</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Gold prices tumbled and the dollar was mostly
higher in thin trading Friday, although there were no major
developments to spark the activity.
   Republic National Bank reported a late-afternoon bid of $367 for
a troy ounce of gold, down $5.90 from Thursday. Earlier, gold fell
an even sharper $6.70 a troy ounce on the New York Commodity
Exchange, closing at $367.
   Stephen Platt, a metals analyst with Dean Witter Reynolds Inc.
in Chicago, said some of gold's sharp decline was in response to
the dollar's surge in early domestic trading Friday.
   But gold's own lack of upward progress also took a toll on its
price, Platt said.
   The metal also fell sharply overseas. In London, gold fell to a
late bid price of $369.20 a troy ounce, down $4.80 from late
Thursday.
   In Zurich, it fell $4.30 to $369.75 bid, and in Hong Kong
earlier, it slipped $1.87 to a closing bid of $373.
   Silver also declined. On the Commodity Exchange, silver fell 8.1
cents to close at $5.137 a troy ounce, and it also fell 9 cents
earlier in London to a late bid of $5.14 a troy ounce.
   The dollar generally posted modest gains in U.S. trading after
rising sharply overseas.
   Dealers said there was no apparent reason for an early strong
advance on U.S. markets that influenced activity abroad. But the
dollar couldn't hold the gains in domestic trading, and retraced
some of its steps in the afternoon.
   The British pound fell to $1.6527 from $1.6540 in late New York
trading Thursday. Earlier in London, the pound fell to $1.6455 from
late Thursday's $1.6598.
   Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late
Thursday's rates, included: 1.8815 West German marks, up from
1.8785; 1.6175 Swiss francs, up from 1.6150; 6.3715 French francs,
up from 6.3605; 1,356.875 Italian lire, up from 1,351.60; and
1.18275 Canadian dollars, down from 1.18355.
   Other late dollar rates in Europe, compared with late Thursday's
prices, included: 1.8845 West German marks, up from 1.8692; 1.6180
Swiss francs, up from 1.6075; 6.3825 French francs, up from 6.3310;
2.1240 Dutch guilders, up from 2.1085; 1,354.00 Italian lire, up
from 1,346.00; and 1.1838 Canadian dollars, up from 1.1827.
   In Tokyo, the dollar rose to a closing 139.45 Japanese yen, up
from 139.35 yen at Thursday's close. Later, in London, the dollar
fell back to 139.31 yen, and in New York, it slipped to 139.20 yen
from 139.25 yen late Thursday.

<HEAD>Long Bond Yield Finishes Under 8 Percent For First Time Since Spring
1987</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PETER COY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>

   Bond investors, exuberant about the outlook for
low inflation, pushed the yield on a widely watched long-term
Treasury bond below 8 percent for the first time since spring 1987.
   Strength in the bond market eventually should spill over into
lower rates for consumers on mortgage, car and education loans.
   The bond market rally also means the federal government will
have to pay lower interest rates on its issue of new debt next week.
   ``Eight percent had been viewed as a great barrier and
economists said it would take a very unusual set of developments to
get us there short of a recession, and lo and behold we're there
even without a recession,'' said Maury Harris, a PaineWebber Inc.
economist.
   In a sign of lower consumer interest rates to come, Bank of
America announced it was lowering its prime lending rate to 10.5
percent on Monday from 11 percent. Chase Manhattan Bank lowered the
benchmark rate to that level earlier this month, but most other
major banks were still at 11 percent.
   The Commerce Department helped the bond market Friday with a
report that indicated slow economic growth. It said personal
incomes rose a lackluster 0.3 percent in June as consumer spending
declined for a second straight month.
   Bondholders generally welcome news of a slowdown in the economy
because it implies less demand for goods and services, easing the
risk of inflation, which erodes the value of such fixed-income
investments as bonds.
   The bellwether 30-year Treasury bond rose 15-32 point, or $4.69
per $1,000 in face amount, after gaining nearly 1 point in the
previous session. Its yield fell to 7.985 percent from 8.02 percent
late Thursday. The yield falls when the price rises.
   The yield on the benchmark 30-year bond had flirted with 8
percent all month. Helping push it below was the Federal Reserve's
injection of new reserves into the banking system this week as well
as a report Thursday showing slower-than-expected economic growth
in the second quarter.
   The bond had dipped below 8 percent during the July 11 session
but Friday was the first day since April 8, 1987, that it had
finished below that level.
   ``What's happening is that people are sort of coming in off the
sidelines to buy bonds as the Federal Reserve easing is becoming
more apparent and the inflation outlook is looking pretty
reasonable,'' said John Slosberg, senior fixed-income analyst at
Technical Data Global Markets Group in Boston.
   In the secondary market for Treasury bonds, prices of short-term
governments rose between 5-32 and ] point, intermediate maturities
advanced between about ] point and long-term issues gained about {
point, the Telerate Inc. financial information service reported.
   The movement of a point equals a change of $10 in the price of a
bond with a $1,000 face value.
   The Shearson Lehman Hutton Daily Treasury Bond Index, which
measures price movements on all outstanding Treasury issues with
maturities of a year or longer, rose 3.46 to 1,198.45 from a
revised 1,194.99 on Thursday.
   Moody's Investment Grade Corporate Bond Index, which measures
total return on a portfolio of 80 corporate bonds with maturities
of five years or longer, rose 0.97 to 333.23.
   In the tax-exempt market, the Bond Buyer index of 40 actively
traded municipal bonds rose 3-32 point. The average yield to
maturity fell to 7.18 percent from 7.19 percent late Thursday.
   Yields on three-month Treasury bills fell to 8.11 percent as the
discount fell 5 basis points to 7.85 percent. Yields on six-month
bills fell to 7.89 percent as the discount fell 1 basis points to
7.50 percent. Yields on one-year bills fell to 7.67 percent from
the rate at auction Thursday as the discount fell 5 basis points to
7.16 percent.
   A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point. The yield
is the annualized return on an investment in a Treasury bill. The
discount is the percentage that bills are selling below the face
value, paid at maturity.
   The federal funds rate, the interest on overnight loans between
banks, traded at 8 15-16 percent, down from 9 percent late
Thursday. The Fed controls the rate by adding or subtracting
banking reserves, and many economists believe it has set a new
target of 9 percent, down from 9\ percent.

<TEXT>
   CBS Broadcast Group Chairman Gene F. Jankowski
has resigned and plans to head a new company that will buy
television stations and produce programming for the U.S. and
international markets.
   Jankowski, 55, has held the post of chairman of the broadcast
group for a year. The post was created for him when he stepped
aside after 11 years as the president of the broadcast group with
2{ years left on his employment contract.
   He is the latest in a succession of top executives to leave CBS
since Laurence A. Tisch took over three years ago as president and
chief executive. Tisch controls a 24.9 percent stake in CBS, which
has shed virtually all of its non-broadcast operations.
   Jankowski said Friday his new company, Jankowski Communications
System Inc., would buy a minimum of five television stations,
preferably network affiliates ranked in markets ranked between the
nation's 25th and 75th largest.
   He said prices for such stations have fallen in the past year to
attractive levels.
   Jankowski said he and CBS reached a mutually beneficial
settlement for the remaining portion of his contract which runs
intil the end of 1990.
   In a statement announcing Jankowski's departure, Tisch and CBS
Chairman William S. Paley applauded Jankowski for his 28 years of
service to CBS.

<TEXT>
   A federal judge on Friday lifted a ban on
American Telephone &amp; Telegraph Co. owning the computer data,
videotex, financial and other information services it transmits on
its wires.
   U.S. District Judge Harold Greene said enough competition exists
in the transmission and provision of so-called electronic
publishing services to allow AT&amp;T to enter the fields on Aug. 24.
   AT&amp;T in April had asked Greene to revoke the ban, which was in
the form of a consent decree imposed when AT&amp;T divested itself of
its local phone companies in 1984.
   The 1984 judgment stipulated that the electronic publishing ban
would be lifted in seven years unless shown it should continue. The
ban was established Aug. 24, 1982, and Greene, who oversaw the AT&amp;T
breakup, said he intended to lift it after seven years.
   Greene said the ban was appropriate in 1982 because the
electronic publishing industry was in its infancy and AT&amp;T had de
facto control of the long-distance network.
   But he said the ban should operate only ``for the period
necessary to establish conditions conducive to free and fair
competition.''
   After seven years had passed, Greene said, the burden of proof
would be on any opponents of removal to show that competitive
conditions clearly required maintaining a ban.
   AT&amp;T in April argued that the electronic publishing industry was
healthy and had significant competition in long-distance from MCI
Communications Corp., US Sprint Communications Co. and others. AT&amp;T
controls about 68 percent of the nation's long-distance business.
   AT&amp;T said major electronic publishing companies included
Knight-Ridder Inc. for online database services; Citicorp, Dow
Jones and Reuters for securities quotations and financial
information; Dun &amp; Bradstreet Corp. and TRW Inc. for credit data;
and General Electric Co., International Business Machines Corp. and
Sears &amp; Roebuck Inc. for videotex services.
   ``No one has contradicted the thrust of these contentions, and
no one is contending that current competitive conditions warrant
retention of the electronic publishing restriction in its
entirety,'' Greene said in his ruling.
   He noted the Justice Department had decided that AT&amp;T could not
exert ``bottleneck'' control over long-distance services because of
its competitors. The Federal Communications Commission concluded
the same thing, Greene said.
   AT&amp;T said the decision reflected Greene's ``thorough
understanding of forces at work in today's highly competitive and
complex telecommunications marketplace.''
   AT&amp;T spokesman Herb Linnen said the company would not comment on
what electronic business business options it was considering.
   AT&amp;T said in April it had no plans to enter the electronic
yellow pages and television businesses _ two areas of special
concern to the seven regional Bell telephone companies spun off
from AT&amp;T in 1984 and to the broadcast and cable TV industries.
   Some observers, noting some major failures by companies
attempting to develop a U.S. videotex market, have said AT&amp;T may
not rush into the electronic publishing business immediately.
   But electronic yellow pages may be an area of interest to AT&amp;T
since the regional Bell companies are barred from that business.
   In 1987, Greene gave the regional Bell companies permission to
transmit but not originate information services, which include
electronic publishing and data processing and related computer
services.
   Replying to AT&amp;T's April filing, several companies requested
that AT&amp;T be prohibited from providing audiotex and data processing
services because it could dominate this infant industry.
   But Greene said sufficient competition exists in the
transmission of audiotex services and he had no antitrust authority
to assist relatively small or weak audiotex providers.
   Greene also said he was not deterred by assertions by the
American Newspaper Publishers Association, Consumer Federation of
America and an audiotex provider, Omnicall, that independent
providers are hampered because they can't switch long-distance
carriers and keep their 800 or 900 numbers.

   Bank of America lowered its prime lending
rate to 10.5 percent from 11 percent, only the second money center
bank to follow the lead of Chase Manhattan, which cut the benchmark
interest rate on July 10.
   Analysts said Friday other major banks may soon lower their
prime rates because their own cost of borrowing money has fallen
sharply over the past few days. The federal funds rate, which is
the interest banks charge each other for short-term loans, finished

<TEXT>
   Federal regulators closed three more Texas banks
Thursday, bringing to 99 the total number failures in the state
this year, only 14 less than all of last year.
   In two of Thursday's closures, all deposits were transferred to
new owners, but at Forestwood National Bank of Dallas only deposits
up to the $100,000 insured limit were transferred.
   The federal Office of the Comptroller of the Currency closed
Forestwood's two branches, citing problems brought on by a
continuing real estate collapse combined with liberal and
aggressive lending practices.
   OCC Senior Deputy Comptroller Frank Maguire also closed Brushy
Creek National Bank in Round Rock, with the FDIC transferring the
bank's deposits and some other liabilities to Union National Bank
in Austin for a $1,000 premium.
   And Texas Banking Commissioner Kenneth W. Littlefield shut The
Texas Bank &amp; Trust Co. in Sweetwater, about 42 miles west of
Abilene.
   The OCC said 10-year-old Forestwood had assets of about $61.4
million. The Federal Deposit Insurance Corp., named as receiver of
the bank, approved the transfer of insured deposits and secured
liabilities to Comerica Bank-Texas in Dallas.
   In most failures, the FDIC has transferred all deposits, even
those above the insurance limit, but it said only insured deposits
were transferred ``because of an inability to determine the value
of the bank's assets and undeterminable exposure in significant
contingent liabilities.''
   Comerica Bank is paying the FDIC $200,000 for the right to
receive the deposits, and it will purchase $39.4 million of the
failed bank's assets. The FDIC will retain assets with a book value
of about $22 million.
   Union will assume $10.1 million in 2,400 Brushy Creek deposit
accounts and has agreed to purchase certain Brushy Creek assets for
$6.5 million with options to purchase more. The FDIC also will
provide $3.5 million in assistance and retain assets with a book
value of $3.5 million.
   The OCC said Brushy Creek had assets of $10.1 million.
   The FDIC sold the Texas Bank &amp; Trust Co.'s $35.6 million in
deposits to First National Bank in Sweetwater for $457,000. First
National also agreed to purchase $29.1 million of the failed bank's
assets.
   The FDIC will advance First National $6.1 million in assistance,
plus retain assets with a book value of $7.5 million.

<DATELINE>ST. LOUIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Anheuser-Busch Cos. Inc., the world's largest
brewer, reported an industry-leading jump in beer sales that
contributed to record second-quarter earnings.
   The St. Louis-based company, whose brands include Budweiser and
Michelob, said beer volume has increased 1.1 million barrels so far
this year. The company sold 21.4 million barrels of beer during the
second quarter and 41 million barrels for the first six months.
   According to estimates from the Beer Institute, those sales
accounted for 42 percent of total industry sales for the first six
months, up 1.4 percent and the largest share gain of any brewer.
   ``Our volume growth remains strong and earnings continue to
benefit from operating efficiencies, despite material cost
increases,'' August A. Busch III, president and chairman, said in a
statement Wednesday.
   Anheuser-Busch reported a 10.5 percent profit increase for the
second quarter. Earnings were $233.7 million, or 82 cents a share,
up from $211.5 million, or 72 cents a share, the same period last
year. Sales increased 6.8 percent to $2.48 billion from $2.32
