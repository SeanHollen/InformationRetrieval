<HEAD>Congressman Says Former Aide Improperly Pocketed Funds</HEAD>

   Rep. Roy P. Dyson said Monday he has made
``mistakes in judgment'' while in office and that his former top
aide who committed suicide had improperly pocketed campaign funds.
   The five-term Democrat from Maryland also said he was returning
$18,000 in campaign contributions made by officials connected to a
defense contractor.
   Dyson said his former top aide and campaign manager, Tom Pappas,
improperly pocketed nearly $7,300 in campaign funds. Pappas wrote
$7,275 in checks to other Dyson staff members and told them to give
him the cash, Dyson said.
   ``I must accept ultimate responsibility for these errors in
judgment because Tom Pappas was my campaign manager,'' Dyson said.
``I was not aware that Tom was writing checks to staff members and
asking them to cash those checks and return the cash to him.''
   Pappas committed suicide in May 1988 by jumping from a New York
hotel following newspaper reports that were highly critical of his
management of Dyson's congressional office.
   The apparent violations will be reported to the Federal
Elections Commission, Dyson said.
   Dyson also said he would return $18,000 in campaign
contributions received from officials connected to Unisys Corp.,
one of several defense contractors under investigation by the U.S.
Justice Department for suspected violations of contract procurement
regulations.
   He said was returning the money because individual guilty pleas
entered as a result of the investigation ``point to a systematic
attempt on the part of Unisys to circumvent the federal laws
governing campaign contributions,'' said Dyson, who sits on a House
subcommittee with repsonsibility for approving the Pentagon budget.
   ``Mistakes were made by my staff. I have made mistakes of
judgment,'' Dyson added. ``I regret the controversy these matters
have caused, but I want the people of Maryland to know that these
were mistakes of the head, not of the heart.''

   The United States and the Soviet Union are the
only two nations to acknowledge having chemical weapons, although
up to a dozen, including Libya and Iran, are thought to have the
grisly substances or the ability to make them, experts said Monday.
   President Bush, addressing the U.N. General Assembly, proclaimed
his readiness to destroy 80 percent of U.S. chemical weapon stores
if Moscow agrees to the same stockpile level, and urged other
nations to sign a multilateral pact to ban them entirely.
   Bush, however, did not suspend production of new U.S. chemical
weapons, and his offer did not appear to go beyond legislation
passed by Congress requiring the government to destroy old chemical
weapons stocks by 1997.
   Bush said more than 20 nations have these weapons or the ability
to mkake them. There was no immediate explanation of why his
estimate was higher than those offered by the experts.
   The president's proposal ``might focus international attention
on chemical weapons and lead to a multilateral treaty,'' said Lee
Feinstein of the Arms Control Association, a disarmament lobby in
Washington.
   But it may instead produce a U.S.-Soviet deal on chemical
weapons and divert attention from production by other countries, he
said.
   Private analysts believe the United States has 30,000 tons of
chemical weapons. The Soviets have said they have ``no more than''
50,000.
   Delegates to the 40-nation Conference on Disarmament ended their
most recent meeting in Geneva last month without any clear idea of
when it would be possible to conclude a global ban on chemical
weapons.
   The conference, which meets again in November, is stalled on the
issue of how to monitor the production of chemical weapons, which
experts say can be made in factories similar to those that make
fertilizer or other compounds.
   ``The problem we have is that nobody has determined how to
(monitor) it in an effectively verifiable way, because chemical
weapons can be made in just about any kind of chemical plant,''
Gen. Colin Powell said earlier this year, before he was nominated
chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.
   Also in dispute are the size of chemical weapons stockpiles, and
even the number of countries that have them.
   U.S. intelligence officials have said that Libya is building the
world's largest chemical weapons plant at Rabta. Libyan leader
Moammar Gadhafi has said the factory is designed to produce
pharmaceuticals.
   In 1984, the United Nations concluded that Iraq had used lethal
chemical agents against Kurds along the Iran-Iraq border, although
Iraq has not admitted it.
   Other nations thought able to make their own chemical weapons
are Burma, China, Iran, Israel, Libya, North Korea, Syria, Taiwan
and probably Egypt, said Elisa Harris, a scholar who closely tracks
the issue at the Brookings Institution in Washington.
   The size of the U.S. and Soviet stockpiles is not publicly
known, although those two governments last weekend signed an
agreement to exchange and verify data on their chemical arsenals,
including the right to on-sight inspection.
   The United States has disclosed what type of weapons it has and
where they are stored, but not the size of the stockpiles. The Arms
Control Association estimated the size of the U.S. stock at about
30,000 tons.
   In 1987, the U.S. government, after an 18-year moratorium, began
to manufacture a new generation of ``binary'' chemical weapons,
which consist of two toxic substances that become lethal when mixed
together.
   Congress also has ordered the destruction by 1997 of 90 percent
of stockpiles of older U.S. chemical weapons, stored at 11 sites in
the United States and in West Germany.
   Work began on Aug. 31 at the Toole Army Depot in the Utah desert
to destroy 42 percent of the U.S. stockpile, consisting of nerve
and mustard gas, blistering agents that were used in World War I.
Similar facilities were being studied at other storage sites to
destroy the remainder.
   The U.S. stockpile also consists of the nerve agents Sarin and
VX, and other substances, according to the government.
   The Soviet Union suspended chemical weapon production on Dec.
26, 1987, seven months after the United States resumed production.
Kremlin spokesmen, giving the first-ever Soviet figures on chemical
weapon stockpiles, said they contained ``no more than 50,000 tons
of chemical warfare agents.''
   U.S. estimates of Soviet stockpiles have ranged from 30,000 to
50,000 tons.
   In October 1987, the Soviets announced that their stockpile
consisted of the nerve agents Sarion, Soman, VX, two mustard
blistering agents and one irritant.

<HEAD>New Connie Chung Series Good Drama, Little Journalism</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAY SHARBUTT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Television Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   If the premiere of ``Saturday Night With Connie
Chung'' is typical of things to come, it might be wise for CBS News
to turn it into a docudrama anthology series and let CBS
Entertainment produce it.
   The show spent half its opening hour Saturday dramatizing the
life of a fiery early civil rights pioneer in Montgomery, Ala., the
Rev. Vernon Johns, played by James Earl Jones. That half was a
fairly good docudrama.
   But this is supposed to be a news series, even though this one's
closing credits cited a ``soloist'' _ jazzman David Sanborn, who
played the show's bluesy theme music.
   It is not a good sign for a journalism show to have a news &amp;
blues saxaphonist. But this effort's first 30 minutes were not a
good sign, either.
   They made one fear that this series, produced by Andrew Lack,
producer of the departed ``West 57th'' series, may prove just a
training ground for TV news producers who hope to someday make TV
movies.
   Entitled ``God's Bad Boy,'' Saturday's debut dramatization, set
in 1949, featured seven actors; a group of black townsfolk as
extras in Johns' church, the Dexter Avenue Baptist Church, and
white extras as hostile policemen.
   By David Bradley and Kenneth King, the ``re-creation''
sporadically included brief interviews _ in the manner of the movie
``Reds'' _ with seven people who knew the late minister. They
included his daughter, Toni Johns Anderson, and Atlanta Mayor
Andrew Young.
   There was an eighth interviewee, historian Taylor Branch. The
first chapter of his Pulitzer Prize-winning book on the civil
rights movement, ``Parting the Waters,'' was the basis for the
dramatization.
   The dramatization, in which Johns strongly and loudly spoke out
against murder of blacks by whites and urged his middle-class
congregation to stand up for black civil rights, was woefully weak
in journalistic basics.
   Even Chung, who has a reputation as a good reporter, exhibited
this flaw in her non-acting role as anchor.
   She prefaced one scene by saying how ``a series of brutal
murders of blacks by the police'' in the spring of 1949 led Johns
to preach a sermon that ``would threaten the uneasy calm'' between
the races in Montgomery.
   But she cited no examples of any murders by police. She only
said that a white man got up off his front porch and shot and
killed a black man who was running by. The killer's explanation,
she said, was this: `` `If he was running, he must have done
something.' ''
   She didn't say if the white man was charged with anything, let
alone tried.
   In the docudrama, Johns, in saying that ``a lot of people doing
the killing'' of blacks are the police, at least cited two cases.
They were found to be, he scornfully noted, ``justifiable
homicide.''
   But he named only one policemen while naming all the victims. It
made you wonder if any of the names were real.
   In another scene, he was called ``boy'' by a white man
identified only as a ``commonwealth's attorney'' in Mongtomery. No
name was given. Another white official in a succeeding scene is
identified only as ``Judge Jones.''
   In yet another scene, John's daughter, in an off-camera
interview excerpt that accompanied the on-screen drama, said that
``as I recall, a black girl had been raped. I think it was by six
policemen.''
   You'd think there be might be a question at this shocking point
whether what she said actually happened, and whether any policemen
were charged. But there was no question.
   On the bright side, the show's second half was an interesting
panel discussion where sparks occasionally flew between the Rev.
Jesse Jackson and Montgomery Mayor Emory Folmar, the latter a white
man.
   For the record, Chung told viewers that next Saturday will bring
``Jane Fonda, talking for the first time on television, about her
separation from Tom Hayden and about her newest roles, both
on-screen and off.''
   It can be assumed that Fonda will play herself.

<HEAD>Activist Freed But Restricted After 28-Day Hunger Strike</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CAPE TOWN, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Police have imposed severe
restrictions on a white anti-apartheid activist who won his freedom
from detention by staging a 28-day hunger strike.
   Willie Hofmeyr, 35, was detained without charge Aug. 26 while
participating in a protest against First National Bank, sponsors of
an international rugby series that many activists viewed as a
violation of the sports boycott imposed on South Africa because of
its segregationist policies.
   Hofmeyr, a lawyer, drank only fruit juice during his detention,
and relatives said he was on the verge of suffering permanent
damage when the government agreed to free him Friday.
   He remained in Cape Town's Groote Schuur Hospital on Sunday, and
his family said he was not likely to leave until midweek.
   According to his lawyers, Hofmeyr has been issued a restriction
order which bars him from working with anti-apartheid
organizations, prohibits him from giving interviews or publishing
articles and requires him to be indoors from 8 p.m. to 6 a.m. He
also is barred from attending any anti-government meetings.
   Hofmeyr's release followed a 90-minute meeting Thursday between
his father and Law and Order Minister Adriaan Vlok.

<BYLINE>Norwegians Come on Foot to `World's First' Drive-In Opera ^By DOUG

<DATELINE>OSLO, Norway (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Norwegian National Opera tried to bring
19th century arias to the masses this weekend with a drive-in
performance. Many viewers, mostly on foot, found opera loud but
hard to see.
   A 225-square-foot movie screen dangled from a crane above Oslo's
Youngstorget marketplace for what was billed as the world's first
drive-in opera.
   Broadcast images of the opera's live Saturday night performance
from its regular theater were dim, but stacks of loudspeakers
blasted the normally quiet city center with crisp arias.
   ``It started as a crazy notion but we went ahead anyway,'' said
state opera spokesman Terje Baskerud. It was inspired by U.S.
drive-in movies, which are unknown in Norway, he said.
   ``We want people to know that opera can be fun,'' Baskerud said
of choosing one act from the 19th century comedy ``The Barber of
Seville'' for the experiment.
   The opera hoped 1950s Americana will help it shed a high-brow
image and appeal to a broader public through the free, one night
drive-in. Sponsors paid the $28,000 cost.
   Several operas in the U.S. and elsewhere asked to be kept
informed of the results, Baskerud said.
   Drive-in movie theaters are as foreign to most Norwegians as
opera. Police estimated there was room for 250 cars in the
closed-off marketplace. About 70 cars parked, many facing away from
screen.
   Unsure of drive-in etiquette, ``one lady asked if she was
allowed to get out of her car,'' said Baskerud.
   Most of the roughly 1,300 people who passed through the square
came on foot, often leading dogs or carrying children. A core of
about 300 stayed through the 90-minute first act, politely
applauding the screen.
   Some sat in chairs lined up on a truck's cargo bed. Nearby,
limousine passengers sipped champagne.
   The second act proved too dark for television and plans to have
waitresses on rollerskates serve hamburgers also proved impossible,
Baskerud said.
   ``It's wonderful,'' said Lillian Ingerbretsen, 48, an opera fan.
``The screen was dark ... but now people will buy tickets to a
performance just to see what it is really like,'' she said.
   Baskerud admitted picture problems but said ``sound was perfect
and that's what counts ... Next time, we will have a performance
lighted for television.''
   Morten Kristoffersen, 16, who paused, looked and walked on,
said, ``Great idea but it's hard to see ... I don't think I'll be
going to the opera anytime soon.''
   But Baskerud said ticket sales to regular performances boomed
during the drive-in. The opera, founded in 1957, already averages
90 percent bookings for 200 shows a year in its home, a cramped
former movie theater, he said.
   The 1,119-tickets for the premiere had been sold out, yet when
the curtain rose in the opera house many seats were empty.
   ``More than a third of the ticket holders stayed outside to
watch the drive-in, then came in for the second act,'' he said.
   The Italian-language performance of Rossini's ``Barber of
Seville'', first performed in 1816, was directed by Michael Hampe
of the Cologne Opera, and conducted by Italian Carlo Felice
Cillareo.
   Iziar Martinez Galdos, a Spanish resident of Norway, sang the
female lead Rosina, the Scottish opera's Neill Archer sang Count
Almaviva and Norway's Trond Halstein Moe performed Figaro, with
support from the opera's other 26 singers, 42-member chorus and
75-piece orchestra.

<HEAD>In East Harlem School District, Choice Triumphs, But Money Still
Talks</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: Also in Monday AMs report. Education summit is Sept. 27-28.</HEAD>

   Outside the battered metal doors of Intermediate
School 117 in East Harlem, crack vials litter the pavement and row
after row of tenements stand empty and graffiti-scarred.
   But inside is what President Bush has called ``the single most
promising idea'' in education _ an idea certain to be high on the
agenda at the education summit this week between Bush and the
nation's governors in Charlottesville, Va.
   The idea is ``choice'': the belief, as espoused by Bush and
others, that if parents are allowed to choose the best public
schools for their children, the resulting competition would compel
schools everywhere to improve.
   Minnesota, Iowa and Arkansas have already adopted ``open
enrollment'' plans permitting parents to choose among schools
throughout those states. Many other states offer more limited
choice options aimed at gifted students or youngsters with academic
problems that only certain districts can handle. Scores of local
districts have offered magnet and alternative programs for years.
   A Gallup education survey in August found Americans support the
principle of school choice by a 60-31 margin, with 9 percent saying
they weren't sure.
   Minnesota's plan, voluntary for two years, became mandatory this
fall for districts with at least 1,000 students. In Iowa, a law
signed this year gives students the right to apply to any school in
the state. They must stick with their choice for at least four
years.
   Arkansas this year passed a comprehensive open enrollment law
permitting students aged 5 through 18 to choose schools across
district lines as long as there is room and as long as it doesn't
upset desegregation efforts.
   But advocates say no place offers better proof than East Harlem
that choice's benefits can extend even to urban America's neediest.
   In 1972, District 4 ranked last among New York City's 32 school
districts in reading and math achievement. Only 15 percent read at
or above grade level.
   With federal and private funds, then-superintendent Anthony
Alvarado gradually broke up or replaced existing schools in the
district with magnet schools and alternative ``schools within
schools,'' small enough to give students individual attention and
academically attractive enough to draw pupils from all over the
city.
   Some are selective, like the gifted programs or the school for
the performing arts. Others take nearly all comers.
   The district has weathered some recent problems. Last December,
superintendent Carlos Medina was suspended on allegations he and
fellow board members funneled district money into a secret bank
account and used it for trips, food, liquor and improper loans.
   And citywide school budget cuts may force reductions this year
in some of the district's innovative magnet programs, said
assistant superintendent John Falco.
   Still, everyone agrees the district has been transformed for the
better by the bracing effects of competition.
   Even Keith Geiger, president of the National Education
Association, which has given only qualified support to the idea of
choice, calls District 4 ``choice at its very best.''
   Today, reading scores of District 4's 14,000 pupils rank 16th in
the city, and 65 percent read at grade level or higher. Pupils can
choose among 23 alternative schools specializing in such areas as
science and humanities, performing arts and environmental science.
   Choice has also meant that poor programs which no longer attract
students don't last. A school specializing in maritime science was
closed about three years ago, Falco said. It reopened recently with
a new director.
   I.S. 117 was once a failing, impersonal middle school bulging
with more than 2,000 students. It now houses four academies, or
schools within schools, each occupying one floor and each with only
about 200 pupils. There is a gifted and talented program; the
``Harbor School'' for the performing arts; the ``Career Academy,''
which helps poorly prepared students take a seemingly outlandish
goal such as becoming a lawyer and plan how to attain it; and the
``Key School'' with classes of no more than 18 students and
intensive instruction for youngsters with emotional difficulties.
   Most pupils come from East Harlem. But the magnet schools are so
appealing that this once-downtrodden district is drawing students
of all races and economic circumstances from every corner of the
city.
   Nearly 200 children from around the city applied for 70 places
in the entering class of the Harbor School this year, says
assistant director Harold Roth.
   Fourth-grader Chenoa Rommereim takes a car pool each day from
the Bronx to attend I.S. 117's gifted program. She is one of the
estimated 15-25 percent non-minority students in District 4 magnet
programs, Falco said.
   Even staunch supporters of choice note its limitations. District
4 has shunned choice for elementary schools, Falco said, because at
that early age it's more important for parents and children to
maintain neighborhood ties.
   Sy Fliegel, an early architect of choice in District 4, recently
wrote that choice worked in East Harlem because it came gradually,
one school at a time. And successful programs were kept small. It's
far better to have parents clamoring for a few excellent programs
than to offer lots of poor choices.
   ``When I hear about a school district deciding to become a
complete choice system in one blow, I worry,'' Fliegel wrote.
   And as the Bush education summit approaches, educators here
greet their fame with a mix of pride and frustration.
   Some worry that District 4's accomplishments are being used to
demonstrate that choice alone, without additional money, will fix
the nation's schools. Few here believe that choice is an
educational cure-all.
   ``In the final analysis the folks in Washington seem to be
saying: `Federal dollars aren't necessary. What's needed is to have
more schools like THAT one,''' said Phil Batton, a computer and
Spanish teacher who has been at I.S. 117 for 24 years.
   ``I have two feelings,'' said Maria Bonet, director of Northview
Tech, a magnet school on East 116th Street specializing in
computers and writing. ``It's very positive that people are
noticing us. Let them notice. But send us more money.''

   It may not spark a revolution in
men's wear in Ethiopia, but for the first time in years government
officials are being allowed to shed their uniforms.
   A senior official said Sunday that government employees have
been told they may dispense with their khaki uniforms in favor of
civilian garb in their offices and at ceremonial occasions.
   The two-piece uniforms had been mandatory for employees of the
military government, the ruling party and government-owned
industries since 1985.
   Ethiopian television viewers were surprised to see members of
the government delegation to recent talks with Eritrean rebels in
Atlanta dressed in suits and ties, a fashion long frowned on by the
military men who seized control of the country in 1974.

<HEAD>German Reunification Again Under Discussion as Changes Sweep Europe</HEAD>

<DATELINE>FRANKFURT, West Germany (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Three decades ago, a West German
politician said German reunification was a ``sleeping lioness''
that would awake one day with a mighty roar.
   Now, there is growing speculation the awakening may be at hand
to create a giant political and economic machine that could
dominate Europe.
   ``Reunification is coming closer, but I can't say whether it
will take 10, 15 or 20 years,'' says West German conservative
lawmaker Eduard Lintner. ``We have the impression that things are
much more concrete than we could have imagined five years ago.''
   The daily sight of thousands of refugees fleeing East German
leader Erich Honecker's hard-line Communist rule for the capitalist
West has revived international interest in the debate.
   Once dismissed as a nostalgic daydream, the idea of German
reunification has gotten a public nod from President Bush and
something short of a categorical ``no'' from President Mikhail S.
Gorbachev of the Soviet Union.
   The idea makes East German leaders virtually apopletic.
   ``If there were a free choice under the present circumstances in
the German Democratic Republic (East Germany), certainly 80 percent
to 90 percent would vote for national reunification with the
Federal Republic of Germany,'' added the 44-year-old Lintner in an
Associated Press interview.
   The West German constitution calls for a united Germany, but it
has not been a paramount concern of the West Germans in the years
since the ruins of Nazi Germany were divided into East and West at
the end of World War II.
   Full national reunification would completey rework the postwar
European order mapped out by the conquering Allies. It is a
prospect that creates unease in Britain and France, and in Poland
in the East bloc.
   London's prestigious Sunday Times on Sept. 10 mapped out a
possible scenario that includes massive troop reductions in Europe,
Honecker's death and further Westernization of Poland and Hungary.
   ``Moscow unilaterally abolishes the Warsaw Pact after guarantees
from Poland and Hungary they will not join other alliances,'' the
Times' futuristic view continued. ``West Germany withdraws from
NATO; and a referendum in both East and West Germany votes for
reunification and neutrality.''
   That sort of talk is being heard more and more as Moscow loosens
its hold on the East bloc and countries like the Soviet Union,
Poland and Hungary explore democratic reforms.
   The implications of pulling down the Berlin Wall and other
barriers to link the two German states are enormous and, for many,
ominous.
   As much of Western Europe heads towards its own unification in
1992, the economic center of gravity would be shifted even further
to the German side with a powerhouse of nearly 80 million people _
61.1 million West Germans and 16.6 million East Germans.
   West Germany is already Europe's largest exporting nation, and
despite its many flaws East Germany's economy is the envy of many
Soviet bloc neighbors.
   A unified Germany could become the political focal point of a
continent already in flux, as democratic movements sweep parts of
the Soviet bloc.
   Older generations recall eerie echoes of Nazi dictator Adolf
Hitler's boasting that he had brought about ``the unity of the
German nation.''
   Eva Kulesza, head of research for the Soviet Union and Eastern
Europe at the French Institute of International Relations, says she
believes that ``as far as public opinion there is new sort of
mistrust toward Germany.
   ``This new fear of Germany is linked to German economic trends.
Germany is much stronger, much more dynamic than France,'' she
added.
   Since West Germany and East Germany are at the front lines of
two competing alliances, any signs for eventual reunification would
have to come from Washington and Moscow.
   During a news conference last week in Montana, Bush said that
reunification is a ``matter for the Germans to decide.''
   But he added: ``If that (reunification) was worked out between
the Germanys, I do not think we should view that as bad for Western
interests.''
   For his part, Gorbachev evaded the issue during a news
conference in Bonn in June, saying only, ``the situation in Europe
today was determined by historical realities.''
   Outside Germany, political leaders and commentators have been
sharply divided on the issue.
   ``In thinking about the German Question, we ought not to be
governed by old prejudices and out-of-date assumptions,'' wrote
commentator Peter Jenkins in London's The Independent. ``The Cold
War was conducted in the name of freedom and, today, if the coming
of freedom to East Germany brings a desire for unity which finds
its echo in the Federal Republic, we ought not to be opposed.''
   Willy Brandt, the Social Democrat who sought greater ties to the
East as chancellor in the 1970s, said German unity doesn't
necessarily mean a single state although he called reunification a
``hypothesis that cannot be excluded.''
   As talk grows in the West, the positions against reunification
almost seem to harden in East Germany, as people leave the country
in near-record numbers. More than 100,000 East Germans are expected
to resettle in West Germany this year, leaving a gaping hole in the
Communist nation's work force.
   Little is likely to change in East Germany as long as the
77-year-old Honecker and his aging comrades stay in power.
   During a September 1987 visit to Bonn, Honecker called respect
for Europe's present borders a basic condition of peace.
   ``Socialism and capitalism can't be any more united than fire
and water,'' Honecker added on the issue of reunification.
   There are virtually no indications that Honecker's successors
will be inclined to democratic reforms, let alone joining the
capitalist West.
   The calls for reunification have already found a sympathetic ear
among some leaders of the Polish Solidarity movement, in the
country that suffered some of the Nazis' most brutal savagery.
   ``After all, the abnormal situation of the German nation
overshadows the whole of Polish-German relations,'' member of
Parliament Adam Michnik wrote on Monday in the pro-Solidarity daily
newspaper Gazeta Wyborcza, which he edits.
   The renewed talk of reunification is recalling the nearly
prophetic words of Reinhold Maier, a prominent West German state
governor who later went on to head the centrist Free Democratic
Party.
   ``Reunification is resting in our midst like a sleeping lioness.
Tired and weak, indecisive people in West Germany are trying not to
disturb her sleep,'' Maier predicted in 1955. ``The lioness will
one day wake up, blink, snap her her tail and start to roar.''
   Still, many in both East and West still agree with the 1967 quip
by Nobel Prize-winning French author Francois Mauriac: ``I love
Germany so much, I'm delighted that there are two of them.''

<HEAD>Captain Of Exxon Valdez Prepares Defense For Alaska Oil Spill Case</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: Also in Monday AMs report.</HEAD>

<DATELINE>HUNTINGTON, N.Y. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The man who was captain of the tanker
Exxon Valdez when it caused the nation's worst oil spill now
divides his time between lobstering on Long Island Sound and
meeting with lawyers preparing his defense.
   Joseph Hazelwood has refused interviews since the accident but
his attorneys agreed to talk to The Associated Press and describe
the captain's life as he awaits trial in Alaska. The trial is
scheduled for Oct. 30.
   ``Hazelwood feels terrible about the tragic accident,'' said
Michael Chalos, a prominent admiralty attorney who represents
Hazelwood.
   Hazelwood, 42, was fired by Exxon a few days after his tanker
struck a reef in Alaska's Prince William Sound on March 24, ripping
its hull and releasing nearly 11 millions gallons of crude oil.
   Hazelwood is saddened, Chalos says, by the environmental damage,
the harm to wildlife and the hardship it caused fishermen and
others.
   ``He loves Alaska,'' and had seriously considered two job offers
there before the accident, according to Chalos.
   Chalos and another Hazelwood attorney, Thomas Russo, outlined
their client's account of the accident.
   They contend the accident was the result of the failure of third
mate Gregory Cousins or helmsman Robert Kagan, or both, to properly
carry out Hazelwood's orders.
   They assert that Hazelwood was not drunk when the accident
occurred, and said not one witness testified at the National
Transportation Safety Board hearings that Hazelwood was intoxicated.
   His blood alcohol level was tested about 10 hours after the
grounding and found to be 0.061 percent, 50 percent higher than the
legal limit for a seaman operating a vessel. He has had a history
of alcohol abuse and has lost driver's licenses in two states
because of intoxication.
   The attorneys said Hazelwood had moved his ship out of shipping
lanes to maneuver around ice. They said he told Cousins to bring
the tanker back into the lanes and went to his cabin to do paper
work, but the return to the shipping lanes was delayed and Cousins'
directions to set the rudder to clear the reef were not carried out.
   Hazelwood now faces up to 12 years in prison and $150,000 fines
if convicted of the criminal charges of reckless conduct which
resulted in the spill.
   ``He has a very positive outlook on life although he is
apprehensive about the upcoming trial,'' said Chalos, a schoolmate
of Hazelwood's at New York Maritime College at Fort Schuyler.
   ``He hopes the people of Alaska haven't prejudged him on the
inaccurate reports they've read in the newspapers and seen on
television,'' he said.
   In the meantime, Hazelwood has faded into a quiet life at home
in the tree-lined community of Huntington, on the north shore of
Long Island about 50 miles from Manhattan. He, his wife, Suzanne,
and their 13-year-old daughter, Alison, have kept pretty much to
themselves, occasionally inviting friends and family over for a
barbecue.
   His spirits are good. He has received hundreds of letters from
Alaska and around the world, many of them from children; the
letters have become more supportive in recent months.
   To relax, he enjoys sailing his 16-foot catamaran. He also is an
avid reader and history buff, devouring any book on the sea. He is
said to be an expert on a famous seafarer, Capt. James Cook, who
explored the Alaska coast in the late 1770s.
   The sailing master for Cook's voyage was Lt. William Bligh; it
was Bligh Reef that the Exxon Valdez struck.
   Bligh was later promoted to captain. The crew of his ship, the
Bounty, mutinied in 1789 and set him adrift. He survived, returned
to England and, in 1791, resumed his naval career.
   Like Bligh, Hazelwood wants to return to the ocean.
   ``Right now, he is eager to get back to the profession he knows
and loves: His work as a captain at sea,'' Chalos said.

   Estella Gill got a special present for her
102nd birthday _ the chance to add another ``great'' to her name.
   Just hours before her birthday party at Oak Manor Nursing Home,
her great-great granddaughter Leandra Lawson gave birth to a
daughter.
   The 6-pound, 12-ounce girl, Mrs. Gill's
great-great-great-granddaughter, was named Ashley Marie Lawson.
   Family and friends helped celebrate the double birthday Saturday
with a large cake, cookies and punch at the nursing home.
   ``We had two candles on the table,'' said Charlene Anderson, 62,
a daughter from Springfield. ``And we sang `Happy Birthday.'''
   She said her mother was in good spirits, and just as lively as
she was on her 101st birthday and at a big Mother's Day party
attended by about 100 people.
   Mrs. Gill was born Sept. 23, 1887, near Waco, Texas. Some family
members contend she may actually be one year older, but birth
records back then were sketchy.
   Before the arrival of Ashley Marie, the family included five
daughters, seven grandchildren, 19 great-grandchildren and
25-great-great-grandchildren.

   There were only a few true Texans on
hand, but the tomato-throwing troops representing the Lone Star
state conquered Colorado's partisans in the annual Colorado-Texas
Tomato War.
   About 6,000 pounds of overripe tomatoes were tossed Saturday in
the contest, a sort of statement by longtime residents against
outsider-driven development at the nearby resort of Aspen.
   ``I used to own a hotel in the area and one day a woman from
Texas looked out over the mountains and said, `Sure is pretty out
there _ too bad someone ain't done nothing with it,''' explained
Taylor Adams, originator of the event.
   Shirley Vestring, one of the few true Texans in this year's
battle, found the fun wore a bit thin.
   ``It is really lonely,'' she said. ``I offered some of them my
Lone Star beer but no one would drink it.''
   This year's contest came complete with anti-war protesters, a
chanting group calling itself the Society for the Protection of
Overripe Tomatoes and led by Carl Zimmerman.
   ``We try to rescue wounded tomatoes and do the best we can while
they are in the dying throes,'' Zimmerman said.

   There's really nothing new under the collar,
despite what may have been written about the ``latest'' in necktie
knots.
   Delos Hinze says he was surprised to read a newspaper story that
touted as innovation the idea of tying a Windsor knot by starting
with the cravat inside-out.
   The Shelby knot has caught the eye of the national press since
being praised by a Milwaukee television newsman.
   ``I've been tying it that way for 35 years,'' Hinze said. ``It
just bothered me.''
   The novelty was supposed to have been proven by its absence from
a reference guide from the National Neckwear Association of America
called ``Getting Knotted _ 188 Knots for Necks.''
   But Hinze dug up a booklet he got from a Milwaukee clothing
store in the 1950s, and there it was, on Page 6.
   The booklet from Johnnie Walkers clothing calls it a reverse
half-Windsor.
   The store's still around, but the present staff isn't interested
in laying claim to the knot.
   ``I don't think people care too much about how they tie a tie,''
said David Kodner, Johnnie Walkers vice president.
   ``I'm left handed,'' said his store manager, Argil Zirbel, ``so
I've always tied it this way.''

   Fifteen-year-old Craig Price is in reform
school after confessing to killing four neighbors. Those connected
with the case hope he gets help there _ fast _ because he'll be
released by the time he turns 21.
   The stocky, barrel-chested youth was sentenced to six years in
the Rhode Island Training School after pleading guilty Thursday to
the Labor Day weekend murders of a mother and her two young
daughters, and the 1987 killing of a woman who lived two doors from
him.
   Before he was taken away, Price told his friends outside the
Kent County Courthouse: ``Later. When I get out I'm going to smoke
a bomber.''
   While justice moved swiftly in the Sept. 1 killings _ Price was
arrested two weeks after the slayings and pleaded guilty four days
later _ some are not convinced the punishment that will allow him
to be freed by age 21 fits the crime.
   State Attorney General James E. O'Neil, who pushed
unsuccessfully for legislation to allow prosecutors to try
juveniles under age 16 who face capital charges as adults,
expressed frustration that the sentence was the maximum allowed
under state law.
   ``It's a crying shame that it takes a tragedy to wake ... a
community up,'' O'Neil said.
   Police Capt. Ronald Carter said Price told investigators he
broke into a home two blocks away Sept. 1 to steal whatever he
could, and killed three people because he was afraid they would
identify him.
   Joan Heaton, 39, and her two daughters, Jennifer, 10, and
Melissa, 8, had been severely beaten and stabbed. Several of Ms.
Heaton's ribs were broken, and Melissa's skull was fractured.
   Carter said the viciousness of the crimes led police to link the
killings with that of Rebecca A. Spencer. Ms. Spencer, 27, was
stabbed 58 times the night before she was to move from the
neighborhood.
   Investigators said the 240-pound Price, who was repeating the
ninth grade, never showed any remorse for the killings.
   ``Iron Man,'' as the football-playing Price was known at school,
had a history of run-ins with the law. He had been placed on
probation for assaulting his sister two days before the Heatons
were killed, and he was put on probation last fall for burglary.

   Colombia's 4,600 judges, facing
persistent death threats from drug traffickers, said Sunday they
would strike if the government doesn't give them better protection.
   Also Sunday, the army said it had captured a suspected drug
trafficker wanted by the United States for extradition. Carlos
Gomez Zapata is not on the U.S. Justice Department's list of 12
most wanted drug traffickers.
   The son of a crusading newspaper editor killed by drug
traffickers said Sunday that Colombia's congress is cowardly and
corrupt in the government's fight against drug traffickers.
   Three bombs exploded late Sunday in Bogota, the capital city of
6 million, heavily damaging offices of three savings and loans
companies but causing no injuries, national police said.
   Late Saturday, bombs exploded in a theater, a city bus company's
garage and at a neighborhood headquarters of the ruling Liberal
party, injuring two people, police said.
   In the last month, 103 bombs have killed six people and wounded
130.
   Colombia's judges, fearing for their lives, said in a statement
issued through their labor union, the National Association of
Judicial Workers, that they will go on strike if immediate action
is not taken to address the dangers they face.
   Since 1981, about 50 judges and 170 judicial employees have been
killed. According to the union, at least 1,600 of Colombia's 5,000
judges have been threatened with death in the last 12 months.
   Union officials were to meet Monday with acting Justice Minister
Carlos Lemos Simmonds.
   ``We don't see any will on the part of the government to
increase security for our lives,'' union president Antonio Suarez
Nino said in the communique.
   The judges repeated previous demands for bulletproof cars and
vests, guards with metal detectors at their offices and other
security measures.
   Judges in Colombia earn about $400 a month. In interviews last
month many said they were forced to take buses to work because they
couldn't afford cars. A compact car here costs $20,000.
   Monica de Greiff, who resigned as justice minister last week
after being threatened by drug traffickers, said she was promised
$19 million in U.S. aid earlier this month for the purpose of
protecting judges. But the union said it has heard nothing since
about the aid.
   Colombia's army said Sunday it had captured a suspected drug
trafficker wanted by the United States for extradition.
   The army's 2nd Brigade, in the Caribbean coast town of
Barranquilla, said it had captured Gomez. It said Gomez has been
wanted on drug trafficking charges in Florida since 1985.
   Last month, Colombian government security forces claimed to have
arrested two Colombians wanted by the United States for
extradition. The two were released after the U.S. Justice
Department said it had no charges pending against them.
   U.S. Ambassador Thomas McNamara and other embassy employees have
refused to comment on extraditions.
   The anti-drug crusading newapaper El Espectador, in a column by
its editor, Juan Guillermo Cano, accused Colombia's congress Sunday
of being cowardly and corrupt.
   ``It is not a very admirable congress. Better yet, it is
cowardly...,'' Cano said in a signed column in the Bogota daily.
   His father, Guillermo Cano, was killed by drug traffickers in
1987 after the newspaper called on the government to crack down on
the traffickers.
   ``We have finally hit bottom,'' the column said Sunday, in the
harshest criticism of the congress ever published in a newspaper.
   Colombian newspapers have said 25 Colombian congressmen have
been denied visas to the United States because of links to drug
traffickers.
   The U.S. Embassy has denied comment, but the reports have caused
a furor in the congress.
   One of the country's biggest drug trafficking suspects, Pablo
Escobar Gaviria, was an alternate member of congress from 1982
until 1986. An alternate member votes during the absence of a
congressman, which happens frequently in Colombia.
   Four years ago a federal senator was accused of receiving drug
traffickers' money for his campaigns, but an investigation was
dropped when a bank microfilm supposedly showing receipt of the
funds disappeared.
   El Espectador has remained in the forefront of the war on drugs.
On Sept. 2, a 500-pound car bomb exploded near the paper's plant,
seriously damaging its press and other equipment.
   In Jerusalem, a retired army officer wanted in Colombia in
connection with the training of drug-cartel militias claimed Sunday
that an Israeli Embassy official offered to smuggle him from Bogota
for $10,000.
   Retired Lt. Col Yair Klein said Yossi Biran, the security chief
at Israel's embassy in Bogota, offered to smuggle him out of
Colombia in April after threats on Klein's life were reported in
the Colombian media.
   A spokesman for the Foreign Ministry said the claim was
``totally unfounded'' and that Biran would remain at his post.

<HEAD>Pope `Rehabilitates' Astronomer in His Hometown</HEAD>
<HEAD>By STEPHEN R. WILSON</HEAD>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>PISA, Italy (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   More than 450 years after the church tried
Galileo Galilei for heresy, Pope John Paul II came to the
astronomer's hometown and pronounced the words many Pisans have
longed to hear:
   Galileo was right and the church was wrong.
   The pope had previously said the Inquisition erred in condemning
Galileo for teaching that the earth revolves around the sun. But
his statements during a weekend trip to this Tuscan city were
viewed by its citizens as Galileo's official rehabilitation.
   Speaking Sunday at the University of Pisa, where Galileo studied
and taught in the late 1500s, John Paul said he wanted to recall
some of the school's illustrious alumni _ ``above all the very
great Galileo.''
   Shortly after his arrival in Pisa on Friday night, the pope
stood on a bridge over the Arno River, illuminated by flickering
candles, and declared:
   ``How can one not recall the name of that great man who was born
here and from here took the first steps toward immortal fame?
   ``Galileo Galilei, whose scientific work, imprudently opposed at
the beginning, is now recognized by all as an essential step in the
methodology of research and, in general, on the path toward the
knowledge of the world of nature.''
   Born in 1564, Galileo originally aroused antagonism when, as a
professor at the university from 1589 to 1592, he initiated
experiments on the laws of bodies in motion which contradicted the
accepted teachings of Aristotle.
   But he was most widely known for his support of the Copernicus
system, which taught that the sun is the central body and the earth
and the other planets revolve around it.
   That defied the church-held belief that the earth was the center
of the universe.
   In 1616, the church denounced the Copernicus system as dangerous
to faith, summoned Galileo to Rome and warned him not to uphold or
teach it.
   But he published a book supporting the theory in 1632. The next
year he was summoned to Rome, tried by the Inquisition and forced
to abjure his beliefs. Galileo was sentenced to life imprisonment,
which was later changed to house arrest. He died in 1642 near
Florence.
   John Paul has often spoken out on Galileo's behalf.
   In 1979, less than a year after his election as pope, he urged
the international scientific community to examine the Galileo case,
saying he hoped it would help remove the ``diffidence that still
prevents fruitful harmony between science and faith, and between
the church and the world.''
   John Paul appointed a Vatican commission in 1979 to study the
case. Five years later, the Pontifical Academy of Sciences issued
documents from secret Vatican archives, including details of the
Inquisition proceedings, which uphold Galileo.
   In his speech at the university on Sunday, the pope did not
address the Galileo case specifically. But he noted that religious
faith and science have often been at odds throughout the centuries.
   John Paul warned of potential moral and ethical abuses of modern
science but said faith and research are not incompatible.
   ``The church trusts, promotes and encourages your task,'' he
said.

   The roll call of six combat
photographers who died in Vietnam evoked painful memories and tears
at a memorial honoring them and 57 other journalists who were
killed covering that war.
   _Larry Burrows, Life Magazine, Henri Huet, The Associated Press,
Kent Potter, United Press International, killed in 1971 when the
helicopter in which they were flying was shot down while they were
covering a South Vietnamese offensive in Laos.
   _Michel Laurent, Pulitzer Prize-winning photographer, Gamma
Photo Agency, killed in an ambush two days before the war ended in
1975; he was the last western journalist killed.
   _Kyoichi Sawada, Pulitzer Prize-winning photographer, UPI,
killed in an ambush in Cambodia in 1970.
   _Huynh Thanh My, AP photographer, killed in a battle in the
Mekong Delta in 1965.
   After My was killed, his brother, Huynh Cong ``Nick'' Ut, then
only 17, took his place with the AP. Eight years later, Ut won a
Pulitzer Prize for his photo of a horrified Vietnam girl running
naked down a highway after a napalm strike by South Vietnamese
bombers seared her body.
   Ut, now based in Los Angeles, was among the more than 200
photographers, staff members and guests at the second-annual Eddie
Adams workshop who honored the journalists Sunday in this year of
the 150th anniversary of photography.
   ``I wish my mother and brothers and sisters (still in Vietnam)
would have been here to share this unforgettable moment and place
where our fallen comrades including my beloved brother are
posthumously being commemorated,'' Ut said in prepared remarks.
   ``I am at this very minute feeling very humble and very proud of
the achievements and sacrifices sustained by our fallen colleagues
including my brother.''
   Ut was so choked with emotion that he was unable to speak and
asked a colleague to read his remarks. ``I saw my brother's name
and I could not speak,'' Ut said afterward.
   The Marine Corps also paid tribute to the fallen journalists.
   ``They made the ultimate sacrifice in recording history for
people of all countries throughout the world,'' Commandant A.M.
Gray said in a message delivered by a staff member. ``Our nation
owes these journalists and photographers its honor, gratitude and
respect.''
   The ceremony was the idea of Adams, a Vietnam Pulitzer-Prize
winner himself. It was held on a hilltop on his workshop-farm in
the Catskills around a slate table inscribed with the first names
of the six photographers who were his best friends.
   Six small blue spruce trees were planted around the table, one
for each of the photographers. A seventh tree was planted in honor
of the other journalists killed in the war.
   Then, the men and women who had gathered, some who were only
toddlers during the Vietnam War, some with tears in their eyes,
lifted their champagne-filled glasses and toasted the fallen.

<HEAD>Pierce Faces Legal and Public Relations Challenge in HUD Testimony</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Former HUD Secretary Samuel R. Pierce faces a
daunting legal and public relations challenge when he appears
Tuesday before a House subcommittee investigating his old agency,
say lawyers who have helped many witnesses cope with
sometimes-hostile congressional inquiries.
   Potential pitfalls, even for the most blameless witness, range
from bad publicity to a perjury indictment.
   ``It's a very difficult forum,'' said Washington lawyer Abbe
David Lowell. ``There are fewer rules to protect witnesses than in
a court or even a grand jury. The power structure is very
one-sided.''
   Pierce has been subpoenaed by the House Government Operations
subcommittee to testify about alleged influence-peddling and
mismanagement at the Department of Housing and Urban Development,
an agency he ran for eight years.
   Paul L. Perito, one of Pierce's lawyers, has questioned the
subcommittee's fairness and complained that there is not enough
time to prepare Pierce to testify.
   While not disclosing specific strategies, Perito said, ``I
assure you, I am not going to let my client get kicked around.''
   Perito said the House panel ``seems to have made up its mind
that my client was involved in some wrongdoing despite the fact
there is not a shred of evidence to support such a finding.''
   ``In light of this, I must consider every viable and reasonable
professional option,'' Perito said.
   The Associated Press asked expert lawyers what advice they would
give to Pierce. Their advice:
   _Listen to the questions and limit any answer to what you know
to be the facts. Do not be afraid of qualifying any answer.
   _Anticipate what might be asked, and focus on the facts known
about those issues.
   _Be prepared to tell your story in a clear, concise and
consistent way.
   _Be aware of potential criminal charges, and of your right to
invoke the Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination.
   _Be aware of the news media attention your appearance will
generate.
   The subcommittee is expected to question Pierce about his role
in a number of controversial agency decisions to provide funding
for projects supported by well-connected Republicans.
   ``To some degree, it's like preparing for any testimony,'' said
James Hamilton, a Washington lawyer who 16 years ago served as
assistant chief counsel of the Senate committee investigating the
Watergate scandal. ``But there are peculiarities of the forum with
which you must deal.''
   Justin Simon, another Washington lawyer who has represented
congressional witnesses, noted that Pierce's legal team already has
laid a foundation for the former Cabinet officer's refusal to
cooperate with the House panel.
   ``Only in rare circumstances would it be advisable for an
individual who has potential criminal exposure to testify,'' he
said.
   ``By maintaining that Congress is not allowing enough time to
determine whether their client has a criminal problem, it becomes
very reasonable for a witness to rely on his Fifth Amendment right
even if convinced he did nothing wrong,'' Simon said.
   If Pierce invokes his right not to answer the panel's questions,
Simon added, ``He has to bite the bullet and take the adverse
publicity. It may raise the specter, although in theory it should
not, that the guy has something to hide.''
   Late Friday, Pierce exercised his right under House rules for
any subpoenaed witness to have all news media cameras and
microphones banned from the hearing room. Simon said that if he
were advising Pierce, he, too, would have advocated that move.
   Another option is testifying in executive session, with the
public excluded, but that tack is subject to the subcommittee's
discretion.
   ``It's important for a witness' lawyer to know the rules of the
particular committee,'' said Hamilton. ``For example, can the
witness make an opening statement?''
   Lowell said the paucity of ground rules forces a witness' lawyer
to be more aggressive.
   Attorneys like Brendan Sullivan, who was often combative when
representing Oliver North during testimony before a congressional
committee about the Iran-Contra affair, ``often have to depend on
the strength of their will to protect their clients,'' Lowell said.
   Simon agreed, noting that in Congress, unlike in court, ``there
are very few restrictions on what are viewed as relevant questions
_ almost anything is relevant in this forum.''
   The experts said Pierce, if he chooses to testify, faces a
thorny problem _ the threat of being accused of perjury _ if his
memory fails him or he falls into what Simon called the common trap
of ``remembering things in a way that reflects favorably on you.''
   ``And if his testimony disagrees with that of another witness,
it's a matter of who is believed,'' Simon said.

<HEAD>Shift Leaves Some Contras Out in the Cold</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Central America's shifting political landscape
has produced a more tolerant U.S. attitude toward Nicaragua's
leftist government and deepening hostility toward some Contra
rebels who once enjoyed red-carpet access here, according to U.S.
and rebel sources.
   The changed attitude toward the Sandinista government has been
subtle compared with the mutual recriminations and finger-pointing
that now characterize the relationship between the State Department
and some elements of Nicaragua's exiled opposition.
   By de-emphasizing military pressure against the Sandinista
government, the United States has moved away from the
confrontational policies of the Reagan administration and is now
pursuing peaceful but guarded coexistence.
   The shift has embittered some Contras. ``No one in the
resistance trusts the State Department,'' says Bosco Matamoros, a
rebel spokesman who is closely allied with veteran Contra leader
Adolfo Calero.
   Calero was once a regular visitor to the White House and the
State Department during the Reagan years but nowadays is treated
almost as an outcast by the Bush administration.
   Matamoros maintains that the State Department has refused even
to answer rebel correspondence while abandoning the Reagan
administration policy of avoiding all substantive contact with
Sandinista leaders. When a congressional delegation met recently
with President Daniel Ortega, a top State Department official
participated.
   Amid the ongoing debate over when the Contras should disband,
Matamoros said the State Department ``seems more interested than
the Sandinistas in demobilizing the resistance.''
   One continuing source of concern for the administration is
Soviet bloc military aid for the Sandinistas, estimated at $350
million for the first eight months of this year.
   The administration view is that the Contra leadership mantle has
passed from Miami-based civilians to battle-hardened Contra field
commanders who have risen through the ranks and are far more
qualified to represent the armed opposition to the Sandinistas.
   Officials talk disdainfully of the U.S. taxpayer-financed Contra
bureaucracy which has operated for years in Miami. Matamoros
accused State Department officials of grossly exaggerating the size
of the Contras' paid staff.
   By turning its back on Contra civilian leaders who have refused
to return to the region and by favoring the emerging military
commanders within the resistance, Matamoros says the Bush
administration is tacitly advocating a military coup despite its
stated preference for civilian supremacy.
   The administration's twin objectives for Nicaragua are to
support the internal opposition there as the country gears up for
national elections and to keep the armed resistance intact until
after the Feb. 25 balloting.
   The bulk of the rebel force is based at camps along the Honduran
border, living off U.S.-supplied humanitarian assistance.
   Central American presidents have called for the demobilization
of the rebels by Dec. 5 but the Bush administration regards that
deadline as irrelevant because the presidents also said that any
such process must be voluntary.
   The administration believes that the presence of rebel forces
along the border serves as an incentive for the Sandinistas to
fulfill their promise of a free and fair election.
   At the same time, the Bush administration is trying to devise a
way to assist Nicaragua's fledgling democratic process without
providing direct support to the campaign of the principal
opposition candidate, Violeta Chamorro. Meanwhile, the
administration seems willing to live with a Sandinista victory
provided the process is reasonably honest.
   Calero likens the more permissive U.S. attitude toward the
Sandinistas to the appeasement policies that led to World War II.
   ``Rather than pressing for military assistance, Secretary of
State James A. Baker joked about relocating the Contras to his
Texas ranch,'' Calero has written.
   Such an attitude, he said, could deprive Nicaragua of democracy
while damaging U.S. security interests in region.

<HEAD>Complaints, Not Agreement, Emerge From Talks on Strategic Weapons</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Lawmakers thrashing out a fiscal 1990 defense
plan are looking toward Senate action on a military spending bill
to help break the impasse over President Bush's budget request for
strategic weapons.
   House and Senate conferees, meeting behind closed doors on
authorization legislation, have made no progress on resolving their
differences over funding levels for Star Wars, land-based nuclear
missiles and the B-2 stealth bomber.
   Complaints, rather than agreement, have emerged after three
weeks of negotiations.
   ``The Senate still hasn't learned to do math,'' said Rep.
Patricia Schroeder, D-Colo., one of the House conferees. ``They
want everything and take it off somebody else's budget.''
   ``The thing is going nowhere,'' Rep. John Kasich, R-Ohio,
another House conferee, said Friday.
   Sen. James Exon, D-Neb., said the House came to the negotiations
with a series of votes that were ``all over the lot. They both
accepted and rejected every strategic program.
   ``This is one of the most difficult ones (conferences) I've ever
been in,'' he added.
   Initially, the House and Senate were far apart on the major
strategic programs.
   _On Star Wars, the Senate approved $4.5 billion, a slight cut in
Bush's request of $4.9 billion. The House adopted a budget of $3.1
billion for the missile shield.
   _On the multiple-warhead, rail-garrison MX missile, the Senate
endorsed Bush's request of $1.1 billion for the MX and $100 million
for the Midgetman. The House cut $502 million from the MX program
and eliminated all money for the Midgetman.
   _The Senate made a modest cut of $300 million in Bush's $4.7
billion proposal for the stealth bomber, the bat-winged aircraft
that at a cost of $530 million a copy has caused sticker shock. The
House limited production of the radar-evading plane to four over
the next two years _ half of what the administration requested.
   Last week, the House presented a revised proposal that restored
the MX money, left out the Midgetman and called for the chamber's
lower funding total on Star Wars, according to congressional
sources. The Senate rejected the plan.
   A counterproposal that left the original Senate bill relatively
intact was quickly turned down by the House.
   Setting the tone for future House-Senate negotiations on
strategic weapons will be Senate action, scheduled to get under way
today, on a $288.2 billion military spending bill. The Senate
Appropriations Committee approved about $3.7 billion for the
Pentagon's Star Wars program, which amounts to last year's level
plus inflation.
   Senate Republicans are expected to introduce amendments to raise
the funding level for Star Wars, formally known as the Strategic
Defense Initiative, to at least something closer to the
authorization total. But their efforts may have been hurt by a
statement from the administration released Friday.
   The Office of Management and Budget complained about the
restrictive language the Appropriations Committee put into the bill
which requires that $820 million of the $3.7 billion be used for
research on laser and particle beams.
   Sen. Bennett Johnston, D-La., sponsor of the amendment,
expressed concerns that the administration will sacrifice long-term
research on directed energy weapons in favor of a quick deployment
along the lines of the so-called ``Brilliant Pebbles'' scheme
favored by many in the administration.
   In its statement, the administration ``urged restoration of the
requested funding levels .. and removal of the restrictive SDI
language,'' but unlike a previous statement on the House
appropriations legislation, there was no veto threat.
   ``That will be a key test vote,'' Exon said. ``Once the Senate
speaks on that issue it puts into cement what the figure would be.''
   And the hope, according to Exon, is that a decision on Star Wars
will trigger a chain reaction of agreement on the other strategic
programs.
   ``Once the SDI number is resolved others will not easily fall in
place but likely will,'' he said.

   The commander of the local army
garrison knows the guerrillas will be back.
   They have attacked this mud-brick town a few miles from a major
air base three times this year but have not taken it. After each
foray they evaporate into the hills or surrounding villages.
   It is a tactic repeated throughout most of the country.
   ``They are not so near as they were before, but I don't know
exactly where they are,'' Col. Mobine Nurzi told reporters flown to
Shindand this month to refute guerrilla claims of capturing it.
   He said at least 100 guerrillas were killed in the latest,
weeklong assault on Shindand, about 425 miles southwest of the
capital city of Kabul and about 90 miles east of the border with
Iran, where some guerrillas are based.
   But one soldier told reporters, ``They really pounded us before
withdrawing. How do we know how many were killed?''
   After the Soviets withdrew their troops in February, the
U.S.-backed guerrillas were predicting their easy capture of
provincial centers like Jalalabad, if not Kabul itself.
   Now seven months later, their military campaigns remain
primarily the hit-and-run attacks that successfully drove the
Soviets out.
   But guerrilla tactics are not going to win the guerrillas a
civil war against the Kabul government or even much leverage at the
bargaining table.
   And the fatigue with the war rampant in the civilian population
after 10 years of fighting and 1 million deaths is also infecting
the mujahedeen guerrillas, or Islamic holy warriors.
   ``The mujahedeen have the capacity to harass the Kabul
government, but they are not going to win the war,'' said an Asian
diplomat, speaking on condition on anonymity.
   ``The average commander, the average fighter is tired,'' said
one U.N. official. ``There is battle fatigue, there is no doubt.''
   Yet the war wears on and the mujahedeen control most of the
countryside.
   Pilots on the runway in the southern city of Kandahar, fearing
guerrilla rockets, taxi at 100 mph.
   Troops at the last checkpoint in north Kabul before the Salang
Highway, the supply lifeline from the Soviet Union, report it was
recently closed by guerrilla attacks for a few hours on several
occassions.
   There is constant low-level combat that occasionally flares into
full-scale battles.
   At the daily press briefings, the government spokesman reports a
litany of ``sweeping and mopping up operations'' throughout the
provinces bordering Pakistan, where most of the mujahedeen are
headquartered.
   The repetition indicates the mujahedeen cannot be swept away but
that the government is confident they can be kept at bay for the
most part.
   ``Despite the attempts of the extremists, the situation in the
country is by and large calm,'' President Najib recently told a
group of foreign visitors.
   He referred with bravado to the massive supply convoy that just
arrived in Kandahar: ``Such a convoy rarely could exist even in the
presence of the Soviet troops.''
   But weeks of conflicting reports about when the 1,000 or so
vehicles would arrive indicated it had run into trouble.
   Mahmoud Baryalai, the first deputy prime minister in charge of
supplies, said earlier that the group of trucks was bogged down by
guerrilla rocket fire on the last 90 miles before Kandahar.
   It was not constant, he said, but prevented moving ahead.
   The mujahedeen claimed to have knocked out 110 trucks, while the
government said it lost three trucks and a tank. It said a year's
supply of ammunition got through.
   The convoy apparently veered off hundreds of miles into the
desert to avoid the attacks, eventually taking more than three
weeks to cover the 360 miles from the town of Torgundi on the
Soviet border.
   While sporadic attacks can interrupt supply routes, the
guerrillas have been unable to take a major town.
   A concerted attack on Khost, about 24 miles from the Pakistani
border, threatened the city briefly late last month. But diplomats
said the mujahedeen lacked the sustained supply routes needed to
overcome government forces surrounded by dense minefields and tanks.
   ``It is difficult for the mujahedeen to capture anything,'' said
another Asian diplomat in Kabul. ``They were trained as a guerrilla
force and they are trained to make conventional attacks. They lack
heavy artillery, air support.''
   The government uses both heavily. Dawn in Kabul is punctuated by
outgoing Scud and other missiles. Spotting Scud trails at night is
a favorite activity at diplomatic parties.
   The Scuds, with a range of 180 miles are used against mujahedeen
positions along the border.
   To knock out guerrilla positions around Kabul, Frog-7 missiles
with a range of about 48 miles were deployed late last month.
   The Continental Hotel, where most foreigners stay, shakes daily
from a nearby missile battery.
   The mujahedeen leaders in Pakistan have so far refused
negotiations. But there are only six weeks left before winter
weather sets in and most military activity stops because mountain
trails are impassable.
   Said one ambassador, quoting a visiting Englishman during the
wars of the last century: ``the only time the Afghans are at peace
is when they are fighting.''

   As a caricature, the entomologist is often
portrayed as a wispy, bespectacled man wearing tropical shorts and
pith helmet chasing exotic butterflies with a long-handled net.
   Sure, some of them do things like that. But many others perform
painstaking work that non-entomologists would see as sheer drudgery
_ the meticulous slow work of scientists.
   ``They save us a lot of grief,'' says Henry Becker III, an
information specialist in the Agriculture Department's main science
agency, the Agricultural Research Service. ``They certainly make
life easier for us by studying these insects, the good ones as well
as the bad ones.''
   Becker, in a recent telephone interview from his Beltsville,
Md., office, is one of those attending a two-day conference in
Washington on Tuesday and Wednesday that will commemorate the 100th
anniversary of the Entomological Society of America.
   Entomologists are intense about their experiments, he said. For
example, when they observe a parasite lay eggs in a destructive
beetle, for example, ``it's like they're watching their kids do a
virtuoso concert ... they really get excited.''
   But some entomological research ``is so plodding, such as
categorizing and cataloging insects,'' Becker said. ``But, yet,
they're very, very interested in what they're doing.''
   Today's society dates from the founding in 1889 of the American
Association of Economic Entomologists, and the 1906 beginning of
the Entomological Society of America. The two were merged, adopting
the latter's name, in 1953.
   The society, a non-profit educational group, says it is the
largest international association of entomologists, with more than
8,700 members.
   Becker, who claims his only experience with entomology is
``swatting flies and spraying cockroaches,'' said the society hopes
for an attendance of around 350 at its centennial symposium this
week. Some members from Britain, Canada and Australia are expected
to attend the sessions held at the Smithsonian Institution.
   Julius J. Menn, associate deputy area director for the Plant
Sciences Institute at USDA's research center in Beltsville, said
the symposium is unique in that it is directed at an intended
audience of ``decision makers who are not familiar with
entomology.''
   Menn said the sessions will be geared to legislators, federal
and state officials, industrial representatives, news media and
other non-entomological persons.
   Allen L. Steinhauer, head of the University of Maryland's
department of entomology, College Park, said more than 15
authorities ``on all aspects of insect-related research worldwide''
are on the program.
   A few of the program highlights provided by the society, which
calls itself ESA, illustrate what Steinhauer meant:
   In the first session, Carroll M. Williams of Harvard University
will talk about ``unraveling the secrets of insect life.'' Williams
is a pioneer researcher of insect development biology.
   ``He developed several novel techniques for performing surgery
on insects,'' the society said. ``One, which uses carbon dioxide
anesthesia, was adopted the world over.''
   Thomas Eisner, Cornell University, is the world's leading
authority on insect defenses and communication. His topic is the
insect as a chemist, describing the ingenious ways insects use
odors, poisons, plants and disguises to repel or injure a predator.
   ``Societies: Insect and Human'' is the topic of Edward O.
Wilson, Harvard University, who is called the father of modern
sociobiology and is an expert on ants. He says biological laws are
the basis of social behavior among ants and humans. Wilson won a
Pulitzer Prize for general non-fiction in 1979 for ``On Human
Nature,'' about the influence of genetically determined pattens of
human behavior.
   Other sessions will include talks on entomology in the
developing world, insects in agriculture, the impacts of insects on
public health, applying biotechnology to entomology, and policies
for the future.
   Looking ahead, Donald L. Mclean of the University of Vermont
will describe entomology in the 21st century. He is an expert on
the relationship between several insects and the diseases they
cause on many important crops.

   The Agriculture Department has a hot-line for
foliage watchers.
   Stanley Krugman, director of timber management research for the
department's Forest Service, said the hotline carries a recorded
message featuring areas of ``especially beautiful fall color'' as
they occur in national forests throughout the United States.
   The hotline began operation on Sept. 15 and will continue
through the fall season, he said. The number is (202) 475-3780.
   Krugman said some pockets of fall color are occurring earlier
than usual this year, which could be due to unusual temperatures,
moisture or drought.
   ``Where I live, in northern Virginia, the wet spring and early
summer followed by almost drought-like conditions in August, have
triggered some early fall color, especially at the higher
elevations,'' he said.
   But most color changes are caused by the longer nights and
shorter days.
   ``Most people think frost plays a major role in the beautiful
colors,'' Krugman said. ``Cooler weather can be a factor, but color
changes are primarily brought on by the increasing hours of
darkness that accompany the fall season.''
   Many of the vivid colors are in the leaves year-round but are
hidden by dominant green color during the summer months. As autumn
approaches, the chlorophylls _ which produce the green as sunlight
is used to produce plant food _ decrease and the other pigments are
apparent.
   New England is famed for its foliage splendor, but Krugman said
there are opportunities for viewing magnificent colors in most of
the states. Michigan alone offers 65 species of trees that produce
color, more than any other state, he said.
   The Rocky Mountains offer the splendor of the quaking aspen, and
the Pacific Northwest has the western larch, which Krugman said is
``an unusual deciduous conifer whose needles turn yellow and drop
from the tree.''

<HEAD>Despite New Friends, Crowe Still Has Wary View of Soviets</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SUSANNE M. SCHAFER</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A good number of Soviet military caps have
been added to the collection of Adm. William J. Crowe, chairman of
the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and a sword-wielding statue of Mother
Russia stands guard on his Pentagon desk.
   But the nation's premier military leader says that despite the
new spirit of U.S.-Soviet cooperation he's helped foster, America
must be aware that Soviet military power has not abated.
   ``The same thing we feared for years is essentially still
there,'' the admiral observed in an hour-long interview looking
back over his 43 years in active duty.
   This week marks the end of Crowe's four-year tenure as chairman
and principal military advisor to the president. President Bush is
scheduled to attend a last salute to Crowe on Friday at the U.S.
Naval Academy in Annapolis, Md., the admiral's alma mater.
   Army Gen. Colin Powell was confirmed by the Senate last week to
succeed Crowe on Oct. 1. At 52, Powell is the youngest person and
first black to hold the post.
   Much has changed during his time in the military, the admiral
noted.
   ``When I came to the Naval Academy, you never heard of lasers,
you never heard of nuclear power, you never heard of missiles, you
never heard of pantyhose, you never heard of VCR's, and you didn't
have very sophisticated deodorants,'' Crowe said. The last item in
particular, he said with a laugh, has made an amazing improvement
in ``the quality of life'' aboard Navy ships.
   The admiral's job switch comes as Crowe has put in motion some
of the most extensive military-to-military exchanges with the
Soviets since the two nations were allies in World War II.
   Crowe also has overseen the introduction of congressionally
ordered reforms that made him the leader of the chiefs of the
nation's military services, not just their spokesman.
   The 64-year-old admiral spent 10 days in the Soviet Union in
June, and hosted a visit to the United States last year by his
Soviet counterpart, Marshal Sergei Akhromeyev.
   The admiral, whose speech still bears a twang from his Oklahoma
roots, adopted an affectionate tone when he spoke of his
counterpart.
   ``I've become very friendly with Marshal Akhromeyev. I've
enjoyed my association with him, my talks with him, his wisdom and
his feeling for his country,'' the admiral said. The two men intend
to continue their contacts even after he leaves office, he added.
   Crowe was able to see military facilities that had been barred
to Westerners for years. He visited sites that drove home the
Soviet's huge losses in World War II, such as the massive statue
that marks the lengthy battle with the Nazis for Stalingrad, a
turning point in the war.
   ``That's the memorial _ Mother Russia,'' Crowe said as he
pointed to the replica figure on his desk. The stern-looking woman,
holding high a saber, is exhorting her sons to rise in the defense
of their homeland. ``It's so big, you can see it for miles,'' Crowe
recalled.
   The admiral said his outstanding impression from the exchange is
that people in both nations ``enjoy a lot in common _ they want to
live in peace, they want their families to be better off, they want
their children to have a better life than they did.''
   But the chairman noted that despite Soviet President Mikhail
Gorbachev's touted military budget cuts and troop and tank
withdrawals, ``very little has changed. They've just put it in
different places.''
   Asked about the dramatic reforms attempted by Gorbachev, Crowe
said he thinks the superpower is ``in flux, economically, socially,
politically and security-wise.''
   ``They don't know what they're doin'. They've got a vision ...
but they don't know how to engineer it. They're feeling their way
as they go,'' Crowe said.
   This has led to frustrations and uncertainty, including doubts
about how long Gorbachev and his supporters can continue to ``be
solidly entrenched in power'' when his goals are not achieved.
   ``My instincts tell me ... that we exaggerate this problem,''
Crowe said, adding that he also believes Americans ``exaggerate
their power.''
   He hastened to add, however, that this is a ``characteristic of
all militaries _ you exaggerate the other fellow's (power) and
underestimate your own.''
   While Crowe was the object of some criticism earlier this year
for saying that he does not view the Soviets as an enemy, the
chairman said he stands by that statement. But he emphasized that
he continues to view the Soviet Union as a ``potential adversary.''
   The admiral said he likes to quote a general who says America
shouldn't teach its military to have an enemy, but to know ``what's
worth livin' for, what's worth dyin' for, what's worth fightin' for
in this country.''
   ``If we can't perform a function unless we have an enemy and
somebody to hate, then we're in pretty bad shape,'' the admiral
said.

<HEAD>Government Not Reimbursed for Private Use of Blair House, Report
Says</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>

   Private groups hosted events last year at
Blair House without paying the government for use of the
presidential guest house, according to a State Department report
critical of the facility's management.
   The report, prepared by the department's inspector general late
last year, also says a number of Blair House employees had not
undergone security background investigations ``notwithstanding the
fact that the United States government's most important guests are
lodged in it and sensitive meetings take place there.''
   A copy of the report, which was released in January, was
obtained by The Associated Press under the Freedom of Information
Act.
   Kathleen Mullen, executive director of the State Department's
Office of Protocol, said many recommendations in the 12-page report
have been put into place. Security checks, for instance, were
finished before the final draft of the report was released, she
said.
   Those without clearances included the curator's assistant, three
management personnel and 49 contract employees who worked only
during official visits, the report said.
   Additionally, some contract maintenance employees who were
supposed to have an escort in Blair House ``were seen walking
unescorted in the building,'' the report said.
   Blair House, which consists of four connected town houses on
Pennsylvania Avenue across from the White House, traditionally has
been managed by the State Department under the chief of protocol.
An associate department curator, who is in charge of arts and
antiques at the historic, 115-room house, also works there.
   Blair House was closed for restoration between 1982 and
mid-1988. The first foreign visitor to stay in the refurbished
house came in September 1988.
   Anthony Quainton, the deputy inspector general who wrote the
report, said several ``non-official groups, some of which included
donors to the restoration project, have hosted events at Blair
House.''
   The chief of protocol approved the events under the proper
guidelines, but the groups were not charged for use of the building
because of a loophole created by the department's legal adviser.
   Quainton recommended establishing firm procedures for
``reservations, billing and payment by private sources.''
   Selwa Roosevelt, chief of protocol in the Reagan administration,
said that when the house was reopened the Blair House Restoration
Fund, the private charitable organization established to channel
gifts to Blair House, was allowed to host a series of events to
``give everyone who participated a chance to see this wonderful
project.''
   Other than groups arranged by the fund, no private organizations
were allowed to use the house.
   The fund raised about $5 million for the $13 million Blair House
restoration. Some $4 million of the privately raised money paid for
furniture, draperies, carpets and upholstery.
   Quainton suggested a number of changes to ensure the
``hotel-cum-museum'' be maintained properly and operate smoothly in
1989, when as many as 30 official visits from foreign dignitaries
were expected, and beyond.
   Quainton reported that:
   _Extreme tension arose between the Blair House managers, who
sought to run a ``first-class hotel,'' and the department's
associate curator who emphasized the ``museum nature'' of the
facility.
   ``Housekeeping decisions _ down to questions of dusting and
silver polishing techniques _ have become contentious,'' the report
said.
   Clement Conger, the department's curator, said the problems
stemmed from personality conflicts between Blair House managers and
the former associate curator, who has resigned.
   _Blair House is ``leanly staffed'' at periods of full activity.
``At such times, management will be running an exclusive 30-bed
hotel,'' catering state dinners and luncheons and providing routine
meals, valet and personal services to high-ranking delegations.
   Between guests, the house is used by top government officials,
usually for official functions.
   _Procurement ``procedures were haphazard at best,'' the report
said. A ``relatively inexperienced and untrained junior employee
with no background in financial management'' handled most
government expenditures. Private money raised to support Blair
House was co-mingled with government funds, and one account had
been reduced to $5.
   The report recommended appointment of a financial manager,
consolidation of budget accounts and an increase in the amount of
money allocated to Blair House to ensure it is properly maintained.

   This city has lost one of its most effective
soldiers in the war on drugs, and it hardly noticed.
   A drug trafficker's bullet that pierced the throat of Rafael
Orelle Pazo in July ended the 13-year career of one of Miami's most
productive undercover informants, drug enforcement officials said
this week.
   Orelle, a 44-year-old Cuban immigrant who never had a formal
education, began undercover operations that resulted in hundreds of
arrests and removed at least a ton of cocaine from the streets,
officials said.
   ``No one worked like Rafael,'' said Peter Sarron, a Drug
Enforcement Administration agent who worked with Orelle daily for
the past five years.
   Orelle died without fanfare, but his life offered an unusual
glimpse into the methods of drug enforcement.
   DEA agents said the risky activities of people like Orelle are
the only way to penetrate smugglers' shadowy networks.
   ``He was an inspiration to the DEA,'' said spokesman Lynn
Wheeler. ``He knew the danger was there but he still came through
with all this information, day after day, year after year.''
   The agency agreed to rare interviews on the subject because
officials considered Orelle a cut above other informants.
   ``Quite often the people who assist us in narcotics cases are
not pillars of the community,'' said DEA spokesman John Fernandes,
describing Orelle as an exception. ``He was just a concerned
citizen.''
   A short, balding man who walked with a limp after being stricken
with polio as an infant, Orelle had to wear a weightlifting belt to
support his bad back and considerable paunch.
   Born in poverty and unable to read or write, Orelle eventually
would make more than $50,000 a year supplying information.
   His undercover career began in 1976, when he was hired to lay
tile in the home of a major marijuana trafficker and saw piles of
cash and a room-size safe being installed under the garage.
   ``He came to the DEA and offered his services,'' said Coral
Gables Lt. Harold Hopkin. ``We gave him $500.''
   After police seized 23 tons of pot and sent the trafficker to
prison, Orelle found regular work with Miami-area police and
federal agents.
   According to court records, Orelle didn't always operate on the
right side of the law.
   In 1967, when he was struggling to find construction work to pay
his rent, he was charged in a dozen burglaries. Orelle pleaded
innocent by reason of insanity and spent a year in a mental
hospital.
   In 1979, Orelle and another informant were caught impersonating
police officers and offering to fix the case of an accused drug
trafficker for $7,000.
   Orelle pleaded guilty to a lesser theft charge and was paroled.
State prosecutors told police they no longer considered him a
trustworthy informant, effectively blackballing him from Dade
County courts.
   But, ``because of his value we began working with him again,''
said the DEA's Sarron.
   During the past five years, the period for which records were
available, Orelle initiated about 50 cases, leading to 150 arrests.
Thanks to his efforts, agents seized about $2 million in cash, $3
million in property, tons of marijuana, more than 1,000 kilos of
cocaine and a quarter-million illegal sedatives.
   But Orelle's identity became more known among dealers in Miami's
Latin community each time he testified in court.
   ``It always amazed a lot of us that he stayed alive so long,''
said Jerome Sanford, a public defender who first met Orelle in
1977, when Sanford was a prosecutor.
   It all caught up with him July 14.
   Working with Sarron and DEA agent Kevin Stephens, Orelle posed
as a dealer wanting to buy 20 kilos of cocaine from Jose Peralta,
an accused smuggler.
   Before they could discuss prices, Peralta and a gunman, Octavio
Sanchez, fired a spray of bullets, authorities said. A slug
matching Sanchez' gun hit Orelle in the throat, said prosecutor
Michael Cornely.
   Orelle bled to death.
   Sanchez, Peralta and his alleged getaway driver have been jailed
and face first-degree murder and cocaine-trafficking charges.
   Isabelle Orelle, the informant's 43-year-old widow, says her
three teen-age children remain fiercely proud of their father.
   Her 16-year-old son wants to be a DEA agent when he grows up.
   ``I'm trying to get his mind off it,'' Mrs. Orelle said. ``I
tell him `I'm going to live the rest of my life in fear, and your
wife and kids will be the same. You can do something about drugs in
other ways.'''

<HEAD>WASHINGTON TODAY: Education Summit an Opportunity for Political Posturing</HEAD>
<HEAD>An AP News Analysis</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DONALD M. ROTHBERG</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Political Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The lines already are drawn and they don't
give beleaguered parents a lot of hope that the education summit
between President Bush and the nation's governors will produce more
than the familiar political posturing over the need to improve
schools.
   Well in advance of Wednesday's opening of the two-day summit,
the White House was emphasizing the need for ``leadership'' and
``new ideas.'' New York Gov. Mario Cuomo and many of his
counterparts were responding, ``Send money.''
   The likelihood is that it will take a lot of both to upgrade
schools.
   Most Americans agree that education is too important to be left
to educators. Now the Charlottesville, Va., summit will focus
attention on whether politicians are up to the task.
   The most optimistic prospect is that the president, his cabinet
and the governors will sit down and have a serious exchange of
ideas. As the officials at the table who are the closest to the
problem, the governors can give the president plenty of examples of
what works and what doesn't.
   They have experience finding the improvements that can be made
within the context of strained budgets.
   The White House also is emphasizing the fact this is only the
third time in history a president has convened a summit with the
nation's governors. The first took place in 1908 when Theodore
Roosevelt summoned the governors to discuss ways to preserve
natural resources. Twenty-five years later, Franklin D. Roosevelt
convened a summit to discuss ways to deal with the Depression.
   By stressing the historic significance of the meeting, White
House aides and governors hope the meeting will mobilize public
support for strong action to improve schools.
   ``Most Americans still believe that when we talk about a crisis
in education, we are talking about someone else's kid in some other
school,'' said Gov. Thomas Kean of New Jersey, a Republican who has
been in the forefront of educational reform.
   ``If the presidential summit can turn that attitude around and
highlight the need for a national focus on education, that will be
a major achievement,'' said Kean.
   It may take more than a two-day summit to change that attitude
at a time when the issue of drugs dwarfs all other concerns.
   ``Drugs are so dominant in terms of the agenda, I'm not sure any
of the other things pop up,'' said pollster Peter Hart. ``I'm not
sure the public is going to pay attention.''
   While skeptical of the prospects that the summit can grab a
share of public attention from drugs, Hart said it's as good a way
as any to try.
   ``It certainly makes the issue a lot more important,'' he said.
   But if the elements are present for a successful meeting, so too
are they present for a session dominated by politicking.
   The president finds it hard to resist his ``read my lips''
rhetoric on spending and taxes, drawing lines that don't
necessarily permit consideration of a proposal's merits.
   Arguing with congressional Democrats over differing proposals to
combat drug abuse, Bush told a news conference in Montana last
week, ``There's a certain frustration level when we come out with a
sound program and two answers come out: spend more and raise
taxes.''
   The Democrats often leave the impression they are obsessed with
a need to define themselves and their role in dealing with national
problems.
   Not invited to the economic summit were the Democrats who
control Congress. They responded by announcing six ``National Goals
for Educational Excellence.''
   Bush wants to be known as the ``education president,'' but Sen.
Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass., said, ``We intend to do all we can to
see that this Congress matches him by becoming the `education
Congress.'''
   The structure of the summit was designed by the White House and
is geared to assure that the president is the dominant figure. The
only formal sessions open for press coverage will be Bush speeches.
   It's a format that has governors uneasy and looking for ways to
make their views known. The result could be a circus atmosphere as
governors mingle with the press corps and invite questions.
   No one is predicting the summit will produce any quick answers
or even an agenda for progress in education. What all sides appear
to want is a meeting that will energize federal and state officials
to work together in the future with an awareness that their bosses
are committed to accomplishing something.

<HEAD>Rare Italian Etchings on View</HEAD>

   When they put up a 300-ton Egyptian obelisk in
St. Peter's Square more than 400 years ago, it was such a delicate
operation that Pope Sixtus V pronounced a sentence of death in
advance against anyone who let out a peep as it was pulled from the
ground.
   The normally noisy Roman crowd was silent as the winches creaked
and 140 horses panted. Then things began to slip and the whole
project was in danger, including the 2,800-year-old obelisk.
   The voice of an Italian sailor broke the silence.
   ``Throw water on the ropes!'' he yelled.
   They did. Ropes tightened around the capstans and the obelisk
began to rise again. It is still there. Not only was the obelisk
saved and the sailor reprieved, but his village got the exclusive
right to sell palm fronds in the square on Palm Sunday.
   That was the story told by Richard Wallace, professor of art
history at Wellesley College, who helped select work for the show
called ``Italian Etchers of the Renaissance and Baroque.'' It
opened Sunday at the National Gallery of Art to begin the fall
season. Wallace said he believed the village still enjoys its
privilege.
   One of the etchings, Natale Bonifacio's ``Moving the Vatican
Obelisk,'' does not exactly prove the story but it does show the
huge engineering job in tiny detail. Horses strain, workmen help.
There were 800 of them and one seated on the tip of the obelisk
guides the most important rope.
   The exhibit has 135 etchings made between 1520 and 1700.
   Some of the etchers were also famous painters like Michelangelo
Caravaggio, Claude Lorrain, Luca Giordano, Annibale Caracci and
Salvatore Rosa. Others are little known, even to specialists.
Bonifacio is not believed to have done any paintings.
   Wallace explained to reporters that etching was one of the first
ways of making art available in many copies _ 20 to 50 from each
copper plate. It was also a handy way for poor artists to make
money.
   Many of the plates are still in Rome in the storehouse called
the Calcografia. Wallace said that until the 1970s, employees
there, for a small fee, would print a fresh but greatly inferior
copy from selected plates. He added that for an even smaller fee
they would leave off the stamp certifying it as a late copy, so an
unscrupulous purchaser could sell it to an inexperienced collector
as an original.
   Then a new director stopped the practice.
   Before etching became popular some artists made engravings by
cutting a metal plate with a metal tool. But an etcher could just
draw with a needle on a soft covering like paint, called a
``ground,'' which was spread over the plate. Then he or she would
let acid eat into the metal through the lines that the needle had
drawn. The grooves could then hold ink for printing.
   ``I've done both,`` Wallace said. ``Etching is easier than
pen-and-ink drawing, especially with a quill pen. Engraving is like
plowing. Etching is like ice skating.''

   The jacaranda petals went limp with
water. A Buddhist monk gave the yellow flower a quick shake and the
prayer service began.
   Chants filled the vault of ashes. Hands clasped in front of him,
Pun Samaly bowed three times for the soul of his mother.
   A Khmer Rouge guerrilla attack killed her in July while she was
on a trip to her native village.
   Samaly, joined by brothers, sisters, neighbors, his wife and
daughter, gathered over the weekend in a riverside pagoda to
commemorate her death.
   ``I only hope the death like the one suffered by my mother can
stop in this country,'' Samaly said, speaking in French, as he sat
on a straw mat, facing a small silver urn that held his mother's
ashes.
   ``But all we little people can really do is pray.''
   In Cambodia, the last two weeks in September are called the
Phumben, a Buddhist holiday to remember the dead. Throughout this
predominantly Buddhist nation of 8 million, families flock to
pagodas to burn joss sticks, bow, chant and sit for the souls of
their ancestors.
   ``But many too are praying not just for the past but also for
the future,'' said Kah Ramh, an elderly monk at the pagoda. ``This
is an important time we are facing now.''
   This year the festival for the dead coincides with the announced
withdrawal of the last 26,000 of Vietnam's soldiers from Cambodia.
Vietnam invaded its neighbor almost 11 years ago, ousting the
ultra-radical Khmer Rouge government and replacing it with a
pro-Hanoi regime.
   Vietnam says it lost 55,000 soldiers in their battles with the
Khmer Rouge. Cambodia says it lost 20,000.
   Now, with the Vietnamese saying their last soldier will be out
by Tuesday, many Cambodians are worried that their country will
again slide into civil war.
   Already there are reports of fierce fighting on the Thai border,
and the government is acknowledging that Khmer Rouge forces hold
some territory.
   On Sunday, when the Samaly's prayed, the pagoda was packed.
Today, it was deserted as hundreds of troop trucks carrying
Vietnamese soldiers rumbled by.
   ``We must always remember the old woman Samaly,'' said one of
her neighbors during the prayers. ``Any of us could have died like
her. We must never forget.''
   An elderly nun, sitting among the Samaly clan, lit some incense
and a sweet smell hung low in the air, cool and wet in the
underground darkness.
   The vault of ashes used to be filled with the urns of hundreds
of Cambodians but during the Khmer Rouge rule from 1975 to 1978 it,
like all the other pagodas in Cambodia, was cleared out and used as
a warehouse.
   Now, the small wood and glass cases are slowly being graced
again with the mementos of the dead _ a photograph and a candle, a
lithograph and a flower.
   During the Khmer Rouge regime, all monks were defrocked and
thousands were killed. When the pro-Vietnamese government was
installed, it brought Buddhism back but persecution continued.
   Pagodas were taxed by the state and only men over 55 could
become monks. Only in the past year has the government allowed its
people to actively return to the practice of Buddhism.
   Since mid-1988, state-run radio has been broadcasting Buddhist
prayers. State leaders, including Prime Minister Hun Sen, have
appeared at Buddhist ceremonies and the age restriction on entering
the Buddhist clergy has been lowered to 10.
   Still, the government appears firmly committed to keeping
Buddhism a state-run religion. Its aim is to prevent a return of
the 1950s when pagodas and Buddhist schools served as the
well-spring of progressive and revolutionary political thought.
   ``The state and religion are not separated,'' Tep Vong,
Cambodia's top Buddhist, was quoted recently as saying.
   Another factor working against a Buddhist resurgence is an
apparent lack of interest in religion among Cambodia's youth.
   Youthful giggles broke out during the Samaly clan's prayers.
None of the children knew the chants and the three teen-agers
present refused to follow along.
   Tea Somaly, grandson of the deceased, said his father, Pun, had
forced him to come.
   ``On Sunday, I usually go to the video parlor to see a Hong Kong
movie,'' said the 15-year-old. ``I like the action and Kung Fu.''
   He said he also was worried about the future of his country but
didn't think prayers would help.
   ``What can that do?'' he asked. ``It just wastes time.''
   Outside, on the pagoda grounds, hundreds of Cambodians knelt in
prayer to pay tribute to the dead. Jacaranda petals scattered in
the wind.
   ``We put these in the Khmer Rouge guns when they came into the
city in 1975,'' said an old monk holding a flower. ``These people
are praying we don't have to do that again.''

<HEAD>One Billion People Ill or Hungry, World Health Organization Says</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Developed countries have the tools to end the
``preventable tragedy'' of disease and malnutrition that afflicts 1
billion people worldwide, the World Health Organization says.
   The 1 billion figure means one of every five humans suffers from
disease or malnutrition, WHO director-general Dr. Hiroshi Nakajima
said Sunday, adding that the greatest burden of disease is in poor
countries of Africa, Asia and South America.
   ``This is a preventable tragedy because the developed world has
the resources and technology to end common diseases worldwide,'' he
said in a statement accompanying a WHO report. ``The missing
ingredient is the will to help the developing countries.
   ``The rich countries must transfer technology, health manpower
and money, because the poorest countries can't help themselves,''
Nakajima said.
   He said health expenditures in the poorest countries average
about $5 per person, while in the United States, Canada, Japan and
western Europe, health expenditures average about $400 a person.
   Despite the gloomy picture, Nakajima said health care has
improved enough n the last 40 years to raise human life expectancy
from 41 to 59.7 years in the developing countries.
   Accomplishments in recent decades include the eradication of
smallpox and new measures to control river blindness, a major cause
of blindness in tropical regions.
   The last case of smallpox was reported in 1979. Eradicating the
disease has saved an estimated 20 million lives worldwide, the WHO
said.
   Aerial spraying for blackflies, which carry river blindness, has
protected about 4 million children from the disease, the WHO
estimates. A new drug is being distributed now to treat those
already infected.
   And by the year 2000, the WHO predicts the eradication of polio,
a disease now striking about 208,000 children annually. Almost all
the victims are in developing countries.

   A minister of an affluent church prayed
for speedy damage settlements, and less fortunate victims of
Hurricane Hugo lined up in drizzling rain for free barbecue and
milk to feed their babies.
   ``If you don't have money, you're in trouble,'' Carlotta Dennis
said after visiting a food van parked at the Citadel Square Baptist
Church. ``You can't get the money out of the bank because the
electricity is off.''
   The van, operated by volunteers from the Alabama Baptist State
Convention, fed an estimated 2,000 people Sunday. It is one of 30
such vans.
   ``It tells me there's a lot of hungry people and that's what
we're here for,'' said spokesman Emmette Jones of Montgomery, Ala.
``A lot of them will go through the line a dozen times but that's
beside the point because they're hungry.''
   Nearby, the Rev. James E. Hampton, rector of St. Philip's
Episcopal Church, asked for divine help in processing insurance
claims of his well-to-do congregation.
   ``We pray, Lord, that all who have lost something may begin the
process of recovery,'' he said. ``We pray specifically for
insurance agents that they may be motivated by a sense of fairness
and urgency.''
   With a city-wide power outage expected to last weeks, many
residents can't cook. Water service has been restored, but
residents were told to boil it before drinking.
   There has been no mail since the storm, delaying some paychecks.
But even if the checks had arrived, no banks were open to cash them.
   Amid the debris hurled about by the storm's 135 mph winds, needy
people lined up in a parking lot Sunday for barbecue chicken, sweet
corn, butter beans and a slice of bread. Volunteers also handed out
milk and bottled water.
   A few blocks away, more affluent victims sipped beer and munched
on chicken salad sandwiches at Aaron's Deli, one of the few
downtown restaurants to reopen.
   ``My husband and I are so fortunate,'' said Sylvia Hyman, wife
of the owner. ``My studio upstairs was untouched. My sculptures _
nothing _ was damaged.''
   Mrs. Hyman said she was impressed with the community spirit in
some neighborhoods where homeowners have joined together in
clearing roads with chainsaws and assisting in other cleanup
efforts.
   Aaron Hyman predicted people who had steaks and seafood in their
freezers will eat well for a few days. But the food will spoil
without refrigeration. The outage is expected to last several weeks.
   ``What happens in two weeks?'' Hyman asked. ``They'll have eaten
it or thrown it away.''
   Renildo Holmes, one of the needy people who accepted a free meal
at the disaster van, said he had no food.
   ``I eat where I can get a meal,'' said Holmes, 26. ``My
neighborhood looks like a trash barrel. Everything is out _ trees,
light poles and cars overturned.''
   Ms. Dennis visited the van with her husband, Gussie, and
9-year-old daughter, Presha.
   Dennis, a shipyard worker, said the family has no meat and no
electricity for cooking. His roof was damaged, but Dennis said he
has covered the exposed area with plastic.
   Elsewhere, Tom Palmer, co-owner of an outdoor catering company,
fed needy people barbecue, hotdogs and rice from a portable grill
hooked up to his pickup truck.
   ``We're just trying to provide a hot meal,'' said Palmer. ``Hey,
the people need it. There are people (who) have not eaten for three
days. If they can find us, then we're all better off.''
   Lamont Walker waited for hotdogs with two of his five children.
He said the storm damaged his roof and blew out his windows.
   ``We're all sleeping in one room because the roof leaks,'' he
said. ``Ain't no money coming through. I have to scramble for my
family _ make sure they get something to eat.''
   A French restaurant near City Hall opened two days after Hugo
ripped through the city. Customers often discuss their storm
experiences while sipping red wine or imported beer in a cozy
setting.
   Paul Geiss, between sips of wine, said his home and business
were not damaged by Hugo's winds, but about a dozen trees were
toppled in his yard.
   He and his wife, Beth, rode out the storm in their downtown
jewelry store. Since then, they have stayed in an apartment above
the store to protect it from looters.
   ``We just want to be on the safe side,'' he said. ``We stocked
up and had plenty of food. Everybody is inconvenienced a little
bit, but considering the scope of the disaster, we're in pretty
good shape.''

   Congress will review the Navy's investigation
into the explosion aboard the USS Iowa in light of reports of
improper experiments with the ship's guns, says Senate Majority
Leader George Mitchell.
   Mitchell, who appeared Sunday on ABC-TV's ``This Week With David
Brinkley,'' was asked whether he thought there was a cover-up by
the Navy, which concluded Gunner's Mate Clayton Hartwig ``most
probably'' sabotaged a 16-inch gun he was loading.
   ``I'm unable to make that judgment,'' Mitchell said, ``but based
upon the reports we've seen, there will undoubtedly be a
congressional inquiry into the matter to attempt to determine, if
possible, what did happen and how well done the investigation and
report were.''
   Hartwig and 46 mates in the ship's second turret died in the
April 19 explosion, which occurred during firing practice.
   The Senate Armed Services Committee has begun sifting through
Navy documents on the investigation and will conduct hearings on
the Navy's conduct of the investigation, said committee staff
director Arnold Punaro.

   Thousands of rural communities would lose
their only source of public transportation if Congress decides the
Dallas-based transit company must equip every bus with a wheelchair
lift, says Greyhound Lines Inc.
   Advocates for the handicapped, however, say Greyhound is
exaggerating the costs of compliance with the Americans with
Disabilities Act to shift attention away from the real issue _ that
the handicapped are largely denied access to public transportation.
   Under the Senate-approved legislation, Greyhound, the only
national intercity bus company, would have six years from enactment
to make its buses accessible to the handicapped, including those in
wheelchairs.
   Greyhound interprets that as a mandate for a lift in every bus,
although the legislation is not that specific.
   Hearings are under way in the House on a version of the bill,
which could pass before the end of the year.
   Greyhound estimates the minimal annual costs of compliance at
$30 million to $40 million _ a ``bullet to the heart'' of a company
that lost $17 million last year and expects to make $5 million to
$10 million this year, says Fred G. Currey, chairman and chief
executive officer.
   But Ellen Daly, a legislative analyst with the President's
Committee on Employment of People With Disabilities, said that when
transit companies are asked to accommodate the disabled, ``there
has always been an inflation on costs.''

<NOTE>Drug Crimes More Likely to Mean Jail, State Figures Show</NOTE>

   Incarcerations for convicted drug offenders
more than doubled in five states between 1983 and 1986, the Justice
Department says.
   The 104 percent increase in prison or jail sentences caused the
overall number of incarcerations to increase 28 percent, said a
study released Sunday.
   The department's Bureau of Justice Statistics looked at arrests,
prosecutions and convictions in California, Minnesota, New York,
Pennsylvania and Virginia. The proportion of convicted defendants
imprisoned or jailed increased for each category of offense:
violent crimes, property crimes, drug crimes and public-order
crimes.
   According to the report, 62 percent of the 1.9 million people
arrested during that period were convicted. Thirty-nine percent of
the people arrested went on to jail or prison.
   Of those convicted, 67 percent went on to state or local jails,
15 percent were fined, and 18 percent received probation.
   An arrest was not recorded for purposes of the study until the
case was disposed of with either a verdict or a decision not to
prosecute.
   Arrests for drug offenses increased 52 percent, prosecutions
rose 61 percent and convictions for those crimes went up 71 percent
during the four-year period, said the report from the bureau's
Offender Based Transaction Statistics Program.

   The case of a psychologist charged with helping
to hide a 5-year-old from a mother who allegedly neglected the boy
is raising ethical questions for professionals who treat abused
children, experts say.
   Dennis M. Harrison, who has testified in prominent child custody
cases across the nation, was charged Sept. 18 with three counts of
conspiracy to harbor or hide Travis Lee Meriweather of Lexington
Park.
   Travis has been missing since a July 1987 visit to his father in
Hinton, Okla. Authorities believe he's being held by his father
somewhere.
   Harrison, the boy's grandfather, and a physician who has
examined him, claim the father was justified in vanishing with
Travis because he was virtually starved while in the care of his
mother.
   Some child abuse specialists say they are troubled by the
government's seizing of evidence _ handwritten notes and a
telephone bill for a call to Hinton _ from Harrison's office and
home.
   The records seizure and Harrison's arrest could have a
``chilling effect'' on medical professionals who treat abused
children, said Dr. Eli Newberger, director of the Family
Development Study at Children's Hospital and an assistant professor
of pediatrics at Harvard Medical School.
   ``To have confidential knowledge about a client seized by the
state threatens the entire therapeutic enterprise,'' said Jon
Conte, an associate professor of social work at the University of
Chicago.
   Harrison called his arrest an ``outrage.''
   ``This sends an ominous message to health professionals who try
to help troubled kids from broken homes that they are standing on
shaky, shaky legal ground,'' said Harrison, who is free on his
recognizance and faces trial Feb. 7.
   But D. Anne Emery, a St. Mary's County prosecutor, said she has
evidence that Harrison saw Travis at least twice knowing that state
and federal warrants had been issued for the boy and his father.
   ``This is a situation where somebody who doesn't like the
outcome of the court order just takes the law into their own hands
and does whatever he wants. It makes the very foundation of our
legal system ineffective,'' she said.
   The boy's grandfather, Leroy Meriweather of Hinton, Okla., said
Travis had grown increasingly thin while living with his mother,
Terry Treadway, 27.
   ``The baby had a bloated belly like those starving babies you
see on television in India and his hair was just falling out of his
head when it was brushed,'' he said.
   Treadway won custody when she divorced her husband, Michael Lee
Meriweather in Oklahoma in 1985. She moved to Maryland and agreed
to let Travis spend a week each month with his father.
   ``We've done just about everything we can do to find him and I'm
all torn up inside,'' she said in an interview.
   Dr. Donna Cosby, an Oklahoma City pediatrician who examined
Travis in 1986 and 1987, said he appeared to be underweight.
   ``He would systematically lose up to a half a pound every time
he visited his mother, and gain it back when he was with his dad.
Calories at that age are crucial to brain development, and kids
just can't afford to have their weight bounce back and forth like
that,'' she said.
   Treadway said Travis was perfectly healthy in her care.
   ``Kids are kids and some of them don't have the figures that
adults might expect them to have,'' she said.
   Harrison, 43, has testified on behalf of Dr. Elizabeth Morgan, a
Washington, D.C., plastic surgeon who has been in jail for hiding
her 7-year-old daughter, Hilary, from the courts since 1987. Morgan
has alleged that the child's father, Dr. Eric Foretich, sexually
abused the child, a claim Foretich denies.

   Fire broke out on a Danish passenger
liner in the North Sea early Monday and the blaze was reportedly
being brought under control without the need for evacuation,
Swedish radio said.
   There was no immediate word on injuries.
   The liner, ``Tor Scandinavia'', was on its way from Goteborg on
the Swedish west coast to Harwich on the British east coast when it
sent distress signals at 5 a.m., the radio said.
   A West German vessel answering the call said the liner, which
carries an estimated 540 passengers, had started in the fore of the
liner, knocking out its radio, and was being brought under control,
the radio reported.
   The West German ship, ``Poseidon'', also was quoted as saying
that evacuation of the passengers was deemed unnecessary.
   The ship, which is owned by the Danish shipping line DFDS,
reported its position was 80 miles west of the city Esbjerg on the
Danish west coast.

<HEAD>Washington Has Record Apple Crop; Growers Worry About Price Crunch</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By NICHOLAS K. GERANIOS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>YAKIMA, Wash. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   In this region where apple trees line the
golf courses and an apple is the city symbol, growers are worried
that depressed prices threaten their economic survival.
   With supplies expected to be lower elsewhere, growers here hoped
the 10.7 billion apples hanging from trees in the verdant valleys
of central Washington would get top prices this fall as the
industry recovers from the Alar scare.
   Instead, wholesale prices have declined since Sept. 1.
   ``It's terribly disappointing and does not bode well for the
industry,'' said grower Chuck Peters.
   According to the government's Market News Service, the top grade
of Washington Red Delicious apples was selling for $12 to $14 per
42-pound box on Sept. 18, down from around $20 per box in early
September.
   Last year, the same grade sold for $26 to $28 per box.
   ``We have yet to get our crop off the trees and the price is
beaten down to a price level equivalent to the worst times of
Alar,'' complained grower Jim Clements of Selah.
   He referred to widespread consumer concern over growers' use of
the chemical Alar after a private health group publicized studies
linking Alar byproducts with cancer.
   Some think rising supply is the reason for the low wholesale
prices.
   Washington is sending a record number of apples to supermarkets
this year, boosting the size of the national apple crop by 7
percent over last year.
   Because most apples are bought on long-term contracts, wholesale
price changes take time to show up in markets.
   ``We would expect lower consumer prices than last year,'' said
Kathy Means, spokeswoman for the Produce Marketing Association, a
fresh produce trade group based in Newark, Del.
   The industry is trying to bury the Alar issue, and little, if
any, of the chemical was used on the 1989 crop.
   Uniroyal Chemical Co. removed the chemical from the market
earlier this year as the U.S. Food and Drug Administration moved to
examine the issue.
   Washington state instituted a program requiring farmers to apply
for special permits to use Alar, a growth regulator.
   None did, and an extensive state testing program so far has
found Alar only in traces that indicate carry-over from previous
years' spraying.
   The industry was heartened by record consumer demand for apples
all summer, and the Washington Apple Commission has said its
polling shows Alar is not a major issue.
   ``There is a lot of reason for optimism,'' said Charles St.
John, commission spokesman.
   Washington normally produces about half the nation's supermarket
apples, but weather problems in the Midwest and New England should
boost the state's share this season.
   Apples are a big business in Washington, where 4,500 growers
produce a crop worth $800 million per year. That doesn't include
hundreds of millions of dollars in additional sales by apple juice
and apple sauce makers based in the state.
   The national crop forecast calls for 230 million boxes, 7
percent above last year, with 132 million boxes destined for
supermarkets and the rest for processors. Of that, Washington will
produce about 107 million boxes, of which a record 75 million are
for supermarkets.
   They will be purchased by consumers who eat an average of 20
pounds of apples per year.
   New York and Michigan are the second-largest apple producers,
each with 7 percent of the crop.
   Many Washington growers are counting on the 1989 crop to save
them after two consecutive years of poor crops.
   Dwight Holloway, a grower from Wapato, said he lost $500,000 in
1987, a crop that was damaged by weather, and $200,000 last year.
   It costs growers about $9.50 to grow, pick, pack and ship a box
of apples.
   ``If we have another 1987-1988, an awful large percentage of us
have to fold up and walk away,'' Holloway said.

   Military and civilian
cargo planes loaded with relief supplies arrived in St. Croix as a
delegation from Washington surveyed damage a week after Hurricane
Hugo devastated the island.
   Food kits, small tractors and medical supplies were unloaded
Sunday at the wrecked airport by military police, who arrived on
the island Thursday to restore order after three days of looting.
   ``What we need here is a Santa Claus. We'd be happy with
anything we can get,'' said Jose Luis Perez, who, with his wife and
two children was camping in his roofless, debris-littered home.
   Perez said he was recovering zinc sheeting and debris in the
street to rebuild his house.
   The Air Force transport that brought Interior Secretary Manuel
Lujan and seven congressmen carried a shipment of chainsaws, which
soldiers unloaded onto an Army truck while Navy, Coast Guard and
Army helicopters buzzed overhead.
   ``Everybody's pouring in stuff like it's the Berlin airlift,''
said Ron DeLugo, the Virgin Islands' non-voting representative to
Congress.
   Gov. Alexander Farrelly, who accompanied the delegation on a
quick tour of St Croix, estimated damage at $500 million. DeLugo
said it could run as high as $1 billion.
   Hurricane Hugo seriously damaged or destroyed 90 percent of the
island's homes. The storm knocked out all phone, power and water
services and was followed by widespread looting that cleaned out
most stores not protected by armed guards.
   Officials say the storm caused at least 27 deaths and billions
of dollars in damage as it surged over several islands from
Guadeloupe to Puerto Rico last week before hitting the Carolinas.
   The 1,341 troops sent to help Virgin Islands police prevent
looting and restore order arrived days after most businesses on St.
Croix were already looted.
   Relief supplies arriving at the airport were loaded onto trucks
and sent to distribution points around the island, though by Sunday
it appeared they were not yet being distributed to the public.
   A DC-7 from a clothing company unloaded a shipment of boxed
food. On Saturday, an oil company flew in 75,000 individual meals
for the island's 55,000 people.
   Radio stations announced where to find water, gasoline and
medical attention. Lujan said he expected water to be running by
today.
   Dozens of people, some with broken limbs, others waiting for
routine treatment, crowded into a clinic near Christiansted, where
doctors said they lacked everything: water, medicine, sheets and
food.
   ``All the doctors are doing a little bit of everything, working
outside of their specialization,'' said Dr. James Davenport, a
radiologist.
   The Army was setting up a mobile surgical hospital outside
Christiansted.
   Mail service was re-established to the island Saturday, said
Pete Wade, postal inspector in charge of U.S. possessions in the
Caribbean.
   Before visiting St. Croix, the Washington delegation surveyed
hurricane damage in neighboring Puerto Rico Saturday. They returned
to the U.S. capital Sunday afternoon.
   The other members of Congress on the delegation were reps.
George Miller, D-Cal., Beverly Byron, D-Md. Erl F.H. Faleomavaegu,
D-American Samoa, Charles Rangel, D-N.Y., Frank Guarini, D-N.J.,
and Jaime Fuster, Puerto Rico's non-voting representative.
   The Virgin Islands is a non-incorporated U.S. territory of
110,000 people.

   The dollar plunged against the Japanese yen on
Monday while the main index on the Tokyo Stock Exchange rose to its
highest in a month.
   The dollar closed at 142.95 yen, down 2.05 yen from Friday's
close of 145.00 yen. After opening moderately lower at 144.47 yen,
the currency ranged between 142.20-144.50 yen. It was the lowest
closing for the U.S. currency against the yen since Aug. 30 when it
closed at 142.86 yen.
   On the stock exchange, the Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected
issues, which gained 26.27 points Friday, added 188.92 points, 0.54
percent, closing at 34,960.71.
   It was the Nikkei's highest close since Aug. 22 when it closed
at 35,114.35
   Currency dealers said the dollar was pushed back by a joint
dollar-selling intervention during morning Tokyo trading by the
Bank of Japan and the Federal Reserve Bank of New York.
   ``It seems that the (joint intervention) shows that monetary
authorities are carrying out what they were saying in the
statements'' issued by the weekend meeting of the Group of Seven
industrialized countries in Washington, said a source close to the
Bank of Japan, the nation's central bank, speaking on condition of
anonymity.
   The Bank of Japan alone was reported to have sold an estimated
$1 billion in the U.S. currency to press it down. The amount of
intervention by the U.S. central bank was not immediately known.
   The Bank of Japan ordinarily does not comment on its market
policy.
   Finance ministers participating in the G-7 meeting said in a
statement said the recent rise of the dollar ``could adversely
affect prospects for the world economy'' and agreed to cooperate in
foreign exchange markets to check the dollar's strength.
   The G-7 comprises Japan, the United States, West Germany,
Britain, France, Italy and Canada.
   Osamu Seto, a dealer with Mitsui Bank, said the joint market
intervention in the Tokyo market worked well to help the dollar
down, but he said the G-7 pledge for close cooperation in exchange
markets was not enough to stem the dollar's upward pressure.
   ``In the long-term perspective, the dollar's underlying
bullishness will not be erased by means of market intervention,''
currently the only way to curb the exchange rates, Seto said.
   Securities dealers said the market responded favorably to the
yen's appreciation against the dollar. Shares were bought broadly
in small lots, they said.

<HEAD>Ortega Predicts Sandinista Election Victory, Defeat For The United

<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MANAGUA, Nicaragua (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Nominated by acclamation to run for
re-election, President Daniel Ortega predicted that he would win in
another defeat for Washington, supplier of the Contra rebels who
fought his leftist government.
   ``We will win,'' Ortega told a cheering convention of the ruling
leftist Sandinista National Liberation Front that nominated him and
running mate Sergio Ramirez on Sunday night.
   Ortega, 44, who led the Sandinistas to power with the 1979
overthrow of dictator Anastasio Somoza, had been expected to win
the nomination.
   A Sandinista electoral victory next year, Ortega said in an
acceptance speech, will be ``one more defeat the United States is
going to have to accept. They will have to reach an understanding
with Nicaragua after the defeat they are going to suffer. They have
no other choice.''
   The United States has been helping the Contras _ short for
counterrevolutionaries _ since 1981. For the past year, such
assistance has been limited to non-lethal aid, greatly reducing
their effectiveness as a fighting force.
   Except for a brief visit to Managua by a State Department
official two weeks ago, the United States has refused any high
level contact with the Sandinistas to discuss pending issues since
it broke off talks five years ago.
   At a meeting last month, Ortega and the presidents of El
Salvador, Honduras, Guatemala and Costa Rica formally agreed to
disband the Contras by Dec. 8 as part of an overall plan to end
conflicts in Central America.
   In exchange, Ortega moved national elections originally
scheduled for 1991 to Feb. 25 and promised that opposition
candidates will be allowed to campaign free of harassment, with a
free press _ and that the balloting will be honest.
   Both the Bush administration and rebel leaders, however, say
they want to maintain the Contra force intact until after the
election to make sure the Sandinistas keep their promise.
   Ortega's challenger will be Violeta Barrios de Chamorro,
publisher of La Prensa, Nicaragua's only opposition newspaper. She
is being fielded by a 14-party coalition, which the United States
has been considering how to aid.
   The convention, representing a wide spectrum of society, also
chose 90 candidates for the National Assembly _ the single-chamber
legislature _ and mayors for the nation's 145 cities and towns.
   An economic boycott, together with the Contra war and government
mismanagement have completely stagnated Nicaragua's economy, now
one of the poorest in Latin America.

<HEAD>Bodies Arrive In Paris; Probe Focuses On Bomb In Front Cargo Hold</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CHARLES CAMPBELL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Bodies of victims from the bombing of a French
DC-10 over Niger have arrived in the French capital, and
investigators said the bomb was likely planted in the jet's forward
cargo hold.
   ``Very probable traces of an explosion were in fact concentrated
in one of the cargo compartments, situated at the front of the
plane,'' said Robert Paillasse, head of an investigative commission
from France, Niger and Chad.
   ``It is certain that there was an explosive substance,'' he said
Sunday in an interview with French radio RTL from Niger.
   All 171 people aboard UTA Flight 772 were killed when it
exploded 30,000 feet over south-central Niger in northwest Africa
on Tuesday. The flight was en route from the Congo to Paris after a
stopover in N'Djamena, Chad.
   About 40 bodies arrived at Le Bourget airport Sunday aboard a
DC-8 cargo plane and were taken immediately to the Paris morgue for
identification and autopsy, the Foreign Ministry said in a
statement.
   Autopsies should indicate whether the passengers and crew
inhaled gases that would provide clues about what explosive blew
the plane apart less than an hour after its takeoff from N'Djamena.
   Paillase also said laboratory tests had begun on debris shipped
to Paris ``to determine, on the basis of the traces of combustion,
which explosive material was involved.''
   The Transport Ministry said Saturday that evidence from the
crash site and analysis of the flight data and cockpit voice
recorders left no doubt that an explosion caused the disaster.
   Authorities have been unwilling to speculate about who might
have placed a bomb aboard the flight, but appear to be treating
with great skepticism the claims of responsibility issued so far.
   A previously unknown group calling itself the Secret Chadian
Resistance sent statements to Western news agencies in Beirut on
Saturday claiming to have bombed the flight as part of a struggle
for ``the complete withdrawal of all military colonial forces from
Africa.''
   France maintains about 1,600 soldiers in Chad, deployed to help
the former French colony in its long war with Libya. Although Chad
and Libya have promised to end their dispute peacefully, Libya has
continued to call for withdrawal of all French troops from the
country.
   Calls to UTA several hours after the plane was bombed and to a
Western news agency in London the following day claimed
responsibility on behalf of Islamic Jihad.
   Islamic Jihad is one of the names used by Shiite Moslem
extremists believed holding several Western hostages in Lebanon.
But that group customarily makes its statements in writing,
accompanied by photographs of its hostages to prove their
authenticity.
   French news reports have underscored the similarity between the
UTA crash and the December bombing of a Pan Am flight over
Lockerbie, Scotland.
   In the Pan Am bombing, one prominent theory is that the Popular
Front for the Liberation of Palestine-General Command, a
Palestinian splinter group, placed a sophisticated bomb in a
radio-cassette player checked as baggage in Frankfurt, designed to
explode following a stopover in London.
   The French news accounts have speculated that a similar bomb
could have been placed in the baggage compartment of the UTA flight
in Brazzaville, Congo, designed to explode only after the plane
stopped in N'Djamena and took off again.

<HEAD>Dollar Down In Tokyo, Stocks Soar</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The dollar, pushed by the Japanese and American
central banks, plunged more than two yen against the Japanese yen
today, while the Tokyo Stock Exchange's leading index climbed to
its highest level in a month.
   The dollar's decline followed a weekend meeting at which the
monetary authorities of seven major industrial nations agreed to
act to check the U.S. currency's recent rise.
   The dollar closed at 142.95 yen, down 2.05 yen from Friday's
close of 145.00 yen. It opened at 144.47 yen and ranged between
142.20 yen and 144.50 yen. The dollar's close was its lowest since
142.35 yen on Aug. 23.
   Currency dealers said both the Bank of Japan and the U.S.
Federal Reserve Bank had been heavily selling dollars.
   ``It seems that the (joint intervention) shows that monetary
authorities are carrying out what they said in the statements''
issued at the weekend meeting in Washington, said a source close to
the Bank of Japan, the nation's central bank, speaking on condition
of anonymity.
   The Bank of Japan alone was estimated to have sold $1 billion in
heavy trading that amounted to $13.319 billion, currency dealers
said. The amount of intervention by the U.S. central bank was not
immediately known.
   The Bank of Japan ordinarily does not comment on its activities
in the exchange market.
   Finance ministers at the Washington meeting said in a statement
that the recent rise of the dollar ``could adversely affect
prospects for the world economy,'' and agreed to cooperate in
foreign exchange markets to curb the dollar's strength.
   The ministers were from the ``Group of Seven'' _ Japan, the
United States, West Germany, Britain, France, Italy and Canada.
   On the stock market, the long-awaited strengthening of the yen
encouraged investors to buy shares. The Nikkei Stock Average of 225
selected issues, the exchange's main index, rose 188.92 points, or
0.54 percent, closing at 34,960.71. It was the Nikkei's highest
close since 35,114.35 on Aug. 22.
   Securities dealers said shares were bought broadly in small lots.
   ``The market was waiting for an opportunity to turn bullish and
it seems as though the dollar's sudden weakening became a very good
one,'' said a dealer at a major brokerage, speaking on condition of
anonymity.
   But some dealers said institutional investors have not yet fully
joined in the buying despite the generally bullish market sentiment.

<HEAD>After Only Store Is Destroyed, Residents Face Long Trek For Food</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DELL CITY, Texas (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Fire destroyed the only grocery store in
this small West Texas farming community, forcing residents to
travel 120 miles to buy food.
   ``As far as the city is concerned, it's the worst thing that
could have burned,'' city secretary Juanita Collier said several
hours after she watched flames devour the two-story Dell City
Mercantile on Sunday.
   ``There's not one other place to buy a loaf of bread, a Coke or
anything. It's a 124-mile round trip to Sierra Blanca for the next
nearest place.''
   The store located at the base of the Guadalupe Mountains, about
90 minutes east of El Paso, not only served the 350 residents of
Dell City. It also served people from farms and ranches up to 50
miles away.
   Dell City Fire Chief Jack Wendt said investigators still do not
know what caused the blaze, but there was nothing suspicious about
the blaze.
   Besides losing the source of its groceries, the community also
will be without one of its more popular social spots. The store was
a place where people frequently came to sit on outside windowsills
and chat.
   ``I operate the Campfire Cafe, and the grocery furnished us with
buns, meat and milk,'' said Linda Mott. That means I have to go to
El Paso for supplies.''
   Store owners Lorenzo and Bertha Gallegos were in El Paso for a
family gathering at the time of the fire, Collier and Mott said.
They could not be reached for comment Sunday.
   ``There's people who have no cars and have to shop here. I don't
know what they're going to do,'' Collier said.

   A huge welcome back ceremony for the
crew that crash-landed a crippled United DC-10 here two months ago
left the pilot with a bittersweet feeling.
   Although 184 survived the July 19 crash of United Airlines
Flight 232, 112 died. Capt. Al Haynes has been hesitant to accept
praise for his skillful landing of the plane, whose hydraulic
system had been ruined by a midair mechanical failure.
   On Sunday, about 40,000 people jammed Sioux Gateway Airport for
an air show and ceremony to honor Haynes, his crew and those on the
ground who helped survivors.
   ``It was a little mixed emotions for about five minutes as I
wondered how I was going to react,'' Haynes said after the event.
``It only lasted for a couple of minutes and then I knew I was
going to be all right. ...
   ``We're kind of overwhelmed by it,'' he added. ``We didn't
expect this kind of attention. They are unbelievable. They are just
great.''
   Crew members Dudley Dvorak and William Record, along with United
training pilot Dennis Fitch also were on hand, with two of the men
still wearing casts from the fiery crash.
   Along with Haynes they have been credited with an extraordinary
achievement in guiding the airliner to land after its No. 2 engine
blew apart, severing hydraulic lines that controlled the aircraft's
flight.
   With no procedure for such a circumstance, the crew had to
improvise a response.
   Haynes said he spent much of the day touring hospitals to thank
doctors and nurses.
   ``We got reacquainted with them and they could kind of see that
their work did some good because people are back together,'' said
Haynes.
   Haynes has been on medical leave since the crash, but said he
hopes to return to the air Nov. 1.
   Gov. Terry Branstad presented the crew with citations and small
plaques, and said Iowa National Guard officials and workers were
responsible for the swift and effective response.
   ``Your calm action saved lives and helped people cope with a
dire emergency,'' Branstad said. ``You are a special group of
people.''

<TEXT>
   The marina that serves this resort
island for all practical purposes doesn't exist: It was blown 300
yards away by Hurricane Hugo.
   A pile of at least two dozen yachts and sailboats, some worth
$200,000 or more, are crammed like sardines onto neighboring Goat
Island.
   Bill Finch, harbormaster at what's left of Wild Dunes Marina on
the Isle of Palms, said Sunday he doesn't know how things will get
rebuilt.
   ``It's a mess,'' Finch said. ``We're going to try to figure out
how to get those boats out of there. It's going to take a while.''
   Throughout the Charleston area, pleasure boats, yachts and
fishing craft are scattered like toys kicked about by an angry
child. Some marinas broke completely loose from their pilings under
Hugo's 135 mph winds, sending docks and boats spinning in all
directions.
   Isle of Palms remained under martial law Sunday, with
rifle-toting National Guardsmen keeping homeowners and the curious
away. The Coast Guard even resricted boat traffic in the
Intracoastal Waterway that leads to the island,
   Some residents were being allowed back today, but just long
enough to take stock of the damage.
   In Charleston itself, a 45-foot sailboat sat Sunday in the
middle of normally busy Lockwood Drive. Several yachts lay across
the road in the front yard of a condominium complex, while others
were lodged under the Ashley River Bridge.
   ``There's a lot of people who lost thousands of dollars in
boats,'' said Christopher ``Shorty'' Blake, manager of the Lockwood
Marina. ``It's the worst I've ever seen.''
   Petty Officer James Turner said the Coast Guard was searching
for at least 30 missing boats _ but many more reports were expected
as people gain access to docks.
   ``We don't really know how many are missing and from where,''
Turner said.
   North of Charleston, along the Intracoastal Waterway, the
fishing village of McClellanville, population about 500, appeared
devasted by the hurricane that swept ashore late Thursday. Phone
service was cut off, and Mayor Leland Rutledge said community's
shrimping industry was wiped out.
   ``I don't think anyone was prepared for this,'' said Priscilla
Baldwin, who with her husband, Robert, toured McClellanville during
the weekend. Their shrimp boat was washed ashore, along with
several others.
   ``I don't know how many can recover. A lot of people will be
going back to work but not us,'' she said.
   Bobby Singletary, captain of the Charleston Princess, a 75-foot
tour boat, said dozens of boats and shrimp trawlers were lost in
the Cooper River east of Charleston.
   ``They're up in the trees, in the grass. Some of them are sunk.''

<HEAD>Rain Continues in South After Storm Floods Jacksonville, Fla.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Torrential rains that turned streets into rivers in
Jacksonville, Fla., continued to drench parts of the South today,
and a cold weather system spread from the Great Lakes area toward
New England.
   A dome of high pressure over the central and eastern United
States brought clear skies to much of the nation.
   Thunderstorms on Sunday spun off at least one tornado and pelted
parts of Georgia, Alabama, South Carolina and Florida, where
Jacksonville got 11.4 inches of rain the day. Water ran up to 10
feet deep in the streets.
   Other heavy rainfall areas in Florida included Lake Shore, 8.9
inches; Sandalwood, 6.12 inches, and Apalachicola, 5.19 inches.
   A tornado damaged trees near Lehigh Acres, Fla., according to
the National Weather Service.
   More downpours were forecast for today, and rain was falling in
Atlanta and Macon, Ga.
   Cold air that brought record low temperatures from the Great
Plains to the central Appalachians was shifting east today toward
New York state and New England.
   Temperatures Sunday evening were in the 40s and 50s from the
Great Lakes region across the Appalachians to the Atlantic Coast,
the 80s across the Plains states, southern Florida, south Texas and
in the Pacific Northwest and northern California. Temperatures
climbed to between 90 and 110 degrees in the desert Southwest and
the interior valleys of California.

   Gasoline prices rose nearly a third of a cent
during the past two weeks, a survey found.
   The average national price of gasoline rose 0.31 cents, to
$1.0943 a gallon for the week ended Sept. 22, according to the
Lundberg Survey.
   A competitive end-of-summer market forced retailers to hold
prices down even though wholesale prices were increasing, said
Trilby Lundberg, director of the biweekly survey of 12,000 stations.
   But during the past two weeks, the wholesale rises have been
great enough to force retailers to increase pump prices, she said
Sunday. She forecast the trend would continue into the fall, ``but
its difficult to do during a time of decreased demand.''
   Average nationwide prices per gallon at self-service pumps,
which account for more than 80 percent of all sales, were: 98.25
cents for regular unleaded; $1.1531 for premium unleaded; and 97.22
cents for regular leaded.
   For full-service, the averages were $1.2721 for regular
unleaded, $1.3967 for premium unleaded and $1.2619 for regular
leaded.

<TEXT>
   A small earthquake jostled this coastal
city and was followed by at least two lesser aftershocks, prompting
worried calls to emergency agencies but no reports of injuries or
property damage.
   The first quake registered 2.8 on the Richter scale when it
struck at 9:59 p.m. Sunday nine miles southeast of here, said Hall
Daly, a spokesman for the seismology lab at the California
Institute of Technology in Pasadena.
   An aftershock measuring 2.7 struck at 10:30 p.m. and one that
registered 1.9 followed at 11:15 p.m., Daly said.
   Both aftershocks were centered in the same area as the first
quake, he said.
   The Vetura County Sheriff's Department and Ventura City Police
Department received several calls from rattled residents.
   The Richter scale is a measure of ground motion as recorded on
seismographs. Every increase of one number means a tenfold increase
in magnitude.
   An earthquake of 3.5 on the Richter scale can cause slight
damage in the local area, 4 moderate damage. A 7 reading is capable
of widespread heavy damage.

<HEAD>Syria Violates Cease-Fire As 1 Million Beirutis Return</HEAD>

<DATELINE>BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Syrian artillery fired 80 shells into
pine woods in the country's Christian enclave today, violating a
2-day-old Arab League cease-fire during which more than 1 million
refugees returned to the capital.
   Police reported no casualties in the 45-minute barrage on the
thinly populated area near the mountain resort town of Beit Meri,
10 miles northeast of Beirut.
   Some of the shells exploded less than a mile from the hilltop
Bustan Hotel where Arab League mediator Lakhdar al-Ibrahimi was
staying. The sudden barrage ended at 7:45 a.m., said a police
spokesman who cannot be named under standing regulations.
   Christian forces led by Gen. Michel Aoun did not respond to the
Syrian shellfire, the spokesman reported. There were no immediate
reports of casualties.
   It was the first serious violation of the cease-fire since it
took hold Saturday evening after six months of fighting between the
Syrians and Christians that by police count has killed 929 people
and wounded 2,741.
   There was no official explanation for the barrage on the
forested mountain slopes, which appeared to have been deliberately
targeted because few people live there.
   An informed Moslem source said it was ``a Syrian message to Aoun
that the truce could fall apart if the Christian media does not
stop its campaign against the Syrians.''
   Ibrahimi, deputy Secretary-General of the 22-member Arab League,
was scheduled to preside later today over a meeting of a security
committee made up of officials of several Lebanese factions to
assess efforts to consolidate the truce.
   It was called more than a week ago by the King Fahd of Saudi
Arabia, King Hassan II of Morocco and President Chadli Bendjedid of
Algeria, who form an Arab League committee assigned to end
Lebanon's 14-year-old civil war.
   The Syrians have 40,000 troops in Lebanon. They entered the
country in 1976 under an Arab League peacekeeping mandate. But Aoun
has charged they abrogated that mandate by openly siding with the
Moslems.
   A member of the security committee, speaking on condition of
anonymity, said it will also discuss ways of ``monitoring and
blocking'' shipments of weapons and ammunition to the warring
factions.
   The committee comprises representatives of Aoun's Christian army
command, the rival pro-Syrian Moslem army command of Maj. Gen. Sami
Khatib and the three principal militias in Lebanon, the right-wing
Christian Lebanese Forces, the Shiite Moslem Amal and the Druse
Moslem Progressive Socialist Party.
   Beirut took the brunt of the savage shelling by both sides since
March 8, forcing all but 150,000 of the capital's 1.5 million
population to flee to safer areas.
   Moslem housewife Hoda Makkouk returned to her third-floor
apartment in the Bourj Abu Haidar district of Moslem west Beirut
Sunday evening with her husband and two children.
   ``I was so happy to be back home, I just couldn't sleep,'' said
Mrs. Makkouk. She and her family spent four months living with
relatives and friends in the Chouf Mountains southeast of Beirut.
   ``All the windows have been blown out by the shelling. I spent
the whole night cleaning the apartment. But I'm not tired,'' she
said.
   As Beirutis began picking up the pieces of their shattered
lives, the city's 11 daily newspapers published advertisements from
schools announcing that they will resume classes early next month.
   Educational institutes in and around Beirut closed in March
shortly after the fighting broke out.

<HEAD>Longtime Pageant Director Albert Marks</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOYCE A. VENEZIA</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>ATLANTIC CITY, N.J. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Albert A. Marks Jr., who brought the
Miss America Pageant to television, fired Bert Parks as host and
dethroned Vanessa Williams because of nude photos, has died at age
76.
   Marks, who directed the pageant for 35 years before his
retirement in 1987, died Sunday of complications from a heart
attack he suffered Sept. 11, a few days before this year's finals.
   Marks, and investment broker, worked tirelessly and without pay
on the contest, at first to boost his city's image and then out of
love of the pageant, said his successor, Leonard C. Horn.
   ``He not only helped make a major contribution to Atlantic City,
but gave an opportunity for thousands of young women across the
country to receive scholarship assistance,'' Horn said.
   Though officially retired from the pageant, Marks offered advice
this year.
   The day before his heart attack, he visited pageant staff and
contestants and posed for photos with some of them, including Miss
America 1971 Phyllis George, a co-host of this year's show.
   Affable to most but acerbic to those he perceived a threat to
the show, Marks tightly held the reigns in a sometimes bumpy road
to the runway.
   ``He had a capacity for making quick decisions and never looking
back,'' said Horn, who knew Marks for 25 years.
   Marks joined the pageant as an unpaid volunteer in 1952. His job
that year was to escort Marilyn Monroe to and from a float she rode
in the contest's annual Boardwalk parade.
   `She wasn't able to get onto the float because of her tight
dress,'' he recalled last year, ``so I had to give her a push by
the derriere to get her up.''
   Marks went on to serve as director for 35 years, the last 25 as
chairman.
   Marks brought the show to television in 1954.
   He defended the pageant against criticism from the women's
liberation movement, the National Association for the Advancement
of Colored People, labor organizations and some who consider Miss
America an outdated symbol.
   In the late 1960s, he suggested scuttling the swimsuit
competition for sports clothes. But he abandoned the proposal in
the face of objections from state pageant committees.
   In January 1980, Marks decided against renewing Parks' contract.
   Marks said he sent a letter to Parks' home in Hollywood, Fla.,
to notify him. But Parks was staying at his home in Connecticut for
the holidays and didn't find out he was fired until until he was
questioned an Associated Press reporter.
   Parks didn't immediately return a call Sunday, but his wife,
Annette, said she and her husband ``felt a terrible loss'' with
Marks' death.
   In 1982, Marks dropped the trademark ``There She Is'' song in a
dispute with songwriter Bernie Wayne. He allowed the song's return
in 1985.
   The biggest scandal was in 1984, when a magazine published nude
photographs of Miss America, Vanessa Williams.
   Miss Williams, the first black to win the rhinestone-studded
crown, also became the first to be forced into giving it up. Miss
New Jersey 1984, Suzette Charles, served the rest of Miss Williams'
reign.
   Mary Ann Mobley, Miss America 1959 and wife of Parks' successor,
Gary Collins, remembered Marks this way: ``He weathered all the
controversy that came up and the Miss America Pageant got
stronger,'' she said. ``That's the mark of the man.''

   Mayoral candidate David Dinkins was shaken up in
an auto accident.
   ``Basically it was a bump on the head,'' said Stanley Davis, the
Manhattan borough president's deputy press secretary.
   The car Dinkins was riding in to a campaign appearance was hit
broadside Sunday afternoon in Manhattan, police said.
   The Democratic nominee was taken to Metropolitan Hospital, where
he was treated and released.
   ``When I got out, I had a headache. I had a pretty good-sized
headache, and I was slightly dizzy, but that soon passed,'' Dinkins
said while leaving the hospital. ``Even now I have a headache, but
I feel fine. I could play four hours of tennis as I did yesterday.''
   Also released after treatment were the driver of Dinkins' car,
the driver of the other car and a passenger in the other car, said
Sgt. Raymond O'Donnell, a police spokesman.
   O'Donnell said charges were unlikely.

   A baby sitter and the 19-month-old girl she was
watching were slain, and police said someone who knew the woman was
responsible.
   The body of Juana Guzman, 41, was found by a neighbor Sunday in
a stairwell of the apartment building in the Bronx, where she
lived. Guzman had been severely beaten.
   The body of the toddler, Carmen Santana, was found more than
three hours later in a plastic bag in a garbage pail behind the
building, police spokesman Sgt. Peter Sweeney said. Newspapers
reported the infant's throat had been slashed.
   Both bodies were left in areas that had been searched the day
before after Guzman's son discovered her missing and the child's
mother filed a missing person report.
   Police believe someone who knew the victims was responsible for
the killings, possibly someone living in the clean five-story
building near Yankee Stadium where they died.
   Carmen had been left with Guzman on Friday by her mother, Cruz
Santana, 30, who lived in another apartment in the building,
Sweeney said.
   The baby sitter's son, Henry Guzman, 15, discovered his mother
missing Saturday morning when he arrived home and found the
television and lights on and toys scattered.

   PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti (AP) _ The military government announced
it will transfer power to a civilian president in 1990 elections,
the first vote since balloting last year that was widely regarded
as fraudulent.
   Haiti will also hold local and legislative elections, the
government of Lt. Gen. Prosper Avril said in a communique read
Sunday over state radio.
   ``All dispositions have been taken to guarantee security and
ensure a peaceful transition of power,'' the communique said.
   On Jan. 17, 1988, civilian Leslie Manigat was elected in
balloting thought to have been rigged by the army. Manigat was
ousted in a military coup five months later.
   The presidential elections will be held in two rounds on Oct. 17
and Nov. 11, 1990, the government said.
   The first round will be among a field of about 10 candidates,
and the second will be a runoff among the top vote-getters, the
communique said.
   It did not say how many candidates would be allowed into the
second round, nor did it say whether international observers would
be allowed to monitor the balloting.
   On Nov. 29, 1987, Haiti tried to hold the first free general
elections since the country gained independence from France in
1804, but 34 voters were shot and hacked to death at the polls by
thugs in collusion with the army.
   The balloting was canceled.
   The U.S. government has said Haiti must transfer power to a
civilian government before Washington will fully restore the $60
million in foreign aid suspended after the 1987 election massacre.
   Avril has said repeatedly that he heads a transition government
and will relinquish power. Under Haiti's constitution, no member of
the military can run for president within a year of resigning and
if he plans to seek office Avril must resign before Oct. 17.
   Avril became president on Sept. 17, 1988 in a coup against Lt.
Gen. Henri Namphy by noncommissioned officers who demanded an end
to state-sponsored violence. He was formerly associated with the
30-year Duvalier dictatorship,
   The government announced the election after receiving the
recommendations of an independent electoral council on Saturday.
The nine-member council was set up in April to organize and oversee
the balloting.
   The communique said the electoral council will set up its
central, district, municipal, and local offices between now and the
end of the year and will register voters from January to March.
   There are an estimated 3 million eligible voters, and the
council will have to set up about 6,000 voting places.

   A block party organized by neighbors fed up
with drug dealers ended in a gun battle between gang members and
soldiers from a nearby Army base, some of whom were called in as
reinforcements.
   No one was hurt in the fight Saturday night, although it lasted
30 minutes and involved about 20 shooters. About 300 rounds of
ammunition were fired, smashing windows and damaging parked cars,
police and witnesses said Sunday.
   Police arrested two alleged gang members on previous warrants
and confiscated several weapons from the soldiers.
   The party was given by Army Staff Sgt. Bill Foulk of the 2nd
Ranger Battalion at Fort Lewis, south of Tacoma, to rally residents
who have been trying to rid the Hilltop district neighborhood of
crack dealers, authorities said.
   Some of the soldiers from Foulk's battalion were invited to the
party as guests and bodyguards, base spokesman Capt. Martin J.
Eckert said.
   Foulk called in reinforcements after alleged gang members
attacked the party with shotguns and handguns, witnesses and police
said.
   Ten soldiers were involved in the shootout, Eckert said. Police
Sgt. Mike Miller said up to 15 Rangers may have been involved.
   Miller said 40 to 55 people were at the party when six to 10
gang members surrounded Foulk's house and began firing.
   Gang members ``were throwing things at the house, they started
threatening the people over here with burning the house down and,
`We're going to fire up after dark' and this kind of thing,'' Foulk
said.
   ``That's when I decided to call back to the battalion and get a
hold of any available Ranger that I could and ask him to come out
and provide reinforcements,'' said Foulk.
   Eckert said Fort Lewis officials will wait for a full police
report before determining if any action should be taken against the
Rangers. The weapons used by the soldiers were their personal arms,
he said.
   Police said two semiautomatic rifles, a shotgun, eight automatic
handguns and a revolver were recovered from the soldiers.
   Some residents complained that tensions had been building all
afternoon and said it took police 30 minutes to arrive after they
were called.
   Police spokesman Mark Mann said he was frustrated that residents
had not called earlier.
   ``There is a fine line between self-defense and vigilantism.
Right now, we made no arrests because we think it's classified as
self-defense, but that's subject to a prosecutor's review,'' Mann
said.
   Renae Hartlett accused the soldiers of provoking violence by
making a show of force in the neighborhood and accusing some
residents of involvement in drugs.
   ``They was pointing those guns at us and saying they were going
to move us out of the neighborhood,'' she said. Hartlett and other
black residents of the integrated neighborhood said they saw racist
overtones to the confrontation.
   Foulk, who is white, said some Rangers were carrying handguns
but denied that were brandished before the gunbattle.
   ``This had nothing to do with (race),'' added Shirley Luckett, a
black woman who was at the party.

   Residents took forecasters at their word
when they warned of Hurricane Hugo's fury, and the low number of
deaths from the powerful storm can be credited to this healthy
respect, authorities said.
   The storm, which caused billions in damage, claimed 17 lives in
South Carolina, and only two were in the Charleston area, which
bore the brunt of Hugo's 135 mph winds.
   ``We just feel very thankful about that,'' said Mayor Joseph P.
Riley Jr. ``Several thousands of people who were in the shelters
and the tens of thousands of people who evacuated inland were
potential victims of injury and death.''
   Riley and other officials credited residents with monitoring the
hurricane as it spun toward Charleston, and heeding evacuation
warnings.
   The last big storm to hit South Carolina was Hurricane David in
1979, which hit the coast after pounding southern Florida.
   Since then several big storms have threatened but veered away,
and officials were worried that Charlestonians wouldn't heed Hugo's
warnings.
   ``We've had so many close calls,'' said Gary Garnet, a
meteorologist with the National Weather Service.
   ``But this storm was very, very strong,'' he said. ``This time
they realized it.''
   Glen Ellis, a Red Cross official, estimated that 18,000
residents in Charleston and the three surrounding counties headed
for shelters.
   Tens of thousands more got into their cars and headed up
Interstate 26 toward Columbia.
   Mayor John Bourne of North Charleston, where there apparently
were no storm-related deaths, credited people for heeding the
warnings.
   ``It was bad, but it could have been a lot worse,'' he said.
``You've just got to say nice things about the people.''
   Meanwhile, Garnet had some good news for storm-weary
Charlestonians: late Saturday the tropics were quiet with no other
storms brewing.
   ``There's nothing to worry about out there,'' he said.

<HEAD>`Orpheus Descending,' Starring Vanessa Redgrave, Opens on Broadway</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: ADDS 4 grafs to UPDATE with additional reviews</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: No PMs planned.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MICHAEL KUCHWARA</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   Peter Hall's production of ``Orpheus
Descending'' by Tennessee Williams is a first-rate revival of a
second-rate play.
   The drama, which opened Sunday at Broadway's Neil Simon Theater,
was brought here as a vehicle for Vanessa Redgrave who scored a
huge personal triumph with it in London last season.
   Miss Redgrave is often riveting, but the real hero of the
evening is Hall who directs Williams' overwritten, overwrought and
oversexed fandango with the commitment of a true believer.
   ``Orpheus'' isn't ``The Glass Menagerie,'' ``A Streetcar Named
Desire'' or even ``Cat on a Hot Tin Roof,'' but you'd never realize
it from Hall's fidelity to this overripe material. He revels in its
excessive poetry and non-realistic structure. The director uses
sound effects, music, lighting and even bizarre makeup for some of
the characters to underscore Williams' often obvious points about
good and evil, carnality and purity.
   The play, set in a small, unnamed Southern town, intertwines the
tales of Lady Torrence (Miss Redgrave), the bitter wife of a dry
goods store owner, and Val Xavier, a young drifter she hires to
work in the store.
   The two are kindred spirits, longing to be free from the ties of
this terrible little town where bigotry, hatred and even murder are
everyday occurrences. Lady, the daughter of an Italian bootlegger
killed by local Klansmen, yearns for something better than her
loveless marriage to a dying husband. Val, who used to sing in
little clubs and bars along the Mississippi, is a modern-day
Orpheus. Now, he's striving to be a model of rectitude after a life
of booze and women. Like Orpheus attempting to save Eurydice, Val
eventually tries to rescue Lady from an unhappy life.
   Heavy-handed symbolism saturates the play, and there is a great
deal of talk about little birds who never stop flying and if they
do, they die; fig trees that supposedly are barren but finally bear
fruit, and Val's guitar which becomes a symbol of everything that
is good and pure about his life and the only thing he really loves.
   Miss Redgrave plays Lady with an odd Italian accent that sounds
unnaturally upper class, but the rest of her portrait is
convincing. Her performance is earthy and intelligent, an odd
combination that works well against Kevin Anderson's Val.
   Val is the play's most problematic character, an obvious plot
device, but Anderson makes him into a credible human being. He also
projects a sexy scruffiness that brings some truth to the physical
relationship between Val and Lady.
   There is a wonderful moment at the opening of the play when
Beulah Binnings, one of the town's bigoted biddies, spins out
Lady's past history to the audience in what amounts to a soliloquy.
Her speech is the best written scene in the play, and actress
Sloane Shelton seizes it with a ferocity that is spellbinding.
   The play also is populated by a collection of stock Williams
characters _ crazy, almost Gothic creatures who in the hands of
lesser actors would verge on parody.
   Anne Twomey, wearing white pancake makeup and heavy mascara that
makes her look like Anthony Newley in ``Stop the World _ I Want to
Get Off,'' offers a compelling variation on the standard Williams
woman with loose morals but a strong sense of right and wrong. And
Tammy Grimes, after a shaky start, really becomes a batty religious
fanatic who has visions and attempts to save Val from his past as
well as his future.
   Other finely etched characterizations are offered by Brad
Sullivan as Lady's cancer-riddled husband; Marcia Lewis as his
malevolent nurse and Bette Henritze, Peg Small and Patti Allison,
as a Greek chorus of small-town gossips.
   ``Orpheus Descending'' has an interesting history. It began life
in 1940 as ``Battle of Angels,'' which was to have been Williams'
Broadway debut. But the play, which starred Miriam Hopkins, died in
Boston and didn't make it to New York until 17 years later, with
Maureen Stapleton. Anna Magnani and Marlon Brando starred in the
1960 film version which was called ``The Fugitive Kind.''
   This production doesn't reclaim ``Orpheus Descending'' as a lost
masterpiece. But it makes a persuasive case for another look at the
lesser works in the large Williams canon. Despite the excesses of
the writing, there is pleasure to be found in Miss Redgrave, the
other cast members and Hall's unerring direction.
   Other reviews:
   _Frank Rich of The New York Times called the fusion of Vanessa
Redgrave and Tennessee Williams ``an artistic explosion that was
bound to happen.'' Williams and Redgrave are ``brilliant theater
artists'' who ``run at life bravely, openly,'' he wrote. But Rich
said the supporting cast was inadequate, ``whether through
miscasting or underrehearsing.''
   _``What a splendid start to the season!'' Clive Barnes said in
the New York Post. He called Redgrave's acting in the play
``atrocious,'' but ``oddly and unerringly accurate,'' and called
the event ``a Broadway occasion not to be missed.''
   _ ``Miscast, overdirected, exhaustingly overacted, the latest
incarnation of `Orpheus Descending' is a profound disappointment,''
wrote Howard Kissel in the Daily News.

   A Canadian marathon swimmer crossed the
channel from Santa Catalina Island to the mainland for her final
endurance swim of a year in which she crossed the English Channel
and the Strait of Juan de Fuca.
   ``I feel a little bit sore and tired, but I'm looking forward to
eating seafood for the first time in six months,'' Vicki Keith said.
   ``I don't like to eat seafood during swimming season,'' she
explained, because ``I'm always afraid some big fish is going to
come up and bite me because I ate one of his relatives.''
   The 28-year-old marathoner was greeted by about 25 people when
she waded ashore at Cabrillo Beach at about 4:30 p.m. Saturday, a
little more than five hours ahead of the 20-hour schedule she had
set for herself on the 22-mile swim.
   As in each of her previous swims this year, Ms. Keith used only
the butterfly stroke. She was believed to be the first person to
swim between the island and mainland using only the butterfly.
   Ms. Keith ended an attempted July 28 swim from Catalina about
six miles shy of Cabrillo Beach after flailing in a powerful
current.
   She made Saturday's swim in 14 hours, 53 minutes and 26 seconds.
   Ms. Keith cracked jokes about sharks and dodged ship traffic
during the crossing.
   Two weeks after her first Catalina effort, Ms. Keith became the
first person to swim the frigid waters of the Strait of Juan de
Fuca in 33 years, organizers said, swimming from Port Angeles,
Wash., to Victoria, Canada.
   In 1988, the Canadian mastered all five of the Great Lakes in
benefit swims that raised than $550,000 for a Toronto sports
training and fitness center.
   This summer she also crossed the 42-mile-wide English Channel
and swam 14 miles across Australia's Sydney Harbor in marathons
promoting children's charities.
   Ms. Keith hoped to raise up to $30,000 with Saturday's swim to
support the pediatric AIDS Clinic at County-USC Medical Center and
the UCLA Children's Artificial Limb Bank.

<HEAD>Billions of Dollars Laundered Through Storefront Cash Companies</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Storefront check-cashing businesses in America's
inner cities are helping to launder billions of dollars to drug
dealers in South America and Asia, according to a published report.
   Thousands of the small shops also defraud legitimate customers
who want to transmit money _ often recent immigrants with relatives
in their home countries _ by diverting the funds, The New York
Times said in today's editions.
   ``The magnitude of the problem is huge,'' said Jill M.
Considine, superintendent of banks in New York and chairwoman of
the Conference of State Bank Supervisors.
   The most serious problems are in California, Florida, New York
and Texas, state banking regulators told the Times.
   The increase in the number of money-transmitting stores
corresponds to the rapid growth in the illegal drug industry and to
efforts by legitimate banks to comply with a federal law that
requires the reporting of deposits of more than $10,000.
   Typically, a storefront operation takes drug profits _ sometimes
packed in suitcases _ and deposits the money in a legitimate bank,
sometimes under the name of a fictitious corporation. From the
bank, the money is electronically transferred to another bank,
leaving no trace of the real depositor's identity.
   The legitimate banks report the names of the corporations to the
government, so the drug dealers's identities don't show up in any
records.
   A small percentage of the money-transmitting stores are licensed
and regulated but the majority are illegal, unlicensed and
unregulated, the paper said.
   In the New York area alone, the paper said, bank regulators have
identified more than 130 illegal money transmitters. The state has
issued licenses to 35 companies, more than half of them issued in
the last year, the Times said.

   Fire broke out on a 600-foot Danish
ferry in the North Sea early today, killing at least two people and
injuring 10, the Danish Sea Rescue Center said.
   The Tor Scandinavia was carrying 540 passengers, mostly British
citizens, and 110 crew members when the ship caught fire out at
dawn about 90 miles off the west coast town of Esbjerg.
   The fire was under control within a few hours, the rescue center
in Arhus in central Denmark said. The Danish radio said the ferry
was heading for Esbjerg on its own engines.
   Joergen E. Petersen, a spokesman for the shipping line DFDS,
said none of the 540 passengers 110 crew members had been
evacuated. One of the injured was flown by helicopter to Esbjerg
because of asthma respiratory troubles.
   The nationalities or identities of the victims were not
immediately released. The rescue center said injuries were minor
and caused by inhalation of smoke.
   The blaze started in a linen closet in the bow on the fifth deck
of the 14,893-ton ferry, owned by DFDS, or Scandinavian Seaway
shipping line.
   The Tor Scandinavia was on a regular ferry service from Goteborg
on the Swedish west, to Harwich on Britain's east coast and to
Esbjerg on the Danish west coast, the owner, DFDS, said.
   The liner was about to cross the North Sea from Goteborg to
Harwich off the Danish coast when the fire was discovered.
   Three helicopters from the Danish coast guard and one from
Norway were dispatched to the scene, bringing medical aid, said a
spokesman of the Danish Sea Rescue Center.
   The Tor Scandinavia, which can carry 1,500 passengers and 400
cars, was built in 1976 the Flinder ship yard in Luebeck, West
Germany, and is one of Scandinavia's largest ferries with swimming
pool, gym and a move theater.

   President Bush is preparing to
challenge the Soviet Union to match the United States in making
cuts of more than 50 percent in chemical weapon stockpiles as a
step toward abolishing them, administration sources say.
   Bush planned to make the proposal today in New York in his first
presidential speech before the 44th session of the U.N. General
Assembly. Secretary of State James A. Baker III said the initiative
would ``move the world closer to a ban on chemical weapons.''
   Bush brushed aside reporters' questions about his speech when he
went for a brisk early morning jog prior to departing for New York
City.
   Baker, appearing on NBC-TV's ``Today'' program, said Bush would
propose ``significant reductions'' in chemical weapons that ``will
improve the chances significantly'' of curbing their use.
   Administration sources in New York said Sunday night that Bush
would tell the United Nations he is prepared to slash U.S. chemical
weapons stockpiles by more than 50 percent provided the Soviet
Union makes similar reductions.
   Bush also planned to suggest sanctions against other countries
which proceed with chemical weapons production, the sources said.
   Baker informed Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze of
the president's intention in their talks over the weekend in
Jackson Hole, Wyo. There the two sides agreed on a two-stage
U.S.-Soviet program to exchange information about their chemical
weapons and to inspect each other's plants and arsenals.
   The president, who served as U.N. ambassador in 1971-1972, also
planned today to call for international cooperation on drugs,
terrorism and the environment.
   Bush also was expected to salute steps toward democratic reforms
made in Eastern Europe, Latin America and Africa. And he was to
offer support for economic restructuring and reforms in the Soviet
Union, expressing confidence in the goals set out by Soviet
President Mikhail S. Gorbachev, officials said.
   The proposal regarding chemical weapons was described by one
official, insisting on anonymity, as ``a new initiative to move
forward in elimination of chemical weapons, to reduce stockpiles
and generally try to give a new impetus to a total ban.''
   Bush today also was meeting in New York with U.N. Secretary
General Javier Perez de Cuellar. And, he was to meet with Brazil's
President Jose Sarney, Israeli Finance Minister Shimon Peres,
Guatemalan President Vinicio Cerezo, Venezuelan President Carlos
Andres Perez and Bolivian President Jaime Paz Zamora.
   Bush planned to host a lunch for NATO allies, and with his wife
Barbara, also was visiting the Metropolitan Museum of Art for a
diplomatic reception and dinner.
   The United States and Soviet Union are the only nations that
admit to having chemical weapons. However, U.S. analysts estimate
two dozen countries actually have the weapons or the capacity to
produce them.
   ``The president has been concerned for a number of years about
the horrors of chemical weapons,'' said Brent Scowcroft, the
president's national security adviser.
   ``He made a major presentation to the U.N. conference in 1984 on
the possibility of banning chemical weapons and he will have some
proposals tomorrow to advance that issue,'' Scowcroft said Sunday
on the NBC show ``Meet the Press.''
   As Ronald Reagan's vice president, Bush twice had to cast the
deciding vote to break a tie in the Senate for continued production
of chemical weapons. On one occasion, Reagan called Bush's elderly
mother, Dorothy, to explain why he had instructed her son to take
an action that she disapproved of.
   The final version of the speech was completed Sunday.
   ``We added a couple of things,'' Bush told reporters Sunday
during a futile fishing excursion. Bush, who arrived Friday at his
vacation home in Kennebunkport, spent much of each day playing golf
and fishing _ even in a driving rainstorm.
   Baker and Shevardnadze signed an agreement to exchange data on
chemical weapons by the end of the year and allow visits by
inspectors of the other side to stockpiles and plants by June 30.
In a second phase, there would be more intensive on-site
inspections of the submitted data.
   Among an array of other accords, they also reached agreement on
the broad principles for verifying limits on strategic forces and
nuclear tests.
   In a major development, the Soviets said they would drop their
demand that the United States abandon work on its Star Wars missile
defense program before concluding a treaty curbing long-range
missiles, bombers and submarines.

   The Bush administration is setting next year's
superpower summit meeting as the target for completion of a treaty
to slash long-range nuclear arsenals by 30 percent to 50 percent.
   To lay the groundwork, and also hasten an accord on troops and
tanks in Europe, Secretary of State James A. Baker III probably
will meet with Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze twice before
the summit, an official said.
   Baker would go to the Soviet Union sometime between November and
January, and Shevardnadze would come to the United States
afterward, a senior U.S. official said Sunday night.
   Shevardnadze and Baker, who just finished two days of productive
talks in Jackson Hole, Wyo., are known to be considering locations
other than Moscow for the next meeting.
   Baker, on the NBC-TV ``Today'' program this morning, declined to
predict whether the treaty would be finished by the time of the
summit meeting, which he said probably would be in late spring.
   ``If you ask me, `will we have a START (Strategic Arms Reduction
Talks) agreement?' I can't tell you that we will,'' Baker said.
   A Soviet decision not to let a dispute over space-based defenses
stand in the way is expected to improve chances of completing a
strategic weapons treaty.
   But, Baker said Sunday on CBS-TV's ``Face the Nation'' program,
``We are not home yet by a long shot.''
   Among the unsettled issues are procedures for verifying
compliance with cuts in bombers, missiles and submarines.
   But Baker said the Soviet decision to deal separately with its
objections to the U.S. Star Wars program was a major achievement.
   ``What I think you see here is an exercise of political wil by
the leadership on both sides _ the Soviet Union and the United
States _ to move us forward across the broad range of our arms
control agenda,'' Baker said.
   Later, on a U.S. Air Force jet to New York for the opening of
the U.N. General Assembly, a senior U.S. official said a strategic
arms reduction treaty may be ready at the summit.
   ``If we can't get to a START agreement, certainly a summit will
move it forward _ or should,'' said the official, who spoke on
condition of anonymity.
   Baker said the success of his meeting with the Soviet foreign
minister should silence congressional critics and dampen their
appetite for unilateral arms cuts.
   Despite progress in the Jackson Hole talks to cut strategic,
conventional and chemical weapons, Baker said the Soviet Union was
still ``a military threat.''
   ``I think it would be quite naive for the United States to talk
about unilateral reductions of its strategic arsenal,'' Baker said.

   A 750-foot tanker loaded with crude oil from
Venezuela ran aground early today in the Gulf of Mexico near an
approach to the Mississippi River.
   ``There's no leak or anything. It's aground in the mud and sand
down there,'' said Coast Guard Chief Petty Officer Michael Robling.
   He said the Universal Monarch was carrying 515,000 barrels _
21.6 million gallons _ of oil when it notified the Coast Guard
about 1:30 a.m. that it had run aground. A tugboat was reportedly
on the way to pull the tanker loose, Robling said.
   The site is near the Southwest Pass approach to the river, one
of several channels through the bayous at the end of the river. It
is at the tip of Louisiana's ``boot'' about 80 miles southeast of
here.
   The ship was registered in Panama; the Coast Guard did not know
its owners, Robling said.

   Scores of East Germans scaled the
fence of the West German Embassy during the weekend, bringing to
900 the number of refugees in the compound seeking passage to the
West, refugees said today.
   The number increased as prospects improved for a solution to the
standoff. West German Foreign Minister Hans Dietrich Genscher is to
meet this week at the United Nations with his Czechoslovak and East
German counterparts, Jaromir Johanes and Oskar Fischer.
   One young man who refused to identify himself told a reporter
that 876 East Germans were in the embassy garden, virtually all of
them staying in tents. There was no official confirmation of the
figure.
   Meanwhile, Austrian authorities reported that 568 East Germans
crossed the Hungarian-Austrian border since early Sunday, bringing
the total to 20,474 since the Hungarian government opened the
border for East Germans to emigrate to West Germany on Sept. 10.
   In Bonn's embassy in Warsaw, Poland, about 230 East Germans were
last reported to wait for emigration to the West.
   In Budapest, the state news agency MTI reported Monday that 129
persons entered Hungary illegally from Czechoslovakia during the
weekend, with 128 of them East Germans and one Czechoslovak
citizen. Eighty-seven of them swam across the Danube between Rajka
on the Czechoslovak side and Esztergom.

   The next storm here may be in the state
capitol _ or in court _ when outraged property owners fight back
against a law prohibiting some people from rebuilding their
devastated beachfront homes.
   Even as the toll of Hurricane Hugo was tallied over the weekend,
debate erupted anew over South Carolina's Beachfront Management
Act, which is designed to prevent erosion and overdevelopment of
the state's ever-shifting coastline.
   Under the act, certain beachfront buildings cannot be rebuilt if
they are more than two-thirds damaged _ a provision that would
apply to many of the homes that were blown down by Hugo.
   Even before the hurricane, decisions were pending on three
lawsuits challenging the act. Now Hugo may prompt a reassessment of
the state's hard line on rebuilding.
   On Saturday, state Rep. Kenneth Corbett of Myrtle Beach asked
Gov. Carroll Campbell to call a special legislative session to
consider revising the law. Campbell said he would consider the
request.
   Meanwhile, the permit administrator of the Coastal Council,
Steve Moore, said a blanket permit might be issued to allow people
to repair homes that are less than two-thirds damaged.
   For now, the owners are under the rules of the law, which took
effect in July 1988. At the time, many lawmakers and
environmentalists hailed the act as a solution to degradation of
the state's beachfronts, especially along the popular Grand Strand
resort area that runs from Georgetown to North Myrtle Beach.
   The bill was opposed by those in banking, real estate and
tourism, as well as by several beachfront landowners.
   In general, the Beachfront Management Act sets three lines of
demarcation for shore construction:
   _No new construction within 20 feet of the actual or estimated
dune line.
   _Buildings from the dune line to 20 feet back can be repaired
with approval from the South Carolina Coastal Council if they are
less than two-thirds destroyed. If two-thirds of a building needs
to be rebuilt, it is termed destroyed and cannot be rebuilt.
   _No building of 5,000 square feet or larger can be built between
the water and a line where beach erosion can be estimated to reach
in 40 years.
   With its 135 mph winds and powerful tidal surge, Hugo virtually
destroyed most oceanfront property from Folly Beach to Surfside
Beach, and caused extensive erosion elsewhere along South
Carolina's 187-mile coast.
   Patty Scarafile, owner of an oceanfront home on the heavily
damaged Isle of Palms, 12 miles southeast of Charleston, said the
beachfront law was a great concern and she believed residents would
press for revisions.
   ``I think most people haven't even had a chance to see what the
condition of their property is,'' she said.
   ``The real problem here is we have people whose homes are
destroyed or partially destroyed,'' said Richard Davis, executive
vice president of the Association of Realtors. ``I don't think any
law we have on the books right now can properly address this.''
   Decisions on three lawsuits filed by Hilton Head Island
residents challenging the constitutionality of the law are pending
in U.S. District Court in Charleston. Earlier this year, the state
lost another lawsuit charging it illegally took land without
compensation from an Isle of Palms property owner, who was unable
to build on his two beachfront lots because of the law.
   An appeal of the $1.2 million judgment is pending.
   Despite the unusual circumstances created by Hurricane Hugo, a
state Coastal Council member said the 18-member council would have
to wait for legislative action before making exceptions to the law.
   ``I assume what we would have to do as a council is adhere to
the law until such time changes can be made,'' said Sen. Herbert
Fielding of Charleston, a council member. ``We're to administer the
law, and we can't change it unless the Legislature as a whole
changes it.''

   Celebrators attending a dinner to honor the
40th anniversary of Communist China exchanged verbal insults with
about 75 pro-democracy demonstrators outside a Chinatown restaurant.
   ``Where is your conscience?'' chanted protesters, who carried
placards at Sunday's rally denouncing the Chinese government for
killing pro-democracy students in and around Beijing's Tiananmen
Square in June.
   ``Murderers, murderers, that's what you are,'' yelled a woman
waving a sign reading, ``Freedom For China, Now.''
   Gilbert Kuo of the Chinese Alliance of Democracy, one of several
groups that organized the rally, said the protesters were angry
about the mass arrests and executions in China after the government
crackdown June 4.
   Most of about 500 guests invited to the $15-a-plate banquet
honoring the founding of the People's Republic of China pushed
through the crowd to attend the dinner. Some stopped and exchanged
volleys of insults with the demonstrators.
   Lee Morgan, who attended the dinner despite the hecklers, said
they have a right to voice their views but that he disapproved of
their methods.
   ``If they are sincere, why don't they go to China and petition
the government?'' he said. ``If you have a fight with your wife,
you go home to fight; you don't go to a friend's house.''
   John S.C. Ong, an organizer of the banquet, said the
demonstrators ``have a right to protest and we have a right to
celebrate. This is America.''

<HEAD>Uprising Leaders Denounce Egypt, Say Rebellion Must Continue</HEAD>

<DATELINE>JERUSALEM (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Underground leaders of the Palestinian uprising
today denounced Egypt's peace proposals and urged Palestinians to
pursue their rebellion against Israeli rule.
   Israel's two rival governing parties, meanwhile, moved toward
compromise on the Egyptian plan. Officials suggested further talks
with Egypt before pursuing a controversial proposal for
Israeli-Palestinian talks.
   In the occupied Gaza Strip, masked assailants killed a
35-year-old Arab health worker with an ax, claiming he collaborated
with Israel, Arab reports said. The army said it was investigating.
   Sayed Muhsen, who was attacked in a U.N. clinic in Gaza's Rafah
district, became the 120th Palestinian slain by fellow Arabs on
such allegations since the start of the 21-month uprising. He was
the fifth killed in Rafah this week. The army confirmed the slaying
and said police were investigating the circumstances.
   Israel Television said PLO chief Yasser Arafat has moved to
prevent more attacks on suspected collaborators by dispatching a
letter to activists in Gaza this week, urging them to stop slaying
fellow Arabs.
   The latest underground leaflet, the 46th issued since the
uprising began on Dec. 8, 1987, called for ``the continuation of
our intefadeh (uprising) with lots of awareness and alertness.''
   The leaflet, issued today, criticized Egypt's President Hosni
Mubarak for proposing a new peace initiative earlier this month
``at the same time as the enemy was increasing oppression of our
people.''
   ``There is no chance we can accept the 10 Egyptian points unless
they include the obviousness and necessity for PLO participation in
the political process on an equal footing with other parties,'' the
leaflet added.
   Mubarak's plan does not specifically mention the PLO.
   It also criticized the Egyptian plan for failing to specify that
negotiations lead to formation of a Palestinian state in the West
Bank and Gaza Strip _ a main goal of the Palestine Liberation
Organization.
   Mubarak's plan supports Israel's proposal to hold elections in
the occupied lands to chose Palestinian delegates for talks with
Israel about an interim solution of self-rule.
   The Egyptian plan has been rejected by Prime Minister Yitzhak
Shamir because it demands that Israel accept the U.S.-backed
principle of trading territory for peace, and allow east Jerusalem
Arabs to vote in the elections.
   Shamir and his right-wing Likud bloc also reject Egypt's
proposal to put together a 10-member Palestinian delegation for
preparatory talks with Israel that would include two Palestinians
deported from the occupied territories.
   The idea is a compromise with the PLO, which wants diaspora
Palestinians involved in the talks. Shamir claims it would let the
PLO into negotiations through the back door.
   But the left-leaning Labor Party, Likud's partner in the
coaltion Cabinet, wants Israel to accept both the plan and proposed
delegation as a way to break an impasse in peace efforts.
   A showdown has been postponed until Oct. 4, when the Egyptian
proposals are scheduled for a formal vote by the decision-making
Inner Cabinet.
   One idea broached by Labor officials was to circumvent the
Palestinian delegation plan by suggesting preliminary talks with
the Egyptians before any negotiations with Palestinians.

   Thousands of Vietnamese soldiers
bade farewell to Phnom Penh today, leaving behind citizens worried
that the dreaded Khmer Rouge is already taking advantage of Hanoi's
pullout with new assaults.
   Hundreds of army vehicles including artillery and tanks paraded
in front of the Royal Palace as a band played a song celebrating
the ``solidarity'' between Vietnam and Cambodia.
   Several thousand people including Cambodian soldiers and
schoolchildren lined the streets waving flags in yet another
government-organized ceremony marking what Vietnam says is the
withdrawal of its final 26,000 troops.
   Heng Samrin, president of the Vietnamese-installed government,
thanked the commanders of departing Vietnamese units 479 and 979.
Twelve Buddhist monks in saffron robes chanted blessings.
   Cambodian and Vietnamese commanders embraced and were presented
flowers from women in traditional costumes.
   After the brief ceremony, the soldiers headed east for the
Vietnamese border on narrow Highway No. 1. That was a main route
Vietnamese forces used to invade Cambodia in late 1978 and end
nearly four years of Khmer Rouge rule in which hundreds of
thousands died.
   After an overnight rest, the soldiers were to cross from Svey
Rieng province to Vietnam's Tay Ninh province, supposedly ending
Hanoi's involvement in the stalemated war against the Khmer Rouge
and two other guerrilla groups. Other units were to return home by
the Mekong River and the Gulf of Thailand.
   The guerrillas have called the six-day troop movement a fake,
but the Khmer Rouge has beseiged the gem-rich western town of
Pailin in recent months, evidently to take advantage of a
Vietnamese retreat from the Thai border area.
   The Khmer Rouge claimed today it had captured the Ratanamondol
district seat at Sdau township, on Route 10 which links the town of
Battambang with Pailin.
   On its radio station, the Voice of the National Army of
Democratic Kampuchea, the Khmer Rouge called the area a ``major
strategic position whose task is to defend Battambang town from the
south.'' A transcript of the radio report was seen in Bangkok.
   Battambang is about 160 miles northwest of Phnom Penh.
   The defense minister, Gen. Tea Banh, has acknowledged the
guerrillas have seized territory around Pailin but says it remains
under Phnom Penh control.
   Phnom Penh's best division, the 196th, was defending Pailin
against some 3,000 guerrillas of elite Khmer Rouge divisions 415
and 320, said Khieu Kanharith, a prominent newspaper editor who
recently visited the front.
   Khieu said the Khmer Rouge were raining 800 to 2,000 shells
daily. He said the guerrillas trucked in ammunition from a short
distance while Phnom Penh forces were supplied from bases 75 miles
away.
   Since 1979, only soldiers have lived in Pailin, he said in an
interview.
   The battle has intensified concern in the country over whether
the army of the Vietnam-installed Phnom Penh government can handle
the guerrillas alone.
   Some Phnom Penh residents have been stocking rice anticipating
the guerrillas will cut off supplies to the city, Cambodian
officials said. Some senior government officials have been saving
money and gold in case they need to flee abroad, Western aid
officials say.
   Already many Vietnamese civilians, including entire villages of
fishermen, reportedly have fled back home.
   The Khmer Rouge toppled the U.S.-backed Lon Nol government in
April 1975, and immediately drove the people of Phnom Penh into the
countryside at gunpoint. Attempting to turn Cambodia into a
primitive agrarian commune, they created slave labor camps that
became mass graves.
   On Sunday, Phnom Penh's Prime Minister Hun Sen urged the main
non-Communist resistance leader, Prince Norodom Sihanouk, to break
with the Khmer Rouge and return home.
   Sihanouk's hands have been ``soaked in blood'' by the alliance,
he said.
   Hun Sen called on China, Thailand and other countries to keep
what he said were pledges to stop military aid to the guerrillas
once the Vietnamese have left.
   ``We have clearly seen that our enemy has prepared all
eventualities for civil war,'' he told a news conference. ``The
scope of the war will depend on the attitude of foreign countries.''
   In a statement issued in Bangkok, Sihanouk said today he would
only take part in future peace talks if they are held within an
international framework.
   He rejected absolutely any negotiations with Hun Sen, and said a
report on the Voice of America radio station that he had agreed to
bilateral talks ``does not correspond with reality.''
   Thailand has allowed the insurgents to set up camps in its
territory, while China has armed them.
   The Soviet ambassador, Rashit Khamidouline, has said his
government is continuing arms supplies to Phnom Penh but not
increasing them as Vietnam retreats.
   Hun Sen confirmed that he and guerrilla leaders have just agreed
to resume peace talks.
   But he said he would not back off from his demand that any
settlement must include dismantling the Khmer Rouge army and
political organization.
   Talks in Paris failed in July after Hun Sen rejected guerrilla
demands that the Khmer Rouge be included in a transitional
government.

   Fans of two rival soccer clubs hurled
rocks, bricks and homemade bombs at each other and more than 100
people were hurt, including 12 policemen, police said today.
   At least 29 people were arrested on charges of rioting, police
said.
   The brawl began Sunday night in the port city of Chittagong
after a match between league champion Abahani Sports Club and the
Brothers Union ended in a 1-1 draw, police said by telephone.
   Police said the referee apparently stopped the game one minute
early. One of the players punched the referee in the face and other
players and fans followed, throwing iron rods, sticks, bricks,
rocks and small bombs at each other, police said.
   Mobs also burned or damaged at least 25 cars and buses and
looted six shops and a house near Chittagong Stadium, police said.
   Police armed with steel-tipped batons intervened to try to stop
the fighting, which lasted nearly three hours, they said. When they
could not disperse the mobs, they fired at least 25 canisters of
tear gas.
   More than 100 people were injured, police said. About 25 people,
including seven policemen, were hospitalized in serious condition,
they said.
   On Sept. 17, more than 100 people were injured in a clash at
Chittagong Stadium after another hometown club lost.

<TEXT>
   Afghan rebels have closed a critical
supply route between Kabul and the war-battered eastern city of
Jalalabad, a guerrilla group said today.
   About 1,000 fighters overran four government posts Sunday along
the strategic 75-mile road near Sarobi, 30 miles east of Kabul,
said Masoud Khalili, a spokesman for the powerful Jamiat-i-Islami
guerrilla group.
   Earlier this year, Jalalabad was the scene of the bloodiest
fighting in the rebels' 11-year-old war to topple successive
Communist governments in Kabul.
   Jalalabad, located 45 miles west of the Pakistan border, was
seen as a test of guerrilla strength following February's
withdrawal of about 103,000 Soviet soldiers from Afghanistan.
   But government troops dug in. Despite initial successes,
particularly at the key Communist garrison town of Samarkhel near
Jalalabad, the guerrillas were stopped at the heavily fortified
city limits.
   Guerrilla fighters have closed the Kabul-Jalalabad highway
periodically but have been unable to keep it closed beyond a few
weeks. The guerrillas' weapons supply will decide how long the
latest blockade lasts, Khalili said.
   Khalili also said guerrillas still block the key Salang Highway,
a critical supply route between Kabul and the Soviet Union
reportedly closed in mid-September.
   The United States has sent millions of dollars in military
hardware and humanitarian assistance to the guerrillas in the past
decade. The rebels, who call themselves mujahedeen or Islamic
``holy warriors,'' also are bankrolled by Saudi Arabia and other
Arab states.

   Two moderate earthquakes hit southern
Greece today but caused no damage or injuries, authorities reported.
   The Geodynamic Institute said the first quake measured 4.8 on
the Richter scale and the second, three minutes later, was 4.5 on
the scale. Both tremors had their epicenter in the sea 18 miles
west of Pylos in the Peloponnesus.
   Police said most of residents of the area felt the earthquakes
but displayed little or no concern.
   The Richter scale is a gauge of energy released by an earthquake
as measured by ground motion recorded on a seismograph. A magnitude
5 quake can cause considerable damage if its epicenter is in an

<TEXT>
   China lodged a protest with the French government
today for allowing pro-democracy Chinese dissidents to meet in
Paris and form a group dedicated to ending Communism in their
homeland.
   ``It is indeed a rare case in international relations that the
government of a country brazenly supports activities on its
territory by a handful of foreigners aimed at opposing and
subverting the government of a foreign country,'' the Foreign
Ministry said in a statement.
   The statement came after a meeting between a ministry official
and French Ambassador to China Charles Malo in which China
expressed its ``profound indignation'' to France.
   China's sharp response followed a three-day inaugural meeting in
Paris of the Federation of Democracy in China. During the meeting,
pro-democracy delegates from 15 countries elected dissident
political scientist Yan Jiaqi and student activist Wu'er Kaixi as
chairman and vice chairman of the new group.
   The federation is to be based in Paris.
   Yan, Wu'er and other leading participants in the organization,
including computer entrepreneur Wan Runnan and prominent economist
Chen Yizi, fled China after the June 3-4 military crackdown on the
democracy movement and are wanted by the Chinese government on
charges of counter-revolutionary activities.
   ``Their purpose in setting up the so-called `Front (Federation)
for Democracy in China' is to overthrow the Chinese government and
subvert the socialist People's Republic of China. Allowing them to
do so on French territory means that the French government connives
at and supports their anti-Chinese government activities,'' the
ministry said.
   ``The above-mentioned action by the French government is a
brutal trample on the principles of mutual respect for each other's
sovereignty and mutual non-interference in each other's internal
affairs.''
   The statement said the French government should ``rein in at the
brink of the precipice and truly abide by the norms governing
state-to-state relations.''
   If not, it said, France would be responsible for further damage
to Sino-French relations.
   Relations between Paris and Beijing already were badly strained
by France's criticism of the June crackdown. France has in effect
frozen high-level diplomatic contacts and joined other Western
nations in urging China to respect the human rights of students and
others calling for democratic reform.

<TEXT>
   Hundreds of thousands of people today
attended a peaceful rally called by the country's major opposition
parties to launch their campaign to unseat the government of Prime
Minister Rajiv Gandhi.
   The National Front, a loose alliance of the country's opposition
parties, also used the rally to celebrate the 75th birthday of Devi
Lal, the powerful chief minister of Haryana state and a major
opposition leader.
   Officials and police at the capital's Boat Club, where the rally
was held, said as many as 1 million people attended. About 15,000
policemen were deployed to control the crowd, believed to be the
largest ever at a political rally in New Delhi.
   Political analysts called the rally a direct challenge to Gandhi
and his Congress Party to call parliamentary elections immediately.
The voting must be held by Jan. 4, 1989.
   ``It's almost like saying to the government: `Here in the
capital are our supporters. We dare you to match numbers in
elections,''' said Mohan Guruswamy, a political analyst with a New
Delhi-based research group and a guest lecturer at Harvard
University.
   The rally also was seen as an attempt by the fractious, often
feuding opposition to show it has united.
   ``Only if the entire opposition is united can we overthrow the
Congress-ruled government at the center,'' said A.B. Vajpayee,
leader of the Indian People's Party, one of about 12 groups that

<HEAD>Report: Central Park Attackers Argued Over Whether to Kill Victim</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   One of the teen-agers accused of raping the
Central Park jogger claims the group argued over whether to kill
her to keep her from identifying them, according to a published
report.
   A previously unreleased videotaped statement by one of the
suspects shows that some of the attackers tried unsuccessfully to
prevent the others from further harming the woman after she was
raped, New York Newsday reported in today's editions.
   The so-called ``wilding'' attack on the young investment banker,
which left her brain-damaged, and the beating of several other
people in Central Park the same evening drew widespread attention.
   Kharey Wise, 17, told prosecutor Elizabeth J. Lederer in his
second videotaped statement that one suspect, Steve Lopez, wanted
to kill the woman but that another, Yusef Salaam, said, ``Don't
kill her, man. Don't kill her. Bad enough you're raping her. Don't
kill her, man.'''
   But Wise said he and Salaam, 15, could not persuade the others _
Lopez, 15; Kevin Richardson, 14; and Raymond Santana, 15 _ to leave
the woman alone after the gang rape April 19, the paper said.
   ``Kevin and Raymond picked up a rock. ... Kevin hit her in the
face with a rock. That's what knocked her out, definitely knocked
her out,'' Newsday quoted Wise as saying.
   He said the victim was struck with bricks and cut with a knife
and fingernails before he could not watch any more.
   The attackers thought the woman was dead when they left her,
Wise said in the taped statement, said the newspaper.
   In the three days that followed the attack on the female jogger,
Lederer interviewed six of the suspects on videotape: Wise,
Santana, Richardson, Lopez, Antron McCray, 15, and Michael Briscoe,
17. At Wise's request, she interviewed him twice, the paper said.
   Salaam and Jermain Robinson, 15, did not make videotaped
statements. All eight of the suspects also provided written
statements.
   Prosecutors and defense attorneys are scheduled to appear today
before Manhattan State Supreme Court Justice Thomas B. Galligan,
who is expected to set a date for the start of hearings to
determine whether the statements should be admitted as evidence in
the trial.
   The victim is undergoing rehabilitation treatment at Gaylord
Hospital in Wallingford, Conn. Though she suffered permanent brain
damage, defense attorneys say they still expect prosecutors to put
her on the stand during the trial.

   An early-morning fire swept through a South Side
house today, killing four children and a 45-year-old man,
authorities said.
   The mother of three of the children was burned in the fire and
was in serious condition at Roseland Community Hospital, and a
police officer was being treated for smoke inhalation, authorities
said.
   The fire broke out in the 1{-story frame building shortly after
4 a.m., said Fire Department spokesman Stanley Span. The cause of
the blaze was not known, he said.
   All of the bodies were found in the attic, which was completely
engulfed in flames when firefighters arrived, Span said.
   The survivor was identified as Anita Price, 31, and the dead man
as her boyfriend, Robert Davis. The children who died were her
sons, 9-year-old Lionel and 13-year-old Pierre; her daughter,
Monique, 8; and her niece, Tymeise Price, 9, authorities said.
   It was the second fire in as many days to claim five lives. Four
children and their mother died Sunday in Mathis, Texas, when fire
destroyed their home. The woman's mother-in-law and her grandchild
were rescued in that fire.
   Nicalosa Gonzalez Amador, 67, remained in very critical
condition today in the burn unit of a Corpus Christi hospital with
third-degree burns. The grandchild, 1{-year-old Michael Rosales,
was in critical condition at another hospital.

<TEXT>
   Election officials voted to postpone this
week's mayoral and city council primaries because Hurricane Hugo
has knocked out power to so many polling places, officials said.
   The Mecklenburg County elections board voted unanimously
Saturday to postpone the primary for two weeks until Oct. 10. It
may be the first election in Charlotte or the state to be delayed
because of weather.
   ``Then again, we've never had a Hurricane Hugo,'' said county
Elections Supervisor Bill Culp.
   Hugo roared through this city, some 200 miles from the coast,
Friday morning, weakened from its peak destructiveness but still
packing winds of up to 75 mph. In Charlotte, more than 125,000
customers were still without power as of Sunday, Duke Power Co.
reported.
   The county's mechanical voting machines do not need electricity.
But the power company told elections officials Saturday that, at
best, only half the city's 107 polling places, mostly in schools
and churches, will have power by Tuesday.
   ``If you do not have sufficient light, voters can't read the
ballot,'' Culp said.
   Duke couldn't even guarantee that electricity would be restored
to all polls by the following Tuesday, Oct. 3. So the elections
board decided to hold the primary Oct. 10.
   The delay affects the GOP mayoral primary, and at-large and
district city council primaries in both parties.
   Incumbent Mayor Sue Myrick will face newcomer Samuel Elijah
McClure in the GOP contest. There is no Democratic mayoral primary
because candidate Craig Madans has no opposition. The general
election is in November.

<TEXT>
   Four days after Hurricane Hugo hit,
residents of this once-picturesque barrier island began getting
their first look today at a snake-infested shambles that has been
cut off from the mainland.
   Two boats normally used for tours to Fort Sumter loaded 380
people and left in a driving rain this morning from Mount Pleasant
for the Isle of Palms. Residents were allowed to take one suitcase
to bring back belongings, and were expected to be able to spend
only 90 minutes at their homes before the boats returned.
   The boats, hired by the city of Isle of Palms, were to ferry
people all day.
   People carried sheets of plastic to cover holes in their
ceilings, and brought backpacks, suitcases and cat carriers, hoping
to find pets left behind.
   Nikki Brownell, who said she lived on the island all her 54
years, said the trip today would allow her to begin planning the
rest of her life.
   ``I'll know where I stand and where things stand, and what
arangments have to be made,'' she said. ``It's been terrible. It's
very bad for your mind. It makes you very apprehensive, not
knowing.''
   Only two people per household were allowed on the boats, and
non-residents were banned.
   Officials refused to allow an insurance claims adjuster from
Aetna Life and Casualty Co., Tom Greaney from Hartford, Conn., to
go, although he said two homeowners were policyholders.
   ``We tell people to take an inventory of their damaged
belongings so we can get to work on their claims. These people
haven't had a chance to go out and do that,'' Greaney said. ``And
we're disappointed that there's going to be a lot of secondary
damage because of this rain.''
   Kay Robinson, a National Weather Service meteorologist in
Columbia, said today there was an 80 percent chance of rain through
tonight and a 60 percent chance for storms Tuesday.
   ``It's going to make it harder to accomplish anything, going to
make everything a little more miserable,'' he said.
   Tom Buchanan, a policeman in the resort town of about 2,000,
said damage on the island is widespread _ and so are the snakes.
   ``What I have seen is total devastation,'' Buchanan said. ``I've
never seen snakes as big as I've seen in the past few days, every
time we pick up a board.''
   Construction was to begin today on a pontoon bridge linking Isle
of Palms and adjacent Sullivan's Island to the mainland. The
pontoon, which would temporarily replace the twisted Ben Sawyer
Bridge, should take at least two weeks; repairs to the Sawyer
bridge could take six months, said engineer Herman Snyder of the
state highway department.
   The neighboring islands, located 15 miles from Charleston and
home to about 6,000 people, have been under martial law since the
hurricane because of heavy damage and fears that residents could
get hurt working on homes with no way to get medical attention.
   Like many others, Sullivan's Island resident Peter Greim took a
small boat to the island to check out his house.
   ``I ran to my house,'' he said. ``My house was structurally OK.
It had parts of other houses in the yard. Trees are down
everywhere.''
   Fifty-five to 65 percent of the homes on the Isle of Palms are
unsafe, propane gas is leaking and the roads are littered with
downed power lines and debris, Arnold said. Many homes are standing
on just one or two stilts.
   ``Last night we just sat here and listened and we could hear
them falling and breaking. It's a very unsafe situation,'' Arnold
said.
   At a meeting Sunday, Mayor Carmen Bunch had implored people not
to try to reach the island on their own.
   ``We're going to build the island back. We've got to stop the
anarchy that's been talked about. We're not going to let anyone
take over the city by force,'' she said.
   On Saturday night, acting deputy chief James Meade quit when Ms.
Bunch turned down his plan to allow residents to return.
   Several people have been arrested for looting, officials said,
and there is a danger to boaters from submerged boats, appliances
and debris in the surrounding waterways.
   The 15-member police department has been patrolling the island
in garbage trucks, golf carts and bicycles because their cruisers
are on the mainland.

   Judges threatened to strike unless they
receive more protection from cocaine traffickers, and a
congressional leader called today for the government to begin
negotiating with the drug barons.
   Three bombs exploded Sunday night at banks in the capital but
caused no injuries. The blasts are among more than 100 attacks that
have killed at least six people and injured 130 since the
government's war on drugs began Aug. 18.
   The president of the House of Representatives, Norberto Morales,
said today he favors a peaceful settlement with the traffickers.
   ``We have to open a way toward this initiative because we are
bleeding to death (and) our economy as in ruins,'' Morales said in
a live interview with the radio chain Caracol.
   The mayor of Medellin, Juan Gomez, also said in a Caracol
interview today that ``after this war is over and there are many
dead and destruction, we are going to end up at the negotating
table talking with the drug traffickers.
   ``The dialogue would be Christian because it would avoid many
deaths,'' he said.
   A contender for the presidential nomination for the ruling
Liberal party, Ernesto Samper, said in an interview published in
the Bogota daily La Republica today that if the government's war
against the traffickers fails, ``the road left is legalization of
drugs.''
   Samper is a strong front runner for his party's nomination for
the presidential elections next March.
   At the Bogota daily El Espectador, editor Juan Guillermo Cano
said in a signed column Sunday that Colombia's congressmen are
cowards for not joining the fight against the drug traffickers.
   In reference to stories in Colombian newspapers recently that
some Colombian congressmen have been denied visas to the United
States because of links to drug traffickers, Cano said:
   ``We have finally hit bottom. Hitting bottom, we will know how
many parliamentarians are aligned with the easy money.''
   Cano's father, Guillermo Cano, then publisher of the paper, was
assassinated by drug traffickers in 1987. On Sept. 2, a car bomb
with an estimated 500 pounds of dynamite exploded, causing heavy
damage to the El Espectador building.
   Judicial union officials were to meet today with acting Justice
Minister Carlos Lemos Simmonds to discuss security, which they say
should include bulletproof cars and vests, guards with metal
detectors at their offices and other security measures.
   ``We don't see any will on the part of the government to
increase security for our lives,'' Antonio Suarez Nino, president
of the National Association of Judicial Employees, said Sunday in a
communique.
   Monica de Greiff, who resigned as justice minister last week
after being threatened by drug traffickers, said she was promised
$19 million in extra U.S. aid earlier this month to protect judges.
   The union said it has heard nothing since about the aid.
   Colombian judges say that in the meantime many of them earn so
little that they are forced to take a bus to work despite cocaine
barons' threats to kill 10 judges for each suspected trafficker
extradited to the United States.
   Since 1981, about 50 judges and 170 judicial employees have been
killed and judges this year have repeatedly walked off the job or
threatened to strike over a lack of security.
   The National Association of Judicial Employees says 1,600 of the
country's 5,000 judges have been threatened with death in the last
12 months.
   So far just one such suspect has been extradited to the United
States since President Virgilio Barco decreed emergency powers last
month in declaring war on the drug bosses. The army said Sunday
that it had captured another, Carlos Gomez Zapata, who is wanted on
drug trafficking charges in Florida.
   Barco on Wednesday begins his trip to the United States. In
addition to a meeting with Bush on Thursday, he is expected to
plead for help in the drug war in an address to the U.N. General
Assembly.
   Cocaine and coffee will be the topics of his meeting with Bush,
according to the agenda published in Bogota newspapers in recent
days.
   Colombians have complained that what the United States gives
military aid to fight the drug traffickers but costs Colombia
coffee revenues because of Washington's opposition to an
international agreement on coffee quotas and prices.

   Admirers remembered Irving Berlin upon his death
as the heart and soul of American pop music, and said his songs
such as ``White Christmas,'' ``Blue Skies,'' and ``God Bless
America'' will never die.
   The Russian cantor's son who wrote nearly 1,000 songs died
Friday night in his Manhattan townhouse at age 101.
   Much of his music was written for stage and movie musicals, but
dozens of his songs have been performed over and over from Las
Vegas cabarets to country-western bars.
   Among his songs are ``Alexander's Ragtime Band,'' ``Always,''
``Mandy,'' ``Anything You Can Do I Can Do Better,'' ``There's No
Business Like Show Business,'' ``Cheek to Cheek,'' ``I've Got My
Love to Keep Me Warm,'' ``Heat Wave'' and ``A Pretty Girl is Like a
Melody.''
   ``It's become part of our language, part of our heartbeat, part
of our soul,'' said composer-conductor Morton Gould, president of
the American Society of Composers, Authors and Publishers, which
Berlin helped found.
   ``Your songs will be with us always,'' the organization said in
a full-page advertisement in The New York Times today.
   ``Very few people have come to touch and move the soul of a
nation,'' said President Bush, who joined a crowd of thousands in
Boston singing ``God Bless America'' in honor of the songwriter
Saturday. ``Mr. Berlin ranks among such people, a composer, a
legendary man whose words and music will help define the history of
our nation.''
   ``This is a great loss,'' said composer Burt Bacharach. ``But
Irving Berlin has left us with the greatest legacy through his
music.''
   Broadway theaters dimmed their lights Saturday night in tribute.
   On Sunday, more than 100 people held a candlelight serenade
outside Berlin's Manhattan townhouse. There was no indication if
anyone was home.
   ``There was sobbing. You can't avoid it,'' said John Wallowitch,
a composer and cabaret singer who led the group. He also has
organized serenades outside Berlin's home at Christmas and on his
birthday for about 20 years, ``but I never wanted to do it for this
reason.''
   Born Israel Baline on May 11, 1888, he was 5 when his family
emigrated from Temun in eastern Russia to New York. The death of
his father forced Berlin him to start working at age 8. He worked
in vaudeville, and as a singing waiter.
   In 1907, he published his first song, ``Marie of Sunny Italy,''
and he had his first hit in 1911 with ``Alexander's Ragtime Band.''
   Some of his songs have become pop hits across the generations.
His ``Puttin' on the Ritz,'' made the charts when it was revived in
1983 by the Dutch singer Taco, and his 1926 composition ``Blue
Skies'' helped get an album by country singer Willie Nelson on the
charts in 1978.
   Berlin was an immigrant Russian whose ``God Bless America''
became the nation's unofficial second national anthem. He was a Jew
whose ``White Christmas'' and ``Easter Parade'' became Christian
holiday traditions.
   Though he never learned to read music, he wrote 19 stage
musicals and 15 movie scores. Twenty-five of his songs have topped
the popular music charts, according to ASCAP.
   Berlin got a medal during the Statue of Liberty centennial in
July 1986 from then-President Reagan, who appeared in the
Berlin-scored 1943 movie musical ``This is the Army.''
   The biggest names on Broadway played in his musical successes,
which began in the World War I era with ``Watch Your Step,''
starring Irene and Vernon Castle, and ran through such post-World
War II hits as ``Annie Get Your Gun'' and ``Call Me Madam,'' both
with Ethel Merman.
   ``A Pretty Girl Is Like A Melody,'' one of many Berlin wrote for
the Ziegfeld Follies, became the unofficial theme song for every
Ziegfeld extravaganza.
   In Hollywood, Berlin did the scores of ``Top Hat,'' starring
Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers; ``Holiday Inn'' with Astaire and
Bing Crosby; ``Blue Skies''; ``Easter Parade''; ``White
Christmas''; and ``There's No Business Like Show Business.''
   His last Broadway show was ``Mr. President'' in 1962. His last
song, ``An Old Fashioned Wedding,'' was published in 1966.
   Berlin was awarded three medals for his music and a special Tony
award for his contribution to the musical theater. His won a
congressional medal for the World War II musical ``This is the
Army,'' and the Academy Award for best song of 1942 for ``White
Christmas.''
   His second wife, the former Ellin Mackay, died in 1988 after 62
years of marriage. Berlin is survived by his three daughters, Mary
Ellin, Linda and Elizabeth.

   Electricity finally flowed through five
downtown hospitals in hurricane-ravaged Charleston, but thousands
of people were without power and short of food, clean water or cash
for a fourth day today.
   ``I eat where I can get a meal,'' said Renildo Holmes, 26, who
had no food at home and was eating barbecued chicken, sweet corn
and butter beans from a mobile kitchen opened Sunday by the Alabama
State Baptist Convention.
   ``My neighborhood looks like a trash barrel. Everything is out _
trees, light poles and cars overturned.''
   Hundreds of Isle of Palms residents, meanwhile, began finding
out whether Hurricane Hugo spared their homes. Boats that are
usually used to carry tourists to Fort Sumter began ferrying
residents to the island, which like other barrier islands, has been
off-limits since being evacuated last week.
   Aerial surveys showed more than half the island homes to be
unsafe. Propane gas leaked, and power lines, trees and debris
cluttered roads.
   But angry and worried residents had been threatening to defy the
mayor's declaration of martial law and go to the island on their
own. It will be midweek at least before people can go to stay,
police said.
   ``When you come to the island, you better wear boots. There are
snakes all over the place,'' Mayor Carmen Bunch told 500 homeowners
at a meeting Sunday in Mount Pleasant.
   Ms. Bunch, whose own house was demolished, brushed back tears as
she told residents: ``We're going to build the island back. We've
got to stop the anarchy that's been talked about. We're not going
to let anyone take over the city by force.''
   Coastal South Carolina, hit hardest by Hugo as it swept onto the
U.S. mainland with 135 mph wind late Thursday, suffered billions of
dollars in damages, officials said. Preliminary damage estimates in
the Charlotte, N.C., area reached more than $366 million.
   But it will be days before anyone has accurate assessments of
the losses. Insurance agents were going house-to-house, gathering
information and handing out initial checks.
   Bob Sheets, director of the National Hurricane Center, said the
storm could be one of the most devastating to ever hit the U.S.
mainland.
   ``We're looking at damage between $1 and $2 billion,'' said
Sheets, who is touring the South Carolina coast today. Some state
and local officials have placed the damage estimate at $3 billion
or more.
   The death toll from Hugo's six-day rampage stood at 51 _ at
least 27 people in the Caribbean and 24 in the Carolinas, Virginia
and New York.
   In Charlotte, election officials voted unanimously Saturday to
pospone this week's mayoral primary because the hurricane knocked
out power to so many polling places. The election will be held Oct.
10.
   More than 100,000 Charlotte area homes and businesses remained
without power today, and officials said it might be two weeks
before electricity is completely restored.
   A National Guardsman and a Charlotte police officer were struck
by a car today while directing traffic at an intersection that was
left without a signal because of the storm, officials said. Both
were hospitalized, officials said.
   There were small signs of life returning to normal in
Charleston. Garbage pickups were scheduled today, and five bank
branches were opening, Mayor Joseph P. Riley Jr. said.
   Construction was to begin today on a pontoon bridge to link the
barrier islands to the mainland. The only land link _ the Ben
Sawyer Bridge _ was ruined and repairs will take four to six
months, said engineer Herman Snyder, of the state Department of
Highways and Transportation.
   Charleston Memorial Hospital, about a block from the harbor, was
one of five with full power late Sunday.
   ``It's amazing the difference it will make. We can run air
conditioning so we can control temperature in the operating
rooms,'' said administrator Lynn Beasley. ``We can run normal
equipment and just function like a normal hospital.''
   Beasley said the emergency room was busy Sunday, with many
people suffering cuts from chainsaws and axes they're using in the
cleanup.
   ``We were delivering babies using flashlights,'' said Charlene
McCants, hospital administrator for the Medical University of South
Carolina, which also switched from generators to full power.
   At least 760,000 people in the Carolinas remained without power.
Some Charleston County residents may be groping without lights and
refrigerators for a month.
   Fifty churches in the Columbia area Sunday asked congregants for
donations for hurricane victims. Within hours, the items filled
10,000-square-foot room in the Carolina Coliseum. Trucks were
expected to begin carrying donations to the coast today.
   Riley said people from around the United States have donated
money, goods, blood and time to help. In an interview today on
``CBS This Morning,'' Riley asked Americans to keep sending money,
building supplies, non-perishable food, disposable diapers, baby
food and clothing.
   ``We've got a lot of people who are hurting here and they need
our help,'' he said.
   In the three-county area around Charleston, 75,000 people were
out of their homes, Riley said. Schools are closed until further
notice, and a dusk-to-dawn curfew remains in effect.
   There was evidence of tension during the weekend as the relief
at having survived the storm wore off.
   Police said there was a report of gas being sold for $5 a gallon
and of a company charging $3,000 to cut down five trees.
   An emergency law authorizing 30-day jail terms for price-gouging
was enacted.
   At one supermarket Saturday, people waited four hours to get
inside. On Sunday, a line for a hot meal stretched three blocks.
   Saturday, about 200 people began pushing and cursing as they
waited for an ice distribution that never occurred.
   ``The people are short-tempered right now,'' said Patrolman
Angel Ortiz.
   ``I'm frustrated, man,'' said 26-year-old Gerald Dean, whose
2-year-old child was diagnosed with meningitis and hospitalized the
day Hugo hit. He has been unable to get his paycheck from the
restaurant where he works, and even if he could, the lack of
electricity kept banks closed.
   National Guardsmen with M-16 rifles patrolled streets in the
battered city of 65,000 people, guarding against looters and
keeping order at locations where residents lugged coolers and
plastic jugs to get fresh water and ice.
   ``People were ... begging for ice,'' Staff Sgt. Bill Petty of
the South Carolina National Guard said Saturday. ``There were
fistfights in the line. They were down-on-the ground fights _ men
and women.''
   By Sunday night, 27 people had been charged with looting in
Charleston, and about a dozen others had been arrested for such
offenses as disorderly conduct, violating the curfew and petty
larceny.
   As a cold rain fell Sunday morning, church bells pealed above
the hum of generators and the buzz of chainsaws as residents of the
affluent Historic District began repairing their homes.
   ``We have no roof and we've got 3 feet of water in the living

what we were born with and that's good health. ... Anything else is
just gravy.''

   The government today unveiled a $750 billion
budget that cuts military spending by 8.3 percent and increases
financing for social needs, reflecting the Soviet Union's shifting
priorities under Mikhail S. Gorbachev.
   Finance Minister Valentin Pavlov said the government is planning
to cut the $192 billion deficit in half by raising $83 billion in
new revenues and trimming expenditures by $10.3 billion.
   He told the opening of the fall session of the Supreme Soviet
legislature that military spending could be cut because the Soviet
Union's ``realistic and constructive foreign policy'' had led to an
improvement in international relations.
   The decision to cut military spending from $119 billion to $109
billion is in keeping with a directive from the Congress of
People's Deputies parliament to cut military spending by 14 percent
by 1991, Pavlov said.
   Military research alone will be cut by $3.4 billion, he said.
   Officials say the 1990 budget is of an ``emergency character''
because of the deficit that has spun out of control as the
country's economic situation worsens. The budget deficit is only
the second the Soviet government has acknowledged.
   The finance minister said the government was planning to raise
pensions for 60 million retirees by an average of 15 percent and
reorient the Soviet economy toward fulfilling social needs.
   Pavlov did not immediately say how the government would raise
the extra money.
   Earlier in the day, Gorbachev told the Supreme Soviet that the
government will take firm steps to settle the ethnic dispute over
Nagorno-Karabakh if Armenia and Azerbaijan cannot end it quickly.
   ``If the situation doesn't stabilize, I think our government,
along with the republics, will have to take concrete steps,''
Gorbachev said over the dispute over the autonomous region of
Nagorno-Karabakh in Azerbaijan.
   Armenia and Azerbaijan, two neighboring southern Soviet
republics, have been locked in a bitter 19-month dispute over
control of the enclave. About 100 people have died in the ethnic
conflict.
   An economic blockade of mainly Christian Armenia, which receives
more than 80 percent of its food and fuel via predominantly Moslem
Azerbaijan, has left shelves bare and industry at a virtual
standstill.
   Gorbachev did not say what measures he had in mind, but in
replying to legislators' questions Gorbachev indicated that he
wanted the problem resolved within days.
   Located in the Caucasus Mountains in the southern Soviet Union
north of Iran, Nagorno-Karabakh's area is 1,760 square miles,
slightly smaller than Delaware. The 1979 Soviet census put
Nagorno-Karabakh's population at 162,000, of which 76 percent were
ethnic Armenians and 23 percent ethnic Azerbaijanis. Under
Gorbachev, the Supreme Soviet has been transformed from a rubber
stamp for Communist Party directives into a lively forum for debate.
   The current body, chosen after spring elections that gave Soviet
voters their first choice among candidates in seven decades, is
scheduled to sit for two months.
   It has about 80 items on its agenda, including the matter of
granting economic sovereignty for several of the country's 15
republics and methods for settling labor disputes, the official
Tass news agency said.
   The body will devote Mondays and Tuesdays to general sessions
and the rest of each week to committee meetings.
   In its first session as a competitively elected body, the
542-member Supreme Soviet held confirmation hearings on
Cabinet-level jobs and forced the withdrawal of several candidates
put forward by the government.
   On the agenda now are calls by the Congress of People's
Deputies' first organized opposition group to permit people to own
their own land, establish market pricing, permit independent
television broadcasting and allow Soviets to move freely within
their country.
   Soviets must now carry internal passports and obtain permission
to move into desired urban areas such as Moscow, and the government
still denies external passports to many citizens.
   The group of 345 reform-minded deputies of the 2,250-member
Congress, known as the Inter-Regional Group, includes such Supreme
Soviet legislators as political maverick Boris N. Yeltsin and human
rights activist Andrei Sakharov.
   The Supreme Soviet is made up of full-time legislators elected
by the Congress, which meets at least once a year and was chosen in
spring elections.
   The Inter-Regional Group is calling for legalization of private
property, and the introduction of market pricing. Gorbachev's
advisers also have promoted letting supply and demand set prices.
But in the face of strong public objection to lifting government
subsidies, the government has promised to delay the proposal for
several years.
   The opposition group proposes that the vast industrial
ministries, which now control the supplies and decisions of most
factories in the country, be replaced with small commissions of
experts in the field.
   The group also wants ``an end to the government monopoly on
television.''

   Salvage crews removed the wreckage of a USAir
jet from the East River to check it for evidence of a mechanical
flaw that might have caused last week's crash, while prosecutors
weighed criminal charges against the crew.
   A grand jury could be asked to consider charges of leaving the
scene of an accident or even criminally negligent homicide against
the pilot and copilot of the Boeing 737-400, a source in the
district attorney's office told The Associated Press.
   Another source in the office told the Daily News that Queens
Borough District Attorney John J. Santucci may offer immunity from
prosecution to the copilot, Constantine Kleissas, in return for his
testimony.
   Santucci's office on Sunday declared the crash site off
LaGuardia Airport a crime scene.
   The National Transportation Safety Board is conducting a
separate probe into Wednesday's crash of Flight 5050, which killed
two people; 59 others were rescued from the partially submerged
plane that skidded off a runway and cracked into three pieces.
   A lawyer for Kleissas and for the captain, Michael W. Martin,
said he saw no basis for a grand jury probe, and news reports
indicated some investigators were skeptical the criminal charges
would hold up.
   ``Based on everything I know, there is absolutely no criminal
act committed by either pilot,'' said the attorney, Frederick
Hafetz.
   He said the two men have been ``fully cooperative with the
regulatory authorities.''
   But Kleissas and Martin were criticized by federal officials for
failing to submit immediately to drug and alcohol testing, although
they are not legally required to do so. They submitted urine
samples for testing on Friday, but results will not be available
for three weeks.
   The two pilots' flight licenses were suspended because they
disappeared from the accident scene, authorities said.
   Crews on Sunday hoisted the plane from the river, and federal
authorities said they would examine it to see if mechanical
problems caused or contributed to the crash.
   The plane's front, tail and main fuselage sections were taken to
an American Airlines hangar at LaGuardia, NTSB spokesman Ted
Lopatkiewicz said.
   Investigators said they found that the wheels under the
jetliner's nose were locked to the right, indicating the pilot had
turned them sharply to counter the plane's pull to the left.
   Authorities said Martin, 36, has told investigators he aborted
the takeoff because the aircraft was drifting to the left and he
felt and heard a strange vibration.
   He believed he had enough room to stop the plane, but it skidded
off the runway and into the water.
   At weekend news conferences, NTSB officials said Kleissas had
inadvertently pushed a button that shut off an automatic throttle,
but the plane's unexplained veer to the left also was being
investigated as a cause for the crash.
   Kleissas, 29, who had flown a 737-400 only once before on a
passenger flight, was at the controls, but Martin manually took
over the throttle after Kleissas pushed the button, authorities
said.

   A passenger in the truck that collided with
a school bus told investigators he reminded the driver about a stop
sign moments before the accident that killed 20 students.
   School resumed today with a prayer for the victims after
funerals for 16 of the students over the weekend. Four other
funerals were to be held today.
   Ruben Pena, an assistant to the soft drink deliveryman, said
Sunday he told driver Ruben Perez, ``You have a stop here.''
Seconds later, he said, the truck plowed through the stop sign and
into the school bus, causing it to tumble a water-filled pit.
   Pena's statements came in an interview with National
Transportation Safety Board investigators, who on Sunday re-enacted
the crash on a two-lane road 15 miles from the Mexican border.
   Perez has told authorities his brakes failed before he went
through the stop sign.
   At Mission Junior High today, students and teachers joined hands
and prayed before class. ``What I feel in my heart and soul is that
none of the students who died in the bus accident deserved to die
this young or in this manner,'' principal John Abbenante said over
the school's public address system during homeroom period.
   Abbenante said counselors also would be available all day and
permits would be given for students to attend the remaining
funerals. As classes began, tearful students came to the office to
ask for counseling and permission to leave.
   The principal read the names of the victims and dedicated the
school year to them. School employees wore special mourning
ribbons; maroon and white, the school's colors, with a strip of
black. Teachers at the junior high also placed the ribbons on their
car antennas.
   Only five students, all from Mission High School, today rode the
route of the crashed bus. Buses on other routes appeared full.
   There were 81 people aboard the bus; all 61 survivors were
injured, and the driver and two students remained hospitalized
today. Perez and Pena also were injured.
   The truck, which weighed about 44,000 pounds loaded, was
traveling about 45 mph and was about 300 feet away from the
intersection when Pena warned Perez of the stop sign, Pena was
quoted as saying by NTSB chief investigator Bob Bartlett.
   ``The driver then applied the foot brake and the trailer brake,
and downshifted into fourth gear,'' Bartlett said.
   Bartlett said investigators could not disclose any conclusions
they might have drawn from Pena's account.
   Pena told investigators that Perez had not mentioned any brake
problems with the truck before the wreck, Bartlett said. They had
just delivered soft drinks to a convenience store before the
accident occurred.
   NTSB officials hoped to interview the bus driver, Gilberto Pena,
today, Bartlett said. The two Penas are not believed to be related.
   Gilberto Pena was critically injured in the accident and was
moved out of the intensive care unit at Mission General Hospital on
Saturday.
   In nearby Mission, counselors today were to follow the schedules
of the high school and middle school students who died, said Rosa
Zapata, coordinator of counseling and guidance services for the
school district.
   The counselors were to answer any questions that are necessary,
offer help to children unable to deal with the tragedy, Mrs. Zapata
said.
   Counselors from nearby districts and social service agencies
have volunteered their help, she said.
   ``Everybody's kin to everybody else around here,'' said John
Fraser, senior counselor at Mission High School. ``If it's not
friends that they knew on the bus, it's relatives.'' Seven high
school and 13 Mission Junior High School students were killed.
   Veronica Salinas, 17, a Mission High student who lost two close
friends, said, ``It's hard to think that one moment they're with us
and the next moment they are gone.''
   Miss Salinas said she would give daily rides to 14-year-old Edna
Morales, a junior high student who was the last to get on the bus
before Thursday's accident.
   Ms. Morales, hospitalized until Saturday, said she has suffered
nightmares since she escaped through a window in the submerged bus.

   A daylong downpour left 30 city blocks
with up to 10 feet of water, killing two people in ``streets
flowing like rivers,'' authorities said.
   There was an unofficial report of 11 inches of rain falling
Sunday at the Florida Times-Union building in downtown
Jacksonville, although the National Weather Service said its
official gauges elsewhere in the city received only 2.45 inches.
   The Weather Service said it was possible that much heavier
amounts fell in parts of the city. Apalachicola, to the west in the
Florida panhandle, received 5.72 inches in the same 24-hour period.
   Rain continued to fall today and forecasters said more flooding
was possible. The rain was blamed on a stationary front.
   Sunday's rain was ``just out of proportion to anything I've ever
seen,'' said Vicki Elphick, who measured a foot of water in her
back yard and 4 inches in her garage.
   Police and rescuers struggled to reach those trapped by the high
water.
   ``We're being delayed because many vehicles are blocking the
roads,'' said John Keane, a spokesman for the city Public Safety
Department.
   Catherine Smith, 73, drowned when caught underwater in her car
for 15 minutes, Keane said.
   A man whose car was swept 50 feet from a street into a drainage
ditch also drowned when his car sank after fruitless efforts by a
passer-by to help him open a window, Keane said. The victim was not
immediately identified.
   Major intersections and portions of Interstates 95 and 10 were
closed for one to two hours Sunday afternoon, said Florida Highway
Patrol spokesman Lt. Randy Brown.
   ``We've got streets flowing like rivers,'' said Steve Weintraub,
spokesman for the Jacksonville Sheriff's Office.
   A shelter opened at the Robert E. Lee High School gymansium
Sunday afternoon but was closed at 11 p.m. after the 12 people who
sought shelter there either returned home or found lodging with
someone else, said Deborah Peeples, a spokeswoman for the Red Cross.
   Earlier, officials had estimated that 100 people were spending
the night there. There was no estimate on how many people had to
leave their homes and got shelter with friends and relatives.

   Classrooms in nearly every Utah school
district were empty today as teachers staged a one-day strike to
protest low funding, overcrowded classrooms and inadequate supplies.
   The walkout, the largest by educators in Utah in a quarter
century, involved nearly 20,000 teachers and affected 450,000
students in 800 schools, officials said.
   Only two of Utah's 40 school districts closed for the day, state
Board of Education spokeswoman Eileen Rancher said. The exceptions
were the Daggett and South Summit districts, both in the sparsely
populated northeastern corner of the state. The South Summit
schools were expected to operate without teachers.
   On Saturday, the Utah Education Association, the state's largest
teachers' union, said its local affiliates voted unanimously to
support the walkout. The UEA says it represents 85 to 90 percent of
the state's educators.
   Saturday's action was spurred by a spontaneous walkout that
began Friday morning at Davis High School in Davis County, just
north of Salt Lake City, and spread to schools in three other large
school districts by the end of the day.
   The strike apparently was incited by anger over the
Legislature's decision in a special session last week to give
Utahns a $38.4 million tax rebate, and not to allocate money to
education from a $94 million surplus.
   Teachers are decrying low pay, large classes and inadequate
school supplies. Teachers' pay in Utah ranks 43rd in the nation,
$4,500 less than the average national salary of $29,400, the
association says.
   Gov. Norm Bangerter, at a Sunday evening news conference, said
he sympathized with the teachers but thought they should wait for
the January legislative session to press their demands.
   ``I agree with the teachers that education needs more money,''
Bangerter said. ``I don't agree with the tactic.''
   However, he acknowledged that the walkout ``draws attention to
the serious problems that exist in the school system.''
   Bangerter pledged that education would be treated ``honorably
and honestly'' in January. He said the surplus may approach $185
million by year's end, but said that not all of that would go to
education.
   ``We have other state needs,'' he said.
   The public schoolteachers had urged their university
counterparts to join the walkout, but there was no sign that large
numbers of faculty were doing so this morning.
   At the Univeristy of Utah, psychology professor Stephen Golding
had said some professors might cancel classes or use the time for
discussions on what he called ``the education crisis'' in Utah.
However, no classes had been canceled by midmorning on the first
day of fall quarter, said university spokeswoman Shawn Anderson.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Lower interest rates lured buyers back into
the existing home market last month when sales rose 3.3 percent to
their highest level in six months, a real estate group reported
Monday.
   ``The August improvement ... reflects buyers taking advantage of
the declining interest rates during June and July to get into the
housing market,'' said Ira Gribin, president of the National
Association of Realtors.
   The Realtors reported existing single-family homes sold at a
seasonally adjusted annual rate of 3.44 million units last month,
up from July's revised 3.33 million units. The August pace was the
best since February's 3.48 million units.
   The Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp. reported Friday that
fixed-rate home mortgages were averaging 10.03 percent, down from
their peak rate of 11.22 percent in March.
   The Realtors' report also said the median price of a home fell
$1,800, to $94,900, in August, down 1.9 percent from July. The
median price means half of the homes cost more, half less.
   Gribin said the seasonal decline in the median price suggested
that many sales were to entry-level buyers coming in at the low end
of the market.
   ``But the bulk of the market, roughly two-thirds, continues to
be repeat home buyers, so there is still much to be done to ease
affordability conditions for potential first-time buyers,'' he said.
   The August sales pace was 6.8 percent below the August 1988 rate
of 3.69 million units.
   John A. Tuccillo, the Realtors' chief economist, said he
expected existing single-family sales to total about 3.41 million
in 1989, down about 5 percent from last year's 3.59 million.
   The Northeast showed the largest sales improvement over July
with a 7.3 percent gain to a seasonally adjusted 590,000 units.
However, the August pace was 13.2 percent below that of the same
month a year ago.
   The Midwest registered a 4.4 percent gain to 950,000 units,
followed by the South with a 3.4 percent advance to 1.35 million
units.
   The West showed the only decline in sales, down 3.5 percent to
550,000 units.
   Median prices were $148,400 in the Northeast, $72,300 in the
Midwest, $87,400 in the South and $139,400 in the West.

<TEXT>
   Winning the war on drugs may require
legalizing the personal use of cocaine and buying up the entire
coca leaf crop, Peru's foreign minister said Monday.
   In a speech to the General Assembly, Foreign Minister Guillermo
Larco-Cox noted the emergence of international drug gangsters and
alliances between terrorists and drug traffickers.
   To break up the lucrative illegal drug trade, he proposed ``the
partial conversion of the (foreign) debt into resources to fight
illegal drug trafficking, the legal acquisition of the whole of the
coca leaf production and, finally, the decriminalization of
consumption.''
   Although Larco-Cox said his proposals were tentative, he
described them as going ``beyond the stage of reciprocal
accusations between producing and consuming countries.''
   He said simply suppressing the cultivation of the coca leaf,
from which thousands of Peruvian peasants derive their income,
``would be promoting a social problem of hunger and a protest which
may swell subversion and the relocation of illegal crops.''
   Peru is fighting both the cocaine trade and the Shining Path
leftist insurgency, which is promoting a Maoist-style peasant
revolution in the Andean mountains.

   Trade disputes between the United States
and Japan should not stand in the way of greater cooperation in
space, Vice President Dan Quayle said Monday.
   Quayle and Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu agreed that their
nations would work together on a project to measure the effects of
solar radiation on the earth's magnetic field.
   Quayle also said the United States remains the best hope for
space exploration and pioneering the ``last frontier.''
   ``The United States has taken and will continue to take the lead
in space activities and we believe Japan will be a very good
partner in exploration of space,'' Quayle told reporters.
   Asked about Japan-Soviet space cooperation, Quayle did not
comment directly, but said, ``I'm convinced the best hope for space
exploration and pioneering rests with the United States.''
   The Soviet Union, facing financial and political problems in its
own space program, has made overtures to Japan on joint development
of space aircraft. The Soviet space agency plans to include a
Japanese journalist in a crew traveling to the Soviet Mir space
station in 1991.
   Quayle, who chairs the U.S. National Space Council, said a trade
dispute over satellites should be treated separately from overall
cooperation in space exploration.
   Under U.S. trade legislation dubbed the ``Super 301,'' Japan
could face retaliation for what U.S. officials charge is its
refusal to buy competitively priced U.S.-made satellites.
   ``Japan and the United States will have a partnership in space
activities. Super 301 will be treated separately. That issue should
not be a hindrance in cooperation in space,'' Quayle said.
   ``The exploration of space is an expensive proposition.
Therefore, we need international cooperation and contributions of
partners such as Japan,'' Quayle said.
   Monday's agreement calls for Japan to provide a satellite and
scientific instruments, and the United States to provide equipment
and launch the satellite in 1992, said a joint statement issued by
Quayle and Kaifu.
   Quayle, who attended a luncheon with Emperor Akihito on Monday,
leaves Tuesday for the Philippines. He also is to visit Malaysia
before returning to Washington.

   Summer floods killed nearly 3,000 people and
inundated about 34.6 million acres of farmland this year, the State
Flood Control Headquarters said Monday.
   The worst-hit areas were the provinces of Zhejiang, Jiangxi, and
Sichuan, Yang Zhenhuai, deputy chief of the headquarters, told the
official Xinhua News Agency.
   Earlier reports said more than 1,500 people died in torrential
rains and flooding this year in Sichuan, China's most populous

   A powerful typhoon, the second of the summer, hit Zhejiang last

   Flooding in a few major rivers had been more serious than usual

heavy damage, Yang said.
   In the summer of 1988, floods killed 2,678, with Zhejiang again
being among the most seriously affected.

<TEXT>
   High school students returned to classes
throughout Burma on Monday after an absence of more than a year
while the country went through a pro-democracy uprising and bloody
military repression.
   Schools were closed in June 1988 following demonstrations that
urged the end of a quarter century of authoritarian rule. High
school and university students were at the forefront of the
uprising, crushed Sept. 18, 1988 by a military junta.
   Primary schools reopened June 19 and middle schools August 14.
Universities and colleges remain closed but officials say they will
be opened before the end of the year.
   No incidents were reported as high school students, who numbered
nearly 250,000 by last year's count, returned to class.
   Although the military government has promised general elections
next year, it has been criticized by the United States and other
countries for continuing human rights abuses, such as detention and
torture of political dissidents.

being supplied Monday by a backup coal- and oil-fueled station, the
state electric company announced.
   The sabotage occurred at about 7:15 p.m. Saturday on
transmission lines carrying electricity from South Africa to
Maputo, said a statement given to the national news agency, AIM.
Saboteurs attacked the lines about 15 miles west of Maputo, but AIM
gave no further details.
   Electricity transmission lines from South Africa were last
sabotaged on the night of Aug. 22, the news agency said.

   A crowded bus plunged off a bridge and
into a river in southwestern Bangladesh today, killing at least 33
people, authorities said.
   At least 11 others were missing, and 15 passengers were
hospitalized, said the police chief of Manikganj, 25 miles
southwest of Dhaka.
   Earlier reports said at least 60 people were killed.
   Doctors said the driver had been drinking.
   The accident occurred early today on a busy highway near
Manikganj, about 25 miles southwest of Dhaka, said police chief
Mohammad Ferdous.
   The bus was traveling from the northern town of Naogan to the
capital.
   The driver apparently lost control of the vehicle, which
careened through the protective railing on the bridge and plunged
50 feet into the Ichamati River, Ferdous said.
   Mohammad Hossain, a survivor, said the driver, who was among the
dead, was driving dangerously and appeared drunk. Doctors who
conducted a post mortem confirmed he had been drinking.
   Two weeks ago, a similar accident occurred on the outskirts of
Dhaka. Thirteen people were killed and 24 injured.

   The environment must be protected with the
help of the United States and other major industrial countries to
raise living standards in the Third World, says B.T.G. Chidzero,
the finance minister of Zimbabwe.
   He is chairman of the Development Committee, which brings
together members of governments from the Third World and richer
countries. Its sessions, part of the annual meetings of the World
Bank and the International Monetary Fund, ended Monday.
   ``Neglect of the environment will increase the cost of
development,'' Chidzero told reporters.
   ``The environment is a long-term investment. ... Neglect may
superficially facilitate development, but not in the long run.''
   His statement contrasted with the view, once widely held in the
Third World, that efforts at conservation are an obstacle to their
progress or even part of a plot by former colonial powers to hold
them back.
   Chidzero appeared at a news conference on a Development
Committee report, ``World Bank Support for the Environment,'' made
public Monday. The bank is owned by 152 countries, with the largest
voting power in the hands of the United States. It is the largest
source of development loans to Third World countries.
   Figures the bank made public last week showed a continuing
decline of incomes in many Third World countries in 1988. Figures
from its sister organization, the International Monetary Fund,
indicate a continued decline of average incomes in much of southern
Africa and Latin America.
   The World Bank has been heavily criticized by environmentalists
and members of Congress as neglecting or even undercutting
conservation. For example, it helped build a major road in western
Brazil that brought in large numbers of settlers whose main purpose
was to destroy the rain forest so they could plant crops.
   Managers of the bank have countered criticism with increased
attention to environment issues.
   ``If the World Bank has been part of the problem in the past, it
can and will be a strong force in finding solutions for the
future,'' Bank President Barber Conable was quoted as saying in a
new brochure issued by the bank. The brochure is called ``Striking
a Balance _ The Environmental Challenge of Development.''
   ``The bank's goal is to blur the lines between environmental
activities and the rest of the bank's work,'' it said.
   The bank approved more than $21 billion in new loans last year.
It has been trying to take environmental protection into account
each time it makes a loan. On Sunday it announced that it a new
phase of a joint project with the European Investment Bank and the
U.N. Development Fund to help clean up the Mediterranean. Initially
it will have $10 million to $15 million to spend.
   The brochure told of moving a group of Patagonian conures, a
rare parrot, to new breeding areas when the old ones were about to
be disturbed by a dam under construction in Chile. Other projects
will help manage forests in Sri Lanka and promote reforestation in
Bangladesh.

   A low overpass ripped a valve off a
propane truck today, allowing highly flammable propane gas to spew
into the air, and the truck blocked evacuation of a subdivision,
authorities said.
   ``You've got a lot of gas. You can't move the truck. It's a very
dangerous situation,'' said Police Chief Madison Bailey.
   No injuries, fire or explosions were reported.
   Electricity in the area was shut off to prevent ignition of the
propane.
   Bailey said many of the estimated 300 to 400 people authorities
wanted to evacuate from the area were being concentrated instead in
a community hall at the opposite end of their subdivision from the
truck. Earlier, he said they had been evacuated.
   The subdivision, which contains about 600 homes, is at the
northern end of Aquidneck Island and is surrounded by water on
three sides. The only roads out of it pass through the site where
the truck was wedged under the low railroad bridge.
   If necessary, the residents would be led out of the area on foot
across a golf course, Bailey said.
   Bailey said the leak was bigger than authorities first thought
and estimated it would take several hours for all the 1,900 gallons
of liquefied propane to vaporize. He said it had proved to be
impossible to transfer the propane to another truck.
   The wind, which had been blowing the gas away from the homes,
had shifted by midday and was bringing it closer to the homes,
Bailey said.
   Players were evacuated from a nearby golf course. Golf pro
Stephen Diemoz said he had to drive the course in a golf cart to
round up players. ``They said this thing has the potential to
create a fireball that could last for a mile, and we were downwind
of it,'' Diemoz said.
   A highway through the area was closed, as was a bridge linking
Portsmouth, an Aquidneck Island town of 15,000, to Tiverton on the
mainland.
   The truck missed clearing the overpass by just a few inches,
said Fire Lt. John Martin.
   ``He didn't tear the tank open,'' Martin said. ``He knocked a
valve off the top of the tank that was protruding.''
   The bridge is 9 feet, 5 inches high and the truck missed
clearing it by just a few inches, Bailey said.
   The propane was allowed to continue leaking as it vaporized,
because authorities feared it would be too risky to try to cap the
leak, Martin said.
   Robert Ferreira, air traffic manager for the Federal Aviation
Administration in Providence, said the FAA was considering closing
the area within a five-mile radius to aircraft because of the
threat of ignition. He did not know if that would disrupt takeoffs
or landings at any nearby airports.
   An emergency response team from the state Department of
Environmental Management was on the way, spokeswoman Fran Segerson
said.

<HEAD>Judge Orders Oil Company to Lay Pipe the Old-Fashioned Way</HEAD>
<DATELINE>COSHOCTON, Ohio (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An appeals court is being asked to decide
whether an oil company seeking to replace a pipe will have to do it
the old-fashioned way _ with human hands and horses.
   In August, Judge Richard I. Evans ruled that the Ohio Oil
Gathering Corp. could not be barred from replacing the pipe it
installed more than 60 years ago. But he said the company could not
use heavy machinery that might damage property outside the 10-foot
easement it was granted in 1924.
   The property owner, Bruce Shrimplin of Warsaw, had fought the
company's efforts to replace the pipe.
   The company had argued that the easement was not practical for
modern machinery and said the primary purpose of the easement,
granted by John B. Foster, the property's previous owner, was to
give the company access even if it damaged the land.
   But Evans sided with Shrimplin, citing a handwritten statement
by Foster in the original document that said: ``This grant covers
the pipe line in the place and manner it is now laid.''
   The judge ruled that Foster's statement limited the methods and
machinery that could be used to those available in 1924.
   While the company may employ some modern materials, such as
welded pipe rather than pipes joined by threaded joints common to
the 1920s, the company ``is not free to invade defendants' land
with a horde of monstrous machines which subject the land to much
greater damage than ... was ever thought of by John B. Foster in
1924,'' Evans said.
   ``Crops and fences can be replaced in short order; native
hardwood trees and valuable topsoil cannot,'' the judge wrote.
   The company appealed on Thursday.
   A witness for the company, Reo Davis, said that when the pipes
were laid, men with shovels dug the trench, the pipes were hauled
to the site by teams of horses and the pipes were laid by hand.

   A 69,000-volt electrical wire touched a
scaffolding being moved at a construction site today, killing three
workers and injuring three others, authorities said.
   The accident occurred as six workers were rolling the 25-foot
scaffolding away from a building under construction at Worthington
Industries on the city's north side, said Doug Reardon, president
of Target Construction Co., the general contractor. No one was on
the scaffolding.
   The workers _ all men _ were putting up aluminum siding on the
building, which is to be a distribution center.
   Officials at Columbus Southern Power Co. said the cable, which
ran about 30 feet from the building, was carrying 69,000 volts of
electricity, enough voltage to supply a small town. The electric
company was called to cut power to the site.
   Reardon said workers generally do not consider wires to be a
work hazard unless they are within 10 feet. He said they probably
thought they had enough room to safely move the scaffolding, which
was on wheels, to another wall of the building.
   Roscoe Blackburn, 24, a Target Construction employee, said he
was one of several workers installing a roof on the building when
the accident occurred shortly after 10 a.m.
   ``I saws a big spark, and we went to the edge to look over and
saw them all lying on the ground,'' he said. ``We got off of there
... we just started yelling for help.''
   He said the six victims still appeared to be in contact with the
scaffolding, so he and the others did not try to move them.
   Joe Keefer, fire battalion chief, said three of the men died,
and the injured were taken to hospitals.
   ``They were all just lying on the ground. Two (survivors)
appeared to be in pretty serious shape,'' Keefer said. ``I'm not
sure about the other one.''
   Worthington Industries, which makes steel, is just north of
Interstate 270, the city's outer belt. Traffic leading to the site
was blocked off.
   A woman who answered the telephone at Worthington said she had
no details about the accident. She referred questions to a
spokesman who did not immediately return telephone calls.

<TEXT>
   The former husband of Dr. Elizabeth Morgan
today challenged the constitutionality of a law designed to free
his former wife after 25 months behind bars for concealing their
daughter in a bitter custodey battle.
   Morgan remained in jail, awaiting action on a weekend request
filed by her lawyers that she be freed.
   In a brief filed with the District of Columbia Court of Appeals,
lawyers for Morgan's former husband, Dr. Eric Foretich, claim the
legislation, which President Bush signed Saturday, infringed on the
powers of the local courts.
   The attorney, Elaine Mittleman, also said the bill violated
Foretich's rights and those of the couple's daughter, Hilary, 7.
   The Justice Department also expressed reservations to President
Bush that the law might be an unconstitutional intrusion by
Congress on the powers of the judicial branch to enforce its
orders, according to a department source who declined to be
identified.
   David Runkel, chief spokesman for Attorney General Dick
Thornburgh, refused to say what kind of advice the department had
given Bush before he signed the measure.
   Morgan has been in jail rather than produce the child for a
court-ordered visit with Foretich, claiming he had sexually abused
Hilary. Foretich denies the allegation.
   The child remains in an undisclosed location.
   ``We have not heard anything on how the court will handle it,''
said Morgan attorney Adrian Roe. ``It's really in the court's
hands.''
   ``We're hopeful the court will act promptly, but we have no
guarantees,'' Roe said.
   Ms. Mittleman said the court could order a hearing on the case
and that there was no guarantee that the court would immediately
issue an order freeing Morgan.
   A three-judge panel heard arguments in the case last year, and
the full court held a rehearing last Wednesday.
   Foretich and Ms. Mittleman both stressed that the bill does not
require Ms. Morgan to produce the girl.
   Foretich said he would be ``delighted'' to have his former wife
released, if the federal government helped him find their daughter.
   ``But until they're willing to do that, I don't see where I have
any choice but to concern myself with the violation of my rights
and those of my daughter,'' he added.
   D.C. Corrections Department spokeswoman Patricia Wheeler said
jail officials required a court order to release Morgan.
   Ms. Mittleman said Foretich has asked Bush to direct the
attorney general to either appoint a special prosecutor or tell the
FBI to help find the child.
   Foretich has offered a $5,000 reward to anyone who could provide
information on Hilary's whereabouts.
   Presidential spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said Bush signed the
bill ``out of compassion for her plight'' after members of
Congress, also concerned about her case, passed legislation to free
Morgan.
   The measure signed by Bush, which will be applied retroactively
to Morgan's case, sets a one-year limit on civil contempt jailings
in child custody cases in the District of Columbia. The law is to
expire after 18 months.

   An 18-year-old was charged today with
murder and arson in the highway construction site explosion that
killed six Kansas City firefighters last Nov. 29.
   Bryan Sheppard of Kansas City was indicted Friday by a Jackson
County grand jury. He was charged with knowingly burning something
and with six counts of felony murder because of the deaths
resulting from the fire.
   Sheppard, being held in jail on unrelated charges, could face up
to life in prison if convicted of felony murder.
   The firefighters were responding to an early morning fire at the
construction site in southern Kansas City when a trailer storing
about 30,000 pounds of explosive blew up, killed them instantly.
About half an hour later, a second trailer, holding about 15,000
pounds of explosives, also detonated.
   The explosions broke windows up to 10 miles away and were heard
up to 40 miles away. The blasts left two craters 30 to 40 feet wide
and 6 to 7 feet deep.
   According to police records filed in court today, an anonymous
caller reported seeing Sheppard and another man, 19, run into the
19-year-old's residence shortly after the fire and explosions.
   The 19-year-old has not been charged.
   Police records also cited statements from two witnesses who were
in jail with Sheppard who reported hearing Sheppard say started the
fire to create a diversion after he and two other people went to
the construction site to steal explosives.
   Another witness said he was present when Sheppard bragged about
being involved in the explosions but said he had not meant for
anyone to get hurt.
   Sheppard pleaded guilty in March to an unrelated theft, and was
placed on probation for a year. In July, he was sentenced to 90
days in jail for violating terms of his probation.

<TEXT>
   President Bush, challenging the Soviet
Union to ``rid the earth of this scourge'' of chemical weapons,
said today the United States will destroy more than 80 percent of
its stockpiles if Moscow reduces its arsenals to an equal level.
   ``The world has lived too long in a shadow of chemical
warfare,'' Bush told the United Nations General Assembly, seeking
to spur a 40-nation treaty conference aimed at banning the weapons
entirely.
   While the chemical weapons plan was the centerpiece of his
remarks, Bush also paid tribute to the Soviet Union for removing
``a number of obstacles'' on treaties reducing long-range nuclear
weapons as well as troops and tanks in Europe.
   Bush took note of the array of agreements reached during a
weekend of talks between Secretary of State James A. Baker III and
Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze, as well as a
decision to hold a summit meeting with Soviet President Mikhail S.
Gorbachev by early next summer.
   ``Each of these achievements is important in its own right, but
they are more important still as signs of a new attitude that
prevails between the U.S. and U.S.S.R.,'' he said. ``Serious
differences remain _ we know that _ but the willingness to deal
constructively and candidly with those differences is news that we,
and indeed the world, must welcome.''
   Bush's nationally televised speech marked his first to the
United Nations General Assembly as president. Bush served as U.N.
ambassador in the early 1970s, and told his audience it was a
``homecoming for both Barbara and me.''
   His speech was interrupted twice by applause, once when he
called for the elimination of chemical weapons, and again when he
touched on the progress of the weekend superpower talks.
   Shevardnadze, who will address the world body Tuesday, called
Bush's speech ``a constructive statement in the spirit of the
times, in the spirit of the tasks that we are facing, that the U.S.
is facing and in a broader context, too.''
   He said the Soviet Union had a ``positive view'' of the chemical
weapons proposals.
   In his remarks, Bush said the world was witnessing a ``rise of
freedom,'' and cited advances in Hungary, Poland, Latin America and
Africa.
   ``Make no mistake. Nothing can stand in the way of freedom's
march,'' the president said.
   ``Today we are witnessing an ideological collapse, the demise of
the totalitarian idea of the omniscient, all-powerful state,'' he
said.
   Yet, he cautioned, ``We have not entered an era of perpetual
peace.'' He said regimes throughout the world were emerging ``armed
with old and unappeasable animosities and modern weapons of mass
destruction.
   Bush said regional conflicts ``may well threaten world peace as
never before.''
   His offer to slash U.S. chemical weapon stockpiles was both a
challenge to the Soviet Union to follow his lead and an invitation
to the 38 other nations whose negotiations in Geneva to ban the
weapons are moving at a snail's pace.
   ``Let us act together, beginning today, to rid the earth of this
scourge,'' he said.
   Baker had given Shevardnadze advance word of the chemical
weapons proposal during their talks in Jackson Hole, Wyo. The two
agreed on a two-stage U.S.-Soviet program to exchange information
about their chemical weapons and to inspect each other's plants and
arsenals.
   Only the United States and the Soviet Union admit to having
posion gas. But Bush said more than 20 nations possess chemical
weapons or the capability to produce them.
   ``And these horrible weapons are now finding their way into
regional conflicts,'' he said. ``This is unacceptable.''
   He referred to U.S. accusations that Iraq and Iran both used
poison gas in the Persian Gulf war.
   ``For the sake of mankind, we must halt and reverse this
threat.''
   Bush outlined a series of steps the United States was willing to
take ``to rid the world of these truly terrible weapons'' and move
toward an international ban to take effect 10 years after an
agreement was signed.
   The three major elements of Bush's plan:
   _While working to complete a global agreement, the United States
will eliminate more than 80 percent of its stockpile ``if the
Soviet Union joins us in cutting chemical weapons to an equal
level, and we agree on the conditions, including inspections, under
which stockpiles are destroyed,'' Bush said.
   _Once an international treaty is signed, the United States will
destroy more than 98 percent of its current chemical weapons
stockpile over an eight-year period, provided the Soviet Union
joins the ban. ``I think they will,'' he said.
   _The remaining 2 percent would be destroyed over the next two
years after all countries capable of producing chemical weapons
become partners to the agreement.
   The Soviets acknowledge having 50,000 tons of chemical weapons;
some analysts think they may have more. The United States has never
publicly released figures on its own arsenal; analysts estimate it
totals 30,000 tons.
   Bush said it would be difficult to monitor a total ban on
chemical weapons but said recent research, as well as information
obtained in recent arms control discussions ``makes me believe we
can achieve the level of verification that gives us confidence to
go forward with the ban.''
   On other fronts, Bush called for international cooperation on
illegal drugs, the environment and terrorism.
   He said narcotics were ``a menace to social order and a source
of human misery whereever they gain a foothold. The nations who
suffer this scourge must join forces in the fight. And we are.''
   Urging a united stand on terrorism, Bush said, ``Hostage taking
and the terror of random violence are methods that cannot win the
world's approval.''
   Bush urged the General Assembly to condemn the murder of Marine
Lt. Col. William R. Higgins, who was taken hostage in Lebanon while
on a U.N. peacekeeping mission last year. His captors said they
hanged him this summer in retaliation for Israel's abduction of a
Moslem cleric.
   The president said Higgins was a ``soldier of peace'' and called
on those resposible for his death to ``have the decency'' to return
his body.
   ``And let us all right now _ right here _ rededicate ourselves
and our nations to the cause that Col. Higgins served so
selflessly.''
   Bush had a full day of activities at the United Nations. Among
them: separate meetings with U.N. Secretary General Javier Perez de
Cuellar, Brazil's President Jose Sarney, Israeli Finance Minister
Shimon Peres, Guatemalan President Vinicio Cerezo, Venezuelan
President Carlos Andres Perez and Bolivian President Jaime Paz
Zamora.
   Bush also scheduled a lunch for NATO allies, and with his wife
Barbara, a visit to the Metropolitan Museum of Art for a diplomatic
reception and dinner.
   In their weekend meetings, Baker and Shevardnadze signed an
agreement to exchange data on chemical weapons by the end of the
year and allow visits by inspectors of the other side to stockpiles
and plants by June 30. In a second phase, there would be more
intensive on-site inspections of the submitted data.
   They also reached agreement on the broad principles for
verifying limits on strategic forces and nuclear tests.
   In a major development, the Soviets said they would drop their
demand that the United States abandon work on its Star Wars missile
defense program before concluding a treaty curbing long-range
missiles, bombers and submarines.

   Zsa Zsa Gabor began the third week
of her cop-slapping trial today with an out-of-court retraction of
earlier comments about homosexuals and insisted she has the utmost
respect for gay people.
   As the volatile Hungarian actress arrived at Municipal Court,
she told reporters she was distressed by angry letters she has
received from the gay community.
   Two weeks ago she commented that she was afraid of going to jail
for slapping Officer Paul Kramer because there are lesbians in
there.
   ``I have nothing against gays or lesbians. I have lots of gay
`boys' working for me,'' Miss Gabor said. ``I got letter from the
lesbians and gay association.
   ``They are going to boycott me because I said there are lesbians
in jail. How do I know who's in jail? Imagine a women's jail. There
must be lesbians. ... Maybe I should become a lesbian. What do I
know? I like men.''
   Asked if she was retracting her earlier comment, Miss Gabor said
yes.
   Miss Gabor is under court order not to discuss the case itself.
   Defense lawyer William Graysen expects to wrap up Miss Gabor's
self-defense case today and the jury could begin deliberating by
Tuesday.
   She could receive up to 18 months in jail sentence if convicted
of misdemeanor battery on a police officer, disobeying an officer's
orders, driving with an expired license and having an open
container of alcohol (a flask of whiskey in the glove compartment)
in her car.
   Miss Gabor doesn't deny slapping Kramer, but claims she lashed
out in self-defense because the officer cursed her and dragged her
from her Rolls-Royce on June 14 when he spotted expired
registration tags on the car.

resumed some official duties on Monday, six weeks after he
underwent gallbladder surgery, the state-run news agency ADN said.
   Honecker, 77, met with the new ambassadors of Zimbabwe and
Turkey, ADN said.
   After his mid-August surgery, some West German media reports
said Honecker's recovery was slow and that his condition may be
more serious than indicated by East German officials. He had not
been seen in public since Aug. 14.
   East German Communist Party sources, speaking on condition of
anonymity, said Honecker's condition had stabilized enough in
recent days to allow him to resume some work.
   The East Berlin sources said Honecker was expected to fully
resume his duties by Oct. 7, when the East German state will mark
its 40th anniversary. Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev is
expected in East Berlin for the ceremonies.

   A tree planted by President Bush in
Riverfront Park last week has been vandalized and is probably
unsalvageable, officials said.
   A park worker Sunday morning found the 12-foot American elm
sapling, grown from seeds taken from a tree on the White House
lawn, uprooted near where it had been planted, Sgt. Jim Nicks said.
   ``We have no suspects and we have no idea why it happened,'' he
said.
   Taylor Bressler, park superintendent, said after an inspection
this morning that the tree was broken and uprooted. ``All three
branches have been ground off,'' he said. ``It didn't look real
hot, to tell you the truth.''
   A park horticulturalist was going to see whether the tree's
limbs could be grafted, but his ``gut feeling'' was the tree could
not be repaired, Bressler said.
   The elm was not marked as the tree Bush had planted, because a
plaque he brought along had not yet been installed, officials said.
But it was the only recently planted tree in the park.
   Bush and House Speaker Tom Foley, D-Wash., planted the tree
Tuesday during a ceremony in the park's Lilac Bowl.
   The sapling was grown from seeds taken from a tree planted on
the White House grounds in the 1820s by President John Quincy Adams.
   White House groundskeepers have been asked about getting a
replacement tree, but ``I'm sure that's a limited resource,''
Bressler said.

   Here is the text of President Bush's speech
Monday to the United Nations General Assembly.
   Well, Mr. President, Mr. Secretary General and distinguished
delegates of the United Nations, I am honored to speak to you today
as you open the 44th session of the General Assembly. I would like
to congratulate Joseph Garba of Nigeria, a distinguished diplomat,
on his election as president of this session of the General
Assembly, and I wish him success in his presidency.
   I feel a great personal pleasure on this occasion for this is a
homecoming for both Barbara and me. The memories of my time here in
1971 and 1972 are still with me today; the human moments, the
humorous moments that are part of even the highest undertaking.
   With your permission, let me share one story from one of the
many sessions of the Security Council. I was the permanent
representative of the United States. I was 45 minutes late getting
to the meeting, and all 45 minutes were filled by the first speaker
to take the floor. And when I walked in and took my seat, the
speaker paused with great courtesy and said as follows, ``I welcome
the permanent representative of the United States, and now, for his
benefit, I will start my speech all over again from the beginning.''
   That's a true story and, at that moment, differences of
alliance, ideology didn't matter. The universal groan that went up
around that table from every member present, and then the laughter
that followed, united us all.
   Today I would like to begin by recognizing _ again, a personal
privilege _ the current permanent representatives with whom I
served, Ambassador Dugar Soon Rhen, Ambassador Roberto
Martinez-Ordonez, Ambassador Blaise Rabetafika, Permanent Observer
John Dube. And it's wonderful to look around and see so many
familiar faces; foreign ministers, members of the Secretariat,
delegates and, of course, Mr. Secretary General, you were then the
permanent representative for your country when we served together
under Secretary Abby Farah. You were a permanent representative
back then, too.
   Ambassador de Cuellar was then here, and is now back, and off we
go. And it's an honor to be back with you in this historic hall,
and I apologize if I have forgotten any of you old enough to have
served in 1971 and 1972.
   But the United Nations was established 44 years ago upon the
ashes of war, and amidst great hopes. And the United Nations can do
great things. No, the United Nations is not perfect. It's not a
panacea for the world's problems. But it is a vital forum where the
nations of the world seek to replace conflict with consensus, and
it must remain a forum for peace.

   An East German court Monday convicted a former
Nazi guard of murdering 28 Jewish prisoners at a labor camp in
Poland during World War II and sentenced him to life in prison, the
state-run news agency ADN said.
   Jakob Holz, 79, was found guilty of war crimes and crimes
against humanity for his part in killing the workers at the forced
labor camp in Radom, Poland, ADN said.
   The agency said Holz personally shot 18 of the 28 people.
   ``Witnesses at the trial recognized their one-time tormenter and
testified against him without hesitation,'' and other testimony
submitted in writing to the court also proved his guilt, ADN said.
   ``Despite the testimony that he often took part in torture and
executions, Holz claimed he could not remember taking part in the
crimes he was accused of,'' ADN said.
   The report said Holz had worked as a deputy chief of guards at
the Steyr-Daimler-Puch-AG weapons factory in Radom. It did not say
exactly when the killings occurred.
   Holz was tried in Rostock, on the Baltic coast.

<HEAD>UNITED NATIONS: for peace.</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   The UN is moving closer to that ideal, and it has the support of
the United States of America. In recent years, certainly since my
time here, the war of words that has often echoed in this chamber
is giving way to a new mood. We've seen a welcomed shift from
polemics to peacekeeping. UN Peacekeeping Forces are on-duty right
now, and over the years, more than 700 Peacekeepers have given
their lives in service to the United Nations.
   Today, I want to remember one of those soldiers of peace, an
American on a mission of peace under the United Nations flag; on a
mission, really, for all the world; a man of unquestioned bravery,
unswerving dedication to the United Nations ideal, Lieutenant
Colonel William Richard Higgins. And I call on the General Assembly
to condemn the murder of this soldier of peace, and call on those
responsible to have the decency to return his remains to his family
and let us all right now, right here rededicate ourselves and our
nations to the cause that Colonel Higgins served so selflessly.
   The founders of this historic institution believed that it was
here that the nations of the world might come to agree that law,
not force, shall govern. And the United Nations can play a
fundamental role in the central issue of our time, for today
there's an idea at work around the globe, an idea of undeniable
force. And that idea is freedom.
   Freedom's advance is evident everywhere; Central Europe and
Hungary, where state and society are now in the midst of a movement
towards political pluralism and a free market economy, where the
barrier that once enforced an unnatural division between Hungary
and its neighbors to the west has been torn down. Torn down.
Replaced by a new hope for the future, a new hope in freedom.
   We see freedom at work in Poland where, in deference to the will
of the people, the Communist Party has relinquished its monopoly on
power, and indeed, in the Soviet Union, where the world hears the
voices of people no longer afraid to speak out or to assert the
right to rule themselves.
   But freedom's march is not confined to a single continent or to
the developed world alone. We see the rise of freedom in Latin
America, where one by one dictatorships are giving way to
democracy. We see it on the continent of Africa, where more and
more nations see in the system of free enterprise salvation for
economies crippled by excessive state control. East and west, north
and south, on every continent, we can see the outlines of a new
world of freedom.
   Of course, freedom's work remains unfinished. The trend we see
is not yet universal. Some regimes still stand against the tide.
Some rulers still deny the right of the people to govern
themselves. But now, the power of prejudice and despotism is
challenged. Never before have these regimes stood so isolated and
alone, so out of step with the steady advance of freedom. Today we
are witnessing an ideological collapse, the demise of the
totalitarian idea of the omniscient, all-powerful state.

<HEAD>UNITED NATIONS: all-powerful state.</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   There are many reasons for this collapse, but in the end, one
fact alone explains what we see today, advocates of the
totalitarian idea, so it's triumph written in the laws of history.
They failed to see the love of freedom that was written in the
human heart.
   Two hundred years ago today, the United States _ our Congress _
proposed the Bill of Rights, fundamental freedoms belonging to
every individual, rights no government can deny. Those same rights
have been recognized in this Congress of Nations, in the words of
the universal Declaration of Human Rights, a common standard of
achievement for all peoples and all nations.
   From where we stand, on the threshold of this new world of
freedom, the trend is clear enough. If, for those who write the
history of our times, the 20th century is remembered as the century
of the state, the 21st century must be an era of emancipation, the
age of the individual.
   Make no mistake; nothing can stand in the way of freedom's
march. There will come a day when freedom is seen the world over to
be universal birthright _ a universal birthright of every man and
woman, of every race and walk of life. Even under the worst
circumstances, at the darkest of times, freedom has always remained
alive; a distant dream, perhaps, but always alive.
   Today that dream is no longer distant. For the first time, for
millions around the world, a new world of freedom is within reach.
Today is freedom's moment. You see, the possibility now exists for
the creation of a true community of nations, built on shared
interests and ideals, a true community, a world where free
governments and free markets meet the rising desire of the people
to control their own destiny, to live in dignity and to exercise
freely their fundamental human rights.
   It is time that we work together to deliver that destiny into
the hands of men and women everywhere. Our challenge is to
strengthen the foundations of freedom, encourage its advance, and
face our most urgent challenges, the global challenges of the 21st
century _ economic, health, environmental well-being, the great
questions of war and peace.
   First, global economic growth. During this decade, a number of
developing nations have moved into the ranks of the world's most
advanced economies, all of them, each and every one, powered by the
engine of free enterprise. In the decade ahead, others can join
their ranks. But for many nations, barriers stand in the way.
   In the case of some countries, these are obstacles of their own
making _ unneeded restrictions and regulations that act as dead
weights on their own economies and obstacles to foreign trade. But
other barriers to growth exist, and those too require effective
action.
   Too many developing countries struggle today under a burden of
debt that makes growth all but impossible. The nations of the world
deserve better opportunity to achieve a measure of control over
their own economic fate and build better lives for their own
people. The approach the U.S. has put forward, the Brady Plan, will
help these nations reduce that debt, and at the same time encourage
the free market reforms that will fuel economic growth.
   In just two days, I will be speaking to the International
Monetary Fund and the World Bank, and I'll discuss there in more
detail the steps that our nations can take in dealing with the debt
problem. But I can say now the new world of freedom is not a world
where a few nations live in comfort while others live in want. The
power of commerce is a force for progress. Open markets are the key
to continued growth in the developing world.
   Today, the United States buys over one-half of the manufactured
exports that all developing nations combined sell to the
industrialized world. It's time for the other advanced economies to
follow suit, to create expanded opportunities for trade. I believe
we'll learn, in the century ahead, that many nations of the world
have barely begun to tap their true potential for development. The
free market and its fruits are not the special preserve of a few;
they are a harvest that everyone can share.

   Brendan Gill, who has been writing for

   ``There's been a change in ownership, but that hasn't affected
the editorial side as far as I can see,'' he said in an interview

   ``It's a less pleasing place to have one's work appear because
it has a more commercial look than it used to, with the cluster
advertising and the fluttering snowflakes of renewal forms falling

relentless pursuit of clean writing.

<HEAD>Scientists Make Final Quest for Rembrandt's Bones</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROLAND DE LIGNY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>AMSTERDAM, Netherlands (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   In a final bid to recover the
bones of one of this city's greatest sons, scientists are peeling
away thin layers of soil on the spot where they hope Rembrandt van
Rijn was buried 300 years ago.
   The grave of the painter's only son, Titus, surfaced during
restoration work in Amsterdam's 17th-century Westerkerk church, and
students of Rembrandt's life believe the best-known of Dutch
masters might have been interred next to Titus.
   ``We know that Rembrandt was buried in the Westerkerk, but the
location of his remains is unknown because he had no money for a
tombstone,'' Willem van Stigt, the architect supervising the
restoration project, said in a graveside interview Monday.
   ``Titus' grave seems as logical a place as any other,'' van
Stigt said. Rembrandt survived his son by one year, dying in 1669
at the age of 63.
   ``It would be nice if we would know for certain where
Rembrandt's grave is located _ so many tourists are asking for
it,'' added Philip Korthals Altes, an Amsterdam stockbroker and the
chairman of the church's fund-raising committee.
   Currently, only a marble plaque on the Westerkerk's north wall
commemorates Rembrandt.
   Best-known for his monumental ``Night Watch,'' on display in the
Rijkmuseum here, Rembrandt was a prolific painter whose innovative
use of light made him one of the outstanding representatives of the
17th-century Dutch school.
   When the wooden floor was removed from the Westerkerk's nave
several weeks ago, Titus' grave became accessible to scientists of
the Anatomy Institute of Leiden University, 25 miles away.
   After a week of digging, the first brownish skeleton was found
Monday at a depth of 6 feet, 6 inches.
   ``It definitely is not Rembrandt,'' said Van Stigt, who noted
that in the 200 years following the opening of the church in 1631,
people were buried in layers.
   ``It is uncertain whether we'll ever find Titus, let alone his
father,'' said Harmen Beukers, a professor of medical history in
Leiden who leads the research team. Graves, especially those inside
churches, were regularly emptied to make room for new bodies.
   Down in the 6-foot, 8-inch-deep pit on Monday, three archeology
students carefully handled the skeleton's bones, which were to be
brought to Leiden for further study.
   But van Stigt said digging must be finished by Thursday, when
the construction crews will close the grave and start laying a
church-wide concrete floor, putting a final lid on the graves
beneath it.
   ``We're digging in a hurry, but we'll do the examination of the
bones at a slower pace,'' Beukers told The Associated Press in a
telephone interview. He said it would take months, if not years, to
establish the identities of the skeletons.
   After determining the skeletons' age and sex, their particulars
will be compared with the entries in the Westerkerk's burial books,
Beukers said. Officials were unsure where the bones would be taken
after they are studied.
   If there's a clear indication that one of the skeletons might be
Rembrandt's, other tests will be done, Beukers said. ``We might
want to determine the lead content of the bones, for 17th-century
paint contained lots of lead,'' he said.
   But it's unlikely that when the Westerkerk reopens in all its
former glory next May, the painter's grave will be one of the
building's prominent features.
   ``Personally, I think that the chance that he's lying there is
minimal,'' Beukers said.

   PTL's chief builder testified today that
he took an offer from evangelist Jerry Falwell to PTL founder Jim
Bakker that would give Bakker a $300,000 salary ``if he kept his
mouth shut.''
   Builder Roe Messner, testifying for the defense at Bakker's
fraud trial, also said a top Bakker aide claimed to be ``acting on
my own'' in offering hush money to Jessica Hahn.
   A spokesman for Falwell disputed the witness' account, saying
that what Messner described as an offer from Falwell to Bakker was
really a request from Bakker to Falwell.
   Falwell, whose television ministry is based in Lynchburg, Va.,
and who started the defunct Moral Majority, took over PTL
temporarily in 1987 after Bakker resigned following disclosure of
the sex-and-money scandal involving Ms. Hahn.
   Under questioning from defense attorneys, Messner said that
after Bakker left the ministry and Falwell took it over, Falwell
sent him to Palm Springs, Calif., to make Bakker an offer that
included $300,000 salary, a maid, a security guard for a year,
health insurance and phone expenses.
   Bakker's wife, Tammy, wrote the offer down and Bakker wrote at
the bottom of the piece of paper: ``I'm not making any demands on
PTL. I'm not asking for anything.'' Bakker's statement was
apparently in reference to whether he would return to PTL.
   Bakker is accused of defrauding followers who sent PTL more than
$158 million and of misusing more than $3.7 million in ministry
money for his own benefit. He faces up to 120 years in prison and
more than $5 million in fines if convicted on all charges: 15
counts of wire fraud, eight counts of mail fraud and one count of
conspiring to commit mail and wire fraud.
   Messner testified about the $265,000 hush money payment to Ms.
Hahn, saying Richard Dortch, PTL's executive vice president, asked
him to do a favor on Feb. 21, 1985.
   Dortch had legal papers with him and told Messner that if he
didn't pay a woman from New York $265,000 then she would go to The
Charlotte Observer with allegations that Bakker raped her. Messner
said Dortch came to him for help because Dortch knew he would keep
it confidential.
   Five days later, Messner said, he wired the $265,000 to an
account number in California that was given to him by Dortch.
   Messner said he asked Dortch if Bakker knew about the payment.
He said Dortch replied: ``No, I'm acting on my own.'' Dortch said
he had the authority to spend the $265,000 because he was PTL's
chief executive officer, he said.
   Messner said Dortch asked him to make up a bogus invoice for
work never done, which he refused to do.
   Messner said he agreed to make the payment in part because the
Assemblies of God was named as the potential party in Ms. Hahn's
proposed lawsuit. ``I didn't think the church ought to be dragged
into this incident,'' Messner said.
   Messner said he didn't know Ms. Hahn's name and never heard
anything else about the situation until Bakker's resignation in
March 1987.
   Mark DeMoss, a Falwell spokesman, said Falwell sent Messner to
meet with the Bakkers not long after Bakker resigned, but did not
take any specific offer. Instead, DeMoss said, Messner returned
from the meeting with a hand-written list on Mrs. Bakker's
stationery of what the Bakkers wanted from PTL.
   Moss said the list included Bakker's $300,000 annual salary for
life, Mrs. Bakker's $100,000 annual salary for life, all rights to
books and records, secretary and maid service for a year, the South
Carolina lakefront house and attorneys' fees.
   ``I would like to think Roe just forgot the sequence of
events,'' DeMoss said.

<HEAD>UNITED NATIONS: can share.</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Beyond the challenge of global growth lies another issue of
global magnitude: the environment. No line drawn on a map can stop
the advance of pollution. Threats to our environment have become
international problems.
   We must develop an international approach to urgent
environmental issues, one that seeks common solutions to common
problems. The United Nations is already at work on the question of
global warming and the effort to prevent oil spills and other
disasters from fouling our seas and the air we breathe.
   And I will tell you now, the United States will do its part. We
have committed ourselves to the worldwide phase-out of all
chlorofluorocarbons by the year 2000.
   We have proposed amending our own Clean Air Act to ensure clean
air for our citizens within a single generation. We've banned the
import of ivory to protect the elephant and rhinoceros from the
human predators who exterminate them for profit.
   And we've begun to explore ways to work with other nations, with
the major industrialized democracies, and in Poland and in Hungary,
to make common cause for the sake of our environment.
   The environment belongs to all of us.
   In this new world of freedom, the world citizens must enjoy this
common trust for generations to come. Global economic growth, the
stewardship of our planet, both are critical issues.
   But, as always, questions of war and peace must be paramount to
the United Nations. We must move forward to limit and eliminate
weapons of mass destruction.
   Five years ago at the United Nations conference on disarmament
in Geneva, I presented a United States draft treaty outlawing
chemical weapons. Since then, progress has been made, but time is
running out.
   The threat is growing. More than 20 nations now possess chemical
weapons or the capability to produce them. And these horrible
weapons are now finding their way into regional conflicts. This is
simply unacceptable.
   For the sake of mankind, we must halt and reverse this threat.
   Today, I want to announce steps that the United States is ready
to take, steps to rid the world of these truly terrible weapons,
towards a treaty that will ban, elimate all chemical weapons from
the earth 10 years from the day it is signed.
   This initiative contains three major elements.
   First, in the first eight years of a chemical weapons treaty,
the U.S. is ready to destroy nearly all, 98 percent, of our
chemical weapons stockpile, provided the Soviet Union joins the
ban. And I think they will.
   Second, we are ready to destroy all of our chemical weapons, 100
percent, every one, within 10 years, once all nations capable of
building chemical weapons sign that total ban treaty.
   And, third, the United States is ready to begin now. We will
eliminate more than 80 percent of our stockpile even as we work to
complete a treaty if the Soviet Union joins us in cutting chemical
weapons to an equal level and we agree on the conditions, including
inspections, under which stockpiles are destroyed.
   We know that monitoring a total ban on chemical weapons will be
a challenge, but the knowledge we've gained from our recent arms
control experience and our acclerating research in this area makes
me believe that we can achieve the level of verification that gives
us confidence to go forward with the ban.
   The world has lived too long in the shadow of chemical warfare.
So, let us act together, beginning today, to rid the earth of this
scourge.
   We are serious about achieving conventional arms reductions as
well.And that's why we tabled new proposals just last Thursday at
the Conventional Forces in Europe negotiations in Vienna _
proposals that demonstrate our commitment to act rapidly to ease
military tensions in Europe and move the nations of that continent
one step closer to their common destiny _ a Europe whole and free.
   And the United States is convinced that open and innovative
measures can move disarmament forward and also ease international
tensions.
   And that's the idea behind the ``open skies'' proposal, about
which the Soviets have now expressed a positive attitude. It's the
idea behind the ``open lands'' proposal permitting for the first
time ever free travel for all Soviet and American diplomats
throughout each other's country.
   Openness is the enemy of mistrust and every step towards a more
open world is a step toward the new world we seek.
   And let me make this comment on our meetings with the
distinguished foreign minister of the Soviet Union, Mr.
Shevardnadze, over the past few days. I am very pleased by the
progress made.
   The Soviet Union removed a number of obstacles to progress on
conventional and strategic arms reductions. We reached agreements
in principle on issues from verification to nuclear testing.
   And, of course, we agreed to a summit in the spring or early
summer of 1990. And I look forward to meeting Mr. Gorbachev there.
Each of these achievements is important in its own right. But they
are more important still as signs of a new attitude that prevails
between the United States and the USSR.
   Serious differences remain; we know that. But the willingness to
deal constructively and candidly with those differences is news
that we and, indeed, the world must welcome.
   We have not entered into an era of perpetual peace. The threats
to peace that nations face may today be changing, but they've not
vanished.
   In fact, in a number of regions around the world, a dangerous
combination is now emerging: regimes armed with old and
unappeasable animosities and modern weapons of mass destruction.
   This development will raise the stakes whenever war breaks out.
Regional conflict may well threaten world peace as never before.
The challenge of preserving peace is a personal one for all of you,
right here in this hall.
   Mr. secretary general, with great respect, you have made it your
own. The United Nations can be a mediator, a forum where parties in
conflict come in search of peaceful solutions.
   For the sake of peace, the U.N. must redouble its support for
the peace efforts now underway in regions of conflict all over the
world. And let me assure you the United States is determined to
take an active role in settling regional conflicts.

<HEAD>UNITED NATIONS: regional conflicts.</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Sometimes our role in regional disputes is and will be highly
public, and sometimes, like many of you, we work quietly behind the
scenes, but always we are working for positive change and lasting
peace.
   Our world faces other, less conventional threats, no less
dangerous to international peace and stability.
   Illegal drugs are a menace to social order and a source of human
misery wherever they gain a foothold. The nations who suffer this
scourge must join forces in the fight, and we are.
   And let me salute the commitment and extraordinary courage of
one country in particular, Colombia, where we are working with the
people and their president, Virgilio Barco, to put the drug cartels
out of business, bring the drug lords to justice.
   And finally, we must join forces to combat the threat of
terrorism. Every nation and the United Nations must send the
outlaws of the world a clear message: Hostage-taking and the terror
of random violence are a message that cannot win the world's
approval.
   Terrorism of any kind is repugnant to all values that a
civilized world holds in common. And make no mistake, terrorism is
a means that no end, no matter how just that end, can sanctify.
   Whatever the challenge, freedom greatly raises the chances of
our success. Freedom's moment is a time for hope for all of the
world, because freedom, once set in motion, takes on a momentum of
its own.
   As I said the day I assumed the presidency of our country, we
don't have to talk late into the night about which form of
government is better, we know that free government, democracy, is
best.
   And I believe that it is the hard-won truth of our time, the
unassailable fact that still stands at the end of a century of
great struggle, of human suffering. And this is true, not because
all our differences must give way to democracy, but because
democracy makes room for all our differences. In democracy,
diversity finds its common home.
   At the very heart of the democratic ideal is respect for freedom
of belief, freedom of thought and action in all its diversity, for
human rights.
   The world has experienced enough of the ideologies that have
promised to remake man in some new and better image. We've seen the
colossal tragedies and dashed hopes. We know now that freedom and
democracy hold the answers. What men and nations want is the
freedom to live by their own lights and a chance to prosper in
peace.
   When I began today, I spoke to you about peacekeeping. I want to
speak to you now about peace making. We must bring peace to the
people who have never known its blessings.
   There's a painting that hangs on the wall of my office in the
White House, and it pictures President Abraham Lincoln and his
generals meeting near the end of a war that remains the bloodiest
in the history of my country.
   Outside, at that moment, a battle rages in this picture, and yet
what we see in the distance is a rainbow, a symbol of hope of the
passing of the storm. That painting is called The Peacemakers.
   For me, it is a constant reminder that our struggle, the
struggle for peace, is a struggle blessed by hope.
   I do remember sitting in this hall. I remember the mutual
respect among all of us proudly serving as representatives. Yes, I
remember the almost endless speeches _ and I don't want this to be
one of them _ the Security Council sessions, the receptions, those
long receiving lines, the formal meetings of this assembly and the
informal discussions in the delegates' lounge over here.
   And I remember something more _ something beyond the frantic
pace and sometimes frustrating experiences of daily life here, the
heartbeat of the United Nations, the quiet conviction that we could
make the world more peaceful, more free.
   What we sought then, all of us, now lies within our reach. I ask
each of you here in this hall, can we not bring a unity of purpose
to the United Nations? Can we not make this new world of freedom
the common destiny we seek? I believe we can. I know we must.
   My solemn wish today is that here among the United Nations that
spirit will take hold and that all men, and all nations will make
freedom's moment their own.
   Thank you, God bless you, and may God bless the work of the
United Nations. Thank you very much.

   Poland's fledgling non-communist government
needs such basic things as telephones and copy machines, Sen. Pete
V. Domenici said Monday, urging Congress and private American
industry to help.
   ``The parliament's lack of even the most basic resources is
mind-boggling,'' the New Mexico Republican said at a news
conference. ``They don't have functioning phones, computers, office
equipment or even copying machines.
   ``It is clear that a simple gift of a helping hand in these
seemingly minor matters is a necessary first step in helping Poland
to have a properly functioning body of government.''
   Domenici, who visited Poland last week as head of a delegation
of present and former legislators, said the cost of such a gesture
would be small but would represent an important ``first gift of
democracy.''
   He said he would urge the Senate and House leadership to send a
team of congressional experts to Warsaw ``to see what they have and
what they need and report back.''
   Joining Domenici on the trip to Poland were former Vice
President Walter Mondale; former Sen. Thomas Eagleton, D-Mo.;
former Senate Republican Leader Howard Baker of Tennessee; and
former Rep. Jim Jones, D-Okla.

<HEAD>Opponents To Seek Referendum On Holiday</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Opponents of a holiday to honor murdered civil
rights leader Martin Luther King Jr. filed papers with the
secretary of state's office today to force a statewide vote on the
newly enacted law.
   The opponents have until Dec. 21 to gather at least 43,350 voter
signatures that would force a statewide vote at the general
election in November 1990.
   If they gather the needed signatures, the law would be suspended
pending results of the vote.
   Today's filing comes on the first business day since Democratic
Gov. Rose Mofford signed a bill to replace the state's paid
Columbus Day holiday with a King holiday.
   The group filing today is led by Julian Sanders, a conservative
activist who opposes any holiday honoring King because he claims
the civil rights leader had links to Communist groups.
   A second group, made up largely of Italians, has also said it
plans to seek a ballot vote on the issue, but only because it wants
the Columbus Day holiday preserved and not out of any hostility
toward King. Christopher Columbus was born in Italy.
   If both groups agree to use the same set of petitions to gather
signatures, they can combine forces despite different reasons for
seeking the vote.
   The lack of a paid King holiday had triggered convention and
tourism boycotts of the state that cost it an estimated $200
million in business.
   Business executives also claimed it was threatening to derail
the Phoenix area's bid for a 1993 National Football League Super
Bowl.

<TEXT>
   An era ended Monday with the last
NASA launch of an unmanned rocket from this spaceport, where
responsibility for sending payloads into orbit is being turned over
to private industry after 400 liftoffs in 31 years.
   An Atlas-Centaur vaulted skyward at 4:56 a.m. with a $125
million communications satellite to link military commands with
land, sea and air forces and for use by the president in times of
crisis.
   For now on, when NASA needs an unmanned rocket, it will have to
buy launch services from McDonnell Douglas, General Dynamics and
Martin Marietta.
   The space agency will continue to launch manned space shuttles
from Cape Canaveral, where NASA got its start and where it has
launched nearly all of its rockets.
   The National Aeronautics and Space Administration has one
unmanned rocket left for launch, but it will carry its payload, a
scientific satellite, from Vandenberg Air Force Base in California.
The launch is scheduled for November.
   So far, the space agency has seven contracts for private
launches. The first, of a scientific satellite, is scheduled for
June from one of four launch pads turned over to companies.
   ``It's always sad to see the end of an era,'' said James L.
Womack, NASA director of expendable launch vehicles.
   ``There's a certain element of sadness, but the things we have
done have been fabulous,'' said Joseph Mahon, the agency's
assistant administrator for space flight.
   Monday's unmanned launch was the 448th for NASA, dating from a
Thor Able that lifted off Oct. 11, 1958, hoisting the Pioneer 1
probe toward a flyby of the moon. It failed, as did several other
early launches. But the agency's overall success rate is better
than 90 percent.
   ``We have had a successful mission today; the satellite is now
being tracked by spacecraft controllers after a flawless ride
aboard its Atlas-Centaur rocket,'' said launch commentator Lisa
Malone.
   The agency stopped buying Atlas-Centaur, Delta and other rockets
early in the 1980s, opting to launch payloads from the shuttle once
it exhausted its backlog of space boosters.
   Officials admitted after the Challenger exploded in 1986 that it
was a mistake to rely on only one launch vehicle. Following that
accident, then-President Reagan directed NASA to get out of the
business of launching commercial payloads and encouraged government
support of private companies that wanted to provide launch services.
   Among NASA's unmanned rocket achievements are:
   The Mariner, Viking, Pioneer and Voyager missions to the
planets; 42 weather satellites; the Ranger, Surveyor and Lunar
Orbiter probes that scouted the moon in advance of American
astronaut landings there; 94 communications satellites; scores of
scientific payloads, and dozens of unmanned test launches for the
Mercury, Gemini and Apollo man-in-space projects.
   The Atlas-Centaur, which made its 68th appearance Monday, and
the Delta, with 184 liftoffs, have been the workhorses of NASA's
fleet. Both have a success rate of more than 95 percent.

<HEAD>BBC Investigation Says Lockerbie Was Avoidable</HEAD>

<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A British television inquiry into the Pam Am
Flight 103 disaster said Monday that West Germany committed major
blunders, including releasing the probable bomb-maker after a raid
on a Palestinian group last year.
   However, the chief Scottish investigator into the bombing of the
plane over Lockerbie, Scotland, last Dec. 21 said on the program:
``We are still on course to being able to put together a case that
will reveal who was responsible.''
   The British Broadcasting Corp.'s current affairs program
``Panorama'' reported that investigators are convinced the
Syrian-backed Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine-General
Command _ long the prime suspect _ masterminded the attack. The
group's leader has denied involvement.
   All 259 people aboard Flight 103 from Frankfurt to New York via
London were killed along with 11 people on the ground in Lockerbie.
   Scottish investigator Lord Fraser, speaking on the program
titled ``Lockerbie: An Avoidable Tragedy,'' said a West German
police raid in October 1988 and the discovery in April of three
bombs similar to the radio cassette bomb on Flight 103 may be
linked to the Lockerbie disaster.
   ``There are clearly points of similarity that have to checked
out and may indeed point to more than just a loose connection but a
firm link,'' said Fraser.
   West German authorities arrested 16 men in the October raid on
an apartment being used by the Popular Front but released 14 of
them, despite finding a radio cassette bomb, detonators and Semtex
plastic explosives.
   Those released included a Jordanian, Marwan Khreesat.
``Panorama'' said Khreesat is a known bomb-maker and widely
believed by British and U.S. investigators to have made the
Lockerbie bomb and several others.
   ``There were major blunders by the West Germans ... (who) let
the group's bomb-maker go in very strange circumstances,'' said
reporter Gavin Hewitt.
   ``They took until April to find all the bombs he had made,
including ones that could have been used to blow up commercial
airliners. And they freed key members of the PFLP-GC, who were
capable of regrouping their network,'' he said.
   One of the men still held _ on bombing charges unconnected with
Flight 103 _ is Hafez Kassem Dalkamoni, the top aide to Popular
Front leader Ahmed Jibril.
   Jibril has denied his organization had any role in the attack
but said Dalkamoni often built and used the type of bomb that blew
up Flight 103.
   The West German federal prosecutor's office told The Associated
Press Monday it has ``not yet come up with a connection'' between
Dalkamoni and the Lockerbie bombing.
   Hewitt said, without disclosing the source, that he had been
told Khreesat, now in hiding in Jordan, was a double agent working
inside the Popular Front for Jordanian intelligence. He said this
was apparently why the West Germans freed him.
   Asked why Khreesat was released, Hans-Juergen Foerster,
spokesman for the West German prosecutor's office, said, ``He was
released because there was no urgent suspicion of his connection
with a crime.''
   Previous West German denials that there is evidence linking
Dalkamoni and the October raid to Flight 103 have prompted
speculation Bonn is trying to deflect criticism of its security
operation.
   The U.S. Federal Aviation Authority last week fined Pan Am
$630,000 for lapses in security procedures at Frankfurt and
London's Heathrow Airport. But the agency said it was not charging
that any of the breaches contributed to the Lockerbie disaster.
   ``Panorama'' said that in addition to ``blunders'' surrounding
the October raid, West German police also released a key Popular
Front operative, Salah Fiaz Kweiks, last October.
   It said police failed to discover the true identity of Kweiks,
who was carrying a stolen passport in the name of Ramzi Diab, and
failed to fingerprint him. It added that Lockerbie investigators
want to interrogate Kweiks but he has now disappeared.

<TEXT>
   President Bush's aura of confidence as he
stood before the United Nations Monday and proclaimed ``we are
witnessing an ideological collapse'' marked a striking moment in
the modern era of superpower rivalry, following a remarkable series
of Soviet concessions on arms control.
   The American president held out to the General Assembly
delegates hope that they were witnessing ``a new attitude that
prevails between the U.S. and U.S.S.R.''
   The ``ideological collapse'' cited by Bush referred to the range
of serious problems facing Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev,
from his country's faltering economy and rising unrest among ethnic
minorities to the increasingly independent approach of Eastern
European nations.
   Those problems have pushed Soviet leaders toward the concessions
that allowed Bush to speak with a confidence few of his
predecessors could express in their U.N. appearances.
   He offered a sweeping proposal to eliminate U.S. and Soviet
stockpiles of chemical weapons beginning with an 80 percent cut in
the American arsenal if matched by Moscow.
   ``It was a constructive statement in the spirit of the times,''
said Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze, choosing to
ignore Bush's other words assessing a decline of the Soviet sphere
of influence.
   Progress made during the past weekend of meetings between U.S.
and Soviet officials created a sense of momentum and lent strength
to the optimistic tone of Bush's words to a world that has lived
with the threat of nuclear holocaust during 40 years of tension.
   But in his United Nations speech the president also had to
concede the fragility of progress in a world where the
``superpowers'' often are powerless witnesses to terrorism and to
political and economic upheavals.
   ``We have not entered an era of perpetual peace,'' he cautioned,
referring to regimes that were emerging ``armed with old and
unappeasable animosities and modern weapons of mass destruction.''
   High on the agenda at most superpower talks are ``regional
conflicts,'' the limited warfare that the United States and the
Soviet Union once believed each could somehow control. Years of war
between Iran and Iraq and the intractability of the Arab-Israel
conflict lessened the belief in what the strongest nations could
accomplish.
   It was in that context that Bush talked of a danger that such
conflicts ``may well threaten world peace as never before.''
   One measure of the problem facing the world even if the
superpowers truly enter an era of coexistence and cooperation is
the fact that only the United States and Soviet Union admit to
having chemical weapons even though, as the president stated, more
than 20 other nations possess such weapons or the capability to
manufacture them.
   ``And these horrible weapons are now finding their way into
regional conflicts,'' said Bush. ``This is unacceptable.''
   While the dangers throughout the world remain clear, so too was
the progress made over the weekend during the talks between
Shevardnadze and Secretary of State James A. Baker III.
   On issue after issue, the Soviets offered concessions while
receiving little in return.
   Shevardnadze abruptly dropped insistence that any progress on
cutting strategic missile forces be linked to an agreement to limit
space-based defense systems such as the U.S. Strategic Defense
Initiative. Also withdrawn was the Soviet demand that U.S.
sea-launched cruise missiles be part of any treaty to reduce
superpower bombers, missiles and submarines.
   The third big item was the Soviet announcement that the
controversial radar station in Krasnoyarsk in Siberia would be
totally dismantled as had been demanded by the Reagan
administration.
   While making this remarkable series of concessions, Soviet
officials made it clear to their counterparts during their meetings
in Wyoming that Gorbachev is seeking a more stable international
atmosphere while he wrestles with a troubled economy and ethnic
unrest _ problems that Shevardnadze described as awesome.
   For the American president, events in Poland, Hungary, Latin
America and Africa represented ``the rise of freedom. ... Make no
mistake. Nothing can stand in the way of freedom's march.''
   He proclaimed that ``today we are witnessing an ideological
collapse, the demise of the totalitarian idea of the omniscient,
all-powerful state.''

<HEAD>International Atomic Energy Agency Opens Annual Meeting</HEAD>

   The International Atomic Energy Agency
opened its annual meeting on Monday facing political issues, Third
World criticism of Israel and attempts to expel South Africa from
the 113-member organization.
   The issues have surfaced repeatedly at the agency's general
conferences in recent years and figure on the current meeting's
agenda as ``Israeli nuclear capabilities and threat'' and ``South
Africa nuclear capabilities.''
   In his opening address, director-general Hans Blix said
promotion of the peaceful use of nuclear energy is hampered by
excessive public concern about radiation from nuclear power
stations.
   The head of the U.S. delegation, Secretary of Energy James D.
Watkins, warned that regaining public confidence in nuclear power
could not be achieved solely by promoting new designs and promising
enhanced safety.
   ``I am absolutely convinced that the key ... is a positive track
record of operational safety,'' by the owners and operators of
nuclear facilities, Watkins said.
   Last year, the agency's annual conference adopted a resolution
sponsored by Arab states condemning Israel's nuclear policies.
   The resolution denounced ``Israel's refusal to renounce the
possession of nuclear weapons'' and demanded that it place its
nuclear facilities under agency control.
   The conference also will discuss a resolution supported by
African nations to suspend South Africa's membership rights.
Pretoria has not sent a delegation to the general conference since
1979 when its credentials were not accepted for the meeting.
   South Africa's refusal to submit its nuclear facilities to
international inspection and refusal to sign the Nuclear
Non-Proliferation Treaty has prompted repeated calls from
developing countries for its ouster.
   Under the 1969 treaty, which has been signed by 140 governments,
countries pledge to use nuclear energy only for peaceful purposes
and open their nuclear facilities to inspection by experts of the
Vienna-based energy agency.
   Two known atomic powers, France and China, have not signed the
treaty although they submit their peaceful nuclear facilities to
international inspection.
   Some countries thought to possess the potential of producing
nuclear weapons, including India, Pakistan, Israel, Libya as well
as South Africa, have also not signed the treaty.
   Blix said the agency recently received a Soviet proposal on the
establishment of a center for international reasearch at Chernobyl,
the site of a major nuclear power accident in 1986.
   A second Soviet proposal calls for an international project in
waste disposal research at an undisclosed site in the Soviet Union.
   The conference, which ends Friday, is scheduled to approve a
$162.8 million budget and also will be asked to approve $45.5
million for voluntary contributions toward the agency's
technological assistance program.

<TEXT>
   A two-week stream of East Germans
fleeing to West Germany via Hungary surpassed 20,000 on Monday, and
an additional 1,200 hopeful refugees waited in cramped West German
Embassy compounds in Prague and Warsaw.
   East and West German officials spoke several times by telephone
Monday trying to reach a compromise on the embassy occupations,
said Herbert Schmuelling, a West German government spokesman.
   Bonn is hoping to find a quick solution and the talks are in a
``highly sensitive phase,'' Schmuelling told reporters.
   In Stuttgart, the Communist Party chief for the East German city
of Dresden said he thinks changes are needed to stop East Germans
from leaving their homeland.
   Hans Modrow said he agreed with a recent remark by retired East
German intelligence chief Markus Wolf that the East German
government must think over the causes of the East German exodus.
   ``On this point I am of the same opinion as my friend Mischa
Wolf,'' Modrow said on the first day of a four-day visit to West
Germany.
   Modrow, however, refused to say what kind of reforms are needed
in East Germany. ``This is something we have to discuss at home,
not here,'' he said.
   There have been growing signs of disunity within East Germany's
ruling Communist Party over the need to adopt democratic reforms.
The aging leadership under party chief Erich Honecker has resisted
reforms.
   High-level East German Politburo members recently criticized
Modrow for his reform-minded views.
   In West Berlin, West Germany's Minister for Inner-German
Relations said it was up to East German leaders to undertake
reforms that would give East Germans a reason to stay in their
rigidly controlled homeland.
   ``This wave of migration is a clear signal for a change in the
orthodox policies of the East German leadership,'' Dorothee Wilms
told reporters. ``The key for change in the precarious situation in
East Germany lies in East Berlin and not in Bonn.''
   East Germans fleeing to the West say they left because they saw
little chance East Germany's leaders would soon adopt the kinds of
reforms under way in the Soviet Union, Hungary and Poland.
   East Germans in Hungary were allowed to leave their homeland
when Budapest opened its borders on Sept. 11.
   As of early Monday, 20,130 East Germans had fled through Hungary
to West Germany since the channel to the West was opened, West
German border police said.
   The number of East Germans occupying West German embassies in
Prague, Czechoslovakia, and Warsaw, Poland, has nearly reached its
saturation point, West German government sources said.
   About 900 East Germans have sought refuge inside the Prague
compound and 300 at the embassy in Warsaw, the sources said. Their
numbers have grown by 50 to 100 per day over the past week.
   West German news media speculate that a solution may be in the
works, as East Germany wants the refugee crisis cleared up by Oct.
7, when the communist state will celebrate its 40th anniversary.

   Syrian gunners fired more than 80 shells
into the Christian enclave Monday, violating a 2-day-old cease-fire
that has drawn 1 million refugees back to Beirut. An Arab League
mediator urged both sides to honor the truce.
   Police reported no casualties in the barrage that hit pine woods
near the mountain towns of Beit Meri and Ein Saadeh, 10 miles
northeast of Beirut.
   Christian forces commanded by Gen. Michel Aoun did not fire back.
   There was no official explanation for the Syrian bombardment of
the thinly populated mountain slopes.
   But an informed Moslem source, speaking on condition of
anonymity, said it was designed as ``a Syrian message to Aoun that
the truce could fall apart if the Christian media do not stop their
campaign against the Syrians.''
   The Arab League envoy, Lakhdar al-Ibrahimi, announced after a
one-hour meeting with Parliament Speaker Hussein Husseini, a Shiite
Moslem, that Lebanon's Parliament will meet in Saudi Arabia on
Saturday to seek political reforms aimed at ending the 14-year-old
civil war.
   That marked a major advance in the efforts by the 22-member Arab
League to bring Lebanon's feuding factions together and create a
formula aimed at reuniting the fragmented country.
   But the Syrian shelling was a graphic reminder that nothing is
certain.
   Iraqi President Saddam Hussein blamed Lebanon's plight on Syrian
occupation as he inaugurated an Arab Cooperation Council summit
Monday in North Yemen.
   Praising the peacemaking efforts of the three-man Arab League
committee, the Iraqi leader said:
   ``We support the efforts of our brethren in the tripartite
committee despite our conviction that the root of calamity and the
gateway of evil in Lebanon is the Syrian occupation of the
country.''
   The council groups Iraq, Egypt, Jordan and North Yemen.
   A Lebanese police spokesman said Syrian howitzer batteries hit
the Christian area in a 45-minute barrage that ended at 7:45 a.m.
An additional four shells hit the woods at 3 p.m.
   Some shells exploded within a mile of the hilltop Bustan Hotel
where Ibrahimi is staying, a police spokesman said.
   The shelling was the first serious violation of the cease-fire
since it took hold Saturday. It prompted Ibrahimi to urge ``all
sides to abide by the cease-fire ... and to believe that there is a
new chance for peace.''
   The truce was called last week by a three-member Arab League
committee assigned to find a settlement to the civil war, in which
more than 150,000 people have been killed.
   Many Lebanese, who have seen hundreds of truces collapse, remain
skeptical of an overall settlement but welcome the current respite.
   Police said at least 1 million refugees who fled the ferocious
artillery battles that began March 8 have returned to Beirut. The
city has taken the brunt of the devastating shelling, forcing all
but 150,000 of its 1.5 million people to flee.
   A Moslem woman, Hoda Makkouk, returned home to her third-floor
apartment in west Beirut on Sunday with her husband, Rashid and
their two children after four months living with relatives and
friends in the Chouf mountains southeast of the capital.
   ``I was so happy to be back home,'' she said, even though all
the apartment's windows had been blown out. ``I spent the whole
night cleaning up.''

<TEXT>
   A top adviser to President Mikhail S. Gorbachev
said Monday that the superpowers have made good progess on a
strategic arms control treaty but that much work remains.
   ``Both sides have the will, but it is another question how much
time it will take,'' Marshal Sergei F. Akhromeyev said in an
interview at the opening of the Supreme Soviet legislature's fall
session.
   ``There still is a lot of work ahead,'' he added.
   Akhromeyev, former Soviet military chief of staff and now an
adviser to Gorbachev, praised a protocol to determine the size of
chemical weapons stockpiles that was reached in two days of talks
between Secretary of State James A. Baker III and Soviet Foreign
Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze.
   He also praised the decision to hold a summit between President
Bush and Gorbachev next year.
   But he said key questions remain before the two sides can reach
a final agreement on a treaty to slash their store of long-range
nuclear missiles by 30 percent to 50 percent.
   Senior U.S. officials say the Soviets have dropped their
insistence that the United States agree to limits on space-based
missile defense systems before a nuclear arms reduction treaty is
signed.
   That has been a major roadblock in arms negotiations for several
years. Among the unresolved questions are procedures for verifying
compliance with cuts in bombers, missiles and submarines.
   U.S. officials say Bush wants the treaty completed by the summit
meeting.

<TEXT>
   Leftist guerrillas fired on the U.S.
ambassador's residence in Lima and killed a mayor, the 22nd
murdered this year, in separate weekend attacks, police and embassy
officials said Monday.
   Gunmen in a speeding car fired several shots at guards
protecting the ambassador's residence in the pre-dawn hours Sunday,
but no one was wounded, embassy spokesman Tom Leary said.
   Police said it was unclear which of Peru's two guerrilla groups,
the Mao-inspired Shining Path or the pro-Cuba Tupac Amaru
Revolutionary Movement, was responsible for the attack.
   The residence was unoccupied at the time. Former U.S. Ambassador
Alexander Watson left Peru several weeks ago for a new post. His
replacement, Anthony Quainton, has not taken up his new assignment.
   Elsewhere, 10 hooded men burst into the home of Edilberto
Salazar, mayor of Morococha, an isolated mining town 66 miles east
of Lima, and shot him to death after locking his wife in a room
with their four small children, police said.
   At the same time late Saturday night, four other hooded men
broke into the home of Morococha's town treasurer, Hugo Ames, and
killed him.
   Both men belonged to the United Left opposition coalition and
were running for re-election in November's nationwide municipal
elections.
   Government officials say the Shining Path, a dogmatic guerrilla
organization fighting since 1980, is trying to sabotage the
elections.

<HEAD>Prime Minister Condemns IRA for Music School Explosion</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DEAL, England (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher said
Monday the Irish Republican Army members who blew up the Royal
Marines School of Music and killed 10 bandsmen last week are
``monsters'' who will be found and punished.
   ``The young men whom we lost were murdered by common murderers
who must be found and brought to justice and put behind bars for a
very long time,'' she said following a tour of the school's wrecked
barracks in Deal, southeast England.
   ``We lost 10 remarkable musicians, not fighting men, just
because some people try to bomb others out of their democratic
views,'' she said. ``They are very evil people, absolute monsters.''
   Gerry Adams, president of Sinn Fein, the legal political arm of
the IRA, issued a statement disputing Mrs. Thatcher's remarks,
saying ``she knows in her heart of hearts the real nature of the
conflict, its cause and the remedy.''
   The IRA is fighting to end British rule in Northern Ireland and
unite the predominantly Protestant province with the Roman Catholic
Republic of Ireland.
   ``We want an end to all violent deaths arising out of the
present relationship between our two countries,'' Adams said. ``We
want a new peaceful relationship based on an acceptance and respect
for our rights as a sovereign nation.''
   After visiting some of the 11 injured bandsmen still in the
hospital, Mrs. Thatcher pledged: ``The hunt for the bombers will be
pursued with all possible speed, vigor and dedication.''
   Raymond Kendall, the secretary-general of the international
police organization Interpol, pledged the organization's full
support in the hunt for those who blew up the school.
   ``I hope we will have a part to play in finding them,'' said
Kendall after opening the International Police Exhibition and
Conference in London.
   ``They are criminals of the worst sort and should be dealt with
as such.''
   Before landing in Deal, Mrs. Thatcher's helicopter flew over the
rubble that had been the band's recreation center.
   The IRA claimed responsibility for the explosion, and police
said they are looking for three men with Irish accents who rented a
house overlooking the barracks.

<HEAD>House Panel Approves Temporary Spending Bill</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The House Appropriations Committee, facing
spending bill gridlock in the Senate, approved a measure Monday
designed to keep government agencies in business when the new
fiscal year begins in six days.
   The bill, backed by the leadership of both parties and the Bush
administration, would keep the government functioning through Oct.
25. The House was expected to approve it Tuesday and send it to the
Senate.
   The legislation is needed because an assortment of disputes has
kept Congress from completing work on all but one of the 13 annual
spending bills for fiscal 1990, which begins Sunday. Chief among
the stand-offs is a partisan spat over how much money should be
spent on anti-drug programs and how to pay for them.
   The House finished work on the last of its money bills Aug. 4,
but the Senate has approved just seven of its own. The two chambers
need to agree on compromise versions of each measure before they
can be offered to President Bush for his signature.
   Asked how many spending bills he thought would be completed by
Sunday, House Appropriations Committee Chairman Jamie Whitten,
D-Miss., said, ``Talk to the Senate. I can't tell you who a woman's
going to marry or what the Senate's going to do.''
   The emergency measure contains none of the controversial
provisions many of the individual spending bills are laden with.
For example, it does not include language barring cigarette smoking
on airline flights, halting federal aid for ``obscene'' art or
liberalizing abortion restrictions.

<TEXT>
   Rest easy America! Abe Weatherwise,
prognosticator of the Old Farmer's Almanac, says it'll be a mild
winter across most of the country. And New Englanders can expect a
white Christmas.
   Abe, who claims 80 percent accuracy in ``America's oldest
continuously published periodical,'' says only the northern third
of the country will have more snow than usual.
   The 198th edition of the 224-page almanac hits the newsstands
and supermarkets this week with its familiar planting and tide
tables, anecdotes and other tidbits, such as 100 ways how to avoid
untimely death. (No. 49. Avoid combing hair in the dark; No. 77.
Never whistle in a coal mine.)
   Abe, a collective pseudonym, says the almanac's predictions are
``based on state-of-the art analysis of recurring solar cycles.''
He predicts that a cold, wet and snowy spring in the North will be
balanced by warm, dry spring weather west of the Mississippi.
   The summer of 1990, says Abe, will be hot and dry in many areas
east of the Rockies.
   In Canada, where 300,000 of the 4 million copies of the
customary yellow-covered almanac will be sold, heavier than average
snow is forecast from Quebec through the prairie provinces.
   ``The more serious the weather, the larger percentage we sell,''
says Executive Editor Tim Clark. ``They count on us more in Alberta
than in Alabama.''
   The Old Farmer's Almanac is the legal document for tides and
sunrises and sunsets in most states. In addition to giving readers
weather predictions, advertisements for hernia appliances, secrets
of winning lotteries and rules of thumb for rhubarb pie, the
almanac advises that cows and pigs bred for leanness will boost the
popularity of red meat and inflation will run at 6 percent.
   The almanac also predicts the return of 4-inch-wide neckties for
men, short hair for women and lower prices for videocassette
recorders.
   The Old Farmer's Almanac is not to be confused with its upstart
rival, the Farmer's Almanac, which is about a third as thick, 23
years younger, and is given away to businesses for advertising
purposes.
   The distinguishing trademark of the Old Farmer's Almanac is a
hole in the corner, put there at great expense and inconvenience,
its publishers say, to preserve the tradition of hanging the book
on a nail in the pantry or outhouse.

<TEXT>
   Women broke into Massachusetts'
judicial ranks decades ago, but now they're finally getting into
the picture with the commissioning of portraits of female judges
for courthouse walls.
   The recently unveiled oil painting of retired Superior Court
Judge Eileen P. Griffin marks a new trend among the traditional
oils of black-garbed men that are a staple of courthouses across
the state, women judges said.
   ``It's a symbol,'' said Superior Court Judge Suzanne Del
Vecchio, sitting in Dedham. ``It's so that other women can come in
and see there are not only women on the bench, there are women on
the wall.''
   ``Change is slow, but it's there,'' said Supreme Court Judge
Ruth I. Abrams, who recalls the lonely days when she and Griffin
were the only women on the Superior Court bench.
   The first woman appointed to Superior Court, Jenny Barron,
appears in a portrait in Suffolk Superior Court, dedicated in 1971,
three years after her death, said Francis X. Orfanello, an
administrative assistant to the chief justice.
   A check with various judicial offices Monday did not produce any
sightings of other female portraits, said Joan Kenney, spokeswoman
for the Supreme Court.
   Portraits are not paid for by the state, but are generally
commissioned by family, friends or the local bar associations,
Kenney said.
   More than half of the women judges now on the bench in
Massachusetts were appointed in the last five years, bringing their
total up to 12 percent of the judiciary.
   ``I think as we have more women judges there'll be more women's
pictures, and as we have more women lawyers the profession becomes
kinder to women,'' Abrams said.
   Griffin, who is still active in Hampden County as a master in
mediation sessions involving civil cases, said she was surprised to
find that friends had banded together to commission the portrait,
unveiled last week.
   ``I'm pleased, of course,'' she said.
   Griffin was appointed to Superior Court in 1973 by then-Gov.
Francis W. Sargent.
   A recent study commissioned by the Supreme Court examined how
women are treated in Massachusetts courtrooms _ as judges,
attorneys and defendants _ and found bias does exist, said Gladys
Maged, executive director of the study panel.
   Courtroom comments reported by both male and female attorneys
included the phrase ``counsel may be beautiful but she is entirely
wrong,'' and female judges being addressed as ``dearie,'' Maged
said.
   Meanwhile, women judges said they look forward to commemoration
in oil.
   ``The fact that you looked around and you saw no portraits of
female judges, that's a symptom of what's been going on in the
courts. But things are beginning to change,'' Del Vecchio said.

   The Federal Aviation Administration said
Monday it has tightened security standards since the December
bombing of Pan Am Flight 103, but a General Accounting Office
investigation said the FAA doesn't know if airlines are meeting the
standards.
   In addition, an Israeli airline security expert who studied U.S.
systems said American airline companies do ``very little well''
when it comes to protecting passengers from an attack such as the
one that killed 270 people in the Pan Am explosion over Lockerbie,
Scotland, Dec. 21.
   The GAO report, the details of which are being kept secret by
Congress, was summarized by Rep. Cardiss Collins, D-Ill., at a
hearing of her House Government Operations subcommittee on
government activities and transportation.
   ``Overall, GAO found that despite additional security measures
imposed following Pan Am 103, FAA cannot assure itself that
required security procedures are being properly carried out by the
airlines at designated high-risk airports,'' said Collins.
   She said security deficiencies found in recent FAA airline
inspections showed breakdowns in the training of airline security
personnel.
   ``GAO believes these deficiencies occur largely because FAA has
not established minimum training standards needed to ensure that
airline security personnel working at high-risk airports overseas
are sufficiently trained,'' said the congresswoman.
   The GAO is an investigative agency of Congress.
   Isaac Yeffet, former director general of security for El Al
Israel Airlines, told the subcommittee that training given security
agents for U.S. air carriers ``is extremely low, insufficient and
not effective.''
   He said that because the FAA leaves airlines responsible for
their own security, the agency can avoid responsibility for
failures.
   ``Virtually all American airlines hire security firms based
solely on the lowest price,'' said Yeffet.
   Monte Belger, associate administrator for aviation standards at
the FAA, said the agency needs to be more active in seeing that
U.S. standards are being met by U.S. carriers in foreign airports.
   ``We have put U.S. carriers in the posture of having to deal as
a private organization with a foreign government to implement our
government regulations,'' said Belger, who said the Bush
administration was in favor of increasing FAA activity abroad.
   Ray Salazar, director of civil aviation security at the FAA,
said the agency has increased its workforce and expanded its
intelligence organization since the Pan Am explosion.
   ``Unfortunately, we build a 12-foot wall and the criminal finds
a 13-foot ladder,'' Salazar said.
   Investigators found that the explosion was caused by plastic
explosives planted in a cassette player.
   American security measures were compared repeatedly during the
hearing to those used by El Al, but Salazar said the level of
Israeli government support for that airline is such that ``many
would argue it is not a commercial airline.''
   Salazar said that El Al's security procedures are labor
intensive, using proportionately many more workers than any U.S.
carriers.
   He said the airline is small compared to American carriers,
which altogether transport 1.2 million people a day, many on about
1,800 international flights daily.
   ``It isn't practical to put that kind of manpower into the
system and have the transportation system we have today,'' said
Salazar. He said the United States relies more on mechanical
devices to detect security problems.

   Strikes at nearly 100 factories and offices ended
Monday a month-long walkout called to protest a law making a
Romanian dialect the official language of the Moldavian republic,
Tass reported.
   The Soviet news agency quoted strike organization co-chairman
Vladimir Ivanov as saying the non-Moldavian workers in Bendery,
Tiraspol and other cities hoped their demands would be considered
by the Supreme Soviet legislature that began its fall session
Monday in Moscow.
   Strikers who walked off their jobs just before the Aug. 29
opening of a legislative session in the Moldavian capital Kishinev,
where Moldavian was declared the official language, returned to
their jobs Monday, Tass said.
   Strikers demanded that the republic bordering Romania be given
two official languages, Moldavian and Russian.
   Tass said strike committees however remain active. ``Their
purpose is to maintain working-class political activity, elect
people dedicated to perestroika to party and public bodies in the
course of the current election campaign,'' for local offices.
   About one-third of the 4.2 million residents of Moldavia are
non-Moldavians.

   Robert Howley has a fish story to tell that
even he didn't believe at first.
   Howley, 51, was reunited with his wallet last week after a
four-year separation. It was found in 30 feet of water, 200 yards
off the shore of Lake Winnipesaukee _ right where he had dropped it
in 1985 while trying to fix his boat's engine during a fishing
outing.
   A scuba diver who was looking for a light that had fallen off an
antique boat found the wallet.
   Howley said at first he didn't believe it when Robert Ouellette,
24, called to tell him he'd found the wallet, which contained $480
in soaking bills. For years, Howley's friends had teased him,
joking that they had found the wallet.
   But Ouellette convinced Howley that this was no gag.
   ``When he explained to me exactly where he had found it, I got
so excited I headed right up there,'' said Howley, who lives in
Seabrook. ``I'm very appreciative.''

<TEXT>
   Steel scaffolding being moved at a
construction site touched a 69,000-volt line in a ``ball of fire''
Monday, electrocuting three workers and injuring three, two
seriously.
   The six men were rolling the wheeled, 25-foot scaffolding at a
building under construction at Worthington Industries Inc., said
Doug Reardon, president of Target Construction Co., the general
contractor. No one was on the scaffolding.
   It appeared that the men ``just didn't look up. They never knew
what hit them,'' said police Sgt. Clifford Davis.
   Columbus Southern Power Co. said the cable carried enough
electricity to supply a small town. The line, about 30 feet from
the new building, fed Worthington Industries' steel plant and was
one of two circuits serving an Anheuser-Busch brewery.
   The workers were moving scaffolding to another wall of the
building where they were putting up aluminum siding.
   Roscoe Blackburn, 24, a Target Construction employee, said he
was one of several workers installing a roof on the building when
the accident occurred.
   ``I saw a big spark, and we went to the edge to look over and
saw them all lying on the ground,'' he said. ``We got off of there.
We just started yelling for help.''
   He said the victims still appeared to be in contact with the
scaffolding, so he and the others did not try to move them.
   Ray Smith, of a concrete company, said he was inside the
building when he heard an explosion. He looked outside and saw ``a
huge orange ball of fire shooting way up in the sky.''
   Worthington Industries was without power for about five hours
and sent 200 employees home, said spokesman Bruce Ruhl.
   One of the injured men underwent surgery at the Ohio State
University Hospitals with second- and third-degree burns over most
of his body, said hospital spokesman David Crawford.
   The second was in critical condition at St. Ann's Hospital in
suburban Westerville, and the third was in satisfactory condition
at Riverside Hospital, officials said.

<HEAD>High Court Chosen to Try Former Premier</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ATHENS, Greece (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A special high court was chosen Monday to
try former Premier Andreas Papandreou on charges of instigating
widespread illegal wiretapping while in office.
   He faces a minimum of five years in prison if convicted.
   Parliament speaker Athanassios Tsaldaris chose 12 judges by lot
from a list of the nation's 48 Supreme Court judges and 43 Appeals
Court presidents. Tsaldaris then sent the case file to Supreme
Court President Yannis Grivas, who will preside over the tribunal.
It is expected to convene in November.
   Parliament voted last Wednesday to try the 70-year-old
Papandreou on allegations he was behind the tapping of telephones
of his political friends and foes from May 1987 to April 1989.
   Papandreou boycotted the debate, sending instead a note saying
he was being persecuted unjustly by his political rivals.
   Theofanis Tombras, former managing director of the Hellenic
Telecommunications Organization, and Costas Tsimas, former director
of the National Intelligence Service, will appear in court with
Papandreou on charges of having been accomplices.
   The debate followed a report by a parliamentary commission of
inquiry recommending that Papandreou, Tombras and Tsimas be
indicted.
   After eight years in power, Papandreou's Panhellenic Socialist
Movement lost elections last June that resulted in a hung
Parliament.
   The conservative New Democracy party and the Communist-led
Coalition of the Left and Progress formed a governing alliance that
pledged to carry out a cleansing of Greek political life before
holding new elections by Nov.5.
   On Tuesday, Parliament will begin a two-day debate to decide
whether Papandreou and four of his former senior ministers will be
indicted in connection with a $210 million Bank of Crete
embezzlement scandal, which another parliamentary commission of
inquiry has recommended.
   Parliament has already indicted former Deputy Finance Minister
Nikos Athanassopoulos, who will stand trial before a special high
court set up last month. He is accused of ordering a cover-up of a
scandal in 1986 in which a state company sold the European Economic
Community 9,000 tons of Yugoslav corn, claiming it was Greek.
   The European Court last week ordered Greece to pay $3.8 million
in unpaid dues on the corn, court costs and interest.
   In Greece, a government minister accused of criminal action
while in office can be tried only by a special court after an
investigating committee of deputies convinces Parliament sufficient
evidence exists for a trial.
   Grivas has 15 days after selection of the tribunal to appoint
one court member as a special investigator to look further into the
charges.
   The investigator then will have 30 days to present his findings,
making mid-November a likely date for the trial.
   The indication was that Papandreou could lead his socialist
party into the next elections while under indictment.

<HEAD>Feud Escalates Over Capital Gains Tax Cut</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By STEVEN KOMAROW</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Democrats and Republicans intensified their
battle over a capital gains tax cut Monday with sharper rhetoric
and new radio and television ads as they headed toward a showdown
on the House floor this week.
   President Bush's budget director, Richard Darman, said Democrats
opposing the capital gains tax cut were showing their true colors
with their alternative plan, which would raise tax rates on the
rich to restore deductions for Individual Retirement Accounts.
   ``It's clearly a reconfirmation that they want to raise taxes,''
Darman said. ``One has to wonder, when they say it's limited to
only 600,000 taxpayers, who will have their taxes raised ... who's
going to believe they want to stop there?''
   House Speaker Thomas S. Foley, D-Wash., countered angrily that
Darman's comments were ``stuff and nonsense.''
   The Bush-backed plan to drop the maximum tax rate on capital
gains from 33 percent to 19.6 percent was ``ill-timed,
ill-considered and damaging... helping only the richest of our
citizens and unfair to the middle class,'' he said.
   ``If the president thinks a veto threat ... will provide that
kind of a bill being sent to him, he is very wrong indeed,'' Foley
said.
   The House might vote on the issue as early as Wednesday. The
exact timing was in doubt Monday as the Democratic leadership
wrestled with when to debate it and other controversial items
attached to a giant budget bill, such as child care and Medicare
catastrophic illness insurance.
   Both sides said they expected a close vote, and to tip the
balance they both launched advertising campaigns.
   ``George Bush wants to raid the Treasury by reducing capital
gains taxes for the superrich and he wants working Americans to pay
for it,'' House Majority Leader Richard Gephardt, D-Mo., said in a
Democratic Party television ad taped Monday.
   A House GOP-sponsored commercial features an American flag
flying against those of other industrial nations. The comparatively
high U.S. capital gains tax ``hurts small businesses trying to
expand, families investing to send kids to college, senior citizens
preparing for retirement,'' it contends.
   A radio spot sponsored by organized labor emphasizes that the
nation's wealthiest people get the lion's share of the benefits
from cutting capital gains taxes, which are levied on profits from
stocks and bonds, real estate and sales of other assets.
   ``Oh, they'll trot out the old malarkey about how cutting taxes
for rich people spurs economic growth,'' but ``there's not a bit of
evidence to back it up,'' the ad says.
   Asked by reporters about statistics that show upper-income
people benefit disproportionately from capital gains tax cuts,
Darman said, ``It's off the point. The issue is what's the effect
on long-term growth and productivity.''
   Darman also repeated the Republican contention that Democrats,
by opposing Bush's will, would be to blame if Congress and the
president can't agree on a deficit-reduction package this fall. He
said it was a ``kamikaze approach to national politics'' aimed at
forcing a tax increase.
   The Gramm-Rudman law requires across-the-board spending cuts on
Oct. 15 unless the projected fiscal 1990 deficit is brought to
below $110 billion by then.
   Foley said Darman's suggestion was ``unworthy of him.''
   ``We are not trying to create some kind of a political combat.
We are trying to offer a proposal we think is good for the
country's economic future,'' he said.
   Both Foley and Darman tried to play down the long-term political
consequences of the battle.
   ``The partisanship should be confined to this one issue so we
don't have adverse spillover effects elsewhere,'' said Darman. He
said he still hopes to strike a long-term deficit reduction pact
with Congress.
   Foley tried to brush aside suggestions that the capital gains
fight was the first big test of his leadership.
   ``We intend to be in responsibility for a long time to come,''
he said.

   Hair-trigger tempers are among the
aftereffects of Hurricane Hugo around here. Lines are long, and
there is no electricity to cook hot meals, run water heaters for
hot showers or power televisions and lights.
   ``I think that you can look at the people and realize that all
we need is a little spark,'' Patrolman Angel Ortiz said. ``The
people are short-tempered right now.''
   A 7 p.m. curfew in Charleston forces residents to return to
homes lit only with candles, flashlights and kerosene lamps. On
Monday, a steady downpour and temperatures in the 60s added to the
misery.
   At one point, people lined up for four hours to buy food.
Outside a grocery store near one of Charleston's poorer
neighborhoods, frustrations were as plain as damage from the storm.
   ``There's no bread. There's no meat,'' Harold Washington, 21,
said. ``We can't survive like that.''
   Gerald Dean has been unable to get his paycheck from the
restaurant where he works. Even if he could, all but a few banks
remained closed Monday because of the lack of electricity.
   ``I'm frustrated, man,'' said Dean, whose 2-year-old child was
diagnosed with meningitis and hospitalized the day of the hurricane.
   On Saturday, a crowd of about 200 pushed, shoved and cursed as
they waited for free ice, which was never distributed. Police
called the incident a ``near riot,'' yet were not surprised it took
place.
   ``People are getting a little testy after a few days, and it's
understandable,'' said Maj. Charles Wiley of the Charleston Police
Department.
   On the Isle of Palms, across Charleston harbor, police on Sunday
punched and arrested a man who refused to heed orders to stay off
the island. The island was off-limits until Monday under martial
law while officials surveyed damage.
   Wiley said calm will return once more utility services are
restored, relief centers are opened and lines get shorter. ``An
angry person is not necessarily a riotous person,'' he said.
   Charleston Mayor Joseph P. Riley Jr. said he does not believe a
riot will break out.
   ``It's not a concern in terms of something that I think is going
to happen,'' he said. ``We have worked hard, our people know we're
working with them ... so I don't think it's going to create any
problems.''
   But Dean said unless more relief comes soon, ``a lot of people's
belongings are going to get took'' by looters.
   ``The whole town's going to be called `Hell Hole' soon. That's
what it's going to be, one big hell hole. Only the survivors like
myself are going to dig ourselves out of it,'' Dean said.
   Others see no reason to get upset with inconveniences over which
there is little control. ``I don't think people need to get
angry,'' said LeVerne Brown, a hotel employee.
   Even so, Ortiz believes Hugo's full impact is only now beginning
to be felt.
   ``The first day after, people were kind of walking around in
shock,'' he said. ``Then they were elated that they didn't suffer
any more than they did. But now ... maybe the shock of the whole
thing is just beginning to hit them _ that maybe they weren't that
lucky.''

<DATELINE>LEIPZIG, East Germany (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   About 8,000 people marched through
this East German city Monday, calling for more democracy in their
communist homeland and singing ``We Shall Overcome,'' witnesses
reported.
   An Associated Press reporter at the scene and human rights
activists said security forces arrested scores of people after the
protesters blocked traffic in downtown Leipzig.
   The demonstration came hours after communist authorities refused
to register a pro-democracy opposition group called New Forum and
told its members to cease all activities immediately.
   The Leipzig demonstration began after a religious service in the
St. Nicholas church. The Monday evening services, known as ``peace
prayers,'' have become a rallying point for dissidents and rights
activists in recent months and frequently have been followed by
demonstrations.
   Witnesses and rights activists said about 2,000 people attended
the service, while another 2,000 gathered outside the church.
   The crowd then started marching toward downtown and Leipzig's
main train station. About 4,000 people joined the march along the
way and the crowd sang ``We Shall Overcome,'' and shouted slogans
such as ``Liberty, Equality, Fraternity!'' witnesses said.
   Security forces cordoned off downtown and intervened to disperse
the crowd when the protesters reached the main train station.
   It was not known if there were any injuries in the police action.
   The West German ZDF television network said one of its camera
crews was prevented by police from filming the demonstration.
   Earlier Monday in East Berlin, two founding members of the Neues
Forum, or New Forum, were called into the Interior Ministry and
given a brief statement rejecting the group's application to be
legalized.
   New Forum activists say the pro-democracy group has grown from
30 to more than 4,000 members nationwide in two weeks. It includes
some of East Germany's most prominent artists, intellectuals,
performers and other public figures.
   New Forum is urging democratic reforms in the rigidly controlled
communist country. The group has held meetings with other informal
opposition groups to coordinate their activities.
   More than 20,000 East Germans have fled to West Germany since
Hungary opened its borders to East German citizens two weeks ago.
   East Germany's aging leadership has rejected the need for the
kind of political and economic reforms sweeping the Soviet Union,
Poland and Hungary.
   Barbel Bohley and Jutta Seidel, two New Forum members who signed
the application for the group to be legalized, told reporters in
East Berlin they were called to the Interior Ministry on Monday and
handed its decision.
   The ministry's brief statement said the group was ``socially
unnecessary since there is no clear social interest'' for the group
to exist, and told New Forum to cease all activities.
   Ms. Bohley and Ms. Seidel noted the Interior Ministry statement
did not call New Forum an ``anti-state'' group. Thursday, the
ministry accused the group of harboring ``anti-state policies.''

<TEXT>
   The United States has invited Zaire's
President Mobutu Sese Seko for talks on faltering negotiations
between the Soviet-backed Angolan government and the U.S.-backed
rebels, officials said Monday.
   Mobutu, who will attend the United Nations General Assembly, has
been asked to come to Washington at the same time as Jonas Savimbi,
leader of UNITA, the Union for the Total Independence of Angola,
the officials said.
   If Mobutu does not come to Washington, an official who spoke on
condition of anonymity said talks with him would be held in New
York.
   Mobutu, who has considerable prestige riding on the Angola-UNITA
pact he sponsored, was in Washington three months ago.
   The State Department is eager to have Savimbi and Mobutu meet to
prevent the peace talks from derailing completely. Mobutu served as
the mediator for a June cease-fire, but the truce has shattered and
subsequent talks failed.
   Savimbi refused to attend the last negotiating session in
Kinshasa on Sept. 18 despite urgings from Assistant Secretary of
State Herman Cohen, who made a special trip to the region.
   Mobutu has considerable leverage with UNITA because most of the
U.S. arms and other aid for the organization, estimated at between
$40 million and $80 million, is funneled through Zaire.
   He appeared in recent weeks to be siding with Angolan President
Jose Eduardo dos Santos.
   Dos Santos contends Savimbi agreed to go into exile and
integrate his troops with the Angolan army. Savimbi denies he
agreed to exile and says he will only surrender arms in return for
a promise of free elections.
   The United States is concerned that if the UNITA-Angola talks
don't resume soon Cuba may disrupt the pullout of its troops from
Angola.
   The pullout of 50,000 Cuban troops by 1991 was part of a
U.S.-sponsored agreement signed in December, which also granted
Namibia independence from South African rule.

   China has bought an additional 300,000 metric
tons of U.S. wheat for delivery in the 1989-90 marketing year that
began June 1, the Agriculture Department said Monday.
   The sales were reported to USDA by private exporters as required
by law, but no further details were announced.
   The latest wheat sales boosted to more than 4 million tons the
amount of U.S. wheat China has purchased for the 1989-90 season.
Last year's sales totaled 8.1 million tons, making China the
leading foreign market for American wheat farmers.
   A metric ton is about 2,205 pounds and is equal to 36.7 bushels
of wheat. The 300,000 tons of wheat would be about 11 million
bushels.
   Wheat prices at the farm have averaged around $3.65 per bushel
nationally, according to USDA recent five-day market estimates.
That would make the sale worth about $40 million.

<HEAD>Leader of Miskito Indians Says He Will Return to Nicaragua</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By FREDDY CUEVAS</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>TEGUCIGALPA, Honduras (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The leader of the Miskito Indian
resistance to the Sandinista government said Monday he will return
to Nicaragua to discuss turning in his weapons and forming a
political party to take part in February's elections.
   ``The war against the Sandinista government is paralyzed because
of the peace accords,'' Wycliff Diego, leader of about 3,500
guerrillas, said at a news conference.
   Diego was referring to accords signed Aug. 7 by five Central
American presidents that call for disbanding U.S.-supported rebels
that have been trying to topple Nicaragua's leftist Sandinistas in
return for a Sandinista guarantee of fair elections.
   Diego heads a directorate that controls the Miskito
anti-Sandinista movement, which has operated independently from the
main Contra resistance.
   The Miskitos, other Indians and blacks of West Indian descent
make up the majority of the population in the sparsely populated
eastern two-thirds of Nicaragua. In some areas along its Caribbean
coast, English is spoken.
   The Miskitos have spearheaded the resistance in eastern
Nicaragua, operating from bases in remote northeastern Honduras
with U.S. support.
   ``We Indians have always been discriminated against in
Nicaragua. That's why we've had to fight all our lives, including
in the war, to make ourselves part of that society,'' Diego said.
   Even so, Diego said, his group, called YATAMA after the Miskito
words for Sons of Mother Earth, decided to explore repatriation
because of the stalled war.
   Diego said resistance leaders Brooklyn Rivera, Steadman Fagoth
Muller and Julian Holmes will join him on a trip to Nicaragua
beginning later this week.
   Diego said his group will meet with Nicaraguan President Daniel
Ortega, discuss the repatriation of 9,000 refugees living in
Honduras and visit Indians living in eastern Nicaragua.
   The Sandinistas have recently made conciliatory moves toward the
Indians, making sure that a Miskito was given a chance to speak at
their convention Sunday that nominated Ortega as the Sandinista
presidential candidate in the Feb. 25 elections.
   Diego said YATAMA has 3,500 guerrillas, 1,000 inside Nicaragua
and 2,500 on the Honduran frontier. The northeastern frontier
between the two countries has always been more porous than other
parts of the border because of heavy jungle and thin population.
   Fighting in Nicaragua has decreased sharply since February 1988,
when the U.S. cut off military aid to the mainline Contra
resistance and the Indian fighters. Both groups continue to receive
non-lethal aid.
   Diego said YATAMA fighters _ including members of the Miskito,
Sumo and Rama tribes as well as Nicaraguan blacks _ are prepared to
turn in their arms by Dec. 8, when the peace accord calls for
demobilization of armed rebels.
   ``We intend to create a political party in Nicaragua that will
be called YATAMA to participate in next year's vote. Even so, the
situation is difficult because the Sandinistas have said all
parties must be organized by the end of this month,'' Diego said.
   Holmes said the directors' trip back to Nicaragua was authorized
by Ortega at the request of former President Carter, who visited
Managua last week and who serve as an election observer.
   ``Our commission will hold talks with the Sandinistas, study the
Nicaraguan political situation and see if it is possible for our
refugees and exiles to return to the country,'' Holmes said.

<HEAD>Utah Teachers Hold One-Day Strike Over School Funding</HEAD>

   Nearly 20,000 Utah teachers boycotted
classrooms Monday in a one-day strike to protest what they claim is
chronic underfunding of one of the nation's most crowded public
school systems.
   The strike, called after the Legislature last week approved a
$38.4 million tax cut but no new money for education, canceled
classes for about 450,000 students.
   The walkout began with a wildcat strike Friday in the Salt Lake,
Ogden and Provo areas.
   Because the teachers union did not announce the statewide
walkout until Saturday, districts could not get enough substitutes,
said James R. Moss, superintendent of public instruction.
   ``We're saying there are real critical needs in reducing class
size, more textbooks, teacher salaries and in the area of personnel
like counselors, librarians, those kinds of special people,'' said
Jim Campbell, president of the teachers union, which represents up
to 90 percent of Utah's teachers.
   With a population of 1.7 million, Utah has the largest average
household size at 3.17, compared to the national average of 2.62.
Nearly 70 percent of its residents are members of the Mormon
Church, which encourages big families, and the state has the
nation's highest percentage of school-age children, or 37 percent
under 18.
   With a student-teacher ratio of 25.4 to 1, Utah also has the
most crowded classrooms, and at $22,621 a year its teacher salaries
are smaller than in 43 other states. The state ranks 50th in
average annual expenditure per student of $2,326.
   Teachers long have complained they have 40 or more students in
some classrooms and don't have enought textbooks and other supplies.
   Gov. Norm Bangerter acknowledged ``serious problems'' but said
the teachers should have waited for the regular January legislative
session to press their demands.
   The governor said the state may have a surplus of $185 million
by the end of the fiscal year in June.
   More than 100 students crowded into a conference room Monday at
the Capitol for a discussion with Bangerter, who was asked why he
wouldn't veto the tax cut.
   ``I wanted the tax cut,'' the governor said. ``You have to
remember I was the one who raised taxes two years ago.''
   Only two districts, both in the sparsely populated northeastern
corner of the state, were open Monday, the Board of Education said.

   With the education summit at hand, eight
business groups called on President Bush and the nation's governors
Monday to dedicate as much energy and resources to schools as has
been committed to the war on drugs.
   ``The strength of the American economy rests on the strength of
America's public schools,'' said William Kolberg, president of the
National Alliance of Business.
   Kolberg, referring to statistics showing dismal academic
achievement by U.S. students, said ``All sectors share a
responsibility for the current crisis'' and stressed that Bush
``must show leadership'' by making ``the improvement of public
education a national priority on a level similar to his war on
drugs.''
   Kolberg and Robert Holland, president of the Committee for
Economic Development, announced the formation of a special
coalition and outlined an agenda for action that coalition members
said is necessary if education reform is to become a reality.
   The ``Business Coalition for Education Reform, co-chaired by
Holland and Kolberg, also will include The Business Roundtable, the
U.S. Chamber of Commerce, the National Association of
Manufacturers, The Conference Board, the American Business
Conference, and the U.S. Hispanic Chamber of Commerce.
   Under the proposed six-point agenda, the coalition said, ``We
must define the goals of education, set the standards for
attainment, and develop better ways of measuring achievement and
assigning accountability for students, teachers and
administrators.''
   Bush and members of the National Governors' Association already
have agreed to focus the two-day summit at Charlottesville, Va., on
creating a process for developing national performance goals.
   The coalition agenda also called for creating a new
professionalism for teachers and administrators, investing in early
prevention and intervention strategies to help disadvantaged
children become ready for school, supporting more equitable
financing of education within states, linking the resources of
higher education into the reform effort and restructuring the
school systems.
   The group called on the president to select as soon as possible
members for a presidential education policy advisory committee.
   Kolberg said the coalition will work with the governors on a
national and state-by-state basis, and with the White House and
appropriate agencies to begin to initiate new policies, practices
and strategies that enable systemic change.
   ``We will encourage business leaders to becoming more involved
at state and local levels, not in `feel-good' endeavors, but those
directed at systemic change,'' said Kolberg. ``We will increase
business' understanding about education restructuring issues and
serve as a resource for others who want to be involved.''

   Among the U.S. proposals that Soviet Foreign
Secretary Eduard A. Shevardnadze will carry back to Moscow is one
to open large areas of both countries that have been closed to
citizens of the other, an administration official said Monday.
   Secretary of State James A. Baker III advanced the ``open
lands'' proposal in talks with Shevardnadze last weekend in
Wyoming, but the positive Soviet response was lost amid several
surprise developments to speed conclusion of major arms control
treaties.
   ``We believe that we should move toward a situation of open seas
and oceans, open lands and open space,'' Shevardnadze told a news
conference Saturday.
   ``Transparency here, glasnost here, should not be selective or
limited. It should apply everywhere,'' the Soviet foreign minister
said.
   The Soviets did not respond immediately to Baker's proposal
``because, frankly, there were bigger fish to fry,'' said a State
Department official, speaking on condition he not be further
identified. But the Soviets told the Americans ``they were going to
take a look at it.''
   The two sides have already made steps toward lifting travel
restrictions that were first imposed by the Soviet Union in 1941,
while that country was fighting invading Germans.
   In 1955, during the Cold War, the United States introduced
reciprocal restrictions of its own, closing about half of the
country to Soviet diplomats, journalists and academics.
   Those restrictions were eased slightly with the Helsinki Accord
in 1976, but Soviets and Americans living in each others' countries
must still follow elaborate notification procedures if they wish to
travel. Many areas remain closed.
   The State Department official said that recently ``there have
been some problems, but otherwise it is easier. There has been an
opening up.''
   A written department statement said ``it has always been United
States policy that both the United States and the USSR should
reciprocally abolish `closed areas.'''
   ``As a result of glasnost (openness) and perestroika
(restructuring), academic, scientific and commerical interchange
and people-to-people contact between the United States and the
Soviet Union have witnessed unparalled growth,'' it said.
   ``Yet, outmoded internal travel restrictions continue to make it
difficult for diplomats and journalists to do their jobs, academics
to do research and families to visit relatives,'' the statement
said.
   The U.S. proposal calls for abolition of areas that have been
closed for security reasons, but would leave some sensitive bases
off-limits. It calls for simplifying the system of notification,
but would ensure that officials continue to book travel and
accomodations through the existing agencies, the Soviet Directorate
of the Diplomatic Corps and the U.S. Office of Foreign Missions.

   A propane truck became wedged under a
bridge and sprang a leak Monday, cutting off residents at one end
of Aquidneck Island from the mainland for more than seven hours.
   No one was injured and no fire or explosion occurred in the
accident, which took place about 9 a.m.
   Houses within a quarter-mile were evacuated to community centers
at the north end of the island and police stood ready to lead
residents of the area's 600 homes on foot across a golf course _
the only escape route _ if necessary.
   Electricity in the area was shut off to prevent an explosion,
the Federal Aviation Administration closed airspace above the
accident to a height of 3,000 feet, and the Coast Guard blocked
boat traffic nearby.
   Access and electricity were restored to the northern tip of
Aquidneck Island shortly after 4 p.m., after the truck had leaked
the last of its volatile cargo and was removed.
   The accident cut off the only two roads in and out of the north
end of the Narragansett Bay island, which is about 15 miles long. A
bridge links Portsmouth, a town of 15,000, to the mainland.
   A woman who identified herself only as Maureen pushed her
year-old daughter in a stroller from their home across the golf
course, a 1{-mile trek. ``I don't want to be stuck there and I felt
threatened,'' she said.
   Police Chief Madison Bailey said three safety valves protruding
from the truck tore off when the vehicle failed to clear a 9-foot-5
railroad underpass by about 6 inches.
   Bailey said authorities had to let the 1,900 gallons of propane
in the truck vaporize and dissipate because there was no way to
stop the leak and attempts to pump the cargo into another truck
were were unsuccessful.
   ``You've got a lot of gas. You can't move the truck. It's a very
dangerous situation,'' Bailey said early in the day. He said
authorities tried letting the air out of the truck's tires to
remove the vehicle, but the springs kept it wedged up against the
bridge.
   William Chase, Northeast general manager for Star Gas Co., owner
of the truck, said the truck was not likely to explode because the
gas was venting through a roof valve and not concentrating near the
ground.
   ``If it were to ignite, it probably would be just like a large
torch, a flare,'' he said.
   Police said they did not know why the truck driver had chosen to
go under the bridge rather than use an adjacent road that crosses
the tracks.
   No charges were filed.
   Some 80 golfers were evacuated from the country club. Golf pro
Stephen Diemoz said he drove the course in a golf cart to round up
the players.

   Officials handed out $300 emergency
checks Monday to islanders who lost their homes in Hurricane Hugo,
which caused an estimated $1 billion damage to Puerto Rico.
   Much of this island and its neighbors in the eastern Caribbean
remained without water and electricity Monday, one week after Hugo
and its 125-mph winds whipped through the region.
   Relief from the United States and Caribbean islands that escaped
Hugo's destruction has poured into Puerto Rico, which Gov. Rafael
Hernandez Colon said sustained $1 billion in damage and caused the
deaths of seven people on the island. Earlier reports had put the
dead at six.
   The federal government, working with Puerto Rican officials,
began distributing the $300 emergency checks to families without
homes. By Monday, 7,000 checks had been approved, but officials
were uncertain how many people would eventually receive them.
   The governor met with school superintendents and asked them to
take a census of the number of families without homes. Various
government estimates range from 25,000 to 53,000 of Puerto Rico's
750,000 families are homeless.
   Jose Bravo, director of the Federal Emergency Management
Administration on this U.S. Commonwealth, said the maximum aid to a
single family is $10,000 if its property is in a disaster zone. The
capital, San Juan, and other communities on the eastern side of
this island were declared disaster areas.
   The Puerto Rico water company estimated 800,000 of Puerto Rico's
3.3 million people were still without water service Monday. Luis
Ruiz Javier, executive director of the company, said San Juan
should be receiving water by Tuesday.
   Meanwhile, people were taking water from swimming pools, bathing
at fire hydrants or in the sea, and filling buckets at portable
tanks distributed throughout the city. Two U.S. Navy destroyers,
each carrying 10,000 gallons of fresh water, distributed water at a
San Juan harbor.
   The Electric Power Authority reported it had restored power to
70 percent of the island, although much of the capital remained
without electricity.
   On the eastern Caribbean island of Antigua, the government
reported $90 million in damages and 420 people homeless out of a
total population of 85,000.
   A government emergency committee said much of the country was
left without power, water and telephone service, but public
utilities should be restored by the weekend.
   Only one death was confirmed, a 74-year-old woman who ran from
her home seeking shelter during the hurricane. Earlier, two people
were reported to have died.
   A total of 33 to 35 people were reported killed by Hugo, which
swept through Sept. 17-18.
   Aid and relief personnel were arriving from Caribbean neighbors
that escaped the storm, including Trinidad and Tobago, Guyana and
Jamaica. Much of the relief was for the British colony of
Montserrat, where 10 people were killed, 30 percent of the homes
destroyed and damages of $100 million were incurred.
   In the U.S. Virgin Islands, the Coast Guard reported a storage
tank at the Virgin Islands Water and Power Authority was still
leaking at a rate of 42,000 gallons a day.
   They said the tank, damaged by the storm, still contained 1.25
million gallons, but that the oil was no longer seeping into the
harbor. The Guard also said 40,000 gallons that did reach the
harbor had been confined in containment booms.
   Military and civilian cargo planes continued to unload relief
supplies at St. Croix, where Hugo damaged 90 percent of the homes
and left 45,000 homeless. Gov. Alexander Farrell estimates property
damage at $500 million.
   About 1,200 U.S. troops sent to quell widespread looting were
helping in the relief effort.
   On neighboring St. Thomas, capital of the U.S. Virgin Islands,
heavy overnight rains caused flash flooding, sending mud and water
into some homes already hit hard by the hurricane. There were no
reports of injuries from the flooding, however.

<HEAD>Art Gallery Trustees Want Controversy Over Exhibit's Cancellation
Defused</HEAD>

<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Trustees of the embattled Corcoran Gallery of
Art reaffirmed support Monday for director Christina Orr-Cahall and
ordered a study of ways to resolve a controversy over her
cancellation of an exhibit that included sexually explicit
photographs.
   The 120-year-old gallery, the oldest art museum in Washington,
has been the target of severe criticism since mid-June when Ms.
Orr-Cahall canceled an exhibition of Robert Mapplethorpe
photographs. The cancellation was made with the consent of the
Corcoran's board of trustees.
   The traveling exhibit, organized by the Institute of
Contemporary Arts in Philadelphia, contained sexually explicit and
homoerotic photographs and pictures of nude children, which drew
protests from Sen. Jesse Helms, R-N.C., and other conservative
members of Congress.
   At a regularly scheduled meeting Monday, the Corcoran board
agreed to appoint a special panel of trustees to examine the
three-month controversy and recommend steps to defuse it.
   Spokeswoman Debra Shriver said the panel would study ``concerns
of the museum'' such as ``the status of the director, staff morale
and future curatorial decisions.''
   There have been persistent rumors that Ms. Orr-Cahall might be
fired. But board president Freeborn G. Jewett Jr., who is general
counsel of the Inter-American Development Bank, said after Monday's
meeting ``there was substantial and widespread support for the
director among the trustees.''
   A representative of the Corcoran staff asked Ms. Orr-Cahall on
Friday to resign, but she refused.
   Ms. Orr-Cahall has said consistently that the Mapplethorpe show
was canceled in the hope of preventing the Corcoran from becoming
involved in a congressional dispute over the grant-making policies
of the National Endowment for the Arts, which had partially
financed the Mapplethorpe show's national tour.
   But as the Corcoran noted last week, in a statement issued by
Ms. Orr-Cahall and the board's executive committee: ``The Corcoran
Gallery of Art, in attempting to defuse the NEA funding controversy
by removing itself from the political spotlight, has instead found
itself in the center of controversy.''
   The board and the director said the Mapplethorpe cancellation
had ``inadvertently offended many members of the arts cmmunity,
which we deeply regret.''
   The statement added that the Corcoran's ``course in the future
will be to support art, artists and artistic freedom of
expression.''
   The cancellation resulted in a firestorm of criticism against
the Corcoran and Ms. Orr-Cahall, who joined the gallery 18 months
ago from the Oakland Museum in California, where she was chief
curator and director of the art division.
   Artists protesting the cancellation as a violation of freedom of
artistic expression withdrew plans for two exhibitions of
contemporary art at the Corcoran, and a third exhibition is in
doubt. Artist Lowell Nesbitt announced he is withdrawing a $1.5
million bequest to the Corcoran from his will and instead will give
the money to the Phillips Collection, another private Washington
art gallery.
   Low morale among Corcoran staff members worsened recently when
Jane Livingston, the museum's chief curator, announced her
resignation effective in January. She had arranged for the
Mapplethorpe exhibit to be shown at the Corcoran after it appeared
in Philadelphia and Chicago without incident.

   Striking musicians said Monday they have
rejected a ``final offer'' from five Las Vegas casino-hotels that
want the right to replace live music in some shows with recordings.
   Several celebrities have refused to appear at the strike-bound
hotels because of the dispute.
   Some 150 members of Musicians Local 369 met Sunday to learn
details of the offer, made Thursday.
   ``We took it to the membership yesterday, not for a formal vote,
but to see their general feelings,'' said Mark Tully Massagli,
Local 369 president. ``Their reaction was loud and strong. This is
a piece of garbage. We don't want to dignify it with a vote.''
   The union's contract with the Las Vegas Hilton, Flamingo Hilton,
Tropicana, Bally's and Caesars Palace ran out June 1.
   Sticking points include the use of recorded music and the number
of weeks of guaranteed work for musicians playing for star
performers.
   Massagli held out hope of more talks but a hotel executive said
he would negotiate no further.
   ``I've got $385 million in construction projects,'' said John
Giovenco, president of Hilton Nevada Corp., which operates two of
the struck resorts. ``At this point I could care less about the
musicians.''
   Wayne Newton, Dean Martin, Rodney Dangerfield, Connie Francis,
Dionne Warwick, Burt Bacharach and Bill Medley have refused to
perform at Caesars, Bally's and the Las Vegas Hilton.

<TEXT>
   Reconstruction of 54 war-damaged cities
has been completed 13 months after the guns fell silent in the
Persian Gulf conflict, Iran's Islamic Republic News Agency reported
Monday.
   Work on 11 cities, including the major centers of Abadan, a huge
oil-refining complex, and Khorramshahr, Iran's major port before
the outbreak of the war in 1979, will be completed within two
years, the agency added.
   The agency, monitored in Nicosia, quoted Hamid Mirzadeh, the
vice president for executive affairs, as saying 77,927 urban and
rural houses and business premises damaged in the eight-year war
were rebuilt or repaired this year. Work on 50,000 more will be
completed by the end of the year, he added.
   Reconstruction started soon after a United Nations-sponsored
cease-fire took effect in August 1988. Final costs are estimated at
$400 billion.
   Foreign correspondents who visited Iran's western border
provinces a few months after the cease-fire, where many cities were
flattened or heavily damaged, reported the entire region looked
like a construction project.
   An estimated 1 million Iranians were displaced during the war.
Many of them started returning to their cities as soon as the
fighting ceased to join in the reconstruction.

   The Bush administration is not prepared to
move toward normal relations with Vietnam, despite the apparent
completion of that country's troop withdrawal from Cambodia, State
Department officials said Monday.
   The officials said the administration would have been prepared
to move toward that goal if there had been an agreement on a
comprehensive settlement in Cambodia.
   They blamed ``Vietnam's intransigence'' for the failure of the
Cambodia peace conference this past July in Paris to reach a
settlement on new political arrangements for that country once
Hanoi's withdrawal was complete.
   Vietnam has said the last of its remaining 26,000 troops were to
have been out of Cambodia by Tuesday.
   ``We believe normalization with Hanoi would be premature,'' said
one official, asking not to be identified.
   ``We hope that if we and other countries continue to minimize
diplomatic and economic ties with Vietnam, Hanoi will take a more
cooperative approach toward a comprehensive Cambodian settlement,''
the official said.
   The Vietnamese withdrawal leaves in place the Hanoi-backed
government in Phnom Penh, which failed in an effort to reach a
power sharing arrangement with three other Cambodian factions.
   The Bush administration has come under strong criticism from
members of Congress and elsewhere over its Cambodia policy on
grounds that the existing government Phnom Penh alone has the
strength to prevent the Khmer Rouge from retaking power.
   The Khmer Rouge, the most powerful of the factions contending
for power, are widely blamed for the murders of at least 1 million
Cambodians during their 3{ year rule between 1975-78.
   Asked about the prospect of a return to power by the Khmer
Rouge, State Department deputy spokesman Richard Boucher said
Monday this issue can best be dealt with through a process of
negotiation and a comprehensive political solution.
   ``Only such a solution can have the guarantees and the
interational peacekeeping force under the United Nations which will
minimize the danger of the Khmer Rouge,'' he said.
   Successive U.S. presidents dating back to Jimmy Carter have
linked the normalization of relations with Hanoi to its withdrawal
from Cambodia. U.S. policy also has taken into account Vietnam's
attitude on providing information on American servicemen still
missing from the Indochina War.
   Vietnam is one of a handful of countries with which the United
States has no diplomatic or trade relations.
   The United States has never recognized the Hanoi government
since what was then North Vietnam became independent in 1954. The
U.S. diplomatic presence in South Vietnam ended with the North
Vietnamese conquest of that country in 1975.

<HEAD>House Members Support Giving Up Newsletters</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   House members expressed willingness Monday to
give up free newsletter mailings to constituents and use the $45
million savings to treat pregnant women addicted to drugs.
   ``We really created a Frankenstein,'' said Rep. Silvio Conte,
R-Mass. ``The only way we're going to free ourselves from this
monster is to cut its head off ... and use it for something
worthwhile.''
   But Rep. Vic Fazio, D-Calif., who argued against the ban during
floor debate, was critical of the action.
   ``It's pure demagogy, but it's great politics,'' he said.
   The 245-137 non-binding vote didn't ban the mailings, but
instructed House conferees to support the prohibition as part of a
$1.95 billion money bill to run Congress in the next fiscal year,
which begins Oct. 1.
   ``This was not a vote to instruct the conferees so much as it
was a vote to ... pose for holy pictures,'' said Fazio, chairman of
the House Appropriations Committee on legislative appropriations.
   Fazio predicted a compromise would be reached because members
want to ``save their newsletter programs.''
   The Senate voted 83-8 on Sept. 7 for the same ban, approving an
amendment by Sen. Pete Wilson, R-Calif.
   ``Anyone who has read a congressional newsletter will understand
immediately we are not asking for the sacrifice of great
intellectual or informational exchange,'' said Rep. Lynn Martin,
R-Ill., arguing for the ban.
   Newsletters, she said, often are a ``taxpayer-funded political
advertisement for sitting members.''
   ``Are you willing to give up a congressional perk to combat drug
addiction in newborn babies?'' Conte asked in his motion to
instruct conferees. ``The frank has been abused.''
   Conte said that in fiscal 1988, which ended about a month before
congressional elections, the cost of newsletters rose steadily as

   An accused drug trafficker arrested in
Colombia is wanted on federal charges of running an operation that
shipped tons of the illegal drug methaqualone to this country,
officials said Monday.
   Carlos Humberto Gomez-Zapata was arrested over the weekend by
the Colombian Army, according to Justice Department officials.
   Justice Department spokesman David Runkel said that if the
department confirms his identity, it would likely seek the
extradition of Gomez-Zapata, who was indicted by a federal grand
jury in Florida in 1984.
   Drug Enforcement Adminstration spokesman Frank Shults said
Colombian authorities had, indeed, confirmed through fingerprints
that the suspect in custody is Gomez-Zapata.
   The indictment charges that Gomez-Zapata masterminded a drug
ring that shipped tons of methaqualone from West Germany and
Austria through Panama to Colombia, where it was then transported
illegally into the United States.
   The drug is also known as Quaaludes, a hypnotic depressant that
was believed by users to enhance sexual pleasure.
   The indictment was one of four returned by a federal grand jury
as a result of DEA's ``Operation Hammerhead,'' which the Justice
Department said identified 24 shipments of methaqualone pills and
powder totalling 54 tons of illegal drugs bound for this country.
   DEA agents seized 6{ tons of methaqualone powder in Canada, six
tons in Panama and nine tons of methaqualone tablets in the
Bahamas, according to a 1984 Justice Department news release on the
case.
   At the time, the department said the investigation had focused
on the Gomez-Zapata family of Barranquilla, Colombia. The
indictment charged that some of the defendants conspired to obtain
U.S. equipment and chemicals to set up a methaqualone laboratory to
make tablets for distribution in this country.
   Gomez-Zapata's two brothers, John Jairo Gomez-Zapata and Luis
Guillermo Gomez-Zapata were also charged and are fugitives.
   So far, 23 defendants have been convicted and are serving
sentences, said Diane Cossin, a spokeswoman for the U.S. attorney's
office in Miami, which prosecuted the cases. Seven defendants are
fugitives.
   One of the charges against Carlos Humberto Gomez-Zapata,
continuing criminal enterprise, carries a sentence of 10 years up
to life.
   The indictment also alleges that other shipments of the drug,
disguised as harmless chemicals, were sent through the Netherlands
to Canada.

   King Fahd pledged an unwavering war
on terrorists Monday, stressing his government's resolve to behead
whoever tries to undermine security in the holy places of Islam.
   His warning came at a Cabinet meeting, according to a statement
by Information Minister Ali al-Shaer that was distributed by the
official Saudi Press Agency.
   Mahdi Karrubi, the radical speaker of Iran's parliament, on
Monday reiterated his call for retribution against Saudi Arabia for
last week's beheading of 16 Kuwati Shiite Moslems convicted of
planting bombs in the holy city of Mecca.
   The July 10 bombings came at the height of the Moslem pilgrimage
season in Mecca, killing one pilgrim and wounding 16.
   The doomed Kuwaitis said in a recorded confession broadcast last
week on Saudi television that they received sabotage training from
Iranians in a remote area of Kuwait. They said two Iranians at the
Iranian Embassy in Kuwait provided them with explosives and timing
devices.
   Iran denied it.
   On Monday, Fahd said, ``The kingdom will not retreat as much as
a hair's breadth from exacting Hodood (God's punishment) ... on
whoever tries to tamper with the sanctity of the Islam's holiest
shrines or tries to undermine security in the country.
   ``We will accept no blame in our quest to uphold justice. We
will not heed the false propaganda campaigns,'' he said, referring
to anti-Saudi pronouncements from Iran.
   Saudi Arabia is governed by Sharia, Koranic law that prescribes
beheading for convicted murderers, saboteurs and whoever desecrates
holy shrines. The punishments are known as Hodood, which also
sentences adulterers to death by stoning and thieves to having a
hand cut off.
   Saudi authorities said the bombs in Mecca were planted by a
group identified as Kuwaiti nationals, most of them of Iranian
extraction. Sixteen were executed in Mecca on Thursday, four
sentenced to jail and nine acquitted.
   Al-Shaer quoted Fahd as noting that executive authorities do not
influence the Islamic courts, which handed down the death
sentences, but ``is limited to carrying out'' such sentences.
   In Iran, Karrubi said Saudi Arabia must expect ``vengeance'' for
beheading the 16. In Kuwait, groups of Shiites tried to demonstrate
in front of the Saudi Embassy but were dispersed by police.
   Tehran radio, monitored in Cyprus, said that in a statement
released Monday, Karrubi said a mourning ceremony will be held
Thursday for the ``Kuwaiti martyrs'' at the shrine of the late
Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini on the outskirts of Tehran.
   He told the Iranian Parliament on Monday that ``revolutionary
Moslems will deliver the appropriate response for this crime,'' the
radio said.
   The executions have become a cause celebre for Iranian radicals
who oppose normal ties between Tehran and Riyadh.
   Iranian pragmatists, led by the newly elected President Hashemi
Rafsanjani, had been moving to ease a Tehran-Riyadh rift dating
from July 1987 when more than 400 pilgrims, most of them Iranians,
were killed in clashes with Saudi security forces in Mecca.

   An elementary school principal who was
involved with the same male prostitute as Rep. Barney Frank,
D-Mass., has resigned, a school official said Monday.
   Gabriel Massaro's resignation as principal of Chevy Chase
Elementary School is effective immediately, said Superintendent
Harry Pitt.
   ``Had Dr. Massaro not resigned, I do not believe I could have
recommended his continued employment because I concluded from our
investigation that he compromised the security of his school,''
Pitt said.
   However, Pitt said the investigation ``found no evidence of
criminal conduct on Dr. Massaro's part, nor any evidence of
improper conduct involving children or other staff members.''
   Massaro told The Washington Times that he had a four-year
relationship with prostitute Stephen L. Gobie.
   Gobie said Massaro allowed him at night to use a guidance
counselor's office, from which he made telephone calls to set up
appointments for his prostitution service.
   Frank has said he paid Gobie for sex, then hired him with
personal funds to work for him. Gobie has alleged that he used
Frank's Capitol Hill apartment for prostitution with the
legislator's knowledge.
   Frank said he fired Gobie after becoming suspicious of the man's
activities, but denies he had any concrete evidence that his
apartment was being used for prostitution.
   Massaro has worked in the school system since 1978, first as a
curriculum specialist and later as an elementary school principal.
Since 1987, he has been principal at Chevy Chase Elementary, which
has about 360 pupils in grades 3-6.
   Massaro was immediately suspended after the initial newspaper
report and was on administrative leave with pay during the
four-week investigation.
   There was no answer at Massaro's home Monday evening.

   Annette Lemieux, a contemporary artist, did
not intend to display any works produced with the support of
government funds at a Corcoran Gallery show that she withdrew in
protest.
   Ms. Lemieux is not a current recipient of federal funds,
although she has twice before in her career received grants from
the National Endowment for the Arts, most recently in 1987.
   Gallery officials announced late last month that Ms. Lemieux had
withdrawn a one-woman show scheduled for Oct. 28. to Dec. 31 in
response to the Corcoran's cancellation in June of an exhibit of
150 photographs by the late Robert Mapplethorpe, who died last
March from AIDS.
   In a story on Aug. 30 about the withdrawal of her show, the
Associated Press reported that Ms. Lemieux's work was supported by
the federal government through the NEA. The story did not make
clear that none of the works intended for that show was supported
by federal funds.
   Ms. Lemieux described the withdrawal of her show as an
``indefinite postponement ... until they (the Corcoran) demonstrate
a definite change in policy.''
   The Mapplethorpe exhibit, which included photographs of
children's genitalia, homoerotic and sadomachistic images, became
embroiled in a controversy over federal funding of sexually
explicit art through the National Endowment for the Arts.

   President Bush called on the United
Nations General Assembly on Monday to condemn the murder of one of
its own ``soldiers of peace:'' U.S. Marine Lt. Col. William Higgins.
   He also appealed again for the release of the body of Higgins,
murdered by terrorists who kidnapped him in Lebanon where he headed
the U.N. peacekeeping force.
   ``More than 700 peacekeepers have given their lives in service
to the United Nations'' in its 44-year history, Bush said.
   ``Today, I want to remember one of these soldiers of peace. An
American on a mission of peace under the U.N. flag; on a mission
for all the world. A man of unquestioned bravery and unswerving
dedication to the U.N. ideal: Lt. Col. William Richard Higgins.
   ``I call on the General Assembly to condemn the murder of this
soldier of peace and call on those responsible to return his
remains to his family,'' Bush said. ``And let us all right now,
right here, rededicate ourselves and our nations to the cause that
Col. Higgins served so selflessly.''
   Higgins' captors, the Revolutionary Justice Organization, said
July 31 it hanged him in retaliation for Israel's kidnapping of a
Moslem cleric, Sheik Abdul Karim Obeid.
   Higgins was kidnapped Feb. 17, 1988, and threatened with death
earlier by the terrorists.
   U.S. intelligence experts said in early August they were
convinced by a videotape released by the terrorists that Higgins
was dead, but it was not clear when or how he was killed.
   U.N. Secretary General Javier Perez de Cuellar sent a top deputy
to Lebanon in an unsuccessful effort to obtain the release of
Higgins' body.

   The Soviet Union said Monday it will slash
military spending by more than 8 percent and cut its huge deficit
in half in a 1990 ``crisis'' budget made necessary by the nation's
poor fiscal health.
   Finance Minister Valentin Pavlov used that wording as he
unveiled the proposed budget on opening day of the Supreme Soviet
legislature's fall session.
   The session's sweeping two-month agenda of about 80 bills
includes proposals to radically alter some traditional ways of
doing things in Soviet politics.
   Under dire need for more revenues and less expenses, the Kremlin
plans to implement a progressive income tax for Soviets earning 700
rubles ($1,076) or more a month _ more than three times the average
wage _ and float a $92 billion bond issue, the nation's first, to
help finance new construction, Pavlov told lawmakers.
   President Mikhail S. Gorbachev presided over the 542-member
Supreme Soviet, which reconvened at a time of widespread turmoil
and discontent caused by the often conflicting demands of the
country's more than 100 ethnic groups and the state economy's
failure to meet many basic needs.
   Many people were looking to the 4-month-old legislature for
solutions. It was given expanded powers and a full-time political
role by Gorbachev's drive for ``democratization.'' The legislators
met in a hall at the Kremlin and heard government officials give a
bleak assessment of recent economic performance.
   Deputy Premier Lev Voronin told them, ``The dynamism of the
economy this year has been steadily falling in many major areas,
social tension has increased and the national economy has been
losing its balance.
   ``Against the background of these trends, deficits on the
consumer market and in production have grown.''
   Trying to parry shortages of goods ranging from tea and meat to
salt and matches, the government plan for 1990 calls for a 20
percent increase in factory-made consumer goods, Voronin said, with
the total produced by converted defense plants growing by almost 35
percent to $61 billion.
   According to Pavlov, the government of Premier Nikolai I.
Ryzhkov plans to raise $83 billion in new revenues and trim
expenditures by $10.3 billion to cut by half the 1989 government
budget deficit of $192 billion next year.
   The resulting budget, including $750 billion in expenditures,
``is intended to overcome the crisis situation in finance,'' Pavlov
said.
   The Soviets cannot expect any help from foreign trade, he added.
Projected revenues in 1990 will decline by $3.9 billion from this
year. If no increase occurs in the selling price of oil and gas,
the Soviets' top exports, all the revenue they generate abroad will
go to pay off existing foreign debt, he said.
   He said the proposed 1990 budget is designed to shore up the
ruble and improve the inadequate social safety net now offered most
Soviets. Pensions for 60 million retirees will be increased by an
average of 15 percent, Pavlov said, but not enough rubles are
available to go to all who deserve them.
   Pensions are often woefully low.
   Cooperatives, whose output of goods and services is estimated to
reach $46 billion next year, will pay about $2.3 billion in taxes.
   The plan to cut military spending from $119 billion to $109
billion, or by 8.3 percent, is in keeping with a directive from the
Congress of People's Deputies to reduce defense spending by 14
percent by 1991, Pavlov said.
   The 2,250-member Congress, the nation's new parliament, elected
the membership of the Supreme Soviet from among its own ranks this
summer.
   Military research will be cut by $3.4 billion next year, Pavlov
said. He credited the Kremlin's ``realistic and constructive
foreign policy'' for the easing of world tensions that made defense
cuts possible.
   Many Western observers are wary of how the Soviets calculate
their defense expenditures, saying Kremlin bureaucrats can
arbitrarily raise or lower their prices.
   Likewise, Soviet officials last year presented a government
budget with a $58 billion deficit, but much of the shortfall was
hidden with accounting tricks. Later estimates put it more than
three times higher.
   The 1989 Soviet deficit _ officially said at one point to equal
$192 billion _ was more than the U.S. government's deficit for
fiscal 1989 of $161 billion, and relatively more serious because
the Soviet economy is much smaller than the American.
   The U.S. government's fiscal 1989 federal budget is $1.1
trillion.
   In other business, Gorbachev told the Supreme Soviet the
Moscow-based government will take firm steps to settle the dispute
over Nagorno-Karabakh if Armenia and Azerbaijan cannot end their
feud quickly. He did not elaborate.
   Gorbachev pushed the Supreme Soviet session to get down to work
immediately on the budget and not get bogged down in wrangling on
procedure.
   However, it took nearly an hour of debate before deputies agreed
to use a new electronic vote-tallying system rather than the
traditional raised hands way of counting votes.
   Gorbachev laughed, and told lawmakers to go back to ``tried and
true weapons.'' Like decades of Soviet legislators before them,
they raised their Supreme Soviet identification cards for a count.

   Government troops killed two Sinhalese
radicals and arrested 85 in a new crackdown, but officials appealed
Monday for other militants to surrender during a three-day
cease-fire later this week.
   Other ethnic clashes reportedly left four people dead.
   A government statement said the two radicals were killed and the
85 others arrested during search operations. It did not say exactly
when the operations were mounted.
   It said such activities would be suspended for three days
beginning Wednesday as part of a government effort to restore peace
to this nation torn by ethnic strife.
   The government has offered $512 to each Sinhalese radical who
surrenders with his weapon during the three days.
   There has been no response from Sinhalese extremists to the
government's offer.
   The Sinhalese government Monday distributed leaflets written in
Sinhalese saying, ``You are fighting a futile war in which many of
your colleagues have died and more more wounded.''
   Two Sinhalese brothers were also killed by the radicals in
central Nuwara Eliya district.
   Sinhalese radicals of the People's Liberation Front started
their violent campaign against the government after it signed a
peace accord with India in July 1987 to end a Tamil insurrection
for a separate homeland in the northeast. India deployed its troops
to enforce the agreement, but the leading Tamil group turned its
guns on them.
   In the north Monday, Indian troops shot and killed a Tamil rebel
after an Indian patrol was attacked at Pandatharippu village in
Jaffna, about 190 miles north of Colombo, an Indian diplomatic
spokesman said.
   It was the first death involving Indian troops since since
42,000 Indian peacekeeping troops suspended military offensives
against the rebels on Wednesday.
   India has said it will withdraw its troops by Dec. 31.
   The Indian spokesman, who spoke on condition of anonymity, also
said a Tamil civilian was killed by suspected Tamil rebels in the
Jaffna area.
   However, Tamil residents contacted by phone in Jaffna said the
victim, a Tamil student and postman, were killed when Indian troops
fired on a group of rebels pasting posters to commemorate the death
anniversary of a colleague.
   Sinhalese militants have objected to the presence of the Indians
troops, who they accuse of violating this country's sovereignty.
They also said the government has provided too many concessions to
the Tamils in an effort to end the minority uprising.
   Tamils make up 18 percent of Sri Lanka's 16 million people, and
Sinhalese about 75 percent.
   At least 5,000 people have died in the Sinhalese radicals'
campaign. Another 11,000 people have been killed since the Tamil
ethnic war started in 1983.

   The government is asking Poles for a loan,
issuing Treasury bills for the first time since World War II.
   However, the soaring inflation led the pro-Solidarity newspaper
Gazeta Wyborcza to advise readers that while the bonds may be
considered a way to support the new non-communist-led government,
it was not considered a savings investment.
   The government hopes to raise $289 million in the sale, which is
to begin Oct. 2. The bonds, paying an annual interest rate of about
86 percent, are redeemable within six months. Polish banks pay
about half that much in annual interest.
   Inflation last month however hit 50 percent after government
food price controls were lifted.

   President Bush, in his maiden presidential
address to the United Nations, offered measured praise for the
organization that he had pilloried on the campaign trail last year.
   ``No, the U.N. isn't perfect. It's not a panacea for the world's
problems,'' Bush told the opening session of the 44th General
Assembly. ``But it is a vital forum where the nations of the world
seek to replace conflict with consensus _ and it must remain a
forum for peace.''
   Bush, the Nixon administration U.N. ambassador in 1971-73, said
he has seen a shift in the international body.
   ``In recent years, certainly since my time here, the war of
words that has often echoed in this chamber is giving way to a new
mood. We've seen a welcome shift, from polemics to peacekeeping.''
   The president closed with an appeal to ``bring a unity of
purpose to the United Nations'' to spread peace and freedom
throughout the world.
   Last year, during his campaign against Democrat Michael Dukakis,
Bush took several rhetorical swipes at the U.N. and he accused
Dukakis of wanting to rely too much on the U.N. to resolve
international crises.
   In his acceptance speech at the Republican convention in New
Orleans on Aug. 18, 1988, Bush said Dukakis ``sees America as
another pleasant country on the U.N. roll call, somewhere between
Albania and Zimbabwe. I see America as the leader, a unique nation
with a special role in the world.''
   Elsewhere on the campaign trail, Bush said: ``You've got to
understand that it is only the United States that can stand for
freedom and democracy around the world, and we can't turn it over
to the United Nations or other multilateral organizations.''
   He also said the U.N. was ``torn by tensions'' and called it
``an unreal place where the Maldive Islands has the same votes as
the United States.''
   In his 1987 autobiography, ``Looking Forward,'' Bush wrote:
   ``Like most Americans who had idealistic hopes for the United
Nations when it was created in 1945, I'd undergone a sea change in
attitude by the early 1970s. As `the last best hope for peace' the
U.N. was another light that failed.''
   But Bush added that it ``still serves a valuable purpose. It may
be largely ineffective _ and sometimes counterproductive _ in the
political area. But U.N. peace-keeping forces have performed well.''
   He said U.N. contributions in science, medicine, agriculture,
space and humanitarian efforts ``have been indispensable.''

<HEAD>Defense Witness Says Officer Forceful During Actress' Arrest</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JEFF WILSON</BYLINE>

   Zsa Zsa Gabor slapped a policeman
in self-defense after he forcefully pulled her from her
Rolls-Royce, a screenwriter testified Monday at the actress' trial.
   ``That man was after blood I think,'' said David Katzman, a
free-lance writer who has written for television's ``Knots
Landing'' and ``Dallas.''
   ``He reached in with his left hand and grabbed Miss Gabor's
wrist. With his other hand he opened the car door,'' Katzman said
in relating the profanity-laced June 14 encounter between Miss
Gabor and Officer Paul Kramer.
   ``She was just as irate as he was. She was more frightened than
anything else. He was really hot. She reached up and slapped him.
He was more surprised than anything else,'' said Katzman, who was
called by the defense.
   Katzman said he stopped his car when he noticed the unusual
sight of a policeman pulling over a white Rolls-Royce Corniche, and
became concerned while he watched.
   ``The lady looked as if she was going to be threatened and as
though she would be hurt,'' he said.
   After describing the brief altercation that ended with Miss
Gabor's arrest, he said, ``I couldn't understand that because she
was half his size.''
   Monday opened the third week of the misdemeanor trial before a
Beverly Hills Municipal Court jury that has cost taxpayers more
than $22,000.
   Defense attorney William Graysen said new witnesses turned up
during the weekend and the case would likely go until Friday.
   Miss Gabor could receive up to 18 months in jail if convicted of
misdemeanor battery on a police officer, disobeying an officer,
driving with an expired license and having an open container of
alcohol in her car.
   The day began with Miss Gabor bounding from her car to tell
reporters about upsetting letters she received during the weekend
regarding an earlier out-of-court remark that she was afraid of
going to jail because there were lesbians in there.
   ``I have nothing against gays or lesbians. I have lots of gay
boys working for me,'' Miss Gabor said. ``I got letter from the
lesbians and gay association. They are going to boycott me because
I said there are lesbians in jail. How do I know who's in jail?
Imagine a women's jail. There must be lesbians .... Maybe I should
become a lesbian. What do I know? I like men.''
   Miss Gabor claims she acted in self-defense because the officer
cursed her and dragged her from her car after he spotted expired
registration tags on the car.
   Prosecutors contend that after Kramer stopped Miss Gabor, she
drove away while he was checking for other violations and that she
slapped him when he pulled her over a second time.

<HEAD>Northwest House Members Present New Plan To Key Subcommitte Chairman</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LES BLUMENTHAL</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Pacific Northwest lawmakers on Monday
presented a key House subcommittee chairman a plan they hope can
break the impasse over legislation designed to begin protecting the
northern spotted owl and allow continued logging in the region's
old-growth forests.
   While the lawmakers declined to discuss the plan in detail, they
indicated it would require ``expedited'' court review of timber
sales planned in the Northwest's federal forests and hinted it may
include a slight drop in the sales level envisioned in earlier
proposals.
   ``I'm not prepared to rush into anything,'' Illinois Democratic
Rep. Sidney Yates, chairman of the House interior appropriations
subcommittee, said after an hour meeting with Rep. Norm Dicks,
D-Wash., and Rep. Les AuCoin, D-Ore., both members of the
subcommittee.
   Northwest lawmakers consider Yates' support essential if they
are going to gain the support of a House-Senate conference
committee now scheduled to meet Wednesday and avoid a fight on the
House floor. Yates is the House chairman of the conference
committee and Dicks and AuCoin are members.
   Yates has been an outspoken critic of a Senate-passed plan that
would prohibit federal courts from enjoining timber sales over the
next year in forests known to contain spotted owls.
   ``I heard language that makes me hopeful we can come to an
agreement,'' said Yates. He said he was not sure agreement could be
reached before the meeting.
   Lawmakers were searching for a compromise that would assure
Northwest mills of a stable supply of timber over the next 12
months while the Fish and Wildlife Services decides whether the owl
should be protected as a threatened species. Such a designation
would require protection of its habitat, the old-growth forest.
   Environmentalists have launched an all-out lobbying campaign to
defeat the Senate plan, which they charge would severely restrict
their access to the courts where they have won injunctions that at
one point halted more than half of the timber sales planned in the
region's federal forests this fiscal year.
   The timber industry supports the Senate plan, but insists it
will fail unless it includes restrictions on court appeals.

   A week after Hurricane Hugo plowed across the northeastern
Caribbean, the islands are still working to repair snapped power
and communication lines, to restore water service and to provide
relief to tens of thousands of homeless people. Here's an
island-by-island look at the cleanup efforts by Monday:
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   PUERTO RICO: Gov. Rafael Hernandez Colon estimated damage at $1
billion. Police said seven people were killed, up more than earlier
reports. Estimates from governmment agencies said 25,000 to 53,000
families out of 750,000 were left homeless. Officials were handing
out $300 emergency checks to homeless families. About one-fourth of
Puerto Rico's 3.3 million people were still without water, and 30
percent of the island without power. Two U.S. Navy destroyers
arrived Monday with 20,000 gallons of fresh water. Tourist
officials said hotel damage was mostly superficial and predicted a
quick recovery.

<TEXT>
   U.S. VIRGIN ISLANDS: Lt. Gov. Derek Hodge said at least four
people were killed in St. Croix, but the Red Cross reported six.
Gov. Alexander Farrell estimated property damage at $500 million on
St. Croix, which was hardest hit. Troops sent in last week to
control looting were participating in the relief effort. The Coast
Guard reported it had stopped fuel oil from seeping into a St.
Croix harbor, but the leaky tank it came from was still leaking oil
at a rate of 42,000 gallons a day. Unofficial government reports
estimated 45,000 of St. Croix's 53,000 residents were without
housing.

<TEXT>
   BRITISH VIRGIN ISLANDS: No casulties reported, but power and
communications were knocked out. On the resort island of Tortola,
residents said there were some injuries, and scores of homes and
some inns were destroyed.

<TEXT>
   GUADELOUPE: French government officials reported five killed in
the hurricane and six in the crash of a rescue helicopter, 84
injured and more than 15,000 homeless on the French island of
340,000 people. Roofs were torn off, power lines downed and crops
damaged. The Defense Ministry of France assigned 3,000 soldiers,
two military transports aircraft, and four cargo vessels to assist
in restoring communications and emergency services.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   ANTIGUA: The government reported one person killed and
widespread wind and rain damage. Earlier reports said two were
killed. A government emergency committee estimated $90 million in
property damage and 420 people homeless out of the population of
85,000. Power, water and telephone service were severely damaged
but expected to be restored by the weekend. Aid and relief
personnel were arriving from other Caribbean countries, the United
States and Canada.

<TEXT>
   MONSERRAT: Gov. Gen. Christopher Turner reported 10 people
killed and 30 percent of buildings flattened on this British
island. Damages estimated at $100 million. The British Government
said nearly all the 12,000 residents were left homeless. British
officials pledged $1.57 million in emergency aid.

   Rock 'n' roll and rap musicians rallied across
the street from the White House on Monday to protest groups they
say want to censor their music.
   ``I think the framers of our Constitution would not have wanted
to create a constitutional revolution where you couldn't rap and
you couldn't rock and you couldn't roll,'' Barry Lynn of the
American Civil Liberties Union told about 200 people in Lafayette
Square.
   Attending the rally, held on the 200th anniversary of Congress
sending the Bill of Rights to the states for ratification, were
Joseph Simmons of the rap group Run DMC and Vernon Reid of Living
Colour. Statements from Frank Zappa and Bruce Springsteen were read.
   The musicians' principal target was the Parents' Music Resource
Center, a non-profit group that has been critical of what it
considers violent and suggestive lyrics.
   Among leaders of the Arlington, Va.-based group are Tipper Gore,
wife of Sen. Albert Gore Jr., D-Tenn., and Susan Baker, wife of
Secretary of State James A. Baker III.
   ``They are never going to be happy until the only thing that
they see or hear is the America that they wish were out there, the
America that fits their cultural standards,'' Lynn said.
   Jennifer Norwood, executive director of the Parents' Music
Resource Center, said Monday that her group does not advocate
censorship.
   ``We do not support legislation and we don't support
restrictions on popular music of any kind,'' she said.
   ``We do support our voluntary agreement with the recording
industry, which has been in effect since 1985. The individual
record companies ... decide which albums are the ones that get the
consumer information. We don't play a role in that decision-making
process.''
   The consumer information can include lyrics printed on album
covers so parents can decide if they find the music's message
objectionable.
   Dave Marsh, master of ceremonies for the rally, said musicians
should be able to ``sing about drugs and the gang culture and
teen-age sexuality and a whole list of issues that need to be sung
about and talked about.''
   He said Music in Action, a group that opposes Mrs. Gore's
organization, had gathered 50,000 signatures protesting the
activities of the parents' group.
   ``When we first did our concerts and this woman Tipper Gore ...
said that it was our fault that people fight and do things like
that because she didn't have anything better to say,'' said
Simmons, known professionally as Run.
   Living Colour's Reid said the parents' group was involved in
``an attack on the creative impulse.''
   ``Say somebody is writing a song that talks about sexual
politics ... and in the course of that song they use profanity to
express their anger about something,'' he said. ``If the censorship
groups prevail, that artist will think twice about the kind of
lyrics he is writing.''

<HEAD>SWAPO Violence Condemned but Understandable, Says Church</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An Anglican church group that visited Namibia said
on Monday that violence within the groups fighting for the
independence of that southern African country was deplorable but
understandable.
   ``We are aware that there have been incidents of denial of human
rights and the use of torture among and within groups struggling
for liberation,'' said a statement from the group, headed by
Archbishop Edward Scott, former primate of the Anglican Church of
Canada.
   ``As church people we condemn such violations of human rights
and the use of torture wherever it occurs. Where it has occurred it
needs to be acknowledged and those responsible held accountable.''
   Dissidents said security forces of SWAPO, the Southwest Africa
People's Organization, tortured and killed fellow Africans who
questioned or opposed the SWAPO leadership headed by Sam Nujoma.
   Scott's group was in Namibia Sept. 10-22. It was sent by
Archbishop of Canterbury Robert Runcie, the Anglican leader. The
Anglican Communion worldwide has 70 million members.
   Namibia is to hold independence elections in November,
supervised by the U.N. Transitional Assistance Group. Namibia's
population is 1.5-1.8 million.
   ``SWAPO terror is a substantial problem and it needs to be
addressed,'' said Scott, adding: ``War is a dirty business.''
   He said SWAPO had reasons for its suspicion because it, he said,
undoubtedly had been penetrated by South African spies.
   But he said the question could not be considered in isolation
from ``apartheid and violence,'' which he said has characterized
South Africa and its rule in Namibia, as Southwest Africa is now
known.
   The territory was a German colony from 1884 until it was taken
over in 1915 by South Africa.
   Scott said difficulties there rose essentially from ``105 years
of external control and the incredible brutality and illegal
occupation by the South Africans.''
   He said he was ``cautiously optimistic'' that elections in
Namibia would be free and fair and that a stable government would
be established.
   Scott reported to Runcie at his Lambeth Palace residence in
London on Monday.
   Lutherans, Anglicans and Roman Catholics are the majority
churches in Nambia.
   Among the members of Scott's group was H.K. Allen, U.S.
Episcopal Church layman and former vice chairman of the U.S.
Export-Import Bank.

   Eight gold miners have died in a
landslide that covered an open pit in Venezuela's Amazon region,
police said Monday.
   Five bodies had been found by late Monday, and civil defense
patrols continued their search for the remaining three, the
Venezuelan news agency Venpres reported. Two of the dead were
Colombians, it said.
   The miners were working in an open pit in the El Dorado region,
about 440 miles from Caracas, during the landslide caused by heavy
seasonal rains, a spokesman for the Venezuelan police in Caracas
said.
   Police said the miners died Saturday.
   There are 40,000 gold miners working in southern Venezuela.
   Environmentalists have warned that such accidents are likely
because of the primitive systems set up to mine metals in the area.

   A former official at the Irish Embassy pleaded
guilty Monday to charges he provided falsified passports to
foreigners in return for cash and sex. Southwark Crown Court
sentenced Kevin McDonald to 21 months in jail.
   Witnesses told the court that McDonald, 35, charged up to
$24,000 for a passport normally available for $100, and he made
$400,000 in six months.
   McDonald, who was the chief passport officer for the Irish
Embassy in London, pleaded guilty to conspiring with other
unidentified people to obtain false passports between January 1986
and May 1987.
   ``In return for thousands of pounds, he supplied passports to
virtually anyone, no matter how bogus or sham their applications
were,'' said prosecutor Julian Bevan.
   The official also demanded sexual favors from Moroccan
prostitutes to whom he sold passports, the prosecutor said. He said
the official was photographed in bed with two of them.
   In sentencing McDonald, Judge Marcus Anwyl-Davies said the
official had breached the trust of his employers. The judge ordered
him to pay $5,680 in legal costs.
   Holding an Irish passport allowed McDonald's customers to stay
in Britain for an unlimited time and easily visit other countries,
said Bevan.
   He said Irish passports are granted legally to people with an
Irish parent or grandparent or others who are married to an Irish
citizen.
   McDonald put details from legitimate birth and marriage
certificates on application forms and used them to issue the false
passports, Bevan said.
   The scheme was exposed when a reporter from The People
newspaper, a London weekly, sent a South American woman posing as
the mistress of a wealthy businessman to see McDonald, accompanied
by a woman reporter. Their conversation was secretly recorded.
   When the story was published, McDonald fled to Dublin. He was
arrested in August 1988 and extradited to Britain for prosecution.
   The case also led to several trials last year of people
described as McDonald's customers and agents.
   One of his operatives, French-born Collette Raud, said at one of
the earlier trials that McDonald supplied passports to people from
Libya who might have been terrorists.

   Police patrols were doubled by Monday in a
drug-infested neighborhood where about a dozen off-duty soldiers
and reputed crack dealers fought a 30-minute gun battle.
   Hundreds of rounds from handguns, shotguns and semiautomatic
weapons were fired, witnesses said, but no one was hurt in Saturday
night's shootout. Police arrived, took the soldiers' firearms and
arrested two suspected dealers.
   The next day, scuffles broke out among a handful of supporters
of the Army Rangers and opponents, who said they were being falsely
accused of selling drugs. No serious injuries were reported.
   The gunfight between the Rangers from nearby Fort Lewis and 15
to 20 people police described as gang members happened outside a
home owned by Bill Foulk, a member of the special force.
   ``They shot at us, and we fired back,'' Foulk said Monday,
pointing across his front porch full of potted red geraniums and
dozing cats at a reputed crack house across the street.
   Foulk, 32, said the gang members had become upset earlier
Saturday that he was videotaping their activities from his
second-floor window. He said they threatened him and he called
fellow Rangers for help.
   The soldiers, armed with semiautomatic weapons and shotguns,
showed up at an anti-drug party Foulk held in his backyard Saturday
night, and soon the shootout erupted.
   Police Chief Ray Fjetland said the incident could have been
avoided had residents called police. But Foulk said police are too
slow to react, and must wait ``until shooting actually starts.''
   Army officials said they would wait for completion of a Tacoma
Police investigation before deciding whether disciplinary action
was warranted against the Rangers.
   But Maj. Clyde Newman, second-in-command of the 2nd Ranger
Battalion, said, ``From everything I am told by the city police,
the Rangers were right. They were having a party, and they were
attacked.''
   Residents of the house denied Sunday that they fired any shots
at the Foulk house. They also denied participating in drug deals,
although they said drug activity often occurs in front of the
house, The Morning News Tribune of Tacoma reported.
   Foulk said he and his neighbors see drug deals at the house day
and night.
   ``I bought this place two years ago for $10,000 after it was
abandoned. We're fixing it up and as far as I'm concerned, I think
this neighborhood is going to be restored to a decent place to
live,'' he said.
   A neighbor, 16-year-old Candy Harris, said the arrival of crack
cocaine dealers in the past two years has transformed the
tree-lined, working-class street into a dangerous place to walk.
``Now, most people are scared to be outside,'' she said.
   Police said suspected Crips gang member Frankie Lee Strickland,
20, was held for investigation of assault, and gang member Daniel
Lynn Vaughn, 21, was held for investigation of unlawful use of a
weapon. Police also said they confiscated two semiautomatic rifles,
one 12-gauge shotgun, eight semiautomatic handguns and one
.44-caliber Magnum revolver from the Rangers.

   Police said Monday they questioned eight Jewish
settlers on suspicion of firebombing Israeli property and stoning
settlers to stir up anti-Arab sentiment.
   In one instance, Israel radio said, settlers hurled a firebomb
at an Israeli-owned car near Ginot Shomron settlement in the West
Bank and in response, settlers from the Jewish enclave raided a
nearby Arab village and vandalized property. No one was hurt.
   Northern district police spokesman Gideon Arbel said eight
Israeli men and women settlers were detained Sunday and Monday.
   ``We have intelligence that the incidents in January and
February in Ginot Shomron and Ariel were carried out by residents
of Ariel,'' he said.
   The radio said some of those held belonged to a local committee
of the far right, pro-settlement Tehiya party, which holds three
seats in the Knesset, or parliament.
   Ron Nachman, mayor of the 7,000-member settlement 23 miles north
of Jerusalem, said the allegations are ``a bit of a fantasy. I just
can't believe it.''
   Ariel earlier required Arab workers to wear tags identifying
them as ``alien workers.''
   Israeli media also reported that Ariel settlers were leading
vigilante groups in the northern part of the West Bank.
   Masked assailants in the occupied Gaza Strip hacked to death a
Palestinian U.N. worker they believed was cooperating with Israeli
authorities, Arab reports said.
   They said Said Muhsen, 38, was axed to death in a U.N. clinic in
Rafah, where he worked as a secretary.
   He was the 120th Arab slain by fellow Palestinians since the
21-month-old uprising began, and the fifth killed in Rafah since
last week. At least 574 Palestinians were killed by soldiers or
Israeli civilians and 40 Israelis have died.
   Also in Rafah on Monday, Saed Hassan Abu Ali was severely beaten
by masked assailants while traveling to a government job. Hospital
officials reported he was critically injured.
   The army confirmed the slaying and beating.
   Nine Arabs were shot and wounded by soldiers in Gaza, including
one Palestinian who tried to attack a soldier with an ax, Arab
reporters said. One Palestinian was shot and wounded in the West
Bank, hospital officials said.
   The army spokesman's office said it was looking into the
incidents.
   Also Monday, the El Nasser Eye Hospital was re-opened in Gaza
City after the Israeli military government invested $300,000 to
renovate the building and buy new equipment. It is the only
facility in the Gaza Strip for treating eye injuries and diseases.
   In the Knesset, Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir's coalition
government easily defeated two motions of no confidence, one from
Tehiya calling for a rejection of the Egyptian peace plan, the
other from the left-wing Citizens Rights Movement calling for the
plan's adoption.
   The plan advocates trading occupied land for peace and an
Israeli-Palestinian meeting as a preliminary to negotiations.
   The right-wing Likud bloc has rejected both points. Likud's
coalition partner, the left-leaning Labor Party, supports the plan.
   The decision-making inner-Cabinet is to vote on the Egyptian
plan Oct. 4.
   Underground leaders of the uprising distributed on Monday a
leaflet that criticized, but did not reject, the Egyptian plan.

   Maroon, white and black ribbons were tied
to the empty desks of 20 students killed in the state's worst bus
accident as their classmates quietly returned to classes Monday.
   Only five students rode the route of Bus No. 6, which tumbled
into a water-filled pit after colliding with a delivery truck
Thursday on a two-lane road 15 miles from the Mexican border.
   Eighty students from Mission Junior High and Mission High School
were on the bus at the time of the accident, which the National
Transportation Safety Board is investigating.
   Of the 61 injured, six students and bus driver Gilbert Pena, 46,
remained hospitalized Monday at Mission General Hospital.
   Teachers hugged survivors who returned to classes. Mission
Junior High Principal John Abbenante began the day with an
emotional speech over the public address system.
   Abbenante read the names of 12 junior high students killed in
the wreck and asked students and teachers to join hands while he
prayed for the ``holy innocents'' who ``have a place reserved for
them in heaven.''
   A steady flow of students overwhelmed by emotion sought
consolation at crisis centers set up for the school's 826 students.
At the high school, counselors roamed the hallways and attended the
victims' classes.
   ``It's calm here, but kind of a sad calm,'' said Richard Shahan,
a Baptist minister on hand for students with other clergy.
   Classes were canceled Friday in the school district.
   The soft-drink delivery truck ran a stop sign and plowed into
the bus, causing it to fall into the 40-foot pit. Ruben Perez, the
driver of the truck, has told federal investigators his breaks
failed, but the NTSB has not identified a cause for the wreck.
   The school desks of the victims were adorned with ribbons of the
school's maroon and white colors. A strip of black was added to
signify mourning.
   During a seventh grade social studies class, Lupita Martinez,
13, sat in front of the desk formerly occupied by her 12-year-old
friend, Elda Patricia Cruz, the class secretary who was buried
Friday.
   ``I cried all weekend,'' Lupita said, but consoled herself with
the idea that, ``They're not going to be in this life now with
drugs and everything. They're with God now. They're safe.''
   Her teacher, Abe Gibbons, introduced Carlos Cantu, a counselor
from the nearby McAllen school district. Cantu told students it was
all right to think about their dead friends, talk about them and
feel sad.
   Juan V. Granados, who was in the social studies class, escaped
from the bus with only minor injuries.
   ``It's going to be hard, but we'll get over it,'' the
12-year-old said.

   France said Monday it has suspended its search for
more bodies of the 171 people killed when a French DC-10 exploded
over the Niger desert on Sept. 19. But investigators from France,
Chad and Niger still sought clues in debris scattered over a remote
area more than five miles long and a mile wide.
   Robert Paillasse, head of the investigation commission, told a
French TV interviewer he was sure an ``explosive substance'' in a
front cargo compartment caused the crash, but that it has not yet
been positively identified as a bomb.
   Paillasse said laboratory tests on wreckage are proceeding in
Paris to find out ``from the traces of combustion, which explosive
material was involved.''
   The plane exploded at an altitude of 30,000 feet about an hour
after taking off from N'Djamena, Chad, for Paris. Wreckage of the
UTA airline plane was scattered over the Tenere desert in
neighboring Niger, one of the most inaccessible spots on earth.
   In Paris, judicial sources said Investigating Magistrate
Jean-Louis Bruguieres officially asked France's counterespionage
police _ the Direction de la Surveillance du Territoire, or DST _
to aid in the probe.
   Bruguieres, an anti-terrorism specialist, heads the criminal
investigation.
   The sources spoke on condition of anonymity.
   Various unidentified callers to news media in Beirut and Paris
claimed responsibility for the crash, but none was verified. The
calls included the previously unknown Secret Chadian Resistance and
the Islamic Jihad, which is believed to hold Western hostages in
Lebanon.
   A Foreign Ministry spokesman declined to say precisely how many
bodies had been recovered when he announced abandonment of the
search on Monday.
   ``In the heat of the desert _ which averages ... (122 degrees) _
it is very unlikely that any parts of bodies may still be found. We
have searched the area very thoroughly, and brought back anything
that resembled human remains,'' he said, speaking on condition of
anonymity in keeping with government policy.
   ``All the bodies and parts of bodies have been transported to
Paris, where the Judicial-Medical Research Institute will try to
identify them. Autopsies will be performed, but we do not expect to
be able to identify more than about 100 of the bodies.''
   So far, only the bodies of the pilot and co-pilot and a few
other people recognizable by uniforms or distinctive marks have
been positively identified, he said.
   The plane was flying precisely along its scheduled route, and
preliminary analysis of flight data showed all systems on board
failed at the same instant, indicating an explosion.

   A fire broke out at dawn Monday on a
Danish ferry in the North Sea while most of its 650 passengers and
crew were asleep. Two Swedish passengers were reported killed and
up to 50 people injured.
   One news report said the fire was believed caused by sabotage.
   The 600-foot Tor Scandinavia was on its way from Goteborg, on
Sweden's western coast, to Harwich, on Britain's east coast, when
the blaze started, police said.
   ``I woke up from the smell of smoke in my cabin. No one came to
wake us up,'' said Karl Malmberg, a Swedish passenger.
   Witnesses said passengers calmly went to the rear of the ferry
and waited.
   The fire was under control within hours, and the Danish ferry
used its own engines to reach the Danish port of Esbjerg, 90 miles
to the east.
   Swedish national television quoted unidentified shipping
officials as saying the blaze, which started in a linen closet in
the front of the passenger deck, appeared to have been sabotage. It
gave no details.
   Police said initially that two people were killed, and 10 were
slightly injured.
   However, Danish national television said later that a total of
50 people were injured.
   It also said the two dead were Swedish passengers.
   However, authorities did not immediately release names and
nationalities of the victims. Most of the 540 passengers were from
Britain and Sweden.
   Danish national radio said Tor Scandinavia's communications
equipment was destroyed by the fire and that the crew was unable to
send out emergency signals. A passing ship saw smoke and alerted
Danish authorities, the report said.
   Three Danish rescue helicopters were dispatched and at least
nine ships, including the West German destroyer Hamburg, rushed to
the scene to help.
   The 14,893-ton Tor Scandinavia, owned by the Danish shipping
company Scandinavian Seaways, was on regular service on the
Goteborg-Harwich route.
   The vessel, which can carry 1,500 passengers and 400 cars, was
built in 1976 in Luebeck, West Germany, and is one of Scandinavia's
largest ferries with a swimming pool, a gym and a movie theater.

<UNK>Hinckley Letter Blames Jews</UNK>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Presidential assailant John Hinckley regards
Jews as ``the cause of most of the world's problems'' and says he
is Adolf Hitler's successor.
   In letters written in 1985 and 1986 and read Monday at a court
hearing, Hinckley said that he has developed a cult of women
followers who worship him.
   The letters were introduced by District of Columbia lawyers who
oppose Hinckley's request to be interviewed by reporters.
   Dr. Raymond Patterson, a forensic psychiatrist at St. Elizabeths
Hospital where Hinckley is confined, testified that Hinckley is
severely mentally ill.
   In a series of letters to a woman imprisoned in Oakdale, Iowa,
Hinckley called Hitler a `prophet'' and said that `I am his
successor.`
   `My movement has blacks and whites and everyone else except Jews
because I have a theory that they are the cause of most of the
world's problems and they are all Antichrists,'' Hinckley said in a
Sept. 9, 1985 letter.
   Psychiatrists treating Hinckley were unaware of the letters
until they were turned over by the U.S. attorney's office, which
got them from the Secret Service, Patterson testified.
   `I seem to have developed a cult of females who `worship' me but
you are special and I believe we will all be a loving and happy
`family' soon,'' Hinckley said in an Aug. 12, 1985 letter to the
woman.
   U.S. District Court Judge June Green is considering Hinckley's
request to conduct up to two interviews a month with reporters.
   Hinckley has been in St. Elizabeths ever since he was found
innocent by reason of insanity of attempting to kill President
Reagan in 1981. Reagan was wounded in the handgun attack.

<TEXT>
   Secretary of State James A. Baker III said
Monday he would try to set up a three-way meeting with the foreign
ministers of Egypt and Israel next week to find a way for Israel to
hold negotiations with Palestinian Arabs.
   Baker, at a news conference, praised both a proposal by Israeli
Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir for elections on the West Bank and in
Gaza to choose Palestinians for the talks and another by Egyptian
President Hosni Mujbarak that he select the Palestinians.
   President Bush, in New York for a speech to the U.N. General
Assembly, met separately with Israeli Deputy Prime Minister Shimon
Peres and Foreign Minister Moshe Arens.
   Mubarak wants Israel to commit itself in advance to surrendering
land in exchange for Arab recognition. Shamir is against the idea,
but Peres, who heads the Israeli Labor party, accepts the
proposition.
   The Palestine Liberation Organization, meanwhile, has dismissed
Shamir's plan as a ploy to prevent establishment of a state.
   Baker had intended to hold a three-way meeting this week in New
York with Arens and the Egyptian Foreign Minister, Esmet
Abdul-Meguid.
   But U.S. officals said the Egyptian had a schedule problem and
could not be there.
   ``I can't tell you exactly when the meeting will be held,''
Baker said. ``But I would suspect that within the course of the
next week we'll be able to arrange that meeting.''
   He said the Bush administration was still committed to Shamir's
proposal and said Mubarak's proposals are ``a potential way of
getting there.''

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The United States has so far refused to
promise $3 billion dollars it is expected to contribute to loans
for the poorest countries of the world, World Bank President Barber
Conable said Monday.
   The money would be the U.S. share of a $14.5 billion fund to be
lent out over three years to about 55 countries where the income of
the average citizen is little more than a dollar a day. It would be
distributed by the International Development Association, a World
Bank affiliate, in 40-year loans at less than 1 percent interest a
year, starting next July 1.
   ``Unfortunately, the United States was not in a position this
past week to advise its IDA partners of its ability to take an
appropriate share of a ... replenishment of this magnitude,'' said
Conable, a former U.S. Congressman.
   He spoke at a closed door meeting of the development committee
which brings together representatives of the World Bank and
International Monetary Fund, now holding their annual meetings in
Washington. A copy of his statement was distributed to reporters.
   The United States is also holding out against a proposal to make
a big increase in the $120 billion dollars now availale for the
IMF. French Finance Minister Pierre Beregovoy said earlier Monday
that he thought a compromise would eventually be reached on about
$80 billion in new money.
   About $16 billion of that would come from the United States but
unlike the IDA contribution, it would not be a charge on the
federal budget.
   IDA's money is replenished every three years. Congress is now
working on an appropriation of $975 million, the final U.S.
contribution to IDA for the current three-year period.
   The United States is the biggest giver among the 34 current
donor countries _ it provides more than one dollar out of every
five. Conable held out hope that the Bush administration would
change its mind about the IDA contribution at a meeting to be held
in Kyoto, Japan, in November.
   Discussing the proposed new three-year pool of $14.5 billion,
Conable said, ``to most members, agreement on this approximate
amount seems feasible and they have indicated their willingness to
take a reasonable share under the right circumstances.''
   A Bank official who spoke on condition he not be named said the
United States was the only holdout. Some other countries, however,
will make their contributions dependent on the U.S. contribution,
so that if the United States offers a smaller sum than expected,
they might reduce their contributions too.

   Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze will
travel to Nicaragua on Oct. 4, the first Soviet foreign minister to
visit that Central American country, a government spokesman and
Nicaragua's President Daniel Ortega said Monday.
   Vadim Perfiliyev, a Foreign Ministry spokesman, said the visit
coincides with the 10th anniversary of the establishment of
relations between the two countries.
   ``It is a very significant visit, a visit designed to take stock
of the relations and outline the prospects of relations for the
future,'' Perfiliyev said.
   In Managua, Ortega said only that Shevardnadze's visit will
``maintain and develop'' relations between the Soviet Union and
Nicaragua.
   Diplomatic sources said Shevardnadze's visit is related to
recent conversations between Bernard Aronson, the U.S. assistant
secretary of state for inter-American affairs, and the chief of the
Soviet foreign ministry's Latin Amerian department, Yuri Pavlov.
   Shevardnadze just wound up a series of meetings with President
Bush and Secretary of State James A. Baker III before the annual
meeting of the U.N. General Assembly in New York.
   Ortega made the Shevardnadze announcement after going to the
Electoral Council to official submit his name as presidential
candidate for the Sandinista National Liberation Front in next Feb.
25's elections.
   The Sandinista party nominated Ortega by acclamation on Sunday.
   Perfiliyev said the talks between Shevardnadze and Nicaraguan
leaders will focus on the situation in Central America ``and
measures of overcoming the crisis there.''

   Two dozen cities east of the Rocky Mountains reported record low
temperatures Monday and showers and thunderstorms produced heavy
rains in Florida and parts of Georgia and South Carolina.
   Morning lows generally were in the 30s and 40s east of the
Rockies. The low of 33 in Topeka, Kan., broke a 100-year-old record
and the low of 37 in Springfield, Ill., broke a record set in 1879.
   Among other record lows were 33 in Ozark, Ark., 43 in Waco,
Texas, and 25 in Binghamton, N.Y. Morning lows also were in the 30s
and 40s in the Rockies, while temperatures remained above 60
overnight in Florida, California and the Pacific Northwest and in
the 70s and 80s in the desert Southwest.
   The cold spot in the Lower 48 states Monday morning was West
Yellowstone, Mont., with a low of 22.
   Wet weather was confined to the Southeast, from Tennessee and
Mississippi to the southern Atlantic Coast. Showers and
thunderstorms produced heavy rain across northern Florida and parts
of Georgia and South Carolina. Apalachicola, Fla., received nearly
6 inches of rain in the 24 hours ending at 8 a.m. EDT.
   Other heavier rainfall totals for that 24-hour period were 2 2-3
inches in Mayport, Fla., and 2{ inches in Jacksonville, Fla., and
Brunswick, Ga.
   Showers and thunderstorms continued across much of that same
area early Monday afternoon, and the rain was expected to spread
northeastward. Nearly 2 inches of rain fell in Wilmington, N.C.,
and Atlanta, and 1} inches in Charleston, S.C., complicating that
city's efforts to recover from Hurricane Hugo's devastation.
   A small stream and urban flood watch was posted for late Monday
night and Tuesday for southern New Jersey and much of eastern
Pennsylvania.
   Clouds were over the north-central states, the Ohio Valley and
the Middle Atlantic Coast states, and much of the nation west of
the Rockies on Monday afternoon. Sunny skies prevailed across the
rest of the nation.
   Dense fog was reported over some of the coastal areas of
northern California early Monday morning.
   Temperatures were in the 50s and 60s across much of the nation
east of the Rockies on Monday afternoon. Clouds and rain were
keeping temperatures unseasonably cool in the Southeast.
   Another cold front crossing the upper Mississippi Valley and the
central Plains region Monday afternoon will keep much of the
central U.S. below normal in temperature.

   China continued its strong criticism of France
Tuesday, saying the French open-door policy toward Chinese
pro-democracy dissidents was ``brutal interference'' in China's
internal affairs.
   The Communist Party's People's Daily accused France of violating
U.N. and international laws. ``People can't help believing that,
under the pretext of upholding human rights, the very purpose of
the French government is to support the anti-Chinese government
activities.''
   The commentary came a day after the Foreign Ministry issued a
``strong protest'' to France over the staging in Paris of the
inaugural meeting of the Federation of Democracy in China, a group
headed by activists who fled China following the June 3-4 military
crackdown on the pro-democracy movement.
   Like the Foreign Ministry on Monday, The People's Daily asserted
that the federation leaders are criminals who tried to overthrow
the Chinese government, and that France was seriously threatening
Sino-French relations by harboring them.
   The French government ``has the cheek to brag that its
connivance and open support to the anti-Chinese government
activities of Yan Jiaqi and the like are for `safeguarding human
rights,''' it said, referring to the political scientist elected
chairman of the federation.
   But the Chinese government is strong and stable, it said, and
``any scheme to subvert the People's Republic will surely end up in
a daydream -- anyone who bets on a handful of national scums such
as Yan Jiaqi is doomed to fail.''
   The commentary noted that France was the first nation to declare
a freeze on high-level contacts and other sanctions following the
June suppression of dissent and these acts ``have led to a
deterioration of the Sino-French relations.''
   The daily also mentioned other recent cases of ``violent
terrorist activities'' against China, such as a two-hour occupation
of the Chinese Embassy education section in Paris in late June, an
attack on the office of China's airlines in Paris and the alleged
harassment by French border police of Chinese officials traveling
through France.
   ``All these could hardly be viewed as isolated and accidental,''
the daily said. ``The Chinese government has done nothing unfair to
the French government, while the latter is going further in
poisoning the bilateral relations.''
   It said the late President Charles de Gualle had shown
``foresight and sagacity'' in establishing relations with China 25
years ago. ``We do not want to see the door closed again only
because of the short-sightedness and recklessness of some people.''

   The party's Central Committee met
Monday in the communists' worst crisis since taking power in 1948,
and Premier Miklos Nemeth was quoted as saying he made a mistake in
agreeing to join party leadership.
   The meeting was to prepare for a party congress starting Oct. 6
that may lead to a split in party ranks. The congress was
originally scheduled for next year but was advanced because of the
immense political changes under way in Hungary.
   The closed-door session, presided over by party chairman Rezso
Nyers, discussed a draft manifesto to be presented to the congress
for debate that advocates a multiparty system in Hungary and a
balanced distribution of power.
   A brief communique issued after the meeting of the policy-making
Central Committee said the talks were marked by ``lively and
extensive debate,'' but gave no details, indicating considerable
disagreement among party factions.
   The state news agency MTI said 1,276 delegates were elected to
the congress.
   In an interview with MTI, Nemeth, a reformer who is also on the
four-member Presidium, gave an indication of how deep the rifts are
by saying even the four could not agree on all issues.
   Although it was a mistake for him to have joined the party
leadership, he was quoted as saying, its mandate was only to lead
the party until the party congress so it was not worth considering
leadership changes now.
   According to MTI, Nemeth indicated he was prepared for a split
in party ranks, saying he would ``do everything possible for the
organization of a renewed party after the forthcoming congress
which is aware that its fate at the elections will be decided ...
on the basis of the government's performance.''
   Nemeth said he supported a broad, coalition government after the
elections that includes ``all major political forces.''
   Parliament is due to begin debate on Tuesday on key draft
legislation toward a peaceful transition to a multiparty democracy
that was agreed upon by the communist party and the opposition.
   In weekend speeches, reformers and conservatives highlighted the
widening differences between the various factions of the Communist
Party, which is officially called the Hungarian Socialist Workers
Party.
   Ivan T. Berend, president of the Hungarian Academy of Sciences
and a Central Committee member, said in an article published in the
party daily Nepszabadsag that ``the confusion within the party is
chaotic.''
   Politburo member Imre Pozsgay, a party reformer and Presidium
member, said in an Italian TV interview the party should discard
``the organizational principle called `democratic centralism.' In
our endeavors, we feel related to the social parties of Western
Europe.''
   He said Sunday the party would call itself simply a socialist
party after the congress and would no longer be ``a Communist Party
in the Bolshevik and Stalinist sense of the word.''
   Party conservatives have expressed fears Hungary's reforms could
lead it out of the Soviet sphere of influence and mean the end of
socialism in Hungary.
   Nemeth said no danger exists that Hungary would leave the
Soviet-led Warsaw Pact alliance.
   Referring to remarks by parliament speaker Matyas Szueros that
Hungary would like a neutral status in Europe, Nemeth said this was
not in the interest of Washington and Moscow, MTI reported.
   ``It would disrupt the European balance of power, destabilizing
the region,'' he was quoted as saying. ``Therefore, no single
Western power is encouraging us to do this.''
   Nemeth said Hungary could become neutral only if NATO and the
Warsaw Pact were dismantled and both superpowers supported the
move. He said this could happen ``in the foreseeable future.''

   HIGHWAY 1, Cambodia (AP) _ Thousands of Vietnamese soldiers
jammed the main highway in Indochina on Monday night as they snaked
toward the border on the eve of Vietnam's pledged exit from a
nearly 11-year-old war.
   Soviet-made armored personnel carriers, American-made trucks,
jeeps and artillery and Chinese ``Liberation'' troop transport
vehicles clogged the 20-foot-wide stretch of highway for 120 miles
from Cambodia's capital, Phnom Penh, to the Vietnamese border.
   Traffic on the road that Vietnam used as one of its main
invasion in December 1978 came to a standstill.
   Soldiers, stripped to their undershorts, hung hammocks under
trucks, cooked rice by the side of the road, and draped their
laundry from anti-aircraft guns on the final night before the
border crossing begins.
   ``I am very happy to be returning home to my family,'' said one
soldier from Thai Binh province. ``I have been in Cambodia for 10
years and seen my wife only three times.''
   Peasants gathered by the side of the road and waved to the
troops, whose uniforms were decorated with flowers and medals.
Speakers set up for the occasion blared the Vietnamese-Cambodian
``friendship'' song and patriotic speeches, which were prepared for
the government-orchestrated ceremony.
   Starting Tuesday, Vietnamese troops will return home overland,
by ferry on the Mekong River and via the Gulf of Thailand.
   Vietnam says it is withdrawing the last 26,000 of its troops in
Cambodia and ending its occupation of its Southeast Asian neighbor.
   The Cambodian resistance movement calls the pullout a sham, but
already Khmer Rouge guerrillas have attacked a town in western
Cambodia in an apparent attempt to challenge the Cambodian army, no
longer aided by Vietnamese troops.
   In Washington, State Department deputy spokesman Richard Boucher
said Monday that although the Vietnamese occupation is apparently
ending, ``We believe that Vietnam cannot evade its responsibility
to help achieve a comprehensive political solution in Cambodia.''
   As for the prospect of a return to power by the communist Khmer
Rouge, Boucher said this problem can best be dealt with through
negotiations and a comprehensive political solution.
   On Monday, Khmer Rouge radio broadcasts monitored in Bangkok
claimed the guerrillas had seized a ``strategic position'' on the
road from the western town, Pailin, to the provincial capital of
Battambang.
   Cambodian officials acknowledged recently that Khmer Rouge
guerrilla forces occupy parts of the gem-rich area near Pailin. But
Premier Hun Sen predicted that the rebels would be unable to hold
their ground.
   Cambodian officials and a Soviet military observer said the two
sides were throwing their best divisions at each other in Pailin.
They said the Khmer Rouge was raining up to 2,000 mortar shells a
day on the town.
   The battle has raised fears that Cambodia will slide into civil
war after Vietnam's soldiers are gone. Many Cambodians say they are
worried the government army will be unable to stand up to the Khmer
Rouge.
   Cambodians have begun stockpiling rice in some cities for fear
that guerrilla forces may cut supply lines, sending the price of
rice up at least 200 percent.
   Ethnic Vietnamese, who fear persecution under the Khmer Rouge,
also have reportedly begun fleeing back to Vietnam.
   The Khmer Rouge seized power in 1975 from American-backed Gen.
Lon Nol after a civil war. It ruled Cambodia from 1975 to 1978 and
killed hundreds of thousands of people in practicing an
ultra-radical form of agrarian communism.
   Vietnam invaded Cambodia in December 1978 and ousted the Khmer
Rouge, replacing it with a government to its own liking.
   Since then, the conflict has been stalemated.
   China supplies the Khmer Rouge with weapons, and Thailand allows
the guerrilla group to use its territory. The Soviet Union and
Vietnam supply Cambodia with arms. Peace talks failed in Paris last
month.
   Earlier Monday, thousands of Vietnamese soldiers in personnel
carriers and tanks rolled past the Royal Palace in Phnom Penh as
the Vietnamese army made what it said was its last exit from the
capital.
   School children were brought to the central square to bid the
Vietnamese invaders farewell.
   Soldiers rolled by in American-made equipment captured from the
United States during the Vietnam War. A long line of Dodge buses,
``Saigon Express'' written on their sides, led the convoy.
   Heng Samrin, president of the Vietnamese-installed government,
thanked the commanders of two departing divisions and hailed ``the
revolutionary friendship of the Cambodian and Vietnamese peoples.''

   President Bush on Monday declared a state of
disaster in hurricane-ravaged North Carolina, making four hard-hit
counties eligible for federal assistance.
   The region blasted by Hurricane Hugo last week includes the
counties of Gaston, Lincoln, Mecklenburg and Union.
   The disaster declaration, announced in a statement released by
the White House staff with Bush in New York for a United Nations
appearance, said that further study may add more counties to the
list.
   The action makes individuals and businesses in the affected
region eligible for grants, low-cost loans, and other programs.
Local governments also can receive federal help to repair public
facilities.

   Poland said on Monday it will consider
itself bound by major world human rights treaties and will sign an
accord allowing Poles to take complaints directly to U.N. legal
authorities.
   Poland is already a member of the 1975 Helsinki Agreement, which
guarantees fundamental human rights such as freedom of thought,
religion and conscience.
   Monday's announcement extends Poland's acceptance of
international judgment of its human rights practices.
   ``Poland attaches major weight to the implementation of human
rights,'' Foreign Minister Krzysztof Skubiszewski told the 44th
General Assembly.
   ``We intend to accede to some instruments which are not yet
binding on us.''
   He said Poland will accept the Optional Protocol to the
International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. That will
allow Polish citizens to appeal to the U.N.-affiliated Human Rights
Committee in cases involving emigration, torture, forced labor,
arbitrary arrest or detention, and freedom of thought, conscience,
and peaceful assembly, among other rights.
   Legal experts on the committee can order compensation. Hungary
ratified the protocol last year.
   Skubiszewski said Poland will ``accept the compulsory
jurisdiction of the International Court of Justice'' at The Hague
in all cases involving Poland.
   ``We think that the obligatory jurisdiction of the Court should
be enhanced and supported,'' he said.
   The court, an organ of the United Nations, can recommend to
states, but its rulings are not binding.
   Reflecting Poland's shift toward the West since Solidarity
entered the government, Skubiszewski continued:
   ``We also look forward to the day when it will be possible for
us to become a member of the Council of Europe and to accede to the
European Convention on Human Rights.''
   That convention, dating from 1950, also guarantees basic human
rights.
   Poland's participation in the Council of Europe would mean Poles
could take human rights complaints to the European Commission of
Human Rights, whose findings are examined by the European Court of
Human Rights. Nineteen European nations have accepted the mandatory
jurisdiction of that court.
   The Council of Europe includes an assembly and was founded in
1949 in an effort to create a united Europe.
   Last December, Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's declared
that human rights should be given new emphasis in international
affairs.
   Moscow also intends to sign the Optional Protocol, U.N. human
rights officials have said.
   The Soviet Union said in March it would accept World Court
jurisdiction in six human rights treaties.
   World legal experts hailed the decision, which reversed a Soviet
post-World War II policy of resisting outside judgment of its
practices.

<HEAD>City's First Black Police Commissioner Blames Resignation on Asthma</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The city's first black police commissioner
resigned Monday for health reasons after nearly six years on the
job.
   Benjamin Ward, appointed by Mayor Edward I. Koch, cited asthma
that has plagued him for almost two decades.
   Ward's term in office has been marked by spiraling crime rates
and increased street violence, largely traceable to the crack
epidemic that has taken hold of so many of the city's neighborhoods.
   ``I intended to stay with you to the very end but I am yielding
to the chronic asthma that has sapped my strength,'' Ward said in a
letter to Koch.
   As commissioner, Ward oversaw a police department with 26,790
officers and 9,714 civilian employees. He joined the police force
as an officer in 1951.
   Ward, 63, riled Hispanics with remarks they found offensive. In
November, he told a group of Hispanics, ``Tell your relatives to be
careful where they buy drugs. We don't want to confiscate their
cars.''
   Ward mentioned asthma medication that ``may hype me up'' when he
apologized in 1987 for telling a woman at public meeting she was
prime rape material. He drew the ire of some black groups the same
year when he called black crime against blacks ``our little dirty
secret.''
   Ward's term expires in 1991. Koch lost the Democratic primary to
David Dinkins this month and leaves office at the end of the year.

   A House-Senate conference committee voted
Monday to continue the perk of free congressional mass mailings,
reversing lopsided House and Senate votes that sought to end the
practice and use the savings to combat illegal drugs.
   The conferees voted overwhelmingly to spend $115.6 million for
three newsletter mailings a year, acting only two hours after the
House voted 245-137 to stop the valuable campaign tool.
   The House action was a non-binding vote. It instructed conferees
negotiating a congressional money bill to accept a Senate provision
barring virtually all mass mailings.
   The House conferees, saying they knew members really wanted
their free mailings, ignored the advice. The majority of Senate
votes went along with continuing the free mailings, although no
formal vote was taken after the direction of the conference became
clear.
   The Senate began the anti-free mail campaign on Sept. 7 by
voting 83-8 for an amendment to stop the newsletters and spend the
$45 million savings to treat pregnant women addicted to drugs.
   The provision, sponsored by Sen. Pete Wilson, R-Calif., would
have banned all newsletters, town meeting notices and mailings to
more than 500 households.
   House members in the conference were furious that senators, by
originally going on record against the mailings, tried to interfere
with the way the House does business and then put House members on
the spot.
   Rep. David Obey, D-Wis., said he will be prepared in the future
to propose changes in the Senate rules, which are far less strict
in the use of campaign money for office expenses. ``They want to
keep their slush funds while posing for headlines,'' he said of
senators.
   Obey said senators used the same tactic earlier this year, when
they overwhelmingly rejected a proposed 51 percent pay raise for
Congress, but secretly hoped the House would find a way to pass an
increase.
   Rep. Vic Fazio, D-Calif., chairman of the House Appropriations
legislative subcommittee,, said the Senate's tinkering with the
House's affairs was a ``real breach'' of House-Senate cooperation
and warned, ``We can have open warfare'' unless the interference
stops.
   During floor debate, Fazio was critical of the instruction to
the House members of the confernece committee. ``It's pure
demagogy, but it's great politics,'' said Fazio, accusing his
colleagues of voting to ``pose for holy pictures.''
   While the decision to continue the mailings was overwhelmingly
adopted by the conferees, not everyone was happy. Sen. Don Nickles,
R-Okla., said ``the Senate proposal was not aimed at the House.''
   And Rep. Silvio Conte, R-Mass., who offered the House resolution
to follow the Senate's lead, said he would refuse to sign the
conference report because ``We gave away the store.''
   The provision on mass mailing would establish separate mass mail
accounts: $54.5 million, or 65 percent of the total, for the
435-member House; and $29.3 million, or 35 percent, for the
100-member Senate. In addition, the provision calls for $31.7
million to cover mailing costs through the end of 1989.
   Currently, there are six mass mailings of newsletters a year,
but they would be reduced to three beginning next Jan. 1. There
would be a two-sheet limit.
   The motion to instruct conferees came on a motion by Conte, who
asked colleagues, ``Are you willing to give up a congressional perk
to combat drug addiction in newborn babies? The frank has been
abused.''
   Conte said that in the 1988 fiscal year, which ended about a
month before congressional elections, the cost of newsletters rose
steadily as the election approached _ from $5.9 million the first
quarter to $16 million the last quarter. Senate mass mailings
started at $3.8 million the first quarter and rose to $10 million
in the fourth quarter.
   Supporters of the ban said more than 1,000 babies are born in
the United States each day with substance abuse symptons. They said
the savings from the newsletter ban would permit a 10-fold increase
in the pregnant addict programs.

<TEXT>
   The chairman of a House investigative panel on
Monday rebuffed an eleventh-hour request by lawyers for former HUD
Secretary Samuel R. Pierce Jr. to delay his subpoenaed testimony
but said he would enforce a House rule permitting Pierce to bar
television coverage.
   The chairman, Rep. Tom Lantos, D-Calif., and House Speaker
Thomas S. Foley, D-Wash., were named as defendants in a lawsuit
filed in U.S. District Court by television networks seeking to
block Pierce's use of the rule and thus to permit electronic and
photographic coverage of the hearing Tuesday.
   U.S. District Judge Joyce Hens Green on Monday denied the
networks' petition fo a temporary restraining order and said she
would hear arguments at a later date on whether to grant a
permanent injunction.
   Lantos said he opposes the House rule Pierce is using and has
asked House leaders to back a repeal.
   Foley had anticipated the suit, telling reporters before it was
filed that as a defendant he would not comment.
   The House Government Operations subcommittee on labor and
housing, which has been probing the scandal at HUD since last
spring, voted last week to subpoena Pierce after the former
secretary cancelled a voluntary appearance negotiated after two
previous delays.
   Lantos said attorneys for Pierce requested another delay on
Monday, and he rejected it.
   ``I have no intention of postponing the hearing,'' Lantos told
reporters.
   Pierce's attorney, Paul L. Perito, said Pierce would appear. He
declined to say what advice he had given his client, but seemed to
hint that Pierce might not testify:
   ``I have made some strong recommendations based on my experience
in these matters but no firm decision has been made. The secretary
wanted to sleep on it and make a decision in the morning. If he
agrees with my recommendations then I will make it clear to the
subcommittee and to the press that it was my decision.''
   Perito repeatedly has said the comments of subcommittee members
have convinced him Pierce will not be treated fairly, a sentiment
he repeated in an interview Monday night: ``It's hard for me to
believe he can be given a fair shake.''
   Perito had said earlier Pierce was willing to testify but needed
more time to prepare.
   ``The subcommittee has attempted to accommodate Mr. Pierce in an
extraordinary fashion,'' Lantos said. ``A subcommittee cannot be at
the mercy of a witness who procrastinates obtaining counsel.''
   Pierce did not hire an attorney until early September, more than
three months after he first appeared before the committee
voluntarily and after a series of government reports outlined
millions of dollars of apparant fraud at the department he headed
for eight years.
   Lantos said he had not asked Pierce's attorneys if their client
would refuse to testify on constitutional grounds.
   ``I have no idea whther Mr. Pierce will take the 5th Amendment
or not,'' Lantos said. ``We are prepared to have him testify.''
   Perito said Friday that Pierce was invoking the little-used
House rule that permits witnesses appearing under subpoena to ban
radio, television and still photographic coverage of their
appearances.
   He said he had asked the speaker and Rules Chairman Joe Moakley,
D-Mass., to consider changing the rule. He said he would abide by
the speaker's decision, but was determined to seek a change in the
next session of Congress if not this one.
   ``It is my judgment that congressional hearings are very
different'' now, Lantos said.
   ``It is my own view that the rule is no longer relevant, that it
is obsolete ... It ought to be changed,'' he said. ``I believe it
is unreasonable to discriminate'' against certain media.
   However, Lantos said he would oppose efforts to overturn the
rule in the courts because Congress should have the right to set
its own rules.

   The premier edition of St. Louis' new morning
newspaper, the St. Louis Sun, was snatched up around the city
Monday by curious and enthusiastic readers.
   ``The customers like the competition,'' said Ann Pointer at a
World News Ltd. newstand in Clayton where 700 copies were sold in
about 2{ hours. ``They like another viewpoint.''
   Sales were brisk around town, and many of the Sun's shiny red
street corner boxes, dubbed ``facts machines'' by the Sun, were
empty by mid-morning.
   The Sun, whose debut featured a color picture of a sun rising
behind the Gateway Arch, is the first major newspaper to start from
scratch in a big U.S. city since the Washington Times in 1982.
   The Sun published 200,000 copies of its premier edition.
   The colorful tabloid is competing with the 110-year-old St.
Louis Post-Dispatch, also a morning paper. The Post-Dispatch has
been the city's only daily newspaper since the St. Louis
Globe-Democrat folded in October 1986.
   At a sidewalk reception outside the Sun's downtown offices
Monday morning, Sun employees darted into traffic to hand out free
copies of the paper. A Dixieland band played in the background, and
employees offered coffee and donuts to passers-by.
   Ralph Ingersoll II, chairman and chief executive officer of New
Jersey-based Ingersoll Publications Co., which owns the Sun, is
moving to St. Louis from Connecticut to become editor in chief.
   ``I think it's pretty clear that print has a good future. I
haven't the least doubt the St. Louis Sun will be profitable. It's
one of the lower risk ventures we've undertaken,'' he said.
   Already, the Sun has attracted 55,000 subscribers _ nearly twice
the level company officials had been aiming for after a month of
publication. Advertising space in the inaugural edition was sold
out.
   Last week's paid circulation at the Post-Dispatch stood at
564,000 on Sunday and 384,000 on weekdays.
   ``We definitely welcome competition,'' said the Post-Dispatch's
managing editor, David Lipman. ``We find it exciting and
challenging.''

<HEAD>Former HUD Official Gets 18 Months In Prison</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A former federal housing official was
sentenced Monday to 18 months in prison for taking money and a
vacation from a developer seeking a $600,000 government grant.
   U.S. District Court Judge George Revercomb imposed the sentence
on DuBois L. Gilliam, deputy assistant secretary for program policy
development and evaluation at the Department of Housing and Urban
Development until 1987.
   Gilliam pleaded guilty in April to taking the money and the
vacation from Bradley Kline, secretary-treasurer of the Crown Bay
Local Development Corp. on St. Thomas in the Virgin Islands.
   The company was formed in 1983 in an attempt to develop the area
around Crown Bay into a commercial site.
   The corporation won approval in September 1985 for a $600,000
grant from HUD in connection wih the project. Gilliam's job
involved the award of such grants to community development
organizations.
   Gilliam admitted that he demanded $8,100 from Kline starting in
July 1985 to ensure that the Crown Bay concern got the grant.
   He also pleaded guilty to taking an all-expense paid vacation in
the Virgin Islands for him and members of his family to ensure that
Kline's company got the grant. The trip was valued at $4,900.
   The judge imposed 18-month sentences for each of the two felony
counts and the two terms are to run concurrently.

<TEXT>
   The wife of Ozzy Osbourne has
dropped her allegations that the rock musician threatened to kill
her, prosecutor Nigel Ogbourne told Beaconsfield Magistrates Court
on Monday.
   Osbourne, 41, has been charged with making threats to kill his
wife Sharon, 37, after allegedly trying to choke her when they
returned home from a restaurant.
   But prosecutor Ogbourne told the court 25 miles west of London:
``The prosecution case lies in the evidence of the aggrieved. She
has made a statement but she wishes to withdraw the allegation.''
   Monday's hearing, however, concerned only the conditions of
Osbourne's bail and the charge against him of making threats to
kill her remain formally in force.
   Ogbourne added: ``The police are considering other evidence to
see whether there is a case for Mr. Osbourne to answer.'' Ogbourne
did not elaborate on this aspect of the case.
   Osbourne, who as lead singer with the heavy metal band Black
Sabbath established a wild-man image with heavy drinking and
brawling, is a resident at nearby Huntercombe Manor, an expensive
clinic for people with alcohol problems.
   The court changed the conditions of his bail, lifting a ban it
had previously imposed on him visiting his wife and their three
young children.
   Osbourne's attorney, Chris Fairweather, told the court that
Osbourne's wife had been to see her husband at Huntercombe Manor,
where the court had sent him at a previous hearing.
   But Fairweather said that when she invited her husband to their
home at nearby Amersham the court ban then in force had stopped him
accepting.
   ``It is clear the parties are successfully seeking to sort out
their difficulties,'' Fairweather told the court.
   Osbourne, who wore a conventional suit and tie at the hearing,
said ``Thank you'' when told he could visit his wife.
   His bail was extended until Oct. 18 on condition he remains a
resident at the clinic.

   Japanese and South Korean ministers agreed
Monday the Seoul government should become a U.N. member and
discussed better treatment for Koreans in Japan and trade relations
between the two Asian lands.
   Foreign ministers Taro Nakayama of Japan and Choi Ho-joong of
South Korea met to discuss the situation on the divided Korean
Peninsula, world events and Japanese-South Korean issues.
   Nakayama addresses the General Assembly Tuesday. Since South
Korea is an observer at the United Nations, not a full member, Choi
will not follow suit.
   Seiichi Kondo briefed reporters for Nakayama. Suh Jong-hwan
represented Choi.
   Kondo said the two agreed that South Korean President Roe
Tae-woo's visit to Tokyo should be arranged as soon as possible. It
was postponed twice because of political upheavals in Japan.
   Choi expressed South Korea's willingness to join the 159-nation
United Nations and said many nations expressed support after the
Seoul Olympic games.
   Japan has supported South Korea's admission, and on Monday
Foreign Minister Alois Mock of Austria said his government wants
Seoul admitted.
   Seoul has advocated simultaneous admission of both North Korea
and South Korea, but the Pyongyang government opposed this, saying
it would perpetuate the division of the Korean Peninsula, not
promote reunificiation.
   Choi told Nakayama on Monday that if North Korea persists in
this, South Korea will seek separate admission.
   South Korea has made no formal move to join the world
organization.
   Choi told Nakayama his government wants better treatment of
650,000 Koreans living in Japan with Korean passports, but without
legal status equivalent to that of Japanese. Seoul also seeks
improved treatment for Koreans who suffered from the atomic bombing
that ended World War II.
   It seeks improvement in its trade deficit with Japan and the
Japanese side said these issues would be discussed and considered,
the spokesmen said.
   Choi reported that talks on improving relations have been held
with the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe, especially Poland,
Yugoslavia and Hungary.
   Nakayama explained Japanese-North Korean relations in which no
diplomatic ties or political dialogue, but some economic and trade
relations exist.

<TEXT>
   Declaring the world ``has lived too long
in the shadow of chemical warfare,'' President Bush offered Monday
to slash U.S. stocks of such weapons more than 80 percent provided
the Soviet Union reduces to an equal level.
   Bush's proposal, in his first speech to the U.N. General
Assembly as president, was designed to spur a 40-nation conference
in Geneva to ban chemical weapons entirely within 10 years.
   He also used his appearance to salute ``freedom's march'' around
the world _ in Hungary, Poland, Latin America and Africa _ and to
praise the Soviet Union for removing ``a number of obstacles'' in
the way of treaties to reduce long-range nuclear weapons, and
troops and tanks in Europe.
   Bush noted progress on those issues and agreements on other
matters _ during talks last weekend between Secretary of State
James A. Baker III and Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard A.
Shevardnadze _ as well as a decision to hold a summit meeting with
Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev by early next summer.
   ``Let us act together _ beginning today _ to rid the earth of
this scourge,'' Bush said in his comments on chemical weapons.
Shevardnadze said after the speech that the Soviets had ``a
positive view'' of the plan but that it and other Bush proposals
``will have to be studied additionally.''
   At a dinner later at the Metropolitan Museum of Art where he was
host, President Bush and his wife shook the hands of 400 guests in
a receiving line, among them Shevardnardze.
   Shevardnardze told Bush, and later told Baker, also in the
receiving line, ``We have some news from Moscow.''
   Baker replied that he and Shevardnardze should find some time
Tuesday or Wednesday for a short chat.
   Brent Scowcroft, the president's national security adviser, said
the news might be a response to Bush's chemical weapons proposal,
but no one knew. He said the Soviets had been given an outline of
the U.S. initiative in advance and ``they really have not
responded.''
   He also told reporters at a briefing that Bush's proposal did
not include biological weapons, which some experts consider as
deadly as poison gas.
   One year ago, during the first presidential candidates' debate,
Bush had said, ``I want to be the one to banish chemical and
biological weapons from the face of the earth.'' The United States
has in the past accused the Soviets of developing biological
weapons.
   Congress has passed legislation requiring the administration to
destroy old chemical weapons by 1997 as more advanced weapons are
stockpiled. Asked about any connection between Bush's proposal and
the legal mandate to destroy a large percentage of such weapons,
the White House official said that whether or not the new plan was
``making a virtue of necessity it is certainly part of a major
effort and a serious effort now.''
   Twice, as vice president, Bush blocked legislation to destroy
U.S. chemical weapons by breaking a tie vote. In those instances,
the cutback would not have required Soviet reductions as well.
   To get down to the equal stocks that Bush proposed, the Soviets
would have to make deeper cuts since they are thought to have more
chemical weapons on hand. Only the two superpowers acknowledge
having poison gas, but Bush said more than 20 nations either
possess them or can produce them.
   The Reagan administration singled out Libya as being on the
verge of producing chemical weapons with the assistance of West
German firms.
   Baker told reporters, ``This proposal really attacks the
proliferation problem by making it impossible for these countries
to argue that major countries have them and are just dragging their
feet in chemical weapons negotiations.''
   Bush, who served as U.S. permanent representative at the United
Nations in 1971 and 1972, described his visit and speech as a
homecoming. The delegates interrupted him twice with applause _
when he proposed the chemical weapons reductions and when he
reported progress in U.S.-Soviet relations.
   At one point, he also mourned the slaying of Marine Lt. Col.
William R. Higgins, who was taken hostage on a U.N. mission in
Lebanon in February 1988 and subsequently slain. He called Higgins
``a man of unquestioned bravery and unswerving dedication to the
U.N. ideal'' and called on the General Assembly to condemn the
murder.
   Bush's chemical weapons proposal has three key elements:
   _The United States was ``ready to begin now'' by eliminating
more than 80 percent of its stockpile while working on a treaty,
provided the Soviets also made their cuts.
   _In the first eight years of a 40-nation treaty the United
States would destroy nearly all _ 98 percent _ of its chemical
weapons if the Soviet Union joined the ban.
   _All U.S. chemical weapons _ ``100 percent, every one'' _ would
be destroyed within 10 years, once all nations capable of building
such weapons signed a total ban treaty.
   As for superpower relations, Bush said he saw ``signs of a new
attitude'' in U.S.-Soviet relations. Also, ``we are witnessing an
ideological collapse, the demise of the totalitarian idea of the
omniscient, all-powerful state.''
   As for chemical weapons, he said, ``These horrible weapons are
now finding their way into regional conflicts. ... This is
unacceptable.''
   Bush referred to the use of poison gas by Iran and Iraq in their
Persian Gulf war. The threat is considered potentially explosive
especially in the Middle East where Syria is feared to have
chemical weapons that could be placed on the tip of missiles and
fired at Israel.
   Bush acknowledged monitoring and enforcing a ban would be a
challenge. But, he said, inspection procedures developed for
nuclear weapons cutbacks offer useful experience.
   American chemical weapons stockpiles are estimated at about
30,000 tons. A small portion is stored in West Germany.
   The Soviet Union has admitted to possessing about 50,000 tons,
though some analysts believe the arsenal is larger.
   Baker outlined the plan to Shevardnadze at their talks last
weekend in Jackson Hole, Wyo.
   There they agreed to exchange information about U.S. and Soviet
chemical weapons and to conduct cross-inspections of arsenals and
plants.
   Shevardnadze said Monday that ``from the very beginning we stood
for the total elimination of all chemical stockpiles.''
   In a long day in New York,the President also hosted a lunch for
the foreign ministers of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization,
Australia, Japan and South Korea, and held separate meetings with
President Jose Sarney of Brazil, Deputy Prime Minister Shimon Peres
of Israel, President Vinizio Cerezo of Guatemala, President Carlos
Andres Peres of Venezuela and Foreign Minister Moshe Arens of
Israel.
   At dinner, the President said in a toast ``the resolution of
conflicts by non-violent, political means has now taken center
stage. And the U.N. is leading the way.''
   He was nearly 20 minutes late for the dinner and offered ``A
thousand apologies'' when he and his wife finally arrived.
   White House Press Secretary Marlin Fitzwater said Bush was
delayed by meetings with the foreign ministers of Hungary,
Yugoslavia and Poland.

   Banks reopened, a trickle of mail was
delivered and trash collection resumed in this hurricane-battered
city Monday, but a cold downpour hindered efforts to restore power
and worsened damage to roofless homes.
   Two inches of rain fell, and temperatures were in the 60s. An 80
percent chance of showers was forecast for Tuesday.
   ``It's going to make it harder to accomplish anything, going to
make everything a little more miserable,'' said Kay Robinson, a
meteorologist with the National Weather Service.
   At Isle of Palms, a barrier island where martial law was
declared to preserve order, residents boarded ferries for their
first look at destruction wrought by Hugo since they were evacuated
Thursday. A bridge to the mainland and Charleston was wiped out.
   Residents were allowed to fill one suitcase each before they
were asked to leave again. The shattered houses made the one-time
seaside paradise look like a war zone.
   ``It looks like what happens after artillery fire,'' said Tom
Harper, a retired Air Force officer.
   Residents of Garden City were still unable to return to their
elite resort community on a 60-mile stretch of South Carolina's
coast known as the Grand Strand. The town's entrance was guarded by
National Guardsmen, but that did not prevent looting.
   ``There was a lady just filling her bags with stuff,'' said
shopowner Connie Brewer. ``I've caught people stealing here three
days straight. It's like stealing from a graveyard.''
   It was far from a normal workday in Charleston, where electrical
service was restored to hospitals but hot meals and water for
drinking and bathing was were still in short supply.
   Late Monday, Mayor Joseph P. Riley said the city's water system
was pumping potable water and 400,000 residents did not have to
continue boiling water before drinking it.
   The downpour hampered utility crews toiling to string power
lines. In homes already hit by Hugo's blustery winds, rainwater
compounded matters by seeping through damaged roofs in this
300-year-old city.
   ``There's a greater chance of problems with hot wires because of
the standing water,'' said Brian Duncan, a spokesman for South
Carolina Electric &amp; Gas Co. ``When it's wet, it just slows you
down.''
   Frustration grew in some of the hardest hit neighborhoods, where
residents patched damaged roofs with plastic sheeting to keep out
the rain.
   ``The whole town's going to be called `Hell Hole' soon. That's
what it's going to be, one big hell hole,'' complained Gerald Dean.
   Seven C&amp;S bank branches and automatic teller machines opened in
Charleston, allowing residents to cash checks to buy gas and other
supplies. Other branches opened along the coast.
   ``We've been out of money since Thursday,'' said Edith Myrick, a
customer who needed cash to buy gas and food.
   ``I thought of everything in the world to prepare for the storm,
but I didn't think of money,'' said Emmit Neal. ``We've got trees
to cut down and you've got to have money to pay folks.''
   John Jordan, a C&amp;S official in Charleston, said offices would be
open four hours a day until power is restored.
   ``If it hadn't have been for the rain, we would have been
swamped,'' he said. ``We have some locations where there are
literally lines out the doors.''
   Riley pleaded for donations of money, lumber, canned food,
disposable diapers and clothing. He set up a relief hot line.
``We've got a lot of people who are hurting here and they need our
help,'' he said.
   A curfew remained in effect for Myrtle Beach and Charleston,
where the National Guard patrolled with bayonetted M-16 rifles to
discourage looters. In North Carolina, about 550 National Guardsmen
patrolled, 350 of them in Mecklenburg County.
   Power was restored Monday to more than 200,000 people in the
Carolinas, but at least 546,000 remained without service. It could
be a month before full service is restored, utility officials said.
   The 12th strongest hurricane to hit the U.S. mainland this
century slammed South Carolina with 135 mph winds late Thursday.
The six-day rampage of Hugo and its remnants killed at least 61
people _ at least 33 in the Caribbean and 28 in the United States.
   ``We're looking at damage between $1 and $2 billion,'' said Bob
Sheets, director of the National Hurricane Center in Coral Gables,
Fla. He toured the South Carolina coast Monday.
   State and local officials have estimated damage at $3 billion or
more.
   President Bush on Monday declared four inland North North
Carolina counties as disaster areas eligible for federal help. Bush
previously declared seven South Carolina counties disaster areas.
   Insurance agents went house-to-house, gathering estimates and
handing out claim checks.
   Some of Hugo's victims may not be able to rebuild under a state
law designed to curb beach erosion by limiting development. All
reconstruction and repairs close to the water will require a permit
from the South Carolina Coastal Council.
   ``We are considering an order that will allow people to repair
houses provided they are less than 66 and two-thirds (percent)
damaged,'' administrator Steve Moore said. The council will send
crews out to confirm the damage before work can begin.
   In Sumter, 180 miles inland, residents suffered through a fourth
day without electricity, water and food.
   ``We don't know what's going on, when we'll get help,'' Kelly
Brown said. ``We've had grits for the children for two days, but
the Sterno's giving out.''
   In Myrtle Beach, beaches were off limits because of
contamination from sewage. The problem was blamed on residents who
refuse to conserve water.
   ``People just can't shower until they utterly can't stand each
other,'' said Pat Dowling, a city spokesman. ``They should also
avoid flushing until it's absolutely necessary. If people don't
cooperate, we'll have to turn the water off.''
   The storm also took its toll on more than half of the state's
cotton crop, leveled much of the corn fields and put the soybean
harvest in doubt, officials said. Agricultural losses were
estimated at $45 million to $50 million.

   Jerry Falwell offered Jim Bakker $300,000
and other perks to keep his mouth shut after Falwell took over the
scandal-ridden PTL, the TV ministry's chief builder testified
Monday.
   Falwell denied the account given by builder Roe Messner, who
testified for the defense at Bakker's fraud trial.
   Messner also said a chief Bakker aide claimed Bakker knew
nothing about $265,000 in hush money to Jessica Hahn, the church
secretary with whom Bakker had a sexual encounter in 1980.
   Bakker is accused of defrauding followers by using more than
$3.7 million in ministry money to live in high style. The TV
evangelist faces up to 120 years in prison and more than $5 million
in fines if convicted on all 24 counts of fraud and conspiracy.
   Falwell, founder of the now defunct Moral Majority, took over
PTL in 1987 after Bakker resigned in the scandal involving Ms. Hahn.
   Messner testified that the offer to Bakker from Falwell included
a maid, a security guard and telephone expenses if Bakker ``kept
his mouth shut.''
   Messner said Bakker wrote at the bottom of the piece of paper:
``I'm not making any demands on PTL. I'm not asking for anything.''
   It was not immediately clear whether Bakker turned down the
alleged offer. Messner was not questioned further about the matter.
   Mark DeMoss, a Falwell spokesman, said in a telephone interview
that Messner was mistaken. The offer actually was a demand from
Bakker, DeMoss said.
   Falwell dispatched Messner to Palm Springs, Calif., to talk to
Bakker, but he carried no offer, DeMoss said. Messner returned with
a handwritten list of demands on the pink stationery of Bakker's
wife, Tammy, DeMoss said.
   DeMoss said Bakker's demands included hospital insurance,
Bakker's $300,000 annual salary for life, Tammy Bakker's $100,000
annual salary for life, royalties on inspirational books and
recordings made by the Bakkers, secretary and maid service for a
year, use of a South Carolina lakefront house and furniture and
attorneys' fees.
   ``Simply put, the items Roe Messner testifed that Rev. Falwell
sent him out to offer Bakker were items that Bakker requested and
Messner presented to Rev. Falwell,'' DeMoss said. ``I would like to
think Roe just forgot the sequence of events.''
   Messner testified that he handled the $265,000 payment to Ms.
Hahn. He said he was called by Richard Dortch, PTL's executive vice
president, on Feb. 21, 1985.
   Dortch told Messner that if he didn't pay a woman from New York
$265,000 then she would go to The Charlotte Observer with
allegations that Bakker raped her. Five days later, Messner said,
he wired the $265,000 to an account number in California that was
given to him by Dortch.
   Messner said he asked Dortch if Bakker knew about the payment.
He said Dortch replied: ``No, I'm acting on my own.''
   Messner said he agreed to make the payment in part because the
Assemblies of God was named as the potential party in a lawsuit
threatened by Ms. Hahn. ``I didn't think the church ought to be
dragged into this incident,'' Messner said.
   Contributors to PTL who remain supportive of Bakker also
testified.
   ``I've always thought from the beginning that Jim Bakker was a
giver,'' said Karl Garmager, a television director from Michigan.

<HEAD>U.S.-Soviets Agree To Seek New North Pacific Salmon Agreement</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LES BLUMENTHAL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   U.S. and Soviet negotiators reached tentative
agreement on a plan they hope will eventually eliminate all high
seas salmon fishing in the North Pacific, the State Department said
Monday.
   During talks in Lenningrad last week, both nations also:
   _ Expressed concern about the illegal harvesting of salmon by
drift net fleets in the North Pacific and agreed to seek
``multilateral cooperation in effectively regulating such fishing
practices.''
   _ Decided to establish an advisory committee that will develop
recommendations that could lead to regulation of bottom fishing in
an area of the Bering Sea known as the ``doughnut hole.''
   The salmon plan envisioned by the United States and the Soviet
Union would, if Canada and Japan agreed, replace the International
North Pacific Fisheries Convention.
   The convention has overseen the regulation of salmon fishing in
the North Pacific since the 1950s. Besides the illegal harvest of
salmon by the drift net fleets, some nations allow a ``directed''
high seas salmon catch.
   ``The convention terms discussed reflect the view of the two
sides that high seas fishing for anadromous resources is irrational
and wasteful,'' the joint-statement said.
   The new agreement would include ``significant enforcement
provisions'' aimed at preventing illegal harvesting of salmon and
increased scientific cooperation.
   ``The idea is to prohibit salmon fishing on the high seas,''
said Ed Wolfe, who as the State Department's ambassador for oceans
and fisheries led the U.S. delegation to the Lenningrad talks.
``This is something that will save our salmon.''
   Wolfe said he expected that the legal high seas salmon fishing
currently allowed on a limited basis would also be ``phased out.''
   The United States, Canada, Soviet Union and Japan all have
salmon stocks that migrate into the North Pacific.

   Suspected Communist rebels killed a
captain from President Corazon Aquino's guard force Tuesday and six
police were injured in a clash with students protesting the visit
of Vice President Dan Quayle.
   Capt. Carlos Daileg, a staff officer of the Presidential
Security Group, was slain about 7 a.m. (9 p.m. EDT Monday) in
Manila's Pandacan district, about one mile southeast of the
presidential palace.
   The assailants, armed with .45-caliber pistols, escaped in a
commandeered vehicle, police said. Daileg was the fourth member of
Mrs. Aquino's guard force slain in the past four months.
   Cleo Erfe, acting commander of the Presidential Security Group,
said he suspected the assailants were an urban assassination team
of the New People's Army, which has been waging a 20-year
insurgency to establish a Communist state.
   The Presidential Security Group provides guards for Mrs. Aquino
and foreign dignitaries. Quayle is due to arrive in Manila late
Tuesday from Japan for a three-day visit.
   In another incident, police Tuesday broke up a rally at Adamson
University of leftist students protesting Quayle's visit. Police
said six officers were injured when the militants hurled a small,
homemade explosive device. Nine students were arrested.
   Security was first stepped up Monday as leftist groups promised
protests and a grenade exploded on the ground floor of an office
building in the financial district, slightly injuring two women.
The assailant escaped.
   The grenade blasts over the last two weeks have killed at least
two people, prompting officials to place police and military units
on alert in the Manila area.
   Security has also been stepped up because leftist groups have
called for demonstrations when Quayle arrives.
   He is expected to discuss the future of the six American
military bases in the Philippines.
   On Monday, Vice President Salvador Laurel of the Philippines
called for phasing out the bases over five to 10 years to avoid
serious disruptions in the Philippine economy and regional balance
of power.
   ``I stress the need for the Philippines to undertake its own
external defense eventually,'' Laurel said. ``Right now, we are
completely dependent on the United States.''
   In another development Monday, President Aquino criticized U.S.
authorities for releasing a report that erroneously linked her to a
gun-running case.
   She chided the U.S. Embassy for a report claiming she had signed
an authorization for weapons purchased in California and seized
Sept. 5 in the luggage of a Filipino congressman, Nicanor de
Guzman. He was charged last week with illegal weapons possession.
   U.S. officials said a report by the U.S. Alcohol, Tobacco and
Firearms bureau was provided to the Manila government at its
request. The report quoted a gun dealer in the Los Angeles area as
saying Mrs. Aquino ``allegedly'' signed the authorization.
   Filipino officials later said the document was signed by Col.
George Aquino of the Philippine Embassy in Washington.
   ``I imagine whoever this person was _ the gun store dealer _
thought that I am the only one with the name Aquino in the
Philippines,'' Mrs. Aquino told reporters. ``What I want to see is
that my name not be taken to lightly.''

   Federal investigators went inside the wreckage
of a USAir jet Monday, looking for additional clues to the cause of
last week's aborted takeoff and crash into the East River that
killed two people.
   Local authorities announced a grand jury would investigate the
crash of the Boeing 737-400 to see if any criminal charges are
warranted. The aircraft was headed for Charlotte, N.C., when it
slid off the runway.
   John Santucci, district attorney in the borough of Queens where
the airport is located, said he initially had no designated targets
and would not seek specific charges. But sources in Santucci's
office said the grand jury might be asked to consider charges
including criminally negligent homicide, vehicular manslaughter and
leaving the scene of an accident. An airplane is considered a
vehicle under state law.
   The last pieces of the jet, which landed partly in the water and
partly on a row of pilings, were pulled from the river Sunday.
   National Transportation Safety Board investigators were ``for
the first time getting an opportunity to really go into the wreck
and find out what exists in the wreckage,'' said Rachel Halterman,
an NTSB spokeswoman.
   Over the weekend, the NTSB said the rookie co-pilot had
inadvertently pushed a button that cut the throttle. The board said
pilot Michael W. Martin told investigators he decided to abort
takeoff because of a strange vibration and because the aircraft was
drifting to the left.
   However, the unexplained veer to the left also was being
investigated.
   The crash of Flight 5050 late Wednesday killed two people; 59
others were rescued from the of the East River.
   Martin, 36, and co-pilot Constantine Kleissas were criticized by
federal officials for failing to submit immediately to drug and
alcohol testing, although they are not legally required to do so.
They submitted urine samples Friday. Results will not be available
for three weeks.
   On Saturday, they also gave urine samples to the district
attorney's office after they were told a warrant was being
prepared. Martin ``didn't want anybody to see his face'' and had a
blanket wrapped around his head when he met local investigators,
said Piperno.
   The two pilots' flight licenses were also suspended because they
disappeared from the accident scene.
   Local criminal charges against a flight crew would be highly
unusual, according to industry insiders.
   ``We're not aware of criminal charges in the past ever being
brought here in the United States against an airline pilot''
following a crash, said John Macor, spokesman for the Air Line
Pilots Association in Washington.
   ``I don't recall it happening before,'' said Ms. Halterman.
   A lawyer for Martin and Kleissas, Frederick Hafetz, has said he
believes his clients committed no criminal act.
   Kleissas, 29, who had flown a 737-400 only once before on a
passenger flight, was at the controls, but Martin took over the
throttle after Kleissas pushed the button, authorities said.

<TEXT>
   Quebec Premier Robert Bourassa easily won a
second straight majority government for his Liberal Party on
Monday, but with a slightly reduced margin over a revitalized
nationalist Parti Quebecois.
   ``I believe that this is a sign of confidence,'' a smiling
Bourassa said at his district headquarters.
   Besides the continuing quarrel between French and English
speakers, the campaign was marked by environmental protests and
labor unrest.
   The Parti Quebecois, which had been reeling from its election
debacle four years ago and was suffering from internal struggles
only last year, ran a strong campaign on its platform of eventual
independence for the majority French-speaking province and gained
seats.
   ``We have progressed solidly toward the goal that we think is
the right one,'' its leader, Jacques Parizeau, said in reiterating
his separatist aims.
   ``Even if we haven't had as many seats as we wanted, isn't it
marvelous, this idea of independence for Quebec?'' he told
supporters, who broke into chants of ``Le Quebec aux Quebecois
(Quebec for Quebecers).''
   ``They said it (independence) was dead,'' Parizeau added. ``It
is alive.'' A new Equality Party formed by English speakers irate
over Quebec's pro-French language policies won two seats in the
125-member provincial assembly and tight races were going for two
more.
   But Bourassa's Liberals had won or were leading in more than
two-thirds of the districts.
   A Canadian Broadcasting Corp. projection after the polls closed
at 8 p.m. EDT indicated the Liberals had won or were leading for 91
seats, the Parti Quebecois for 30 and the Equality Party for four.
   Bourassa, whose party has held power in the province for four
years, had predicted the win as he voted in his home district of
Outremont, where he was re-elected.
   Late Monday, as Bourassa was leaving his home, where he watched
the results with his family, he yelled out he was feeling ``very
happy.''
   Parizeau had predicted a good showing for his party, which moved
up steadily in the polls through the election campaign in this
predominately French-speaking province.
   The Equality Party was in a tight race for a third seat.
   Equality Party worker Jocelyn Kruger said she was ``ecstatic''
about the six-month-old party's showing. ``When we started we had
to think it would happen, and it did.''
   During the campaign, the Parti Quebecois tried to capitalize on
environmental and labor protests that overshadowed Bourassa's
promises of continued prosperity.
   The Liberals won 99 of 122 seats in the provincial assembly four
years ago, and pre-election opinion polls showed little likelihood
that the Parti Quebecois would be able to muster the 42 percent of
the popular vote needed to make much of a dent this year.
   But under leader Parizeau, who won an internal struggle last
year to put the separatist party back on a hard-line course, the
party showed during the campaign it was not in danger of either
disappearing or becoming irrelevant.
   Bourassa, an economist, counted on Quebec residents being more
interested in prosperity than in independence.
   He touted a 4 percent annual economic growth rate, the creation
of 233,000 new jobs and the social stability that lasted through
most of his term.
   But the idea of separatism, thought to have been put to rest in
a 1980 referendum in which 60 percent of the voters rejected it,
proved surprisingly durable.
   The Parti Quebecois won 38.7 percent of the popular vote in the
December 1985 provincial election.
   Bourassa's support among Quebec's English-speaking minority,
which traditionally votes Liberal, may have been hurt by his
refusal in December to allow more than a token change in provincial
laws restricting commercial signs to the French language.
   His compromise solution allowed bilingual signs only indoors _
and as long as the French-language portion was significantly larger
than the English.
   Quebec, Canada's largest and second-most populous province with
6.5 million people, is 81 percent French-speaking. It has 4.6
million registered voters.
   Supporters of language restrictions argue they are necessary to
protect Quebec's special culture.

freed after spending 25 months in jail for concealing her daughter
in a bitter custody battle.
   Attorneys for Morgan are asking the D.C. Court of Appeals to
issue an order freeing her today. President Bush signed legislation
Saturday designed to force her release.
   Her ex-husband's attorney, however, said Sunday she will seek to
have the law declared unconstitutional.
   Morgan contends that her former husband and the girl's father,
Dr. Eric Foretich, had sexually abused their daughter, Hilary, now
7 _ a charge he strongly denies.

   Thousands of Vietnamese soldiers
bade farewell to Phnom Penh today, leaving behind citizens worried
that the dreaded Khmer Rouge is already taking advantage of Hanoi's
pullout with new assaults.
   Hundreds of army vehicles including artillery and tanks paraded
in front of the Royal Palace as a band played a song celebrating
the ``solidarity'' between Vietnam and Cambodia.
   Several thousand people including Cambodian soldiers and
schoolchildren lined the streets waving flags in yet another
government-organized ceremony marking what Vietnam says is the
withdrawal of its final 26,000 troops.
   Heng Samrin, president of the Vietnamese-installed government,
thanked the commanders of departing Vietnamese units 479 and 979.

   Nominated by acclamation to run for
re-election, President Daniel Ortega predicted that he would win in
another defeat for Washington, supplier of the Contra rebels who
fought his leftist government.
   ``We will win,'' Ortega told a cheering convention of the ruling
leftist Sandinista National Liberation Front that nominated him and
running mate Sergio Ramirez on Sunday night.
   Ortega, 44, who led the Sandinistas to power with the 1979
overthrow of dictator Anastasio Somoza, had been expected to win
the nomination.
   A Sandinista electoral victory next year, Ortega said in an
acceptance speech, will be ``one more defeat the United States is
going to have to accept. They will have to reach an understanding
with Nicaragua after the defeat they are going to suffer. They have
no other choice.''

   The St. Louis Sun, trying to start from scratch
and buck the trend of newspaper mergers and shutdowns, hit the
streets early today to a curious and eager community.
   The debut edition of the tabloid newspaper featured a photograph
of a bright sun rising over the Gateway Arch.
   The lead story was the launch of the newspaper, and its headline
was ``St. Louis, We Have Liftoff.''
   The Sun is trying to become the first major newspaper to start
from scratch and make a profit since Newsday successfully did it on
Long Island nearly 50 years ago, said Ralph Ingersoll II, chairman
and chief executive officer of New Jersey-based Ingersoll
Publications Co., which owns the Sun.

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Some call it corrupting the classics. But
conductor Daniel Lipton calls it Popera.
   Popera is a program he started at Opera Hamilton, a suburb of
Toronto, Canada, which plays well-known operatic pieces for people
who don't normally attend opera.
   ``Everyone thinks opera is `it's not over until the fat lady
sings,''' he said. ``But that's changing. Anything in art is sort
of like porno films _ you have to participate to really appreciate
it.''
   For Lipton, opera is an emotional outlet for fantasy, and his
goal through Popera is to expand that fantasy to people with only a
passing acquaintance with the music.
   Opera suffers from its reputation as an art for fanatics and
through the Popera program, which has been duplicated elsewhere,
Lipton has sought to convince listeners that opera isn't
unattainably highbrow.
   Programs have included excerpts from ``Carmen,'' ``Don
Giovanni,'' ``The Barber of Seville'' and other operas in which
people recognize the melody, but don't know its origins.
   ``I wanted to get away from the elitist and break down the
barriers,'' Lipton said.
   Lipton has not been alone. Opera, it seems, is all around _ in
movie scores and in plays, in commercials for pizzas. There is even
an album entitled ``Madison Avenue Goes to the Opera.''
   Purists rail against the trend, fearing people will learn the
tunes, but miss the point.
   But Lipton argues that there's nothing wrong with it. ``It's
fun,'' he said. An elderly couple once wrote him after they
attended a Popera concert in Hamilton and thanked him for giving
them ``a new love in their old age.''
   Lipton would like to bring his baton to New York, one place in
which the transplanted New Yorker has never played.
   ``It's pretty depressing not to have played in your hometown,''
Lipton said in a recent interview while he was visiting New York
for auditions. ``But I think it's just a matter of time.''
   He has been approached by companies in New York, but for one
reason or another, his return home has never worked out. It's not
for lack of recognition; Lipton made his debut in Paris and has
conducted at most major opera houses in Europe and many in this
country.
   His reputation led to his selection as the conductor of the
world premiere of Gian Carlo Menotti's ``The Wedding Day'' at the
Seoul Olympics.
   He founded an opera company in Colombia and has been credited
with saving the company in Hamilton _ where he now lives _ through
Popera.
   He's won applause at annual appearances in France, Italy, Spain,
Germany, Colombia and the United States. But New York opera buffs
have never seen him at the podium.
   He tries not to dwell on it. He's too busy.
   Born in Paris, Lipton lived on three continents before his first
birthday. His family fled France during World War II by way of
Casablanca before settling in New York, where his father operated a
French-language bookstore.
   Lipton, the youngest of three boys, began playing the piano when
he was 3 years old.
   ``My mother wanted to be a concert pianist,'' he said. ``But her
father wouldn't hear of it. It wasn't proper for a woman at that
time.''
   At 14, Lipton decided to live on his own in New York, supporting
himself by playing jazz in clubs, sometimes finishing early enough
to catch humorist Lenny Bruce perform. Playing both oboe and piano,
Lipton entered the Juilliard School of Music at 16. He toyed with
five majors before settling on a career in conducting.
   He went to Europe on a Fulbright Fellowship. In Siena, Italy, he
happened upon an opera class. He watched from the balcony, became
fascinated by the music and decided he wanted to conduct opera on
the spot. He arranged to audition for the class that afternoon.
   ``I didn't know the scores,'' he recalled. ``I studied over
lunch.''
   He made it, and he's been successful ever since, conducting at
the Munich Staatsoper, Nice Opera, Houston Grand Opera, Denver
Symphony, Teatro de la Fenice in Venice, the Teatro San Carla in
Naples and the Madrid Opera House. He also has served as artistic
director of the San Antonio International Festival of the Arts.
   Four years ago, Lipton was asked to take over the helm of the
struggling Opera Hamilton.
   Hamilton, a small company, gives him the opportunity to
experiment _ an opportunity that he might not have at a larger
company. Still, he would like to move on to a bigger troupe within
the next decade; he's aware that whatever happens, his abilities
are well known.
   ``They (opera companies) keep asking me back,'' he said. ``I
must be doing something right.''

<HEAD>Karl Marx Rediscovered as China Stresses Ideological Orthodoxy</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JIM ABRAMS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BEIJING (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Karl Marx has been dusted off to do battle
against what Chinese leaders regard as the serious threat of
liberal thinking.
   Marxist theory is making a strong comeback in China as students,
their democracy movement crushed, file off to political education
classes and Commmunist Party leaders, trying to figure out what
went wrong, return to their ideological roots.
   The basic theories and tenets of Marxism have been ``lashed by
trends of bourgeois liberalization,'' party theorists concluded at
a recent meeting. The main reason for the student protests of this
past spring, they said, was ``serious confusion in ideology and
theory.''
   The conservative leadership in charge since the military
crackdown in early June on the democracy movement is now moving to
correct ideological heresy.
   The official press is bombarding readers with commentaries on
the need to study Marxist-Leninist thought. People are constantly
being reminded that ``only socialism can save China and without the
Communist Party there would be no new China.''
   The Guangming Daily, a newspaper for Chinese intellectuals,
noted recently that critics say Marxism ``combined with China's
feudalism to form feudalist Marxism.'' But it contended history has
proved that ``socialism has taken root, germinated, blossomed,
brought forth fruit and stood many severe tests.''
   Marx is on every student's reading list this fall as educators
try to repair the damage done by the democracy movement.
   ``In the days when bourgeois liberalization spread unchecked,
many regarded Marxist theoretical education as a disgusting extra
burden and a troublesome matter which must be studied although it
is useless,'' the Communist Party's People's Daily said.
   ``Why has such a monstrous absurdity happened in a socialist
republic where Marxism is the guiding ideology?''
   On the annual Teachers Day in September, a senior party
official, Song Ping, urged teachers to persuade students of the
superiority of socialism.
   ``Antagonistic forces and those who stubbornly cling to
bourgeois liberal values are doing their utmost to win the younger
generation away from us. Our colleges and universities must never
train our own gravediggers.''
   The Communist Party, concerned about bourgeois or Western
leanings among its 48 million members, is demanding more serious
study of the ideological basics.
   ``We can smash the fond dream of international capitalism'' to
lead China down the capitalist road ``if we use Marxism-Leninism to
arm the broad masses of party members,'' Politburo member Qiao Shi
told students at the Central Party School.
   Deng Xiaoping, the senior leader best known outside China for
introducing market-oriented reforms that challenged basic tenets of
the state-planned economy, is now being hailed for creative
contributions to Marxism.
   Political theory took a new leap forward, the People's Daily
said, when Deng in 1979 came up with the concept of the ``four
principles'' _ allegiance to the socialist system, the dictatorship
of the people, the Communist Party and Marxist-Leninist, Mao
Tse-tung thought.
   Marxist thought has always been a guiding force for the party,
but in recent years the prevailing feeling as been that some of
what the 19th century philosopher was saying was no longer
applicable to 20th century political and economic forces.
   In December 1985 the People's Daily noted that Marx had been
dead for 101 years and ``we cannot depend on the works of Marx and
Lenin to solve our modern-day questions.'' The next day it put out
an awkward correction, saying Marx can't solve ``all'' problems.
   The day after that the Guangming Daily said, ``If new ideas are
not implemented and new Marxist conclusions and answers are not
brought forth, then so-called support for the basic tenets of
Marxism will only be empty talk.''
   Last year the same newspaper, now a bastion of support for the
battle against liberalism, commented that there are mistakes in the
works of Marx, Engels and Lenin and that China must ``pluck up its
courage to restudy capitalism'' so as to ``creatively develop
Marxist theory.''
   The final insult appeared to come on May Day when for the first
time in three decades huge portraits of Marx, Engels, Lenin and
Stalin failed to appear on Tiananmen Square for the annual labor
day celebrations.
   But Marx now is definitely back in the fold.

<HEAD>Deep Sea Diver Jacques Piccard to Take Tourists Underwater</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CYRIL TUOHY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CULLY, Switzerland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Three decades after he and a U.S. Navy
officer set a world record by diving as deep in the sea as
jetliners fly high in the sky, the Swiss deep-sea researcher
Jacques Piccard has designed a submarine for tourists.
   It will be launched in the spring by a private company and will
offer passengers ``an uncommon way to share the riches of the sea.''
   The $4-million craft, which will seat 16 people and a crew of
two, is nearing completion at a Swiss plant in Winterthur.
   It will be somewhat roomier than the bathyscaph ``Trieste'' that
went down 32,748 feet to Challenger Deep at the bottom of the
Marianas Trench in the Pacific on Jan. 23, 1960, with Piccard and
Lt. Don Walsh on board.
   Exploring life underwater has since filled most of the
67-year-old Piccard's life. He has done research for universities,
governments, and the police, collecting marine samples, and
checking up on underwater pipelines.
   ``We have found everything from automobile tires to aircraft
down there,'' he said.
   He still boards his small ``working sub'' about twice a week,
diving in Lake Geneva, Western Europe`s largest freshwater body.
   Launched in 1979, the sub named after the Swiss scientist F.A.
Forel has been used on scientific, industrial, and recovery
missions in many European lakes as well as in the Mediterranean.
   In 1969, Piccard and five other scientists spent a month
exploring the Gulf Stream in the mesoscaphe Ben Franklin, also
designed by him. But he says none matched the experience he had on
his world record dive.
   ``By far the most interesting find was the fish that came
floating by our porthole at the bottom of the Challenger Deep,'' he
said in an interview. ``We were astounded to find higher marine
life forms down there at all.''
   Having more people share the riches of the sea is an idea
initiated by his father, Auguste Piccard, who also made scientific
history in the stratosphere in the early 1930s, ascending 50,400
feet in a balloon of his own design.
   ``I came up with the idea of sending tourists underwater and it
was my father who designed the world's first tourist submarine,''
Piccard said.
   During the Swiss National Exhibition in 1964, the father's
submarine carried more than 30,000 people to the depths of Lake
Geneva.
   Jacques Piccard's new 33-ton, 40-foot PX44 has several more
sophisticated features and more advanced electronic equipment than
his father's.
   It will cruise at three miles an hour and be capable of diving
to 300 feet on tours of up to 40 minutes, Piccard said.
   Powerful searchlights and large portholes will bring the depths
of the sea to brilliant life for the passengers entering the world
of scuba divers in relaxed, first-class comfort.
   But for Piccard, the PX44 will also help bring greater awareness
of the environmental threats to the world's seas.
   ``For me, the more people discover the sea, the greater the
chance of bringing marine issues into public view and the better
off we will all be,'' he said.

<TEXT>
   For the past several months,
16-year-old Marcio Santos Martins has been closely following the
nine candidates running in Brazil's presidential-election campaign.
   That's because he'll be casting a ballot for one of them on Nov.
15 in the nation's first direct presidential election in 29 years.
   Brazil has lowered the voting age from 18 to 16, the only
country in the world other than Nicaragua to allow citizens so
young to vote.
   ``Why shouldn't I be excited?'' said Martins, a prep-school
student. ``Just because I'm 16 doesn't mean I'm not politically
mature or don't take voting seriously.''
   The lowering of the voting age is not expected to have any
dramatic effect the outcome of the election. Just 4.5 million
Brazilians under 18 _ less than 6 percent of the total voting
population of 81.5 million _ registered to vote by the Aug. 6
deadline, according to the government's Supreme Electoral Tribunal.
   In addition, none of the presidential front-runners has made a
special drive to attract voters under 18.
   But the voting experiment has sparked harsh debate across this
country of 144 million people on the role teen-agers should play in
Brazilian society.
   ``Young Brazilians today are being confronted with reality at an
earlier age,'' said Helena Quadrado, director of the
McCann-Erickson reserch and planning department in Sao Paulo,
Brazil's biggest city. ``They are more equipped to make such
decisions at their age than teen-agers of past generations.''
   In Brazil, 16-year-olds can work, pay taxes, marry and open bank
accounts, she said.
   Supporters also say television, radio and a stronger educational
system have produced a generation that is better-informed and
prepared to take on the responsibility of voting than young people
30 years ago.
   Allowing 16- and 17-year-olds to vote will help cement democracy
in Brazil's nascent republic and discourage the young from tacitly
accepting future military takeovers, said Sen. Afonso Arinos of Rio
de Janeiro, a leading of the lower voting age.
   The military seized power in 1964 and did not relinquish it
until 1985, when the civilian Jose Sarney took office as president
after a military-controlled electoral college vote.
   Critics of the lower voting age contend that teen-agers lack
experience in decision-making and will fall prey to campaign
jingoism and flash instead of focusing on substantive issues.
   ``People under 18 are not psychologically mature enough to
comprehend the meaning or importance of their vote,'' said Celso
Bastos, a law professor at the University of Sao Paulo.
   But the expectation surrounding the months leading up to the
election also seem to typify the mood of many young registered
voters.
   Angered by indecision and charges of nepotism in their
government and frustrated by shrinking job markets and spiraling
inflation, Brazil's young view their vote as a tool for drastic
change, surveys and interviews show.
   Young people, though aware of the economic strains imposed by
Brazil's $110-billion foreign debt, overwhelmingly blame official
corruption for the nation's problems, according to a recent survey
of youths 15 to 24 years old in Rio and Sao Paulo.
   ``More and more teen-agers are realizing that we ourselves are
one of the last hopes for turning our country around,'' said Ana
Paula Nascimento, 16, a high school student in Brasilia, the
national capital.
   Overwhelmingly, the most pressing problem facing the country's
new leader is inflation, now runnign at 1,084 percent a year.
   ``My friends talk often about economics and what it'll be like
when we finish school,'' said Elma Silva dos Reis, 17, a student in
an English-language institute in the southeastern city of Juiz de
Fora. ``We never talked this way until a few years ago.''
   A depressed educational system, environmental abuse in the
Amazon, violence and social injustice are other prominent issues
for Brazil's newest voters.
   As a result, Brazilian teen-agers are turning to liberal
candidates who advocate socialist-oriented economic reform.
   ``The right wing has been running the country for years and look
how things are,'' said Edno Alberto Braz Serafim, 16, a Rio
student. He said he plans to vote for Luis Inacio Lula da Silva of
the far-left Workers' Party.
   One right-of-center candidate that has appealed to young voters
is Fernando Collor de Mello, a 40-year-old upstart candidate from
Brazil's poor Northeast who has pledged to clean up government.
   ``He's new blood,'' said Mariela Garcia, 16, another Rio
student. ``He hasn't gotten himself wound up in scandals. That's
important to a lot of young people.''
   Many 16- and 17-year-olds consider their new right a priviledge.
   ``We're expected to perform more like adults each day,'' said
17-year-old Carlos Enrique de Souza, a Rio student. ``Giving us the
chance to vote lets us express how we feel about the changes around
us.''

<HEAD>Budget Sequester Awaits on Oct. 1</HEAD>
<HEAD>An AP News Analysis</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By WALTER R. MEARS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Special Correspondent</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Like a bureaucratic bogeyman, a dreaded
``sequester'' is lurking at the gates of government.
   That's federal jargon for an automatic cut in spending, required
by law if Congress and the White House don't settle on a
deficit-reduction plan by Oct. 16. The word ``sequester'' actually
is a verb meaning to set apart, withhold or confiscate.
   ``...We are drifting toward a sequester,'' Rep. Newt Gingrich of
Georgia, the Republican whip, said the other day, and blamed the
Democratic leadership in Congress for the prospect of what he said
would be a bureaucratic nightmare.
   The word and the partisan argument will be repeated frequently
in the debate that begins in the House this week on a comprehensive
budget bill that is supposed to trim the projected federal deficit
below the legal limit of $110 billion, a measure now snarled in the
dispute over taxes.
   Unless the budget bill is law before Oct. 16, automatic budget
cuts will have to be ordered to enforce the deficit ceiling. And
President Bush says he will veto any budget bill that includes a
tax rate increase _ like the one House Democratic leaders want to
put into the measure.
   All of that raises the likelihood that at least the first phase
of the deficit control law _ the jargon for that is
``Gramm-Rudman'' _ will be triggered next month. The president then
would order across-the-board spending cuts to hold the anticipated
deficit under the ceiling.
   Another wrinkle: if the deficit goals are met prior to the
deadline, there's $10 billion in leeway. But if the automatic cuts
are triggered, that cushion is eliminated and the limit becomes
$100 billion.
   All of that was put into place to do something about the
worsening deficit habit. In 1987, the system was triggered and
President Reagan had to order about $23 million in spending cuts in
order to meet the limits of the law. They took effect only
temporarily.
   Republicans now are saying that it could happen for real this
time. ``... Maybe we'll have the first real taste of Gramm-Rudman
across-the-board sequester in order to accomplish the $100 billion
deficit that's required by that law,'' said Sen. Pete Domenici,
R-N.M.
   Domenici, ranking Republican on the budget committee, said the
Office of Management and Budget would have to draw up cuts of about
5.3 percent in domestic programs and 4.6 percent in defense in
order to come up with about $16.8 billion in savings. That process
would begin Oct. 1.
   But it will be a while before anything really happens. Even if
the cuts actually took effect, they would not be locked into place
for 30 days. The cuts triggered in 1987 never did become permanent;
government agencies got their money back after the administration
and Congress negotiated a budget agreement.
   This fall's budget measure was stalled even before it became the
arena for a tax fight that echoes the presidential campaign of
1988. Bush won committee approval of his proposed capital gains tax
cut over the opposition of Democratic leaders, and they now have
drafted a rival plan including an income tax rate increase on the
wealthiest taxpayers.
   ``I will veto a rate increase,'' Bush said in a Thursday night
television interview. ``...I have sent that signal up to the Hill.''
   ``Well then, we'll try to send it to him and let him veto it,''
House Speaker Thomas S. Foley retorted on Friday.
   Gingrich said the president told Republican congressional
leaders he was not going to accept take-ot-or-leave-it budget bills
including amendments he would veto if they stood alone.
   That draws lines for the argument over who will be to blame if
there are, indeed, automatic spending cuts for popular programs.
And in debates like this one, those are the programs that get the
attention. That's standard procedure. So the Office of Management
and Budget has warned that cuts could force such measures as
three-day layoffs of air traffic controllers and reductions in
loans and grants for needy college students.
   ``I think we're going to see one of the most important periods
of the Bush presidency in the next 45 days,'' Gingrich said. He
said it will be ``a real test of will'' between the Democrats and
the president, with the Democrats ``apparently willing to
potentially risk sequester'' to get their programs.

   Today is Sunday, Oct. 1, the 274th day of 1989. There are 91
days left in the year.
   Today's highlight in history:
   On Oct. 1, 1908, Henry Ford introduced the Model T to the
market, at a cost of $825 per car. More than 15 million were sold
before the Model T was discontinued.
   On this date:
   In 1800, Spain ceded Louisiana to France in a secret treaty.
   In 1885, special delivery mail service began in the United
States.
   In 1903, the Pittsburgh Pirates defeated the home team Boston
Pilgrims 7-3, in the first World Series game. Boston went on to win
the series, five games to three.
   In 1936, Gen. Francisco Franco was proclaimed the head of an
insurgent Spanish state.
   In 1943, Allied forces captured Naples during World War II.
   In 1949, 40 years ago, Communist Party Chairman Mao Tse-tung
raised the first flag of the People's Republic of China in a
proclamation ceremony in Peking.
   In 1961, Roger Maris hit his 61st home run during a 162-game
season, in comparison to Babe Ruth's 60 home runs during a 154-game
season.
   In 1962, Johnny Carson succeeded Jack Paar as permanent host of
NBC-TV's ``Tonight'' show.
   In 1964, 25 years ago, the Free Speech Movement was launched at
the University of California at Berkeley as students began to
demand the right to engage in political activities on campus.
   In 1968, the cult horror movie classic ``Night of the Living

   The new season brings a new reason for
thinking you're still looking at the summer festival of rejected
pilots on network television.
   Have you seen ABC's ``Chicken Soup'' or ``Homeroom'' or CBS'
``Top of the Hill?''
   No wonder the three networks are losing viewers to alternative
viewing. No wonder their share of the audience is down to 62
percent. The share dropped below 60 percent during the summer.
   The fall season got under way officially last week, and the
offerings are mixed.
   First, the good news.
   Stephanie Beacham, last seen vamping on ``Dynasty,'' has taken
the vows and borrowed the tongue of an asp to have a go at NBC's
``Sister Kate.'' She rides herd on a group of unruly orphans who
are the dickens. (Sorry, Charles.) It does have a nice twist and
great expectations.
   ``The Famous Teddy Z'' on CBS is the kind of agent your mother
would want you to take home. Laughing all the way, of course.
Creator Hugh Wilson is at his best tilting his lance at Hollywood,
and actor Jon Cryer makes the little twerp endearing.
   ABC's ``Life Goes On'' is a satisfying story of a family coping
with the usual problems plus a teen-age son with Down's syndrome.
Christopher Burke, who has the genetic condition himself, is Corky,
and if you don't watch out he'll charm your socks off.
   ABC's ``The Young Riders'' shows promise. It follows a group of
Pony Express riders whom one critic called ``hunks on horseback.''
Anyway, it's great to see another Western on the air.
   NBC's ``Hardball'' looks tolerable. Its premise of a
hard-charging cop getting on in years who struggles to keep up with
his young partner is an interesting one.
   Here's the bad news.
   ABC's ``Chicken Soup'' appears to be on its way to becoming a
smash hit. Simply because if follows ``Roseanne.'' Scheduled
anywhere else this show would be gone in a few weeks. It's not
funny and it has no charm. The so-called ``Abie's Irish Rose''
romance between Jackie Mason and Lynn Redgrave doesn't generate
enough heat to warm a flea. Mason, even at his cheeriest, comes
across like a messenger of Doom.
   CBS' ``Top of the Hill'' started with great potential. The
surfer son of an ailing congressman takes over his seat in the
House. His idealism clashes with political realism. It has touches
of ``Mr. Smith Goes to Washington.'' That lasted about five
minutes. Rep. Tom Bell, played by William Katt, quickly becomes
involved in freeing a federal agent being held by a drug lord in a
Latin American country.
   The State Department doesn't want to upset a friendly
government, so no official action is taken. The possibilities for a
Contra-type story arise. Kelsey Grammer does a nice turn as an
``ugly American'' foreign service officer, but otherwise forget it.
Bell's heroics become so unbelievable you expect Katt to get back
into his costume from ``The Greatest American Hero.''
   ABC's ``Homeroom'' will never move to the head of the class. Not
funny, no appeal.
   NBC's ``Nutt House'' is too much shtick. While Harvey Korman and
Cloris Leachman are marvelously loony, the show needs one sane
person for them to revolve around.
   Fox's ``Alien Nation'' should just get on with telling its
stories and lay off the heavy-handed preaching. We don't need to be
hit over the head to get its message of tolerance.
   CBS' ``The People Next Door'' is the kind of show that makes you
wonder what's happening to the neighborhood. Tain't funny, McGee.
   No hard opinions yet either way: ABC's ``Doogie Howser, M.D.,''
CBS' ``Island Son,'' ABC's ``Family Matters,'' CBS' ``Peaceable
Kingdom.''
   CBS' ``Snoops'' and NBC's ``Mancuso, FBI'' are still unseen, but
the expectations are high.

   Elsewhere in television:
   HARD BOILED _ Robert Urich, formerly of ``Spenser: For Hire,''
is back in the detective business in the CBS movie ``Night Walk.''
He investigates a mysterious murder in the movie scheduled for
Sunday, Oct. 1. But, unlike Spenser, Urich says, ``This guy is not
quite in control of his life.''
   `HEE HAW' _ ``Hee Haw'' is back for its 22nd season. The show
first began in 1969 as a temporary replacement on CBS for ``The
Smothers Brothers Comedy Hour.'' Although it was a hit, CBS kept
trying to cancel it and finally succeeded in 1971. It's been in
syndication since then.

   Author Saul Bellow once said a novel ``is
balanced between a few true impressions and the multitude of false
ones that make up most of what we call life.''
   Could the same be said about the economy? You judge.
   _We continue to experience the longest peactime economic
expansion in our history, an experience that is often
misinterpreted to mean that these are the best of economic times.
   They may not be. By some measures they might even be among the
worst of times, perhaps the worst in 50 years, and that brings us
back to the Great Depression of the 1930s.
   Speaking recently to a meeting of the Construction Industry
Institute in Seattle, investment advisor John Wright pointed out
that the economy has grown at an average of more than 4 percent a
year since 1982.
   That growth, he observed, has come not from a normal level of
economic activity but from one that was extremely depressed. So far
in the 1980s, the economy has grown at just a 2.5 percent annual
rate in real terms.
   Unless the economy grows more than twice as fast as now appears
likely, he said, ``the decade of the 1980s will be the worst decade
for economic growth since the 1930s.''
   Worse, it follows a decade that wasn't much better. After 30
years of growth averaging more than 4 percent, the U.S. economy has
grown only 2.5 percent a year for nearly 20 years.
   If this is prosperity, he asks, why are average hourly earnings
in the nonfarm sector of the economy no higher than they were a
decade and a half ago?
   _Two other misimpressions of the economy, or aspects of it, tend
to support the observation by Benjamin Franklin that, ``half the
truth is often a great lie.''
   1. It is often believed that until the big crash of October
1987, increasingly affluent Americans were becoming more active
buyers of corporate stocks. It isn't so.
   Federal Reserve figures show that since 1968 households have
been net sellers of stock in all but one year. In that time, the
percentage of household financial assets held as stocks has fallen
to 19.6 percent from 43.4 percent.
   Following the 1987 debacle, the University of Michigan's Survey
Research Center sought reasons why the impact didn't spread, as
forecast. One finding, startling to many people at the time, was
that so few families owned any stock.
   2. An impression exists that housing has been priced beyond the
means of most Americans, a notion that probably results from some
of the so-called affordability indexes.
   It isn't true, and probably couldn't be true for an extended
period of time before supply and demand corrected the disparity. In
defining ``affordability'' these indexes usually relate the median
price of a typical one-family home to the median income of
Americans.
   Median, of course, means that one-half the houses are below the
figure cited and one-half the incomes are above the income cited.
That leaves many thousands of households, each with ability to buy
one of thousands of houses.
   None of these families is required to buy the median-priced
house; smart ones might find equally good houses for much less.
Some seek two-family units. Some prefer to rent rather than buy.
They're not priced out; they choose out.
   The indexes are merely guides. When they rise, it is more
difficult to buy; when they fall it is relatively easier to buy,
assuming other factors remain stable.
   Money Magazine points out still another misimpression about our
economic life. It announces that the common image of Americans
casting aside their aging parents for nursing homes is largely a
myth.
   It claims that only 6 percent of all Americans 65 and older live
in nursing homes, while 70 perecent of the country's dependent
elderly get all their care from family and friends.
   Do not despair if you held such notions. Said Washington Irving
a long time ago: ``The ability to discern between that which is
true and that which is false is one of the last attainments of the
human mind.''

<HEAD>War-Weary Afghans Divided Over Role for Former King</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KATHY GANNON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   One name arises more than any other
in the pursuit of a peaceful settlement of the 11-year-old civil
war in Afghanistan: Zahir Shah, the king who was ousted in 1973
after 40 years on the throne.
   Almost all the parties involved in the conflict between the
communist government and Moslem guerrillas have reasons both to
accept him and reject him.
   The 74-year-old former monarch, now living in exile in Rome, has
said he is willing to serve his people if they want him.
   The ruling People's Democratic Party of Afghanistan has proposed
Zahir repeatedly as the only neutral figure who could head a
temporary, transitional administration if hostilities cease.
   But the mujahedeen rebels _ Islamic ``holy warriors'' _ are
deeply divided over what role, if any, Zahir should play in
Afghanistan.
   Seven allied mujahedeen parties based in Pakistan have formed
their own Afghan government-in-exile, or ``interim'' government,
but it excludes eight, smaller rebel groups based in Iran.
   The most radical Moslem rebel groups have branded Zahir a
traitor who let Soviet influence flourish during his reign. They
claim the Soviets gained a toehold through extensive financial
investment in the country's infrastructure and that this eventually
led to the Soviet military invasion of Afghanistan in 1979.
   But delegations of mujahedeen field commanders, many from the
royalist stronghold of southern Afghanistan, have issued calls for
the return of the king.
   Zahir's rule ended when Afghanistan's fledgling Marxist parties
rallied behind his cousin, Mohammad Daoud, who toppled him in a
bloodless coup.
   But when Daoud tried to distance himself from Moscow, his former
communist allies, the People's Democratic Party of Afghanistan,
killed him in 1978 and seized power.
   The coup set off a widespread insurgency that included
royalists, Moslem fundamentalists and tribal leaders. Moscow sent
its forces in 1979 to replace one People's Democratic Party
government with another, but it failed to put down the rebellion.
The Soviets withdrew the last of their combat forces last Feb. 15.
   ``Zahir Shah takes a very grave risk of being shot if he returns
to Afghanistan,'' said Nawab Salim, a spokesman in Pakistan for the
extremist Hezb-i-Islami rebel group, one of the most powerful.
``The mujahedeen will not let Zahir Shah come to Afghanistan.''
   Abdul Rahim, a spokesman of the guerrillas' interim government,
said the former king's return ``would mean the mujahedeen and the
people of Afghanistan are defeated.''
   However, in July 1987, a prominent Afghan intellectual and
author, Sayd Majrooh, asked a random sampling of 2,000 Afghan
refugees among more than 3 million who reside in Pakistan whom they
preferred as Afghanistan's leader and 71 percent replied they
favored Zahir Shah.
   The royalists among the mujahedeen, most notably the National
Islamic Front of Afghanistan led by Syed Gailani, say the former
king is the only Afghan able to rally warring factions.
   Azim Nasser-Zia, a spokesman for Gailani's group, said Zahir
embodies the Afghans' strong respect for traditions.
   ``The most important thing is tradition,'' Nasser-Zia added.
``Not just anyone can come and claim a leadership role in
Afghanistan. No one else has emerged during these last 11 or 12
years as a unifying force.''
   But Nasser-Zia said the Zahir will not return to Afghanistan
until President Najib is out of power.
   He said that if the Zahir were to head a transitional
administration, he would convene a grand council to oversee
elections and then step aside.
   Pakistan, which has channeled millions of dollars' worth of U.S.
weapons to the mujahedeen, professes impartiality to a political
settlement of the Afghan war.
   However, Pakistan's policies often have coincided with those
rebel groups who say they will settle for nothing less than an
all-Islamic Afghan government.
   ``The Zahir Shah option is no option,'' Gen. Aslam Beg, chief of
staff of Pakistan's army, said at a news conference.
   The United States has acknowledged it sent envoys to talk to
Zahir Shad twice in September.
   Hekmatyar, the Hezb-i-Islami leader and a major recipient of
U.S. military aid, called the meetings a sellout to Moscow intended
to blunt the Moslem fundamentalists' power in any future Afghan
government.
   ``U.S. attempts are in fact aimed at suppressing the Islamic
resurgence in Afghanistan as well as in other countries, pursuing
the policy of `nip the evil in the bud' so that the wave of Islamic
reawakening throughout the world can be contained,'' Hekmatyar said
in a press statement.
   The hardline mujahedeen groups claim Zahir watched silently in
luxurious exile as Soviet troops invaded Afghanistan in 1979.
   ``He never cared about the jihad (holy war),'' said Rahim, the
``interim'' government spokesman. ``He never participated
practically.''

   There is a booming new marketplace for comedy in
the tradition of vaudeville and the coffeehouses and cafes of the
mid-century. Comedy clubs are drawing a million people a month and
$500 million a year. They are also serving as a farm system for
television's growing demand for comics.

<TEXT>
   Call it a laughter explosion.
   Ten years ago there were fewer than 20 comedy clubs in the
United States. Today there are some 225 of them out there,
dedicated to making people laugh for a $10 to $20 cover charge and
the price of a drink or two.
   It's a growth rate of nine clubs a year for the last quarter of
a century. And thousands of comics are laughing their way to the
bank. They can find work on some 700 stages where comics are
featured, not to mention the growing number of comedy shows on
television.
   It's a $500 million-a-year business that draws a million people
a month and shows no sign of abating.
   The comedy clubs have become a vast farm system for television's
insatiable appetite for talent. There are an estimated 10,000
working comedians vying for the stage.
   Home Box Office is beginning a 24-hour cable comedy channel in
November, and MTV has one in the planning stage. For the thousands
of comics out there, they would become huge showcases for talent.
   Headliners at comedy clubs are paid as much as $10,000 a week.
In the big-time halls, with seating in the thousands, headliners
can draw $100,000 a week. Not bad in a business in which most start
at about $25 a night. Naturally, few make it to the top.
   Once there was vaudeville, which gave birth to the likes of Bob
Hope, Milton Berle and Red Skelton. Then there were the
coffeehouses and cafes that spawned the likes of Mort Sahl, Woody
Allen, Bob Newhart and Bill Cosby.
   Then, in 1963, Bud Friedman and his wife opened New York's first
comedy club, the Improvisation. When they divorced, she kept the
New York showcase, and he opened the Improvisation in Los Angeles
and now heads a chain of Improvs.
   Whether it is the Punch Line in Atlanta and nine Punch Line
franchises in other Southern cities, or the Laff Stop in Houston,
or the Funny Bone in St. Louis, or Byfield's and Zanies in Chicago,
or the Holy City Zoo in San Francisco, or Comedy Underground in
Seattle, or the Comedy Connection in Boston, or the Comedy Store in
Los Angeles, or Caroline's in New York City, or any of half a dozen
Catch A Rising Stars from Princeton, N.J., to Palo Alto, Calif., to
Boston, the stream of talent seems endless.
   The comedy clubs are places where young comics can hone their
talents before a live audience. They also offer a mirror for the
changing face of humor. For instance:
   Sex jokes are passe. They don't shock audiences anymore. So now
the young comics play games with personal relationships, the
blurring of sexual roles and distinctions. Mother-in-law jokes are
out, but mothers and fathers make great material.
   This glittering city, where they say good luck instead of good
morning, is one of the brightest beacons for young comics on the
make. It has helped launch many of them to stardom: Robin Williams,
Bill Murray, Billy Crystal, Sandra Bernhard, Eddie Murphy, John
Belushi, Judy Tenuta, Richard Pryor, Roseanne Barr to name a few.
   Pam Matteson is a striking redhead from Brooklyn. She has been
aping other people's accents since she put on her own sidewalk
shows as an 8-year-old, tap dancing to ``How High the Moon'' and
singing ``Chattanooga Choo Choo,'' songs her father taught her.
   On one particular night she is winding up a week at Catch A
Rising Star, an opulent club room in the Bally Resort Hotel on the
Las Vegas Strip. She has the audience, most of them sitting on
sofa-like seats, hanging on her every word.
   She is the daughter of a retired Irish cop and an Italian
mother, she says. ``That's why I drink a lot and kill people.''
   It is the rare comic who is over 40 these days. Matteson says
she is ``a good 28.''
   And the lines roll on, jesting at family, anyone's; quartering
religion, anyone's.
   Glen Schwartz, who says he has the only comedy-only public
relations agency in the country, says when you publicize actors you
emphasize the physical, the hair, the looks. ``But when you
publicize the comedian, it's the vanity of the mind. These people
think, they observe. They're going to tell you what you already
know, but you're going to think you thought of it for the very
first time, and you'll laugh.
   ``You can't teach an actor to be a comic, but you can teach a
comic how to act.''
   Twice a year comics get together, at the Montreal International
Comedy Festival in July and the Comedy Convention in Las Vegas.
Established comics take the stages in Montreal, and up-and-comers
are showcased in Vegas. Some 200 comics from all over the world go
to Montreal expenses-paid. The Las Vegas show plops hopefuls in
front of the powerful people who hire.

   Then the comics have their own affair on HBO, have had for the
last three years, proceeds going to the nation's homeless. This
year's hosts were Whoopi Goldberg, Robin Williams and Billy
Crystal. The show is called, what else, ``Comic Relief.''
   Some 110 of the comic clubs subscribe to a New York-published
handout for guests, patterned after Broadway's Playbill, called
LaughTrack. It is the product of Josh Abrams, who says it brings in
several million dollars a year, gross.
   It supplies a number of short features on comedy and comics. In
March it took notice of the heart-attack death at age 40 of
comedian Ronnie Shakes in 1987, and noted in retrospect some of his
ironic humor seen and heard on the Johnny Carson show:
   ``I know when I die, I'm going to hell. I know it's hot down
there. But is it humid? Because a dry heat I can take, but that
humidity, that'll kill you. And what about heaven? Is every day the
same, or should I bring a light jacket?''
   Once Ron remembered asking his father, ``We're born, we live and
we die. So what is the purpose of life?'' His father answered,
``Ronnie, tax purposes.''
   Richard Fields, who took Catch A Rising Star public and just
sold his original Catch for more than a million shares in the new
company, is expanding. Catch has an agreement with Hyatt Hotels and
Bally Resorts to open clubs in some of those establishments. It
already has a free-standing Catch in Cambridge, Mass., and clubs in
Hyatt Hotels in Chicago, Princeton, N.J., Oak Brook, Ill., and Palo
Alto, Calif.
   The suburban and university locations are not by chance. Fields
says they are targeting areas with high concentrations of tourists
and relatively young, upper middle-class people. Reno's Bally may
be next on the Catch list, and Fields says he is looking at
locations in the Los Angeles area.
   Las Vegas' Catch should gross just under $2 million a year at
this point, he says.
   While it does not act as agent for young comics, Catch's other
function is to manage their careers for from 15 percent to 20
percent of the gross. It can offer them booking at a number of
clubs and promotion and exposure to the TV and Hollywood producers.
   Caroline Hirsch, who runs Caroline's at the South Street Seaport
in New York City, says her 150-seat room grosses over $2 million a
year, by running nearly full three nights a week and selling out
four nights. Cover charges range from $10 to $20, depending on the
talent. The cover pays for the comics and advertising.
   But a lot of the talent that started with her in a small 87-seat
room uptown are priced out of her market now, people such as Steven
Wright, Andrew Dice Clay, Pee Wee Herman, Sandra Bernhardt and
Roseanne Barr. ``They're on to the next part of their careers,''
she says.
   Mostly she makes no attempt to censor the material, but
sometimes she feels she has no choice. ``There have been times when
people have gotten into AIDS jokes and I take a little offense to
making fun of homosexuality in the vein of people dying,'' she
says. ``I told one person to knock it off, I don't like it, don't
do it.''
   But, says Hirsch, a feminist, they're up there making fun of
women and everything else. ``That's O.K.''
   For Judy Tenuta, who started in a Chicago blues club called
Kingston Mines and now is on the road touring university clubs in
Texas, religion is what works.
   Southern audiences love her, Tenuta says, ``because these people
want to be spanked with a Bible belt, and because of my religion,
Judy-ism, I shake them up.''
   She considers herself ``a living saint,'' she says. ``Even
though I came from a large Catholic family, I was always the
isolated petite flower. I always heard voices and the saints talked
to me. When I was little, I was kind of forced to play the
accordion. At the same time I had six brothers so I had to practice
in the closet while they watched the Bears game. I learned to play
`Lady of Spain' in the dark.''
   Each comic has his or her own material. Richard Belzer, a
successful comedian now living in Beverly Hills, says his allergies
are ignorance and Ronald Reagan, his favorite performer is Pinky
Lee, his personal heroes are Moyshe Dayan and Miles Davis. His most
irrational act, he says, was registering to vote. His most
irrational fear: the reunification of Germany.

   Bill Liddell, a retired seed company executive,
spends 10 months of the year growing food for the poor. So far,
he's donated 100,000 pounds of produce. But he doesn't consider
himself a do-gooder, just a veteran gardener enjoying a productive
_ and fruitful _ retirement.

<DATELINE>HAMDEN, Conn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   When Bill Liddell first contacted the
Connecticut Food Bank, Nancy Carrington ``envisioned yet another
guy with half a bag of tomatoes and cucumbers.''
   ``He presented himself very modestly, a guy growing a garden and
having some surplus to donate,'' says Carrington, the food bank's
interim director.
   But the tall, rumpled man with scrambled white hair who showed
up had 50 pounds of summer squash, followed in short order by 350
pounds more. The squash harvested, he moved on to sweet corn, then
tomatoes. Just after Labor Day, he started on greens.
   By the end of the summer of 1985, Liddell had delivered 7,000
pounds of produce to the food bank's warehouse in New Haven. The
staff was impressed, but he brushed off their thanks.
   ``You ain't seen nothing,'' he said. ``Wait'll next year.''
   ``A little better organized'' in 1986, Liddell donated 16,000
pounds of home-grown vegetables.
   In 1987, he topped 26,000 pounds.
   Last year, when the skies dried up and the sun beat down until
the soil cracked like an over-baked cake, Liddell harvested 28,000
pounds of food from his rocky three-fifths of an acre, all of it
destined for Connecticut's poor.
   But don't get the wrong idea about Bill Liddell. Just because a
guy spends 40 hours a week on his 69-year-old knees growing food
for the poor, and urges others to follow his example, is no reason
to brand him a do-gooder.
   ``I'm no Mother Teresa,'' he says.
   What he is is a veteran gardener who found himself face-to-face
with retirement, a divorced father of four grown kids with no
hobbies beyond the joys of coaxing fruit, flowers and vegetables
out of the recalcitrant earth.
   As Bill Liddell sees it, his giveaway garden is less an act of
altruism than an act of survival.
   ``I've known retired people with more money than they know what
to do with, but they've had jaws down to here,'' he says, cupping a
dirt-stained hand over his belt buckle.
   ``I started out to keep doing what I've always done. It was not,
`How can I help the poor?', but `What can I do with all this? Oh! I
will give it to the poor.'''
   Until a neighbor suggested a local shelter as a recipient of his
bountiful harvest, ``I knew zero about the homeless.''
   One might assume that a man who spends so much time toiling on
behalf of the hungry and homeless would have pondered the matter,
but, ``I really don't think about it that much. It's too
distressing.
   ``It's a national obscenity. I shouldn't be having to do this
stuff. It's not the way the ball game should be run.''
   End of discussion. Rather than ruminate about politics, he
prefers to contemplate the heft of a cabbage or the sweetness of a
lettuce, raising his voice to be heard over the locusts' buzz.
   It is difficult to lure Liddell out from between the neat,
weedless rows of Anaheim chilies and turnip greens. Guests find
themselves conversing with the muddy soles of his shoes or his
rapidly retreating back as he strides off in mid-sentence to yank a
weed or pulverize a beetle.
   ``He's very single-minded, but a lot of fun to work with,'' says
Jean Heston, one of Liddell's ``migrant workers,'' 16 men and women
who take turns helping plant, weed or pick.
   ``It's one of the enjoyments of my retirement,'' says Heston,
who signed up after Liddell made an appeal at Spring Glen Church.
``He's not a believer, but he does have that instinct to do for
somebody else. He comes to church twice a year, at the beginning to
ask for volunteers, and at the end to say thanks.''
   In the four years since he began, Liddell has seen his produce
become a staple on soup kitchen menus around New Haven, the
nation's seventh poorest city in per capita income.
   The city of 125,000 has two soup kitchens; a third lost its
lease several months ago and runs a food pantry while searching for
new quarters.
   At the Community Soup Kitchen, which serves 75,000 meals a year,
``It's hard to describe how much Bill Liddell means to us,'' says
coordinator David O'Sullivan. ``Very often we get donations from
all kinds of people, and they're all welcome.
   ``But what do you do when someone shows up with five pounds of
tomatoes and you've got 200 people lined up outside? Bill grows
food in quantities we need, and it's all first-rate stuff.''
   The fruits of his labors were instrumental in helping the soup
kitchen expand from soup and bread to full meals.
   The Connecticut Food Bank, where Liddell delivers his
vegetables, is at the heart of a network that distributes food to
350 agencies around the state. Soup kitchens, shelters and food
pantries ``shop'' at the warehouse, paying up to 12 cents a pound
to cover overhead costs.
   For the most part, the food bank subsists on throwaways from the
food industry, Carrington says. Liddell is ``our precedent-setter.
He grows prime, lovely produce that's brought to the food bank
within hours of being picked. He stands alone as an example of how
a simple idea can have a really big impact on people in need.''

   Liddell has donated 100,000 pounds of home-grown tomatoes,
beans, squash, peas, cabbages, lettuce, greens, corn and peppers.
   By his calculation, his three-fifths of an acre has served up
about what the average home gardener might expect from an acre and
a half. But after 35 years working for Asgrow Seed Co., which
donates seed and fertilizer, Liddell isn't your average home
gardener.
   For one thing, his is a 10-month operation, beginning in
February and continuing into December, long after the hardiest
volunteers have succumbed for the winter.
   Last year, he called it quits 10 days before Christmas, after
harvesting a hundred pounds of collards and kale. According to his
careful records, the snow measured 3 inches that day.
   With an eye toward bigger yields and greater efficiency, he
spends evenings scribbling in the large loose-leaf notebooks he
uses to record weather, measure progress and plot strategy.
``Keeping track of yields is like keeping score in golf,'' Liddell
says. So far, despite the blight that wiped out this year's
tomatoes, he's ahead.
   ``You can grow an awful lot if you manage your land right,'' he
says. Since space is limited, he starts most of his seeds in trays,
moving them outdoors just long enough to ``finish'' them. By
limiting the time each vegetable spends in the ground, he can plant
several crops in a given spot over the season.
   In mid-September, he harvested turnips from the same patch that
bore cabbages during the summer. In another section, kale followed
collard greens, which in turn supplanted lettuce.
   ``Plants have certain limits,'' Liddell says. ``When a squash
plant produces a couple of fruits, it's done its job. The name of
the game is to keep it going.'' One way is by picking off mature
leaves and working them into the soil alongside the plant. ``If it
doesn't run into mildew, it'll go on forever.''
   Dense planting is another way to boost production. ``You can
crowd, provided you know how to compensate with extra applications
of fertilizer and water.''
   His three cats help with wildlife control, although insects
still claim their share. Maggots stole 40 percent of last year's
cabbages, but a dusting of organic phosphate saved this year's crop.
   Chemical-free gardening ``is like riding a unicycle _ a neat
trick if you can pull it off, but a hell of a way to get to New
York City.''
   Liddell discovered the joys of the soil while tending a
community garden he shared with other graduate students at Yale
University, where he worked toward a Ph.D. in history during the
late 1940s.
   When teaching jobs proved scarce, he went to work for what was
then Associated Seed Growers Inc. of New Haven. Though he never
billed himself as a plant scientist _ ``I've never had one hour of
formal instruction,'' he says proudly _ his customers were free to
draw their own conclusions about ``Doc'' Liddell.
   He spent much of his career as the company's advertising
director, putting together seed catalogs. ``There ain't no one
around who takes better pictures of vegetables.''
   To accurately depict them, he had first to grow them, a
sufficient excuse for buying a homestead on 1{ acres atop a ridge
in Hamden, just outside New Haven.
   The property came with a strawberry patch and a tractor with a
plow attachment. Sold! ``I also looked briefly at the house.''
   Many of the photogenic peas and symmetrical squashes that showed
up in subsequent catalogs came out of Liddell's garden, a loosely
run affair where weeds flourished alongside vegetables.
   The garden ``was a source of food and relaxation, cheaper than
golf or a boat. Growing food gives you the feeling you're master of
your own destiny. It also gives you fresh vegetables that taste
quite a bit different from the ones you can buy.''
   In time, it became a laboratory of sorts, with Liddell taking
advantage of his access to the company's plant scientists and
experimental varieties of seed.
   Later, as an Asgrow consultant, he traveled the country,
advising customers and picking up tips. ``I have the sort of brain
information sticks to,'' he says, ``like a Harris tweed suit
walking through a burdock field.''
   He'd always intended to keep working indefinitely, but heart
problems and ensuing ailments persuaded him otherwise.
   Mindful of a friend who had retired only to die six months later
of cancer, Liddell resolved not to make any plans. When he retired
in January 1985, he didn't look any further ahead than the 20
75-foot rows of beans he thought he'd plant in the spring.
   Surviving four years has eased his fears somewhat, though most
of his plans still involve next year's crops.
   Almost in spite of himself, the man who insists he's no Mother
Teresa finds himself looking at the bigger picture.
   Under his tutelage, Bethany United Church of Christ volunteers
are in their third year growing cabbages, peppers and beans on
donated land. And last year, members of a Congregational church in
Woodmont grew beans and cabbages on the church's lawn.
   ``I want to see a lot more of that kind of thing,'' says
Liddell, who dreams of a full-scale community effort to feed the
hungry, with a garden at every church and ``a station wagon full of
church people picking up leftover vegetables from farm stands and
delivering them to food banks.''
   ``My days in this are numbered, but I could talk to people,
explain to them, tell them what's possible. All that's lacking is
someone who wants to do it badly enough. You also need expertise,
but if you have the enthusiasm you can learn what you need to
know.''

   In Puerto Rico, which is experiencing one of the
most serious AIDS epidemics in the Western world, a housewife and
her husband have opened a home to care for unwanted children
infected by the virus. It's called Project Love.

<TEXT>
   Marisa Blay was content as a wife,
mother and homemaker until a dream changed her life and led her to
become a guardian of some of the youngest and most-abused victims
of AIDS.
   ``In my dream, I was in heaven and God told me I was going to
hell because he had given me so much and I had never helped anybody
in return,'' she says.
   The result is a non-profit charity called Proyecto Amor, or
Project Love _ Puerto Rico's first home for newborns and toddlers
who are not only infected with the AIDS virus but also have been
battered, neglected or abandoned.
   ``I want the kids nobody wants,'' Mrs. Blay says.
   She and her husband, Jorge, who owns a swimming pool
construction company, used their savings to buy an $85,000 home and
half-acre lot for Proyecto Amor in the San Juan suburb of Rio
Piedras. Local businesses, civic groups and individual donors
provided paint, furniture, clothes and toys.
   After months of untangling red tape with the health authorities,
the home, which Mrs. Blay runs with an assistant, eight nurses and
two cooks, finally opened in July.
   Proyecto Amor is a cheery bungalow surrounded by palms and
broad-leafed tropical plants, with a swing set, a slide and monkey
bars in the back yard. The rooms are airy and freshly painted, the
closets bulge with little dresses and shirts. Bright, new cribs sit
in tidy rows in the three bedrooms.
   ``This is my bed,'' 4-year-old Hilario says proudly, hurrying
over to a crib where he has left his teddy bears from the night
before.
   Hilario, Carmen, 3, and Margarita, 11 months, were the first
children brought to Proyecto Amor. (Their names are changed here at
Mrs. Blay's request.)
   Twelve more children, including a newborn whose drug-addict
mother walked away from her in the hospital, are expected in the
coming months.
   Puerto Rico, with a population of 3.3 million is experiencing
one of the most serious AIDS epidemics in the Western world. Since
1982, there have been 2,940 reported cases of AIDS and authorities
estimate 10 times that number may be infected with the virus.
   Mrs. Blay met Carmen on a visit with her church group to a
shelter for battered children. At the age of 4 months, Carmen had
been left alone in an apartment with two toddler brothers for about
five days.
   She was undernourished and had pneumonia and a fungal infection.
Blood tests determined that she was HIV-positive, a carrier of the
virus that causes acquired immune deficiency syndrome.
   Police picked up Hilario, at the age of 2, wandering the streets
of Old San Juan, the capital's historic district. His mother was a
chronic drug abuser, and he was found to be an AIDS carrier.
   He was taken to the same hospital where Carmen was staying. They
shared a room there for nearly two years, and now they easily play
together around their new home, very much like a brother and sister.
   ``They've been together so long, they have to be together now,''
Mrs. Blay says. ``It's like they're the only one the other's ever
had.''
   Baby Margarita was born to a drug addict with four other
children, and she nearly died of neglect.
   ``She didn't smile. She didn't cry,'' Mrs. Blay says. ``When
they told us about her, they told us she needs a lot of caring, she
needs to be held a lot. She had never been held.''
   Proyecto Amor is licensed as a shelter for up to 15 children
ranging in age from newborn to 7. The Puerto Rico Department of
Social Services pays $2,000 a month for each child, which covers
food, medicine and a $5,000 monthly staff payroll, Mrs. Blay says.
   The Blays, who have two young children of their own, retain
title to the Proyecto Amor property and pay taxes and utility
charges, even though they do not live there. Mrs. Blay says they
plan to build on more rooms if necessary and did not want to ever
give up ownership for fear it would become too much like an
institution.
   ``I want it to work as a home, full of love for these kids, as
long as they last,'' she says.
   Hilario, Carmen and Margarita all appear healthy now, but
medical statistics are stacked against them. Mrs. Blay says she is
trying to prepare herself emotionally for their deaths.
   ``I know that they have a sickness that will one day bring their
lives to an end,'' she says. ``But I have faith they are going to
last a long time.
   ``The little boy and the little girl have told me they're going
to run this house when they grow up.''

   Puerto Rico is experiencing one of
the most serious AIDS epidemics in the Western world.
   Since 1982, there have been 2,940 reported cases of AIDS among
the Caribbean island's 3.3 million residents and authorities
estimate 10 times that number may be infected with the virus.
   Among U.S. cities, only San Francisco and New York reported
higher per capita AIDS cases last year than the capital of San Juan.
   Dr. John Rullan, chief epidemiologist for the Puerto Rico Health
Department, estimates at least 16,000 people, and possibly as many
as 30,000, are infected with the AIDS virus across the island.
   An islandwide survey of households to determine the spread of
AIDS among low-risk groups found HIV infection among one in every
125 people. In San Juan, a city of 1.1 million people, the
infection rate was 1 in 65.
   The danger for children is that needle-sharing drug abusers
account for 58 percent of the AIDS cases reported, increasing the
risk of a rapid spread into the general population, Rullan says.
   Pregnant women who contract AIDS from blood-contaminated needles
or sexual contact with intravenous drug abusers can pass the virus
to their unborn children.
   A study in 1987 at San Juan's University Hospital found 1 in 60
pregnant mothers infected with the AIDS virus. Now, all babies born
in the capital are screened for the infection.
   Jose Toro, executive director of Fundacion SIDA, or the AIDS
Foundation, says there were 64 cases of pediatric AIDS in Puerto
Rico by the end of May. Most of the infected children are being
cared for by parents and relatives, Toro says, but homes can't be
found for 20 to 30 of them.

   Visitors to the old French colonial post of St.
Louis in West Africa are mostly businessmen and backpackers these
days. For good reason. The city is literally falling apart. But, in
a way, that gives it a certain forlorn charm.

<DATELINE>ST. LOUIS, Senegal (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   St. Louis, once the throbbing capital
of a vast French West African empire, has fallen on hard times.
   The atmosphere is still there. In fact, the place reeks of it.
   Palm trees sway. Beige and pink colonial-style buildings with
wrought-iron balconies and flowering bushes line the narrow
streets. Local residents in brilliantly colored dresses and robes
go about their daily business under a tropical African sun.
   One almost expects to see pith-helmeted French army officers and
colonial administrators step from the governor's palace, or emerge
from an afternoon aperitif on the veranda of the Hotel de la Poste.
   More likely, however, is the appearance of a young Senegalese in
his Adidas sneakers and running suit, or perhaps a Land-Rover
filled with expatriate aid workers.
   Horse-drawn carts still clip-clop through the narrow streets.
Their drivers, upon seeing an obviously foreign face, will insist
at some length that the visitor needs to be ambulated someplace.
   The heart of St. Louis is on an island in the Senegal River
estuary. It was from here that Gen. Louis Faidherbe ruled over a
vast chunk of 19th century Africa and ``pacified'' its natives. The
island is connected by the iron Faidherbe Bridge to the mainland
and by two other bridges to the Langue de Barbarie, a spit of land
that separates the island from the waves of the Atlantic Ocean.
   ``St. Louis has been abandoned,'' bemoans Marie Jo Durande, who
runs the 150-year-old Hotel de la Poste.
   ``There are a few tourists who do a circuit from Dakar to the
Casamance in the south and St. Louis,'' says Ms. Durande in an
evening conversation over coffee in a hotel dining room dripping
with atmosphere.
   ``Otherwise, it's mostly businessmen and a few backpackers.''
   City officials are trying to spruce-up the town and make it
attractive to moneyed visitors. A few of the principal historical
buildings are being restored, or at least repainted. But the place
is crumbling faster than it is being stuck back together, which in
itself gives it a certain forlorn charm.
   A prime example of decay is the once-fine Adamson Museum on the
South Point, named after 18th century botanist Michel Adamson,
author of the eight-volume ``Natural History of Senegal.''
   The museum is slowly being swallowed by dust. Examples of
typical Senegalese fauna rot in the display cases, skins falling
away, stuffing ignominiously hanging out. Interesting exhibits of
costumes, artifacts, tools and house-building methods of the
country's many ethnic groups are falling to pieces, the explanatory
labels frequently so yellowed they are illegible.
   Abdul Haidara, director of the Center for Research and
Documentation on Senegal that houses the museum, can only shrug his
shoulders and plod on with the little money that is available.
   St. Louis was founded in 1659, first as a headquarters for
French companies plying trade in gum arabic, ivory, leather, gold
and slaves, and later a colonial and political capital.
   The English snatched it up on several occasions when European
wars spilled over into Africa _ for six months in 1693, from 1758
to 1779, from 1809 to 1816. As a result, several Armstrongs,
O'Haras and Pattersons are numbered among St. Louis families.
   When the Estates General met in Paris during the French
Revolution, St. Louis sent its famous ``Cahier de Doleances,'' or
book of complaints. It was supposed to be from all of the people,
but in reality, according to Haidara, it was a plea from the French
and the mixed-race population.
   ``I've searched in vain and not found the name of one true St.
Louisian in the documents,'' the historian said. ``And the cahiers
mainly demanded `freedom of commerce,' which in those days really
meant the slave trade.''
   At one time, St. Louis served as the capital of the colony of
Senegal, the capital of the federation of territories known as
French West Africa, and capital of Mauritania. The city lost the
first two titles to Dakar, the booming port with deeper, calmer
water farther to the south, and the third to Nouakchott, built
after independence in 1960 on a vacant piece of desert 200 miles
north.
   Leaving the island of St. Louis, and its one stoplight winking
forlornly in a particularly useless spot, one enters another world
on the Langue de Barbarie, a teeming African world of bustling
markets, aggressive colors and hot sand.
   The langue is slowly disappearing.
   Moammar Sourang, president of the Chamber of Commerce, says when
his father wanted to walk to the sea, he had to get up early in the
morning to get there by afternoon. Now, he says the Atlantic is at
his feet. That's a bit of exaggeration, but the land is wearing
away.
   Turning south, one passes through the Guet-Ndar district, 900
yards long by 400 yards wide and packed with 18,000 people, mostly
fishermen. The district and the people are poor. St. Louisians
consider them a crude lot. But the whole area is vibrant and alive,
a contrast with the city, which seems to be holding its breath.

   Bat experts say the winged mammals have gotten a
bum rap, but you won't convince Brett and Bill Whitney, who have
hundreds of them in their attic. And they are not alone, it seems.
Evicting bats from that charming old house in the country presents
some sticky problems.
</TEXT>

<DATELINE>GREENE, N.Y. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Ever since she was a child and a bat flew
into her bedroom one night, Brett Whitney has feared the little
monsters. Now she's scared to death.
   It all began when she and her husband, Bill, bought a
century-old farmhouse in upstate New York, not knowing the attic
was a roost for 1,600 of the night-flying creatures.
   ``I've never heard of this many bats in a house before,'' Brett
Whitney says.
   At dusk, the sky blackens and fills with screeches as hundreds
of bats pour out of the house, spreading their wings and dropping
like miniature parachuters before circling back up over their roost
and heading for the nearby Chenango River to feed.
   ``I don't want to go up there,'' Mrs. Whitney says, motioning
toward the attic where the bats hang upside down from the rafters
during the day like clusters of grapes.
   But while many people like the Whitneys are trying to rid their
homes of bats, conservationists are working to save them.
   Bat experts say the winged mammals are vitally important for
insect control, eating up to 50 percent of their body weight during
each nocturnal feeding.
   ``Bats are some of the most misunderstood animals in the
world,'' says Pat Morton, director of the Texas-based Bat
Conservation International. ``They've been shrouded for centuries
in myth and misinformation because they fly at night and are
needlessly feared.''
   Her organization educates people about the importance of bats.
And with the return of Batman to movie screens across the country
this summer, that job was made a little easier. Morton says
requests for information about bats has doubled.
   Even Brett Whitney has been leaning on the Caped Crusader to
help her deal with the thousands of bats in her home.
   ``You have to have a sense of humor about it. I'm buying all
this Batman paraphernalia,'' she says, pointing to the bat sticker
on the window of her black Renault. ``I tell my friends I'm driving
my Batmobile to the Bat House.''
   Bats have been soaring around the planet for 60 million years,
at speeds of up to 40 mph.They're not blind but use sound waves for
navigation and to hunt for food.
   Despite sensational accounts of people being bitten by rabid
bats, such attacks are rare. Less than one-half of 1 percent of
bats contract rabies, and those that do seldom become aggressive,
said Dr. Stephen C. Frantz of the New York State Department of
Health.
   In fact, bats do more for us humans than we think.
   Many flowers, fruits and plants grown in the tropics, including
peaches, grapefruit, avocados and bananas, depend on bats for
pollination.
   The bat's instinctive radar system may lead to development of
devices to help the blind.
   Man has also put bats to use in research for new contraceptives.
A unique hormone allows bats to give birth once a year. The female
is inseminated in the fall, but fertilization is delayed until
spring, after a winter of hibernation.
   Even so, having hundreds of bats living in your attic is enough
to, well, drive you batty.
   ``We've been fighting them for five years,'' says Robert
Harrington, who has 2,000 or so living in the attic of his North
Bay home on the shore of Oneida Lake.
   Harrington has spent almost $1,500 trying to keep the flying
creatures out of his attic. But it hasn't done any good. They can
get through a hole the size of a dime, he says.
   ``I've sprayed ammonia, bought cases and cases of mothballs, and
all it's done is stunk up the house,'' he says.
   His two daughters refuse to sleep in the house. They sleep
outside in the family's truck.
   There are no exact figures on how many houses in the country are
infested with bats. In New York state, Frantz knows of about half a
dozen homes where more than 500 bats have moved in and taken over.

   He says in most cases of major bat infestation, the houses are
old with dark and poorly ventilated attics, something bats love. He
says the homes are also near water, which attracts numerous insects
and makes for a good night's meal.
   Frantz, who works for a research arm of the state health
department that studies rodent diseases, such as rabies, visits
many of these bat-infested houses to get information for his
research.
   Once he's finished gathering data, he shows the residents how to
bat-proof their homes. And he does a little handholding.
   ``A lot of time these people just need someone to talk to and to
tell them things aren't so bad,'' he says. ``They need to know that
their house is not unlivable. They just have to get the bats out.
   ``I guess you could say I'm the living Batman.''
   Brett Whitney and her husband didn't know their house had bats
when they bought it _ as is _ last spring, intending to fix it up
themselves. Now they're living elsewhere.
   Mrs. Whitney says she remembers smelling a powerful odor when
she walked through the house and recalls seeing animal droppings.
But she just assumed the previous owners had pets _ lots of them.
   Frantz says the bats were probably hibernating in nearby caves
when the Whitneys saw the house and returned shortly after the
purchase agreement was signed.
   The Whitneys discovered the bats when Bill peeked into the attic
and saw foot-high mounds of bat guano.
   ``I was shocked,'' he says. ``They were just hanging on the
rafters. It was like being in a cave.''
   He went immediately to the county's environmental officials.
When he mentioned the address, they began nodding their heads.
   ``They told me the house had been infested for years,'' Whitney
says.
   Frantz says that because the colony is so large, it probably
dates back to the early 1920s. Whitney found bat guano beneath the
insulation, which was put into the house in the 1930s.
   Whitney, a self-employed roofer and contractor in the Binghamton
area, plans to renovate the house himself.
   He says the roof will have to be torn off and replaced, and all
the manure- and urine-soaked insulation will have to be shoveled
out of the walls and replaced with new insulation. He says the
ceilings and walls on the second floor will also have to be removed
because they're soaked with bat waste.
   ``It's not an unsolvable problem,'' Whitney says. ``People are
abandoning houses with bats. I looked at the deeds in the county
office and they show that this house has changed hands a lot. I
guess the owners discovered bats and ran.
   ``But there's nothing wrong with the house. It will take a total
renovation, but it's structurally sound.''
   The Whitneys, who have two young children, hope to move in this
month.
   Frantz says the best remedy for ridding an attic of bats is
waiting until they're out for a night of feeding and then seal off
points of entry and exit.
   He says the best time to bat-proof is late fall through winter,
when bats are hibernating in caves. He says bat-proofing should not
be done in late spring and early summer because baby bats can
become trapped inside and repopulate.
   Harrington says he's looking forward to getting some help in his
private war from the Oneida County Community Action Agency Inc. The
organization is preparing a grant application specifically to get
money to help people bat-proof their homes.
   Harrington says he's pretty much bat-proofed the living areas of
his home. He says that before he did he used to get bats in the
house all the time. Now he sees only a couple in the living
quarters.
   But at most of these homes, the outside still belongs to the
bats.
   ``You can get a stiff neck from watching them come out of the
house,'' Brett Whitney says. ``It's like kids with a house facing
McDonalds.''

   There's an international flavor to Mackinac
Island during the tourist season. Jamaican waiters, Austrian cooks
and Mexican maids are imported each year to fill jobs some hotel
operators say Americans don't want. It's all perfectly legal under
the U.S. Labor Department's temporary certification program for
aliens.

<TEXT>
   Here on this resort island in the
Great Lakes, Jamaican waiters and Austrian cooks square off in a
soccer match.
   Jamaican Independence Day is celebrated on Mackinac Island with
a dinner party thrown by the waiters. Islanders still talk about
the time a tureen of goat's head soup from the party wound up the
next day on the serving table of one of the smaller hotels.
   Down on the wharf on a recent weekend, the sugary smell of fudge
mingled with that of horses and cyclists and tourists all
perspiring under an unseasonably hot sun.
   Above it all at the cliffside Grand Hotel, LeRoy Champagnie
smoothly waited tables by the golf course. Not a drop of sweat
beaded his brow nor stained his white coat.
   He doesn't mind the heat. In fact, he's quite happy. ``I like
the work,'' he says in a thick Jamaican accent.
   Champagnie is among 32,000 foreign workers brought to the United
States this year under the U.S. Labor Department's temporary
certification program to take jobs some employers claim Americans
either can't or won't fill.
   These legal aliens cut Florida sugar cane, pick Maryland apples
and, in Michigan, they wait upon the mostly white, rich tourists at
the Grand Hotel on Mackinac Island.
   Federal overseers acknowledge the program is a target for legal
suits from any number of contestants _ including displaced
Americans and advocates for foreign laborers.
   ``Court cases go hand-in-hand with this program,'' said one
administrator, Tom Bruening in Washington, D.C.
   This year, for instance, apple growers in Maryland, Virginia and
West Virginia were ordered to pay more than $2 million in back
wages to 10,000 underpaid Jamaican field hands.
   Yet employers such as the Grand Hotel swear by the program.
   Service at the impeccable Grand was getting, well, sloppy,
before the Jamaicans arrived, says owner Dan Musser.
   Ten years ago, the hotel was hiring American college students
who cared little about what to do with the wine cork. ``I think our
service showed it, dramatically,'' Musser says.
   Even that kind of help was hard to find. Eight people answered
the hotel's advertisement in a Detroit newspaper offering $3.35 an
hour minimum to waiters, waitresses and chambermaids.
   Five of the American applicants were hired. Only two showed up
for work, Musser says.
   ``Every year we try to recruit, but it is very difficult,'' he
says.
   Meanwhile, in Jamaica, the Grand's headwaiter, Kenneth Salmon,
sifted through thousands of applications for the same jobs. The 123
Jamaican waiters, Austrian cooks and Mexican maids the Grand Hotel
hired not only wanted the seasonal jobs, they are professionals who
work the high-class resorts of their home countries the six months
of the year they are not on Mackinac Island.
   American waiters are not that hard to find, says Floyd Borowski,
head of human resources for Mackinac Island's other large resort,
Mission Point. But Mission Point does not recruit in Detroit. The
hotel hires seasoned waiters from resorts in western Florida and
Arizona. ``The supply is there,'' Borowski says.
   After seven years of using foreign labor, the Grand's waiters
now are almost entirely Jamaican.
   Musser refuses to say how much his foreign waiters earn _ ``We
like not to spread that around.'' _ or how much of their wages are
deposited directly in Jamaican banks, a requirement imposed by the
British West Indies Central Labour Organization.
   Federal law requires that foreign laborers earn as much as their
American counterparts. And according to figures from the Michigan
Employment Security Commission, the Grand's waiters earn $3.35 an
hour, above the standard $2.52, but the hotel's no-tipping policy
eliminates the standard gratuity. Instead, the Grand waiters are
paid $2.20 for each $40 dinner they serve.
   Champagnie expects to earn about $8,000 for his six months at
the Grand Hotel, comparable to what he earns during the winter at a
resort in Jamaica, where his wife and children stay. Someday
Champagnie hopes to save enough money to stop waiting tables and
open a real estate company.
   ``I took this for traveling experience, to better myself in
life,'' says waiter George Gaubault, 27, from Montego Bay, Jamaica.
``It's a future here, so I really work hard.''
   The Grand's Jamaicans live as cheaply as they can on an island
built for vacationers.
   Workers can buy their meals at a hotel cafeteria and the Grand
charges its employees about $125 a month to live in dormitories
behind the hotel, Musser says.
   ``Rice, kidney beans and soup meat ...,'' butcher Pat Granning
ticked off the usual shopping list for Jamaicans at Doud's
Mercantile, the only grocery on Mackinac Island. `And chicken. They
buy a lot of chicken.''
   Now the bellboys of summer are going home. The college kids who
put on aprons and waiters' jackets are back in school.
   The Grand's Jamaicans leave this month to return to their native
jobs before the tourist season in the Caribbean gets into full
swing.

   Stephanie Beacham has shed her sexy armor for
her new role as a plain, tart-tongued nun in NBC's ``Sister Kate.''
   ``It's funny not to have all the armaments of looks, sexuality
and sensuality,'' says Beacham, whose last role was Sable, the
alluring vixen on ABC's ``Dynasty.'' ``It's strange to work without
the designer gowns and the makeup people and hairdressers standing
by.''
   ``I feel insecure that people don't flirt with me on the set
anymore.''
   In the new comedy series she's an adventurous nun who
reluctantly takes charge of a group of unruly orphans who have just
driven out her predecessor. It's an uneven match as the kids
quickly learn their new overseer is no pushover. She's tough and
has no tolerance for nonsense.
   ``Sister Kate is not sexually aware,'' Beacham says. ``It's
quite a turn for me after Sable. That's why it was so wonderful for
me to do the pilot while I was still in `Dynasty.' But perhaps
after this I'll be longing to play a harlot.
   ``I'm grateful that people can see that Sable was an acting job
and Sister Kate is an acting job and that I'm both and yet neither
is me.''
   Beacham maintains a home in England, where her two daughters
attend school, but she has spent most of her time here since 1985.
That's when she became the glamorous, scheming Sable in ``The
Colbys,'' a spinoff of ``Dynasty.'' The show folded two years later
and she moved over to ``Dynasty'' to match wits with Alexis Colby
(Joan Collins) until its cancellation at the end of the past season.
   She did the pilot for ``Sister Kate'' last spring on a weekend
away from ``Dynasty.''
   ``That's the reason I couldn't get a haircut and why Kate has a
ponytail,'' she says. ``It's the only effective way I could think
to do my hair. I wear the ponytail now. That's how decisions are
made. We're in the rough-and-tumble of a sitcom. Television is just
a very rushed process.''
   Beacham says if ``Dynasty'' had not been canceled she would have
stayed with that show. She thinks NBC checked with ``Dynasty''
executive producers Aaron Spelling and Esther Shapiro before going
ahead with the pilot.
   ``I really didn't think NBC would pick up `Sister Kate' so I
took off to Bali,'' she says. ``I didn't know we were on the
schedule until I got back to Hawaii. There were a lot of phone
calls to every hotel in Bali, but I was in a mud hut.
   ``Bali is a long way to go to get away from the telephone, but
it was glorious. The Balinese don't watch TV so they had no idea
who I was. It was lovely to be with such friendly people.''
   She took a copy of Shakespeare's ``Antony and Cleopatra'' with
her to Bali in case neither ``Dynasty'' nor ``Sister Kate'' worked
out.
   ``I was slowly working my way toward thinking of playing
Cleopatra,'' she says. ``It's my private goal, it's my thing. It's
a very hard role. I don't know if I would ever dare.''
   Beacham has come up with her own background for Sister Kate,
which she says she must have to get a real grasp on the character.
   ``She has to have had a damaged childhood to lead the solitary
life,'' she says. ``She's seeking peace and quiet and the security
of the church. She's taken her vows of obedience so she goes where
the church sends her. But I think she likes working with the
children.
   ``I was brought up by nuns. I loved them, but I was also
frightened of them. I was nearly 35 before I could slouch over a
table. Sister Philomena stuck a ruler down my back. The tapping of
the black boot fills me with dread even to this day.''

   Behind any good female impersonator, there are a
few good wigs. Not to mention an exotic wardrobe and a good supply
of false eyelashes.
   Ask Charles Busch, star of ``The Lady in Question,'' the comedy
spoof of 1940s movie melodramas in which he plays Gertrude Garnet
(``That's Gar-nay, honey''), a brilliant concert pianist trapped in
the schloss of a sinister German baron during the dark days of
World War II. Before the play is over, Gertrude discovers, among
other things, happiness, humility and a softer hair style.
   Turning Busch into Gertrude Garnet has become an
eight-times-a-week job since the play opened to favorable reviews
last July at off-Broadway's Orpheum Theater.
   He depends on a trio of dedicated co-workers to help create his
female stage persona _ Elizabeth Katherine Carr, who did his wigs,
and Robert Locke and Jennifer Arnold, who designed and are in
charge of his clothes as well as the costumes of other cast members.
   ``I'm a creature of habit,'' Busch was saying the other day.
``My evening starts at 6 o'clock when I go over every line I say in
the play to warm up my voice. I arrive at the theater at 7 and
after chatting with everybody for about 20 minutes, I get to work.''
   The makeup and eyelashes _ $3.25 a pair from Lee's Mardi Gras
Boutique _ go on first.
   ``I've been doing this drag stuff for so long now that I get
that makeup on quick,'' says the lanky, low-key Busch. ``I'm better
than any woman in a fire. Then I guess I put my costume on and then
my wig and then my hat. Then I'm off for business.''
   A white gown, originally made for Busch by Locke two years ago,
was the inspiration for ``The Lady in Question,'' according to
Locke. Busch wanted something similar to a famous lounging gown the
Hollywood designer Adrian created for Katharine Hepburn in ``The
Philadelphia Story.''
   When Busch tried the gown on, he stood in front of a mirror and
exclaimed, ```I see it now: An anti-Nazi play, and I'm a big
Parisian fashion designer.' We laughed about it then,'' Locke
recalls now. The Parisian fashion designer eventually evolved into
a concert pianist, but the gown remained the same.
   ``When you design for Charles you are dealing with the same
things that Adrian and other designers did for Crawford, Hepburn
and Garbo,'' Locke says. ``These were not curvaceous women. They
had shoulders and sort of straightish figures. In fact, Charles
comes pretty close to Garbo's original measurements, except for the
waist.''
   Carr first met Busch in 1983 when she was hired as stage manager
for his one-man show. Out of necessity, she began to look after the
wigs he collected for many of his early shows done at the Limbo
Lounge in the East Village.
   When Busch's first venture, ``Vampire Lesbians of Sodom,'' moved
off-Broadway in 1985 to the Provincetown Playhouse _ where it is
still running _ Carr came along. Since then, she has done all the
wigs, most of them various shades of red, for all of Busch's shows.
   ``Copper is Charles' color,'' insists Carr, a cheerful woman who
says she first became fascinated with hair as a child of the '60s
when beehives and teasing were in. ``He doesn't look good in
blond.''
   Carr, Locke and Busch are big movie fans, particularly of films
of the 1940s, the period of ``The Lady in Question.'' Their work is
a collaboration with all of them making suggestions on what Busch
will wear.
   ``Charles will give you an idea of what he wants without taking
your hand and putting it on the paper,'' says Locke, who made sure
Busch had a different costume for each of the play's six scenes.
   Arnold did most of the men's clothing for ``The Lady in
Question'' and also shopped for fabric, shoes and accessories for
the rest of the costumes.
   ``Then we worked together on construction,'' Arnold says. ``We
built these costumes from a lot of things I found in shops all over
the city.''
   There are certain things that don't change in designing,
particularly for the wigs.
   ``We have to soften Charles' forehead because he is a man,''
Carr says. ``So we always do little wispy bangs. And the hair is
usually no shorter than the base of the neck because we want to
make his neck look more streamlined and feminine.''
   Carr buys the wigs from a shop in back of a liquor store on 19th
Street and then styles the long, flowing hair herself. There are 13
wigs in eight different styles in ``The Lady in Question.'' Most
cost between $20 and $50 and are made out of synthetic fiber from
the Far East. Carr tried using human hair but it didn't hold up as
well, and synthetics were able to look larger than life.
   Busch wears three different wigs in the show. He starts with a
copy of a 1940s roll _ three large, surfer curls in front and
rolled in the back; then a Barbara Stanwyck takeoff, and finally a
loosely flowing hairdo that Busch calls his ``Norma Shearer wig.''
   ``Charles' first two wigs are very stylized whereas the last one
is soft, to go along with the way the character is progressing,''
Carr says. ``Gertrude starts out as very hard-boiled and becomes
more human as the play goes on. In the last act, when she becomes
this giving, loving woman, her hair is very soft.''
   Carr washes the wigs periodically with shampoo and conditioner.
They are dried under a hair dryer and then combed.
   Backstage at the Orpheum, Carr has a little table where she
keeps a hair dryer, shampoo, combs, brushes and assorted mousses
and gels with which she touches up the wigs about three times each
week.
   ``Sometimes wigs can be temperamental,'' she says. ``As they
age, they are harder to deal with and start losing their shine.
Wigs don't last long. Usually after three months, they are ready to
be replaced, and I have to start all over again.''

   Forty years after Mao Tse-tung stood on Tiananmen
Square on Oct. 1, 1949, and declared a New China, the nation is
still searching for the ideal People's Republic and frequently at
war with itself.
   But China has much to celebrate this Oct. 1, its 40th National
Day. Emerging from a long past of foreign domination and internal
decay, it is a strong and independent nation, a world leader.
   The fireworks, flowers and galas marking the anniversary are
deserved recognition for a government that has managed to feed,
clothe and educate a nation whose population has swollen in these
past four decades from 540 million to 1.1 billion, a fifth of the
entire world.
   But the 40th year of New China has been chaotic and few people
are in the mood to celebrate.
   It has been four months since the army crushed the democracy
movement in a spasm of bloodshed, and martial law troops still
stand guard to keep people off Tiananmen Square, focal point of the
uprising primed by students.
   Any thoughts of a military parade such as was held on the 35th
anniversary were set aside. No one wants to see tanks on Tiananmen
Square again.
   Market-oriented reforms that have doubled the size of China's
economy and vastly improved the lives of millions over the past
decade are in serious trouble. The conservatives in power have put
a hold on new reforms until the problems of inflation, corruption
and excessive growth can be solved.
   Zhao Ziyang, the former Communist Party leader who was the main
proponent of reform, was purged because of his liberal leanings.
The grand old man of reform, Deng Xiaoping, 85, appeared recently
in public for the first time in months, looking robust. He had been
reported to be seriously ill.
   The government has acknowledged that after four decades of
indoctrination, it has failed to persuade many of the nation's
young of the virtues of Communist rule. Since the student protests,
time devoted to political education has doubled and tripled in
offices and schools. The official press is again talking of ``class
struggle,'' a notion largely forgotten since the 1966-76 Cultural
Revolution.
   Hou Renzhi, a 78-year-old Beijing University professor who
experienced the pre-1949 past and stood on Tiananmen Square to hear
Mao proclaim the birth of a People's Republic of China 40 years
ago, speaks for many older Chinese when he says: ``I believe in
socialism. That's the hope of China.''
   Yet on the same campus young students shrug off the hours of
political education they are given and whisper that they know the
truth _ that they live under a government willing to train guns on
its own people.
   The many 40-year retrospectives in the media couch their
impressive figures on economic growth with reminders that all this
is due to socialism.
   ``Only socialism can save China and there would be no new China
without the Communist Party,'' the People's Daily intoned in its
series titled ``The Rise of an Oriental Giant.''
   Politburo member Li Ruihuan, in addressing Culture Ministry
officials responsible for planning this National Day, had told them
the events should emphasize that ``public order has been restored
and people are living and working in peace'' after the quelling of
the ``counterrevolutionary rebellion'' on the bloody night of June
3-4 in Beijing.
   He added, ``We should explain with convincing facts that only
socialism can save and develop China.''
   There is much to be said for China's accomplishments since Mao's
Communists defeated Chiang Kai-shek's Nationalists in 1949, driving
them off to Taiwan.
   Life expectancy, around 35 at the time, has nearly doubled to
69. Cholera, malaria, smallpox, plague and other infectious
diseases have been largely brought under control.
   The nation victimized by imperialism and gunboat diplomacy now
sits permanently on the U.N. Security Council, in the place of
Nationalist China. It joined the exclusive nuclear club by
exploding its first atomic bomb in 1964 and has independently
launched 25 satellites since 1970.
   It has normalized relations with both the United States and,
lately, the Soviet Union without leaning too heavily toward either.
Except for the Korean War and some brief border clashes with India,
the Soviet Union and Vietnam, it has rescued the Chinese people
from centuries of civil and international strife.

   The economic strides are impressive. Coal production jumped from
66 million tons in 1952 to 947 million tons last year, rolled steel
from 1 million tons to 47 million tons in the same period. Grain
harvests grew from 113 million tons in 1949 to about 400 million
tons this year. China produced 14,000 bicycles in 1949, 41.2
million in 1988; 1,600 refrigerators in 1957, 7.4 million last year.
   Foreign trade is now $100 billion a year, 100 times more than
four decades ago. Foreign investors have poured $12 billion into
16,000 joint ventures and other projects.
   In 1978, the year Deng started his reforms, 10,000 Chinese had
washing machines. Now 43 million do. In 1983 only four out of every
100 rural households had televisions. Now almost a third do. Rural
incomes, at 545 yuan ($147) per person a year, are triple those of
1978. Urban residents earn 1,119 yuan ($302) a person, up 87.6
percent over 1978 after deducting price rises.
   Daunting problems remain. Illiteracy has been cut from 80
percent of the population to 20 percent, but that still leaves 220
million people who can't read and an underfinanced educational
system that does little to encourage children to stay in school.
   The government says 60 million people, more than the entire
population of France, live below the poverty line of 200 yuan ($54)
in annual income. Some in remote, barren areas depend on government
handouts for survival.
   Forty years after Mao announced the end to exploitation of the
people, more and more people are asking whether the progress
achieved has been worth the pain.
   A million people in the Beijing streets this past spring
demanding democratic reform attested to disillusionment with the
Communist Party, which, like other absolute rulers, is tainted by
corruption, privilege and disdain for the common man.
   After four decades China still lacks a legal system that
protects people from the whims of politicians and police, and the
large majority have little or no control over where they will live
or work.
   The Communist Party's claims to infallibility have long been
discredited by its excesses and miscalculations. There was the
``anti-rightist'' campaign of 1957 that led to the persecution of
tens of thousands of intellectuals; the economic fiasco of Mao's
Leap Forward in 1958, which was followed by crop failures and mass
starvation; and the tragic folly of the leftist Cultural
Revolution, which nearly destroyed a whole generation of educated
Chinese.
   Optimistic Chinese point out that in the past decade under Deng
Xiaoping the periodic political campaigns against ``spiritual
pollution'' and ``bourgeois liberalization'' have been far milder,
with fewer arrests and less persecution than in the past. But since
the June military attack on protesters in Beijing, followed by a
nationwide crackdown on dissent, the mellowing of the masters seems
less certain.
   The party in turn is demanding patience, saying it will put its
divided house in order and guide the nation to prosperous stability
if only people learn to forgo Western political ideas and consumer
habits.
   Jiang Zemin, the new Communist Party chief, set the stage for
National Day 1989 by returning to Yenan, the still-impoverished
town of cave dwellers in northwest China where Mao set up his
revolutionary base in the 1930s and 1940s.
   ``We should carry forward the Yenan spirit of self reliance and
hard struggle,'' Jiang said. ``It will be hard to accomplish the
socialist modernization drive without such a spirit.''

   Tears welling in her eyes, Hou Bo stood in
Tiananmen Square on Oct. 1, 1949, snapping pictures of Mao Tse-tung
proclaiming the new People's Republic of China.
   ``He represented the hopes and feelings of the Chinese people,''
said the only woman photographer on the official rostrum that
bright fall day.
   Hou, now 67, and her photographer husband, Xu Xiaobing, who is
now 73, had been with Mao's Communists since the famous caves of
Yenan in the northwest and took thousands of pictures during the
1938-45 war against Japan and the 1945-49 civil war against Chiang
Kai-shek's Nationalists.
   ``We lived with the Red Army in Yenan,'' she said. ``We fought
against the Japanese. Then we went to Tiananmen together. I was so
moved that my eyes were filled with tears when I took those
pictures.''
   In January 1949, after the Communists marched into Beijing, then
called Peiping, Hou was assigned as a photographer at the Communist
Party headquarters in the city.
   By mid-1949 the Communists had seized Nanjing, the Nationalist
capital, and Shanghai, and were swiftly moving southward. On Oct.
1, with Canton under siege and the Nationalists fleeing to Taiwan,
Mao announced the founding of his new People's Republic.
   Hou said Chou En-lai, who became China's much-admired premier,
arrived first on the Tiananmen rostrum to assure that all the
preparations were in order.
   It was 3 p.m. when Mao pushed a button raising the new national
flag of five yellow stars on red before a crowd of 100,000.
   He told them:
   ``The Chinese people have triumphed over their enemies, changed
the face of their country and founded the People's Republic of
China. ...
   ``The Chinese people, one quarter of humanity, have stood up. .
.. From now on no one will insult us again.''
   Among the dignitaries on the rostrum were Zhu De, commander in
chief of the Red Army; Soong Ching-ling, sister-in-law of Chiang
Kai-shek and later vice-chairman of the Chinese parliament, and Liu
Shaoqi, the president-to-be who would be persecuted to death during
the Cultural Revolution of 1966-76.
   Tiananmen, the gate to the old Forbidden City or Imperial
Palace, was ``very shabby'' in 1949, Hou recalled. There was no
elevator to the rostrum and the leaders scrambled up a steep
stairway.
   Tiananmen Square, then enclosed in a red wall, was about
one-fourth the size of its current 100 acres. Residential houses
crowded the space outside the square now occupied by two massive
archetypes of socialist architecture, the Great Hall of the People
and the history museum.
   Hou said the street running past Tiananmen was far narrower than
it is today, and it took well into the evening before a procession
of 300,000 people could pass by the rostrum and see their new
leaders.
   ``The people did not want to leave,'' her husband, Xu, said.
``They chanted, `Long live Mao Tse-tung! Long live the Communist
Party!' and Chairman Mao shouted back, `Long live the people,' in a
clear, resounding voice.''

   On the surface, life is back to normal in Beijing.
   The tanks are gone. The bodies of the dead have been cremated.
The buses are running again. The markets are bustling. Everyone
goes to work.
   One of the few visual reminders of a popular, seven-week,
student-led movement for democracy and the violence that ended it
June 3-4 in Tiananmen Square are the soldiers at main intersections
and on bridges throughout the capital.
   The government is celebrating the 40th anniversary of the
founding of the People's Republic of China on Oct. 1, 1949.
   But people are frightened.
   ``There's no law anymore, no legal protection,'' a college
student said. ``They can just come and take you away.''
   Many say they fear the soldiers, who the government says are
here to protect the people. Others fear the telephone hotlines and
the boxes in every work unit to report people.
   One man said anyone could put a neighbor's name in the box and
accuse him of throwing stones at soldiers, and the police would
come to arrest him.
   He, like many other people, tells of friends who were hauled
away, beaten and interrogated.
   Beijing residents also worry about the miles of footage taken by
the police and on cameras mounted on main streets during the weeks
of demonstrations. Police now are studying the film, and many
people wonder if their faces will be found.
   One old man, who said he was persecuted during the 1966-76
ultra-leftist Cultural Revolution, was asked by a foreigner how the
police could find one person in Beijing's population of about 10
million.
   He waved his hand impatiently and looked away _ to show what a
silly question he thought it was.
   He did not participate in any protests, never went to Tiananmen
Square, and even told young friends and colleagues not to go.
   Yet, he is fearful.
   In a room he and his friends once considered safe to speak
freely, he now speaks in low, hushed tones. ``We have to be very
careful now.''
   A young intellectual who took a foreign friend to his home
barely spoke until they reached his room. There, with a sigh of
relief, he said: ``It's OK. You can say whatever you want here.
It's safe.''
   But driven by a thunderstorm to the foreigner's hotel room, he
was restrained.
   Later, outside, he said: ``There were many things I was afraid
to say in your hotel room. Who knows? Maybe those smoke detectors
are actually bugs.''
   Beijing University, the site of animated, open discussions about
politics and the government in the spring, is virtually empty of
students now. The start of the fall term was delayed until after
National Day, to prevent disturbances during the 40th anniversary
of the Communist takeover.
   But earlier in the summer, the graduating class was still on
campus undergoing several weeks of political study. In contrast to
their earlier eagerness, many students politely backed away from
talking to strangers about political issues.
   The few who talked did so only in a remote corner of the campus,
away from others.
   Many Chinese have learned it is best not to talk about the
events of May and June.
   ``What's the use?'' said a student.
   ``People's hearts and mouths no longer are connected,'' said the
old man.

<HEAD>Underground Economies Growing in Latin America</HEAD>
<HEAD>An AP Extra</HEAD>
<HEAD>With LaserPhoto</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Underground economies _ typified by
merchants selling goods on street corners _ are growing in South
America, draining billions of dollars in taxes and other revenues
from financially troubled governments.
   But peddling goods, often smuggled, from foldup tables on the
streets is the only way many South Americans can survive rising
taxes, eroding wages and entrenched bureaucracies.
   ``The only way to earn enough to feed your family is to be
self-employed and ignore the government, its red tape and its
taxes,'' said Claudio Tavares on a busy street corner in downtown
Sao Paulo, where he sells cheap disposable lighters and ballpoint
pens, earning five times what he did as an office assistant.
   Even self-employed professionals such as doctors, dentists,
lawyers and psychiatrists are going underground.
   Not far from Claudio Tavares' corner, a dermatologist in an
elegant private clinic tells a patient his bill will be 50 new
cruzados (about $15) if the patient wants a receipt for income tax
records; without the receipt, it's 37 new cruzados ($11).
   The underground network provides millions with jobs or extra
income, but experts say the gross national product of many
countries would grow 50 percent or more if underground economies
were counted.
   The informal economy ``dodges direct taxation but uses public
schools and roads,'' the First National Bank of Boston said in a
recent newsletter distributed in Brazil. ``It avoids massive
paperwork, government inspectors and the burden of dealing with 38
government entities to make a simple business decision.''
   The bank estimated ``an additional 30, 40 or even 50 percent of
extra economic activities are out there bubbling away and
contributing to a much more sizeable gross national product.''
   Economist Nelson Barrizzelli of the University of Sao Paulo sees
government as the reason for the growth of the informal economy.
   ``The government, with its interventionist and highly
centralized economic policies, is a virus that attacks the
country's economic organism,'' he said in an interview. ``The
informal economy represents the antibodies society creates to
protect itself from this virus.''
   Barrizzelli, who recently concluded a study on Brazil's
underground economy, calculated it was about half the size of the
country's official GNP, put at nearly $350 billion.
   The Brazilian government claims underground activity would raise
the GNP by only 13 percent. But Carlos Alberto Ramos of the Labor
Ministry said at least half the country's labor force of 60 million
is involved in the informal economy.
   Other Latin American nations report similar figures.
   In Argentina, the informal economy represents 40 percent to 70
percent beyond the country's official GNP, put at $70 billion to
$90 billion. About half of the nation's work force of 12 million is
believed to participate in the underground economy.
   In Ecuador, about half of the country's 3.3 million workers are
involved in the underground economy, which would add 15 percent to
20 percent to the country's $7.1 billion GNP.
   Peru's $22.5 billion economy would grow 40 percent if the
informal activity were included in official statistics.
   Hernando de Soto, president of Peru's Institute for Liberty and
Democracy, a private economic research foundation, said the
informal economy in his country is a response to the mountains of
red tape that discourage small businessmen from registering their
operations.
   It also is a reaction to the protectionism enjoyed by large
business enterprises, said De Soto, author of ``El Otro Sendero''
(The Other Path), a study on the underground economy that has
become a best seller in nations across the continent.
   Throughout South America, the most visible signs of the
underground economy are the street vendors who sell just about
everything from flashlights, cigarette lighters and clothing to
candies, fruit and popcorn.
   Others collect bottles, rags, loose paper and cardboard to sell
them to recycling companies.
   They are people who could not find jobs in the formal economy or
left low-paying ones.
   Pedro Morresi is one such dropout from the ``official'' economy.
He sells candy smuggled in from Brazil on a street in Montevideo,
Uruguay.
   ``It is hard to find work and when you do, it doesn't pay enough
to live,'' he said. ``I earn more doing this than as an employee.''
   In Quito, the capital of Ecuador, Jose Elias Puente has made a
living for 30 years weighing people on his scale near the
presidential palace. He earns $86 a month, with which he has
educated his nine children.
   Claudio Tavares, 30, joined the underground economy in Sao Paulo
this year after quitting his job as an assistant in the personnel
department of a construction firm, where he earned the equivalent
of about $100 a month.
   ``I wanted to open a store to sell lighters and pens,'' he said.
``But the taxes I would have to pay and the bureaucracy involved to
get a license made me abandon the idea.''
   Today he sells his merchandise, which is smuggled in from
neighboring Paraguay, and takes home around about $500 a month, a
sum few wage earners make in Brazil where the monthly minimum wage
is $75.
   ``Because I don't pay taxes or pay rent, my prices are at least
50 percent less than those charged by stores selling the same
product,'' Tavares said, claiming he makes 100 percent profit on
each item he sells.
   But the biggest slice of the informal economy consists of
self-employed professionals, who declare only a fraction of what
they really earn, economist Barrizzelli said.
   The dermatologist in the Sao Paulo clinic, speaking on the
condition of anonymity, explained his reasons for working off the
books: ``If I declared all I earn, I would fall into a higher tax
bracket, which would make it hard for me to make ends meet in an
economy where prices rise almost daily.''
   Inflation in Brazil was 1,084 percent in the past year, and
growth was practically zero. That combination of recession and
inflation has hit many South American countries and is one of the
prime causes of the growth of the informal economy.
   In Brazil, government figures show that in the first five months
of 1989, industrial output dropped 3.6 percent, while GNP declined
2.4 percent in the first quarter.
   Despite those negative economic indicators, the Bank of Boston's
newsletter said, ``energy consumption rose, employment levels
remained more or less steady and there was relative social
stability.''
   The only explantion for this, the bank said, was the informal
economy.
   Economist Barrizzelli said he is convinced the informal economy
will continue to grow and thrive as long as free market economic
policies are not adopted in the region.
   ``The informal economy represents the only functioning version
of capitalism in Latin America, because it is the only sector where
supply and demand is a determinant factor.''

   A sizzling hot Corvette, a quartet of new
Japanese luxury cars, federally mandated safety devices and an
influx of four-door trucks from overseas top the new car and truck
news for the 1990 model year.
   While consumers are admiring all the new sheet metal and
technological changes for the new vehicles, they may find
themselves hit with a dose of sticker shock. Prices for 1990 cars
are higher, and part of the reason is safety.
   The federal government ruled that cars manufactured after Sept.
1, 1989, must have either supplemental air bags or automatic seat
belts on the driver's side.
   Cars with air bags also must have manually operated lap and
shoulder belts. By the 1994 model year, passive restraints _ either
air bags or automatic belts _ must be standard for the front-seat
passenger, too.
   All Chrysler models built in the U.S., about 15 percent of the
General Motors fleet and just less than half of Ford's will have
standard air bags this year.
   Costs of the systems, which manufacturers often decline to
reveal, could add hundreds of dollars to the price of a 1990 car.
Each of the Big Three has blamed air bags for part of its price
increases.
   In the truck market, importers were shaking in their boots in
January and February, worrying about whether the Treasury
Department would classify their sport-utility vehicles as cars,
with a 2{ percent tariff, or as trucks, with a duty 10 times
stiffer.
   The department ruled, in effect, that four-door vehicles are
primarily for passenger use, making them cars, and two-door
versions are mostly for commercial purposes, making them trucks.
   That ruling had a direct impact on the prices of the imported
trucks, which already had been hurt by a currency exchange rate
that ballooned prices of their vehicles. The number of two-door
sport-utility vehicles from overseas will drop substantially.
   In the United States, Chevrolet is making just 3,000 of its new
Corvette ZR-1 cars, which have engines packing 370 horsepower to
push the sports car from 0 to 60 mph in 4.2 seconds. The consumer
is going to pay the price for all that power, though. The sticker
on the ZR-1 carries a base price of $58,995.
   The much-publicized entry of two Japanese luxury car lines,
Nissan's Infiniti and Toyota's Lexus, has occurred. The cars, two
from each division, first were shown during January on the
auto-show circuit. They will be marketed through dealers separate
than those franchised by their parent companies, as are Honda's
Acura cars now.
   Here's a nameplate-by-nameplate look at major manufacturers'
offerings for the 1990 model year in the United States:
</TEXT>
<NOTE>GENERAL MOTORS CORP.</NOTE>
<TEXT>
   CHEVROLET _ GM's largest division is marketing under the Geo
banner a new line of three cars _ the Metro, Prizm and Storm _ and
a sport-utility vehicle _ the Tracker. None of the cars is made by
GM itself; two are made by joint ventures and two are made in
Japan. Geo vehicles are aimed at potential imported car buyers.
   Chevrolet is the first of three GM divisions to sell the
company's new plastic-body minivan. The Chevrolet Lumina APV, like
the Pontiac Trans Sport and the Oldsmobile Silhouette, has a
radical wedge design.
   Chevrolet began marketing its Lumina sedan in April as a
replacement for the Celebrity sedan. The Lumina coupe will be in
dealerships this fall. The Beretta nameplate gets a new GTZ model
with a Quad 4 engine and a convertible; Corsica, Cavalier and
Camaro models get new engines, while Caprice remains essentially
the same. The Celebrity nameplate stays only on a station wagon.
   More than a dozen new Chevrolet truck models are on tap for
1990, including four-wheel drive and extended versions of the Astro
cargo van and a new ``454 SS'' full-size pickup with a heavy-duty
engine.
   PONTIAC _ The so-called GM performance division is featuring an
all-wheel drive option on the 6000 S-E (which replaces the 6000 STE
of last year), a four-door Grand Prix and a Turbo Grand Prix for
its car line and the Trans Sport version of GM's minivan.
   Upgraded engines are due for the Grand Am, Grand Prix, 6000
series and Firebird models. The sunroof is being dropped from all
Grand Am models.
   Otherwise, a Sunbird LE convertible replaces the GT convertible.
The Bonneville and LeMans undergo minor changes.
   BUICK _ The convertible Reatta two-seater finally debuts in 1990
after several delays. Three new Regal sedans will be introduced in
mid-1990.
   Buick is replacing the LeSabre-Electra wagon designations with
the Estate Wagon name. Otherwise, the Skylark, Century, LeSabre,
Electra, Park Avenue and Park Avenue Ultra remain essentially the
same.
   OLDSMOBILE _ A new Cutlass Supreme sedan, the Silhouette and a
Cutlass convertible are new for 1990. The division also has
restyled the Toronado and Trofeo to make them longer and smoother.
   New engines are available on some cars in the Cutlass line,
including the Quad 442 on the Calais, reviving the 442 name that
Oldsmobile originally introduced in 1964.
   Few changes are on tap for the Ninety-Eight, Eighty-Eight
Royale, Touring Sedan, Cutlass Cruiser Wagon and the Custom Cruiser
Wagon.
   CADILLAC _ GM's flagship line retains six cars for 1990, each of
which has anti-lock brakes as standard or optional equipment.
   The Allante two-seater will be offered as a convertible or as a
soft top with an aluminum hardtop. The Allante will have a traction
control system as standard equipment. More powerful engines will be
available in the De Ville, Fleetwood, Seville and Eldorado models.
   Driver-side air bags will be standard equipment in the Allante,
De Ville, Fleetwood, Seville and Eldorado models.
   GMC TRUCKS _ A new all-wheel-drive GMC Safari van with standard
anti-lock brakes on passenger versions will debut in 1990. Rear
anti-lock brakes will be standard on Rally and Vandura vans,
full-size Jimmy utility vehicles and Suburban wagons.
   Also, extended Rally and Vandura models will be available, and
4.3-liter V-6 engines will be standard on all S-145 Jimmy and
four-wheel-drive S-15 pickups.

   LINCOLN _ A completely redesigned 1990 Town Car is heading to
dealer showrooms with a rounder look outside and a new interior.
Four-wheel anti-lock brakes are optional. There are few changes in
store for the Continental and Mark VII.
   MERCURY _ There will be minor interior and exterior changes to
the Sable and the Grand Marquis sedan and Colony Park station wagon.
   Mercury dealers no longer will market the Merkur XR4Ti, made in
West Germany. They will continue to sell the Merkur Scorpio, which
adds driver- and passenger-side air bags.
   The Cougar, Topaz and Tracer will remain essentially the same.
   FORD _ None of Ford's car lineup will be undergoing major
styling changes for the 1990 model year. The Thunderbird, Taurus,
Tempo, Mustang, Escort and Festiva, which is made in South Korea,
will have minor changes, including new interior trim features and
exterior colors.
   FORD TRUCKS _ Ford is discontinuing the Ranger GT and the STX
4x2 models and offering a 4-liter, V-6 engine on the new small
pickup.
   A four-wheel-drive version of the Aerostar minivan will be
available in November. Rear anti-lock brakes will be standard.
Ford's full-size pickup, the F-Series, will have a new
transmission, as will the full-size Bronco, Econoline and Club
Wagon vans. Automatic locking hubs on four-wheel-drive models of
the Bronco will be standard.
   There will be few changes in the Bronco II for 1990.

<NOTE>CHRYSLER CORP.</NOTE>
<TEXT>
   Each of Chrysler's U.S.-built cars will include driver-side air
bags as standard equipment, requiring a redesign of nearly all
steering wheels.
   Chrysler will offer a new 3.3-liter, V-6 engine for the first
time. It will be available on a wide variety of Dodge, Plymouth and
Chrysler cars and minivans. It will supplement the existing
3.0-liter V-6 engines.
   CHRYSLER _ The Imperial nameplate returns to the Chrysler luxury
line. The company also is introducing a new New Yorker Fifth
Avenue, shorter and narrower than the 1989 Fifth Avenue. A new
mid-size Salon and LeBaron Sedan are on tap as is the Town &amp;
Country minivan, an upscale version of the company's tried-and-true
Plymouth Voyager and Dodge Caravan minivans.
   Otherwise, Chrysler is lengthening its New Yorker Landau and
making minor changes on its other cars.
   PLYMOUTH _ Production of the Laser, introduced earlier this year
as a 1990 model, continues at the Diamond-Star Motors Corp. plant,
a joint venture with Mitsubishi Motors Corp., in Normal, Ill.
   A new transmission and seven-passenger seating becomes standard
on the Voyager LE minivan, and three new colors will be available
on the Sundance.
   Essentially the same for l990 are the Sundance, the Acclaim, and
the Horizon and Dodge Omni subcompacts, which are being phased out
as the company prepares to replace the Jefferson Avenue assembly
plant in Detroit.
   Chrysler's line of Colts, imports from a Mitsubishi factory in
Japan, will remain about the same with some minor exterior changes
on the DL wagon and Vista.
   DODGE _ The Caravan minivan will have seven-passenger seating
standard on the LE model. The Dynasty, Daytona and Shadow will
remain essentially the same.
   JEEP _ Chassis refinements are on tap for 1990 Wrangler,
Cherokee, Wagoneer and Comanche models. There are other small
changes in all the 1990 Jeeps, including new colors.
   EAGLE _ Chrysler introduces the Talon with the 1990 model year,
which is essentially the same car as the Plymouth Laser and
Mitsubishi Eclipse built at the Diamond-Star plant.
   Chrysler is moving the shifter on the automatic transmission
version of the Premier from the steering column to the floor and is
adding a sedan to the Summit cars built in Japan.
   DODGE TRUCKS _ A convertible Dakota is available, as are longer
cabs on Dakota and Ram pickups. The Ram 100 is being replaced by
the 150S with an upgraded trim level.
   There are few changes in store for the Ram Van, Ram Wagon, Ram
50 and Ramcharger. Anti-lock braking systems are available on the
Ram Wagon and the Ramcharger.

marketed.
   Some production of the 626 models will be shifted to Flat Rock,
Mich. The 626 Turbo will be renamed the 626 GT. The 626, the MX-6
and RX-7 cars will show few changes.
   On the luxury car end, Mazda's new 929 S will have a 24-valve,
V-6 engine and anti-lock brakes. The standard 929 will have an
18-valve V-6.
   Mazda's minivan, the MPV, will remain essentially the same
except for the addition of anti-lock brakes on the rear wheels.

introduced earlier this year as 1990 models.
   Two engine changes are in store for Nissan's light trucks with
introductions of a 2.4-liter fuel-injected model and a new fuel
injection system on the V-6 powerplant. A four-door Pathfinder will
be in showrooms to beat the federal imported truck tariff.
   INFINITI _ The Infiniti nameplate is Nissan's entry into the
luxury performance market. Prices of the Q45 sedan and the M30
coupe and convertible will range from $24,500 to $38,000. Each

the same, though Toyota plans to introduce a new MR-2 two-seater
early next year.
   A 1990 four-door 4Runner sport-utility vehicle is being imported
to the U.S., with optional anti-lock brakes. The two-door version
will continue to be imported. Toyota's two- and four-wheel-drive
trucks have a few changes, including optional anti-lock brake
systems.
   LEXUS _ The ES 250 and the LS 400, Toyota's new entries in the
U.S. luxury car market, went on sale Sept. 1 at base prices of
$21,050 and $35,000. Like the Infiniti models from competitor
Nissan, Lexus cars are loaded with standard features and offer few
options. The cars will be marketed through Lexus dealerships.

   AUDI _ The division of Volkswagen AG of West Germany earlier
this year introduced the V-8 Quattro, featuring a new 3.6-liter,
240-horsepower engine with a top speed of 146 mph. The company also
showed off a 1990 version of its Audi Coupe Quattro with a high
level of standard features.
   The 1990 90 Quattro will have a 20-valve engine standard,
turning out more horsepower than the 10-valve engine on the 1989 90
Quattro, and Audi's 80 Quattro remains essentially the same with a
10-valve engine.
   BMW _ The West German automaker is dropping its 6-series coupes,
to be replaced by a more expensive 8-series in mid-1990. Otherwise,
BMWs will remain essentially the same for 1990, with driver-side
air bags added to each model.
   JAGUAR _ The British maker of luxury performance cars is
introducing to the U.S. market its Sovereign, which already has
been sold elsewhere in the world. It also will offer a new XJ-6 and
carry over the Vanden Plas and the Vanden Plas Majestic.
   MERCEDES-BENZ _ The luxury carmaker from West Germany is
offering a pair of new two-seaters to its 1990 line _ the 300SL and
the 500SL _ replacing the 560SL. The 300SL is powered by a V-6
while the 500SL has a V-8 under the hood.
   Mercedes is dropping its 190D diesel sedan and is adding
turbocharged diesel models in its 260E and 300SEL sedans for 1990.
The 300CE coupe gets a new engine. There will be a variety of
appearance changes in other Mercedes models.
   PORSCHE _ The big news from the West German automaker is that
their 1990 prices will stay the same as they were in 1989, ranging
from $41,900 for the 944 S2 Coupe to $74,545 for the 928. Porsche
is adding anti-lock brakes and driver- and passenger-side air bags
on all models. There also will be some engine changes in all series
and a tire-pressure monitoring system on the top-of-the-line 928s.
   PEUGEOT _ The French automaker is importing two models of its
front-wheel-drive 405 Sportswagon for the 1990 model year. Both
have as standard features air conditioning with automatic climate
control, an AM-FM cassette stereo system and an adjustable steering
column. The company will continue importing two versions of the 405
sedan, which will have few changes.
   The 505 station wagon, larger than the 405 Sportswagon, will
have few changes for 1990. Mi 16 sedan will have anti-lock brakes
as standard equipment.
   RANGE ROVER _ The British maker of luxury four-wheel-drive
vehicles, which was very concerned about the Treasury Department's
customs ruling earlier this year, said no information on its 1990
model line would be available until mid-October.
   SAAB _ The Swedish automaker is adding driver-side air bags to
all of its cars for 1990. Otherwise, it is making only minor
changes in its new models, which are to be introduced in early
November.
   STERLING _ Four models _ the 827S, 827Si, 827SL and 827SLi _
will be offered in l990 by the British luxury car maker and each
will have automatic climate control and power seats.
   Suspension changes are in store for the Si and SLi. The other
models will remain essentially the same.
   VOLKSWAGEN _ The West German company is offering a new
top-of-the-line Passat GL as a sedan and wagon. It has a 2-liter,
16-valve engine with 131 horsepower and a high level of standard
equipment. The car was available in Europe last year.
   Volkswagen also is importing its first supercharged sports car
to the United States, the Corrado. It packs a four-cylinder,
1.8-liter engine with 158 horsepower.
   The company will offer an eight-valve engine on the GTI to join
the 16-valve version sold in 1989. A new GTI, to be called the
Rallye, will be introduced as a 1990 model within the first quarter
of next year.
   Volkswagen will return the three models of the Jetta with new
options. There will be minor trim changes on the three Cabriolet
models. All models of the Golf and Fox will remain essentially the
same, as will the Vanagon models.
   VOLVO _ The 1990 Volvos will be in showrooms in early November,
and shoppers will see a change to the front-end design in the 740
line. Also, the 240GL nameplate will be eliminated and a new 740
will join the lineup.
   Volvo's turbocharged engine will be changed to add horsepower
and acceleration capability.
   The rest of the car line from the Swedish manufacturer will
remain essentially the same.
   YUGO _ The Yugoslav automaker, whose U.S. marketing arm is in
bankruptcy court in New Jersey, will be consolidating its three
U.S. models _ the GV, GVL and GVX _ into one model for 1990, the
GVPlus. It will have a 1.3-liter, fuel-injected engine and will be
priced under $5,000. A convertible, with a price of less than
$9,000, also will be available.

   Ethanol added to gasoline will reduce carbon monoxide air
pollution in cities by as much as 25 percent, says the president of
a consulting firm specializing in fuel blend quality control.
   Robert Reynolds, who heads Downstream Alternatives, Inc., an
Indiana firm, says that a 10 percent ethanol-gasoline blend burns
more thoroughly, thereby decreasing auto emissions.
   ``In addition, it enhances the gasoline's octane level, which
lessens the occurrence of `engine ping,' or the knocking sound that
results from using unleaded fuels which contain a lower octane
value,'' says Reynolds. ``A regular unleaded gasoline has an octane
value of 87 compared to a 10 percent ethanol blend with a value of
89.5 or 90.''
   Reynolds notes that auto companies are experimenting with other
alcohol fuels but ethanol is the only alterntive which blends
easily with gasoline and needs no modification of cars. Ethanol is
derived fom agricultual crops containing sugar or starch.
   ``In the late 1970s, alternative fuel programs were driven by
fears of being dependent on foreign crude oil. Today both the
automotive industry and consumer must look toward fuel alternatives
as a means for self-preservation,'' Reynolds says.

   The little antennas with the funny corkscrew
parts are more and more noticeable on U.S. highways these days, as
manufacturers add cellular phones as options to new cars.
   Business people who can't afford to be out of touch have found
that beepers and pagers have limited ranges, and to answer one, a
driver has to stop and hunt for a public telephone.
   That can be tough while driving on an interstate highway
somewhere in the middle of South Dakota.
   There are at least two dozen companies making cellular phones
for cars and trucks. Some of the devices are powered by batteries
and can be carried around. Others must be left in the car.
   A mobile phone can be used while being held, like one at home,
or in its rack, usually mounted on the center console or
transmission hump.
   Placing a call is pretty much the same as using a phone at home.
The signal goes through a ``cell'' and then is relayed by microwave
to its destination, whether it's another mobile phone or a
stationary one.
   Making the call is getting easier.
   GTE Mobilenet Inc. is marketing a voice-activated phone that
recognizes two different voices and can dial and cut off telephone
calls without anyone touching the handset. It also can be used like
a conventional mobile phone.
   A tiny microphone, mounted on the post between the windshield
and driver's window, picks up preset commands and places calls.
   ``A lot of cars in Fortune (500) companies have cellular phones,
and company policy says you have to use them on the hook,'' says
Sam McDaniel, marketing manager for GET Mobilnet.
   Some telephone numbers can be programmed in so the phone will
dial it on a one-word command, like ``office.'' Safeguards are
built in to prevent the phone from dialing the number if the word
comes up in casual conversation.
   ``If you have your wife with you and have a girlfriend named
`Jane' and you say `Jane,' you could be in trouble,'' McDaniel said.

   In the old days, the AM radio in the big
nine-seat station wagon would fade in and out nearly as often as
the odometer clicked over another dozen or so miles.
   No more. Radio stations are different these days. So are cars
and their audio systems.
   A car equipped only with an AM radio is a rarity now. Some cars
come with AM-FM radios, cassette tape players or compact disc
players as standard equipment. And there's everything in between.
   As Americans take more and more to the highways, so do their
audio tastes. Inside any car on the road, someone's probably
listening to some jazz, oldies, easy listening, gospel or
head-banging rock 'n' roll music. They also may be learning a
foreign language or how to be more forceful in business.
   There's a good chance some of that is coming from a tape or disc
player.
   Manufacturers whose brand names have been in living room systems
for years are showing up more and more in cars an trucks. Sony,
Bose, Aiwa and Pioneer are only a few.
   Many vehicles are coming with a radio, cassette player and four
speakers as standard equipment. Others come with options boosting
power, measured in wattage.
   All that can make the systems attractive to thieves.
   To deter them, manufacturers make systems that can be removed
from the passenger cabin and stowed in the trunk or others that
blend into the dash board.
   Other ways to keep the car's stereo system where it should be
include alarm systems with window stickers warning passers-by or a
registration system with an identification number on each radio,
tape or disc player.
   Then there are some folks who have special love affairs with
their custom designed systems, like Peter Hoffsaess of Los Angeles,
who owns a Plymouth Sapparo.
   When he cranks his car up and turns up the radio, ``it's kind of
difficult to breathe and swallow,'' he says.
   Hoffsaess has equipped his car with a system that can put out
143 decibels through two dozen speakers. Accelerating jet planes
are quieter.
   Hoffsaess gets defensive when somebody challenges the wisdom of
putting all that sound in a car.
   ``Who's anybody to tell me what's too loud?'' he says. ``I mean,
what might be too loud for one person might not be loud enough for
another person.''
   The cost of volume doesn't come cheap. Hoffsaess shelled out a
cool $12,000 just for the stereo. That's about the cost of two
well-equipped Yugos, each with an electronic digital AM-FM cassette
sound systems.

   Read any good tires lately?
   OK, so the sides of tires aren't the most compelling reading.
They still provide a lot of information that can help consumers be
sure they have the right tires on their cars or trucks.
   All the words, letters and numbers on the sides of tires can be
as easy to follow as the family tree in ``Wuthering Heights'' for a
typical consumer.
   Each tire carries the manufacturer's name and registered name of
the model of tire. Usually that's in big letters, sometimes in
raised white letters. That's easy to understand.
   A little more difficult, perhaps, but also in large print, is
the size designation. This can start with a ``P'' for passenger
tires or ``LT'' for light truck. Then there are three numbers _ the
tire's width in millimeters.
   After a slash, there are two other numbers, representing the
height of the tire from the tread surface to the rim, measured as a
percentage of the tire's width _ for example, 75. The letter ``R''
for radial, ``B'' for bias belted or ``D'' for bias only tires
follows to indicate the design of the tire. After that is a
two-digit number showing the size of the wheel it fits, measured in
inches.
   Continuing along that line are designations of whether the tire
meets the Tire and Rim Association's snow and mud specifications,
noted by the letters, appropriately, ``M&amp;S.''
   The last bits of information closest to the tread are ratings
for tread wear, traction and temperature.
   Tread wear is rated by a three-digit number, with 100 as a base.
For example, a tire with a ``340'' rating will last 3.4 times
longer than a tire with a 100 rating under the same driving
conditions.
   Traction is rated on an A-B-C scale with A being the best
traction at 40 mph on a wet surface. Temperature ratings also are
on an A-B-C scale with A being the most-resistant to the effects of
temperature at 85 mph.
   Now the fine print comes in. Nearly all of the rest of the
information is printed on the tire nearest the wheel rim.
   The longest section involves tire safety warnings about
inflation, and what can happen if a tire is underinflated or
overinflated.
   There are descriptions of what the tire is made of, its design,
the number of plies in the tread and sidewall, whether the tire
needs a tube or not and the loads the tire can handle.
   Also on the side of tire is the recommended pressure when the
tire is cold. That information often is carried in booklets that
come with the car.
   Much of that information is required by law.
   Other information not required in the U.S. but included are
markings for Common Market countries. The code includes references
to load capacity, speed, the country giving approval and the tire
size and type, all in letters and numbers.
   All the numbers may not be easy reading, but following the
manufacturer's recommendations in inflation and care can prolong
the life of a tire.

   Would you buy a used car from a saleswoman?
   Helene Lawson found the question intriguing enough to choose it
as a topic to complete her doctorate in sociology at Loyola
University in Chicago.
   ``I found myself wondering how a woman got into auto sales,
something I perceived as an all-male domain,'' she said, after a
female salesperson sold her a 1968 Mazda, a car the sociologist
really hadn't intended to buy.
   Her research showed that women car sellers ranged from 23 to 52
years of age; one-third were single parents, primarily divorcees;
and more than one-third of the sample had school age children.
   ``A third of the women are married,'' she reported. ``They cited
the support of their husbands in sharing the responsibility of
caring for the children.''
   Their previous occupational backgrounds varied, ``from so-called
pink collar backgrounds, such traditional female jobs as
beauticians, secretaries and housewives,'' to teachers and social
workers, or artists and photographers.
   Many of the women she studied played out feminine stereotypes to
sell cars, said Lawson.
   ``They take on roles men expect of them _ the matronly
grandmother or mother _ or they act silly or `dizzy,''' she said.
``These are the roles that men accept and feel comfortable with.''
   She found that ``some older men simply will not buy a car from a
woman. They feel intimidated and uncomfortable divulging personal
financial information to a female. They'll try to stump the female
salesperson, asking her tough technical questions about the cars
displayed on the showroom floor, queries they wouldn't pose to a
man.''
   On the other hand, women love to find women on the sales floor,
Lawson said.

   Some windshields can melt an icy coating, cut the
sun's glare or resist shattering when rocks hit them at 50 mph.
   But there's one thing common to all windshields, and it can
interfere with driving: dirt.
   But cleaning windshields may cause long-term problems if it
isn't done properly, says a Fairleigh Dickinson University
professor.
   Oswald Haase, who teaches physics at the Rutherford, N.J.,
school, has studied windshield wear and how light is diffused by
the grooves and pits left behind by dirt or flying pebbles.
   Windshield washers and wiper blades may take away some dirt, but
the abrasion may leave behind scratches that can cause problems
down the road.
   ``They help you see in the short run, but louse it up in the
long run,'' Haase says.
   The research, done during the last four years in Sweden and
Cologne, West Germany, showed scratches and pits caused significant
vision problems in less than 2 percent of the windshields tested,
while dirt accounted for serious problems in about 25 percent.
   He says it isn't clear yet if recent automobile design trends
making windshields less vertical will help move dirt and small
objects over the car or if longer wiper blades needed by larger
windshields will hurt.
   ``The fact that the windshield is fitted is good. You have to
get a better windshield washer,'' he says.
   The Volkswagen Beetle was the best, he said, because of its
small windshield and short wiper blades. While offering no
specifics, Haase says washers that spray a wide stream of fluid or
those integrated into wiper arms would help.

   It's time to get your car ready for winter, and
that includes what you carry in your car or truck.
   In addition to what's under the hood, drivers need to think
about gear to cope with a stalled or stuck car in bad weather.
   Here are some tips for coping with a blizzard, before and after
leaving the garage:
   _ Keep at least a quarter if a tank of fuel in the car,
refilling it frequently. Besides providing fuel to keep the car's
heater in operation while waiting for help, more fuel in the tank
reduces chances for condensed moisture to get into the fuel system,
making starting tough and running rough.
   _ Let some fresh air into the car if you are stuck. Even though
lowering a window a bit lets in a blast of frigid air, it helps
remove deadly carbon monoxide and other gases from the car's
interior. Those gases can build up if a heater is operated while
the car is stuck and windows are rolled up tightly.
   _ Stay in your vehicle. It protects you from the weather and is
easier for others to find.
   _ Stay awake. Do not allow all the people in the vehicle to
sleep at the same time.
   _ Turn on the car's dome light at night. It helps makes your
vehicle visible in darkness.
   _ Keep a well-stocked first-aid kit, a flashlight with new
batteries, a windshield scraper and brush, jumper cables and
blankets or a sleeping bag in your vehicle.
   _ Take special things for trips in remote areas where especially
severe weather is possible. That can include a shovel, paper
towels, a sack of sand, a fire extinguisher and tow chains.
   _ Be sure you know how to operate jumper cables. Here's how:
   Move one vehicle close enough to the other, without touching, so
the cables can reach between batteries without being taut. Turn off
both engines.
   Connect one end of the red jumper cable to the positive terminal
on one battery and then the other end to the positive terminal on
the other battery. Clamp one end of the black cable to the negative
terminal on the good battery. Connect the other end of the black
cable to the engine block of the vehicle with the bad battery,
being sure it's away from the fan.
   Start the vehicle with the good battery, then the vehicle with
the bad one.
   Disconnect the cables in reverse order of connection.

   The temperature's beginning to drop, and in some
places, leaves are about to begin their change to autumn hues.
   That means it's time to take a few moments and spend a little
money now to avoid long hours of inconvenience and a big repair
bill later in the winter when driving's less fun than it has been
for the past several months.
   Here are some tips for getting your car into shape before the
first leaves fall:
   _Have the cooling system flushed if it hasn't been in the last
two years. Cleaning the system and replacing antifreeze in the fall
helps the car run smoothly in the winter. If the cooling system has
been flushed in the last two years, have the potency of the
antifreeze checked.
   _Inspect the battery terminals and clean them if necessary. Be
sure the battery has a good charge.
   _Be sure your vehicle is properly tuned. A well-tuned engine
starts easier in lousy weather and runs better than a poorly tuned
engine.
   _Check windshield wiper blades and switch to heavy-duty ones if
driving in snow and ice is anticipated.
   _Get an oil change. It only takes a few minutes, and many
businesses will check levels of other fluids in the vehicle at the
same time.
   _During winter, frequently check the level of windshield washer
fluid.
   _Before cold weather sets in, check the heater's operation. It
may get a little warm for a moment or two now, but that's better
than starting a long trip in freezing temperatures and finding
there's going to be no heat for you and your passengers.
   _Inspect tires for tread depth and uneven wear. Frequently check
inflation pressure.
   _Check the brakes, and remember that cold weather, snow and ice
increase stopping distances.

   For the comfort of the behind of the one behind the wheel, a
Swedish automaker has some advice on adjusting the seat to fit
yours.
   Saab-Scania offers these tips for ``sitting pretty'' while on
the road:
   _ Move the seat up or down until the top of your hip line is
just below the lowest part of the steering wheel.
   _ Adjust the seat forward or backward until the clutch or brake
can be fully depressed without lifting your left buttock off the
seat cushion.
   _ Sit completely back and adjust the angle of the seat-back
until the whole length of your back is pressing against the back
rest. (Sitting too upright puts too much stress on the lower back
and upper thighs; leaning too far back puts stress on the neck and
shoulders.)
   _ Adjust the lumbar support until there is a gentle awareness of
a supporting pressure in the lumbar area.
   _ Adjust the steering wheel until your arms are slightly bent,
with hands at the ``10 and 2 o'clock'' position.
   The advice comes from Terry Moule, an osteopathic consultant and
sports injury specialist.
   ``Despite the amount of time Americans spend in their cars, they
have not been taught how to use seats correctly and therefore don't
spend the necessary few minutes to achieve the correct driving
position,'' says Moule.
   ``It's easier to blame your aching back on your car seat design,
rather than take the time to learn all the benefits of
well-designed car seating, and adjust the seat until it fits you
properly.''

   Be warned. Coming from Japan are 6-inch model cars that move at
the equivalent in scale to 320 mph, probably through your living
room.
   Problem is, these ``hyper cars'' move so fast that your kids may
have trouble playing with them.
   ``It's a real problem,'' conceded Kenneth A. Bloom, vice
president for finance at Matchbox International Ltd., one of the
marketers. ``You put it down on the rug and let it go, and it's
just going to shoot off and keep going until it hits something or
flips over.''
   Toymakers hope to solve the problem by selling plastic track
that kids can put together in their bedrooms, garages or backyards.
In Japan, arcades have installed elaborate tracks that junior
racers pay to use.
   The $5 to $12 cars, powered by two or three AA batteries, move
at actual speeds of about 10 miles per hour. But in comparison with
their scale, which is 1-32 of a full-sized car, they easily outrun
Formula I racers.
   The toys are just now hitting the retail stores, being marketed
by Matchbox, Hasbro Inc., Mattel Inc. and Tonka Corp.
   The cars come in numerous designs, including some with
interchangeable motors and gear boxes. Although they are being
marketed under various names, such as Hyper-Drivers and Record
Breakers, most versions are made in Japan and are nearly identical
in construction. --_
   Carhenge, a circle of junked, half-buried cars that mimics
England's prehistoric Stonehenge, is bidding for a long-term
permit, if not immortality, in Alliance, Neb.
   In an effort to salvage the tourist attraction, the Alliance
City Council has voted to pursue a change in zoning laws allowing
Carhenge to remain intact.
   Critics argue it should be torn down because it is unsightly.
But council members decided to review the special-use permit
granted to its creator, James Reinders of Houston, after he bought
the land. Reinders, a former Alliance resident, contends that the
monument is a work of art.
   Before the council's vote, about a dozen citizens appeared at a
public hearing to voice their support for Carhenge.
   Janet Steele, executive director of the Alliance Area Chamber of
Commerce, told the council that Carhenge helps attract visitors to
the community in northwestern Nebraska. And a supportive letter was
submitted to the panel from state tourism director Peggy Briggs.

   BEIJING (AP) _ Five years after production of China's Red Flag
limousine was suspended, a factory is turning out 10 of the luxury
cars in time for the 40th anniversary of Communist rule, according
to an official report.
   The Red Flag, or Hongqi, limousine, first produced in 1958, for
years was used only by high-ranking officials. The government
ordered production halted in 1983, saying the car used too much
fuel.
   Last year, the state said production would resume, without
mentioning the fuel-consumption problem.
   Most of China's leaders have stopped using the Red Flag, which
some say was slow to start, ran too slowly and was too big for
narrow driveways.
   Imported cars often are seen taking VIPs around town. The China
Daily said the Red Flags were given to lower level officials or
sold to private businessmen.
   The government recently forbade state and party leaders from
using imported cars as part of cost-cutting measures, and the No. 1
Automotive Works in northeastern Jilin province planned to turn out
10 of the Red Flags by National Day on Oct. 1.

   Driving with the gas gauge on empty isn't a good idea, and not
just because you may find yourself stranded.
   When too little gasoline is in the tank, condensation can form,
literally watering down the gas that's there. That can cause
starting problems, hesitation on acceleration and poor overall
performance. --_
   Keeping a maintenance record for your car can pay off.
   In addition to being a handy reference if you want to complain
to a service department about a job you think was poorly performed,
the log can be a selling tool, too.
   If you can show a potential buyer that you have taken care of
your car, there may be less concern by the purchaser of getting
stuck with unseen problems. --_
   Here are some things which may indicate a problem with your
brakes, according to Allied Aftermarket Division, which markets
Fram, Bendix and Autolite products:
   _ A spongy feeling in the pedal. This may indicate that air has
gotten into the brake fluid, making it less efficient.
   _ The pedal throbs when pressed. Throbbing can be caused by a
problem with brake drums or rotors. Drums press against rotors to
slow the car, and when the contact surfaces are uneven, throbbing
occurs.
   _ Brake fade. The driver notices that it takes longer to slow
from one speed to another when using the brakes. It often occurs
when there is frequent braking during rush hour traffic situations.
Heat is the most common reason for fading. --_
   Tough drunken driving laws are turning into good news for
limousine operators, according to the Motor Vehicle Manufacturers
Association.
   The MVMA says about half of the revenues collected by limousine
operators come from business uses, but lots of folks are leaving
the driving at party time to someone else.
   It can be cheaper and safer for a group of friends to rent a
limousine for the night, forget about parking charges and stay away
from steering wheels after having a few too many, the organization
says. --_
   What a difference a hemisphere makes.
   There are five vehicle dealerships in Moscow, Idaho, selling
Subaru, Jeep, Toyota, Chevrolet, Volkswagen, Ford, Mercury, Buick,
Pontiac, Cadillac, Nissan and GMC Trucks.
   In Moscow, Soviet Union, there are just three. But they have
hundreds of service bays apiece. --_
   Households with more than one car in the driveway or garage
aren't as rare as some may think.
   The Motor Vehicle Manufacturers Association says about 30
percent of all households in the United States have two vehicles
and about 9 percent have three or more. --_
   Motorists who run red lights in New York City may find
themselves on something like ``Candid Camera.''
   The city's police have set up automated cameras at busy
intersections in the Big Apple to photograph the license plates of
motorists who go when they should stop.
   Offenders could be fined up to $50, but no points will be
charged against their licenses. --_
   The rebates that car buyers see advertised these days aren't
anything new.
   The original Henry Ford offered rebates of $40 to $60 to each
purchaser of a Model T. But there was a catch.
   Those rebates would be available only if Ford sold more than
300,000 of the cars between August, 1914, and August, 1915. These
days, manufacturers impose no such restrictions. --_
   You can play with your toy cars at any age if you look at the
models as objets d'art.
   And a New York gallery, l'Art et l'Automobile, has a collection
to fit your artistic tastes, such as a $25,000 made-to-order
Bugatti Royale Coupe Napoleon. The gallery also stocks posters,
books, sculptures, paintings, badges and other automobilia with
more modest pricetags.
   Gallery owner Jacques Vaucher raced Formula III cars in the
United States and his native France before opening the gallery
eight years ago.

   Driver abuse is the most common reason for premature wear and
breakdowns on automobiles, according to an industry newsletter.
   The newsletter, Runzheimer Reports on Fleet Management, surveyed
117 automotive fleet managers and 62 percent of them blamed
breakdowns on the drivers themselves. Twenty percent blamed
manufacturing defects for breakdowns.
   When asked which is the most common car component to fail, 36
percent said it was the brakes, followed by body integrity (13
percent) and the engine (13 percent).

<TEXT>
   The economy will continue to grow through
1990, forestalling until at least 1991 a recession that many once
forecast for next year, top business economists said today.
   Nearly two-thirds of the 72 forecasting experts surveyed by the
National Association of Business Economists said they think a
recession is not likely before 1991. A third of them said a
recession will not arrive until 1992 or later.
   ``If the expansion does continue until that time,'' the
association said, ``it will set a record for the longest expansion
(in either war or peacetime) in the history of the United States.''
   The nation's economy currently is enjoying record peacetime
growth which will be seven years old in December. The longest
expansion ever occurred in the February 1961-December 1969 period
that included the Vietnam war.
   The survey was being presented at NABE's annual meeting in San
Francisco. A copy was made available here.
   In its previous quarterly survey last May, NABE found that 63
percent of the respondents expected the next recession next year.
Now, only 37 percent foresee a serious downturn by 1990.
   In today's survey, 32 percent said the next recession would not
begin until 1991, another 14 percent said 1992 and 17 percent said
1993 or later. Twelve percent said a recession would arrive before
year's end and 25 percent expected it next year.
   ``At the time of this writing, the Fed seems to have engineered
the much-awaited `soft-landing,''' the report said, referring to
the continued but slower economic growth sought by the Federal
Reserve as it seeks to control inflation.
   ``Economic growth has dropped to below 3 percent, inflation is
dropping and interest rates are easing,'' it continued. ``A
majority of NABE panel members expect this soft landing to continue
through 1990, with real growth at a level fast enough to keep the
unemployment rate below 6 percent, but slow enough to keep
inflation in the 4-4{ percent range.''
   However, the survey responses did imply a slowdown in economic
growth in the last half of this year.
   The forecasters' median growth rate for the gross national
product, the nation's broadest measure of economic health, during
the final three months of 1989 is 2.1 percent. That compares with a
3.1 percent growth in the first half of the year.
   The survey found a substantial majority expect growth to
continue at about the same 2.1 percent rate throughout 1990.
   At the same time, the economists scaled back their inflation
forecast to 5 percent for the October-December quarter, down from
5.3 percent in the May survey. The median forecast for inflation in
1990 is 4.3 percent.
   Progress on the nation's twin trade and budget deficits,
meanwhile, was expected to continue.
   The economists' median forecast for the trade deficit was $110
billion this year and $100 billion in 1990, compared with $122.8
billion in 1988.
   The survey found the survey panel expects a $150 billion budget
deficit this year and $135 billion in 1990, compared with $155.1
billion last year. The forecast is far from the $100 billion
Gramm-Rudman deficit reduction ceiling mandated for fiscal 1990.
   Other forecasts in the survey included:
   _Industrial production is expected to grow at 3.1 percent this
year, slowing to 1.7 percent in 1990.
   _Construction of new homes and apartments is forecast to average
1.42 million units this year and 1.45 million units in 1990.
   _Car and truck sales are expected to total 15 million this year
and before falling to 14.7 million in 1990.

<HEAD>Dallas-Based Financial Firm Files For Protection From Creditors</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DALLAS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Lomas Financial Corp. says it was forced to seek
federal bankruptcy protection after failing to work out an
agreement with creditors.
   Chairman Jess Hay said it became apparent last week that the
company was ``at least two or three weeks away'' from an agreement
with holders of its senior debt.
   ``That may not sound like much time, but they are critical days
in our efforts to restructure our business,'' Hay said. ``We
decided the bankruptcy court provided a better forum for proceeding
with our fundamental restructuring.''
   Lomas Financial filed for protection under Chapter 11 of the
federal bankruptcy laws on Sunday in New York, where most of its
creditors are based. The petition involves only the parent company
and some land developing subsidiaries of Lomas, which has more than
$6 billion in assets and operations in mortgage banking and real
estate finance.
   The action freezes payments on a total of $2.1 billion in debt.
   Hurt by real estate problems and a slow-down in mortgage
lending, Lomas had reported a $56.4 million loss in fiscal 1988 and
a $304.5 million loss in the year that ended June 30.
   Hay said the firm's operations should not be affected by the
action and he anticipates no ``material staff reductions.''
   In June, Lomas announced a major restructuring program that
sought to reduce its outstanding debt by nearly two-thirds, from
$5.7 billion to about $2 billion. The company already had reduced
its total debt by $1.9 billion from the sale of assets.
   Lomas missed a $145 million payment on its senior debt on Sept.
1 and the creditors could have forced the immediate repayment of
all senior debt. But talks had been continuing between Lomas
officials and the debt-holders.

   About 5,400 workers at Timken Co. steel
plants walked off the job today after rejecting the latest contract
offer.
   The workers voted overwhelmingly over the weekend in Canton,
Columbus and Wooster to reject the four-year proposal and strike
the company, said Jack Nichelson, president of United Steelworkers
of America Local 1123 in Canton.
   Today's walkout began at 12:01 a.m.
   Timken, a manufacturer of speciality steel and tapered roller
bearings, is the largest employer in northeastern Ohio, with about
7,000 workers, including white-collar employees not in the union.
   ``We are very disappointed that the United Steelworkers did not
accept the company proposal,'' Timken spokesman James Mulder said
late Sunday. ``The wage and benefit package offered was outstanding
compared to that provided by others in the bearing and steel
industries.''
   No new talks have been set.
   Nichelson said union members' top concern was the company's
pension plan.
   The minimum pension for a worker who retires with 30 years'
service is $592 a month. The company had proposed raising that to
$667 a month, but the union was pushing for $1,000 a month,
Nichelson said.
   Timken also offered 43 cents an hour in a cost-of-living
increase and a pay increase of 25 cents an hour in the first year,
to be followed by an average increase of 25 cents an hour in the
second year and 50 cents an hour in the third year. There would be
no wage increases in the final year of the contract.
   The average hourly wage at Timken now stands at $11.83,
Nichelson said.

<HEAD>Co-Founder of Casual Corner Stores Dies</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WEST HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Stanley W. Vogel, who presided over
the growth of Casual Corner from a small sportswear shop to an
800-store chain, died in a Connecticut nursing home. He was 71.
   Vogel, who died Saturday, and his partner Charles E. Carples
took advantage of a trend toward sportswear that swept the country
and helped revolutionize retailing by providing easy access to the
clothes.
   In 1950, Vogel, who was a buyer for the former Brown-Thomson
retail store in Hartford, and Carples, a manager at Sage-Allen &amp;
Co. Inc., opened their first store in West Hartford.
   Carples said sportswear was a new concept whose time had come
when the first Casual Corner opened.
   ``It was only natural that people were dressing more casually
and were less formal in their approach to life because of the move
into suburbia,'' Carples said. ``Casual Corner was designed to
appeal to that.''
   The two men strove to create an atmosphere at Casual Corner far
removed from department stores.
   ``We wanted to create something more fun than work,'' Carples
said. ``And we felt we could create a store that would be really
fun to work in and shop in _ where both customers and sales people
coultners' fun.''
   In 1950, Casual Corner did $45,000 in business. In 1960, it
grossed $2 million and in 1969 annual sales were $14 million.
   In 1970, Vogel and Carples sold their 20 Casual Corner stores to
U.S. Shoe Corp. based in Cincinnati, and Vogel became president of
the corporation's specialty retailing division. Vogel retired in
1980.
   In 10 years at U.S. Shoe, he helped set up a division that now
has about 1,500 stores with 15,000 employees and $1 billion in
sales.

   OPEC ministers worked behind closed doors today to
try to restart stalled talks over whether they can lift oil
production and still keep crude prices steady.
   Algerian Mines Minister Sadek Boussena, one of the mediators in
the discussions of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting
Countries, left early to return to Algiers for a legislative
meeting.
   Hurrying to his car, he said he had no statement to make but
wished his colleagues ``much success.''
   ``We haven't agreed on anything yet,'' Ecuador's oil minister,
Diego Tamariz, told reporters. ``We're still analyzing the
situation.''
   Boussena has been pressing the ministers to maintain their
production ceiling at the current level in an effort to lift crude
prices by a dollar, up to the cartel's target of $18 a barrel.
   But a senior Algerian delegate, who demanded anonymity, said,
``We are willing to consider an increase in the ceiling if that
doesn't mean a decline in the price. That is our basic position.''
   Other countries want to raise the supply cap from the current
19.5 million barrels a day in the last three months of the year.
They argue demand is strong enough to absorb the increase without
upsetting prices.
   Ministers of the 13-nation cartel met for several hours Sunday
evening before breaking up to try to resolve their differences
privately. One official leaving the meeting said the meeting was
``going badly.''
   ``It seems that the ceiling is the imminent problem,'' said
Iraqi Oil Minister Issam al-Chalabi.
   According to an OPEC official who did not want to be identified
by name, a majority of the countries, including Iraq, Nigeria,
Kuwait and the United Arab Emirates, want an increase in the
ceiling. They are at odds, though, over how to divide up the
additional supply.
   Chalabi said he favors an increase in the supply cap, with the
extra amount shared proportionately among all 13. Each would get a
certain amount added to its individual supply quota.
   Kuwait and the United Arab Emirates already are pumping beyond
the quotas assigned them in June.
   A smaller group, including Algeria and Libya, wants to maintain
the ceiling at the current level to ensure that the group reaches
its price target.
   The ministers are described as very insistent on _ and locked
into _ their positions.
   OPEC Secretary-General Subroto told reporters, ``We are still
deliberating about the best way to achieve (our) goal.''
   He likened the oil ministers to hikers carrying maps and
compasses.
   ``But there seems to be some discussion about the route to reach
that objective,'' he said. ``The pro, con and the handicap of the
terrain are (being) evaluated.''
   He said the objective is ``Point X ... Everybody agrees the one
goal is Point X.''
   He declined to say more, but the goal is certain to be the
benchmark price.
   Subroto has predicted demand for the cartel's oil would reach 22
million barrels a day in the October-December period.
   The cartel's executive body, according to sources, has said
prices could reach $18 a barrel even if the cap were lifted to as
much as 21.5 million barrels a day _ but only if everyone agreed to
abide by his quota.
   Chalabi suggested the ministers had given up any attempt to
solve the problem of finding a more acceptable way to divvy up
production shares and set individual quotas.
   ``We should address the problem of the quotas if we can,'' he
said. ``We will continue (the discussions) in the meantime from now
until November.'' Their next meeting is scheduled for late November.
   In June, some ministers said they would try to settle the quota
issue at this meeting. There was no indication when the meeting
would end.
   Indonesian Oil Minister Ginandjar Kartasasmita said he would
leave Tuesday for Japan.
   The talks are officially held by a monitoring panel made up of
Algeria, Indonesia, Iran, Iraq, Kuwait, Nigeria, Saudi Arabia and
Venezuela.
   The other members _ Gabon, Ecuador, Libya, Qatar and the United
Arab Emirates _ were invited to attend.

<HEAD>High Prices in Japan Cut into Income Gains</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Despite a higher per capita income, the Japanese
have less purchasing power than consumers in other advanced
industrial countries because Japan's prices are so high, the
Economic Planning Agency says.
   In an annual report released Monday, the agency estimated that
prices in Tokyo were 39 percent higher than those in New York and
47 percent higher than those in Hamburg, West Germany.
   Its conclusion was based on a survey of prices of 400 selected
items in the three cities.
   The survey showed that housing rent and food subject to import
restrictions were particularly costly in Tokyo, but consumer
durables such as automobiles were not much more expensive than in
the other two cities, it said.
   The agency said 3.5 ounces of beef cost 86 cents in New York and
97 cents in Hamburg last November but cost $2.75 in Tokyo.
   A videotape recorder, however, cost $471 in New York, $682 in
Hamburg and $504 in Tokyo.
   The agency said prices of imported brand items, which should
have fallen as the Japanese yen rose in value against other
currencies, had remained very high relative to their prices in New
York, Paris and Dusseldorf.
   Because of the yen's rise, a sudden increase in Japanese
domestic prices quoted in dollar terms is ``unavoidable,'' the
report said, but the economic mechanism should work toward bringing
these prices into line.
   The agency said Japan's higher consumer prices resulted from
such things as government restrictions, consumer behavior and high
land prices.

   The stock market declined broadly today as the
dollar fell in foreign exchange and interest rates rose.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials dropped 12.92 to
2,668.69 in the first half hour of trading.
   Losers outnumbered gainers by nearly 2 to 1 in the early tally
of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 330 up, 621 down and
453 unchanged.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 16.10 million shares as of 10

   The dollar lost ground against leading foreign currencies after
officials of the Group of Seven industrialized countries issued a
statement over the weekend declaring recent strength in the U.S.
currency undesirable.
   That sent interest rates higher in the credit markets this
morning. Prices of long-term government bonds fell about $5 for
each $1,000 in face value, raising their yields to the 8.24
percent-8.30 percent range.
   Analysts said that dampened interest in stocks at a time when
many investors were already concerned that the market was due for a
``correction'' after its sharp rise over the first eight months of
the year.
   Losers among the blue chips included Philip Morris, down 1\ at
156]; Procter &amp; Gamble, down 1[ at 118}; General Motors, down \ at

   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks fell
.94 to 191.79. At the American Stock Exchange, the market value
index was off .19 at 381.19.
   On Friday the Dow Jones industrial average rose 1.33 to
2,681.61, finishing the week with a net gain of 7.03 points.
   Advancing issues outnumbered declines by about 8 to 7 on the
NYSE, with 727 up, 637 down and 576 unchanged.

   Grain and soybean futures prices declined
slightly today on the Chicago Board of Trade, reflecting forecasts
for good weather.
   Temperatures in most grain-growing areas were expected to warm
up this week after a chilly weekend. With little rain in the
forecasts, conditions should be ideal for corn and soybean
harvesting and winter-wheat planting.
   Frost occurred in the northern tier of Midwestern states over
the weekend and touched the northern extremes of Illinois, Indiana
and Ohio, but the chill was no worse than traders had expected and
had little impact on prices this morning.
   Traders said slack export business also contributed to the early
decline today.
   In early trading, wheat futures were { cent to 1 cent lower with
the contract for delivery in December at $3.88{ a bushel; corn was
unchanged to 1{ cents lower with December at $2.29\ a bushel; oats
were 1 cent lower across the board with December at $1.39} a

<HEAD>Dollar Tumbles</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: UPDATES thruout with dollar continuing to fall, details about
intervention</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The U.S. dollar tumbled in European trading today,
pushed down by concerted central-bank intervention following the
Group of Seven's decision to curb the currency's strength.
   Gold prices rose as much as $4 an ounce in morning trading.
   Traders said the intervention included the Bank of Japan, the
U.S. Federal Reserve and the Bank of Canada in Far Eastern trading,
and the West German Bundesbank, the Bank of England, the Swiss
National Bank and the Bank of France early in the European day.
   Unlike previous central bank dollar sales, which have occurred
in concentrated bursts, Monday's intervention appeared to have been
deliberately spread out over a greater length of time, dealers
said. The Swiss National Bank and the Bank of France, for example,
intervened more than 30 minutes after the Bundesbank and the Bank
of England, one Zurich trader said.
   Dealers said there is talk in the foreign-exchange market that
the central banks may have to come up with new intervention
strategies. As a result, the market was likely to remain timid,
dealers said.
   Central bankers and finance ministers of the Group of Seven
industrialized nations said at a weekend meeting in Washington,
D.C., that the dollar was too strong. The officials from the United
States, Canada, Britain, France, West Germany, Japan and Italy said
they would cooperate to curb the American currency's strength.
   In London, the dollar sank against the British pound. It cost
$1.6130 to buy one pound at midafternoon, compared with $1.6086 in
the morning and $1.5755 late Friday.
   Other afternoon dollar rates compared with late Friday: 1.9010
West German marks, down from 1.9495; 1.6500 Swiss francs, down from
1.6890; 6.4375 French francs, down from 6.5925; 2.1480 Dutch
guilders, down from 2.1935; 1,372.50 Italian lire, down from
1,407.50; and 1.1765 Canadian dollars, down from 1.1807.
   In Tokyo, where trading ends before Europe's business day
begins, the dollar plunged 2.05 yen to a closing 142.95 yen. Later,
in London, it was quoted at 142.77 yen in the afternoon.
   The dollar's fall triggered a gold rally.
   Gold opened in London at a bid price of $367.00 a troy ounce,
compared with late Friday's $364.50. At midmorning, the city's five
major bullion dealers fixed a recommended price of $368.75 an ounce.
   In Zurich, the bid price was $368.30 an ounce, up from $365.50
late Friday.
   Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold rose $2.95 to close at a bid $367.86
an ounce.
   Silver was quoted in London at a bid price of $5.33 a troy
ounce, up from Friday's $5.27.

   The value of the dollar plunged in hectic
trading on world currency markets today as the world's richest
countries dumped the greenback as a way of showing their
determination to block any further rise in the U.S. currency.
   The dollar sell-off began in Japanese currency markets in
turbulent trading which was later matched in European and New York
markets.
   Traders reported that the dollar's plunge was aided by
coordinated selling on the part of the central banks of the United
States, Japan, West Germany, Britain, France and Canada.
   Finance ministers and central bank presidents from those
countries, along with Italy, on Saturday issued a blunt statement
expressing displeasure with increases this year in the dollar's
value, a rise which many fear will abort needed improvement in the
U.S. trade deficit. A stronger dollar makes U.S. products less
competitive on overseas markets.
   The finance ministers, in Washington for the annual meetings of
the International Monetary Fund and World Bank, pronounced their
satisfaction today with the dollar's decline.
   French Finance Minister Pierre Beregovoy said that the
coordinated intervention on the part of governments to push the
dollar lower was a ``confirmation and illustration'' of the resolve
of the Group of Seven to cooperate on international economic
matters.
   Some critics have complained that the G-7 coordination process
was in danger of coming apart, given a failure so far in the year
by the group to influence the dollar's exchange rate.
   Beregovoy, briefing reporters at the French Embassy, said that
the G-7 communique ``meant what it said'' and he said it reflected
``the reassertion of our common will to cooperate in monetary
terms.''
   In Tokyo, where trading ends before Europe's business day
begins, the dollar plunged 2.05 yen to a closing 142.95 yen. The
dollar later fell even further in London trading.
   Karl Otto Poehl, president of the West German central bank,
confirmed for reporters that widespread intervention was occurring
and said that it was ``appropriate and reasonable'' given the need
to make further progress in reducing world trade imbalances.
   Despite today's sharp plunge in the dollar's value, private
economists said it remained to be seen whether intervention would
work any better in the long term than it has up until now at
keeping the U.S. currency from rising.
   The sessions of the IMF and World Bank are focusing on such
topics as the Bush administration efforts to reduce a portion of
the Third World's debt burden and proposals to assist in the
dramatic political and economic reforms under way in Poland and
Hungary.
   IMF officials told reporters today that there had been no final
decision on the question of doubling IMF resources, although they
predicted that the matter could still be resolved by the end of
this year.
   While there is overwhelming support among the 152 nations for at
least some type of increase, the United States, which has veto
power on the issue, remains opposed.
   IMF Managing Director Michel Camdessus insisted that the outlook
for an increase still looked encouraging, saying he believed there
was a ``growing perception of the weight of the responsibilities
put on our sholders'' to help carry out the Bush administration's
Third World debt reduction strategy.
   In the Group of Seven communique, issued late Saturday after a
day of closed-door dicussions, Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady
and his counterparts from the other countries expressed their
displeasure with the persistent increase in the dollar's value this
year.
   The joint statement called the dollar's increase ``inconsistent
with longer-run economic fundamentals'' and said a further rise
could ``adversely affect prospects for the world economy.''
   The Saturday session was the first meeting of the finance
ministers and central bank presidents since last April. At that
time, the officials had also decried the rising value of the
dollar, although the language used was milder in tone.
   The stepped-up sense of urgency led many private economists to
expect a heavy effort at intervention today.
   David Jones, an economist with Aubrey G. Lanston &amp; Co., a
government securities dealer, said he was also looking for Japan
and West Germany to show more willingness in the months ahead to
raise interest rates in their countries as a way of influencing
currency markets.
   Higher interest rates overseas relative to U.S. rates would make
dollar-denominated investments less attractive to foreign investors.
   But some analysts said they were not sure whether the latest
effort would be any more successful than the April vow to keep the
dollar from rising in value.
   Despite heavy intervention in the currency markets since last
spring, the dollar has continued rising and now stands about 20
percent above its January level in relation to the Japanese yen. It
is about 25 percent above its January level against the West German
mark.
   Before Saturday's G-7 meeting, the dollar bought 146 yen and
1.95 marks, well above what is presumed to be the upper limit of
the trading range sought by the Group of Seven _ 140 yen and 1.90
marks.
   ``The fact of the matter is intervention does not work in the
long run,'' said economist David Wyss of DRI-McGraw Hill. He and
other economists said what really was needed was for the United
States and other countries to improve underlying economic
conditions.
   For the United States, that would mean stronger efforts to
reduce its budget deficit, which drains away domestic savings and
pushes up U.S. interest rates, and greater efforts in West Germany
and Japan to reduce their huge trade surpluses with the United
States.
   On Sunday, Brady said the administration was making strides in
reducing the federal deficit and he called on countries running
large trade surpluses, such as Japan and West Germany, to do more
to stimulate domestic demand and open their borders to U.S. exports.

<TEXT>
   Columbia Pictures Entertainment Inc., a movie
and television giant, said today it was talking with an
unidentified third party about a possible sale of the company.
   In a brief announcement, Columbia said its board planned to meet
Monday evening ``to review the status of the discussions.''
   The discussions involve ``the acquisition for cash of all of
Columbia's outstanding shares,'' the company said.
   In trading on the New York Stock Exchange, Columbia shot up
$4.87{ a share to $26 after the announcement. Based on the
company's 112.7 million shares outstanding, Columbia would have a
market value of about $2.93 billion.
   Coca-Cola Co. owns 49 percent of Columbia's outstanding shares.
   Columbia periodically has been the subject of takeover
speculation. Among the rumored suitors has been Japan's Sony Corp.,
which recently bought CBS Records and has indicated an interest in
buying a movie studio.
   Columbia Pictures owns two studios, Columbia Pictures and
Tri-Star Pictures.
   Among Columbia's recent releases have included ``Ghostbusters
II,'' ``Karate Kid Part III,'' ``When Harry Met Sally'' and
``Casualties of War'' while Tri-Star has come out with ``See No
Evil, Hear No Evil'' and ``Lockup.''
   The New York-based company also is a major supplier of
television programs, including ``Who's The Boss,'' ``Designing
Women'' and ``Married ... with Children.''
   It also owns the Loews Theatre Management Corp., one of the
leading motion picture chains with 820 screens in 22 locations at
the end of its latest fiscal year ended Feb. 28.
   Columbia Pictures earned $16 million, or 14 cents a share, on
revenue of $1.62 billion for the year ended Feb. 28.

<TEXT>
   The St. Louis Sun, starting from scratch in an
attempt to buck the trend of newspaper mergers and shutdowns,
debuted early today before a curious and eager community.
   The first edition of the tabloid featured a photograph of a
bright sun rising over the Gateway Arch.
   The lead story was the launch of the newspaper, and its headline
was ``St. Louis, We Have Liftoff.''
   The Sun is the first major newspaper to begin from scratch in a
big U.S. city since the Washington Times debuted in 1982.
   Ralph Ingersoll II, chairman and chief executive officer of New
Jersey-based Ingersoll Publications Co., which owns the Sun, is
moving to St. Louis from Connecticut to become editor-in-chief.
   ``I think it's pretty clear that print has a good future. I
haven't the least doubt the St. Louis Sun will be profitable. It's
one of the lower risk ventures we've undertaken,'' he said.
   ``This newspaper will be successful if it's relevant. That's our
number one priority.''
   To herald the Sun's rising, Ingersoll and other executives
gathered at a sidewalk reception this morning at the city's
downtown offices. A Dixieland jazz band played in the background as
Sun employees waded into traffic to hand out free copies of the
morning newspaper.
   Sue Selvidge, a clerk at World News in downtown St. Louis, said
this morning that the paper was selling briskly. ``Everygody likes
to see something new,'' she said.
   Already, the Sun has attracted 55,000 subscribers _ nearly twice
the level company officials had been aiming for after a month of
publication. Advertising space in the inaugural edition was sold
out.
   The Sun started printing 200,000 copies of the newspaper about
9:30 p.m. Sunday night, three hours earlier than its planned
deadline, in order to meet expected heavy demand.
   The 1-day-old Sun will be competing with the St. Louis
Post-Dispatch, which will be 111 years old in December. The
Post-Dispatch has been the city's only daily newspaper since the
St. Louis Globe-Democrat folded in October 1986.
   ``We definitely welcome competition,'' said the Post-Dispatch's
managing editor, David Lipman. ``We find it exciting and
challenging.''
   The Post-Dispatch's circulation has been increasing all summer
and its 10 biggest advertisers are spending more money than they
were a year ago. Last week's paid circulation stood at 564,000 on
Sunday and 384,000 on weekdays.
   The Post-Dispatch took note of its new competition with a story
on the bottom of today's front page that included this quote from
Editor William Woo:
   ``It's a good-looking newspaper, but it's not a newspaper that
was invented on Mars or is the likes of something that people have
never seen.''
   Sun officials are calling the new tabloid a ``laptop'' paper
that's ``user friendly.''
   Although industry analysts are closely following the Sun's
progress, they don't think it will have that big an impact on the
industry.
   ``No matter what happens in St. Louis, I don't think you're
going to see many people rushing to try the same thing around the
country,'' said John Morton, a Washington-based newspaper analyst.
   Morton said there are only 19 cities in the country that still
have two commercially competitive newspapers, and it appears that
number will be shrinking soon.

   The number of working U.S. oil and gas rigs
increased by two last week to total 967, continuing a slow but
steady rise and remaining above year-ago levels for the fourth
straight week, Baker Hughes Inc. reported today.
   A year ago, the count stood at 917, the company said.
   Baker Hughes' rig count _ the widely watched industry index of
drilling activity _ reflects the number of rigs actively exploring
for oil as of last Friday, not the number of rigs actively
producing oil.
   Houston-based Hughes Tool Co., an oil toolmaker company that
merged with Baker International Corp. of Orange, Calif., has kept
track of the rig count since 1940.
   In December 1981, at the height of the oil boom, the rig count
reached a peak of 4,500. But oil prices plunged to less than $10
per 42-gallon barrel in the summer of 1986, prompting a collapse in
the rig count that bottomed out at 663 _ the lowest since Hughes
began compiling figures.
   Among major oil producing states, Texas posted the most
increases by adding nine rigs. Other increases were seen in
Oklahoma with five; New Mexico, two; Ohio, two; Pennsylvania, two;
and Michigan, one.
   Wyoming showed the most decreases with five, followed by North
Dakota, with three, and California, Colorado and Kansas, which each
lost one rig.

<HEAD>State Broadcast Services Strike to Protest Private TV Bill</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ATHENS, Greece (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Employees of the state-run television
corporation went on strike Monday to protest a proposed bill
establishing private television.
   The blackout, which was to last until 1 a.m. Tuesday, was the
longest in a series of work stoppages that began Sept. 7 to protest
the legislation breaking the state monopoly on television.
Parliament was expected to pass the bill.
   The government rejected a series of employee demands at a
meeting on Monday, said Sifis Kakavoulis, deputy president of the
Federation of Employees of the Hellenic Radio Television
Corporation.
   Kakavoulis said one of the employees' key demands was that they
be represented on a special council overseeing state and private
radio and television.
   ``Another point of contention with the government is that the
bill does not oblige private television stations to present any
Greek programs,'' Kakavoulis said. ``This means that they will be
able to present only foreign programs, with which ERT won't be able
to compete.''
   Foreign programs are cheaper to buy than Greek productions.
   The government has called the strikes politically inspired and
said it would ask the courts to declare further work stoppages
illegal.
   The employees' federation is controlled by the Panhellenic
Socialist Movement, which lost the June 18 general elections after
eight years in power.
   The elections produced a hung parliament, resulting in a
conservative-leftist coalition that promised to clean up scandals
from the previous socialist administration. New elections are
scheduled Nov.5.
   Private TV stations are expected to start broadcasting after the
general elections.

   The Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index, the most
closely watched market index, finished 10.6 points, or 0.4 percent,

   The Great Atlantic &amp; Pacific Tea Co. Inc.
Monday posted a 21 percent quarterly profit gain on an 11.3 percent
increase in sales.
   The supermarket chain reported net income of $35.6 million in
its second quarter ended Sept. 9, or 93 cents per share, on sales
of $2.59 billion. A&amp;P had earnings of $29.4 million, or 77 cents
per share, on sales of $2.33 billion in the second quarter of 1988.
   Net income for the first half of the year increased 20 percent
to $81 million, or $2.12 per share, from $67.5 million, or $1.77
per share.
   ``The first half of 1989 has been essentially on target in terms
of our overall results,'' chairman James Wood said in a statement.
``The consolidation of the A&amp;P-Farmer Jack operations in Michigan
is proceeding according to plan and we have experienced relative
stability in most of our operating areas.''
   Earlier this year, A&amp;P acquired stock in Borman, which operates
Farmer Jack food markets in the Detroit area.
   Wood also said A&amp;P's investment in Isosceles PLC, which controls
Gateway PLC, Great Britain's third largest food retailer, would
carry an estimated quarterly charge of 5 cents.
   A&amp;P operates more than 1,200 supermarkets in 27 states and
Canada under the A&amp;P, Super Fresh, Food Emporium, Kohl's, Dominion,
Waldbaum's and Farmer Jack trade names.

   Coors Brewing Co. said today it has agreed
to pay $425 million to acquire most of Stroh Brewing Co.'s brewing
and container facilities and brands.
   The move is part of a drive begun in the early 1980s by Coors to
expand from a regional to a national brewer.
   ``If we are going to be in the beer business long-term, we've
got to be a major and significant competitor,'' Chairman Peter
Coors told a news conference.
   He said when the transaction is completed, Stroh ``will continue
to exist, but the operating company will not.'' Terms of the deal
were not disclosed.
   Coors said he has not yet determined which of the Stoh brands
would be retained or where they would be brewed.
   ``It's premature to talk strategy,'' he said, noting that some
brands ``do not overlap significantly.''
   Coors, a business unit of Adolph Coors Co., is the nation's
fourth-largest brewer while Stroh, based in Detroit, is ranked
third.
   Allan Kaplan, an analyst with Merrill Lynch &amp; Co. in New York,
said combining Stroh and Coors would produce a No. 3 company with
18.7 percent of the market.
   The top two brewers are Anheuser-Busch Cos., with a 43 percent
share, and Miller Bewing Co., with a 21.8 percent share.
   Stroh has been looking for potential partners since February and
announced Aug. 31 it was laying off 300 of its 1,500 white-collar
employees nationwide. Chairman Peter Stroh said in a statement Aug.
31 that the cuts were being made because the company had been
unable to find a partner.
   The agreement would allow Coors to acquire the following brands:
Stroh's and Stroh's Light; Signature; Schlitz, Schlitz Light and
Schlitz Malt Liquor; Schaefer Light, Scaefer non-alcohol and
low-alcohol brands; Old Milwaukee and Old Milwaukee Light; Red
Bull; Silver Thunder, and St. Barts, a non-alcohol brand, as well
as the licensing rights to Piels, Piels Light and Augsburger.
   The acquisition also includes plants in St. Paul, Minn.; Tampa,
Fla., Winston-Salem, N.C.; Longview, Texas; and Allentown, Pa.
   Stroh said it would keep breweries in Memphis, Tenn., and Van
Nuys, Calif. In its announcement, Coors said in will pay $425
million for the Stroh assets, and part of that price would include
the assumption of certain long-term debt and other selected
liabilities. It was not immediately know how much debt was involved.
   The transaction is subject to approval by the boards of
directors of both companies.

   Grain and soybean futures prices drifted to a
mixed close Monday on the Chicago Board of Trade, where a lack of
significant news kept the trading floor quiet and activity thin.
   Bearish forecasts for a week of clear weather _ good for
harvesting in the Midwest and winter-wheat planting in the Plains _
were offset by predictions for frost later this week in northern
growing areas.
   Frost occurred over the weekend in the northern tier of
Midwestern states and touched the northern extremes of Illinois,
Indiana and Ohio but the chill was no worse than traders had
expected and had little impact on prices.
   Traders are looking forward to Thursday's quarterly Agriculture
Department report on U.S. grain stocks, which could give the
futures markets their next important supply-and-demand cues.
   At the close, wheat futures were } cent to 2 cents higher with
the contract for delivery in December at $3.90 a bushel; corn was \

oats were 1 cent to 1\ cents higher with December at $1.42 a

   Striking workers picketed Monday near Timken
Co. steel plants after contract talks broke off Sunday and more
than 5,400 people walked off the job.
   Pickets marched peacefully at three plants near Canton. Timken
also has two other plants in the state. The walkout affects a total
of 5,440 out of 7,000 employees at the three facilities.
   The walkout began at 12:01 a.m. Monday, when a four-year
contract expired after a dispute over benefits and pay. No new
talks were set Monday, said Timken spokesman Jim Mulder.
Negotiations began in mid-August.
   ``I think we've sacrificed enough, and now it's time for our
fair share,'' said Don Roan, a bearing operator who has worked for
Timken 23 years. ``This is just a matter of getting what we think
we have coming to us.''
   Timken proposed raising the minimum pension from $592 a month to
$667 per month for those who retire after 30 years' service. The
union wants a $1,000 a month pension benefit, said Jack Nichelson,
president of United Steelworkers Local 1123.
   Timken offered a cost-of-living increase of 43 cents an hour,
plus a pay raise of 25 cents an hour in the first year. The company
proposed an average increase of 25 cents an hour in the second year
and 50 cents an hour in the third year. There would be no wage
increase in the final year.
   The current average hourly wage at Timken is $11.83, Nichelson
said.
   Timken makes alloy steel bars and tubes and tapered roller
bearings for use in the automotive, railroad and construction
industry.
   Its steelmaking operations are concentrated in the United States
and also produces bearings in Canada, Australia, Great Britain,
France, Brazil and South Africa. The company, which employs about
18,000 people worldwide, plans to build a plant in India.

<HEAD>Andersen-Price Waterhouse Merger May Be Scrapped: Report</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The proposed merger of Arthur Andersen &amp; Co. and
Price Waterhouse into what would become the world's largest
accounting firm may be scrapped due to differences over retirement
funding, according to a report published Monday.
   A dispute over the name of the combined firm and various sticky
legal and internal issues also threaten to derail the merger talks,
the Wall Street Journal reported, quoting unidentified parties
close to both firms.
   Neither Chicago-based Andersen nor New York-based Price
Waterhouse would comment on the report.
   Some industry observers told The Associated Press that while
retirement funding may be a major obstacle to a merger, the
negative consequences of not merging are likely to bring the
bickering companies together in the end.
   If the problem is combining retirement plans, ``who ought to be
better able to do that than accountants,'' said James Emerson,
publisher of Emerson's Professional Services Review in Bellevue,
Wash.
   The Journal said Andersen accrues or sets up a reserve for its
partners in advance of their retirement, and they generally receive
$25,000 to $50,000 a year in benefits after they retire.
   Price doesn't fund its retirement benefits in advance and pays
its partners about $100,000 a year after they retire, the newspaper
said.
   Emerson said many people in the acconting field were saying a
merger looked unlikely, ``but if you had asked me a month ago, I
would have told you they were saying it wouldn't work then, too.''
   Emerson said he believes Andersen and Price will merge, largely
because of what each firm stands to lose if they don't.
   Without a merger, Andersen, the second-largest U.S. accounting
firm, would be unlikely to regain the No. 1 position it lost
earlier this year when Ernst &amp; Whinney and Arthur Young &amp; Co.
combined their operations.
   Andersen needs to expand its foreign operations, currently the
smallest of any major U.S. accounting firm, and would be unlikely
to do so without a merger, Emerson said.
   Steven Stiling, who resigned from Andersen last month as a
managing director in consulting to join CSC Consulting Group of
Cambridge, Mass., said that without a merger to strengthen its
accounting business, Andersen's consulting arm would possibly split
off as a separate company.
   Consulting has been Andersen's fastest-growing business in
recent years but the firm has been unable to halt the defections of
its top consulting partners, who are unhappy with subsidizing the
accounting and related operations.
   For Price Waterhouse, the No. 5 U.S. accounting firm, failure to
merge with Andersen would mark its second aborted merger since
1984, when merger talks with Deloitte Haskins &amp; Sells fell through.
Deloitte combined with Touche, Ross &amp; Co. earlier this year.
   ``Two failed mergers doesn't look good,'' Emerson said.
   Other hurdles Andersen and Price would have to overcome include
a potential conflict of interest in their dealings with
International Business Machines Corp. and Hewlett Packard Corp.,
according to the Journal.
   Andersen has joint ventures with both firms to develop computer
integration products while Price is the auditor for both firms.
Accounting profession ethics rules ban business ties with audit
clients.
   Andersen and Price Waterhouse began formal talks to explore the
feasibility of a merger in July. The two firms announced on Sept. 5
that they would need more time to continue their merger talks.
   A merged company would reap $5 billion a year in worldwide
revenue and $2.7 billion in U.S. revenue.

<HEAD>Governing Body Urges Members to Pay Arrears</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RUTH SINAI</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Cabinet ministers who oversee the
International Monetary Fund said Monday that back dues owed by
member nations continue to grow, and they urged repayment of the
arrears to help ease the burden on other countries.
   In a communique after several days of deliberations, the Interim
Committee of the IMF also said many of the organization's 152
member nations support a ``substantial increase'' in the lending
funds provided by the institution.
   The question of increasing the lending reserves is one of the
central issues at this year's annual meeting of the IMF and its
sister organization, the World Bank, which was to begin Tuesday.
   IMF Director Michel Camdessus is urging the member nations to
double so-called quotas from $120 billion. Others say he will only
get a 50 perent to 70 percent increase, while U.S. officials have
said they believe the IMF has adequate resources to respond to the
needs of poorer countries.
   The United States is the largest contributor to both
organizations and has the biggest voting share.
   ``There was widespread support in the committee on the need for
a substantial increase in quotas ... although a few members believe
that the Fund has adequate resources at the present time to fulfill
its responsibilities,'' said the statement issued at the end of the
panel's deliberations.
   The committee called for a decision to be made on the proposed
increases by the end of the year.
   The panel welcomed ``the significant reduction in the number of
members in arrears.'' But is also was ``concerned that the overall
amount of arrears had nonetheless continued to rise, owing to the
failure of a few countries with protracted arrears to meet their
financial obligations.''
   The back dues to the IMF totaled $3.75 billion at the end of
September, compared with $2.37 billion at the same time last year.
   Those with the longest back dues, which have been declared
ineligible for further lending until they repay some of the money,
are Cambodia, Guyana, Liberia, Panama, Peru, Sierra Leone, Somalia,
the Sudan and Zambia.
   ``The committee again called on all members in arrears to adopt
policies promptly to correct their economic imbalances and
regularize their relations with the fund, bearing in mind the
burden that overdue obligations impose on other fund members,'' the
statement said.

   RJR Nabisco Inc. said Monday it had made the
last major asset sale under a $5.5 billion divestiture plan as an
investor group led by Merrill Lynch &amp; Co. agreed to buy its Del
Monte canned food business for $1.48 billion.
   Del Monte's senior management, Citicorp Capital Investors Ltd.
and Kikkoman Corp. also are members of the investor group.
   RJR Nabisco said proceeds from the sale will bring to
approximately $4.9 billion the amount of money it has earned from
its divestiture program.
   The company began selling assets to reduce its debt following
the record $24.53 billion buyout of the food and tobacco giant by
Kohlberg Kravis Roberts &amp; Co. earlier this year.
   Sarah Sheckler, who analyzes RJR Nabisco for Duff &amp; Phelps Inc.
in Chicago, said the asset sales are ``proceeding well'' and that
the prices RJR Nabisco has received were generally in line with
expectations.
   The company previously announced the sale of five European food
businesses for $2.5 billion; its Chun King food division for $52
million; its Associated Biscuits International Ltd. for $44
million; and the fresh fruit operations of Del Monte for $875
million.
   ``We don't anticipate that there will be any more major
divestitures,'' RJR Nabisco spokesman David Kalis said Monday.
   RJR Nabisco management would look at the company's businesses
individually and decide where it could make further cuts, Kalis
said.
   Ms. Sheckler said she expected RJR Nabisco to sell individual
grocery product lines to achieve its goal of $5.5 billion.
   There had been speculation that RJR Nabisco might sell its
Planters LifeSavers Co., but the company apparently plans to retain
the division.
   RJR Nabisco had been expected to sell Del Monte's canned food
business to a group led by Citicorp Venture Capital. However, the
company was forced to revamp the deal after the Federal Reserve
Board's staff expressed concern that the transaction did not comply
with regulations limiting banks' ownership of nonfinancial
companies.
   Citicorp was forced to reduce its stake in the Del Monte
holdings because federal banking rules prohibit banks from owning
more than 5 percent of voting stock and 25 percnet of non-voting
stock in non-financial firms.
   Businesses included in the latest sale included Del Monte Foods
USA, Del Monte Foods Europe, Del Monte's processed food business in
Mexico, the Caribbean and the Far East and its pineapple operations
in the Philippines and Kenya.
   RJR Nabisco said it would keep Del Monte-Aylmer Canada, Del
Monte's processed food business in Venezuela, and Nabisco food
businesses in Latin America that had been managed by Del Monte.

   Stock prices posted a broad loss today as the
dollar fell in foreign exchange and interest rates rose.
   Trading was light.
   The dollar lost ground against leading foreign currencies after
officials of the Group of Seven industrialized countries issued a
statement over the weekend declaring recent strength in the U.S.
currency undesirable.
   That sent interest rates higher in the credit markets. Prices of
long-term government bonds fell about $10 for each $1,000 in face
value, raising their yields to the 8.29 percent-8.35 percent range.
   Analysts said that dampened interest in stocks at a time when
many investors were already concerned that the market was due for a
``correction'' after its sharp rise over the first eight months of
the year.

<HEAD>World Bank Unit Offers Help To Privatize Banks, Industry in Poland</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CARL HARTMAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A unit of the World Bank has offered to help
Poland's non-communist government privatize its economy, including
creating a new financial system, a bank official said Monday.
   Sir William Ryrie, executive vice president of the bank's
International Finance Corp., said he made the offer Sunday to
Polish Finance Minister Leszek Balcerowicz.
   The IFC is the section of the World Bank that deals with private
enterprise rather than government.
   ``Other groups are talking about help to Poland,'' said one IFC
official, who spoke on condition he not be named. ``We're making a
concrete proposal.''
   Such a venture poses problems, Ryrie said at a news conference
at which he discussed Poland and Hungary.
   ``You have economies which are entirely state owned and
controlled, now trying to make the transition and it's a very
difficult transition to make,'' he said.
   French Finance Minister Pierre Beregovoy said he had seen the
economic plan of Poland's non-communist government, but that it was
too soon to comment on it.
   One major problem is Poland's $42 billion debt, three-quarters
of which is owed to governments rather than private banks. Creditor
governments are being asked to postpone payments due this year and
next.
   The IFC program calls for new private foreign investment in
Poland, especially joint ventures between foreign investors and
Polish interests. It also offers to help on privatizing state-owned
enterprises, creation of a new bank or banks to provide a base for
more private companies, and help in developing capital markets.
   Balcerowicz represents Poland as one of the 152 governments that
own the World Bank and its sister organization, the International
Monetary Fund. The groups are holding their annual meetings here
this week.

<HEAD>Report: Checchi Told to Cut KLM Investment in Northwest</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government has asked Northwest Airlines
owner Alfred Checchi to sharply reduce the $400 million investment
made in the carrier by KLM Royal Dutch Airlines, according to a
published report Monday.
   Transportation Secretary Samuel Skinner made the request in a
meeting last Friday where Skinner told Checchi his conclusions from
a review of Northwest's financial health, The Wall Street Journal
reported.
   The newspaper, quoting two unidentified sources, said Checchi
had no comment. Neither the Transportation Department nor Northwest
has disclosed Skinner's findings, which are expected to made public
later this week.
   KLM made the investment to help Checchi finance the $3.65
billion purchase of Northwest's parent company, NWA Inc., based in
Eagan, Minn.
   Although foreign companies cannot own more than 25 percent of a
U.S. airline, KLM provided 57 percent of the $700 million in equity
Checchi raised to buy Northwest. KLM officially owns only 5 percent
of Northwest because its investment is mostly in nonvoting
preferred stock.
   One person familiar with Skinner's decisions said he wants to
cut KLM's investment in Northwest from $400 million to $175
million, an amount equal to 25 percent of the $700 million in
equity Checchi raised, the Journal reported.
   Skinner and other Transportation Department officials have
expressed concern about the foreign interest in recent airline
takeovers and the level of debt carriers are being forced to assume.
   Foreign ownership of U.S. airlines raises concerns about
national security, competition and bilateral negotiations on
international routes, Skinner has said.
   Transportation Department spokesman Hal Paris declined to
comment Monday on the newspaper report. Northwest also has declined
to disclose what Skinner said to Checchi last week.

   The stock market sustained a broad loss Monday
as the dollar fell in foreign exchange and interest rates rose.
   Trading set its slowest pace in more than 2{ months.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials dropped 22.42 points to
a five-week low of 2,659.19.
   Declining issues outnumbered advances by more than 2 to 1 in
nationwide trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed stocks, with
445 up, 1,031 down and 487 unchanged.
   Volume on the floor of the Big Board came to 121.13 million

   Nationwide, consolidated volume in NYSE-listed issues, including
trades in those stocks on regional exchanges and in the
over-the-counter market, totaled 148.51 million shares.
   The dollar lost ground against leading foreign currencies after
officials of the Group of Seven industrialized countries issued a

currency undesirable.
   That sent interest rates higher in the credit markets. Prices of
long-term government bonds fell about $10 for each $1,000 in face

   Analysts said that dampened interest in stocks at a time when
many investors were already concerned that the market was due for a
``correction'' after its sharp rise over the first eight months of
the year.
   Columbia Pictures Entertainment led the active list, up 5\ at
26] on a report that Sony Corp. was offering to acquire the
company, including the 49 percent interest in it held by Coca-Cola.
Coca-Cola shares rose | to 63.
   Sony, meanwhile, gained 1] to 59{. Other Japanese issues turning
in a strong showing included Masushita Electrical, up 4~ at 164,

by an employee-management group.
   Lomas Financial, which filed for protection under Chapter 11 of
the federal bankruptcy law, tumbled 1\ to 1~. Just last year the
stock traded as high as 22\.
   As measured by Wilshire Associates' index of more than 5,000

<HEAD>Dollar Ends Sharply Lower, Gold Rises</HEAD>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A show of strength by the Group of Seven major
industrial companies sent the dollar sliding Monday.
   Gold prices moved higher.
   Several central banks, including the Federal Reserve, sold
dollars against major foreign currencies to bring the dollar down
sharply from its recent high levels.
   The dollar regained some ground late in the day, but dealers
said trading was nervous after a weekend meeting in which Group of
Seven finance ministers and central bank chiefs said they were
determined to keep the U.S. currency from rising.
   ``They're trying to show some muscle,'' Robert Ryan, senior
currency trader with Irving Trust Co., said of the seven nations.
``The market is wondering who's going to win the battle.''
   In a strongly worded communique, the United States, West
Germany, Japan, France, Britain, Italy and Canada said ``a rise in
the dollar above current levels, or an excessive decline, could
affect prospects for the world economy.''
   Earl Johnson, a vice president at Harris Trust &amp; Co. in Chicago,
predicted ``the market is going to be nervous going long'' because
traders are concerned about continued central bank intervention and
possible interest rate hikes in West Germany and Japan.
   When interest rates rise overseas, the dollar tends to fall if
the increases are not matched in this country. Johnson said some
dollar traders expect U.S. economic growth to slow and the Fed to
relax interest rates here.
   The Bank of Japan led Monday's market intervention, and the Fed
and the Bank of Canada also sold dollars in Japan, dealers said.
   The Fed also intervened in later trading, as did the British,
West German, French and Swiss central banks, they said.
   In Tokyo, the dollar plunged 2.05 yen to a closing 142.95 yen.
Later, in London, it was quoted at 142.69 yen, and in New York, it
skidded to 142.13 yen from late Friday's 146.05.
   The dollar also plummeted against the British pound. It cost
$1.6080 to buy one pound in London, more expensive than $1.5755
late Friday. In later New York trading, the pound was quoted at
$1.6175, compared with late Friday's $1.5715.
   Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late Friday's
quotes, included: 1.89895 West German marks, down from 1.9530;
1.6480 Swiss francs, down from 1.6933; 6.4370 French francs, down
from 6.6025; 1,372.875 Italian lire, down from 1,405.38; and
1.17625 Canadian dollars, down from 1.18135.
   Other late dollar rates in Europe, compared with late Friday's
prices, included: 1.9055 West German marks, down from 1.9495;
1.6565 Swiss francs, down from 1.6890; 6.4540 French francs, down
from 6.5925; 2.1480 Dutch guilders, down from 2.1935; 1,377.00
Italian lire, down from 1,407.50; 1.1776 Canadian dollars, down
from 1.1807.
   In New York gold trading, the Commodity Exchange reported a troy
ounce of the precious metal rose to $369.80 from $366.20 on Friday,
while Republic National Bank said its late bid for a troy ounce of
gold rose to $368 from late Friday's $364.25.
   Gold advanced earlier in London to a late bid price of $367 a
troy ounce, compared with late Friday's $364.50.
   In Zurich, gold closed at a bid $366.75, compared with $365.50
late Friday, and in Hong Kong, it rose $2.95 to close at a bid
$367.86.
   Silver bullion prices edged downward in New York, falling to
$5.283 on the Commodity Exchange from late Friday's $5.286. Silver
held steady on the London market, where the metal traded at a late
bid price of $5.27 a troy ounce, unchanged from Friday.

   Animal-rights activists said Monday they are
beginning a nationwide boycott of Procter &amp; Gamble Co. to pressure
the company into stopping the use of animals in product safety
tests.
   The giant consumer products company said it has been studying
alternatives but that there aren't sufficient methods available to
make the elimination of animal tests possible.
   Holly Hazard, executive director of the Washington-based Doris
Day Animal League, met with company representatives at Procter &amp;
Gamble's headquarters to present her group's demands, but said
later she was disappointed with the results.
   She told a news conference earlier Monday that 36,000 of the
Doris Day League's members nationwide have returned cards
indicating they will support the boycott.
   The group accuses the Cincinnati-based P&amp;G of needlessly
torturing rabbits and other animals in laboratory tests in which
cosmetics and other products are forced into the eyes to document
exposure risks.
   P&amp;G, which manufactures a wide range of products from Crest
toothpaste to Pampers disposable diapers, had $21.4 billion in
worldwide sales during the past year.
   The Doris Day group and other animal-rights associations,
including In Defense of Animals and People for the Ethical
Treatment of Animals, say the tests are cruel, unnecessary and
produce irrelevant data that could be replaced by more humane tests.
   Ms. Hazard said P&amp;G representatives turned down her requests
Monday to provide data on the number of animals used in testing and
would not commit the company to support bills before Congress
designed to phase out the use of animals in testing.
   She said P&amp;G officials also refused to disavow any relationship
or contribution to the Animal Testing Coalition, which
animal-rights activists say is an industry group secretly committed
to battling the activists and persuading the public that animal
testing is necessary.
   P&amp;G spokeswoman Linda Ulrey said the company proposed the
coalition only as an industry vehicle to educate the public that
sufficient alternatives haven't been develped to permit the
elimination of animals in product tests.
   Ms. Ulrey said P&amp;G has spent $10 million in the last three years
on research into alternatives. She said that compares with $150,000
that P&amp;G plans to spend this year on the industry coalition.
   She said alternatives to animal testing include scientific
data-based predictions of effects of product exposure, and
computer-simulated results of exposure.
   This year several companies, including cosmetics maker Avons
Products Inc., have announced that they were discontinuing animal
tests and replacing them with alternative methods.
   But Ms. Ulrey said: ``Right now, the scientific community says
you cannot completely walk away from animal testing.''
   P&amp;G has won recognition for its research into alternatives to
animal testing and will receive an award in recognition next month
from the Massachusetts Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to
Animals, Ms. Ulrey said.
   Ms. Hazard and other activists said Monday they will stage
demonstrations at P&amp;G headquarters during the company's Oct. 10
shareholders' meeting. They also said they will demonstrate that
day at other P&amp;G opeations in Baltimore; Chicago; Dallas;
Greensboro, N.C.; Hatboro, Pa.; Iowa City, Iowa; Kansas City, Mo.:
Oxnard, Calif.: Phoenix, Ariz.: and Sacramento, Calif.
   Animal-rights activists have picketed P&amp;G's shareholders
meetings before. In 1987, P&amp;G's shareholders followed the company's
recommendation in rejecting a resolution to stop using animals in
product testing.
   In 1988, the shareholders followed P&amp;G's recommendation to
reject a resolution that would have required the company to
disclose the numbers of animals used in tests and how much it cost.
   P&amp;G officials have consistently refused to release such
information, saying it is privileged and is not necessarily
relevant for comparison with other corporations.

<DATELINE>WARSAW, Poland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Seeking new sources of money amid an
economic crisis, the government is asking Poles for a loan, issuing
treasury bills for the first time since World War II.
   But soaring inflation led the pro-Solidarity newspaper Gazeta
Wyborcza to advise readers that the bonds can be considered a way
to support the new non-communist-led government _ but not an
investment for savings.
   The government hopes to raise 420 billion zlotys, or $289
million. Bonds redeemable within six months will have a total face
value of 600 billion zlotys.
   The annual interest rate will be about 86 percent, about twice
as much as banks are paying in interest.
   But inflation during the month of August alone was put at 50
percent after government controls on food prices were lifted and
the value of the zloty continued to plummet as the government
printed more money to cover the budget deficit.
   The government budget deficit totals more than 4 trillion
zlotys, or $2.75 billion.
   Finance Vice Minister Andrzej Podsiadlo, announcing the start of
the bond sale next Monday, said he is optimistic the government
would be able to repay its obligations from the receipts from the
next bond issue planned.
   Planning for the bond issue began under the previous finance
minister, who was replaced by a Solidarity supporter after Tadeusz
Mazowiecki took office as the East bloc's first non-communist prime
minister Aug. 24 and formed a cabinet Sept. 12.
   Mazowiecki has been struggling to put together an economic
recovery plan that will satisfy Poles pressed by rising prices and
shortages of consumer goods and Western bankers considering aid
plans and rescheduling of payments on Poland's $39 billion foreign
debt.
   The bonds will be sold at banks and post offices until Dec. 30
and will be available to individuals, enterprises and foreigners
who obtain permission from the Finance Ministry.

<HEAD>Cotton Futures Surge After Crop-Threatening Chill</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID DISHNEAU</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Cotton futures prices made strong gains Monday on the New York
Cotton Exchange after a chilly night in the South threatened
further damage to a crop already badly battered by inclement
weather.
   On other markets, copper futures fell; gold and platinum rose;
energy futures advanced; grains and soybeans were mixed; and
livestock and meat futures were mixed.
   Cotton futures settled .15 cent to 1.27 cents higher with the
contract for delivery in October at 73.15 cents a pound.
   Prices had surged the 2-cents-a-pound daily limit earlier in the
session on reports of record-low temperatures overnight in the high
plains of Texas and the Mississippi Delta Region.
   Cold temperatures temporarily halt the development of the cotton
crop, which is rapidly maturing and in the early stages of the
harvest.
   ``It stops the growth completely until it gets warm again,''
said Ernest Simon, cotton specialist with Prudential Bache
Securities Inc. in New York.
   Profit-taking brought prices down near the end of the session
but forecasts for more cold weather later this week kept traders on
edge.
   The U.S. cotton crop has had a poor season, with too much rain
in some areas and not enough in others. In a Sept. 12 crop report,
the Agriculture Department projected this year's harvest at 12.28
million bales, 20 percent below last year's crop.
   Copper futures prices fell sharply on New York's Commodity
Exchange on news of a larger-than-expected, 13,500-metric-ton
increase in copper stocks registered with the London Metal Exchange.
   The market had expected the exchange's weekly report to show a
buildup of about 10,000 metric tons.
   Copper settled 2.6 cents to 2.85 cents lower with September at
$1.335 a troy ounce.
   Gold futures rose sharply on the Commodity Exchange and platinum
futures posted strong gains on the New York Mercantile Exchange as
the dollar weakened on international currency markets.
   Gold settled $3.60 to $4.20 higher with October at $370.30 a
troy ounce; silver was 0.1 cent to 0.5 cent lower with September at
$5.283 a troy ounce.
   Platinum futures settled $7.30 to $8.10 higher with October at
$488.10 a troy ounce.
   Most energy futures rose moderately amid jitters about an OPEC
meeting in Geneva.
   Ministers of the 13-nation Organization of Petroleum Exporting
Countries were reported to be near an agreement to raise their
collective production ceiling to 21 million barrels per day from
19.5 million barrels.
   Analysts said world demand for OPEC oil exceeds 22 million
barrels per day and many doubted the OPEC nations would adhere to
production quotas.
   West Texas Intermediate crude oil settled 18 cents to 20 cents
higher with November at $19.46 a barrel; heating oil was .26 cent
to .72 cent higher with October at 57.51 cents a gallon; unleaded
gasoline was .23 cent lower to .50 cent higher with October at
61.67 cents a gallon.
   Grain and soybean futures drifted to a mixed finish on the
Chicago Board of Trade, where a lack of significant news kept the
trading floor quiet and activity thin.
   Frost occurred over the weekend in the northern tier of
Midwestern states and touched the northern extremes of Illinois,
Indiana and Ohio but the chill was no worse than traders had
expected and had little impact on prices.
   Wheat futures settled 1 cent to 2 cents higher with December at
$3.90\ a bushel; corn was \ cent lower to 1} cents higher with
December at $2.30{ a bushel; oats were 1 cent to 1\ cents higher
with December at $1.42 a bushel; soybeans were 2 cents lower to 11
cents higher with November at $5.72{ a bushel.
   Frozen pork bellies fell sharply on the Chicago Mercantile
Exchange amid profit-taking following the Agriculture Department's
announcement Friday that 7,000 to 10,000 metric tons of U.S. pork
bellies would be donated to Poland.
   Hog futures advanced slightly while cattle futures were narrowly
mixed.
   Live cattle settled .35 cent lower to .22 cent higher with
October at 71.07 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .05 cent lower

<HEAD>Wolf Defends Profits He Would Make from Employee Buyout of UAL</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   In an apparent move to deflect criticism from
employees over the profits he stands to make from a
pilot-management buyout, UAL Corp. Chairman Stephen M. Wolf says he
is willing to work without a ``golden parachute'' and a year's
salary.
   In an interview published in Monday's Wall Street Journal, Wolf
defended the estimated $76.7 million he stands to reap from UAL
stock and options he holds if the proposed takeover of UAL, parent
of United Airlines, is completed.
   Under the $6.75 billion buyout proposal, United pilots would
make pay and benefits concessions worth $250 million a year over
seven years in exchange for a 75 percent stake in UAL.
   In his first interview since the UAL board of directors approved
the pilot-management buyout earlier this month, Wolf told the
Journal that he plans to forgo his $575,000 annual salary for the
first year after the takeover.
   He also said he was willing to work indefinitely without a
contract, which would prevent him from receiving his substantial
``golden parachute'' severance pay should he leave UAL.
   Wolf said he has asked other senior managers to follow his lead
and work without contracts. He also said he plans to donate $1
million from his profits to educational charities.
   Wolf, 48, is guaranteed to benefit financially from the
$300-a-share proposed buyout by senior managers, the pilots union
and British Airways PLC. He said, though, that he would do
everything in his power to make sure the employees make a profit on
their own investment in the takeover.
   While Wolf warned there is no way to guarantee that
rank-and-file employees will benefit from the takeover, he added,
``It is my objective to return to employees 100 percent of their
investment and a significant profit margin on top of that.''
   Documents filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission
disclosed Friday how much Wolf is guaranteed to make once the
buyout is completed, as well as the information that John C. Pope,
UAL's chief financial officer, would receive $37.7 million from his
UAL stock and options.
   Wolf would get $22.5 million for his 75,000 UAL shares and
$54.17 million for his options to buy another 250,000 shares. Pope
stands to make $3 million on his 10,000 shares and $34.65 million
on his options. The two would continue to run the company under the
buyout plan.
   The SEC disclosures came while Wolf and other senior managers
were trying to persuade all UAL employees to make wage concessions
and productivity improvements to help facilitate the takeover.
   So far, only the Air Line Pilots Association, a party to the
takeover, has agreed to participate. In addition to the $250
million a year in concessions, the pilots have pledged $200 million
from pension funds toward the buyout.
   The sharpest criticism of Wolf and the other senior executives
has come from the Machinists union, which is not participating in
the buyout.
   A Machinist spokesman said the union finds the Wolf windfall
``offensive,'' and also objects to the fact that UAL's outside
directors recently voted themselves $20,000-a-year salaries for
life and unlimited free travel privileges on the airline.
   The employees would own 75 percent of UAL under the proposal,
making it the largest employee-owned company in the nation. A
management group headed by Wolf would hold 10 percent, and British
Airways would hold the remaining 15 percent in exchange for a $750
million investment.

<HEAD>Sale Agreement With Coors Could End Stroh's Long Independence</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By WILLIAM S. BERGSTROM</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>DETROIT (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A $425 million buyout proposal by Coors Brewing
Co. could mean the end of independence for Stroh Brewing Co., a
139-year-old, family-owned pillar of Detroit's business community.
   Coors and Stroh said Monday they reached an agreement in
principle on Friday for the sale, ending a bid for national
dominance that Stroh began in 1982 when it acquired Jos. Schlitz
Brewing Co. for $494.7 million.
   Stroh said in February it wanted a partner with cash to help pay
off debts and enable it to come closer to matching advertising
dollars with the likes of beer market leader Anheuser-Busch Cos.
   But on Aug. 31 of this year, Chairman Peter Stroh,
great-grandson of the company founder, announced there were no
takers and that Stroh was trimming support of community events and
laying off 300 of its 1,500 white-collar workers to cut costs.
   Two hundred of the layoffs were in the company's Detroit
headquarters, the rest in its seven U.S. breweries. The company,
founded in 1850 by German immigrant Bernard Stroh, made its last
beer in Detroit in 1985.
   ``That there won't be a Stroh family in the beer business is
difficult for many people who have been in the industry,'' said
Jerry Steinman of the trade newsletter Beer Marketers Insights.
``Peter Stroh has been a well-liked person and his Uncle John
(board member John Stroh Jr.) was adored. So it's the end of an era
in the industry.''
   Peter Stroh issued a statement saying his company had neither
the size nor the money to compete with larger publicly held
competitors.
   Stroh spent an estimated $21 million last year promoting its
major brands, Stroh and Stroh Light, while Anheuser-Busch spent an
estimated $204 million promoting Budweiser and Bud Light, Beer
Marketer's Insights said.
   Stroh had cut expenditures such as sponsorship of auto racing,
National Audubon Society's television specials and community
programs, including annual Freedom Festival fireworks over the
Detroit River.
   The company recently launched an advertising campaign stressing
the family's background as brewers with roots in Germany more than
200 years ago. Stroh said that made the decision to sell difficult,
but caused the family to lean toward dealing with Coors, also a
family-run operation.
   ``I think you'll find a lot of people will be glad the suspense
is over,'' said one employee entering the company Monday after the
announcement of the deal with Coors. ``It's a relief,'' said the
worker, who wouldn't give her name.
   Several other Stroh employees declined comment. One man said he
didn't know how to react because he didn't know yet what would
become of his job.
   Stroh workers face a period of suspense waiting for word on who
will be laid off and who will stay to manage the company's
remaining businesses.
   Those include Sundance sparkling fruit-juice beverages, Beach
Club juice drinks, White Mountain and California Cooler wine
coolers, and interests in Spain's Cruz del Campo brewery and
Canada's Sleeman Brewing Co. in Guelph, Ontario.
   George Kuehn, senior vice president, counsel and secretary, said
the sale wouldn't affect Stroh family enterprises apart from the
brewery company, including family interests in the Stroh River
Place and Brewery Park office complexes and the newly opened $16
million, 109-room River Place Inn, all in downtown Detroit.
   ``Precise plans which we have for any of our remaining
facilities or businesses have not been determined,'' said Kuehn,
senior vice president, counsel and secretary. He said details would
be worked out in time to close the deal with Coors in January or
earlier.
   Kuehn said Stroh family members wouldn't comment beyond Peter
Stroh's statement.

   Crude oil futures rose Monday amid expectations
that OPEC would legitimize current production by raising its quota
but would not go any higher.
   ``There are a lot of optimistic people out there,'' said Greg
Dreis, energy broker with Merrill Lynch Energy Futures. ``As long
as OPEC production doesn't change and as long as demand remains
strong out there, it's not going to make that much difference.''
   On the New York Mercantile Exchange, the November contract for
West Texas Intermediate, the benchmark grade of crude oil, rose 18
cents to close at $19.46 a 42-gallon barrel. December crude rose 20
cents to $19.32 and January advanced 22 cents to $19.21 a barrel.
   Among refined products, heating oil for October delivery added
0.54 cent to finish at 57.51 cents a gallon, while other contract
months posted slightly higher gains.
   Unleaded gasoline for October delivery, which had risen last
week after reports of hurricane damage to a big refinery in St.
Croix, Virgin Islands, declined 0.28 cent to 61.67 cents a gallon.
November slipped 0.3 cent to 58.13 cents, while contracts for later
delivery rose.
   Traders said the meeting of the Organization of Petroleum
Exporting Countries in Geneva dominated the day's trading. Late in
the day, some OPEC delegates said the cartel was close to signing
an agreement that would formalize OPEC's production at about 21
million barrels. However, a meeting scheduled late in the day was
abruptly postponed until Tuesday.
   Iraqi Oil Minister Issam Al-Chalabi said the delay was due to
slight differences among some members over the exact quota.
   OPEC has a stated ceiling of 19.5 million barrels a day, but
so-called cheating by some of the 13 members has put the
oil-producing group's actual production at about 22 million barrels.
   Some OPEC sources have said they believe current world demand is
enough to sustain a higher quota without weakening prices. Although
crude prices are below levels of this spring, they have remained in
the $19-$20 range.
   Analysts said legitimizing OPEC's production at around 21
million barrels a day probably would not dampen prices as long as
members stick to the agreement.

<HEAD>Hong Kong Group Raises Cummins Stake Again</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   For the third time in less than a week, a Hong
Kong investment concern announced Monday that it has increased its
holdings in Cummins Engine Co., this time to 14.9 percent.
   Industrial Equity (Pacific) Ltd. said in a filing with the
Securities and Exchange Commisson that it bought 140,000 more
shares of the Columbus, Ind. diesel engine-maker's stock last
Friday.
   The stock was purchased on the New York Stock Exchange at $59.83
a share. That gave IEP a total of 1.52 million shares, purchased at
a total of $8.37 million since June.
   IEP did not indicate why it was increasing its stake in Cummins,
which earlier this year headed off a potential takeover when
descendants of the company's founder bought out the stake of a
British conglomerate.
   Last Thursday, the Columbus, Ind.-based Cummins announced that
it expects a substantial third-quarter loss because of a sharp drop
in the demand for North American trucks and other reasons.
   The next day, IEP, a Hong Kong-based concern with manufacturing,
restaurant and automobile retailing subsidiaries in the United
States, Britain and France, announced it was pushing its from 11.5
percent to 13.5 percent.

<HEAD>Financial Firm Files for Protection From Creditors</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DALLAS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Lomas Financial Corp. said Monday it filed for
bankruptcy court protection so it can focus on restructuring plans
after negotiations with creditors dragged on for three months.
   ``It was just to the point where time had run out,'' Lomas
spokesman Mike Sitrick said. ``It was really the pressure of the
time that had passed.''
   Lomas sought Chapter 11 protection from creditors filing Sunday
in U.S. Bankruptcy Court in New York. The action freezes payments
on a total of $2.1 billion in debt. It involves only the parent
company and some land developing subsidiaries.
   Lomas is the nation's third-largest mortgage banker with more
than $6 billion in assets and operations.
   Hurt by real estate problems and a slowdown in mortgage lending,
Lomas reported a $56.4 million loss in fiscal 1988 and a $304.5
million loss in the year that ended June 30.
   In June, Lomas announced a major restructuring program that
sought to reduce its outstanding debt by nearly two-thirds, to
about $2 billion from $5.7 billion. The company already had reduced
its total debt by $1.9 billion from the asset sales.
   But as Lomas was implementing its restructuring plan, it also
was trying to negotiate an agreement with senior debt-holders.
   Lomas missed a $145 million payment on senior debt Sept. 1, at
which time creditors could have forced the immediate payment of all
senior debt. Talks had been continuing between Lomas officials and
the creditors.
   ``Despite substantial progress in restructuring our business,
exhaustive negotiations with our lenders over a three-month period
did not produce timely closure or a satisfactory debt
restructure,'' Lomas Chairman and Chief Executive Jess Hay said in
a statement.
   ``As the complex negotiations and disputes among creditors
dragged on, time simply ran out,'' he said.
   Lomas had hoped to settle with the 50 lenders by the end of
July, then the end of August. Hay said it became apparent last week
the firm was ``at least two or three weeks away'' from an agreement
with holders of its senior debt.
   Earlier this month, Lomas said all of its senior creditors
except two banks _ holding 3 percent of the debt _ had agreed to
the restructuring which analysts believed could have forestalled a
bankruptcy court filing.
   Subsidiaries including Lomas' mortgage banking, life insurance
and leasing companies, did not seek bankruptcy protection, the
company said.

   The U.S. dollar plunged on world markets
Monday as the United States and its major allies demonstrated
determination to push the currency's value lower in a bid to solve
America's trade deficit problems.
   The sell-off began in hectic trading in Tokyo and was later
matched in European and New York markets in what traders described
as a rout for the dollar.
   ``The market is shell-shocked,'' said Robert Hatcher, a trader
in the New York office of Barclays Bank PLC. ``The manner in which
the central banks conducted the intervention in the Far East and
Europe today was extremely effective.''
   The dollar began dropping when markets opened in Tokyo with the
decline continuing later in trading in Europe and New York.
   In Tokyo, the dollar lost 1.4 percent of its value, falling to
142.95 yen, compared to a Friday level of 145 yen. Later, in
London, it fell further to 142.69 yen. The slide continued in the
United States, where the dollar skidded to 142.13 yen in New York
trading, down 2.7 percent from Friday's level of 146.05.
   The dollar also lost ground against the West German mark, the
British pound, the French franc and other European currencies.
   Traders reported heavy selling on the part of the centrals banks
of the United States, Japan, West Germany and other major U.S.
allies.
   The well-coordinated moves were timed to back up a blunt
statement expressing displeasure with the dollar's rise in value
this year. The statement was issued late Saturday by finance
officials from the United States, Japan, West Germany, Britian,
France, Canada and Italy.
   The discussions, being held in conjunction with the annual
meetings of the 152-nation International Monetary Fund and its
sister lending organization, the World Bank, were hosted by
Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady and Federal Reserve Chairman Alan
Greenspan.
   The communique expressed fears that the dollar's rise threatened
to abort the improvement in the U.S. trade deficit. A stronger
dollar makes American goods more expensive on overseas markets.
   Finance officials pronounced themselves pleased with the impact
of their efforts Monday and said they stood ready to take further
coordinated efforts if the markets try to push the dollar higher
again.
   French Finance Minister Pierre Beregovoy termed the coordinated
intervention a ``confirmation and illustration'' of the new resolve
on the part of the Group of Seven countries.
   Karl Otto Poehl, president of the West German central bank, said
that Monday's sell-off of dollars by central banks had been
``obviously quite successful.''
   He said ``we will still continue to coordinate with our
American, Japanese and European colleagues in order to achieve the
results we agreed upon in the G-7 meeting.''
   Poehl added to market nervousness with his statement, in
response to a question, that hinted the West German central bank
might be poised to push interest rates higher in view of rapid
growth in that country.
   Many economists said they are looking for Monday's coordinated
dollar selling to be followed later on by coordinated changes in
interest rates to further depress the dollar's value.
   A rise in interest rates in West Germany and Japan would tend to
weaken the dollar because it would boost the rate-of-return on
investments in those countries in relation to dollar-denominated
investments.
   The Bush administration has been putting pressure on the Federal
Reserve to lower interest rates in this country, a move that could
also relieve the upward pressure on the dollar, but economists said
this was less likely to occur given lingering inflation worries at
the Fed.
   Before Saturday's meeting, the dollar had risen by about 20
percent against the Japanese yen and 25 perent against the West
German mark this year. Those rises occurred despite a record level
of dollar selling on the part of the Federal Reserve over the
summer.
   Some economists expressed the belief that the latest round of
intervention could carry more weight, especially if backed up later
by coordinated interest rate moves.
   ``I think it is in the interest of all countries to push the
dollar down,'' said Allen Sinai, chief economist of the Boston Co.
   He said that the Bush administration is worried that weaker
exports could lead to a possible recession in 1990, an election
year, while Bonn and Tokyo are both worried about the need to push
interest rates higher to combat inflation.
   Brady, in a speech Monday before the World Bank-IMF meetings,
called for continued efforts to provide debt relief to more nations
under the so-called Brady plan. He called this approach ``the only
hope for achieving our common goal of extending prosperity
throughout the world.''
   Finance officials from other countries said they still hoped to
achieve agreement for boosting the resources of the IMF before the
end of the year although the United States has made it known that
it was not yet convinced of the need to boost the lending
institution's reserves, known as quotas.
   The IMF and World Bank meetings continue through Thursday with
President Bush scheduled to address the gathering on Wednesday.

<TEXT>
   Celestial Seasonings announced Monday it
will buy Canada's only independent herb-tea manufacturer, Cominso
Inc., in a move to establish a strong presence in the Canadian
herbal-tea market.
   Terms of the deal were not disclosed.
   ``Cominso will accelerate Celestial's commitment to expanding
the herb tea and specialty tea markets in Canada,'' said
Celestial's president and chief executive officer, Barnet M.
Feinblum, in a prepared statement.
   Feinblum said the agreement ``demonstrates Celestial's desire to
establish operational bases in countries of growing importance to
our business.''
   Established in Europe in 1928, Cominso moved to Montreal in 1948
and entered the Canadian market as an importer and marketer of
herbs. In 1981, it began manufacturing herb teas under contract for
other companies, and later became an independent herb tea maker.
   Cominso president Jean B. Hrab said the company's sales account
for about 50 percent of the Canadian herbal tea market, with the
main competition being Lipton Canada, which manufactures its tea in
a factory in Santa Cruz, Calif.
   He said Celestial, the largest specialty tea company in the
United States with more than half the U.S. herb tea market, had not
yet established itself in the Canadian market but would do so now.
   ``Celestial Seasonings' innovation created the herb tea industry
in the United States, and together we expect to dramatically
increase the herb tea industry in Canada,'' Hrab said.
   Hrab said he will continue to oversee operations at Cominso's
plant, which employs about 30 people in Montreal.
   ``We figure we will double our employees because we expect
Celestial to have a very big push in Canada,'' he said.
   Once bought by Kraft, Inc., Celestial regained its independence
Nov. 2 when a management and investor group bought it back.

<TEXT>
   Tokio Marine and Fire Insurance Co., Japan's
oldest property and casualty insurance firm, has agreed to acquire
10 percent of Delaware Management Holdings Inc. for $42 million.
   The transaction, announced Monday, will position both companies
to take advantage of investment advisory opportunities in the
United States and Japan, according to a spokesman for Castle Harlan
Inc., a New York merchant bank that shares ownership of Delaware
Management with company executives.
   Tokio Marine will have a seat on Delaware's board and will send
up to six professionals at any one time to work with the Delaware
staff, learning the company's investment techniques.
   Tokio Marine, formed in 1879, has about 18 percent of the
Japanese property and casualty insurance market in terms of net
premiums written. In fiscal 1988, it reported net income of $704
million on assets of approximately $58 billion.
   Delaware Management Holdings manages $24 billion in assets,
about 75 percent of which is handled through its Delaware
Investment Advisers division for institutions, including
corporations, foundations, universities and charities.

<HEAD>Bill To Keep Foreign Securities Documents Confidential Passes House</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The House on Monday passed legislation
enabling federal securities regulators to maintain the
confidentiality of documents that foreign governments supply to
help U.S. investigators.
   The International Securities Enforcement Cooperation Act cleared
the House on a voice vote with little debate.
   A similar bill was passed by the Senate Banking Committee last
week but has yet to make it onto the Senate floor.
   Under the bill, the Securities and Exchange Commission would be
exempt from certain aspects of the Freedom of Information Act and
would be able to guarantee foreign authorities that documents and
testimony they supply the SEC will be kept confidential, which is
often required under foreign laws.
   The bill is designed to foster international cooperation in the
enforcement of securities laws and securities trading _ and
securities fraud _ across oceans and borders.
   In legislation passed last year, the SEC was given authority to
assist foreign governments in investigating violations of foreign
securities laws.
   But the agency expressed concern that previous negotiations of
bilateral assistance agreements bogged down with the SEC's
inability to assure foreign governments that information would be
kept confidential.

<HEAD>U.S. Holding Up $3 Billion for Poorest Countries</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CARL HARTMAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The United States has refused to promise $3
billion it is expected to contribute to loans for the world's
poorest countries, World Bank President Barber Conable said Monday.
   The money would be the U.S. share of a $14.5 billion fund to be
lent out over three years to about 55 countries where the income of
the average citizen is little more than $1 a day.
   It would be distributed by bank affilaite the International
Development Association in 40-year loans at less than 1 percent
interest a year.
   ``Unfortunately, the United States was not in a position this
past week to advise its IDA partners of its ability to take an
appropriate share of a ... replenishment of this magnitude,''
Conable said.
   He spoke at a closed door meeting of the development committee,
which includes representatives of the World Bank and International
Monetary Fund, now holding their annual meetings in Washington. A
copy of his statement was distributed to reporters.
   The United States also is holding out against a proposal to make
a big increase in the $120 billion now availale for the IMF. French
Finance Minister Pierre Beregovoy said Monday he thought a
compromise eventually would be reached on about $80 billion in new
money.
   About $16 billion of that would come from the United States, but
unlike the IDA contribution, it would not be a charge on the
federal budget.
   IDA's money is replenished every three years. The contributions
now being sought would be lent beginning next July 1.
   Congress is now working on an appropriation of $975 million, the
final U.S. contribution to IDA for the current three-year period.
The United States is the biggest giver among the 34 current donor
countries, providing more than one-fifth of the money.
   Conable held out hope the Bush administration would change its
mind about the IDA contribution at a meeting to be held in Kyoto,
Japan, in November.
   On a proposed new three-year pool of $14.5 billion, Conable
said: ``To most members, agreement on this approximate amount seems
feasible and they have indicated their willingness to take a
reasonable share under the right circumstances.''
   A World Bank official said the United States was the only
holdout. But some other countries will make contributions dependent
on the U.S. share, so if the United States offers a smaller sum
than expected other nations might reduce their contribution.

   The recession many experts once predicted
for next year will not occur until at least late 1991, according to
business economists, who on Monday forecast slower but continued
economic growth through 1990.
   Confidence in the Federal Reserve Board's ``soft-landing''
policy of controlled expansion to limit inflation and unemployment
was a primary reason for the largely favorable report issued by the
National Association of Business Economists.
   ``The Fed is trying to prevent growth from going too fast or too
slow. It seems to be working, and the vast majority of this group
likes this very much,'' said James F. Smith, vice president of the
organization, which is holding its annual meeting here.
   A majority of NABE forecasting experts, 52 percent, expected the
current record peacetime expansion to continue until late 1991 or
beyond. That would surpass the 106-month record set during a period
in the 1960s that included the war in Vietnam.
   Only 9.9 percent expected a recession this year, and only 21
percent predicted an economic slowdown in 1990.
   Association experts also forecast that the growth in the gross
national product, adjusted for inflation, would continue at the
current 2.1 percent annual rate through 1990, then rise to an
average 2.7 a year for the 1989-93 five-year period.
   ``No boom, no bust, more good news than bad,'' was how Smith
characterized the report, which also predicted continued low levels
of inflation and unemployment.
   The NABE's predictions were echoed by Michael Boskin, chairman
of the president's Council of Economic Advisers, who spoke to 400
of the association's members Monday.
   ``We anticipate continued growth for the economy albeit at a
slower rate,'' said Boskin, who predicted a 2.5 percent growth rate
in 1989 that would pick up somewhat in mid-1990.
   ``Our best guess ... is for sustained moderate growth, gradual
reductions in inflation and continued low employment,'' he said.
   The NABE economists predicted 5 percent annual inflation for
this year's October through December quarter and 4.3 percent for
all of 1993. Unemployment, the lowest in 15 years, should average
5.3 percent this year and rise only to 5.7 percent in 1990, the
panel said.
   While economists welcomed slower growth as a way of curbing
inflation, they acknowledged it would be so sluggish for the next
two years that it would feel like a downturn for many industries.
   ``Some parts of the country and some industries ... are going to
feel they're in a recession,'' Smith said.
   Businesses most affected would be producers of consumer goods
because consumers are holding onto their wallets, the NABE said.
Consumer spending, which grew 3.4 percent last year, will grow 2.2
percent this year and 1.9 percent in 1990, economists said.
   ``For a country in which `shop 'til you drop' is almost the
national battle cry, this could easily be viewed as the most
un-American forecast ever issued by the NABE forecast panel,'' the
association report said.
   Meanwhile, consumers are saving more, said the panel, which
expects the savings rate to soar because of continued low
unemployment.
   The NABE also expected the nation's twin trade and budget
deficit to continue their slow decline.
   The economists' median forecast for the trade deficit was $110
billion this year and $100 billion in 1990, compared with $122.8
billion in 1988.
   The survey panel expects a $150 billion budget deficit this year
and $135 billion in 1990, compared with $155.1 billion last year.
The forecast is far from the $100 billion deficit reduction ceiling
mandated for fiscal 1990 by the Gramm-Rudman law.
   Other forecasts in the survey included:
   _Industrial production should grow 3.1 percent this year,
slowing to 1.7 percent in 1990.
   _Construction of new homes and apartments is forecast to average
1.42 million units this year and 1.45 million units in 1990.
   _Car and truck sales are expected to total 15 million this year
before falling to 14.7 million in 1990.

   Coors Brewing Co. said Monday it reached an
agreement in principle on a $425 million buyout of Stroh Brewing
Co., a move analysts said effectively creates a ``Big Three'' group
of dominant U.S. breweries.
   Peter Coors, the brewery's president and chief executive, said
the proposed acquisition of most of Stroh's brewing and container
facilities and brands would strengthen his company's distributor
organization, product quality and brand names.
   ``If we are going to be in the beer business long-term, we've
got to be a major and significant competitor,'' said Coors.
   The purchase price includes cash plus assumption of long-term
debt and certain other liabilities. The transaction is subject to a
definitive agreement and approval by the boards of directors of
both companies and government regulators.
   A combined Coors-Stroh would control about 18.7 percent of the
U.S. beer market _ Stroh now holds 11 percent _ trailing only
Anheuser-Busch Cos. Inc.'s 41 percent share and Miller, which is
owned by Philip Morris Inc., with 21 percent.
   The next biggest afer Coors-Stroh, G. Heileman Brewing Co., has
about a 7 percent market share, according to industry estimates.
   A buyout also would end the independence of 139-year-old Stroh,
a Detroit-based brewery that makes such brands as Stroh's, Stroh
Light, Old Milwaukee and Schlitz.
   Coors brands include Coors and Coors Light; Extra Gold Draft;
Herman Joseph's Original Draft; JH Light; Killian's Red, and
Winterfest. Coors also introduced the Keystone and Keystone Light
bargain brands a month ago and is marketing them on a limited basis.
   Coors Brewing is a unit of Adolph Coors Co. The Coors family
controls 100 percent of Adolph Coors' Class A voting stock and
about a third of its nonvoting, publicly traded Class B stock. The
Class B shares rose $1.50 to $23.75 a share in over-the-counter
trading Monday.
   Coors began expanding from a regional to a national brewer in
the early 1980s and now sells its products in 49 states and
Washington, D.C. Peter Coors said Stroh operations would be
consolidated under Coors Brewing.
   Adolph Coors posted a profit of $12.1 million, or 33 cents a
share, in the first six months of this year, down more than 47
percent from a year earlier. In announcing its earnings in July,
chairman William K. Coors said the beer industry faced stiff price
competition, rising operating costs and flat volume growth.
   For its part, Stroh has had financial problems in the wake of
its move to go national by acquiring Jos. Schlitz Brewing Co. in
1982. Analysts say Stroh, which is privately held and does not
report its earnings, was unable to make inroads on the growth of
industry leader Anheuser Busch.
   Stroh has been looking for potential partners since February and
announced Aug. 31 it had been unsuccessful and was laying off 300
of its 1,500 white-collar employees nationwide.
   Chairman Peter Stroh, great-grandson of the company founder,
issued a statement that his company had neither the size nor the
money to compete with larger publicly held competitors.
   Jay Nelson, of Brown Brothers Harriman in New York, said
combining the two companies means Coors could compete better and
benefit from economies of scale, distribution and purchasing.
   ``You may have more clout all along the line, more bang for the
buck in advertising, and more bang for the buck in general,'' he
said.
   Brands included in the agreement in principle are: Stroh's and
Stroh's Light; Signature; Schlitz, Schlitz Light and Schlitz Malt
Liquor; Schaefer Light, Schaefer non-alcohol and low-alcohol
brands; Old Milwaukee and Old Milwaukee Light; Red Bull; Silver
Thunder, St. Barts, a non-alcohol brand; plus the licensing rights
to Piels, Piels Light and Augsburger.
   Not included were Primo, a beer brewed in Hawaii and distributed
in some West Coast cities, is not included, and Sundance, a wine
cooler. Stroh also bottles other wine coolers and drinks that are
not includedin the sale, said Peter Coors.
   Coors would acquire breweries in St. Paul, Minn.; Tampa, Fla.,
Winston-Salem, N.C.; Longview, Texas; and Allentown, Pa.
   Stroh also has breweries in Memphis, Tenn., and Van Nuys,
Calif., that will not be acquired, Coors said.
   Can plants to be acquired are in Winston-Salem and Longview.
   Coors already makes its own cans and bottles, grows its own malt
and makes ceramics at plants in the United States and three other
countries.
   Coors also said his company had been in contact with the
Teamsters Union, but declined to predict whether the buyout would
affect the union. The Teamsters which represents Stroh plant
workers but was rejected by Coors workers as a potential
representative in December 1988.

<HEAD>Court Sends `Twiggy' Back for Trial, Lets `Lisa' Go</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SAN FRANCISCO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A federal appeals court ruled Monday that
Apple Computer Inc. and its top officers must go to trial on the
question of whether its optimistic statements about a novel new
office computer disc-drive dubbed ``Twiggy'' misled investors.
   The Cupertino-based company was sued by a group of investors
claiming fraud in connection with the promotion of a computer
called ``Lisa'' and a compatible disc-drive, ``Twiggy,'' in 1982
and 1983. Both proved commercially unsuccessful and Apple replaced
Twiggy with another system before beginning actual sales of Lisa,
which later was discontinued.
   The investors contend they bought Apple stock at an artificially
high price based on Apple's misrepresentations. They said they
suffered severely when the products failed and Apple stock plunged
75 percent.
   The 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled 3-0 that unlike
information about the market risks of Lisa, problems linked to
Twiggy ``were not made known to the market by the press or by
anyone else,'' although internal tests indicated the mechanism's
information processing ability was slow and unreliable.
   Appeals Judge Jerome Farris said the appeals court couldn't
determine if Apple's ``failure to disclose Twiggy's technical
problems had no misleading effect on market price.'' So the court
said the matter should be decided by a lower court jury.
   The court said that ``any overall impression created by Apple's
optimism was adequately counterbalanced by the press' documentation
of Lisa's risks.''
   It upheld a grant of summary judgment to Apple involving the
Lisa lawsuit.
   Apple spokeswoman Carleen LeVassur said company officials were
pleased by the ruling, which she called a ``very significant
decision'' that shows Apple acted properly in promoting the
products and did not violate any securities laws.
   As far as Twiggy, LeVassur said authorities are confident the
matter will be resolved in Apple's favor.
   Lisa, designed for medium- to large-sized corporations, had
several technological innovations that proved commercially viable
when incorporated into Apple's Macintosh computer.
   Lisa pioneered use of the ``mouse,'' a hand-held device that
allows communication with the computer without using the keyboard,
and ``icons,'' graphic displays of the computer's functions.

<HEAD>Report: AT&amp;T To Provide Advanced Phone Services Using British Link</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   American Telephone and Telegraph Co. is set to
move into the market for advanced telecommunication services, such
as electronic mail and trading, via a tie-up with Istel of the
United Kingdom, according to a published report.
   A link with Istel would enable AT&amp;T to establish itself in
markets from which it was excluded until earlier this year by U.S.
antitrust regulations, the Financial Times reported in its Tuesday
editions.
   Istel would be a platform from which AT&amp;T could launch an
assault on the European advanced telephone services market, due to
be liberalized under plans to eliminate the trade barriers among
European Community nations by 1992.
   AT&amp;T is the biggest operator of long-distance and international
telephone lines in the United States and the world's largest maker
of telecommunications equipment.
   Since AT&amp;T company was broken up in 1984 under an antitrust
case, it has been searching for opportunities to expand overseas.
   Although its initial efforts had little success, it reached
agreement earlier this year to take a minority state in Italtel,
Italy's largest telephone equipment manufacturer.
   Istel, which was sold to its employees by the Rover car group
three years ago for the equivalent of $53 million, is now worth
about $272 million. A deal with AT&amp;T could turn several of its
senior managers into multimillionaires, the Financial Times
reported.
   Details of the plans are expected to be announced later Tuesday
in London.
