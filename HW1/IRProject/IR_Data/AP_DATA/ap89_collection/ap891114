   About 24,000 U.S. military
personnel will take part in joint military exercises in Honduras
during the coming year, U.S. Embassy spokesman Mark Jacobs said
Tuesday.
   He said that during the U.S. fiscal year 1989-1990, which
started Oct. 1, U.S. and Honduran troops would participate in at
least three joint training programs.
   Jacobs did not give any specific dates or time periods for the
maneuvers. In the past, the embassy usually released more detailed
plans for the exercises about a week in advance.
   Some 25,000 U.S. military personnel took part in two, six-month
training programs in Honduras in 1988-89. Military exercises
involving thousands of American troopers and Honduran forces have
been held frequently since 1982.
   The United States has some 1,200 military personnel based at the
Enrique Soto Cano air base, 37 miles northwest of Tegucigalpa, the
capital.

<TEXT>
   Former West German Chancellor Willy
Brandt said Monday he hopes some of the crumbling Berlin Wall will
stand permanently, not as a barrier but as a reminder of the Cold
War.
   ``A part of it should be allowed to remain standing, to serve as
something of a museum,'' said Brandt, who was mayor of West Berlin
when the wall was erected in 1961.
   East German officials have opened new passages through the wall
but have made it clear they will leave much of it standing for now
to continue marking the line between East Berlin and West Berlin.
   Brandt, 75, said he was deeply moved when he visited Berlin over
the weekend and watched people freely moving through _ and over _
the wall.
   He said he would never forget how, for the first time, he saw
East German border guards smiling at East German residents as they
passed through border control points.
   ``They were so friendly. And the (East) Berliners who came back
called over to the police _ `Hey look, we're back!'''
   Even though Brandt is from the northern city of Luebeck, there
are few politicians in West Germany whose personal histories are so
closely linked with the Berlin Wall.
   He rose to world prominence in 1961 when Communist East Germany
constructed the wall, which became the scene of dozens of fatal
escape attempts. Angered by the wall's deadly threat to East
Berliners, Brandt immediately condemned the structure as a human
rights violation.
   In an interview shown Monday night on the Macneil-Lehrer
NewsHour broadcast in New York, Brandt was reminded of his anger in
1961 when the three Western Allies _ America, Britain and France _
did nothing to tear the wall down and he was asked if President
John F. Kennedy was right not to take action.
   ``I never asked President Kennedy to take military action,''
Brandt said. ``What I was angry about at the time ... was that
there had been so much talk about the four-power responsibility
(the Western Allies and Soviet Union) for Berlin as a whole and
when it came to a critical point, we had to acknowledge that
four-power responsibility had to be reduced to a three-party
responsibility for Western Berlin.
   ``I was happy that we could count on that protection _
responsibility and protection. No, I think looking back at it, it
was the right thing not to take the kind of military action which
could have brought us into a new World War.''
   Brandt said he thinks West Germany should not intervene in what
is happening in East Germany but be ready to offer its help.
   ``Leave it to people in the other part of Germany to find their
proper answers to their problems, but be as helpful as possible,
especially in the field of economic cooperation,'' he said.

   A hotel executive's husband was arrested Monday
and accused of bludgeoning her to death on her 44th birthday with
unopened wine bottles in their luxury apartment.
   ``This was a domestic dispute that escalated into a violent
confrontation,'' said police Deputy Inspector Robert Frankel.
   Allen Cole, 45, was charged with second-degree murder early
Monday, a day after police went to the couple's apartment in lower
Manhattan and found the battered body of his wife, Sharyn, 44, said
Frankel.
   The couple had been married 17 years. Mrs. Cole, a personnel
director with Hilton International, had turned 44 Sunday, the day
she was slain, Frankel said.
   ``There was a lot of blood,'' said detective Sgt. Edward Norris.
``She was very badly beaten.''
   Investigators believe Mrs. Cole was bludgeoned to death with up
to five unopened wine bottles, which were found shattered near her
body.
   ``A wooden meat tenderizer, like a mallet, was found near the
body,'' Frankel added.
   The argument between the couple apparently escalated Sunday
afternoon, when neighbors heard screams coming from the apartment
in Battery Park City near the financial district.
   After the killing, Cole, covered with blood, left the apartment
and stood in the hallway shouting for help, Frankel said. Police
responding to neighbors calls arrived at the apartment.
   The distraught husband, a self-employed food and beverage
consultant, had scratch marks on his face and hands.
   Cole was restrained by police. ``He was visibly upset,'' Frankel
said. ``He didn't want to leave the body.''

   ``Ach, the stinking fumes from those terrible
one-lung wrecks! Who would have thought pollution was the smell of
freedom?''
   With that, cabbie Augustin Vogel left the wheel of his
Mercedes-Benz taxi and helped a laughing, cheering crowd of West
Berliners push another backfiring ``Trabbi,'' the East German
two-cylinder car, through the newly opened hole in the Berlin Wall
at Potsdamer Platz.
   Two blue-bereted French soldiers amused the crowd and shocked
the children peering out the streaky windows of the stalled car by
chipping away at the Wall with hammers and chisels.
   The big weekend shopping spree that saw 3 million East Germans
live the fantasies that tantalized them for years on western TV had
slowed from a torrent to a steady gush, but every daylight hour was
still rush hour on the streets of West Berlin.
   You had to wait in line to get into Woolworth's on Tauentzien
Strasse, but on the opposite side of Checkpoint Charlie sales girls
looked out the windows of empty boutiques with names like ``Lotus''
and ``Panda'' along Leipziger Strasse, East Berlin's fashion avenue.
   Shoppers hurried through the chilling fog with baby carriages,
shopping carts and rucksacks crammed with free world goodies.
   Even a sale on the eastern side _ ``stark reduziert'' _ of
snuggie wool damen slips, ladies' almost knee-length panties from
China, at 4 marks and Russian-made Strumpf Hose, at 14 marks,
failed to stem the exodus to the big mall over the Wall.
   A surpising consensus of sidewalk opinion along the
Kurfuerstendamm, West Berlin's Fifth Avenue, blamed the fog on the
fume-spewing Trabants and the slightly larger Wartburgs.
   ``Still it's a miracle to see all those DDR plates,'' enthused
refrigeration repairman Otto Esser, who played hookey from work to
spend his third day watching the flow of traffic through the Wall.
   ``This has been the happiest time of my life. I was two years
old when the Wall went up. I'm taking pictures for my infant son,
who hopefully won't even have the Wall, as a memory.''
   ``Oranges, bananas and coffee, that's what the Easties mainly
buy with the 100 marks handed out free to them by the banks,''
reported Helga Rosmunsen, a beautician who also called in sick to
spend another day watching the ceaseless flow of humanity along a
dust-beaten thoroughfare that only a week ago had been a death
strip.
   ``Even on a crowded downtown street you can tell an East from a
West Berliner by the happiness in their eyes. No wonder. Have you
ever tried to get real coffee over there?''
   Absenteeism was only a minor problem as another work week began
in East Berlin, but the weekend of wonders glowed brighter than the
few Christmas tree lights looming faintly in the fog.
   The Volkskammer, the Communist-dominated parliament, was
electing a new prime minister in the old town hall up by the
Brandenburg Gate, but at a Bierstube just a few blocks away
blue-collar beer drinkers switched off the government television
news to see if the Western channels were reporting any new holes in
the Schandmauer, the wall of shame.
   Meanwhile, on the other side of the Brandenburg Gate, now
sheared of its barbed wire curls, a procession of famous Western TV
anchors from several dozen countries waited their turn to do
stand-ups in the floodlit splendor of this landmark rubbled arch.
   Even at the Museum at Checkpoint Charlie _ with its bizarre
collection of motorbikes, battered buses, homemade submarines and
hot-air balloons that had confounded East Berlin's wall guards,
patrol dogs and mine fields _ NBC's Tom Brokaw and crew had to line
up for an interview with the curators.
   At the CSSR Kultur und Informationszentrum just a few hundred
yards to the east, there was no wait for interviews and no culture
customers either, despite a display of children's patriotic poster
art.
   ``The Easties will be back in even larger numbers this
weekend,'' predicted postcard vendor Axel Gruber at the Potsdamer
hole in the wall.
   ``This time it won't be for just shopping. They'll want to see
our famous zoo and the Rembrandts and the Head of Queen Nefertiti
in the Dahlem Museum. They know free Berlin has more to offer than
blue jeans and cassettes of the British rock group Exodus.''

<HEAD>There's No Reward for Being a Whistleblower, Senate Panel Told</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DONNA CASSATA</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The federal government should reward _ not
punish _ workers who blow the whistle on fraud, say employees in
telling a Senate subcommittee how they were thwarted in efforts to
expose abuse.
   ``There's no reward for being a whistleblower,'' complained a
Defense Department worker in Pittsburgh who went public with
allegations about a Western Pennsylvania defense contractor.
   Nancy Kusen said Monday that the government saved $3.3 million
on a contract when she brought allegations of fraud to their
attention, but all she got in return were two lines of commendation.
   ``When someone finds a wallet, they get a reward,'' she told the
Senate Governmental Affairs subcommittee on general services,
federalism and the District of Columbia, which held a hearing into
the inspectors general fraud hotlines.
   The 16-year federal employee described for the committee her
nearly five-year effort to persuade the Defense Department to
investigate pricing irregularities by the Elliott Co., then a
subsidiary of United Technologies Corp.
   Twenty-six letters to the Defense Department hotline describing
contract problems, including some with audit reports, progress
payment records and copies of contracts, produced little action,
Kusen said. Finally, she took her information to The Pittsburgh
Press.
   After a series of articles in the newspaper, the U.S. Navy Price
Fighter Detachment conducted its own inquiry. The Detachment found
that on an order for 26 rotor assemblies, Elliott Co. charged
$6,613.49 for items that should have been $1,485.89, Ms. Kusen said.
   Federal employees fear retaliation for reporting waste and
abuse, said the Pittsburgh worker who said she would never use the
hotline again.
   Phillip T. Doe, an employee with the Bureau of Land Reclamation
who blew the whistle on a land scandal, said he never considered
the inspectors general hotline.
   ``Friends ... said the reaction would be one of damage
control,'' Doe told the committee.
   William M. Diefenderfer, deputy director of the Office of
Management and Budget and chairman of the President's Council on
Integrity and Efficiency, said the testimony was ``the most
demoralizing thing I've heard.''
   But he said he did not think ``it is that bad,'' and suggested
an increase in congressional oversightof the day-to-day operations
of the inspectors general hotline.
   Dina Rasor, director of the Project on Military Procurement
which recently released a 52-page survival guide for the
whistleblower, said one problem with the system is that
confidential complaints to the hotline, after proceeding through
the investigative channels, usually end up on the desk of the
whistleblower's boss, and ``it doesn't take long to find out who
the employee is.''
   The other problem is that investigators rarely work with the
whistleblower on their inquiries. ``They go through a stack of
documents without understanding the problem,'' Ms. Rasor said.
   ``I've never known a whistleblower to be successful with the
hotline,'' said Rasor, who has spent nine years investigating the
military.
   The General Accounting Office, the investigative arm of
Congress, said their study of the hotline system found that some
telephone hotline numbers were not listed and others did not have
an 800-number, like the Department of Housing and Urban Development.
   Overall, the GAO said the hotlines ``can be useful in receiving
calls and complaints.''

<HEAD>Wilder Urges Democrats to Embrace Mainstream Values</HEAD>

   L. Douglas Wilder, the first black to be
elected governor of any state, says the Democratic Party should
follow his example in Virginia by offering a moderate,
``mainstream'' message in presidential elections.
   ``In presidential elections it is time for the Democratic Party
to take a plunge into the waters of America's new mainstream,''
Wilder told a gathering of party leaders Monday.
   ``There was a time when Democrats were elected by campaigning
against big government and high taxes,'' he said. ``But for too
long, we have let the other party take these issues away from us _
indeed, we have allowed them to hammer us with these issues.''
   Wilder, Virginia's lieutenant governor, spoke to the Democratic
Leadership Council, a group of conservative and moderate Democrats
formed in 1985 to counteract liberals who have dominated the
party's presidential nominating process.
   The group has tried to steer the party toward the right, and
Wilder has bickered publicly with the group and some of its leaders
in the past.
   After taking office in 1986, Wilder criticized the council as
exclusionary and divisive, and he charged it was trying to weaken
the influence of the party's basic constituency groups, including
blacks.
   Noting those past differences, Wilder said: ``I will not look
back. We will look for forward. We will be there together.''
   Wilder said his campaign was successful because it appealed to
mainstream values. To regain the White House, Democrats must
identify with the nation's concerns about crime and drugs, jobs,
the environment, education and the desire ``to hold the line on
taxes,'' he said.
   Although his candidacy was closely watched by black leaders,
Wilder deliberately kept liberal two-time presidential candidate
Jesse Jackson at arm's length and did not invite Jackson to
campaign for him.
   ``Mainstream values are the values of the overwhelming majority
of the people of this country,'' Wilder said. ``It's time our party
began focusing on such values at the national level.''
   Wilder, whose razor-thin victory is subject to a recount
requested by his Republican opponent, campaigned as a moderate in
the tradition of his two predecessors, Gov. Gerald Baliles and Sen.
Charles Robb, a former governor and president of the DLC.
   Wilder's call on the party to embrace mainstream values as the
key to regaining the White House used a common buzz-word for the
council. Robb, in a morning address to the group, used the word
``mainstream'' no fewer than 21 times, and the inaugural issue of
the group's new magazine was distributed bearing the title ``The
Mainstream Democrat.''
   ``Stand pat with liberal fundamentalism, or build a new agenda
on mainstream values _ that is the choice,'' Robb said.
   Speaking to reporters later, Wilder lavished praise on the
council but stopped short of saying he would join. The party's
other top elected black, House Majority Whip William Gray of
Pennsylvania, is a co-chairman of the council and has urged Wilder
to join.
   Arkansas Gov. Bill Clinton praised Wilder before the group,
saying, ``He will change the course of American politics, not
because he is black, but because of what as a black American he
will do.''

   A woman whose marriage had recently
broken up apparently slashed the throats of her three sons with a
pocketknife and then took her own life, police said.
   The woman's mother, who had talked with her daughter about her
problems late into the night Sunday, found the bodies Monday
morning in this Baltimore suburb, police said.
   The body of Diane Ellen Warwick, 36, was found in a bathtub with
both wrists slashed, and a Swiss army knife was found nearby, said
police Cpl. Steve Doarnberger.
   The bodies of her sons, Geoffrey Warwick Jr., 5; Joshua, 4; and
Daniel, 3; were found in bedrooms, their throats cut, he said.
   The two younger boys apparently were killed while they slept,
but Geoffrey Jr. had wounds on his hands, suggesting that he had
tried to ward off the attack, police said.
   The case was classified a murder-suicide, police spokesman Jay
Miller said.
   Mrs. Warwick had been staying with her parents after separating
from her husband of 13 years. She recently had been under medical
supervision for depression, Miller said.

<TEXT>
   Despite prodding from Democrats, President
Bush is reacting cautiously to democratic reform in East Germany,
saluting the developments as momentous and irreversible while
trying to avoid any appearance of gloating.
   It is a balancing act, intended to lend support and
encouragement to the march toward freedom while guarding against
doing anything that might provoke a crackdown in East Germany or
slow the dramatic pace of reform.
   ``We are handling it in a way where we are not trying to give
anybody a hard time,'' Bush said last week. He said he was
responding in ``a rather measured way'' that was designed to
encourage change and ``hopefully not contribute to an unforeseen
disorder.''
   Now, two well-placed U.S. officials say Bush is considering a
meeting with NATO leaders in Brussels after his summit next month
with Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev. The aim of such a meeting
would be to show Western unity on the future of Germany and to
discuss new political and military strategy in light of the changes
in Eastern and Central Europe.
   Bush's initial approach to the opening of East Germany's borders
was so low-keyed that Bush felt obliged to explain: ``I am not an
emotional kind of guy. I'm very pleased.''
   Questioned Monday about Bush's restrained reaction, White House
press secretary Marlin Fitzwater said, ``I urge you not to mistake
that for the personal enthusiasm for the freedom and the extension
of values that are now going to the East German people.''
   An administration official, discussing Bush's approach, said,
``Things are going so well in Eastern Europe, why screw them up''
by saying something provocative. ``We don't need to say, `We won,
they lost.'''
   Democrats have been attacking Bush all year as too timid and
hesitant about changes in the Soviet Union and across Eastern
Europe, and they unveiled a new volley Monday.
   ``Even as the walls of the modern Jericho come tumbling down, we
have a president who is inadequate to the moment,'' said House
Democratic Leader Richard A. Gephardt.
   ``The changes taking place in Europe should galvanize our
president into action,'' Gephardt said. ``But at the very time
freedom and democracy are receiving standing ovations in Europe,
our president is sitting politely in the audience with little to
say and even less to contribute.''
   Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell urged Bush to go to
Berlin to hail ``the figurative and literal destruction of the
Berlin Wall.''
   He also said Bush should swiftly suspend trade barriers against
the Soviet Union and grant Moscow observer status at international
economic institutions.
   Fitzwater said it was ``extremely unlikely'' that Bush would go
to Berlin.
   ``It's our feeling that there are any number of policy reasons
why that is probably not the right thing to do at this time.''
   While cheering the developments in Eastern Europe, the
administration acknowledges it has been surprised by the pace of
change and is uncertain where events will lead.
   Preparing for his summit with Gorbachev on Dec. 2 and 3, Bush
met Monday with a panel of academic and government experts on the
Soviet Union. The meeting focused on military developments in the
Soviet Union. Earlier sessions were devoted to the Kremlin's
economic problems.
   Fitzwater said the changes in Eastern Europe, particularly in
East Germany, are putting a new focus on the summit.
   ``Certainly, the exodus from East Germany and the taking down of
the Berlin Wall, in terms of people's ability to move across the
borders, adds a new sense of urgency and a new dimension to that
whole discussion,'' the spokesman said.
   He said Bush would not be accompanied to the summit by a large
number of arms control specialists, but that the talks should
``give a push'' to negotiations to reduce strategic nuclear arms
and conventional weapons.
   Meanwhile, Bush turned up the rhetorical heat on developments in
Eastern Europe during an emotional ceremony Monday welcoming
Solidarity leader Lech Walesa to the White House.
   ``The iron curtain is fast becoming a rusted, abandoned relic,
symbolizing a lost era and a failed ideology,'' Bush said.
   ``The change is everywhere,'' the president said. ``Poland,
Hungary, Czechoslovakia. And ladies and gentlemen, the week that
brought Lech Walesa to America, is the week the headlines
proclaimed, `And the Wall Comes Tumbling Down.'''

<TEXT>
   Democratic senators from five states that have
federal nuclear weapons facilities want President Bush to withdraw
his nomination of Victor Stello Jr. to head weapons production,
saying he's unqualified for the sensitive post.
   In a letter made public Monday, the senators said the poor
condition of the nation's 12-state nuclear weapons complex makes it
crucial that Bush find someone of undisputed credentials for the
job of assistant secretary for defense programs.
   ``Unfortunately, based upon his record of circumventing health
and safety regulations and obstructing investigations while at the
Nuclear Regulatory Commission, we strongly believe that Mr. Stello
is not the proper candidate for this responsibility and that the
Senate should reject his confirmation,'' the letter said.
   Stello's confirmation hearing is scheduled for Wednesday in the
Senate Armed Services Committee. His nomination was announced July
24 by the White House.
   The letter opposing the nomination was signed by Sens. Richard
Bryan of Nevada, Howard Metzenbaum of Ohio, Alan Cranston of
California, Tim Wirth of Colorado and Brock Adams of Washington
state.
   Wirth is on the Armed Services Committee, the four others are
not.
   Wirth is the only member of the committee to openly oppose
Stello's nomination, so it is not clear how other members might
vote.
   Stello's critics contend he is poorly suited to ensure health
and safety at the nuclear weapons plants, but Energy Department
officials contend his broad experience in commercial nuclear power
regulation makes him a good choice.
   Henson Moore, the deputy energy secretary, said the senators'
letter was ``not news'' to him because the five already had
informed the department of their opposition to Stello. He said he
knew of ``one or two'' other Senate opponents but added, ``we think
the votes are there'' to gain full Senate approval this month.
   Stello has been working as a special assistant to Energy
Secretary James D. Watkins since July.
   The weapons complex, including 17 major plants and laboratories
in 12 states, is beset by mechanical, safety, environmental and
management problems that Watkins has said must be corrected soon to
assure the nation's nuclear defense.
   Stello had been chief of staff at the Nuclear Regulatory
Commission since 1986, ranking directly under the five commission
members. The NRC regulates commercial nuclear power.
   In a move interpreted by some as a sign that Watkins may doubt
Stello's chances of winning Senate confirmation in the current
session of the Congress, Watkins late last month told one of his
top aides to temporarily take charge of the weapons office.

   Margaret Thatcher, who only six months ago looked
unassailable, is suddenly looking vulnerable and defensive.
   An economic slump, culminating in the Oct. 26 resignation of her
treasury chief, has confronted her with possibly the worst crisis
of her decade in office.
   The combative determination that wrought a revolution is looking
more like authoritarianism _ a trait she may have exercised once
too often in forcing the resignation of Chancellor of the Exchequer
Nigel Lawson.
   And for the first time, she has given Britons a glimpse of a
future without her all-embracing presence, saying she is likely to
step down sometime after the next election, which must be held by
mid-1992.
   ``I think people would think it was time for someone else to
carry the torch,'' she told the Sunday Correspondent newspaper.
   At 64, midway through a third five-year term, her comment
shouldn't have been all that surprising. The fact that it triggered
a furor is testimony to the profound impact she has had on British
life.
   Her supporters insist that Mrs. Thatcher will triumph, that she
thrives on adversity as she showed in waging war for the Falkland
Islands, facing down Northern Ireland's militants and, most
recently, at last month's Commonwealth conference resisting a
united front seeking tougher sanctions for South Africa.
   ``In a country where every other politician seems to change
postures every opinion-poll time, Thatcher _ irritating as she
frequently is _ does not do that,'' wrote Norman MacRae in The
Sunday Times.
   Says Mrs. Thatcher: ``A leader must lead firmly ... How can I
change Margaret Thatcher? I am what I am.''
   But her admission of political mortality is likely to intensify
the war of succession that began to stir last month at her
Conservative Party's annual convention.
   Contenders such as former Defense Secretary Michael Heseltine
and Deputy Prime Minister Sir Geoffrey Howe were already sending
out veiled challenges.
   With inflation above 7 percent, interest rates at an eight-year
high of 15 percent and the trade deficit hitting new records, the
gloss had gone off the Thatcherite boom and the opposition Labor
Party was averaging a 10-point lead in opinion polls.
   Then came Lawson's bombshell, depriving Mrs. Thatcher of the man
she herself had credited with turning Britain's economic fortunes
around. Thus her interview, published Nov. 5, became something of a
starter's pistol in the race to succeed her.
   Lawson said he resigned because Mrs. Thatcher ignored his
ultimatum to sack Sir Alan Walters, her part-time economic adviser,
whom Lawson accused of undermining his policies.
   His resignation forced a shuffle in which the three senior
ministries changed hands. In the view of many commentators, it gave
the 22-member Cabinet more power over Mrs. Thatcher, if only
because she can't afford to lose another senior minister.
   ``...The world has changed for her. Changed utterly ... the fear
has gone out of those formerly timid men who surrounded her Cabinet
table,'' commented the pro-Thatcher Daily Express.
   At the heart of the crisis are two issues: Mrs. Thatcher's
personal style and Britain's place in Europe _ the political issue
set to dominate the British political agenda in the 1990s.
   The style issue is an old one: Mrs. Thatcher as the nanny-prime
minister, convinced she alone is right; Mrs. Thatcher the hectoring
bully; Mrs. Thatcher the crusading free-marketeer, whose hatred of
socialism leads her to savage everything from organized labor to
the cherished National Health Service; Mrs. Thatcher the
handbagger, a term drawn from the popular caricature of an Iron
Lady who slaps down critics with her handbag.
   The Lawson dispute was, on the face of it, about whether Britain
should join the currency-stabilizing exchange rate mechanism of the
European Monetary System, which links nine of the 12-nation EEC's
currencies.
   Lawson, who had already been trying to steady the economy by
tying the pound to the powerful West German mark, wanted to join as
soon as possible.
   Mrs. Thatcher, under pressure, has agreed in principle to join
under strict conditions. But she sounds unenthusiastic and Walters
called the European Monetary System a ``half-baked'' idea.
   Many observers believe her attitude is symptomatic of an island
nation's ``persistently ambiguous attitude toward European
integration,'' as commentator Robert Mauthner put it in The
Financial Times.
   Mrs. Thatcher's foreign policy has swum along on her warm
relationship with former President Reagan and Soviet leader Mikhail
S. Gorbachev, allowing her to project Britain as a world power.
   But President Bush seems more interested in the Continent than
its islands, and West Germany is far better placed than Britain to
meet the economic challenge of a transformed Soviet bloc.
   Meanwhile, the Thatcher Euro-bashing of the 1980s, caricatured
as the Britain-vs.-foreigners approach, has given way to worries
Mrs. Thatcher will miss the boat and end up marginalized in both
Europe and Washington.
   `Two years ago she was arguably the most respected statesperson
in the world,'' said Michael Dobbs, a former senior Conservative
Party official. ``Yet in just a few months her simply unrestrained
enjoyment of a good punch-up has left her virtually friendless on
the diplomatic scene.''
   A Harris poll for the BBC in October showed 62 percent
disapproval of Mrs. Thatcher's attitude toward Britain's European
allies.
   ``The poison is at the heart of this government in that its
leader is unable to command the support of the best men in
Conservative politics,'' commented Hugo Young, a Thatcher
biographer and columnist in London's liberal Guardian newspaper.
   Europe has shaken the government before. In 1986, a battle was
waged in the Cabinet over whether to sell an ailing British
helicopter company to an American company or a European consortium.
Heseltine, who favored the European option, lost out and resigned.
He is now Mrs. Thatcher's likeliest successor.
   Europe is heading toward greater unity, bringing the corporate,
mildly socialist doctrines prevalent on the Continent into growing
confrontation with the robust individualism espoused by the
Thatcherites. So for British politics, Europe looks like a drama
that will run and run.

<HEAD>DeConcini Warns About Buying More Radar Planes Until Problems Solved</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LARRY MARGASAK</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The chairman of a Senate appropriations panel
is warning the U.S. Customs Service not to sign a contract for a
third sophisticated radar plane until electronics problems are
resolved in two existing aircraft that detect drug-smuggling
flights.
   ``I'm very interested, being the chairman of the funding
committee, in not letting a new contract when we don't have one
that works,'' Sen. Dennis DeConcini said Monday, demanding
corrections in the computerized electronics in the Lockheed P-3
airborne early warning aircraft.
   The Arizona Democrat, who heads the Senate Appropriations
subcommittee on Treasury, Postal Service and General Government, is
urging that the problems be fixed by March, a month before the
Customs Service is scheduled to sign a contract with Lockheed
Aeronautical Systems Co. for its third flying radar platform.
   ``They have to tell us it will be corrected by March. If they
don't fix it, I'm going to come down on them hard,'' DeConcini
said. ``If they don't adhere to the suggestion I'll have a hearing
and it won't be pleasant.''
   Customs Service documents _ and sources _ show that the aircraft
have experienced trouble pinpointing the location of targets and
following their course and speed; faulty on-board communications
for the crew; and problems with a spinning, metal radar dome.
   Most documents were written by crewmen at the Customs Service
Surveillance Support Center in Corpus Christi, Texas, where the
agency has based the P-3 AEW's, the frontline equipment in
detection of airborne drug smugglers.
   In the House, meanwhile, Rep. Glenn English, D-Okla., a member
of the House Government Operations Committee, said he expected
committee Chairman John Conyers, D-Mich., to ask the General
Accounting Office to investigate problems with the P-3 AEW program.
   Peter Kendig, acting director of the Customs Service
surveillance center, has acknowledged there are a ``few glitches''
in the computer systems, but said the aircraft ``works and it works
great.''
   He said the two planes now flying were mainly responsible for
detections leading to 36 arrests from Jan. 1 to Aug. 10, seizures
of 37,000 pounds of marijuana and 8,300 pounds of cocaine as well
as vessels, aircraft and vehicles.
   Lockheed's airborne early warning program manager, John
McGinnis, has said he hopes ``anomalous behavior'' in the tracker
will be fixed by ``the first of the year.''
   ``The airplane and the tracker are very capable and doing their
job'' despite the discrepancies, McGinnis said.
   The first P-3 airborne early warning aircraft was delivered in
June 1988 at a cost of more than $27 million, and the second
arrived in April at a price of $30.6 million. The third plane will
cost $35 million, money already appropriated by Congress.
   The Lockheed P-3 is a four-engine turboprop built to detect
enemy submarines, but two airframes were outfitted with the most
sophisticated electronics available and sold to the Customs Service
to detect airborne drug smugglers.
   The major electronics problem documented in Customs Service
memos _ and in interviews with agency sources _ is the computerized
tracker.
   The equipment is designed to automatically plot the course and
speed of a suspect aircraft, but is sometimes so inaccurate that
the P-3 cannot reliably guide interceptors to the suspected
smugglers, the sources and documents said.

   A murder suspect being driven on a busy highway
to a city jail Monday pulled out a gun and fired from the back seat
at two detectives, killing them both, authorities said.
   The convict, identified as Stoney Harrison, 25, ran from the
scene, according to Police Commissioner Richard Condon.
   Around midnight, about 10 hours later, police brought in for
questioning a man believed to be Harrison, who was found in a home
in the borough of Brooklyn, said police Sgt. Pete Berry.
   Killed were Detectives Keith L. Williams, 34, of New York City
and Richard J. Guerzon, 46, of Merrick, said Sgt. Raymond
O'Donnell, a police spokesman.
   The shooting, the first to claim the lives of two city police
officers in more than 11 years, occurred on the Grand Central
Parkway in the borough of Queens, near LaGuardia Airport.
   The detectives had driven Harrison from the city's Rikers Island
jail to the Queens district attorney's office earlier in the day to
take a lie detector test and discuss a plea bargain, police said.
He was being taken back to Rikers in one of the detectives'
personal cars when the shooting occurred.
   Condon said both officers carried pistols in ankle holsters, but
neither had been fired. The weapon with which they were shot was
not recovered, and Condon said it was unclear where Harrison got a
gun.
   The seating of detectives and inmate _ them in front, him alone
in back _ violated procedure, Condon said. Police said it was not
against police guidelines to transport prisoners in personal cars.
   Harrison was handcuffed when he was in the car, but was not when
he fled, according to witnesses. A pair of cuffs was found in the
front seat.
   Police said it appeared the car pulled over to the side of the
highway before shots were fired. Both detectives appeared to have
been shot once in the back of the head.
   Police said Harrison, a resident of Queens, has an extensive
criminal record dating to 1984, including drug and assault charges.
In 1985, he was sentenced to 364 days in jail for biting off a
girlfriend's ear.
   He was arrested in July for allegedly strangling another
girlfriend after a night of partying and drug-taking. In October,
he and his mother were arrested for conspiring to murder a witness
against him in the July slaying. He allegedly had his mother offer
$2,000 to a hit man who turned out to be an undercover detective.
   Port Authority Police Officer Robert Schaefer said three men
were arrested near the airport shortly after Monday's shooting, but
each was released.
   An hour after the shooting the detectives' bodies, in white
bags, were on grass near the parkway. The sedan they were driving
was parked nearby. There were bullet holes in the windshield, and
the wipers were on.
   Another car, its front end smashed, also sat in the road. Police
Capt. Stephen Davis said the driver of the second car was not
involved in the shooting. Westbound traffic on the parkway was
limited to one lane.
   Officer Hugh Mulvey, the first officer on the scene, said he
found ``one police officer face down on the ground and the other
officer on the passenger seat shot and killed.''
   At least seven witnesses were being interviewed.
   ``It was a pretty bloody scene,'' Schaefer said. Asked where the
officers had been shot, he said, ``There was so much blood it was
hard to tell.''
   The officers were members of the Queens district attorney's
detective squad, Schaefer said.
   Williams, who leaves behind a wife and a daughter, was appointed
to the Police Department in 1981 and earned two police awards.
Guerzon, who had a wife and two children, was appointed in 1969 and
earned 13 awards, O'Donnell said.
   Rewards totaling $40,000 were offered for information leading to
the officers' killers: $10,000 from a group of city businessman
called COPSHOT; $10,000 from the city; and $20,000 from the
Detectives Endowment Association, which represents detectives.
   The last time two police officers were killed in the same
incident was April 2, 1978. Officers Norman Cerullo and Christie
Masone were killed in a gunfight with two occupants of a car they
stopped in Brooklyn.
   The officers shot Monday became the fourth and fifth ones killed
in the line of duty this year. Fourteen others have been wounded.

<HEAD>Economists Predict Interest Rates Will Continue Falling</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARTIN CRUTSINGER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Economics Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   In what would be good news for consumers and
business borrowers, many private economists are looking for
interest rates to continue falling over the next six to nine months.
   The analysts are looking for further rate declines as the
Federal Reserve tries to keep a sluggish economy from toppling into
a recession.
   But while economists are looking for future rate cuts by the
central bank, they don't expect to see any further action in that
direction over the next month or so, given the fact that Fed
policymakers moved to ease credit conditions slightly just last
week.
   Those comments were the prevailing view as top Fed officials
gathered in Washington today for a meeting of the Federal Open
Market Committee, the panel of Fed board members and regional bank
presidents that meets eight times a year to map monetary strategy.
   David Wyss, an economist with DRI-McGraw Hill, said he was
looking for a variety of consumer and business borrowing rates to
edge lower through next summer, reflecting sluggish growth during
this period and Fed easing moves.
   Wyss predicted that the benchmark prime rate, to which one-third
of all business and consumer loans is tied, will be cut from 10.5
percent to 10 percent before Thanksgiving with another cut to 9.5
percent in the first half of next year.
   Allen Sinai, chief economist of the Boston Co., predicted that
the national average for fixed-rate mortgages, currently at a
three-month low of 9.79 percent, would fall to around 9.5 percent
in coming months with adjustable rate mortgages declining by a
somewhat larger amount.
   ``I believe we will see additional easing on the part of the Fed
over the next three to nine months because the economy will keep on
weakening, but I don't think the central bank is planning to make a
one-fourth percentage point cut in rates every few weeks,'' Sinai
said.
   Analysts were still puzzling over the timing of the Fed's easing
move last week. Members of the FOMC reportedly held a telephone
conference call Nov. 6, deciding to push a key interest rate, the
federal funds rate, down from 8.75 percent to 8.5 percent.
   Manipulation of this rate, which is the interest banks charge
each other for overnight loans, is the primary lever the Fed uses
to control short-term interest rates.
   Private economists wondered why the Fed decided to act last week
instead of simply waiting to discuss the matter at today's
regularly scheduled FOMC meeting.
   ``There was no need for them to panic because I don't see any
sign that the economy is falling off a cliff,'' Wyss said.
   Some analysts wondered whether the Fed felt pressured by the
pointed comments being made by the Bush administration that if the
country does go into an economic nosedive next year, it will be the
fault of the central bank for keeping interest rates too high.
   Others suggested that the Fed may have moved when it did as a
way of reducing the government's cost of raising funds at several
huge debt auctions held late last week after Congress raised the
debt ceiling.
   But whatever the reason, economists were generally optimistic
that the Fed's move will succeed in keeping the current record
peacetime expansion, which is entering its eighth year this month,
going for some time to come.
   Many analysts believe that growth will slow significantly from
now until next summer, as the economy responds to efforts the Fed
made last year to clamp down on credit in an effort to battle
inflationary pressures.
   But starting next summer, these analysts are looking for a
rebound in growth in response to a series of credit easing moves
the Fed has made beginning last May.
   ``The Fed is trying to bring the economy from a fast-track
growth path to a moderate-growth path without inducing a
recession,'' said Robert Diely, an economist at Northern Trust Co.
in Chicago.

   Congress is within arm's length of
establishing a National Museum of the American Indian in the
nation's capital, and in the process, settling some longstanding
feuds.
   The Senate was expected to take up a bill today to transfer a
priceless collection of Indian artifacts from New York's Museum of
the American Indian to the Smithsonian Institution, which would
display them in a national museum on the Mall and a satellite
facility in New York City.
   The House passed the measure by voice vote Monday.
   A similar bill passed the Senate on Oct. 3, but because of
slight differences in the two bills' language, Sen. Daniel K.
Inouye, D-Hawaii, planned to ask the Senate to approve the House
version today, said Pat Zell, a spokeswoman for the Senate Select
Committee on Indian Affairs, which Inouye chairs.
   The measure may at long last make peace among diverse factions,
first by resolving a 10-year-old dispute in New York over how to
display and preserve the Heye Foundation collection of more than 1
million Indian artifacts.
   Second, it stipulates that the Smithsonian, where possible,
return some 18,000 Indian remains to their original tribes for
burial.
   The question of the remains had been the last obstacle to
crafting a passable bill, and compromise came in September when
Smithsonian Secretary Robert McCormick Adams reversed the museum's
long-held policy that the bones were necessary for study.
   Indians nationwide, seeking to bury their ancestors, heralded
his decision as a watershed that will influence other museums.
   Adams called Monday's House action ``a wonderful moment.''
   ``It opens new horizons for the Smithsonian and the world,'' he
said in a statement. ``We'll be working with Native American
communities in ways we've never done before, and it's a model for
working with other communities.''

<HEAD>GOP Advice: Don't Hedge on Abortion</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By WALTER R. MEARS</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>HILTON HEAD ISLAND, S.C. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Next season's Republican
campaigners are being advised to take firm, early positions on the
issue of abortion and run on them without hedging or compromising.
   Party leaders said Republicans lost votes in the off-year
elections because they equivocated on abortion, not necessarily
because they opposed it.
   In addition, they said, Democrats claimed the middle ground on
the issue in defeating Republican candidates for governor of
Virginia and New Jersey a week ago.
   ``Lesson learned,'' said Lee Atwater, the Republican national
chairman. ``Never let your opponent define you or control the terms
of debate.''
   Atwater said that despite the 1989 defeats, GOP prospects are
good heading into next year's campaign for Congress and 36
governors.
   William Bennett, head man in the war on drugs, turned to
politics to advise Republican governors Monday that hedging on
abortion could cost the votes and doom candidates in 1990.
   ``I believe that Americans have a much higher degree of
tolerance for honest differences, deeply held differences, than
they have for trimmers and opportunists,'' Bennett told the
Republican Governors Association.
   Vice President Dan Quayle said Republicans should take their
positions on the basis of principle.
   ``Once you articulate that viewpoint, do not start changing just
because political winds may appear to be shifting,'' Quayle said.
   That meshed with Atwater's counsel. Candidates, he said, must
decide what they believe about the issue, state that position
clearly and refuse to equivocate, no matter the campaign pressures.
   ``Our party is a big tent,'' Atwater said. ``We can house many
views on many issues. Abortion is no exception.''
   The party platform of 1988 opposes abortion, but GOP leaders
said party candidates don't need to heed it.
   ``The Republican Party is not a single-issue party,'' said
Quayle, an abortion foe. Quayle said there are many pro-choice GOP
leaders, in Congress and among the governors.
   Long term, Quayle said he doubts the issue will help or hurt
either political party.
   Party policy, and President Bush's veto-enforced opposition to
abortion, align the party against the abortion rights activists who
demonstrated in Washington and elsewhere Sunday.
   Bennett challenged them to demonstrate next time against drugs
and the birth of cocaine-addicted babies.
   ``I don't think that the record suggests that the pro-life
position is political suicide,'' he said. ``It wasn't political
suicide for Ronald Reagan when he ran. It wasn't political suicide
for George Bush when he ran. ...
   ``We now have a situation ... where Molly Yard, president of the
National Organization for Women, stands up and says to us if you
dare to run people who are pro life we will get someone else up
against you and beat your brains out,'' Bennett said. ``How dare
she say that.''
   Bennett said that ``as long as people are marching ... for
rights and freedoms and protections, I would like to see a march on
Washington to protest the birth of cocaine babies.''
   He said people of all parties and persuasions could join that
demonstration, suggesting it should include ``some of the folks
from Hollywood and elsewhere'' who march for abortion rights.
   Bennett said the demonstrators claim to be concerned about the
poor, so they ought to be protesting drugs.
   ``Whatever number of people have been hurt in back-alley
abortions, it is a small number compared to the number of people
who have been hurt by back-alley drug sales,'' he said.
   The governors were winding up their annual conference today with
an education discussion featuring Roger B. Porter, Bush's assistant
for economic and domestic policy.

   A Navy jet crashed last week because its
engine suddenly failed, The Atlanta Constitution said in a report
on the accident that destroyed 12 apartments and killed two people
in this Atlanta suburb.
   Investigators have pinpointed which engine parts caused the
sudden, catastrophic failure of the A-7E Corsair II's engine
Thursday, the newspaper, quoting an unidentified source close to
the investigation, reported in Tuesday editions.
   The source, however, declined to say exactly what went wrong.
   Air traffic controllers said engine and radio failure may have
occurred about two minutes before the crash, the time of the
tower's last contact with the pilot.
   They said there was no indication the plane was in trouble
before it hit the apartment complex. An investigation of the crash
is expected to take at least 30 days.
   The Navy on Monday said it would pay the funeral expenses of the
two people who were killed when the jet slammed into their
apartment complex: Richard Dick, 24, and Margie Padovani. Padovani,
28, who was two months pregnant, died of burns Friday.
   Dick's body was transported to Meridian, Miss. Ms. Padovani's
body will be transported to her hometown of Hempstead, N.Y.
   Her 5-year-old daughter, Jacquelyn Padovani, 5, remained in
critical condition at Grady Memorial Hospital with burns over about
half of her body.
   The jet's pilot, Lt. Cmdr. Robert M. Conlyn Jr., 37, was listed
in serious condition at Kennestone Hospital in Marietta.
   Conlyn was the only person aboard the unarmed attack plane when
it crashed.
   The jet was returning to the NAS at Dobbins Air Force Base,
about two miles from the apartments and 15 miles from downtown
Atlanta, when it went down.
   The crash destroyed 12 of the 76 units at the Pine Village North
apartment complex and heavily damaged another 20, said Kathie
Barton, Smyrna's director of community relations.

<HEAD>A Great Weekend, A Worrying Future for Turks in Berlin</HEAD>

<DATELINE>BERLIN (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The opening of the Berlin Wall showered cash on
Turkish merchants down the road from Checkpoint Charlie, but
Berlin's largest minority community still feels enclosed by
discrimination.
   ``The newsstands, the vegetable shops, the electronics stores
had the business of a lifetime this weekend,'' said Mehmet
Elmasgunes, an officer at Bamukbank in West Berlin's predominantly
Turkish Kreuzberg district.
   It was an unexpected payoff, he said, for people who years ago
moved into a rundown neighborhood where not every apartment had a
toilet.
   Behind the Wall, however, is a potential flood of competition
for the low-paid jobs once reserved for immigrants. There may be
even more demand for scarce housing, an issue already turned
against foreigners by right-wing extremists.
   On the Turkish side, there is frustration about being barred
from the civil service and the legal profession, about the
difficulty in becoming German citizens and the red tape that keeps
families separated.
   ``We have begun with taking down the worst wall, the biggest
wall, and we want to work with the German people to take down these
other walls,'' said Husnu Ozankli, chairman of the Turkish
community organization in Berlin.
   ``The Turkish people have been here 25 years, 35 years now and
we consider ourselves part of this society.''
   Of the 755,000 workers in West Berlin, according to government
statistics, 47,000 are Turks, mostly employed in factories or
low-paid service jobs. Yugoslavs, who hold 15,000 jobs, are the
next largest immigrant group.
   These ``guest workers'' were welcomed in the 1960s, but since
1973 immigration has been restricted to spouses or children of
workers already here.
   ``If I married a woman in Turkey today, she could not come for
at least a year,'' Ozkanli said. ``There are so many application
procedures that are just harassment.''
   In local elections in January, the right-wing Republican Party
blamed immigrants for Berlin's ills. One poster accused Turks of
taking apartments needed by Germans. The party's share of the vote,
though only 7.5 percent, was a green light for bigotry.
   ``Careful, stinking Turkish pack! Get out of Germany, you
pigs,'' said one note Ozkanli received after the election.
   ``It is better if you pack your suitcases now and finally get
out of the city before it is too late. 7.5 percent _ that's just
the beginning,'' said another.
   Alaaddin Ozmert, a Turkish attache in Berlin who deals with
employment and benefit issues, contended that Turkish workers have
little to fear from the opening of the Wall.
   ``The Turkish workers living here are qualified, skilled
workers, and they are ... acclimatized to the life here and to the
market,'' said Ozmert.
   ``The refugees from the East bloc countries are not yet familiar
with Western technology. They would have to be re-educated to have
a chance in the job market.''
   At Bamukbank, Elmasgunes said he believed most East Berliners
would be content to visit and would not settle permanently in West
Germany. The merchants will be happy to see them return.
   Even in the more subdued, workaday atmosphere that settled over
Berlin on Monday, there was hardly room to squirm among the
shoppers at Ocak Import. A clerk said at least 2,000 radio-cassette
players were sold over the weekend, and the store hired a truck
Monday to go to West Germany to replenish stocks.
   ``We didn't think people would come here, but it was like a
carnival in the streets,'' said Mahmut Balli at Selcuk Photo. He
held up an empty cassette tape rack to show how good business had
been.
   Ozkanli emphasized that he shared in the jubilation that gripped
the city, and he offered visitors pieces he had chipped off the
Berlin Wall the night before.
   For now, he said, ``we don't mind stepping back a bit.''
   ``Everyone has to step back,'' added Dundar Atalay, a math
teacher who dropped by the office. ``Even the Germans.''

<HEAD>Foley Says House Will Pass Pay Raise Despite Nader Opposition</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By STEVEN KOMAROW</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Consumer advocate Ralph Nader is starting a
campaign against it, but Speaker Thomas S. Foley says he's
confident the House will approve a 33 percent pay raise and ethics
reform package.
   Nader, at a Monday news conference, said he was gearing up the
same kind of effort that defeated a proposed 51 percent
congressional pay raise earlier this year.
   The fact that Congress was offering to reform its ethics this
time in exchange for increasing its $89,500 salary and the salaries
of federal judges and top executive officials doesn't mean the
public should support it, he said.
   ``I don't think people in this country like the idea of Congress
telling them that they will reform themselves only if they get a
pay increase,'' Nader said. ``That smells bad.
   ``Members of Congress are in the public service, not the profit
service. If they want to make more money, they can quit and go
across the street and join a corporate law firm that will pay them
far more than they deserve,'' he said.
   Nader said he was contacting talk radio hosts and others to
block what he said was another case of Congress trying to slip one
past the public, a statement Foley vehemently denied.
   ``As usual, Mr. Nader is wrong,'' Foley said. Thursday's
scheduled vote ``won't be coming up in the dead of night, snuck
through without a vote,'' he said.
   However, Foley said he wouldn't release details of the package
until Wednesday, the day before the vote.
   While no official version has been released, the outlines of the
plan are widely known.
   It includes a 7.7 percent pay raise labeled ``cost of living
adjustment'' that would take effect Jan. 1. A year later, a 25
percent raise would be combined with a new rule banning lawmakers
from accepting fees for speeches.
   The package also includes tighter ethics restrictions on other
outside income, including gifts and free trips.
   Fred Wertheimer, president of Common Cause, a group that pushes
for tighter government ethics rules, praised the proposal.
   It ``will help ensure that the nation's top public officials are
fully compensated by the public, without supplements of private
interest influence money,'' he said Monday.
   It appeared Monday that Wertheimer's scenario was only half
right _ as the Senate seemed pleased to keep taking the speaking
fees.
   Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell said Monday that he
didn't have the votes to pass the package in his chamber, but it
was possible the Senate would allow the House to go its own way.
   There is less incentive to approve the plan in the Senate. Its
rules allow members to supplement their salaries up to 40 percent
with speech honoraria, compared with 30 percent in the House. In
addition, senators on the average have much more personal wealth
than their House colleagues.
   Congressional salaries were last increased in 1987, when
members' pay was raised from $77,400.

   A New Zealander is betting that
British Columbians will pay to jump off a bridge.
   John Brown wants to bring ``bungie jumping'' to western Canada,
and thinks he's found the ideal location, the Nanaimo River gorge
on Vancouver Island.
   In the first year of bungie jumping in Queenstown, New Zealand,
about 17,000 thrillseekers paid to leap off a bridge with a thick
rubber cord attached to their ankle, said Brown, a veteran of more
than 300 such jumps.
   ``There's been absolutely no injuries,'' he said.
   A bungie jumper leaps headfirst toward the water. The cord, or
bungie, slows momentum after about a 45-foot freefall. The momentum
is all but stopped by the time the jumper reaches the water _ but
then comes the rebound.
   The bungie pulls the jumper back skyward at almost the same
speed as the descent, Brown said.
   ``The initial plunge is the big thrill but you pull about three
Gs (gravity-force) coming back up and you get three or four good
bounces,'' he said.
   Brown said he's working on a long-term lease of the site and
hopes to start building a bridge for people to jump from early next
year.
   He said he expects to charge around $70 a jump.

<HEAD>WASHINGTON TODAY: Budget Feud Shaping up as 1990 Campaign Theme</HEAD>
<HEAD>An AP News Analysis</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By WALTER R. MEARS</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   As a campaign slogan, sequestration is not
going to make it. Too long, almost a tongue-twister, it is four
syllables of bureaucratic jargon. Besides, as one Democrat
observed, most voters probably think it is an Olympic event having
something to do with horses.
   No such luck.
   What it is is the government code for automatic spending cuts,
jargon masking the fact that Congress and the White House haven't
managed to put together a budget that fits their own deficit rules.
   President Bush has delivered a simple, Republican translation
that is likely to be built into the GOP campaign of 1990:
``Congress is to blame.''
   Bush has the better pulpit, but the Democrats aren't about to
plead guilty. So the budget feud will become a theme of the contest
for House and Senate seats next year, by which time the mess may be
worse than it is now.
   The sequester system of spending reductions has been in effect
for just short of a month, triggered by budget failure. Bush is
threatening to leave it in place, unless Congress devises and
delivers spending cuts of about $14 billion.
   ``Sequestration is a drastic action, but neither the
administration nor the Congress must flinch from our obligation to
keep this nation's deficit moving down and ultimately to reduce the
debt,'' Bush said in self-appraisal of his presidency so far. But
they've already flinched _ the deficit hasn't been moving down.
   The sequester system of spending reductions is part of a process
of deadlines and ceilings that are supposed to rein in deficit
spending and start trimming it. The automatic cuts that now are in
effect, and become more drastic if they stay, are to reduce
spending by an estimated $16.1 billion, although the final figure
may turn out to be somewhat lower.
   Bush now says that unless Congress can slice the deficit by at
least $14 billion in a bill that still is being negotiated, he'll
veto the bill and leave the automatic cuts in place. ``We are
prepared to manage the government under sequester,'' he said.
   The president said the bill will have to produce real reductions
in red ink without new taxes, without pushing off spending in a
fashion that will push the deficit up in future budgets, and
without gimmicks.
   He didn't define gimmicks, perhaps because the original
administration plan for deficit reduction included savings to be
realized by pushing up the date of a $3 billion military payroll,
and dropping postal costs from the budget numbers.
   But there also is an advantage for the administration in keeping
the current cuts _ Bush must send Congress a new federal budget,
for the year beginning Oct. 1, 1990, only two months from now. With
the automatic cuts in place at least into the winter months, it
will be easier to produce a budget meeting next year's deficit
ceiling, $74 billion.
   That also would strengthen his hand in opposing future tax
increases.
   Bush said he still wants to work with the Democrats in Congress
for a bipartisan budget settlement that will bring down the
deficits, and that politics can wait until the fall of 1990.
   But budget pronouncements on both sides are taking on a
political edge. ``The American people know why this deficit isn't
down,'' Bush said last Tuesday. ``They see, 4 to 1, that the
Congress is to blame.''
   It's not a new argument.
   When he signed a 1981 debt ceiling bill that pushed the limit
past $1 trillion, Ronald Reagan said the measure ``can stand as a
monument to the policies of the past which brought it about,
policies which as of today are reversed.''
   The government has had to triple the limit since then. Last
week, just before a default deadline, Congress passed and Bush
signed a bill increasing the debt limit to $3.12 trillion.

<HEAD>Baker Suggests Central America Could Dominate Summit</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GEORGE GEDDA</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Secretary of State James A. Baker III is
raising the possibility that reported Soviet arms deliveries to
Central America may be the most contentious issue at the
Soviet-American summit meeting in three weeks.
   Baker told Organization of American States foreign ministers
Monday evening that the Soviet shipments to that region remain the
``biggest obstacle'' to a genuine superpower accommodation.
   ``The Soviet Union bears a special responsibility because its
arms and money, moving through Cuba and Nicaragua, continue to
support violence destruction and war,'' Baker said.
   In previous statements, Baker has said he doesn't challenge the
Soviet claim that it has ceased direct weapons shipments to Central
America as of this year.
   But he has contended that Soviet shipments to the region through
third countries and deliveries by the Soviet bloc have meant that
the Kremlin's allies in the area continue to be well-stocked.
   His remarks Monday reinforced the notion that regional conflicts
_ particularly in Central America _ could produce fireworks when
President Bush and Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev hold their
summit meeting in the Mediterranean starting Dec. 2.
   The OAS meeting, featuring about 25 foreign ministers, was
continuing today after a hectic opening session Monday that
included:
   _A sharp exchange in which Panamanian Foreign Minister Leonardo
Kam accused the United States of pursuing ``fascist'' policies
after Baker called Panama an ``outlaw regime'' that should be
spurned by ``self-respecting democracies.''
   _The introduction by Costa Rica of a resolution calling on all
OAS member states to withdraw their ambassadors from Panama until a
democratic process is under way there. The human rights commission
of the OAS released a report Monday accusing Panama of widespread
abuses.
   _The admission of Canada, amid numerous expressions of support,
as the 32nd active member of the OAS.
   _A demonstration by several dozen OAS employees outside the
headquarters demanding higher pay. The OAS is undergoing a cash
flow crisis that has resulted in numerous layoffs and declining
employee morale.
   _A call by Nicaraguan Foreign Minister Miguel D'Escoto for an
OAS appeal to the government of El Salvador ``to cease immediately
the bombing of the civilian population.'' Baker held the leftist
rebels responsible for the outbreak of fighting over the weekend,
calling their attacks ``acts of terror, pure and simple.''
   Shortly before foreign ministers opened their afternoon session,
representatives of the leftist Sandinista government and the
Nicaraguan Contras reconvened peace talks here after two days of
discussions last week at the United Nations.
   There was no report on the meeting, but D'Escoto, in an
interview with The Associated Press, said there was minimal
progress at the U.N. talks because the Contra delegates weren't
interested in discussing the demobilization of their forces.
   Central American presidents last summer called for the
demobilization of the rebels by Dec. 5. Both the Contras and the
Bush administration regard that deadline as essentially meaningless
because the presidents specified that the demobilization had to be
voluntary.
   D'Escoto said the United States could speed the peace process by
converting the humanitarian aid being received by the rebels to
demobilization aid.
   The Bush administration has insisted that the rebels must
continue to receive U.S. food, clothing, shelter and medical
supplies until after the Feb. 25 national elections in Nicaragua.
   That, the administration says, will give the Sandinistas
additional incentive to hold free and fair elections.

<HEAD>HUD Lender Sues, Alleging Unfair Audits Tainted Its Reputation</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN KING</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A major lender in a federal housing program
involved in recent investigations of mismanagement is suing the
government, contending it was placed on probation because of faulty
audits.
   ``It seems as if HUD just doesn't want to deal with the fact
that the audit findings are incorrect,'' Fred Benton, chairman of
Benton Mortgage Co., said Monday. ``Apparently HUD was fishing for
scapegoats.''
   The company filed the U.S. District Court suit Monday against
the Department of Housing and Urban Development. A second suit
seeks a court order to force HUD to give final approval to two
Benton-financed projects whose mortgages are in limbo because of
the allegations against the lender.
   HUD spokesman William Glavin said the department had no comment
on Benton's lawsuits.
   The first lawsuit alleges that HUD unconstitutionally denied the
Knoxville, Tenn.-based lender a chance to rebut the charges in an
audit issued early this year by the department's inspector general.
   The report alleged that Benton had approved inflated mortgages
on more than a dozen projects, allowing the company to collect
higher fees and developers excessive subsidies because those
payments are based on the mortgage amount.
   Benton said the auditors violated generally accepted auditing
procedures and ignored evidence that HUD had approved the rents
cited in the report as being excessive.
   The suit alleged the auditors ``violated their duty to report
accurately and fairly the findings of their own investigation.''
   That suit also alleged that the department's Mortgage Review
Board could not objectively judge Benton's case because it is
headed by HUD assistant secretary for housing, C. Austin Fitts, who
the company said has accepted the findings of the audit.
   The board has been scheduled for weeks to meet today to discuss
the Benton audit.
   The two projects involved in the second suit are the 352-unit
Pebble Creek Apartments in Arlington, Texas, and the 312-unit
Kingsley Park Apartments in Essex, Md.
   Benton approved mortgages for those properties through HUD's
co-insurance program, under which private lenders are given the
power to endorse HUD insurance on roughly 80 percent of the
mortgage amount.
   HUD approved the projects at several steps of the endorsement
process, but in March notified Benton it was withholding final
approval because of the audit findings.
   In the suit, Benton said it was losing more than $30,000 a month
on the two projects because it has been unable to keep its
commitments to the developers.
   Benton also alleged it was unfairly placed on probation and that
as a result has suffered a competitive disadvantage because all of
its HUD work must be approved in advance by the department.
   One lender in the co-insurance program, DRG Funding Corp., has
more than $500 million in defaulted loans. Benton, however, says it
has never filed a claim for a default and has had its reputation
sullied because of the political climate surrounding the HUD
investigations.
   ``We've bent over backwards to be helpful, cooperative and
patient,'' Fred Benton said in a statement. ``We have nothing to
hide. Every project we co-insured was approved by HUD every step of
the way.''
   Justice Department investigators have reviewed the audit and the
working papers used to compile it but have declined comment on the
investigation.

<TEXT>
   The Boeing Co. will pay more than $5.2
million in fines and restitution after pleading guilty to two
felony charges of illegally obtaining secret Pentagon budget
documents.
   Before accepting the plea worked out between the Justice
Department and Boeing, U.S. District Judge T.S. Ellis III grilled
lawyers for nearly an hour Monday about whether ``the penalty is
appropriate to what I consider to be a serious violation of the
law.''
   The company pleaded guilty to felony counts of unauthorized
conveyance of government documents. The charge carries a maximum
fine of $10,000. An individual convicted of the crime could be
sentenced up to 10 years in prison.
   Ellis repeatedly questioned whether individual Boeing employees
or officials were guilty of criminal wrongdoing and if the company
had taken proper steps to ensure it would not continue to receive
Pentagon documents it was not supposed to see.
   ``For a group of people in a company to know that it has these
documents and takes no action is fairly arresting,'' Ellis said.
   Assistant U.S. Attorney Randy Bellows said ``we were not able to
establish to our satisfaction that other individuals were
criminally culpable and should be prosecuted for the receipt of the
information'' provided by former Boeing senior marketing analyst
Richard Lee Fowler.
   Fowler, who worked as a civilian Air Force budget official
before joining Boeing's Washington aerospace office in 1978, is
awaiting trial next month on 39 counts of conspiracy and
unauthorized conveyance.
   He is accused of giving Boeing 107 classified Pentagon documents
between 1979 and 1985, including studies of President Reagan's
Strategic Defense Initiative, more popularly known as Star Wars.
   Bellows said Boeing had cooperated with the investigation since
1986.

<HEAD>Study: Decaf Coffee Raises Cholesterol Levels</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DANIEL Q. HANEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Science Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW ORLEANS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   People who switch to decaffeinated coffee to
avoid the jitters may be unknowingly raising their cholesterol
levels and even heightening their risk of heart disease, a study
suggests.
   Researchers have long suspected but never proven that caffeine,
the chemical that gives coffee its jolt, was somehow involved in
heart trouble.
   The study raises the possibility that coffee without caffeine
could be the real villain.
   The research, conducted at Stanford University, found that
people who went from regular coffee to decaf increased their levels
of low-density lipoprotein _the so-called bad cholesterol _ an
average of 7 percent.
   ``It's not like going out and eating cheesecake, but the overall
impact could be great,'' considering the popularity of
decaffeinated coffee, said Dr. H. Robert Superko, who directed the
research.
   Superko, director of Stanford's Lipid Research Clinic, presented
his findings Monday at the annual scientific meeting of the
American Heart Association.
   He said he doubts that the process of taking out caffeine
changes the coffee so that it raises cholesterol. Instead, he said
the difference may result from the kinds of beans that go into
various types of coffee.
   In general, he said, mild arabica beans are used to make regular
coffee, while most decaffeinated brands use more strongly flavored
robusta beans.
   Superko calculated that the average 7 percent increase in bad
cholesterol in his subjects could translate into about a 12 percent
jump in the risk of heart disease.
   ``Does coffee cause heart disease?'' he asked. ``I don't know.
We can only say that coffee causes cholesterol changes.''
   No single study can prove that something is harmful, and the
Stanford findings will have to be duplicated by other researchers
before doctors are certain they are true.
   National Coffee Association officials were interested in
Superko's findings but unwilling to comment in detail without
seeing the full report.
   George Boecklin, president of the New York-based association,
said: ``Coffee and cholesterol have been investigated in many
studies with conflicting results. We agree with researchers that it
is too soon to make any definite choices.''
   One of those who questioned the latest findings was Dr. Charles
Hennekens, head of a Harvard study of aspirin's role in preventing
heart attacks. He speculated that some other habit of decaf
drinkers, rather than their morning brew, may be responsible for
the higher cholesterol.
   ``One has to question whether it's something else that coffee is
a marker for, rather than coffee itself,'' he said.
   The Stanford study used 188 healthy, middle-age coffee drinkers.
At the start, the volunteers drank three to six cups a day of
ordinary brewed coffee for two months.
   Then their cholesterol levels were checked, and they were
randomly assigned to one of three groups _ more regular coffee,
brewed decaffeinated or no coffee.
   Cholesterol levels remained steady in those who stayed on
caffeinated coffee or gave up coffee entirely. But bad cholesterol
levels rose nine milligrams per deciliter, or 7 percent, in the
decaf drinkers.
   Superko cautioned that the study doesn't entirely exonerate
ordinary coffee, because it could contribute to heart disease in
other ways, such as by triggering rhythm abnormalities or spasms in
heart arteries.
   ``I'm not saying everyone should stop drinking decaf,'' he said,
but if people are worried, they might experiment on themselves by
having their cholesterol levels checked.
   In other findings at the meeting:
   _Researchers at Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston said they
monitored the hearts of people with coronary artery disease while
they slept and found getting out of bed in the middle of the night
seemed to lead to potentially harmful periods of ischemia _ a
temporary shortage of blood.
   _Researchers at the Medical College of Wisconsin found that for
active, physically fit people with heart disease, shoveling snow
probably isn't any riskier than other moderate exercise. They
cautioned that people with heart trouble should not shovel unless
they have taken a treadmill test and consulted their doctor.

   Members of the Massachusetts congressional
delegation are calling for a Senate investigation after a federal
panel said the Seabrook, N.H., nuclear power plant should receive a
full-power license.
   Members of the delegation were incensed with a ruling Monday by
the three-member Atomic Safety and Licensing Board that upheld
emergency evacuation plans for Massachusetts.
   The ruling said that concerns raised last week about New
Hampshire's evacuation plan in a decision by a higher-level Nuclear
Regulatory Commission panel should not prevent Seabrook from
beginning commercial operations.
   ``This is perhaps the most irresponsible action that I have seen
taken by any administrative agency in the 28 years that I have been
in the United States Senate,'' said Sen. Edward Kennedy, D-Mass.
   The 571-page decision reached Nov. 9 and made public Monday took
Seabrook a step closer to a full-power license.
   The next step involves a 30-day review period by the NRC, a
public meeting by the full commission at which the NRC staff makes
its recommendations and a final decision on issuing a license by
the commission.
   Edward Brown of New Hampshire Yankee, the company that operates
Seabrook, predicted the plant would have a full-power operating
license by mid-January and would be operating at 100 percent within
three months.

   The Justice Department is ending its court
appeals involving the delayed Iran-Contra case against former CIA
station chief Joseph Fernandez.
   Department spokesman Dan Eramian said Monday that the department
would not contest a Sept. 29 appeals court ruling that concluded
the power to appeal decisions on classified material rests in the
hands of Iran-Contra prosecutor Lawrence Walsh.
   Fernandez, an ex-CIA operative in Costa Rica, was scheduled to
go on trial July 24, but the Justice Department obtained an
emergency stay from the U.S. Court of Appeals in Richmond, Va.,
after the CIA said it needed to protect certain classified
information that Fernandez wanted to use in court.
   The material concerned three CIA locations, including stations
in Honduras and El Salvador, and three CIA programs in Costa Rica.
   Fernandez, who assisted Oliver North's secret Contra re-supply
network, is accused of obstructing the Tower Commission and the CIA
inspector general's office and making false statements in the
Iran-Contra affair.

<NOTE>Democrats Call for Defense Cuts</NOTE>

<TEXT>
   Congressional liberals are promising to push
for sweeping defense spending cuts in response to the sweeping
changes in Eastern Europe when Congress begins debate on its first
``post-Cold War budget'' in February.
   A dozen lawmakers, led by Rep. Barney Frank, D-Mass., said at a
Capitol Hill news conference Monday that they represent the
beginning of a growing coalition of legislators pushing for a shift
from defense to domestic spending.
   ``America's military budget _ the $305 billion that we've just
passed as an authorization and are about to pass as an
appropriation _ significantly exceeds America's needs in the
current world,'' Frank said.
   ``What you see emerging here is a coalition of people who want
to talk about realities,'' said Rep. George Miller, D-Calif. ``This
is our opening shot and we're going to be tough on the budget next
year. ... This is hardball politics.''
   Frank said supporters of defense cuts are not all liberals and
that Rep. Charles Stenholm, D-Texas, who heads the Conservative
Democratic Forum, has endorsed the idea.

   Actress Tess Harper returned to her alma
mater to support a play about homosexuals and AIDS under attack by
a local group.
   Southwest Missouri State University's theater department is
staging Larry Kramer's ``The Normal Heart,'' which won praise in
New York and elsewhere but is being denounced as obscene by the
Citizens Demanding Standards.
   About 1,200 opponents of the play packed a hall Monday with
gospel songs and fiery speeches. The group objects to state money
being used to produce a play portraying a homosexual lifestyle.
   State Rep. Jean Dixon, who has led the fight against the play,
said, ``We will never have excellence in education until we have
responsibility and accountability in education.''
   University administrators said the play will go on as scheduled
beginning Wednesday.
   Ms. Harper, a 1972 graduate, said Monday that opponents had a
right to complain about the play, which attacks society's slow
response to the AIDS epidemic, but no right to stop it from being
shown.
   ``If you don't want to see the play, you don't have to buy a
ticket,'' said Ms. Harper, who was nominated for best supporting
actress in 1987 for her role in ``Crimes of the Heart.''
   Kathleen Turner and John Goodman, fellow actors and SMSU alumni,
also have expressed support for the play.

   Sylvester Stewart, better known as rock
musician Sly Stone of Sly and the Family Stone, was ordered held
without bond pending extradition to California, where he is wanted
on a 1987 drug charge.
   Assistant U.S. Attorney Ted Heinrich said Monday that he
expected California authorities to initiate extradition proceedings.
   Stone was arrested by FBI agents Saturday in Wilton on a federal
charge of unlawful flight to avoid prosecution, said Special Agent
Virginia Wright.
   The 45-year-old musician was arrested in April 1987 on narcotics
charges in Los Angeles and failed to appear in court, Wright said.
She said Stone has been living in Connecticut and New Jersey under
the alias Sylvester Allen.
   Sly and the Family Stone had a string of hits in the late 1960s
and early 1970s, including ``Stand,'' ``Everyday People,'' ``Thank
You'' and ``I Want to Take You Higher.'' Stone has not had a song
on the charts since 1974.

   Television game show host Bob Barker kicks
off the Christmas gift-buying season by taking his animal rights
crusade to New York's swank Fifth Avenue.
   Barker said Monday he will lead a Nov. 24 demonstration
sponsored by Trans-Species Unlimited to publicize the group's
objections to killing animals for use by the fur industry.
   ``We're encouraged by knowing that demonstrations such as these
over the past couple of years have had a direct impact on the fur
industry,'' said Barker. ``Recent statistics show that fur sales
are off from 45 percent to 50 percent from three years ago while
synthetic fur sales are on the rise.''
   Barker, whose CBS-TV show ``The Price is Right'' is in its 18th
year, has led the protest against animal abuse in entertainment,
particularly the alleged mistreatment of chimpanzees during filming
of the movie ``Project X.''

   The man who testified he helped former
``Diff'rent Strokes'' star Todd Bridges attack a drug dealer was
placed on three years' probation as part of a plea bargain.
   In exchange for his testimony against Bridges, 31-year-old
Harvie Eugene Duckett pleaded no contest to being an accessory
after the fact in the shooting of Kenneth Clay.
   Duckett was sentenced Monday to probation by Judge Gary Klausner.
   Bridges, 24, was acquitted last week of attempted murder and
attempted voluntary manslaughter. The Superior Court jury
deadlocked on an assault with a deadly weapon count. Prosecutors
were to decide by Nov. 21 whether to seek another trial on the
assault charge.
   Prosecutors said Bridges shot Clay eight times on Feb. 2 inside
a Los Angeles cocaine ``rock'' house.
   Bridges, best known for his role as Gary Coleman's older brother
in the ``Diff'rent Strokes'' television series from 1978 to 1986,
was freed on $25,000 bail last week.

   Stormie Jones, the world's first survivor of a
heart-liver transplant, was released from a hospital after
undergoing treatment with an experimental drug to fight organ
rejection.
   The 12-year-old girl had been listed in good condition for
several days and she and her mother were eager to get home to
Texas, Children's Hospita of Pittsburgh spokeswoman Margy Buczynski
said Monday.
   Ms. Buczynski said Stormie will continue to be treated with a
new, experimental medication, FK 506. Children's, one of the few
hospitals that administers the drug, will send her shipments.
   Stormie will receive periodic blood tests in Texas and will not
have to return to Children's as long as she has no adverse reaction
to the drug, Ms. Buczynski said.
   Stormie was admitted Nov. 3 because her body was rejecting a new
liver and not responding to a commonly used anti-rejection drug,
cyclosporine.
   She received the transplant during surgery here Feb. 14, 1984.

``Shocker,'' which collected $2.4 million. Woody Allen's cautionary
drama ``Crimes and Misdemeanors'' continued to attract steady
business, landing in fifth with a take of $2.1 million.
   In sixth, with $2 million, was the new release ``Staying
Together,'' starring Sean Astin, Dermot Mulroney and Tim Quill as
three brothers. It was followed in seventh by ``Second Sight,'' the
psychic comedy featuring Bronson Pinchot and John Larroquette.
``Second Sight'' returned $1.5 million.

   A man identified in news reports as a suspect in
the shooting of a pregnant woman and her husband pleaded innocent
to an unrelated charge of armed robbery of a video store.
   William Bennett, 39, of Boston's Mission Hill section, where
Carol and Charles Stuart were attacked last month, entered his plea
Monday in Brookline District Court. He was being held at the
Norfolk County House of Corrections on $35,000 bail.
   Authorities have refused to comment on reports in the Boston
Herald and The Boston Globe that Bennett is under investigation in
the Oct. 23 attack on the suburban couple.
   Mrs. Stuart, 30, a lawyer, died after being shot by a robber who
commandeered the couple's car as they left an inner-city hospital
where they attended a birthing class. The infant was delivered by
Caesarean section and clung to life for more than two weeks before
succumbing to a respiratory ailment Thursday.
   Charles Stuart, 29, was listed in stable condition Monday at
Boston City Hospital.
   Bennett was arrested Saturday on charges of driving with a
revoked license.
   The motor vehicles case was postponed when Boston attorney
Judith Lindahl appeared in Bennett's defense, saying she had been
contacted by the Committee for Public Counsel to defend whoever
might be charged in connection with the Stuart shooting.
   Asked if she thought Bennett might be charged in the case, she
said: ``I have no inside knowledge on what the D.A.'s office will
do.''
   Bennett's mother, Pauline, told the Herald her son was a suspect
in the Stuart case.
   Norfolk County Assistant District Attorney Louis Sabadini
requested $500,000 bail for Bennett on the armed robbery charge,
arguing that he had committed 37 offenses, many of them violent,
since first being arrested in 1968.

<HEAD>Ruins Reveal Early Emergence of Mayan Civilization</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LEE SIEGEL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Science Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A jungle-shrouded city of pyramids and
temples in Guatemala was built as long ago as 630 B.C., showing
that Mayan civilization blossomed about four centuries earlier than
believed, scientists say.
   The findings may make the ancient city of Nakbe in northern
Guatemala one of the oldest in the Americas, researchers said.
   ``It's a very significant discovery,'' said Arthur Demarest,
anthropology chairman at Vanderbilt University in Tennessee.
   The University of California, Los Angeles, on Monday announced
the findings by archaeologist Richard Hansen and colleagues at
UCLA, Utah's Brigham Young University and Guatemala's University of
San Carlos.
   ``We have substantial evidence that this is the earliest Maya
urban center ever found,'' Hansen said.
   BYU anthropology chairman Donald Forsyth added, ``We're now
going to have to push the beginning of Maya civilization back
further into the past.''
   Archaeologists once believed advanced Mayan civilization emerged
around A.D. 300 and ended 600 years later during what is described
as the ``classic period.'' Research conducted during 1978-83 at El
Mirador, Guatemala, pushed that date back to 200 B.C.
   But in excavating Nakbe, 350 miles north of Guatemala City and
not far from El Mirador, Hansen's 50-member team determined that
roughly 100 stone pyramids and other buildings were from about 630
B.C. to 400 B.C. So were some of the site's 65,000 pottery pieces,
sculptures, figurines and other artifacts.
   Dates can be determined by the radioactivity of carbon in
organic material associated with buildings. Pottery is dated by
comparison with the style of shards from elsewhere in Central
America.
   ``We have from 1000 B.C. to 600 B.C. a small village with wooden
buildings,'' Hansen said by telephone from his home in Rupert,
Idaho. ``Then all of a sudden _ boom! They brought in rock and fill
and buried the village and made platforms. On those they placed
their buildings.''
   Hansen said Nakbe's buildings include 35- to 150-foot-tall
platforms and flat-topped pyramids, many of which are topped by
three small temples and sculpture depicting important gods and
kings. The buildings are solid, without interior rooms.
   The scale of construction reflects the emergence of an
administrative and religious elite to command thousands of workers,
Hansen said.
   Anthropologist John Graham of the University of California,
Berkeley, said an even earlier center of advanced Mayan
civilization may be found.
   Still, Graham said, the Nabke study ``is part of the most
exciting Maya discovery of recent decades.''
   The discovery solves a puzzle for archaeologists: The Mayans
seemed to evolve more slowly from farming communities to cities
than other pre-Columbian civilizations to the north and south. But
archaeologists say Nakbe proves that Mayan development occurred
more or less in step with the rise of the Olmec culture in Mexico,
thought to be the oldest civilization of the Americas.
   An archaeologist mapped some of Nakbe's architecture in 1962.
Hansen first visited in 1987 and his team conducted the first
full-scale excavation last February through April.
   Hansen's team hacked their way through dense jungle for three
days and 40 miles to reach Nakbe from the nearest road. They hauled
water from a swamp 4 miles away. Demarest admiringly called it
``macho archaeology.''
   Among the most important finds at Nakbe is a sculpture on a
limestone slab that probably dates from about 400 B.C. and is about
10 feet tall, 4 feet wide and 18 inches thick.
   The sculpture of two royal figures and a god ``is the earliest
and largest preclassic sculpture ever found,'' Hansen said.
   Other discoveries include seashells and obsidian glass tools
that indicate emergence of long-distance trade. There also are
signs of a society taming its environment: gutter-like water
collection systems on six buildings and 60-foot-wide stone-and-mud
roads, Hansen said.
   He said he believes transformation from village to city happened
because trade and the need for water and transportation fostered
emergence of an administrative and religious elite, which then
ordered construction of temples.

   Richard Strauss' ``Die Frau ohne Schatten'' was
one of the Metropolitan Opera's first productions after it moved to
Lincoln Center. It still is one of its most magical and beautiful.
   The Met performed ``Die Frau'' on Monday night for the first
time since the 1981-82 season.
   Mechthild Gessendorf was to have sung the Empress but was
replaced in the title role by soprano Ruth Falcon because of
illness.
   For Miss Falcon, of New Orleans, the performance was her Met
debut.
   The part contains very high notes, which Miss Falcon can reach.
However, her vocal production was inconsistent. When she was good,
she sounded very good but that wasn't all the time.
   The evening's star was Marilyn Zschau of Chicago.
   ``Die Frau ohne Schatten'' _ the woman without a shadow _ is
about an empress who cannot bear children.
   She lived in a spirit world before she married the Emperor. In
that world, she and her nurse meet the Dyer and his wife. They're
looking for an ``ordinary'' woman to relinquish her shadow so the
Empress can take it.
   The Dyer's wife toys with ideas of glittery clothes and a young
man _ both are conjured up by the nurse _ that might be more fun
than motherhood. Miss Zschau, who performed the Dyer's wife, was
fairly flamboyant in acting and singing. Her voice pours out,
radiantly beautiful, large and exciting.
   Robert Schunk's tenor was less than subtle as the Emperor.
   Conductor Christof Perick seemed to increase volume every time
Schunk sang and the tempo of Schunk's first aria was so slow he
seemed to have trouble. Baritone Bernd Weikl fared better as the
Dyer, sounding serious and solid but warm.
   Helga Dernesch as the Nurse was having pitch problems.
   Nathaniel Merrill oversaw the production _ which uses a shiny
dark green forest for the royal and spirit scenes. A gazebo is as
delicate as a fairytale.
   The stage machinery is used for scene changes. Projections merge
into new ones; sets go up or down, bringing a new scene to stage
level as the old disappears, and the turntable revolves.
   This is an opera that ends happily. Librettist Hugo von
Hofmannsthal presents fulfilled family life, with both couples
embracing, both women possessing shadows.

   The dollar ended higher against the Japanese yen
Tuesday, while share prices on the Tokyo Stock Exchange made up for
morning losses and broke a record high set the previous day.
   The dollar finished unchanged from its opening at 143.80 yen, up
0.25 yen from Monday's close of 143.55 yen. The currency ranged
between 143.60 yen and 143.85 yen.
   The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues gained 18.52
points, or 0.05 percent, ending the day at 35,768.64, yet another
high. The index had reached a record Monday at 35,750.12, with a
86.92-point gain.
   Dealers said the index recovered when institutional investors
bought steel issues, expecting no immediate trend changes in
foreign exchange and interest rates.
   In currency dealings, the dollar-yen rate was moving narrowly,
as market players were reluctant to make major moves ahead of a
series of releases of U.S. economic indicators later this week, as
well as the auction for U.S. government bonds, said a foreign
exchange analyst with New Japan Securities Co.
   Among the major releases are the U.S. retail price index for
October, due out later Tuesday.
   The analyst said the West German mark, which had been bought
earlier, was lower due to profit-taking.

   Energy Secretary James Watkins toured the
earthquake-shattered Marina district, and praised San Franciscans
for the way they reacted to the disaster.
   Watkins' 40-minute walking tour took him past buildings that
were knocked from their foundations or burned in the Oct. 17 quake,
which measured 7.1 on the Richter scale, killed 66 people and did
an estimated $7 billion in damage.
   ``I am extremely impressed with the way this was handled,''
Watkins said.
   The secretary said several ambassadors had told him they admired
the way local officials and the public reacted to the disaster.
   ``There was no panic and a minimum of looting,'' Watkins said.
``There was positive control and people listened to those in
authority.''
   The tour covered about eight blocks of the largely residential
Marina district, which was built on landfill dumped in San
Francisco Bay to form the foundation for the 1915 Panama Pacific
International Exposition.
   John Ulrich, a spokesman for Pacific Gas &amp; Electric Co., said
power has been restored to most of 5,000 homes in the 100-block
area.
   Many of the apartment houses on the tour had yellow police lines
around them, meaning occupants are allowed to enter just for brief
periods. About 40 dwellings remain completely off-limits.
   Rubble from the demolished structures was taken to the Zanker
Road Recycling Facility in San Jose where workers sifted through it
and pulled out anything that seemed valuable.
   The material _ including such items as diplomas, paperback books
and kitchen utensils _ will be brought back to San Francisco this
week where it will be sorted and organized for distribution to the
owners, said city spokeswoman Suzanne Drabble.

<DATELINE>SAN SALVADOR, El Salvador (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The fierce fighting raging in
San Salvador shows both sides of the rebels' double-edged sword.
Neither is honed for battlefield victory.
   The rebel Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front is pursuing
a two-track strategy aimed at dramatic changes in one of the
Western Hemisphere's poorest and most polarized countries.
   With an estimated 7,000 regular fighters and perhaps twice as
many irregulars, the leftist rebels know they cannot defeat a
45,000-man armed force backed by massive U.S. aid.
   Instead, they hope to bring about broad social and political
change by either making the country so chaotic that the status quo
crumbles or by pressuring the new rightist government into
concessions.
   In the eyes of rebel theoreticians, El Salvador could become
ungovernable if a broad-based civilian movement _ encouraged by the
organizational efforts of the rebels or political activists who
share some of their goals _ meshes with the armed rebel struggle.
   ``This insurrection isn't conceived of as a general uprising in
which the masses will rise up throughout the country at the same
time,'' rebel commander Leo Cabral said recently. ``We have a more
irregular, much less classic concept.''
   They see pressure from inside and outside El Salvador as the key
to forcing the government to meet their negotiating terms.
   ``The military struggle is a means of backing up demands,''
rebel commander Joaquin Villalobos said in an interview in Managua,
Nicaragua, last week.
   Whether the spectacular and bloody offensive they launched
Saturday night will move them any closer to their goals remained to
be seen. But the rebels clearly put the war back in the spotlight.
   ``The only good thing that could result from this would be to
wake people up, to bring about negotiations,'' said Lutheran Bishop
Medardo Gomez, a member of a nationwide coalition seeking peace
talks. ``Otherwise we are lost.''
   Both U.S. and Salvadoran officials insist the offensive is an
attempt to disguise declining rebel military fortunes.
   ``I think this is a sign of weakness rather than strength,''
U.S. Ambassador William Walker told reporters late Monday.
   He said the offensive would not reverse what he called the
``fading'' fortunes and legitimacy of the rebel front.
   But Walker also called it part of an attempt by the front to
``enhance its appearance of strength at the bargaining table.''
   The guerrillas stunned the nation by bringing their fight to the
capital as they had never done in 10 years of largely rural,
hit-and-run combat.
   After nearly 24 hours of heavy combat, the rebels had entrenched
themselves in neighborhoods along a wide arc on the northern fringe
of San Salvador.
   They installed themselves in homes and apartments and positioned
snipers in church towers and tall buildings. In many areas
civilians, both willing and unwilling, were obliged to provide
support.
   Walker said an estimated 1,500 guerrillas were taking part in
the fighting in the capital. The attacks in San Salvador were
accompanied by at least 50 other coordinated actions nationwide, he
said.
   Civilian casualties appeared high as government helicopter
gunships strafed heavily populated areas where the rebels were dug
in.
   Some feared the offensive would move the government away, not
toward, negotiations by strengthening the hand of the
ultra-rightists in President Alfredo Cristiani's Nationalist
Republican Alliance who have long been accused of links to death
squads.
   ``This will be a test for the government because it has facist
tendencies,'' Gomez said as gunfire crackled outside his modest
church in the city center.
   Cristiani imposed a state of seige after the fighting broke out,
suspending constitutional rights such as freedom of assembly, and
his government imposed a virtual news blackout. The president also
warned that political parties ``that might be part of the FMLN''
would not be tolerated.
   Recently initiated peace talks between the rebels and the
government broke down after the Oct. 31 bombing of the headquarters
of a union sympathetic to the rebel cause in which 10 people were
killed and 29 were injured.
   The rebels, who named the offensive after one of the slain union
leaders, clearly hoped public indignation over the bombing combined
with the shock of the fierce combat in the capital would help
revive the peace process.
   The two sides are far apart and each accuses the other of
lacking any real interest in peace.
   The rebels say Cristiani's demand that the fighting stop before
any serious talk on reform begins is like an invitation to suicide.
   Cristiani says rebel demands for a purge of the military high
command and for replacing the Supreme Court are ``totally absurd.''
   ``We realize that the FMLN is a reality, that it exists,'' he
said recently. ``But it is a small reality...''

   At night the crack-infested inner-city
neighborhood where a motorist was shot to death in front of her
4-year-old son is full of suburban ``commuters'' who cruise in to
buy drugs, then motor home.
   Neighbors of the north Harlem neighborhood call it ``Drug
City,'' and describe a life in which gunfire is common and drug
dealers so brazen they can grant or withhold permission for a
person to enter his own apartment building.
   Residents see the fancy cars arrive from the New Jersey and
Connecticut suburbs, drawn by the streetside trade in cocaine,
heroin and other drugs in a neighborhood of boarded-up buildings
and crumbling sidewalks. A mural that reads ``Push Crack Back'' is
just wishful thinking, they say.
   Janet Pierro, 33, of Weehawken, N.J., and her son arrived in the
neighborhood in a rented car shortly before dawn Sunday, police
said.
   A man approached the car and fired one shot into the rear,
striking Mrs. Pierro in the back. She drove about a block before
striking a light pole, said Officer Hugh Barry.
   Mrs. Pierro died at Harlem Hospital. Her son was unharmed.
Police later arrested Myron Morton, 32, and charged him with
second-degree murder and criminal possession of a deadly weapon.
   Mrs. Pierro lived with her husband, Robert, their son and
8-month-old daughter in a two-story house. Pierro, a furniture
store manager, said he didn't know why his wife was in Harlem.
   ``She was a typical middle-class housewife,'' said Jerry Thomas,
who lives near the family.
   ``She dressed very conservatively and loved her kids. She was
helpful to neighbors. ... Once she helped jump my car battery. I
can't believe the slaying.''
   The motive appeared to be robbery, police said Monday, but added
that it was unclear if Mrs. Pierro had been in the area to buy
drugs or had accidentally wandered into streets overrun by drug
dealers.
   Either way, the shooting has drawn attention to the concern by
law enforcement officials and others about suburban drug buyers.
   Statistics from the city's Tactical Narcotics Team document the
suburban drug trade: Of 3,000 cars seized from accused drug buyers
between 1986 and November, 1,600 were from outside the city, 600
from New Jersey alone.
   ``We see some really terrific cars,'' said Inspector Alfred
James of the narcotics team.
   Robert Stutman, special agent in charge of the federal Drug
Enforcement Administration in New York, said suburbanites who shop
for drugs in the inner city ``are contributing significantly to the
drug problem in America.''
   ``We still see people coming in from the suburbs into heavy drug
areas to purchase drugs and take them out to the nice suburbs,''
Stutman said. ``They are doing business with people prone to
violence. Occasionally, they get them upset.''
   In a June drug raid 10 blocks from the scene of Sunday's
killing, police confiscated 42 cars, including 25 from New Jersey
and 13 from other New York suburbs.
   Suburban residents have been caught up in the violence before.
   In April, 32-year-old Lidia Ferraro of Fairview, N.J., was shot
and killed by police officers after she led them on a chase through
East Harlem streets. Police said they pursued her after she ran a
red light while high on heroin, cocaine and other drugs.
   New Jersey authorities are well aware of the problem. Prosecutor
John Holl said his Bergen County office in July began identifying
motorists buying drugs across the George Washington Bridge in
Manhattan and arresting them when they returned to New Jersey.
   ``Crack is cheaper over there than it is here,'' Holl said.
   A Harlem resident who lives near where the Pierro slaying
occurred said she hoped it would draw attention to her block and
help save it.
   ``I hate that the poor woman got killed but I hope they can do
something about it. Please come help us out here in Hamilton Place.
We need it,'' the woman said. She asked not to be identified for
fear of reprisal from drug dealers.

   A jury sentenced a man to life in prison as
a habitual criminal after he was convicted of shoplifting $10.35
worth of brisket.
   Merwyn Willis Nichols, 49, who had eight previous felony
convictions and four misdemeanor convictions, was sentenced Monday
under the state's habitual criminal statute. The theft occurred
last November.
   ``I guess they figured enough is enough,'' prosecutor Troy
Johnson said of the jurors. ``You can only give a guy so many
chances. You have to draw the line somewhere and they drew the
line.''
   It took jurors only 45 minutes to hand down the maximum
punishment.
   Nichols, who testified he had trouble holding a job, has been
convicted of theft, burglaries, forgeries, illegal possession of a
firearm and driving while intoxicated, according to court records.
His longest previous sentence was eight years, Johnson said.
   Nichols will be eligible for parole in 15 years.

<HEAD>Jupiter-Bound Galileo Completes First Course Correction</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PASADENA, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Galileo spacecraft, speeding toward
a 1995 rendezvous with Jupiter, successfully completed its first
course correction by firing its small thrusters more than 2,000
times, NASA said.
   The three-day maneuver, which ended Saturday night, accelerated
the spacecraft by about 38 mph, bringing its speed to more than
60,000 mph relative to the sun, said Jim Wilson, spokesman for the
National Aeronautics and Space Administration's Jet Propulsion
Laboratory.
   The trajectory change is meant to put Galileo in proper position
for its flight past Venus on Feb. 9, 1990. The spacecraft will
swoop by Venus once and Earth twice so the planets can act as
``gravity slingshots'' to propel Galileo toward Jupiter during the
$1.9 billion mission.
   In July 1995, Galileo will separate into an orbiter and a probe.
The orbiter will circle Jupiter for 22 months starting Dec. 7,
1995, and the probe will parachute into the Jovian atmosphere,
making measurements for 75 minutes until it is crushed by intense
pressure.
   Galileo was launched from space shuttle Atlantis on Oct. 18. On
Monday, Galileo was 5.3 million miles from Earth and 36.9 million
miles along its looping 2.4-billion-mile path to Jupiter.
   Wilson said several of Galileo's 12 thrusters fired a total of
2,000 brief pulses during the trajectory maneuver, the first of
about 30 course corrections needed to get the spacecraft to
Jupiter, the solar system's largest planet.
   A temperature sensor on one thruster malfunctioned Friday, so
another thruster was used Saturday, mission director Neal Ausman
said.

<HEAD>Former Head of Beech-Nut Admits Guilt in Phony Apple Juice Scam</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RONALD POWERS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The former president of the Beech-Nut Nutrition
Corp. admitted he cheated millions of consumers by selling them
sugar water labeled as pure apple juice for babies.
   Niels L. Hoyvald, 56, pleaded guilty Monday to 10 felony counts
of violating the federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act. The plea
forestalled a third trial for Hoyvald.
   ``I did not intend to defraud, but I do plead guilty with intent
to mislead the public,'' Hoyvald said. ``I did it knowingly.''
   ``We're glad this defendant has finally admitted his
involvement,'' said the prosecutor, Assistant U.S. Attorney Thomas
H. Roche.
   Beech-Nut and its corporate parent spent as much as $10 million
in legal fees during the case, said federal Judge Thomas C. Platt.
   Platt fined Hoyvald $100,000 and sentenced him to five years
probation and six consecutive months of full-time community
service. The agreement concludes a complex and costly prosecution
that began three years ago.
   Hoyvald was convicted in February 1988 on about 350 counts of
willfully violating the food and drug act, but a federal appeals
panel overturned the conviction on a technicality. A second trial
in September ended with a mistrial.
   Hoyvald, who has since been fired by Beech-Nut, was president of
the company during part of the period that the baby-food giant
produced and distributed as pure apple juice for babies what was
actually water flavored with beet sugar or other sweeteners and
containing little, if any, apple.
   ``This case has probably cost Nestle, the corporate parent of
Beech-Nut, in fines and legal fees, many times the few millions
they saved in passing off this bogus apple juice to the public,''
said Andrew J. Maloney, U.S. attorney for the Eastern District of
New York.
   In November 1987, Beech-Nut pleaded guilty to 215 felony counts
and paid a $2 million fine, plus investigation costs.
   Another defendant, John F. Lavery, a Beech-Nut vice president
during the years the company willfully cheated millions of its
customers, was also convicted in the scheme.
   The U.S. Supreme Court last month ended Lavery's right to appeal
and obligated him to serve a year-and-a-day jail sentence.

<TEXT>
   The military wants more land for war games
in four Western states, but hunters, ranchers and environmentalists
see its plans as a land grab twice the size of Massachusetts that
menaces wildlife and farming.
   Four separate proposals by different branches of the armed
services would expand areas for training with tanks, warplanes and
artillery by 16,800 square miles in unconnected areas in Montana,
Idaho, Utah and Nevada.
   The Pentagon says the proposals to add military training to uses
allowed on the federally owned land aren't part of a coordinated
effort. But environmentalists say Congress rejected a similar
national program in 1974.
   ``It's too coincidental to be a coincidence,'' said Charles
Griffith, regional executive for the National Wildlife Federation
in Bozeman.
   The National Guard wants to use 1,500 square miles in
northeastern Montana's rolling plains for training by its own units
and forces of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. About
three-fourths of the acreage is federally owned grazing land.
   In southern Idaho, the Air Force has proposed expanding the
155-square-mile Saylor Creek Bombing Range to more than 2,300
square miles. The plan has stirred opposition from ranchers with
cattle grazing the land, environmentalists fearing damage to
wildlife, and some local politicians.
   In Utah, the Air Force wants to create a $3 billion ``electronic
battlefield'' that will be used to test aircraft and weapons under
simulated combat conditions. The machinery would be scattered
across a 20-mile-wide, 70-mile-long section of the state's western
desert.
   In western Nevada, the National Guard wants a 1,100 square mile
training area near Naval Air Station Fallon.
   The base also has proposed adding 10,000 square miles of the
airspace used for flight training, more than doubling the area now
used. That would restrict uses of the land beneath the flight paths.
   The Navy also wants to set aside 310 square miles in Nevada as a
missile firing range, plus 280 square miles as buffer zones for the
naval air station's bombing ranges.
   Despite the suspicions of environmentalists, the simultaneous
proposals in four states are coincidental, said Maj. Everett
Foster, public affairs officer for the National Guard Bureau at the
Pentagon.
   ``I have not been aware of anything that would tie this to those
other issues,'' he said. He said the Montana proposal was tailored
to the Montana Guard's needs as it converts to F-16 fighter planes,
newer tanks and updated Cobra helicopter gunships.
   The Nevada Guard has undergone a similar shift to different
aircraft and equipment, he added.
   The military needs more sites for its maneuvers in sparsely
settled areas of the West because many of the nation's existing
bases are getting hemmed in as cities and suburbs spread, Foster
said.
   The plans are raising eyebrows in all four states _ where the
military already controls a combined 5,300 square miles.
   Ranchers say they're worried about the effect on federal grazing
land, which is leased to cattlemen. Farmers say they're worried
about water rights. Hunters question the effect of military
training on wildlife.
   In Montana, a six-weekend trial run on a small section did
little to reassure ranchers who use the land to graze cattle.
   ``I don't know how the hell we're going to get something to grow
back in that,'' rancher Peter Nyquist said, looking at tank tracks
torn through the thin soil.
   ``I don't think any of the federal or state agencies, even the
National Guard itself, really knows what the cumulative impacts of
this program may be,'' said Griffith of the Wildlife Federation.
   The military has tried to offer assurances. In Montana, the
Guard said it wants to be just one of many users of federal land,
in compliance with the federal doctrine of ``multiple use'' of the
federal estate.
   In Utah, Air Force officials offered assurances that grazing and
hunting on the land would continue, diluting opposition from
ranchers and residents of small nearby communities.
   Debate over the Nevada proposals centers on a wilderness bill in
Congress that its sponsor has agreed to amend so it won't endanger
the Navy's plans. Environmentalists have complained that the
changes gut the legislation.
   Citizen Alert, an environmental group based in Reno, claims many
of the proposed bombing and gunnery ranges are part of a regional
``continental operation range'' conceived by the Air Force, but
rejected by Congress in 1974.

<HEAD>City Agrees On $50,000 Settlement With Black Men In `Stalker' Case</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PHILADELPHIA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The city agreed to pay a total of $50,000 to
more than 330 black men who were stopped, frisked, questioned or
arrested last winter during a police hunt for a rapist.
   The settlement came in a federal lawsuit that claimed the
investigation was conducted in an unconstitutional manner from
February to March 23, 1988, when police arrested Reynard Gregory,
later convicted of 10 attacks against women.
   After weeks of negotiations, the agreement was reached between
the city solicitor's office and Stefan Presser, legal director of
the American Civil Liberties Union, and David Rudovsky,
representing some of the plaintiffs.
   The city admitted no liability in the case. The agreement marks
the third time since 1986 that the city has reached settlements in
class-action lawsuits alleging constitutional violations in
investigations by city police.
   The settlement was the second in the case. Shortly after the
suit was filed in U.S. District Court in March 1988, the Police
Department agreed to stop detaining black men merely because they
resembled a police sketch.
   In the settlement, which includes $20,000 payment for legal
fees, 63 men will receive a minimum of $500 each, while 273 others
will receive at least $100 each, Presser said.
   Gregory, known as the ``Center City Stalker,'' was convicted
last year of 10 robberies, three attempted rapes and seven indecent
assaults in a series of crimes that terrorized women living or
working downtown.
   The stalker haunted hallways and stairwells in buildings within
a six-block radius of City Hall. Sometimes using ruses, sometimes
by force, he would get the young wonmen he victimized into
out-of-the-way locations and then rob them and sexually assault
them.
   In November 1986, the city agreed to pay nearly $500,000 to be
divided among 1,444 people who were stopped or searched by police
during a drug crackdown in 1985.
   In February 1986, a $45,000 settlement was reached by the city
and residents of a neighborhood who were rounded up and questioned
after the shooting death of a police officer.

<HEAD>Liechtenstein Monarch Dead at 83</HEAD>
<DATELINE>VADUZ, Liechtenstein (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Prince Franz Josef II of
Liechtenstein, head of state of the tiny principality during a half
century that saw it become one of the world's richest nations, has
died at age 83, the government said today.
   He was the world's longest-reigning monarch when he died late
Monday after a long, undisclosed illness and less than a month
after his wife, Princess Gina, died at age 67.
   The prince's poor condition had prevented him from attending her
funeral.
   Franz Josef II was the 12th ruler of the 270-year-old nation,
last remnant of the ``Holy Roman Empire''. The principality covers
61 square miles of rolling land and rugged mountains between
Switzerland and Austria.
   His 51 years as head of state spanned the rise of this tiny
democratic state from an underdeveloped and rural country to a
sophisticated industrialized nation with one of the world's highest
per-capita incomes.
   He enjoyed great popularity among the 28,000 inhabitants, often
mixing with them in the streets of Vaduz, the capital.
   ``I am ruling over a happy country,'' the prince, defined by the
constitution as ``hallowed and sacrosanct'', once said in a rare
interview. ``It is a happy country because it is small.''
   In 1984 he handed over his executive powers to his son, Hans
Adam, the oldest of their five children. But he retained the
ceremonial role of head of state, and continued to meet many
well-wishers every year during the festivities marking his birthday
on Aug. 16, a public holiday.
   The constitution gave him the right to veto any piece of
legislation. But throughout his reign he used the veto only once,
to kill a law on hunting rights.
   ``It was a silly law. it would have turned every garden into a
shooting ground,'' he explained.
   Born in 1906 at Frauenthal Castle, Austria, he took office in
1938, succeeding his uncle, Prince Franz.
   Franz Josef took over a country that was so poor that the
government once tried in vain to mortgage the government-cum-prison
building. His father had once sold part of the family jewels to
bail the government out.
   The young prince, a nephew of Austrian Archduke Franz Ferdinand
whose assassination in Sarajevo triggered World War I, faced his
first challenge in 1938 after Austria became part of the Nazi Reich.
   He made history when he used his powers to force the formation
of a national coalition government after the ``anschluss,'' and
paid an official visit to Hitler in March 1939.
   The visit helped make the Nazis ``leave us alone because it
flattered Hitler's ego,'' he reminisced in an interview.
   He added that the Fuhrer, who was ``visibly ill at ease ... did
not make any impression at all,'' on him during the 90 minutes of
small talk in the Berlin Reich Chancellory. Like neighboring
Switzerland, Liechtenstein stayed neutral during World War II.
   After the war, Franz Josef led the country in resisting Soviet
demands to extradite some 500 Russians, including Grand Duke
Vladimir Cyrillovich, heir to the throne of All the Russias, who
had sought shelter in Liechtenstein.
   British historian Hugh Trevor-Roper said that Liechtenstein thus
was the only country which refused to join in what he called one of
the ``great betrayals.'' Franz Josef spoke of a ``proud chapter''
in his country's history.
   He lost extensive property in Czechoslovakia when it was
nationalized after the Communist takeover of the country.
   But the family's art collection of 1,400 Rubens, Van Dyck and
other old master paintings with a current estimated value of $150
million was saved by being moved from Austria to Liechtenstein in
1944.
   Despite his personal wealth, Franz Josef stuck to a simple
lifestyle that helped keep his name out of the gossip columns of
the international press.
   He was a devout Roman Catholic who started every day by
attending mass in the chapel at his 13th century castle perched 360
feet above Vaduz.
   While opposing any liberalization of the country's abortion
laws, he was an outspoken champion of women's rights and began
pressing for female suffrage in the 1950s. This was grudgingly
accepted by Liechtenstein's men in a 1984 referendum.
   He was a keen sportsman who served for more than 35 years on the
International Olympic Committee and even late in life enjoyed
downhill skiing each winter.

   A federal judge set May 15 for the third
trial of former FBI agent Richard W. Miller, accused of selling
documents to a Soviet agent.
   Miller was arrested in 1984 on espionage charges and remained in
custody until his release on bond last month.
   U.S. District Court Judge Robert M. Takasugi, who set the trial
date Monday, took over the case from U.S. District Court Judge
David V. Kenyon, who withdrew after overseeing the first two trials.
   A jury deadlocked in the first trial.
   Miller was convicted in the second trial and sentenced to two
life terms plus 50 years in federal prison. An appeals court
overturned the conviction, saying Kenyon improperly allowed
polygraph tests to be admitted as evidence.
   A Soviet emigre, Svetlana Ogorodnikov, and her husband, Nikolay,
entered guilty pleas in the case and are serving sentences in
federal prison.
   Defense attorneys argue Miller was attempting to revive his
flagging career with a misguided attempt to infiltrate the Soviet
espionage agency, the KGB.

<TEXT>
   Nynex Corp. said it had reached a tentative
accord with two unions to end the last of the strikes that began in
August against regional telephone companies around the country.
   The company said Monday that the Communications Workers of
America and the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers had
agreed to end the walkout that disrupted installation, repair and
directory assistance services to 10.5 million customers in New York
state and New England.
   However, CWA spokesman Steve Rosenthal insisted his union's
leaders had yet to approve the deal, which hinged on settlement of
a dispute over health care costs. The CWA negotiating committee was
scheduled to resume considering the accord today, he said.
   ``How the company wants to paint it is their business. We think
the statement was premature,'' Rosenthal said.
   The tentative three-year pact would raise wages 3 percent in the
first year and 1.5 percent in each succeeding year, said Nynex
spokesman Tony Pappas.
   It was the CWA's president, Morton Bahr, who first let slip in a
Washington, D.C., speech Monday that the two sides had resolved the
contentious issue of health insurance. The primary dispute was over
Nynex efforts to shift some costs presently borne by the company
onto workers.
   ``We have saved our health care,'' Bahr told an AFL-CIO
convention. ``There are no premiums.''
   Robert Silva, a spokesman for the IBEW in Boston, said the talks
progressed quickly after phone company officials agreed to continue
paying all health benefits.
   ``We look at it as a total victory,'' Silva said.
   About 60,000 workers in the two unions have been on strike for
100 days at Nynex subsidiaries New York Telephone and New England
Telephone, which serve New York, Connecticut, Rhode Island,
Massachusetts, New Hampshire, Vermont and Maine. CWA represents
40,000 New York workers and IBEW has 20,000 workers in New England.
   The bitter dispute, in which one striker died after being struck
by a car on a picket line and the company reported numerous
incidents of vandalism, began Aug. 6. At that time, 200,000 workers
struck four regional ``Baby Bell'' companies in 20 states,
including Nynex, Ameritech in the Midwest, Pacific Telesis in the
West and Bell Atlantic in the West.
   The other walkouts ended within weeks. Nynex was said to have
more to lose because its systems are in aging Eastern cities where
operating costs are higher.
   The company said the tentative pact was reached after it agreed
to pay all workers' health benefits and the unions agreed to give
up a bonus and profit-sharing plan that would have given them an
annual bonus of 1 percent of their annual pay.
   Nynex Chairman William C. Ferguson called the tentative accord
``a realistic solution to a very difficult set of issues facing not
only our company but the entire nation.''
   Nynex blamed the strike for a 14.8 percent decline in
third-quarter profits.

   A man arrested in the 1960 death of his former
girlfriend plans to plead guilty, hoping the judge will realize he
has changed in the interim and that ``not a day has gone by'' in
which he hasn't been torn by remorse.
   Robert Lee Mitchell, 64, of Chicago told reporters upon arrival
at Dallas-Fort Worth International Airport on Monday that he hopes
the judge will show him mercy.
   ``It was an accident. We were tussling over the gun and it went
off,'' Mitchell said.
   ``It happened and I'm sorry about it,'' he said. ``Not a day has
gone by since then that I didn't think about what happened.''
   ``But I have changed. My outlook has changed,'' he said. ``I
know about the things that mean something to a human being, the
real things in life _ like God, a family and treating your fellow
human being right, doing the best you can.''
   Mitchell is accused of killing Billie Marie Redmon Phillips in
September 1960. He moved to Chicago, where he has lived and raised
as a family as Billy Jackson.
   Mitchell told authorities he took the name Billy intentionally.
   ``She always meant a lot to me; we were together for 12 years,''
he said.
   Mitchell was jailed in the Lew Sterrett Justice Center today in
lieu of $100,000 bail on a murder charge.
   Prosecutors asked for the high bond because of Mitchell's
history.
   ``He's shown he's pretty good at disappearing,'' said Norm
Kinne, first assistant district attorney.
   Dallas County deputies were searching through some old arrest
warrants when they found the one for Mitchell. A check of FBI
fingerprint files showed that Jackson had the same prints as
Mitchell.
   Kinne had said earlier he might have Mitchell indicted under the
habitual criminal law, a move that would make a life sentence
possible.
   ``We still haven't decided for certain,'' Kinne said. ``But we
probably won't re-indict him. He hasn't been in too much trouble
for the last 28 years.''
   While living in Chicago, Mitchell married, worked 17 years at a
steel mill and raised five children. He has three grandchildren and
worked with others on his block to fight drug dealers.
   Mitchell said that no one, including his wife, knew about his
past until he was arrested earlier this month by the FBI.
   ``I thought about turning myself in two or three times, but then
I thought about the pain it would cause my family. So for that

   ``I always did figure they would catch me,'' he said. ``I wasn't
running. I lived in just one place. To tell you the truth, I'm glad
it's over.''
   Mitchell, who has not hired a lawyer and did not fight
extradition to Texas, says he wants to plead guilty and take the
consequences. He then would like to return to Chicago.
   ``That's who I am now,'' he said. ``Robert Mitchell is a
different person. I want to block that out of my mind completely
when this is over with. I want to get it over with and go back to
being Billy Jackson.''

   In another Navy mishap, two
military planes strayed outside a target range and bombed public
land, slightly injuring a camper and forcing others to dive for
cover.
   Camper Bob Koch of Hacienda Heights was hurt when struck on the
chest either by shrapnel or debris during the Saturday afternoon
incident about two miles outside the Navy's Chocolate Mountains
Bombing Range.
   ``I'll tell you,'' Koch said, ``it was the most frightening
experience I've ever had.''
   John Blachley, chief ranger of the federal Bureau of Land
Management's Palm Springs office, said he was informed that campers
were well within the ``killing zone'' of the bombs but may have
been saved because they were behind the paths of the bombs rather
than in front of them.
   The Navy is investigating the incident. The Los Angeles Times,
citing unidentified military sources, said human error is likely to
have been to blame in the bombing. No indication of mechanical or
technical failure was evident, the sources told the Times.
   The A-6 bombers, on a routine training mission from the Naval
Air Facility in El Centro, dropped a dozen 500-pound bombs on this
remote desert area 150 miles southeast of Los Angeles, said Mike
Ray, a spokesman for the El Centro base.
   The area, administered by the federal Bureau of Land Management,
is 30 miles from the nearest paved road and is not a formal
campground, Ray said. But it is frequented by campers and off-road
enthusiasts.
   ``It was unreal. It just pulverized the area,'' said Koch's
brother-in-law George Hurley, 46, of Moreno Valley.
   If the air crews are at fault, they could face punishment
ranging from a return to basic flight school to a loss of their
aviators' wings, said Lt. Cmdr. Mike John. He declined to release
the names of those under investigation, but said they served with
Navy Attack Squadron 42 based at Naval Air Station Oceana.
   ``This has happened before, and it will probably happen again,''
John said. He called the incident ``very unfortunate.''
   Saturday's incident was the second accidental bombing in the
area, Blachley said. A Navy plane dropped ``a couple of bombs''
about two miles from the site about two years ago, he said.
   The incident was the latest of several plaguing the Navy the
past two weeks _ another accidental bombing, a fatal ship
collision, a deadly plane crash aboard an aircraft carrier, a fire
at sea and two cases involving sailors who fell or were washed
overboard.
   Other recent Navy accidents include Sunday's collision of the
destroyer USS Kincaid and a merchant ship in the Gulf of Mexico, in
which five Navy crewmen were injured.

<TEXT>
   East Germany's punching of holes in
the Berlin Wall has stirred hope that the barbed wire and
fortifications dividing the Korean Peninsula will eventually
disappear.
   Awed and stunned South Koreans have watched television footage
of portions of the Wall being torn down and East Germans streaming
freely to the West.
   Newspapers and television stations have given exhaustive
coverage of the demise of the Wall along with a flood of editorials
and articles asking if the same thing could happen in Korea.
   But few observers believe there is any chance of a quick end to
the bitter confrontation between capitalist South Korean and the
communist north. Nor, say observers, is there much chance of any
swift opening of the Korean border.
   ``The Korean Peninsula as a whole falls ever farther behind as
the rest of the world moves on to a new post-Cold War mentality,''
said Edward Poitras, a noted expert on Korean affairs.
   Yang Sung-chul, a political analyst, said the Demilitarized Zone
dividing the two Koreas is now ``the last remaining Cold War
emblem'' and is not likely to disappear soon.
   Most North Koreans probably have not even been told about the
fall of the Berlin Wall or other reforms in East bloc countries,
observers said.
   Even as the United States, the Soviet Union and their European
allies and satellites move to reduce tension and scale back
military forces, North and South Korea are locked in a major
military build up.
   Both Koreas are spending billions of dollars to expand and
strengthen their armed forces. North Korea, with a population of
about 22 million people, is estimated to have the world's fifth
largest army with 1.25 million men.
   The Korean peninsula is the site of one of the world's greatest
military concentrations with 1.5 million heavily-armed troops on
both sides facing each other along the 100-mile DMZ, where border
clashes are common.
   The north was implicated in the 1987 bombing of a South Korean
airliner, which claimed the lives of 115 people aboard, and other
recent terrorist attacks.
   The two sides technically remain at war since no peace treaty
was signed at the end of the Korean War in 1953 after the north
invaded the south. The border is sealed tight with virtually no
contact and both sides claiming to be the one legitimate government
of all Korea.
   ``The Koreans fought a war and the Germans did not. There's a
lot of suspicion that still exists,'' said Billy Fullerton, a U.S.
Army analyst.
   Some 43,000 U.S. troops are based in South Korea under a mutual
defense treaty. U.S. and South Korean leaders say the American
forces are vital to prevent another Korean War despite some U.S.
Congressional calls for a reduction to save money.
   North Korea remains a rigid totalitarian regime under the
God-like rule of Kim Il Sung, who has dominated the country with a
vast personality cult since the late 1940s. The 77-year-old Kim has
designated his son, Kim Jung Il, as his political heir in what
would be world's first Communist dynasty.
   While the Soviet Union, China and other Communist nations have
undergone reform in recent years, North Korea has made no attempt
to move away from its oppressive political system even though its
economy has virtually collapsed.
   Most South Korean and U.S. observers say there is virtually no
chance of political change in North Korea while Kim Il Sung remains
in control. They say his son appears determined to continue the
system.
   For North Korea to emulate Soviet-style reform, some observers
say, would have been like Stalin ordering the dismantling of the
Iron Curtain in 1950.
   Alarmed by the wave of liberalization in other Communist
nations, Kim Il Sung, who rarely leaves his country, visited
Beijing earlier this month to consult with Chinese leaders on
opposing changes in the Communist world.
   Many South Koreans hope the changes in Communist nations
eventually will have an impact on even North Korea and that there
will be a reduction in tension that could one day end the division
of the peninsula.
   ``The force of an avalanche is too strong to resist forever,''
said The Korea Herald in a Nov. 12 editorial.

   Snow fell in North Dakota early today but most of the nation
enjoyed an Indian summer.
   Unseasonably warm weather prevailed from the southern Plains to
the southern and middle Atlantic Coast states. Temperatures in the
50s, 60s and 70s were reported in many cities east of the Rockies.
   Snow fell on Bismarck, N.D., and rain dampened parts of Alabama.
   On Monday, strong southerly winds ahead of a cold front crossing
the central United States helped push temperatures into the 70s as
far north as southern Michigan.
   Thirty-two cities reported record high temperatures for the
date, including Flint, Mich., where the high of 71 degrees was also
the warmest on record for so late in fall. Other cities with record
highs for the date included Buffalo, N.Y., at 68 degrees, and
Columbia, S.C., at 86 degrees.
   The high for the nation Monday was 90 degrees at McAllen, Texas.
   Showers and thunderstorms also developed over southern Texas,
southern Louisiana and southern Mississippi Monday. Rain dampened
the northern Pacific Coast, while snow fell on parts of Montana and
northern Maine.

   An exclusive country club concerned
with keeping its image off the chests of thousands stopped designer
Ralph Lauren from selling shirts emblazoned with a design similar
to the club's crest.
   U.S. District Court Judge Clyde Hamilton in Florence signed a
settlement Friday ordering Ralph Lauren Corp. to stop selling the
shirts with the disputed design, though he exempted those already
at retailers.
   Lauren must pay Pine Lakes International Country Club $100,000
in legal fees and an additional $250,000 as part of the settlement,
which did not assign any wrongdoing.
   Club president A. Sanford Miles, who called the suit a ``David
and Goliath'' conflict, said money was not the issue in the lawsuit.
   ``We were protecting the image of the club,'' Miles said. ``We
felt it had been a mark that represented us and our heritage and
prestige in the community.''
   The country club was established in 1927 and has a membership of
250. It prides itself on maintaining a Scottish flavor, with
employees dressed in Scottish kilts on its golf course serving
homemade clam chowder cooked in iron pots over open fires.
   Pine Lakes sued Ralph Lauren more than a year ago, charging the
club's 1971 trademark was violated. The Pine Lakes crest is used on
golf shirts, hats and blazers and is used in promoting the club.
   The 3-year-old Lauren logo has a crown above a circle within a
circle. In the center of the smaller circle are the letters ``RL.''
The design has been used on thousands of shirts.
   It is one of three labels that adorn shirts by Polo. The
top-selling shirt features a polo player on a pony and was not
involved in the suit.
   Pine Lakes' suit said the RL logo was ``confusingly and
deceptively similar'' to the club's crest.
   Polo disagreed, saying there was no trademark infringement.
   Lauren spokeswoman Nancy Aronson called the result a compromise.
She said the company had planned to stop selling shirts with the
disputed logo, but could not offer a reason.

   Sudden reforms in the Eastern bloc have historians
scrambling to replace old assumptions that are being eradicated as
quickly as sections of the Berlin Wall.
   History books already need updating to reflect last week's
stunning events in East Germany, and academics and their students
watch as each day's headlines make the previous day's reading
assignment obsolete.
   ``The rules are changing by the hour,'' Professor Carol Saivetz
of Harvard University's Russian Research Center said Monday. ``No
one is writing and no one is willing to commit themselves because
once you write a book it's out of date.''
   The East German government shocked the world, including many of
those who study the region's politics, with its announcement last
week that citizens were free to travel to the West.
   Suddenly the 28-year-old Berlin Wall, that ultimate Cold War
symbol, was being dismantled. The old Iron Curtain mentality that
permeates today's books on modern European history _ already
undercut by the thaw in U.S.-Soviet relations and other East bloc
reforms _ suffered a staggering blow.
   ``We're all sort of grappling with what to do next and how to
approach this area of the world that we've been teaching about for
years given the fast-paced changes that are going on,'' said
Saivetz, who also teaches political science at Tufts University.
   Edwin Gere, a historian at the University of Massachusetts in
Amherst, said his lesson plans were jolted this semester by the
events in East Germany, Czechoslovakia, Bulgaria and Hungary.
   ``Talk about changing the class curriculum,'' Gere said. ``We
were going to talk in the coming weeks about whether the wall would
ever come down. My God, we never had a chance to get to it.''
   The changes sweeping the region will affect cultural, political
and economic relationships with the West, academics said.
   ``It was almost inevitable that all these East European
communist regimes would explode one way or another,'' said Adam
Ulam, director of Harvard's Russian Research Center. ``But this has
been spectacular.''
   ``Different events have piled one on top of another with a
suddenness no one anticipated,'' said Boston University Professor
Walter D. Connor.
   He said, however, change in the Eastern bloc was inevitable
given domestic dissatisfaction and Soviet Premier Mikhail
Gorbachev's reforms.
   William Parker, a professor emeritus of economic history at Yale
University, said, ``It's too soon to know what eventually will
happen with such a free-floating situation.''
   But he predicted the Eastern bloc countries would now be a
factor in 1992, when Western European nations plan to drop their
trade barriers.
   ``It's conceivable that all those countries would float into a
common European market,'' Parker suggested.
   Philippe Schmitter, director of the Center for European Studies
at Stanford University, said that recent events would be
interpreted not just as a major step toward German re-unification
but also as part of Europe's unification.
   ``As of six months ago, the only thing my students were talking
about was 1992,'' Schmitter said, referring to the trade agreement.
``Now all of a sudden we have have to think about a whole new set
of combinations.''

<TEXT>
   An anti-busing school initiative narrowly passed
after absentee ballots were counted, but the school board head said
he was unsure whether the measure would be enacted.
   The ``Save Our Schools'' initiative that went before the voters
last Tuesday received 71,046 votes in favor, or 50.4 percent, to
69,911 against, or 49.6 percent, elections officials said Monday
after counting the ballots.
   Initiative 34 asks the school board to ban the busing of
students for racial balance; it does not require a ban. It says
that if the board agreed to stop busing, 6 percent of the city's
sales tax revenues _ about $4.5 million _ would be awarded to the
school district for improving school programs in an effort to
achieve integration voluntarily.
   ``I might call for the school board to vote on the initiative
Wednesday,'' Seattle School Board president T.J. Vassar said. ``But
maybe it might be better to allow the courts to rule it
unconstitutional.''
   Kathy Baxter, head of the pro-initiative forces, said supporters
will lobby the board to accept the measure.
   ``What we've been able to do by getting the initiative passed is
give the school board another tool to deal with busing,'' she said.
   If the board votes to accept the initiative, a lawsuit would be
filed against the school district by the American Civil Liberties
Union of Washington, the National Association for the Advancement
of Colored People and the Church Council of Greater Seattle, the
ACLU said in a statement Monday.
   The anti-busing initiative was a key issue in the mayor's race.
   It was drafted by three-term City Attorney Douglas N. Jewett,
who lost the race after using the issue as his main campaign
vehicle.
   Voters elected three-term City Council member Norman B. Rice,
who will be the city's first black mayor.

   A Wall Street skyscraper allegedly bought by
Ferdinand Marcos with money looted from the Philippine treasury was
auctioned off for $77 million.
   The 66-story office tower sold Monday is one of four New York
buildings owned by the late Philippine president and presently tied
up in an ownership dispute and in wrangling with the government of
his homeland.
   One of the other buildings, the Herald Center near Macy's
department store, sold last week for $25 million, and two other
buildings in prime locations are to be auctioned as well.
   The government of Philippine President Corzon Aquino is trying
to recover funds it accuses Marcos of spiriting out of the country
when he fled to Hawaii. He died in Honolulu in September.
   The tower at 40 Wall St. was sold at a foreclosure auction to a
group of investors led by real estate developer Burton J. Resnick,
who also was involved in a bid for the building in August.
   The previous bid of $108.6 million fell through when the buyers
were unable to come up with the money before an October closing
date.
   ``You just have a generally declining real estate market in
Manhattan, particularly in Wall Street,'' said Stephen Estroff, the
court-appointed special master in charge of the auction, explaining
the price difference.
   The bid was $77 million plus $100, just enough to top the bid
put in by the mortgage holder, Citibank, to ensure the purchase
price covered the bank's debts.

   Franz Josef II, Prince of
Liechtenstein, died Monday after a long illness at age 83.
   Franz Josef II was the 12th ruler of the 270-year-old nation,
last remnant of the ``Holy Roman Empire.''
   His 51 years as head of state spanned the rise of this tiny
democratic state from an underdeveloped and rural country to a
sophisticated industrialized nation with one of the world's highest
per-capita incomes.
   He took office in 1938, succeeding his uncle, Prince Franz.
   He made history when he used his powers to force the formation
of a national coalition government after Austria became part of the
Nazi Reich, and paid an official visit to Hitler in March 1939.
   After the war, Franz Josef led the country in resisting Soviet
demands to extradite some 500 Russians, including Grand Duke
Vladimir Cyrillovich, heir to the throne of All the Russias, who
had sought shelter in Liechtenstein.
   In 1984 he handed over his executive powers to his son, Hans
Adam. But he retained the ceremonial role of head of state, and
continued to meet many well-wishers every year during the
festivities marking his birthday on Aug. 16, a public holiday.

   Amnesty International said in a report today that
human rights have suffered a ``dramatic deterioration'' in parts of
Latin America in the last 1{ years, singling out Colombia, Peru,
Guatemala, and El Salvador.
   The international human rights group accused security forces in
Colombia of 2,500 political killings and blamed authorities in Peru
and Guatemala for the disappearances, torture, or execution of
hundreds.
   It appealed to the Organization of American States, whose
foreign ministers were meeting in Washington, to demonstrate the
political will to help eradicate ``abhorrent'' human rights
violations by government forces and paramilitary groups linked to
them.
   In its catalogue of allegations, Amnesty reported that since
1988:
   _ More than 2,500 civilians in Colombia have been unlawfully
killed for political reasons by the army and paramilitary forces
working for them, and more than 300 people have disappeared.
   _ Hundreds of Peruvians have disappeared, been tortured or
killed by government forces.
   _ In Guatemala, hundreds of victims reportedly disappeared or
were illegally executed by members of the security forces operating
in uniform or clandestinely in the guise of death squads.
   _ In El Salvador, now mired in some of the worst fighting of its
decade-old civil war, there was ``persuasive evidence'' that police
and military personnel carried out abductions, disappearances and
politically motivated killings attributed to death squads.
   Amnesty said it has also received reports this year of illegal
executions or disappearances in other countries in the region,
including Brazil and Nicaragua.
   It said several countries continued to use the death penalty,
which it considers cruel and unusual punishment.
   The group noted that so far this year, 14 prisoners have been
executed in the United States, and the death row population grew by
July to an unprecedented 2,210 inmates, including 28 juveniles.
   Amnesty said torture is widespread in Latin America and was
routinely reported in countries where counterinsurgency policies
resulted in patterns of grave human rights violations, including
Peru, Colombia, Guatemala and El Salvador.
   Amnesty said it was also concerned about torture reports from
Brazil, Chile, Ecuador, Mexico, Panama and Venezuela.
   It said political prisoners were being detained in Cuba and
Panama.
   Amnesty said it welcomed the decision by the Organization of
American States to draft an Inter-American Convention of Forced
Disappearance of Persons.
   It said such a document should prohibit secret detention;
require that detainees be held only in recognized places of
detention; and call for readily accessible, up-to-date registers of
detained people.
   Amnesty also said it was important that governments should not
take pre-trial measures to exonerate those accused in
disappearances.
   It expressed concern about the 1988 presidential pardon of
Argentine military officers charged with human rights violations.
It said the move effectively obstructed further investigation into
the disappearance of thousands of people under military governments
in the 1970s and early 1980s.

<HEAD>Shamir's Bloc Makes Advances in Union Elections</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir's right-wing
Likud bloc scored substantial gains in nationwide trade union
elections billed as a referendum on Likud's stance on Middle East
peace, returns showed today.
   However, the left-of-center Labor Party also claimed victory in
Monday's voting, saying it had cut Likud's momentum from recent
victories at the polls.
   Results released by Israel radio today showed that with more
than 90 percent of the vote counted, Likud won 27.5 percent, an
increase over its current 22 percent.
   Labor, Likud's partner in the coalition government, garnered
more than 55 percent support, just slightly more than its present
standing.
   The remaining votes went to three smaller left-wing parties.
   The elections were for leaders of the Histadrut Labor
Federation, a traditional Labor stronghold. The 1.5 million-member
organization helps determine Israeli labor policies and owns a
major chunk of the nation's farms and industries.
   Likud leaders claimed the electoral showing was a boost to
Shamir as he headed to Washington for talks with President Bush on
Wednesday about efforts to start Israeli-Palestinian peace talks.
   ``I can only say Likud has increased its strength in the
Histadrut by about 25 percent. This is a significant increase under
difficult conditions, in a game it is not used to playing in,''
Shamir said on the radio before boarding an airplane for his 11-day
U.S. trip.
   ``I think it is a serious achievement,'' Shamir added. ``I can
explain the addition to our strength on the basis of Likud's
political achievements.''
   Shamir had called the elections a national referendum on his
stance for talks with Palestinians which include an adamant refusal
to include the PLO in negotiations or trade territory for peace.
   Labor favors a more conciliatory approach, including withdrawing
from parts of the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip in exchange for
peace.
   Labor saw the results as a victory because it stopped a
worrisome electoral losing streak to Likud. The right-wing bloc has
won national and local elections in the past year.
   Analysts also noted that Likud fell short of its goal of
attaining one third representation on the Histadrut's governing
council, which would have meant blocking exclusive Labor control.
   Labor Party leader and Vice Premier Shimon Peres, interviewed
after television projections Monday night, claimed his party had
emerged victorious.
   ``This shows the public has given renewed confidence to the
Labor Party and we will reach new heights,'' he said.
   In the elections, about 1.5 million Israelis chose delegates to
the 1,501-member Histadrut Conference, which selects the
organization's governing board. Voter turnout was more than 50
percent, Israeli media reported.
   The Histadrut, which is Hebrew for ``union,'' was founded in
1920. It in effect helps formulate national employment policies by
negotiating nationally binding wage and pension agreements with the
government.

<TEXT>
   Iran's spiritual leader has appointed the
son of the late Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini as one of his
representatives in the newly formed Supreme National Security
Council, Tehran radio reported.
   The broadcast said Ayatollah Ali Khamenei on Monday appointed
Ahmad Khomeini to represent him in the council, for a term of three
years.
   The council is charged with overseeing defense and state
security policy as well as coordinating the activities of various
defense and intelligence bodies.
   According to the constitution, the council is under the
jurisdiction of President Hashemi Rafsanjani, a so-called
pragmatist opposed by the rival radical camp.
   In September, the president appointed Interior Minister Abdollah
Nouri to head the council. Last month he asked Hassan Rowhani, who
previously headed the parliamentary defense committee, to help set
it up.
   Rowhani was also appointed by Khamenei to the council on Monday.
   Rafsanjani, elected in July, has been trying to overhaul the
government to weed out radicals who oppose his liberal policies.
   The 56-year-old president believes in easing the government's
stranglehold on the economy, encouraging foreign investment to
boost the sluggish economy, and moderating Iran's radical image
abroad.
   But his rivals in the radical camp, headed by Ahmad Khomeini and
former Interior Minister Ali Akbar Mohtashemi, regard such changes
as anathema.
   Despite earlier speculation, Ahmad was not given any important
post in the new government. Similarly, Mohtashemi, the most
powerful figure among the radicals, was dropped from Rafsanjani's
new Cabinet.

<HEAD>State To Seek Death Penalty For Copelands</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOSH LEMIEUX</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>CHILLICOTHE, Mo. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The state will seek the death penalty
for a couple accused of killing three men they employed on their
northwestern Missouri farm.
   Ray Copeland, 75, and his 68-year-old wife Faye were charged
Monday at the Livingston County Courthouse with three counts of
first-degree murder.
   County Prosecutor Doug Roberts and Missouri Attorney General
William Webster announced the decision to seek the death penalty at
a news conference before the Copelands were arraigned in separate
proceedings.
   Asked why the state would seek an execution of an elderly
couple, Webster said: ``It isn't the death penalty because of the
age. It's the death penalty because of the alleged offenses here.''
   The decision to seek capital punishment in the case was based on
allegations that the victims were killed for money and to cover up
another crime, he said.
   The Copelands' public defenders accused Webster of mounting ``a
media event or even a media circus.''
   ``We both feel strongly that Ray and Faye's rights are being
severely compromised by the daily flood of baseless innuendo,
particularly in light of their frail health,'' said attorneys
Barbara Schenkenberg and David Miller.
   Miller represents Mrs. Copeland, and Ms. Schenkenberg represents
Copeland.
   The victims were killed with gunshots to the head and buried on
farms where Copeland had done odd jobs for several years. Police
have said the men were transients who Copeland hired to buy cattle
with bad checks.
   The Copelands were not charged Monday for the death of a fourth,
unidentified man whose body was found in another barn more than a
week after the Oct. 16 discoveries of the first three bodies.
Prosecutors were reviewing evidence in the fourth case.
   Sheriff Leland O'Dell said a search for nine more former
Copeland employees would continue in the county. About 100 sites
already have been searched, he said.
   The Copelands were charged Oct. 9 with conspiracy to steal
cattle with bad checks from an account set up in August for an
employee. The conspiracy charge was dismissed Monday.
   At the arraignment, bond was set at $500,000 for each. A joint
preliminary hearing was scheduled Nov. 29.
   Copeland was emotionless and silent; his wife sobbed throughout
her separate proceeding and tried to make a statement before being
dissuaded by Miller, her attorney.
   The victims were Paul J. Cowart, 21, of Dardanelle, Ark., John
W. Freeman, 27, of Tulsa, Okla., and Jimmie Dale Harvey, 27, of
Springfield, Mo.
   Harvey's mother, Ann H. Netherton, filed a wrongful death suit
Monday alleging the Copelands ``knowingly, willfully and
wrongfully'' shot and killed her son.
   ``I feel very sad because it's all so senseless,'' Mrs.
Netherton said. ``He was a nice guy. He wouldn't have hurt
anybody.''
   The suit seeks damages, but does not specify them.
   Rose Marshall, Freeman's mother, said she found no solace in the
state's decision to seek the death penalty.
   ``There couldn't be justice,'' she said. ``They could never
replace my boy.''

<HEAD>Former East German Leader Recovering After Operation</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Former East German leader Erich Honecker, whose
fall from power spurred three weeks of breathtaking changes in his
country, is in poor health and being treated at his home, a
government newspaper said today.
   ``My husband is sick, that means he has not yet recovered,'' the
Communist youth newspaper Young World quoted Honecker's wife,
Margot, as saying.
   Honecker's resignation Oct. 18 ushered in whirlwind changes in
East Germany, including freedom to travel to the West and promises
of free elections. Egon Krenz, 52, was picked to replace the
ailing, 77-year-old hard-liner.
   Honecker underwent gallbladder surgery in August and made no
public appearance until early October, when he led 40th anniversary
celebrations of the founding of East Germany.
   Following Honecker's resignation, West German news media
reported his condition worsened and that he had been hospitalized.
   Young World quoted Mrs. Honecker, East Germany's former
education minister, as saying her husband was being cared for at
their home outside East Berlin.
   ``He is not hospitalized but at home, where he is being
medically cared for,'' the newspaper quoted Mrs. Honecker as saying.

   Ambassadors from the Soviet Union and China
today joined a steady stream of people who paid their last respects
to Dolores Ibarruri, a Communist leader from the Spanish Civil War.
   Ibarruri, the daughter of Basque coal miners whose fiery oratory
made her an anti-fascist heroine to millions during the 1936-1939
war, died Sunday in a Madrid hospital at age 93.
   Spanish Communist Party spokesman Juan Berga said crowds began
lining up outside the party's headquarters early today to file by
the open casket containing the body of the Ibarruri, who was known
by the nickname by her nickname ``La Pasionaria.''
   Other dignitaries included the ambassadors of Yugoslavia, Poland
and Cuba, and Culture Minister Jorge Semprun, Berga said.
   Ibarruri's body was to lie in state until Thursday, when party
leaders have scheduled a commemorative rally in downtown Madrid.
Burial is scheduled later that day at a municipal cemetery beside
the tomb of Spanish Socialist Party founder Pablo Iglesias.

   A powerful explosion ripped through
the national headquarters of the election commission today, five
days before a controversial referendum on Moslem autonomy. Police
said one person was killed.
   Police said the 7:05 p.m. blast damaged the left side of the
Commission on Elections building, destroying four rooms. The blast
also damaged windows in the nearby Manila Roman Catholic cathedral.
   A parttime maintenance man was killed, police said. Officials
said several employees were working overtime in the building at the
time of the explosion.
   There were no arrests and no one claimed responsibility. But
police said two passersby were taken into custody for questioning.
   Commission officials had requested additional security at the
building because of reports that Moslems planned a demonstration
there Wednesday to protest the upcoming referendum on regional
autonomy for Mindanao and other southern islands.
   On Sunday, voters in 13 southern provinces and nine cities will
decide whether to join an autonomous regional government aimed at
satisfying demands for self-rule by the estimated 4 million
Filipino Moslems and ending a nearly 20-year-old Islamic revolt.
   But critics and supporters of the autonomy plan, approved by
Congress and signed by President Corazon Aquino in August, fear it
may fall short of its goals and anger both Christians and Moslems.
   The Moro National Liberation Front, the main Moslem rebel
organization, has opposed the autonomy plan as inadequate.
   In Jiddah, Saudi Arabia, Front leader Nur Misuari claimed
President Corazon Aquino's government was setting the stage for a
``genocidal war'' against Filipino Moslems.
   The Front has been waging a nearly 20-year insurgency to
establish a separate state in Mindanao and other southern islands.
A cease-fire with the government has been in effect since Mrs.
Aquino met Misuari in 1986 on the island province of Sulu.
   Before the Moslem rebellion peaked in the mid-1970s, an
estimated 50,000 people were killed and thousands more fled for the
nearby Malaysian state of Sabah.

   A state appeals court turned aside defense
objections and allowed a second black to remain on the jury for
today's start of the manslaughter trial of a policeman in the
shooting of a black motorcyclist.
   The court Monday upheld the decision of Circuit Judge Joseph
Farina, who maintained the defense opted to exclude the juror
illegally on the basis of race. Farina seated the juror Friday even
though defense attorneys have a right, known as peremptory
challenge, to exclude jurors without showing cause.
   The appeals court said there was no need to dissolve the
six-member jury and start the painstaking selection process all
over again.
   ``Obviously I'm happy that we're able to proceed,'' said
prosecutor John Hogan. ``We think it's a fair jury.''
   Hogan said the session would begin this afternoon, although
opening arguments may not start until Wednesday because of pretrial
motions and problems with sequestering a jury.
   The ruling came after three weeks of jury selection in the case
of officer William Lozano, who is charged in the slaying of the
motorcyclist and the death of his passenger in an ensuing crash
Jan. 16. The incident set off three days of riots.
   Lozano's attorney, Roy Black, accepted one black juror and
strenuously denied that race was behind his trying to exclude the
second black juror, Ezra Simmons.
   Black said he wanted Simmons excluded because, as a union
representative, Simmons defended workers fired for alleged drug
abuse. The defense intends to emphasize the victims' drug use to
support its contention that Lozano shot Clement Lloyd, 23, in
self-defense because the motorcyclist was trying to run him over.
   With Simmons, the jury consists of two blacks, one Hispanic and
three non-Hispanic whites.
   The issue of race has hung over the case since the shooting.
Three times in the 1980s, the killing of black men by white
officers or the officers' acquittals on similar charges have
sparked rioting in the Miami area.

   The familiar thump of the newspaper landing on
the doorstep may give way to the beep and hum of the fax machine
for some of the far-flung readers of The New York Times and The
Journal of Commerce.
   Both papers announced Monday they were joining the growing
number of newspapers that transmit abbreviated editions via
facsimile machine the day before publication.
   The Times said it would fax a four- to six-page newspaper to
subscribers in the Far East beginning in January. The service, to
be called Times Fax, will be a compilation of news, features and
editorials.
   The newspaper said the venture is geared to businesses and
travelers in Japan and would be sent the evening before the paper
is published. It will include shorter versions of top stories in
the newspaper.
   ``This service will reach people in parts of the world that
currently cannot receive the Times on a timely basis,'' said Times
Publisher Arthur Ochs Sulzberger.
   The price of the faxed paper, which won't contain advertising,
has yet to be determined, said Times spokeswoman Nancy Nielsen.
   Targeted subscribers include Japanese brokerages, banks and
other financial institutions, Japanese and U.S. companies and
hotels.
   The Journal of Commerce, which calls itself the nation's oldest
daily business newspaper, said it began a facsimile service
available in the United States and Europe on Monday.
   The two- to three-page edition, dubbed Datafax, is a summary of
news in the paper and is transmitted daily around 3 p.m. EST, the
newspaper said.
   After 3{ months of promotional discounts and free service, The
Journal of Commerce service will cost $650 domestically and $1,057
in Europe.
   The Journal of Commerce, which is owned by Knight-Ridder Inc.,
specializes in world trade and transportation news. It has a
circulation of about 25,000 nationwide.
   USA Today and The Hartford Courant have been selling facsimile
editions for some time, while other newspapers reportedly are
planning to do so.

<TEXT>
   The ruling Politburo has summoned the entire
Communist leadership of Lithuania to a meeting that likely will
press Kremlin efforts to rein in the Baltic republic's drive for
sovereignty, legislators said today.
   The Politburo of the Baltic republic's Communist Party will
travel to Moscow on Wednesday, but there was no immediate detail on
what would be discussed. The Politburo normally meets on Thursdays.
   Lithuanian sources said Moscow may want to discuss calls for the
republic's party to declare itself independent from the national
party, a series of laws that the Kremlin declared unconstitutional
on Friday, or to head off an attempt to follow Baltic neighbor
Estonia in annulling the 1940 decision to join the Soviet Union.
   Soviet Foreign Ministry spokesman Yuri D. Gremitskykh, asked
about the report at a news briefing, said he had no information but
that it was not unusual for a republic's entire party leadership to
attend a Politburo session.
   Eduardas Vilkas, a deputy of the Supreme Soviet parliament, said
he thought the topic would be proposals that the Lithuanian party
declare itself independent from the national Communist Party.
   That topic is to be discussed at a congress of the Lithuanian
party scheduled for Dec. 19.
   Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev has criticized suggestions
that the Communist Party in the republics spin off into independent
organizations.
   Kazimieras Motieka, a second deputy, said the topic might be a
declaration by the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet parliament
canceling several decisions at the heart of the drive by republics
for more political, cultural and economic autonomy.
   The Presidium declared that laws passed by Lithuania, Latvia,
and Estonia in the Baltics as well as Azerbaijan in the southern
Caucasus region giving them the right to veto national laws,
violate the Soviet Constitution.
   Lithuanian law that restricts republic citizenship to those who
lived there when the law was passed earlier this year, have a
permanent job or means of subsistence also violate the
constitution, it declared.
   It also found that laws adopted by the three Baltic states that
make Lithuanian, Latvian and Estonian the official language in the
respective republics violate the rights of some people to hold a
wide range of jobs.
   The Presidium urged the republics to rewrite their laws.

<HEAD>Lawyer in Tawana Brawley Case Fails to Appear Before Disciplinary
Committee</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A lawyer accused of misconduct for his role in
the Tawana Brawley case failed to appear before a disciplinary
panel and risks suspension.
   Alton Maddox had been ordered to appear Monday before the
grievance committee. But he said it was unethical and
unconstitutional for the committee to force him to disclose
information he had obtained as Miss Brawley's lawyer.
   Miss Brawley claimed she was abducted and raped by six white men
in 1987. A grand jury concluded last fall after a seven-month
investigation that the black teen-ager had made up the story.
   On advice from Maddox, attorney C. Vernon Mason and the Rev. Al
Sharpton, Miss Brawley did not cooperate with police or grand jury
investigations. Maddox claimed authorities were engaged in a racist
cover-up.
   Attorney General Robert Abrams, the special prosecutor in the
case, filed a complaint charging that Maddox and Mason knowingly
made false statements, helped the Brawley family in illegal
conduct, told them to leave the state to evade the law, and
obstructed justice.
   Charges also were filed against Maddox by a prosecutor
implicated in the attack by Maddox without substantiation.
   Robert Straus, chief counsel to the committee, said lawyers
``have an obligation to cooperate with investigators, and an
attorney who does not cooperate is guilty of professional
misconduct, whether or not the underlying allegations are proven.''
   The committee, an agency of the state Supreme Court, can apply
to the court to have a lawyer suspended for failing to cooperate,
he said.
   Maddox said he expected the committee would begin suspension
proceedings against him.
   Serious allegations of misconduct can result in disbarment.

   Chancellor Helmut Kohl of West Germany
laid a wreath at the Auschwitz death camp today after assuring
Polish lawmakers that a reunified Germany would not threaten Polish
security.
   Later, Kohl and Solidarity Prime Minister Tadeusz Mazowiecki
signed a declaration that opens the way for greater economic and
political cooperation and repeats West German commitments to
respect Poland's western border.
   The 78-point document aims to ``heal the wounds of the past
through understanding and reconciliation.'' Leaders expressed hope
for a new chapter in relations between West Germany and Poland, led
by the first non-Communist government in the East bloc.
   At Auschwitz, Kohl laid the flowers at the ``wall of death,''
where the Nazis had prisoners of different nationalities shot, and
another in Birkenau where crematoriums incinerated the bodies of
millions of Hitler's victims.
   He did not speak. Polish television broadcast part of the visit
live to the nation to somber music of Chopin.
   Kohl was accompanied by Heinz Galinski, head of the West German
Jewish Community Council; and Poland's only rabbi, Menachem
Joskowicz of Warsaw. At least 2.5 million Jews were among the
victims at Auschwitz and Birkenau.
   A small group of people held up banners outside the camp saying
``Victims of the war demand compensation,'' and ``All of Germany is
responsible for the crime of genocide and the plunder of Poland and
Europe.''
   Kohl was not the first West German leader to visit Auschwitz;
Chancellor Helmut Schmidt visited the camp in 1977.
   But Kohl's five-day trip, which ends today, comes at a time of
tremendous upheaval in the East bloc and less than a week after
East German's Communist leaders punched holes in the Berlin Wall
and let their people travel freely to the West.
   The rapid pace of change in East Germany, where lawmakers on
Monday endorsed opposition calls for free elections, has prompted
serious discussion about prospects for a reunified Germany.
   The idea worries many Poles and West German officials have
sought during Kohl's visit to allay fears that a reunified Germany
would threaten Polish security.
   They have told their Polish hosts that such a Germany would
respect a 1970 treaty that pledges Bonn to respect the Oder and
Neisse rivers as Poland's western border.
   Some West German conservatives have suggested that reunification
be sought within 1937 borders, which encompass about one-third of
Poland.
   Speaking Monday to Polish lawmakers, Kohl stressed that a
reunified Germany would not be a threat to Poland because it would
be part of a new European order based on cooperation and respect
for freedom.
   Kohl's remarks were reported by Senate Marshal Andrzej
Stelmachowski, a Solidarity adviser.
   Stelmachowski said Kohl told the lawmakers that ``In general, he
thinks that the process of reunification would be a process
connected with the general process of unification of Europe, and
the 21st century would not be a time of national states.''
   Stelmachowski said he was ``satisfied'' with Kohl's appearance.

   Authorities today investigated the procedural
lapses that resulted in the slaying of two detectives by a prisoner
riding alone in the back in their car with a gun stolen from a
police locker, police said.
   The inmate, Stoney Harrison, 25, was recaptured at his
girlfriend's house shortly before midnight Monday, 10 hours after
the shootings, said Sgt. Mary Wrensen.
   Detectives Keith L. Williams, 34, and Richard J. Guerzon, 46,
were slain near LaGuardia Airport while driving Harrison back to
the Rikers Island prison.
   The detectives had driven Harrison to a prosecutor's office to
take a lie detector test and discuss a plea bargain.
   Police believe Harrison stole a gun from a detective squad
locker in the district attorney's office, where he had been left
unattended for a short time Monday.
   On the way back to Rikers, Harrison was seated alone in the back
seat, with the two detectives in front _ a violation of police
procedure, said Police Commissioner Richard Condon.
   Authorities said the detectives' car was pulled over to the side
of the highway before the shots were fired. Guerzon, who had been
driving, was shot twice in the head; Williams was shot twice in the
back and once in the head.
   Witnesses said they saw Harrison drag the driver out of the car
and into the roadway. He then got back in the car but ran off after
failing to start the engine.
   Harrison was handcuffed when the detectives put him into the
car, but witnesses said he had somehow managed to remove the cuffs.
A pair of handcuffs was found in the front seat.
   Police said Harrison has an extensive criminal record dating
back to 1984, including drug and assault charges. In 1985, he was
sentenced to a year in jail for biting off a girlfriend's ear.
   He was charged in July with strangling another girlfriend, and
in October, Harrison and his mother were arrested on charges of
conspiring to murder a witness against him in the July murder. He
allegedly had his mother offer $2,000 to a hit man who turned out
to be an undercover detective.
   The last time two New York police officers were killed in the
same incident was in April 1978, when two officers were slain in a
gunfight with occupants of a car they stopped.

   The new premier today began talks aimed
at forming a government to end Lebanon's 14-year-old civil war, but
a defiant general warned Christian leaders about cooperating with
Moslem politicians.
   ``Those who take part in the (Salim) Hoss' Cabinet better stay
in Hoss land,'' Gen. Michel Aoun, leader of Christian forces, was
quoted as saying by the independent newspaper An-Nahar.
   Aoun, 54, a Maronite Catholic, controls most of the
310-square-mile Christian enclave northeast of Beirut.
   Four Maronite Parliament deputies held a meeting in the northern
Batroun province, outside the area of control of Aoun's 20,000
troops, to decide whether to take part in the new government.
   The four included Phalangist leader George Saadeh, the main
Christian negotiator in 23 days of parliamentary deliberations at
Taif, Saudi Arabia, last month which produced a peace pact to end
the civil war.
   Aoun has rejected the Taif accord because it failed to include a
clear timetable for the withdrawal of Syria's 40,000 troops from
Lebanon.
   Fearing Aoun's wrath, most Christian legislators who
participated in the Taif talks have not returned to the Christian
enclave.
   Parliament deputies met at an airbase in Syrian-policed north
Lebanon Nov. 4 to ratify the Taif accord and elect Rene Mouawad
president.
   Mouawad, 64, also a Maronite, named Hoss on Monday to form a
National Reconciliation government representing all the warring
factions in Lebanon with the objective of ending the civil strife.
   Aoun rejected Mouawad's election and declared opposition to
Hoss' government, which he said ``will be an unconstitutional
government.
   ``It will not be a national reconciliation government. It will
represent one side,'' Aoun said. ``Even if the whole world
recognizes it, Hoss' Cabinet will be a government operating in the
shadow of Syrian occupation.
   ``Governments cannot survive only on foreign recognition.
Peoples topple governments,'' Aoun warned.
   Aoun, in an interview with The Associated Press, said his ``war
of liberation'' against the Syrians was ``continuing, through
political and diplomatic means.
   ``I will stand fast until Syria explodes from within,'' he said.

   Former Attorney General Edwin Meese
III says he will take the media to task for what he calls
inaccurate reporting about him and the Iran-Contra affair in a book
he is writing.
   The book, to be published next year, will counter errors
reported about him during his 3{ years as the nation's top
prosecutor and ``set the record straight'' on Iran-Contra, Meese
said.
   ``Some of the worst reporting was in the Iran-Contra affair,''
Meese said before speaking Monday at Southern Illinois University.
   About a dozen people wearing rubber pig noses demonstrated
during his appearance, chanting, ``Let's steal money. Let's tell
lies. Guess who we are. Meese in disguise.''
   Some faculty members also protested Meese's appearance at the
university and the $8,000 fee for his speech.
   Meese stepped down in 1988 amid allegations he had violated
ethical standards in his financial affairs. Some also accused him
of botching the investigation of the Iran-Contra affair.

<DATELINE>BUDAPEST, Hungary (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Foreign Minister Gyula Horn said in an
interview published today that opponents of change could sabotage
reform efforts in East bloc countries by exploiting the disgruntled
masses.
   Hungary, Poland and the Soviet Union have been at the forefront
of East bloc reform, but the rapid changes in East Germany and the
recent leadership change in Bulgaria have left only Czechoslovakia
and Romania still resisting political reform.
   Even Czechoslovakia today, however, substantially loosened
travel restrictions on its citizens.
   In an interview with the government daily Magyar Hirlap, Horn
said the Warsaw Pact countries ``who want to carry out reform have
attained genuine majority.''
   The changes in East Germany reinforced Hungarian reforms, he
said, but he cautioned against being ``overly optimistic,'' saying
``there are still too many dangers lurking in wait.''
   ``I consider (the) economy in every Warsaw Treaty member state
to be in a critical state, which is a serious source of danger,''
Horn said, noting that economic reforms would take years to have an
effect.
   ``Disappointed and resigned people who are in a state of apathy
and cannot directly feel the effects of political changes on their
own living conditions can be easily exploited by the political
circles that want to slow down or halt transformation,'' Horn said.
   ``This is the gravest danger,'' he added.

   A group that fought a guerrilla war
with South Africa finished first in elections that will lead
Namibia to independence, but failed to win enough voes to claim
total power, unofficial results showed today.
   Thousands of people who were pleased that the South-West Africa
People's Organization at least won a majority thronged the streets
of the capital and adjoining townships today, waving flags, singing
and honking horns.
   ``We are very happy. We struggled all the years for this day,''
said Sam Nujoma, president of the black nationalist group.
   With figures in from all 23 districts, SWAPO won 331,597 votes,
about 57 percent of 577,974unchallenged votes cast. Its main rival,
the Democratic Turnhalle Alliance, won 165,230 votes, or about 28
percent. The remaining votes were split between eight smaller
parties.
   Authorities were reviewing 96,281 ballots to determine their
validity. But even if SWAPO won all the questioned votes, it would
fall short of its target of a two-thirds majority.
   At stake in the election, conducted last week under U.N.
supervision, were 72 seats in an assembly that will write a
constitution and declare independence for Namibia sometime next
year after 74 years of South African rule.
   SWAPO's leaders had predicted their leftist movement, which took
up arms against South Africa in 1966, would easily win the
two-thirds majority that would have enabled it to write the
constitution without consulting other parties.
   Instead, it will need to bargain with its rivals, notably the
Democratic Turnhalle Alliance, a multi-racial coalition that served
in the South African-installed transitional government and favors a
capitalist economy.
   The unofficial results were disclosed by election officials
prior to the final certification by the head of the U.N. monitoring
force, Martti Ahtisaari. Only after the official figures are
announced will the exact breakdown of assembly seats be known.
   SWAPO had trailed the Democratic Turnhalle Alliance throughout
the counting process, which began Monday morning, and only overtook
its rival with the tallying of votes from the last of the 23
districts _ the heavily populated northern region of Ovambo,
SWAPO's stronghold.
   There, according to the unofficial returns, SWAPO polled 197,100
votes to 9,200 for the alliance, leapfrogging into the lead.
   In addition to the two frontrunners, only two of the other
parties appeared assured of winning seats in the assembly. These
were the United Democratic Front, not related to the South African
anti-apartheid group of the same name, and the all-white Action
Christian National.
   About 6 percent of Namibia's 1.3 million people are white.
   After the polls closed Saturday, Ahtisaari formally declared the
five-day election ``free and fair'' in terms of the U.N.
requirements.
   He said the 95 percent turnout of registered voters ``has given
the whole world an exemplary lesson in democracy.''
   SWAPO officials on Monday agreed that the elections were free
but said they still had questions about the fairness. They said
some of the ballot boxes that arrived in Windhoek did not have the
U.N. seal on them as required.
   Territorial election officials denied any such irregularities.
   South Africa captured the territory from Germany in World War I
and ruled it under a League of Nations mandate subsequently
rescinded by the United Nations.
   South Africa refused U.N. orders to withdraw from the territory
until an agreement was signed in December which also provided for
Cuban troops to leave neighboring Angola.

   Nathan W. Shock, the father of modern research
on aging, has died of cancer at age 83.
   The former scientific director of the National Institutes of
Health's National Institute on Aging died Sunday at Francis Scott
Key Medical Center.
   Among the areas he and his colleagues studied was the aging of
the heart, kidneys, lungs, nerves and brain. They tracked the
different rates at which parts of the body age, and found that
people age at vastly different rates.
   Shock came to Baltimore in 1941 and joined the NIH's first
research program on aging. He directed the government's pioneering
Gerontology Research Center, and was scientific director of the
National Institute on Aging for a year, retiring in 1976.
   In 1958, he began the Baltimore Longitudinal Study on Aging,
which has studied more than 1,800 volunteers who visit the research
center every few years for a myriad of tests.
   A native of Lafayette, Ind., he earned an bachelor's degree in
chemical engineering and a master's from Purdue University. He
earned a doctorate in physiological psychology from the University
of Chicago.
   Survivors include two sons, a sister, seven grandchildren and
two great-grandchildren.
   A memorial service will be held Nov. 26.

   State troopers stormed a southern
Brazil prison today and ended a siege by inmates, killing eight
prisoners and freeing 39 hostages, police said.
   Fifty troopers rushed into the Curitiba prison with guns blazing
after prisoners killed one hostage and injured three others, said
Sgt. Ericu Gilberto Cassou Miller. Curitiba is 525 miles southwest
of Rio.
   He also said 13 inmates were injured during the battle.
   ``We were forced to invade because there were no grounds to
negotiate, and they were threatening the hostages,'' Miller said.
   He said the prisoners, who were armed with pistols, knives and
iron clubs, had demanded machine guns and an armored car for a
getaway.
   The siege began Monday when eight prisoners who worked in the
prison kitchen seized 40 employees, including the director, vice
director and several psychologists, Miller said.
   About 20 other prisoners joined the revolt after the hostages
were taken, Miller said.
   He said negotiations were conducted until early this morning,
when police invaded.
   The prison director, Aldamar Martins Filho, was one of those
injured. He was hospitalized with knife injuries but expected to
survive, Miller said.
   The dead hostage was not immediately identified.

   The vice president of the European
Community today urged Western industrialized nations to increase
their aid to East bloc countries to hasten moves toward democracy.
   ``It's clear that what's happening in Eastern Europe will have
enormous impact on Europe, on East-West relations and on the rest
of the world,'' said Frans Andriessen as trade talks ended here.
   Andriessen told reporters that Western nations should ``try to
support as much as we possibly can, economic and political
development in those countries.'' He cited Poland, Hungary and East
Germany.
   French President Francois Mitterrand has invited his 11 European
Community partners to dinner in Paris Saturday to discuss the rush
of events in Eastern Europe and how the West should respond.
   Andriesson, who is responsible for coordinating Western economic
aid to the region, said Monday he hoped to visit East Germany
before the end of the year to ``get support for the tendency to
democracy'' in that country.
   He played down speculation on granting European Community
membership to East Germany, which has just opened its borders to
the West, but he said the trading bloc would probably adopt a
favorable ``low-key, commercial agreement'' with the country.
   In a brief meeting today with Japan's minister of international
trade, Hikaru Matsunaga, he said urgent action was needed to help
relieve the economic crisis in Poland, EC spokesman Nico Wegter
said.
   He said the European Community _ the umbrella organizaton of the
European Economic Community _ hoped to gain support of other
Western nations for a $210 million ``food supply action'' in early
1990 to supplement a current food aid project.
   ``We as the EC consider our role as both a coordinating one and
a stimulating one. We would like to inspire all partners to
contribute,'' Wegter said.
   The EC food aid program is supplying cereal, meat, fruit and
olive oil to Poland, which faces a severe food shortage. Revenues
from sales of the food are put into a fund for long-term
improvement of Poland's ailing agricultural industry, Wegter said.
   Andriessen, who is responsible for coordinating EC aid to
Eastern Europe, was in Japan to attend trade talks between the
United States, Canada, Japan and the EC linked to the General
Agreement on Tariffs and Trade.
   Wegter said Andriessen was pleased that Matsunaga wanted to
discuss Eastern Europe, but neither side discussed specific aid
proposals.
   Japan is reportedly considering an aid package worth more than
$100 million for Poland, but officials have refused comment.
   In addition to the food supply program, the EC also plans a $210
million economic package for Poland and Hungary that involves
investment promotion, environmental action, market access and
worker training, Wegter said.

<HEAD>Students Cheer Dartmouth Decision to Divest South African Investments</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HANOVER, N.H. (AP) </DATELINE>

   Anti-apartheid protesters cheered Dartmouth
College's decision to stop investing in companies that do business
in South Africa.
   ``It was inevitable that the trustees divest. All credit should
be given to students, faculty and community members who have
applied pressure for the past 20 years,'' said Gamal Abouali, a
senior who protested Dartmouth's investments.
   The Ivy League school announced Monday it will sell by the end
of the year its $11.5 million in investments in companies doing
business in South Africa.
   The undergraduate faculty council voted unanimously in 1988 to
call on trustees to divest completely within a year. However, the
decision came unexpectedly at a weekend trustees' meeting at which
divestment was not on the agenda.
   Dartmouth President James Freedman read the decision at a
faculty meeting to cheers from the 250 to 300 students present.
   The trustees said in a statement that the investments have
``great symbolic meaning'' and the continuing dispute over them
``undermine Dartmouth's ability to achieve some of its educational
goals.''
   The board noted that Dartmouth's investments in companies doing
business with South Africa have declined from 15 percent, or $63
million, of its endowment in 1985 to less than 2 percent this year.
   The college already had accepted prohibitions against
investments in South African firms, financial institutions making
loans to the South African government, companies supplying goods
and services involved in the enforcement of apartheid and firms
doing business in South Africa that didn't adhere to certain
employment policies.
   In 1985, students built shanties on campus to protest apartheid.
In 1986, 12 students attacked the shanties with sledgehammers. A
confrontation over moving the shanties off campus resulted in 18
arrests.

<TEXT>
   Banners praising Pakistan's
traditional close ties with China heralded Premier Li Peng's
arrival today for his first official trip abroad since the June
crackdown on pro-democracy students.
   Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto greeted Li at Islamabad Airport to
the boom of a 21-gun salute.
   His talks with Ms. Bhutto, President Ghulam Ishaq Khan and other
Pakistani officials are expected to center on the 11-year-old war
in neighboring Afghanistan.
   Another of Pakistan's close allies, the United States, has
proposed sanctions against China in response to the People's Army's
violent suppression of a democracy movement in June.
   But Pakistan, which has not publicly criticized Beijing's
leaders, has refused trade or diplomatic embargoes over the
crackdown.
   Pakistan was the first country to recognize the People's
Republic after its emergence in 1949. Karachi was its first
international air link. Ms. Bhutto's first official trip after
taking office last December was to Beijing.
   Light poles and buildings fluttered today with banners bearing
slogans such as ``The people of Pakistan highly respect their
friend Li Peng,'' and ``Pak-China friendship is stronger and higher
than the Karakorams,'' the rugged mountain range along their common
border.
   Li won a power struggle with former Communist Party chief Zhao
Ziyang during the crackdown. Zhao was sympathetic to the protesters
and Li advocated a hard line.
   Beijing and Washington both are military sponsors of Pakistan,
which with their help supports Afghan anti-communist rebels who
have fought successive Soviet-backed governments in Kabul.
   Pakistan has taken in 3.5 million Afghan war refugees since 1979
when Soviet soldiers intervened in the bloody civil war. Moscow
completed the withdrawal of some 103,000 combat troops from
Afghanistan last Feburary, in line with a United Nations accord.
   Although U.S. supplies continue to flow to the rebels via
Pakistan, China has since plugged its weapons pipeline. The Kremlin
continues to supply the Afghan government.
   Local English-language newspapers proclaiming Li's arrival made
no mention of June's Tiananmen Square attack in Beijing, where
hundreds and possibly thousands died in a military assault on
pro-democracy demonstrators.

<TEXT>
   Negotiators from the Senate and House
deadlocked today on whether catastrophic medical coverage for
retirees should be scaled back sharply or repealed outright.
   House conferees insisted on repeal of the year-old program, just
as the full House had done. Senate negotiators, seeing no movement
from the House, responded by insisting that the provision of the
law covering hospital costs be retained.
   ``We haven't made any progress on catastrophic,'' Sen. Lloyd
Bentsen, D-Texas, chairman of the Senate negotiators, told
reporters. He assailed the Bush administration for taking a
hands-off position on the issue.
   ``I frankly don't see the White House exercising any leadership
on catastrophic,'' Bentsen said. ``I don't know where they are. I'd
be delighted to find out.''
   The administration took the same stand earlier this year when
the House and Senate battled over the fate of the landmark medical
insurance program. At one point, Health Secretary Louis Sullivan
endorsed one Senate proposal for salvaging parts of the program
only to have Budget Director Richard G. Darman insist that Sullivan
was not speaking for the administration.
   If House and Senate negotiators are unable to agree on what to
do about catastrophic, the law will remain on the books and
coverage under the program will be expanded in January.
   However, congressional aides on both sides of the issue say a
long-term stalemate is unlikely. That is because Congress has been
deluged with mail from many retirees who oppose parts of the
program. The biggest sore spot is the income surtax, paid only by
40 percent of retirees, that finances most of the program.
   Both houses of Congress voted to repeal the surtax. The Senate
bill would retain a flat $4-a-month premium that is paid by all but
the poorest retirees. That premium would continue protection
against high hospital bills but provide no coverage for doctor
bills or prescription drugs.

states sued the Chicago Board of Trade today, accusing it of
illegally manipulating prices.
   The federal suit was filed by individual farmers and the
American Agriculture Movement, a lobbying group that represents
small farmers and rural businessmen in 34 states.
   At issue is last summer's collapse of soybean prices, which the
farmers blame on an emergency order July 11 by the Board of Trade
to sell off all large holdings in soybeans.
   The order was widely viewed as an effort to break up an alleged
attempt to corner the market by Ferruzzi Finanziaria SpA, one of
the world's largest soybean processors.
   The farm organization said in a statement that the order was a
``bad-faith and self-serving action'' initiated by the BOT's
dominant members, including major soybean merchants, to create
profits.
   It said the resulting drop in soybean prices ``could cost the
rural economy, farmers, rural bankers, implement dealers and others
well over $1 billion.''
   Board Chairman Karsten Mahlmann said the BOT considers the
lawsuit frivolous. He said the board had acted to maintain order in
the market and that the Commodity Futures Trading Commission had
vindicated the BOT.

<HEAD>Voices of Dissent Emerge at Vatican Meeting on AIDS</HEAD>

   Dissent emerged Tuesday at a Vatican
conference on AIDS, with delegates complaining that no voice was
given to victims of the disease themselves.
   After negotiations with the president of the conference,
Vatican-based Archbishop Fiorenzo Angelini, about 50 delegates
organized a separate meeting in a side room to discuss their own
agenda for dealing with AIDS.
   Many alleged the conference allowed no room for debate or
questions. Some expressed concern that official speakers were
focusing too much on the sexual behavior and drug use that can
cause AIDS.
   The group included Peter Larkin, a 34-year-old AIDS victim from
London.
   ``I'm quite distressed as someone with AIDS that this conference
with so many important speakers does not include one person with
AIDS,'' he said. ``I'm being told how and what to think, but I'm
not being asked. We're getting very very angry because we're
ignored.''
   The group decided to ask conference organizers to let Larkin
address the three-day meeting, which ends Wednesday with a speech
by Pope John Paul II. There was no immediate indication of whether
the request would be accepted.
   Angelini referred to the criticism, telling the conference that
AIDS victims were represented but their confidentiality should be
respected.
   An Irish priest with the AIDS virus was ejected from the
conference Monday when he stood up wearing a sandwich-board with
the slogan ``The Church has AIDS.''
   The priest, the Rev. John White, heads an AIDS care center
called London Lighthouse. He was invited back to the conference
Tuesday by Angelini.
   ``No voice was given to people living with AIDS,'' said White,
43, who contracted the virus while working as a missionary in
Kenya. ``It seemed to be a conference where delegates were meant to
be totally passive.''
   ``The Berlin Wall is coming down but new walls are coming up
here,'' added Robert Kunst, head of a group called ``Cure AIDS
Now'' that supplies meals to AIDS patients in Miami. ``It's been
the usual focus on gay bashing and abstention in sex. The real
issues of care are not being addressed. It's all rubber-stamped.''
   The Rev. Carl Meirose, who heads a program for pastoral care of
AIDS victims in Chicago, said, ``This is the worst conference I've
ever attended. There is no chance for dialogue or interaction.
There is no voice for any voice.''
   Cardinal John O'Connor of New York, who gave the opening address
Monday, agreed the conference could have been organized differently.
   ``I would have included people with hands-on activity, including
persons with AIDS,'' he told reporters. ``I would also include
periods of discussion and exchange of ideas.''
   Tuesday's official speeches focused less on the high-risk
behavior that can lead to AIDS and more on scientific and medical
questions.
   Edmund Pellegrino, director of the Center for the Advanced Study
of Ethics at Georgetown University, said doctors have a ``moral
obligation'' to treat AIDS patients without discrimination. Those
who refuse should be suspended or have their license revoked, he
said.
   Pellegrino said doctors also have a duty to break the rule of
confidentiality and advise one spouse if the other spouse has AIDS,
with or without the partner's consent.
   Wade Parks, head of the pedriatics department at the University
of Miami, said all pregnant women should be tested for the AIDS
virus just as they are for syphillis.
   Parks said most women who give birth to seropositive babies did
not know beforehand that they carried the AIDS virus themselves.

   West Germany today offered massive financial aid
to East Germany if the Communist nation revamps its centralized
economy, and West Berlin's mayor warned of economic problems caused
by the newly opened borders.
   Also today, East Germany's new premier called for a coalition
government but gave no indication the opposition will be part in
it, despite widespread protests pressing for an end to the
Communist monopoly on power.
   Hans Modrow, considered a reformer, also said the Berlin Wall,
though open to travel, must remain standing to keep AIDS, crime and
other Western problems out of his Communist country, a newspaper
said today.
   A leader of East Germany's biggest opposition group, New Forum,
said today that the movement could work with a revamped Communist
Party but that naming Modrow premier was not enough.
   Also today, the official East German news agency ADN reported
that the government was considering opening part of the Berlin Wall
near the Brandenburg Gate as yet another passage between East and
West Berlin. The gate, a huge columned monument, is one of the
city's best-known symbols.
   Before East Germany opened its borders, the gate had been a
major rallying point for demonstrators seeking freedom to travel to
the West.
   Since the opening of East Germany's borders last week, there has
been growing speculation and concern about the implications for the
East German and West German economies.
   West German Economics Minister Helmut Haussmann, in announcing
the aid package today, compared his conditional offer to the
Marshall Plan put together by the United States to help Europe
recover from World War II destruction.
   Haussmann did not name a figure for the proposed aid, and said
the plan would be useless if East Germany did not carry out a
``thorough change'' of its troubled centrally planned economy.
   Speaking to reporters in Bonn, Haussmann said reforms promised
by East Germany's new Communist Party leader Egon Krenz had so far
led to more questions than answers.
   The minister said the aid plan being offered by Bonn would
include massive investments in East Germany and joint ventures, as
well as revamping East Germany's outdated communications and
transport system.
   East Germany's Communist governments in the past have flatly
ruled out free-market principles in the Socialist state.
   West Berlin Mayor Walter Momper urged the federal government to
meet with East German officials to discuss ``pressing economic
problems'' created by the sudden opening of East Germany's borders.
   Among the issues mentioned by Momper were currency problems,
traffic and other economic problems.
   Modrow was chosen Monday in a session of unprecedented
liveliness in East Germany's Parliament. Lawmakers, long
subservient to the Communist leadership, voted by secret ballot for
the first time and endorsed opposition calls for free elections.
They also elected their first non-Communist Parliament speaker.
   Some deputies even called for stripping the constitution of a
clause that designates the country ``socialist.''
   The Communist Party daily newspaper Neues Deutschland
acknowledged today the country is in a ``deep crisis,'' but is
experiencing an ``awakening'' leading toward change.
   Modrow, 61, is an anti-establishment Communist figure who built
his power base from his former position as Dresden's Communist
Party chief. He replaced Willi Stoph, who resigned last week along
with his entire 44-member Cabinet.
   The new premier supports step-by-step economic reforms,
including the scaling down of East Germany's ponderous government
bureaucracy.
   Still, Modrow said the government has no intention of tearing
down the Berlin Wall, despite carving new passages through it for
the past five days in an effort to halt an exodus of refugees and
growing public unrest.
   ``In our country there is little criminal activity ... cases of
AIDS and drugs are virtually unknown. Our people are asking
themselves why they shouldn't just leave that as it is,'' West
Germany's Bild newspaper quoted Modrow as saying.
   He said doing away with the barrier completely could cause
``chaos,'' echoing the Communist line that the wall was designed to
protect East Germany from threats of the West.
   Modrow is to present his Cabinet on Friday. The official ADN
news agency quoted him as saying Monday night that the country
needs a ``real coalition government.''
   ``This will naturally be a broader cooperation within our
alliance,'' he said, referring to four small Communist-aligned
parties that have had Cabinet positions in the past but never
important ones.
   There was no indication he intended to offer Cabinet ministries
to opposition leaders.
   The election of Modrow came as hundreds of thousands of
demonstrators gathered around the nation, spurred by last week's
opening of East Germany's borders with the West. They shouted
anti-Communist slogans and demanded an end to the party's monopoly
on power.
   In the city of Leipzig, about 300,000 people paraded through the
streets in what has become a Monday night ritual, chanting ``We are
the people!'' Protesters shouted `Lazy bunch!'' outside the local
headquarters of the secret police.
   Juergen Tallig, the Leipzig spokesman for New Forum, told West
Germany's Hesse state radio today, ``I can imagine cooperating with
a reformed Communist party.''
   He praised Modrow as a ``competent politician'' but said,
``There are still too many people in top positions with whom
dialogue is not possible.''
   Krenz permanently opened East Germany's borders Friday in an
attempt to stop hundreds of thousands of East Germans from fleeing
West and to buy time for his promised reforms.
   The gamble appears to have paid off. The official ADN news
agency reported that more than 5 million visas had been issued
since Thursday, but that only about 10,000 people applied to
emigrate.
   Monday's frequently uproarious parliamentary session was the
first translation of East Germany's euphoria into concrete
political action.
   During the meeting, some parliamentarians blamed the previous
party and state leadership for the economic and social morass that
has engulfed this nation of 16.5 million.
   Party leader Erich Honecker was ousted Oct. 18 at the height of
the exodus, and there have been calls for the entire party Central
Committee to step down.
   The new speaker of Parliament is Guenther Maleuda. The
Communists did not field a challenger to his candidacy. Maleuda
heads the Democratic Peasants, one of four non-Communist parties
that had been allowed to exist in exchange for accepting Communist
supremacy.

   A district court Tuesday sentenced a
Moroccan immigrant to six months in prison for ``disparaging and
deeply offending'' remarks about Jews on his radio station, Radio
Islam.
   Ahmed Rami called the ruling against him ``judicial murder'' and
said he would appeal the conviction.
   Sweden's 15,000-member Jewish community has viewed it as a
landmark case. It is only the second time that a court has
overridden the right of free speech to enforce an anti-racism law
barring the defamation of a people, race or ethnic group.
   Rami was convicted of 18 counts of broadcasting anti-Semitic
remarks, including quotes from Nazi writings such as Adolf Hitler's
``Mein Kampf.'' He has spoken on the air of a Jewish conspiracy to
achieve worldwide power.
   The court ruled the statements were ``clearly disparaging and in
many cases deeply offending to Jews, and Rami throughout makes
sweeping statements and refers to Jews in general.''
   The court acquitted him on charges relating to other remarks on
his weekly program, and cautioned that Israel and its supporters
must expect political criticism. He also was cleared of all charges
in connection with his book, ``What is Israel.''
   The verdict was announced a week ago, but the written judgment
and sentence were released Tuesday.
   ``This is a judicial murder, a scandal, and I intend to
appeal,'' Rami told reporters. He said he had been judged in a
political trial, and he accused the prosecutor of ``Zionist
sympathies.''
   ``I want to crush the state of Israel. ... If I am allowed on
the air again I will say the same things again,'' he said.
``Zionism, Judaism and the state of Israel are fakes.''
   During the eight-week trial, the prosecution called in
distinguished clergymen, including retired Stockholm Lutheran
bishop Krister Stendahl and Swedish Chief Rabbi Morton Narrowe, to
argue that Rami's programs were anti-Semitic.
   Rami's defense was based on the assertion that his programs were
not directed against the Jewish people, but against Judaism as an
ideology and political doctrine.
   The Local Radio Board was to decide Wednesday whether to suspend
the station's broadcasting permit, Rami said.
   Radio Islam, like some 2,500 independent companies or
individuals, rents air time from the Local Radio Board and is on
the air for one hour a week.
   ``I'm disappointed in the Swedish legal system,'' he said.
``Criticizing Israel and Jews is called persecution, while
criticizing Islam is plain criticism,'' he said, referring to
British author Salman Rusdie and his novel, ``The Satanic Verses.''

<DATELINE>PRAGUE, Czechoslovakia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Premier Ladislav Adamec said today
that Czechoslovak citizens will no longer need exit permits to
travel outside the country, a major reform in one of the last
hard-line East bloc nations.
   The announcement comes less than a week after East Germany
lifted most travel restrictions on its citizens and opened its
borders to the West, triggering a flood of visitors to West Germany.
   In an address to the Czechoslovak Federal Assembly, Adamec said
his government regards ``tourism as the citizens' important right
to get to know the world, gain experience and establish personal
contacts.''
   Czechoslovakia has been among the most resistant countries in
the East bloc to the Soviet-style political reforms sweeping
Poland, Hungary and now East Germany. It has crushed public dissent
and jailed protesters calling for democratic reforms. Police used
truncheons and arrested scores during pro-reform demonstrations in
October.
   During the summer, the government eased some travel restrictions
but did not lift the requirement for an exit visa when traveling to
the West. Authorities have often refused to allow leading
dissidents to travel abroad.
   In Washingotn, President Bush hailed the development.
   ``The people of Czechoslovakia have the same aspirations for
freedom that others have, and I would expect we'd see further
changes there, just as we have seen in Poland, Hungary and in the
German Democratic Republic (East Germany.) So it's a very good and
encouraging step,'' the president said.
   Adamec said the government was changing the law to make travel
easier. He did not say when the new rule would take effect, but it
was expected to begin in January.
   ``The processing of travel documents is being speeded up,''
Adamec said. ``For travel to non-socialist countries and to
Yugoslavia, exit visas will not be necessary.'' Yugoslavia is a
communist country but is not aligned with the Warsaw Pact, so
travel to it had been restricted.
   Currently, Czechoslovak citizens wishing to travel West must
apply for exit visas with the Interior Ministry. Before a trip is
authorized, would-be travelers must also obtain stamps from their
employers and from military authorities. There is a 3O-day waiting
period.
   In July, the government lifted the rule requiring that
invitations for Czechoslovak citizens to visit the West come from
family members. It began recognizing invitations from anyone living
in the West, including emigres, even those who had left their
country illegally.
   The government had also lifted restrictions on Czechoslovaks
wishing to emigrate to join family members who had left the country
illegally.
   Czechoslovaks still will need visas from the countries they wish
to visit.
   Earlier this year, Czechoslovakia began granting visas to
Austrian and West German citizens at selected border crossings and
speeded up the issuance of visas for Western correspondents. In
most cases, they now can receive visas in a day rather than having
to wait up to two weeks.
   Adamec said that the number of visits by Czechoslovak citizens
to Western countries increased last year by 30 percent over the
previous year.
   ``Our aim is that Czechoslovakia become a country for which
travel and tourism represent not only a significant sum in the
state budget, but also the satisfaction of its citizens,'' Adamec
said in the nationally televised speech.

   A Berlin Wall museum featuring a bullet-scarred
van, a makeshift ladder and other poignant reminders of ingenuity
born of desperation has taken on new meaning with the wall's
opening.
   ``We're a real museum now,'' said Horst Schumm, assistant
director of the museum in a converted cafe alongside the wall's
famed Checkpoint Charlie crossing point.
   ``But the museum must stay and we should open in East Germany,
too. It is necessary for all Germans to understand this history and
to learn from it for the future.''
   On Thursday, the museum became part of history in a matter of
hours after East Germany lifted traven its
hemmed-in citizens for the first time since the wall was erected on
Aug. 13, 1961.
   Crossing the wall turned from a death-defying atl restrictions otempt
to escape
into a simple matter of showing an identity card to a border guard.
   For thousands of East Germans who have flocked to the museum,
its exhibits have been a ``surprise and a shock,'' Schumm said.
   ``Some knew from West German television that escapees had been
shot. But in the GDR (East Germany) they'd been told that the
reports were lies from the West and only criminals tried to
escape.''
   He stood beside a little bubble-shaped Isetta car into wchange of $10
in the
price of a bond with a $1,000 face value.
   Yields on three-month Treasury bills fell to 7.93 percent as the
discount lost 2 basis points to 7.68 percent. Yields on six-month
bills fell to 7.83 percent as the discount fell 12 basis points at
7.45 percent. Yields on one-year bills fell to 7.73 percent as the
discount lost 4 basis points to 7.24 percent.
   A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point. The yield
is the annualized return on an investment in a Treasury bill. The
discount is the percentage that bills are selling below the face
value, which is paid at maturity.
   The federal funds rate, the interest on overnight loans between
banks, was quoted by midday at 8 7-16 percent, up from 8] percent
late Monday.

   Next week's scheduled launch of space shuttle
Discovery on a classified military mission will be delayed at least
two days because of potential shorts in the wiring assemblies of

   NASA said technicians today were removing four integrated
electronics assemblies _ two from each of the boosters _ and taking
them to the manufacturer's facilities for inspection.
   ``There is the potential some wiring there could short,'' said
Lisa Malone, a space center spokeswoman.
   A NASA statement later said the launch, which had been scheduled
for Nov. 20, would take place ``no earlier than Nov. 22.''
   The electronics units are the brains of the boosters, routing
power commands and data between the booster rockets and the orbiter.
   The potential problem showed up in the prelaunch testing.

   Canada's Coast Guard went on
strike for higher wages today, throwing up picket lines on the East
and West coasts.
   The 2,200 unionized seamen, deckhands, stewards and cooks _ who
conduct sea rescues, go on Customs and fishery patrols and work
aboard government research vessels _ said they would return only in
emergencies. None were immediately reported.
   At the Canadian Forces Base Equimalt on Vancouver Island, a Navy
tug was prevented from going on duty when crewmen belonging to the
union, Public Service Alliance of Canada, refused to cross picket
lines, said a base spokesman.
   Coast Guard spokesman Craig Dougans said the agency would ``do
the best we can, but you can expect some disruptions.''
   Ted Maher, a director for the Department of Fisheries and
Oceans, said Navy ships may be pressed into service for fishery
patrols within Canada's 200-mile limit.
   Gary Owen, a union spokesman, said the ``entire search and
rescue operation will not be functioning.'' However, the union and
Transport Canada, the nation's transportation department, agreed to
respond to emergencies.
   The union has been without a contract for two years.
   One of the major items in dispute is the wage disparity between
crewmen on the East and West coasts. A West Coast Guardsman earns
an average of $23,000, or about $1,900 more a year than an eastern
counterpart doing the same job.
   The union turned down an offer from Canada's Treasury Board for
a 3{-year contract with raises totaling 14.4 percent.

   President Bush today hailed a move by
Czechoslovakia to ease travel restrictions on its citizens and said
it is just the latest sign that ``Europe will someday be whole and
free.''
   ``I'm very pleased at the move in Czechoslovakia,'' Bush told
reporters at the outset of an Oval Office meeting with Tunisian
President Ben Ali.
   ``The people of Czechoslovakia have the same aspirations for
freedom that others have, and I would expect we'd see further
changes there, just as we have seen in Poland, Hungary and in the
German Democratic Republic (East Germany.) So it's a very good and
encouraging step,'' the president said.
   ``This is further manifestation that Europe someday will be
whole and free. (Soviet President Mikhail S.) Gorbachev talks about
`a common home'; we talk about a Europe whole and free. It's a most
exciting time.''
   Bush was responding to the announcement in Prague by Czech
Premier Ladislav Adamec that Czechoslovak citizens will no longer
need exit permits to travel outside the country, a major reform in
one of the last hard-line East bloc nations. He did not say when
the new rule would take effect, but it was expected to begin in
January.
   Asked if he planned to stop in Brussels to brief the NATO allies
after the Dec. 2-3 shipboard summit off Malta with Gorbachev, the
president said, ``We are thinking right now how we might stay in
touch with our allies. That is very, very important.''
   Asked if he was concerned that the changes in Europe were
happening too fast, Bush said, ``No, I don't think it's moving too
fast and I don't know of anybody in my administration who feels
that it's moving too fast.''
   Earlier, two well-placed U.S. officials said that Bush, facing
pressure from Democrats to respond more strongly to the changes in
Eastern Europe, is considering a meeting with allied leaders in
Brussels after next month's summit.
   The aim of a meeting in the NATO capital would be to show
Western unity on the future of Germany and to discuss new political
and military strategy in light of the quickening change that is
enveloping Eastern and Central Europe.
   Asked if Bush favors the $738 million aid package for Poland and
Hungary nearing approval in the Senate, White House spokesman
Marlin Fitzwater said, ``We're generally supportive. We'd like to
get billions if we had them.'' Bush proposed a smaller package.
   Asked if the United States would like to see free elections in
East Germany, Fitzwater said, ``We would like to see the people's
rights and wills determined by themselves, and we think there is a
very constructive course of freedom under way in East Germany and
the other parts of Eastern Europe.''
   Fitzwater praised the lifting of travel restrictions in
Czechoslovakia and added, ``We're not surprised by anything
anymore.''
   Bush is under pressure from Democratic leaders in the Senate and
House to respond more energetically to developments in the
communist world.
   Renewing his criticism, Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell,
D-Maine, said today it was ``regrettable'' that Bush, through his
spokesman, has rejected the idea of going to Berlin to express
American satisfaction with the ``symbolic destruction'' of the wall
or to normalize trade relations with the Soviet Union.
   ``While the president has rejected all of these, he has reversed
himself on issues before and I hold out out hope he will do so
again,'' Mitchell told reporters.
   Mitchell on Monday had urged Bush to travel to the Berlin Wall,
now breached by unrestricted travel by East Germans, convene a
meeting of the Western allies and suspend trade restrictions
against the Soviet Union.
   House Democratic Leader Richard A. Gephardt of Missouri,
meanwhile, said: ``At the very time freedom and democracy are
receiving standing ovations in Europe, our president is sitting
politely in the audience with little to say and even less to
contribute.''
   The administration did not respond publicly. But privately, the
two officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, said Bush was
weighing a meeting with leaders of the 15 other North Atlantic
Treaty Organization countries after the Dec. 2-3 talks in the
Mediterranean with Gorbachev.
   At the top of the agenda would be the future of Germany, which
Vice President Dan Quayle said in a speech Monday inevitably will
be reunited once East Germany shakes off communism.
   ``East Germany is East Germany because of the communist
system,'' Quayle told the Republican Governors' Association at
Hilton Head Island, S.C. ``Do away with the communist system and
it's Germany.''
   Despite Quayle's confident statement, a number of U.S. officials
acknowledged in interviews that the Bush administration had to move
cautiously for two reasons: Nervousness in Western Europe about
restoring Germany to full strength and in Moscow about U.S.
intentions.
   A militarily powerful Germany has been at the center of two
devastating wars in Europe this century.
   The officials told The Associated Press that Gorbachev might
propose to Bush in their talks a reunited but neutralized Germany.
U.S. strategy, they said, is to undertake preparations within NATO
and the European Community for the potential integration of a
single Germany into a democratic Europe.
   ``On this, the Europeans will have to take the lead,'' a U.S.
official said.

<TEXT>
   A $1.1 million program that gives farmers
suggestions for reducing pesticide and herbicide use may be moved
to the Interior Department to settle a dispute that's holding up
billions of dollars in agriculture funding, House-Senate conferees
indicated Tuesday.
   The program, known as the Appropriate Technology Transfer for
Rural Areas, or ATTRA, employs 19 people at the University of
Arkansas who operate a toll-free hotline.
   Last year, they answered 4,115 calls with guidance on reducing
dependence on chemicals, according to the program's annual report.
   Sen. Dale Bumpers, D-Ark., who is fighting to save the program,
is locked in battle with Rep. Jamie Whitten, D-Miss., head of the
House Appropriations Committee, who insists other programs within
the Agriculture Department provide the same information.
   The standoff between the two has tied up the $44 billion
appropriations bill for all Agriculture Department operations in
conference committee for weeks.
   On Tuesday, Bumpers said he'd agree to move the program to the
Fish and Wildlife Service within the Interior Department.
   He and Whitten said they'd talk about it again Wednesday.
   ``When you look at what EPA is saying about pesticides, there's
not a soul around this table who doesn't know we're going to have
to reduce use of these things,'' said Bumpers.
   He said the 3-year-old program has proven its usefulness by the
number of calls it has handled.
   He said 234 of the calls last year came from extension service
agents, who traditionally are the Agriculture Department officials
farmers go to for technological information.
   ``If you didn't have this program, you would turn around the
very next day and create something just like it,'' Bumpers said
during a conference committee meeting with Whitten and other
members of the House and Senate.

   Students boycotted classes at the
University of Massachusetts for a second day today to protest state
budget cuts.
   The 25,000-student university said it planned no sanctions
against those involved and had no count of the students taking part.
   ``It's not massive. It's partial,'' Provost Richard D. O'Brien
said.
   The protest was prompted by a $25 million cut in aid to public
higher education to help eliminate the Massachusetts budget deficit.
   Lisa Nelson, a junior from Sunderland who helped organize the
protest, said students today targeted science classes, which many
professors agreed to cancel.
   ``It's been building up all fall,'' said John Schmertzler, a
junior from West Springfield. ``They cut out a thousand classes and
they expect us to pay more when we can't even get into a class.''
   The Amherst campus' share of the cutback is $6.4 million and
resulted in a $350 increase next semester in the university's
mandatory fees to $1,465. The fees come in addition to tuition,
which was raised 8 percent this fall to $1,512.
   University spokeswoman Joan Ashwell said the faculty union
estimated that 60 percent of classes were canceled Monday.
   The faculty union made it clear it supported the students.
   ``You need to convince your representatives and senators that
you are a force to be reckoned with _ that you will support them if
they support you,'' history Professor Bruce Laurie, union vice
president, said at a rally Monday.

<TEXT>
   Gov. John Ashcroft of Missouri
became chairman of the Republican Governors Association Tuesday and
advised GOP candidates of 1990 to stake firm clear positions on
abortion and other major issues and then stick to them.
   Gov. Carroll A. Campbell Jr. of South Carolina was elected vice
chairman of the association, and will take over as chairman next
year.
   Ashcroft said he felt ``voters were cheated'' in campaigns for
the elections one week ago because the candidates did not deal
adequately with real concerns, such as crime, drugs and education.
   ``We need to state our own positions, not be on the defensive
and not be characterized by others,'' Ashcroft said.
   Gov. Mike Hayden of Kansas added, ``First you tell them where
you stand and then you stand where you tell them. That's good
advice for every Republican candidate.''
   Campbell held up a newspaper clipping and quoted Democratic
Gov.-elect L. Douglas Wilder of Virginia as urging his party to
take mainstream positions, battling crime and drugs and holding the
line on taxes.
   ``They're trying to be Republicans,'' Campbell said. ``We've
been doing that all along.''
   The governors commented at a news conference winding up their
meeting.

   Lech Walesa today thanked the AFL-CIO for its
``unfailing and reliable'' support of Poland's Solidarity union and
called for swift and heavy investment in his country's fledgling
market economy.
   ``You helped us survive the most difficult days, the moments of
despair and hopelessness,'' Walesa told the AFL-CIO convention
after an emotional welcome from hundreds of labor leaders at a
downtown hotel ballroom.
   ``Now the time has come to thank you; to thank you for your
solidarity with Solidarity _ with the cause so many people
considered lost and which now, thanks to the stubbornness of Poles
and the perseverance of our friends, has put us on the road to
victory,'' said Walesa, speaking through a translator.
   ``Our country needs your experience, your knowledge, your modern
technologies,'' Walesa said in his appeal for American investment.
``Do not let the world and us wait any longer.''
   The speech, preceded by a video detailing Solidarity's struggle
against the Polish government, was repeatedly interrupted by
standing ovations from delegates. Walesa received a hero's welcome,
entering the huge convention hall to cheers and applause. Scores of
delegates reached out to shake his hand as Coordinated Clearance
and Settlement Act, which also passed the subcommittee.

   The Senate moved today toward agreement on a
compromise $738 million plan to spur the rebirth of democracy and
free enterprise in Poland and Hungary.
   The bipartisan compromise was announced less than 48 hours
before Lech Walesa, leader of Poland's Solidarity union movement,
was to address a joint meeting of Congress.
   Formal approval of the plan, expected today, would be an
important step toward resolving a long dispute over the size of the
program.
   ``It almost sounds trite to say that what is happening in
Eastern Europe is mind-boggling, but thank God for it,'' Sen.
Gordon Humphrey, R-N.H., said as the debate resumed this morning.
   ``We must do all we can afford, as quickly as we can, to help
make these changes in Eastern Europe irreversible,'' Humphrey said
as the Senate approved his amendment to earmark 10 percent of the
private enterprise funds contained in the bill for Solidarity and a
Polish free-enterprise association.
   Humphrey said the change was necessary to permit some of the
money to move quickly, cutting through bureaucratic delays as
applications are considered.
   Senate Democrats originally had sought a three-year
authorization level for the two East European nations of $989
millions, while Republicans called for a $585 million ceiling.
   All the proposals, including the $840 million authorized earlier
by the House, overshadow the total $455 million proposed over the
last several months by President Bush.
   Asked today if Bush favors the $738 million aid package for
Poland and Hungary nearing approval in the Senate, White House
spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said, ``We're generally supportive. We'd
like to get billions if we had them.''
   Differences between the House and Senate versions of the aid
package are expected to be resolved quickly.
   The Senate builds on key elements advocated by the president,
including an Enterprise Fund to help both nations move away from
communist centralized planning and toward free-market systems.
   The funds, intended to help both countries establish free-market
systems, would allocate $260 million for Poland and $65 million for
Hungary.
   In recognition of Poland's serious economic problems, the bill
allocates $657 million for that country while Hungary would receive
$81 million.
   Senate Republican Leader Bob Dole of Kansas noted Democrats had
dropped a $200 million credit stabilization plan for Poland, a plan
he said Republicans believed would be unworkable and merely add to
Poland's large foreign debt.
   The compromise trimmed the rival Democratic plan to ``a more
realistic size,'' Dole said.
   Poland and Hungary remain members of the Warsaw Pact, according
to Dole, who said the compromise has a number of safeguards,
including barring any funds from being used for military aid to
Cuba or Nicaragua.
   Meanwhile, congressional Democrats opened fire on the
president's approach to other crucial events in Eastern Europe,
including East Germany's decision to open the Berlin wall 28 years
after it was erected across the divided city.
   Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell said today it is
``regrettable'' that Bush has rejected the idea of going to Berlin
to express American satisfaction with the ``symbolic destruction''
of the wall or to normalize trade relations with the Soviet Union.
   ``While the president has rejected all of these, he has reversed
himself on issues before and I hold out out hope he will do so
again,'' the Maine Democrat told reporters.
   Mitchell said he also believes Bush should convene an emergency
conference of the Western allies to chart the future of Europe in
the light of events in the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe.
   ``Obviously the post-World-War II era is coming to an end,
marked by the upheaval in Eastern Europe and the new economic era
order in Western Europe,'' Mitchell said.
   It is important, he said, that the United States now assert its
full leadership in ``shaping that new order.''
   Presidential spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said Monday he couldn't
``foresee any set of circumstances at this moment that would
induce'' Bush to go to Berlin.
   On Monday, the Senate unanimously adopted a resolution welcoming
the opening of the wall, condemning it as a ``symbol of
oppression'' and demanding.

   The editor and advertising director of a Roman
Catholic university's student newspaper have been suspended for
running an advertisement promoting nationwide abortion rights
activities.
   ``Stand up, be counted while you still have the chance,'' the ad
in the Marquette Tribune said, promoting pro-choice rallies held
Sunday.
   Greg Myers, 21, editor of the Marquette University student
publication, and Brian Kristofek, 21, advertising director, said
they were suspended Monday for the rest of the semester.
   They also said a non-student official of the publication was
dismissed because of the ad.
   ``The pro-choice rally ad that was run was clearly in violation
of the university standards and university policy,'' said Sharon
Murphy, dean of Marquette's College of Communications, Journalism
and Performing Arts. ``It should not have run.''
   Francis Lazarus, Marquette vice president for academic affairs,
issued a statement saying the newspaper's advertising policy was
being studied ``to ensure the publication of that type of ad will
not occur again.''
   Myers said the ad was placed as part of a national advertising
account, but newspaper officials were aware of the content.
   ``We discussed the ad. We were the ones who decided whether it
should run or not,'' he said. ``We decided to run it and we were
wrong.''
   He said the students responsible for the decision did not
entirely understand the university policy covering such ads.
   Myers, a senior from the Minneapolis area, and Kristofek, a
senior from Winfield, Ill., both said they planned to resume their
jobs with the Tribune when the suspensions end in January.
   ``I have to be upset,'' Myers said. ``But what am I going to do?
What I need to do is use this time to evaluate what we've done and
get ready for next semester.''
   In Washington, D.C., editors of the Georgetown University
student newspaper decided not to publish Friday's edition when
officials of that Roman Catholic university ruled they could not
run an ad urging participation in the weekend pro-choice activities.

<HEAD>It's Diaper Detail For U.S. Army Cook</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The U.S. Army mess sergeant rolled up the sleeve
of his jungle fatigues, squirted a few drops of milk near the
American flag tattooed on his brawny arm and handed the bottle to
the bawling East German infant.
   ``Getting real good at this,'' laughed Staff Sgt. Levonso
Hemingway of Greensboro, N.C., first cook with the 6th infantry
battalion, which for the past week has been operating a soup
kitchen for refugees pouring through the new holes in the Berlin
Wall.
   ``Jackie Mason chicken soup is on the menu today,'' he said.
``Yesterday we fed about 5,000. Today looks even bigger. People
were on line in the dark and cold when I got here at 5 a.m. to turn
on the portable stoves.''
   The next infant in line was attached to his mother by the
headphones of a portable cassette recorder, the first tangible
evidence of the family's flight to freedom.
   ``He's jamming,'' approved Hemingway, doling out a peanut butter
and jelly sandwich to the newest hard rock recruit and a package of
disposable diapers to the beaming mother.
   Less than three decades ago _ Oct. 27, 1961 _ when the Cold War
was at its hottest, U.S. Patton tanks confronted low-slung Soviet
tanks in a tense 16-hour standoff at Checkpoint Charlie.
   Now the might of the American military in Berlin was on ``diaper
detail,'' responding with British and French allies to requests by
the Berlin city government to provide emergency food and bedding
for the refugees.
   They are bedded down on army cots in schools, sports halls,
garages and factories. Some are even sleeping in their tiny East
Germans cars.
   ``Many already have health problems,'' said Kristian Binde, a
paramedic with the Red Cross. He was helping process the new
arrivals at the army soup kitchen on the third floor of a derelict
elevator factory where the elevators no longer work.
   ``They have headaches and trouble with breathing from the smog,
and now that the weather has turned so chilly, chest colds are
common, especially among the children,'' he said. ``In cases of
really serious illness, like a heart attack, the open border now
works both ways. We can send them across to the Humboldt University
Hospital in East Berlin.''
   Some have problems with alcohol. ``They celebrate their new
freedom too much and wind up in an ambulance,'' Binde said.
   Erich Honecker, the recently resigned East German leader, was
given the assignment of building the Berlin Wall after midnight on
a summer Sunday in 1961 because the best and the brightest under
Communist control were defecting to the West. In the previous half
dozen years, more than 17,000 engineers and technicians and 6,000
doctors and nurses had fled.
   Apparently, East Germany's professional class is on the move
again. At a table in the soup kitchen, filling out papers that
hopefully might find them work, were nurse Viola Spiering and her
husband, Sebastian, an electrical engineer. With their 11-year-old
son they had left Robel, a small town 70 miles to the north, and
had no idea where they would settle.
   ``Perhaps Hamburg,'' said Mrs. Spiering, who has been plotting
the family exodus for months. ``We are lucky. We stay with an uncle
here in Berlin. The boy is very happy _ he doesn't have to go back
to school yet.''
   Hans Jorg Patzig, a refugee coordinator for the city of Berlin,
said a lot of doctors arrived last week. ``This is a problem,
because a lot of doctors here in West Berlin are unemployed. We
have more doctors than we need. Also public health education
standards are not very high on the other side, so a lot of them
could be bad doctors,'' he said.
   The government is providing free flights to take the refugees to
jobs in other West German cities, Patzig said, and the U.S. Army
provides buses to take them to the airport.
   But even the skilled technicians and engineers have not kept
pace with the West's computer chip technology.
   ``We get a number of printers and linotype operators who don't
realize all our newspapers here are done by the offset process,''
he said. ``People in the building trades _ carpenters, plumbers,
roofers _ will have no trouble getting work.''
   Bus driver Heinz Hammermann is among the volunteers collecting
clothing and blankets for the refugees. He remembers ``the
confrontation between the American and the Soviets on
Friedrichstrasse. We lived close by. I hid with my grandparents in
the cellar. They thought World War III was about to begin.''
   For Thanksgiving, Hemingway hopes to serve ``the best of the
West'' to the new converts to democracy filling his soup kitchen.
   ``Real turkey soup, not the dehydrated stuff,'' he said. ``I'll
carve up a couple of dozen birds, get me some onions, celery,
peppers, potatoes, and we'll show them what freedom is all about.''

   A firefighter used mouth-to-mouth

overcome in a fire that damaged a house.
   ``We did it once before on a puppy, but it was too late,'' said
Fire Department rescue specialist A.J. Green. ``I do love animals.''
   No people were injured in the blaze, but firefighters found four
kittens in the house and took them outside, said Battalion Chief

   A neighbor began chest massage on a kitten that was not
breathing and Green began mouth-to-mouth resuscitation on a second

   After both surviving kittens started to breathe on their own,
Green gave them oxygen. Following about 20 minutes of rescue
efforts, a neighbor took the now-active kittens home for the night.

   Former President Ronald Reagan told troubled
teen-agers Tuesday that everything happens for a purpose _ even bad
things.
   ``I know you haven't had it easy,'' Reagan told more than 120
young people at Covenant House. ``There must have been times when
you wondered if anyone cared.''
   ``People do care,'' he assured them. ``I care about you and
that's why I'm here.''
   Covenant House shelters about 25,000 runaway, homeless or
neglected children each year at houses in three nations and seven
states. Reagan visited the agency's building in the Chelsea section
of Manhattan, where he handed out writing pens and spoke briefly.
   Reagan told the youths that when he was young his family was
poor and his father was an alcoholic. ``There were nights when I
was angry and frustrated and wondered, `Why?'''
   But he said he was sustained by his mother, who insisted
``everything happens for a reason. ... Down the road something good
will happen, and you'll realize it was for the best.''
   He gave an example: During the Depression he went to the
Montgomery Ward department store in his Illinois town and applied
for work. When he was turned down, he recalled, ``I felt about as
low as could be.''
   But Reagan next went to a radio station and was hired as a
sportscaster, beginning his road to Hollywood and the White House.
   If he had gotten the first job he'd applied for, Reagan said,
``I'd still be in working at that Montgomery Ward.''

   Ron Bloise, a spokesman at Nellis Air Force Base, said Monday
the Air Force and the Defense Department are working on a date to

   The fighters are based at Nellis and fly out of the Tonopah Test

   Officials say declassification of the jet, known as the F-117-A,
is part of a continuing process that began a year ago when the Air

   A former state tax commissioner who
blamed his failure to file federal income tax returns on marital
and business problems has been placed on probation for three years.
   Richard L. Dailey, 49, who pleaded guilty to misdemeanor charges
of failing to file returns in 1985 and 1986, was sentenced Monday.
   U.S. District Judge John T. Copenhaver Jr. also ordered Dailey
to perform 150 days of public service and to pay $95,000 in taxes
plus penalties on $295,000 he earned during 1985 and 1986. If he
fails to make the payments within three years, his probation will
be extended by two years, Copenhaver said.
   The judge told Dailey he didn't impose a fine because Dailey's
``tax obligation is staggering in comparison to your lack of
assets.''
   Dailey said he experienced marital problems and business
setbacks in coal mining equipment leasing ventures.
   ``I made substantial mistakes and caused humiliation and
embarrassment to my son and my father,'' said Dailey, who was state
tax commissioner during 1972-77 under Gov. Arch Moore.
   Dailey, who works for an insurance firm in Columbus, Ohio, said
he expects to earn $40,000 this year.

   Fire broke out aboard the amphibious assault
ship USS Inchon while it underwent shipyard maintenance today,
injuring at least 29 people in the latest in a string of Navy
accidents, authorities said.
   The fire began around 9:30 a.m. in a hangar deck where
helicopters normally are stored and was put out in 10 minutes, said
Lt. Cmdr. Steve Burnett, an Atlantic Fleet spokesman.
   He said the blaze may have begun in an area where several power
lines were attached to the ship from shore.
   Burnett said 20 sailors and nine civilians were injured and were
taken to six hospitals. At least one victim was listed in serious
condition.
   The blaze was the seventh serious Navy accident since Oct. 29.
Seven people have been killed or lost at sea and 16 injured in the
string of accidents, which included a collision between a destroyer
and a merchant ship off Malaysia on Sunday and the crash of a jet
on a carrier Oct. 29.
   Ten people, most of them sailors, were taken to Sentara Norfolk
General hospital for smoke inhalation today, said spokeswoman
Deborah Meyers. She said eight were in stable condition, one was in
guarded condition and in serious condition.
   A spokesman for the Portsmouth Naval Hospital said 10 to 15
victims were taken there. Their conditions were not considered
serious.
   The 602-foot troop and helicopter carrier has a crew of 675 and
can hold up to 2,000 Marines for landings.
   Navy officials said the vessel was at the Metro Machine Corp.
shipyard for maintenance.

   Ailing entertainer Sammy Davis Jr. basked in
an outpouring of appreciation from fans ranging from Michael
Jackson to Frank Sinatra at a tribute honoring his 60 years in show
business.
   The star-studded salute Monday night, a benefit for the United
Negro College Fund, included performances by Jackson, Sinatra,
Stevie Wonder and Whitney Houston.
   ``I thank you all from my heart,'' said Davis, 63, who is
undergoing radiation treatment for throat cancer. ``It's the
greatest night of my life.''
   The Rev. Jesse Jackson and Los Angeles Lakers basketball player
Magic Johnson joined the gathering, also attended by Bob Hope,
longtime Davis co-performer Dean Martin, Gregory Peck, Shirley
MacLaine, Henry Mancini, actor-dancer Gregory Hines and heavyweight
boxing champ Mike Tyson. Comedian Eddie Murphy was host.
   Davis began his career at age 3 performing with his father and
uncle in a song and dance group called the Will Mastin Trio.
   His throat cancer, found in September, is localized and he is
expected to recover. ``I got good word today from the doctor _
about four or five weeks of recovery and I'll be back yelling and
screaming again,'' he said.

   American film star Elizabeth Taylor
flew to the Thai resort island of Phuket for a rest Tuesday after
visiting AIDS patients in a Bangkok hospital.
   ``Ms. Taylor is tired after these past few days. She's not used
to the heat and she's had a lot of appointments and functions,''
said Sally Morrison, director of the American Foundation for AIDS
Research.
   Ms. Taylor, who chairs the foundation, visited three AIDS
patients at Bangkok's Chulalongkorn University Hospital on Monday.
   ``Ms. Taylor was very distressed that the man in the middle bed
couldn't get the surgery he needed because no surgeon was willing
to operate for fear of getting AIDS,'' Ms. Morrison said.
   Ms. Taylor arrived in Thailand on Friday at the invitation of
Princess Chulabhorn, who directs an AIDS research institute and
leads Thailand's fight against the deadly disease.

   Charges have been refiled against a man
suspected of trying to burglarize the Bel Air hotel room of actors
Don Johnson and Melanie Griffith earlier this year, prosecutors
said Monday.
   The original felony charges filed against Henry Kenneth
Rosenbaum, also known as David Barton Johnson, were dropped when
the couple were unable to testify at Rosenbaum's Sept. 20
preliminary hearing.
   Rosenbaum, serving a jail sentence for possessing burglary
tools, pleaded innocent Monday to the refiled charges.
   The complaint charges that when the couple returned to their
hotel room on Jan. 29, they found Rosenbaum going through
Griffith's purse, which contained expensive jewelry.
   Johnson, star of the television police program ``Miami Vice,''
grabbed Rosenbaum and held him until hotel security arrived.

   ``A woman walked up to me in the supermarket the other day and

<HEAD>Egyptians-Iraqis to Discuss Deaths of Egyptians in Iraq.</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CAIRO, Egypt (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Senior Egyptian and Iraqi officials will
discuss the welfare of about 1 million Egyptian workers in Iraq
following reports that more than 100 Egyptians died in Iraq last
month.
   ``The foreign ministry is following the issue of Egyptian
workers in Iraq and this will be reviewed during the meeting of the
higher joint Egyptian-Iraqi committee on Saturday,'' said Foreign
Minister Esmat Abdel-Meguid.
   The government has been handling the affair cautiously, and he
did not refer to reports in the state-owned al-Akhbar newspaper
that 102 bodies of Egyptians had been flown to Cairo in October,
compared with one body in October 1988.
   The newspaper also reported that ``thousands'' of Egyptians were
buried in Iraq because they did not leave enough money for their
bodies to be sent home, and that Egyptians were badly treated by
Iraqis.
   Al-Akhbar also reported that starting Wednesday, Iraqi Airlines
would start 10 extra flights from Baghdad to Cairo daily for the
next three months to fly home Egyptian workers.
   It quoted Iraqi officials in Baghdad as saying return of
Egyptian workers in large numbers was not because of
``maltreatment'' but because soldiers discharged after Iran-Iraq
war ended were taking jobs once held by Egyptians.
   Some Egyptian government officials and the opposition newspaper
al-Wafd attribute most of the Egyptian deaths to friction between
Iraqis and Egyptians and rivalries over jobs.
   Al-Akhbar said Prime Minister Atef Sedki demanded a full report
from Egypt's ambassador to Baghdad, Ibrahim Ouf.
   On Monday, a senior security official at Cairo International
Airport confirmed that about 100 Egyptian bodies were flown from
Iraq in October, an average of ``three or four'' a day. The
official also said autopsies have been ordered to determine the
cause of the death.
   Al-Akhbar said that Iraqi certificates initially attributed
death to ``bullet wounds'' and later switched to other formulas
like ``killed in an accident'' or ``died in butane gas cylinder
explosion.''
   The Egyptian government has been cautious in handling the issue
because of close ties between the two countries. Millions of
Egyptians work abroad, about 1 million in Iraq.
   One Egyptian security official said he did not believe the
bodies arriving in recent weeks were related to reports of an
August explosion and fire at an Iraqi missile plant that killed 700
people, including many Egyptians. The high death toll was reported
by Iraqi dissident sources and the London newspaper The Independent.

<TEXT>
   Lawyers for the state asked the Georgia Supreme
Court today to rule that a quadriplegic with no hope of improvement
has the right to shut off the machine that has kept him alive for
four years.
   Assistant Attorney General William M. Droze argued that Larry
McAfee's death if he disconnected his ventilator would not be
suicide but the result ``of the natural progression of his
condition.''
   McAfee, whose motorcycle injuries four years ago left him
paralyzed from the neck down and dependent on a respirator, already
won consent in September from a Superior Court judge to disconnect
the breathing apparatus.
   After ruling in the case, Judge Edward Johnson instructed
Attorney General Michael Bowers to appeal to the state's highest
court for guidance in future cases.
   McAfee decided to delay shutting off his ventilator, offering
others more time to try to talk him out of it. But his attorney,
Leigh Smith, urged the court to uphold the ruling, saying that
would amount to an affirmation of ``a competent adult's right to
refuse medical treatment.''
   The trial judge held that McAfee's constitutional right to
privacy permitted him to disconnect the respirator and that the
state had no interests outweighing McAfee's right to refuse medical
treatment.
   With a friend's help, McAfee devised a method by which he could
turn the respirator off himself. But he also asked to be given a
sedative so that he would not suffer once the respirator was
removed.
   On that point, Johnson ruled that any physician or lawman who
administered a sedative to McAfee or who helped him in turning off
the respirator would not be subject to any civil or criminal
liability.
   Bowers said Monday the issue is legally murky and should be
resolved by the state's highest court.
   ``The question, I believe, is whether what we have is explicit
and clear enough concerning the right of a competent person to
refuse medical treatment,'' Bowers said.
   ``We believe that if you take the law as a whole and try to
distill it, you come up with this right. But we acknowledge there
is nothing one could point to and say, `There is this right.'''
   Bowers and other parties in the lawsuit have urged the Supreme
Court to use the case to write guidelines allowing people similarly
situated in the future to gain the removal of life-sustaining
equipment through non-judicial means.
   The state already has such guidelines for people who have signed
a ``living will'' directing their physicians not to engage in
heroic means to preserve them in a non-conscious state.
   Although most ``right-to-die'' cases involve comatose patients
or those who cannot make their wishes known, a case similar to
McAfee's came up in July. A Michigan man paralyzed in a surfing
accident died after a court decided he had the right to have his
life-support system shut off.

   Squads of men armed with iron tongs and
a poisonous liquid are prowling this populous city's streets and
alleys with one mission in mind: kill as many dogs as possible.
   Authorities say they have no choice.
   ``We know it is cruelty to kill the dogs,'' says Dr. Rezaul
Karim, chief veterinarian of the Dhaka Municipal Crporation. ``We
must find out an alternative.''
   Karim said the explosion in the numbers of stray dogs has
created a potential health threat. About 30 dogs are killed daily,
which puts only a small dent in a population estimated in the tens
of thousands.
   He said eight dog-killing squads began operating in Dhaka on
Oct. 1 and killed at least 646 stray dogs in one month. ``The
campaign will continue'' until all stray dogs are killed, he said.
   The dogs are caught by large iron tongs and a poisonous solution
of magnesium sulfate is injected into the heart, killing the
animals within two minutes, said a corporation veterinarian who
spoke on condition of anonymity.
   There is no dependable estimate of the street dog population of
the capital, the country's largest city with 6 million people.
Officials believe the figure is between 70,000 and 80,000.
   ``September-October is the breeding season for dogs when their
population sometimes reaches 80,000,'' said Karim.
   The corporation pays 10 takas, about 30 cents, to the dog
catchers for every canine captured and killed.
   Authorities say the main complaints against the animals are that
they are likely to bite people and spread rabies.
   There are no statistics on dog bites, but newspapers often
report dogs attacking and biting people at night when streets are
deserted.
   An official of the Veterinary Public Health Department said
Japan has offered about $2.5 million for a project to vaccinate
stray dogs against diseases.
   The extermination has not evoked any public reaction. Few
Bangladeshis keep pets, and there is no branch of the Society for
Prevention of Cruelty to Animals in the country. In 1978, some
owners of pet dogs formed a kennel club, but it closed in 1980.
   ``The dog-killing campaign is deplorable,'' said Sadia
Chowdhury, a TV newscaster who was a member of the kennel club.

   Czechoslovakia, promoting a cautious brand of
reform, will convert part of its renowned munitions industry to
civilian production, a senior Prague official said Tuesday.
   U.S. businessmen are invited to join the new ventures and also
to use Czechoslovakia as a beachhead to potential Soviet and other
East European markets, Richard Sumann, director general of the
Foreign Trade Ministry, told the U.S. Chamber of Commerce.
   He spoke as Czechoslovakia, trailing its neighbors in political
reform, announced the lifting of restrictions on foreign travel by
its citizens.
   ``We are highly interested in the quickest conversion of
armament production capacities and shift toward the civil sector
production,'' Sumann said.
   His statements reflected recent cautious efforts by
Czechoslovakia to join the trend toward ``perestroika,'' or
restructuring, now bringing dramatic changes in its Warsaw Pact
neighbors, Poland, Hungary, the Soviet Union and East Germany. In
reforming the economy, ``we would like to intensify trade and
cooperation with the West,'' he asserted.
   Cooperation ``with the former arms producers could ... be of
great interest to foreign partners, because of the existing modern
capacities and qualified personnel in the Czechoslovak armament
industry,'' Sumann said.
   Czechoslovak industry, led by the Skoda Works of Plzen,
producers of tanks and artillery, has been considered a major
arsenal of the Soviet Union and other pact nations.
   Despite a long industrial tradition, the country's economy is
stagnating from ``overregulation, overtaxation and overspending,''
Sumann said, and one of the most important cost-cutting measures
will be ``overall reduction of armament production.''
   He gave no figures on the planned cut.
   Sumann also said his country needs ``more democracy in public
life,'' but emphasized a gradual approach to reform by the
hard-line communist leadership.
   The economic reform in Czechoslovakia will be gradual, he said.
``We prefer a pragmatic step-by-step approach, and are determined
to avoid chaos in the transition.'' He made no mention of
privatizing the country's many government industries.

<TEXT>
   The state Senate today took up a bill
that could give Pennsylvania the most restrictive abortion law in
the country.
   If the measure is passed and signed as expected by Democratic
Gov. Robert Casey, Pennsylvania could become the first state to
take advantage of a U.S. Supreme Court ruling in July allowing new
curbs on abortion.
   The House approved the measure 143-58 last month. The Senate
Rules Committee on Monday endorsed the bill 11-5 without discussion.
   Sen. James C. Greenwood, a pro-choice Republican from suburban
Philadelphia, noted that anti-abortion forces held the votes to
pass the bill and said as the debate got under way, ``We're about
to cross an historic threshold.''
   Pennsylvania's Legislature has traditionally been strongly
anti-abortion.
   Before the Senate session, more than 100 anti-abortion activists
held a prayer vigil in the Capitol rotunda. Outside, several high
school students from suburban Philadelphia ripped open cardboad
boxes and wrote slogans saying, ``Come help to do the right thing _
Keep it legal ... Vote pro-choice.''
   ``We think this country was founded on choice and we need to
have choice in this country,'' said Lisa Bruno, a high school
senior.
   A few steps away was an anti-aborttion sign with a graphic
picture of an aborted fetus, an American flag and the words,
``Abortion, babies suffer brutal pain.''
   Pennsylvania's chapter of the National Organization for Women
said it had delivered 50,000 names on petitions and thousands of
letters from pro-choice advocates to the office of Lt. Gov. Mark
Singel, who presides over the Senate.
   The bill would require women to notify their husbands if they
plan to get an abortion; prohibit abortions because of the fetus'
sex; ban abortions after the 24th week of pregnancy except in cases
where the mother faces death or irreversible harm, and establish a
24-hour waiting period.
   Also, the proposal would regulate the medical use of tissue from
aborted fetuses, and doctors would be required to inform a woman of
the likely age of the fetus before performing an abortion and
explain the risks and alternatives.
   An attempt by Florida's Gov. Bob Martinez to take advantage of
the U.S. Supreme Court decision upholding a restrictive Missouri
abortion law fell flat last month when the Legislature flatly
rejected a package of bills.
   In Pennsylvania, senators favoring a pro-choice position have
usually accounted for fewer than 20 votes in the 50-member chamber.
   Sen. Roy Wilt, a pro-choice Republican, said he would offer
amendments calling for a referendum on the bill, eliminating the
requirement that husbands be notified, and revising the waiting
period so that women living 50 or more miles from a clinic would
have to make only one trip.
   Because of a maze of procedural rules, pro-choice senators were
expected to face a tough time getting the amendments even
considered. At least 26 members must first approve a motion to
consider amendments before any can be offered.
   Around the Capitol, there was no sign of the swarms of
protesters that gathered before the House vote. Senators said they
received more calls than usual, and mail on abortion was heavy.

   Leftist guerrillas waging war
against the government today declared parts of the country
``liberated territory'' and a resident said rebels in a northern
neighborhood advanced to new positions. New casualty estimates put
the number of dead at nearly 470.
   The government rejected the rebels' claims. ``The situation is
almost totally under control of the army,'' said Miguel Salavarria,
El Salvador's ambassador to the United States.
   A rebel communique said guerrillas had liberated parts of eight
of the country's 14 provinces. It said people's governments would
be established in them.
   At least 466 people have been killed in the fighting that has
paralyzed the capital since Saturday night, when the leftist
guerrillas mounted their largest offensive of the 10-year-old civil
war.
   Despite the government denials, it was clear that rebels held
parts of northern and eastern neighborhoods in San Salvador,
controlling some from positions in tall buildings.
   The armed forces declared a 24-hour curfew today in seven
neighborhoods, saying it was because of the danger of snipers.
   Thousands of residents were trapped after combat intensified
Monday night between rebels and the government, whose jets and
helicopter gunships rocketed rebel positions in poor neighborhoods.
   Looting was reported in supermarkets in some poor neighborhoods.
   Rebel leaders in the occupied zones called on the armed forces
to observe a brief cease-fire to allow residents to get food, water
and medical supplies. An armed forces spokesman said he was not
authorized to respond to the proposal.
   As combat intensified, hundreds of people fled the densely
populated Zacamil neighborhood, a working class area. Residents
said they feared the army would attack. A photographer was unable
to enter the zone because of the heavy fighting.
   One Zacamil resident said by telephone that the rebels were
advancing and taking up new positions closer to military
installations.
   Civilian casualties were high as government troops and rebels
exchanged gunfire in densely populated districts.
   Along a wide arc on San Salvador's northern fringe, rebels
installed themselves in homes and apartments and put snipers in
church towers and tall buildings. People in rebel-held areas said
food and water were in short supply.
   Fighting intensified Monday night in northeastern San Salvador
when rebels attacked the San Benito national police batallion near
the military headquarters.
   ``We came down from the mountains and we're going to stay
here,'' a guerrilla who identified himself only as Porfirio said
earlier Monday. ``We're winning so far and we have their morale
down.''
   He gestured with his AK-47 assault rifle toward soldiers in the
distance.
   ``The combat is hard, the boys (guerrillas) are in all the high
buildings and control the movement of the soldiers,'' said a rescue
worker with the Salvadoran Red Cross.
   Col. Raul Arturo Lopez, a spokesman for the joint chiefs of
staff, said today that 309 guerrillas and 106 soldiers had died in
the fighting nationwide. He gave the number of civilian deaths as
17, but morgues on Monday said there were at least 51.
   Hospitals said 421 civilians had been injured in San Salvador.
Lopez said 160 guerrillas, 231 soldiers and 86 civilians had been
wounded.
   Medical workers at the main public hospital said the majority of
people brought in today had been wounded by rocket fire in
northern, eastern and southern parts of the city.
   Few of the city's 1 million people were on the streets Monday
and nearly all downtown stores were closed.
   The U.S. Embassy said 1,500 of the rebels' estimated 7,000
regulars were fighting in the capital. The government has 45,000
soldiers.
   The embassy listed the six other provinces where combat was
reported as Santa Ana, San Miguel, La Paz, Usulutan, Chalatenango
and San Vicente. The rebels launched the offensive with attacks on
35 to 40 military outposts in the capital and provinces.
   In San Miguel, 85 miles to the east, a hospital employee said
Monday by telephone, ``We have heard the fighting since Saturday.
The guerrillas have occupied outlying neighborhoods and the people
are discouraged, without electricity, and only some people dare to
go out.''
   The rebels said the offensive was intended to pressure the
rightist government into negotiating in good faith. They suspended
peace talks last week to protest the Oct. 31 bombing of a leftist
union hall that killed 10 people, blaming the government.
   President Alfredo Cristiani on Sunday announced a state of
siege, suspending free speech, freedom of movement and the right to
assemble. He also imposed a dust-to-dawn curfew.
   Television stations broadcast their usual programs, but were not
allowed to transmit news.
   Cristiani, who took office in June, heads the Nationalist
Republican Alliance. His party has been linked to death squads that
operated with virtual impunity early in the war and are blamed for
most of the 70,000 deaths in the conflict. Most victims were
civilians.
   Col. Rene Ponce, the armed forces chief of staff, said Monday
night in a television address that government troops had
encountered ``problems'' in neighborhoods around the capital.
   He insisted, however, that ``there is no zone under their
(rebel) control.''
   Military planes fired rockets Monday afternoon into the eastern
neighborhoods of Venecia and Conacaste, trying to drive out
guerrillas. Some rockets struck homes, killing several civilians
and wounding others.
   Ponce, however, insisted ``The air force has not bombed anywhere
in San Salvador.'' He said: ``The men in uniform are working 24
hours a day and soon we will gain control.''
   The rebels' Radio Venceremos claimed every army attempt to
reclaim rebel positions ``has turned into a profound bloodbath
among their troops and elite corps. They have lost whole companies,
producing a big demoralization in enemy ranks.''
   The insurgents said their presence in urban zones ``has begun to
produce popular uprisings.''

   National Football League Commissioner Paul
Tagliabue assured a Senate panel Tuesday that the Super Bowl would
not move to a pay-per-view broadcast during the 1990s.
   Baseball Commissioner Fay Vincent, also before the Senate
Judiciary subcommittee on anti-trust, monopolies and business
rights, defended his sport's decision to shift 175 games to cable
television next year.
   Sen. Arlen Specter, R-Pa., asked Tagliabue for a ``flat
commitment'' that fans would not be assessed a flat fee to view a
broadcast of the Super Bowl. Such a ``pay-per-view'' arrangement is
used for some top-draw boxing matches.
   ``For the balance of this century, we do not foresee
pay-per-view for the Super Bowl game,'' Tagliabue said, but
couldn't predict beyond that.
   Lawmakers at the hearing repeatedly reminded the commissioners
that their sports enjoy special antitrust law exemptions enabling
them to behave differently than many other businesses.
   ``As a New York sports fan, I have suffered through the myriad
of problems of the pending extinction of local sports coverage on
free television,'' Rep. Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., said in prepared
testimony.
   ``Baseball shares a special compact with Congress that provides
it with a more sweeping antitrust exemption than any other sport
enjoys. If all the fan gets in exchange for this exemption is less
baseball on TV, then major league baseball is letting down its side

   A postman who says he stashed three tons of mail
in his home because he couldn't keep up with his route was
sentenced to three months in a halfway house for counseling.
   ``I did what I did to make people satisfied with my work,'' John
Cade told U.S. District Judge Lewis T. Babcock on Monday. ``It was
never my intention to hurt anyone.''
   Cade, 37, also was placed on five years' probation and ordered
to perform 200 hours of community service.
   The 16-year mailman was arrested after postal inspectors found
6,555 pounds of mail that had been stacked in his Boulder home for
up to five years. He pleaded guilty to delaying or destroying mail.
   Cade also was ordered to pay $17,615 to cover the cost of postal
refunds, equipment and time required to sort through the mail at
his house.
   The judge said Cade's involvement in the International Fantasy
Gaming Society led him to neglect his everyday obligations.
   ``The world is not a fantasy world, Mr. Cade,'' Babcock said.
``If standing here in court to be sentenced on a felony charge
doesn't bring that home to you, I don't know what will.''

<HEAD>British Tycoon Attempting Pacific Balloon Crossing</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LARRY THORSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A British tycoon who set a hot-air balloon distance
record two years ago despite crashing into the sea is about to try
to break the record with a 6,200-mile flight across the Pacific.
   Richard Branson plans to lift off from southern Japan, possibly
as early as this weekend, with ballooning expert Per Lindstrand,
who was the pilot in the 1987 record-setting flight over the
Atlantic. If all goes well, they will touch down four days later in
California.
   ``The weatherman is God on this venture,'' Branson said. ``He's
got a difficult equation to work out.''
   Ideal weather would be no wind on takeoff, 200 mph winds in the
jet stream, and no wind for the landing.
   Getting ready for a perilous flight is not all Branson is doing
in Tokyo. Before the interview, he met with Transport Ministry
officials to seek more flights on his Virgin Atlantic Airways' new
London-Tokyo route.
   Later he was visiting Fujisankei Communications Group, the
Japanese media company that recently bought a quarter of Branson's
Virgin Music Group for $150 million.
   The 39-year-old Branson dropped out of school at 15 to
concentrate on business and is one of the richest men in Britain.
His adventures, which also include crossing the Atlantic by
speedboat, are as much free advertising for his company as personal
challenges.
   None of his money will be needed for the Pacific flight, he
said, refusing to estimate the cost if sponsors hadn't been found
for everything.
   ``All my adventures of this kind I've done on the basis that it
wouldn't cost us any money,'' he said.
   The balloon, said to be the largest ever built, is named Virgin
Otsuka Pacific Flyer, honoring Otsuka Pharmaceuticals, which makes
a popular health drink and is footing among other local costs the
upkeep of 60 people at the launch site.
   A Pacific balloon crossing has been done only once, in 1981 by
three Americans and a Japanese with a helium balloon.
   Branson said he and Lindstrand hope to take their balloon
possibly as high as 40,000 feet.
   ``A balloon has never attempted this before _ to push our
balloon into this very fast jet stream,'' he said, describing the
planned ascent into winds up to 200 mph.
   ``The top of the balloon might be going 150 mph and the bottom
might be going only 50 mph. As we're going in, we'll be clinging on
for dear life as the top of the balloon heads off at great speed
and hope we don't get left behind.''
   Many weather balloons break up in the jet stream, he said, but
they don't have his strong new fabric of metallic polyester film
bonded to nylon.
   Other possible downsides: bad weather, breakdown of compressors
that keep the gondola's air livable, malfunction of the propane
burners that provide the heat to keep the balloon aloft, sudden
decompression _ ``We have eight seconds to put on oxygen masks'' _
or some disaster that might force Branson and Lindstrand to skydive
from altitudes where the temperature is as low as minus 58.
   Their training has included skydiving and physical conditioning
to help ward off seasickness if they ditch at sea and have to wait
to be rescued, as happened in the 1987 Atlantic trip.
   At that time, the 21-story-high balloon briefly touched down in
Northern Ireland and then flew out of control and splashed into the
sea a mile of Scotland. Both fliers were pulled from the water, but
they were credited with a distance record of 2,280 miles from Maine
to the point of touchdown.
   ``I'm confident we won't lose our lives,'' Branson said. ``I'm
absolutely convinced it can be done. Whether we will succeed in
doing it the first time, we won't know for two weeks. But as with
anything else we do in life, if we fail the first time, we'll be
back again next year to make sure we finish the job off.''

<TEXT>
   Relaxed travel and emigration restrictions stemming from reforms
in the East bloc are allowing more East Eh the
West. The country-by-country situation:
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   CZECHOSLOVAKIA _ Czechoslovakia, one of the last hard-line East
bloc nations, announced Tuesday it would no longer require exit
permits for travel outside the country. The governmuropeans to reacent
previously
had eased some restrictions but had kept the requirement for an
exit visa when traveling to the West.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   EAST GERMANY _ More than 3 million East German visitors have
crossed into West Germany since the Communist country opened its
borders Nov. 9. The government provides a travel visa to nearly
anyone who applies. The changes were prompted by the illegal exodus
of tens of thousands of people to the West and by massive
demonstrations. East Germans t Germany, as are ethnic Germans from the
East bloc, which helps
account for the huge emigration influx into West Germany this year.
The newly opened Berlin Wall could conceivably become a new passage
for East bloc visitors allowed to travel to other Warsaw Pact
nations like East Germany but who have difficulty getting
permission to go West.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   SOVIET UNION _ Requirements for travel documents and permission
to emigrate have eased tremendously in the last two years. On
Monday, the Soviet legislature gave preliminary approval to a bill
lifting most travel restrictions. It would allow emigration for
virtually anyone who has entry permission from another country and
no outstanding alimony obligations, criminal charges or recent
knowledge of state secrets. An estimated 200,000 will emigrate in
1989 and more than 2 million will make visits abroad. Most
emigrants go to the United States or West Germany.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   POLAND _ Any Polish citizen is eligible for a passport for all
countries and can travel without problem. The main problem for
Poles is not getting a passport, but getting a visa from the
countries they want to visit. It often takes weeks to get a visa at
the West German or U.S. embassies because so many people want to go
to those countries. In 1988, 6.5 million Poles traveled abroad,
including 1.5 million to the West.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   HUNGARY _ Beginning Jan. 1, 1989, Hungarians were allowed to
apply for five-year passports giving them the right to travel West
as often as they can afford. By June 30, Hungarians had made 3.8
million trips abroad, 18 percent up from the first half of 1987.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   BULGARIA _ Bulgaria in September passed a law similar to
Hungary's with passports issued for five years. Bulgarians who are
refused a travel document have a right to appeal the decision. As
in many East bloc countries, the major drawback to traveling West
is a shortage of convertible currency.
  
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   ROMANIA _ In this most hard-line Warsaw Pact state, Romanians
are allowed to travel to the West only once every two years, and to
other East bloc countries once a year. Romanians under retirement
age are virtually prevented from traveling West at all except in
urgent family matters, although pensioners can travel more freely.

<TEXT>
   Sen. Pete Domenici urged the government to
ban L-tryptophan, a dietary supplement suspected of causing a
potentially fatal blood illness in 17 states and the District of
Columbia.
   Health officials were investigating whether one death was caused
by the non-prescription remedy touted as ``nature's sleeping pill.''
   New Mexico on Monday banned L-tryptophan. Oregon's Health
Division recommended the product be withdrawn, and other states are
expected to issue warnings.
   The number of reported cases nationwide of the disorder
eosinophilia reached 81 Monday, said Rep. Bill Richardson, D-N.M.
The congressman was briefed by the national Centers for Disease
Control.
   The Food and Drug Administration over the weekend warned
consumers to temporarily stop taking L-tryptophan, which is sold in
health food stores to treat sleeplessness and premenstrual syndrome.
   Domenici, R-N.M., asked the FDA to go a step further and halt
L-tryptophan sales nationwide until the product's role in the
eosinophilia outbreak is known. ``The entire nation could be at
risk,'' he said.
   FDA spokesmen did not immediately return a call today, but the
CDC said in a statement that samples of tablets tested by the FDA
so far have turned up ``no obvious contaminants.'' The CDC said it,
too, is analyzing samples.
   At least 12 different brands of L-tryptophan have been
identified as having been used by the individuals who became ill in
recent weeks.
   Makers of L-tryptophan have said they don't believe their
product is to blame for the outbreak, although they said small,
disreputable companies may have produced contaminated batches.
   Eosinophilia is an abnormal elevation of a type of white blood
cells, known as eosinophils. Symptoms include severe muscle pain,
fever, joint pain and weakness.
   New Mexico Health and Environment Secretary Dennis Boyd said the
ban followed an investigation that ruled out other causes for the
outbreak.
   Most New Mexico health stores and drug stores have voluntarily
removed L-tryptophan from their shelves. The order, which is in
effect until further notice, required all retail dealers to pull
the product.
   State epidemiologist Dr. C. Mack Sewell said 30 cases of
eosinophilia have been reported in six New Mexico cities.
   Dr. David Fleming, deputy state epidemiologist in Oregon, said a
woman from his state took L-tryptophan, developed eosinophilia-like
symptoms in January and died in midsummer in another state while
seeking treatment. The Oregonian of Portland reported today that
investigators were looking to see if her death was related to
L-tryptophan.
   Tom Schafer, a spokesman for the Illinois Department of Public
Health, said Illinois would probably recommend its use be
discontinued pending an investigation. Alabama was issuing a
warning today not to use the product until more studies are done.
   Potential cases of eosinophilia has been confirmed in Arizona,
California, the District of Columbia, Florida, Georgia,
Massachusetts, Michigan, Missouri, Minnesota, New Jersey, New
Mexico, New York, Oregon, South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas, Vermont
and Virginia, the CDC said today.
   Sixteen people died nationwide in 1986 as a result of
hypereosinophilic syndrome, a form of eosinophilia, and 12 died in
1987, said Sandy Smith of the National Center for Health Statistics
in Washington.

<TEXT>
   President Bush urged visiting Tunisian
President Zine El Abidine Ben Ali to use ``caution and reserve'' in
relations with Libya's Moammar Gadhafi, a White House spokesman
said Tuesday.
   Ben Ali told reporters after his Oval Office meeting that he and
Bush ``reviewed peace initiatives for the Middle East.''
   ``I expressed to President Bush our support for the
Palestinian-U.S. dialogue, which we encouraged and which we hope
will lead to a just and lasting peace,'' said Ben Ali, here on a
private visit.
   The U.S. ambassador to Tunis, Robert Pelletreau Jr., also took
part in the White House meeting.
   Pelletreau has represented the United States in discussions with
representatives of the Palestine Liberation Organization that began
last year after PLO leader Yasser Arafat renounced terrorism and
acknowledged Israel's right to exist.
   Ben Ali said he and Bush ``discussed regional issues, outlining
recent developments in North Africa, with the creation of the Arab
Maghreb Union.''
   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said Bush and Ben Ali
``talked generally of the Middle East peace process.''
   ``President Bush expressed his views on Gadhafi, urging caution
and reserve in that area. The president thanked him for hosting the
US-PLO dialogue,'' Fitzwater added.
   Bush also indicated his support for Arab League efforts to bring
peace to Lebanon, the spokesman said.

   Democratic Sen. Claiborne Pell said
Tuesday he would run for a sixth term, squashing rumors that he
would retire in the face of an expected strong challenge from
Republican Rep. Claudine Schneider.
   ``I am humble in asking this of the citizens of Rhode Island
because I am very grateful for the trust they have placed in me for
the past 30 years and I only hope they will continue to judge me
worthy of that trust,'' said Pell, who turns 71 this month.
   Pell, chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, said
he wanted to continue ``to be part of the rapidly changing
international landscape as the prospects for peace come
increasingly within our grasp.''
   Pell, first elected in 1960, is best known for legislation that
created the system of Pell grants for college students.
   Pell said Miss Schneider would be a formidable opponent.
   ``I like her, admire her as a woman and as a member of
Congress,'' he said. ``I think she does a good job, but I think
that I will continue doing a good job as a United States senator.''
   Although Miss Schneider has yet to formally announce her
candidacy, President Bush will be the guest of honor at a
fund-raiser for her in Rhode Island on Monday and she has benefited
from several Washington fund-raisers for those planning to run
Senate campaigns.
   She has raised at least $325,000.
   ``We've been operating under the assumption that Senator Pell
would run again,'' said Robert J. Rendine, Miss Schneider's
executive director.
   In 1984, Pell trounced Republican Barbara M. Leonard with 73
percent of the vote.

<DATELINE>SOFIA, Bulgaria (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The head of Bulgaria's official human
rights group said Tuesday the government has delayed reform but he
hopes for faster action from leaders who took over for Todor
Zhivkov, the ousted Communist Party chief.
   Zhivkov, 78, resigned Friday after 35 years of enforcing a
rigid, orthodox line in Bulgaria. He was succeeded by Petar
Mladenov, 53, who served 18 years as foreign minister and is
considered more amenable to change.
   Konstantin Tellalov, chairman of the Human Rights Commission,
told The Associated Press he actively seeks legal reforms to
guarantee human rights. Independent activists, however, are
suspicious of the commission's role.
   Before and after the Human Rights Committee was set up about 1{
years ago, unofficial groups have been established that criticize
government policy on the environment, human rights and labor. Some
of their leaders accuse Tellalov's commission of promoting
government policy.
   Reports since Friday have indicated extensive changes are
imminent in the top ranks of the party and government, and Tellalov
expressed hope that would help the work of his organization.
   Tellalov was ousted from the ruling Politburo in the 1960s _ for
being too outspoken, it is said _ and afterward served as
ambassador to Canada and Venezuela. Most recently, he was Bulgarian
delegate to the U.N. committee on disarmament in Geneva.
   He also said official media had been reluctant to publish or
broadcast his appeals.
   As an example, Tellalov said, no publicity was given a
resolution the commission adopted in July urging the government to
determine who was responsible for bloody suppression of protests by
ethnic Turks two months earlier.
   ``Some 15 Bulgarian journalists attended the news conference
when we presented the resolution, but it was not published
anywhere,'' he said.
   At least seven people were killed in May when force was used
against ethnic Turks who protested an earlier campaign of force to
make them adopt Bulgarian names. Western diplomats later said up to
30 people may have been killed.
   Tellalov said Tuesday the commission resolution also called on
the Turks, officially referred to as a Moslem minority, to
reconsider leaving the country and asked Turkey to treat the new
arrivals well.
   About 320,000 of the 1.5 million Bulgarian Turks fled religious
and cultural discrimination, but nearly 60,000 have returned
because they could not find jobs or housing.
   During the interview Tuesday, Tellalov said his commission was
pressing for constitutional changes to limit the death penalty,
which he said was included in 30 sections of the penal code.
   When asked about the approximately 200 political prisoners
reported held in Bulgaria, he acknowledged it was realitvely easy
to be convicted of a political crime.
   Members of his commission had been allowed to visit eight
political prisoners in Sofia, Tellalov said.
   He criticized failure to make the constitution conform with
international covenants on human rights signed by Bulgaria. A
commission for that purpose, led by Zhivkov, was established in
1988 but has never met, Tellalov said.

<HEAD>Toyota Weighs Withdrawing Workers After Death Threats, Gunshots</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Toyota Motor Corp. is deciding whether to pull
its employees out of China after some said they were targets of
gunshots and a death threat, a spokesman for the Japanese automaker
and other sources said Tuesday.
   Three Toyota employees believe they were shot at while playing
golf in Beijing on Sunday, three days after Toyota's Beijing office
received an anonymous death threat, Japanese sources in Beijing
said on condition of anonymity.
   A letter received by the office Thursday contained a bullet and
ordered Japanese businessmen to leave China or face death, they
said.
   ``We are taking the letter fairly seriously,'' said a Toyota
spokesman in Tokyo, who would not disclose the letter's contents.
``We are currently working on details of whether to pull our people
out to Japan.''
   The Japanese sources quoted the letter as saying, ``Now that the
martial law troops are gone, our time has come. Go back to Japan.
From now, we will kill you Japanese.''
   Soldiers with automatic rifles were deployed on Beijing streets
under martial law after the army's crackdown on the pro-democracy
movement in early June, but were removed Nov. 1. Only a few armed
police stand guard in Beijing, primarily at Tiananmen Square.
   The Japanese Embassy in Beijing has asked the Chinese Ministry
of Public Security and the Foreign Ministry to investigate the
letter and the reported gunshots, a Japanese diplomat said.
   About 170 golfers, mostly Japanese, were on the course just
before lunchtime when some of them heard what sounded like bullets
whizzing by, said the diplomat, who refused to be further
identified.
   Witnesses, however, reported hearing two bursts of machine-gun
fire and believed 20-30 shots were fired, other Japanese sources
said.
   Some of the bullets hit trees on the Beijing Golf Club near the
golfers, the sources said.
   The golf course is slightly more than a mile from a shooting
range where people can rent hand guns, rifles and machine guns for
target practice.
   Three Toyota employees heard the shots, which were believed to
be stray shots from the rifle range, the Toyota spokesman in Tokyo
said.
   ``There was no feeling of threat to their lives, but they felt
uneasy and left the course immediately,'' he said.
   In July and August, letters sent to Japanese firms, including
Japan Airlines and signed by the ``Blood-Bright Dare to Die
Squad,'' threatened to kill Japanese for their ``economic
invasion'' of China.
   Japan has a large trade surplus with China, and tourists from
Japan are a major source of foreign capital. After last summer's
threats, security was increased at Japanese offices and hotels that
are home to many Japanese businessmen.
   Chinese Premier Li Peng said Tuesday before he left for a visit
to Pakistan, Bangladesh and Nepal that the shooting was ``merely an
accident'' and that authorities are investigating.
   ``Such an event could occur in any other country and I want to
say that in China there will be no greater number of such incidents
than in any other country,'' Li said.
   Li said he doubted the incidents would affect investment from
overseas.
   ``Just recently when I received an economic delegation from
Japan, that Japanese delegation was very optimistic about making
investments in China and about carrying out economic and
technological cooperation with Japan,'' Li said.
   Foreign businessmen have expressed concern over the political
and investment climate in China.

   Voters decided two bitter city commission races
Tuesday, with the only elected black on the commission locked in a
tough re-election battle.
   Dade County Elections officials expected 36 percent of the
registered voters to turn out for the runoff elections.
   Two-term incumbent Miller Dawkins, 64, said he didn't believe
his was ``the black seat,'' but he also said the city's blacks _
with about 30 percent of the voters _ deserved representation on
the commission.
   He was challenged by Joe Carollo, 34, a Cuban-born former
commissioner whose Spanish-language ads suggested ``all the Cubans
vote for Carollo.''
   In the other race, former commissioner Rosario Kennedy, 44,
trying to regain the seat she resigned this summer for an
unsuccessful run at Congress, faced Miriam Alonso, 48.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   Dawkins, an administrator at Miami-Dade Community College, led a
six-candidate primary Nov. 7 by 691 votes over Carollo. ``Black
Seat in Jeopardy'' was the front-page headline in The Miami Times,
a black-oriented weekly newspaper.
   Dawkins was supported by some Hispanic leaders who said it was
important symbolically to have at least one black on the commission.
   Carollo, a former police officer who served two terms on the
commission before losing the 1987 election, ran a slashing campaign
that linked Dawkins with a drug trafficker and called him the worst
commissioner in Miami history. In his fiery years on the
commission, Carollo often brought his anti-Communism into
commission debates.
   Some key Cuban-American leaders had backed Cuban-born attorney
Victor De Yurre in his 1987 defeat of Carollo.
   Mayor Xavier Suarez, easily re-elected last week to a new four
year-term, called Carollo disruptive and supported Dawkins.
   De Yurre and ``Anglo'' J.L. Plummer will be up for re-election
in two years. The mayor also sits on the commission.
   Ms. Kennedy charged Ms. Alonso with ``a penchant for
demagoguery.'' Her commercials called Ms. Alonso ``an opportunist
who does not respect the law,'' a reference to a 1988 court
decision that knocked Ms. Alonso off the Dade County commission
ballot because of a residency violation.
   Ms. Alonso, a Little Havana populist, concentrated her campaign
among Hispanic voters. She led the six-candidate primary by 235
votes.
   Athalie Range, who is black, was picked as interim commissioner
after Ms. Kennedy's resignation. She did not seek election to a
full term.
   Miami's 104,232 registered voters for the nonpartisan races
included 44,034 foreign-born Hispanics _ estimates of all Hispanics
range to 50 percent _ 32,021 blacks and 28,199 non-Latin whites, or
Anglos.

<TEXT>
   One of the astronauts who will fly
a satellite retrieval mission at Christmastime said Tuesday that if
the crew doesn't snag the bus-size target it will mean a great loss
to science as well as a blow to U.S. prestige.
   ``If we don't get LDEF back, there's absolutely no science from
that mission,'' said G. David Low. ``It's a completely passive
satellite and no data has been transmitted to Earth. So it's a
complete loss of that mission if we don't get it back.''
   LDEF is an 11-ton, 30-foot-long payload of experiments placed in
orbit by another shuttle crew in 1984. It was to have been
retrieved a year later, but schedule changes and the 1986
Challenger explosion delayed a rescue mission.
   Now, with LDEF expected to crash back into Earth's atmosphere in
February, a five-person crew is to fly the space shuttle Columbia
in pursuit of the huge satellite, with liftoff scheduled for Dec.
18.
   They will follow another holiday shuttle flight into space. A
secret Defense Department mission to be flown by a five-man
Discovery crew is scheduled to lift off Thanksgiving Eve, Nov. 22.
NASA announced the new date earlier Tuesday. The launch was delayed
two days because of potential wiring problems in electronic control
units on Discovery's solid fuel booster rockets.
   ``We hope that even though we'll be gone from our families and
loved ones for Christmas, that we'll be able to bring back a great
big Christmas present for all the scientists that are working on
the LDEF,'' said astronaut Dan Brandenstein who will command
Columbia.
   ``I think it looks pretty bad for the United States to allow
something like that to come in and re-enter,'' Low said. ``It's big
enough and it's massive enough that there are pieces that would
survive re-entry and you always take a chance of hitting something
or doing some damage to something.''
   He said that the chances of LDEF chunks hitting anything are
very remote because it flies mostly over oceans, ``But I think it's
poor form to let something like that come back.''
   Brandenstein, Low and their crewmates held a news conference and
individual interviews Tuesday to discuss their 10-day mission that
will have them orbiting the Earth on Christmas.
   The other Columbia crew members are pilot Jim Wetherbee and
mission specialists Bonnie Dunbar and Marsha Ivins.
   They will deploy a Navy communications satellite before
Brandenstein and Wetherbee begin a complex set of maneuvers to
track down LDEF, which Dunbar is to grab on the fourth day of the
flight by reaching out with a 60-foot robot arm, pulling it into
the cargo bay.
   The satellite is crammed with 57 science, technology and
materials experiments which more than 200 scientists have been
waiting to examine for nearly six years. They mainly want to know
how various materials have withstood the long exposure to the space
environment, information that will help in designing permanent
space stations and other long-term spacecraft such as those planned
for a space-based missile defense system.
   ``The vehicle is invaluable to us,'' said the mission's flight
director, Al Pennington. ``Almost every material known has been
sitting up there in space being bombarded by atomic oxygen and
other space materials for six years.''

<TEXT>
   Czechs won a concession from their
hard-line Communist leadership Tuesday, with the government saying
they would no longer need exit visas to travel to the West.
   Premier Ladislav Adamec said his government regards ``tourism as
the citizens' important right to get to know the world, gain
experience and establish personal contacts.''
   His announcement came five days after neighboring East Germany
threw open its borders to allow citizens to travel freely to the
West for the first time in nearly three decades. Millions have
taken advantage of the new freedom.
   Hungary and Poland, which have been at the forefront of East
bloc reforms, also allow their citizens to travel freely to the
West.
   Adamec did not say when the new regulations would take effect,
but government sources insisting on anonymity said it would be Jan.
1.
   ``The processing of travel documents is being speeded up,''
Adamec told the Federal Assembly, or parliament. ``For travel to
non-Socialist countries and to Yugoslavia exit visas will not be
necessary.''
   Czechoslovak citizens previously wishing to travel to the West
had to obtain a passport and then apply for exit visas with
Interior Ministry authorities. This process requires stamps of
approval from local Communist Party branches, employers and the
army and takes up to 30 days.
   Under the new rules, those wishing to travel to the West still
must apply for visas from the Western country they wish to visit.
   Yugoslavia does not require visas from Czechoslovak citizens.
The Yugoslav Adriatic coast is a favorite summer travel spot for
Czechs. Travel to other East bloc countries is visa-free except for
Poland and the Soviet Union.
   President Bush praised Adamec's announcement.
   ``The people of Czechoslovakia have the same aspirations for
freedom that others have, and I would expect we'd see further
changes there, just as we have seen in Poland, Hungary and in (East
Germany),'' Bush said. ``So it's a very good and encouraging step.''
   Czechoslovakia has been among the most resistant countries in
the Soviet bloc to political reforms and has cracked down on
dissent, but it has gradually allowed its citizens greater freedom
to travel.
   In the past two years, Prague has allowed thousands of
Czechoslovaks to vacation in the West. In the summer months, cars
with Czech license plates are a common sight on Austrian and West
German highways.
   The number of visits by Czechoslovak citizens to the West
increased last year by 30 percent over the previous year, Adamec
said. The government will take steps to remove unnecessary red tape
to make travel easier, he said.
   ``Our aim is that Czechoslovakia become a country for which
travel and tourism represent not only a significant sum in the
state budget, but also the satisfaction of its citizens,'' he said
in the nationally televised speech.
   Two years ago Czechoslovakia relaxed hard currency restrictions,
permitting its 15.5 million citizens to keep foreign currency
earmarked for travel abroad in their bank accounts and withdraw it
without a special application. The move eased travel abroad.
   Czechoslovaks must prove they have the necessary hard currency
for travel to the West, either in an account, or a guarantee for
expenses from a host abroad.
   Adamec did not say anything about these currency stipulations
and it was unclear whether they would continue to be in effect
after the exit visa regulation is lifted.
   In July, the government further eased travel restrictions,
recognizing required invitations from abroad from anyone living in
the West including emigres who left the country illegally.
Previously the invitations had to come from family.
   The government also lifted restrictions on Czechoslovaks wishing
to emigrate abroad to join family members who left their country
illegally.
   Despite the travel liberalizations, however, authorities often
have prevented prominent dissidents from traveling by confiscating
their passports.

   President Mikhail S. Gorbachev on Tuesday praised
the dramatic reforms in Eastern Europe for opening opportunities
for human contact, but he said no one should claim a victory in the
Cold War.
   With a week of dramatic developments in East Germany, Bulgaria
and Czechoslovakia behind them, Gorbachev met with French Foreign
Minister Roland Dumas and made his most detailed remarks about the
changes.
   ``They are extremely different in their starting conditions,
economic possibilities, in their level of political culture and
historical heritage,'' Tass paraphrased Gorbachev as saying of the
East European countries involved. He did not name them, adding,
``But they have a common direction, which fosters the building of a
European home for it makes the countries closer, more open and
creates new opportunities for human contact and an equal exchange.''
   At the same time, the Kremlin chief told Dumas it was ``useless
to shout about a victory in the Cold War, about the collapse of
this or that social system.'' He said a realistic analysis of
changes and work toward a ``balance of interests'' should replace
such claims.
   In an earlier meeting, Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard A.
Shevardnadze and his French counterpart clashed over whether
reunification of Germany is Nov. 13: 7.68

   Sen. Claiborne Pell, D-R.I., chairman of the

   ``I have the best job anyone could have and I would like to
continue in that job,'' the 71-year old senator said.
   Pell's announcement put to rest speculation he would retire, and
Democratic leaders said his decision would help the party retain
its control of the chamber in the 1990 elections. Democrats now
hold a 55-45 edge.
   The veteran senator is expected to face a tough challenge from
Rep. Claudine Schneider, R-R.I.
   ``She's a good woman, a good congresswoman, and I have great

   Pell was first elected in 1960. Among current members, only two

   President Bush extolled the link between
education and liberty as he signed a proclamation Tuesday making
this American Education Week.
   ``We are here today not to flunk our system, but to earn a
higher grade,'' Bush said at a ceremony that drew 150 educators and
students to the White House.
   ``As a nation, we proclaim that America is serious about lifting
the hope and the dreams of young Americans, serious about education
and the future,'' he said.
   Bush displayed a ``Solidarnosc'' bracelet he was wearing as a
gift from Polish labor leader Lech Walesa, to whom he gave the
Presidential Medal of Freedom Monday night.
   ``This concern with education is to be found wherever men and
women seek to extend human liberty,'' said the president. He said
he was ``deeply impressed by the changes that are underway in
Poland and the fervent commitment of the Polish people to make that
change permanent through education.''
   Bush also made a pitch for parents to be given ``the power to
choose their children's schools,'' and for schools to be able to
hire ``knowledgeable'' non-education majors as teachers.
   American Education Week, Nov. 12-18 this year, has been observed
annually since 1921. It is sponsored by the Department of
Education, 10 national education groups and the American Legion.
   Bush was joined on stage by representatives of each group and
several local students, who presented him with a bronze statue of
children's hands holding the groups' ``Flag of Liberty and
Learning.''
   ``Look at that! Isn't that beautiful!'' Bush exclaimed as the
three-foot-high bronze was unveiled.
   As Bush began to depart, Kevin Dauray, 9, a fourth-grader in a
wheelchair from Patrick Henry School in Alexandria, Va., piped up,
``Can I have your autograph?''
   The president quickly obliged the boy, penning his ``G. Bush''
on one of the cards he had been reading from.

<DATELINE>COLOMBO, Sri Lanka (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The three leaders of a radical
Sinhalese group that has waged a violent campaign to overthrow the
government were captured and killed this week, the government said
Tuesday.
   Foreign Minister Ranjan Wijeratne also said six of the group's
seven Politburo members have been killed.
   Upatissa Gamanayake, second-in-command of the ultra-nationalist
People's Liberation Front, was shot to death Monday night when he
tried to escape, Wijeratne said.
   Gamanayake, 36, was regarded as heir apparent to the front's
founding leader, Rohana Wijeweera, who was reportedly killed Sunday
along with his No. 3 man.
   A former front leader predicted the group, formed 22 years ago,
would disintegrate.
   The foreign minister said Gamanayake was captured on information
provided by Wijeweera and was taking interrogators to a front
hideout when he tried to jump out of the vehicle. Soldiers shot and
killed him, Wijeratne said.
   Wijeweera was captured Sunday in the central Kandy hill district
and brought to Colombo, where he was killed, Wijeratne announced
Monday. He said the front's third-in-command, H.B. Herath, was
killed at the same time.
   The official said both were killed when Wijeweera was bringing
authorities to the front's headquarters in Colombo. He said Herath
pulled a pistol and shot at his colleague and that security forces
then shot and killed both men.
   Wijeratne refused to identify the one Politburo member who has
not been killed, saying only that he is at large.
   The People's Liberation Front began a terror campaign in August
1987 to protest the government's signing of an accord intended to
end a war by Tamil rebels. The front said the accord granted too
many concessions to Tamils, who comprise about 18 percent of Sri
Lanka's 16 million people.
   It accused the Sinhalese-controlled government of selling out
its own people and threatened to kill all who supported the accord.
   More than 6,000 people have been killed the past years. The
government initially blamed the front for most of the killings, but
when charred bodies of young Sinhalese men started turning up along
roadsides, officials said pro-government vigilante squads were
slaying suspected front members.
   Human rights activists, opposition politicians and front
supporters also accused government security forces of killing some
suspected front supporters.
   Victor Ivan, a former front leader, predicted the front would
disintegrate with the deaths of Wijeweera and his chief aides.
   Ivan was jailed after leading the front's unsuccessful uprising
against the government in 1971. Released with other front members
during a general pardon in 1977, he now edits an independent
political magazine.
   The People's Liberation Front was founded in 1967 by Wijeweera,
an avowed Marxist.
   It tried to overthrow the government of Prime Minister Sirimavo
Bandaranaike in 1971, but the uprising was put down and at least
20,000 people killed.
   The front later dabbled in mainstream politics, then went
underground before emerging again as a major force in 1987.

<HEAD>Hooded Former Drug Dealer Says Detroy Coca Crops</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JERRY ESTILL</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A convicted drug dealer, who says he has sent
30 to 40 former colleagues to prison since turning states evidence,
told a House panel Tuesday the only effective way to combat cocaine
trade is to destroy the Central American coca crop.
   ``Cut off the snake's head and the snake will die,'' said ``Mr.
Witness,'' as he was addressed by a number of congressmen.
   Accompanied by a trio of federal marshals, the witness' identity
was protected by a hood over his head and an electronic device that
distorted his voice.
   ``Go after the crop or the chemicals that process the coca,'' he
said. ``I don't think anything else will do any good.''
   He said stepped up enforcement efforts ``is forcing (cartel
leaders) to move, it is forcing them to spend money, but it is not
stopping them,'' though he said the ``common man'' in Colombia no
longer supports them.
   He said there would be wide local support for destroying the
coca crops in Colombia and neighboring countries if the United
States provided adequate economic support to reimburse the peasant
growers who would lose their main source of income.
   The witness, a U.S. native, said he got into the drug business
as an outgrowth of arrangements he made to get his Colombian-born
wife and her family into the United States illegally.
   He told the subcommittee on financial institutions supervision,
regulation and insurance that he never personally laundered drug
money and had little first hand knowledge that might help the panel
draft new legislation to curb the conversion of illictly obtained
money into legitimate accounts.
   Moreover, he disagreed with the assessment of several committee
members that the most effective way to attack international drug
cartels is to trace the money flow to them.
   Though the witness was miscast as an authority on the parts of
drug law within the subcommittee's jurisdiction, the panel members
eagerly peppered him with questions about the drug trade in general.
   He said he was among ``four-to-six'' major cocaine importers in
the Miami area before he was arrested in 1985. He has been in the
federal witness protection program since being released from prison
in 1987 and has testified in a number of trials.
   Rep. Frank Annunzio, D-Ill., the House Banking subcommittee
chairman, introduced the mystery witnesses as a man who had
smuggled 56 tons of cocaine into the Miami areas and said he has
enough information to personally lead to the convictions of several
major drug lords being sought for extradition to the United States.
   Annunzio said he plans to closely question Internal Revenue
Service agents and other federal enforcement officials in
subsequent hearings about the apparent ease with which drug dealers
circumvent existing laws drafted to curb money laundering.
   ``Adherence to the letter of the law is not enough,'' said
Annunzio. ``Bankers must take one step more, and actively seek to
uncover the suspicious and shady transaction, and then report it.''
   The mystery witness said he had been told by former associates
who handled that end of the business that it was relatively easy to
accomplish.
   ``The money launderers ... that was their speciality,'' he said,
adding that the specialists would approach bankers ``wine and dine
them and make them an offer.''
   So far as taking cash to foreign banks, the witness said he
sometimes did that himself and that the procedure was very simple.
``I'd put it in a suitcase, get on a plane and leave,'' he said.
   Would a death penalty have deterred him from dealing drugs?
asked the subcommittee staff director.
   ``Yes I would say it would have,'' responded the witness after
pausing for several seconds to stare through his mask at the
ceiling high above. ``I would not have gotten into the business. I
would run from them at the beginning.''
   He had said earlier that once in, he had no choice. ``I tried on
several occasions (to retire) and I was told the only way out was a
cemetery or a jail,'' he said.

<HEAD>Congresswoman Calls on Bush to Withdraw Troops fro Europe</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Democratic congresswoman on Tuesday called
on President Bush to withdraw all U.S. troops from Western Europe,
claiming the days in which the Warsaw Pact nations marched ``to the
beat of a Soviet drummer'' are over.
   Rep. Patricia Schroeder, D-Colo., a member of the House Armed
Services Committee, said in a two-page letter to Bush that the
``rusting and crumbling of the Iron Curtain'' provides an
unprecedented opportunity to foster democracy and reduce the budget
deficit by removing American combat troops from Europe.
   Schroeder suggested that Bush seize the initiative at his Dec.
2-3 summit meeting with Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev in
the Mediterranean near Malta.
   ``What you should propose is this: An immediate withdrawal of
all U.S. combat troops from Western Europe in exchange for a
withdrawal of all Soviet combat troops from Eastern Europe,''
Schroeder said.
   Bush proposed at the 40th anniversary of the NATO alliance in
May a ceiling of 275,000 on U.S. and Soviet ground and air force
personnel, which would require a reduction of about 30,000 U.S.
troops and about 325,000 Soviet troops.
   But Schroeder said the dramatic turn of events in Eastern Europe
in the past few weeks makes it clear that ``the days during which
the Kremlin could count on the arms of Poland, the German
Democratic Republic and Hungary to march to the beat of a Soviet
drummer are over.''

   Lisbon Sausage Co. Inc. of New Bedford, Mass.,
has voluntarily recalled 300 pounds of product distributed to
grocery stores in southeastern Massachusetts and Rhode Island
because some of it may be contaminated by a food poisoning
organism, the Agriculture Department said Tuesday.
   The organism, Listeria monocytogenes, could cause serious
illness and possible death, officials said.
   ``Although no illnesses have been reported, we strongly urge
consumers to avoid even opening the product and to return it
immediately to the establishment where it was purchased,'' said
Lester M. Crawford, administrator of the department's Food Safety
and Inspection Service.
   The recalled product is ``Amaral's Chourico,'' described as a
Portuguese smoked pork sausage product. It is sold in one-pound
vacuum sealed plastic packages that contain two sausages. The name
``Amaral's Chourico'' is printed on the label, and ``Est. 219'' is
printed inside the USDA inspection seal on the label.
   All of the recalled product carries the sell-by date 1-29-90 or
Jan. 29 90'' stamped on the package. The product is sold
exclusively to grocery stores. No other product made by the firm
has been involved.
   Food contaminated by the bacterium can call listeriosis, a
``rare but potentially fatal disease,'' the agency said. ``In
general, healthy people are at little risk from listeriosis; most
vulnerable are those with weakened immune systems _ infants,
pregnant women, the elderly and the chronically ill.''
   Consumers with questions about the recall can phone the agency's
toll-free hotline at 1-800-535-4555 from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. EST,
Monday through Friday. Callers in the Washington metropolitan area
should call 447-3333.

   Holiday turkeys will cost less but hams will
be more expensive, the Agriculture Department said Tuesday.
   ``Consumers will find adequate supplies of turkey and ham for
the holiday season,'' the department's Economic Research Service
reported. ``Prices likely will be lower for turkeys but higher for
hams than last year.''
   Turkey production in the fourth quarter may be up about 12
percent from a year ago, with frozen inventories up slightly. Ham
supplies are expected to decline slightly despite an increase in
cold storage stocks.
   ``Total red meat and poultry production is expected to set a
record in 1989 and again in 1990,'' the report said. ``Among the
major components, only beef production may decline in 1989,
reflecting the reduced cattle inventory.''
   Looking to 1990, the report said beef production may increase
somewhat because of more cattle going into feedlots before
slaughter, resulting in more ``fed'' beef.
   ``In both years, pork output could remain relatively large,''
the report said. ``Broiler output will continue to grow'' because
of improved profits in recent years. ``Turkey production also is
expected to grow but at a lower rate than broilers because returns
are being squeezed.''

   A liquor distributor and Boston models are using a
shimmering gold mesh dress to get the well-heeled to give money to
those who can barely afford their next meal, much less a pair of
shoes.
   Wednesday's fashion show will benefit the Massachusetts
Coalition for the Homeless, a statewide group that does everything
from lobby for the homeless to refinish furniture for people moving
out of shelters.
   The coalition says between 5,000 and 8,000 people inhabit
Boston's streets and shelters.
   After the benefit, Michel Roux, the president of the company
that distributes Absolut Vodka, which owns the golden dress, plans
to take the $532,000 garment on the road for similar fund-raisers.
   ``I don't think we have to look at it from the angle of gold,''
Roux said. ``I think we have to look at it from the angle of the
novelty, the uniqueness of the dress, which will certainly bring
attention to the cause.''
   Model Rachel Williams will be draped in the 8-pound, 18-karat
gold dress designed by Anthony Ferrara during the show at a Boston
nightclub. The Models for Boston Benefit for the Homeless hope to
raise $40,000 from the show, said Craig Sutton, a spokesman for the
event.
   The group will give 100 percent of the proceeds to homeless
causes, Sutton said, adding that Absolut and the models'
organization will cover costs of the evening.
   Roux got the idea of featuring the dress, a clingy short tank,
after he spotted Ferrara wearing a gold mesh scarf. Ferrara designs
for such stars as Cher and Barbra Streisand.
   Roux keeps the dress in a safe. ``You roll it in paper and keep
it like you keep any jewelry,'' he said.
   The show also features a warmup act: a sterling silver dress
valued at $100,000, also owned by Absolut.
   Fund-raisers say they recognize that the glitz and glamour of a
fashion show seems at odds with the hard reality of homelessness.
But Sandra Blevins, a model who helped create the idea three years
ago, said people in the fashion industry have an obligation to
contribute to the cause.
   ``It looks a little strange from the outside but it really makes
sense. Everybody should get involved,'' said Blevins, who has done
volunteer work at local homeless shelters. ``We make money off of
people who are well-dressed.''
   Meryl Langbort, of the Massachusetts Coalition for the Homeless,
said her group welcomes the chance to reach people who might not
otherwise think about the homeless.
   ``Certainly the money is important. Certainly we need it to
operate. But what's so important about something like this is it
gets the message out there,'' she said.
   Admission is $40, which pays for food but not drinks.
   The mesh for the dress was made by a Massachusetts firm that
specializes in metal wear for less fashionable garb: outerwear for
meatpackers.
   Whiting &amp; Davis makes a stainless steel ring mesh that protects
workers from knife wounds. Earlier in the century, the company,
which started out as a jewelry firm, created a line of small gold

<HEAD>Christian Lawmakers Defy Aoun, Hoss Works to Build Government</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Premier-designate Salim Hoss began
parliamentary consultations to form a new government Tuesday, and
some Christian lawmakers appeared willing to defy Gen. Michel Aoun
and work with the Moslem leader.
   Rival Shiite Moslem militiamen clashed with machine guns and
rocket-propelled grenades in Beirut's southern slums. Three
militiamen were reported wounded.
   Aoun, the Christian army leader, told reporters any national
unity government would be a ``crime against Lebanon's sovereignty,
and anyone taking part in it will be a criminal.''
   Nevertheless, four Maronite Parliament deputies held a meeting
to consider an offer from Hoss to join his government, which will
institute reforms intended to end Lebanon's 14-year-old civil war.
   They included George Saadeh, leader of the right-wing Phalange
Party, the largest political force in the Christian enclave
controlled by Aoun's troops.
   ``The general wasn't able to push a single Syrian soldier an
inch backward in his so-called liberation war,'' said deputy Butros
Harb, another who participated in the meeting. ``Why doesn't the
general give peace a chance?''
   Aoun in March declared a ``war of liberation'' to drive the
40,000 Syrian troops from Lebanon, where they were deployed in 1976
under a mandate to quell the civil war. Aoun said they abrogated
the mandate by siding with the Moslems.
   The violence ended with an Arab League-brokered cease-fire in
September, and last month, Lebanese legislators meeting in Taif,
Saudi Arabia, approved a peace accord clearing the way for election
of a president and creation of a national reconciliation government.
   Newly elected president Rene Mouawad on Monday named Hoss prime
minister to form the government. Hoss remains prime
minister-designate until he forms a government endorsed by
presidential decree.
   Aoun has said any Christian politicians who join Hoss'
government will be banned from the Christian enclave.
   He pledged to block implementation of the peace accord because
it does not include a timetable for the withdrawal of Syrian troops.
   Saadeh has challenged Aoun to a televised debate over the accord.
   At his news conference, Aoun rejected the proposed debate,
saying, ``There is no need for any dialogue over the Taif accord. I
shall not allow it to pass.''
   No civilian casualties were reported from the one-hour flare-up
between the pro-Iranian Hezbollah and the Syrian-backed Amal
militias. But Hezbollah sources, speaking on condition of
anonymity, said three combatants from both sides were wounded.
   The two factions have long been vying for control of the 1.2
million Shiites, who make up the largest sect among Lebanon's 4
million people.
   An Amal spokesman, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the
command of a Syrian army contingent in charge of the security of
Beirut's Moslem sector intervened with the leaderships of the two
groups to stop the violence.

<TEXT>
   President Bush will fly to Houston on Thursday
to attend a funeral mass for C. Fred Chambers, a close friend from
their days in the oilfields of Texas.
   Chambers, 71, died Monday. He and Bush met in the early 1950s
when both were young oilmen in Midland, Texas. He became one of
Bush's earliest political boosters and fund-raisers.
   Barbara Bush named her late dog, C. Fred, after Chambers, and
later wrote a whimsical ``autobiography'' about the animal to raise
funds for literacy causes.
   The White House said the president and Mrs. Bush will attend the
funeral at St. Michael's Church in Houston, then return immediately
to Washington.
   Chambers, a retired Navy lieutenant commander, co-founded C&amp;K
Petroleum in Texas in 1953 and remained with the firm until 1981.
   He is survived his wife, Marion, eight children and 18
grandchildren.

   The Navy, out of concern over a string of
accidents in recent weeks, has ordered that all normal operations
cease for 48 hours while safety procedures are reviewed, the
service announced today.
   ``Navy Secretary H. Lawrence Garrett III and the Chief of Naval
Operations Carlisle A. H. Trost have ordered a Navy-wide 48-hour
safety stand-down to be conducted within the next 72 hours,'' the
Navy said in a statement.
   The order requires every ship, squadron and shore training
facility to interrupt normal operations and review basic safety and
operating procedures, said Navy spokesman Lt. Bruce Cole.
   ``It means that they will interrupt normal training, normal
flight operations, normal field operations ... to go over basic
safety procedures and make sure that everybody has the basics,''
the spokesman added.
   ``The purpose of the stand-down is to reemphasize continuing
safety awareness among all Navy personnel,'' Cole said.
   The move comes just after the latest problem for the Navy, in
which a fire broke out aboard the amphibious assault ship USS
Inchon while it underwent shipyard maintenance in Norfolk, Va., At
least 24 people were reported injured in the incident.
   In recent weeks, the service has been plagued by a number of
deadly accidents involving a training jet crashing into an aircraft
carrier off Florida, sailors who have been washed overboard on two
different aircraft carriers and the accidental bombing of a ship by
a Navy pilot in the Indian Ocean.

   The moment was solemn, but not so much so that
Lech Walesa, a twinkle in his eye, could not make a joke _ one
especially appreciated by the beefiest of the labor leaders in his
audience.
   Walesa, addressing the AFL-CIO, recalled dark days when as a
shipyard electrician he organized the strike that would lead, nine
years later, to the first non-communist government in the Soviet
bloc.
   ``When in August 1980, I jumped over the wall surrounding the
Gdansk Shipyard, I did not know what our protests would lead to,
but I knew perfectly well what it was that we had to do,'' he said.
   Now, he said, he wished that only such ``clear-cut situations''
confronted him. And with a self-effacing grin, he took note of the
pot belly that had come with the years.
   ``Maybe today,'' he said, ``I would have slightly more
difficulty jumping over that wall ....''
   Many a hefty union leader laughed with him.
   Walesa gave a bearhug to ``Brother Kirkland'' _ Lane Kirkland,
president of the federation _ and a morale-boosting salute Tuesday
to a labor movement that has seen its own role diminish and has had
no recent success to emulate what Walesa had achieved in Poland.
   When he made his way through the hotel ballroom, grasping at
hands, beaming with pleasure, the union chiefs cheered for 15
minutes.
   ``Lech, Lech, Lech, Lech,'' a Teamster chanted.
   Garment workers jumped on chairs to snap his picture;
steelworkers raised their hands in the V-sign; Walesa's fellow
electricians clapped in unison; a paperworker wearing a
``Solidarnosc'' button held aloft a red sign that, in Polish,
denounced Frank Lorenzo, president of strikebound Eastern Airlines.
   He V-signed them back and bowed at them, beaming.
   Pink-cheeked, his famous mustache trimmed and gray, Walesa said
he did not want to appear to be currying their favor but he thanked
the AFL-CIO over and over for standing beside ``the cause so many
people considered lost and which now, thanks to the stubbornness of
Poles and the perseverance of our friends, has put us on the road
to victory.''
   In martial-law Poland, in the days when Walesa was often under
arrest, the AFL-CIO quietly delivered millions of dollars to his
underground movement and smuggled in printing presses to let
Solidarity's voice be heard.
   ``You have proven to be our most steadfast allies in the trade
union struggle for human rights,'' he said.
   ``A vast movement for democracy and freedom is developing in my
country. It is changing the political face of Poland and of the
world. And that movement has been made possible only through the
peaceful struggle of working people, of trade unionists like you
and me, like us.''

<HEAD>Number Of Farm Workers Up Slightly From Last Year</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The number of workers employed by farmers
showed a seasonal decline in October but was up slightly from a
year ago, the Agriculture Department said Tuesday.
   A quarterly report said the hired work force on farms was
estimated at 983,000 during the week of Oct. 8-14, down from
1,197,000 in July. A year ago in October the work force was 976,000.
   Those did not include 308,000 ``agricultural service'' workers
provided by crew chiefs and labor contractors. In July, those
totaled 351,000 workers, and in October 1988 they were estimated at
274,000.
   Dry weather throughout most of the nation during the farm labor
survey week allowed corn and other row crop harvests to make good
progress, the report said.
   The report said the national figures for hired workers had a
sampling error of 3.5 percent.
   Average pay for all workers hired directly by farmers was $5.42
per hour, up from $5.23 in July and $5.18 a year ago, the report
said.
   For workers hired by contractors, there was no national wage
rate available, However, workers in California were reported at
$6.41 per hour, compared with $5.80 in July and $6.16 a year
earlier in October 1988. Florida workers averaged $5.15 per hour,
compared with $5.55 in July and $4.98 a year earlier.

   The town of Plymouth has taken a step
backward in communication history by hiring Stanley P. Meldrum as
town crier.
   In the days before television, before radio and even before
daily newspapers, events of the day were shouted from the town
square by the town crier. Meldrum's job will be to don Pilgrim garb
for special occasions and stroll the Plymouth waterfront shouting,
``Hear ye, hear ye,'' and describing the day's events.
   Meldrum, 72, who has had plenty of practice meeting the public
by playing Santa Claus for the past eight years, was awarded the
unpaid post after a town selectman saw him acting as a Pilgrim for
a September ``Safety First'' event and was entranced by his
performance.
   A town crier was then proposed and the selectmen went for the
idea ``as long as they didn't have to pay for it,'' Meldrum said
Tuesday.
   Provincetown also had a town crier post until the man who held
the position was fired for allegedly insulting gays.
   Meldrum, a Plymouth resident for 12 years, took some
public-speaking courses during a stint in the armed forces and is
now retired from a career in hotel management and retail. He
already has purchased his own official town crier Pilgrim uniform.
   One drawback to the post: ``I guess that makes me a
politician,'' he said, mournfully.

   If it's true that the appearance of a
house says a lot about its inhabitants, then city officials believe
George Zysk's house says too much.
   Zysk, 73, has plastered the front of his two-story home with
about 50 hand-painted, wooden signs expressing his opinions on city
issues ranging from traffic to taxes.
   City officials want the signs taken down.
   ``I'll go to jail, but I'm not taking them down,'' Zysk said,
adding that the city is trying to stifle his freedom of speech.
   Most of the 2-foot-by-3-foot signs complain about the city's
leadership and specific projects, like the proposed expansion of
the local airport.
   ``Whenever I thought something was unfair, I tried to let the
people riding by know it,'' said Zysk, who also is known for
expressing his dissatisfaction at City Council meetings and in
letters to the editor. Most of the signs went up during the last
year.
   ``Clean out City Hall _ sweep out dictators Nov. 7,'' reads one
of his crudely produced pre-election signs that remain up.
   Last Wednesday, one day after voters elected a new mayor for the
first time in eight years, city officials decided they'd seen
enough.
   He was notified he was in violation of the city's sign ordinance
and given until Monday to remove the signs. Because he hasn't
complied, officials said Tuesday they intend to take action.
   ``You can put a `For Sale' sign in front of your house, and we
certainly wouldn't take issue with that or a decorative sign or one
with a pleasant message,'' said Chuck Nowak, a building inspector
with the city's department of environmental and transportation
services.
   ``But one of his signs has a revolver on it and says `Don't
beware of the dog; Beware of Smith &amp; Wesson,' and they've gotten
progressively worse,'' Nowak said of a drawing on one sign.
   Violation of the ordinance is a misdemeanor with the penalty set
by a district court, city officials said. The case has gone to the
city attorney, though no decision about prosecution has been made.
   Nowak said the city has received several complaints about Zysk's
signs, primarily from passing motorists on the well-traveled
residential street.
   But a neighbor doesn't seem to mind.
   ``I'm a firm believer in live and let live as long as he doesn't
hurt anybody,'' said Wayne Boes, who lives next door. ``He's a good
neighbor and he's good to me and doesn't bother me a bit.''

<HEAD>Public Broadcasting Moves To Centralize Programming</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LEE BYRD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The three national public television
organizations announced Tuesday an agreement designed to enhance
their coordination and improve program scheduling and quality.
   The pact, involving the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, the
Public Broadcasting Service and the National Association of Public
Television Stations, will ``free public television from many of the
frustrations of the past and give it a jump start for the next
decade,'' according to CPB President Donald Ledwig.
   The agreement in principle, which now must be approved by the
organizations' respective boards as well as Congress, would make
CPB primarily responsible for developing new programs, while PBS
would focus on distribution, funding for existing programs, and
support of local stations.
   Public television in the United States is now a complex,
decentralized system with multiple sources of programming and
financing. As a consequence, producers spend much of their time
scrambling for money, and development of a national program
schedule is, at best, difficult.
   Congress, in the Public Telecommunications Act of 1988, directed
CPB and PBS to examine whether they could pool their resources with
those of local public television stations to improve national
programming. The agreement announced Tuesday is the outgrowth of
that mandate.
   PBS President Bruce Christensen called the tentative, three-year
agreement ``both a centralization and a consensus-building plan. As
a result, it will make the programming process more agile and
responsive to a quickly changing television environment.''
   Currently, about $262 million _ less than half of which is tax
money _ is spent annually by public television for national
programming. The agreement calls for PBS to directly manage $100
million of that amount. The CPB would handle the rest,
concentrating on the development of new programs, financing of the
new Independent Television Service, and minority productions.
   PBS will expand the powers of its new program executive,
Jennifer Lawson, under the agreement. She will be charged with
developing a multiyear schedule and financing plan, in coordination
with a new 17-member program policy committee drawing together
representatives of producers, minorities and stations in each
region of the country.
   David J. Brugger, president of the stations' association, said
the deal ``gives public television the opportunity to move forward
in developing the strongest possible national programming with the
funds available.''

<HEAD>NBC Takes Big Lead in Ratings with Cosby on Top</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JERRY BUCK</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Television Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Nielsen ratings for last week looked like
a replay of the week before as NBC led the way with six of its
half-hour comedies at the top.
   NBC's ``The Cosby Show'' was first and ABC's ``Roseanne'' was
again in fourth place. Every show in the Top 10 was a regular
series. Eight were repeaters from last week.
   NBC took a commanding lead in the A.C. Nielsen Co. ratings for
the week ended Nov. 12 with an average of 15.4. ABC was second with
12.7 and CBS was third with 11.8. A rating is the percentage of the
nation's 92.1 million homes tuned to a show.
   The Top 10 were: NBC's ``The Cosby Show,'' NBC's ``Cheers,''
NBC's ``A Different World,'' ABC's ``Roseanne,'' NBC's ``Golden
Girls,'' NBC's ``L.A. Law,'' NBC's ``Dear John'' and ``Empty Nest''
tied, CBS' ``60 Minutes,'' and NBC's ``Unsolved Mysteries'' and
ABC's ``The Wonder Years'' tied.
   CBS' ``Murder, She Wrote,'' eighth last week, fell to 15th place.
   The highest-rated special of the week was the first part of
ABC's ``Small Sacrifices,'' in which Farrah Fawcett played a woman
convicted of killing one of her own children. It tied for 12th
place with ABC Monday Night Football and ABC's ``Who's the Boss?''
   The final chapter of ``Small Sacrifices'' was to be broadcast
Tuesday night. Among the shows it pre-empted was ``Chicken Soup,''
which had its final showing last week and tied for 21st place with
NBC's ``Hunter.'' It will be replaced next week by the return of
``Coach.''
   NBC's ``Manhunt: The Search for the Night Stalker,'' which went
head-to-head against ABC's ``Small Sacrifices'' and CBS' ``The
Return of McCloud,'' was 20th. ``McCloud'' tied for 39th place with
ABC's ``Family Matters.''
   Jaclyn Smith's premiere in ``Christine Cromwell'' in the ABC
Saturday Mystery Movie was 43rd. It's the last element in the
series.
   NBC also is doing very well in the November sweeps. Month-long
sweeps occur three times a year and result in vicious competition
between networks. Advertising rates are based on the audience
levels recorded during the periods.
   The ratings for the first 11 days of the Nielsen sweeps period:
NBC 15.2, CBS and ABC 12.2, tied.
   ABC's ``World News Tonight'' remained ahead in the ratings for
the evening news shows. On Thursday, when the Berlin Wall was
opened, the ratings were ABC 12.0, CBS 10.3, NBC 10.1. NBC's Tom
Brokaw was the only anchorman at the wall that day. The ratings for
the week: ABC 11.1, CBS 10.3, NBC 10.0.
   The five bottom network shows, in descending order, were CBS'
``Peaceable Kingdom,'' CBS' ``Saturday Night with Connie Chung,''
the ABC News special ``Freedom Week'' and, in a tie for last place,
ABC's ``Living Dolls'' and CBS' ``Wolf.''

<TEXT>
   President Bush met Tuesday with four
Republican members of Congress who support abortion rights, but his
spokesman said his own anti-abortion views ``are not subject to
change.''
   The president met with Reps. Lynn Martin of Illinois, Claudine
Schneider of Rhode Island, Nancy Johnson of Connecticut and Olympia
Snowe of Maine.
   Bush also plans to speak at fund-raising event next Monday for
both Martin and Schneider.
   ``Abortion is not a test of support ... no matter what one's
position is,'' spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said.
   ``The president supports all Republicans,'' Fitzwater said. ``He
supports Republican candidates without regard to specific positions
that differ from him.''
   Afterward, Snowe said she and the other participants expressed
their views but gained no commitment from Bush.
   Snowe said the Republicans did not expect Bush to reverse
himself on abortion, but hoped ``there could be some gradations in
his position'' in the future _ such as allowing federally funded
abortions for poor women who are victims of rape or incest.
   ``We certainly mentioned the fact we were concerned about thhe more
than one
million items are displayed at the Museum of the American Indian in
upper Manhattan, N.Y.. The bulk of the collection is stored in a
Bronx, N.Y., warehouse.
   Roland Force, director of the Museum of the American Indian,
called the vote ``something we can all rejoice in.''
   ``It's important to Indians, it's important to the Smithsonian,
and it's important to this nation, and how can you do anything
better than that?'' he said in a telephone interview from New York.
   Rep. Ben Nighthorse Campbell, D-Colo., the bill's House sponsor,
said he hoped groundbreaking in Washington could occur by 1992, a
date he called meaningful because it would be the 500th anniversary
of Columbus' landfall in the New World.
   Smithsonian spokeswoman Madeleine Jacobs agreed that date was
realistic.
   Campbell also said President Bush would sign the bill Monday or
Tuesday at a ceremony on the new museum's site, between the
National Air and Space Museum and the Capitol.
   The legislation transfers the Heye collection to the
Smithsonian, which already has a significant collection of Indian
artifacts. It authorizes $10 million in 1990 for the planning,
design and construction of the national museum, and for the care
and custody of the Heye collection.
   It also mandates that the Smithsonian establish a satellite
Indian museum in the old Custom House in lower Manhattan and build
storage space for the artifacts at its museum support center in
Suitland, Md.
   The costs of building the new museum and the two other
facilities have been estimated at $175 million.
   Converting the Custom House is expected to cost $24 million,
with New York City and New York state to pay one-third each.
   In addition, the legislation stipulates that the Smithsonian,
where possible, return its collection of some 18,000 Indian remains
and funerary objects to their original tribes for burial. The
legislation authorizes more than $1.2 million in 1991 for the
Smithsonian to inventory and repatriate the remains.
   Disposition of the remains had been the last obstacle to a
successful bill. Compromise came in September, when Smithsonian
Secretary Robert McCormick Adams _ himself an anthropologist _
reversed the museum's long-held policy that the bones were
necessary for study. Indians nationwide, seeking to bury their
ancestors, heralded his decision as a watershed that will influence
other museums.

<HEAD>New Techniques Needed for Food Safety in 1990s</HEAD>

   New packaging techniques coupled with consumer
demands for fresh, chemical-free foods are challenging producers to
develop better ways of ensuring safety and informing the public,
food industry experts say.
   New safety measures and an up-front approach to consumers'
concerns have to go hand in hand with the development of new
products, according to officials who spoke on food safety issues of
the 1990s at the Food &amp; Dairy Expo, which began Saturday and ends
Wednesday.
   ``Consumers now want fresher foods,'' said David Henning,
director of quality assurance for suburban Skokie-based Kraft
General Foods, a division of Philip Morris Cos. Inc. of New York.
``They're not as anxious to have food with preservatives that in
the past controlled organisms, so we're going to have to have other
methods to ensure safety.''
   The perceived health value of fresh and refrigerated products
presents a dilemma to the food industry, said Alan Hugunin, senior
director of product technologies of the National Food Processors
Association.
   ``Whereas you can put something in a can and be sure that no
microorganisms are going to grow in there for eternity, you can't
do that with fresh and refrigerated products,'' Hugunin said.
   And better methods of packaging foods create their own
challenges.
   New packaging methods can prevent mold longer, leaving food
looking wholesome even while it grows unnoticeable organisms that
cause food poisoning, he said.
   In response, food manufacturers are increasingly using a system,
developed in the U.S. space program, of analyzing the production
process at each step from the raw material to a finished product,
according to Henning.
   The method allows food producers to prevent problems before they
occur, rather than testing food after it's been produced and _ if
there is a problem _ tracing it back to find the source, he said.
   This step-by-step method is ``the best answer anybody's come up
with yet'' to ensure food safety, Joseph Hotchkiss, an associate
professor of food chemistry and toxicology at Cornell University
said during a telephone interview Tuesday.
   But consumers seem unaware that their demands for new, fresher
foods are pushing the industry to deal with new problems involving
contamination by microorganisms. Instead, Hotchkiss said, they are
more concerned with food additives and pesticides, which are a
smaller problem.
   ``The consumer, by any objective measure, does not have the same
priorities as the scientific community on food safety,'' Hotchkiss
said.
   Hugunin said the food industry has to do a better job of
educating the public about pesticides and additives, such as the
chemical Alar, a suspected cancer-causing chemical.
   An early 1989 report on Alar-treated apples by the private
National Resources Defense Council prompted an uproar over its use,
although government and apple industry officials said the chemical
is only used on a small percentage of apples and is not dangerous
in the levels used.
   The apple industry was caught unprepared, Hugunin said.
   ``The information which was needed to respond to some of these
claims ... was just spread out all over and there was no good way
of pulling it all together quickly to respond to some of the
statements that were made,'' Hugunin said.
   As food products continue to develop and safety techniques
change, the industry has to educate consumers before concerns grow,
he said.

Association of Rockville, Md.

   President Bush on Thursday criticized the
leftist rebels of El Salvador for ``senseless bloodshed'' in the
all-out offensive that has crippled the capital of the Central
American nation.
   He also renewed a charge that the leftist Sandinista government
of Nicaragua is continuing to arm the Salvadoran guerrillas, the
Faribundo Marti National Liberation Front.
   In remarks to ministers of the Organization of American States
meeting here, Bush said he wanted to relay ``how upset I am that at
a time when we're all trying to build peace in Central America
through diplomatic means, the FMLN in El Salvador, aided and
abetted by Nicaragua and the Cuban government, has resorted to
senseless bloodshed and gross violations of all the agreements
reached to promote peace in Central America.''
   Bush made a pitch for the democracies that are members of the
OAS to pressure Nicaragua to stop aiding the FMLN.
   ``As democrats, we ought to be supporting the concept of
stopping these weapons going in there,'' he said.
   The rebels mounted their largest offensive of El Salvador's
10-year civil war Saturday night, with the death count so far at
466 people as residents were trapped by combat and government
aircraft struck at rebel positions.
   Despite government denials, rebels clearly held parts of
northern and eastern neighborhoods in San Salvador, and a rebel
communique said guerrillas had liberated parts of eight of the
country's 14 provinces.
   In his remarks to the OAS luncheon, Bush said he wanted to
assure the countries of the hemisphere that despite the ballyhoo
over reform moves in Eastern Europe and his upcoming summit meeting
with Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev, he doesn't want the Latin
nations ``to think that beacause we're paying a lot of attention to
the change that's taking place there, trying to figure out how we
can facilitate the change, that that means a lack of interest in
the Western Hemisphere.''
   ``I am delighted with the new moves toward democracy in Eastern
Europe,'' Bush said. ``Despite the excitement, we're not going to
neglect this hemisphere. We're building the world's first
democratic hemisphere.''

   The Navy, which is suspending activities for
48 hours over the next three days to review safety, has experienced
seven serious accidents in less than three weeks, the most recent
being a fire Tuesday that injured at least 29 people.
   The Navy said the ``safety stand-down'' order requires every
ship, squadron and shore training facility to interrupt normal
operations and review basic safety and operating procedures.
   The order came about six hours after fire broke out on the USS
Inchon, an amphibious assault ship undergoing maintenance at the
shipyard in Norfolk, Va., headquarters of the Atlantic Fleet.
   Lt. Cmdr. Steve Burnett, an Atlantic Fleet spokesman, said 20
sailors and nine civilians were injured and were taken to six
hospitals. At least one victim was listed in serious condition.
   Since the run of mishaps started Oct. 29, nine people have been
killed or lost at sea and at least 45 people have been injured.
   Between Jan. 1 and Nov. 1, the Navy counted 101 ``operation and
training related'' fatalities in the service, including 47 in the
explosion aboard the USS Iowa on April 19.
   The most serious of the recent accidents occurred Oct. 29 when a
jet pilot making his first landing on an aircraft carrier crashed
into the USS Lexington in the Gulf of Mexico. The pilot and four
others on deck the ship were killed.
   There has been some debate over the accidents. Earlier in the
month, Sen. John Warner, R-Va., ranking Republican on the Senate
Armed Services Committee, called the mishaps ``an extraordinary
grouping of unrelated accidents.''
   Others like Karlene Roberts, an industrial psychologist, warned
that cutting training budgets can lead to accidents. ``Congress is
always trying to cut training budgets ... It's a prescription for
disaster,'' she said.
   Other incidents include:
   _A Navy reserve pilot flying a A-7E jet crashed Nov. 9 into an
apartment complex in Smyrna, Ga., killing two civilians and
injuring two others, including himself.
   _Three sailors and a reported $4 million worth of non-nuclear
missiles were swept by a wave from the aircraft carrier USS
Eisenhower near Cape Hatteras, N.C. on Nov. 1. One sailor was
presumed dead.
   _Nine sailors were treated for burns or smoke inhalation when
fire erupted in the boiler aboard the USS Monongahela, some 500
miles west of Gibraltar on Nov. 1.
   _A F@A-18 pilot dropped a 500-pound bomb on the guided missile
cruiser USS Reeves in the Indian Ocean, causing minor injuries to
five sailors and blowing a five-foot hole in the ship's bow on Oct.
30.
   _A sailor aboard the aircraft carrier USS Carl Vinson fell into
the Pacific about 620 miles north of Wake Island Oct. 30 and was
presumed lost.

   Aspiring Actor Danny Kaufman always dreamed
of being recognized in public _ but not as one of ``America's Most
Wanted.''
   Kaufman was dining out at a Sherman Oaks restaurant where
employees thought they recognized him from the television series
about fugitive criminals.
   Only Kaufman wasn't the murder suspect they had seen _ he just
looked the part.
   But when the 25-year-old emerged from Stanley's restaurant, he
had an audience of 10 police officers, several with drawn guns.
   ``It wasn't the kind of attention I was seeking,'' Kaufman said
Monday. ``As soon as I stepped out the door my arms were grabbed
and pulled behind me. I was handcuffed in about a
second-and-a-half. I didn't know what was happening. I was scared.''
   Kaufman said it took four hours and a set of fingerprints to
convince police he wasn't 20-year-old Richard Church, who is wanted
for investigation of murder in Illinois.
   Fugitive squad Detective Douglas Le Melle said the police showed
up in force after the tip from the restaurant employees because
Church is considered dangerous and is believed to be in Southern
California.
   Le Melle said Church allegedly stabbed a former girlfriend, her
brother, mother and father in Woodstock, Ill., on Aug. 21, 1988.
The mother and father died from their wounds.
   ``He didn't come close to matching the prints, but on looks it
was close,'' Le Melle said of Kaufman.
   ``He came back and he had bruises around his wrists from the
cuffs,'' said one of the restaurant employees. ``I feel really bad
about it.''

<HEAD>Interim Appointment Expected to Replace Young</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Federal officials are considering an interim
appointment at the Food and Drug Administration while they search
for a permanent commissioner to replace Frank Young who has
resigned, sources said Tuesday.
   Unlike the current and previous FDA commissioners who were
appointed by the head of the Department of Health and Human
Services, the next commissioner will be a presidential appointment
and will require Senate confirmation.
   The change in procedure means it likely will to take longer to
put a permanent commissioner at the helm of the agency whose
responsibility is to assure the safety of drugs, cosmetics and most
food products.
   The pace of presidential appointments during the Bush
administration has been slow. At HHS, several key agencies still
have no permanent head, including the Health Care Financing
Administration, the Family Support Administration and the National
Institutes of Health.
   The FDA has been plagued recently by disclosures of bribery and
corruption in approval of generic drugs, and some lawmakers on
Capitol Hill have said Young's leaving may delay needed reforms at
the agency.
   Young will end more than five years as commissioner on Dec. 18
and become a deputy assistant secretary of health in charge of
science and environmental matters. Both jobs are in the Public
Health Service, which is part of HHS.
   Congress last year changed the law last year pertaining to the
appointment of an FDA commissioner to require Senate confirmation,
as is required of other top jobs in the administration.
   ``It's a very important job and touches so much of the consumer
safety questions. It's important that someone like that to have a
level of consideration that other appointments do,'' said a
congressional aide who worked on the measure but spoke on the
condition of anonymity.
   Sources in the department, who also spoke on the condition their
names not be used, said that because of the time it may take to
select a permanent commissioner and gain approval, officials are
considering an interim appointment.
   James S. Benson is currently the FDA's second in command as
acting deputy commissioner.
   Names being mentioned as early candidates for the permanent post
include Burton J. Lee, who is President Bush's personal physician,
and David Pinco, a Washington lawyer and former FDA official.

   President Bush declared his confidence Tuesday
that ``Europe will some day be whole and free,'' saluting a
decision by Czechoslovakia to ease travel restrictions as just one
more sign.
   Bush said he was not concerned about the dizzying pace of change
sweeping Eastern Europe. ``I don't think it's moving too fast and I
don't know of anybody in my administration that feels that it's
moving too fast.''
   The White House said the administration was reviewing
developments in Eastern Europe with an eye toward ``changing
relationships and new policies and programs.''
   ``There are large issues of East-West relations, of the
NATO-Warsaw Pact's future, of the status of the Soviet empire as
these countries change their relationship with the Soviet Union,''
White House press secretary Marlin Fitzwater said.
   ``All of those isues and questions are being considered by the
United States government at this time,'' Fitzwater said. ``I'm not
going to suggest any conclusions. ... We're just at the beginning
of that process.''
   The president left open the possibility he will stop in Brussels
to brief NATO allies after his shipboard summit in the
Mediterranean with Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev on Dec. 2
and 3.
   ``We're thinking right now how we might stay in touch with our
allies,'' Bush said.
   Bush made his remarks in response to the announcement that
Czechoslovakia, one of the last hard-line Soviet Bloc nations, no
longer will require its citizens to obtain exit visas to travel
outside their country. No date for the change was given in the
Czech announcement.
   ``Gorbachev talks about a common home,'' Bush said. ``We talk
about a Europe whole and free. And it's a most exciting time.''
   Bush spoke about Eastern Europe during several appearances
during the day. ``I am delighted with the new moves towards
democracy in Eastern Europe. We're all caught up in this,'' he told
foreign ministers from the Organization of American States.
   During a meeting with members of Congress, Bush also said he
will press Gorbachev next month to halt the shipment of East bloc
arms to the leftist government of Nicaragua.
   In preparation for the summit, Bush and his national security
adviser, Brent Scowcroft, had dinner Monday night with former
Secretary of State Henry A. Kissinger, who has expressed fears that
Gorbachev will try to enlist the United States ``as a partner with
him in the division of Germany.''
   Separately, Bush told reporters that his wife, Barbara, will not
accompany him to Malta.
   Bush is being pressured by Democrats to respond more strongly to
the changes sweeping Eastern Europe, dramatized last week by the
opening of the Berlin Wall and the promise of greater democracy in
East Germany.
   To comment on the announcement from Prague, Bush broke his own
rule against answering questions from reporters during photo-taking
sessions.
   On Capitol Hill, Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell,
D-Maine, said it was regrettable that Bush, through his spokesman,
had rejected the idea of going to Berlin to express American
satisfaction with the ``symbolic destruction'' of the wall or to
normalize trade relations with the Soviet Union.
   ``While the president has rejected all of these, he has reversed
himself on issues before and I hold out out hope he will do so
again,'' Mitchell said.
   On Monday, the majority leader had urged Bush to travel to the
Berlin Wall, convene a meeting of the Western allies and suspend
trade restrictions against the Soviet Union. The White House said
it was highly unlikely Bush would go to Berlin.
   White House officials said the low-keyed approach taken by Bush
was intended to lend support and encouragement to developments in
Eastern Europe while guarding against doing anything that might
provoke a crackdown or slow the pace of reforms.
   Bush, responding to questions during an Oval Office meeting with
Tunisian President Zine El Abidine Ben Ali, said he was pleased by
the easing of travel restrictions in Czechoslovakia, calling it ``a
very encouraging first step.''
   He said, ``Several months ago we called for a Europe whole and
free, and as I survey the changes taking place, it seems to be
moving towards a Europe whole and free.''
   Bush said, ``The people of Czechoslovakia have the same
aspirations for freedom that others have. And I would expect we'd
see further changes there, just as we have seen in Poland, Hungary
and in (East Germany).
   ``So it's a very good and encouraging step,'' he added. ``And
this is further manifestation that Europe some day will be whole
and free.''
   Meanwhile, the White House signaled its approval of a $738
million aid package for Poland and Hungary that is nearing approval
in the Senate.
   ``We're generally supportive,'' spokesman Fitzwater said. ``We'd
like to give billions if we had them.''
   Asked if the United States would like to see free elections in
East Germany, Fitzwater said, ``We would like to see the people's
rights and wills determined by themselves, and we think there is a
very constructive course of freedom under way in East Germany and
the other parts of Eastern Europe.''
   Fitzwater praised the lifting of travel restrictions in
Czechoslovakia and added, ``We're not surprised by anything
anymore.''

   West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl
concluded a historic visit to Poland Tuesday and told his hosts the
issue of German reunification concerns all of Europe and must be
approached with great sensitivity.
   Kohl spoke at a news conference after signing a joint
declaration with the Solidarity-led government. The declaration
opens the way to close economic cooperation and repeats previous
West German commitments to respect Poland's western border.
   Also Tuesday, Kohl paid a somber visit to the Auschwitz death
camp, where 4 million people were murdered by the Nazis during
World War II. Kohl was accompanied by Heinz Galinski, head of the
West German Jewish Community Council, and Rabbi Menachem Joskowicz
from Warsaw, Poland's only rabbi.
   Polish television broadcast part of the visit live to the somber
music of Chopin.
   Kohl laid a wreath at the wall of death, where prisoners of
different nationalities were shot, and another in Birkenau where
the crematoriums were located. He did not make a speech.
   It was the second site Kohl visited in connection with World War
II. On Sunday, he embraced Prime Minister Tadeusz Mazowiecki in a
sign of reonciliation at a Mass in the former German village of
Krzyzowa, where opponents to Hitler planned reisistance during the
war.
   The chancellor's five-day visit here was aimed at cementing
cooperation between the two countries but was dominated by the
rapid changes in East Germany.
   Kohl found the question of German reunification foremost in the
minds of his hosts when he returned to Warsaw Saturday after making
a brief stop in Bonn for an emergency Cabinet meeting.
   ``Both the Germans in East Germany and West Germany are not
alone,'' Kohl said at Tuesday's news conference. ``We Germans have
to act with a great dose of sensitivity as far as the situation in
all of Europe is concerned.''
   Kohl, the first West German leader to visit Poland since 1977,
said he and Mazowiecki discussed bilateral relations ``in the
historical context and in the context of obligations for the
future.''
   The statement said the two countries aim to ``heal the wounds of
the past through understanding and reconciliation.''
   In a meeting with members of Parliament Monday, Kohl said Poland
would benefit from a unified Germany.
   West Germany pledged in a 1970 treaty to respect the Oder and
Neisse rivers as Poland's western borders, but a reunified Germany
is not committed to those terms.
   The joint declaration signed Tuesday says West Germany will
continue to honor the 1970 treaty. Polish government spokeswoman
Malgorzata Niezabitowska said Poland was satisfied with the section
of the treaty on borders.
   Both Kohl and Mazowiecki said the joint declaration and 11
agreements signed earlier form the basis of a new chapter in
German-Polish relations.
   Of major importance to Poland are clauses in which West Germany
says it will strive to ensure that Poland's $39-billion debt is
rescheduled ``under a long-term arrangement on terms that take ...
account of the country's ability to pay.''
   A senior West German official, speaking on condition of
anonymity, said Bonn favored at least a five-year moratorium on
repayment of interest.
   The declaration calls for intensified economic cooperation
between the two countries. West Germany is Poland's largest western
trading partner.
   It also calls for an increase in exchanges between young people,
the establishment of German cultural institutions in Poland and the
expansion of German-language teaching.

   President Bush said Tuesday that he will press
in next month's meeting with Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev
for an end to the shipment of East Bloc arms to Central America.
   Bush made the comment at the outset of a meeting with the
observer team he named to monitor the February elections in
Nicaragua.
   At the same time, the State Department said it has called in
from retirement Harry Shlaudeman, a diplomat with long years of
experience on Central America, to give advice and monitor talks in
Washington between the Nicaraguan government and the Contra rebels.
   Bush was asked what the Soviet Union can do for peace in Central
America.
   ``What the Soviets can do is help facilitate free elections by
stopping to send arms into this hemisphere and support for the one
country that seems to be swimming against the tide,'' he said.
   This was a reference to the U.S. view that Soviet-manufactured
arms are abetting both the leftist government of Nicaragua and the
leftist rebels in El Salvador.
   ``I expect I'll have a chance at the Malta meeting'' with
Gorbachev ``to elaborate on that in a little bit more detail,''
Bush said.
   Separately, Bush told ministers of the Organization of American
States meeting here ``how upset I am that at a time when we're all
trying to build peace in Central America through diplomatic means,
the FMLN (guerrilla movement) in El Salvador, aided and abetted by
Nicaragua and the Cuban government, has resorted to senseless
bloodshed and gross violations of all the agreements reached to
promote peace in Central America.''
   Shlaudeman, 63, has agreed to work as a consultant to the
department on the Nicaragua talks but State Department spokeswoman
Margaret Tutwiler said he will not participate directly in the
discussions nor have substantive contact with Sandinista officials.
   Nonetheless, a senior official said Shlaudeman did have a
half-hour meeting in recent days with Sandinista diplomats at their
request. ``He was in a listening capacity,'' said the official,
asking not to be identified.
   Shlaudeman ended his 35-year diplomatic career last May after a
tour as ambassador to Brazil. He assumed his consultant's duties
last month.
   The talks between the Sandinistas and the Contras began at the
United Nations Thursday and were moved here Monday.
   Nicaraguan President Daniel Ortega called off a 19-month old
cease-fire with the rebels Nov. 1 and simultaneously proposed the
first direct discussions between the Sandinistas and the resistance
since June 1988.
   The main Sandinista objective is the demobilization of the
Contras, consistent with a communique issued by the Central
American presidents last August.
   The rebels, meanwhile, are stressing the need to restore the
cease-fire.
   Ms. Tutwiler said a new proposal was on the table at the talks
Tuesday with ``some common points of agreement.'' She had no
further details.
   Shlaudeman was the chief U.S. negotiator for bilateral
discussions between the United States and Nicaragua for an
eight-month period starting in June 1984.
   The Reagan administration broke off the talks, contending that
the Sandinista side was not negotiating in good faith. There have
been no substantive discussions between the two countries since
January 1985, and Ms. Tutwiler said that policy is unchanged.
   Shlaudeman's principal contact with the Nicaraguan government
during the 1984-85 period was Vice Foreign Minister Victor Hugo
Tinoco, who is leading the Sandinista delegation to the talks with
the Contras.
   Shlaudeman also was a special U.S. envoy to Central America,
making frequent trips to the region at the time when the
now-defunct Contadora peace process was under way.
   The Presidential Monitoring Commission will be chaired by Sen.
Richard Lugar, R-Ind., and Rep. Anthony C. Beilenson, D-Calif.,
White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said.
   The lawmakers will make numerous visits to Nicaragua over the
next 3{ months to monitor the election preparations and the
balloting itself, where opposition candidate Violeta de Chamorro is
seeking to unseat Ortega.
   Fitzwater said the lawmakers, in small groups, will make 15
trips to the Central American country between now and Feb. 25.
   Joining Lugar and Beilenson on the president's observer panel
are Sens. David Boren, D-Okla.; David Durenberger, R-Minn.; Nancy
Kassebaum, R-Kan.; Patrick Leahy, D-Vt.; Connie Mack, D-Fla.; John
McCain, R-Ariz.; Claiborne Pell, D-R.I.; Harry Reid, D-Nev., and
Terry Sanford, D-N.C.
   Representing the House are Reps. David Bonior, D-Mich.; William
Broomfield, R-Mich.; Rod Chandler, R-Wash.; Mickey Edwards,
R-Okla.; Henry Hyde, R-Ill.; Sonny Montgomery, D-Miss.; John
Murtha, D-Pa.; Jim Slattery, D-Kan., and Tom Tauke, R-Iowa.

   The AFL-CIO on Tuesday vowed an aggressive
campaign for passage of a national health care plan and Sen. Edward
M. Kennedy promised that Congress would adopt one next year.
   Delegates to the labor federation's convention endorsed a
resolution calling for an intensive lobbying campaign as well as
efforts to convince employers to join with unions in the effort.
   Labor in the past has endorsed Kennedy-sponsored proposals to
require private employers to provide private health insurance to
workers but a leader of the new campaign said the 14-million member
federation was entering the lobbying effort with an open mind.
   ``We are most interested in forging a consensus that we must as
a nation find a solution that ensures universal access to quality
care at a price we can afford,'' said John Sweeney, president of
the Service Employees International Union.
   Sweeney said the campaign, to be formally announced Wednesday,
would include meetings ``of hundreds of rank and file'' with
members of Congress in their home districts.
   He said rising health care costs have limited worker pay
increases because rising premiums have squeezed company profits and
also because employer efforts to shift insurance costs to workers
have dominated contract talks.
   To demonstrate its commitment to the campaign, several
presidents of the federation's largest unions spoke in favor of the
plan.
   ``Let us leave this convention commited to mobilizing the
roughly 90 percent of American citizens who are unhappy with our
current system,'' said United Auto Workers President Owen Bieber.
``This is an issue whose time has come and an issue on which the
labor movement must provide leadership.''
   Jack Barry, president of the International Brotherhood of
Electrical Workers, said the rising costs were due to the
``insatiable greed'' of health care providers.
   The resolution calling for the health-care campaign was passed
on an afternoon dedicated the family-related issues and speeches
from two of labor staunchest allies in Congress, Kennedy and Sen.
Barbara Mikulski, D-Md. Earlier in the day the convention heard an
emotional speech from Solidarity leader Lech Walesa, who thanked
American unions for their support of the Polish trade union he
leads.
   Also endorsed were pending congressional bills to increase
federal funds for day care and to require parental leave to care
for newborn and ill children.
   Kennedy, D-Mass., told the 800 delegates Congress would endorse
a national health care plan in 1990.
   ``The Ameican people understand the need,'' Kennedy said.
``Politicians are stating to understand. Progressive businesses are
beginning to understand. And by the time you finish the national
health care campaign you ared launching at this convention,
President George Bush will catch on too, and have no choice but to
sign this bill we intend to sent to him in 1990.''

   Outlawed flags lined the
streets of Bir Zeit and Palestinians throughout the occupied lands
planned marches and fireworks Wednesday to mark the PLO declaration
of independence one year ago.
   Activists in Bir Zeit said they would observe the anniversary by
reading the Palestinian independence proclamation over a mosque
loudspeaker and marching military-style under the Palestinian
flags, which Israel has outlawed.
   The army closed schools in the Gaza Strip, arrested alleged
agitators in West Bank raids and called in reinforcements to help
quell anticipated riots.
   Soldiers sealed off the Gaza Strip, searching for Palestinian
gunmen who killed an Israeli soldier Monday evening and wounded
another. The Moslem fundamentalist group Hamas, or Zeal, claimed
responsibility for the attack.
   Late Tuesday, a Palestinian was shot by soldiers and later died
from a chest wound at Ramallah Hospital in the West Bank, doctors
said. The body was snatched from the hospital, apparently by
relatives, they said.
   Israel radio identified the Palestinian as Odah Hussein Ziyad,
18, from the Kalandia refugee camp five miles north of Jerusalem.
The army confirmed the death but said it was checking to see if
soldiers were involved.
   Also in the West Bank, Manweh Bakry, 45, of Nablus, died of
chest wounds suffered in a Sept. 14 clash with troops. The deaths
raised to 615 the number of Palestinians killed by soldiers or
civilians in the 23-month-old uprising against Israeli occupation.
Forty-one Israelis have also died in the violence.
   At least 16 Palestinians were wounded in stone-throwing clashes
with Israeli troops throughout the West Bank and Gaza Strip
Tuesday, Arab sources said.
   Defense Minister Yitzhak Rabin said the attack on the soldiers
could signal plans to increase the use of guns and explosives. The
Palestine Liberation Organization has urged its followers
repeatedly not to use firearms, recommending non-violent protest
and civil disobedience instead.
   Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir began a visit to the United
States, where he will meet with President Bush on proposals for
peace talks with Palestinians.
   Palestinian flags of black, white, green and red hung from
telephone poles and power lines throughout the West Bank and Gaza,
which Israel captured from Jordan and Egypt in the 1967 Middle East
War. Pictures of PLO chairman Yasser Arafat were pasted on
buildings.
   Children in Gaza City handed out flowers and balloons in the
flag colors. Arab motorists honked their horns and flicked on
lights as they drove down Omar Al Mukhtar Street, the main
throroughfare, witnesses reported.
   Firework rockets streaked across the sky in the early evening,
leaving red and blue trails.
   Rabin warned Palestinians against taking part in the
festivities, declaring on army radio: ``Be it the unfurling of a
flag, or the throwing of a stone or illegal gatherings, all steps
will be taken against these things.''
   In Bir Zeit, a town of 3,000 people, flags and pictures adorned
lamp posts, telephone poles and even the top of a cross on the
Roman Catholic Church, Our Lady of Guadeloupe.
   Yusef, a 26-year-old activist who would not give his last name,
said women's committes planned to dance the ``dabka,'' a
traditional Palestinian folk dance, in the streets on the
anniversary of the independence declaration Nov. 15, 1988, at a
meeting of the Palestinian Nationl Council in Algiers.
   Students from Bir Zeit University, which the army closed early
in the uprising, posted an invitation in a coffee shop to a
``Photography exhibit on the Palestinian state.''
   ``Despite the pain of so many dead and wounded, this is a moment
of joy,'' said Mahdi Abdel Hadi, a Palestinian leader in Jerusalem.
``It shows that we can change and lead our own history.''
   ``How can I celebrate with so many people killed and wounded?''
said a gasoline station attendant, who would not give his name.
``People will try to celebrate, but I think the army will suppress
them.''
   In the West Bank security sweep, soldiers detained 58
Palestinians suspected of uprising activities, Arab reporters said.
   On Monday evening, Palestinians fired 28 shots at an Israeli
patrol jeep, killing Cpl. Sarul Trechtenboit, 42, and critically
wounding another soldier, an army spokesman reported.
   Trechtenboit, who leaves four children, was the first soldier
killed in Gaza since the uprising began Dec. 8, 1987. Eight
soldiers are among the 41 Israeli victims of the violence.
   Israel radio said an anonymous caller claimed responsibility for
the attack in the name of Hamas, which opposes the PLO policy of
seeking a negotiated settlement with Israel. Hamas also has been
blamed for the kidnap-murder of two soldiers who disappeared while
hitchhiking earlier this year.

   Anthony Moseley sees a world of
possibility in french fries. They can curve sideways or spiral
upward, taste like a potato or have the bite of sharp cheddar.
   In fact, the future of french fries is so bright they'll be
coming every sort of way _ except with shades, says Moseley,
marketing director for the nation's largest potato processor.
   ``Customers will still buy the normal straight potatoes, but
they've gotten a little bored with them,'' Moseley said in an
interview at the headquarters of Lamb-Weston, Inc.
   ``I think that's why seasoning comes into play,'' he said.
``People are going to more unique cuts and more flavored potato
products.''
   Lamb-Weston, which supplies 30 percent of the nation's frozen
potatoes, offers frozen tempura fries in curly or criss-cross
shapes, potato skins, cheddar fries, spicy fries, oval potato
slices and tiny baked potatoes.
   ``That's where the business is up,'' Moseley said.
   Examples include the restaurant chain Arby's, which is selling a
Lamb-Weston seasoned curly fry, he said.
   Hardee's and Rax restaurants also offer potato options, and
McDonald's is investigating an alternative potato, he said.
   Fast-food chains also are demanding low-cholesterol frying oils,
such as canola oil, to keep health-conscious customers happy,
Moseley said.
   Competition from baked potatoes, potato chips and other spud
products are threatening the market share of the venerable french
fry in restaurants and grocery stores, industry officials say.
   ``The demand for fries is not declining but holding steady,''
said Nancy McCarthy of The Potato Board in Denver. ``But chips are
going up, an average of 5 percent increase a year.''
   The nation consumes about 5.5 billion pounds of frozen potatoes
a year, and Ms. McCarthy said annual per capita consumption of
potatoes is rising, from 115 pounds in 1980 to 123 pounds in 1987.
   The biggest change is that frozen potatoes are capturing more
and more of the market as consumers become strapped for time. That
benefits Northwest growers who send the bulk of their crop to
processors.
   Consumers on average ate 74.6 pounds of processed potatoes and
47 pounds of fresh potatoes in 1987, Ms. McCarthy said. That
compared to 1980, when consumers ate 64 pounds of processed spuds
and 51 pounds of fresh, she said.
   ``It's a lot easier to pick up frozen french fries than to make
your own,'' she said. ``I don't think we're raising a generation
that can cook.''

   A Soviet official appealed on Tuesday for more
U.S. imports from the Soviet Union and U.S. support for Soviet
participation in the organization that makes rules for world trade.
   ``When we send you our equipment, and you compare it with the
same equipment from some other countries, the duties are two, five
or 10 times more,'' said Igor Khotsialov of the Soviet government's
Foreign Economic Commission.
   He said the Soviet Union is interested in selling machinery to
the United States, pointing out that it sells machine tools and
other equipment to Britain.
   U.S. duties on Soviet goods are high because the Jackson-Vanik
amendment to the Trade Act of 1974 denies lower rates to countries
that limit emigration.
   President Bush could grant the lower rates, waiving the
amendment and applying a familiar trade rule that would give the
Soviets all the privileges of the ``most favored nation.'' He has
said he first wants to see the Soviets enact a law that would
confirm recent liberal Soviet policies on emigration. Any new
arrangements would also need approval from Congress.
   The Supreme Soviet is expected to pass an emigration law soon.
   Khotsialov said the Soviets need advice from American officials
and business people on how to work with the General Agreement on
Tariffs and Trade (GATT) and the organization that administers it.
The GATT organization, with headquarters in Geneva, Switzerland, is
sponsoring negotiations among more than 100 countries to set up new
rules on trade, including for the first time trade in services and
a reduction in the subsidies on farm trade that cost taxpayers
billions of dollars every year.
   ``We are eager to be in GATT,'' Khotsialov said.
   ``That requires some some conditions on our side too, but in
this case we need your support ... If you want us in the GATT, I
think we will be in the GATT.''
   Khotsialov spoke on the eve of two days of talks between a
Soviet mission headed by Foreign Economics Minister Konstantin
Katushev and Commerce Secretary Robert Mosbacher. He addressed the
East-West Forum, a private group that seeks to promote trade.
   On Tuesday, Katushev met with Jack Parnell, deputy secretary of
Agriculture. The bulk of U.S. trade with the Soviet Union consists
in Soviet imports of U.S. wheat, maize and soybeans.
   Marion Blakey, Mosbacher's spokeswoman, said the two days of
meetings will cover trade and investment questions, including the
reduction of U.S. tariffs on Soviet goods.

   The first big snow storm of the season slid onto the northern
Plains and upper Mississippi Valley on Tuesday with much colder
air, while unseasonably warm temperatures hit record highs over the
eastern and south-central states.
   A winter storm watch was posted into Wednesday for east-central
and southeastern Minnesota.
   From late Monday into early Tuesday, a minor weather disturbance
brought a light dusting of snow to much of northwestern Wisconsin
and northern and central Minnesota, with 2 inches reported at
Carlton, Minn., the National Weather Service reported.
   By Tuesday afternoon, snow was falling across most of Minnesota
and over parts of North Dakota, with up to 3 inches reported in
southern North Dakota.
   A large, cold air mass in southern Canada was expected to spill
into the north-central states during the night and spread much
colder temperatures across much of the nation east of the Rockies
over the next several days.
   A winter storm watch was posted for Wednesday over parts of
western and central Upper Michigan, primarily near Lake Superior,
with more than 8 inches of snow expected in some areas.
   Farther west, heavy snow blanketed parts of northern Wyoming
during the night and Cody had more than 10 inches of snow Tuesday.
Wind in southeastern Wyoming gusted to 55 mph near Cheyenne during
the morning.
   Elsewhere, showers and thunderstorms were scattered from the
central Gulf Coast into southern sections of the Great Lakes
region, with some locally heavy rain.
   Early morning showers and thunderstorms produced 2.5 inches of
rain at Anniston, Ala., in six hours. During the six hours up to 1
p.m. EST, 1.65 of rain fell at Fort Leonard Wood, Mo., with 1.13
inches at Jackson, Tenn.
   An early morning thunderstorm in eastern Missouri produced high
wind which downed several trees and unroofed the deck of home at
Farmington, the weather service said.
   Showers were scattered over northern New England and along the
Carolina coast.
   Unseasonably warm temperatures continued over the south-central
and eastern states, with readings generally above 70 from the
southern Plains to the Atlantic Coast, with 80s in south-central
and eastern Texas and the Florida Peninsula.
   In Texas, the temperature at Dallas was up to 87 by early
afternoon, Waco had already hit 90 and Corpus Christi reported a
record high of 91.
   Nine other cities also reported record high or record-tying
temperatures:
   Alamosa, Colo., 62; Atlantic City, N.J., 75; Cape Hatteras,
N.C., 78; Concord, N.H., 68; San Angelo, Texas, 86; Scranton, Pa.,
70, tie; Syracuse, N.Y.; 71; Worcester, Mass., 68, tie; and

   The House on Tuesday approved a foreign aid
bill that offers up to $85 million for El Salvador's besieged
military, but also contains so many competing demands for cash that
the full amount may not be available.
   The compromise bill, which came up just a day before Polish
labor leader Lech Walesa was to address a joint meeting of
Congress, also contained the first hard cash to back up a promised
three-year U.S. aid program for Poland and Hungary. The vote on the
overall measure was 324 to 93.
   One contentious issue in the $14.6 billion bill was defused when
the House voted to give President Bush the right to withhold $15
million for the United Nations Population Fund if he finds the
agency supports forced abortions or sterilizations in China.
   But a veto threat against the bill remained over a prohibition
on the use of foreign aid money to persuade other countries to
carry out policies prohibited by U.S. law.
   For El Salvador, whose government is battling a fierce onslaught
by leftist rebels of the Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front,
the bill would provide up to $85 million in military aid $12
million for police training and equipment.
   Because lawmakers larded the bill with dozens of provisions
requiring that certain amounts go to various other countries and
programs, it is unlikely there will be enough military aid money
left to give the rightist government of Alfredo Cristiani its full
aid complement.
   For Eastern Europe, the bill included $293 million to fund the
first year of the three-year program to encourage political and
economic reform in Poland and Hungary, along with $240 million in
stand-by credit and trade insurance _ a total of $533 million.
   Major elements of the appropriations measure included a $200
million grant to help stabilize Poland's battered economy and $45
million for a private enterprise development fund. Other money
would go for environmental cleanup, agriculture and educational and
cultural exchanges.
   Bush had threatened a veto on issues growing out of two highly
political controversies: abortion and the Reagan administration's
conduct during the Iran-Contra affair.
   The bill had provided $15 million to support the U.N. Population
Fund, reversing a five-year ban on U.S. aid to that agency. The aid
was included in the Senate by Sen. Barbara Mikulski, D-Md., who
argued that it was time to resume help for the U.N.'s family
planning efforts.
   ``What we're talking about here is the lives of women,'' said
Rep. Jan Meyers, R-Kan., noting that the average number of births
per woman in Sub-Saharan Africa is 6.5, and that pregnancy causes
one in four deaths there among women aged 15 to 49.
   But opponents noted that the agency operates programs in China,
which has a one-child-per-family policy that allegedly has led to
forced abortions and sterilizations. Anti-abortion forces sought to
kill the provision, despite a stipulation in the bill that the U.S.
money not be used in China.
   Rep. Christopher Smith, R-N.J., couched the issue as one of
coercive against voluntary family planning, andnoted that any money
to the U.N. agency would free funds to be used in China.
   In a pair of apparently contradictory votes, opponents first
failed on a vote of 244-178 to delete the money from the bill, then
prevailed 219 to 203 when they sought to place conditions on the
family planning aid.
   The motion which passed would let Bush withhold the funding if
he determines that the U.N. agency supports any program of coerced
abortion or sterilization, and Smith said that would remove a Bush
veto threat on the issue.
   The remaining provision tempting a veto was a ban on the use of
foreign aid money to ``leverage'' other countries that receive it
into carrying out U.S. policies that are contrary to the law.
Documents released at the trial of Iran-Contra figure Oliver North
showed the United States had expedited aid to Honduras as a reward
for its harboring of the Contra rebels fighting Nicaragua's leftist
government.
   Overall, the measure included $4.7 billion in military aid and
$3.2 billion in economic aid.
   Among major earmarks for countries in the bill were $3 billion
for Israel and $2.1 billion for Egypt, always the largest aid
recipients because of their participation in the Camp David Middle
East peace process.
   Other large recipients included Pakistan, with $460 million in
military and economic aid; Turkey, $500 million in military aid;
Greece, $350 million in military aid; $63 million in military and
economic aid for Morocco; and $125 million in military aid to help
the countries of Colombia, Peru and Bolivia fight the war on drugs.
   In addition, the agreement provides $160 million for the U.S.
contribution to the Multilateral Assistance Initiative for the
Philippines, $83 million for Afghanistan relief, $83 million for
Jordan and $30 million in military aid to countries in Sub-Saharan
Africa.

<HEAD>Support for Capital Gains Cut Short of Margin Needed to End Talkathon</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JIM LUTHER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Tax Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A majority of the Senate supported a
capital-gains tax cut on a procedural vote Tuesday but the number
fell short of the 60 needed to halt a Democratic filibuster against
the reduction.
   The vote on limiting debate on the cut, which President Bush
proposed, was 51-47. Republicans will get another try to limit
debate Wednesday. If that fails, the issue will be put to rest for
the year.
   Leaders of both parties have said no reduction is likely this
year. Tuesday's debate was set up to give backers of a
capital-gains cut the chance to show their strength.
   ``This is a situation where everyone gains,'' said Sen. Bob
Packwood, R-Ore., contending that a tax cut would benefit investors
while producing increased revenue for the government to spend on
social programs. ``You don't get many deals better than that.''
   Majority Leader George J. Mitchell, D-Maine, who has led
opposition to a capital-gains cut, said that in the long term, the
proposal would worsen the budget deficit by tens of billions of
dollars. ``This amendment symbolizes the excesses of the last
decade, especially the unprecedented irresponsibiity in federal
fiscal policy.
   ``This is budget fraud that is astonishing in its audacity and
irresponsiblity,'' Mitchell said. ``This amendment is designed to
do one thing ... only: Give President Bush a political victory no
matter what the long-term cost to the American people.''
   Bush campaigned last year on a pledge to cut taxes on capital
gains, which are profits from the sale of investments. He said a
cut would spur investment and job creation.
   Democrats generally are opposed, arguing that 80 percent of the
benefit of a reduction would go to those with incomes of more than
$100,000 a year.
   The proposed reduction has been the dominant point of contention
between Congress and the president this year. The House, with
significant Democratic support, approved a capital-gains cut in
September.
   Before 1986, only 40 percent of capital gains from property
owned more than one year was taxable. Since that time, capital
gains have been fully taxable at the same rates applied to other
income.
   Packwood's amendment also included a provision, written by Sen.
Bill Roth, R-Del., to create a new type of Individual Retirement
Account that, at least for a few years, would help pay for the
capital-gains cut.
   Under the Republican amendment, the longer an asset was held,
the less of the profit from its sale would be taxed.
   Thus, only 95 percent of the profit from the sale of an asset
owned more than one year would be taxed. That percentage would
increase by five points for each additional year up to seven; only
65 percent of the gain would be taxed when property owned more than
seven years is sold.
   The GOP plan for expanding IRAs would use a different approach
than was used by more than 15 million when deductible IRAs were
open to all workers. The old-style IRA, which now is restricted to
lower-income workers and those not covered by a company pension,
permits a tax deduction for the maximum $2,000-a-year contribution.
   The Packwood-Roth amendment would permit workers to set aside up
to $2,000 a year but receive no tax deduction. Instead, interest on
the account would never be taxed. In addition, penalty-free
withdrawals could be made from the IRA to pay medical or education
expenses or for retirement.
   Workers would be permitted to to convert their current
tax-deductible IRAs into the new accounts by paying tax on
contributions that had been deducted in the past. Packwood and Roth
cited estimates that these ``rollovers'' would produce enough
revenue for the government to pay for the cut in capital-gains
taxes.
   The capital-gains cut passed by the House contained no changes
in IRAs. Until 1992, it would exclude 30 percent of gains from
taxation. After that, only the portion of gains attributable to
inflation would be excluded.

Senate Tuesday refused to limit debate on a proposal to cut the
capital gains tax, falling nine votes short of the 60 required.
   On this vote, a yes vote was a vote to limit debate _ and thus
was a vote in favor of the tax reduction _ while a no vote was a
vote to allow debate to continue. Under the procedural motion, 60
yes votes would have been required to limit the debate.
   Voting yes were 6 Democrats and 45 Republicans.

   Kitty Dukakis was transferred Tuesday to a center
at New England Deaconess Hospital that treats mood disorders, a
week after she was hospitalized because she drank rubbing alcohol.
   A recovering alcoholic with a history of depression, the
52-year-old wife of Gov. Michael Dukakis was transferred from
Brigham and Women's Hospital to the Deaconess affective disorders
unit for evaluation, the governor's office said.
   Affective disorder is a psychiatric term referring to such
problems as mood swings and depression. Mrs. Dukakis' doctor has
said she suffers from depression.
   Mindy Lubber, a spokeswoman for the governor, said it wasn't
known how long Mrs. Dukakis would remain at Deaconess.
   Asked if Mrs. Dukakis was being treated for a combination of
depression and alcoholism, Ms. Lubber said: ``those are some of the
issues relating to her treatment that Mrs. Dukakis is only
discussing with her family and her doctors.''
   Janna Crittendon, a spokeswoman for the Deaconess, said Tuesday
that Mrs. Dukakis' condition was ``satisfactory.''
   The affective disorders unit is a 27-bed section run by Harvard
Medical School faculty, Ms. Crittendon said. It offers diagnosis
and treatment of patients, she said. The average length of stay is
16 days.
   Symptoms of mood disorder include disturbed sleep and disrupted
appetite and can leave the sufferer unable to concentrate on daily
activities, Ms. Crittendon said.
   Such disorders can be associated with substance abuse, Ms.
Crittendon said, adding that she was speaking generally and not
about Mrs. Dukakis' case.
   Deaconess specializes in treating the more complex and chronic
diseases, Ms. Crittendon said. It is known in particular for
research and treatment of heart ailments, cancer and AIDS and as a
venue for organ transplants, she said.
   Mrs. Dukakis was admitted to Brigham and Women's on Nov. 6 after
drinking a small amount of rubbing alcohol.
   The governor said Monday his wife had ``a slip,'' or a relapse
back into drinking when she swallowed the rubbing alcohol. Mrs.
Dukakis was treated for alcoholism last March.
   Mrs. Dukakis had earlier admitted to a long-term dependency on
diet pills, for which she also has received treatment.
   Also on Tuesday, Mrs. Dukakis' attorney on her book project,
Robert Barnett, said the memoir was about 95 percent completed and
needs a couple weeks more work.
   Publisher Simon &amp; Schuster still plans to release the book next
summer, he said.
   When Mrs. Dukakis is feeling able, she will finish the book with
her collaborator, Jane Scovell, Barnett said from Washington. He
would not discuss whether new material on her latest
hospitalization would be included.

<TEXT>
   A multi-racial jury was sworn in Tuesday to hear
the manslaughter case against a Miami police officer accused of
shooting a black motorcyclist, sparking three days of rioting in
January.
   Dade Circuit Judge Joseph Farina dismissed last-minute defense
appeals to move the trial from this racially divided city, and
scheduled opening arguments for Wednesday.
   ``This case, your honor, has been surrounded by violence since
the beginning,'' defense attorney Roy Black argued in seeking a
change of venue.
   Prosecutor Richard Shiffrin countered by saying three weeks of
intensive questioning had produced an impartial panel that would
not be influenced by fears that their verdict could spark renewed
rioting.
   The jury of two blacks, one Hispanic and three non-Hispanic
whites will decide the case against William Lozano, who fatally
shot Clement Lloyd, 23. Lloyd's passenger, Allan Blanchard, 24,
died of injuries suffered when the motorcycle crashed.
   The jury will be sequestered during the trial, which could last
up to six weeks.
   Fears that an acquittal could set off new rioting were somewhat
calmed by the presence of two blacks on the jury, said William
Sims, a member of the Dade County Community Relations Board.
   ``It's not so tense, people are just aware, watching,'' Sims
said. ``The fact that the jury resembles the tri-ethnic balance of
this community goes a long way in reducing that level of tensions.''
   The judge also brushed aside new defense attempts to unseat
black juror Ezra Simmons. A state appeals court ruled Monday that
Farina rightfully seated the black union leader after finding the
defense had challenged him solely on the basis of race.
   Black introduced new testimony from a private detective Tuesday
attempting to show Simmons was unreliable in employment hearings,
but the judge again refused to exclude the juror.
   Following Tuesday's hearing, Black complained that the judge's
rulings in the case have ``already excluded 75 percent of our
defense.''
   In earlier pre-trial motions, Farina denied defense efforts to
introduce Lloyd's drug connections and police record.
   Farina also ruled that the prosecution can use testimony about
Miami city police regulations in an attempt to show Lozano acted
negligently and unprofessionally when he shot and killed Lloyd.
   The defense, however, may bring up 5.5 grams of marijuana found
on Lloyd's body, as well as $1,500 cash he had in his pocket. They
may also tell jurors that Lloyd had alcohol and high level of THC,
marijauana's active ingredient, in his bloodstream. The judge
barred such testimony about passenger Blanchard.
   Lozano faces two manslaughter counts for the deaths of Lloyd and
Blanchard. In the subsequent racial violence, one person was
killed, 11 were wounded by gunfire and 13 buildings were burned
down.
   If convicted on both counts, he would face a maximum penalty of
60 years imprisonment.
   Lozano fired one shot, hitting Lloyd in the head and killing
him, as the motorcyclist sped away from another officer.
   The defense argues Lozano acted in self-defense against a
drug-crazed dealer who did not want to be sent back to jail, and
was willing to run the officer over to escape.

   The Senate on Tuesday overwhelmingly approved
a three-year $738 million aid package to reinforce efforts by
Poland and Hungary to discard communism and build democracy and
free enterprise.
   The vote was 99-0.
   The Senate action came on the eve of an address to a joint
meeting of Congress by Lech Walesa, leader of Poland's Solidarity
labor union, who is seeking a massive infusion of Western aid to
energize his country's battered economy and shore up its flegling
democracy.
   ``Lech Walesa, this is for you and a free Poland,'' said Sen.
Paul Simon, D-Ill., immediately after the Senate acted.
   ``This bill gives Solidarity a fighting chance to succeed,''
said Simon who was the bill's principal Democratic sponsor.
   ``Polish democracy deserves our firm support,'' Simon said. ``To
this point, our words have generally outstripped our deeds. This
will help change that.
   ``It almost sounds trite to say that what is happening in
Eastern Europe is mind-boggling, but thank God for it,'' said Sen.
Gordon Humphrey, R-N.H., as the Senate's work on the bill neared
completion.
   ``We must do all we can afford, as quickly as we can, to help
make these changes in Eastern Europe irreversible,'' Humphrey said.
   The Senate bill represents a bipartisan compromise over the
scale of the aid plan, an issue that has been contentious from the
start.
   Senate Democrats originally had sought a three-year
authorization level for the two East European nations of $989
million, while Republicans campaigned for a $585 million ceiling.
   All the proposals, including the $840 million authorized earlier
by the House, overshadow the total $455 million proposed in
increments over the last several months by President Bush.
   Asked if Bush favors $738 million in aid for the two countries,
White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said: ``We're generally
supportive. We'd like to get billions, if we had them.''
   The House, meanwhile, provided the first hard cash to back up
the aid made possible by the Senate authorization bill. Lawmakers
passed a foreign aid appropriations measure for the 1990 fiscal
year that included $293 million for the first year of the
three-year aid program, along with another $240 million in stand-by
credit and trade insurance.
   Major elements of the appropriations measure included a $200
million grant to help stabilize Poland's battered economy and $45
million for a private enterprise development fund. Other money
would go for environmental cleanup, agriculture and educational and
cultural exchanges.
   However, the money bill, the product of a House-Senate
conference, remained the subject of a veto threat over unrelated
provisions which the Bush administration opposes.
   The Senate authorization bill builds on key elements originally
advocated by the Bush, including Enterprise Funds to help both
nations move away from communist centralized economies toward
free-market systems.
   The Enterprise Funds, intended to help both countries establish
free-market systems, would allocate $260 million for Poland and $65
million for Hungary.
   In recognition of Poland's serious economic problems, the bill
allocates $657 million for that country over three years. Hungary
would receive $81 million.
   The Senate compromise plan drops a $200 million credit
stabilization plan for Poland which Republicans said would only
increase Poland's large foreign debt.
   The only senator not voting for the aid plan was Spark
Matsunaga, D-Hawaii, who is ill.

<HEAD>European Community Summit Called to Consider Soviet-bloc Changes</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JEFFREY ULBRICH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Leaders of the 12-nation European Community will
meet Saturday in the Elysee Palace to analyze the surge of changes
in the Soviet bloc and how they can influence Europe's future
instead of the superpowers.
   President Francois Mitterrand, in a surprise move Monday,
invited the other European Community (EC) members to a special
summit.
   There had been calls for such a meeting to be held before the
summit of Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev and President Bush
set for Dec. 2-3 aboard ships off Malta.
   The EC, also known as the European Common Market, had scheduled
a summit conference for Dec. 8-9 in Strasbourg, France, but the
flood of events in Eastern Europe prompted Mitterrand to call the
special meeting in advance of the U.S.-Soviet and EC summits.
   Former French Foreign Minister Michel Jobert said in a radio
interview, ``Do we want the United States and the Soviet Union,
once again, to decide the destiny of Europe?''
   And former President Valery Giscard d'Estaing, the leader of
France's main centrist political coalition, had urged Mitterrand's
socialist government to call an emergency EC summit.
   In a radio interview Sunday, Giscard d'Estaing said it would be
``unacceptable that the first analysis of the events in Europe be
made by the Americans and the Soviets and not by the Europeans.''
   Mitterrand called Saturday's meeting as EC president. He is
president of the organization under a six-month rotating system and
his term ends with the Strasbourg summit.
   There were indications that most other EC leaders welcomed the
Elysee Palace summit.
   British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, in a speech Monday
night, did not refer to Mitterrand's invitation but said, ``The
Community should see what is happening as a great turning point in
Europe's history, and its response must measure up to that.''
   Hans-Dietrich Genscher, the West German foreign minister, said
it is important that ``the European Community gets together on such
a dramatic development. Besides analyzing the situation, one must
also examine what the EC can do to help the people and to ensure
that the reform process develops in a stable manner.''
   In his invitations Mitterrand said the summit was called ``to
discuss the recent developments in the situation in Europe.''
   It is rare for EC leaders to meet at the top level outside the
framework of their semiannual summits and even more unusual that
such a meeting could be organized so quickly.
   Analysts said the Elysee Palace dinner-summit could serve two
major purposes: It gives the Europeans a chance to organize their
position before the U.S.-Soviet conference and keeps the agenda of
the Strasbourg summit open for Mitterrand's two pet projects _
European monetary union and a European social charter.
   West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl had asked Mitterrand to make
the German question the central theme of the Strasbourg meeting.
That probably would have served Mrs. Thatcher and some West German
officials who are not enthusiastic about a monetary union and
social charter.

   Miroslav Kusy, a leading Czechoslovak
human rights activist, was convicted Tuesday of ``harming state
interests abroad'' and given a suspended jail sentence of eight
months, an emigre source reported.
   The source, speaking privately, said the court in Bratislava
acquitted Hana Ponicka, Anton Selecky and Vladimir Manak, who were
charged with sedition last summer together with Jan Carnogursky,
another activist.
   All five had signed a statement urging Slovaks to mark the 21st
anniversary of the Soviet-led invasion of August 1968, which
crushed the brief ``Prague spring'' of reform, by laying flowers in
memory of the victims.
   About 100 supporters, who could not get into the court building
in Bratislava for the two-day trial, shouted ``Long live freedom!''
and ``Long live Dubcek!'' after the verdicts were announced.
   Alexander Dubcek, the Communist Party chief who led the 1968
reform and was disgraced afterward, attended the trial.
   The court changed original charges of sedition and subversion
against Kusy to ``harming state interests abroad'' under Article
112 of the criminal code, which appeared to be a lesser charge, the
source in Vienna said. The maximum prison term for sedition is five
years.
   Kusy, a party Central Committee secretary in 1968, was expelled
from the party after the invasion.
   Carnogursky, a Roman Catholic activist who has been held since
Aug. 14, faces charges of sedition and subversion, but his trial
was suspended because his lawyer is ill.
   He was brought to the courtroom in handcuffs Tuesday and asked
to testify as a witness, but refused, said Palach Press, a
newsletter based in London that monitors human rights in
Czechoslovakia. It said Carnogursky would be tried next Monday and
Tuesday.
   Last week, about 200 people demonstrated in Bratislava for his
release.

   The friendly weekend invasion from the East when
the Berlin Wall was opened cost the West German government $82
million in ``welcome money,'' the city's bankers said Tuesday.
   The West Berlin bank association said 1.5 million visitors from
East Germany came through the wall and banks gave each 100 marks
($55) on the government's behalf, for a total of 150 million marks,
or about $82 million.
   Figures were not available from the other parts of West Germany
visited by 1.5 million more East Germans, but the total paid in
``welcome money'' probably was double the West Berlin figure.
   By government policy, each East German visitor is entitled to
100 marks once a year. East Germans traveling abroad can take along
only 15 West German marks, equivalent to a little more than $8, and
East German marks are not covertible.
   Earlier Tuesday, West Berlin banks threatened to suspend
payments of ``welcome money'' unless Bonn covered their operating
costs, and the government agreed. The banks stayed open most of the
weekend to handle long lines of East Germans.
   Officials said the government was raising its total ``welcome
money'' allocation from 479 million marks to 779 million.

   The black nationalist movement that
fought South African rule for 23 years won a solid majority Tuesday
in national elections but will have to bargain with rival parties
in drafting a new constitution.
   The leftist South-West Africa People's Organization won 384,567
votes, or 57 percent of 670,830 ballots cast, according to results
announced Tuesday.
   SWAPO's leaders had predicted their movement would easily win
the two-thirds majority that would have enabled it to
single-handedly write the constitution.
   The Democratic Turnhalle Alliance, a multiracial coalition that
favors a capitalist economy, finished second with 191,532 votes, or
29 percent.
   Thousands of SWAPO supporters filled the streets of Windhoek,
the capital, waving flags, singing and honking horns throughout the
day. The celebration carried on into the night in Katutura, the
main black neighborhood on the edge of Windhoek.
   In the northern town of Oshakati, more than 20 people were hurt
in a clash between SWAPO and alliance supporters, a doctor said. At
least two were seriously injured, one with a bullet wound, another
with a stab wound, said Dr. Kalumbi Shangula of the Oshakati
Hospital.
   ``We struggled all the years for this day,'' said SWAPO
President Sam Nujoma.
   South African President F.W. de Klerk said his government was
``grateful that the election proceeded peacefully, and thus accepts
the outcome.''
   Namibians voted from Tuesday through Saturday for a 72-member
assembly that will draft a constitution and declare independence
for Namibia after 74 years of South African rule.
   SWAPO will hold 41 seats in the assembly, and the Democratic
Turnhalle Alliance 21.
   The United Democratic Front will have four seats, followed by
the conservative, all-white Action Christian National, with three.
The Federal Convention of Namibia, National Patriotic Front and the
Namibia National Front each won a single seat.
   The assembly's decisions must be backed by at least 48 members.
   ``In spite of the difficulties, in spite of all the odds placed
in our way to victory, the liberation movement has won,'' said
senior SWAPO spokesman Hidipo Hamutenya.
   The election result was seen as promising for a peaceful
transition to independence for the sparsely populated region of
southern Africa.
   Some observers feared that if SWAPO won a two-thirds majority,
it might have written a constitution leaning heavily in its favor.
   Had the organization won less than 50 percent of the vote, it
may have challenged the results and accused South Africa of trying
to prevent a SWAPO government.
   The chairman of the Democratic Turnhalle Alliance, Dirk Mudge,
said his organization had no plans to align itself with another
party, but ``if SWAPO comes with a (constitutional) proposal we can
live with, we will support it.''
   The assembly is to meet within a week, and the 1,500 South
African troops in Namibia are to withdraw shortly. U.N.
peacekeepers are scheduled to leave Namibia at the end of March.
   The top U.N. official in Namibia, Martti Ahtisaari, said he
expected Namibia to achieve independence before then. Ahtisaari,
who certified the election results, said Namibia ``has given the
whole world a shining lesson in democracy.''
   U.N. Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar said he was
confident the various parties would be able to work through their
differences and adopt a constitution ``with the same degree of
enthusiasm and patriotism that they displayed during the course of
the electoral process.''
   In addition to the U.N. monitors, dozens of private groups
observed the elections. Edmund Muskie, a former senator and
secretary of state who headed the official U.S. delegation, said
``the process of the elections was victory by and for the Namibian
people.''
   In Washington, the State Department said it wished the Namibian
people well as they start drafting the new constitution.
   ``We look forward to working with the government that emerges
after independence,'' said the statement.
   In Brussels, a delegation of European parliamentarians sent to
observe the elections said there had been no fraud.
   ``There was no fraud possible,'' said Henri Saby, head of the
13-member delegation. He said the vote took place ``in an
extraordinary climate of good citizenship.''
   South Africa captured Namibia from Germany in World War I and
ruled it under a League of Nations mandate. That mandate was
rescinded by the United Nations in 1966, but South Africa refused
U.N. orders to withdraw from the territory.
   SWAPO took up arms against South Africa in 1966.
   In December 1988, South Africa agreed to grant independence to
Namibia as part of a regional treaty that also called for the
phased withdrawal of Cuban troops from Angola, Namibia's northern
neighbor. The Cubans were backing the Angolan government in its war
with rebels supported by South Africa and the United States.

   As right-wing Israelis shouted and banged their
fists on lecture hall doors Tuesday, a pro-PLO Palestinian leader
and hundreds of Jewish and Arab students discussed the bloody
conflict between their people.
   Several fistfights erupted outside the Hebrew University lecture
hall shortly after Faisal Husseini, a leading Palestinian activist,
was led in, encircled by Arab students.
   Security guards and plainclothes police scuffled with dozens of
right-wing activists wearing the knitted skullcaps of observant
Jews, and at least one Israeli was dragged out, kicking and pushing.
   But inside, the peace dialogue went on as planned by a left-wing
Arab-Jewish student group and the Jerusalem Arab Students
Committee. It was designed to mark the first anniversary of the
declaration of Palestinian independence issued by the Palestine
National Council, the PLO's parliament-in-exile.
   ``We're fighting for our own freedom and not for the enslavement
of others, for our own country and not for the destruction of
another country,'' declared Husseini, who comes from one of the
most powerful Palestinian families.
   ``I want to send a message to Israeli leaders: there's no other
way to peace but through the leaders of another people, and this
leadership is the PLO,'' he said, interrupted by loud applause.
   Israel refuses to talk to the PLO, which it officially sees as a
terrorist group bent on destroying the Jewish state. It is willing
to negotiate elections with non-PLO Palestinians from the occupied
territories and then hold talks on limited autonomy with the
elected delegates.
   Husseini, who has been jailed without trial for a total of 18
months since July 1987, insisted that Israel must talk to the PLO
if it wants to negotiate peace.
   ``I want to talk peace with (Prime Minister Yitzhak) Shamir,''
Husseini said. ``I think he's a man of war, I don't want to talk to
him and I don't like him. But he is representing the Israeli
people. Your enemies are the Palestinians and they have
representatives.''
   A Jewish student argued that Arabs from the West Bank and the
Gaza Strip could represent the Palestinian side.
   ``It's well known you receive your orders from the PLO,'' said
the student. ``The Jewish people have a psychological problem with
the PLO, so why don't you stop calling them the PLO and start peace
talks?''
   Husseini countered by saying it has been equally difficult for
him to pronounce the word ``Israel.''
   Outside, right-wingers banged on the doors, shouting: ``PLO out!
You are a leader of killers, PLO, go to hell!''
   An Israeli student jumped from his seat, shouting at Husseini:
``You're Nazis, you're killing Jews every day!'' He was dragged out
of the hall by force.
   An Arab student then demanded to know what the next stage of the
23-month-old Palestinian uprising should be.
   ``The struggle we want to lead is civil disobedience,'' Husseini
responded. ``We are pushed to it by the occupation. We can reach a
solution before that, if Israel starts to treat us as people, not
as residents or refugees.''
   At least 615 Palestinians have died of Israeli gunfire, and 41
Israelis have been slain in the rebellion.
   At the end of the three-hour meeting, security guards whisked
Husseini away through a back door _ only to find the windshield of
his car smashed.

   Soldiers raided a ranch owned by an
alleged leader of the Medellin drug cartel and found $5 million
buried in barrels, the army reported Tuesday.
   A news release from 13th Brigade headquarters in Bogota said the
ranch belonged to Jose Gonzalo Rodriguez Gacha, described by U.S.
authorities as one of the top members of the cartel, which sends
billions of dollars worth of cocaine to the United States and other
countries each year.
   It said the money, in U.S. currency, consisted of $50, $20 and
$10 bills and was buried in three barrels on a ranch near Pacho
called Cuernavaca. Pacho is about 50 miles north of Bogota.
   Cuernavaca is named for a city in Mexico and Rodriguez Gacha is
known as ``The Mexican'' because of his admiration for that country.
   President Virgilio Barco declared war on drug traffickers Aug.
19 after their assassins killed a popular opposition presidential
candidate, Sen. Luis Carlos Galan.
   Government security forces have raided ranches, mansions, office
buildings and other properties known or thought to belong to the
cocaine barons.
   The army seized the Cuernavaca ranch nearly three months ago.
Soldiers found caches of weapons and communications equipment there
last month.

<TEXT>
   The announcement Tuesday that Czechoslovakia was lifting travel
restrictions on its citizens was the latest of several changes in
Eastern Europe over the past week that ranged from surprising to
stunning. Here is a brief chronology:
   Thursday, Nov. 9 _ East Germany opened its borders to the West,
which had been closed, fortified and guarded since the Berlin Wall
was built in August 1961.
   Friday, Nov. 10 _ Todor Zhivkov, the Bulgarian Communist Party
leader, stepped down after 35 years of rigid, orthodox rule and was
replaced by Foreign Minister Petar Mladenov, seen as more open to
reform.
   Saturday, Nov. 11 _ More than 1 million East Germans visited
West Germany, taking advantage of the opening of Western borders.
The Kremlin told the restive Soviet republics of Azerbaijan and the
Baltics that laws they had passed violated the national
constitution.
   Sunday, Nov. 12 _ Mayor Erhard Krack walked across no man's land
through a new breach in the Berlin Wall and shook hands with
Wolfgang Momper, the mayor of West Berlin. Estonia's legislature
passed a resolution accusing the Soviet Union of ``aggression,
military occupation and annexation of the Estonian republic.''
   Monday, Nov. 13 _ East Germany's parliament cast its first
secret ballot, choosing reformer Hans Modrow as premier, and more
than 200,000 East Germans marched in Leipzig for free elections.
Soviet economists began discussing plans to increase wages and
wholesale prices, and sell off some state enterprises as a way of
dealing with an economic crisis and building a market system.
   Tuesday, Nov. 14 _ Premier Ladislav Adamec of Czechoslovakia,
one of the last hard-line East bloc nations, announced that
citizens no longer would need exit permits to leave the country.

   Kitty Dukakis was transferred Tuesday to a center
at New England Deaconess Hospital that treats mood disorders, a
week after she was hospitalized because she drank rubbing alcohol.
   A recovering alcoholic with a history of depression, the
52-year-old wife of Gov. Michael Dukakis was transferred from
Brigham and Women's Hospital to the Deaconess affective disorders
unit for evaluation, the governor's office said.
   Affective disorder is a psychiatric term referring to such
problems as mood swings and depression. Mrs. Dukakis' doctor has
said she suffers from depression.
   Mindy Lubber, a spokeswoman for the governor, said it wasn't
known how long Mrs. Dukakis would remain at Deaconess.
   Asked if Mrs. Dukakis was being treated for a combination of
depression and alcoholism, Ms. Lubber said: ``those are some of the
issues relating to her treatment that Mrs. Dukakis is only
discussing with her family and her doctors.''
   Janna Crittendon, a spokeswoman for the Deaconess, said Tuesday
that Mrs. Dukakis' condition was ``satisfactory.''
   The affective disorders unit is a 27-bed section run by Harvard
Medical School faculty, Ms. Crittendon said. It offers diagnosis
and treatment of patients, she said. The average length of stay is
16 days.
   Symptoms of mood disorder include disturbed sleep and disrupted
appetite and can leave the sufferer unable to concentrate on daily
activities, Ms. Crittendon said.
   Such disorders can be associated with substance abuse, Ms.
Crittendon said, adding that she was speaking generally and not
about Mrs. Dukakis' case.
   Deaconess specializes in treating the more complex and chronic
diseases, Ms. Crittendon said. It is known in particular for
research and treatment of heart ailments, cancer and AIDS and as a
venue for organ transplants, she said.
   Mrs. Dukakis was admitted to Brigham and Women's on Nov. 6 after
drinking a small amount of rubbing alcohol.
   The governor said Monday his wife had ``a slip,'' or a relapse
back into drinking when she swallowed the rubbing alcohol. Mrs.
Dukakis was treated for alcoholism last March.
   Mrs. Dukakis had earlier admitted to a long-term dependency on
diet pills, for which she also has received treatment.
   Also on Tuesday, Mrs. Dukakis' attorney on her book project,
Robert Barnett, said the memoir was about 95 percent completed and
needs a couple weeks more work.
   Publisher Simon &amp; Schuster still plans to release the book next
summer, he said.
   When Mrs. Dukakis is feeling able, she will finish the book with
her collaborator, Jane Scovell, Barnett said from Washington. He
would not discuss whether new material on her latest
hospitalization would be included.

   A Salvadoran rebel leader said Tuesday
that El Salvador's armed forces must be purged of a ``truly
criminal'' element before the rebels will resume peace talks with
the government.
   Commander Mario Lopez of the political-diplomatic commission of
the guerrillas' Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front (FMLN)
also said there would not be an immediate end to the offensive
launched by the left-wing rebels Saturday night.
   ``This is a military campaign ... of very great scope,'' he
said. ``The general command has ordered its forces to maintain
positions and advance.''
   Lopez spoke at a news conference at the foreign correspondents'
club.
   He said civilians have been joining the rebels, but declined to
give any figures.
   ``This is a process of insurrection. I couldn't say how far it
will go,'' Lopez said.
   He said the FMLN has been seeking international mediation
between the rebels and President Alfredo Cristiani's rightist
government, but there have been no results.
   A proposal Tuesday at the Organization of American States
meeting in Washington by Nicaraguan Foreign Minister Miguel
D'Escoto could lead to such mediation, Lopez said. He did not
elaborate.
   He said before the FMLN stops the offensive and agrees to resume
peace talks there must be a ``self-purge of the armed forces'' that
would lead to more democratic conditions.
   ``The ones who govern El Salvador are the armed forces; it's a
sector within the armed forces that is making the war a great
business,'' Lopez said. ``There can be no democratic process in the
country without a purge of the armed forces.''
   He said the United States ``always has bet on a military triumph
over the FMLN and that hasn't changed with (President) Bush,'' but
the rebel leadership is open to talks with Washington.

<TEXT>
   The jogger who was gang-raped, beaten and left
for dead during a teen-age ``wilding'' spree in Central Park was
released Tuesday from a Connecticut hospital after nearly seven
months of rehabilitation.
   The jogger, a 29-year-old investment banker originally from the
Pittsburgh area, will continue outpatient treatment at Gaylord
Hospital in Wallingford, Conn., a spokesman there said.
   She still is unable to recall the attack and its aftermath,
``but she has made good recovery and rehabilitation,'' said
hospital spokesman Gerald Main.
   On April 19, the jogger was on her nightly run in the park when
she was dragged 200 feet into the underbrush, raped, beaten with a
pipe and a rock and left unconscious.
   When police found her 3{ hours later, she was in a coma and had
lost almost 80 percent of her blood. She suffered brain contusions,
two head fractures, broken facial bones and bruises from head to
toe. Paramedics did not expect her to live.
   She remained in critical condition at a New York City hospital
until May 1, when she appeared to raise her eyebrows as her name
was called and raised her hand. She was walking a bit when she was
moved June 7 to Gaylord Hospital.
   By midsummer, she was reading novels, relearning basic math and
calling colleagues at Salomon Bros., where she worked before the
attack.
   Main said the jogger and her family thanked the public and press
for their support over the past months. ``This support has made a
difference in her ability to recover,'' he read from the statement.
   He said they also thanked news media for respecting her privacy
and anonymity and stressed that the woman's continued recovery ``is
highly dependent'' on her privacy and anonymity being maintained.
   Main would not say what time the patient left the hospital or
where she went, or comment beyond the prepared statement.
   The brutality of the attack focused attention on the phenomenon
of ``wilding,'' in which young criminals roam from victim to victim
to harass, attack and rob.
   The city's legions of joggers were unwilling to surrender the
park, which stretches 2{ miles through the center of Manhattan. In
June, prompted by the attack, the New York Road Runners Club
launched a safety program.
   Six teen-agers have been indicted in the attack: Raymond
Santana, Steven Lopez, Yusef Salaam, Kevin Richardson and Antron
McCray, all 15, and Kharey Wise, 17.
   All currently are involved in a state Supreme Court hearing in
Manhattan on whether statements they gave police should be allowed
as evidence at their upcoming trials. Defense lawyers maintain the
statements, in which nearly all the youth implicate themselves or
their codefendants, were coerced and therefore illegal.
   Police said those indicted were part of a gang of more than 30
youths on the ``wilding'' spree.

   The Navy, which is suspending most most
training activities for 48 hours over the next three days to review
safety, has experienced 10 serious accidents in less than three
weeks, the most recent being a fire Tuesday that injured at least
31 people.
   The Navy said the ``safety stand-down'' order requires every
ship, squadron and shore training facility to interrupt normal
operations and review basic safety and operating procedures.
   The order came about six hours after fire broke out on the USS
Inchon, an amphibious assault ship undergoing maintenance at the
shipyard in Norfolk, Va., headquarters of the Atlantic Fleet.
   Also Tuesday, an F-14 crashed into the Gulf of Mexico 60 miles
northwest of Key West, Fla. The two-man crew bailed out and was not
seriously injured.
   At the same time, a technician at the Naval Surface Weapons
Testing Center in White Oak, Md. was slightly injured when two
grams of an experimental explosive detonated in a laboratory.
   Lt. Cmdr. Steve Burnett, an Atlantic Fleet spokesman, said 23
sailors and eight civilians were injured and were taken to six
hospitals from the Norfolk fire. At least one victim was listed in
serious condition.
   Since the run of mishaps started Oct. 29, 10 people have been
killed or lost at sea and at least 53 people have been injured.
   Between Jan. 1 and Nov. 1, the Navy counted 101 ``operation and
training related'' fatalities in the service, including 47 in the
explosion aboard the USS Iowa on April 19.
   The most serious of the recent accidents occurred Oct. 29 when a
jet pilot making his first landing on an aircraft carrier crashed
into the USS Lexington in the Gulf of Mexico. The pilot and four
others on deck the ship were killed.
   There has been some debate over the accidents. Earlier in the
month, Sen. John Warner, R-Va., ranking Republican on the Senate
Armed Services Committee, called the mishaps ``an extraordinary
grouping of unrelated accidents.''
   Others like Karlene Roberts, an industrial psychologist, warned
that cutting training budgets can lead to accidents. ``Congress is
always trying to cut training budgets ... It's a prescription for
disaster,'' she said.
   Other incidents include:
   _A Navy reserve pilot flying a A-7E jet crashed Nov. 9 into an
apartment complex in Smyrna, Ga., killing two civilians and
injuring two others, including himself.
   _Three sailors and a reported $4 million worth of non-nuclear
missiles were swept by a wave from the aircraft carrier USS
Eisenhower near Cape Hatteras, N.C. on Nov. 1. One sailor was
presumed dead.
   _Nine sailors were treated for burns or smoke inhalation when
fire erupted in the boiler aboard the USS Monongahela, some 500
miles west of Gibraltar on Nov. 1.
   _A F-A-18 pilot dropped a 500-pound bomb on the guided missile
cruiser USS Reeves in the Indian Ocean, causing minor injuries to
five sailors and blowing a five-foot hole in the ship's bow on Oct.
30.
   _A sailor aboard the aircraft carrier USS Carl Vinson fell into
the Pacific about 620 miles north of Wake Island Oct. 30 and was
presumed lost.
   _Over the Nov. 11-12 weekend, one man was killed and five were
injured when the USS Kinkaid, a destroyer, collided off the coast
of Malaysia with a 430-foot freighter.

<TEXT>
   Drought-induced crop failure in Ethiopia's
two rebellious northern provinces will be worse this season than in
the 1984-85 famine that killed 1 million people, according to the
U.N. Children's Fund.
   An internal document from UNICEF obtained Tuesday by The
Associated Press says up to 2 million Ethiopians could be affected
by the drought as famine conditions develop in 1990.
   In 1984-85, relief figures indicate 1 million people starved to
death in the northern provinces of Tigre and Eritrea; in 1987-88, a
massive international relief operation prevented a similar tragedy
during another crop failure.
   ``The first signs of famine already have been reported, not only
in ... Eritrea, where influxes of displaced people are on the
increase, but also in other areas, in particular Akele Guzay
district, where farmers are selling their livestock at only
one-third of the normal price,'' the report says.
   ``Livestock disposal at very low prices is one of the early
warning indicators that a drought situation is becoming alarming,''
it said.
   UNICEF officials said they will soon announce a $9.05 million
fund-raising campaign to provide food and services to northern
Ethiopia to prevent widespread starvation.
   ``This drought _ according to the assessments of the main
harvest planting made by U.N. agencies, including UNICEF, and by
the government of Ethiopia _ will be worse than in 1984-85 in terms
of crop failure,'' the report says.
   ``In Eritrea, the crop failure is estimated to be 90 to 100
percent, while in Tigre it reaches 40 percent,'' it says.
   ``Furthermore, these two regions are afflicted by civil wars
respectively 28 and 15 years old, which restrict movements of goods
and people and limit the access of assistance.''
   Rebels in those provinces are fighting for autonomy or secession
from the Marxist central government, controlled by President
Mengistu Haile Mariam.
   Up to 333,000 metric tons of grain will be needed to feed 1.85
million people, the UNICEF report says.

   Amnesty International charged on
Wednesday that Burma's military rulers have arrested thousands of
people, carried out unfair trials and are holding political
prisoners.
   The London-based human rights group called for the commutation
of 100 death sentences that have been handed down by the martial
law government and for the release of all political prisoners.
   The Amnesty report, received in Bangkok, listed 107 ``prisoners
of conscience'' and other political prisoners believed still in
detention. Amnesty defines prisoners of conscience as people
detained solely for peacefully expressing their beliefs.
   The list of prisoners included the nation's top opposition
leader, Aung San Suu Kyi, as well as a Buddhist monk and a
novelist. Most on the list were students and members of Suu Kyi's
National League for Democracy.
   Amnesty quoted unnamed sources as saying more than 3,000 people
had been arrested since July 1989. The organization said it could
not confirm this number because it had not been able to visit
Burma, but it documented the arrests of a number of political
opponents to the regime.
   ``Amnesty believes that arrests during this period (after late
July) numbered in the thousands,'' the report said.
   Last month, the Rangoon government announced it had arrested
1,087 people for political offenses since September 1988, when a
group of military leaders brutally crushed a nationwide
pro-democracy uprising. The leaders set up a 17-man military
council and declared martial law.
   But the formation of more than 200 political parties has been
allowed and the military is promising general elections May 27 of
next year.
   The house arrest last July of Suu Kyi and Tin Oo, leaders of the
National League For Democracy, along with other senior members of
the pro-democracy party led many Western diplomats in Rangoon to
conclude that free elections were unlikely.
   The government also has said it had handed down 100 death
sentences, many by special military tribunals. Amnesty described
some of the trials as unfair by international standards.
   Similar charges have been made in recent months by the United
States, which also claims some political detainess have died under
torture. Rangoon has denied this.
   In a speech Nov. 10 Gen. Saw Maung, who heads the military
government, said citizens had nothing to be afraid of ``unless, of
course, you break the law.''
   ``There are accusations that we are following the methods of the
Japanese Kempetai. That is not true. If they say we use Gestapo
methods then they are wrong too,'' Saw Maung told a graduating
class at Burma's National Defense College. The Japanese secret
police Kempetai and the Nazi's Gestapo employed torture and
committed other atrocities during World War II.

<HEAD>Saturday Launch For NASA's Last Unmanned Rocket, Early Universe Probe</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   NASA's planned launch of its last
unmanned rocket Saturday will send the first of several satellites
to study how the universe has evolved since its birth in the ``big
bang'' 15 billion years ago, officials said Tuesday.
   The new launch date for the $150 million, 4,850-pound Cosmic
Background Explorer was announced after space agency engineers
fixed a faulty guidance computer on the rocket that will carry the
spacecraft into orbit.
   ``This is going to begin an explosion of knowledge about the
universe,'' David Gilman, manager of the $400 million Cosmic
Background Explorer program, said during a news conference at the
space agency's Jet Propulsion Laboratory.
   The satellite, the Hubble Space Telescope and three other
observatories to be placed in Earth orbit during the 1990s ``are
going to provide us with an unprecedented, unbelievable view of the
universe,'' program scientist Larry Caroff said.
   ``We will see things we haven't even imagined,'' he predicted.
``Hold on to your hats because this is going to shake up the world
of science.''
   The satellite is scheduled for launch from Vandenberg Air Force
Base on the central California coast during a 30-minute period
starting at 6:24 a.m. PST Saturday.
   The 16-by-28-foot, solar-powered satellite is to be carried into
a 559-mile-high, near-polar orbit by a 116-foot-tall Delta rocket,
the last unmanned, expendable rocket to be launched by the National
Aeronautics and Space Administration.
   NASA will continue to launch manned shuttles and possibly
unmanned cargo shuttles with reusable boosters. But the Air Force
or private companies will charge NASA to launch any payloads that
require unmanned, expendable rockets.
   The satellite's launch had been scheduled for Friday, then was
delayed until Sunday because of a malfunctioning guidance computer.
But the computer was replaced so quickly last weekend that the
launch was moved up to Saturday, said Peter Eaton, a NASA rocket
official.
   The satellite was to have originally been put in orbit by a
shuttle, but was diverted to an unmanned rocket after the 1986
Challenger disaster.
   Once in orbit and after a 30-day shakedown, the satellite will
spend up to two years measuring cosmic background radiation, which
makes up about 2 percent of the static on a television set. It
includes microwaves, heat and other electromagnetic radiation given
off by the ``big bang,'' the gargantuan explosion scientists
believe created the universe an estimated 15 billion years ago.
   ``The radiation we're measuring is actually the remnant of the
great explosion itself,'' project scientist John Mather said.
``We're looking at it as it was a very long time ago. We're seeing
the primary cosmic fossil.''
   With the three most sensitive sensors of their types, the
satellite will measure ``the collective glow of all the stars and
galaxies and whatever else has been there since the beginning,''
Mather said.
   That will help scientists learn more about what happened in the
time between three minutes after the big bang, when the first
atomic nuclei or centers formed, and 500,000 years later, when the
first atoms formed. It also will search for light from the creation
of the first stars and galaxies about 200 million years after the
primeval fireball.
   Mather said NASA will share information from the mission with
the Soviet Union, which has flown one similar research mission and
plans two others.
   A shuttle is scheduled to carry the Hubble Space Telescope into
orbit in March. An optical telescope of unprecedented power, it
also may see formation of the earliest galaxies, said Nancy
Boggess, deputy project scientist on the Cosmic Background Explorer
program.
   That will be followed by the shuttle launches of the Gamma Ray
Observatory in June and the Advanced X-ray Astrophysics Facility in
1997, Gilman said. A private, expendable rocket will launch the
Space Infrared Telescope Facility in 1999, he added.

<HEAD>Taiwan Rejects Entry of Former U.S. Attorney General Clark</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Taiwan has refused to allow former U.S.
Attorney General Ramsey Clark to enter the country to visit a
Taiwanese dissident jailed for advocating independence for this
island, another dissident said Tuesday.
   Hsieh Tsung-min told The Associated Press that Clark, now a
human rights lawyer in New York, planned to arrive in Taipei from
Tokyo Monday. He returned to New York when he was informed of
Taiwan's refusal, Hsieh said.
   Hsieh said Taiwan authorities earlier gave Clark permission to
meet dissident Hsu Hsin-liang, 48, former publisher of a dissident
magazine, who sneaked back to Taiwan in a fishing boat from
mainland China in September.
   Hsu had been living in the United States since an
anti-government riot erupted in Kaohsiung, southern Taiwan, in
1979. Although Hsu was not in Taiwan at that time, officials claim
he helped organize the riot.
   Foreign Ministry spokesman Chen Yu-chu said only that he was
informed Clark changed his mind about his Taiwan visit while in
Tokyo.
   Donald Biship, spokesman for the American Institute in Taiwan,
which handles relations between Taiwan and the United States in the
absence of diplomatic ties, declined comment.
   Hsieh said Clark had planned to offer legal advice to Hsu during
a four-day visit. Clark also planned to discuss Hsu's case with
Taiwan's Interior Ministry and Justice Ministry, Hsieh said.
   Hsu was accused of advocating independence for Taiwan while in
the United States, and he was indicted by the Taiwan High Court
last month on sedition charges.
   He is scheduled to go on trial Saturday and could be sentenced
to 20 years imprisonment if convicted.
   Earlier this month, the U.S. State Department issued a statement
expressing concern over Hsu's case, saying Washington understood he
was indicted for activities under which foreign nationals are
protected by the U.S. government.
   The Nationalists, who fled to Taiwan in 1949 after losing a
civil war to the Communists, continue to claim they are the sole
legitimate government of all China. Both the Communists and
Nationalists consider Taiwan a Chinese province and oppose an
independent Taiwan.

   A convict described by friends as a ``Dr. Jekyll
and Mr. Hyde'' was charged Tuesday with the slayings of two police
officers whose failure to follow regulations proved fatal,
authorities said.
   Stoney Harrison, 25, was arrested late Monday at a girlfriend's
home after a 10-hour citywide manhunt, police said. He was
arraigned Tuesday evening on four counts of second degree murder
and returned to jail.
   Two of the murder counts charged him with the deaths of the two
detectives and the other two with felony murder, or murder during
the furtherance of a crime _ which was escape. He also was charged
with first-degree escape and second-degree criminal possession of a
weapon.
   The maximum penalty for murder in New York is 25 years to life.
   Harrison had been taken from jail to the Queens district
attorney's office Monday to take a lie detector test and discuss a
plea bargain.
   Later, a series of mistakes allowed Harrison to steal a loaded
gun and surprise the two officers while they were returning him to
the city's jail complex on Rikers Island, authorities said Tuesday.
   ``If you make a mistake in this business, it can have terrible
results. ... These two detectives got careless for a minute or two
and it cost them their lives,'' Police Commissioner Richard Condon
said at a news conference Tuesday.
   Harrison was able to fire at least five shots from the stolen
gun while he was being driven down Grand Central Parkway. Neither
officer was able to reach revolvers in their ankle holsters and
both were dead at the scene. They were identified as Detectives
Keith L. Williams, 34, an eight-year veran, of Brooklyn, and
Richard J. Guerzon, 46, a 20-year veteran, of Merrick.
   Guerzon is to be buried Thursday, Williams on Friday.
   The suspect's story is that the two officers were shot during a
robbery, and the gunman freed him after killing the detectives,
said Assistant District Attorney Bob Alexander.
   During his brief arraignment in state Supreme Court in Queens,
Harrison stood silently as defense attorney Michael Selio said he
reserved the right to make a bail application at a later date.
   The errors began, authorities said, when Harrison was left alone
in a detectives' squad room, where he stole the gun from either an
unlocked locker or one with a defective lock. Prisoners kept in the
room are usually handcuffed to a pipe out of reach of the lockers.
   Harrison was supposed to be searched before his return to Rikers
Island; either he wasn't or someone failed to locate the
.38-caliber service revolver during their check, Condon said.
Harrison might also have been cuffed with his hands in front,
rather than behind his back, he said.
   On the way back to Rikers, Harrison was seated alone in the back
seat, with the two detectives in front _ another violation of
procedure, said Condon.
   Guerzon, who had been driving, was shot twice in the head.
Williams was shot twice in the back and once in the head.
   Despite his criminal background, Harrison's neighbors said he
was a well-behaved man whose mother made sure he received the best
of everything.
   ``He doesn't come off as arrogant, always was friendly and
polite,'' said Larry Young, who has known the mother and son for 15
years. ``He's like a Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde personality.''
   Harrison has a record dating to 1980, when he was convicted of
assault at age 16. After several drug and additional assault
charges, he was sentenced to 364 days in jail four years ago for
biting off a girlfriend's ear.
   At the time of the police shootings, he was serving a
two-to-four-year sentence on a drug conviction.
   He also was charged in July with strangling another girlfriend
after a night of partying and drug-taking and still faced trial.
   In October, he and his mother were arrested for allegedly
conspiring to murder a witness against him in the July murder. He
allegedly had his mother offer $2,000 to a hit man who turned out
to be an undercover detective.

<HEAD>House Gives Speaker Access To Secret Files</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The House on Tuesday changed its rules, which
it has been violating for years, to give its speaker full access to
secret files and hearings in the House Intelligence Committee.
   Rep. Henry Hyde, R-Ill., used the occasion to tout several
proposals he has offered but which have been stymied by the
Democratic leadership: requirement of a secrecy oath and security
clearances for members and staff on the Intelligence Committee, and
a reduction in the size of the panel from 19 to 13 members.
   But Hyde's effort to bring the issues up for a vote was defeated
on a largely party-line vote of 245 to 176.
   The old rules specified that no classified information could be
given to anyone not a member of the intelligence panel unless the
committee first voted to authorize the move and kept detailed
records of the information and to whom it was given.
   But even though they are not members of the committee, speakers
of the House have over the years received informal briefings on
government secrets.
   The rules change adopted Tuesday gives House Speaker Thomas S.
Foley, D-Wash., and his successors blanket access to the
Intelligence Committee's business. Foley formerly was a member of
the committee and maintains an active interest in intelligence
matters.
   The issue of speakers' access to secrets arose last year when
former Speaker Jim Wright, D-Texas, told reporters the Central
Intelligence Agency had sought to foment civil unrest in Nicaragua
to undermine the political stability of the leftist Sandinista
government.
   Sources later said that the information had come to the
Intelligence Committee and had been relayed to Wright through an
informal briefing.

   West Germany said Tuesday it was willing to give
East Germany massive financial aid in the style of the postwar U.S.
Marshall Plan, but demanded political and economic reforms the
Communists have so far rejected.
   East Germany's new premier said the Berlin Wall must remain, to
keep AIDS, crime and other Western problems out of his country. He
promised a coalition government but did not say whether the
opposition could join it.
   After a week of dramatic developments in East European
countries, President Mikhail S. Gorbachev of the Soviet Union said
in Moscow:
   ``They have a common direction, which fosters the building of a
European home, for it makes the countries closer, more open and
creates new opportunities for human contact and an equal exchange.''
   The Liberal Democrats, an East German party that is allied with
the Communists but shows signs of independence, said pro-democracy
groups should be invited in ``round-table'' talks about East
Germany's future.
   Discussions this spring between Polish authorities and
Solidarity, which were given that name, led to a non-Communist
government in Poland.
   Mayor Walter Momper of West Berlin said the sudden opening of
East Germany's borders was creating traffic jams, currency problems
and other economic difficulties the two governments must resolve.
   Economics Minister Helmut Haussmann of West Germany announced a
six-point aid plan including investments, joint ventures and
modernizing East Germany's dilapidated communications and transport
systems.
   Haussmann did not name a figure for the aid and said East
Germany must achieve ``thorough change'' in its centrally directed
economy.
   Reforms promised so far by Communist Party leader Egon Krenz,
who took over last month from hard-liner Erich Honecker, have
resulted in more questions than answers, Haussmann said in Bonn.
   He compared his proposal to the Marshall Plan devised by
Secretary of State George C. Marshall, which provided more than $12
billion in American aid in 1948-51 to help Europe recover from the
war.
   East German authorities have rejected the idea of adopting a
complete free-market system and new Premier Hans Modrow, a leading
reformer, says he wants ``step by step'' economic changes.
   Modrow appears to want a streamlining of the bureaucracy, but
has given no indication he will urge sweeping changes such as those
in Hungary and Poland.
   He was quoted Tuesday in the West Germany newspaper Bild as
saying the Berlin Wall can remain open to travel, but will not come
down.
   ``In our country there is little criminal activity ... cases of
AIDS and drugs are virtually unknown,'' he was quoted as saying.
``Our people are asking themselves why they shouldn't just leave
that as it is.''
   ADN, the official news agency, said the government might open a
part of the wall near the Brandenburg Gate as yet another passage
between East and West Berlin. The high-columned monument is near
the wall in East Berlin and is among the city's best-known symbols.
   Before East Germany opened its borders Thursday, the gate had
been a major rallying point for demonstrators seeking freedom to
travel to the West. Hundreds of West Berliners gathered there
Tuesday in hopes a hole would be opened.
   A leader of New Forum, East Germany's main opposition group,
said it could work with a revamped Communist Party but naming
Modrow premier was not enough.
   ``There are still too many people in top positions with whom
dialogue is not possible,'' Juergen Tallig, spokesman for the group
in Leipzig, said in a West German radio interview.
   More change could occur at a special party congress in East
Berlin on Dec. 15-17. The congress, which can change the entire
leadership, set policy and alter party statutes, was called late
Monday by the party Central Committee.
   Pro-democracy advocates have held huge demonstrations demanding
an end for the 40-year Communist monopoly on power. Although Modrow
did not indicate whether the opposition would be allowed in his
coalition, he pledged to seek more cooperation with the four small
parties allied with the Communists.
   Guenter Schabowski, one of the most prominent Politburo members
and a leading reformer, resigned as party chief for East Berlin,
ADN said, and was replaced by Hans Albrecht.
   Schabowski had indicated earlier he might surrender the post
because of a heavy workload. He still is the party propaganda chief
and political analysts believe he may get an important job in
Modrow's cabinet.
   Guenther Maleuda, the new, non-Communist speaker of Parliament,
said he would seek to alter the first article of the constitution,
which defines the Communist Party's leading role in society. The
party has used the provision to defend its power monopoly.
   The East German Red Cross said its reception centers could
handle up to 10,000 East Germans returning home. The West German
Red Cross said it expected several thousand of the 200,000 who had
settled in the West this year to return to East Germany.
   Mass emigration has cost East Germany vital skilled workers and
has strained the ability of West Germany to provide jobs and
housing.

<TEXT>
   A survey of 4,500 small business owners found
that three-quarters of them believe leveraged buyouts are bad for
business, the survey's sponsors reported Tuesday.
   The survey, conducted by Arthur Andersen's Business Group, a
subsidiary of the Big Eight accounting firm, got responses from
4,500 small and medium-sized business owners through out the United
States.
   The survey found that 77 percent of those participating believed
that buying a company with money borrowed against the company's
assets are bad for the U.S. business environment, with 22 percent
of them saying it was ``extremely negative.''
   Those surveyed also believed that leveraged buyouts adversely
affect reasearch and development expenditures, capital spending,
employment and long-term business growth, said James P. O'Halloran,
director of Arthur Andersen's Enterprise Focus Group.
   Yet 29 percent of those surveyed said they were considering
selling all or part of their business. Of those who would sell, 69
percent said they would accept a foreign investor.
   ``These figures reflect an evolution in the traditional American
dream, of building a business and passing it on to your children,''
said O'Halloran.
   ``The new American dream appears to be more short-term oriented,
allowing entrepreneurs to enjoy the fruits of their labor sooner,''
he said, adding that owner-managers ``are more likely to cash out
and use alternative family wealth planning strategies.''
   The survey, now in its fourth year, also reported that more than
80 percent of the business owners have had difficulty attracting
qualified managerial and technical personnel and 67 percent said
they were unable to find qualified semi-skilled workers.

   A House committee on Tuesday endorsed new
versions of two vetoed spending bills that comply with President
Bush's demand that they maintain a ban on most federally funded
abortions, including cases of rape or incest.
   House Speaker Thomas S. Foley said it was time for
abortion-rights activists to ``face the fact'' that Bush would
prevail this year in the dispute. But House Democrats who support
abortion rights said they may continue their fight.
   A leading abortion opponent said his group still objects to one
of the revised House bills, however, because it would allow local
money to be spent on abortions for poor women in the District of
Columbia.
   A group of four pro-choice Republican House women, meanwhile,
met with the president to express their concern over his position
on the federal abortion issue.
   And on still another abortion fight, the House backed away from
risking a third Bush veto on a foreign aid bill that includes $15
million for the U.N. Population Fund. The bill would reverse a
five-year ban on U.S. aid to that agency, which promotes Third
World family planning and birth control.
   Bush has threatened to veto the bill because of a provision
fought by abortion opponents. They charged that because the agency
operates in China, which has a one-child-per-family policy, the
money would indirectly support forced abortions there _ despite a
stipulation in the bill that the U.S. money not be used in China.
   The House voted against a move by anti-abortion forces to take
out the population fund money, but then voted 219-203 to accept an
amendment that allows Bush to block the money if he concludes it
would be used for coerced abortions.
   The House Appropriations Committee voted unanimously and without
debate to send to the floor a revised version of the $157 billion
bill for fiscal 1990 appropriations for labor, education and health
programs. Bush vetoed the bill last month because of a provision
that would permit greater use of federal money for abortions for
poor women, allowing them for victims of rape or incest.
   The panel also approved a revised bill appropriating $558
million for the District of Columbia government. Bush vetoed that
measure last month, objecting to provisions that would have allowed
the D.C. government to use its own money to finance abortions for
poor women.
   The new version of the D.C. bill would prohibit the use of
federal money for abortions in most cases. But Doug Johnson,
lobbyist for the anti-abortion National Right to Life Committee,
said it would still permit the district to spend other government
money for abortions _ and thus invites another veto in its new
version.
   The House approved the larger spending bill last month after
voting for the first time in a decade to broaden the restrict the
prohibitions on abortion financing. But the House failed by 51
votes to override Bush's veto.
   ``Without the votes to overturn that veto, we have to face the
fact that there's going to be a denial of funds,'' Foley told
reporters Tuesday, adding that pro-choice forces could try again
next year.
   ``The president has to take responsibilty for that decision,''
he said.
   Rep. Les AuCoin, D-Ore., a leader of the House abortion-rights
forces and a member of the appropriations committee, said it would
have been futile for his side to try to amend the bill in the
committee.
   He said abortion opponents may easily thwart floor amendments
using parliamentary means as well. But he said abortion-rights
forces in the Senate, who have a larger majority in that chamber,
could force the debate to continue by voting again to permit
financing in cases of rape or incest _ an outcome that could for a
second time send the bill to a House-Senate conference committee to
work out differences.
   ``That's where the end game is going to be fought _ in the
conference,'' AuCoin said.
   The abortion dispute is caught up in Congress' hurry to adjourn
for the year, as well as concerns by some Republicans that
anti-abortion positions hurt their candidates in last week's
elections and could hurt them further in 1990.
   ``The temperature is going to build, and we'll see how everyone
feels when the temperature rises even further,'' AuCoin said.
   ``I just have a feeling in my bones that a lot of people who
have been opposed to our pro-choice position are very eager to find
a way to now support the victims of rape and incest, and we intend
before it's all over to give them a chance,'' he said.
   Four Republican House women who support abortion rights came
away from the meeting with Bush saying they had voiced concerns
that the party would be damaged by an identification with
anti-abortion forces. They said Bush listened to their arguments
but gave them no commitment to relent in his opposition to the
bills permitting more federally funded abortions.
   Bush plans to speak at campaign fund-raisers for two of the
women, who are planning Senate bids. One of them, Rep. Claudine
Schneider, R-R.I., said: ``We could see the wheels of thought going
through his mind. ... I think he heard us.''

   House leaders on Tuesday were forced to slow
their push for a 33 percent congressional pay raise after the White
House balked at approving an attached ethics package.
   White House counsel C. Boyden Gray told lawmakers the plan
failed to impose enough ethics restrictions on the legislative
branch, similar to those governing the executive branch, according
to congressional sources.
   House Democratic and Republican leaders cancelled party caucuses
planned for Wednesday when, by the end of the day Tuesday, the
differences were not resolved.
   The caucuses were tentatively rescheduled for Thursday and the
House scheduled changed to accommodate them. Time was of the
essence, because of plans to adjourn Congress before Thanksgiving.
   House Speaker Thomas Foley, D-Wash., said he remained confident.
He was leading an in-House lobbying effort rarely seen for even the
most important legislation.
   Foley and Majority Leader Richard Gephardt, D-Mo., plan to
appear before the House Republican Conference, while their GOP
counterparts, Minority Leader Robert Michel, R-Ill., and Minority
Whip Newt Gingrich, R-Ga., were going before the Democratic Caucus.
   No one could remember that happening.
   The ``rather unprecedented show of bipartisan support'' would
coincide with formal introduction of the pay and ethics plan, said
Rep. Vic Fazio, D-Calif., chairman of the panel that drafted the
proposal.
   In advance of public release of the plan, House leaders put the
pressure on in private meetings of committees and state
delegations. They urged support for the package, provided arguments
to use when defending it with constituents _ and urged those
opposing the package to do so quietly.
   The extraordinary effort was afoot because pay is one of the
most politically sensitive issues in Congress.
   To ease the electoral angst, the pay plan would put off the bulk
of the increase until after next year's election.
   A raise of 7.9 percent would take effect on Jan. 1, 1990,
raising congressional pay from $89,500 to $96,600. A year later,
lawmakers would get a 25 percent increase. Federal judges and top
executive branch officials, whose pay is tied to that of Congress,
would also get the increases.
   The initial increase was being billed as a ``cost-of-living
adjustment.''
   The second installment would be tied to an end to members'
bolstering their personal incomes by making speeches to interest
groups. Good-government groups, including Common Cause, have
attacked the acceptance of speech honoraria as a corrupting force
in Congress.
   Fazio said Tuesday that the pay plan was set up so that if the
25 percent raise is later killed, the honoraria system would be
restored.
   Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell, D-Maine, said the Senate
would also consider eliminating honoraria but over a longer
timetable than the House and without the 25 percent raise.
   However, support among senators for that position was difficult
to determine.
   Sen. Trent Lott, R-Miss., said he considered different pay
scales for the House and Senate ``a mistake.''
   Sen. Timothy Wirth, D-Colo., said he thought it would be
``hypocritical.''
   Lott said he favored having the Senate adopt something very
close to the House plan, with only small changes in the ethics
rules to account for institutional differences.
   But how many senators shared his viewpoint was hard to determine
because members were playing their cards close until the House
acts. Bring up the issue and you get ``a lot of smiles and ducking
out back doors,'' he said.
   The waffling in the Senate generated nervousness in the House,
where the last thing members want to do is vote for a pay raise and
not get it.
   Rep. William H. Gray, D-Pa., said the Senate was handling it
``in their normal manner, which is the way most multi-millionaires
do. They pound their breasts and say we don't dare talk about the
possibility of a cost of living adjustment, while they live off
their interest and speaking fees.''
   On the average, senators have much more personal wealth than
House members. Their current rules also allow them to bolster their
incomes by up to 40 percent with speaking fees, compared to 30
percent in the House.
   Foley and the House leadership spent several hours Tuesday
working out final details of the package with White House counsel
C. Boyden Gray.
   ``Let there be no doubt about the president's support for the
ethics package. It's ours,'' Fitzwater said. ``We just want them to
pass a good, strong package that meets up to the standards we set
in our proposal.''

   Talks between Nicaraguan officials and the
Contra rebels remained deadlocked Tuesday night as the two sides
were unable to bridge their differences over terms for a cease-fire
and for demobilization of the insurgents, participants said.
   As the fourth day of talks ended, Nicaraguan Cardinal Miguel
Obando y Bravo told reporters he was less optimistic Tuesday night
than he was last Thursday when the negotiations opened at the
United Nations.
   Asked why there is a stalemate, Obando y Bravo said, ``It's
difficult because each side has his own point of view.''
   The head of the Sandinista delegation, Vice Foreign Minister
Victor Hugo Tinoco, said he was somewhat more optimistic than he
was after the conclusion of the talks Monday night.
   The discussions will resume Wednesday afternoon.
   Obando y Bravo is officially described as a ``witness'' at the
talks. Also participating are representatives from the United
Nations, the Organization of American States and the Honduran
government.
   A key sticking point is a Sandinista demand that rebels now
based inside Nicaraguan territory return to base camps in Honduras
immediately after a joint cease-fire is achieved. At that point,
the demobilization of the Contras would begin.
   The rebel position is that the estimated 5,000 Contras in
Nicaragua should be allowed to remain at their positions once the
cease fire is called.
   The chief Contra negotiator, Col. Enrique Bermudez, said the
rebels are wary of demobilization because it is an ``irreversible
step'' that must be accompanied by guarantees for the rebels'
safety.
   The Sandinista position further states that once all Contra
forces have returned to the base camps in Honduras, the United
States would turn over to an international commission humanitarian
funds earmarked for the Contras.
   The funds would be used ``to contribute to the peace process,''
the Sandinista proposal asserts.

   The Navy, alarmed over a string of serious
accidents, Tuesday ordered an unprecedented stand-down from most
routine manuevers to permit ``a hard look at all levels and at
every detail'' of safety.
   The order requires ships, air squadrons and shore installations
to interrupt normal operations and review basic safety and
operating procedures for a 48-hour period sometime during the next
three days.
   However, it will allow such operations as U.S. ship movements in
the Persian Gulf and drug interdiction activities to continue.
   Adm. Carlisle A. H. Trost, the chief of naval operations who
ordered the action, said it is the first time in his memory the
Navy has done such a thing.
   ``Prudent leadership demands that we take look at everything
that might be a possible ause for this recent spate of accidents,
regardless of their severity,'' Trost told reporters at a hastily
called Pentagon press conference.
   The admiral said the review asks all commanders to ask, ``Are we
adhering to all the proper procedures, are we doing what we should
be, the way we should be doing it? ... Is there something we're
overlooking? Are people getting careless?''
   Trost said he has found no common thread in the recent spate of
accidents. Some were the result of mechanical failure and others
came from a lapse of attention to detail or procedure, he said.
   He said he did not believe that commanders were working their
sailors too hard, but that he also wanted to ensure that no
short-cuts were being taken during the many dangerous activities
that the Navy must undertake every day.
   ``A stand-down ... does not say, bring ships in from sea, stop
flying airplanes completely. It does say the routine training,
administrative functions are secondary to the review of these
safety procedures. Clearly, operations around the world must
continue,'' Trost said.
   ``Our prime resonsibility is to ensure that we have a safe
working environment around the world, so people come back home to
their families safely,'' the admiral said.
   The action came as the Navy has suffered through a series of
mishaps since Oct. 29 in which 10 people have been killed or lost
at sea and at least 45 people injured.
   Between Jan. 1 and Nov. 1, the Navy counted 101 ``operation and
training related'' fatalities, including 47 in the explosion aboard
the USS Iowa on April 19.
   Trost defended the Navy's safety record, saying that if the
deaths from the Iowa disaster are not counted, this year would have
been the ``safest year in this decade'' in respect to Navy
accidents.
   Another Navy spokesman, Lt. Cmdr Craig Quigley, said commanders
will be able to decide when to conduct the 48-hour safety
evaluation.
   ``This is a stand-down, not a shutdown,'' Quigley said. ``There
is no degradation of the readiness posture.''
   Overall, the Navy has 599,000 full-time personnel and some 566
ships _ and usually a third of those are at sea for training at any
one time.
   On Tuesday, before the announcement was made at the Pentagon, a
U.S. Navy F-14 jet fighter crashed in the Gulf of Mexico 60 miles
northwest of Key West, Fla., with the crew escaping serious injury.
   In a separate incident, a fire aboard an amphibious assault ship
in Norfolk, Va., injured 31 people. The fire broke out aboard the
USS Inchon while it underwent shipyard maintenance in Norfolk, the
Navy said.
   And at White Oak, Md., a technician was injured when twio grams
of an experimental explosive mixture detonated at a laboratory at
the Naval Surface Weapons Testing Center.
   The recent accidents have included a training jet crashing into
an aircraft carrier off Florida, sailors who have been washed
overboard on two different aircraft carriers and the accidental
bombing of a cruiser in the Indian Ocean.
   In their statement Tuesday, Trost and Navy Secretary H. Lawrence
Garrett III told fleet commanders and other senior officers they
should ``leave no stone unturned to ensure the safety of operations
is foremost in the minds of all hands.''
   ``The obligation we have to bring every sailor home safely and
husband the scarce resource of combat readiness dictates a hard
look at all levels and at every detail,'' the statement said.
   The order also requires all commanders to report their findings.
   Rep. Ike Skelton, D-Mo., a member of the House Armed Services
Committee, said it was a ``very wise move'' on the Navy's part to
review procedures.
   Skelton said it is often forgotten that ``even training under
the best of circumstances, it can be a dangerous profession.''
   Rep. Charles Bennett, D-Fla., chairman of the House Armed
Services subcommittee on seapower and strategic and critical
materials, also said the Navy's decision was wise, but he
complained the Navy has decided to make Capt. Fred Moosally,
skipper of the USS Iowa, eligible for another major command.
   The Florida Democrat said Garrett ``could accomplish the same
objective if he did not ... advance people in rank who don't do a
good job.''
   The former chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Adm. William
Crowe Jr., said: ``It's important that the American people
understand that what our Navy does can be dangerous. This is tough
stuff. We're going to have accidents, but we try very hard not to.
I think ... that attitude is reflected in Adm. Trost's decision.''
   Crowe, who retired last month, spoke with reporters as he was
visiting in the Pentagon at the time of the Navy's announcement.

   Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar
said Tuesday that Namibia's elections were free and fair and hailed
voters in the territory for their ``political maturity.''
   The U.N. chief also praised South African election officials and
U.N. poll- watchers for playing their part in making the election
run smoothly.
   ``The fact that the elections proceeded in a peaceful and
orderly manner and that the political parties observed the agreed
code of conduct during the election process was testimony to the
political maturity of the Namibian people,'' Perez de Cuellar told
the Security Council.
   The newly elected Constituent Assembly will open its
deliberations to write a constitution and organize a government
next week, said U.N. spokesman Francois Giuliani.
   Namibians voted from Tuesday through Saturday for the 72-member
assembly, which will draft a constitution and declare independence
for Namibia after 74 years of South African rule.
   The leftist South-West Africa People's Organization won 57
percent of the ballots cast, according to results announced
Tuesday. But it did not win the two-thirds majority that would have
allowed it to single-handedly write the constitution.
   The Democratic Turnhalle Alliance, a multiracial coalition that
favors a capitalist economy, finished second with 29 percent.

   The House on Tuesday approved a bill aimed at
reforming management of the Department of Housing and Urban
Development and eliminating opportunities for influence-peddling
and political favoritism.
   The House agreed by a voice vote to send to the Senate a HUD
reform package that includes proposals from Secretary Jack Kemp as
well as others arising from a congressional investigation of the
the department's multibillion-dollar scandals.
   The quick action came after the House Banking subcommittee on
housing and community development approved the bill last week and
stripped away a larger proposal to revamp federal housing programs.
Some Democrats had hoped to keep the two tied together as a way of
forcing congressional action on the housing program revision.
   The bill requires that consultants and lobbyists working on HUD
programs register with the department and identify for whom they
are working, and report any fees. Civil penalties would be imposed
for those who fail to comply.
   Grant recipients would have to report any use of consultants and
lobbyists.
   The measure creates the new positions of chief financial officer
for the department and comptroller of the Federal Housing
Administration, to oversee financial management. It includes
reforms in the FHA-insured mortgage program, including a
prohibition on loans for second homes.
   The bill includes restrictions on the Section 8 moderate
rehabilitation program, which provided subsidies for renovating
low-income housing that were at the heart of evidence of
influence-peddling and political favoritism in the scandals. The
bill limits the number of housing units which may be subsidized per
project to 100.
   It also authorizes $25 million for the department to monitor and
evaluate its programs _ less than the 0.5 percent of program
spending, or about $100 million, that Kemp asked for.
   The bill also includes provisions aimed at ensuring that housing
assistance grants are distributed without political favoritism. It
requires allocation on the basis of formulas and need, and requires
that the department consider any low-income housing tax credits
that may also be available to developers receiving grants.
   It requires full disclosure of financin decisions, and places
restrictions on accounts from which the secretary has discretion to
spend.
   In the case of the Community Development Block Grants, it
increases form 60 percent to 75 percent the amount of assistance
that must be used for projects benefiting the poor. Kemp had
proposed an even tighter requirement.
   The bill also restricts the administration's ability to fire the
department's inspector general.

   The House Education and Labor Committee voted
unanimously Tuesday to approve a bill guaranteeing a wide range of
rights to disabled Americans, the first House panel to approve the
measure since the Senate passed it in September.
   Three other House committees must approve the bill _ Judiciary,
Energy and Commerce, and Public Works and Transportation.
   The version approved Tuesday was virtually the same as the
Senate measure, which passed 76-8. Some clarifications were added
to the bill, which prevents discrimination against the disabled in
employment, public accommodations, public transportation and access
to telephone service.
   The clarifications were the result of bipartisan negotiations,
just as the Senate bill was the result of negotiations with the
White House, which had sought to soften timetables and enforcement
provisions.
   The House version clarifies that although rehabilitated drug
users are considered disabled and protected under the act, a person
who currently uses drugs and is otherwise disabled is not protected.
   Although the vote Tuesday was unanimous, Republicans
unsuccessfully fought to introduce several amendments reflecting
concerns of the small business community.
   When considering the ability of a business that is part of a
larger entity to pay for changes required under the law, courts may
consider the financial resources of the overall entity, according
to one of the clarifications.
   Also, the House version says that the maximum fine of $50,000
for violations of the public accommodations provision applies to
all violations that make up a ``pattern and practice'' suit brought
by the attorney general, and not an individual violation. Second
violations carry a maximum fine of $100,000 under the same standard.
   Lawmakers had been hoping to have a House version passed and a
final bill ready for President Bush's signature by Christmas. Such
an outcome appears unlikely given the present pace of hearings.

   The race for the Nicaraguan presidency is a dead
heat, according to a poll by a Miami TV station, with support
nearly even for Sandinista President Daniel Ortega and U.S.-backed
candidate Violeta Chamorro.
   Univision News' pollster suggested that a position by the Roman
Catholic church, which has suffered years of harassment from the
Sandinistas, could tip the election.
   In the poll, which was taken at the end of October, Ortega
received 40 percent and Chamorro 39 percent.
   Eight other candidates got a total of 5 percent, and 16 percent
of the sample of 1,129 voters said it was undecided. The poll had a
margin of plus or minus 3 percent.
   The poll is the first independently sponsored poll among voters
registered for the Feb. 25 election that challenges the rule of the
Marxist-leaning Sandinistas who have held power since toppling
dictator Anastasio Somoza in July 1979.
   Ortega, elected in 1984, seeks another five-year term. Mrs.
Chamorro's United Nicaraguan Opposition, or UNO, is a coalition of
12 of Nicaragua's 21 registered parties.
   Sergio Bendixen, of Bendixen and Schroth Polls, which did the
survey, noted that only 25 percent of those polled consider the
United States a friend whereas the Soviet Union and Cuba received
respective friendship rankings of 66 percent and 70 percent.
   The U.S. government-backed Contra fighters seeking to topple the
Sandinistas also got across-the-board low ratings.
   He said the numbers tended to hold up even among those who
oppose the Sandinistas.
   The poll said Miguel Cardinal Obando y Bravo, the head of
Nicaragua's Roman Catholic Church, had a ``favorable'' rating of 67
percent and that among the undecided voters it was nearer 80
percent.
   ``That 16 percent may look to the Cardinal for an indirect
signal if he decides to sent one,'' Bendixen said.
   The company has done pre-election polls in eight other countries
since 1984 and never missed by more than 3 percent except where
there were widespread allegations of irregularities.
   Overall, 57 percent of those polled gave positive marks to the
Sandinistas for what they have done since 1979 and 39 percent had a
negative opinion.
   Among other things, the poll showed:
   _ That 58 percent of those polled think Nicaragua's elections
will be honest and 27 percent predict fraud.
   _ Sixty-one percent say life was better before the Sandinista
Revolution and only 24 said it had improved since.
   _ Forty-four percent think the Sandinistas will give up power if
they lose and 41 percent think they will not.
   _ Generally speaking, 56 percent think things are going badly in
Nicaragua and 41 percent think things are going well.
   _ Thirty-six percent think the Sandinistas are responsible for
Nicaragua becoming one of the poorest nations in the hemisphere;
Thirty-three percent blamed the United States and the Contra war
and 19 percent said both were to blame. Fifty-seven percent blame
the United States for problems in general.
   _ Fifty-eight percent said the opposition parties are free to
campaign and 33 percent said the government is harassing the
opposition.
   _ American assistance of $9 million to the Supreme Electoral
Council and the Nicaraguan opposition has approval from 56 percent
and disapproval from 35 percent. Such aid is legal in Nicaragua if
not given covertly.

<DATELINE>SAN SALVADOR, El Salvador (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Left-wing rebels on Tuesday
claimed control of portions of eight of El Salvador's 14 provinces
and declared they would intensify efforts to seize the entire
country.
   President Alfredo Cristiani said his government is not and was
never threatened by the fierce, 3-day-old guerrilla offensive that
has turned the capital into a battlefield.
   Government aircraft rocketed and strafed rebel positions on the
northern and eastern perimeters of San Salvador and thousands of
residents fled the battle zones.
   At least 503 people have been killed and more than 1,000 wounded
across El Salvador since the guerrillas launched their offensive
Saturday night, according to military, hospital and morgue reports.
   The rebels' Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front (FMLN)
issued a communique calling on its forces to ``take control of the
whole country,'' but also said it was willing to pursue a
``democratic solution.'' It said local governments would be
established in areas held by the rebels.
   Cristiani, a rightist who took office June 1, said government
forces have ``neutralized'' insurgents on San Salvador's
southeastern, southern and western periphery, but that combat
continues against rebels on the northern outskirts.
   ``The army is advancing, but advancing slowly,'' he told a news
conference. He accused the guerrillas of holding civilians hostage
and of using them as screens against army counteroffensives.
   ``The government was never in danger,'' he said. ``The people
stated clearly and out loud that they were not going to support the
FMLN. ... There is no danger whatever of the government being
toppled.''
   The degree of civilian support for the rebels, who have
entrenched themselves in several northern and eastern working-class
suburbs, is difficult to gauge.
   Reporters have witnessed what appears to be respectful, even
amicable, treatment of the insurgents _ including the giving of
food, water and intelligence. But it is unclear if the civilians
feel coerced by the presence of hundreds of heavily armed
combatants in their neighborhoods.
   Cristiani denied air force planes and helicopters had bombarded
civilian zones where the guerrillas are entrenched.
   But Gen. Humberto Larios, minister of defense, virtually
contradicted the president when, at the same news conference, he
acknowledged that helicopters have fired rockets at guerrilla
positions.
   Associated Press reporters and photographers in northern and
eastern sections of the city were able to visit rebel-held zones
and saw air attacks.
   Nearly 100 civilians have been killed and more than 680 wounded
in this capital since the fighting began, many of them reportedly
casualties of air attacks. Thousands of others have fled the battle
zones.
   U.S. Ambassador William Walker told an afternoon news conference
in the capital, ``It is not a situation that is any means stable as
yet.''
   He said the FMLN was ``pulling out all the stops'' in the
offensive but failing to achieve either its political or military
objectives.
   Rebels with light anti-tank weapons attacked a national police
unit near his residence during the night but they were repelled by
troops, Walker said.
   A guerrilla leader who uses the pseudonym Carlos Argueta said,
``It's a new kind of war that could lead to the end of the war.''
He spoke with AP in a rebel-controlled district in the capital's
northern neighborhood of Zacamil.
   FMLN leaders ordered the offensive after announcing they would
not participate in peace talks sceduled for Nov. 20-21 in Caracas,
Venezuela. They said Cristiani's rightist government was not
negotiating seriously and blamed it for the Oct. 31 bombing of a
union headquarters that killed 10 people and wounded 29. Two
Americans were among the wounded.
   El Salvador is under a rebel-declared traffic ban, a state of
siege and 6 p.m.-6 a.m. curfew. The army ordered a 24-hour curfew
on embattled districts in San Salvador.
   U.S.-supplied Skymaster propeller planes were seen firing
rockets at residential areas in Zacamil and in Soyapango, an
eastern suburb of the capital.
   Helicopter gunships strafed rebel-held positions. Some
neighborhoods were sealed off by government troops but in other
districts there were only rebel units.
   In Zacamil, where five-story apartment buildings rise above
squatters' shacks, the FMLN contingent was led by Claudio
Rabindranath Armijo, who uses the war name Commander Chico.
   Some fighters were as young as 13, carrying AK-47 assault
rifles. Armijo was accompanied by a one-armed communications
officer with a field radio.
   Although the rebels' military domination of Zacamil was solid,
their political control was not.
   Hundreds, perhaps thousands, of residents remained in the
neighborhood, aiding the guerrillas, but hundreds of others fled
the community.
   Armijo said rebel commanders were trying to persuade the people
to support them but those who didn't were free to leave.
   Col. Arturo Lopez, an armed forces spokesman, described the
residents of northern suburbs as hostages of ``terrorist elements.''
   He said as of Tuesday morning 309 guerrillas had been killed,
160 wounded and 60 captured. He gave military casualties as 106
killed and 231 wounded.
   Lopez said the military had counted 17 civilians killed and 86
wounded throughout the couuntry. But hospitals and morgues reported
88 civilians killed and 662 wounded only in San Salvador since the
offensive began.
   In a broadcast on the rebels' clandestine Radio Venceremos, the
FMLN declared parts of eight provinces ``liberated zones.'' It said
local governments would be established in areas of Chalatenango,
Morazan, San Miguel, La Union, Usulutan, Cuscatlan, San Vicente and
Cabanas provinces. The guerrillas have controlled areas in those
provinces for years.
   FMLN leaders have said in the past they could not expect a
battlefield victory over the U.S.-backed government. They have an
estimated 7,000 guerrillas and 11,000 irregulars fighting the
government's 56,000-member security forces.
   The Salvadoran conflict has taken 70,000 lives the last decade.

   The lone elected black on Miami's city commission
won overwhelming support from black voters to defeat his Cuban-born
challenger in Tuesday's runoff elections.
   With 86 of 86 precincts reporting and absentee ballots counted,
Miller Dawkins, 64, a two-term incumbent, had 18,245 votes, or 52.7
percent, to 16,402 votes, or 47.3 percent, for Joe Carollo.
   Totals from ethnic-dominated precincts in this racially tense
city showed Dawkins carrying nearly 99 percent of the black vote
and 75 percent of the ``Anglo'' vote, while Carollo carried the
largest bloc, Hispanics, with 78 percent.
   Dawkins had said he didn't believe his was ``the black seat,''
but he also said the city's blacks _ with about 30 percent of the
voters _ deserved representation on the commission. Carollo, 34, a
former commissioner, ran Spanish-language ads that suggested ``all
the Cubans vote for Carollo.''
   In the other race, former commissioner Rosario Kennedy, 44,
failed to regain the seat she resigned this summer against Miriam
Alonso, 48. Ms. Alonso, riding heavy Hispanic support, had 17,561
votes, or 53.1 percent, to 15,461 votes, or 46.8 percent, for Ms.
Kennedy.

   Dawkins, an administrator at Miami-Dade Community College, led a
six-candidate primary Nov. 7 by 691 votes over Carollo. ``Black
Seat in Jeopardy'' was the front-page headline in The Miami Times,
a black-oriented weekly newspaper.
   Dawkins was supported by some Hispanic leaders who said it was
important symbolically to have at least one black on the commission.
   Carollo, a former police officer who served two terms on the
commission before losing the 1987 election, ran a slashing campaign
that linked Dawkins with a drug trafficker and called him the worst
commissioner in Miami history. In his fiery years on the
commission, Carollo often brought his anti-Communism into
commission debates.
   Some key Cuban-American leaders had backed Cuban-born attorney
Victor De Yurre in his 1987 defeat of Carollo.
   Mayor Xavier Suarez, easily re-elected last week to a new four
year-term, called Carollo disruptive and supported Dawkins.
   De Yurre and ``Anglo'' J.L. Plummer will be up for re-election
in two years. The mayor also sits on the commission.
   Ms. Kennedy charged Ms. Alonso with ``a penchant for
demagoguery.'' Her commercials called Ms. Alonso ``an opportunist
who does not respect the law,'' a reference to a 1988 court
decision that knocked Ms. Alonso off the Dade County commission
ballot because of a residency violation.
   Ms. Alonso, a Little Havana populist, concentrated her campaign
among Hispanic voters. She led the six-candidate primary by 235
votes.
   Athalie Range, who is black, was picked as interim commissioner
after Ms. Kennedy's resignation. She did not seek election to a
full term.
   Miami's 104,232 registered voters for the nonpartisan races
included 44,034 foreign-born Hispanics _ estimates of all Hispanics
range to 50 percent _ 32,021 blacks and 28,199 non-Latin whites, or
Anglos.

   Dennis A. Britton, deputy managing editor with
the Los Angeles Times, Tuesday was named editor of the Chicago
Sun-Times, the city's second-largest newspaper.
   Britton, 49, will join the Sun-Times on Dec. 4, Publisher
Charles T. Price announced.
   He succeeds Kenneth D. Towers, who was named to the newly
created post of vice president of reader relations on Aug. 30.
Towers had served as executive editor and vice president at the
paper since 1987.
   Britton, 49, said he wants to make the tabloid ``more
competitive, more compelling, more challenging, more exciting.''
   The Sun-Times' current daily and Sunday circulations are 535,864
and 563,148 respectively, compared with 720,155 and 1.1 million for
the Chicago Tribune. The figures represent declines for the
Sun-Times and gains for the Tribune.
   Britton said he would battle the circulation problem by making
the Sun-Times ``a newspaper that absolutely reflects its readers''
that would build on its strength of focusing on local coverage.
   Britton will report to Price and Sam S. McKeel, president and
chief executive officer of the Sun-Times Co., parent of the
newspaper.
   Britton has been on the staff of the Los Angeles Times for 23
years, serving as deputy managing editor in charge of national,
foreign, business and economic coverage for the past six years. The
Santa Barbara, Calif., native joined the Times as a copy editor in
1966.

   A fire broke out aboard a Navy carrier
Tuesday, injuring 31 people on the same day the service ordered its
ships and planes to halt normal operations for 48 hours due to a
string of accidents.
   The fire aboard the helicopter carrier USS Inchon, which was in
a shipyard for routine repairs, was the ninth serious accident
involving Navy ships and planes in the past three weeks.
   In another accident Tuesday, a Navy F-14 Tomcat fighter went
down 60 miles northwest of Key West, Fla., while on a routine
training mission, the Navy said. The two fliers parachuted to
safety.
   The fire aboard the Inchon was reported at 9:30 a.m. in the
shore power cable compartment, where lines supplying power to the
ship enter from the pier, said Lt. Cmdr. John Lloyd, a spokesman
for the Atlantic Fleet.
   The fire was extinguished within 10 minutes with help from the
USS Harlan County, which was docked nearby, Lloyd said. The fire
was contained in the compartment, but the helicopter carrier's
hangar deck sustained smoke and heat damage, he said.
   Twenty-three sailors who helped fight the fire and eight
civilians were taken to six hospitals for smoke inhalation, the
spokesman said. Nine were admitted, and the rest were treated and
released. One man was in serious condition with smoke-inhalation
burns at Sentara-Norfolk General Hospital, said Deborah Meyers, a
hospital spokeswoman.
   The 602-foot Inchon has a crew of 675 and can carry up to 2,000
Marines and 20 helicopters.
   The crash of the F-14 occurred around 1 p.m., Petty Officer 2nd
Class Michael Frost said at Naval Air Station Key West.
   The pilot, Lt. j.g. John T. Burns, 26, and the radar intercept
officer, Lt. Donovan Williams, 31, escaped without serious injury,
officials said. The two men are based at Oceana Naval Air Station
in Virginia Beach, Va.
   The crash occurred shortly before the Navy order that all
operations cease for 48 hours during the next three days while
safety procedures are reviewed.
   The order requires every ship, squadron and shore training
facility to interrupt normal operations and review basic safety and
operating procedures.
   Ten people have been killed or lost at sea and at least 45 have
been injured in the series of accidents since Oct. 29.
   The accidents included a training jet crashing into an aircraft
carrier off Florida, sailors washed overboard on two different
aircraft carriers and the accidental bombing of a cruiser in the
Indian Ocean.

<HEAD>Hawkins Flunks Bush as `Education President'</HEAD>
<HEAD>EDs: INSERTS grafs 9-11: ``Replying to,'' with Cavazos' reponse</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TAMARA HENRY</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The chairman of the House Education and Labor
Committee gave George Bush failing marks as the ``education
president'' Tuesday and accused him of blocking the education
secretary from doing a good job.
   Rep. Augustus Hawkins, D-Calif., acknowledged to reporters at
the National Press Club, ``I feel rather presumptive in grading the
president but I've been asked to do so.'' He then launched into
harsh criticisms of Bush, who pledged to become the ``education
president'' if elected.
   ``There is not a single accomplishment, initiative, or
educational credit with which the president can be identified, even
if the summit is so regarded,'' said Hawkins, referring to the
recent two-day meeting of Bush and the nation's governors that
resulted in a push for national performance goals.
   However, Hawkins was kinder to Education Secretary Lauro
Cavazos, noting ``he and I are very, very friendly.''
   ``I think he's a fine, honorable man. I think he has good
motives,'' said Hawkins. ``I think that if he was not restrained,
he probably would do very well. I think under the restraints, he
can't.''
   Hawkins said that Cavazos is being hampered by policies pushed
by the Office of Management and Budget and the White House, which
``I think differ diametrically from his own philosophy.''
   ``I think he's trying to do a good job in a very desperate sort
of way but will not be able to succeed because he has to accept the
policies of the administration,'' said Hawkins, who predicted
Cavazos would not complete his term at the Department of Education.
   Asked about concrete accomplishments of Cavazos, Hawkins said,
``I don't know of any.''
   Replying to Hawkins, Cavazos said in a statement: ``The remarks
made are unfounded and the allegations misleading, at a time when
the national urgently needs a constructive dialogue between the
administration and the Congress.
   ``The president knows that this nation faces a dangerous
education deficit and we are determined to directly confront the
gravity of the situation. Business as usual will not suffice.
   ``The president and I have proposed a far-reaching education
agenda for this nation. We have invigorated the education debate
across this country ... I take great honor and consider it a
privilege to serve President Bush.''
   As for Bush, Hawkins said, ``I am afraid the president's record
is an embarrassing `0 for 4.''' He pointed to the administration's
efforts to push the concept of allowing parents toselect the school
their children will attend, even though parental choice has not
been ``adequately debated, legislated or evaluated.''
   ``The administration is promoting choice to replace full funding
and implementation of current federal elementary and secondary
education programs, as embodied in the School Improvement Act of
1988,'' he said.
   Hawkins also cited Bush's veto of the education appropriations
bill, which he said would have enabled 1 million additional
disadvantaged children to improve their reading and math skills.
Bush vetoed the legislation because it contained an expansion of
abortion funding that he opposed.
   The California Democrat also criticized Bush for excluding from
the summit educators, members of Congress and representatives from
business, teachers and parents.

   One American soldier and one South
Korean soldier were killed and seven Americans were injured when a
U.S. Army personnel carrier overturned during a training exercise,
the Army said Wednesday.
   An Army statement said the personnel carrier rolled down a slope
Tuesday during manuevers near Camp Casey, north of Seoul. Two
soldiers on the carrier were killed and six were injured in the
accident and a seventh soldier was injured while trying to help
those in the stricken vehicle, it said.
   Officials were investigating the cause of the accident.
   Names of the dead and injured were being withheld pending
notification of next of kin. The carrier belonged to the 4th
Chemical Company of the U.S. 2nd Infantry Division.
   The dead Korean soldier was part of South Korean forces assigned
to U.S. units in South Korea.
   About 43,000 U.S. troops are based in South Korea under a mutual
defense treaty.

   The Foreign Ministry on Tuesday objected to
U.S. plans to deploy Marines near the U.S.-Mexican border in
anti-drug operations.
   ``The Mexican government wants to make clear that it does not
share in _ nor support _ the measures announced yesterday (Monday)
by the U.S. Defense Department regarding the use of the armed
forces in a location close to the shared border,'' the ministry
said.
   Washington announced on Monday the formation of a military
intelligence center at Fort Bliss near El Paso, Texas, that reports
said would use 75 U.S. Marines in border drug-patrol operations. El
Paso is across the border from the Mexican city of Ciudad Juarez.
   The Foreign Ministry statement said the U.S. and Mexican
governments have established effective cooperation in the war
against drugs, but Washington's ``decision made unilaterally''
could have negative repercussions along the border. It did not
elaborate on the possible effects.
   ``The Mexican government recognizes the sovereign right of all
nations to institute measures in accord with their national
interests in their respective territories,'' the statement said.
   ``However, the Mexican government believes that among neighbors,
especially in friendly countries, mutual consultation is prudent
for both sides.''
   Meanwhile, the attorney general's office announced four
Colombians were arrested and 1,320 pounds of cocaine and $2 million
were seized by police at a small airstrip near Tijuana.
   At a news conference Tuesday, the attorney general's office
identified one of the suspects as Guillermo Garcia Ramirez and said
he recently was released from a U.S. prison after serving a
sentence for drug-related charges.
   Authorities gave this account of the incident that occurred
Sunday:
   Police detained Garcia Ramirez and Jesus Antonio Hurtado Burgos
when they met the pilot and co-pilot of a Turbo Commander airplane
that arrived from Cali, Colombia.
   Pilot Luis Carlos Ramirez Valderrama and co-pilot Edinson Tosse
Munoz also were arrested at the paved landing strip near Baja
California state's main north-south highway.
   The cocaine was to be transferred to the two men waiting for the
plane for shipment to New York via California.
   Garcia Ramirez and Hurtado Burgos had arrived at the airfield in
a pickup truck, inspected the landing area and hid in underbrush.
   Some hours later, when the plane flew over, the two men directed
its landing and began to unload packets of cocaine.
   Police, in position because of information about the planned
transaction, moved in, making the arrests and seizing the cocaine
and money.

   The Senate approved a bill Tuesday making
Pennsylvania's abortion laws the toughest in the nation, as the
first state to take advantage of greater authority allowed by the
Supreme Court.
   The bill, approved on a 33-17 vote and passed three weeks ago by
the House, goes to the House leadership Wednesday for a formal
signature, then to Democratic Gov. Robert P. Casey, who has said he
would sign it.
   Pro-choice forces introduced nine amendments in an attempt to
delay its passage and soften its effects. But all the amendments
were defeated within five hours, and the legislation was approved
about half an hour later.
   ``It's a big win, it's a big margin, it's great,'' said Rep.
Stephen Freind, the Republican who drafted the bill and guided it
through the House.
   Pro-choice senators said the legislation would trample on
women's rights while setting the stage for another court challenge
to abortion.
   ``It's a shame, a national disgrace,'' said Sen. Vincent Fumo, a
Democrat. The bill would require women to notify their husbands if
they plan to get an abortion; prohibit abortions because of the
fetus' sex; ban abortions after the 24th week of pregnancy, except
in cases where the mother faces death or irreversible harm, and
establish a 24-hour waiting period.
   The proposal also would regulate the medical use of tissue from
aborted fetuses. Doctors would be required to inform a woman of the
likely age of the fetus before performing an abortion and explain
the risks and alternatives.
   The bill was approved just two weeks after voters in New Jersey
and Virginia elected governors who succeeded in winning their races
partly because of their pro-choice positions. Both candidates made
abortion a campaign issue.
   Last month, an attempt by Florida Gov. Bob Martinez to restrict
abortion fell flat when the Legislature rejected a package of bills.
   The Senate debate was suspended less than half an hour after it
began when legislators voted 26-24 to suspend rules and allow
amendments. Republican and Democratic caucuses held private
meetings on the bill.
   Debate resumed two hours later. An amendment to make a technical
change and another to allow some exceptions to a proposed ban on
abortions after the 24th week of pregnancy were the first to be
defeated.
   Other rejected amendments included proposals for a statewide
referendum on the bill, eliminating a requirement that wives notify
husbands before ending a pregnanacy and revising the waiting period
so that women living at least 50 miles from a clinic would have to
make only one trip.
   Had any of the amendments passed, the legislation would have
been returned to the House, which would have had to agree to any
changes.
   At noon, the Capitol rotunda was filled with more than 100
anti-abortion protesters who held a prayer vigil and sang religious
songs. The vigil was organized by members of a home for unwed
mothers.
   The state chapter of the National Organization for Women
delivered petitions to the governor's office with 50,000 signatures
and hand-written letters opposing further restrictions on abortion.
   In a July decision upholding a Missouri law, the Supreme Court
gave states more leeway to restrict abortions. If the Pennsylvania
bill is enacted, it would be first to take advantage of that ruling
by setting tighter controls on abortion.
   Opponents of the bill have described it as unconstitutional.
   Supporters say the bill places reasonable restrictions on
abortions while providing an avenue for further challenges to the
landmark Roe vs. Wade decision that established abortion a
constitutional right in 1973.

   Edouard Manet's ``La Rue Mosnier aux Drapeaux''
sold for $26.4 million Tuesday, a world auction record for the
artist, Christie's auction house said.
   The oil painting depicting a Paris street bedecked with flags

Starr Collins, a spokeswoman for the auction house.
   The previous auction record for a Manet as $11.08 million, set

title, she said.
   Vincent Van Gogh's oil painting ``Le Vieil If,'' or ``The Old
Yew Tree,'' sold for $20.35 million to an anonymous buyer, Collins
said.
   Pablo Picasso's ``Famille de l'arlequin,'' a representation of
the Cirque Medrano acrobats that characterizes the artist's Rose
period, sold for $15.4 million to a U.S. dealer, she said.
   Other highlights included Claude Monet's ``Nympheas,'' an
exploration of the pond at the artist's home at Giverny, which sold
for $11.55 million to an anonymous buyer.
   Constantin Brancusi's ``La Muse en Dormie III,'' a marble
sculpture of a female head in an abstract form, sold for $8.25
million to an Asian dealer.
   Nine artists' records were set at the $232.4 million sale of
Impressionist and modern paintings and sculpture from several
collections including those of Mrs. and Mrs. Paul Mellon and Mr.

   Prince Franz Josef II of
Liechtenstein, head of state of the tiny principality during a half
century that saw it become one of the world's richest nations, has
died at age 83, the government said today.
   He was the world's longest-reigning monarch when he died late
Monday after a long, undisclosed illness and less than a month
after his wife, Princess Gina, died at age 67.
   The prince's poor condition had prevented him from attending her
funeral.
   Franz Josef II was the 12th ruler of the 270-year-old nation,
last remnant of the ``Holy Roman Empire.'' The principality covers
61 square miles of rolling land and rugged mountains between
Switzerland and Austria.

   President Bush, under Democratic pressure to
respond more strongly to the changes in Eastern Europe, is
considering a meeting with allied leaders in Brussels after his
summit next month with Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev, two
well-placed U.S. officials say.
   The aim of a meeting in the NATO capital would be to show
Western unity on the future of Germany and to discuss new political
and military strategy in light of the quickening change that is
enveloping Eastern and Central Europe.
   Bush is under pressure from Democratic leaders in the Senate and
House to respond more energetically to developments in the
communist world.
   Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell of Maine on Monday urged
the president to travel to the Berlin Wall, now breached by
unrestricted travel by East Germans, convene a meeting of the
Western allies and suspend trade restrictions against the Soviet

   The enormous size of the nation's private
pension system is frustrating government watchdogs, who warn that
the retirement savings of millions of working Americans are
vulnerable to fraud and mismanagement.
   The most alarming reports come from the Labor Department's
inspector general's office, which says failure to shore up the laws
and bolster enforcement could result in a taxpayer-funded bailout
dwarfing the recent savings and loan crisis.
   ``There's an insidious and steady siphoning off, which
ultimately affects the employees,'' says Raymond Maria, acting
inspector general for the Labor Department. ``I am convinced there
is substantial fraud and abuse.''
   An Associated Press investigation found that at least one-fourth
of the private pension plans audited by the government are in
violation of the law _ yet the odds of any individual program being
checked are less than one in a hundred.

   Four separate proposals by different branches of the armed

artillery by 16,800 square miles in unconnected areas in Montana,
Idaho, Utah and Nevada.
   The Pentagon says the proposals to add military training to uses

national program in 1974.

   The study raises the possibility that coffee without caffeine

   At a distance or up close, it looks like a
tall Indian tepee. It was designed that way. But it's a church. It
has served its congregation for nearly 40 years. But its day seems
done.
   In this state named for the ``red people,'' the unusual but
aptly shaped structure, built to reflect its natural environment,
may be destined for eradication due to blows by nature itself.
   ``We realize it's a landmark,'' says Connie Golden, the church
secretary. ``We hate to see it go, but we've been frustrated in
maintaining it. The leaking, the flooding, the special problems in
repairs, all kinds of things.
   ``The upkeep was simply phenomenal.''
   The tepee church, once called the wigwam, stands on the city's
northwestern outskirts at 178th and MacArthur Boulevard on the
boundary with suburban Edmond and its outlying oil derricks.
   Formerly a Southern Baptist church, it became non-denominational
about five years ago, called simply the Church at Edmond. Early
this fall, slammed variously by the elements, the congregation
moved out.
   ``New folks like the uniqueness of it and older folks have a lot
of sentiment about it, but they see the impracticalities of
maintaining it,'' says the pastor, the Rev. John Ward.
   ``People who understand the problem, who have lived with that
thing, know why we have to give it up,'' he added in an interview.
``We get mad at it sometimes.''
   Built in the late 1940's, the `tepee'' was designed by the late
innovative architect Bruce Goff, chairman of the University of
Oklahoma School of Architecture from 1947 to 1955 and planner of
several striking buildings.
   It stands about 80 feet tall, height of a four-story building,
its conical shape converging in a peak, the sloping gray-shingled
surface surmounted by 12 russet-painted steel poles (welded
drill-stem pipes from the oil fields).
   They were named for the 12 apostles. Lore has it that the one
named for the betrayer Judas was hardest to erect. Their
convergence at the top is enclosed by 12 triangular windows. Above
rises legs of an open bell tower with no bell.
   The base is wrapped with native rock and sheet metal over a
circular basement for nursery and classrooms. The round sanctuary,
with pews ringed before the raised podium, was a precursor of later
churches-in-the-round.
   Constructed by members themselves, working Saturdays and weekday
evenings over four years from 1947 to 1951, the oddly formed church
was meant to express its natural setting _ Indians, oil fields and
rural touches.
   ``Back then the design was pretty controversial,'' recalled
Ward, who was a young boy in the ``tepee's'' early days, climbing
with other church children among its interior nooks, rocks and
webbed braces.
   ``But the people then evidently went for it,'' he added.
   However, for all its fittingly novel features, it just didn't
function well. The strange peak, with its merging poles and
triangular windows at the apex always leaked some, Ward says,
little or much, depending on the rain's force.
   Oklahoma's extra rains last summer multiplied the trouble,
dousing basement rooms, the runoff infiltrating the septic system.
The building had no insulation, and in the winter couldn't be
warmed above 50 degrees, Ward said.
   ``Utilities were out of sight,'' he added. ``We couldn't afford
to heat it or cool it. In repairs, you're not dealing with the
average building, but always with different sizes and spaces.
There's nothing standard about it.
   ``I'd love to see the building saved, but we just can't do
anything with it.''
   The congregation of about 200 has moved its worship services
into an adjacent metal building, with sanctuary and fellowship
hall, and a concrete-block education building.
   Since word of the tepee's evacuation got out, some historical
conservationists, including some from other countries, have voiced
interest in saving it, but no definite plans for that have emerged.
   Ward said that unless some foundation or group acts to preserve
the ``tepee,'' he anticipated that it would be torn down within a
year, and the space used as a church parking lot.
   Yet some both in the congregation and outside it remain attached
to the ``tepee,'' despite the inroads of nature, sometimes
including birds fluttering about inside.
   ``When you get accustomed to it, the uniqueness of it, people
generally love it,'' Ward said. ``The wider community also is proud
of it and hates to see it go.'' But he added that it's so different
it doesn't work.
   ``It expands and contracts so much,'' he said. ``It's
inefficient in a lot of other ways. There's no big, burning desire
to tear it down, but we don't know what else to do with it.''

   An influential and individualistic Episcopal
Church leader, Bishop William C. Frey of Denver, says he is
resigning his office to become dean of a small, financially poor
new seminary in an abandoned steel town.
   Frey, who wears cowboy boots in the pulpit, says he expects to
begin his new job in the fall of 1990 at the Trinity Episcopal
School for Ministry in Ambridge, Pa.
   Calling it ``the Cinderella of American seminaries,'' Frey said
he decided to make the move ``because of a sense of vocation. I
felt a call.''
   Frey, an evangelical-style, charismatic bishop, terms abortion
homicide but he also has a liberal side, opposing capital
punishment, the nuclear arms race and proliferation of handguns.
   At 55, he still had 17 years to serve as bishop before reaching
the mandatory retirement age of 72. In 1985, he was among four
nominees for the denomination's top office of presiding bishop.

broadened program to deal with Jewish immigration from the Soviet
Union, acknowledging that it will take a ``prodigious effort and
commitment'' by U.S. Jews.
   ``At this historic moment of exodus and reception, we should do
no less,'' said the AJC's executive council in approving the
multipronged program, including help both to those resettling in
America and Israel.

   Americans United for Separation of Church and
State contends a federal district court in Philadelphia erred when
it overturned Pennsylvania's ban on wearing of religious garb in
public school classrooms.
   Concerning a case in which the court upheld the right of Moslem
teacher Alima Dolores Reardon to wear Islamic garb while teaching
in public school, the church-state separationist group said:
   ``A teacher is an agent of the state and as an agent of the
state may not use his or her position to influence the religious
beliefs of the teacher's charges.''

   A Protestant leader says that the ecumenical
movement can regain its place at the center of culture if the
churches put their emphasis on basic faith and serving their people.
   At a 30th anniversary banquet of The Interchurch Center in upper
Manhattan, the Rev. Paul H. Sherry, new president of the United
Church of Christ, told representatives of most major denominations:
   ``As we move to the 21th century as an ecumenical church, we
must remember whose we are. If we do, we will move into the next
century with power.''
   The 19-story center overlooking the Hudson River houses offices
of the National Council of Churches and numerous denominational
boards and agencies.
   The head of the center's board, Ruth Stafford Peale, wife of the
noted Rev. Norman Vincent Peale, recalled that the building's
cornerstone was laid by former President Eisenhower.

<HEAD>Small-Business Survey Shows Economic Growth Surprisingly Strong</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN CUNNIFF</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Analyst</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The outlook for business conditions improved
substantially in the latest quarterly survey of small businesses,
suggesting that economic growth could be surprisingly strong for
the rest of the year.
   The survey found unexpected strength in job creation and an
improvement in the inflation picture during the third quarter, but
only slight improvement in short-term borrowing conditions.
   William C. Dunkelberg, who interprets results for the National
Federation of Independent Business, said responses leave the threat
of recession something that ``at best, is likely to occur only in
the murky 1990 future.''
   Dunkelberg, dean of Temple University's school of business and
management, said the survey revealed more companies now expect
improved economic conditions over the next six months than expect a
deterioration.
   The more confident tone of the report showed up clearly in what
the Federation calls its Small Business Optimism Index, which rose
from 99.8 in the third quarter to 102.1 points in the latest
analysis.
   The index, which uses 1978 as its benchmark (100), incorporates
responses about existing and anticipated business conditions.
   As such, it measures responses about current job openings,
satisfaction with the condition of inventories, changes in net
earnings, plans to hire and make capital outlays, expected business
conditions and expected sales.
   The lowest seasonally adjusted index since its formulation in
1974 was an 81.1 reading in the second quarter of 1980. Its highest
level was reached in the first quarter of 1984 at 108.7.
   The index, which is widely followed because of its sound
forecasting record over the years, relies on detailed, written
responses from close to 2,000 members of the federation. In the
latest survey, 1,797 responses were studied.
   The federation claims over 500,000 member firms, ranging from
extremely small enterprises such as proprietorships to companies
with sales in the hundreds of millions _ small only in relationship
to the very largest firms.
   The community it represents, says Dunkelberg, employs half the
private nonfarm work force and produces about 50 percent of the
nation's gross private product.
   Smaller companies, it is felt by some economic forecasters, are
especially sensitive to changing economic conditions.
   Studying the responses, Dunkelberg said that only 25 percent of
companies in the survey planned to raise prices, a 5-point drop
from the first quarter of 1989, ``a remarkable turnaround in
inflation pressures in the economy.''
   He saw little inflation threat in the strong demand for workers,
saying ``there is still little evidence that compensation is
responding in any substantive way to labor market tightness.''
   While labor costs are rising, he said, the gains aren't
alarming. ``Indeed, gains remain surprisingly modest,'' he said,
while conceding that a higher minimum wage could have a ripple
effect on the wage structure.
   The tightening of labor markets shown by the latest survey was
in contrast to what Dunkelberg said was a period of substantial
weakening since January. He termed the strength unexpected, and
said much of it was in the service sector.
   Little change was found in plans for capital investments. ``All
in all, no excitement, just steady spending,'' he said, but he
indicated that it might begin easing soon.
   That easing, he said, would result from companies waiting to see
just which course the economy is taking. ``So far, the signals
remain mixed, and the economy stays on an even keel.''

   Americans foresee fewer smokers, better schools
and more cash in their wallets in the coming decade, but they
expect pollution, crime and drug abuse to worsen, a national poll
has found.
   On balance, most respondents to the Media General-Associated
Press poll expressed general optimism for the 1990s. About six in
10 expected life for others to improve, and three-quarters saw
their own lives getting better.
   Education was the brightest spot, with 58 percent expecting it
to improve in the next decade. Personal wealth also was a point of
optimism, with 56 percent expecting their family's financial
situation to improve.
   But the poll's 1,071 respondents divided about evenly on whether
the U.S. economy will improve, worsen or remain about the same. And
half expected the federal budget deficit to worsen, while just a
fifth saw it improving.
   The survey found sobering assessments on many other issues. More
than six in 10 expected pollution and crime to worsen, and almost
as many saw more AIDS, homelessness and world hunger as the year
2000 approaches.
   The environment stood out as a chief concern. Twelve percent
expected pollution to be the nation's greatest problem a decade
from now; only drug abuse was named by more, 17 percent.
   Moreover, 65 percent expected pollution to worsen in the next 10
years, and almost half said the warming of the atmosphere because
of pollution, known as the greenhouse effect, could threaten human
survival.
   Pessimism often was greatest among younger respondents, and in
many cases optimism increased with age. Fifty-two percent of those
aged 18-24 expected the United States to become involved in a war
in the 1990s; just 41 percent of their elders shared their fear.
And among the oldest group, over 64 years old, just 27 percent
expected war.
   Similarly, six in 10 in the youngest group expected drug abuse
to worsen and two-thirds of them saw acquired immune deficiency
syndrome as a growing problem, while nearer to half of the older
respondents agreed.
   One of the most widely held expectations overall was for a
Democrat to win the White House, which 72 percent called likely.
Among the least-expected developments: the demise of communism,
considered likely by just 26 percent.
   Other widely expected eventualities were cigarette smokers
shrinking to a tiny minority of the population, which 59 percent
called likely; and much greater restrictions on abortion, expected
by 56 percent.
   The poll found a lowering of some expectations in the past
decade. In a 1979 survey by the Roper Organization, 51 percent
expected the four-day work week to become common in the 1980s; when
the question was repeated in the new poll, just 41 percent held
that view for the 1990s.
   Fewer people expected new energy sources to end dependency on
oil _ 49 percent now, compared with 60 percent in 1979. And more
expected the role of nuclear power to decline _ 45 percent now,
compared with 33 percent 10 years ago.
   More also were dubious that racial and religious discrimination
could largely disappear _ 77 percent said not, compared with 66
percent in 1979. In both polls, nine in 10 doubted that poverty
would be almost eliminated.
   Among other possibilities posed for the 1990s, 37 percent said
it was likely the Republican Party would control Congress; 38
percent expected a woman to be elected president; 42 percent called
it likely U.S. astronauts will reach Mars; and 42 percent expected
cures for cancer and for AIDS.
   The poll, conducted by telephone Sept. 14-24, had a margin of
error of 3 percentage points.

   This Media General-Associated Press poll is
based on telephone interviews Sept. 14-24 with 1,071 adults in the
continental United States. Phone numbers were selected randomly and
interviews were conducted with the adult who had the most recent
birthday, a random phenomenon.
   The results were weighted to adjust for variations in the
sample. The poll has a 3-point margin of error, meaning that 19 of
20 times its findings should be within 3 points of the result if
every adult American were asked the same questions. The error
margin is larger for subgroups.
   There are other sources of potential error in polls, including
the wording and order of questions. These are the questions in this
poll; because of rounding, sums may not total 100:
   1. What do you think will be the most important problem facing
this country 10 years from now? Drugs: 17 percent. Environment: 12

<HEAD>Global Pain, Cosmic Pain, Human Pain</HEAD>
<HEAD>Laserphoto PX3 of Nov. 10</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KIRA L. BILLIK</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>PHILADELPHIA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   She's hip, she's brutally honest, often
bawdy and always witty.
   Poet Maralyn Lois Polak writes about personal pain, but says the
real point of her writing is to reveal ``global pain, cosmic pain,
and human pain.''
   She published her first poem, an ode to Jack Frost, at the age
of 7 in a local newspaper, and has been seriously writing poetry
since she was 15. Since 1974, she's written a weekly celebrity
interview column for The Philadelphia Inquirer.
   Polak, who grew up in Long Branch, N.J., is from a strictly
working-class background.
   ``My father was a high school dropout who became an electrical
engineer,'' she says. ``My parents didn't go to museums or
concerts. They were Jewish and revered the idea of learning _ they
were smart, but not intellectual.''
   When her father took his lunch to work, he carried the New York
Daily News in his box instead of a Thermos.
   ``I learned about sex and life from tabloid newspapers,'' she
says.
   She attended Temple University on a scholarship.
   When she broke into journalism, she faced her first battle with
envy.
   ``Everyone went to Harvard and Yale and Radcliffe, and I
developed a crushing inferiority complex. It was the worst
insecurity I ever had, and I couldn't do a thing about it,'' she
says.
   That feeling passed when her poetry was noticed by a publisher
looking for a poet with working-class roots.
   ``I was cured of my Ivy envy,'' she says. ``I realized that
people who went to great schools weren't necessarily happier or
better educated than I was.''
   Writing about personal pain, or ``hangnails of the soul,'' as
she calls it, is trivial, but writing about human pain is more
important. ``It's not enough to write about what's going on around
you,'' she says.
   Some poets, she says, face problems with the mundaneness of life
and their own self-absorption.
   ``Your material is limited unless you're always listening to the
voices of other people,'' she says.
   The academic world of poetry also bothers her.
   ``Poems have to be accessible and written in the language of the
people,'' she says. ``I don't like academic anything. I want my
work to be multi-layered, but direct and eloquent, not
pretentious.''
   Her poems deal with politics, injustice, sex and relationships,
but she doesn't consciously write about those issues. ``One of the
reasons I write is to give voice to the voiceless, to express the
unspeakable. Sometimes you write for yourself, sometimes you write
about the larger human condition.''
   Polak's inner struggles also manifest themselves in her writing.
``I struggle with the unequal balance of power between people,''
she says. ``That sums up everything _ men and women, countries,
governments.''
   Her concerns are also personal.
   ``I worry about `why didn't that man call me back?''' She
laughs. But when her father was left alone at the age of 82 after
her mother died, and a relative contracted AIDS, her concerns
changed.
   ``I worry about what will happen to people with AIDS, to old
people,'' she says. ``I worry about what it means to be a good
daughter and a good human being, about where does one person's
struggle end and another person's begin, about the limits of
responsibility.''
   She rages that American society is unaware of important issues.
``We're asleep in America. The middle class has conquered. We're
numb, we're being entertained, and horrible things are happening
everywhere,'' she says.
   Journalism reflects that apathy, with the emphasis the media
place on lifestyle stories, she says.
   ``That's how our lives have become,'' she says. ``Those are
non-stories about non-issues. They're about non-people going to
non-events and having non-thoughts.''
   Poetry, however, should wake people up, she says.
   ``I want a poem to come up to you, grab you by the throat, put a
gun to your head and say, `Pay attention to me.' If people become
safe and smug, we have to shake 'em up a little.''
   Such works as ``The Death Squad in Philadelphia,'' which
compares a mythical death squad similar to those in Latin American
countries existing in Philadelphia, and ``A Tastefully Clean Poem
for the Ayatollah Jesse Helms,'' a work against censorship that
literally ``blanks'' out its obscene words but is still obscene,
reflect her more jarring poems.
   Her poetry and her journalism have to be kept separate, she
says. ``The two do fertilize and enrich each other. I'm better as a
poet because of my zest for detail, and my writing as a journalist
is more vibrant because of my ability to take risks with words.''
   The rewards she gains from both also differ.
   ``The reward of poetry is the poem. The reward of journalism is
being part of people's daily lives.''

<HEAD>Mexican Agriculture in Deep Crisis</HEAD>
<HEAD>LaserPhoto planned</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CHRIS ANGELO</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MAZATEPEC, Mexico (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   From small rice farms in Mazatepec to
vast fields in fertile valleys, Mexican agriculture is withering in
the winds of economic crisis.
   ``The crisis is very real and it's a very serious crisis,'' said
David Barkin, an agricultural economist with the Ecodevelopment
Center in Mexico City.
   ``It is affecting all the basic food producers in this country.
It isn't profitable.''
   That is acutely evident to Gonzalo Pineda Toledo, who grows rice
on 3.7 acres in Mazatepec, 45 miles south of Mexico City. To get
through the last growing season he had to borrow the equivalent of
$469 and still wound up with a $142 loss on his crop.
   A farm union leader said such losses or lean profits have
encouraged some farmers to plant more profitable, but illegal,
marijuana and opium poppies.
   One of the few bright spots, however, has been exports, mostly
of tomatoes, other vegetables and fruits to the United States,
which amounted to about $2.4 billion in 1988.
   To broaden that market, the Mexican government has asked the
United States to lower barriers to a range of agricultural products
from avocadoes to watermelons despite possible objections from U.S.
producers.
   After powering the country's growth for 20 years, agriculture
overall faded into the shadow of industrialization and urbanization
in the mid-1960s. The population doubled, to 85 million today, but
food production hasn't kept up. To avoid shortages, more grains,
meat and other foods are imported.
   City dwellers eat tortillas made from U.S. yellow corn and
Mexico is the world's largest importer of powdered milk.
   The decline has worsened in the last seven years. Austerity
imposed to help service Mexico's $107 billion foreign debt and an
even larger domestic debt has dried up investment.
   ``Everyone has suffered. Agriculture has suffered more,'' said
Kenneth Shwedel, an agricultural economist and regional director in
Mexico City for the American Soybean Association.
   Dam and irrigation-system construction has stalled. Cracks and
pumps aren't repaired. Financing for research to improve crops,
livestock and technology has dwindled, along with farm credit.
   Crop prices have been held within anti-inflation guidelines to
calm urban consumers, while interest rates and prices of
fertilizer, insecticides and equipment have ballooned. The interest
on rice-farmer Pineda Toledo's $469 loan was $391 and was a key
factor in his loss.
   Far to the northwest in the rich Yaqui Valley, Bernabe Arana
Rodriguez, who manages several agro-industrial cooperatives, says
many soybean farmers didn't plant this year because of low farm
prices.
   ``I read what the president said, that prices weren't going up,
and costs are going up, so I didn't want to plant,'' he said.
   His 70 acres lay idle.
   The immediate financial problems overlie deeper ones _ the
uncertainty of land tenure under Mexico's agrarian reform system
and corruption and bureaucratic snarls in everything from who gets
the land to water rights, credit and marketing.
   ``In the Mexican countryside we are facing the greatest
challenge of economic modernization,'' President Carlos Salinas de
Gortari said in his state of the nation address Nov. 1.
   In 1988, crop production shrank 4.5 percent, the third
consecutive year or reduced or flat production, according to the
Bank of Mexico. This year is expected to be no better, analysts
say. The figure contrasts with an average annual growth rate of 6.1
percent from 1940 to 1960.
   Food imports, which amounted to 8.5 million tons last year, are
expected to reach 9.5 million tons this year and again in 1990;
production of basic grains is expected to be around 22 million tons.
   Analysts put the cost of imports at $2.5 billion to $3.5 billion
in long-term, low interest loans, more than the government will
save in its debt reduction agreement with foreign banks.
   As for the farmer, ``Two serious things are happening,'' said
Francisco Javier Gil, a leader of the National Union of Regional
Autonomous Campesino Organizations. ``They are leaving land
unplanted and some are planting illegal drugs. This is profitable.''
   Another campesino leader said that in the Pacific coast state of
Guerrero, 2.5 acres of corn can bring in $400 for five months'
work, while one-hundredth of that area planted in marijuana
produces $3,000 to $4,000. Planted in opium poppies it would bring
$20,000.
   Seventy percent of Mexico's cultivated land is in ejidos,
farmland given to groups of peasants to work and pass on to their
children. Selling it is illegal. So is renting, although it is
common.
   Critics of the ejido system blame it for low production, saying
that the land has been broken up into mini-plots and that private
land ownership offers more incentives and results in more
investment as well as reduced corruption.
   Government officials say Salinas' policy of selling publicly
held companies wont't extend to the ejido system, a fundamental
reform of the 1910-21 Mexican Revolution. But they have said
mini-plots should be avoided.
   Defenders of the system say that with good land and inputs,
ejidos produce as well as private holdings.
   ``The disappearance of the ejido would lead to a reconcentration
of land and an increase in unemployment, migration to the cities
and to the United States,'' said agricultural economist Jose Luis
Calva.

<DATELINE>KABUL, Afghanistan (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   People in Kabul got a taste recently
of what winter might bring this year and they didn't like it.
   Moslem guerrillas fighting the government closed the main road
to the Soviet Union for 10 days, sending food and fuel prices up
almost 50 percent in the capital. Sugar and cooking oil disappeared
from the markets. Cars vanished from the streets.
   On the 10th day, government forces reopened the Salang highway
and trucks rolled in with flour and gasoline.
   But the lesson was not lost on what most likely in store for the
cold, snowy months ahead.
   ``It's going to be a tough time, worse than last year,'' said
Mohammad Hakim, president of the Afghanistan Chamber of Commerce.
   Ross Mountain, head of the United Nations Development Program in
Kabul, said if the war goes on poor people could starve.
   Last winter a bustling black market blossomed around the Soviet
military. Troops sold fuel and flour to Afghans and some Afghans
made small fortunes trafficking in Soviet arms, bought from the
soldiers eager for foreign currency.
   Still, many people spent their days cold and hungry in a city
blanketed in snow.
   In February, the Soviet troops went home, and with them went an
important source of goods and cash.
   Now despite a Soviet aid program that in six months has sent
266,543 metric tons of goods overland and thousands more by air,
the economy is getting worse as winter closes in.
   Prices are already higher than they were in February, a bad sign
since food costs in Afghanistan are traditionally lower in autumn
when it is harvested. A 15-pound sack of flour has almost doubled
to the equivalent of $4 and by the end of winter, merchants
estimate, it could hit $10, which is more than many people earn in
a month.
   Sugar, another staple in the Afghan diet, also has skyrocketed
to more than $1 a pound. Tea, the third most important item, has
tripled in price.
   Women defy the 10 p.m.-3 a.m. curfew and spend nights outside
bakeries to ensure a loaf or two of bread in the morning.
   ``I am poor,'' said one elderly woman as she fixed her straw
mattress outside one store as the curfew approached. ``My husband
and I need to eat and there is no other way to get bread.''
   Despite the inflated prices, salaries remain low.
   The average monthly wage hovers between $5 and $12.50.
   For many in Kabul, desperation has become a way of life.
   Omari Mir Ahmad runs a photo shop in a small house with mud
walls in the old city. His whole family works in the shop and they
make about $45 a month.
   Because they run a private bsiness, the family receives no
government assistance.
   ``I've got seven mouths to feed,'' Ahmad said, motioning around
his room, suddenly darkened by one of Kabul's frequent blackouts.
``How will I get by?''
   At Kabul University, a student wearing florescent pink lipstick
and bright white shoes told of her two brothers who were killed by
a rocket as they flew their kites.
   ``Tell the United States and Russia to send two big bombs to
blow us up all at once,'' she said. ``We are sick of dying in bits
and bits and pieces. Let us die together.''
   Since rocket attacks were stepped up in June, Zahir Tanin, a
prominent editor, has barely allowed his children out of the house.
So far about 400 people have been killed.
   ``When I look into their eyes, it is difficult for me to bear
it,'' he said. ``We are losing a generation. This is the sorrow of
Afghanistan.''
   If there is hope here, perhaps it resides in the traditional
center of life _ the bazaar.
   There, men with brown, weathered faces, gray beards, green eyes
and turbans on their heads hawk dried yogurt, grapes and succulent
melons.
   Behind a row of buildings lies the grain market. In one corner
sits Mohammad Nair, a grizzled merchant.
   ``The governmnt is coming to us on its knees,'' he said. ``They
say they need our help. Only the bazaar will feed the people.
Communism has failed.''
   In the past few months, the government has returned an
unprecedented amount of economic power to the market in an effort
to bring food to Afghanistan. It ended a monopoly on the
transportation of fuel and sugar, relaxed already feeble currency
trading regulations and dropped import restrictions and tariffs.
   Anything can be bought in Kabul by those with money to pay for
them: portable tape players from Japan, Italian leather goods,
Soviet and Iranian caviar, expensive French perfumes and tea from
China. Many goods are re-exported through the black market to
Pakistan, India and Iran, which have tighter import controls.
   In addition, the government has gone so far as to assure
traffickers who bring stolen goods to market that they should not
fear prosecution.
   ``Since all this is aimed at peaceful activity, then we support
it,'' said Mayor Abdul Hakim Misaq of Kabul. ``It is better than
rockets.''
   But, then, as he spoke the first heavy snows had settled on the
mountains ringing his city.

<HEAD>Mother of 10 Waits Alone on Death Row in South Africa</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SAHM VENTER</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>CAPE TOWN, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Were it not for one violent day
in 1985, Evelina de Bruin would be like countless other black South
African women: an illiterate maid in her 50s, raised in a isolated
farming district, mother of 10.
   Today, she is the only woman on Death Row _ alone, confused and
ill. Her prison cell in Pretoria is the farthest she's ever been
from home.
   ``She cannot eat, she can't sleep,'' said her lawyer, Andrea
Durbach of Cape Town. ``It's a very dramatic thing to say, but I
used to think to myself that she's just going to die of a broken
heart.''
   Mrs. de Bruin and 13 men were sentenced to death in May for the
mob killing in November 1985 of a black policeman, Lucas Sethwala,
in Paballelo, the black section of the remote northwestern town of
Upington.
   Twenty-six people were tried for the killing, and four men were
found to have physically contributed to the death of Sethwala, who
was chased from his home, stoned, beaten and set afire.
   In addition to those four, Mrs. de Bruin and nine others were
convicted of murder under the doctrine of ``common purpose,'' which
holds them responsible because they were part of the crowd that
sought to kill Sethwala.
   Sethwala's death occurred at a time of nationwide black unrest.
Hours before he was slain several thousand blacks gathered at a
soccer field in Paballelo to protest rent increases and other
grievances.
   After police dispersed the crowd with tear gas, about 300 people
re-grouped around Sethwala's home and threw stones to force him
outside.
   Militant blacks have frequently attacked black policemen,
accusing them of collaborating with the government and its
apartheid policies.
   Mrs. de Bruin and her common-law husband, who also has been
sentenced to death, were identified as having thrown stones at
Sethwala's house. According to the state's evidence, she allegedly
yelled: ``The dog is in the house. Bring him out and burn him
alive.''
   Mrs. de Bruin testified during the trial that she and her
husband went back to their own house after the protest meeting was
broken up and were not present at Sethwala's home.
   Mrs. de Bruin, who had no previous criminal record and worked
for the same white family for 30 years, has little understanding of
what is happening to her, Ms. Durbach said.
   Mrs. de Bruin suffers from arthritis, heart disease and has high
blood pressure, the lawyer said. She does not know in what city her
prison is and thinks she's been imprisoned for at least a year,
when in fact it has been six months.
   She sees her husband for 30 minutes, once a month. They are
separated by a window and communicate through microphones. Only
three of her 10 children have been able to visit her, Ms. Durbach
said.
   Because she cannot read and is too ill to exercise, Mrs. de
Bruin does little but listen to government-run radio that is piped
into her cell, said Ms. Durbach, who visits her every three weeks.
   She has been treated well by the prison staff and has developed
a good relationship with one of the guards, Ms. Durbach added.
   A judge ruled in September that the 14 people sentenced to death
could appeal their sentences, but a bail request for Mrs. de Bruin
was turned down.
   Two psychologists testified at her bail application that she had
suffered mental and physical deterioration, including memory loss,
since her imprisonment.
   Ms. Durbach said no date has been set for the appeal, but she
hopes it could be early next year.
   In a similar mob killing, the Appeal Court, the country's
highest court, last year upheld under the ``common purpose''
doctrine the death sentence of six blacks known as the
``Sharpeville Six.''
   However, after a storm of domestic and international protest,
then-President P.W. Botha commuted their death sentences to lengthy
prison terms.
   The last woman to be executed in South Africa was Sandra Smith,
25, who was of mixed race. She was hanged in June after being
convicted of joining her boyfriend in the brutal knife murder of a
teen-ager.
   More than 50 people, mostly black, have been executed so far
this year, and more than 100 were hanged in each of the previous
three years.
   Botha and his successor, F.W. de Klerk, have commuted 54 death
sentences this year.

<HEAD>Video Collection Documents Christian Resistance to Hitler</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID REED</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LYNCHBURG, Va. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Emy Bonhoeffer remembers everything about
the moment in 1945 when she realized her husband, Klaus, would die
for his involvement in the Christian resistance to Adolf Hitler's
fascist regime and his extermination of Jews.
   Among 36 people interviewed for a video archive in Lynchburg,
she said she was sitting with her husband in the ruins of their
bombed house in Munich when she exhaled a puff of cigarette smoke,
turned to Klaus and asked for the first time: ``How will it be when
you are arrested?''
   Her husband's words, as she recounts, were: ``It will be like a
lion passed through and devoured myself and all that I have.''
   Klaus Bonhoeffer, a member of the ``Confessing Church'' that was
set up in the crisis by church leaders to resist Nazism, told her
she could do nothing to prevent his demise.
   She related, ``He said, `Perhaps you can preserve your life and
our children, and, if you can, let them know that their father did
not do nothing.'''
   A few months later, Bonhoeffer and his brother, Dietrich
Bonhoeffer, the renowned theologian and Lutheran minister, were led
into the rubble outside a prison and executed on Hitler's personal
orders.
   James Patrick Kelley, professor of religious studies at
Lynchburg College, spent four years seeking and interviewing
Germans or their relatives who were involved in the Christian
resistance to Hitler, a generally unknown voice in the wilderness
of inaction against or collaboration with the Nazis.
   The collection he has established, 200 hours of videotape
available by mail for researchers and historians, was dedicated
recently at the college. Elie Wiesel, a Jewish survivor of the
Auschwitz death camp, termed the Christian resisters to Hitler
``righteous Gentiles.''
   Kelley's project was financed by Seventh Street Christian Church
in Richmond, Va.
   The only other videotape archives in the United States on the
subject of Nazi Germany is at Yale University, where interviews of
1,400 Holocaust survivors and witnesses to the atrocities against
Jews are maintained, said Kelley and Joanne Rudof, project manager
of the Yale collection.
   Kelley, who received his master's degree and doctorate at Yale,
said there were two questions for which he sought explanations:
Where were the Christians during Hitler's rise to power? Why did
they not prevent the horror of the Holocaust?
   ``It's important for people to know there was early resistance
to the Hitler regime and he's documenting this,'' Rudof said of
Kelley.
   On Kelley's efforts to explain why most Christians turned their
backs on the Jews while a few helped them, Rudof said: ``It's such
an unresolved question. There is still a great bitterness on behalf
of many Jews who ask, `Why didn't they help us more?' And there are
some Jews who praise the help given to them by Christians.''
   Kelley said that at one crucial point in 1934 when Hitler had
not yet consolidated his power, 45 percent of the clergy in Germany
were aligned with the Confessing Church, organized specifically to
oppose his racist regime replete with anti-Semitic policies.
   No other group of professionals followed the example of the
Confessing Church and publicly opposed Hitler, be it lawyers who
could have decried the arbitrary denial of rights to Jews or
scientists who could have spoken out against the dismissal of
Jewish colleagues, Kelley said.
   Kelley said if there had been more public opposition, Hitler's
policies could have been modified and the Holocaust, the systematic
extermination of 6 million Jews that began in 1941, might have been
prevented. In addition to the Jews, an estimated 5 million other
people died or were killed in the camps, including people branded
as liberals or opponents to fascism, scholars and homosexuals.
   But the movement faded and the number of Christians involved in
the resistance dwindled. Rudof said some pastors went so far as to
join Hitler's secret police.
   Why did so many Christians remain silent? ``Different answers
were given by almost everyone,'' Kelley said. ``They said some were
afraid. Some ignored the realities behind the propaganda. Some
people were preoccupied with personal affairs.''
   The most eloquent answer, Kelley said, came from Renate Bethge,
the daughter of an executed Christian resister and neice of
Dietrich Bonhoeffer.
   ``She said, `When people know enough to know if they learn more
it will require some risk ... then it is surprising how little
people want to learn.'''
   Kelley said he does not want to portray the Christian members of
the resistance as heroes. ``They failed to prevent the Holocaust,
World War II and the destruction of Germany. At the same time it
should be remembered that they tried to prevent those kind of
things. They should not be forgotten.''
   James Smylie, a professor of church history at Union Theological
Seminary in Richmond, said the remaining Christian resisters are
rapidly dying.
   ``Kelley gave 36 persons still alive an opportunity to talk,
live on camera, about their experiences in those excruciating
years,'' Smylie said. ``Their reflections are now part of the
record, which will assist us in reassessing this past and
understanding our own responsibilities today.''

No city in the world is host to more foreign diplomats than New York City,
a metropolis not noted for its hospitality. Many are immune from laws local
citizens must obey, some don't speak English. Disputes are inevitable,
sometimes settled at gunpoint. Middle of day or middle of night, the adjudicator
of disputes is a woman of infinite patience, Gillian Sorensen.    ___</HEAD>

   Mayor Ed Koch, told that Mikhail Gorbachev and
his wife, Raisa, were coming for a visit, said: ``Great. Invite
them to dinner. I'll take them to my favorite Chinese restaurant.''
   While the reaction says something of the mayor's natural
exuberance, it also says a great deal of this polyglot city that is
host to the world's largest diplomatic corps, some 40,000 men,
women and children from widely divergent cultures. They staff 159
missions to the United Nations and 87 consulates.
   If it's not easy living with 8 million New Yorkers, it's no
piece of cake for the New Yorkers either.
   Many of these guests live within the sometime shelter of
diplomatic immunity. Their various embassies are considered foreign
territory, immune from the New York police force, even city
inspectors, as is the United Nations itself. And their 1,000 cars
have special areas to park, one of their privileges, which doesn't
stop them from parking illegally almost anywhere they choose.
   Last year, 65,000 parking violations were issued to cars with
diplomatic plates, down from 154,000 a decade earlier, an
indication of better cooperation.
   The Vienna conventions do specify that the diplomats should
respect the laws of the host country. So diplomatic vehicles can be
towed to the city pound if they threaten the health and safety, but
unlike everyday New Yorkers, the erring diplomat can retrieve his
car without cost in most circumstances.
   The city concedes there is not enough diplomatic parking space.
Fifty-five missions and consulates don't have any at all. But it is
the one battlefield where the host New Yorkers and their guests
cross bayonets.
   Not long ago, the Mexican ambassador pulled up to his designated
diplomatic parking spot in front of his residence just as a New
Yorker was backing into it. The ambassador asked him to move and he
wouldn't. It heated up from there. Finally the ambassador pulled a
gun and won back his parking place.
   The person who adjudicates, mediates, calms the angry waters, is
Gillian Martin Sorensen, head of the city's Commission for the
United Nations and Consular Corps. She is the wife of Ted Sorensen,
a New York attorney who served in President John F. Kennedy's White
House.
   Their home phone rings at all hours of the night. The diplomatic
911 number seems to be ``Call Gillian.''
   ``Not that it happens every night, because it doesn't,'' Ms.
Sorensen says. ``But it still makes me jump because I know if
they're calling at that hour, it's important. They know someone
will respond.''
   It can be anything from a bomb threat to a diplomatic suicide or
a runaway child or a heart attack. ``The daughter of the Indian
ambassador died the other day of an asthma attack in a matter of
minutes,'' she says.
   ``If it's a towed car, we let it wait until morning.''
   For her, it is an obvious labor of love. ``I learned how deeply
diplomats care about their work,'' she says. ``I learned how the
image of diplomats as high-living, socializing, striped-pants types
is far from the truth.''
   As commissioner, she is a sometimes housemother to people who
are far from home, in an alien environment, vulnerable.
   They have their share of stolen cars, stolen car radios, even
stolen license plates. A car belonging to Bangladesh was hijacked
at knife point in October. Ms. Sorensen points out that the
red-white-and-blue diplomatic plates make them highly visible.
   To counteract this, one diplomat put an ``I love New York,''
sticker on his bumper. So she made them available to any embassy or
consulate that wanted them. China, Haiti, India, Jordan, the Holy
See and Hungary were among the first to order. Hundreds went out.
   New York is not an easy environment.
   During the telephone strike, there were some 80 calls from
diplomats who couldn't get their phones installed and were out of
communication with their home governments.
   Ms. Sorensen and her staff of 14 ``were able on a selective and
emergency basis to get their phones hooked up.''
   Then there was the time a water main burst and flooded the
basement of the Bulgarian Embassy where they keep important files.
The water department responded quickly.
   ``Another time, the Chinese Consulate in Manhattan called in
consternation,'' Ms. Sorensen remembers. ``They looked out their
windows and to their shock there were flaming cars speeding by.''
   It turned out to be a movie crew filming a chase scene. The crew
had a permit, but nobody had notified the Chinese. ``World War III
is not breaking out,'' she reassured them.
   Part of her staff's job is to cut through municipal red tape,
provide advice on everything from leases to insurance to child care
to provisions for the handicapped.

   Over time, there have been a sprinkling of minor crimes, an
occasional shoplifting, a few assaults, usually involving teen-age
sons of diplomats. But Ms. Sorensen insists that as a group the
diplomatic corps is responsible, law-abiding.
   There is a curious pattern in the parking violations, which are
tracked by computer.
   ``We have a handful who tend to be chronic,'' Ms. Sorensen says.
``And then I discovered from friends in London that the worst
chronic offenders here are by nationality the worst chronic
offenders there.''
   It often reflects the attitude toward the law they have at home.
When a new ambassador comes in and cracks down, making them pay for
their own parking tickets, even when they are not required to pay
under international law, the parking violations clear up quickly.
   Diplomatic immunity is a sometimes thing. Heads of mission and
their immediate family generally are immune from all local laws.
But as one's grade in post descends, one's immunity erodes. While
all of the diplomatic corps are immune to most parking violations,
any violation, including those of parking that involve the health
and safety of the populace, and that includes moving violations,
are not covered. So parking in front of a hydrant or speeding are
not in the immunity field except for top diplomats.
   Even if they didn't have to confront local or state law, they
would have to face various degrees of censure from their home
states and the United Nations. For a while, debt was a large
problem, so bad that some New York landlords wouldn't rent to
diplomatic missions. Probably the premier case involved Zaire,
which is not a poor country.
   When Zairian President Mobutu Sese Seko came to New York on a
courtesy visit, Mayor Koch received him. After some polite
conversation, the head of state asked Ms. Sorensen about Zaire's
debt in New York. She told him that his nation owed more than
$150,000 in rent and other bills.
   ``The president was furious and berated his ambassador and his
foreign minister who were there,'' she recalls. ``When he heard the
sum involved he said, `You come with us when we leave here.' So I
took a City Hall colleague with me and we went to the president's
hotel. Then and there, from suitcases, they literally paid us in
cash, bundles of cash.''
   Then there are the political demonstrations on the streets.
   ``We've had occasions when we've had two opposing views, the pro
on this side of the street and the con on that side of the
street,'' Ms. Sorensen says.
   New York gives wide latitude to demonstrators, but the police
firmly enforce the limits, broad as they are.
   ``Sometimes it bothers the neighbors and sometimes it bothers
the people in the mission or consulate being picketed,'' Ms.
Sorensen says. ``We let it be a lesson in democracy, a lesson in
free speech. I think that is not a bad lesson. They know they are
in New York in the United States of America. They know what the
rules and regulations are, that people can carry any flag they
like, and they can say anything, even outrageous things.
   ``They may not like it and it may not be allowed at home, but
those are the rules we go by, so they accept it.''
   It's not the only lesson New York teaches the foreign diplomat.
   ``It's heartwarming to me to see that the foreigner's attitude
and understanding toward this city and toward democratic society
does change with time,'' she says. ``They arrive in New York
somewhat intimidated and afraid of the city. Our reputation is kind
of frightening. When they leave I find a lot of them love New York.
They love the options. They love the rhythm. They love the
diversity and the mix. They love the freedoms that we take for
granted. And they leave with regret.''
   Ms. Sorensen says the New York experience stays with them. ``We
know that service in New York is an essential step on the career
ladder of diplomats. And the younger the country, the younger the
diplomat, the more true it is. And we'll see them again, either as
ambassador or minister or, in some cases, head of government.''
   In her dozen years tending to diplomats, Ms. Sorensen has seen
everything from a terrorist assassination to a head of government
who wanted to hire a chef at the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel and take him
home with him because he liked his pancakes.
   The Gorbachev visit on Dec.6, 1988, marked the end of frosty and
somewhat formal relations with the Soviet Union.
   ``Not only was the Soviet Union changing its historic role and
becoming active and engaged and constructive in the U.N., but also
the citizens of New York, with construction workers hanging out a
huge sign that said, `Hard Hats Welcome Gorby.' It was proof that
you should never give up, that things can change, and that
diplomacy is not just a high-fallutin term but a vehicle for that
change.''
   A footnote to the Gorbachev's quick trip: It took 5,000 extra
police to provide security and traffic control, for which the city
was reimbursed $2.5 million.
   When the Gorbachevs had to cut short the visit on Dec. 8 because
of the Armenian earthquake, it was a great disappointment to a
fourth-grade class where Raisa Gorbachev was to visit. The
8-year-olds were all dressed up, their welcome sign was up and the
refreshments were ready. ``This is where it goes beyond diplomacy
to touch real people and change a view of another power, no longer
an evil empire, but somebody's country, a people to know and
understand and to learn about,'' Ms. Sorensen says.
   To her, the whole experience has been extraordinary.
   And sometimes touching. When the Sultan of Brunei arrived to
celebrate his country's joining the United Nations, he asked what
the city needed. He wanted to present a little gift.
   Of the hundreds of needs in New York, Ms. Sorensen named a few.
When the Sultan called on the mayor, ``he was about as shy as
anyone I've ever seen. You could hardly hear him. He almost spoke
in a whisper, so there was a slightly awkward exchange with the
mayor. Then he reached into his pocket and took out his little
gift. It was a check for $500,000 made out to `Meals On Wheels.'''

Jerusalem, was once a symbol of Arab-Jewish coexistence.
   Today, after almost two years of the Palestinian uprising, the
Arab and Jewish communities are divided by ``borders of the heart''
that are difficult to cross, even for the sake of simple dialogue.
   On many recent nights, residents on both sides have been kept
awake by the sounds of gunfire, banging on doors and loudspeaker
announcements as police hunt for Palestinian youths who set fire to
Israeli cars or hurled firebombs at patrols.
   Abd Abu Diab, a leading figure in the Arab sector of Abu Tor,
one of the few areas of Jerusalem where Jews and Arabs live next to
each other, says one of the successes of the intefadeh, or
uprising, has been defining the borders for a proposed Palestinian
state, showing Israelis where they are welcome and where they are
not.
   ``I have Jewish friends at work, but I don't remember anyone
coming here or me going to their homes,'' says Diab, an official of
the Arab-run electric company in east Jerusalem. ``I ask myself
why? The answer is that there is a border in the heart. The Jews
feel like outsiders here.''
   But the violence that has frightened Jews from visiting Arab
areas has made dialogue that much more difficult, not only for the
9,000 Arabs and 2,000 Jews in Abu Tor, but for Palestinians and
Israelis as a whole.
   One of those scared away is Maya Tavori, a gray-haired Jewish
lawyer who lives with her husband, Oded, an engineer, in a spacious
second-floor apartment on the dividing line between the two sectors.
   ``I used to go down to the village and drink coffee and shop.
Now, I don't do it any more because it's dangerous. The police told
me not to,'' she says.
   A supporter of Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir's right-wing Likud
Bloc, she says tough measures used against her Arab neighbors were
upsetting but necessary. These included a four-day curfew during
which televisions, radios, videocassette recorders and other items
were seized by revenue agents in lieu of unpaid taxes.
   ``It's nice to talk beautifully, but we have to take a stand and
take care of our people,'' she says. ``The Arabs are trying to show
us they will not let us live in peace.''
   Mrs. Tavori, who heads a nearby community center, says that
after several incidents of stone- and bottle-throwing the center's
basketball court and playground were put off limits to Arabs.
   The Jewish sector, located at the top of a hill, is modern and
prosperous with parks, gardens and playgrounds.
   The only visible sign of insecurity is the unusual number of
German shepherds, Salukis and other guard dogs.
   The Arab area is noticeably less well-off. It lacks street
lighting, some roads are unpaved, garbage goes uncollected, and
there are no playgrounds or parks. There are also frequent patrols
of paramilitary police carrying assault rifles. Walls are covered
with anti-Israeli slogans.
   Ahmed Abu Saloum, the father of seven children ranging in age
from 6 months to 13 years, showed a reporter eight holes in his
front windows that he said were made by rubber bullets.

   ``Where can we hide?'' he asks, noting that the windows do not
have shutters to protect his family from stray bullets.
   Abu Saloum, a lean, intense man in his 30s, lost his radio,
color TV, videocassette player, electric fan and typewriter during
the recent curfew. The items were seized in lieu of taxes he had
refused to pay as part of a civil disobedience campaign.
   Soon after he spoke, an Israeli police van with windows screened
to protect against stone-throwing arrived on Naomi Street outside
with heavily armed police walking on either side.
   They rousted a group of teen-agers and ordered them to clear the
street of large stones apparently put up as a barricade. A reporter
saw one policeman slap an Arab teen-ager in the back of the head,
while another officer kicked a second youth.
   ``I think it is difficult to make the children understand that
we can make peace,'' says Abu Saloum, a grocer with a passion for
amateur theater. ``They see violence and get radical ideas.''
   Nisrin, his green-eyed 13-year-old daughter, says Israeli youths
in Abu Tor have become openly contemptuous. She does not go into
the Jewish area alone.
   ``They think they're superior,'' she says, adding: ``We don't
want to improve relations. We want a state.''
   Eden Green, a curly haired 17-year-old, attended three
Palestinian-Israeli encounter groups arranged by her mother, Judith.
   She says Palestinian demands seem unrealistic and extreme,
particularly those espoused by Moslem fundamentalists who argue
that Jews should live as a protected minority in an Islamic state.
   ``But I think it's important to get to know these people. If
everyone got to know the Palestinians as people, it would be harder
to use violence against them,'' she says.
   Mrs. Tavori said firebombs and other violence have destroyed the
feelings of tolerance and coexistence that used to prevail in Abu
Tor.
   ``Look and see how beautiful it is. It's been spoiled,'' she
says, gesturing from her balcony at the panoramic view that
stretches from the landmark golden cap of the Dome of the Rock
mosque in the Old City to the Judean hills and the Dead Sea beyond.
   Mrs. Tavori says she has started a diary to sort out her
confused and often conflicting reactions to her Arab neighbors
during the uprising that began in December 1987 and has taken the
lives of more than 590 Arabs and 40 Israelis.
   She recalls, for example, walking to an Arab bakery recently for
sweet knafy cake, a favorite treat before the uprising. Both she
and the owner felt uneasy.
   ``We were such good friends. But we didn't even smile at each
other,'' she says, reading from the diary.
   When she got home, she heard on the radio that an Israeli woman
and her two children burned to death on a bus in the West Bank.
``The cake stuck in my throat, and I was sorry I went.''
   But then, walking alone one day she noticed she was being
followed by an Arab man. ``He walked more quickly and I thought,
`Am I supposed to be afraid?' Then he came up and gave a flower and
said, `to a beautiful woman, a beautiful flower.'
   ``When I tell people the story, they don't believe it. Everyone
thinks I dreamed it.''

   What do the world's rapidly receding rain
forests and other endangered ecological climes have to do with New
York City? Or Atlanta, for that matter? Or San Antonio? Or Rock
Island, Ill.?
   All of those cities and many others either have or are planning
a plant conservatory, a kind of sophisticated greenhouse where they
can nurture specimens of the world's endangered plant life, much as
zoos protect some endangered animal species.
   Evie White came all the way to New York where by luck she got a
lead on 18 acres of land back home in Rock Island on which to build
the plant conservatory she has been dreaming of for years.
   Mrs. White, and her husband, Charles, a retired schoolteacher,
recently attended a two-day workshop, ``Conservatories of the 21st
Century,'' at the Brooklyn Botanical Garden. Experts attended from
all over the country. For the Whites it was a wellspring of
knowledge.
   Most conservatories are the crown jewel of a botanical garden.
Sometimes they are called ``the Rembrandt in the museum.''
   In the garden, landscape architects and horticulturists do the
best they can with the existing climate. In the conservatory, where
heating and cooling systems may be computer controlled,
horticulturists can preserve rare plants, plants that grow tens of
thousands of miles away, plants from the other side of the equator,
plants that people in a town would never see if it weren't for the
controlled climates the conservatories provide.
   The concept dates back at least to Roman times.
   But in 1989, Rock Island, a town of 40,000, yet part of the Quad
City area on the Mississippi River with a populace of 250,000, has
decided it wants a conservatory.
   So, it seems, have a lot of others.
   It may be the growth industry of culture as conservatories, and
dreams of glass houses for plants, sprout across the country. More
than $150 million is being spent already.
   Experts, such as Joe Kerwin of the New York Botanical Gardens in
the Bronx, a 240-acre complex with a beautiful turn-of-the-century
Victorian conservatory, say the boom partially reflects an
ecology-conscious nation.
   ``You turn on any news show and you will see a segment on how
the rain forests are disappearing,'' Kerwin says. ``Everyone is now
aware of a problem that few knew little about just a few years
ago.''
   Experts tell us that rain forests are disappearing at the rate
of an acre a second and that the earth is losing three plant
species an hour, perhaps taking with them great medicinal or
economic secrets.
   But Kerwin doesn't think concern for the ecology is the sole
reason for the interest in conservatories.
   ``If that were the case, you could buy up quite a bit of
Brazilian real estate with $100 million and preserve the
original,'' he says.
   There seems to be an attendant sense of civic pride about having
a conservatory. You've got the art museum, the symphony, a zoo, and
now, by gosh, it's about time for that conservatory.
   Most of the new construction has been in the South and
Southwest, where culture is moving in along with the satellite dish.
   The Brooklyn Botanical Garden played host to the first-ever
conference to study everything from fund-raising to new methods of
pest control, as well as to show off its own $25 million
restoration and new construction, the Steinhardt Conservatory.
   Representatives of the four newest conservatories _ the ones in
Brooklyn, San Antonio, Atlanta and Oklahoma City _ dominated the
sessions dealing with architecture, ventilation, shading, cooling
and heating, publicity, the pros and cons of receiving municipal,
county or state support, how to present a good educational program,
how to introduce predator insects.
   It revealed a basic conflict between architects and
horticulturists.
   Architects want to make a statement with the structure.
Horticulturists want to obscure the structure as much as possible
so that visitors feel they are lost in time as they meander through
the misty fronds.
   The Whites of Rock Island are thinking more modestly than their
Brooklyn host, perhaps $3 million to $4 million. They personally
have a bonsai collection of more than 100 trees, someone else has a
rose collection, a third has a cactus collection and they all want
to will them to a conservatory.
   ``We've been talking about it for three years, but I've met
people here who have been trying to raise money for 18 years,''
Mrs. White says.

   They don't have the potential resources Brooklyn has. When costs
ran high, Brooklyn found a last-minute benefactor, Wall Streeter
Michael Steinhardt, who donated $3 million.
   Since his was the largest single donation, the lovely glass
houses, connected underground, are called the Steinhardt
Conservatory.
   ``You could say that you do get a lot of bang for your buck when
you contribute to a conservatory,'' observed Mike Bush, the
director of one of the new conservatories, the Myriad Gardens'
Crystal Bridge in Oklahoma City.
   The Crystal Bridge is a $6.3 million modernistic structure that
evokes the sense of being in a space capsule at the same time as
being in a primeval world of nature.
   Some have described the 14,000-square-foot cylindrical bridge as
a ``trash can littering the landscape.'' It is, however, an example
of the creative architecture evolving in the greenhouse world.
   In Atlanta, industrialist J.B. Fuqua picked up the entire tab,
$5.5 million, for the Dorothy Chapman Fuqua Conservatory, a
conservatory with rare plants, man-made mist, free-flying birds, a
collection of more than 300 carnivorous plants. It promises to be a
major conservatory of the future, with a commitment to preserving
rare plants.
   The new Atlanta showpiece has 16,000 square feet of display
space and is named in honor of Fuqua's wife of 43 years.
   In San Antonio, there is the new Lucile Halsell Conservatory,
carved into the ground with a series of soaring glass roofs and
containing an innovative Alpine environment, as well as the
traditional palm trees, showy orchids and cacti. This
90,000-square-foot complex, opened in 1988, carried a $7 million
price tag, $5 million of which came from the Halsell Foundation,
endowed by the late Ewing and Lucille Halsell. It was then turned
over to the city to maintain with the hopes that it would be a
major tourist attraction, ranking just below the Alamo and the
River Walk.
   Eric Tschanz, now at Powell Gardens in Kansas City, which has a
conservatory in its future, was the director at San Antonio when it
was built. He says one study showed it ranked among the top five
Texas tourist attractions when it first opened.
   ``Part of that was because it was new,'' he says. ``A lot of
conservatories have tremendous tourist appeal when they first
open.''
   Tschanz says that when St. Louis' Climatron opened in 1960, it
was packed with tourists, but it did not maintain that appeal.
   The Climatron was perhaps the most spectacular conservatory use
of Buckminster Fuller's geodesic dome, a popular design in the
mini-boom of the '60s. It now is undergoing a $12.8 million
renovation, mostly replacing the acrylic glass that had yellowed
with age.
   The West Michigan Horticultural Society in Grand Rapids, Mich.,
is one, like Rock Island, that is starting from scratch and
eventually hopes to put together an $8 million botanical gardens
and conservatory. The county has donated 50 acres and they are
about to launch the first fund drive.
   ``It looks doable and we're constantly on the march,'' says the
president, Betsy Borre. ``My family teases me about being president
because my house plants are dying.''
   In Murrells Inlet, S.C., a $5 million phase one is planned for
Brookgreen Garden, but Hurricane Hugo has taken the committee right
back to the drawing boards. The director, Gurdon Tarbox, thinks a
traditional greenhouse would have gone with the winds.
   Brookgreen is unique for combining sculpture with plants.
   The U.S. Botanical Garden in Washington, D.C., lists $15.2
million for what may be a renovation of the existing conservatory,
but may end up being a complete reconstruction.
   Robert Halpern, horticulturist for the Cincinnati Zoo and
Botanical Gardens, proposed putting birds into the conservatories.
Some, such as the Fuqua Conservatory, already have them, but it
generally is not an idea whose time has come.
   ``We have to get the public in and the sounds of birds, the
whirring of birds in flight, a sighting of a bird, is a great
draw,'' Halpern says.
   Halpern tells of one Canadian conservatory with free-flying
birds that had to start screening the visitors. One woman released
her pet parakeet so it could live in splendor. Another was stopped
before she could release a box of finches.
   Alden Aust is a retired city planner and chairman of the
committee to get a botanical gardens and conservatory in Omaha, Neb.
   He and his wife attended the conference to pick up pointers.
Aust lists the usual reasons why he feels Omaha should have a
conservatory. He holds what may be the strongest explanation until
last.
   ``Well, Des Moines has one and it's half our size.''

   At a recent seminar in New York City, devotees from all over the
United States gave status reports on their efforts to build plant
conservatories to preserve or show off rare and exotic plants.
   Many of the new conservatories and renovations of existing
facilities, including the proposed $7 million Moody Gardens in
Galveston, Texas, are still in the planning stages, although some
have firm opening dates.
   Some examples:
   _The $4.1 million Olbrich Botanical Gardens in Madison, Wis., is
building a 10,000-square-foot, diamond-shaped conservatory that
will be open to the public in 1991.
   _Salt Lake City would like to have a conservatory at the State
Arboretum of Utah by 1994.
   _Chicago already has spent more than $1 million restoring its
two conservatories and will put an additional $2.1 million into the
1912 Garfield Park Conservatory and $650,000 into the 1890s Lincoln
Park Conservatory.
   _The spectacular Longwood Gardens in Longwood, Pa., once part of
the duPont estate, reopened one greenhouse last year after a
$725,000 renovation. Longwood is the showiest of any American
conservatory with more than four acres under glass. It has an
annual operating budget of $7 millioin to $8 million.
   _A new $1.8 million atrium at the Cowles Conservatory in
Minneapolis, which features art work as well as plants, has opened.
   _A $12 million renovation of the New York Botanical Garden's
Enid A. Haupt Conservatory is in the planning stages. Also in New
York, the Queens Botanical Gardens is planning a conservatory.
   _The 40,000-square-foot Phipps Conservatory in Pittsburgh was
renovated in 1987.
   _Callaway Garden's Cecil B. Day Butterfly Center in Pine
Mountain, Ga., a 8,000-square-foot conservatory costing $5.8
million and featuring a display of tropical butterflies, opened in
1988.
   _A 3,700-square-foot tropical display house, costing about a
half a million dollars, is scheduled to open March 31 at the
Norfolk, Va., Botanical Gardens.
   _A $5 million visitor's center and cactus and succulent pavilion
is planned at the Desert Botanical Gardens in Phoenix. An
additional $10 million will be raised later to build a new
administration building as well as a restaurant. The project is in
the fund-raising stage.
   _In Richmond, Va., the Lewis Ginter Botanical Garden at
Bloemendaal is beginning phase one of an ambitious 20-year program
of conservatory building that will make it the second only to
Longwood when completed. Phase one will include a display house
with a flower show 365 days a year and probably cost about $5
million. The 20-year plan calls for a $20 million outlay.
   _In Baltimore, $6.5 million is being raised for a new extension
of the Schaefer Conservatory at Druid Hills Park.

of Florida to the deep waters of the Chesapeake Bay, bald eagles have made
a dramatic comeback in the years since the pesticide DDT was banned. The
majestic birds that once faced extinction have even found their way back
to a marsh in Pennsylvania.    ___</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   During the last ice age about 16,000 years
ago, when mammoths and mastodons roamed Pennsylvania, the boulders
and gravel from retreating glaciers filled an ancient stream
channel and created a 13-mile-long expanse of water, waterlilies
and waterfowl.
   From all appearances, little has changed. Conneaut Marsh is
inaccessible xcept by canoe, and even then channels must be cut
periodically through the mucky sediments and viney undergrowth to
allow even limited passage.
   It is in this isolated setting, flanked on all sides by sparsely
populated farms and tall stands of trees, that a pair of bald
eagles have built a home.
   They represent two of 10 bald eagles nesting in water-rich
Crawford County in northwestern Pennsylvania. Another 10 are
believed to have taken up permanent residence along rivers in the
central pat of the state, thanks to programs devoted to relocating
chicks taken from Canadian nests and reintroducing them to the
state.
   ``This is an effort to return the national emblem to
Pennsylvania and make it available for citizens to observe without
having to go to Alaska or Canada,'' says Jack Byerly of the state
Game Commission.
   ``When I see an eagle flying along the river I want to say to my
kid, `There goes our national emblem.' I don't want to say, `There
goes one released from the Hershey Zoo.' I want to see it wild and
flying free.''
   Throughout the country, from the deserts of Arizona to the
swamps of Florida to the deep waters of the Chesapeake Bay, eagles
have made a dramatic comeback from the days of the now-banned
pesticide DDT, which decimated the species three decades ago.
   The population has climbed from an all-time low of about 350
nesting pairs in the mid-1960s to about 2,400 nesting pairs today,
according to the National Audubon Society.
   An additional 3,000 to 7,000 younger birds _ under the breeding
age of 5 years _ are believed to roam the skies, including roughly
800 that have been released through relocation programs over the
past decade.
   Although 20 eagles seems a small number in a state as large as
Pennsylvania, there are countless more eagles spotted throughout
the state at various times of year, Byerly says.
   Many are simply passing through on their migratory routes, while
others are part of a group of 88 young eagles that have been
released over the past seven years but are not old enough to mate
and build nests.
   Able to adapt to subarctic temperatures and hot, arid climates,
the bald eagle is most often found where there are water and lots
of fish.
   ``This bird can literally be found in all the lower 48 states at
all times of the year, either as a nesting bird, a migrating bird
or a wintering bird,'' says Dan James, an endangered species
biologist with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service in Minneapolis.
``It nests in all but perhaps three or four states and it winters
in or migrates through the rest.''
   So successful has been their recovery that the Fish and Wildlife
Service is considering taking eagles off the list of endangered
species and changing their classification to threatened, James says.
   ``Legally, a threatened species is one that may become
endangered if trends in the population continue,'' he says. ``What
we're seeing, though, is just the opposite. Clearly, the eagle is
on the increase.''
   But conservation groups say the tough, majestic bird is still
too fragile, too easily harmed by man's destructive ways, to take
any chances. The Exxon Valdez oil spill in Alaska, for example,
inflicted severe casualties in Alaska's eagle nesting grounds.

   They say we are still a long way off from the estimated 50,000
eagles that once soared above the United States when this country
was young and the eagle was named the national symbol.
   ``There's not a lot of room for error on this. A bird as big and
vulnerable to habitat loss and poaching as the bald eagle deserves
constant attention, and we would rather err on the side of
caution,'' says M. Rupert Cutler, president of Defenders of
Wildlife.
   ``Although DDT is behind us, there are new chemicals being
invented every day,'' he says. ``In addition, we see rapid
population growth, urbanization, the loss of wetlands and the loss
of old growth forest trees in which the eagles nest, and there's no
reason for optimism as far as eagle habitat protection is
concerned.''
   Jim Pissot, who specializes in endangered species for the
National Audubon Society in Washington, says he is excited by the
idea that eagles may have recovered sufficiently to warrant
changing their status.
   But, like Cutler, he worries their habitat will be whittled away
little by little by a country eager to clear forests, drain
wetlands and build roads.
   ``Without strong federal oversight, we could be picking away at
their habitats _ a nest tree there, some roosting areas someplace
else _ and we could be in the position we were in 40 years ago,''
he says.
   ``Even with the bird listed as endangered, there still is the
possibility that habitat will be lost. But as the bird is
down-listed to `threatened,' that door opens wider, and if it's
taken off the list entirely, that door opens very wide.''
   Regardless of the federal government's decision, Pennsylvania
wildlife officials plan to maintain strict vigils over the state's
brood.
   In Conneaut Marsh, for instance, birdwatchers are allowed no
closer than a half-mile from the eagles' nest, or aerie, while
motorists driving through nearby Erie National Wildlife Refuge are
not permitted to stop or park on a section of roadway near another
nest.
   ``They are so fragile,'' says Brenda Peebles, who monitors the
10 Crawford County eagles for the Pennsylvania Game Commission.
``They don't like people. They don't like to be disturbed. If they
have eggs and you come near them, they're likely to abandon their
eggs.''
   A powerful predator, the bald eagle is happiest, ironically,
when it doesn't have to kill what it eats and can pick at the
remains of dead fish and wounded ducks left behind by other
predators.
   ``Eagles are thieves and robbers,'' says Scott Wood, an
ornithologist with the Carnegie Museum of Natural History in
Pittsburgh. ``The osprey will catch the fish and the eagles will
steal it from them.''
   Bob Faber, a free-lance naturalist from Hiram, Ohio, who
conducts tours of Conneaut Marsh, chuckles, ``It doesn't make for a
good image of the country.''
   Nevertheless, Americans are fascinated with the elusive,
solitary bird.
   A group of 40 Pittsburgh-area residents recently drove two hours
and paddled canoes for several miles just to catch a glimpse _
through binoculars _ of the snowy white head of an eagle perched in
a 7-foot-deep nest high atop a dead tree in Conneaut Marsh.
   The marsh was alive with snipe, warblers, Canada geese, carp
doing belly-flops. But it was the pair of eagles, either surveying
their watery world from the nest or soaring silently over treetops,
that captured everyone's attention.
   ``I wouldn't have missed this for the world,'' said Betty
Abernathy, 78, of Pittsburgh, who has traveled several continents
to watch birds.
   Gay Kalisz, 43, of McDonald, added: ``It's not like a walk in
the woods. It was wonderful to see this after knowing of the
slaughter they've gone through.''

   EDITOR'S NOTE _ It's the nation's oldest continuously published newspaper,
a New England journal whose style and stance has fluctuated wildly over
its 225 years. But The Hartford Courant has endured where many others have
failed and today remains robust in a troubled industry.    ___</HEAD>

   George Washington advertised in it,
Thomas Jefferson sued it and Mark Twain tried to buy a piece of it.
   The Hartford Courant, born in 1764 above a barbershop in what
was then a bustling river town, just celebrated its 225th birthday,
another milestone for the nation's oldest continuously published
newspaper.
   The Courant celebrated in October by opening a $15 million
addition to its main office and by cranking up the hand-operated
press that Thomas Green used to print the Courant in the late 1700s.
   The Courant was a weekly until 1837, and so cannot lay claim to
being the nation's oldest daily. That distinction belongs to The
New York Post, printed daily since 1801.
   The Courant has never won a Pulitzer Prize and has always lived
in the shadows of bigger, more acclaimed newspapers in Boston and
New York. But it has endured, outlasting 40 now-defunct Hartford
papers, and today remains a robust newspaper in a troubled industry.
   ``The fact that it has held up all these years and is still
regarded as a paper of quality is impressive,'' said Everette
Dennis, director of the Gannett Center for Media Studies in New
York. ``It's not The New York Times, but it serves its purpose.
It's a major regional newspaper.''
   With daily circulation at 225,000 and slowly climbing, the
Courant is by far the largest paper in Connecticut. It prints seven
regional editions with news from more than 70 Connecticut cities
and towns from the Massachusetts border to Long Island Sound.
   During the Revolutionary War, the Courant had _ by its own
account _ the largest circulation of any newspaper in the Colonies,
and was an influential supporter of the revolution.
   ``AMERICANS!'' the Courant blared to its readers in May 1775.
``Forever bear in mind the BATTLE of LEXINGTON! Where British
troops, unmolested and unprovoked, wantonly, and in a most inhuman
manner, fired upon and killed a number of our countrymen.''
   When the Constitution was proposed in 1787, the Courant printed
it in full as a news item. The Courant made clear its support for
the Constitution by running articles on the need for a stronger
union of the states and printing unanswered letters from the
Constitution's advocates.
   George Washington was president when he ran two ads in the
Courant in 1796. The first offered four farms for rent near his
Mount Vernon estate. The president warned he would rent only ``to
real farmers of good reputation and none others need apply.''
   During the early 1800s, the Courant, like most newspapers of the
time, adopted a bitterly partisan tone. The paper's chief target
was Jefferson, whom it saw as a godless slave owner, a tool of
France and an enemy of the Constitution.
   The Jefferson administration took notice, and indicted the
Courant for criminal libel in 1806 after the paper ran a story
strongly implying that the administration had sent 60 tons of
silver to France as a bribe.
   The Courant was vindicated six years later when the U.S. Supreme
Court dismissed the suit, ruling that English criminal common law _
the basis for the indictment _ did not apply in the United States.
   The Courant enthusiastically backed Abraham Lincoln for
president in 1860, and declared ``Victory! Victory! We've Got
'Em!'' when Lincoln won.
   But the Courant of the mid-19th century was anything but
progressive. Thomas Day, the publisher, railed against immigrants
and treated readers to large doses of his own racial and religious
bigotry.
   ``The Caucasian variety is intrinsically a better breed, of
better brain, better moral traits, better capacity every way, than
the Negro, or the Mongolian, or the Malay, or the Red American,''
he wrote.
   After the Civil War, the Courant resisted the ``new journalism''
of the day, a rambunctious style that gave readers a heavy dose of
stories on crime and personalities and relied on a relatively new
reporting technique _ the interview.
   This, the Courant wrote, was ``Ungentlemanly Journalism,''
marked by ``the vile invention of `interviewing.'''
   It was during this period of polite and principled journalism
that Mark Twain, Hartford's most celebrated writer, tried to buy
into the Courant. The offer was carefully considered and then
turned down.
   By the 1920s, the Courant's prim approach to the news had earned
it the nickname ``The Old Lady of State Street.'' A young managing
editor named Emile Gauvreau tried to change that, and for a brief
period of four years, the old lady became a flapper, heavy on
crime, sex and photographs.
   But Gauvreau's taste for the bizarre proved too much for the
staid Courant, and he was soon asked to leave. He took his talents
to the New York Evening Graphic, where he boosted circulation to
500,000 with a sensational style that earned the paper the nickname
``Porno-Graphic.''
   The Courant, meanwhile, regained its more measured voice,
although the Great Depression brought an air of quiet desperation
the paper could not ignore. The Courant published stories on ``How
to Feed Four on $9 a Week.''
   The Courant discovered its suburban readers in the postwar
years, and circulation more than doubled, from 52,000 in 1946 to
130,000 in 1964. When the paper turned 200 in 1964, it already had
13 news bureaus crowded into the small state and more than 100
correspondents phoning in local news.
   In 1965, the Courant overtook The Hartford Times in daily
circulation, and within 11 years the Times, once the city's
dominant paper, was dead. The Courant's ascendancy made the paper
an attractive property, and in 1979 the Los Angeles-based Times
Mirror Co. paid $105 million for the Courant, ending 215 years of
local ownership.
   The first years of Times Mirror management were somewhat rocky.
The paper's new emphasis on regional stories, feature writing and
investigative projects clashed with a long tradition of exhaustive
local coverage.
   In Hartford, community activists demonstrated outside the
newspaper, charging that the Courant had abandoned the city. Editor
Mark Murphy was hanged in effigy. Reporter Andrew Kreig left the
paper and wrote ``Spiked,'' a book accusing the Courant's new
management of deceiving the papers' readers in pursuit of a
Pulitzer Prize.
   Under current editor and publisher Michael J. Davies, the
Courant has returned to an emphasis on local news and has opened a
turf war against five suburban dailies by aggressively courting
local advertisers in the cities and towns surrounding Hartford.

   EDITOR'S NOTE _ A new television series, ``Life Goes On,'' deals with
the problems facing a youth with Down's syndrome attempting to attend a
high school with normal kids. It's a subject close to the heart of a Miami
couple who two years ago established a foundation to help children with
the disorder. Putting the children into the mainstream, they have learned,
is fraught with difficulty.    ___</HEAD>

   Like millions of other children, 3-year-old Tiffany
Geraldi went off to begin preschool this fall. But she was soon
sent home and told not to return.
   Tiffany was excluded because she has Down's syndrome. The first
attempt at ``mainstreaming'' her with a typical preschool class had
proved unsuccessful.
   Tiffany's adoptive parents, Dr. Michael Geraldi and his wife,
Camille, were upset, but not defeated.
   They have adopted seven children with Down's, have pending
adoptions for six others and have legal guardianship of another, a
grand total of 14. They also have two children of their own.
   The Geraldis began the ``Up With Down Syndrome'' foundation in
1987 and devoted it to training, loving and caring for children
with Down's syndrome. They also counsel the natural parents of the
children.
   In addition, they provide day care for parents of other children
with the problem and teach adults with Down's how to develop better
job skills and become more independent. All of these services are
free.
   Most of the children the Geraldis have adopted, who range in age
from 2 months to 3 years, have serious medical problems.
   ``When you nourish and love them, something happens. Their
health improves dramatically,'' Ms. Geraldi says.
   The problems can range from digestive disorders to serious heart
defects. One of their children, 1-year-old Jo-layne, already has
undergone two open heart surgeries and seven other major operations.
   Down's syndrome is a genetic defect resulting from a child
having one extra chromosome. This extra chromosome can cause the
child to be born with a host of physical and mental problems.
   Symptoms can include a depressed nose, clubfeet, a raised upper
lip, wide spacing between fingers and toes and decreased mental
capacity.
   Parents have been counseled in the past to put their child in an
institution because of mental retardation, but Ms. Geraldi says
current research shows that a loving home environment allows them
to function at a higher level.
   The foundation's two group homes in the Miami suburb of Kendall
are designed to provide that support, she says.
   Ms. Geraldi, a nurse with a special education degree, says she
developed a special sympathy for children with Down's syndrome at a
very young age.
   When she was 5 years old, she helped her father, who volunteered
at a nursing home for the retarded.
   While she was working as a nurse at Miami Children's Hospital,
she met her husband and found they shared ``a love for children
that were not perfect and normal.''
   ``He was as sensitive as I was to the children,'' she says.
   Geraldi, a pediatrician, and his wife attempted to adopt a
Down's baby from various agencies, including the Department of
Health and Rehabilitative Services, but never heard from any of
them. In the meantime, they had their own two children, Renae, 12,
and Jaclyn, 11.
   But in 1986 they received a call about a very sick baby with
Down's in Mississippi who was 5 weeks old and weighed only four
pounds. They picked her up in Mississippi and, after some legal red
tape, they adopted the child, Darlene, now a healthy 3-year-old.
   The foundation is supported solely by donations and her
husband's salary, she says.
   Because of his salary, they don't qualify for any kind of state
aid, she says.
   They have spent more than $500,000 so far in medical bills and
hope to become eligible for Medicaid.
   Ms. Geraldi says that fears of Down's children that persisted
until recent years were unfounded, but many people are still uneasy
around children with the disorder.
   ``I was in the grocery store with some of the kids and when
people saw us in an aisle, they would turn and walk away,'' she
says.
   A new television series is helping change that.
   ``Life Goes On,'' a critically acclaimed weekly series, is the
story of an 18-year-old boy attempting to go to a regular high
school with normal kids.
   This experiment is known as mainstreaming and tries to integrate
Down's sufferers into normal environments.
   But Ms. Geraldi says, ``I don't think the program is very
realistic.'' She says the boy on the TV program is exceptionally
functional for someone with Down's syndrome and has less of the
physical characteristics.
   However, she says, the show does portray the difficulties of
mainstreaming.
   The children encounter ridicule from classmates and lessons from
teachers untrained in special education.
   Tiffany's teacher did not know how to discipline her when she
refused to listen. Also, other parents objected to her presence in
the class.
   ``After all I've seen, I still cried when Tiffany was sent
home,'' Ms. Geraldi says.

   Since everything from stamp collecting to
dieting to entertainment can be had on video, why not the news?
   MPI Home Video has released ``The San Francisco Earthquake,'' a
one-hour look at the devastating earthquake of Oct. 17, which
measured 7.1 on the Richter scale, killed 66 people and did an
estimated $7 billion in damage.
   According to promotional material, the $14.95 tape promises to
``examine through dramatic footage the 15 catastrophic seconds that
San Francisco and the entire Bay area experienced as well as the
deadly aftermath of the quake.''
   The video also gives earthquake safety tips and provides a list
of agencies where contributions can be sent. The video is produced
by ABCNEWS.
   Elsewhere, SVS has produced a series of narrated children's
stories on video. Although animation on the tapes hardly matches
the quality and artistry of Disney, the storytelling is upbeat and
imaginative.
   Narrators include Glenn Close doing ``The Emperor and the
Nightengale'' and ``The Legend of Sleepy Hollow''; Danny Glover,
``How the Leopard Got His Spots''; Jodie Foster, ``The Fisherman
and His Wife''; Jack Nicholson, ``How the Rhinoceros Got His Skin''
and ``How the Camel Got His Spot''; Robin Williams, ``Pecos Bill'';
Meryl Streep, ``The Tailor of Gloucester,'' ``The Tale of Mr.
Jeremy Fisher'' and ``the Tale of Peter Rabbit''; and Holly Hunter,
``Three Billy Goats Gruff'' and ``Three Little Pigs.''
   The videocassettes have a suggested retail price of $14.95.

   ``Leviathan'' (MGM-UA Home Video. VHS-Beta, $89.95. Rated R)
   
   Nothing like borrowing from every sci-fi, high adventure,
creature feature and still coming up a loser. George P. Cosmatos'
``Leviathan,'' starring Peter Weller and Richard Crenna, does
exactly that.
   It's easy to spot the basic recipe for ``Alien'' and ``The
Abyss'' in this tale about the mutant result of a failed experiment.
   Most of the action takes place underwater, where a mining team
(shades of ``The Abyss'') is trapped with a genetic mess. The
underwater photography is not very special, but the special effects
are _ especially Stan Winston's creature.
   Weller, who turned ``Robocop'' into a cult hit of the 1980s,
provides well-needed humor to an otherwise slow, very slow, story.
   This video won't keep you on the edge of the sofa, but it's as
good as any adventure fright night on commercial TV.
   ``Leviathan'' also features Ernie Hudson, Amada Pays and Daniel
Stern.

   Montana-born E. McKnight Kauffer spent most of his life in
England creating colorful and impelling posters for the London
Underground Railway.
   His romantic landscapes early in the century, ``In Watford'' and
``Oxhey Woods,'' seduced Londoners to the British countryside. In
the 1920s, he drew abstract designs for retail stores. He also
designed museum posters, brochures and tickets for the Orient Line
and did stage and costume design.
   Works by Kauffer (1890-1954) will be on display at the
Cooper-Hewitt Museum, the Smithsonian Institution's National Museum
of Design in New York.
   ``E. McKnight Kauffer: Graphic Art and Theater Design'' will
feature more than 100 posters, advertisements, book illustrations
and theater designs from Nov. 21 through April 1.

   On the matter of awards for actors, Daniel
Day-Lewis admits he likes to watch them, ``but only as a fly on the
wall.''
   That may change next March when the Academy Awards are handed
out at the Los Angeles Music Center. Day-Lewis seems dead certain
to be nominated for his absolutely stunning performance in the
Dublin-made ``My Left Foot.'' He was acclaimed best actor in
September at the Montreal World Film Festival and received raves
from critics at the New York Film Festival.
   Strange title, right? Of course you can't learn from the ads
(``a story about life, laughter, and the occasional miracle'') what
the film is about. What it's about is Christy Brown, the Irish
cerebral palsy victim who managed to become an acclaimed writer and
artist although he was virtually mute and could express himself
only with his left foot.
   Day-Lewis' performance is no more downbeat than Marlee Matlin's
in ``Children of a Lesser God,'' which also dealt with a handicap.
The actor captures all the rage, frustration, yearning and devilish
humor of Christy Brown despite the physical limitations. But then,
filmgoers have learned to expect the unexpected from Day-Lewis in
his brief film career.
   Consider these roles: the blond gay punk of ``My Beautiful
Laundrette,'' the priggish slick-haired suitor in ``Room With a
View,'' the lascivious Czech surgeon in ``The Unbearable Lightness
of Being.''
   He manages to submerge his own persona in each role, and it was
a surprise to find him at the Montreal festival a darkly handsome,
soft-spoken Englishman with a headband holding back his long hair.
His outfit was highlighted by a pair of pajama-like pants of navy
blue with large white polka dots.
   Interviewing Day-Lewis is a challenge. His replies are
punctuated with thoughtful pauses, as he struggles to say exactly
what he means. He admitted his early ambivalence about undertaking
the portrayal of Brown.
   ``I didn't think that I could do it, but I had a strong impulse
to take it on. Beyond that, I didn't really mind if I didn't do it.
I was very happy that it had given me the desire to work again,
which I had lost some time before. So it seemed like a gift that
had come from nowhere,'' he said.
   After finishing ``The Unbearable Lightness of Being,'' he had
been afflicted not by actor's block but with ``an unshakable
fatigue, which left me without any desire to perform whatsoever.''
It lasted a year, but he had expected it to last longer.
   Writer-director Jim Sheridan's script for ``My Left Foot''
intrigued Day-Lewis, and the pair spent three months researching in
Dublin. The actor devoted much of the time at the Sandymount Clinic
observing how children learn to deal with the physical limitations
of cerebral palsy. He also was accepted into the Brown family.
Christy died in 1981.
   Meanwhile, producer Noel Pearson sought backing for the $1.5
million project. Not an easy task, the actor admitted.
   ``You have to deal with a really immense reluctance and, at
worst, a kind of cynical attitude that `well, this is a kind of
cripple picture,' which makes me furious,'' he said.
   ``But, of course, that's what you come up against: Films tend to
be financed by people who don't understand the process of
filmmaking and have no passion for it. It's very difficult to offer
your passion as a justification for making a film. It doesn't
work.''
   Day-Lewis' immersion in the Brown role has astounded reviewers,
and the actor explained: ``This may be presumptuous of me, but I
felt that I had an understanding of to some extent his anger, his
frustrations, his desire to create, his sense of impotence. Many
different aspects of his life I felt I had an understanding of, and
they didn't relate specifically in my mind to his disability at all.
   ``It became very important to me that it didn't become a film
about a supposedly able-bodied actor taking on the physical
manifestations of this supposedly disabled man. That seemed to me a
secondary importance.''
   Daniel Day-Lewis, 32, had a far different background from the
working-class Christy Brown. His father was England's poet laureate
Cecil Day-Lewis; his mother was actress Jill Balcon, daughter of
filmmaker Sir Michael Balcon. The boy made a brief acting debut at
12 in ``Sunday, Bloody Sunday,'' but in school contemplated
becoming a cabinetmaker.
   Acting prevailed, and he trained at the Bristol Old Vic. His
adult debut in films came as a seaman in the Mel Gibson-Anthony
Hopkins ``The Bounty'' remake. He toured with the Royal Shakespeare
Company, playing leads in ``Romeo and Juliet'' and ``A Midsummer
Night's Dream,'' then began his string of remarkable film
portrayals.
   Day-Lewis was asked if he considered Brown a genius.
   After an extended silence, he replied: ``Christy? Yeah. I'd say
that he was a genius in the way that he lived his life. Not
necessarily in his work, though I think that some of his writing is
quite superb.
   ``My admiration for him has more to do with the manner in which
he lived his life, and his, uh, relentless confrontation with
things that people around him found difficult to accept.''

   The Supreme Court has cleared the way for the
partial merger of Detroit's two daily newspapers in its first
ruling on a 1970 law aimed at saving failing newspapers.
   The high court's 4-4 split Monday affirmed a lower court ruling
that former Attorney General Edwin Meese III acted reasonably last
year when he approved plans by the Detroit Free Press and The
Detroit News to merge their business, production and advertising
staffs but maintain editorial independence.
   The federal Newspaper Preservation Act of 1970 authorizes the
attorney general to give financially failing newspapers an
exemption from federal antitrust laws.

<HEAD>Yields Fall on 10-Year Treasury Notes, Rise on Short-Term Bills</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Yields on 10-year Treasury notes fell in
Monday's auction to the lowest level in 33 months while yields on
short-term securities rose.
   The average yield for the 10-year notes was 7.94 percent, down
from 8.03 percent at the last auction on Aug. 9. The auction was
part of the government's quarterly refunding postponed last week by
Congress' delay in raising the debt limit.
   It was the lowest rate since 10-year notes averaged 7.25 percent
on Feb. 4, 1987. The notes will carry a coupon interest rate of 7~
percent with each $10,000 in face value selling for $9,955.70.
   A total of $10 billion in notes was sold out of bids totaling
$22.8 billion.
   The Treasury will complete its refunding with the auction on
Tuesday of $10 billion in 30-year bonds. It sold $10 billion in
three-year notes last Thursday and $10 billion in 36-day cash
management bills last Friday.
   In the Treasury's regular weekly auction, interest rates on
short-term securities rose to their highest level in two weeks.
   The Treasury Department sold $8 billion in three-month bills at
an average discount rate of 7.68 percent, up from 7.67 percent last
week. Another $8 billion was sold in six-month bills at an average
discount rate of 7.51 percent, up from 7.49 percent last week.
   The rates were the highest since Oct. 30 when three-month bills
sold for 7.78 percent and six-month bills averaged 7.62 percent.
   The new discount rates understate the actual return to investors
_ 7.94 percent for three-month bills with a $10,000 bill selling
for $9,805.90 and 7.92 percent for a six-month bill selling for
$9,620.30.
   In a separate report, the Federal Reserve said Monday that the
average yield for one-year Treasury bills, the most popular index
for making changes in adjustable rate mortgages, fell to 7.87
percent last week, down from 7.89 percent the previous week.

   Ford Motor Co. said it was recalling
about 1.5 million 1985-87 Ford Escort and Mercury Lynx cars to fix
problems with the driver's seat track.
   The company said Monday a bracket attaching the front of the
track to the floor could crack, which would cause rocking in the
seat. The National Highway Transportation Safety Administration
investigated the problem.
   Separately, Ford said it would provide extended warranty
protection for about 343,000 1986-88 model Aerostar minivans
equipped with 3-liter, V-6 engines for a potential problem with an
engine crankshaft pulley.
   Ford said bolts holding the pulley could separate, which could
affect operation of the alternator, the power-steering pump, the
air-conditioner compressor and the engine-cooling fan.
   Owners of all the affected vehicles will be notified in writing.
Repairs covered in the recall and by the extended warranty will be
performed free of charge. Aerostar owners who have paid for repairs
on the pulley bolt will be reimbursed.

<TEXT>
   The audience was the Wings Club, but those
looking for news on Donald Trump's recent forays in the airline
business got a dose of Japan-bashing instead when the developer
spoke to an astonished crowd of industry executives.
   ``Japan is truly taking advantage of the United States ... They
are ripping us like no one has ever ripped us before,'' Trump told
a gathering of about 600 airline people Monday at a New York hotel.
``We're the biggest suckers in the world; we're the biggest dopes
in the world.''
   Many in the audience were taken aback by Trump's brash remarks,
which lashed out at the Japanese, West Germans and South Koreans
for flooding this country with exports.
   Trump suggested that a import tax be put on items such as
Mercedes Benz automobiles to exact ``a pound of flesh'' from the
exporters.
   The Japanese are ``not allies'' of the United States, while West
Germany ``is ripping us off'' and South Korea is ``a major ripoff
country,'' Trump said. ``If we get any kinder or gentler, we won't
have any America left.''
   The remarks by Trump, best known for his New York-based real
estate empire, come in the wake of a Japanese firm's purchase of a
controlling interest in the company that controls Rockefeller
Center, a New York landmark.
   Trump also owns the former Eastern Airlines shuttle and made a
brief run at the parent of American Airlines last month, but he
surprised the industry crowd by saying almost nothing about the
airline business.
   Howard Rubenstein, a well known New York imagemaker whose
clients include Trump, said the real estate tycoon has spoken
publicly before about Japan but that some of the themes sounded in
Monday's speech appeared to be new. Trump, who didn't consult
Rubenstein about the speech, spoke without a prepared text or notes.
   Trump bought the Northeast shuttle service from Eastern for $365
million last June and made a $7.5 billion buyout proposal in
October for AMR Corp., parent of industry leader American. He later
dropped the AMR offer, after it had been rebuffed by management and
the company's shares retreated sharply from an earlier runup.
   In one of his few serious comments about the airline industry,
Trump asserted after his speech that the AMR shareholders have been
``absolutely crucified over the years.''
   ``It's a well run airline but from the stockholders' standpoint,
they have been treated horribly,'' he said. He declined comment,
however, on whether he planned a new move regarding AMR.

   Labor, education and business leaders have
joined to launch a foundation linking the classroom with the
workplace to stimulate high school students' interest in business.
   The National Academy Foundation offers a two-year program for
high school juniors and seniors with a special curriculum designed
by educators in consultation with industry experts. Each student is
offered a paid, on-the-job summer internship with a business.
   The foundation is headed by former National Urban League
President Vernon E. Jordan Jr. and former Labor Secretary William
E. Brock. It is modeled after the successful Academy of Finance,
pioneered in 1982 by American Express Co. and its Shearson Lehman
Hutton brokerage division in New York City.
   Warning of an employment crisis within two to three years, Brock
said Monday that ``the only possible way we can avoid that is by
having a recession so deep that we would be desperately worried
about this country.
   ``We are going to run short of people. We're going to run short
of people with skills and there is no immediate response that could
be made that will stop us from running into that problem,'' he
said, pointing to the end of the ``baby boom era'' in five years,
when there will be an estimated 7 million fewer people in their
twenties than there are now.
   Along with the manpower shortage, Brock said ``our children are
being less well educated than we were. That's insane. It's the
first time in 200 years that's been true and it's true today.''
   Brock said the academy ``begins to address that problem.'' He
said there are 35 Academy of Finance programs in 17 cities and four
Academies of Travel and Tourism in two cities. More than 170
businesses have provided internships for academy students.
   More than 2,200 students are enrolled in academy programs,
including 60 percent minorities. Most of the students are juniors
and seniors, but high school freshmen and sophomores are offered
preparatory courses to qualify them for the academy by the junior
year.
   Academy courses are in addition to the regular high school
curriculum. For example, Academy of Finance students take such
courses as international finance, security operations and financial
planning. Travel and tourism classes include destination geography
and tourism computer applications.
   Brock said school districts and school boards must invite the
academy to their area and guarantee that financing for the program
will continue once business start-up money of about $50,000 ends.

   The AFL-CIO is staging a rowdy show of labor
solidarity and serving notice that its unions plan to adopt a more
aggressive stance in the coming years.
   The 14.1 million-member federation opened its 18th biennial
constitutional convention Monday, beginning with a sing-along to
promote labor unity and ending by passing a resolution pledging
support for union workers involved in several major strikes.
   The most celebrated event of the week-long convention comes
today when Solidarity leader Lech Walesa appears to thank the
AFL-CIO for its support of the Polish trade union and accept the
federation's highest honor, the George Meany Human Rights Award.
   On Monday, the 800 delegates warmly welcomed the United Mine
Workers back under labor's umbrella and enjoyed a procession by
hundreds of workers involved in the strikes, one of which may soon
be over.
   Communications Workers of America President Morton Bahr told the
gathering that his union and the International Brotherhood of
Electrical Workers have reached a tentative company-wide settlement
with NYNEX Corp. and hope to resolve local issues within a week.
The two unions represent 60,000 workers who have been on strike for
15 weeks against NYNEX, which provides phone service in most of the
Northeast.
   NYNEX strikers joined their counterparts at Boeing, Pittston
Coal and Eastern Airlines in a march through the convention hall,
where delegates spent the day promoting labor solidarity and
promising to end the 1980s, a tough decade for labor, on a positive
and militant note.
   UMW President Richard Trumka, addressing the convention a month
after the Mine Workers ended 40 years of independence from the
federation, sounded a warning that anti-union employers ``who
looked upon the 1980s with great fondness are about to have their
visions shattered in the 1990s because we will never be separated
again.''
   Federation President Lane Kirkland, who first took office 10
years ago at the same hotel where the delegates are gathering this
year, said the success of the labor movement in Poland and other
nations in promoting democracy should serve as a lesson to those in
this country who doubt the need for unions.
   ``Is it not reasonable to hope, at least, that American labor's
movement toward democracy in the world will provide a new lesson
for Americans regarding the role of trade unions in promoting and
preserving freedom in our country?'' Kirkland asked.
   The delegates also received praise from Labor Secretary
Elizabeth Dole, who acknowledged the numerous policy differences
between labor and the Bush administration but added, ``The tireless
efforts of America's unions have resulted in protection for all
workers, regardless of whether they are union members.''

<HEAD>European Electrical Manufacturer To Buy Industrial Boiler Company</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Combustion Engineering Inc., a maker of
industrial boilers, says it will merge with a Swiss company that is
the world's largest electrical equipment manufacturer in a $1.6
billion deal.
   ABB Asea Brown Boveri Ltd. will buy Stamford-based Combustion
Engineering for $40 per share, the companies announced Monday. The
chief executives said the merger will join two firms that make
complementary products for similar industries.
   On the New York Stock Exchange, Combustion Engineering's shares
surged $13.50 Monday to close at $39. It was the most active issue
of the day, with nearly 5.6 million shares changing hands.
   ABB, with $20 billion in annual sales, supplies electrical
equipment used in power generation, transmission and distribution,
as well as equipment used in automation, transportation,
environmental control and financial services.
   Combustion Engineering, with $3.5 billion in sales, makes
boilers used in power plants, designs and constructs other types of
plants and builds automated systems for factories. It also owns
waste-to-energy plants in Hartford and Detroit and performs
environmental cleanup services.
   ``The two companies are complementary in products, industry
coverage and regional presence,'' ABB Chairman Percy Barnevik and
Combustion Engineering Chairman Charles E. Hugel said in a joint
statement.
   The acquisition would be ABB's second major deal announced this
year. In September, it said it would pay $370 million to buy
Westinghouse Electric Corp.'s 55 percent share of a joint venture
with ABB in power transmission and distribution.
   Earlier this year, the Justice Department considered but
rejected a proposal to block the creation of the joint venture on
grounds of too much overlap between the two companies.
   The merger announced Monday also will likely face scrutiny on
antitrust grounds. But the chief executives said they are confident
about the deal because the products and industries are
complementary, not competitive. In addition, the noted, ABB sells
primarily in Europe while Combustion Engineering sells in North
America.
   ``We're quite confident there's no show-stopper here,'' Hugel
said.
   The merger grew out of a discussion the executives had in August
about the possibility of cooperative efforts in power generation.
They decided a full merger would be the best way to proceed.
   Under the agreement, ABB will buy all outstanding shares of
Combustion Engineering stock for $40 each, and assume $230 million
in long-term debt on Combustion Engineering's books. ABB said the
offer will not require financing.
   Barnevik said the merger would mean a greater commitment from
ABB in the power and industrial markets. He also said the company's
North American sales of $3 billion and staff of 15,000 would
increase to $7 billion and 40,000.
   ABB only does about 1 percent of its business in Eastern Europe,
and Combustion Engineering even less. But the chief executives said
they see the East Bloc nations as ripe for growth, especially in
light of the pro-democracy movements in Poland and Hungary and the
opening of the Berlin Wall last week.
   ``The process in Eastern Europe is irreversible,'' said
Barnevik, who said the companies' annual sales there could grow to
$1 billion in a few years from the current $200 million.
   ``Marketplaces are coming together, country boundaries are
coming down and we're simply heading for one world market,'' said
Hugel, whose company in the last two years has announced two
agreements to build plants and supply instrumentation and software
in the Soviet Union.
   Hugel is no stranger to buyouts. He was non-executive chairman
of RJR Nabisco Inc., which means he was chairman of the board but
not a company employee, during the Nabisco bidding war of 1988, and
a director of Primerica Corp. when it was sold to Commercial Credit
Corp. that same year.
   Combustion Engineering will retain its managers and Stamford
headquarters under the merger.
   ABB was formed in January 1988 as a partnership between ASEA AB
of Sweden and BBC Brown Boveri Ltd. of Switzerland.

<HEAD>Stocks At Record High, Dollar Gains</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Tokyo Stock Exchange's key index recovered from
an early setback and ended at a record high today, while the dollar
closed marginally higher against the Japanese yen.
   The 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average gained a marginal 18.52
points, or 0.05 percent, ending at 35,768.64. It was yet another
high.
   ``The index made nervous ups and downs during trading, because
participants failed to determine the market direction,'' said
Masaya Hashizume, a dealer with Nikko Securities Co.
   He said investors changed their buying targets from one issue to
another, contributing to nervous fluctuations in the index.
   ``That's partly because many investors have been unsure about
external factors including foreign exchange and interest rates,''
he said.
   Market players bought issues such as steels and electric power
plants toward the end of the afternoon session, helping the index
recover, Hashizume said.
   An estimated 900 million shares changed hands today, up from
Monday's 750 million.
   The dollar closed unchanged from its opening at 143.80 yen, up
0.25 yen from Monday's close of 143.55 yen. The currency ranged
between 143.60 yen and 143.85 yen.
   ``The dollar-yen rate stayed almost the same all day,'' a trader
with Mitsubishi Bank in Tokyo said on condition of anonymity.
   After opening higher following a similar upswing in New York,
the dollar fluctuated narrowly as investors sold and bought for
profit-taking and position adjustments, he said.
   In earlier trading, the dollar fell as securities firms and
foreign banks sold the currency for profit-taking, but it recovered
in the afternoon as trading houses bought it, he said.
   ``At any rate, the currency would not move much prior to the
auction of the U.S. government bonds and releases of a series of
economic indicators this week,'' the trader said.
   The United States is to announce the nation's major economic
indicators including the retail price index due out later today and
revised trade figures for September, slated for Thursday.

   The dollar eased against most major foreign
currencies in early European trading today. Gold prices were little
changed.
   Currency dealers said the dollar was stuck in a narrow range in
quiet trading ahead of the release later today of October retail
sales figures.
   ``The dollar is standing still ahead of the U.S. economic
data,'' said one trader in Milan, Italy.
   October industrial production and capacity utilization figures
were also due to be released later in the day, followed by trade
figures on Thursday.
   In Tokyo, where trading ends before Europe's business day
begins, the dollar rose 0.25 yen to a closing 143.80 yen. Later, in
London, it was quoted at 143.78 yen.
   Other dollar rates at midmorning compared with late Monday's
rates, included: 1.8566 West German marks, down from 1.8615; 1.6385
Swiss francs, down from 1.6410; 6.3015 French francs, down from
6.3140; 2.0948 Dutch guilders, down from 2.1030; 1,358.50 Italian
lire, down from 1,360.50; 1.1697 Canadian dollars, up from 1.1677.
   In London, the dollar fell slightly against the British pound.
It cost $1.5825 to buy one pound, compared with $1.5805 late Monday.
   Gold opened in London at a bid price of $391.75 a troy ounce,
compared with late Monday's $391.25. At midmorning, the city's five
major bullion dealers fixed a recommended price of $391.75.
   In Zurich, the bid price was $391.20, up from $390 late Monday.
   Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold rose $4.34 to close at a bid $391.51.
   Silver was quoted in London at a bid price of $5.34 a troy
ounce, down from Monday's $5.31.

<HEAD>Bill May Aid Earthquake-Damaged Ag Business</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Agricultural businesses damaged by last
month's California earthquake may get aid under the same program
providing assistance to drought-affected farmers.
   The House approved a bill on a voice vote Monday amending the
Federal Disaster Assistance Act of 1989 to include speciality
growers and processors hit by the earthquake.
   Rep. Leon Panetta, D-Calif., sponsor of the bill that goes to
the Senate, said many agriculture businesses ``slip through the
safety net that our nation's disaster programs are supposed to
provide.''
   The earthquake that rocked Northern California damaged fruit and
ornamental trees, caused food processing plants to shut down in
mid-harvest and disrupted work at wineries.
   The legislation provides reimbursement of 65 percent of the cost
of replanting trees and seedlings. It also guarantees loans to
agricultural businesses, increasing from $200 million to $300
million the amount that may be loaned through the program.

   The near destruction of 7,007 pounds of cooked
roast beef led the House to pass legislation allowing courts that
confiscate wholesome meat to donate it to charity.
   ``I introduced the bill to fill a void in the existing law,''
said Rep. Lawrence Smith, D-Fla. whose measure was approved on
voice vote Monday. The bill goes to the Senate.
   It stems from a Miami case known as U.S. vs. 7,007 Pounds of
Cooked Roast Beef, involving imported meat confiscated because it
was fraudulently labeled ``USDA choice.''
   Though inspected by a foreign agency trusted by the federal
government, it had not been inspected by the U.S. Department of
Agriculture and could not be sold with a fraudulent USDA stamp.
   When the importer relinquished the meat and the suggestion was
made that it be given to the needy, the federal court found that no
provision for such action existed in the law.
   Smith said the judge eventually got the meat to a food bank for
the poor through creative interpretation of the law.
   ``We fed 35,000 people with this meat,'' Smith said.
   His bill legalizes donation to charity as a means of disposing
of confiscated meat.
   ``This legislation costs the American taxpayer no money and
makes a significant contribution to fighting hunger in this
country,'' he said.

   A study of the effects of wildfires on timber
supplies, fish and wildlife habitats, recreation and ecosystems
would be conducted under a bill passed by the House.
   The legislation, approved by voice vote Monday, establishes a
25-member National Commission on Wildlife Disasters to study lands
under jurisdiction of the National Parks Service, National Forest
Services and Bureau of Land Management.
   Under the bill, the Agriculture Department would have six months
after enactment to tell Congress what the forests damaged by fire
need to be rehabilitated.
   The bill also requires the Agriculture and Interior departments
to offer annual training programs to certify volunteer fire
fighters to fight forest fires.
   The bill would cost an estimated $250,000 over two years, but
allows for donations that could reduce the amount from the federal
treasury.

   The enormous size of the nation's private
pension system is frustrating government watchdogs, who warn that
the retirement savings of millins of working Americans are
vulnerable to fraud and mismanagement.
   The most alarming reports come from the Labor Department's
inspector general's office, which says failure to shore up the laws
and bolster enforcement could result in a taxpayer-funded bailout
dwarfing the recent savings and loan crisis.
   ``There's an insidious and steady siphoning off, which
ultimately affects the employees,'' says Raymond Maria, acting
inspector general for the Labor Department. ``I am convinced there
is substantial fraud and abuse.''
   An Associated Press investigation found that at least one-fourth
of the private pension plans audited by the government are in
violation of the law _ yet the odds of any individual program being
checked are less than one in a hundred.
   The department has just 300 inspectors to police the nation's
870,000 private pension plans. But instances of fraud and abuse
that already have come to light are touching off alarms in
Washington.
   In some cases, pension administrators have siphoned off millions
of dollars by underreporting earnings. In others, employers never
made required contributions, with pensioners discovering only upon
retirement that the money was missing. Still other companies have
simply dumped their pension obligations on a government insurance
program that already is $1.5 billion in the red.
   What makes the system most vulnerable, officials say, is its
size.
   Frequently described as ``the largest lump of money in the
world,'' the nation's private pension plans hold assets of $2
trillion, or roughly $8,000 for every man, woman and child in the
United States. Those funds cover some 76 million participants.
   The Labor Department audited 1,553 plans in 1989, with
violations found in 492, or almost one-third. A similar rate was
found in 1988 audits, after three years in which the violation rate
was about 25 percent.
   The government is the final insurer of many private pension
assets through the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation. The PBGC,
which receives most of its funds from pension plan premiums, posted
a $1.5 billion deficit in 1988, and a General Accounting Office
study predicted that the corporation would be insolvent by 2001.
   Congress is investigating the stability of the insurance system,
which the Office of Management and Budget recently put on a list of
high-risk programs.
   Most PBGC claims have come from the beleaguered steel industry.
But executive director James B. Lockhart recently cautioned the
corporation's deficit could double if the agency has to bail out
the major airlines undergoing financial difficulties.
   ``If they go bust, the taxpayer picks up the bill _ just like
the S&amp;Ls,'' said Joe McGowan of the inspector general's office.
   The government's ability to legislate pension safety is limited
because the plans exist solely at the discretion of employers, who
in some cases drop the retirement programs rather than reform them.
   Plus, only 40 million pensioners in 107,000 private plans are
covered by the PBGC. Most of the others have no insurance at all.
   Karen Ferguson, director of the Pension Rights Center, a public
interest group, points out that detection of fraud is slim, with
only about 1 percent of the submitted plans subject to Labor
Department audits.
   ``It's astonishing how much of the money is being stolen,'' Ms.
Ferguson said. ``The pension money is sitting there and nobody's
looking.''
   In just one New York case, investigators concluded that some $14
million had been stolen from two union locals by a broker and a
financial adviser. The Labor Department says Mario Renda and Martin
J. Schwimmer made the money by soliciting kickbacks on $100 million
in investments.
   But the concern is by no means limited to large institutional
programs. Ms. Ferguson says one typical case was found in a
dentist's office.
   ``The receptionist wanted to retire but found the pension money
wasn't there,'' she explained. ``The dentist made loans to himself
and invested in Florida land.''
   According to documents obtained under the Freedom of Information
Act, the inspector general's office in late 1987 investigated 168
pension and welfare plans and found $18.7 million in misused assets
and administrative violations.
   Congress in 1974 enacted the Employment Retirement Income
Securities Act, known as ERISA, to protect pension and welfare plan
assets. The act established standards for how the plans were to be
operated in the interests of the participants.
   Officials say the majority of big business pension funds are
stable and well run. Nonetheless, the complexities of the
Employment Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, or ERISA,
coupled with the huge number of pensions leave many plans open to
fraud.
   The Labor Department's Pension Welfare Benefits Administration,
responsible for enforcing ERISA rules, has only 300 inspectors.
   Maria wants to put more of the burden on private accountants,
who under ERISA audit large plans yearly. He would require them to
report any prohibited transactions directly to the Labor Department.
   But the best way to avoid fraud and embezzlement, Maria said, is
to bring more criminal charges and fewer civil suits.
   ``I submit it is the jail term that is the deterrent, not the
fine,'' he said. ``Today there's no stigma to being a defendant in
a civil suit.''
   The Pension Welfare Benefits Administration conducted 5,000
investigations of pension and welfare benefit plans over the last
three years, with just 95 classified as criminal. There were 26
convictions.
   The inspector general's Office of Labor Racketeering, in
comparison, has obtained 179 criminal convictions since 1986. But
that office is barred by a March Justice Department opinion from
investigating non-union plans.
   The Labor Department's deputy secretary, Roderick DeArment,
insists that ``pensioners shouldn't be alarmed.''
   ``We don't have a savings and loan crisis in the pension
industry,'' he said.
   Still, DeArment said he is carefully looking at the inspector
general's reports. Even though he doesn't believe the system is
about to collapse, ``that doesn't mean we shouldn't address the
potential,'' he said.
   Lisa Phillips, an aide to Rep. Tom Lantos, D-Calif., said the
warnings cannot be ignored.
   ``We took some heat, especially with HUD,'' Ms. Phillips said,
noting that internal reports outlined problems in that agency years
before they attracted widespread attention. ``HUD sensitized us to
IG reports.''
   Lantos' government operations subcommittee held a hearing in
August with further meetings scheduled, most likely early next
year. Rep. William Hughes, D-N.J., will hold a hearing this week in
his Select Committee on Aging.
   ``When similar warnings were ignored about the savings and loan
industry and about HUD program administration, the cost to the
American taxpayer and to our economy became staggering,'' Lantos
said.

<HEAD>Top Officers Forced Out, Sources Say</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BRAINTREE, Mass. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The husband and wife team that led Stop
&amp; Shop Cos. were forced out of the company after more than 30
years, sources say, by Kohlberg Kravis Roberts &amp; Co., which
acquired the company in a $1.2 billion leveraged buyout.
   The company announced Monday that Avram J. Goldberg resigned as
chairman and chief executive officer, and his wife Carol Rabb
Goldberg, daughter of company founder, Sidney Rabb, resigned as
president and chief operating officer.
   The Goldbergs led the sale of the company 18 months ago to
Kohlberg Kravis Roberts, a New York leveraged buyout specialist, to
block a hostile takeover attempt by Herbert Haft of Maryland, who
bid $4.6 billion for the company.
   ``I was shocked,'' said Stephen Griffin, executive vice
president of the Griffin Report of Weymouth, Mass., which tracks
food companies.
   ``They continue to open new stores, and everything seemed to be
fine,'' he said of the Goldbergs resigning. ``The surprise is the
abruptness and immediacy of it.''
   Lewis G. Shaeneman Jr., who has been with Stop &amp; Shop for 22
years and has been president and chief executive officer of the
supermarket division since 1980, was named the new chairman.
   Robert G. Tobin, executive vice president and chief operating
officer of the supermarket division, was appointed the new
president.
   The Goldbergs, whose salaries totaled more than $1 million last
year, own 1.15 percent of the newly formed private company.
   The Boston Globe quoted an unidentified source as saying that
``Henry Kravis never liked Avram and Carol.''
   ``He always thought they were running it more like family and
not as professional managers. The business never should have been
sold to KKR. It was a terrible mistake,'' the source said.
   ``This is the busy season, and KKR wants leadership that
leads,'' another unnamed source told the Boston Herald.
   That newspaper also quoted sources saying there had been growing
friction between the Goldbergs and Kohlberg Kravis Roberts and that
the investor group decided to oust the Goldbergs and put in
managers who would ``do things the way KKR wanted to do them.''
   Tom Daly, a spokesman for KKR in New York, said Kohlberg Kravis
Roberts had no comment on the allegations.
   The changes come in the midst of the 75th anniversary observance
of the company, the largest supermarket chain in New England.
   The supermarket division has 116 stores in New England and New
York. Its Bradlees division has 131 discount department stores in
eight states.
   The supermarket division reportedly took in 17.5 percent of the
money spent on food in New England last year, compared with 16
percent the previous year.
   The Bradlees division, however, sold its 35 stores in the deep
South.
   The company lost $21 million last year, largely because of the
buyout cost, on sales of $4.6 billion. Operating profit was $160
million compared with $117 million in 1987.
   Sidney Rabb founded the company in 1914, and family management
continued long after the company went public in 1923.
   The company was known for its community activism and
philanthropy. It endowed chairs at Harvard University and Harvard
Business School and is observing the anniversary by giving $3
million in computer equipmernt to elementary schools in New England.

<TEXT>
   Retail sales, held back by a sluggish
automobile market, fell 1 percent in October for their first
decline in eight months, the government reported today.
   The Commerce Department said overall sales dropped to a
seasonally adjusted $144.5 billion last month after rising 0.9
percent in August and 0.7 percent in September.
   The last time retail sales fell was in February, when they
dropped 0.4 percent. They were unchanged in June.
   The October decline was the largest since a 6.7 percent drop in
January 1987.
   In other October reports, the Federal Reserve Board said that
industrial production fell 0.7 percent, due in part to the effects
of the California earthquake and a strike in the aircraft industry.
The operating rate for factories, mines and utilities fell 0.8
percentage points to 82.8 percent.
   Retail sales account for about one-third of the nation's
economic activity and are watched as a sign of the extent to which
the Federal Reserve's policy of fighting inflation by tightening
credit is slowing the economy.
   Auto sales, lacking major incentive programs during the month,
plunged 5.1 percent in October. Car sales, which represent about 20
percent of retail total, had been propped up by incentives for much
of the year and rose 0.5 percent in September and 2.2 percent in
August.
   The October decline was the largest since auto sales fell 26.5
percent in January 1987.
   Excluding the automobile category, retail sales edged up 0.2
percent.
   Sales of durable goods _ items expected to last at least three
years _ fell 2.7 percent, their steepest fall since a 2.8 percent
decline in October 1987. Durable sales were flat in September after
gaining 2 percent in August.
   The durable goods market has been particularly hit by the Fed's
interest-rate policies because sales often are financed by loans.
   Sales of building materials rose 0.9 percent after falling 1.3
percent in September and advancing 1.7 percent in August. Furniture
and other home furnishing sales edged up 0.3 percent following a
0.6 percent drop in September and a 1.6 percent gain in August.
   Sales of nondurable goods edged up 0.1 percent, following a 1.1
percent gain in September and a 0.1 percent decline in August.
   Nondurable categories showing increases were department stores,
up 0.3 percent; grocery stores, 1 percent; apparel, 0.2 percent;
and drug stores, 1 percent.
   Nondurable categories posting declines were gasoline stations,
down 0.9 percent, and restaurants and bars, off 0.2 percent.
   For the three months from August through October, overall retail
sales were up 6.3 percent. Sales for the first 10 months of 1989
were up 6 percent over the same period of 1988.

   Stock prices pushed ahead this morning as hopes
persisted that the Federal Reserve Board will pursue a more
generous credit policy to spur economic growth.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials rose 4.31 to 2,630.74 by
10 a.m. on Wall Street.
   Advancing issues outpaced declines on the New York Stock
Exchange with 590 up, 393 down and 516 unchanged.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 20.37 million shares after the
first 30 minutes of trading.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks rose
0.39 to 188.61.
   Market watchers say stocks got a lift from several reports
released before trading began today that furnished fresh evidence
of an economic slowdown.
   However, analysts said the statistics didn't paint a completely
clear picture because they were influenced by special circumstances.
   Retail sales dropped 1 percent in October, the first decline
since February. The Commerce Department said a slumping automobile
market depressed total retail sales.
   Separately, the Fed reported industrial production fell 0.7
percent in October. A strike in the aircraft industry and the
impact of the California earthquake crimped overall output.
   Traders have been hoping that the central bank will decide the
sluggish economy needs the stimulation that lower interest rates
would provide.
   In the early going, Central Illinois Public Service led the Big
Board's list of actively traded issue and gained [ to 23}.
   On Monday the Dow Jones industrial average eked out a 0.82 gain
to 2,626.43.

<HEAD>Biltmore Hotel Reportedly Sold to Japanese for $219 Million</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Japanese are adding to their U.S. real
estate portfolio the 66-year-old Biltmore Hotel, where the Oscar
was dreamed up, it was reported today.
   T.A.T Los Angeles Ltd., which is made up of two Japanese firms,
will pay Biltmore Partners $219 million for the recently renovated,
700-room hotel and a 24-story office tower opened two years ago,
the Los Angeles Times said, citing unidentified sources.
   The Biltmore was erected by local businessmen in 1923 for $10
million. In 1927, the Academy of Motion Picture Arts &amp; Sciences
gathered there for a banquent credited with brainstorming the
Academy Award.
   Foreign ownership of U.S. real estate gained renewed national
attention earlier this month with the purchase by Japanese
investors of a majority stake in Rockefeller Group, which owns
Rockefeller Center in New York City.
   The newspaper did not identify the Japanese firms that own
T.A.T. Los Angeles.
   Biltmore Partners bought the aging hotel in 1984 for $75 million
and spent $200 million on improvements, including $40 million for
the office tower.
   The hotel has since ``turned from a loser to a winner,'' said
Bruce Baltin, a partner in an accounting firm that specializes in
hotel consulting.

   Georgia-Pacific Corp.'s attempt to buy
Great Northern Nekoosa Corp. shifted back to federal court in
Maine, where Great Northern today responded to lawsuits challenging
regulations that make a takeover difficult legally and financially.
   Great Northern, denying that anti-takeover provisions of its
by-laws were designed to entrench management at shareholder
expense, said it was ironic that Georgia-Pacific itself has a
shareholder rights plan and supermajority voting rules similar to
the ones it is challenging in court.
   ``The directors of corporations which take such steps _ the
directors of Great Northern no less than the directors of
Georgia-Pacific _ act lawfully and responsibly when they take steps
of this nature that are reasonably calculated to promote the best
interests of the company and its shareholders in the context of a
proposed takeover,'' the Great Northern response said.
   Great Northern, which is headquartered in Connecticut but
incorporated in Maine, filed the papers in U.S. District Court in
Portland, Maine.
   Great Northern, a Norwalk, Conn.-based paper products company,
on Monday rejected Georgia-Pacific's $3.13 billion takeover bid,
saying it was too low and would be financially disastrous for both
companies.
   Great Northern also filed an antitrust suit against
Georgia-Pacific in Bridgeport, Conn.
   Georgia-Pacific, a forest products company based in Atlanta,
harshly criticized Great Northern's directors for voting Sunday to
reject the $58-a-share bid made Oct. 30.
   T. Marshall Hahn Jr., Georgia-Pacific's chairman, challenged the
antitrust allegations, saying the offer represented a 50 percent
premium above the market price of the stock before takeover
speculation drove up prices.
   Great Northern's stock closed down 75 cents Monday at $61.37{ a
share on the New York Stock Exchange. Georgia Pacific shares fell
25 cents to $46.37{.
   ``The board has put forth specious arguments in order to reject
a legitimate and negotiable proposal without offering any
alternative that meets its responsibilities to shareholders or the
company's future,'' Hahn said in a statement.
   He said the company would continue to try to meet with the board
and management, and ``pursue all necessary courses of action to
successfully realize the best interests of all concerned.''
   But Great Northern Chairman William R. Laidig said the companies
were not talking.
   ``Georgia-Pacific doesn't talk to us except through the courts
at this stage of the game,'' he said, referring to both the
antitrust suit in Connecticut and the takeover suit in Maine, where
Great Northern is incorporated.
   Great Northern, which had sales of $3.6 billion last year, makes
paper products, lumber and plywood at mills and factories in six
states. Georgia-Pacific had $9.5 billion in sales from paper,
forest products and building materials.
   Georgia-Pacific proposed buying 54 million outstanding shares of
Great Northern stock in a deal that would cost $4.5 billion,
including refinancing, fees and expenses.
   The paper industry is heading for a downturn after three strong
years, as overcapacity from expansion puts pressure on paper prices.
   Hahn said financing the acquisition would require no layoffs or
sales of assets, and would allow the company to continue spending
on capital projects.
   But Laidig said the directors believed Great Northern was solid
financially and well situated to stand alone and pursue its
long-term business agenda, which includes expansion.

<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Directors of UAL Corp. have instructed their
financial adviser to explore alternatives to an investor group's
attempt to dump the board and take control of the airline company.
   Condor Partners presented UAL, the parent of United Airlines,
with the necessary documents Monday to gain access to the company's
list of stockholders to begin its solicitation of shareowners.
   After a meeting later in the day, the board issued a statement
saying it had authorized its financial adviser, First Boston Corp.,
to ``explore potential transactions with third parties, including
actively determining available alternative'' deals such as employee
ownership or recapitalization.
   The board said it had not received an offer from Condor or any
third party.
   But Augustus Oliver, one of Condor's three general partners,
said the board has misrepresented his group's position.
   ``We never said we were going to put forth a proposal until
being elected to the board,'' Oliver said. ``We feel that we need
to be on the board to be in a position to act on behalf of the
company.''
   Condor was formed as a takeover vehicle by Coniston Partners of
New York, which announced Nov. 3 that it had acquired 9.7 percent
of UAL.
   Coniston's immediate objective is to reduce UAL's board from 16
members to five, three of whom would be Coniston's principals.
   The other two are current board members Stephen Wolf, UAL's
chairman, president and chief executive officer, and Frank Olson.
But the company said Monday both have indicated they're not
interested in serving on a board controlled by Coniston.
   UAL's shares closed Monday at $193.25, up $3.75 in consolidated
New York Stock Exchange trading.
   It was one month ago, on Oct. 13, that a pilot-management effort
to buy the company for $300 a share collapsed for lack of financing.
   Analysts say speculators want to see UAL sold or recapitalized
quickly to minimize their losses from that setback.
   ``If I were on the board, I would assume that there are
sufficient shares held by accounts sympathetic to Coniston that
would result in a majority vote against the board,'' said Samuel
Buttrick, an analyst with Kidder Peabody &amp; Co. in New York.
   Officials of the Air Line Pilots Association chapter at United
met last week with Coniston and financier Saul Steinberg, a friend
of Wolf who is seeking government permission to buy more than 15
percent of UAL.
   Pilots said they have discussed a revised bid with UAL
management, but they hinted last week that they might resume a work
slowdown unless the UAL board recommits in the next two weeks to
majority employee ownership.
   United's Machinists union employees, who opposed the failed
buyout bid, also met last week with Coniston. They say they won't
support any highly leveraged deal that could threaten the airline's
viability or that would involve Wolf.

<HEAD>IBM Announces Data-Storage Device; Reveals Source of Delay</HEAD>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   International Business Machines Corp. announced
a long-delayed set of data-storage devices on Tuesday and revealed
that the expensive delay was caused by internal problems, not a
supplier.
   The delay from the original July announcement date contributed
to a 30 percent drop in the computer giant's third-quarter
earnings. Disk drives for storing data from mainframe computers
account for about a tenth of IBM's roughly $60 billion in annual
revenue.
   Some analysts had speculated that IBM's trouble came from a
flawed part from an outside supplier. But IBM said it was a
chemistry problem that caused magnetic particles from a 10-inch
platter to cling to a read-write head, a microscopic version of the
common problem of dirty heads on a tape recorder.
   IBM solved the problem by using a different chemistry for the
thin ``raspberry jam'' layer of material that covers the magnetic
particles on the platter, according to Paul Low, president of the
General Products Division.
   The new chemistry completely solved the problem and the new 3390
disk drives are the most reliable in the industry, he said.
   The new drives can do three times the work in one-third the
floor space of models introduced just two years ago, IBM said.
   IBM said the disk drives will be shipped beginning Dec. 1 and
that the company expects to increase production enough to meet
customer demand by the April-June quarter of next year.
   IBM earned $877 million in the third quarter, down from $1.25
billion a year earlier.

<HEAD>Young Departure from FDA May Delay Needed Changes: GOP Leader</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: INSERTS new 6th graf, The department, to add that next commissioner
will need Senate confirmation</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DEBORAH MESCE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Republican leader of a House panel
investigating the generic drug scandal says he fears the departure
of Food and Drug Commissioner Frank Young will delay needed changes
at the agency.
   But others on Capitol Hill welcome the change at the
government's principal consumer protection agency, with one
consumer group calling Young ``by far the worst FDA commissioner''
in the past 18 years.
   Young, who has been FDA commissioner since July 1984, will leave
the agency next month to take another top position within the
Department of Health and Human Services.
   The new job, deputy assistant secretary for health handling
science and environmental matters, is an expansion of a vacant post
in the Public Health Service. FDA is part of the Public Health
Service.
   Rep. Thomas Bliley, R-Va., ranking Republican on the House
Energy and Commerce investigations subcommittee, said Young ``was
part of the solution, not part of the problem'' at FDA. He said he
feared Young's departure would be a setback in efforts to make
needed reforms at the agency.
   The department has not announced a replacement for Young. But
unlike Young and his predecessors who were appointed by the HHS
secretary, the next FDA commissioner will have to be confirmed by
the Senate, which could lengthen the time it will take for a
replacement to take over.
   Sources who spoke on the condition of anonymity said they
believed Young was being forced out in the fallout over the scandal
that uncovered fraud, corruption and mismanagement within the FDA's
generic drug division and the generic industry.
   Department officials, however, discounted the speculation as
unfounded rumor and said Young was eager to take the new job, even
though the move is a lateral one.
   Rep. John Dingell, D-Mich., chairman of the panel, said he
didn't blame Young for the FDA's generic drug problems, which led
to bribery convictions of several FDA employees and drug company
officials along with disclosures that some companies cheated on
product safety tests.
   ``His intentions were good and he did his best when problems
were brought to light. But he was handicapped by the budgets and
attitudes of an administration that let the agency go to seed,''
Dingell said.
   But Rep. Ted Weiss, D-N.Y., chairman of the House Government
Operations subcommittee on human resources, said: ``Under extreme
pressure from the Reagan-Bush White House, Frank Young oversaw the
erosion of FDA as an independent watchdog agency. As a result, the
American public has lost the confidence in FDA's ability to protect
consumers from unsafe foods and drugs.''
   Dr. Sidney Wolfe, director of the Public Citizen Health Research
Group, called Young ``by far the worst FDA commissioner in the 18
years since Ralph Nader and I started the Health Research Group.''
   He said Young ``has been more concerned with protecting the
industries FDA is supposed to regulate than in protecting the
public from these industries.''
   The FDA is one of the most visible government agencies,
responsible for assuring the safety of drugs, cosmetics and most
food products.
   Department officials denied that the generic drug scandal had
anything to do with the changes. In fact, the department's
announcement that Young will move into the new position Dec. 18
praised his handling of the generic drug problems.
   ``All of the rumors are just that _ typical Washington
nonsense,'' said James Brown, a spokesman for the Public Health
Service.

<HEAD>Mack Reports $87.5 Million Loss for Third Quarter</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: Meck in 2nd graf is cq.</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ALLENTOWN, Pa. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Mack Trucks Inc. today reported a
third-quarter loss of $87.5 million, as sales in the heavy-duty
truck market continued to soften.
   Walter C. Meck, executive vice president of finance and chief
financial officer, said Mack expects losses to continue through the
fourth quarter and possibly into 1990.
   The third-quarter loss, at $2.94 per share, came on sales of
$367.4 million. In the same period a year ago, Mack earned $2.7
million, or 9 cents a share, on $501 million in revenue.
   For the first nine months of 1989, Mack reported a loss of
$105.9 million, or $3.57 a share, compared with a net profit of $18
million, or 61 cents a share, in the same 1988 period. Revenue
totaled $1.4 billion, down from $1.6 billion a year earlier.
   Mack officials said recent losses were due to a downturn in the
heavy-duty truck market, problems with introducing new products,
and the high costs of liquidating used vehicles and warranties. The
number of Mack-produced heavy-duty vehicles sold in the third
quarter was 34 percent lower than in the same period a year ago,
the company said.
   Mack's new chairman and chief executive officer, Ralph E. Reins,
said the company was facing one of the most difficult periods in
the company's 89-year history.
   ``Mack has taken a number of actions during recent months to
eliminate expenses, cut back on capital expenditures and reduce
inventory levels,'' Reins said. ``However, it is clear that further
actions are needed to improve Mack's competitiveness. A new Mack
will emerge from this effort, a leaner company, a tougher
competitor.''
   In August alone, the company announced more than 600 layoffs at
plants in Waynesboro, S.C., Hagerstown, Md., and Allentown, Pa.,
according to Mack spokesman James Santanasto. He said he did not
know the exact number of layoffs, but said the company's workforce
would be reduced by 21 percent in the last six months of 1989.
   Mack's former chairman, John B. Curcio, resigned in October as
the company announced it expected to lose about $50 million in the
third quarter. Curcio lost the position of president to Reins in
June when the company announced expected second-quarter losses, and
the chief executive position to Reins in September.
   The push to remove Curcio was apparently led by Renault's truck
operations, which owns about 45 percent of Mack's stock and has
four directors on Mack's 10-member board.

<TEXT>
   Share prices finished mixed Tuesday in modest
dealing on London's Stock Exchange, but a key index edged higher
after buyers zeroed in on selected sectors of the market.
   The Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index settled 1.5
points, or 0.07 percent, higher at 2,214.7, nearly midway between
its intraday low of 2,206.6 and its best level of the day of
2,223.3.
   Dealers said the market initially recovered from its opening
losses on futures-related buying which boosted the 100-share index
to its session high within the first two hours of trading.
   The index, along with the overall market, was locked in
relatively narrow trading ranges throughout the remainder of the
session.
   Wall Street's choppy opening did little to provide London with
any substantive direction in its late transactions, dealers said.
   The Financial Times 30-share index ended 0.6 points lower at
1,770.8. Volume was a moderate 334.4 million shares traded, higher
than Monday's turnover of 288.5 million shares.
   The Financial Times 500-share index was 1,215.75, down 0.28.

   The dollar fell Tuesday against most major
currencies in moderate European trading after the release of
disappointing U.S. economic data.
   Gold prices also fell.
   Dealers said the dollar was knocked down by
steeper-than-expected falls in U.S. retail sales and industrial
production for October.
   Retail sales fell 1 percent last month, compared with a
predicted 0.8 percent decline, and production output dropped by 0.7
percent compared with a projected 0.2 percent fall.
   Dealers said the market's reaction was restrained before
Thursday's scheduled release of U.S. merchandise trade figures for
September.
   In Tokyo, the dollar rose 0.25 Japanese yen to a closing 143.80
yen. Lat to

   ``If you engage in any activity in our country, others will
emulate your example,'' Walesa said. ``The world is awaiting your
signal, it is watching you. Do not let the world and us wait any
longer.''
   Walesa offered the AFL-CIO repeated thanks and praise for
assistance dating back to just after the Gdansk shipyard strike he
led in 1981 to Solidarity's forced underground days, when the
federation provided an estimated $5 million worth of communications
equipment and other supplies.
   ``You have proven to be our most steadfast allies in the trade
union struggle for human freedom,'' Walesa said in the text of his
speech, saying others who have endorsed Solidarity's cause have not
backed up their rhetoric with help.
   ``Sometimes we feel as if we are swimming chained hand and foot,
trying to summon all our energy just to make it safely to shore,''
Walesa said. ``And on the shore there is a cheering crowd of people
who offer us their admiration instead of simply throwing a life
belt. We want to make it to the shore, to join the community of
democratic countries with efficient economies.''
   Walesa recalled the emigration of Poles to the United States in
search of freedom and said he had ``traveled across the Atlantic
just to tell you that hope has found its way to Poland too. For the
first time in several dozen years, Poles can feel the breeze of
freedom in their own country _ the breeze many people once had to
seek on this side of the ocean.''
   He warned that if the new Solidarity-led government in Poland
fails to revive the economy, more than Poland's new democracy and
people would suffer, and that success depended on help from abroad.
   ``If we fail to convince people that although things are
changing slowly they are nevertheless changing for the better, then
this breeze of freedom I spoke of will soon disappear, leaving
behind only a sense of bitterness accompanying unaccomplished
dreams,'' he said. ``It will result in a defeat for us, but not
only for us.''
   Walesa, a Nobel Peace Prize winner, told Bush on Monday, ``I'm
full of admiration for your country, not because it's a big power
and not because it's rich, even though one could envy that. I
admire America as a country of freedom,'' he said.
   Bush moved Walesa to tears recalling how he ``made the sign of
the cross on the foreheads of his sleeping children'' before Polish
police took him away in 1981 for 11 months during the martial law
crackdown on Solidarity.
   Now, Bush said, ``Lenin and Stalin have been disproved, not by
presidents or princes, but by the likes of an electrician from
Gdansk and his fellow workers in a brave union called Solidarity.
   ``The Iron Curtain is fast becoming a rusted, abandoned relic.
... The week that brought Lech Walesa to America is the week the
headlines proclaimed, `And the wall comes tumbling down!''' said
Bush.

   Sales of the nation's Big Three automakers' North
American-built cars and light trucks continued a downward spiral in
early November, falling 22.4 percent from last year, the companies
reported Tuesday.
   General Motors Corp., Ford Motor Co. and Chrysler Corp. said
they sold an average of 24,094 vehicles a day from Nov. 1-10 this
year, compared with 31,038 a day during the same time last year.
   Car sales were off 26.2 percent and truck sales were down 16.2
percent for the Big Three.
   The sales continued a trend begun in the first 10-day reporting
period of October, as the 1990 model year opened.
   Analysts had forecast slumping car and truck sales during the
fourth quarter of this year because carbuyers headed to the
showrooms weeks before to avoid 1990-model price increases and to
take advantage of incentive programs on 1989 models.
   Those programs have been whittled for 1990 vehicles.
   In October, car and light truck sales by the Big Three were down
14.1 percent from the year before. That slump pushed October's
retail sales down 1 percent, the first decline in eight months.
   The early-November sales pace of 24,094 vehicles a day was 17
percent below the 29,016 vehicle-a-day sales pace during the same
period a month ago.
   So far this year, car and truck sales by the Big Three were
running 4.3 percent behind last year's pace. Car sales were down
6.2 percent and truck sales were off 1.1 percent.
   In early November, GM posted the largest decline in car sales,
dropping 29.1 percent from the year-ago period. Light truck sales
reported by GM were 20.9 percent below last year's pace. For the
year, GM's car sales were off 7.3 percent while truck sales were up
a slim 0.3 percent.
   Ford's early-November car sales were down 23.5 percent and truck
sales were off 14.3 percent compared with last year. Year-to-date
car sales at Ford were down 1.6 percent and truck sales were
running 3.2 percent behind the year-to-date pace last year.
   Sales of Chrysler's cars were down 22.5 percent for the period,
and light truck sales were down 9.9 percent. Car sales this year
were running 11.6 percent behind last year's pace and truck sales
were down 0.6 percent.

   Victims of the worst thrift failure in history
told a House committee today they were duped into investing their
life savings in what they were told were federally insured
securities, only to learn later they were worthless junk bonds.
   Connie Wickman, 78, of West Hills, Calif., told the House
Banking Committee she and her 80-year-old husband were devastated
when they were told earlier this year their $25,000 in bonds sold
through Lincoln Savings and Loan Association and issued by its
parent company, American Continental Corp. of Phoenix, Ariz., was
lost.
   ``When a senior citizen loses their life savings, it is not only
the money they lose, but something more important,'' Mrs. Wickman
said in a barely audible voice. ``They have failed _ themselves,
their children, their families and also in tomorrow, believing
there is nothing left for them to believe in.''
   The Wickmans are among 22,000 people, mostly Los Angeles-area
retirees, who state and federal officials say were targeted by
Lincoln to switch nearly $200 million of federally insured deposits
into junk bonds after federal examiners first recommended closing
the S&amp;L in May 1987.
   Those bonds became virtually worthless when American Continental
declared bankruptcy last April, one day before the government
finally seized its Irvine, Calif., Lincoln subsidiary which had
lost an estimated $2 billion in savers' federally insured deposits.
   The government last month filed a $1.1 billion suit against
Lincoln's owner, Phoenix millionaire Charles H. Keating Jr.
charging fraud and racketeering.
   Meanwhile, both the FBI and the Senate Ethics Committee are
investigating whether five senators who received $1.3 million in
political contributions from Keating intervened with federal
regulators in keeping Lincoln open for two years after government
examiners recommended closing it down.
   The five senators _ Dennis DeConcini, D-Ariz.; John McCain,
R-Ariz.; Alan Cranston, D-Calif.; Donald Riegle Jr., D-Mich.; and
John Glenn, D-Ohio _ all have denied any wrongdoing.
   But Mrs. Wickman's daughter, Frances Rose of West Hills, held
Keating and Cranston responsible for what she described as a fraud
that could make her parents destitute in the near future.
   Over the past three years, Keating has contributed a total of
$974,000 in either campaign funds to Cranston or to voter
registration and other political causes headed by members of
Cranston's family. Among the items being investigated by the FBI is
whether any of that money was illegally diverted from Lincoln
depositors' accounts.
   ``They found it so painfully hard to believe that Senator
Cranston, a man whom they had supported and voted for during many
years, had received part of his hard-earned dollars carefully saved
each weeks for 30 years,'' Mrs. Rose said of her parents.
   ``The `gentlemen' _ Mr. Cranston, Mr. Keating and others from
American Continental _ have not even had the decency to show a
simple courtesy and answer one of the many letters we have written
to them in the past year,'' she said.
   The House committee, which has been holding hearings into
Lincoln for a month, heard from three other investors whose savings
were lost as it turned its investigation to the roles of the
Securities and Exchange Commission and private accounting firms in
the alleged fraud.
   ``What truly hurts in this situation is that 90 percent of the
debentures were peddled to the public ... long after the alarm
bells had gone off at the Federal Home Loan Bank Board,'' said
Committee Chairman Henry B. Gonzalez, D-Texas.
   Meanwhile, the nation's top thrift regulator who, as the bank
board's chairman since 1987, has been the target of the panel's
probe says he has no intention of resigning amid indications he may
be lossing support from the Bush administration.
   ``I've had no indication either way from the president,'' M.
Danny Wall, told reporters Monday in response to President Bush's
remark that he has not ruled out replacing Wall as director of the
Treasury Department's Office of Thrift Supervision.
   Bush, in an interview with Texas reporters last Friday, said he
intended to respond ``fairly soon'' to a request last month by the
House committee's chairman, Rep. Henry B. Gonzalez, D-Texas, to
replace Wall.
   ``I'm not closing the door on it; I just don't know at this
juncture,'' Bush said. ``But when the question is put: `If part of
the savings and loan problem proves to be management or regulation
people that aren't aggressive enough, would you make changes?,' the
answer is yes.''
   Wall, a former banking aide to Sen. Jake Garn, R-Utah, said
Monday that he interprets those remarks as an indication the
president wants to hear both sides before making any judgment.
   ``The president ... knows that one is innocent until proven
guilty,'' Wall said, reiterating complaints that Gonzalez has
repeatedly postponed his appearance before the panel. ``Certainly
one has to have an opportunity to respond to the questions that are
raised.''

<HEAD>Colorado Developing Favorable Image In Japan, Officials Say</HEAD>
<DATELINE>GOLDEN, Colo. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Japanese company's decision to build a
sake plant near here is a sign that Colorado is becoming well known
in Japan, a state economic development official says.
   ``I think there's a growing awareness of Colorado in the minds
of the Japanese citizens,'' said Susan Blansett, who is a business
development representative for the state's Office of Economic
Development.
   ``Colorado is gaining a favorable image. They're beginning to
equate it with the mountains, the clean water and environment in
general,'' she said.
   The Tatsuuma-Honke Brewing Co. Ltd., which brews a sake called
Hakushika, is purchasing an eight-acre parcel for the brewery in
the Coors Technology Center. It plans to break ground on a $7
million, 50,000-square-foot plant in April. When in operation, the
plant will employ about 50 people, including 30 from Colorado.
   The company began looking at Colorado sites about a year ago,
and signed the deal in September, said officials at Adolph Coors
Co., which is selling the land to Tatsuuma.
   Tatsuuma will compete with four other Japanese sake brewers for
the U.S. market, the officials say. Most of the companies are
building plants in California.
   Tatsuuma officials chose Colorado because they thought a plant
here would preserve a niche, Coors officials said.
   ``From the beginning, they really wanted to differentiate
themselves from their competitors,'' said Sandra Woods, Coors' vice
president for corporate real estate. ``The quality of water was the
most important thing to them.''
   Tatsuuma officials wanted ``the quality first, and a good
relationship with the community,'' added Alec Garbini, Coors'
director of corporate property development.
   Economic development officials believe Colorado eventually may
emerge as a bigger lure for Japanese tourism and investment than
the Canadian Rockies.
   Japanese companies already have purchased the Breckenridge and
Steamboat Springs ski resorts.

<HEAD>Dow Jones Plans to Offer Financial News by Phone</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Dow Jones &amp; Co. Inc. said Tuesday it is
introducing an interactive 900-number telephone service that will
enable callers to get stock quotes, business and financial news,
sports reports and weather conditions.
   Dow Jones, publisher of The Wall Street Journal, plans to charge
85 cents for the first minute and 75 cents for each additional
minute for calls to its service, called JournalPhone.
   The service begins operation Wednesday and will be promoted each
weekday with advertising in the Journal.
   Its creators called the service ``a logical extension'' of the
newspaper.
   ``It picks up where the Journal leaves off and offers an easy,
convenient way to keep on top of the news as it develops throughout
the day,'' said Kenneth L. Burenga, a senior vice president of Dow
Jones.
   Callers who want to find out at mid-morning what the latest
government indicators showed, for example, can hear a recorded
report by dialing 1-900-JOURNAL and pushing the appropriate
telephone buttons as prompted by the service.
   When callers have heard enough, they can push a few more buttons
and obtain 15-minute delayed quotes on any of 6,500 stock prices;
regularly updated reports on the overall stock, bond or currency
markets; information about weather in selected cities; or reports
on sports stories or scores.
   The calls will be charged on regular monthly phone bills.
   Dow Jones is not the first newspaper publisher to provide
telephone services, although its service may offer the widest array
of reports.
   A number of newspapers, for instance, provide sports scores by
telephone for the cost of a local telephone call.
   Gannett Co. Inc.'s USA Today provides four call-in services on
900-numbers, including hotlines for sports information and scores,
weather reports, lottery results and horse racing results.
   Phil Fuhrer, vice president of Gannett New Media, said the
sports hotline receives 2.7 million calls a year at 60 cents for
the first minute and 45 cents for each minute after that. ``It
extends our coverage to 24 hours a day,'' he said.
   Dow Jones executives said they were not sure how many calls to
expect on their new service. It tested the service for three months
this past summer in Atlanta, where about 10,000 Journal readers
were invited to use the system for free. The test showed the
average calls lasted about two minutes.
   The company already provides a more expensive interactive
telephone service for active traders and plans to use the same
staff and facilities for its new service which is geared more
toward average investors.
   Dow Jones expects the new service to be profitable from the
start.

<HEAD>Strike, Earthquake Drive Down Overall Factory Output</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN D. McCLAIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The economy's sluggish manufacturing sector
was hammered by an aircraft strike and an earthquake last month
which pounded industrial production down 0.7 percent to its lowest
level in three and a half years, the government reported Tuesday.
   But the Federal Reserve Board said that without the strike at
the Boeing Co. and the disruptive effects of the earthquake, ``the
total index would have been nearly unchanged in October, continuing
its recent sluggish trend.''
   Nevertheless, the decline was the steepest since a 1.3 percent
drop in March 1986.
   Industrial production was unchanged in September and has shown
weakness in recent months as the Fed kept a tight grip on credit to
slow the economy and curb inflation.
   The October output was foreshadowed by the Labor Department's
report earlier this month of a loss of 13,000 manufacturing jobs in
October, a drop in the average manufacturing work week and
virtually no factory overtime.
   But David Jones, an economist with Aubrey G. Lanston &amp; Co. in
New York said the sluggishness was worsened by the strike, which
added 0.4 percent to the decline, and the earthquake, which added
another 0.2 percent.
   ``If you take into account the special factors, we were down
just 0.1 percent,'' he said. ``That is much more consistent with
the pattern of proceeding months in which the industrial sector is
showing weakness while the others, particularly the service sector,
are holding up well.''
   John Silvia, an economist with Kemper Financial Services in
Chicago, said fairly steady consumer spending coupled with a weak
manufacturing sector indicates ``a little bit of a two-tier economy
showing up again similar to what we had earlier in this economic
expansion.''
   But while the Fed's interest-rate policies were having an
adverse effect on some segments of the economy, another report
indicated it was being successful in keeping inflation in check.
   In that report, the central bank said the operating rate of the
nation's factories, mines and utilities fell 0.8 percentage point
to 82.8 percent in October. Analysts generally consider an
operating rate of 85 percent or more to be inflationary because it
could lead to shortages and thus higher prices.
   Factory use had dipped in September to 83.6 percent from 83.8
percent in August. The rate posted 10-year highs of 84.3 percent
last December and January.
   Industrial production at manufacturing plants making both
durable and nondurable goods was down 0.8 percent in October after
falling 0.2 percent in September and rising 0.4 percent in July.
   Durable manufacturing was off 1.5 percent, compared with a 0.3
percent drop in September and a 0.4 percent gain in August.
Nondurable manufacturing rose 0.1 percent after declining 0.1
percent in September and rising 0.1 percent in August.
   Output was unchanged at mines, compared with gains of 2.1
percent in September and 0.6 percent the previous month. Output at
utilities was up 0.5 percent following a 1.2 percent advance in
September and a decline of 0.7 percent in August.
   The Fed said its industrial production index in October stood at
141.4 percent of its 1977 base, down from 142.4 percent a month
earlier.
   At the same time, it said the manufacturing-plant operating rate
fell from 83.7 percent in September to 82.8 percent last month. The
rate had peaked at 84.7 percent in January.
   The rate at factories producing durable goods _ big-ticket items
expected to last more than three years _ dropped 1.4 percentage
point to 80.9 percent. The rate at factories producing nondurable
goods was off 0.2 percentage point to 85.5 percent.
   The operating rate at mines was up 0.1 percentage point to 84.6,
while it rose 0.4 percentage point to 81.2 percent at utilities.

<HEAD>Farm Credit System Reports Quarterly Profit</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Farm Credit System reported Tuesday that its
third quarter profit jumped 42 percent over a year ago.
   The system said it netted $139 million in the three months ended
Sept. 30, compared with earnings of $98 million in the 1988 period.
   For the first nine months of this year, it earned $457 million,
vs. $434 million the previous year.
   B. Dale Harrison, chairman of the Federal Farm Credit Banks
Funding Corp., the financing arm of the farm credit system,
attributed the improvements largely to higher net interest income
and fewer loan losses.
   Net interest income totaled $236 million for the third quarter,
up from $211 million last year, and to $732 million for the
nine-month period, up from $571 million.
   The system said that net interest income increased as a result
of continued improvement in the credit quality of its loan
portfolio stemming from a reduction in nonaccrual loans.
   When loans are placed on nonaccrual status they are accounted
for only as they come in rather than when they are due.
   The system's non-earning assets, which consist of nonaccrual
loans and other property owned, declined 21 percent to $3.14
billion during the first nine months of 1989.
   The Farm Credit System is a nationwide system of federally
chartered agricultural lending institutions serving the rural
econ   The system took several steps last year to streamline its
structure following 1987 legislation that included the issuance of
up to $4 billion in government-backed, low-interest loans.

   Grain and soybean futures prices closed mixed
Tuesday on the Chicago Board of Trade after a quiet session.
   Prices had opened lower across the board, reflecting
disappointment over China's cancellation of a wheat purchase and a
slackening of export activity. But the corn and soybean markets
rallied at midday and finished mostly higher.
   The Agriculture Department said Monday that private exporters
had reported cancellation of sales of 300,000 metric tons of U.S.
wheat to China that had been slated for delivery in the 1990-91
crop year, which begins June. 1.
   In addition to its impact on the wheat market, the cancellation
revived fears that the Soviet Union may be forced to cancel some of
its recent U.S. corn purchases due to jammed shipping routes.
   ``The wheat cancellation brings us back to the reality that
sales can be canceled,'' said William Biedermann, director of
research for Allendale Inc., a futures brokerage in Crystal Lake,
Ill.
   At the close, wheat futures were { cent to 3 cents lower with

<HEAD>Soybean Farmers' Lawsuit Accuses BOT of Illegal Price Manipulation</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LINDSEY TANNER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Family farmers who say they suffered severe
financial losses from a Chicago Board of Trade order last summer
filed a federal class-action lawsuit Tuesday, accusing the exchange
of illegally manipulating soybean prices.
   The lawsuit seeking more than $100 million in damages was filed
by individual farmers from leading soybean-producing states and the
American Agriculture Movement, a lobbying group that represents
small farmers and rural business people in 34 states.
   The Board of Trade denied the allegations, which stem from its
emergency action July 11 ordering traders to reduce their holdings
in soybean futures contracts.
   The order caused a 20 percent drop in soybean prices and
corresponding declines in other commodities, the AAM said.
   The board's move was widely viewed as an effort to break up an
alleged attempt to corner the market by Ferruzzi Finanziaria SpA,
an Italian company and one of the world's largest soybean
processors.
   ``The CBOT's order was a bad faith and self-serving action
initiated by the CBOT's dominant grain merchants and futures
traders to create profits for their accounts and for their
clients,'' said Harvey Joe Sanner, AAM's president and an Arkansas
soybean farmer.
   Sanner spoke at a news conference at a downtown hotel,
accompanied by about 25 other farmers from Illinois, Iowa,
Missouri, Indiana, Minnesota, Ohio, Nebraska, Arkansas, Kansas and
South Dakota _ many of whom said they had been devastated by the
board action.
   ``I'm angry as hell about what has been done to we as producers
of this nation,'' said Corky Jones, a soybean farmer from
Brownville, Neb., and an AAM member.
   Jones said the order caused U.S. farmers ``in excess of a $50
billion loss on corn and about $27 billion in beans.''
   The lawsuit names as defendants the exchange, CBOT Chairman
Karsten Mahlmann and 21 other directors, and five other exchange
officials.
   After the news conference, the group _ carrying banners and
buckets of soybeans _ marched five blocks to the Board of Trade,
where they had hoped to meet with exchange officials.
   CBOT spokesman Raymond Carmichael said officials were in
meetings and refused to let the farmers enter the building. He
agreed to take the soybeans to exchange officials as a symbol of
their complaint.
   In a news release, Mahlmann said exchange officials had not seen
the lawsuit, but are ``confident in the action taken... by the
board of directors to maintain an orderly liquidation in our July
1989 soybean futures contract.''
   He said board officials ``expect this lawsuit to be proven
frivolous and do not believe it will be of any benefit to the U.S.
agriculture community.''
   ``The Commodity Futures Trading Commission vindicated our action
in their testimony before Congress supporting the exchange's
decision to maintain orderly markets,'' he said.
   The board's order required the liquidation of large positions in
its July soybean futures contracts. The exchange said it issued the
order to make Ferruzzi reduce its holdings in soybean futures
contracts.
   The Board of Trade was widely criticized by farm groups and
traders who saw the value of their futures holdings drop when
soybean futures prices fell sharply July 12.
   AAM attorney John Arens said the lawsuit was filed on behalf of
all farmers hurt by the order, ``about 95 percent'' of the nation's
growers, but that anyone can ``opt out'' if they choose.

   Pressure from the investment group Coniston
Partners is forcing UAL Corp. toward a sale of the airline company,
possibly to a successor to the employee-management coalition that
failed with an earlier bid, analysts said Tuesday.
   Coniston turned up the heat Monday with the first formal step in
its bid to oust 13 of the 15 UAL directors.
   UAL's board responded by re-emphasizing its determination to
maximize shareholder value and authorizing its financial adviser to
``explore potential transactions with third parties.''

police,'' said Bradley, 19.
   Police evacuated the area for three hours while the bomb squad
defused the device.
   The owner of the Mercedes turned out to be Veravat Chotiros, the
British manager of Thai Airways, whose wife said the car had not
been used for days.
   ``Quite obviously, this was a case of mistaken identity,''
Chotiros said. ``My family and I are much relieved that the device
was detected and made safe and that no injuries resulted from the
incident.''
   Defense sources said the bombers were wrong on a second front:
Ramsbotham, based mainly at Salisbury in southern England, is
chauffeured to the Defense Ministry in a military vehicle.
   ``I think he realized that being a target was part of the job
and just shrugged it off,'' said Lady Bruce-Gardyne, who lives next
door and whose husband, John, is a Conservative Party peer. She
said the general and his wife, Sue, have not been home for two
weeks.
   Ramsbotham commanded the 39th Infantry Brigade based at Lisburn,
Northern Ireland between 1978 and 1980. He has been widely rumored
to be up for the army's top job, chief of the general staff.
   The discovery fueled speculation of an IRA pre-Christmas bombing
campaign on the British mainland. Churchill-Coleman warned those at
risk to be extra vigilant, particularly with their cars.
   On Sept. 22, an IRA bomb killed 11 men at the Royal Marines
Music School in Deal on England's southeast coast.
   The Defense Ministry stepped up security following an IRA
bombing at Inglis Barracks in north London in August 1988, in which
one soldier was killed and nine injured.
   But the IRA carried out a triple bombing at a barracks near
Shrewsbury in western England on Feb. 20, slightly injuring one
soldier.
   On March 7, police discovered an arms and explosive cache near
the seaside resort of Scarborough in northeast England where Prime
Minister Margaret Thatcher was to address a meeting of her
governing Conservative Party.

<HEAD>J.C. Penney Quarterly Earnings Up 30.5 Percent</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DALLAS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   J.C. Penney Co. Inc.'s third quarter earnings
jumped 30.5 percent, the nation's fourth largest retailer reported
Tuesday.
   Net income for the 13 weeks ended Oct. 28 was $209 million, or
$1.52 a share, compared with $160 million, or $1.16 in the
comparable period last year.
   Revenue rose 11.1 percent from $3.73 billion last year to $4.14
billion this year.
   The company said its retail sales climbed 12.5 percent, from
$3.61 billion to $4.06 billion. Other revenue fell from $116
million to $80 million, reflecting Penney's jettisoning of its
casualty insurance business.
   For the first nine-months, net income was $435 million, or $3.17
a share, up 17 percent from $372 million, or $2.73, in the same
period last year.
   Revenue so far this year was $11.06 billion, compared with
$10.35 billion last year.
   Retail sales rose from $10 billion last year to $10.84 billion
this year, while other revenue fell from $351 million to $221
million.
   The nine-month results include a $20 million after-tax charge
from the discontinuing of Telaction, an interactive television
shopping service.

<HEAD>Palmtops, Notebook-Size Computers Take Off</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By E. SCOTT RECKARD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LAS VEGAS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Today's hottest computers are portable, from
one-pound palmtops to hefty but high-powered 20-pounders with
handles, sellers said Tuesday at the world's biggest computer trade
show.
   Perhaps hottest of all at the Comdex show are Compaq Computer
Corp.'s six-pound, notebook-size LTE and LTE286 machines.
   ``Sales have been very good, I would say better than expected,''
Rod Canion, Compaq's president and chief executive, said in an
interview.
   Compaq's machines are the first of their size to accept the
3{-inch floppy disks that are standard in many desktop computers.
That's more convenient than other machines that use memory cards or
smaller disks.
   Compaq officials say they have struggled to meet demand in the
month since they introduced the LTE, which begins at about $2,400,
and the LTE286, which runs on a faster 80286 microprocessor and
lists for $3,900 to $5,000.
   Canion said the only compromise was on the screen, which is less
sharp than the one on Apple Computer Inc.'s 14-pound Macintosh
Portable.
   ``What we found was that most people would trade off that
(screen) in return for the small size,'' Canion said.
   Among the competing high-performance notebook-size computers is
the NEC Ultralite, a pioneer when it was introduced a year ago. It
weighs just 4.4 pounds, has a bigger screen than the LTE's, and
costs about the same, with a basic list price of $2,500. Storage of
information is on memory cards.
   Also hot are the one-pound mini-machines known as palmtops or
breast pocket computers made by the Atari and Poqet corporations.
   Atari's Portfolio, which operates on two AA batteries for 48
hours, fits in a jacket pocket and sells for $400. Not intended to
rival its bigger and more expensive cousins, it has five simple
built-in programs.
   At about $2,000, Poqet's palmtop offers a bigger screen and
keyboard, all within the tiny package.
   At the other extreme of the lightweight scale is Dolch Computer
Systems' ``portable'' that uses Intel's new 80486 microprocessor,
the hottest, most powerful chip in the world for personal computers.
   The industrial-looking Dolch weighs nearly 20 pounds, but
company president Volker Dolch says it can compete in performance
with very high-end desktop computers and work stations. He claims
it is more than twice as fast as its closest competitor, the
Toshiba 5200.
   The potential buyers, who Dolch calls ``power users on the go,''
will pay a premium for the privilege of lugging the computer
around. It ranges from about $13,000 to $18,000.

<HEAD>Delta Announces Plans to Buy $10 Billion in New Jets</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Delta Air Lines said Tuesday it plans to buy $10
billion worth of new jets, including 160 of McDonnell Douglas
Corp.'s new MD-90 aircraft.
   The orders and options announced Tuesday are in addition to $13
billion in plane orders announced earlier by the Atlanta-based
carrier. Delta has orders and options now on a total of 519 new
jets.
   Delta Chairman Ronald W. Allen said the new aircraft are needed
to keep the carrier's fleet modern by replacing older planes and to
support the airline's planned expansion in the next decade. The
current fleet has an average age of 8{ years.
   Delta will become the first customer for the MD-90, the latest
in the St. Louis-based aircraft maker's MD series. Delta has orders
for 50 of the jets and options for another 110.
   The McDonnell Douglas jets are scheduled to be delivered
beginning late in 1994.
   The MD-90s will be powered by International Aero Engines' V2500
series engines. For Delta's use, the MD-90s will seat 150
passengers.
   Separately, Business Express Airlines of Westport, Conn., a
Delta connection carrier in the Northeast and eastern Canada, said
it had agreed to buy up to $250 million worth of commercial
airplanes from Saab Scania.
   The plans announced Tuesday by Delta also include orders for 50
Boeing 737s and options for another 50. Delta said these planes
will be delivered starting in 1993.
   Seattle-based Boeing's machinists, however, were in the 42nd day
of a strike Monday that has virtually halted production of new
airplanes.
   The 737-300s will add to Delta's Boeing fleet, which also
includes 727s, 757s and 767s.
   The Boeing 737-300s will seat 120 passengers and will have CFM
International's CFM56-3 series engines.
   Delta said the engines for both the MD-90s and the 737s are
highly fuel efficient and meet the quieter Stage III engine noise
reduction standards.
   The investment in the aircraft includes spare engines and parts,
Delta said.
   Allen, speaking to a convention of bankers earlier this week,
said that Delta plans considerable expansion during the 1990s and
that jet purchases are a major part of the company's strategy.
   ``We have a tremendous amount of growth planned ahead for Delta
Air Lines,'' Allen said. ``Many of these airplanes will be used to
maintain a modern fleet. To do that, of course, we have to keep
replenishing our fleet and replacing our old airplanes.''
   He also said the plans make Delta officials leery of any
involvement in a debt-financed takeover. Delta often is mentioned
as an attractive acquisition target.
   ``We want to be positioned to fly through a recession and to
continue to grow through a recession,'' Allen said. ``We have a big
commitment to (buy new) airplanes. We cannot maintain that
commitment if we're heavily leveraged, particularly during a
recession.''

   Stock prices retreated in sluggish trading
Tuesday amid uneasiness about the economy's weakness and pessimism
about the chances for lower interest rates.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials fell 16.18 to 2,610.25.
   Losing issues outnumbered gaining ones by about 4 to 3 in
nationwide trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed stocks, with
639 up, 831 down and 498 unchanged.
   Volume on the floor of the Big Board came to 143.17 million
shares, little different from Monday's total of 140.75 million.
   Several new reports underscored the economic slowdown,
particularly in the manufacturing sector.
   But the statistics didn't convey a completely clear picture
because they were influenced by special circumstances, analysts
said.
   A slumping automobile market helped drive down retail sales by a
full percentage point in October, the Commerce Department reported.
   Industrial production was crimped during the month by a strike
in the aircraft industry and the impact of the California
earthquake. The decline of 0.7 percent was the steepest in three
years.
   Traders have been hoping that the Federal Reserve Board would
spur growth by loosening its credit policy to a significant degree.
So far, the central bank hasn't made any dramatic moves.
   Stocks of the Big Three automakers sagged after the industry
reported an unexpectedly poor sales performance. Sales of
domestically made cars and light trucks skidded 20.2 percent in
early November compared with a year ago.
   General Motors fell } to 43], Ford dropped { to 44] and Chrysler
was off [ to 20[.
   Among heavily traded blue chips, food and tobacco company Philip
Morris lost 1] to 40~ on word that Sen. Edward Kennedy, D-Mass.,
plans to introduce a bill to bolster cigarette health warnings and
sale restrictions.
   Combustion Engineering led the Big Board's list of actively
traded issues. It declined ] to 38| as nearly 3.9 million shares
changed hands.
   Elsewhere among the actives, Merck pulled back { to 75|, adding
to Monday's loss of 3~ which came on news that heavy research and
sales costs would hurt earnings growth.
   Nationwide, consolidated volume in NYSE-listed issues, including
trades in those stocks on regional exchanges and in the
over-the-counter market, totaled 174.17 million shares.
   As measured by Wilshire Associates' index of more than 5,000
actively traded stocks, the market declined $11.80 billion, or 0.36
percent, in value.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks ended
at 187.51, down 0.71.
   Standard &amp; Poor's industrial index fell 1.94 to 385.09, and
S&amp;P's 500-stock composite index dropped 1.56 to 337.99.
   The NASDAQ composite index for the over-the-counter market
finished at 454.03 or 1.91 points lower. At the American Stock
Exchange, the market value index closed at 371.52, off 0.18.

   Platinum futures prices climbed to six-month highs on the New
York Mercantile Exchange Tuesday, extending a rally that has lifted
the metal's value by more than 6 percent since Nov. 3.
   ``It's been incredible,'' said Nina Lipton, research director
for Platinum Guild International, a platinum trade association.
   On other futures markets, gold and silver also advanced; cocoa
futures plunged; energy, livestock and meat futures were lower; and
grains and soybeans were mixed.
   Platinum futures settled $11.30 to $13.10 higher with the
contract for delivery in January at $525.70 a troy ounce, the
highest price for a near-month contract since May 15.
   Platinum, like gold and silver, has risen sharply in value since
Oct. 13, when a 190-point plunge in the Dow Jones industrials
average sent nervous investors scrambling for the perceived safety
of precious metals. January platinum settled at $491.60 on Oct. 13.
   Analysts said Tuesday's gains reflected strong buying by both
commercial and speculative traders and marked something of a return
to the market by Japanese interests.
   ``Most of the strength came in from the Far East,'' said Peter
Cardillo, commodities trading adviser with Josephthal &amp; Co. in New
York.
   Buying also was fueled by speculation that a report due out
Wednesday from London-based Johnson Matthey PLC, the world's
largest platinum refiner, would project a production shortfall in
1989 for the fifth year in a row.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   The report, released Wednesday morning in New York, projected
1989 platinum production at 3.31 million ounces and demand at 3.43
million ounces, resulting in a projected deficit of about 120,000
ounces to be filled with stockpiled supplies.

   On New York's Commodity Exchange, gold settled $2.20 to $2.40
higher with December at $394.90 a troy ounce; silver was 9 cents to
10.3 cents higher with December at $5.408 a troy ounce.
   Cocoa futures plunged to new 14-year lows on New York's Coffee,
Sugar &amp; Cocoa Exchange on continued trade selling stemming from
indications of greater availability of African-origin cocoa.
   Cocoa settled $13 to $40 lower with December at $941 per metric
ton.
   Oil futures prices fell on the New York Mercantile Exchange,
primarily because of large supplies of gasoline in New York harbor.
   After the close, the American Petroleum Institute released
figures showing a 4.5-million-barrel decline in U.S. gasoline
inventories last week, contrary to expectations for higher
supplies. The API's reported increases of 2 million barrels of
crude oil and 1.8 million barrels of petroleum distillates were
near expectations.
   West Texas Intermediate crude oil settled 9 cents lower to 1
cent higher with December at $19.50 a barrel; heating oil was
unchanged to .31 cent lower with December at 57.45 cents a gallon;
unleaded gasoline was .75 cent lower to .15 cent higher with
December at 50.31 cents a gallon.
   Frozen pork bellies crashed in a technical sell-off on the
Chicago Mercantile Exchange with some contracts settling down the
permitted daily limit of 2 cents a pound.
   Expectations for steady-to-lower cash prices prompted selling of
hog and cattle futures.
   Live cattle settled .20 cent to .72 cent lower witih December at
74.42 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .15 cent to .70 cent lower
with November at 83.05 cents a pound; live hogs were .10 cent ot
.60 cent lower with December at 48.22 cents a pound; frozen pork
bellies were 1.55 cents to 2 cents lower with February at 63.15
cents a pound.
   Grain and soybean futures finished mixed on the Chicago Board of
Trade after a quiet session.
   Wheat settled { cent to 2} cents lower with December at $4.00\ a

   Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. said Tuesday it was
planning a major shakeup in senior management, following a recent
round of up to 800 layoffs, slumping profits and a weak stock price.
   The planned reorganization at Shearson, the second-largest Wall
Street firm behind Merrill Lynch &amp; Co., comes during a lean period
throughout the securities industry.
   But analysts said the spotlight on Shearson stemmed largely from
the 61 percent ownership of the company by American Express Co.,
which reportedly wants to reduce its stake but wants Shearson to be
more profitable first.
   Shearson reported third-quarter earnings of $66 million, but
most of that came from a one-time $77 million pretax gain from the
sale of its Lehman Management Co. and investment banking fees from
Time Inc.'s acquisition of Warner Communications Inc.
   American Express' share of Shearson's third-quarter profit was
$41 million.
   The company also was stung by news that its debt was being
reviewed for possible downgrading and by an accounting scandal last
year at its Boston Co. money-management unit.
   ``American Express is probably furious,'' said Perrin Long, a
securities industry analyst with Lipper Analytical Services. ``With
a 61 percent ownership, it's a drain on American Express'
earnings.''
   A Shearson spokesman said that under the reorganization the firm
will promote a number of younger executives to more prominent
positions and reassign others throughout the company to create a
new identity for the brokerge firm.
   The spokesman, who asked that he not be identified, said the
reorganization will occur within several weeks and will ``broaden
the management and bring along a new generation to ensure the
company is managed as best as possible.''
   ``The process grows out of the fact that the company has grown
and diversified for the past several years,'' he said. ``Don't
think of it in terms of the staff cutbacks from last week.''
   Shearson began laying off some of its 38,500 employees last
Monday and notified others in a two-paragraph newsletter that more
across-the-board cuts were planned. Shearson cited, among other
things, the slowdown of stock market activity since the 1987 stock
market crash.
   The company had declined to say exactly how many employees would
lose their jobs. But officials said privately that as many as 800
people, or 2 percent of the total work force, could be cut. That
would be the largest staff reduction on Wall Street this year.
   A year ago, Shearson laid off about 1,200 employees. Since then
it has trimmed 300 more jobs. Several other Wall Street firms also
have retrenched in varying degrees this past year.
   Last month, Moody's Investors Service Inc. said it was reviewing
the firm's debt with an eye toward a possible downgrading. The
credit rating agency cited increased competition in the securities
business and Shearson's use of large, sometimes risky short-term
bridge loans to finance takeovers and mergers.
   Shearson stock closed up 25 cents at $14.62{ in New York Stock
Exchange trading Tuesday. American Express sold the stock to the
public in March 1987 at $34 a share and hit a low of $12.50 a share
after the October 1987 crash.
   ``Clearly the firm has not been performing up to expectations
and the business, which was sterengthening through the summer, has
taken a turn for the worse,'' said Lawrence Eckenfelder, a
securities analyst with Prudential-Bache Securities Corp.

<HEAD>McCaw Says it Has Lined up Financing for LIN Bid</HEAD>
<DATELINE>KIRKLAND, Wash. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Nearly two dozen financial institutions
have agreed to supply McCaw Cellular Communications with $3 billion
to help McCaw finance its offer for conmtrolling interest in LIN
Broadcasting Corp.
   McCaw said Tuesday that the $3 billion, along with approximately
$1.2 billion of existing cash and marketable securities, provided
McCaw with the funding necessary to close its tender offer for 22
million shares of the New York-based concern.
   In addition, McCaw said it expected to receive approximately
$1.3 billion in a separate sale of some cellular telephone assets
to Contel Cellular Inc., a subsidiary of Contel Corp.
   Proceeds from that sale, expected in early 1990, would go to
reduce bank debt, McCaw said in a news release.
   McCaw has been an unwelcome suitor at LIN, which has taken
various steps to avoid a takeover, including agreeing to merger its
cellular operations with those of BellSouth Corp., the regional
telephone company based in Atlanta.
   In national over-the-counter trading Tuesday, LIN rose 37{ cents
a share to $117 while McCaw fell 75 cents a share to $37.25.
   McCaw said 22 institutions in North America, Japan and Europe
had agreed to put up the $3 billion requested by McCaw, and that
the syndicate would have put up as much as $7 billion.
   In a stormy battle, McCaw has been trying to buy LIN since last
June. Its latest offer, on Oct. 10, was $125 a share for 22 million
shares, which would give McCaw a 50.3 percent ownership of LIN.
   Additionally, McCaw's offer includes a private market value
guarantee, assuring long-term stockholders of full market value for
their remaining shares in five years.
   Shortly before McCaw's financing announcement Tuesday, LIN
issued a news release saying McCaw was required by Securities and
Exchange Commission rules to leave its offer open for at least five
business days after it announced committed financing.
   It said McCaw's offer expiration date of Nov. 17, this Friday,
would not meet the five-day requirement.
   Efforts to reach Donald Guthrie of McCaw's headquarters in
Kirkland were unsuccessful. A woman who answered the telephone in
his office but refused to give her name said the company would have
no comment on whether the expiration date would be extended.
   McCaw is the nation's largest cellular company, serving 45
million parties in 114 markets in 23 states.
   LIN has major ownership interests in cellular markets in New
York, Philadelphia, Los Angeles, Dallas-Fort Worth and Houston.

<HEAD>Fortune Names Top Products of '89</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   It's a small world, getting smaller, Fortune
magazine says.
   Four of the top 11 products the magazine named for 1989 are
small enough to fit in the pocket of a raincoat _ a video game, a
camcorder, a razor and a telephone.
   Another is a version of a product that a couple decades ago
required a separate room to store it: a computer.
   The list, published in the Dec. 4 issue, includes:
   _Nintendo Game Boy: The paperback-sized toy plays the company's
popular video game cartridges, which slip into the back of the
unit. For $89.95, the game with a 2{-inch diagonal screen includes
headphones, cables and the first Soviet-developed video game.
   _Sony CCD-TR5 Handycam: The 28-ounce device costs $1,500. Sony
touts the 8mm camcorder for its automatic features and small size.
   _Mazda Miata MX-5: Waiting lists for the convertible sports car
are reported at up to a year. The Miata lists at $13,800, but
Fortune said some dealers are much charging higher prices.
   _``Batman'': The Warner Bros. summer-release movie already has
brought in $250 million in revenue, making it the fifth-largest
grossing picture in history. Tie-in products, such as the home
video version, could bring the studio another $75 million. Both
Warner Bros. and Fortune are owned by Time Warner Inc.
   _Compaq LTE: The looseleaf notebook-sized computer weighs six
pounds and has the power of the most sophisticated personal
computers. LTE models are priced from $2,399 to $4,999.
   _Motorola Micro TAC Personal Telephone: The portable cellular
phone, which fits in a shirt pocket, weighs just over 12 ounces and
measures 15.8 cubic inches. About half the size and weight of its
closest rival, the telephone costs from $2,495 to $3,495.
   _Cholesterol fighters: Fortune cited products that ``help you
avoid the artery-clogging stuff,'' including cereals containing the
plant psyllium such as General Mills' Benefit and Kellogg's
Heartwise.
   _Epogen: The genetically engineered drug made by Amgen
eliminates the need for frequent blood transfusions for kidney
dialysis patients. It was approved by the federal Food and Drug
Administration this year.
   _Gillette Sensor: The much-ballyhooed razor contains twin
chromium blades individually mounted on tiny springs that adjust to
facial contours. Gillette spent $200 million and 10 years
developing the $3.75 razor.
   _Arco EC-1: Atlantic Richfield Co.'s reformulated fuel is
designed for pre-1975 cars and trucks that produce a lot of
pollution. Arco claims the leaded fuel, which was introduced in the
Los Angeles area in September, could cust pollution from the
vehicles by 20 percent.
   _Hewlett-Packard Co.'s LaserJet IIP: The laser printer is
praised as the the first inexpensive model of its kind, with a list
price of $1,495 and discounted retail price of about $1,000.

<TEXT>
   RJR Nabisco Holdings Corp. on Tuesday reported a
net loss of $447 million for the third quarter as income from its
domestic cigarette business declined.
   The loss compared with a net profit of $355 million, or $1.55 a
share, in the third quarter of last year.
   The consumer products giant was taken private in October 1988 in
a $24.53 billion leveraged buyout by Kohlberg Kravis Roberts &amp; Co.
Therefore, there are no per-share figures for the latest results.
   Revenue for the three months ended Sept. 30 was $3 billion, down
from $3.2 billion a year earlier.
   The company said strong performances by its food and foreign
tobacco businesses were more than offset by the decline in its
domestic cigarette income, caused by a program to eliminate excess
inventories.
   Inventories became inflated because of a practice known as trade
loading, in which the company essentially induced wholesale
customers to buy more product _ in this case cigarettes _ then they
could quickly resell.
   RJR Nabisco decided earlier this year to end the practice, also
used by other domestic cigarette makers and in other industries.
The practice effectively overstated operating profits in RJR
Nabisco's tobacco division by some $250 million in recent years,
the company said.
   Unit sales of cigarettes have been declining in the United
States, helping to bloat inventories that then had to be scaled
back when the company decided to end the practice.
   ``RJR Nabisco made substantial progress in the third quarter,''
Chairman Louis V. Gerstner, Jr., said in a statement. ``Excluding
our decision to reduce U.S. tobacco trade inventories, our food and
tobacco businesses showed excellent earnings growth.''
   Gerstner said the company is ahead of schedule in its program to
divest assets.
   RJR Nabisco recently announced an agreement to sell its Baby
Ruth, Butterfinger and Pearson candy businesses to Nestle Foods
Corp. for around $370 million. It also agreed to sell its Nabisco
food businesses in Spain and Portugal to a Spanish company for
$77.5 million.
   The latest sales brought the company close to its goal of
divesting $5.5 billion in assets to raise cash and reduce debt
amassed in the leveraged buyout.
   RJR Nabisco's products include Oreo cookies, Ritz crackers and
Winston cigarettes. Its major subsidiaries are R.J. Reynolds
Tobacco Co., R.J. Reynolds Tobacco International Inc., Nabisco
Brands Inc. and Planters LifeSavers Co.
   In the first nine months of the year, the company posted a net
loss of $1.01 billion, compared with a net profit of $980 million,
or $4.14 a share, in the same period in 1988.
   Nine-month revenue rose to $9.2 billion from $9.1 billion a year
earlier.
   In line with the divestiture program, the Nabisco International
and Del Monte Foods businesses have been treated as discontinued
operations in both the third-quarter and nine-month results.

   The dollar fell sharply against all key
currencies Tuesday while the West German mark continued to take
center stage in foreign exchange.
   Gold prices, meanwhile, gained ground.
   On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold bullion for current
delivery settled at $393.30 a troy ounce, up $2.30 from late
Monday. Republic National Bank of New York quoted a late bid for
gold at $392.50 an ounce, $2.40 higher.
   Currency dealers said continued signs of an economic slowdown in
the United States helped depress the dollar by renewing speculation
that the Federal Reserve would lower interest rates. A reduction in
interest rates could hurt the dollar's value.
   The government reported Tuesday that retail sales slipped 1
percent in October while industrial production declined 0.7
percentage point that month.
   Dealers, however, said that attention in the marketplace was
again concentrated on cross trading as the mark continued to climb.
They said the flood of East Germans into West Germany has raised
the possibility of higher inflation in West Germany and higher
interest rates there.
   The dollar fell to 1.8540 marks from 1.8615 in London, and to
1.8350 marks from 1.8615 in New York.
   In Tokyo, where trading ends before Europe's business day
begins, the dollar closed up 0.25 Japanese yen to 143.80 yen. It
traded at 144 yen in London, and at 143.05 yen in New York, down
from 143.925.
   The dollar was also weaker against the British pound. Sterling
bought $1.5810 in London, up from $1.5805 late Monday. It traded at
$1.5945 in New York, up from $1.5820.
   Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late Monday's
quotes, included: 1.6175 Swiss francs, down from 1.64145; 6.2280
French francs, down from 6.3135; 1,343.00 Italian lire, down from
1,359.75; and 1.16975 Canadian dollars, down from 1.16845.
   Late dollar rates in Europe compared with Monday: 1.6380 Swiss
francs, down from 1.6410; 6.2925 French francs, down from 6.3140;
2.0925 Dutch guilders, down from 2.1030; 1,357.00 Italian lire,
down from 1,360.50; and 1.1710 Canadian dollars, up from 1.1677.
   Gold fell in London to a late bid of $390 an ounce from $391.25
late Monday. In Zurich, gold fell to $389 an ounce from $390.
   Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold rose $4.34 to a closing bid of
$391.51 an ounce.
   Silver prices were mixed. On New York's Comex, silver bullion
for current delivery rose to $5.408 a troy ounce from $5.297 late
Monday. Silver traded in London at $5.31 an ounce, unchanged.

<HEAD>Downtown Biltmore Hotel Sold to Japanese Group for $219 Million</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Biltmore Hotel, the stately downtown
landmark that has hosted presidents and royalty for 66 years, has
reportedly been sold to a Japanese group for $219 million.
   Biltmore Partners, a limited partnership that owns the 700-room
hotel, agreed to sell it to T.A.T. Los Angeles Ltd., a company made
up of two Japanese firms, the Los Angeles Times reported Tuesday.
The two Japanese entities were not identified.
   Telephone calls to Biltmore Partners offices weren't returned.
   The Biltmore Plaza includes the recently renovated hotel and a
24-story office tower opened two years ago.
   T.A.T. Los Angeles will pay $219 million for the property,
unidentified real estate sources told the Times. The transaction
was expected to be completed within 90 days, with financing
provided by the Industrial Bank of Japan, the report said.
   The Biltmore was built in 1923 for $10 million by a group of
local businessmen. In 1927, it hosted a banquet for the Academy of
Motion Picture Arts &amp; Sciences, a gathering credited with
brainstorming the annual Oscar awards.
   Biltmore Partners bought the aging hotel in December 1984 for
$75 million. The group has spent $200 million on renovations,
including $40 million for the 130,000-square-foot office tower.
   Part of the overhaul converted a wing of the hotel into 235
square feet of additional office space.
   The deal comes on the heels of the sale of another major
downtown hotel, the Los Angeles Hilton and Towers, to a group of
South Korean investors, including Korean Air Lines. The transaction
worth $168 million was completed two weeks ago.
   Meanwhile, foreign ownership of U.S. real estate properties has
gained renewed national attention with the recent purchase by
Japanese investors of Rockefeller Center in New York City.
   The Biltmore is managed by Windsor Hotel Group, which will
continue to serve the hotel under the new owners.

<TEXT>
   The Senate on Tuesday overwhelmingly approved
a three-year $738 million aid package to reinforce efforts by
Poland and Hungary to discard communism and build democracy and
free enterprise.
   The vote was 99-0.
   The Senate action came on the eve of an address to a joint
meeting of Congress by Lech Walesa, leader of Poland's Solidarity
labor union, who is seeking a massive infusion of Western aid to
energize his country's battered economy and shore up its flegling
democracy.
   ``Lech Walesa, this is for you and a free Poland,'' said Sen.
Paul Simon, D-Ill., immediately after the Senate acted.
   ``This bill gives Solidarity a fighting chance to succeed,''
said Simon who was the bill's principal Democratic sponsor.
   ``Polish democracy deserves our firm support,'' Simon said. ``To
this point, our words have generally outstripped our deeds. This
will help change that.
   ``It almost sounds trite to say that what is happening in
Eastern Europe is mind-boggling, but thank God for it,'' said Sen.
Gordon Humphrey, R-N.H., as the Senate's work on the bill neared
completion.
   ``We must do all we can afford, as quickly as we can, to help
make these changes in Eastern Europe irreversible,'' Humphrey said.
   The Senate bill represents a bipartisan compromise over the
scale of the aid plan, an issue that has been contentious from the
start.
   Senate Democrats originally had sought a three-year
authorization level for the two East European nations of $989
million, while Republicans campaigned for a $585 million ceiling.
   All the proposals, including the $840 million authorized earlier
by the House, overshadow the total $455 million proposed in
increments over the last several months by President Bush.
   Asked if Bush favors $738 million in aid for the two countries,
White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said: ``We're generally
supportive. We'd like to get billions, if we had them.''
   The House, meanwhile, provided the first hard cash to back up
the aid made possible by the Senate authorization bill. Lawmakers
passed a foreign aid appropriations measure for the 1990 fiscal
year that included $293 million for the first year of the
three-year aid program, along with another $240 million in stand-by
credit and trade insurance.
   Major elements of the appropriations measure included a $200
million grant to help stabilize Poland's battered economy and $45
million for a private enterprise development fund. Other money
would go for environmental cleanup, agriculture and educational and
cultural exchanges.
   However, the money bill, the product of a House-Senate
conference, remained the subject of a veto threat over unrelated
provisions which the Bush administration opposes.
   The Senate authorization bill builds on key elements originally
advocated by the Bush, including Enterprise Funds to help both
nations move away from communist centralized economies toward
free-market systems.
   The Enterprise Funds, intended to help both countries establish
free-market systems, would allocate $260 million for Poland and $65
million for Hungary.
   In recognition of Poland's serious economic problems, the bill
allocates $657 million for that country over three years. Hungary
would receive $81 million.
   The Senate compromise plan drops a $200 million credit
stabilization plan for Poland which Republicans said would only
increase Poland's large foreign debt.
   The only senator not voting for the aid plan was Spark
Matsunaga, D-Hawaii, who is ill.

<HEAD>Another Report on Ted Turner Interest in Bidding for MGM-UA</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BEVERLY HILLS, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   MGM-UA Communications Co. declined
comment Tuesday on the latest report linking broadcast and cable
executive Ted Turner to efforts to purchase the motion picture
studio.
   The Wall Street Journal, quoting an unidentified executive close
to the company, reported Tuesday that Turner Broadcasting has been
in ``serious negotiations'' for three weeks to buy MGM-UA.
   ``We have no comment,'' MGM-UA spokeswoman Mary Hardy said.
   In Atlanta, Turner Broadcasting System Inc. spokesman Arthur
Sando didn't immediately return telephone calls.
   MGM-UA declined comment last week on a Hollywood Reporter story
that Turner and Tele-Communications Inc., the nation's largest
cable-TV system operator, had initiated preliminary talks about a
joint bid.
   Tele-Communications and its 54 percent-owned United Artists
Communications Inc. affiliate are putting together the latest bid,
possibly in partnership with Turner, the Wall Street Journal said.
   ``All we are saying is that we've been approached on the subject
and we have it under study,'' Tele-Communications Senior Vice
President Robert Thomson told the Wall Street Journal.
   A call was placed to Tele-Communications, which is based in
Denver, but all of the company's top executives were said to be
unavailable for comment.
   Turner bought MGM-UA from Kirk Kerkorian in 1986 and later sold
it back except for most of the rights to the library of MGM films.
Rights to about 1,000 United Artists films are now considered the
company's greatest asset.
   Turner has wanted the UA film library since getting control of
MGM's film library two years ago, the unidentified executive told
the Wall Street Journal. ``He covets the Pink Panther and James
Bond,'' the executive was quoted.
   MGM-UA had agreed to be acquired by Qintex Australia Ltd. in a
$1.5 billion transaction that fell apart last month.
   Others previously expressing interest in MGM-UA include Rupert
Murdoch's News Corp. and Paramount Communications Inc.
   Filmmaking at MGM-UA has nearly halted in the year and a half
since Kerkorian started looking for a buyer.

   Savings and loan regulators undermined a
securities investigation linked to the nation's largest savings and
loan failure, the head of the Securities and Exchange Commission
said Tuesday at a hearing where tearful, elderly witnesses told of
losing their life savings.
   SEC Chairman Richard C. Breeden told the House Banking Committee
that a ``memorandum of understanding'' between the Federal Home
Loan Bank Board and Lincoln Savings and Loan Association, Irvine,
Calif., gave Lincoln's parent company a powerful legal tool to
resist the SEC's probe.
   The SEC was trying to determine if the parent company, American
Continental Corp., headed by Phoenix, Ariz., millionaire Charles H.
Keating Jr., had filed false financial statements.
   However, Breeden said, the May 20, 1988, memorandum of
understanding ``said in essence that the financial statements were
all right'' and allowed American Continental to argue that the
SEC's investigation should be dropped.
   American Continental continued to sell its subordinated debt,
which has proved to be worthless, through Lincoln's 29 branches
until early this year, witnesses told the House panel, in the fifth
of six scheduled hearings on Lincoln's collapse.
   Karl Hoyle, a spokesman for the bank board, now called the
Office of Thrift Supervision, said the memorandum ``in no way could
have impeded'' the SEC investigation. ``They're independent. ...
There's nothing we can do to get in the way,'' he said.
   In sometimes tearful testimony, victims of the failure,
including a partially blind widow and the mother of a brain-damaged
daughter, said in large part they blamed Sen. Alan Cranston,
D-Calif., for their plight.
   Cranston and four other senators are under fire for accepting
large political contributions from Keating before meeting on his
behalf with S&amp;L regulators in April 1987.
   ``I had no idea this man could be so corrupted,'' said Shirley
Lampel, a Tustin, Calif., widow, who testified that an American
Continental employee eagerly offered to drive her to Lincoln so she
could invest her life savings, $30,000, in the holding company's
subordinated debt, which is repayable only after other debts are
satisfied.
   Because she could not see well enough to read the prospectus or
the agreement she signed, Mrs. Lampel said the employee summarized
it for her, but did not mention any risk or loss.
   Mrs. Lampel and most of the 23,000 other Lincoln customers who
purchased $250 million in subordinated debt said they thought they
were purchasing the equivalent of a federally insured certificate
of deposit.
   Another victim, Ramona E. Jacobs of Glendale, Calif., said
American Continental employees assured her the $11,000 in
subordinated debt she purchased was ``secured.'' The money included
part of an insurance settlement paid after an automobile accident
left her 23-year-old daughter brain damaged.
   Murray Flander, a spokesman for Cranston, said, ``We have
nothing but compassion for these people.''
   ``Cranston ... didn't know there had been a bond sale until he
read about it newspapers after Lincoln was closed down,'' Flander
said.
   Breeden told the committee that the SEC did not have enough
evidence by the spring of 1988 t stop American Continental from
issuing the subordinated debt, but is now reexamining its policies
and the law to see if changes are needed.
   He said he has doubled the number of staff members assigned to
investigate Lincoln. Matters related to the investigation have
already been presented to a federal grand jury in Los Angeles, he
said, confirming newspaper reports.
   In next week's Lincoln hearing, Keating and M. Danny Wall, head
of the Office of Thrift Supervision, are scheduled to testify.
   After that, Rep. Henry B. Gonzalez, D-Texas, chairman of the
committee, said he intended to investigate S&amp;L scandals ``beyond
Lincoln.'' Later, he told a reporter the probe would include the
failure of Silverado Savings in Colorado, on whose board Neal Bush,
the president's son, once served.
   In another development, Senate Banking Committee Chairman Donald
W. Riegle Jr., D-Mich., who has played down his connection to
Keating, toured Phoenix real estate projects funded by Lincoln, a
trade publication said Tuesday.
   The previously undisclosed visit in March 1987 included a
helicopter trip to the Phoenician Hotel, a lavish resort then under
construction by Keating, and a visit to American Continental, where
the senator gave a speech to employees, the American Banker
reported.
   The visit occured around the time that Keating was lobbying
vigorously for relief from regulations that limited S&amp;Ls' direct
investment in real estate and other speculative commercial ventures.
   Karolyn Wallace, a spokeswoman for Riegle, said the senator made
the visit because American Continental owned a hotel and other
property in downtown Detroit and ``he considered them an important
Michigan business constituent.''

<HEAD>Striking NYNEX Workers Endorse Settlement Framework</HEAD>

framework, local issues remaining, details; picks up 13th graf, `NYNEX

<TEXT>
   A regional bargaining committee for striking
telephone workers Tuesday agreed to endorse a framework for a
settlement that could end a 14-week-old strike against NYNEX.
   ``It is our hope that we can quickly resolve the remaining
sticking points back at the bargaining tables,'' Jan Pierce, a vice
president with the Communications Workers of America, said at a
news conference.
   Pierce, who heads the regional committee, cautioned that some
remaining local issues could be stumbling blocks as serious as
those resolved regionally. ``We have miles to go before we sleep,''
he said.
   Bargaining was to resume Wednesday. The union has agreed to a
self-imposed deadline of midnight Friday for negotiating regional
and local issues. Eleven committees are discussing local issues.
   Any tentative agreement would have be ratified by Monday, which
would be the earliest time employees could come back to work.
   ``We are happy that we have this understanding and we feel that
it is a fair settlement,'' said John Bonomo, a NYNEX spokesman.
   The CWA, representing 40,000 workers at New York Telephone, and
20,000 International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers members at
New England Telephone struck parent NYNEX on Aug. 6.
   The dispute is the last of a series of strikes by 200,000
workers in 20 states against Baby Bell regional phone companies.
   The settlement offer came out of 19 hours of weekend talks.
   The sticking issue for NYNEX union members had been the proposed
shifting of health costs to workers, ranging from weekly premiums
to $1,500 in yearly family deductibles.
   CWA President Morton Bahr announced Monday in Washington that
the health benefits issue had been resolved and that the framework
for a total settlement had been outlined.
   The settlement called for the company to assume all health
benefits costs, but that was traded for the dropping of a lump-sum
bonus and a profit-sharing plan.
   New York Telephone spokesman Tony Pappas said the $388 million
package would raise wages 3 percent in the first year and 1.5
percent in each of the second and third years with a cost of living
allowance in each year.
   Some of the local issues remaining include the hiring of
non-union personnel and ``concessionary demands'' by NYNEX, Pierce
said. Those include extending the work week on some jobs from 30
hours to 37{ hours at the same pay rate, and eliminating premium
pay for overtime.
   One issue that appeared to be resolvable was the dismissal of 59
people during the walkout, Pierce said. Union and management
leaders agreed to review those cases, he said.
   In addition, a committee composed of Pierce and possibly New
York Telephone President Frederic Salerno will review how to fight
spiraling health costs.
   Pierce said that if costs can't be contained, the issue will
come up again when the contract expires in three years.
   NYNEX Chairman William C. Ferguson said in a statement that the
offer was ``a realistic solution to a very difficult set of issues
facing not only our company but the entire nation.''
   While negotiators met off and on for months, more than 500 acts
of vandalism were reported. NYNEX offered $100,000 for information
on the sabotage.
   Last week, two telephone cables were cut, leaving up to 361,000
customers temporarily without service in southeastern New York
state.
   The strike delayed directory assistance, repairs and
installations for NYNEX's 10.5 million customers in New York, two
cities in Connecticut, Rhode Island, Massachusetts, New Hampshire,
Vermont and Maine.
   NYNEX blamed a third-quarter fall in profits of 14.8 percent
partly on the strike.
   One union member died after a confrontation Aug. 15 at a NYNEX
office in suburban Westchester County. Police said the man jumped
on the hood of a woman's car, pounded her windshield, then fell off
and struck his head. The union charges the driver struck the man as
she sped to work.

<HEAD>Survey: Managers Say U.S. Competition Woes Are Getting Worse</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Business managers across the county say the United
States has serious trouble competing with Asia, and they say the
problem is getting worse, according to a Harvard Business Review
survey.
   The survey, published in the November-December issue of the
magazine, drew responses from about 1,150 readers. The magazine has
a readership of about 200,000, with a large portion occupying high
management positions at companies.
   ``We think this is pretty indicative of how top managers feel,''
said Alan Webber, the magazine's managing editor.
   About 96 percent of the respondents said the United States has a
serious competitiveness problem with its Asian rivals. Of those who
said there is a problem, 85 percent said the situation is getting
worse.
   Furthermore, just over half of the respondents said their own
company has a competitiveness problem, and of those people, 83
percent said the problem is getting worse.
   When asked to point to a reason for the trouble, fewer than 25
percent of the respondents ranked high interest rates or federal
antitrust laws as being ``very important.''
   Instead, many complained about a short-term strategy taken by
many U.S. managers, while Japanese managers take more of a
long-term approach.
   About half of the respondents said restrictive Japanse trade
practices are ``very important'' in causing competition problems.

<HEAD>Turner Reports Income Rises In Third Quarter</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Turner Broadcasting System Inc. on Tuesday
reported a profit of $35.2 million in the third quarter, up sharply
from a loss of $36.5 million for the same period last year.
   Earnings per share for the quarter ended Sept. 30 totaled to 31
cents, compared with a loss of $1.10 per share in the same period
of 1988.
   TBS reported revenues for the period of $269.3 million, up 36
percent from $198 million in the third quarter of 1988.
   For the first nine months of 1989, TBS reported net income of
$40 million, or 8 cents a share, down from $76.4 million, or $2.54
a share, during the first nine months of 1988.
   TBS Chairman Ted Turner said the increased revenues showed the
company was sound. Company officials attributed part of the rise in

<HEAD>Transferred Federal Employees File Suit, Seek Millions From Meredith</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DES MOINES, Iowa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A class-action lawsuit filed Tuesday on
behalf of an estimated 2,000 federal employees seeks millions of
dollars from Meredith Corp. for allegedly cheating transferred
civil servants in contracts to buy their homes.
   The civil suit filed in U.S. District Court by 10 federal
employees and on behalf of all others in similar circumstances
accuses Meredith and its Meredith Relocation Corp. of fraud, breach
of contract, unjust enrichment, restraint of trade and violations
of the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act.
   Last month, the U.S. Justice Department sued the Des
Moines-based media and real estate company, seeking more than $7.7
million for similar alleged violations involving the relocation of
government employees.
   The class-action suit was filed because the Justice Department
said it could not represent individual federal employees with
claims against Meredith, said Jane Lang, a partner of Sprenger &amp;
Land, a law firm with offices in Washington and Minneapolis that
specializes in such litigation.
   ``Our suit is intended to compensate the employees for what they
lost,'' she said.
   Meredith is best known for its Better Homes and Gardens and
Ladies' Home Journal magazines. Its relocation service also is
known as Better Homes and Gardens Family Relocation Service.
   Larry Riley, a Meredith spokesman, said the company stood by a
statement denying wrongdoing that it issued Oct. 25, after the
federal government filed its suit. In that statement, Meredith said
it believed its relocation service acted properly.
   Meredith, which laid off 30 workers at offices in Iowa,
California, Connecticut and Colorado when the contract was canceled
a year early, has its own $6 million claim pending against the
federal government.
   Under a two-year contract signed in May 1986 with the federal
General Services Administration, Meredith agreed to buy homes and
perform other relocation services for transferred federal workers
in 24 central and Western states. The government estimated the
value of the contract at $103.3 million.
   The contract was canceled after one year following a government
audit that the government said disclosed Meredith intimidated
appraisers to lower the valuations of federal employees' homes. The
Justice Department claims that efforts by Meredith to obtain lower
appraisals resulted in delays in the sales of the homes, forcing
employees into accepting distressed prices.
   The class-action suit makes similar claims. It seeks unspecified
actual and punitive damages.

   Automakers and proponents of electrically
powered vehicles touted their wares Tuesday and predicted a future
when motorists will charge up rather than fill their tanks.
   About 200 people, including representatives of two major
American auto manufacturers, gathered to gawk at and drive
prototypes of the first electric vehicles to be produced in
conjuction with the American car industry.
   One vehicle, the G-Van, which will be marketed by General Motors
Corp., is scheduled to begin production next year. Another vehicle,
Chrysler's TEVan, is expected to be available in 1992 or 1993.
   The conference was sponsored by the Electric Power Research
Institute, the research and development arm of the electric utility
industry, which also helped developed the two vehicles.
   From the outside, the electric vans look like their
petroleum-powered counterparts and their proponents claim they
handle like gasoline-powered vans as well. But instead of a
conventional engine and gears, the electric vans operate on a
battery-driven motor that can be recharged by plugging into an
electrical outlet.
   ``We don't want to suggest this is going to turn around
overnight, but we think it will provide an alternative,'' said
Richard E. Balzhiser, president of the Electric Power Research
Institute, which has been working on electrically powered vehicles
since 1979.
   Despite progress, the driving range of the electric vehicles
remains limited when compared to conventional automobiles.
   In the G-Van, for example, which is expected to sell initially
for about $32,500, the lead-acid battery will run for about 60
miles without recharging. The TEVan, which has no suggested retail
price as yet, will use a nickel-iron battery and have a range of
about 120 miles. Both batteries will take about eight hours to
recharge, manufacturers said.
   The top speed for the G-Van is about 52 miles per hour, while
the TEVan will top off at about 65, the designers said.
   Instead of the growl of conventional engines, the electric car
produces a low hum.
   ``After the initial shock of the different noises, everything is
basically the same,'' said Dave Harris, of Chloride Ltd., one of
the companies involved in manufacturing the G-Van. ``People get a
little bit thrown when they touch the gas pedal and they're waiting
for the engine to rev.''
   Electric industry officials were ready with a laundry list of
reasons why Americans should push development of the vehicles.
   Besides the fact that it would open a vast new market for
electric power, experts said electric vehicles would reduce
emissions that threaten the environment with ozone and carbon
monoxide.
   Replacing 1 million gasoline cars with electric cars would cut
down emissions by 150 million tons a year, said Balzhiser.
   A car that runs without gasoline also could reduce the United
States' dependence on foreign oil imports, since electricity can be
generated through several means, including hydro, coal and nuclear
power, said John E. Deegan, a senior vice president of Consolidated
Edison Co. of New York.
   Ken Winters, of Penstar Electronics, a Chrysler subsidiary,
estimated electric vehicles would corner 10 to 20 percent of the
market for commercial vehicles by the second half of the 1990s.
   Response to the cars from conference participants varied greatly.
   ``The most promising stage of electric vehicles for commercial
use that I've seen in the 25 years I've been in the business is
this,'' said Victor Wouk, an electric vehicle consultant from New
York. ``They seem to have solved the major problems that existed in
the past.''
   But Mark A. Reedy of Wisconsin Electric said his utility had no
immediate plans to buy any.
   ``We have some skepticism,'' he said. ``We've had some electric
vehicles in our service areas before and they haven't really
performed adequately. We're just waiting to see how all this shakes
itself out.''
   Jerry Mader, president of the Electric Vehicle Development
Corp., said he was optimistic about future sales.
   He said the corporation has received orders for 185 electric
vehicles since September, when it began soliciting business from
600 utilities across the country.

<HEAD>Japan Semiconductor, Auto Parts Trade Mission To Visit U.S.</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>

   Two Japanese industry groups are sending a trade
mission to the United States to promote purchases of American-made
semiconductors, the groups announced Wednesday.
   About 85 representatives of about 40 Japanese companies will
participate in the 10-day mission, which begins Dec. 6, the
Electronic Industries Association of Japan and the Japan Auto Parts
Industries Association said.
   U.S. semiconductor makers have charged that they have not been
allowed equal access to the Japanese market and that Japanese
companies have not done enough to promote purchases of foreign
semiconductor chips.
   But the U.S. Semiconductor Industry Association, a trade group,
said last week that Japanese companies and government agencies have
begun making serious efforts in recent months to increase sales of
foreign chips.
   Foreign semiconductors account for about 11.2 percent of the
Japanese market, far short of a 20 percent goal mentioned in
negotiations for a 1986 U.S.-Japan semiconductor agreement.
   The trade mission will begin with three days of meetings with
U.S. suppliers in Santa Clara, Calif., followed by visits to
factories, the Electronic Industries Association said.
   The Japanese mission follows a semiconductor sales mission to
Japan last June sponsored by the U.S. Department of Commerce.
   The Electronic Industries Association last week offered to share
information about high-definition television with U.S.
semiconductor makers to allow them to produce chips for a
Japanese-developed HDTV system.
