<TEXT>
   The central government on Friday
dissolved the legislative assembly of opposition-ruled Karnataka
state and put the state under federal rule, news reports said.
   Federal Home Minister Buta Singh told Parliament the move in the
southern state came after the Janata Dal party lost its majority,
the reports said.
   By law, a new state assembly must be elected within a year.
   The Press Trust of India news agency said Singh's announcement
was made amid protests from opposition members.
   Janata Dal, headed by former Defense Minister V.P. Singh, held
111 of the 222 seats in the house. It also was supported by seven
independent members.
   Buta Singh said the party lost its majority after 19 legislators
withdrew support. He said Gov. P. Venkatsubbiah reccomended
dissolution of the assembly to President Ramaswamy Venkataraman.
   PTI quoted Karnataka Chief Minister S.R. Bommai as saying he had
the support of 120 members in the house.
   Bommai, leader of the Janata Dal party in the state, said wide
opposition would arise if the assembly was dissolved, PTI reported
from Bangalore, the capital of Karnataka.
   The federal government is led by Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi of
the Congress Party.

   Authorities defused two homemade bombs, one with a
timing device, found in Moscow subway stations, a Foreign Ministry
spokesman said Friday.
   Gennady I. Gerasimov said the first device was spotted by
passengers in a subway car at the Paveletskaya station. ``The bag
seemed to belong to no one and contained a plastic bag wrapped in a
newspaper,'' he said.
   KGB officers and subway security personnel found a pipe bomb
inside the bag, Gerasimov said. The device was attached to an
electric alarm clock and wired with batteries, he said.
   A similar device, without a clock, was discovered about an hour
later at the Vdnkh metro station, the spokesman said.
   ``Both episodes appear to be linked,'' Gerasimov said. ``The KGB
has begun an investigation.''

<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Responding to demands in Parliament for curbs on
press intrusions into private lives, mainly by Britain's racy
tabloid newspapers, the government on Friday announced an
independent review panel and told editors ``to clean up their act.''
   Home Office Minister Timothy Renton said the panel would report
within a year.
   ``Editors and publishers of the national press in this country
are on probation,'' Renton told the House of Commons. ``They have a
year or two to clean up their act.''
   British media freedom, meanwhile, came under unprecedented
scrutiny at an international conference on Friday, spurred by
charges that Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher's government has
undermined the public's right to know.
   The announcement in Parliament came as the group of editors,
publishers, broadcast executives and journalists debated news media
freedom at a one-day seminar sponsored by the International Press
Institute.
   The watchdog body, which has a membership of 2,000 publishers
and editors in some 60 countries, normally focuses attention on
government harassment of newspapers or journalists in Third World
countries.
   Political charges that the Conservative Party government has
undermined press freedom, and complaints about excesses by mass
circulation newspapers are the two big issues in a growing
controversy about the news media in Britain.
   On the political front, editors cite a government ban on
broadcast interviews with the Irish Republican Army, far-reaching
official secrets laws and a three-year court battle over government
attempts to block publication of ``Spycatcher,'' a retired
intelligence agent's memoirs.
   But newspapers have themselves been increasingly criticized for
sensational stories that boost circulations of the major tabloids,
which each sell more than a million copies a day.
   ``What is disturbing is the fact that the government can get
away with this without the public caring,'' said Max Hastings,
editor of London's pro-conservative Daily Telegraph.
   ``The British public is disenchanted with the press. The chief
issue is how we raise our standards so that the British public will
care about the press.''
   Renton announced the press review panel after a ``right of
reply'' bill foundered Friday in the Commons for lack of government
backing.
   The bill, put forward by a rank-and-file legislator, Tony
Worthington, sought to empower the government to force newspapers
to publish corrections of errors.
   The bill attracted considerable support from government and
opposition legislators, but Renton rejected it on grounds ``it
would introduce a measure of government control over the press.''
   Supporters accused the tabloids of what one called ``replacing
journalism with voyeurism.''
   ``The reporter's profession has been infiltrated by a seedy
stream of rent boys, pimps, bimbos, spurned lovers, smear artists
with grudges, prostitutes and perjurers,'' said Jonathan Aitken, a
rank-and-file Conservative Party legislator. ``This is a cast of
shame.''
   Apart from racy stories about the private lives of people from
TV stars to accident victims, the tabloids regularly incur the
wrath of Buckingham Palace for pursuit of the royal family.
   At the seminar, an American participant, Dana Bullen, director
of the Washington-based World Press Freedom Committee, contrasted
British and American treatment of the news media.
   ``Where there is an Official Secrets Act here, we have a Freedom
of Information Act,'' said Bullen.
   Andrew Neil, editor of London's Sunday Times, the top-selling
upmarket weekly in Britain, led complaints by editors and broadcast
chiefs about government use of court orders. During the controversy
over ``Spycatcher,'' national newsapers were barred at each stage
by orders, called ``prior restraints,'' from publishing.
   ``There is a culture in this country against the freedom of the
press because ... the government and the judges belong to the same
club,'' said Neil, referring to the British establishment. ``We
must have the freedom to publish and then take the consequences.''
   In a series of disputes since Mrs. Thatcher won power in 1979,
the government has also clashed with television networks, usually
over features and documentaries involving the outlawed Irish
Republican Army or the intelligence services.
   Also, media and civil rights groups charge that a bill to reform
the catchall 1911 Official Secrets Act is inadequate. One example
they cite is the government's refusal to allow civil servants who
leak classfied information to argue they acted in the national
interest to expose a government cover-up.
   Earlier Friday, a British delegate at a a meeting of 35 nations
to monitor a recent East-West accord on media freedom said the
attitude of Mrs. Thatcher's government toward the media ``alarms
us.''
   Neal Acherson, a columnist in the Observer, a liberal London
weekly, said the British government tradition of organized
unattributable briefings by officials to domestic political
correspondents conflicted with the East-West accord.
   The accord was signed last January by the 35 nations at the end
of of the Conference on European Security and Cooperation in Vienna.

<HEAD>Dissident Priest, Four Others Removed from Ballot in Moscow District</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The names of dissident priest Gleb Yakunin and
four other announced candidates were removed Friday from a ballot
for the new Soviet parliament, a colleague reported.
   Yakunin, a Russian Orthodox priest, and the four were blocked
from the ballot in a central district in Moscow on grounds they
didn't live or work in the district, said Victor Popkov, a
Christian activist who attended the district meeting at the ZIL car
factory.
   Soviet election laws have no residency requirements. Many of
those already elected to the new Congress of People's Deputies were
selected by organizations they did not belong to or from districts
where they do not reside.
   Popkov said about 750 electors were at the district meeting, and
he said they were picked ``in a crude move on the part of the top
echelon'' of the Communist Party.
   He said the head of the Central Election Commission agreed to
meet Saturday with Yakunin and the other rejected candidates to
hear their complaints.
   None of the five was allowed to present his platform at the
meeting and no election commission member was present to count the
votes, Popkov said in a telephone interview.
   Yakunin was suspended from his religious duties for 20 years and
imprisoned for dissident activities. After more than six years in
prison and exile in Siberia he was released in March 1987 and
assigned to a small parish near Moscow.
   Popov said the four other rejected candidates were two writers,
a criminal investigator and a military officer. The names of 11
candidates were placed on the district ballot.

<HEAD>Fifth Chartered Flight Departs South Padre Island For Central America</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A group of 120 refugees was put on a
jetliner and returned to El Salvador in the latest mass deportation
of illegal aliens by the U.S. Immigration and Naturalization
Service.
   The flight of the INS-chartered Boeing 737 was the fifth such
flight since Feb. 21, when the INS began a crackdown on
undocumented aliens crossing the Rio Grande.
   A previous charter flight of 231 aliens left Texas on March 13
and was believed to be the largest mass deportation by the INS.
More than 1,300 Central Americans have been deported since the
crackdown began.
   The refugees _ some smiling, other sulking _ were processed out
of the INS detention camp near Bayview and filed into four buses
bound for the Brownsville-South Padre Island International Airport.
   There were no Nicaraguans on the flight, although more than a
quarter of the 1,250 detainees at the camp are from Nicaragua.
   Nicaraguans are the only nationality to have escaped the
crackdown, thanks to a directive issued by then-Attorney General
Edwin Meese III, in July 1987.
   Meese requested that the INS encourage asylum applications and
work authorizations for refugees fleeing the leftist Nicaraguan
government. Deportation for Nicaraguans must be approved by INS
headquarters in Washington, D.C.
   Among the immigrants deported Thursday were 68 Salvadorans, 38
Guatemalans and 14 Hondurans.
   The INS said 703 refugees applied for asylum in the Harlingen
district since Feb. 21. Of those applicants, 72 Nicaraguans and six
Salvadorans were granted asylum. The rest were detained to be sent
back to their homelands.

<HEAD>Bush Reportedly Favors Mix of MX, Midgetman</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DONNA CASSATA</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Bush is reportedly planning to
recommend a mix of single-warhead Midgetman and multiple warhead MX
missiles in a budget decision that will determine the future of the
nation's nuclear arsenal.
   A White House source, who declined to be identified, said Friday
that Bush's decision was ``expected to be some kind of mix of rail
garrison MX and Midgetman, but the final mix is to be determined.''
   The decision represents a setback for Defense Secretary Dick
Cheney, who reportedly favored deploying only one mobile missile,
the 10-warhead MX. Bush was supposed to make a final decision this
weekend and inform Cheney.
   Cheney had urged Bush to remove the nation's 50 MX missiles from
their concrete silos and put them on railroad cars to be shuttled
around the country _ an option known as the rail garrison MX. He
reportedly wanted to cut off funding for the truck-mobile Midgetman.
   The decision on the missiles was one of several that must be
made as Cheney tries to cut $10 billion from the Pentagon budget.
   According to congressional and Pentagon sources, both Star Wars
and the B-2 stealth bomber face the budget ax when Cheney announces
his choices at a congressional hearing on Tuesday.
   Cheney plans to scale back work on the B-2, which at recent
estimates of $500 million per plane is the most expensive aircraft
in history, while cutting funding for Star Wars.
   Details on the proposal for the B-2 were not immediately
available, the sources, who requested anonymity, said Friday.
   Star Wars, of the Strategic Defense Initiative, would be cut to
$4.8 billion for the Department of Energy in fiscal 1990. Former
President Reagan, who made Star Wars his top priority, had asked
for $5.9 billion in fiscal 1990 and $7 billion in 1991, a sharp
increase from the $4.5 billion allocated for the program this year.
   The total defense budget stands at $299.2 billion _ $10 billion
less than the budget former President Reagan submitted in January
and in accordance with the cut agreed upon a week ago by the White
House and Congress.
   The defense secretary discussed the shrinking military budget at
a Pentagon meeting with the chairmen and ranking members of the
Senate and House Armed Services Committees and the leaders of the
House Appropriations defense subcommittee.
   Cheney's plan calls for the elimination of funding for the
Marine Corps' V-22 Osprey troop transport aircraft, retirement of
one of two aging aircraft carriers _ the Coral Sea or the Midway _
when the Abraham Lincoln is commissioned in 1990.
   Such a retirement would maintain the Navy carrier force at 14
instead of the 15 sought by Reagan.
   The defense secretary is also planning to shift 24 frigates to
reserve status and cancel $1.4 billion procurement of the F-14D
Tomcat fighter jets. Cheney also retained Reagan's plan to
eliminate funding for the last two submarines in the Los Angeles
class, SSN688, in favor of the newer class SSN21.
   In addition, Cheney plans to mothball a handful of B-52s; delay
the Millstar program, an Air Force's communications satellite
program; and cancel the Army Helicopter Improvement Program. Reagan
had proposed spending $210 million in 1990 for Millstar and $299
million for the AHIP.
   Buys of the Blackhawk UH-60A would be reduced from 83 to 72 and
purchases of the F-15E would be reduced to zero. That program had
been earmarked for $1.7 billion in the fiscal 1990 budget.
   Army force structure would be reduced by 5 percent with cuts in
the number of people employed at headquarters and in procurement.
   Those attending the meeting with Cheney were Sam Nunn, D-Ga.,
chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee; John Warner of
Virginia, ranking Republican on the panel; Rep. Les Aspin, D-Wis.,
chairman of the House Armed Services Committee; Rep. Bill Dickinson
of Alabama, ranking Republican on the panel; Rep. John Murtha,
D-Pa.; and Rep. Joseph McDade, R-Pa., the chairman and ranking
member of the House Appropriations defense subcommittee.

<TEXT>
   The first half of fiscal 1989 ended with a
budget deficit that is running 7.4 percent ahead of last year's,
according to the government's latest report on its financial
situation.
   For the first six months of the 1989 fiscal year, which began
Oct. 1, the budget deficit totaled $128.43 billion, up from the
$119.61 billion shortfall posted in the first six months of last
year, the Treasury Department said Friday.
   The Bush administration is estimating this year's deficit will
total $163.3 billion, up 5.3 percent from the $155.1 billion
shortfall posted in for all of fiscal 1988. Under the Gramm-Rudman
deficit-reduction law, this year's deficit was not supposed to
exceed $146 billion.
   The administration and congressional leaders last week unveiled
a compromise plan designed to reduce the deficit in the next fiscal
year to $99.4 billion, just within the $100 billion target for
fiscal 1990 established under Gramm-Rudman.
   In March, the government posted a $35.78 billion deficit, up
22.2 percent from the same month last year and the highest monthly
shortfall since May 1986.
   Revenues last month were up 3.9 percent from March 1988 to
$68.28 billion, while spending of $104.06 billion was up 9.5
percent.
   Economist Louis Crandall of R.H. Wrightson &amp; Associates in New
York said last month's deficit surge was largely due to technical
factors related to the timing of government payments for tax
refunds and veterans' and disability benefits.
   He said checks totaling $5 billion in tax refunds and $2.5
billion in benefits that normally would have gone out in April were
mailed out at the end of March, artificially inflating the monthly
deficit figure.
   ``If you take out technical factors, last month was right on top
of last year's number,'' Crandall said. ``This points toward an
annual deficit in the $145 billion range, which would be better
than last year and better than most people are currently
expecting.''
   Economist Paul DeNoon of Manufacturers Hanover Trust Co. in New
York said that even setting aside the special factors that inflated
March's shortfall, he expects the deficit this year to be in the
range of $160 billion to $165 billion.
   ``Clearly, it's not doing as well as it was last year,'' he said.
   DeNoon said much of the worsening in the deficit so far this
year has been linked to government payments to help shore up the
troubled savings and loan industry.
   Analysts say the deficit also has increased because of
higher-than-expected interest rates so far this year. The Federal
Reserve Board for a year has been pushing up interest rates in an
effort to slow down economic growth and thus restrain inflation.
   The largest government spending category last month was the
military. Defense spending in March totaled $28.9 billion and
reached $148 billion for the first half of the fiscal year, up 4
percent from the same period during the previous year.
   Spending on Social Security last month totaled $19.5 billion and
reached $111.1 billion for the first six months of fiscal 1989, 5.8
percent ahead of a year earlier.
   Interest on the national debt totaled $16.5 billion last month
and $117 billion so far this year, up 11.2 percent from a year
earlier.
   Health and Human Services programs other than Social Security
cost $16 billion in March and $82.8 billion so far in the fiscal
year, up 6.9 percent from the previous year.
   Spending by the Agriculture Department last month was $3.8
billion and totaled $28.6 billion for the first half of the year,
up 9.7 percent from a year earlier.

   More than a third of the first-grade boys
in rural North Carolina have tried smokeless tobacco, and the
number increases to 70 percent by seventh-grade, a study shows.
   The recent University of North Carolina at Asheville study found
that the most frequently stated reason for using smokeless tobacco
was its taste, followed by peer pressure, a desire to feel ``grown
up'' and the influence of role models such as athletes.
   The study used children in grades one, three, five and seven in
urban and rural schools in western North Carolina.
   ``It was apparent during the administration of our questionnaire
that the first-graders clearly understood what oral tobacco was,''
said Cheryl McClary, co-author of the study. ``In two of the rural
schools, several little boys immediately jumped up to show their
containers of chewing tobacco, which they kept in their back
pocket.''
   State law allows a 6-year-old to buy and use smokeless tobacco
but prohibits the sale of cigarettes or cigarette papers to anyone
under 17.

<HEAD>Victims' Relatives Still Want Probe; Skinner Goes to Europe</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Relatives of Americans killed in the bombing
of Pan Am Flight 103 say they are encouraged by recent government
response to aviation security problems but still want a broad
investigation into the incident.
   Transportation Secretary Samuel Skinner on Friday announced
rejection of calls for an independent commission to look into the
Dec. 21 bombing. He then took off for Europe to meet with
transportation officials in five countries,
   Bert Ammerman, spokesman for relatives of nearly 200 Americans
killed in the explosion over Lockerbie, Scotland, expressed
disappointment with the decision, saying, ``We feel there's enough
information that's been uncovered that only an independent
investigation can deal with appropriately.''
   Ammerman's brother, Tom, was killed in the bombing.
   Among concerns of the relatives are the lack of a public warning
of threats against the flight, security procedures that failed to
detect the plastic explosive which authorities say was believed
planted by terrorists, and inadequate government response after the
incident.
   Ammerman, of Demarest, N.J., said, however, there have been
several positive developments since the relatives staged a rally
and met with Bush and other officials in Washington on April 3,
including steps to improve aviation security. He said the State
Department had agreed to escort relatives who want to visit
Lockerbie.
   Skinner was meeting in Naples, Italy, this weekend with the
administration's nominee to head the Federal Aviation
Administration, Adm. James B. Busey, who is U.S. Navy commander for
Europe, and next week with government and airline officials in
Italy, West Germany, Switzerland, France and England.
   Skinner, in a news conference for foreign journalists covering
Washington, said he would push for security initiatives that would
``encourage international travelers to retain their justified
confidence in the system's safety.''
   Skinner said U.S. carriers have given ``unbelievable attention''
to security and are the safest in the world.
   His spokesman, David Prosperi, said Skinner and other
transportation and security officials were flying most of the way
on a government plane to meet a tight schedule but would likely
make at least part of the trip aboard commercial airliners.
   Skinner, in a letter to Ammerman rejecting the call for a
separate investigation, said, ``For a variety of reasons, we do not
believe formation of an independent commission is necessary or
prudent.'' The letter was accompanied by a five-page outline of
administration action since the Pan Am explosion.
   Skinner said he had confidence in the investigation by Scottish
and West German authorities and the FBI and believed those
responsible for planting the bomb, which investigators have said
was hidden in a radio-cassette, will be apprehended and prosecuted.
   ``I can assure you that in my opinion the investigation is
moving at full speed,'' Skinner said. ``I think that eventually and
hopefully in the not too distant future, the public will know the
full story there.'' He said it was important not to disclose
targets of the investigation or the information being sought.
   Skinner said his trip would review screening given foreign
nationals hired by U.S. airlines abroad and seek diplomatic
approval for installation of devices to detect plastic explosives
in airports used by U.S. carriers abroad.

<HEAD>Bush Extends Economic Sanctions Against Nicaragua</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Bush will continue the economic
sanctions against Nicaragua that were imposed in May 1985 by former
President Reagan.
   Bush said Friday in a letter to House Speaker Jim Wright that
the trade embargo will continue ``as long as these measures are
appropriate,'' but also suggested the sanctions could be lifted if
free elections are held February in Nicaragua.
   ``The trade sanctions are an essential element of our policy
that seeks a democratic outcome in Nicaragua by diplomatic means,''
Bush said in his letter.
   ``The policies and actions of the government of Nicaragua
continue to pose an unusual and extraordinary threat to the
national security and foreign policy of the United States,'' he
said.
   The ban covers imports of Nicaraguan goods into the United
States and exports by U.S. firms to Nicaragua _ except goods
destined for the Contra rebels who have fought for eight years to
overthrow the country's Sandinista government.
   The presidential order also prohibits air and ship traffic
between the two countries.
   Bush's order came as a group of members of Congress, both
Democrats and Republicans, sent a telegram to Nicaraguan President
Daniel Ortega on Friday, criticizing the law Nicaragua adopted this
week to govern its elections scheduled for next February.
   The telegram, sent by a group led by Rep. Frank Guarini, D-N.J.,
said the law is ``biased, unfair and designed to monopolize power
rather than seek national reconciliation.'' An aide to one of the
sponsors provided a copy.
   It calls on Ortega to meet jointly with political opposition
leaders and come up with a new election law to comply with the
peace plans adopted by the presidents of the four Central American
democracies and Ortega in Esquipulas, Guatemala, in 1987 and in
Tesoro Beach, El Salvador, this year.
   The Bush administration also has expressed strong displeasure
with the new election law, contending it gives the Sandinista
government and its candidates an unfair advantage. The State
Department said the Sandinistas will dominate the electoral council
that will run the elections.
   Internal opposition parties and the Contra rebels also have
strongly criticized the new law.
   An administration source, who commented on condition he not be
named, said the administration was particularly displeased that
Ortega did not meet jointly with the opposition leaders to work out
an agreeable election plan, instead meeting with them one at a time
and then pushing the Sandinista proposal, a complaint also made by
the Congress members who sent the telegram.
   ``If Nicaragua implements its Esquipulas commitments and holds
free, fair and honest elections, I believe the emergency that
prompted the prior administration to impose the trade sanctions
would largely be resolved,'' Bush wrote.
   Bush's letter reviewed the trade situation with Nicaragua since
the last administration report of Nov. 9.
   Those signing the congressional telegram include Reps. John
Spratt, D-S.C.; Rod Chandler, R-Wash.; Dave McCurdy, D-Okla.; Tom
Carper, D-Del.; Ike Skelton, D-Mo.; James Slattery, D-Kan.; Roy
Rowland, D-Ga.; Steve Gunderson, R-Wis.; John Miller, R-Wash.;
Beverly Byron, D-Md., and Robert Lagomarsino, R-Calif.

   The American Telephone &amp; Telegraph Co. is
seeking court permission to enter the complex of computer data,
videotex, financial and other information services known as
electronic publishing.
   A brief filed Friday with U.S. District Judge Harold Greene said
the leading firms in the electronic publishing industry ``are
large, financially strong corporations'' that could withstand
competition from AT&amp;T.
   AT&amp;T also said there were other companies than AT&amp;T, such as MCI
Communications Corp. and US Sprint, to deliver data for the
electronic publishers.
   The court order breaking up the old Bell System had banned AT&amp;T
from electronic publishing, but the AT&amp;T brief said that in 1982
Greene stated he intended to lift the ban after seven years.
   Greene said the burden after seven years would be on any
opponents of removal ``to show that competitive conditions clearly
require the maintenance of the ban,'' AT&amp;T's filing said.
   AT&amp;T spokesman Herb Linnen said the leading firms include
Knight-Ridder (online database services), Citicorp, Dow Jones and
Reuters (securities quotations and financial information), Dun &amp;
Bradstreet and TRW (credit data) and General Electric and IBM and
Sears (videotex services).
   Linnen said AT&amp;T had no current plans to enter the electronic
yellow pages and television businesses _ two areas that are of
special concern to the seven regional Bell telephone companies that
were spun off from AT&amp;T in 1984 and to the broadcast and cable TV
industries.
   ``We have no specific business plan in mind,'' Linnen said. ``We
have no current plans to provide services via yellow pages, and
this (court filing) is not motivated by any current plan to get
into television.''
   The company said ``There are now `means other than AT&amp;T's
network for the transmission of the messages of electronic
publishers,' and those firms providing electronic publishing
services unquestionably have `sufficient strength to permit them to
compete.'''
   Citing MCI and Sprint, it said ``it is beyond serious dispute
that these carriers offer ample alternatives to all of the AT&amp;T
interexchange transmission services used by electronic publishers.''
   MCI officials did not immediately return calls for comment.
   Bill McCloskey, a spokesman for one of the seven regional Bell
companies, BellSouth, said company officials had not seen the
filing and could not comment.
   Robert L. Smith Jr., executive director of the Videotex Industry
Association, said if AT&amp;T could be a ``potentially very important
participant'' in electronic publishing, ``and I think probably the
one area to watch out is if they use this as an opportunity to get
into electronic yellow pages.''
   Noting that the regional Bell companies are banned from this
area, he said a ``vacuum'' existed there.
   Greene's breakup order, as modified, defines electronic
publishing as owning, originating, compiling or editing information
content that is transported over AT&amp;T's facilities.
   In 1987, Greene gave the regional Bell companies permission to
transmit but not originate information services, which, besides
electronic publishing, also include data processing and related
computer services.

   Health and Human Services Secretary Louis W.
Sullivan gave his approval Friday to a plan by federal scientists
to wipe out tuberculosis in the United States by the year 2010.
   ``I challenge you at CDC to carry out the strategies necessary
to accomplish that goal,'' Sullivan said in a speech to employees
at the Centers for Disease Control.
   The contagious lung disease attacked more than 22,000 Americans
last year.
   TB can be cured in most cases with drug therapy, but has become
a growing public health problem in recent years, in part because of
the spread of AIDS _ which weakens the immune system, allowing TB,
among other diseases, to develop. Scientists estimate that about 10
million Americans are infected with TB bacteria, but the vast
majority never get the disease.
   The Advisory Committee for the Elimination of Tuberculosis,
created by the Department of Health and Human Services in 1987,
calls for more effective use of existing prevention and control
programs, development of new diagnosis and treatment techniques,
and rapid transfer of new technology into widespread medical use.
   Sullivan, who was president of Atlanta's Morehouse School of
Medicine before being appointed secretary of HHS by President Bush,
also visited the new national headquarters of the American Cancer
Society, across the street from the CDC compound.

   Firefighters quelled a brush fire that
erupted Friday over 1,200 acres of the Pike National Forest and
forced the evacuation of more than 200 homes in scattered
subdivisions near Colorado's foothils, authorities said.
   There were no reports of injuries or of damage to houses, said
Craig A. Coultas, spokesman for the Woodmoor-Monument Fire
Protection District.
   About 175 firefighters from 20 agencies converged on the area
about 20 miles north of Colorado Springs after the blaze broke out
shortly after noon in the Mount Herman Estates, in unincorporated
El Paso County, he said.
   ``We do have it under control with 20 to 30 spot fires within
the perimeter,'' he said. On Saturday, he said firefighters would
overhaul the fire and finish the job. The cause of the blaze was
unknown, he said.
   Coultas said structures in three subdivisions were evacuated in
front of the fire burning grass, brush, scrub oak and pines.
   ``The terrain has given us more fits than anything else,''
Coultas said. ``Fire tends to move up and so it's following the
contours of the land, moving up the side of the mountain.''
   An air tanker was dropping fire retardant on the periphery of
the blaze and helicopters were pulling water from Monument Lake to
drop on the fire. Another air tanker was en route from Arkansas to
join the fire fighting.
   Officials said the rough terrain also was preventing workers
from bringing in bulldozers to build fire lines, so axes and small
hoses were being used.
   El Paso County sheriff's spokesmen predicted it would take three
or four days to quench the fire.
   The National Weather Service said Colorado's rangeland fire
danger was ``extreme'' as record high temperatures were reported
Friday in eastern Colorado and the fire danger was high in the
mountains.

   The United States must pressure Syria to stop
the shelling that has killed hundreds in Beirut and made life for
the survivors virtually unlivable, according to 2,000 Lebanese who
demonstrated across from the White House.
   ``It's a total breakdown of everything,'' said May Rihani, a
Washington D.C. consultant who visited her family in Beirut in
September. ``No work, no school, no electricity.''
   ``It's unbearable, unpredictable, unlivable'' since Syrian
forces began bombarding Beirut's Christian enclave in early March,
said Samuel Ibrahim, a Lebanese-born Chicago businessman who also
has relatives living there. ``It's inhumane to shell ... peaceful,
innocent people,'' he said.
   The demonstrators came to Washington on Friday from across the
United States and Canada, and were organized by a variety of
pro-Lebanese groups.
   Marching in Lafayette Park across the street from the White
House, they carried signs and sang the Lebanese national anthem
amid chants of ``President Bush, Save Lebanon.''
   The International Movement for the Liberation of Lebanon, an
organizer of the demonstration, said in a letter to Bush it was
disappointed by a statement by Secretary of State James A. Baker
earlier this week that the United States can do little at present
to help Lebanon.
   Bush told reporters Thursday he wished there were ``some
dramatic plan'' to stop the violence. ``The problem _ the short-run
of it _ how you stop this firing, the shelling, how you get
factions to stop warring, has certainly in recent times defied
solution,'' Bush said. ``But we can't give up on it.''
   Several demonstrators suggested the United States could use
diplomatic or economic pressure in an effort to force Syria to
withdraw its 40,000 troops from their country.
   At least 270 people, mainly civilians, have been killed and
nearly 1,000 wounded in shelling since March 8. More than 150,000
Christians and Moslems have fled Beirut out of fear of fighting or
due to shortages of food and fuel.
   Elia Sarkis, a Boston businessman who brought his 11-year-old
son to the demonstration, said he believes that if Syria withdrew,
the warring Lebanese religious and ethnic factions would find a way
to form a workable government.
   ``A federation of religious, ethnic communities ... that's the
ideal new Lebanon that we're looking for,'' Sarkis said.

   In all, the Army, Navy, Marine Corps and Air Force reported
2,116,889 men and women on active duty as of March 31, down from
the 2,122,636 on Feb. 28, according to Pentagon figures released on

   A reduction was ordered in early 1988 by the Reagan

   Former Labor Secretary Raymond Donovan is
asking an appeals court panel to order the federal government to
pay $112,281 in legal bills he says he incurred during an
investigation of an alleged kickback supposedly paid Donovan in
1977.
   Donovan and his lawyers say the legal fees and expenses are for
the period March 1987 through October 1987 in connection with the
probe by independent counsel Leon Silverman.
   Federal law on independent counsels provides for the government
to pay legal fees if the subject of the criminal investigation
isn't indicted.
   Donovan was cleared in the probe of accusations that he lied
when he denied knowing anything about the alleged kickback scheme
which involved a former supplier of Schiavone Construction Co.
where Donovan was working at the time.

<TEXT>
   The rape and beating of a jogger has reinforced
the reputation of Central Park as a haven for criminals, which city
officials say is an unfair stereotype of America's most famous
urban park.
   ``Generally, crime in the park is low. It is safe to jog in
Central Park,'' said police Chief of Detectives Robert Colangelo
after the Wednesday night attack by a marauding gang of teen-agers
left a 28-year-old woman near death.
   ``There's danger in jogging anywhere,'' Colangelo said. ``But we
don't feel it's inordinately dangerous here.''
   The park's reputation for illegal activity has been reinforced
in recent years by several highly publicized incidents: Jennifer
Levin's 1986 strangling by ``preppie killer'' Robert Chambers, a
shooting a month earlier that left a police officer, Steven
McDonald, paralyzed, and a 1983 free concert by Diana Ross that
drew packs of thieves.
   The victim of the latest attack, an investment banker, remained
unconscious on life-support systems Friday at Metropolitan
Hospital, said hospital spokeswoman Aura Retamoso.
   The woman lost roughly three-quarters of her body's blood in the
attack, and suffered a fractured skull, severe head lacerations,
brain contusions, fractured facial bones and bruises from head to
toe in the assault by a dozen teens, said Dr. Robert S. Kurtz,
assistant chief of surgery at the hospital.
   Kurtz said that on Friday her pulse rate ``went way up'' when
her mother spoke to her. ``So at some level she's processing
information today which she wasn't doing yesterday,'' he said.
   He said the next four days were crucial for her health, but
added ``she has a fighting chance of making a full recovery.''
   Seven teen-agers were arrested Friday and charged with attempted
murder, rape and assault in the attack. Police said additional
arrests were expected.
   Colangelo said the woman was attacked by some members of a group
of 32 teens who went to the park Wednesday night to ``raise hell,
attack joggers, steal bicycles.''
   Within 10 minutes, they had assaulted three men, including a
jogger and a homeless man. They later split up into three groups
after spotting a police cruiser and terrorized at least nine people
during a two-hour period.
   Colangelo said the youths told investigators the crime spree
resulted from a pastime called ``wilding.''
   ``It's not a term that we in the police had heard before,'' the
chief said. ``They just said, `We were going wilding.' In my mind
at this point, it implies that they were going to go raise hell.''
   ``Central Park is the focus of national attention. Every
incident that happens there is news _ especially if it's grisly,''
Parks Commissioner Henry Stern said Friday.
   Last year, police had reports of 51 assaults and 13 rapes in the
park, compared with 71,030 assaults and 3,412 rapes citywide.
   Of last year's attacks in the park, a dozen involved joggers; in
1987, 13 joggers were assaulted in the park. The rape Wednesday was
the third rape reported this year in Central Park, police said.
   Officials say the crime reports for the park are low for an area
larger than the country of Monaco. On a busy day, hundreds of
thousands of people pass through the park.
   Officials acknowledge the park has dangers after dark.
   ``It's safer to use it by day,'' Stern said. But he said,
``People shouldn't give up on the park any more than you would give
up on air travel because of a plane crash.''
   Fred Lebow, head of the New York Road Runners club, tells
evening joggers to avoid the northern area of the park, where the
Wednesday attack occurred. That area, bordering on Harlem, has more
rugged terrain and hiding places for criminals.
   Lebow's warning is based on history: One of his group's members
was raped in almost the same spot while jogging through the park
five years ago.
   Mayor Edward I. Koch also sounded a warning Friday about
jogging: ``If you do it in some parts of this town, you're
endangering your physical well-being, maybe occasionally even your
life.''

<HEAD>Sailor Assails Compensation Plan For Injuries</HEAD>
<DATELINE>JACKSONVILLE, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A sailor injured when missiles ripped
into the USS Stark as it patrolled the Persian Gulf says the $7,500
the government is trying to get him as compensation is insulting.
   ``All this for $7,500?'' said Bill McLeod, who spent more than
11 hours in the gulf nursing his injuries and fighting off sharks
following the May 1987 attack.
   ``I'm starting to wonder was it all worth it,'' he said. ``It'd
be better off as far as compensation goes to go out and get in a
car wreck.''
   McLeod heard last month that the Iraqi government had agreed to
pay $27.35 million to the families of the 37 Navy sailors killed
aboard the Stark, and thought he would be compensated as one of the
22 sailors injured.
   McLeod received a letter from the State Department on Thursday
that said the United States would seek $7,500 for his injuries from
the Iraqis.
   The State Department would not comment on the total amount being
sought for the injured sailors.
   McLeod and the other sailors were injured when two Exocet
missiles fired by an Iraqi warplane hit the Stark in May 1987.
   He and three other sailors were thrown from the ship by the
blast.
   McLeod, who was awarded a Purple Heart, spent two weeks in a
wheelchair before returning to light duty.
   ``I think it's a ripoff. It's an insult,'' he said. McLeod and
his wife Rosa ``were thinking about $30,000 to $40,000 would be
about right.''
   The State Department letter invites McLeod to submit additional
information if he believes the claim is unjust.
   McLeod left the Navy after his enlistment expired in November
1987. The Navy paid his hospital bills plus $3,200 for personal
items lost on the ship.

   Zargana said in a telephone interview today that he was kept in
solitary confinement but was not otherwise mistreated.
   ``The authorities explained to us yesterday why the military had

   Armed forces commander Gen. Saw Maung seized power in a coup

   Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis was ``like a hungry
vulture'' when the subject of money came up at the funeral of her
second husband, Aristotle Onassis, according to a new book that
quoted the late Christina Onassis.
   ``A Woman Named Jackie,'' an unauthorized biography written by
C. David Heymann, details the former first lady's spending sprees
and said money was discussed at Onassis' funeral in 1975. The book
is being serialized in the weekly Star, a supermarket tabloid.
   Mrs. Onassis' brother-in-law, Sen. Edward Kennedy, rode in the
funeral limousine with her and Christina Onassis, Aristotle's
daughter.
   Christina, who has since died, told Heymann that Kennedy turned
to her and said, ``Now, it's time to take care of Jackie,'' the
Star reported in its Monday edition.
   ``It seemed almost inconceivable that Ted Kennedy would choose
that moment to discuss financial matters,'' said Christina. ``But
it was Jackie's hyena-like smile that drove me from the car. She
was like a hungry vulture waiting to feast on my father's flesh.''
   The book also says Onassis plotted with photographers to publish
candid, nude photographs of his wife so she would stop complaining
about tamer shots taken by papparazzi.
   Nancy Tuckerman, spokeswoman for Mrs. Onassis, said when the
first part of the series appeared last week that the former first
lady would have no comment.

<HEAD>Principal Removes Jars Of Fetuses From Seventh-Grader's Exhibit</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A school principal prevented a
seventh-grader from displaying her anti-abortion science project,
which consisted of 10 jars of human fetuses, saying the
award-winning exhibit was too much for his students.
   Carrie Walker placed the jars, which contained fetuses from
pregnancy stages ranging from 6 weeks to 5{ months, on her exhibit
table Thursday at Pi Beta Phi Elementary School, said Principal Al
Cardiel.
   ``To an untrained eye, the (fetus) 5{ months along was
definitely a child,'' said Jim Wade, curriculum director for Sevier
County schools.
   The girl said she got the fetuses, which were kept in
preservative solutions, from her uncle, a pathologist. The girl's
mother said the fetuses came from miscarriages.
   Cardiel said he learned of the exhibit early that morning as
students were setting up their projects for the school's annual
science fair, which this year has the theme ``Life Science.''
   ``The project was very inappropriate for the age group here,''
Cardiel said.
   He said he first conferred with Carrie's mother, Donna Walker,
who teaches art at the school. The project was removed from the
fair after it was graded and given a blue ribbon but before classes
had a chance to view it, said Sevier County School Superintendent
Jack Parton.
   Parton said he agreed with Cardiel that most of the
schoolchildren were too young to understand the ideas and points
behind the exhibit. Parton also said recent, nationwide political
debate over abortion played no part in the principal's decision to
yank the display from the fair.
   The school is located in Gatlinburg, an East Tennessee resort
town of about 3,000 people. About 430 students in kindergarten
through eighth grade attend the school.

   The transition from Jose
Napoleon Duarte's Christian Democratic government to Alfredo
Cristiani's rightist administration is not going smoothly.
   Assassinations, bombings, death-squad style murders and mass
roundups of leftists have further disturbed a political climate
that has been roiled by nine years of civil war.
   Marxist-led guerrillas have vowed to make the country
``ungovernable'' by June 1, when Cristiani takes office.
   The 41-year-old leader of the rightist Republican Nationalist
Alliance, or Arena, handily defeated the centrist Christian
Democratic candidate in last month's presidential election.
   Arena and U.S. officials have blamed the rebel Farabundo Marti
National Liberation Front, or FMLN, for three recent assassinations
of rightists and a bomb attack on the home of the
vice-president-elect.
   Attorney General Roberto Garcia Alvarado was slain Wednesday by
a bomb placed on the roof of his car when it stopped at a traffic
light.
   The targeting of high-profile individuals _ a tactic not
routinely employed by the guerrillas in the past _ appears designed
to provoke and undermine Cristiani. But who is doing it and why
remain unclear.
   The guerrillas have neither claimed nor denied responsibility
for the killing of Garcia. They did, however, deny responsibility
for the April 14 bombing of vice president-elect Francisco Merino's
house.
   Both Cristiani and U.S. Ambassador William Walker have blamed
the recent wave of violence on guerrillas determined to provoke a
harsh, repressive response from security forces.
   According to this view, guerrilla sympathizers in the United
States and Europe would point to a surge in rights abuse as reason
for a cutoff of U.S. aid.
   El Salvador receives about $1.5 million a day in U.S. economic
and military assistance _ more than any other country in the
Western Hemisphere.
   Some still-active Arena leaders have been linked to death squads
that in the early 1980s killed thousands of suspected leftists. The
insurgents continue to refer to Arena as ``the death-squad party.''
   Arena denies the charge and Cristiani says the eight-year-old
organization has evolved into a modern, conservative party similar
to the U.S.'s Republican Party.
   But Arena continues to harbor a far-right wing. Whether the
Cristiani faction of relatively moderate and modern capitalists
wins out over oligarchic and fascist-minded elements remains to be
seen.
   ``An extremist sector of the right hopes to subjugate Cristiani
and impose a hard military and political line,'' Ignacio Ellacuria,
rector of the prestigious Jesuit-run Central American University,
said Friday.
   Left-leaning unions and other ``popular organizations'' have
condemned what they say is an increase in repression in recent
weeks. Elementary school teacher Cristina Gomez was abducted from
her school, tortured and killed April 5 by heavily armed men in
civilian clothes acting in broad daylight, apparently confident
they would not be challenged by security forces.
   Police and army troops on Wednesday and Thursday raided a union
headquarters, the headquarters of a displaced person's group and
the offices of a women's association. More than 70 people were
arrested.
   ``The escalation of repression demonstrates the desperation
being felt by the rich and powerful. They're starting to feel the
effect of the war and see their riches in danger,'' said Tomasa
Ruiz, a member of the directorate of the raided refugee center.
``So they declare war on the people.''
   Cristiani said his government will act resolutely, but within
the law, to ensure law and order.
   Defense Minister Gen. Eugenio Vides Casanova, who met Thursday
with lawmakers to discuss possible legislation to combat
organizations considered guerrilla fronts by the military, said he
does not believe the current level of violence requires the
imposition of a state of siege.

   A Soviet skimmer swung into action Friday
but collected no oil as a number of fishing boats waged their own,
low-tech fight against America's worst oil spill.
   While the 425-foot Vaidogubsky plied the rough seas off the
Kenai Peninsula, Kelly Duncan shook his head in disgust over his
53-foot fishing vessel with its holds full of oil sucked from
Resurrection Bay.
   ``I got all the evidence of the oil spill you could want right
here,'' said Duncan, 29, of Kasilof. ``It's death and destruction.
People look at it and it makes them sick.''
   Duncan's boat, Sea Quest, was docked in a contamination zone of
Seward's small boat harbor while state and Coast Guard officials
debated what to do with the 7,500 gallons Duncan said he sucked up
in 16 hours Thursday.
   The Soviet skimmer spent Thursday testing its equipment and
steamed for Gore Point where large pools of oil have gathered.
Coast Guard spokeswoman Kathleen Donohoe said the Soviet skimmer
was to begin retrieving its first oil today.
   A total of 48 skimmers, most in the 36-foot to 42-foot range,
were working on stretches of oil floating in Prince William Sound
and the Gulf of Alaska. Heaviest concentrations were in the sound,
at Gore Point on the Kenai Peninsula and on the west side of Kodiak
Island.
   Local fishermen have been pulling their boats up to oil
contained by plastic booms, dipping the crude up with scoops and
buckets and then stacking the buckets on the sterns of their boats.
   Coast Guard petty officer Brad Smith said delays unloading the
oil were widespread and slowing progress on cleaning up the oil. He
declined comment on whether more barges were needed and referred
the question to Exxon.
   Rick Coleman, a spokesman for the oil company in Valdez, said
four barges in Prince William Sound and another near Seward had a
combined capacity of almost 8 million gallons. Another barge was to
join them, he said.
   Another Exxon spokesman, Henry Beathard, acknowledged there were
long delays in loading recovered oil from skimmers onto the barges.
He blamed that on the thick consistency of recovered oil, which he
likened to taffy.
   Exxon also was under attack from environmentalists upset with
the oil company's reluctance to open a sea otter treatment center
at Seward.
   The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service said Friday it had written
Exxon strongly re-emphasizing the need for a second treatment
center in addition to one at Valdez.
   Spokesman Bruce Batten said his agency first asked for a center
April 7, and asked that it be completed by Sunday.
   ``We're not really in a position where we can order them to do
it, but we finally felt compelled to put it in writing,'' he said.
Batten said the service is expanding its effort to rescue
oil-coated otters off the outer coast of the Kenai Peninsula.
   The Center for Marine Conservation estimated about 200 oiled sea
otters have been found along the southern shoreline of the
peninsula by fishermen. Altogether, the Fish and Wildlife Service
has observed 3,406 dead shore birds, 409 dead sea otters and four
dead bald eagles.
   ``The devastation yet to come from the Exxon Valdez spill could
be enormous,'' said Roger McManus, president of the Washington,
D.C.-based environmental group as he pressed for the second otter
center.
   The Exxon Valdez rammed Bligh Reef March 24 and spilled 10.1
million gallons of oil it had loaded in Valdez, the southern
terminus of the Alaska pipeline.
   Delays in responding to the spill contributed to its spread, and
some of the oil seeped out of the sound into the Gulf of Alaska and
moved southwest to the Kenai Fjords National Park.
   The ecologically sensitive region is home to large populations
of marine mammals and seabirds. Biologists say thousands of birds
and hundreds of sea otters have died, although an exact figure is
unobtainable.
   The oil continued to spread southwest Friday to Kodiak Island
and beyond, said Pete McGee, a spill cleanup coordinator for the
Alaska Department of Environmental Conservation.
   Kodiak is the No. 1 fishing port in the nation as well as home
of the world's largest concentration of brown bears, many of which
are just emerging from winter hibernation.

   More than 100,000 students peacefully left
Tiananmen Square on Saturday after staging 15 hours of protests
demanding democracy and an end to dictatorship in China.
   Student leaders decided to withdraw from the square at about
1:45 p.m. (12:45 a.m. Saturday) after officials reopened the square
to ordinary crowds that had swelled by the tens of thousands and
become increasingly unruly.
   Earlier the students, raising their fists and chanting ``long
live freedom,'' confronted the Chinese leadership as they filed
into a memorial service for ousted party leader Hu Yaobang in the
Great Hall of the People beside the square.
   The death of Hu, 73, from a heart attack last Saturday has
sparked massive student protests.
   The students Saturday afternoon marched out of the square waving
colored banners, calling for democracy and chanting ``arise
citizens.''
   Traffic was stopped along Changan Boulevard, the capital's main
avenue, and people climbed trees to get a better view of the
procession.
   The students said they would go back to their campuses and begin
a boycott.
   They shouted ``Down with dictatorship!'' again and again.
   Demonstrators filled a street dividing the square from the Great
Hall, which was guarded by a triple line of People's Liberation
Army soldiers.
   Party General Secretary Zhao Ziyang, Hu's successor, delivered a
10-minute address at the memorial service. He said Hu ``worked
unswervingly'' for the party and Marxist ideals during his 60-year
revolutionary career,
   About 4,000 mourners, led by senior leader Deng Xiaoping and
members of the Politburo, attended the ceremonies.
   Hu's body was draped in the red flag of the Communist Party.
Most of the mourners wore Mao jackets and trousers but Hu was
dressed in a Western suit.
   Zhao made no specific mention about Hu's ouster, but said he was
a man ``brave enough to admit his mistakes and to insist upon what
he thought was right. He never tried to hold back his own
opinions.''
   Zhao praised Hu's ``unusual courage and resourcefulness'' in
redressing the wrongs done to intellectuals and other citizens
during the radicals' 1966-76 Cultural Revolution.
   Deng Xiaoping, 84, walked around the casket and shook hands with
Hu's wife.
   The student rallies have filled Tiananman square since Monday
and are much larger than pro-democracy demonstrations in the winter
of 1986-87 that led to the ouster of Hu, an outspoken reformist.
   ``Long live democracy, long live freedom, down with bureaucracy,
down with corruption!'' the students chanted as the officials
entered the Great Hall.
   The students also yelled, ``Severely punish strong-armed
tactics!'' a reference to purported police beatings of some
students during a clash in front of the nearby Communist Party
headquarters Thursday morning.
   Chinese observers said the overnight demonstration on the square
was one of the largest of its kind ever since the Communist victory
over the Nationalists in 1949.
   Tens of thousands of students from about 30 universities, many
bearing wreaths for Hu and pro-democracy banners, streamed into the
square about Friday midnight, where up to 100,000 people had
congregated during a day of rallies.
   The students gathered in circles centered around a wreath-laden
monument to revolutionary heroes and sang, eulogized Hu and held
debates about democracy.
   Some outspokenly criticized the Communist system. ``No one
believes in Communism anymore,'' said one 34-year-old teacher. ``No
one believes in the party. The party is strangling China.''
   Ren Wanding, activist in the short-lived 1978 Democracy Wall
period of relative tolerance for democratic views, told one
audience of about 2,000: ``People are praying for the awakening of
a legal system ... This is a historical necessity. Democracy Wall
lives again!''
   Others critized Deng Xiaoping for holding onto power and
demanded that Premier Li Peng resign, saying he lacked ability for
the job.
   At about 6:15 a.m. Saturday, a student leader announced to
cheers that the authorities agreed to let the students remain in
the square while the party memorial service took place in the Great
Hall.
   The Beijing government on Friday announced that access to the
Great Hall and the square would be restricted during the ceremony.
Students feared police or soldiers would move in during the night
to drive them out of the area.
   ``A victory for us. A big victory, the Communist Party has
backed down,'' said one jubilant student in the square.
   The students acknowledged, however, that authorities rejected a
list of demands presented earlier in the week.
   They included more funding for education, public disclosure of
the incomes of top leaders and an end to the ban on unauthorized
demonstrations.
   Students said the most significant demand was for greater press
freedom, a persistent theme during the demonstrations.
   The official press has given little coverage to the
demonstrations except to report on alleged violent acts by
demonstrators during Thursday's clash and issue warnings that those
taking advantage of Hu's death to promote anti-government
activities will be punished.
   Tiananmen Square, a 100-acre plaza sided by the Forbidden City,
the Great Hall and Mao Tse-tung's mausoleum, is the symbolic center
of China.
   Saturday's demonstration was the biggest since April 1976, when
the death of Premier Chou En-lai sparked a huge outpouring of grief
and anger toward the leftist government.
   That ``Tiananmen Incident'' set off events that were to lead to
the overthrow of the leftists and the end of the 1966-76 Cultural
Revolution.
   Hu was widely admired by students for his work in redressing the
wrongs done to intellectuals during that decade of chaos.
   He was ousted as party leader in January 1987 after party
conservatives accused him of being soft on student demonstrators
and the trend toward ``bourgeois liberalization.''
   On Saturday, one government worker in the demonstration said of
Deng, ``Our leader is old. Maybe he is crazy. Many people hope he
will die.''
   Deng remains popular for his market-oriented reforms that have
brought China some economic prosperity. But he has carried out only
limited political reforms and does not tolerate opposition to
one-party rule.
   Deng, who was believed at one point to have chosen Hu as his
successor, approved Hu's ouster after pro-democracy demonstrations
rocked the nation in December 1986 and January 1987.

   Hundreds of women wearing veils wait
outside an abandoned schoolhouse for bags of flour and sugar to
feed their families for the next two weeks.
   Their children huddle close by. Some clutch torn plastic bags
and rusting buckets to carry the rations home; others simply stick
out cupped hands.
   They are among the women and children in Kabul most affected by
the 11-year civil war. Only the poorest of them are eligible for
the emergency rations distributed by a U.N relief program called
Operation Salaam, or Peace.
   Relief workers say they don't know how much longer they will be
able to help because their stockpile will be depleted by the end of
April.
   ``We make no illusions that we are even able to begin to handle
the need. We are not solving the problem,'' said Ross Mountain,
director of the United Nations Development Program.
   Since February, relief workers have handed out 22-pound bags of
flour and 6{-pound bags of sugar, as well as some medicine and
blankets, to about 33,500 families.
   They also have provided fertilizer to farmers hoping to start
planting crops in fields destroyed by fighting between Afghan
forces and Moslem guerrillas trying to oust the Soviet-backed
government.
   Afghanistan was self-sufficient in food before civil war broke
out following a Marxist coup in April 1978. The fighting has
destroyed fields and orchards and forced the government to import
about 1 million tons of wheat annually.
   Relief workers say fertilizer also will be gone within days.
   Moscow donated 175 tons of wheat and flour and about 235 tons of
sugar to Operation Salaam.
   The Development Program is one of five U.N. organizations
involved in the relief effort. The others are the Aid Coordinator's
Office, UNICEF, the High Commission for Refugees and the World Food
Bank.
   Dozens of Soviet military transport planes descend daily on the
capital from sunrise to sunset, but the blue-and-white aircraft
each carry only about 25 tons of food and supplies. The rest of the
cargo is weapons and ammunition.
   The Soviets ended nine years of intervention in Afghanistan when
they withdrew the last of their troops on Feb. 15. Western
countries that withdrew from Afghanistan before that time do not
recognize the government of President Najib and have refused to
help it.
   The United States, Pakistan, Saudi Arabia and China back the
guerrillas, known as mujahedeen.
   Bread lines at Kabul bakeries that once stretched for blocks
have eased, and there are plenty of fruits and vegetables in the
markets. But food prices have risen dramatically and the poor
cannot afford them.
   The cost of 15{ pounds of flour has risen from about 40 cents in
January to $3.25 today.
   Heavy snow and rebel attacks at times have cut off two vital
supply routes to Kabul, a city of 2.2 million people _ the Salang
highway running north to the Soviet border and the Jalalabad
highway east to Pakistan.
   Fighting between government forces and the guerrillas closed the
Salang highway for nearly two weeks this month. A 1,300-truck
convoy was stalled about 30 miles north of Kabul and dozens of
containers of food rotted on the Soviet border.
   Convoys also have had trouble traveling between Pakistan and
Kabul because of the guerrilla assault on Jalalabad. The insurgents
have pounded the city with heavy artillery and tens of thousands of
rockets since March 6.
   The Soviet airlift has enabled the government to hold out
against the guerrillas, but it supplies less than half the 650 tons
of flour that Kabul needs daily.
   Guerrilla leaders operating from Pakistan originally said they
would take power in Afghanistan within weeks after the Soviet
pullout.
   However, government troops have managed to repulse their
assaults on Jalalabad, and diplomats say the insurgents now hope to
starve major cities such as Jalalabad and Kabul into surrendering.

   An honor roll student searching for a
way to protest his school's dress code found something his mother
would think natty _ a bright red pair of her culottes.
   ``They're saying we can't wear shorts, but girls can wear skirts
that are shorter than shorts, so they're indirectly discriminating
against guys,'' said Aaron Martinez, who was sent home Thursday
when he showed up in school sporting the outfit.
   On Friday, five other boys joined his protest by going to school
in skirts.
   School officials told them to change their clothing or go home.
Two went home, while the others changed to pants and went to class,
said principal Gary Blocker.
   The School Board's student dress policy clearly states that
culottes _ sometimes referred to as ``split skirts'' _ are
permissible. The policy does not say that only girls can wear
culottes to school.
   ``Culottes are for girls,'' Blocker said. ``The handbook doesn't
say that, but that's what is meant. It might be sex discrimination,
but it's disruptive to the school.''
   Martinez, a member of the baseball team and captain of the
soccer team, said he feels ``more comfortable in shorts than in
jeans. I never wear long pants unless I have to.''
   ``The kids in California are allowed to wear shorts to school,''
he said. ``I guess they're a bunch of illiterate dropouts because
of it.''
   The School Board has scheduled a public hearing next week to
consider changes to the student dress policy.

<HEAD>Late Actor's Companion Says AIDS Victims Must Warn Lovers</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LINDA DEUTSCH</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A judge said a jury's passion led it to give
Rock Hudson's lover an excessive $21.7 million in a landmark AIDS
lawsuit, and he slashed the award to $5.5 million.
   ``It's still a big award,'' said Marc Christian, 35, who was
reached by telephone Friday after Superior Court Judge Bruce
Geernaert's decision.
   Christian had sued the late actor's estate contending Hudson
should have told Christian he had the deadly and contagious disease.
   During the trial, Christian, a former bartender, testified in
sometimes lurid detail that he continued to have sex unwittingly
with Hudson for months after the actor was diagnosed with AIDS.
   The jury ruled in February that Hudson was guilty of
``outrageous conduct'' for concealing his AIDS diagnosis from
Christian, his lover for two years.
   Although Christian did not contract AIDS and has tested negative
for the presence of the virus, both the judge and jury found he
deserved damages for the extreme emotional distress he suffered.
Christian said he didn't learn of the star's illness until a few
months before Hudson, 58, died on Oct. 5, 1985.
   ``I thought I was a dead man,'' he testified about the terror
that gripped him in the wake of the disclosure.
   Legal scholars said the ruling was unique in personal injury law
concerning sexually transmitted diseases, because only plaintiffs
who developed the diseases have collected damages in previous cases.
   In separate deliberations in February, jurors gave Christian
$14.5 million in compensatory damages and $7.25 million in punitive
damages.
   The judge upheld the verdict and said Hudson's conduct was
``outrageous and reprehensible'' because the actor and his
secretary, Mark Miller, agreed to keep Hudson's AIDS diagnosis
secret.
   But in the 30-page order issued Friday, the judge said, ``The
court finds that the jury's award of $14.5 million is so high that
it must be concluded that the award is based in part on passion
resulting from the jury's evaluation of the outrageous and
reprehensible nature of the conduct of Rock Hudson and defendant
Miller.''
   ``It is... clear, that the emotional distress at issue here is
the fear of contracting AIDS and, therefore, the fear of an
agonizing death is very substantial whether measured in quantity or
quality,'' Geernaert wrote.
   ``On the other hand, however serious (Christian's) distress
might be when he first learned of Hudson's AIDS, such emotional
distress would become somewhat less over time.
   ``Furthermore, there is no evidence that plaintiff's emotional
distress has been physically debilitating or that plaintiff has
suffered any tangible economic loss,'' he wrote.
   Christian said he was happy with the outcome because it still
sends a message to AIDS patients to inform their sexual partners if
they have the disease.
   Christian's attorney, Harold Rhoden, who said he was
disappointed by the judge's decision, said Christian accepted the
reduction because he does not have the money to continue the court
battle.
   Robert Parker Mills, an attorney for the Hudson estate, said he
believes his clients will appeal.
   ``There's not any evidence I can see that would substantiate a
$5 million award to this man,'' said Mills.

<HEAD>Is Food And Water Life Sustaining Medical Treatment?</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JONATHAN YENKIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MILWAUKEE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A family's decision to have a feeding tube
removed from a 90-year-old, semicomatose stroke victim has
rekindled a debate over whether it is humane to withhold food and
water from terminally ill patients.
   For many doctors, cutting off the flow of nutrients through a
tube is equivalent to pulling the plug on a respirator. But
opponents argue that withholding food oversteps the line between
allowing nature to take its course and actively ending a life.
   ``There is a line in many people's eyes,'' said Fenella Rouse,
legal services director at the Society For The Right To Die in New
York City, which supports the right to cut off nutrition.
   ``I don't think there's a practical difference,'' she said. ``I
think there's an emotional difference.''
   Wisconsin is among at least 39 states and the District of
Columbia that permit so-called ``living wills,'' in which people
can declare whether they would want to refuse life-sustaining
medical treatment if they became terminally ill, according to the
society.
   But Wisconsin is one of a handful of states with laws that
specifically prohibit cutting off food from patients.
   ``Do we want to go around starving and dehydrating people to
death?'' said Susan Armacost, legislative director for Wisconsin
Right to Life. The group has fought proposals to broaden the living
will law to include nutrition and hydration, successfully defeating
one effort last year.
   Norman Fost, director of the medical ethics program at the
University of Wisconsin Medical School in Madison, said it is
misleading to say patients starve to death. He says comatose
patients cannot experience hunger or thirst.
   ``Of course it's always hard to withdraw treatment,'' he said.
``It goes against natural medical impulses. But death is often in
the interest of the patient.''
   ``People should have the right to control medical care,''
concurs Arthur Caplan, director of the Center for Biomedical Ethics
at the University of Minnesota.
   Both doctors are supported by the American Medical Association,
which says it is ethical to discontinue life-prolonging treatment
for patients facing imminent death or in irreversible comas. Such
treatment ``includes medication and artificially and
technologically supplied respiration, nutrition or hydration.''
   But Ms. Armacost of Wisconsin Right to Life insists that
nutrition is different. A patient has a chance of surviving if a
respirator is removed, she says, but cutting off food means certain
death.
   Court rulings have been mixed in two states with laws that
exclude the removal of food and water.
   In Connecticut, the state Supreme Court ruled this year that
feeding tubes could be removed from a comatose patient, but
spoon-and straw-feeding could not.
   Missouri's Supreme Court ruled last year that the parents of a
brain-damaged woman who is not comatose could not have the woman's
surgically implanted feeding tube removed. The case has been
appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court, where it is pending.
   No one has been prosecuted for withholding food from a patient
in Wisconsin. The woman died last year.
   But the Milwaukee County district attorney's office is seeking
advice from doctors about the case of the elderly stroke victim in
an attempt to clarify the law.
   Assistant District Attorney Thomas Potter wouldn't comment on
whether the department was considering filing charges. He said the
department's main intention was to give doctors guidelines on what
they can do under the law.

<HEAD>Farmers Win, But Not Much Money, In Bull Trial</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DODGEVILLE, Wis. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Two farmers who claimed a neighbor's
wandering bulls impregnated 32 of their heifers won a lawsuit, but
got far less money than they sought to pay for abortions on the
cows that were too young to have babies.
   An Iowa County Circuit Court jury awarded damages of $640 to
Mike and Paul Mieden on Thursday. The men had sued for $54,000.
   The $640, according to a veterinarian's testimony, would have
covered the cost to administer abortion shots to the animals. The
shots would have had no prolonged health effects.
   The trial pitting the Miedens against their neighbor, Lloyd
Vivian, began Monday.
   The Miedens claimed that in late June and early July 1986, two
of Vivian's bulls jumped a fence and bred with 32 of the 86 heifers
that were in an adjacent pasture.
   The Miedens claimed that the heifers were too young to be bred,
and that they lost milk production because of the early pregnancies.
   Vivian did not deny that his bulls were in the pasture with the
heifers, but took the position that the Miedens could have done
something to prevent damage to the heifers. He offered to have the
heifers' pregnancies checked and to pay to have the pregnancies
aborted.
   Paul Mieden said four of the heifers were aborted by a
veterinarian, four aborted on their own and calves delivered by the
other 24 heifers died. Two heifers died while giving birth, he
said, and others suffered damaged reproductive tracts because they
were too young to deliver.

<HEAD>Pennsylvania's Super 7 Jackpot Guaranteed to Hit A Record $70 Million</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ANITA C. HUSLIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>HARRISBURG, Pa. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Millions of tickets have already been
bought for the chance to win the Pennsylvania lottery's jackpot of
$70 million, which is sure to grow, but lottery officials are
urging people not to splurge on tickets.
   The Super 7 jackpot, guaranteed to reach the $70 million mark by
Wednesday's drawing, would break North American records, lottery
spokeswoman Terry Murphy said Friday.
   Ticket sales for the Super 7 game have been booming, she said.
Players bought nearly 7 million tickets Thursday and Friday.
   Lottery officials will continue to update the jackpot's value as
sales continue, Ms. Murphy said.
   Despite the temptation to buy as many tickets as possible to
increase chances of winning, to do so would be futile, Ms. Murphy
said.
   ``The odds of winning the jackpot are one in 9.6 million for
each ticket you buy,'' she said. ``There's no way you could cover
it all.''
   Players should only use extra money to buy tickets, not money
they need to cover bills, food, clothing or other essentials, she
said.
   ``We are after players' discretionary dollars, the same money
they would spend buying a magazine or a candy bar,'' she said.
   If one person gets a ticket with seven of the 11 winning
numbers, he or she would receive $2.69 million a year for 26 years.
   The Super 7 jackpot is guaranteed to reach $70 million because
no one has bought a winning ticket for the past six weeks. That
would surpass any of the lottery jackpots ever offered in the
United States, Canada and Mexico, Ms. Murphy said.
   Prior to the Super 7 jackpot, the largest U.S. lottery winnings
were $69.9 million in Illinois, split by four ticket holders on
April 15.
   Before the $70 million prize, Pennsylvania's largest jackpot was
$46 million in the Super 7 game, which was won by a Hollidaysburg
couple on Oct. 14, 1987.

<HEAD>Unwilling Defendant Ordered To Take Drugs That May Make Him Competent</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A man accused of clubbing his
mother with a crowbar and then stabbing her to death in a cocaine
frenzy has been ordered to take powerful drugs that may make him
competent to stand trial.
   Charles Moore, 29, who shouted and cursed when Circuit Judge
Robert Carney issued the order Thursday, has the right to be spared
``thought-manipulating'' drugs, argued his lawyer, Ryal Gaudiosi.
   But Carney sided with state psychiatrists who said Moore's
mental health probably would not improve without the drugs.
   If after five years Moore still is not mentally competent to go
to trial, criminal charges against him may have to be dropped,
prosecutors said.
   Moore was charged with first-degree murder and two counts of
attempted first-degree murder after attacking his mother, his
nephew and a passerby in April 1988. Police said he clubbed his
mother with a crowbar before stabbing her, then attacked the others
with the crowbar.
   Carney ruled that Moore was mentally incompetent to stand trial,
and he was taken for treatment to the state-run South Florida
Evaluation and Treatment Center in Miami in September.
   The state Department of Health and Rehabilitative Services asked
Carney on Thursday for the authority to make Moore take
anti-psychotic drugs aimed at altering his behavior.
   Dr. Andrew Perfilio, a psychiatrist who has been treating Moore,
told Carney that he wants to give Moore the drugs Trilafon and
Cogentin.
   The first is an anti-psychotic drug; the second is to counter
possible side effects of Trilafon, such as dry mouth, blurred
vision, drooling, involuntary muscle movements and even glaucoma.
   Moore loudly opposed taking the drugs.
   ``I've done the best I can without any medicine,'' he told the
court. ``I feel like they're trying to kill me. My behavior has
been been outstanding since I've been in there. If you want to see
me worse than what I am, then bring the medicine to me.''
   But Perfilio said the proposed medication is ``the cornerstone
of his treatment. The longer he is delusional, the more likely it
will become permanent and fixed.''
   That prospect, coupled with the potential that the state may
have to drop charges, makes the medicine necessary, argued
Assistant State Attorney Pete LaPorte.
   Carney agreed to order Moore to take the drugs for three months,
then report back to him.
   ``The benefits far outweigh whatever disadvantages there may be
to the treatment,'' Carney said.
   Moore, who was handcuffed and wore leg shackles, remained
unconvinced. ``I'm not voluntarily taking any drugs,'' he insisted.
``I don't even take ... aspirin.''

<HEAD>U.N. Conference Ends With Denouncement Of Chemical Weapons</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JANICE FUHRMAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>KYOTO, Japan (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A United Nations conference on disarmament
that ended today gave unanimous backing to a global ban on chemical
weapons, officials said.
   ``There has been a proliferation of chemical weapons and we have
to be careful,'' said Yasushi Akashi, undersecretary-general for
disarmament affairs at the U.N. ``We may not be able to close
Pandora's box.''
   Akashi and others at the four-day conference noted that 20 to 30
countries now possess chemical arms, some of which were used most
recently in the Iran-Iraq conflict that left more than 1 million
people dead.
   There was universal agreement among the 100 arms control experts
that a complete ban on chemical weapons should be negotiated at the
U.N.'s permanent Conference on Disarmament in Geneva.
   Experts from the United States, the Soviet Union and 28 other
nations gathered in Kyoto for the conference, which was held in the
only country to be the victim of nuclear attacks. In August, 1945,
the United States dropped atom bombs on the western cities of
Hiroshima and Nagasaki.
   At the meeting, experts and officials clashed over the need for
a comprehensive nuclear test ban, and on the policy of nuclear
deterrence.
   Seismologists from around the world agreed that modern
technology can produce highly accurate methods of detecting
underground nuclear explosions, but said they needed political
support and funds to build a global network of seismological
monitoring stations.
   The United States, Britian and France advocated the policy of
possessing nuclear arms to deter others from using them, while
others noted their threatening and dangerous aspects.
   On Friday, U.S. Ambassador Maynard W. Glitman told the assembly
that despite unilateral reductions in Soviet troops and
conventional arms to be carried out by next year, the United States
would continue to stockpile nuclear arms to maintain global
security.
   Glitman told reporters today that the next goal of the United
States in arms controls negotiations is the reduction of Soviet
conventional forces in Europe.
   ``To achieve an equal number for the United States and the
Soviet Union (in Europe) will enable us to look to future nuclear
reductions there,'' said Glitman, the chief U.S. negotiator for the
1987 INF (intermediate-range nuclear missiles) treaty.

<HEAD>Alaska Congressman Wants `Spill Czar,' Fishermen Unhappy With Progress</HEAD>

<DATELINE>VALDEZ, Alaska (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Two congressmen said they would push for a
``spill czar'' to take charge of any future oil disasters, but the
cleanup of the Exxon Valdez spill remained fractious with fishermen
demanding a bigger role.
   Forty-eight skimmers were gathering 100,000 gallons to 150,000
gallons of oil a day, the Coast Guard estimated. But officials said
Friday there were widespread delays in unloading the oil onto
barges, which Exxon spokesman Henry Beathard blamed on the crude's
thick taffy-like consistency.
   The giant Soviet oil skimmer Vaidogubsky, which spent two days
getting ready and testing its booms, was poised at Gore Point on
the Kenai Peninsula, where large pools of oil washing westward have
been stopped by a spectacular outcropping of rocks jutting into the
Gulf of Alaska. It was to begin collecting oil today.
   Heavy concentrations of oil also remained in Prince William
Sound and were on the west side of Kodiak Island, more than 300
miles to the southwest.
   More than 300 miles of shoreline have been affected since the
tanker ran aground in the sound last month and spilled 10.1 million
gallons of crude.
   Delays in responding to the spill have contributed to its
spread. Many fishermen frustrated at the lack of progress have
taken to the sea themselves, using scoops and buckets to pick up
oil contained with homemade booms.
   Kelly Duncan, 29, said he sucked 7,500 gallons of oil and
seawater into the hull of his boat. He said he fears his fishing
boat may be permanently contaminated.
   At Homer on the Kenai Peninsula, angry fishermen demanded one of
their own be given equal decision-making power with Exxon and the
Coast Guard in the cleanup.
   Reps. Don Young, R-Alaska, and Curt Weldon, R-Pa., met Friday
night with fishermen and representatives of the Coast Guard and
Exxon. ``We came out with a very positive outlook,'' Young said
without elaborating.
   The two congressmen toured oil-spotted beaches on the Kenai
Peninsula earlier in the day with Interior Secretary Manuel Lujan
Jr.
   At a news conference, the two men said they would push for
legislation to put one person _ most likely the commandant of the
Coast Guard _ in charge of cleaning up future spills.
   Commandant Paul Yost on Wednesday ended a weeklong stay in
Alaska during which he rearranged the cleanup strategy, approved an
Exxon plan for the work and set a timetable for completion. The
entire job is to be finished by mid-September.
   Young said the legislation he plans to introduce might include
funding for one oil-skimming ship to be stationed in Alaska.
   Weldon said it would be ideal to have skimmers in place on both
coasts. He was a fire chief in the Pennsylvania port town of Marcus
Hook when two foreign tankers collided there in 1975, burning and
spilling 300,000 gallons.
   Young also vowed to spend money on research and push for the use
of oil-dispersing chemicals, regardless of toxicity, in dealing
with future spills.
   Lujan didn't attend the news conference. He left the congressmen
to go to Kodiak Island, home of the nation's No. 1 fishing port and
the world's largest concentration of brown bears.
   Meanwhile, environmentalists attacked Exxon over the company's
reluctance to open a sea otter treatment center at Seward.
   The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service said Friday it had written
Exxon strongly re-emphasizing the need for a second treatment
center in addition to one at Valdez.
   The Fish and Wildlife Service has counted 3,406 dead shore
birds, 409 dead sea otters and four dead bald eagles.

   Hundreds of people gathered to honor the 47
sailors who died on the USS Iowa as victims of a tragedy that
``reaches into little towns all over the country.''
   ``Words are never sufficient at a time like this to express the
feelings that we share,'' Norfolk Mayor Joseph Leafe told the more
than 750 people who came to Friday's memorial at the Elizabeth
River waterfront.
   The 58,000-ton battleship was steaming toward its home port here
and was to arrive Sunday. Meanwhile, Navy investigators on board
studied an amateur videotape for clues into Wednesday's explosion
in the ship's No. 2 gun turret.
   Lt. Cmdr. James Cudler, a Pentagon spokesman, said the explosion
occurred as an Iowa officer was making a videotape to record the
firing of the ship's big guns. Cudler said Navy officials had not
decided whether to release the tape publicly.
   Crewmen in the upper chambers of the gun turret were killed by
the explosion and fire while sailors working several levels below
suffocated when the blast sucked out all the oxygen, according to a
report in today's editions of The Washington Post.
   Maj. Tom Johnston, a spokesman for the Atlantic Fleet in
Norfolk, said he had no information on the causes of death.
   The explosion came after two of the three guns had been loaded
and just after the crew had been given permission to load and fire
the center gun, the newspaper said.
   After the fire was extinguished, crewmen worked quickly to
remove the shells and powder from the other two guns, the newspaper
said.
   NBC News reported Friday that the exact cause of the explosion
may never be known because the devastation inside the turret was so
complete.
   The top members of the Senate Armed Services Committee said the
panel will hold hearings on the fiery explosion. The Pentagon has
ordered the 16-inch guns on all four World War II-era battleships
silenced until the investigation is finished.
   Some critics have said the 16-inch guns are outmoded and
dangerous.
   Jim Smith, 63, of Norfolk, said he attended the memorial because
he considered the dead men his shipmates.
   ``I served aboard the battleship North Carolina in 1946. I know
about those big guns .... I know these things can happen,'' he
said. ``At times like this, everyone seems to pull together. We
become one family.''
   Joan Taplett, wife of a Navy commander, said she brought her
3-year-old son so he would always remember the men who died.
   ``I'm from South Dakota. ... When I heard that one of the men
killed was from there, I had to come,'' she said. ``I guess I'm
here for his parents. Something like this touches all of us ... It
reaches into little towns all over the country,'' she said.
   David L. Hanson, a 23-year-old electrician's mate 3rd class from
Bison, S.D., population 457, was among those killed.
   A wreath of 47 yellow carnations was cast into the river, a
Norfolk police honor guard gave a 21-gun salute and a Navy bugler
played taps at the 15-minute ceremony.
   ``On the USS Iowa, 47 young men died too soon ... We will
remember, and honor and grieve as a nation,'' Gov. Gerald L.
Baliles said.
   The Navy is planning a ceremony for the crew and family members
Monday morning at Norfolk Naval Base, with President Bush scheduled
to attend.

<HEAD>Eastern Scraps Shuttle Marketing Effort With Cabbies</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARCY GORDON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Strike-bound Eastern Airlines says it has
stopped a program that rewarded New York cab drivers for steering
passengers toward its gates at LaGuardia Airport with $25 gift
certificates and weekly prize drawings.
   Eastern dropped the 2-week-old campaign on Friday after New
York's Taxi and Limousine Commission told the airline it was
illegal.
   ``Once it was brought to our attention, it was discontinued,''
said Jim Ashlock, an Eastern spokesman in Miami.
   Ellen Weiman, a spokeswoman for the commission, said the shuttle
incentive program for cabbies was ``against all rules,'' since taxi
drivers shouldn't be induced to take riders where they don't want
to go.
   Eastern was giving cabbies a $25 American Express certificate
for every five loads of passengers they dropped off at Eastern's
shuttle terminal at LaGuardia.
   There also was a weekly drawing for participating taxi drivers
for a color television set, videocassette recorder or radio.
   ``We'd like to think that maybe the cabbies are doing some
selling for us,'' Eastern spokesman Robin Matell said earlier
Friday. He noted that around half the passengers coming to
LaGuardia arrive by taxi.
   Eastern's hourly among New York, Boston and Washington has been
running a normal schedule, compared with only 10 percent of
pre-strike flights for the airline as a whole. Passenger loads have
been decimated, however, as the rival shuttle operated by Pan Am
Corp. has eaten into Eastern's traffic.
   Pan Am once used an incentive plan to encourage cabbies to pick
arriving passengers up at its New York terminal when the airline
started its shuttle service in late 1986, spokeswoman Pamela Hanlon
said, but the program wasn't illegal.
   She said Pan Am has captured around 80 percent of the Northeast
shuttle market, and Eastern's taxi program appears to have had no
impact.
   In another development, a Washington property developer
confirmed through an associate Friday that he is interested in
buying Eastern.
   ``We've expressed our interest; it's sincere and we're pursuing
it,'' said John Sarpa, senior vice president of Hadid Development
Co. in Roslyn, Va. The company is run by Mohamed Hadid, who
recently agreed to buy the Ritz-Carlton hotels in Washington and
New York.
   Attorneys for Eastern and its striking unions recently said
there are four serious offers for the airline, which has been
grounded by a walkout since March 4. It filed for bankruptcy
protection five days later.
   They said the bidders are ex-baseball commissioner Peter V.
Ueberroth, whose $464 million deal to buy Eastern collapsed last
week; takeover strategist Carl Icahn; billionaire hotel executive
Jay Pritzker; and an unnamed suitor.
   But Frank Lorenzo, chairman of Eastern parent's Texas Air Corp.,
insisted earlier this week that Eastern isn't for sale and that
there is no serious fourth bidder.

   Snow fell over northern New England and rain showers were
scattered over parts of the Northwest and West early today, but
most areas of the nation were dry.
   Rain dampened the eastern coast of Florida, northeastern South
Dakota to west-central Minnesota, western Montana to the Idaho
panhandle, southwest Oregon and northeast California. A strong
thunderstorm developed over southwest Minnesota during the morning.
   An inch of snow fell at Mount Washington in New Hampshire in the
six hours ending at 2 a.m. EDT, but no significant rainfall was
recorded around the nation during the same period.
   Warnings have been posted for fire danger over the lower
elevations of Colorado, which has had high temperatures, a dry
spell and gusty winds.
   The high temperature for the nation on Friday was 105 degrees at
Buckeye, Ariz.
   Today's forecast: rainshowers reaching from the northern Pacific
Coast across Montana; snow extending over the Green and White
Mountains of northern New England and over northeast New York; and
dry weather for much of the nation.
   High temperatures were expected in the 30s and 40s over New
England, inland New York, and much of Michigan; in the 50s and 60s
from southeast New York across the Virginias, the remainder of the
Great Lakes, the Ohio Valley, Wisconsin, northeast Minnesota, the
northern half of the Rockies, the northern half of the Plateau and
the northern half of the Pacific Coast; and in the 90s from
southwest Nebraska across much of Kansas, western Oklahoma, the
western third of Texas, southern New Mexico, southern Arizona and
southeast California. High temperatures for much of the rest of the
country were to reach the 70s and 80s.
   Temperatures around the nation at 3 a.m. EDT ranged from 26
degrees at Marquette, Mich., to 87 degrees at Phoenix.

sprayed his vehicle with bullets while he was on his way to work in
suburban Quezon.
   The communist New People's Army General Command claimed
responsibility in a statement delivered to news agencies. The
letter bore the logo of the rebel army and was released on behalf
of its chief, Romulo Kintanar.
   The statement threatened further attacks if the United States
continues support of President Corazon Aquino's fight against the
20-year Communist insurgency.
   ``The death of Col. Rowe signifies the firm commitment of the
revolutionary forces to continue military actions against U.S.
personnel and installations as these are manifestations of the
arrogant trampling of U.S. imperialists on the Filipino people's
independence and sovereignty,'' the statement said.
   Rowe, 51, was chief of the ground forces division of the Joint
U.S.-Military Advisory Group, which provides training and
logistical support to the Philippine military.
   Rowe, a native of McAllen, Texas, was a decorated Vietnam War
hero who was held in a cage for five years by the Viet Cong as a
prisoner of war until he escaped in 1968.
   U.S. Ambassador Nicholas Platt called the killing a ``cowardly''
act.
   Marlin Fitzwater, President Bush's press secretary, said the
U.S. government will work with the Philippine government ``to track
down and bring to justice those responsible for this
assassination.''
   Police said they recovered the assailants' car and traced it to
a Filipino civilian who said it was stolen on April 7. Cartridges
from bullets used in the killing littered the vehicle, police said.
   Police said up to three cars may have been used in the ambush,
but witnesses said they saw only one carrying at least three men, a
driver and two gunmen. One gunman had an M-16 rifle and the other a
.45-caliber pistol, police said.
   Rowe's Filipino driver was wounded in the attack.
   It came five days after the communist National Democratic Front
said the rebels were ``determined to make U.S. imperialism pay
dearly for the continuing stay of its bases and its escalating
intervention in our people's affairs.''
   The statement was issued to claim reponsibility for the bombing
of a U.S. communications station in the northern province of
Benguet on April 9. No one was hurt.
   In October 1987, rebels killed three Americans and a Filipino
outside Clark Air Base, 50 miles north of Manila. Authorities then
increased security at six U.S. military installations and civilian
offices in the Philippines.
   The U.S. Navy today ordered additional security for the 1,000
sailors on the flagship USS Blue Ridge of the 7th Fleet. The ship
arrived Friday for a four-day port call.
   Lt. Mike Andrews, the fleet's spokesman, said the sailors were
told, among other things, to travel in groups and stay away from
dark alleys.
   In Washington, State Department deputy spokesman Richard Boucher
said Friday that a U.S. travel advisory issued March 15 ``indicates
areas of the country where, because of criminal activity or
terrorist activity, people should try to avoid.''
   The advisory says most urban areas in the Philippines including
Manila are safe for travelers.
   Boucher indicated the advisory might be revised. ``I'm sure that
will be looked at,'' he said. ``I would note that the threats that
I have heard about were against official Americans, and weren't
general threats to travelers.''

<HEAD>Attorney General: Mecham Can Run Again</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By WILLIAM F. RAWSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>PHOENIX (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Former Gov. Evan Mecham can run for public office
again despite the impeachment and conviction that ousted him a year
ago, the attorney general said.
   ``Naturally `I'm happy about it,'' said Mecham, who has already
announced a 1990 gubernatorial bid.
   ``It's what we thought it should be,'' he told television
station KPNX from Omaha, Neb.
   The opinion issued Friday by Attorney General Bob Corbin is
nonbinding and could be challenged in court, but political leaders
from both parties said they wouldn't challenge it.
   ``I think this issue should be settled by the voters of
Arizona,'' said Phoenix developer J. Fife Symington III, who has
announced he will run against Mecham in next year's GOP primary.
   Corbin said Mecham was free to run becafice in the future. The
impeachment and conviction did not disqualify Mecham automatically,
he said.
   His attorney, Donald MacPherson, said that Mecham originally had
intended to ``take this question of the `Dracula clause' to the
Supreme Court regardless of Bob Corbin's opinion.''
   The Republican-controlled Senate ousted Mecham on April 4, 1988,
by more than the required two-thirds vote. But by a vote of 17-13 _
three short of a two-thirds majority _ the Senate failed to invoke
the so-called ``Dracula clause'' that would have driven a political
stake through Mecham's heart and barred him from holding office
again.
   Some legal scholars have said the Senate might not have needed
to vote on the clause because the state's constitution speaks of
ouster and disqualification in the same sentence. And even if a
separate vote was required, they said, a simple majority such as
17-13 might be enough.
   But in his 11-page opinion, Corbin said those who wrote the
state's Constitution expected that there would be separate votes on
ouster and disqualification.
   Political leaders from both parties welcomed the opinion and
said it would be better to let Mecham go ahead with his campaign
for 1990.
   ``I think he ought to be able to run,'' said Senate President
Robert Usdane, a Republican who voted to oust Mecham but also voted
against the ``Dracula clause.''
   ``I think it'd be better that he not be martyred,'' Usdane added.
   Senate Minority Leader Alan Stephens, a Democrat who also voted
for impeachment and against the ``Dracula clause,'' said Corbin's
ruling ``is the right decision.''
   Democratic Gov. Rose Mofford, who succeeded Mecham following his
ouster, said the attorney general's opinion would not change her
plans to run for governor in 1990.
   Mecham was elected on his fifth try for governor in 1986 and was
impeached by the House after barely a year in office.
   The articles of impeachment charged Mecham with concealing a
developer's campaign loan, misusing state money and obstructing
justice.
   The Senate convicted Mecham on the misuse of funds and
obstruction charges but deferred the obstruction charge to Superior
Court, where he was acquitted.
   MacPherson said Mecham still plans to ask the state Supreme
Court next month to set aside the impeachment.
   ``We still have high hopes of either having the articles of
impeachment dismissed, which would put Gov. Mecham immediately back
in office, or having a new trial declared,'' MacPherson said.

<HEAD>Spill Downgraded; Employee Not Certfied, Says Coast Guard</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BAYOU SORREL, La. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Fears for a fragile bayou environment
were receding after officials downgraded the estimated size of a
spill of oil-tainted water to no more than 10,000 gallons.
   Meanwhile, the Coast Guard said an employee who was transferring
the waste water from a barge when the spill occurred lacked proper
certification.
   The spill of so-called ``slop water'' occurred early Friday on a
loading dock on Grand River, about 35 miles southwest of Baton
Rouge, said Bobby Mayweather of GSX Land Treatment in nearby White
Castle.
   The barge was carrying 900,000 gallons of waste water from an
Exxon plant in Houston. It buckled in the middle while the waste
was being unloaded into tanker trucks, Mayweather said.
   Authorities said the spill was quickly contained and that a
cleanup would continue today.
   Exxon had paid GSX to treat and dispose of the waste at White
Castle, Mayweather said.
   Coast Guard Lt. Cmdr. Dean Kutz said one of the companies or an
individual could be assessed civil penalties for conducting the
transfer without proper documentation.
   Coast Guard Chief Warrant Officer Larry Doss said GSX employee
Gordon Vice didn't have the required Merchant Marine certification
for the job.
   Rick Davenport, facility manager for the GSX recovery unit in
Crowley, confirmed that Vice was manning the operation when the
spill occurred, but he declined to comment further. GSX is assuming
responsibility for the cleanup, Davenport said.
   The barge was leased by GSX and Exxon had no responsibility for
the shipment after it left the Texas site, said Iberville Parish
Sheriff Freddie Pitre.
   Paul Dubois, a spokesman for the Palmer Co., owner of the barge,
said waste water is used to wash out tanks and ships.
   Louisiana State Police Lt. Ronnie Jones said that according to
Exxon, the waste was about 90 percent water, 7 percent alcohol and
3 percent light oil.
   State Police initially estimated the spill at up to 400,000
gallons, while GSX estimated it at 180,000 gallons. Exxon Chemical
spokeswoman Jill Johnson in Dallas downgraded the estimate late
Friday to about 10,000 gallons.
   No one was injured in the accident, but Johnson said a small
number of fish were killed at the outset.
   ``It looked like a giant had stepped on the barge smack in the
middle,'' said Jones. ``Oil-absorbing booms were in place shortly
after the spill and we believe most of the waste was confined to
the immediate area of Grand River.
   ``Things could have been an awful lot worse but because of the
waste involved and the quick response by Iberville Parish
officials, we've got a good handle on the situation,'' he said.

   An escaped mental patient who doused
himself with gasoline and set himself on fire in front of a closed
abortion clinic had been arrested twice during previous protests
there, a clinic official said.
   Thomas Valiquette, 26, was in critical condition early this
morning with third-degree burns over his entire body at the
Vanderbilt University Medical Center burn center, hospital
spokesman Doug Williams said.
   ``The doctor said his prognosis is not good,'' Williams said.
   Earl Ferrell, administrator of the clinic, said Friday
Valiquette had been arrested at the clinic during anti-abortion
protests.
   ``He was arrested for illegally entering the clinic, trying to
disrupt the operations. We could not prosecute him, because he
would have been judged incompetent to stand trial,'' Ferrell said.
   Valiquette escaped from the Middle Tennessee Mental Health
Institute sometime Friday, said Nashville police detective Jim
Fuqua.
   ``My understanding is that he was at the mental health institute
because he suffered from delusions that he could fly,'' Fuqua said.
   The Nashville fire marshall investigating the attempted suicide
found anti-abortion pamphlets on the man, Fuqua said. ``A nurse
asked him if he did this as a protest and he nodded,'' he said.
   Valiquette was committed to the institute by General Sessions
Court Judge William Faimon after leaping from the balcony of a
downtown shopping arcade in June 1988 in what police described as a
suicide attempt. He suffered a severe broken arm and severe head
injuries, The Tennessean reported in today's editions.
   The Nashville morning newspaper also reported Valiquette had
escaped at least three times before and left the institute Friday
during visiting hours.
   Two Nashville firefighters at a station across the street saw
Valiquette walk up to the clinic but realized what he was doing too
late to stop him.
   ``He reached in his pocket, came out with a Bic lighter, flicked
it and was a human torch right before my eyes,'' said Howard Cage,
a firefighter and emergency medical technician.
   The two firefighters then drove an engine into the street.
   ``We pulled off the hose and extinguished him, put burn sheets
over him and administered oxygen,'' Cage said.
   Ferrell said the clinic closed for renovations on Feb. 24 after
state inspectors found numerous violations of fire and health
regulations. Ferrell said he hopes the clinic can reopen next week.
   After being the target of numerous anti-abortion protests, the
clinic obtained a court injunction limiting the number of
protesters, Ferrel said.
   ``I'm really sorry this happened, this is something that all of
us sure want to avoid,'' Ferrell said.
   ``For any sound thinking person, they will realize this person
was incompetent, I think, and it should have no effect on
pro-abortion or anti-abortion debate,'' Ferrell said.

<TEXT>
   Demonstrators gathered today to
protest a nearby white supremacist conference, but many people who
oppose racism stayed away out of fear of violence.
   Law enforcement officers, meanwhile, made plans to head off any
potential confrontations between the two groups.
   As many as 2,000 demonstrators were expected to march in the
seven-mile ``Walk for Racial Equality,'' which is planned to end
two miles from the Aryan Nations compound, site of the conference
of neo-Nazi youths.
   Sheriff's deputies and officers from the Idaho State Police and
Coeur d'Alene Police planned a show of force around the anti-racism
marchers to discourage confrontations.
   ``We've established what we feel to be tactics that are going to
ensure the safety of all the parties involved,'' said Capt. Tom
Dickson.
   Fewer than 100 neo-Nazi youths were believed to be staying at
the 30-acre ranch of Richard Butler, founder of the Church of Jesus
Christ Christian, Aryan Nations, a white supremacist organization
that wants to turn the Northwest into a ``whites only'' homeland.
   Butler said white supremacist leaders, including Ku Klux Klan
officials, will speak and conduct workshops.
   Sheriff's deputies set up checkpoints Friday on roads leading to
the camp a few miles north of Coeur d'Alene to check
identifications of people entering the area.
   Lisa Anderson, organizer of Citizens for Nonviolent Action
Against Racism, the Coeur d'Alene-based group sponsoring the march,
said she expected few problems.
   Although the march has been endorsed by the Rev. Jesse Jackson's
Rainbow Coalition, The New Jewish Agenda and Washington Gov. Booth
Gardner, groups such as the Anti-Defamation League of B'Nai B'rith
were staying away.
   Marvin Stern, regional ADL director in Seattle, said his group
was concerned about placing an additional burden on law enforcement
and a potential for violence.
   Idaho Gov. Cecil Andrus also refused to endorse the march,
saying it could promote violence and give the neo-Nazis more
publicity.
   In a statement issued Friday, Andrus lashed out at the skinheads.
   ``The people of Idaho stand united against hate groups and those
who would spread a message of fear and intolerance,'' he said.
   Leaders of organizations formed during the past decade to combat
the Aryan Nations planned a picnic and other events a few miles
away from the white supremacist gathering.
   ``We think that a march just does them too much honor and
respect,'' said Norm Gissell, chairman of the Kootenai County Task
Force on Human Relations.

   As many as 150,000 students and their supporters,
waving fists and chanting ``Long live freedom,'' demonstrated today
against the Communist system as China's leaders watched from behind
a wall of soldiers.
   Facing more than 8,000 troops, students shouted, ``Down with
dictatorship, down with corruption!'' while top members of the
Communist Party hierarchy filed out of a funeral for ousted party
chief Hu Yaobang.
   The protest in Tiananmen Square, the symbolic political center
of China, was one of the clearest rejections ever of the Communist
system by China's increasingly disaffected youth. It also marked
the culmination of a week-long commemoration of Hu's death last
Saturday.
   During 15 hours of demonstrations that featured no major
incidents, the students waved colored pro-democracy banners and
turned the plaza into a sea of red and white banners.
   The students confronted China's leaders as they filed into a
memorial service for Hu in the Great Hall, chanting anti-government
slogans. Hu, who died of a heart attack, was 73.
   The turnout was one of the largest in China since the Communist
victory over the Nationalists in 1949, and the biggest in 13 years,
when the death of Premier Chou En-lai sparked an outpouring of
grief and anger toward the leftist government and an end to the
1966-76 Cultural Revolution.
   But major differences with the bloody, spontaneous 1976 protest
remained. Today's protest left few people injured and was well
organized.
   The government has rejected all the students' demands, including
greater freedom of speech and press, more money for education,
disclosure of the incomes of top officials and reassessment of Hu's
historical role.
   When the students ended their demonstration, they departed
peacefully in groups that represented about 30 universities in
Beijing and other cities.
   In Shanghai, about 1,500 people marched through downtown, also
to commemorate Hu's death. Earlier today, about 2,000 students
marched on the campus of East Normal University.
   In Beijing, the traffic was stopped along Changan Boulevard, the
capital's main avenue, and people climbed trees to get a better
view of the procession.
   The students said they would go back to their campuses and
boycott classes.
   When the 4,000 officials attending the ceremony started to
arrive this morning, the students let out a roar, waved their
banners and raised their fingers in V-for-victory salutes.
   Some officials, protected by a triple line of military troops,
stopped momentarily to listen.
   During the ceremony, party General Secretary Zhao Ziyang praised
his predecessor, saying ``as a Marxist, Hu Yaobang led a glorious
life.''
   Hu was forced to resign in disgrace in January 1987 after being
accused by party conservatives of being soft on student
demonstrators and Western liberal ideas.
   Zhao's 10-minute speech, before a large portrait of Hu draped in
black bunting, made no specific mention of Hu's ouster and did not,
as demanded by the students, attempt to reassess Hu's performance.
   Zhao said only that Hu was a man ``brave enough to admit his
mistakes and to insist upon what he thought was right. He never
tried to hold back his opinions.''
   Some of the aging ideologues who are believed to have engineered
Hu's ouster did not attend the ceremony. Among those absent were
former President Li Xiannian, former Politburo member Bo Yibo and
former party propaganda chief Deng Liqun.
   Senior leader Deng Xiaoping, 84, looking tired and fragile,
circled the glass-encased casket and shook hands with Hu's family
and wife, Li Zhao. Hu's body was clad in a Western suit and draped
with a red Communist Party flag.
   Flags were flown at half-staff on Tiananmen Square and in front
of the Communist Party headquarters, scene of a clash between
demonstrators and police earlier this week.
   The official Xinhua News Agency said 1 million people, some in
crowds five deep, lined the streets to watch the motorcade that
carried Hu's body to the Babaoshan state cemetery in western
Beijing for cremation.
   It said people carried banners reading ``farewell, Comrade
Yaobang'' and ``Yaobang, we'll always remember you.''
   Zhao's speech was broadcast over loudspeakers on the square but
the students paid little attention.
   As soon as he finished they resumed their chants of ``long live
democracy.'' As officials descended the steps of the Great Hall,
they shouted: ``we demand dialogue!'' and ``come down Li Peng!''
   Li, China's premier, is a technocrat regarded as lukewarm toward
economic and political reforms. He has said that social stability
must take priority in China, and that ``excessive democracy'' would
harm the nation.
   Unlike the Soviet Union, which has held direct parliamentary
elections and given its press greater freedom, China has taken the
lead in economic reforms. It has taken only small, cautious steps
to make its political system more open.

   The man identified as the principal suspect
in a dozen drug-related torture slayings in Mexico near the U.S.
border denied he was the killer but said he may have information on
the deaths, officials said.
   Hector Fragoso Burgueno, 45, was held without bond Friday at the
Federal Correctional Center after his arrest late Thursday at a
mobile home in an isolated area about 30 miles west of Tucson.
   ``He's the principal one, according to the witnesses,'' said
Enrique Cecena, zone commander with the Judicial Police of the
Mexican state of Sonora.
   Mexican federal and state authorities will file formal requests
for Fragoso's return to Mexico, officials said.
   Gerard Murphy, a Drug Enforcement Administration special agent,
said Fragoso ``has made statements extricating himself from any
culpability in the murders in Agua Prieta. However, he has said
that he may be able to provide information that authorities are not
aware of.''
   Fragoso was found with a woman identified as his wife, Anna
Marie Fragoso. Scott Coffin, deputy chief agent for the U.S. Border
Patrol in Tucson, said Fragoso was being held as an illegal alien
under a federal immigration arrest warrant. His wife could be
voluntarily deported to Mexico, officials said.
   Fragoso owned the ranch near the Mexican border town of Agua
Prieta where the bodies were found on March 29 and April 1. He had
shaved his moustache, changed his hair style and altered his
eyebrows, but ``it didn't help him. We recognized him right away,''
said Pima County Sheriff's Maj. Dennis Douglas.
   Douglas said investigators found Fragoso after getting various
tips, including some from a local crime hotline and from the TV
show ``America's Most Wanted,'' which had a segment Sunday on
Fragoso.
   Authorities were investigating whether the Agua Prieta killings
were linked to the slayings of five people whose bodies were found
in a Tucson shed shortly before the Agua Prieta bodies were
discovered.
   Cecena said 11 of the Agua Prieta victims apparently were killed
after they witnessed the murder of one person.
   The Border Patrol said Fragoso has an extensive arrest history,
ranging from drug and weapons violations to assault, sexual assault
and robbery.
   Like the unrelated ritual slayings of 15 people in Matamoros
discovered last week, authorities consider the Agua Prieta killings
to be drug-related.

<TEXT>
   Residents angered by government-imposed
price increases defied a curfew and rioted in this town near Amman
today. King Hussein cut short an overseas trip and headed home from
the United States.
   Eight people have been killed in the violence that began
Tuesday, and the presidents of Jordan's professional associations
called on Hussein to withdraw the armed forces from towns and
villages to prevent further bloodshed.
   They said in a statement that the government had set a bad
example in implementing austerity measures and called for elections
for a new government.
   Hussein will return to the worst unrest in his country since his
army put down violence by Palestinian guerrillas in 1971.
   The rioting began Tuesday in the south, the bedrock of his
support, in response to price increases of 10 percent to 50 percent
on gasoline, cigarettes, heating oil and other commodities.
   By Thursday night the violence had spread to the north.
   On Friday, rioters in the northern town of Salt threw rocks at
police and looted buildings. They shouted support for Hussein, but
called for the ouster of Prime Minister Zaid Rifai, whom they blame
for austerity measures and declining living standards.
   After the rioting, children played inside shattered offices, and
hundreds of people milled around on the glass-strewn streets in the
city of 100,000 about 10 miles north of Amman. No injuries were
reported in today's riots.
   ``We are fed up with this government. They have stolen all our
money,'' said a man in his 60s who refused to give his name. He
said demonstrators ``trust the king's leadership and we know he
will respond.''
   King Hussein, who was on a state visit to Washington, canceled
his trip to Britain that was set for today and because of the
rioting instead will return home, the Jordanian Embassy in London
said.
   The first riots occurred in the southern city of Maan, where the
government said four civilians and one police officer were killed.
Three other people were reported killed in Mazar, 55 miles south of
Amman.
   On Friday, troops banned Moslems from attending weekly prayers
in mosques in Maan and other southern cities in an attempt to
prevent more unrest.
   Cancellation of Friday prayers is highly unusual in an Islamic
country. The Koran, Islam's holy book, calls on Moslems to
participate in the ceremony, and most take it as a binding duty.
   State-run Jordan Television broadcast an appeal to Jordanians on
Friday night to end the violence, and for the first time showed
pictures of smashed buildings and destroyed vehicles.
   ``These are the services which the government tried to provide
for the whole country, and we paid with our tears and with our
sweat and with our blood to have them built,'' said Mohammed Amin,
the Jordan Television director who narrated the 20-minute program.
   ``These were destroyed by a bunch of terrorists.''
   Amin said the damage only would add to Jordan's economic
problems ``because now we have added pressure.''
   The government announced the price increases Sunday as part of
an agreement with the International Monetary Fund to reschedule
Jordan's $6 billion foreign debt. They came on top of rising
unemployment and soaring inflation.
   Israeli radio and TV reported the difficulties ``to instigate
problems,'' Amin said, and ``news agencies are exaggerating the
picture of the situation.''
   Government officials earlier hinted that Moslem fundamentalists
had inflamed the unrest. Most of the rioting has involved native
Jordanians, not the Palestinian half of the population.

<TEXT>
   Syrian forces today fired rockets into
the port of Jounieh, the only escape route for Lebanon's
beleaguered Christians.
   No casualties were reported as sporadic 122mm Soviet-designed
Grad rockets exploded around Jounieh, 10 miles north of Beirut, and
the coastal highway running north to the ancient port of Byblos.
   The attack came during a three-day lull in the battle between
the Syrians and allied Moslem Druse militia and the mainly
Christian units of Lebanon's fractured armed forces under army
commander Gen. Michel Aoun.
   By police count, at least 270 people have been killed and nearly
1,000 wounded in ferocious artillery, rocket and tank exchanges
that began March 8 in the divided capital.
   Police, speaking on condition of anonymity, reported that an
estimated 4,000 Christians were gathered at Jounieh to await
ferries from Cyprus, 130 miles to the northeast, to take them to
safety.
   The 4,000-ton Baroness M, one of two ferries that have carried
12,000 Christians to Cyprus in the last six weeks, was anchored off
Jounieh on Friday night. It took 1,200 people from Jounieh in small
boats.
   The other ferry, the Larnaca Rose, suspended its Jounieh run
three days ago after it came under Syrian shelling near the
lebanese port.
   Cypriot shipping officials said it was not known when the next
ferry will sail for Jounieh.
   Beirut's Moslem-controlled Voice of the Nation today termed the
Syrian rocketing a warning to ships to stay away from the besieged
enclave. ``It will persist as long as the blockade imposed by Aoun
perists,'' it said.
   The latest fighting broke out two days after Aoun, seeking to
restore state authority, blockaded illegal ports south of Beirut
run by Moslem militias.
   Aoun's troops in the 310-square-mile Christian enclave, which is
ringed on the three landward sides by hostile forces, have not
returned the Syrian fire since most fighting died down late
Wednesday.

   Automatic teller machines helped
police track down a winery worker accused of murdering seven
people, including his wife and two daughters.
   The Sonoma County sheriff's office persuaded Wells Fargo Bank to
extend unlimited credit to Ramon Salcido and arranged to track him
through any transactions made with his automatic teller card, said
Sheriff Dick Michaelsen.
   A tip from Salcido's sister and brother-in-law in Mexico also
helped authorities find him, the San Francisco Chronicle reported
today, citing unidentified U.S. diplomatic and law enforcement
sources.
   Salcido, 28, who also is accused of killing his mother-in-law
and her two daughters and a co-worker at the winery where he was a
forklift operator, was arraigned on murder charges Friday after
being captured in Mexico.
   Salcido was reported to have run out of bank funds last week
while on a cocaine-and-alcohol binge that friends said preceded the
April 14 slaughter.
   He tried to use a bank card at least once at a Wells Fargo
branch that morning in San Rafael, 30 miles south, and possibly
again later in San Francisco while heading for Mexico, authorities
said.
   The manhunt ended Wednesday when Salcido was arrested in western
Mexico near his hometown of Los Mochis.
   A spokesman for the sheriff's department, citing a gag order
imposed by a judge on Friday, would not comment on the report about
family members tipping off police.
   Salcido, who also is charged with three counts of attempted
murder, appeared in court Friday in handcuffs and a bulletproof
vest. He did not enter a plea but will return to court May 5. He
could get the death penalty if convicted.
   Salcido's attorney, Chief Public Defender Marteen Miller said he
expected Salcido would enter a plea of innocent by reason of
insanity. He added that he would have his client undergo
psychiatric and neurological tests.
   ``I expect to find some brain lesion or tumor,'' said Miller,
who called the crimes, ``so bizarre, so incomprehensible.''
   ``God, I hope I find something,'' said Miller, who also planned
to ask that the trial be moved because of all the publicity the
case has received.
   The prosecutor, however, discounted speculation that the rampage
was fueled in part by alcohol and cocaine us and said he believed
Salcido is legally sane.
   ``The final decision about his state of mind will be made in
court,'' said District Attorney Gene Tunney. ``Those were not the
acts of an irrational berserker.''
   After his arrest, Salcido told Mexican television reporters and
law enforcement agents he killed his American-born wife, Angela,
24, and a winery co-worker, Tracy Toovey, in a jealous rage,
believing Toovey and his wife were romantically involved, according
to federal officials.
   Also killed in the series of attacks across the Sonoma Valley 40
miles north of San Francisco were Salcido's mother-in-law and his
two sisters-in-law, 8 and 12.
   Salcido also is accused of killing two daughters, 1 and 4, who
were found dead at a dump April 15. Their throats had been slashed.
   Another daughter, Carmina, who turns 3 on Monday, also was found
at the dump with a slashed throat but is recovering and has
identified her father as her attacker, police said.

   Suspected communist guerrillas
attacked the homes of two government militiamen in the southern
Philippines today. Seven people, including three children and one
militiaman, were killed, police said.
   A police report said the attack, with automatic rifles and
grenade launchers, occurred in the remote town of Sindangan in
Zamboanga del Norte province, 40 miles northwest of Pagadian and
460 miles southeast of Manila.
   Sgt. Gideon Rodrigo, the Sindangan police station commander,
said about 30 members of the communist New People's Army fired
simultaneously on the two houses with M-16 rifles and M-203 grenade
launchers. Seven occupants were killed and five were wounded,
including the militiaman who survived, he said.
   Rodrigo said government militiamen owned the homes and that the
attack was in retaliation for their participation in the
government's campaign against the rebels. The insurgents took away
the militiamen's farm animals, he said.
   In nearby Zamboanga del Sur province, two militiamen were killed
Friday when about 200 rebels attacked the town of Mahayag and held
residents for nearly one hour before escaping, a military report
said. It said the rebels issued a challenge to soldiers in the area
and fought with them for 30 minutes.
   In another attack Friday, rebels killed two militiamen in the
town of Molave in adjoining Misamis Oriental province, the military
said.

<HEAD>Walesa Says Solidarity Destined to Shrink</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARY BETH SHERIDAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>ROME (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Solidarity leader Lech Walesa said today that the
East bloc's first independent trade union probably will get smaller
as other independent groups form in Poland.
   ``From Solidarity, other economic and political organizations
will be born,'' Walesa said at a news conference ending his
three-day visit to Italy.
   ``Solidarity for the moment is huge but it will become smaller
with the growth of other organizations. This is the logical course
of events.''
   The Polish independent trade union was crushed by security
forces in 1981 and outlawed in 1982. Poland's communist government
restored the legality of Solidarity on Monday after reaching
agreement with the Solidarity-led opposition on political and
social reforms.
   The government is seeking support from Solidarity and aid from
the West to restore its shattered economy.
   Coinciding with the official recognition of Solidarity,
President Bush announced a $1 billion economic aid program for
Poland. Walesa said the program was ``a great step forward taken by
Mr. Bush.''
   Walesa, winner of the 1983 Nobel Peace Prize, indicated he
planned to visit other countries as an ``ambassador of Solidarity''
but did not say which ones.
   Walesa came to Italy seeking economic investment in Poland and
the blessing of fellow Pole Pope John Paul II for the country's new
political course.
   The Solidarity leader said he would like to see the pope make
another trip to Poland but that John Paul had many obligations.
   ``And because we love him, we will spare him,'' Walesa said.
   ``For this reason, we told him not to worry so much about Poland
_ we have reached these accords, worry yourself less. It's clear,
though, that he won't listen to us and will continue to be
concerned.''

   A former Pentagon employee and a
dismissed executive of Hazeltine Corp., a defense contractor, have
been given prison terms stemming from the ``Ill Wind''
investigation of military procurement corruption.
   U.S. District Court Judge Claude M. Hilton on Friday sentenced
Jack A. Sherman, 52, a one-time civilian Marine Corps contracting
supervisor, to 18 months in prison for taking $43,500 in bribes
from an unidentified defense consultant in exchange for inside
information on military contracts.
   Hilton also sentenced former Hazeltine vice president Joseph R.
Colarusso, 58, to 10 months in prison and fined him $30,000 for
improperly obtaining inside information about a $150 million Navy
electronics contract sought by Hazeltine last year.
   Colarusso pleaded guilty in January to conspiracy to defraud the
federal government and to commit wire fraud in connection with his
hiring of a defense consultant who obtained the inside data by
bribing a Navy engineer.
   Also in January, Sherman pleaded guilty to bribery and
conspiracy and agreed to pay federal taxes on his unreported bribe
income. He will also pay back the $43,500, which was supplied by
the FBI. The consultant who passed the money to Sherman was working
as an FBI informant.

<HEAD>Takeshita Received $375,000 Loan From Recruit, Reports Say</HEAD>

<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Prime Minister Noboru Takeshita received a $378,000
loan in 1987 from the company at the center of a growing bribery
scandal, Japanese news media reported today.
   Takeshita, who heads the governing Liberal Democratic Party,
received the loan from Recruit Co. and repaid it several months
later, Kyodo News Service and the Japan Broadcasting Corp. said.
   They said officials in Takeshita's office confirmed the loan but
did not disclose the terms of its repayment.
   Takeshita did not mention the loan when he told a Parliament
committee on April 11 that he had received more than $1 million in
political donations from Recruit between 1985 and 1987.
   Recruit, an information services company, is suspected of using
political donations and other financial transactions to gain favors
from politicians and bureaucrats.
   Although pressure on Takeshita to step down to appease public
and opposition criticism over the scandal has grown in the past
week, a lack of strong candidates untainted by the scandal makes
Takeshita's resignation problematic.
   Virtually none of the most influential Liberal Democratic
leaders could take over from Takeshita, says Takeshi Sasaki,
political science professor at Tokyo University.
   ``There is a leadership vacuum. There's literally nobody
powerful who has not been tainted by the scandal,'' said Robert M.
Orr, professor of political science at Temple University in Tokyo.
   The opposition is demanding that Takeshita resign and that
former Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone testify in Parliament on
his own role in the Recruit affair.
   A survey by the nationwide newspaper Mainichi Shimbun released
Friday showed that 35.7 percent of Liberal Democratic Party members
in Japan's Parliament responding to the poll think Takeshita should
resign.
   Takeshita and Nakasone are among 17 politicians who reportedly
benefited from unlisted, cut-rate shares in a real-estate
subsidiary of Recruit. The shares, sold by the company to about 160
influential politicians, public officials and businessmen, produced
substantial profits for the recipients after over-the-counter
trading began in October 1986.
   Although the transactions were not illegal, they aroused
suspicions of bribery and influence-peddling. The result was an
outcry over fund-raising practices and the cozy relationship
between businessmen and politicians.

<HEAD>High Court Considers Limiting Women's Right to Abortion</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICHARD CARELLI</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court hears arguments this week on
limiting _ or even ending _ women's abortion rights, but the battle
is sure to continue no matter what is decided in the Missouri case
before the justices.
   The dispute over the Missouri abortion-regulation law, for which
arguments will be conducted Wednesday, has become one of history's
most closely watched high court cases.
   There are two reasons:
   _Missouri officials and the Bush administration are urging the
court to use the case to overturn or substantially limit the
landmark 1973 decision legalizing abortion.
   _Even if the court does not accept that invitation and decides
the Missouri case narrowly, the decision _ expected in July _ will
be viewed as a barometer of the current court's commitment to the
16-year-old ruling in Roe vs. Wade.
   ``If Roe is reversed, the nation's whole political landscape
could change,'' said Kate Michelman, executive director of the
National Abortion Rights Action League. ``State by state, our goal
would be obtaining a legislative right to abortion, making the lack
of any constitutional right irrelevant.''
   She added: ``It no longer would be acceptable for any politician
to be anti-choice.''
   Reversal of the 1973 ruling would allow states to more
stringently restrict access to abortions, or even ban virtually all
abortions.
   James Bopp, general counsel of the anti-abortion National Right
to Life Committee, said, ``Roe vs. Wade is doomed at some point in
the foreseeable future but the pro-choice people are laying the
legal groundwork for other attacks on restrictions, already arguing
that they amount to gender-based discrimination or involuntary
servitude.''
   And if the 1973 decision emerges unscathed by the court's
decision in the Missouri case?
   ``We (in the pro-choice movement) would still be vulnerable,''
Michelman said in a recent interview.
   Laurie Ann Ramsey, director of education for Americans United
for Life, agreed. ``Reversal by 1992 is part of our strategic plan.
If not in (the Missouri case), then in the next'' she said. ``We
want to keep as many cases in the pipeline as possible.''
   Michelman's apprehension and Ramsey's confidence stem from
changes in the high court's membership since it ruled, by a 7-2
vote, in 1973 that women have a constitutional right to abortion.
   Only three members of the original Roe vs. Wade majority remain
_ Justices Harry A. Blackmun, William J. Brennan and Thurgood
Marshall. Each has supported the 1973 decision in subsequent
rulings.
   Justice John Paul Stevens, who joined the court in 1975, is a
dependable ``pro-Roe'' ally.
   The two 1973 dissenters, now-Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist
and Justice Byron R. White, still oppose the ruling.
   Any significant retreat from Roe vs. Wade will have to attract
the court's three most junior justices _ Sandra Day O'Connor,
Antonin Scalia and Anthony M. Kennedy.
   All are appointees of former president Ronald Reagan, an
outspoken critic of the high court's abortion rulings.
   O'Connor criticized the rationale of Roe vs. Wade while
dissenting from a 1986 decision striking down certain abortion
regulations in Pennsylvania. But it is unknown whether she
disagrees with the core holding of the 1973 decision _ that women
have a fundamental right to abortion.
   Scalia and Kennedy have not yet ruled in any abortion case, but
many believe both favor cutting back abortion rights.
   ``Justice O'Connor is the key,'' NARAL's Michelman said. ``We
wrote our (friend-of-the-court) brief to speak to Sandra Day
O'Connor.''
   Dawn Johnsen, the NARAL legal director who wrote the brief,
said, ``If we are going to win it's likely to be by one vote.
That's not the kind of victory with which one can be comfortable.''
   In all, the justices received a record 78 friend-of-the-court
briefs _ the judicial branch's equivalent of lobbying _ from
interested individuals and organizations not actually involved of
the Missouri dispute.
   The justices often give such unsolicited advice close attention.
   The same cannot be said, however, for the tens of thousands of
letters and hundreds of telephone calls the court is receiving
daily from Americans expressing their views on abortion.
   ``This is not a popularity contest,'' court spokeswoman Toni
House said. ``This is a war of ideas, not numbers.''
   If a war, it is one with no end in sight.

<HEAD>Congress Off to Rocky Start in Bicentennial Year</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The historic 101st Congress is out of sorts.
   The institution began its bicentennial year pledging to
cooperate with a new president and touting an ambitious legislative
agenda.
   But lawmakers have spent their first four months killing a
50-percent pay raise in embarrassment, flinging morals charges at
defense secretary nominee John Tower and investigating the ethics
of their highest-ranking official, House Speaker Jim Wright.
   ``This is worse than the People's Court,'' said Rep. David
McCurdy, D-Okla., likening the institution to the television
tribunal. ``The pay raise, John Tower, Jim Wright _ I'm baffled.
What's going on? I don't think any incumbent comes out looking very
good after this sideshow.''
   By the end of last week, Congress had met seven fewer days this
year than it had by the same date in 1987, the beginning of the
100th Congress. Sixteen laws have been enacted this year, none of
them major and 10 of them commemorative measures like ``National
Agriculture Day.''
   Beyond the statistics, there's a widespread sense that Congress
has been sleepwalking through its legislative paces this year,
distracted and preoccupied by its own internal problems.
   ``We're tired of a do-nothing Congress,'' said Rep. Mickey
Edwards, R-Okla., as House Republicans last week accused majority
Democrats of ignoring important legislation. ``We demand that the
Democrats bring these issues before the House ... so we can do the
job we were elected to do.''
   The implication is that Wright and his top lieutenants are so
busy playing defense against the 69 rules violations alleged
against the speaker that they have lost their legislative compass.
   Democratic leaders, who are responsible for the Capitol's
output, disagree and point to bipartisan agreements with the Bush
administration on the budget and aid to the Nicaraguan Contra
rebels, and to legislation on the minimum wage, savings and loans,
and military base closings.
   ``While everybody would like to see the (Wright) matter resolved
as quickly as possible, the function of the House is proceeding,''
said Rep. Tom Foley, D-Wash., the majority leader. ``The speaker is
moving important legislative matters. It's not true that the House
of Representatives is in a gridlock condition.''
   Congresses are notoriously slow-starting, especially in the
first session of a two-year term. And Hill leaders did bide their
time for the early part of the year waiting for Bush administration
budget proposals, appointments and legislative initiatives.
   Even at that, the year so far has been less productive than most.
   While the budget agreement does add some oil to the legislative
machinery, it failed to seriously address the nation's deficit
problem. And the base closings action was merely a ratification of
steps taken last year by an independent commission that took the
political heat off Congress.
   ``It is a confluence of what would be the normal slowness, added
to by some distractions,'' said Christopher Deering, a political
scientist at George Washington University and close observer of the
legislative process. ``That has conspired to make this, in
appearance especially, a slow start. Instead of substance, they've
had to focus on sidelights.''
   The most blinding current sidelight is the Wright investigation.
   Last week, the ethics committee formally charged the Texas
Democrat with 69 instances of violating House rules. Lawyers for
Wright and the committee are fencing over arrangements for the
speaker to appear and mount a personal defense before the panel,
and it appears the case will drag on for at least a few more weeks.
   One aspect of the case, a complicated oil well transaction which
yielded Wright huge profits last year, remains under investigation
and could yet cause additional problems for the speaker. Waiting in
the wings is a separate ethics case against Wright, alleging that
he improperly disclosed a covert CIA operation in Nicaragua.
Republicans say they plan to press the matter.
   ``He's shark bait right now, and that's not fun,'' said McCurdy.
``This is a crazy process.''
   On the House floor and in corners all around the Capitol, Wright
has replaced Tower and the pay raise as the prime topic of
conversation. ``They're talking about it every second,'' said Rep.
Beryl Anthony, D-Ark. Even Democratic senators worried about their
party's image have taken a rare interest in what happens on the
other side of the building.
   One House Democrat, Rep. Bill Richardson of New Mexico, said the
mood of his colleagues is at its lowest ebb in years.
   ``There's been a slowdown and a morale loss,'' Richardson said.
``It's a very bleak period. I've been in Congress seven years and
I've never felt so bad and down about being a member of Congress.''
   Wright's defenders call the charges _ that he failed to report
$145,000 in improper gifts from a friend with a direct interest in
legislation, and sought to evade limits on outside income through
bulk sales of a book he wrote _ trivial and the reaction to them
overblown.
   ``It should be beneath the dignity of this House to question
that kind of thing,'' said Rep. James Scheuer, D-N.Y. ``There is a
certain sense of outrage that this process has taken on a life of
its own that was never intended.''
   Wright himself has sought to maintain a normal schedule, but
with varying results. Much of his days lately have been consumed by
meetings with his lawyer, William C. Oldaker, and with political
allies plotting defense strategy. Wright's normally daily press
conferences have become less frequent.
   At one recent one at which reporters peppered him with ethics
questions, he finally asked in exasperation: ``Do you have any
questions about the government of the United States?''

<HEAD>Intelligence Report Cites Continued Growth in Soviet Defense Spending</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BRYAN BRUMLEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Soviet defense spending rose 3 percent last
year, despite President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's promises to cut his
military budget, according to an intelligence report released
Sunday.
   But the study, prepared jointly by the CIA and the Pentagon's
Defense Intelligence Agency, also said Gorbachev was laying the
groundwork for his proposed 14.2 percent cut in defense spending.
   The study said chopping military spending so sharply would
require the Soviets to reduce their armed forces by more than the
500,000-troop reduction announced by Gorbachev last December,
meaning further cutbacks in the Soviet military.
   The newly declassified report painted a grim overall picture of
the Soviet economy. It said Gorbachev had been forced to slow the
pace of his economic reforms and to delay such key steps as
allowing the market to set wholesale and retail prices.
   While the reforms have a good chance of success in the long run,
they are likely to cause Gorbachev short term political problems
from consumers who want to see faster improvement and from
bureaucrats who resent their loss of power over economic
decision-making, the report said.
   The economy was hampered by sluggish industrial and agricultural
performance, disruptions and confusion stemming from Gorbachev's
reforms, and the cost of coping with the earthquake that struck
Armenia last December, the report said.
   ``According to our estimates, the Soviet economy grew by only
about 1.5 percent in 1988 _ the second straight poor yearly
showing,'' the study said.
   The cost of rebuilding Armenia will exceed the estimated $11.2
billion price tag of cleaning up after the 1986 Chernobyl nuclear
reactor disaster, the CIA predicted.
   All these factors contributed to a budget deficit that the CIA
estimated at 9 percent of the Soviet Gross National Product, which
is the value of all goods and services produced by an economy. Last
year the Kremlin admitted for the first time that it was running a
deficit, although estimates of the amount varied among Soviet
economists.
   Poor economic performance has forced Gorbachev to back away from
some programs, and the need to provide consumer goods was impelling
him to decrease defense spending, the report said.
   ``Soviet media indicated that the campaigns to modernize
industrial plant and equipment and reform the economic system and
even the once much-vaunted anti-alcohol campaign were not only
failing but were occasioning major disruptions,'' it said.
   ``Gorbachev remains committed to his original vision of a
revitalized economy,'' the report said. ``He has, however,
apparently concluded that he cannot realize this vision as rapidly
as he once thought possible, nor proceed directly along the path he
initially planned to follow.''
   ``The shifts that Gorbachev has implemented, in our view, have
the potential, if sustained, to boost consumer welfare and bring a
sense of order to the economy,'' the report said.
   ``Gorbachev has acknowledged that consumer welfare must be
substantially improved soon if the regime is to develop broad-based
popular support for perestroika,'' as the reforms are called in
Russian, it said.
   That will mean a 14.2 percent cut in defense spending, Gorbachev
announced in January, the first time he put a firm number on cuts
that had been discussed as part of a new military doctrine known as
``reasonable sufficiency.''
   Despite proclamation of the new ``defensive'' military doctrine
over the past two years, ``Soviet defense spending, as measured in
constant 1982 rubles, grew by roughly 3 percent, in line with the
growth rates of the past several years,'' the CIA said.
   ``Procurement of weapons systems was again a major contributor
to growth,'' the CIA said. ``Missile procurement _ particularly
ICBMs (intercontinental ballistic missiles) and strategic
surface-to-air missiles _ also displayed growth.''
   ``Last year, however, Gorbachev took several actions that
evidently were intended to lay the groundwork for future military
cuts,'' the report said.
   Key points of Gorbachev's plan to cut military spending ``remain
unclear,'' the report said, and may involve substantially larger
cuts than the 500,000 troop reduction announced last December.
   ``Indeed, our estimates indicate that to reduce their total
defense budget by 14.2 percent, the Soviets would have to go beyond
the cutbacks in military programs that they have specifically
promised to make.''

   Michael Jackson has obtained a court order
barring a company from selling what he claims are bootleg Beatles
videotapes.
   Jackson, who owns the copyrights to most Beatles songs, sued
Video Wholesalers of Neptune over the sale of the videos, which
include tapes of the Fab Four in concert at New York's Shea Stadium
and in Washington, D.C.
   U.S. District Judge Garrett E. Brown on Friday issued a
preliminary injunction against sale of the videos pending the
outcome of the lawsuit.
   Jackson's attorneys argued that the tapes infringed on the
copyrights, that Beatles fans would be turned off by their poor
quality and that the films would hurt Jackson's investment should
he decide to market the tapes himself.
   The video company argued that the Beatles never protected the
films with a copyright and that the Fab Four songs on the videos
are in the public domain.
   Songs on the tapes include ``I Want To Hold Your Hand,'' ``She
Loves You,'' ``Yesterday,'' ``A Hard Day's Night'' and ``Help.''

   A surgeon has been freed on
$250,000 bail in an attack on his ex-wife, John Wayne's daughter.
   Dr. Thomas A. Gionis, 35, had been held without bail since his
April 4 arrest in the beating of Aissa Wayne, 33. Municipal Judge
Susanne S. Shaw ruled Friday there was sufficient evidence to link
him to the attack, and she also set bail.
   Gionis is charged with conspiring to commit assault with a
deadly weapon in the beating of Ms. Wayne and financier Roger Luby
at Luby's estate Oct. 3. Prosecutors linked him to two men
allegedly hired to attack the two.
   The Pomona orthopedic surgeon is battling his former wife for
custody of their 2-year-old daughter. The judge told Gionis he had
``snapped'' and gone ``off the deep end'' as a result of the
divorce and custody fight.

   The heart-wrenching news from a distant
ocean, the vigil while the names of the dead trickle in, the
playing of taps for the fallen _ these are not new to townspeople
here, who cheer for the Navy's victories and cry for its defeats.
   None of the 47 sailors killed in a gun turret explosion
Wednesday on the battleship USS Iowa listed the area as their
hometown. Yet the people here are claiming them as their own _ just
as they have done so many times before when death strikes a
Norfolk-based ship.
   ``There isn't an `us' or `them.' Even when the tragedy strikes
far away from here, it is felt here. That ship is part of our
community,'' said Mayor Joseph Leafe.
   Overnight, the Norfolk-Newport News-Hampton metropolitan area of
1.3 million became a small town. In schools, shops, bars and on the
streets, the topic of conversation was the Iowa _ who was aboard,
who had word, who was helping, who had lost someone.
   ``It's hard to find anybody in any walk of life in this area
that didn't start out in the Navy,'' said Donald Smith, a
sociologist at Old Dominion University. ``With this area's long
history as the world's largest naval facility, the impact goes
deeper. Young people get out of the Navy, they seem to stay around
here.''
   The military's influence is seen throughout Hampton Roads, as
the area where the James and Elizabeth rivers meet the Chesapeake
Bay is known.
   ``The economic relationship between the military and civilian
sectors is a very close one,'' said Wolfgang Pindur, director of
research for Old Dominion's College of Business and Public
Administration. ``The military is the major employer. That isolates
us from any downward trends in the economy.''
   The area has 138,000 active military men and women and 65,000
military retirees, according to government statistics. The annual
payroll and federal spending for the area is $5.53 billion. Newport
News Shipbuilding, which is building nuclear aircraft carriers, is
the state's biggest private employer.
   By comparison, tourism, the area's other major industry, brings
in about $1.3 billion.
   While the civilian-military economic marriage seems a sweet one,
socially there has always been some friction.
   There are tales of ``sailors and dogs keep off the grass'' signs
appearing during World War II. Local officials say the signs never
existed, or if they did, they were someone's poor idea of a joke.
   Navy men, however, have been denied service in bars or made to
pay exorbitant cover charges. In every case, when the practice
became known, it ceased.
   ``It's a love-hate relationship, especially with the younger
military men. There are a lot of kids in town and they do what all
kids do ... and sometimes they get into trouble,'' said Pindur.
``It's a pain sometimes to have all these kids running loose, but,
at the same time, there is an appreciation for what they do. There
job is to protect us.''
   Smith said some of the friction is based on class differences.
   ``Let's face it, the majority of these Navy kids are from
lower-or working-class families,'' he said. ``For them, the Navy
was a way out.''
   But the tension disappears in times of triumph or tragedy.
   ``We are a Navy community,'' Pindur said. ``There is a deep
empathy for things that happen to Navy folks.''
   The Rev. David Lassalle, who delivered a short homily Friday at
a service organized by the city in tribute to the dead, gestured
toward the workmen setting up the podium on the Elizabeth River
waterfront, the police honor guard officers rehearsing their
entrance and the people quietly gathering.
   ``Words don't always say enough, but the actions of today ...
perhaps they say even if we didn't know their faces or their names,
those men were ours,'' he said.

   Richard M. Daley's march to City Hall by
defeating two blacks has left the black vote in disarray and has
many wondering whether Daley's inauguration Monday will be his
first and only or the first of many.
   Daley, son of the last of the big-city bosses, ended blacks'
six-year grip on the mayoralty by soundly beating acting Mayor
Eugene Sawyer in February's Democratic primary and by doing the
same to Alderman Timothy Evans six weeks later.
   Daley will complete the last two years of the second term of the
city's first black mayor, Harold Washington, who died in 1987.
   Daley's father, Richard J. Daley, won six consecutive terms.
Whether the younger Daley is in for the long term may depend less
on his own actions than on whether black voters can regroup after
splintering between Sawyer and Evans.
   ``We knew what the stakes were this time around and we let it
get away from us once. ... So I'm taking a dismal view of things
for the future,'' said Lu Palmer, an influential black radio
commentator and political activist,
   ``I don't see any possibility of winning the mayor's office back
by 1991, and let's face it, if Daley gets a foothold then,'' he
said, ``the office is probably his until the year
2000-and-something.''
   Most election post-mortems have centered on the low black
turnout that crippled both Sawyer and Evans, despite the efforts of
former Democratic presidential candidate Jesse Jackson on behalf of
both.
   The ensuing debate among blacks has centered on whether they
should spend their time on the sidelines developing a black
independent party, as Palmer suggests, or try to rebuild the
multiracial coalition that lifted Washington to power in 1983 and
made him the first mayor since the elder Daley to be re-elected.
   ``The reason Harold won _ and make no mistake about it _ is
because he was able to graft liberal whites and Hispanics onto that
huge bloc,'' said Clarence Page, a black who is a member of the
Chicago Tribune's editorial board.
   ``It doesn't have to be tomorrow, but blacks should begin the
process of looking for a candidate to do that. ... To suggest they
sit on the sidelines and wait until the numbers grow enough to go
it alone ... is just short-sighted.''
   The city has roughly equal numbers of blacks and whites, but
whites make up about 49 percent of the electorate, compared with
about 43 percent for blacks.
   Don Rose, a veteran political strategist who held top posts in
the Washington and Evans campaigns, said Daley won ``because a lot
of white liberals and people who joined Washington's reform
movement were willing to give him a chance and because a lot of
blacks didn't feel a sufficient amount of outrage and didn't vote.''
   ``What Daley has to do now is make good on his campaign promises
to be inclusive, racially and ethnically, in terms of appointments
and contracts and promote reform-minded legislation,'' Rose said.
``If he doesn't, the movement had better be ready.''

   Two military space shuttle flights
planned next summer will be delayed, one for at least three months,
because work on the shuttle Columbia is taking longer than expected.
   NASA said Friday the schedule had become too tight to support
both missions and still preserve an October launch for the
high-priority Galileo flight to Jupiter.
   A Discovery launch that had been scheduled for Aug. 10 will be
delayed until at least November. Columbia, which had a July 1
launch target, will be launched in early August, the space agency
said.
   Both missions are to deploy classified Defense Department
payloads.
   Unaffected will be Friday's planned liftoff of Atlantis with the
Magellan-Venus spacecraft on board, the first planet-bound payload
scheduled for release from a space shuttle.
   The schedule changes will have a ripple effect on launch dates
later in the year, leaving NASA with six instead of its goal of
seven shuttle launches this year.
   Officials have said the planned Oct. 12 liftoff of Atlantis with
the Jupiter-orbiting Galileo spacecraft is a high-priority flight
because there is only a 40-day launch period during which Jupiter
and Earth are aligned properly. So it will be next in line after
Columbia's August mission.
   Then will come the delayed Discovery military flight, probably
in November, and a flight, probably in December, in which
Columbia's crew is to deploy a communications satellite and
retrieve a science satellite which has been orbiting since 1984.
   The mission of Discovery with the Hubble Space Telescope, long
awaited by astronomers, will slip from its present December launch
slot into 1990.
   NASA said dates for missions after the Galileo flight will be
determined later.
   ``NASA management has become increasingly concerned that the
work involved in preparing the orbiter Columbia for its first
flight in over three years is taking long enough that it might
endanger the option to launch Galileo at the opening of the launch
window,'' said shuttle chief Richard H. Truly. ``Our overriding
objectives in this situation are to protect the Galileo window and
to fly Columbia as early as we can.''
   Following the Challenger explosion in January 1986, the shuttle
fleet was grounded for 32 months while the three remaining orbiters
underwent major modifications to improve safety and performance.
   The modified Discovery has made two flights since the accident
and Atlantis is about to make its second.
   Besides the Challenger-dictated changes, Columbia, the first
shuttle and a veteran of seven space trips, also had to undergo
extensive alterations to its thermal protection tile system and is
the last one to be returned to flight status.
   The Columbia work is taking longer than planned because of a
shortage of skilled engineers and technicians to process three
shuttles simultaneously.

<DATELINE>BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The day Lebanon's civil war began its
15th year, 69 people were killed or wounded. Most were civilians.
   The casualties were caused by an estimated 25,000 shells and
rockets fired by Christian and Moslem forces that day, April 13.
The figures indicate it took 362 shells and rockets to inflict one
casualty.
   That's about average in the daily battles between mainly
Christian units of Lebanon's army, long fractured along sectarian
lines, and an alliance of Syrian forces and Moslem Druse militiamen.
   It costs the Syrian Army about $120,000 every time it fires a
broadside from one of its 40-barrel 240mm rocket launchers into
Christian east Beirut.
   It costs Gen. Michael Aoun's Christian army units about the same
to lob a similar number of 155mm howitzer shells into Moslem zones.
   But there is no shortage of guns or ammunition among Lebanon's
warring factions, who are well supplied by regional powers who use
Lebanon to fight their rivals by proxy.
   Leftist and Moslem militias are armed and bankrolled by Syria,
Libya and Iran. Their Christian rivals get their U.S.-made weapons
from Iraq and Israel.
   It's a strange war. There are no ground assaults. No one gains
territory or loses it. Both sides, deeply entrenched, just hammer
each other, usually with long-range weapons.
   The current round of fighting, the worst in four years, started
March 8. Since then, by police count, more than 270 people have
been killed and nearly 1,000 wounded.
   Despite the intensity of the shelling, with 50 shells and
rockets a minute falling in the worst barrages, the casualty toll
is surprisingly low.
   The reason is that after 14 years of civil war and factional
bloodletting, the Lebanese have developed a sixth sense about when
trouble is near. They know to head for underground bunkers and
basements.
   For those who haven't developed that sense, the signal to take
cover is the theme song from the movie ``Shaft'' on the radio. The
Isaac Hayes tune always precedes flashes on where shells are
falling.
   Beirutis know that when their side starts firing, a retaliatory
barrage is inevitable.
   When the big fuel depot on the Christian side was hit a few days
ago, sending up a huge fireball and destroying virtually all
Lebanon's fuel supplies, the radio advised everyone living near the
blazing facility to get away in case other fuel tanks blew.
   A distraught Christian mother of three told how she rushed out
of her apartment with her family amid the thud of exploding shells
nearby.
   It was only when she reached her brother's house in the
neighboring Hazmieh district that she realized she'd left her son
with a neighbor.
   Three hours later, the 10-year-old boy showed up. He had walked
three miles under heavy shelling without a scratch.
   ``Those were the worst hours of my life,'' said the young woman.
She did not want to be identified, ``because my husband works
abroad and I don't want him to hear about this.''
   But despite their well-honed survival instincts, people are
sometimes caught off guard.
   A young Moslem named Jamal was killed by shrapnel as he drove
his family from his home in the south Beirut district of Ouzai to
west Beirut to be with his elderly mother during a lull a few days
ago, his neighbors said.
   A 25-year-old Druse student, just back from West Germany where
he majored in computer science, was killed when he visited a
militia base manned by fighters of Druse warlord Walid Jumblatt's
Progressive Socialist Party.
   ``We'd asked him to teach us how to use communications
equipment,'' a fighter said. ``A shell landed close to where we
were standing and he was killed.''
   The bunkers have become second homes for many families. For many
Beirutis, life underground is austere and cramped. Power plants
have been hit or shut down because fuel has run out.
   Fires rage out of control because the water pumping system
doesn't work, because there's no power.
   Several families are often crammed into reinforced basements for
days on end, eating from stockpiles of canned food and water,
sleeping as best they can by the light of kerosene lamps or candles.
   For the well-off, bunker life can be almost comfortable.
   Fourteen Christian families living in the Adonis district of
east Beirut have constructed a luxury two-story bunker under their
apartment block.
   One of them, furniture store owner Hanna Breidi, has fitted it
with wall-to-wall carpets, 10 double beds, armchairs, refrigerators
and a small gambling salon.
   They also have two color television sets with video recorders,
and radio telephones, which operate independently of their
generator. There are video games for the children.
   The fridge is stocked with smoked salmon, hams, imported
cheeses, steaks and wine.
   The families' maids, mostly Sri Lankans and Filipinas, live on
the first floor below ground level.

   Congress may be asked to bail out numerous
corporations that will be forced into bankruptcy in the next
recession because of excessive debt, the chairman of the Senate
Finance Committee said Saturday.
   Lloyd Bentsen, D-Texas, said a study that shows a spectacular
increase in the amount of high-risk ``junk bond'' debt since 1980
makes him worry about the possibility of a taxpayer bailout similar
to the multibillion dollar rescue of the nation's troubled savings
and loans.
   Bentsen said the Library of Congress study ``tells us that the
amount of corporate debt is going through the roof and that the
quality of corporate debt is going through the floor.''
   In 1980, one out of 25 bonds was below investment grade; today
it is one out of five, Bentsen said. Corporate debt has tripled
since 1980.
   ``When we see another recession _ and ultimately we will _
you're going to see that recession deeper and longer because of
this great increase in debt and some of these highly leveraged
corporations,'' said Bentsen.
   ``And then you'll see so many of them going bankrupt that you'll
begin to hear cries for having the taxpayers going in and bailing
them out like we had to do on the savings and loan industry and
that gives me very deep concern,'' Bentsen said.
   The study said more than $30 billion in junk bonds was issued in
the last three years, accounting for more than 20 percent of
outstanding corporate debt.
   Bentsen said his committee would be examining a way of limiting
the attractiveness of corporate debt.

<DATELINE>VATICAN CITY (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Pope John Paul II met Saturday with two
senior churchmen from Cuba, whose Communist government is
reportedly preparing to extend an official invitation for a
first-ever papal visit.
   The Vatican said the pope met for 20 minutes with Archbishop
Jaime Lucas Ortega y Alamino of Havana, president of the Cuban
bishops' conference, and Bishop Mariano Vivanco Valiente of
Matanzas.
   It was listed as a private audience, and no details were
released.
   Vatican officials said last week that an envoy of Cuban
President Fidel Castro was expected at the Vatican soon.
   The Miami Herald, citing religious sources in Cuba, reported
that Jose Felipe Carneado, director of the Cuban Communist Party's
Office of Religious Affairs, would travel to Rome with a formal
invitation for the pope to visit Cuba.
   Cardinal Roger Etchegaray, a top Vatican official who visited
Cuba in late December, reported ``inequivocal signs'' of
improvement in church-state relations there and said he discussed
the possibility of a papal visit.
   The Miami Herarld said its sources suggested the papal visit
would be scheduled sometime in 1990 or 1991.
   Cuba has been officially atheist since the Communist revolution
30 years ago, but the Holy See and the Vatican have maintained
diplomatic relations.
   Last month, the pope applauded improvements in the church's
ability to carry out its mission in Cuba but made no mention of a
possible visit.
   In January, Castro said the pope is welcome in Cuba and is
appreciated by the entire population ``as a high-profile and
influential international leader.''

   Six soldiers died Saturday when the
stolen vehicle they were in swerved off a road and plunged into a
river, police said.
   The accident took place before dawn in the town of Puente Duero,
a few miles outside the north-central city of Valladolid. The
driver apparently lost control of the Land-Rover as he approached a
bridge, police said.
   The victims, between the ages of 18 and 21, had been completing
obligatory military service at the army's center for artillery
ammunition and maintenance in Valladolid, a center spokesman said.
   Valladolid municipal police said the Land-Rover had been
reported stolen Friday.

   Communist rebels claimed
responsibility Saturday for killing a U.S. Army colonel who advised
this country's military, and officials fearing more attacks
bolstered security for U.S. forces.
   Philippine troops near the six U.S. military installations in
the country were reinforced and put on maximum alert immediately
after Col. James ``Nick'' Rowe was slain Friday, according to Gen.
Renato de Villa, the Philippine army's chief of staff. Rowe's
Filipino driver was wounded.
   Communist assassins in a stolen car sprayed Rowe's vehicle with
bullets while he was on his way to work in suburban Quezon City.
The killers escaped.
   The 51-year-old Rowe, who was a prisoner of war in Vietnam,
served as chief of the ground forces division of the Joint
U.S.-Military Advisory Group, which provides training and
logistical support to the Philippine military.
   Rowe, a native of McAllen, Texas, was a decorated Vietnam War
veteran who was held in a cage for five years by the Viet Cong
until he escaped in 1968. He wrote a book about the ordeal titled,
``Five Years to Freedom.''
   The communist New People's Army General Command claimed
responsibility for his assassination in a statement delivered
Saturday to news agencies.
   The statement threatened further attacks if the United States
continues to back President Corazon Aquino's fight against the
20-year Communist insurgency.
   ``The death of Col. Rowe signifies the firm commitment of the
revolutionary forces to continue military actions against U.S.
personnel and installations, as these are manifestations of the
arrogant trampling of U.S. imperialists on the Filipino people's
independence and sovereignty,'' the statement said.
   The U.S. Navy ordered additional security for the 1,000 sailors
on the flagship USS Blue Ridge of the 7th Fleet. The ship arrived
Friday for a four-day Manila port call.
   Lt. Mike Andrews, the fleet's spokesman, said the sailors were
told to travel in groups and avoid dark alleys.
   Filipino soldiers used bomb-sniffing dogs Saturday to check
luggage at Manila airport, fearing terrorists might try to plant
bombs on departing planes.
   U.S. Ambassador Nicholas Platt called the killing a ``cowardly''
act, and presidential spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said U.S.
authorities would help the government search for the killers.
   No date had been set for memorial services or for flying Rowe's
body back to the United States.
   His killing came five days after the rebels announced they were
``determined to make U.S. imperialism pay dearly for the continuing
stay of its bases and its escalating intervention in our people's
affairs.''
   That statement was issued to claim reponsibility for the bombing
of a U.S. communications station in the northern province of
Benguet on April 9. No one was hurt.
   In October 1987, rebels killed three Americans and a Filipino
outside Clark Air Base, 50 miles north of Manila. Authorities later
increased security at U.S. bases and civilian offices in the
Philippines.
   De Villa said additional precautions were now needed because
Rowe's killing created ``a new problem for us, because this was
terrorism against foreign nationals.''
   The six U.S. installations, which include Clark and Subic Bay
naval station, are occupied by about 40,000 soldiers, civilian
workers, and dependents. About 100,000 other Americans live in the
country.
   Resentment toward U.S. forces has spread beyond the rebel army
in recent years. The agreement allowing the U.S. bases to remain
was extended last year to 1991 over heavy opposition from
protesters and some lawmakers.

   Olympic Airways' flight and ground
attendants defied a court order and grounded the national carrier
Saturday with a 24-hour strike.
   A spokesman for the airline said all flights were canceled and
that normal schedules would be resumed Sunday.
   Olympic's pilots and flight engineers did not join the walkout
but were unable to fly without attendants, said the spokesman, who
requested anonymity.
   The attendants are seeking overtime and additional pay for night
flights.
   The strikers ignored a court order obtained by the airline
Friday that forbade the walkout and threatened to fine and possibly
jail participants.
   If the strikers' demands are not met, the airline spokesman
said, the union has threatened to start a five-day walkout Monday.
This week is Easter holy week for Greek Orthodox Christians, who
celebrate Easter Sunday on April 30, and many if not all the
airline's flights have long been sold out.

<TEXT>
   For those to whom a heavy diet of Wagner's
``Ring Cycle'' is poison, the Metropolitan Opera has an antidote
that's easy to swallow _ an ``Elixir of Love'' with superstars
Luciano Pavarotti and Kathleen Battle.
   Donizetti's comic masterpiece _ which he dashed off in an
amazing two weeks _ made its first appearance of the season Friday
night to a standing-room-only crowd.
   It will be performed four more times during the final two weeks
of the season, while most of the Met's attention is devoted to its
new staging of Wagner's four-part ``Der Ring Des Nibelungen.''
   Luckily, this fading but still charming 1960 production by
Nathaniel Merrill and Robert O'Hearn practically runs by itself,
like a windup clock. And with music so effervescent and a plot so
foolproof, the audience is guaranteed a good time, even if the
performance never quite sparkles as it should.
   Pavarotti started his career singing light tenor roles like
Nemorino, the bumbling country bumpkin who tries to win the heart
of his true love by drinking a magic potion. He's gone on to tackle
heavier parts _ and lost some of his luster in the process _ but
this role remains a favorite.
   Though he's always an agreeable performer, Pavarotti was not in
top vocal form Friday night, straining for notes when he should
have been caressing them. His big second-act aria, ``Una furtiva
lagrima,'' drew the usual feverish ovation from his fans, but in
truth it was only moderately soothing to the ear.
   Miss Battle, as the heroine Adina, took a while to warm up, at
first sounding oddly detached as she has in other recent
assignments at the Met. But after the intermission, she became more
animated and produced a rich, full tone along with her famous
silvery high notes.
   It was good to hear Doctor Dulcamara, the traveling quack who
arrives in a balloon, sung with the firm, booming voice that bass
Paul Plishka displayed. Often the part is given to an aging singer
who must rely on comic business to cover up an inability to get all
the notes across.
   Less effective was Leo Nucci as Sergeant Belcore, Nemorino's
rival for the love of Adina. His modest baritone just couldn't hold
its own in such high-powered vocal company.
   Marcello Panni, who conducted Pavarotti and Miss Battle in the
same opera in Central Park last summer, was making his house debut
and didn't quite have his act together. The orchestra sounded
ragged at times, and the singers, especially Pavarotti, tended to
go their own way where tempos were concerned.

<HEAD>Soviet Military Aircraft to Carry Civilian Cargoes</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Dozens of military aircraft will be diverted to
civilian duty to haul 50,000 tons of farm produce, construction
equipment, and other goods around the country this year, an
official report said.
   The report Friday by the Tass news agency gave no reason for the
move. However, it said the military planes would be transporting
southern fruit and vegetables to northern cities, including Moscow
and Leningrad. Those cities suffer chronic shortages of such goods.
   
   Military aircraft have occasionally been used for civilian duty
in the past. They helped deliver equipment and relief workers after
the 1986 Chernobyl nuclear accident and the Armenian earthquake in
December, Tass said.
   A new resolution ordering the aircraft to carry civilian cargoes
was adopted by the Council of Ministers, the news agency said.
   Tass said the 60 military transport planes in the program will
include the Ruslan and Antheus jumbo jets, Il-76 turbojets and
An-12 turboprops. It did not say when the program would begin or
how long it would last.
   It said the jumbo jets ``are capable of bringing practically to
any point in the country large structural elements, building and
earth-moving machinery, cranes, excavators and transport vehicles.''
   Col. Gen. Vyacheslav Yefanov, chief of the military transport
division, was quoted by Tass as saying combat readiness will not be
impaired.
   ``Crews will continue to upgrade their flying skills, improve
maintenance of aircraft and will master radio communications,''
Yefanov said.

   The middle-aged white woman in the David
Duke sweatshirt was pleasantly enthusiastic.
   ``He's for fair play for all,'' she said of the ex-Ku Klux Klan
leader she had come to hear. ``Right now it's like we've become the
minority and we need someone to do something.''
   Duke, who has made the jump from radical fringe to elected
official, points to such people as proof his message is becoming
mainstream. Now leader of the National Association for the
Advancement of White People, Duke won a seat in the Louisiana
Legislature by talking about the high birthrate among unwed welfare
women and claiming that whites are victimized by civil rights laws.
   ``I think I spoke out loud what a lot of people say around the
dinner table,'' he said. ``People were so impressed by the ideas
that they voted for me despite the controversy of my background.''
   Duke is not alone in his thinking. Much of what he says is
echoed by those who have opposed him throughout his career.
   ``The David Duke election was a signal of a sour mood of
resentment on the part of some whites that has been a long time in
developing,'' said Irwin Suall, director of fact-finding for the
Anti-Defamation League of B'nai B'rith. ``There is a perception out
there that blacks are being favored at the expense of whites, not
merely in employment but in status in the media.''
   Some dismiss Duke's slim, 200-vote victory as an anomaly; his
suburban New Orleans district is 99 percent white. But Suall and
other trackers of racial tension believe disparate events, like
Duke's election and the rise of the racist skinhead subculture, are
warning signs to be taken seriously.
   ``These people and these events represent something larger,''
said Chip Berlet, a researcher for Political Research Associates of
Cambridge, Mass. ``They are like the canaries in mines telling us
there is an undercurrent of people that are very unhappy.''
   This unhappiness, says Berlet and others, runs long and deep. It
is the result of economic changes that have nibbled away at the
blue-collar union tradition; of fear of drugs and crime; of the
perception that civil rights programs like affirmative action are
unfair to whites, and of a general hopelessness within the white
working class that sees a shrinking of its power in society.
   At a shopping mall on the edge of Duke's district, a white woman
in her 30s offered her opinion but declined to give her name:
   ``You see all this about black power and black pride and helping
blacks economically and I guess that started out with good
intentions. But it's not right when whites lose jobs and it's not
fair when you're called a racist for complaining about it.''
   It is difficult to measure this mood. Most polls show the
American public far more tolerant of racial differences and
integration programs than it once was. But Michael McKeon, a
pollster who has worked with the Democratic Congressional Campaign
Committee, said standard surveys that ask yes-no questions can't
plumb the depth of individual attitudes.
   McKeon said his phone surveys, which involve more dialogue with
subjects, show ``big time disenchantment.''
   ``It's nothing you can put a number on, but there is a
resentment out there that the lower middle class, and their
children, aren't going to be any better off than they were,'' he
said. ``If you ask, `Are you mad because your kid didn't get a
scholarship and a black kid did?' they're going to say no. But if
you talk to them you're going to see this resentment woven into the
fabric of their thoughts.''
   Those in the civil rights trenches, like Curt Koehler, an
organizer for the Chicago Commission on Human Relations, note a
simmering anger, especially among young whites.
   ``A growing number of white people in their 20s feel they are on
the short end of the stick,'' said Koehler, who tries to defuse
racial tension in the blue-collar neighborhoods on Chicago's
Southwest side, an area that has seen Klan rallies and violence by
skinheads.
   Koehler said the lower middle-class white bastion of the secure
union job is crumbling. At the same time, the disenchanted see a
growing black middle class moving in and believe it is the result
of favored government treatment.
   ``A black on his way up might have a chance to buy a home in a
neighborhood where a young white kid just saw his job leave,'' he
said. ``The anger is being placed now on black folks and
affirmative action.''
   Beyond the economics is an issue of group identity and pride.
The higher profile of minorities on stage, film and the television
screen gives some whites, already worried about their status, the
sense that their importance in society is diminishing.
   Berlet noted that while relatively few blacks appear on TV,
their numbers have increased so rapidly that their representation
can seem disproportional. ``Blacks make up 15 percent of the
population and maybe only 4 percent on TV,'' he said. ``But when
some whites see ... more black faces on televison, they think
they're taking over.''
   Gregg, a 20-year-old Atlanta skinhead who declined to give his
last name, complained bitterly about what he sees as ``black
propaganda.''
   ``I was watching television and they had these blacks sitting
around, telling everybody it was blacks who invented this and
blacks who invented that. It was abunch of lies,'' he said.
   Bert, a fellow skinhead, sees such concepts as black pride and
black history coming at the expense of white identity.
   ``White heritage is not being taught in school. It's like you're
supposed to be ashamed of being white while they're teaching black
heritage full force,'' he said. ``They completely downplay the role
whites have in this country.''
   These frustrations can blossom into acts of racial violence that
Koehler has seen in his Chicago neighborhoods. ``Or,'' he said,
``these people can vote for a David Duke in the belief they can
protect what is mine.''
   Whether or not that translates into the election of more
candidates with similar ideologies is debated by the pulsetakers of
society.
   Martin Lipset, a Stanford University sociologist, thinks other
white rights candidates may be elected to local office, ``but
they're dead if they have any ambitions to go further.''
   Duke, however, believes he is only the first to tap into a
sentiment that will grow.
   ``I think that this is the beginning of a time when we will see
candidates discuss these things,'' he said. ``A candidate who
doesn't have to carry the political baggage I had to carry and who
discusses these issues will win.''

   Syrian forces fired rockets at the port
of Jounieh Saturday as thousands of fleeing Christians waited for
ships to carry them to safety, police said.
   No casualties were reported as the 122mm Soviet-designed Grad
rockets exploded around Jounieh, the Christians' only escape route
from their beleaguered enclave.
   Other rockets hit the area around the coastal highway running
north to the ancient port of Byblos.
   Christian sources reported that one unidentified ship slipped
into the port.
   Several other small freighters with unknown cargoes have reached
the Christian zone in recent days. Iraq, Syria's main Arab rival,
has been supplying weapons and ammunition to the Christians.
   Saturday's salvos came during a relative lull in the battles
between the Syrians, aided by Moslem Druse allies, and the mainly
Christian units of army commander Gen. Michel Aoun.
   By police count, 270 people have been killed and nearly 1,000
wounded in ferocious artillery and rocket exchanges that began
March 8.
   Police reported that an estimated 4,000 Christians had gathered
at Jounieh, 12 miles north of Beirut, awaiting a ferry from Cyprus
to take them to safety.
   The 4,000-ton Baroness M, one of two ferries that have carried
12,000 Christians to Cyprus during the fighting, anchored off
Jounieh on Friday night.
   The ship took on an estimated 1,200 people who were shuttled out
from Jounieh in small boats without incident.
   Cypriot shipping officials said the Baroness M would make the
trip to Jounieh again Sunday.
   Beirut's Moslem Voice of the Nation termed the Syrian rocketing
a ``warning to ships to stay away from the besieged enclave.''
   ``It will persist as long as the blockade imposed by Aoun
perists,'' it said.
   The current spasm of fighting was triggered after Aoun, seeking
to restore state authority to the fractured government, blockaded
illegal ports run by Moslem militias.
   The 310-square-mile Christian enclave is ringed on its three
landward sides by hostile forces, and about 1 million Christians
are trapped inside.
   Despite the shelling of Jounieh, no major exchanges between the
Moslem and Christian regions have been reported for three days. But
few believed the lull would last.
   The Ad-Diyar daily quoted Justice Minister Nabih Berri, leader
of the Syrian-backed Shiite Moslem Amal militia, as warning: ``The
lull will not last ... as long as we don't have a political
settlement.''
   The television station run by the Lebanese Forces, the
Christians' main militia, advised Christians trapped in the enclave
how to aid casualties in the event of new shelling.
   ``Keep your nerves under control,'' it said. ``Parks cars in
such a way that they don't block ambulances. Take cover in the
nearest bomb shelter, underground bunker or building entrance.''

   A Soviet deputy foreign minister arrived in
Beijing on Saturday for talks aimed at overcoming problems facing
the first Soviet-Chinese summit in 30 years, sources said.
   Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev is scheduled to come to
China on May 15.
   The two sides have had difficulty agreeing on a joint communique
to be issued at the visit's end, said an Eastern European source,
speaking on condition of anonymity.
   It is hoped the visit by Deputy Foreign Minister Igor Rogachev
of the Soviet Union will clear up these difficulties, specifically
the Soviet and Chinese position on Vietnam and the war in Cambodia.
   Other difficulties concern the vision that each nation has of
future Sino-Soviet ties. Beijing has played down the significance
of its growing ties with Moscow, while the Soviets like to portray
their improving rapport with the Chinese as a foreign relations
coup.
   One indication of this occurred when the date of Gorbachev's
visit was announced in February. Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard
Shevardnadze ended a visit to China on Feb. 3 by announcing the
date. At a press conference that same day, a Chinese official
denied a date had been set.
   China then waited two days to announce that the date was May 15.
   Rogachev arrived Saturday afternoon, a Chinese source said. His
visit had been planned for some time but postponed for unknown
reasons.
   Both China and the Soviet Union support a Vietnamese troop
pullout from Cambodia by September. They also support an end to
Chinese aid for Cambodia's anti-Vietnamese guerrillas.
   Vietnam invaded Cambodia in late 1978 to replace the pro-Chinese
Khmer Rouge with a pro-Vietnamese puppet government.
   China and the Soviet Union apparently still differ on the
composition of a transitional government, which would rule until
elections to replace the current Vietnamese-installed government.
   The last Soviet leader to visit Beijing was Nikita Khrushchev in
1959.

<HEAD>Observers Say Trump Is Winning at Monopoly In Atlantic City</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Donald Trump is playing a real-life
game of Monopoly with Atlantic City real estate these days.
   In less than a month, the developer has announced two property
deals that would put him in command of a lucrative five-block area
in the center of the Boardwalk.
   New Jersey regulatory authorities say they will look closely at
the implications of the deal in deciding whether to approve it.
   The financial genius of the deal is that the two acquisitions
would be taken off the rolls as casinos and converted into luxury
hotels to comply with state law, thus enhancing the market share
for the gambling spots Trump already owns.
   New Jersey law has a three-casino limit per owner. Trump already
owns Trump Plaza, Trump Castle and the soon-to-be-opened Taj Mahal.
   Converting Elsinore's Atlantis Casino Hotel and the former
Penthouse casino site into hotels would benefit the gaming hall in
the middle, Trump Plaza, said Marvin B. Roffman, an analyst with
the investment firm Janney Montgomery Scott Inc.
   ``When you take a casino site off the market, the people sharing
the pie will share bigger pieces,'' he said. ``Donald Trump took
the most important five blocks in Atlantic City _ where Caesars
begins and Atlantis ends. Four properties were going to share that
space and now there's only going to be two.''
   Trump's Atlantis purchase is subject to regulatory approval. The
financially ailing casino is controlled by a state-appointed
conservator.
   ``There's a good deal of concern over anyone who amasses too
much of the real estate among the casino-zoned properties,'' said
Anthony Parrillo, director of the state Division of Gaming
Enforcement. ``The public policy of this state is to foster
competition in the Atlantic City marketplace, and the public policy
is against undue economic concentration.
   ``The question it boils down to is with all the incremental
holdings of Mr. Trump _ or anyone, for that matter _ when is enough
enough?'' Parrillo said. ``That's a very difficult issue to assess
because the Legislature didn't give a precise formula other than
the three-license rule.''
   At the same time, regulators must consider the prerogative of an
entrepreneur to enter into such agreements, as well as the best use
for the property and what the local market is able to handle, he
said.
   The Casino Control Act, Parrillo said, ``wants a healthy mix of
competitors _ diversified and multi-dimensional.''
   Martin Danzinger, a former member of the Casino Control
Commission, said the issue is whether Trump has become powerful
enough ``to become a government of his own.''
   ``Among casino employees, he will control 20 percent of the
industry,'' Danziger said. ``If for some reason the state had to
close him up, what impact would that have on the industry? And how
much impact would it have if he decides to walk away from the
gaming tables? The state should be debating those questions _ and
they probably are.''
   Roffman said Trump's purchase of the Atlantis for ``a bargain
price'' of $63 million; Trump bought the former Penthouse site for
$56 million.
   If both deals are completed, ``Trump will control almost a mile
of Boardwalk frontage,'' Roffman said. ``That's very powerful.''

   A former government leader who died of
poisoning after resigning in the midst of a corruption scandal will
be buried at a national shrine for revolutionary heroes, officials
said Saturday.
   Maurice Nyagumbo, who was the government's senior minister for
political affairs, will be entombed Sunday at Heroes' Acre on the
outskirts of Harare, a government spokesman said.
   Nyagumbo, 64, died at Harare's main hospital on Thursday from
poisoning. No details were available, but police sources said they
were investigating whether he committed suicide.
   He was a founder of the party of socialist President Robert
Mugabe, which controls the government as the country's only legal
party. Nyagumbo ranked third in its hierarchy.
   Nyagumbo, the longest serving political detainee in the former
colony of Rhodesia, spent 21 years in jail for opposition to white
rule. After Rhodesia became the independent nation of Zimbabwe in
1980, Nyagumbo held key posts in the Cabinet, the 15-member
Politburo and the ruling party's Central Committee.
   But he resigned his government and party posts April 14 after he
was found by a presidential inquiry to be involved in a racket
involving illegal sales of vehicles. Investigators found he abused
his position by acquiring 38 vehicles, mostly for friends, from a
state assembly plant.
   Nyagumbo denied wrongdoing but stepped down.
   Despite the scandal, the government spokesman, who commented on
condition of anonymity, said Mugabe declared Nyagumbo a national
hero.
   ``His death has robbed us of a man whose record of revolutionary
performance is second to none,'' the president said Friday.
   Nyagumbo's body was to lie in state until burial.
   The revolutionary shrine honors about 27,000 Zimbabweans who
died in the seven-year guerrilla war that led to independence.

<HEAD>Most Hard Cases Gone From California's Most Notorious Prison</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN HOWARD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SAN QUENTIN, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   San Quentin Prison, for more than a
century one of the toughest places in the nation to do time, has
been emptied of virtually all its most hardened criminals.
   Some 1,750 of them, more than half the population of the
137-year-old fortress that once held Charles Manson and Sirhan
Sirhan, have been sent to new prisons throughout California as part
of a $5 billion prison expansion.
   In their place are minimum- and medium-security prisoners,
including many who live in trailers outside the prison walls on San
Quentin's fenced-in grounds and have little contact with the
higher-risk inmates inside.
   California's Death Row remains here for the 252 prisoners, all
men, facing execution by cyanide gas. But aside from them, ``we
have lost almost all of our hard-core (inmates),'' said prison
spokesman Cal White, not unhappily.
   ``That once housed the most desperate people in California,'' he
said, pointing to an empty five-tier cellblock. ``Now, it's just a
temporary holding facility.''
   The concrete-and-steel compound ringed by guard towers on the
edge of San Francisco Bay has long been depicted as one of
America's toughest prisons.
   Its inmates included Sirhan, who assassinated Robert F. Kennedy
in 1968, and Caryl Chessman, convicted of Los Angeles' ``red light
bandit'' sex attacks of 1948. He became a best-selling author
behind bars before being executed in 1960.
   But in the past two years, most of the highest-risk prisoners
have been sent to three new prisons. Manson, the leader of a
murderous cult and perhaps the most notorious prisoner in
California, went to the new Corcoran prison near Fresno.
   Corcoran is one of eight prisons opened in California since
1980. The state's prison population has tripled since then to more
than 75,000, more than any other state. None of the older prisons
has been affected more than San Quentin.
   On the outside, the complex appears as forbidding as ever.
Several buildings were erected in the middle to late 19th century _
one has the date 1857 chiseled in its front _ and even the more
recent structures are decades old.
   On the inside, what authorities call San Quentin's ``change in
mission'' is quickly apparent. In addition to holding medium- and
minimum-security inmates, it serves as a reception center, where
new inmates are sent for orientation and classification.
   ``The stress level here has dropped considerably over the past
couple of years,'' White said. ``We used to have some kind of
incident every day. It wasn't uncommon to have a `lockup' every
month. Now that's pretty much of a rarity.''
   The prison has been extensively remodeled, including a $28
million overhaul of an old cellblock. In the hospital, 55 years old
but newly refurbished, is the dental ward, a spic-and-span suite
that smells powerfully of disinfectant.
   ``They call me `Dr. Painless,''' said Dr. Glenn Jamieson, a
bouyant, breezy man who has taken care of prisoners' teeth here for
22 years. He calls the ward ``the only air-conditioned place in the
prison ... as good as any on the outside.''
   Despite the changes, a visitor never forgets that San Quentin is
steeped in violence.
   Before visitors go through the massive steel gates, a guard
warns of the possibility of being taken hostage and adds that state
policy ``is to never negotiate a prisoner's freedom for the release
of hostages.''
   The officer adds with a grin, ``Welcome to San Quentin!''

   The Irish Republican Army on
Saturday claimed responsibility for killing a 26-year-old taxi
driver in North Belfast.
   Police said two women in the cab were not injured.
   William Thompson of Belfast was believed to have been slowing
down to drop off his passengers Friday night when he was overtaken
by another taxi and a masked man inside fired at him, police said.
   In a statement delivered to news media, the IRA said it had

   It was the 25th death this year in sectarian violence in
Northern Ireland, where the IRA is fighting to end British rule.

believed he was a victim of political persecution.
   Stefan Tivai, 21, whose formal application for political asylum
will be forwarded to the Foreign Ministry, was a member of the
Romanian rowing team participating in an international meet at
nearby Piedliluco lake.
   The athlete went to the foreigners office of the Terni police

<HEAD>FEC Documents: Gramm Fought Agency Over Campaign Violations</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JENNIFER DIXON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Sen. Phil Gramm employed unusual tactics,
including a lawsuit, to fight attempts by federal auditors to
review his 1984 campaign's financial records, government documents
show.
   Gramm, who agreed to end the 5-year dispute with the Federal
Election Commission by paying a $30,000 fine, gave his version of
the events last month in a move that preempted public release of
documents in the case.
   The Texan Republican released the settlement to news
organizations on a Friday night, after the FEC had closed and
before the settlement was final.
   Gramm spokesman Larry Neal said the FEC had made the ``final
offer and it was ours to accept or reject. That was the final
action as far as we were concerned.''
   While acknowledging errors and blaming them on the inexperience
of volunteers, Gramm described them as technical reporting
violations.
   Although many of the instances did involve reporting errors, an
FEC audit also found that the campaign apparently accepted 151
separate contributions from corporations totaling $10,890.
   Corporate contributions to political campaigns are forbidden
under both Texas and federal laws.
   FEC documents in the case also reveal the Friends of Phil Gramm
committee fought the agency's investigation of federal campaign
violations with tactics that included a lawsuit against the
commission in U.S. District Court in Dallas and its members as
individuals.
   The committee also questioned subpoenas issued by the FEC to
obtain key papers.
   In one instance, the campaign committee insisted on a
piece-by-piece inventory of more than 500,000 committee documents
sought by the FEC.
   ``This procedure would have been more expensive and
time-consuming than the audit itself,'' according to a report by
the FEC's general counsel.
   Neal said disputes early in the auditing process were largely
due to ``a bureaucratic procedure that the general counsel's office
attempted to impose.''
   He said the agency at one point sent a letter that simply said:
```Please send half a million documents to Washington immediately.
Thank you.' Obviously, we felt inventories were appropriate and
necessary and challenged them on points such as that.
   ``In essence, we felt that some of the bureaucrats the FEC
dispatched to handle this audit were high-handed and lowdown,''
Neal said.
   FEC spokesman Scott Moxley said it is not often the agency must
go to court in the course of an investigation, ``and it is even
less often that the commission is sued, and especially if the
commissioners are sued in their individual capacity.''
   Moxley said an average FEC investigation lasts eight months,
although some cases have taken longer. ``So something that draws on
for four years is unusual.'' He described the fine as one of the
largest ever in a congressional race.
   Yet in a statement accompanying the release of the settlement,
campaign treasurer Donald R. White said: ``The campaign has made a
consistent and very costly effort over five years to comply fully
with the spirit and substance of the FEC's regulations.''
   White said the crush of 70,000 individual contributions totaling
$10 million ``defeated the efforts of our volunteer campaign
workers to adequately screen and process the incoming mail.''
   The corporate contributions in question slipped through the
``normal screening process undetected because checks drawn on
corporate bank accounts were not readily identifiable as such,''
White said.
   Of the 151 prohibited contributions, 127 appear not to have been
refunded within 30 days, the FEC counsel's report said.
   Auditors said they found one instance in which the campaign
committee ``made a refund of an apparent corporate contribution,
and voided this refund check when the contributor stated he had
intended to write the check from a personal account rather than a
corporate account.''

<HEAD>Official: Elimination Of Nuclear Rockets In Germany Should Not Be
Excluded</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BONN, West Germany (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A high-ranking government official
said Saturday NATO should not exclude the possibility of
eliminating short-range nuclear rockets now based on German soil.
   The remark by Education Minister Juergen Moellemann could
further fuel a simmering disagreement between West Germany and the
United States over short-range nuclear weapons.
   West Germany is expected to press the United States to agree to
early superpower talks on reducing those weapons.
   Both the United States and Britain are strongly opposed to early
talks, contending that Warsaw Pact superiority in conventional
weapons requires a Western nuclear deterrent of short-range
arsenals.
   Chancellor Helmut Kohl also wants the North Atlantic Treaty
Organization to postpone a decision on modernizing those weapons
until 1991 or 1992.
   Speaking at a meeting of the Free Democratic Party in Duisburg,
Moellemann reiterated the West German government's position but
went even farther, saying NATO and the Warsaw Pact should not
exclude the possibility of eliminating short-range nuclear weapons.
   Moellemann is a leading member of the Free Democrats, junior
partners in Kohl's coalition government.
   ``Depending on (disarmament) negotiations results and other
concrete realities, it should be decided after 1992 whether we need
any nuclear, land-based short-range rockets,'' Moellemann said.
   Moellemann also called on NATO to make its own ``wide-ranging''
disarmament initiatives and not to react only when the East bloc
makes disarmament proposals.
   West German Foreign Minister Hans-Dietrich Genscher and Defense
Minister Gerhard Stoltenberg are scheduled to fly to Washington on
Monday for talks with U.S. officials.
   They are expected to press the United States for negotiations
with the Soviets on reducing the number of short-range Lance
weapons, which have a range of about 60 miles and are mostly based
in West Germany.

<HEAD>Jurors Recess For Weekend Without Reaching Verdict</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LEE BYRD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A federal jury weighed the guilt or innocence
of Oliver L. North for part of a second day Saturday, then took the
rest of the weekend off as the former presidential aide awaited his
fate on 12 felony counts stemming from his role in the Iran-Contra
affair.
   The nine women and three men, guided in their deliberations by a
95-page set of instructions from District Judge Gerhard A. Gesell,
arrived bright and early Saturday to resume work in an 18-by-12
room on the sealed second floor of the U.S. Courthouse.
   But there were no clues as to their progress by the time they
quit at 12:10 p.m. to return to their downtown hotel to relax,
under constant supervision of U.S. marshals, until resuming work
Monday.
   The jurors, who were asked by the judge to begin by 9:30 each
morning, were driven in a van to the courthouse at 8:20 a.m. and
started their work at 8:45.
   The jury had deliberated for six hours on Friday.
   So far, only requests for copies of Gesell's instructions _ one
for each juror _ and for pencils, paper, and paper clips have
emanated from the jury room, along with the question Friday, ``Is
lunch at 12?''
   They got the materials, and the early lunch.
   Writing supplies remained a concern Saturday. An unsigned note
which covered the jury's return of some documents to the court for
safekeeping had this ``P.S.: Please sharpen pencils. And we need
more pencils, and highlighters.''
   The jurors will be allowed family visits, under marshals'
supervision, at their hotel on Sunday. The jurors are forbidden to
talk about the case, even among themselves, when they are not in
the jury room.
   North's trial, nearly three months long, is the first stemming
from the late 1985-early 1986 sale of arms to Iran _ at a 270
percent markup in price _ and the siphoning off of some of the
proceeds to the Nicaraguan rebels.
   Three other men, former National Security Adviser John
Poindexter, businessman Albert Hakim, and former Air Force Maj.
Gen. Richard Secord are awaiting separate trials. Another former
national security adviser, Robert C. McFarlane, has pleaded guilty
and received two years' probation and a $20,000 fine for
withholding information from Congress about the episode.
   North, a former Marine lieutenant colonel who served as deputy
to both McFarlane and Poindexter, is charged with 12 felony counts,
including withholding information from Congress, lying to Attorney
General Edwin Meese III about his activities, destroying and
altering documents, misusing money entrusted to him and accepting
an illegal gratuity _ a $13,800 security system at his home.
   North, a decorated Vietnam War veteran, testified he was a mere
``pawn in a chess game played by giants'' and was following orders
throughout, even as he was the action officer in both major
elements of the Iran-Contra scheme. ``I was not stepping in,'' he
said. ``I was brought in ... basically it was a handoff _ `you've
got the ball, now run with it.'''
   But independent prosecutor John W. Keker told the jury ``You
have heard a lot about courage at this trial. There's another kind
of courage: courage, to admit when you are wrong; courage to admit
personal responsibility, courage to admit guilt where appropriate.
He has not admitted any of those things; it's time for you do to it
for him.''
   In his instructions, Gesell set specific guidelines for the
jury's consideration of each specific count.
   For example, on the count that North obstructed Congress by
making false or misleading statements to two House committees,
Gesell said, ``A false or misleading answer to a question may be
taken by you as an obstruction if it was made corruptly, with the
specific intent to impede the investigation ... it must be
established beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant acted for
the specific purposes of obstructing or impeding.''
   Similarly, on four counts that North made false statements to
Congress or Meese, Gesell said the jury could convict only if it is
convinced that ``when the defendant made or caused to be made the
false statement or representation, he was acting willfully, that
is, deliberately or on purpose and not because of mistake,
inadvertence or accident.''
   As for the document destruction charge, the judge said the jury
could convict only if it believes North altered or destroyed the
materials ``with knowledge of the illegality of his conduct.'' But
``the defendant did not have to know the exact terms of the law, if
he knew that he was prohibited, by departmental or agency rule or
regulation, from destroying official records.''
   To convict North for accepting an illegal gratuity _ the
security system _ Gesell said the jury must first be satisfied that
North ``specifically intended to receive the security system for a
past or future official act or acts, and not for reasons wholly
unrelated to his official employment.''
   Most of the charges carry penalties of five years in prison and
$250,000 fines upon conviction. One charge is punishable by a
maximum of 10 years, one of three years and one of two years _ with
the total possible punishment being 60 years and fines of $3
million.

   A jogger raped and bludgeoned by a gang running
wild in Central Park remained in a coma Saturday while eight
teen-agers awaited arraignment on charges of attempted murder.
   The 28-year-old Wall Street investment banker, who was left for

life-support systems, said Metropolitan Hospital administrator
Julio Aguirre.
   The woman's family, which arrived from Pennsylvania, kept a

were critical to her recovery from massive head and brain injuries.
   By early Saturday, police had arrested eight suspects, ages 14
to 17, and charged them as adults with attempted murder, rape and
assault.
   Police said the teen-agers jumped the woman from the bushes and
used a pipe and a rock to batter her unconscious during the attack,
which was the final act of the gang's night of ``wilding'' _ a
street term for random pack violence.
   More than 30 teen-agers went on a two-hour rampage through the
park in which nine people were beaten or terrorized.
   The jogger was found unconscious 3{ hours later and had lost
three-quarters of her blood.
   The suspects were to be arraigned late Saturday or Sunday.

<HEAD>Walesa Expects Solidarity to Shrink</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARY BETH SHERIDAN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>ROME (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Solidarity leader Lech Walesa predicted Saturday
that his newly legalized labor movement will dwindle as it gives
rise to splinter groups during the growing political pluralism in
Poland.
   Speaking at a news conference at the end of a three-day visit to
Italy, he also praised President Bush's proposed aid for Poland and
voiced his support for economic reforms in the Soviet Union.
   ``From Solidarity, other economic and political organizations
will be born,'' said Walesa, a strong proponent of pluralism.
``Solidarity for the moment is huge, but it will become smaller
with the growth of other organizations. This is the logical course
of events.''
   Poland's Communist government last week lifted the ban on
Solidarity and agreed to free elections for a new chamber of
Parliament. Solidarity was crushed in martial law in 1981 and later
outlawed.
   The government is now seeking support from Solidarity and aid
from the West to restore Poland's shattered economy.
   In its heyday, the union claimed 10 million members of the 18
million-member Polish work force.
   Coinciding with the official recognition of Solidarity, the Bush
administration announced a $1 billion economic aid program for
Poland.
   Speaking through an interpreter, Walesa called the program ``a
great step forward taken by Mr. Bush.''
   ``We ask Europe and the world to help Poland travel the road of
development. We have laid the foundations, and if we don't succeed,
the responsibility will also be yours,'' he said.
   The union leader reiterated his support for the liberal reforms
of Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev.
   Asked about Solidarity's contacts with opposition in other East
bloc countries, Walesa said his labor movement was open to ties
with other groups. But he added, ``We don't want to disturb anyone
and above all create obstacles for perestroika.''
   ``Perestroika'' is Gorbachev's program of social and political
reforms.
   Walesa, who won the 1983 Nobel Peace Prize, indicated he planned
to visit other countries as an ``ambassador of Solidarity'' but
gave no details.
   He came to Italy seeking both Western economic investment in
Poland and the blessing of Pope John Paul II, a Pole, for the
country's new political course.
   He also met with Italian political leaders and union officials,
who invited him to make the trip.
   Later Saturday, Walesa flew back to Warsaw. He planned to meet
Sunday with an opposition committee naming candidates for
parliamentary elections in June.

<DATELINE>BUZZARDS BAY, Mass. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   ``Steer course 359,'' the skipper
tells me as I swing the rudder left 10 degrees and wait for the bow
of my 800-foot tanker to move slowly to port.
   Only one problem: It gets to course 359 and the simulated ship
keeps right on going. A wild spin of the wheel in the opposite
direction gives a moment of calm, then the realization I have
overcorrected and the ship is headed in the other direction.
   The glacier-like handling of oil tankers is a problem for pilots
from Boston Harbor to Alaska's Prince William Sound. It is one
reason instructors here at the Massachusetts Maritime Academy scoff
at Coast Guard Commandant Paul Yost's suggestion that a child could
steer a tanker through the Alaskan waters where the Exxon Valdez
ran aground and spilled 10.1 million gallons of oil.
   A recent turn at the helm of an imaginary tanker proved that
reporters, if not children, are wholly unqualified to guide the
floating oil fields to port.
   The year-old, $800,000 simulator here is a full-scale tanker
bridge. An array of computer and video equipment projects a
realistic view of a harbor during the day, at night, at twilight or
in fog.
   In the foreground, hundreds of ``feet'' away, is the prow of my
80,000-ton tanker, nearly as long but much lighter than the Exxon
Valdez. I stand at a virtual duplicate of the type of wheel and
rudder control stand found on most ships.
   In front of me, the shipmaster, academy Professor Jerome
McGourthy, stands by the compass and gives orders while another
professor, Thomas Bushy, serving as a chief mate, looks over my
shoulder.
   ``Driving a ship is like piloting airplanes: hours and hours of
boredom with intermittent moments of terror,'' Bushy says as our
ship moves toward a channel at about 9 knots.
   Later Bushy programs the radar computer to show Prince William
Sound, and I watch as a radar blip identified as the Exxon Valdez
passes me and approximates the course of the 987-foot, 211,000-ton
ship to the reef that made the Valdez infamous.
   Still a mystery in the Valdez disaster is why the ship veered
more than two miles off course and into Bligh Reef. A
miscalculation about the location of the reef might have left the
Valdez with no time to respond. A supertanker travels thousands of
feet before it executes a full turn; an emergency stop can take
miles of water.
   On our radar screen, Bushy brings the Exxon Valdez close to the
reef, marked with a buoy, and then tries to avoid it. ``We gave it
hard right rudder and we're well beyond the buoy and we're probably
aground by now'' because of the reaction time required for a loaded
tanker like the Valdez, Bushy says.
   The four-year academy trains its 550 students on both simulators
and ships and awards bachelor's degrees in marine engineering or
navigation. Graduates typically go to work in the maritime industry
or for the Goast Guard or the military.
   The terror Bushy speaks of seems hard to imagine from the stable
deck of the maritime academy _ until the computer operator switches
the video simulator to night mode and a clear view of my channel
approach becomes a jumble of lights.
   A grouping of seemingly stationary green, red and white lights
means nothing to me, but to my superior officers it represents an
approaching ship. Soon the distant lights are passing swiftly to
port, a scant 50 yards away _ too close for comfort.
   Evasive action in a tanker is a slow-motion maneuver; the tanker
I was operating would need a mile to go from full ahead to a full
stop, and in that maneuver it would swing out of control as much as
60 degrees.
   The ship would continue to move forward five lengths in making a
right-angle turn. Slowing down might seem a smart thing for a
novice to do. But below 5 knots, the tanker responds poorly in a
turn and is more susceptible to wind and current.
   And going slow can't be quickly corrected. At one point,
McGourthy increases speed to compensate for my sloppy steering. ``I
kicked up the speed five minutes ago and we're only up one knot,''
he says.
   The number of oil tankers has dwindled by several hundred in
recent years to 3,180, said Arthur McKenzie of the Tanker Advisory
Center in New York. But the average cargo is on the rise, raising
the stakes in navigating them properly.
   The Exxon Valdez accident, said Capt. Geoff Motte, the academy's
vice president, was ``an error in judgment. And that's what these
simulators can cure. We can cram into a week the kind of experience
it would take years to get into at sea.''
   The commanders at the academy scratch their heads trying to
figure out how the Valdez ran aground. But they refuse to
second-guess the crew without knowing the facts.
   ``I don't believe there's a shipmaster afloat, including me,
that wouldn't admit to being in a few close shaves,'' Motte said.
``I've never been in a collision and never been in a grounding, but
I've come close.''
   So have I, skipper. So have I.

<TEXT>
   President Hussain Muhammad Ershad on
Saturday offered amnesty to tribal rebels fighting for autonomy in
southern Bangladesh if they surrendered arms within a month, an
official said.
   Ershad made the offer while addressing a public meeting at the
town of Khagrachari, 110 miles southeast of Dhaka, the president's
press secretary, Toab Khan, said.
   Ershad also offered the rebels limited autonomy within the
country's constitution and promised to hold elections in the tribal
region, Khan said.
   The president said all rebels who surrender arms by May 20 will
be given amnesty and offered financial help.
   The tribal rebels, who have been blamed for about 4,000 killings
in their 14-year-old bush war, rejected an offer of limited
autonomy last year.
   The rebels are mostly Buddhist and oppose the government's
policy of settling Moslem Bengali people from central Bangladesh in
their region, the Chittagong hill tracts.
   The tracts encompass 8,125 square miles of hilly jungles on the
border with India.

<HEAD>Vietnamese Family Meets Navy Skipper Who Saved Them</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PENSACOLA, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Vietnamese family was reunited with the
U.S. admiral who saved their lives by dumping $10 million worth of
helicopters in the sea so they could land a small plane on the deck
of his aircraft carrier.
   South Vietnamese Maj. Bung Lee, his wife and their five children
had crammed into a single-seat Cessna O-1 Bird Dog to escape from
their homeland as it was overrun by communist forces in April 1975.
   It appeared they would be unable to land on the USS Midway in
the South China Sea because its flight deck was filled with
helicopters used to evacuate Saigon. Rear Adm Lawrence Chambers,
now retired, ordered the deck cleared.
   ``His decision was priceless,'' Lee said. ``Without his decision
we would not be here today.''
   Lee and Chambers reminisced about the landing at the U.S. Naval
Aviation Museum, where the tiny plane was ut on display Friday.
   Another retired rear admiral, Magruder H. Tuttle, bought the
plane for an undisclosed price 13 years ago and donated it to the
museum at Pensacola Naval Air Station.
   Lee, now a waiter at a Polynesian restaurant at Walt Disney
World; his wife, Van, an electronics worker, and four of their
children came from their Winter Park home for the dedication
ceremony.
   Chambers said he worried for a moment about destroying the
choppers, but ``the situation was desperate.''
   Lee had flown through Viet Cong gunfire in dense fog, heading
out to sea without knowing what was ahead. The plane was miles from
shore and running low on fuel when he spotted the Midway, which
saved 3,000 refugees.
   Lee had no radio, so he attempted to drop a note onto the deck
asking permission to land. He said he was afraid to fly too low for
fear the crew might think it was under attack and shoot down the
plane.
   Three times he dropped notes attached to a knife, a boot and a
key chain. but each was too light and blew away.
   On the fourth attempt, a note tied to Lee's survival pistol hit
the carrier's deck. It read: ``Can you move these helicopters to
the other side, I can land on your runway, I can fly 1 hour more,
we have enough time to move. Please rescue me. Major Bung-Ly wife
and 5 child.''
   Chambers said there wasn't space to move the UH-1 Huey
helicopters, so he ordered them pushed overboard. The single-engine
plane touched down once, bounced and rolled to a stop.
   ``The crew was ecstatic to see the major make his first carrier
landing,'' Chambers said.

<HEAD>Iran, Iraq Report No Progress on Peace Talks</HEAD>
<DATELINE>GENEVA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The foreign ministers of Iran and Iraq resumed
direct peace talks Saturday, but they appeared no closer to a
permanent truce than when negotiations began eight months ago.
   Iraqi Foreign Minister Tariq Aziz, leaving after 2{ hours of
talks with his Iranian counterpart, Ali Akbar Velayati, said the
meeting brought only a reiteration of clashing positions.
   Asked if there was any progress on clearing those obstacles,
Aziz replied, ``I cannot say yes.''
   The talks were chaired by U.N. Secretary-General Javier Perez de
Cuellar, who also had two separate session in the past 24 hours
with the Iranian minister in an apparent attempt to soften
positions.
   Another session was planned Sunday, U.N. spokeswoman Nadia
Younes said.
   Periodic U.N.-sponsored talks began five days after an Aug. 20
cease-fire but immediately stalled over Iran's demand for a full
withdrawal of Iraqi troops from Iran and Iraq's insistence on early
dredging of the Shatt-al-Arab, its only sea outlet.
   The latest sessions started Thursday with a joint ministerial
meeting that Perez de Cuellar said did not deal with substantive
issues.
   Talks are tentatively scheduled to recess Monday, but
participants have left open the possibility of an extension.
   The president of the International Committee of the Red Cross,
Cornelio Sommaruga, said he met Perez de Cuellar Saturday and
expressed renewed concern that all prisoners of war taken in the
Iran-Iraq war must be repatriated.
   He said priority should continue to be given to wounded and sick
POWs, but also to captured children and the longest-held prisoners.
   The Geneva-based ICRC monitors compliance with the Geneva
Conventions on international humanitarian law.
   The ICRC agreed to supervise a POW exchange last November, but
Iran quickly pulled out of the accord after charging Iraq had
reneged.
   Only about 700 prisoners, mostly Iranians, have returned home
since the cease-fire took effect. The ICRC says both sides together
hold about 100,000 POWs captured in the eight-year war.

<HEAD>Ethics Report Raises Curtain on Washington Hard-Ball</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MATT YANCEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   House Speaker Jim Wright's intervention with
federal S&amp;L regulators on behalf of Texas businessmen did not
strictly violate ethical standards, according to the House ethics
committee, but its report provides an inside peek at how truly
hard-ball politics is played in the nation's capital.
   Wright, according to a report by the ethics panel's general
counsel, put a ``hold'' on a bill in late 1986 to provide
regulators $15 billion through special fees on the industry to
close the most critically insolvent savings and loan institutions,
many of them in Texas.
   During the same period, Wright was meeting with officials of the
Federal Home Loan Bank Board, which regulates the thrift industry,
on behalf of four Texas businessmen _ two of them Democratic Party
fund-raisers _ deeply embroiled in the S&amp;L crisis.
   Despite split votes by the ethics committee clearing Wright of
specific violations of House rules in those meetings, special
counsel Richard Phelan concluded Wright exercised ``undue
influence'' in two of the cases and in trying to get two of the
Bank Board's toughest regulators fired.
   And several Bank Board officials told the committee of instances
in which they felt compelled to bow to Wright's demands in order to
prevent collapse of the S&amp;L insurance fund that guarantees
depositors against losses up to $100,000.
   At the time, the Bank Board's Federal Savings and Loan Insurance
Corp. (FSLIC) subsidiary had only a $3 billion _ a fraction of what
it would need _ to rescue of depositors in 130 ``severely
troubled'' S&amp;Ls.
   A combination of plummeting real estate values from the collapse
of the Oil Belt economy plus Ponzi schemes by ``high flyer'' real
estate developers who jumped into the S&amp;L business, particularly in
Texas with its loose banking regulations, had made many of their
outstanding loans worthless.
   As the crisis developed, the Reagan administration in May 1986
asked Congress to recapitalize the S&amp;L insurance fund with $15
billion to be financed through special assessments on member
institutions.
   The bill was put on the House calendar for action on Sept. 29.
But two weeks earlier _ on Sept. 15 _ Wright, then the House
Majority Leader, called the Bank Board's then-chairman, Edwin Gray,
to his office to complain about ``heavy-handed'' and
``Gestapo-like'' tactics of Bank Board regional officials in Dallas.
   On Sept. 2, Wright had met in his Fort Worth office with Craig
Hall, a Dallas-based real estate syndicator and one of the largest
owners of real estate in Texas. Hall complained to Wright that the
Bank Board was too inflexible, according to the Ethics Committee's
report.
   Hall said he could not keep current with hundreds of millions in
dollars in loans with more than 20 S&amp;Ls because of the worsening
Texas economy. He had arranged ``global'' repackaging deal with all
but one of them, Westwood Savings and Loan of Los Angeles, which
held approximately $200 million of his loans.
   Because of its already severe loan losses, Westwood was under
the control of a Bank Board representative. The Bank Board official
had concluded it would be less expensive for the federal insurance
fund to foreclose on Hall's property and let him go bankrupt rather
than accept the restructuring package.
   Shortly after the Sept. 2 meeting, Wright called Gray to
complain about the Bank Board representative running Westwood and
asked him ``if there was not anything he could do about this,''
according to Gray.
   On Sept. 26, a Friday, Hall, Gray and other Bank Board officials
learned that Wright had put a hold on the $15 billion S&amp;L insurance
fund recapitalization scheduled for House action the following
Monday.
   Three days later, Gray replaced the Bank Board's representative
at Westwood. The bill was put back on the House calendar for Oct. 6
and passed the next day.
   But for Wright's request, Gray told the ethics committee, ``I
would have taken some other corrective action, such as, `You're
going to have to be more communicative, listen better, be more
prepared.'''
   Gray said Wright made no specific threats nor used any coercive
terms. At the same time, Gray said he was convinced he was being
asked to remove the Bank Board official overseeing Westwood.
   ``Anybody who has worked in the government for very long knows
that when the Speaker _ soon to be the Speaker of the House of
Representatives _ is asking you to look into it, it's not just
anybody.''
   Shannon Fairbanks, then the Bank Board's chief of staff, told
the ethics committee that Gray and other agency officials felt they
were under extreme pressure to bow to that request and several
others by Wright before the bill, in a different version, was
signed into law 11 months later.
   ``Ed (Gray) believed that he was being posed a choice,'' she
said. ``And that choice was: Craig Hall has a significant problem
with your system; you say your system needs money, but I am not
going to be prepared to give that system money unless I see
evidence that your system is capable of responding; and that
evidence can be provided by being responsive to Craig Hall.''
   As a result, she said, the Bank Board felt compelled to
compromise its regulatory standards in order to obtain the funds it
needed.
   ``Throughout that whole period, we tormented, and we didn't like
what we did,'' she told the ethics committee. ``I had spent a lot
of years growing up talking theoretically about means and ends, and
the end here was the ability to start to close down these
institutions with adequate money. But the means was a perversion of
the system.''
   Phelan, the ethics committee's counsel, said neither Wright nor
his staff ever looked at the merits of the Bank Board's regulatory
activities or gave any consideration to the legal bases for its
actions.
   Phelan likened Wright's actions to ``blackmail'' and said he
``called for reconsideration regardless of the legal justification.
Blocking of the recapitalization bill after his call regarding Hall
constituted a prohibited suggestion of reprisal.''
   In August 1987, the Bank Board finally received a $10.8 billion
recapitalization package, but only after President Reagan had
threatened to veto any amount less.
   During the interim, it had been cut to $5 billion at one point
through the efforts of House Democratic Whip Tony Coelho of
California and the U.S. League of Savings Institutions, the S&amp;L
industry's biggest lobbying arm and a large source of political
campaign funds.
   Of the $38 billion that the government committed in 1988 to
closing down or merging insolvent S&amp;Ls, $25 billion involved
institutions in Texas or defaults on loans from thrifts in other
states for Texas real estate ventures.
   Last week, the Senate approved an S&amp;L bailout bill with a
minimum estimated costs of $126 billion _ two-thirds of if from
taxpayers _ over the next 10 years.
   ``We would not be here today talking about a $126 billion
problem if we had passed the $15 billion in FSLIC recapitalization
in October of 1986,'' Sen. Jake Garn, R-Utah and former chairman of
the Senate Banking Committee, said in opening the debate last
Monday.
   ``I'm not going to insult anybody's intelligence by saying that
$15 billion would have solved the problem, but it's safe to say the
problem would be at least half what it is today,'' Garn said. ``It
would have provided funds to close down a lot of those brain-dead
institutions before they continued to make bad loans.''

<HEAD>Hussein Believes Prospects Good for Middle East Peace</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GEORGE GEDDA</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Despite widespread mob violence at home, King
Hussein of Jordan seemed almost ebullient during his visit here
this past week, reflecting his view that the parties to the
Arab-Israeli conflict may finally be ready to grapple seriously
with the issues that divide them.
   Hussein has watched the tumultuous politics of his region from
up close for almost as long as Israel has existed, and he senses
that the possibilities for peace are rising.
   ``The conditions are as ripe as they've never been for progress
towards a final comprehensive peace in the area,'' Hussein said
Saturday on CNN's ``Evans &amp; Novak'' program.
   A senior Jordanian official told a group of American reporters
Thursday not long after Hussein had concluded his talks with
President Bush and Secretary of State James A. Baker III that the
king and the president saw eye-to-eye.
   ``His majesty and the president had almost identical views on
almost every subject that was discussed,'' said the official, who
asked not to be quoted by name.
   It was a mixed week for Hussein, with at least the promise of
progress toward a Middle East peace settlement on the one hand
coupled somewhat incongruously on the other with rampaging rioters
at home protesting recent price increases.
   Hussein's visit capped off an intensive period of Middle East
diplomacy for the Bush administration. He had been preceded here by
Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir and Egyptian President Hosni
Mubarak.
   Hussein and Bush have known each other for years, and their
mutual regard was evident both in their public statements and the
deferential manner in which they treated each other during the
hours they spent together on Wednesday, culminating in a glittering
White House state dinner.
   The senior Jordanian official said he believes the new
administration may pursue a more evenhanded policy on the Middle
East than the Reagan administration.
   He said it is more likely now than before that the United States
will be perceived ``by both sides (Arabs and Israelis) that it is
taking the genuine interests of both sides into consideration.''
   Aside from an American president perceived to be better suited
to advance the peace process, the official also said the
Palestinine Liberation Organization has come a long way from the
time when it was refusing negotiation, recognition or peace with
Israel _ ``the three noes.''
   The PLO, he said, has retreated on each of these points and now,
it ``has accepted all the American stipulations.'' Beyond that, he
added, the new PLO position ``has overwhelming Arab support.''
   Hussein is encouraged by the U.S.-PLO dialogue which began last
December and by the similarity of views between the United States
and the Soviet Union on the possibility of a U.N.-sponsored
international conference on the Middle East.
   The official was critical of Shamir, suggesting that ``our three
noes'' have been replaced by Shamir's ``five noes.''
   These include, he said, no recognition of the PLO, no
independent Palestinian state, no withdrawal from the occupied
territories, no withdrawal from Jerusalem and no international
conference on the Middle East.
   Still, the official said Shamir seems to have been chastened by
the 17 months of turmoil in the West Bank and Gaza Strip and may be
more flexible than before.
   Shamir now says that ``no option is excluded'' in negotiations
for a final settlement, suggesting a retreat from his previous
position that Israel opposes any surrender of territory in exchange
for peace, the official said.
   None of the parties to the conflict has rejected outright
Shamir's call for Palestinian elections in the territories as an
initial step in a broader peace process.
   But all the parties concur that negotiations on the objective of
the elections and the next steps beyond that stage en route to a
final settlement will be fraught with difficulties.
   Nonethelss, as the Jordanian official described it, ``the
important thing is to start a process. The status quo is not
possible to maintain. Advocating the status quo means advocating a
deterioration of the situation.''

   Iraq said Saturday it is building a
sophisticated Soviet-designed battle tank and developing a new
long-range missile as part of a major program to beef up its
weapons industry.
   Maj. Gen. Amer Sa'di, chief of Iraq's military industries, also
said Iraq is negotiating with France to build advanced Mirage 2000
fighters and with four other aircraft companies to build their
warplanes.
   He also disclosed that the Soviet Union will participate in an
Iraqi arms exhibition that begins April 28.
   Sa'di, speaking to reporters during a preview of the weapons
show, said the Soviet-designed T-72 battle tank Iraq is building is
equipped with sophisticated combat systems.
   Sa'di said the first tank off the production line will be a
centerpiece of the five-day exhibition, a showcase for Iraq's
rapidly developing domestic arms industry.
   The exhibition will be staged as a temporary truce between Iran
and Iraq drags into a ninth month with no agreement on a permanent
peace in sight.
   The Soviet Union, Iraq's main army supplier, provided Baghdad
with hundreds of T-72s during the war. They were widely used in a
string of Iraqi victories that forced Iran to accept a
U.N.-sponsored cease-fire that took effect Aug. 20.
   Sa'di said the military also will display new Iraqi-made weapons
at the exhibition.
   ``You will see more sophisticated, more advanced missiles with a
longer range and better capabilities than we used against Iran,''
he declared.
   ``Many people are going to be surprised at what we will put on
display at the show and with the variety and quality,'' he said.
   Among other displays will be Soviet air force MiG-29 fighter
jets with Sukhoi Su-24 and Su-25 fighter-bombers, he said.
   The respected London-based Flight International magazine
reported in December that Moscow has supplied Iraq with an
unspecified number of advanced Su-25s.
   The powerful Iraqi air force, a key factor in the war, also took
delivery of some MiG-29s from the Soviets last year.
   Sa'di noted that the Soviet jets will be flown by Iraqi pilots
who will stage an air display during the exhibition. It was the
first time the Iraqis have acknowledged their pilots were capable
of handling the advanced Sukhois.
   Sa'di's disclosure that the Soviets will participate in the
exhibition came as a surprise. The Soviets had indicated earlier
they were reluctant to take part while Iran-Iraq peace talks were
going on.
   Moscow has been improving its relations with Iran in recent
months.
   ``The Soviet military industry enterprises wanted to
participate, but they had to wait for a political decision which
wasn't taken until the last minute,'' a diplomatic source said on
condition of anonymity.
   Sa'di also said an agreement with France's Dassault aircraft
company to produce the supersonic Mirage 2000 could be reached
later this year.
   France was Iraq's second-biggest arms supplier during the war
and sold hardware worth an estimated $5 billion. Sa'di did not
identify the other aircraft manufacturers with whom he said Iraq
was negotiating.

<HEAD>Judge Releases Dozen Pages of Uncensored Transcript</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The judge in the Oliver North trial, saying it
was all a misunderstanding, on Saturday released 12 uncensored
pages of a court transcript that previously had been released with
large portions blacked out by the court security officer.
   The Associated Press and nine other news organization filed a
motion with U.S. District Judge Gerhard A. Gesell on Friday asking
for an uncut version of the transcript, which was of the closing
remarks made in open court Wednesday by North lawyer Brendan
Sullivan.
   The heaviest deletions were of Sullivan's references to
``intercepts'' of information that tracked the shipment of Hawk
missiles to Iran in 1985. The intercepts, Sullivan said in the
blacked out portion, told White House officials ``where they were,
when they were delivered, what ocean they were over and when they
got there.''
   At another point, Sullivan said, the materials were distributed
by hand _ not even sent by messenger _ because ``it is the most
guarded, most closely held intelligence in the United States
government.''
   In ordering the documents' release, Gesell said that until the
news media complaint arrived, ``the court was unaware that through
a misunderstanding'' the portions were blacked out.
   Gesell, however, denied another news media request for a sealed
stipulation about top-secret intercepts about the Iranian
initiative collected in 1985 and 1986 at North's request by the
National Security Agency.

<HEAD>Sylvia Plath's Tombstone Returned; Husband Lashes at Critics</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT BARR</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The stone has been returned to the grave of Sylvia
Plath, restoring the married name that vandals _ perhaps her
admirers _ have repeatedly tried to erase.
   On Saturday, Poet Laureate Ted Hughes struck back at recent
criticism of his custody of the grave and of the legacy of his
wife, the tormented American poet who killed herself Feb. 11, 1963
at the age of 30.
   ``When I first had the lettering set into the stone ... the only
question in my mind was how to get the name Plath on to it,''
Hughes said in a letter printed in Saturday's edition of The
Independent.
   ``If I had followed custom, the stone would be inscribed Sylvia
Hughes, which was her legal name. For her children, it was their
mother's name.''
   But, he added, ``I was already well aware, in 1963, of what she
had achieved under that name, and I wished to honor it.''
   Plath, who was born in Boston, was posthumously honored with the
Pulitzer Prize in 1982. She was estranged from Hughes at the time
of her death, and some of her partisans have accused him of
smothering her in housework and leaving her for another woman.
   Many of her poems were intensely personal. Some of the
best-known ones, such as ``Lady Lazarus'' and ``Daddy,'' deal with
illness, suffering and death.
   Hughes burned the last volume of her journals, saying he did not
want their son and daughter ever to have to read them.
   He said that her married name, set in riveted lead letters, was
chiseled off the tombstone three times.
   After a fourth attempt, he had the stone removed and was
contemplating a new design. However, he said, he found the stone
had been repaired last year by the engraver who was keeping it and
he agreed to have it restored to its place near the Church of St.
Thomas the Apostle in the village of Heptonstall.
   The stone bears the name Sylvia Plath Hughes and a line of
poetry: ``Even amidst fierce flames the golden lotus can be
planted.'' It is a sentence from Sanskrit that ``I used to tell her
when she was low,'' Hughes said.
   The controversy was stirred up earlier this month when Julia
Parnaby of the University of Lancaster and Rachel Wingfield of the
University of Cambridge wrote to The Guardian newspaper complaining
about the lack of a marker on the grave.
   ``By failing to replace the headstone and thus leaving Plath's
grave unidentifiable, her place in the tradition of women's
literature is being denied and her work devalued,'' they wrote.
   In a long letter published Thursday in The Guardian, Hughes
attacked the two women for falsely claiming that he and Plath had
signed divorce papers.
   ``I am no great student in the Fantasia which has obscured the
life and death of Sylvia Plath, but so far as I am aware Ms.
Parnaby and Wingfield are the first in 26 years to decide that this
bit of her history needs to be rewritten,'' Hughes wrote.
   ``There is rather more to it. Perhaps Ms. Parnaby and Wingfield
will plead that they did not invent this bit of apocrypha, but that
certain other people have been accepting it as gospel for some time.
   ``If that is so, perhaps it would explain why Sylvia Plath's
grave has been so repeatedly vandalized. Ms. Parnaby and
Wingfield's wording of their mischievous falsehood can be read, to
my mind, very like an incitement for other misguided enthusiasts to
desecrate the grave afresh.''
   Hughes' letter to The Independent took issue with an article by
Ronald Hayman, who complained that Hughes and his sister had kept
``a firm grip on biographers,'' to the extent of threatening to
withhold copyright material from authors who criticized Hughes'
family.
   ``Mr. Hayman tells us that `nobody owns fact.' I hope each of us
owns the facts of her or his own life,'' Hughes wrote. ``Otherwise
you, reader, might suddenly find yourself reinvented by a Mr.
Hayman who had decided that he owns your facts and can do what he
likes with them.''

<HEAD>Newspaper: Campbell Soup Heir Eliminated Trust For Museum</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PHILADELPHIA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Campbell Soup Co. heir John T. Dorrance Jr.
rewrote his will last year after a tax law was changed, eliminating
a trust that could have brought millions to the Philadelphia Museum
of Art and Princeton University.
   The trust was in a 1987 will but was deleted in a will dated
June 1988, The Philadelphia Inquirer reported Saturday.
   Dorrance, the biggest shareholder and former chairman of the
Camden, N.J., company, died of a heart attack April 9 at age 70.
His father invented condensed soup.
   Under the previous will, income from a trust would have
benefited the museum, Princeton and St. George's School, a prep
school in Newport, R.I., the newspaper reported. Income from the
trust would have continued for 25 years.
   The trust would have gotten the bulk of Dorrance's estate, the
newspaper said, but did not elaborate. Dorrance often was included
in lists of the nation's richest people with a fortune estimated at
$1.5 billion.
   Under the new will, Dorrance left nothing to the two schools,
both of which he had attended, the newspaper said. The museum will
get two valuable pieces of porcelain as well as $5 million that
Dorrance had pledged before his death.
   Most of the estate will be divided equally among his six
grandchildren. Its value was not specified in the will.
   Campbell spokesman Scott Rombach said Saturday he could not
confirm that a will had been filed or give details of any previous
will.
   Sandra Horrocks, a spokeswoman for the museum, said Saturday she
would have no comment. Princeton spokeswoman Jacquelyn Savani did
not immediately return a telephone message Saturday seeking comment.
   His will was changed after Congress revoked a
``generation-skipping'' estate tax break offered to grandchildren
of wealthy people who form large trusts that provide income to
charities, the newspaper said. Charitable groups had lobbied
Congress not to revise the tax break, arguing it would lead to
fewer gifts.
   Princeton would have received 50 percent of the income from the
trust, the museum 40 percent and St. George's 10 percent, the
newspaper said.
   Dorrance was chairman of the art museum board. His $5 million
pledge was the biggest cash gift the museum had ever received.
   ``We are thankful for his vast generosity given during his
lifetime,'' said Joseph Rishel, museum curator of 19th-century art.
   The value of the two pieces of porcelain _ nearly life-size
goats made of Meissen china in the early 18th century _ has not
been disclosed, but Rishel said the figures are ``fabulous, really
spectacular, real showstoppers.''

   The army on Saturday barred Israeli leftists
carrying black flags of mourning from entering the West Bank
village of Nahalin, the site of a bloody raid by border police that
killed five people.
   Also Saturday, officials at Jerusalem's Mukassed Hospital said a
Palestinian suspected of collaborating with Israeli authorities had
died Thursday of stab wounds.
   Arab reports identified the man as Musallam Mahmoud Shaheen, 40,
and said masked youths broke into his West Bank home and attacked
him because they suspected him of cooperating with Israel.
   Another suspected collaborator, a 32-year-old Palestinian woman,
was hospitalized with broken limbs after being beaten for at least
two days by Arab militants, the army and Arab reports said.
   In the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip, 16 Palestinians,
including six children under the age of 15, were wounded in clashes
with troops, Arab hospital officials said. An army official
confirmed five wounded.
   Throughout the occupied lands, Palestinians observed a general
strike called by the pro-PLO leaders of the uprising.
   Shops were shuttered and transportation came to a halt. In Gaza,
activists blocked roads with stones to enforce the strike.
   Israeli legislator Yossi Sarid led a convoy of 20 cars draped
with black flags to Nahalin, but the group was stopped by troops
slightly more than a mile outside the village. Sarid said soldiers
told him the area was closed to civilians.
   ``It's possible to block our entrance, but they can't block our
message of total opposition to the massacre that happened in the
village,'' Sarid of the left-wing Citizens Rights Movement told The
Associated Press.
   Preliminary results of an army investigation showed that border
police fired indiscriminately during their April 13
search-and-arrest raid in the village. In the occupied territories,
border police are under army command and are often dispatched on
such raids.
   At Mukassed Hospital, 25-year-old Walid Mohammed Najadereh died
late Friday of head wounds sustained in the raid, hospital
officials said. His death brought the death toll in the raid to
five.
   The deaths of Najadereh and Shaheen raised to 442 the number of
Palestinians killed since the December 1987 start of the uprising.
Eighteen Israelis also died.
   In the West Bank town of Ramallah, 32-year-old Sabah Kanaan was
hospitalized with multiple fractures after being held by members of
a so-called Palestinian strike force, army officials and Arab
reporters said.
   The militants broke into Mrs. Kanaan's home in the West Bank
city of Nablus on Tuesday night and beat her with clubs and sticks
because they believed she collaborated with Israel, said an Arab
reporter, quoting the woman's neighbors.
   ``She was shouting `I'll stop, I'll stop!''' the reporter quoted
the neighbors as saying.
   Israel radio said Mrs. Kanaan was held for three days.
   Since the start of the uprising, dozens of Palestinians,
including several women, have been killed by fellow Palestinians
who accused them of collaboration.

<HEAD>Jackson Says Economic Opportunity Must Follow Political Victory</HEAD>

<DATELINE>NEW ORLEANS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Jesse Jackson on Saturday told delegates to
the African American Summit '89 that black election victories mean
little if economic opportunity doesn't follow.
   ``We have not been successful here if we've been legislated in
and regulated out,'' Jackson said on the second day of the
three-day conference billed as a meeting to set a political and
social agenda for the 1990s.
   Touching on numerous other topics, Jackson stressed the need for
awareness among Americans of blacks' African heritage, a theme he
has sounded often this year as a leader in a movement to supplant
the term ``black'' with ``African American.''
   ``We are not descended from slaves, nor up from slavery, but
rather Africans who were enslaved. ... The African roots in
American civilization must be taught in all American schools,'' the
civil rights leader said.
   A candidate for the Democratic presidential nomination in 1984
and 1988, Jackson complained that a lack of unity was a key reason
Richard Daley won the Chicago mayoral race earlier this year over
black candidate Tim Evans.
   Evans lost because ``we broke the three rules: A house divided
against itself cannot win, do unto others as you would have them do
unto you and love one another as I have loved you,'' Jackson said.
   Jackson also ridiculed judicial decisions against affirmative
action, particularly a recent Supreme Court decision striking down
a Richmond, Va., program setting aside 30 percent of contracting
jobs for minorities.
   ``It's not about the 70 percent the whites were already
getting,'' said Jackson. ``It's about the other 30 percent they
want.''
   Jackson's stirring 45-minute speech drew the largest crowd so
far in the conference, filling for the first time the 1,000 seats
set up in a corner of the huge New Orleans Convention Center.
   The meeting drew only half the number organizers had predicted
and about 1,700 fewer than attended a similar rally organized by
then-Mayor Richard Hatcher in Gary, Ind., in 1972. Hatcher is
chairman of this weekend's gathering.
   ``I'm disappointed in the turnout,'' said Maryland delegate Curt
Anderson. ``But I think what's important is there were good people
who did come out.''

<HEAD>Explosion in Moscow Watch Factory Touches Off Disaster Rumors</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A fire and explosion in a Moscow watch factory
killed two people, injured two others and touched off rumors that a
radioactive cloud had been released over the Soviet capital,
official media said Saturday.
   However, the Tass news agency said the worries were based on
``incredible and unfounded'' rumors.
   Tass said the Moscow city council was besieged with telephone
calls Friday night from Muscovites worried that their neighborhood
might be contaminated by poisonous gas released by the explosion
earlier in the day.
   State-run Radio Moscow said some Muscovites were concerned that
radiation might have leaked into the air.
   Tass, in dismissing the worries, said authorities were trying to
determine who called child-care centers to tell them to keep
children indoors and close windows.
   The fire and explosion occurred when plant workers installing
new wiring in an unventilated area accidentally ignited a gas leak,
Tass said.
   The blast killed a woman worker, and an electrician was burned
and later died. Two other women were hospitalized with injuries.
   ``Troubled Muscovites were inquiring as to what kind of
explosion happened Friday morning at one of the enterprises of the
Cheremyshkinsky region and how dangerous it was for people living
in neighboring areas,'' Tass said.

<HEAD>Soviet Paper Identifies Chemical Used in Georgia, Says it Not Fatal</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN-THOR DAHLBURG</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Defense Ministry newspaper said Saturday that
an irritating chemical agent was used on pro-independence
demonstrators in Soviet Georgia, but it quoted an official as
saying the substance does not cause suffocation or poisoning.
   However, the newspaper acknowledged a report in the local
Communist Party daily, Zarya Vostoka, that 61 people suffering
poisoning symptoms were hospitalized in Georgia and that some were
in ``grave condition.''
   Georgian activists claim several of the 19 people killed when
soldiers broke up an April 9 demonstration were victims of poison
gas. They also say military authorities refused to identify the
substance or tell doctors how to treat patients suffering from
exposure to it.
   The Defense Ministry paper Red Star identified the substance as
``cheremukha.''
   Soviet officials have previously said ``tear gas'' was used in
Georgia but have given no further details.
   ``We used only `cheremukha,' and it alone,'' Red Star quoted a
representative of the Soviet Interior Ministry, Maj.-Gen. Yu.
Yefimov, as saying. ``It is a substance basically consisting of
chloroacetophenone.... `Cheremukha' is an irritant, but it does not
cause suffocation or poisoning.''
   A Western military attache in Moscow said the substance's base
was a type of incapacitating agent stronger than tear gas and akin
to what is commonly known in the West as ``CS.''
   Yefimov told the newspaper only 27 cartridges of the substance
were used by soldiers, ``and not in the square in front of
Government House where people were killed, but in two other
places'' on the capital city's main thoroughfare, Rustaveli
Prospekt.
   He said internal security troops attached to the Interior
Ministry used the chemical on his order, ``as they say, when
passions `had burst their banks.'''
   Despite Yefimov's contention the chemical cannot cause poisoning
or suffocation, the weekly Moscow News reported in its issue last
week that the substance used on protesters could have been a factor
in the fatalities.
   ``The use of gas in great concentrations can lead to the
instantaneous loss of consciousness,'' Moscow News said. ``A
helpless person then falls under the feet of a running crowd.''
   Yefimov said the use of the chemical was authorized by a July 28
decree from the Supreme Soviet Presidium, which says ``special
means'' may be used for ``suppressing mass unrest, group violations
of public order and other anti-social activities.''
   He claimed the April 9 rally in front of Georgian government
headquarters fell into that category because ``seizure of political
power, overthrow of the present regime and the separation of
Georgia from the U.S.S.R. were publicly discussed.''
   Georgia's leadership assumed responsibility for the clash and
the Communist Party leader and premier resigned.
   The protests began in early April in reaction to demands by the
small Black Sea area of Abkhazia to be separated from Georgia. They
evolved into massive protests by groups depending Georgian
independence from the Soviet Union.

   Hundreds of thousands of soccer fans
stood silently Saturday in streets and stadiums across Britain to
commemorate 95 people killed at a game one week earlier.
   From Brechin, Scotland, to Plymouth on the southwest coast of
England, fans at Football League stadiums observed a minute of
silence seven days to the minute after the disaster halted their
season. The league estimated a half million fans took part.
   The 95 people died at the Liverpool-Nottingham Forest cup
semifinal match at Hillsborough stadium in Sheffield in the crush
of an overcrowded standing-room-only section.
   Reports from the press and officials have blamed the deaths on
drunkeness, hooliganism, poor crowd control, and the stadium design
itself. However, government inquiries are still under way.
   In Liverpool, Nottingham, and Sheffield, residents took their
grief into the streets. Pedestrians halted, traffic lights stayed
red, and traffic stopped for one minute. In some areas, trains
halted and shops closed briefly.
   In Nottingham's city center, air raid sirens sounded for the
first time since VE Day in 1945, when Nazi Germany surrendered to
the Allies.
   At Hillsborough stadium, more than 1,000 people gathered outside
gates where fans surged into the grounds a week ago and created the
lethal crush.
   Inside, 300 relatives and friends of victims paid private
respects, and no game was played.
   The bells of Liverpool's Metropolitan Cathedral rang for six
minutes _ the amount of time the Liverpool-Nottingham game had been
going on when the tragedy began.
   At Anfield stadium, the home turf of the Liverpool team, no game
was played either. Almost half the field was carpeted with flowers,
and the standing-room terraces were festooned with team scarves and
other tributes to the dead.
   A one-mile chain of thousands of red and blue scarves joined the
stadiums of rival teams Liverpool and Everton. The final scarf was
tied by Barry Devenside, father of 18-year-old victim Christopher.
   Afterward, team director Sydney Moss led the Liverpool players
onto the field at Anfield stadium.
   Roman Catholic Archbishop Derek Worlock announced that the
Salvation Army brass band would play the Liverpool anthem ``You'll
Never Walk Alone.''
   The minute's silence was broken only by a sobbing child.

<TEXT>
   The head of the nation's biggest union
said Saturday he will call a strike next month to protest
government austerity measures that earlier this year prompted the
worst rioting in Venezuelan history.
   The one-day strike, which would be the first major work stoppage
in 31 years of democratic government, ``will definitely go'' in
May, said Juan Jose Delpino, president of the Venezuelan Workers
Confederation.
   The union plans to hold a two-day congress next week to discuss
strategy for fighting the belt-tightening program, which resulted
in sharp increases in bus fares, gasoline and other goods and
services.
   The austerity plan, the result of an agreement with the
International Monetary Fund so Venezuela could ease its $33 billion
foreign debt, spurred violent protests in February. More than 300
people were killed and 2,000 injured in Caracas alone.
   The labor group represents 3 million of Venezuela's 5.8 million
workers.
   President Carlos Andres Perez called the threatened strike
``suicide, because nobody would join it.''
   ``The strike and the massive obedience to our call will be the
response to that claim,'' Delpino said.
   Venezuela, an oil-producing nation whose economy has collapsed
as petroleum prices have plunged, had experienced little labor
unrest before February's riots.
   ``Venezuelan workers are living through the worst crisis since
the (labor group) was created,'' Delpino told The Associated Press.
``Workers have felt the severe impact of the economic policy.''
   The austerity program eliminated subisides on more than 25 basic
food products and implemented an indexing system that tied wage
increases to inflation rates.
   Despite the friction between the union and the government, Perez
is to open Monday's labor congress.

<HEAD>Lebanese Report Says Israel Expels 60 Families From South Lebanon</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Lebanese newspaper said Saturday that
Israel has expelled 60 families from their farms in southern
Lebanon after they refused to sell the army their land.
   An Israeli army official in Jerusalem called the reports ``not
true, totally unfounded.'' In southern Lebanon, the spokesman for
the U.N. peacekeeping force said he had no reports of villagers
being expelled. Lebanese police could not immediately confirm the
report.
   The daily An-Nahar said a 500-strong Israeli force backed by 30
armored personnel carriers stormed seven farms around the town of
Shibaa Friday and rounded up 300 people.
   Shibaa lies within Israel's self-declared security zone, a
six-to-10-mile-deep strip patrolled by Israeli troops and
Israeli-backed militiamen.
   ``The commander told the farmers they have either to sell their
10-square-mile land to Israel or give it up,'' An-Nahar said.
   It quoted unidentified residents as saying the Israelis opened
fire to force the farmers out, but that no casualties were reported.
   The farmers loaded their belongings on 300 mules and left for
Shibaa, along with their 30,000 goats and 500 cows, An-Nahar said.
   Timor Goksel, the spokesman for the U.N. Interim Force in
Lebanon said: ``We received a petition from the village signed by
142 people. They said they were informed (by Israel) that their
land would be confiscated for military purposes.''
   ``Some villagers have said they have been offered compensation,
but most don't want to accept it,'' Goksel said.
   He said the U.N. force began investigating the reports after the
Lebanese government filed a complaint with the United Nations.
   Israel expelled 70 Lebanese civilians from Shibaa and several
villages in the security zone earlier this year for refusing to
cooperate with the area's Israeli-sponsored local administration.
   Israel carved out its security zone when it withdrew the bulk of
its occupation army from southern Lebanon in June 1985.
   The strip, which extends from the Mediterranean coast in the
west to the foothills of Mount Hermon in the east, serves as a
buffer against cross-border guerrilla attacks against northern
Israeli settlements.

<HEAD>Says Former Party Leader Kadar in Poor Health</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BUDAPEST, Hungary (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Janos Kadar, removed in May as head of
Hungary's Communist Party after 32 years in power, is unable to
carry out his official functions because of poor health, a
government minister said Saturday.
   Kadar, 76, was replaced by Karoly Grosz as party leader at a
special conference and given the honorary post of party president.
   Kadar attended the second half of a meeting of the Communist
Party Central Committee last month but has been absent from recent
party meetings.
   Minister of State Rezso Nyers told a meeting of reform
communists Saturday in Szolnok that Kadar's attendance at the
Central Committee meeting may have been ``his last such
appearance,'' the official MTI news agency reported.
   Kadar was ousted as party chief as reform Communists accused him
of stifling progress. They claimed he halted Hungary's economic and
political reforms in the 1970s and crticized his role in backing
the Soviet-led invasion of Czechoslovakia in 1968 that crushed that
nation's ``Prague Spring'' reforms.
   MTI reported Nyers said the more than three decades of Kadar's
rule should be reviewed but Kadar probably would not become
personally involved in any such review because of his health.
   In another development, a fourth man who had been invited to
rejoin the Communist Party after being expelled a year ago will
remain outside the party, according to a broadcast on Hungary radio.
   It reported Mihaly Bihari, a political scientist and reform
communist, said there were ``incompatible differences'' between the
Central Committee and the four expelled last April.
   The three others, economist Laszlo Lengyel, historian Zoltan
Biro and parliamentary deputy Zoltan Kiraly, announced earlier last
week that they would not rejoin the party.
   The Central Control Committee, the party's top disciplinary
body, had reversed its expulsion order at a meeting Monday.
   Bihari was quoted by Hungary radio as saying the party is
paralyzed by irreconcilable differences within its own ranks. There
has been discussion in recent weeks about a possible split between
the party's reform and orthodox wings.

<TEXT>
   India's 125,000 dockworkers called off a
6-day-old strike Saturday after reaching an agreement with the
government on higher wages, news reports said.
   The strike had paralyzed operations in the country's 10 major
ports. Sailors from the Indian navy were deployed to unload
essential goods.
   The United News of India news agency quoted Transport Minister
Rajesh Pilot as saying the five striking trade unions of
stevedores, or dockworkers, had reached a wage settlement with the
government. He said the workers would report for duty by Monday.
   The workers had been demanding a 25 percent hike in wages but
the government offered only a 15 percent increase.
   An Indian dockhand earns between $90 and $180 per month.
   Pilot did not specify the increase agreed to in negotiations but
said the five-year settlement would satisfy the workers' demands by
the end of the contract.

   A Missouri abortion-regulation dispute in
which the Supreme Court will hear arguments Wednesday has generated
the most ``friend-of-the-court'' briefs ever submitted in one case.
   The justices are being asked to use the Missouri case to
overturn or substantially limit its 1973 decision legalizing
abortion.
   The landmark Roe vs. Wade decision, based on a woman's
constitutional right to privacy, said a woman's decision to have an
abortion during the first three months of pregnancy must be left to
her and her doctor.
   The court said states may interfere in the abortion decision
during the second trimester only to protect the woman's health, and
may take steps only to protect fetal life in the third trimester
when the fetus can survive outside the womb.
   State authority to regulate abortions after the first trimester
was not made absolute, however.
   A federal appeals court, relying on Roe vs. Wade, struck down as
unconstitutional five key provisions of the Missouri law now under
scrutiny:
   _A ban on the use of public hospitals or other facilities for
performing abortions not necessary to save a woman's life.
   _A ban prohibiting any public employee from performing or
assisting an abortion.
   _A ban on using taxpayer money for ``encouraging or counseling''
women to have abortions.
   _A requirement that doctors determine whether a fetus reasonably
believed to be older than 19 weeks is viable, capable of surving
outside the womb, by determining lung maturity and other testing.
   _A declaration that the ``life of each human begins at
conception.''
   Here are excerpts of some of the arguments raised in
friend-of-the-court briefs submitted to the justices. In all, the
court received 45 such briefs supporting the Missouri law and 33
briefs opposing it.
</TEXT>
<BYLINE>SUPPORTING ARGUMENTS</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   _From the Bush administration: ``Roe vs. Wade, as the court is
well aware, has been intensely controversial from the day it was
decided. That controversy is more than simply a reflection of the
deep divisions in American society over the underlying question of
abortion. Rather, the controversy has, in substantial measure, been
a product of the decision itself.
   ``Roe rests on assumptions that are not firmly grounded in the
Constitution; it adopts an unworkable framework tying permissible
state regulation of abortion to particular periods in pregnancy;
and it has allowed courts to usurp the function of legislative
bodies in weighing competing social, ethical and scientific factors
in reaching a judgment as to how much state regulation is
appropriate in this sensitive area.''
   _From the International Right to Life Federation: ``In most
nations of the world, abortion policy has not been the subject of
constitutional intervention by a high court, remaining determined
by a wide variety of legislative schemes ... The democratic
compromises reached in developed Western nations are significantly
more protective of fetal life than is Roe vs. Wade.''
   _From the American Collegians for Life and the Catholic League
for Religious and Civil Rights: ``Under ... Roe, the states have an
important and legitimate interest in protecting fetal life from
conception until birth, which interest becomes compelling at
viability.
   ``If the states' interest in the protection of fetal life
becomes compelling at viability, it necessarily follows that the
states possess the ability to require that the point of viability
be determined. If the compelling nature of a state's interest in
unborn human life ... is to be anything more than illusory, then
Roe and its progeny should be read to permit those states desiring
to protect fetal life to require a physician to make a
determination, consistent with sound medical practice, as to
viability.''
   _From the National Right to Life Committee: ``Abortion
jurisprudence needs resolution after 16 years of turmoil. This
court attempted to resolve the matter in 1973. Time has proven the
effort a failure. This court is now confronted with the opportunity
to restore a proper interpretation to the Constitution, returning
this volatile matter of social policy to the proper fora _ the
state legislatures.''
   _From Feminists for Life: ``There is ample evidence in the
medical studies and public health statistics cited herein that the
unfettered right of abortion on demand foisted upon our society by
the court and by abortion advocates is a public health disaster the
proportion of which we are just beginning to uncover.''
   _From Focus on Family and the Family Research Council of
America: ``Changes in understanding and medical science will always
outpace the court's ability to respond. When this court's
precedents are rooted in science and not in the Constitution, as
was Roe's trimester framework, science is pitted against precedent,
and the prestige of this honorable institution suffers.
   ``This court can best protect the interests of our citizens by
abandoning the trimester approach as outmoded, unscientific and
constitutionally unworkable, and by recognizing that the states
have legitimate interests, existing throughout pregnancy, in
protecting the life of the mother and the unborn child.''
   _From the U.S. Catholic Conference: ``If the court seriously
seeks support for abortion decisions in the historical line of
privacy cases, it must reflect accurately that one person's
`liberty' is not `license' to control even one's own body where
another's interest could suffer or the common good be diminished.''
   _From the Southern Baptist Convention, the National Association
of Evangelists, the Lutheran Church-Missouri Synod and the
Christian Life Commission: ``It has been argued that state laws
prohibiting abortion unconstitutionally impose the religious
beliefs and views of one religion upon persons not adhering to
those views, thereby constituting an `establishment' of religion
prohibited by the First Amendment.
   ``We do not advocate the imposition of our religious views by
law in order to impose on others our religious beliefs. Rather,
those religious beliefs are ... deeply seated in the moral and
ethical system that forms the basis of much of the civil and
criminal law of this nation ... The fact that a state's law
coincides with a deeply held religious belief does not render that
law unconstitutional under the First Amendment.''

<BYLINE>OPPOSING ARGUMENTS</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   _From the American Medical Association and other medical groups:
``This court has observed that viability is usually placed at about
seven months (28 weeks) but may occur earlier, even at 24 weeks.
Since the improvements in health care have resulted in greater
survival of infants born at a gestational age of 24-28 weeks ...
The earliest point at which a fetus can survive is 23-24 weeks.''
   ``Thus, while substantial strides have occurred in saving
infants born between 24 and 28 weeks, the earliest point at which
an infant can survive has changed little.
   ``What the court found in 1973 is even more true today: the
medical risks to a woman of childbirth are greater than the risks
of abortion.''
   _From 167 scientists and physicians, including 11 Nobel
laureates: ``There is no scientific consensus that a human life
begins at conception, at a given stage of fetal development or at
birth. The question of `when a human life begins' cannot be
answered by reference to scientific principles like those with
which we predict planetary movement. The answer to that question
will depend on each individual's social, religious, philosophical,
ethical and moral beliefs and values.
   ``Assertions that viability has moved significantly earlier in
fetal development are flatly contrary to the scientific evidence.
Although advances in technology have improved the chances of
survival of premature birth within the range of 24 to 28 weeks, the
outer limit of viability at 24 weeks has not significantly changed.
   ``Roe vs. Wade has not been rendered obsolete by subsequent
advancements in science.''
   _From the American Psychological Association: ``Five major
reviews of the psychological and psychiatric literature published
between 1975 and 1989 all confirm that for the overwhelming
majority of women who undergo abortion, there are no long-term
negative emotional effects.
   ``When women experience regret, depression or guilt, such
feelings are mild and diminish rapidly without adversely affecting
general functioning. Severe emotional responses are rare, even in
young women. To the contrary, the great majority of women who have
had an abortion express feelings of relief.''
   _From the National Association of Public Hospitals: ``Through
its restrictions on the use of public facilities for the purpose of
performing or assisting an abortion and on the use of public funds
for the purpose of encouraging or counseling an abortion ...
Missouri has intruded deeply into the physician-patient
relationship.
   ``Missouri's restriction ... has the effect of prohibiting
constitutionally protected conduct, and it is therefore
unconstitutional.''
   _From Women (about 3,000) who have had abortions, a compendium
filed by the National Organization for Women's Legal Defense and
Education Fund and the National Abortion Rights Action League:
``Women's privacy and liberty interests ... would be substantially
infringed upon by the provisions of the Missouri statute at issue.
The option of abortion ... is fundamental to women's lives, liberty
and their pursuit of happiness.''
   _From 281 American historians: ``At the time the federal
Constitution was adopted, abortion was known and not illegal.
Abortion was not uncommon in colonial America.
   ``A presumed interest in protecting fetal life does not justify
denying women their historic liberty to choose abortion.''

<TEXT>
   Solidarity activists are scouting for
offices, hooking up telephones and signing up volunteer poll
watchers in a flurry of activity after regaining legal status for
their independent labor movement.
   Near the center of Warsaw, a former history institute is being
transformed into the Solidarity Citizens Committee's national
election headquarters. At another location, a small union press
office has opened. At a third spot, opposition editors are planning
to put out a newspaper.
   Solidarity volunteers _ university students, mothers on leave
from jobs, longtime activists and others _ are struggling with
typical Polish shortages of office supplies, furniture and phone
lines. But they no longer need look over their shoulders.
   The government crushed Solidarity, the first independent union
in the East bloc, during a martial law crackdown in 1981 and later
banned it. After years of illegal activity, Solidarity recaptured
its legal status when a government-controlled court lifted the ban
Monday.
   The legalization stemmed from talks between the opposition and
the government that concluded in an agreement April 5. The
government also agreed to free elections to a new chamber of
parliament and other electoral reforms in exchange for political
and economic cooperation from Solidarity.
   Before it was suppressed, Solidarity claimed 10 million members.
   However, speaking at the end of a three-day visit to Italy,
Solidarity leader Lech Walesa predicted Saturday in Rome that his
labor movement will dwindle as it gives rise to splinter groups
during the reforms in Poland.
   ``From Solidarity, other economic and political organizations
will be born,'' said Walesa. ``Solidarity for the moment is huge,
but it will become smaller with the growth of other organizations.
This is the logical course of events.''
   The first major office to open in Warsaw since legalization was
the Solidarity Citizens Committee headquarters in an empty former
history institute on the edge of the picturesque Saxon Garden park.
The organization, technically separate from Solidarity, is racing
against early deadlines for finding candidates. It is collecting
nominating signatures, running campaigns, and training election
observers for parliamentary voting scheduled for June 4 and June 18.
   On Friday, Jacek Kuron, a veteran activist slated to run for the
existing upper chamber of parliament, scrambled through the
building holding quick chats with several prominent activists in
the bustling center.
   ``It's full of problems,'' he replied when asked about the
practical side of ushering in legal activity. ``We don't have
telephones, we don't have space, we don't have anything _ but we
will.''
   Jan Litynski, spokesman for the Warsaw regional chapter of
Solidarity, said: ``The mood is getting hotter and hotter because
of the elections.''
   Anatol Lawina, a Solidarity representative to the State Election
Commission, said he hopes to line up 100,000 people nationwide to
help guard against cheating at the 22,000 polling sites.
   Elsewhere in the country, local election offices and news
bureaus were also being opened.
   The Election Newspaper, a newspaper that expects to circulate
500,000 copies, has found offices in an empty building in central
Warsaw, said Ernest Skalski, one of the editors.
   The paper will become the first opposition mass-circulation
daily in the East bloc with its first edition, scheduled for May.

   Hail and damaging winds hit parts of Minnesota and Iowa on
Saturday along with the first thunderstorms of spring, while widely
scattered showers dampened parts of Florida and the northwestern
states.
   High winds in north-central Iowa damaged buildings and downed
power lines in Swea City and Bancroft and uprooted trees elsewhere.
   Hail hit near Bancroft and in southwestern Minnesota where high
winds blew down a barn north of Windom.
   A cold front in the Northeast, meanwhile, left four inches of
snow in Caribou, Maine, by early afternoon and 2 inches at Mount
Washington, N.H.
   A few showers and thunderstorms were over the southeast and east
central coast of Florida. There were widely scattered rainshowers
over the northwestern states.
   Dry weather prevailed across the rest of the nation, with sunny
skies from the southern and central high Plains to the South.
   Temperatures were generally in the 80s early Saturday afternoon
from the southeastern states to the southern and central high
Plains with readings in the 90s reported in eastern parts of
Colorado, New Mexico and Nebraska.
   Cool weather prevailed in the Great Lakes region and northeast
where readings were mostly in the 40s and 50s early Saturday
afternoon. Temperatures were in the 30s across northern New England
and much of eastern New York state.
   Temperatures around the nation at 3 p.m. EDT ranged from 26
degrees at Limestone, Maine, to 96 degrees at Dodge City, Kan., and
Lubbock and Wink, Texas.
   The low for the nation was 22 degrees at Gunnison, Colo.
   The forecast for Sunday called for some showers and
thunderstorms over the south central United States and scattered
showers and thunderstorms in the upper Ohio Valley, the southern
Appalachians and from the middle and upper Mississippi Valley to
the lower Great Lakes; rain from Michigan through Indiana and
western Ohio to western North Carolina and western Virginia; snow
showers over northern and central Maine; and scattered rainshowers
from the northern and central Pacific Coast to Montana with rain
likely across Oregon, Northern California and southwestern Idaho.
Sunny skies were expected across most of the rest of the nation.
   Temperatures were expected to remain below 60 from the Great
Lakes region to New Jersey and New England with highs in the 40s in
New England and eastern New York state, and in the 50s from the
northern and central Pacific Coast to western Montana; and above 80
from Florida and Georgia through the lower and middle Mississippi
Valley to the southern and central high Plains, with highs in the
90s from central and western Texas to southeastern Nebraska.
Readings were expected in the 80s and 90s in the Southwestern
deserts.

<HEAD>Bush Reportedly Approved Aid to Noriega Opponents</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   President Bush signed a secret intelligence
directive to provide more than $10 million in aid to opponents of
Panama's Gen. Manuel Noriega in that country's upcoming elections,
a published report says.
   Bush signed the directive, called a ``finding,'' in February,
according to the May 1 issue of US News &amp; World Report. The
magazine quotes unnamed sources as saying Bush personally lobbied
the plan through the congressional intelligence committees and won
approval for the CIA to provide more than $10 million in aid _
including printing, advertising, transportation and communications
_ to Noriega's opponents.
   Reagan set a similar program in motion one year ago, the
magazine said.
   Asked about the report on Saturday, White House spokeswoman
Alixe Glen said, ``I can't comment on intelligence matters.''
   She added that the U.S. official position remains opposed to
Noriega but that the government does not back any candidates there.
   ``Our position remains the same. We want to return democracy to
the Panamanian people.'' She added, however, ``It's the Panamanian
people that vote.''
   Panamanians go to the polls on May 7 in a presidential election
where Noriega's candidate is Carlos Duque.
   Noriega, who is accused in a federal drug trafficking case in
Miami, has been the Central American country's de facto ruler since
February 1988, when he orchestrated the ouster of President Eric
Arturo Delvalle.
   Delvalle had tried to fire Noriega as military leader.
Washington still recognizes Delvalle as the president of Panama,
and President Reagan in 1987 cut off military and economic aid to
Panama.
   Bush this month extended the sanctions which include sharp
restrictions on U.S. companies that do business in Panama, a hold
on assets of the Panamanian government in the United States and a
prohibition on tax payments by U.S. organizations to Panama.
   Administration officials have raised the possibility that the
sanctions could be eased if the May 7 elections are deemed to be
fair. But the officials have expressed pessimism that will be the
case.

   Prime Minister Anibal Cavaco Silva on
Saturday blamed extreme leftists for prompting demands by police
officers to form a union, news reports said. The demands provoked
violent clashes within the police force.
   Six policemen were arrested in the clashes Friday between riot
police and fellow officers demanding union rights. They were
released Saturday pending trial. About 100 uniformed officers
greeted the release with victory signs and calls for further
protest.
   Riot police used water cannons, dogs and batons Friday against
protesting officers outside the Internal Affairs Ministry.
   As the riot escalated, civilians joined demonstrators in hurling
stones at the riot squad. Seventeen people were reported injured.
   ``Extremist forces, communist forces and some socialists were
behind the movements in the Public Security Police,'' Silva was
quoted by the national Lusa news agency as saying.
   Cavaco Silva's center-right Social Democratic government has not
granted union rights to uniformed police units, saying their
militarized status makes trade unions unconstitutional.
   Portugal's two major trade union federations, the
Communist-inspired General Confederation of Portuguese Workers and
the Socialist-led General Workers Union, called for a demonstration
Monday to protest the actions of the riot police.
   General Workers Union General Secretary Jose Torres Couto, also
a Socialist deputy in the National Assembly, said he would ask for
a parliamentary inquiry into Friday's riot and demanded the
resignation of Internal Affairs Minister Jose Antonio da Silveira
Godinho.

<DATELINE>MANAGUA, Nicaragua (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Daniel Ortega signed a law
Saturday that abolishes both prior censorship and the indefinite
closures of newspapers and radio stations.
   The new code does not authorize private television stations,
which had been sought by oppositon groups, but ``guarantees equal
access to social and political groups'' to government-run
television.
   The law was passed Friday by the National Assembly.
   Ortega signed it before before leaving on a two-week tour of 11
Western European nations to seek aid for his cash-strapped
Sandinista government.
   Ortega claimed the new law is one of the most progressive in
Latin America because it does not provide for fines or permanent
shutdowns of news outlets. But it does provide for temporary
suspensions.
   The president also said journalists work in greater security in
Nicaragua than in other Central American nations, and he mentioned
El Salvador, where he said they face ``systematic terrorism.''
   ``In other countries in the region, journalists, union leaders
and opposition politicians are assassinated,'' he told reporters
after signing the law.
   Major provisions of the new law include:
   _Penalties for disseminating information deemed contrary to the
interests of the state, for ``alterating'' government news
releases, communiques and other statements, and for the
``transmission, diffusion, publication or projection of injurious,
defamatory or false information.''
   _The Interior Ministry can order closures of up to four days and
can order offending broadcasters or publishers to issue
retractions, clarifications or corrections. Broadcasters and
publishers will have the right to a hearing before sanctions are
applied.
   _No prior censorship.
   Under the previous law, the government could require the news
media to submit copies of articles to the censor before publication
or broadcast. And the Interior Ministry could order the inderfinite
suspension of news media without a hearing.
   The main opposition newspaper La Prensa and the radion station
of the Nicaraguan Roman Catholic church were freequently shut down,
sometimes for months at a time, and could only reopen with
government approval.
   Ortega agreed at a meeting in February of the presidents of five
Central American countries to reform Nicaragua's press laws and
also the election code that will govern the general elections next
February.
   On Saturday Ortega said the four other Central American nations
have failed to live up to part of the agreement that he said
provided for producing a plan to dismantle the U.S.-backed
Nicaraguan rebels known as Contras.
   He accused the governments of Honduras, El Salvador, Guatemala
and Costa Rica of ``trying to toy with Nicaragua.''
   And Ortega again said the United States is trying to block
propects for peace in the region.
   The Bush administration on Friday extended a 4-year-old economic
embargo against Nicaragua, saying its leftist government poses ``an
unusual and extraordinary threat'' to U.S. security.
   On Tuesday, President Bush signed a measure that will provide
$49.8 million in humanitarian aid to the Contras, most of whom are
based in Honduras, until the Nicaraguan elections in February.
   Ortega said the U.S. government is ``throwing gasoline on the
fires'' of Central American conflicts.

<HEAD>Cleanup of Waste Water Continues From Louisiana Spill</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BAYOU SORREL, La. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Four pumps were used to empty the
remaining oil-tainted water from a disabled, leaking barge Saturday
and workers laid out absorbent pads to clean up the impurities that
spilled into Grand River.
   Officials said 10,000 gallons of the non-hazardous waste
material _ water with small percentages of oil and alcohol _
spilled into the river early Friday on a loading dock on the river
about 35 miles southwest of Baton Rouge.
   Earlier estimates had put the amount of the spill at 100,000
gallons or more.
   ``As of 10 a.m., they were pumping out the barge into vacuum
trucks,'' said Douglas Wootten, a marine science technician for the
Coast Guard. ``They were one behind another. As soon as one is
filled, another pulls up.''
   The spill occurred when a barge carrying 900,000 gallons of the
waste water from an Exxon plant in Houston buckled in the middle
while workers unloaded the waste into tanker trucks.
   There were initial fears for the fragile environment _ the site
of the spill is near a large marshland area _ and some fish died.
But authorities said the spill was quickly contained by booms and
the environmental damage would be minimal.
   ``They have booms in place and only a small amount of the
product went down river. It is being retrieved,'' Wootten said.
Absorbent pads have been put out to soak up the impurities in the
river, officials said.
   Gordon Vice, an employee at GSX Land Treatment, which was being
paid to dispose of the waste water, did not have the required
Merchant Marine certification for performing the work at the time
of the accident, said Coast Guard Chief Warrant Officer Larry Doss.
GSX is assuming responsibility for the cleanup, officials said.
   GSX spokesman Bobby Mayweather said Saturday afternoon that Vice
was at the site and unavailable for comment. A woman answering the
telephone at Vice's home in White Castle also said he was
unavailable.
   Exxon, which has been harshly criticized in the past month
because of the 10 million-gallon spill from an oil tanker that hit
a reef off Alaska, had no involvement in Friday's spill except that
one of its plants was the source of the waste water, officials said.
   ``Exxon is getting a bad rap on this,'' Wootten said. ``They had
nothing to do with the spill. They had just hired a company to haul
the product off. In fact, Exxon should be commended _ they have no
liability and they still sent a clean-up crew.''
   Wootten said the amount of the so-called ``slop water'' leaking
from the barge into the Grand River was very small.
   ``Drip, drip, drip, that's all it is,'' he said.
   Paul Dubois, a spokesman for the Palmer Co., owner of the barge,
said the water-alcohol mixture is used to wash out tanks and ships.
When it's dirty with oil residue, it becomes waste water, he said.
   Exxon estimated the water contained 3 percent oil and 7 percent
alcohol. The alcohol began evaporating after the spill.

   A U.S. Navy sailor puckered his way
through classical and popular tunes to become grand champion at the
16th Annual National Whistlers Convention on Saturday.
   Sean Lomak, 28, stationed at Pearl Harbor, had to get his
commanding officer's permission to fly from Hawaii for the event,
where he whistled a piece from the opera ``Carmen'' and a popular
tune from ``The Entertainer.''
   Lomak had never entered the national contest but had won awards
at the International Whistle-Off in Carson City, Nev., in the
classical category, said Allen DeHart, founder and director of
Saturday's event.
   Lomak will appear May 5 on the ``Tonight Show'' hosted by Johnny
Carson.
   Second place went to Yugo Conti of El Cerrito, Calif., who
whistled a classical oboe concerto and ``Sailing to Spain.''
   Amy Rose, 15, of Louisburg, who had won the children's national
championship earlier, took the teen-age division. Her classical
piece was the ``Blue Danube.''
   Terri Long, 12, of Louisburg won the children's category.
   Greg Smith of Raleigh was selected best supporting male whistler
for his renditions of ``Putting on the Top Hat'' and a selection
from the ``Nutcracker.'' Gwenneth Wagg of Philadelphia won the best
support female whistler award.
   Best supporting awards go to the contestants who are second
place among the whistlers, DeHart said.
   The whistlers ranged in age from 9-year-old Jeff Tillett of
Louisburg to 80-year-old Glenn Vivarette of Raleigh, DeHart said.
   The Lillian Williams award, presented to the outstanding
entertainer who is not a contestant, went to Robert Larson, 65, of
Minneapolis. Larson, a judge in this year's contest, was ineligible
to be a contestant because he has been an international champion,
DeHart said.

<HEAD>Panama Says Visa Requirement Aimed At U.S. Journalists</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RAFAEL CANDANEDO</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>PANAMA CITY, Panama (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Defense Forces said Saturday that
Panama's new visa requirement is designed to keep U.S. journalists
out of the country during the May 7 presidential election.
   Defense Forces spokesman Maj. Edgardo Lopez Grimaldo issued a
statement claiming the U.S. news media plan to denounce the
elections as fraudulent.
   It said the decision to require visas for U.S. citizens to visit
Panama is to prevent a ``disinformation'' campaign and not to hide
election fraud.
   ``The visa requirement is aimed at a strategy of crying fraud to
the four winds by representatives of the U.S. press,'' the
statement said.
   It added the U.S. media ``voluntarily or involuntarily,
innocently or maliciously, is playing the game of the State
Department and the U.S. Embassy in Panama.''
   State Department spokesman Richard Boucher said in Washington
Thursday that the visa requirement was an ``attempt to isolate the
electoral process'' from public scrutiny.
   Panamanian opposition leaders have invited hundreds of foreign
observers to monitor the May voting. They say they fear that the
Defense Forces, controlled by Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega, will fix
the vote in favor of Carlos Duque, the officially sanctioned
candidate.
   The opposition alliance seeking Noriega's ouster is supporting
Guillermo Endara.
   Noriega was indicted in February 1988 by two federal grand
juries in Florida that accused the Defense Forces commander of drug
trafficking.
   The United States imposed economic sanctions against Panama in
an unsuccessful effort to force Noriega to resign and leave Panama.
   The new visa requirement ended 43 years of easy entry into
Panama for U.S. citizens. Until Friday all they needed was a
tourist card.
   Now they must have a visa issued by a Panamanian consulate that
recognizes acting President Manuel Solis Palma. Most consulates do
not recognize Solis Palma.
   Instead they recognize Eric Arturo Delvalle, who was ousted by
the Noriega-dominated National Assembly when he tried to force
Noriega to step down after the U.S. drug indictments were issued.
   The United States still recognizes Delvalle as President.
   In Washington, the May 1 issue of US News &amp; World Report said
President Bush signed in February a secret intelligence directive
to provide more than $10 million in election aid to Noriega's
oppoents.
   The magazine attributed its report to unidentified sources and
quoted them as saying Bush personally lobbied the plan through
congressional intelligence committees and won approval for the CIA
to provide the money for printing, advertising, transportation and
communications to the general's opponents.
   White House spokeswoman Alixe Glen said Saturday she could not
``comment on intelligence matters.''
   She said the U.S. position remains opposed to Noriega but the
government does not back any candidates in the Panamanian election.
   ``Our position remains the same. We want to return democracy to
the Panamanian people,'' she said. ``It's the Panamanian people
that vote.''
   Earlier this month Bush extended the sanctions that include
restrictions on U.S. companies doing business in Panama, holds
assets of the Panamanian government in the United States and
prohibits tax payments by U.S. organizations to Panama.

<HEAD>Artificial Grass Celebrates First 25 Years</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   AstroTurf, the synthetic sod that makes
it possible to play football, baseball and other sports where grass
doesn't grow, had a 25th birthday party at the private school where
it all began.
   AstroTurf's silver anniversary was observed Friday at Moses
Brown School, the Quaker school where the prototype was installed
25 years ago as part of an effort to help city kids become more
physically fit.
   ``We had an idea that it would develop into something big,''
recalled the school's athletic director and football coach, Jerry
A. Zeoli, who oversaw the installation and was among the 20 to 30
people at Friday's celebration.
   AstroTurf has been installed in more than 500 locations in 32
countries, said AstroTurf Industries Inc. President Ed M. Milner.
   It wound up at Moses Brown because of a Ford Foundation study
showing urban children were less fit than their suburban
counterparts. In 1964, the foundation gave the school a grant to
test the artificial grass in its new field house.
   In developing the turf, Monsanto Co. studied traction, shock
absorbance, weather resistance, how balls rolled and bounced, and a
host of other factors, Milner said in a statement.
   Moses Brown used its nylon field for baseball, tennis, soccer
and lacrosse, Zeoli said. It also saw service in graduation
ceremonies and dances.
   ``You can clean it so easily, all you need is a vacuum
cleaner,'' Zeoli said.
   Zeoli figured AstroTurf might have some potential when in 1965
some officials from the Houston Astrodome journeyed north to have a
look at the nylon carpet because they just couldn't get real grass
to grow in their new domed stadium.
   The Texans decided on an improved version, and the synthetic
turf was subsequently named for the Astrodome. Artificial turf,
which costs less to maintain than the natural variety, is used
today in most professional football stadiums.
   AstroTurf is made from a nylon polymer, which is dyed green and
spun into a ribbon, then crimped to give it texture and knitted to
a tough backing.
   Moses Brown's prototype was far different from today's
AstroTurf, Zeoli said. Its backing was just one-sixteenth of an
inch thick, compared to as much as an inch today.
   ``I could run plays and it was ideal, but I couldn't
scrimmage,'' Zeoli recalled. ``Hitting the surface could probably
injure someone.''
   Some professional athletes have blamed injuries on AstroTurf,
saying the synthetic surface does not give the way natural turf
does.
   However, AstroTurf Industries' magazine, Turf Talk, quotes
several doctors as saying the product does not increase the risk of
football injuries.
   AstroTurf Industries was a subsidiary of Monsanto until February
1988, when it was sold to the West German company Balsam
Sportstattenbau of Steinhagen. The company remains based in Dalton,
Ga.
   As an anniversary gift, the company resurfaced the weight room
at Moses Brown with AstroTurf.
   Its old AstroTurf is still going strong. Three-fourths of the
prototype still covers the field house floor.

<HEAD>Pilot AIDS Study A Success, Officials Say</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PITTSBURGH (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   People responded with surprising frankness to
questions about sexual habits and drug use in a pilot study to
determine the prevalence of AIDS, suggesting a similar study could
succeed nationwide, U.S. health officials say.
   Of the 308 eligible residents approached in January and February
at their homes in Allegheny County, 263 _ or 85 percent _ agreed to
fill out a form containing questions about sexual habits and drug
use and to give a blood sample for the study, in exchange for $50.
   ``I'd call it a surprising success,'' said Peter Hurley, project
officer for the Atlanta-based Centers for Disease Control, which
commissioned the survey.
   The results were discussed Friday at a meeting of the Allegheny
County Health Department's Community Advisory Committee, which
approved the pilot study last fall.
   Still unanswered, researchers said, is whether people
participating in a survey are actually telling the truth about
their intimate habits, and whether a national survey could be done
at close to the original estimated cost of $25 million.
   Besides the Allegheny County study, a pilot survey is slated to
start this summer in Dallas. One in Washington, D.C., was scrapped
in August after community leaders complained it appeared to single
out blacks.
   The pilot studies are running about 20 percent over budget,
largely because of the effort required to quell community concern
about them, Hurley said.
   In Allegheny County, out of an original pool of 450 homes
randomly chosen for the survey, interviewers found 308 where a
person at home was aged between 18 and 54, the survey's target
ages. In all, 263 of the 308 people agreed to fill out a form and
give blood.
   Most residents said they agreed to take part because they wanted
to help research into acquired immune deficiency syndrome. Only 15
said the main reason was to get the $50 paid to everyone who
answered the 22 questions and gave a blood sample.
   AIDS tests were run on all of the blood samples, but county
health officials said they will not release the results. Even
survey participants were not given the results of their own blood
tests, but those worried about having been exposed to AIDS were
advised to contact their doctor or a health clinic.

<HEAD>Irish Militiamen, U.S. Businessman Arrested in Arms Delivery</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Three Protestant militiamen from Northern Ireland
and an American businessman were arrested in the delivery of
missile-launcher parts to a South African diplomat, a government
official said Saturday.
   The French official said the three militiamen belong to the
Ulster Defense Association, the largest paramilitary organization
in Northern Ireland.
   The arrests were made Friday at a Paris hotel four men were
delivering spare parts for the British-made Blowpipe
shoulder-carried missile launcher to Daniel Storm, a South African
diplomat, the official said, speaking on condition of anonymity.
   He said Storm, who is covered by diplomatic immunity, was
released but the other four were held for questioning at the
offices of the DST, France's counterespionage agency.
   There was no official announcement of the arrests.
   News reports identified the three militiamen as Noel Little, 40;
Samuel Quinn, 41; and James King, 50. The news agency Agence
France-Presse identified the American as 40-year-old Douglas
Bernhart.
   The agency said without providing details that Bernhart kept an
office in Geneva. However, his name was not listed in the Geneva
phone book or a local register of companies.
   French law permits police to hold suspects for questioning for
up to four days before they are charged with an offense.
   A duty officer at the Interior Ministry, which is responsible
for the counterespionage agency, said he could not comment on the
report.
   In Johannesburg, the Foreign Affairs department confirmed
Saturday that Storm was on the staff of the South African embassy
in Paris and said there would be an investigation of the case.
   The Paris newspaper Le Monde said it appeared the South Africans
hoped to copy the delivered parts to produce a similar
anti-aircraft missile of their own, possibly for export. It said
the spare parts apparently had been stolen but gave no details.
   None of the reports carried details of payments for the parts.
   In Belfast, a spokesman for the Royal Ulster Constablulary,
speaking on condition of anonymity, said a dummy Blowpipe missile
was stolen over the weekend of April 8-9 from a Territorial Army,
or national guard, base in Newtonards, County Down. He said the
security forces insist it had no working parts.
   There was no known evidence of a link between the discovery and
the arrests in France.
   The Blowpipe, sometimes compared to the U.S.-made Stinger
missile launcher, weighs about 45 pounds and fires 76mm guided
surface-to-air missiles.

<HEAD>President Says Capital Flight Damaging Honduras; Pleads For Money
Return</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By FREDDY CUEVAS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>TEGUCIGALPA, Honduras (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Jose Azcona Hoyo pleaded
Saturday with his countrymen to return their money to Honduras,
saying capital flight was crippling the economy.
   Azcona said more than $1 billion had left the country in the
last nine years, most of it deposited in U.S. banks.
   He blamed the capital flight on regional conflicts that plague
Central America.
   ``The uncertain panorama of Central America has badly damaged
Honduras, one of the few nations in the region which lives in
democracy and relative tranquility,'' Azcona said.
   There are no restrictions on the taking of capital out of
Honduras.
   Honduras is not involved in civil war, but neighbors such as El
Salvador, Guatemala and Nicaragua are, and Honduras has become a
haven for both refugees and guerrillas.
   Azcona said that the ``situation confronting the region provokes
fear and insecurity in local and foreign investors.''
   ``Because of this more than $1 billion has been deposited in
foreign bank accounts, specifically in the United States, by many
Hondurans in the last few years,'' he said.
   He said the majority of Honduran businessmen have bank accounts
in the United States of between $200,000 and $300,000.
   He spoke in an interview with Radio America, one of the main
networks in Honduras.
   ``If our compatriots would return only 25 percent of this
capital, which would be about $250 million, it would partially
solve the problems that confront Honduras,'' the president said.
   Honduras is ranked by many international organizations as one of
the poorest nations in the hemisphere. It suffers 30 percent
unemployment, a budget deficit of more than $300 million and an
inflation rate of 30 percent.

   Twins separated shortly after birth bridged more
than 30 years and 2,000 miles Saturday in the culmination of a
woman's decade-long search for the sister she never knew.
   Susan Muchlenbruch's efforts paid off last week when she finally
located her twin, Mary Ann McNew, living in a Seattle suburb. The
sisters met for the first time in nearly 35 years Saturday at
O'Hare International Airport.
   ``You don't know how happy we are,'' Ms. Muchlenbruch said,
crying and hugging her sister.
   ``We're going to catch up on all we've lost, all the years we've
missed together,'' said a tearful Ms. McNew. ``I had a feeling I
might have family out there, but I didn't know where.''
   The Rev. Earl Davis, of the nearby Wilmette Church of Christ,
said the congregation would pay for hotel accommodations for the
sisters for the weekend so they wouldn't have to stay in Ms.
Muchlenbruch's trailer home.
   ``This is probably the biggest thing that has ever happened in
(Ms. Muchlenbruch's) life,'' Davis said.
   Ms. McNew's adoptive mother, Gladys McNew, said her daughter was
``kind of a wreck for a whole week'' looking forward to the
three-day reunion at her sister's home in the Chicago suburb of
Northfield.
   ``She hasn't been able to eat, sleep or hardly work,'' Mrs.
McNew said in a telephone interview Saturday from Bellevue, Wash.
   The twins were born at Cook County Hospital almost 35 years ago.
Shortly afterward, their mother was institutionalized for emotional
problems, said Debbie Felt, supervisor of the missing persons
service for the Salvation Army, which helped Ms. Muchlenbruch with
her search after a decade of futile checking on her own.
   ``Their father tried to raise them on his own for the first
three months, couldn't handle it and had to put them up for
adoption,'' Ms. Felt said.
   Gladys McNew said she and her husband had wanted to adopt both
twins, but the Chicago adoption agency's policy was to divide twins.
   ``At that time, they did not want to put twins together ... and
they only gave us one,'' she said. ``I thought it was a cruel thing
to do.''
   For years, Mrs. McNew kept the secret from her daughter.
   ``Through the years I didn't say anything because I didn't want
her frustrated and looking for someone she couldn't find,'' she
said.
   When Mary turned 6, her family moved to Seattle.
   ``This one was a fluke case,'' said Ms. Felt. ``We didn't have
any leads except one, and we ended up sending just one letter.''
   The Salvation Army sent the letter to Ms. McNew, who is divorced
with a 14-year-old daughter.
   ``She waited all of two minutes before curiosity got the best of
her and she called her sister,'' Ms. Felt said.
   ``Every time I talk to them they're crying because they're so
happy,'' she said. ``They're so excited they can't think straight
anymore.''

   Comic actress Lucille Ball continued her
smooth recovery from open-heart surgery Saturday, and doctors were
considering moving her to another section of the intensive care
unit, a hospital spokesman said.
   ``She's recovering as well as a person can from something like
this,'' said spokesman Ron Wise at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center.
   The actress, who remained in serious condition, would stay in
the intensive care unit but was doing well enough that she might be
moved to an area for patients requiring less critical care, he said.
   The 77-year-old entertainer underwent emergency surgery Tuesday
to receive a transplanted piece of heart artery.
   Miss Ball, who has remained popular through decades of reruns of
the ``I Love Lucy Show,'' has been showered with cards, letters and
flowers from well-wishers during her recovery.

   Oklahomans on horseback and in wagons
Saturday re-enacted the mad rush that occurred a century ago when 2
million acres of Indian territory were opened to white settlement.
   Thousands watched as history buff Paul Ward fired a Colt pistol
and 150 yelling participants in costume rushed forward.
   With cowboy hats and other gear flying, they raced a half-mile,
where the winners were awarded stakes like those their ancestors
might have used to claim land in 1889.
   A few yards into the race, a woman was thrown from her horse.
She was taken away by ambulance, but emergency officials said they
didn't believe her injuries were serious.
   The re-enactment, a parade and the issuing of a commemorative
postcard were among hundreds of activities marking the 100th
anniversary of the land run, which was the first step in the
process that led to the creation of the state of Oklahoma in 1907.
   At noon on April 22, 1889, more than 40,000 settlers raced from
the borders of the 2 million-acre Unassigned Lands _ present-day
central Oklahoma, then Indian territory _ to claim 160-acre tracts
or town lots. The land had been opened to white settlement by
President Benjamin Harrison.
   Many Oklahomans trace their roots to that race for land, and the
centennial has been a focus of celebrations statewide. Some Indian
groups are participating; others have protested the festivities.
   ``We're in the ghetto while the people who stole our land are
enjoying prosperity,'' said Frances Wise, a member of the Tribal
Voices coalition.
   She said asking Indians to take part is like ``asking us to
dance on the graves of our people.''
   Many of the events took place in Guthrie, the old territorial
capital, and traffic on Interstate 35 into town was backed up for
about 10 miles Saturday afternoon.
   On the steps in front of Guthrie's Carnegie library, the U.S.
Postal Service issued the commemorative postcard as Gov. Henry
Bellmon, wearing a cowboy hat and a Western-style jacket, and other
dignitaries looked on.
   Speeches on the library steps delayed the start of the parade
past its scheduled noon start.
   Mayor James Weems got 65 floats and 18 marching bands rolling
around 12:15 p.m., drawing cheers from a crowd estimated at 50,000
as he said, ``We've waited 100 years for this, so let's start this
sucker.''
   Most of the settlers who flocked here in 1889 were immigrants,
former Civil War soldiers, blacks and farmers fleeing drought. They
also were opportunists, speculators and profiteers.
   Edmond author Stan Hoig, a retired Central State University
professor who has written 10 books on Oklahoma history, said the
land run proved to be unfair. At the time, many called the
unprecedented event ``Harrison's Hoss Race.''
   For some, the race was not to the swift but to the sneaky. The
``Sooners'' who got in sooner than everyone else and gave the state
its nickname evaded federal troops guarding the area's borders and
claimed choice parcels. Disputes over Sooner claims snarled the
courts for years.
   Those who staked claims for homesteads faced five years of hard
work to ``prove up'' their land and gain permanent ownership. Many
lived in houses constructed of sod cut from thickly matted soil
that had never felt a plow.
   Some gave up their claims only to try again at later land
openings in the Indian territory _ four more via runs, others by
lottery, allotment and sealed bids.
   Guthrie, swelled by settlers staking their claims, became the
territorial capital and was the state capital before Oklahoma City
took its place in 1910.

<HEAD>Judge Investigating Exchange Fraud Bars Two Ex-Ministers From Leaving
Country</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CARACAS, Venezuela (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A judge investigating allegations of
foreign-exchange fraud has issued an order barring two former
finance ministers from leaving the country, newspapers reported
Saturday.
   Congressman Carlos Tablante, whose accusations brought about the
investigation, has said the case involves overbilling and grants
for dollars for non-existent imports that could amount to more than
$4 billion.
   The alleged fraud occurred during the administration of
President Jaime Lusinchi of the Social Democratic Party, when there
was a preferential dollar exchange system.
   That system was abolished shortly after the Feb. 2 inauguration
of President Carlos Andres Perez, also a Social Democrat, who
succeeded Lusinchi.
   The preferential plan pegged the exchange at 14.50 bolivars per
dollar for some imports and foreign debt payments. When it was
eliminated, it left only the free market rate that ranged around 36
bolivars per dollar last month.
   Judge Luis La Riva's order issued Friday banned ex-finance
ministers Manuel Azpurua and Hector Hurtado from leaving Venezuela.
Also named in the prohibition order were former vice finance
minister Jorge Garcia Duque; Egdalia Bastardo, who had been the
director of Recadi, and an unspecified number of other people who
the judge did not identify.
   Recadi was the government agency, since abolished, that for six
years was in charge of granting the preferential exchange for
imports. Investigations by both La Riva and a congressional
committee are centered on Recadi.
   Azpurua was finance minister during the first three years of
Lusinchi's five-year administration. He was replaced by Hurtado,
who had previously served as minister of development.

   A goldfish was reunited with its
owner Saturday after a week few goldfish can claim to have survived.
   The six-inch red fantail suffered a close brush with death a
week ago when it fell from a motorcycle rider's knapsack onto a
busy highway, but was rescued by a passing motorist and
resuscitated at a nearby garage.
   Denise Warley, who was traveling in the opposite direction from
the motorcyclist, saw the newly purchased fish in its plastic bag
of water pop onto the Scalby Road in this seaside town on the
northeast coast of England.
   Mrs. Warley, 43, asked her husband to stop their car and ran
back along the road as cars drove over the bag and burst it,
leaving the goldfish high and dry.
   The fish slithered into the gutter and was gasping its last when
Mrs. Warley scooped it up in her hands, sprinted to a nearby garage
and plunged it into water from a watering can. Then the Warleys
took it home to share a tank with their own goldfish.
   ``When I picked him out of the gutter he looked in a state of
shock,'' the good Samaritan said. ``No wonder _ talk about the one
that got away, he must have more lives than a cat.''
   The story of the rescue appeared in a local newspaper and a pet
shop owner recognized the fish he had sold. By a stroke of luck,
the purchaser had left his name and address at the shop earlier
when he bought a puppy there.
   So after a week few of its peers would envy, the lucky red
fantail was safely handed over to his owner.

<TEXT>
   The governor on Saturday asked Alaskans to
observe five minutes of silence Sunday in remembrance of the way
things were before the Exxon Valdez oil spill fouled hundreds of
miles of pristine coastline.
   The Coast Guard and hundreds of volunteers, meanwhile, scrubbed
tar-like oil from beaches. Vice Admiral Clyde Robbins, the Coast
Guard's on-scene coordinator, said the USS Juneau and USS Fort
McHenry would join the effort as floating hotels.
   ``They (Exxon) asked me for them, subject to finding out what
the price is. I suspect they'll use them,'' said Robbins, adding
that he had been told the ships cost the U.S. government $150,000 a
day to operate.
   Exxon has asked to pay only the amount exceeding the
government's cost of operating the landing ships, which are both
based in San Diego, Robbins said. The cost issue will be settled at
the ``highest levels'' of government, he said.
   The Juneau, due in Valdez on Monday, can sleep 840 troops. The
Fort McHenry can sleep 500.
   Gov. Steve Cowper set the period of silence to mark the 30-day
anniversary of the grounding of the Exxon Valdez. The fully loaded
tanker struck a reef and spilled 10.1 million gallons of crude into
wildlife-rich Prince William Sound.
   In Cordova, a fishing community 40 miles from the accident,
organizers planned an afternoon of activities, including speeches,
displays of photographs and a children's mural depicting the
America's worst oil spill.
   ``We wanted the world to know how much we loved Prince William
Sound, how beautiful we think it is,'' said Belle Mickelson, who
coordinates commercial fisheries education programs at Cordova High
School.
   ``Maybe people will understand why we're so sad. ... Seeing
whales three feet away ... bears and fish swimming upstream'' are
experiences threatened by the spill, she said.
   Many fisherman have expressed frustration with Exxon and the
Coast Guard over the lack of progress since the March 24 accident.
They have been scooping oil with buckets.
   A makeshift fleet of 48 skimmer boats returned to their work
shortly after daylight Saturday. The oil is being taken to one of
five barges hired by Exxon to receive the recovered oil, which will
be reprocessed by the company.
   Low clouds and fog grounded observation and supply planes early
Saturday.
   The cleanup concentrated on sites where seals haul themselves
out of the water.
   Exxon spokesman Joe Tucker said 303,000 feet of boom had been
deployed to keep the 14 percent of the spill still at sea from
coating beaches.
   Less than a half-mile of beaches have been cleaned, while the
spill has touched beaches along more than 300 miles of the Kenai
Peninsula and Kodiak Island, the latter home to many brown bears
and the world's No. 1 fishing port.
   Robbins said that by midday Saturday the 425-foot Soviet skimmer
Vaidogubsky picked up about 10,000 gallons of oil at Gore Point,
the site of large pools of oil trapped by spectacular rock
outcroppings.
   The vessel arrived Wednesday but spent days testing its booms
and refueling. As of Saturday morning it had yet to scoop up any
oil.
   Alaska policymakers worried that the state's image has been at
least as sullied as the spectacular shoreline. Sen. Ted Stevens
called on Exxon to pay for a program to inspect Alsaska seafood and
certify its purity to ease consumer fears.
   ``There's indications of a fall-off in demand for Alaska
products,'' the Republican said. ``It's the largest problem I've
seen so far, and it could be overwhelming if not addressed.''
   Rep. Don Young, R-Alaska, and Rep. Curt Weldon, R-Pa., toured
oil-tainted shores with Interior Secretary Manuel Lujan Jr. and
said Friday they will introduce legislation to make one person _
probably the Coast Guard commandant _ responsible for spill
cleanups.

<HEAD>Coauthor of Book For `Chorus Line' Dies</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Prize-winning playwright and novelist James
Kirkwood, who co-wrote the book for the record-setting Broadway
musical ``A Chorus Line,'' has died of cancer.
   Kirkwood, who lived in Key West, Fla., died Friday in New York,
where he was hospitalized recently, said a friend, Arthur
Beckenstein.
   Although Kirkwood's age was listed as 58, he recently said he
was actually 64. ``As an actor, I got in the habit of lying about
my age,'' he said.
   In 1976, Kirkwood won a Tony Award and a Pulitzer Prize for ``A
Chorus Line,'' written with Nicholas Dante.
   ``A Chorus Line,'' which also won a Drama Critics Circle Award,
opened in 1975, logged its record 3,389th performance in 1983 and
remains the longest-running musical in Broadway history.
   Kirkwood also wrote plays including ``Unhealthy to Be
Unpleasant,'' produced on Broadway in 1966, and ``Legends,'' which
toured the country in 1986 and 1987 with Mary Martin and Carol
Channing.
   His books included ``P.S. Your Cat Is Dead!'' which he adapted
for the stage, and ``American Grotesque,'' a nonfiction work about
a conspiracy in the aftermath of the assassination of President
Kennedy.
   Shortly before he died, Kirkwood finished a book about his own
experiences called ``Diary of a Mad Playwright.''
   Kirkwood followed his actor-parents, Lila Lee and James Kirkwood
Sr., into show business at 14. He appeared in shows including
``Wonderful Town'' and ``Welcome Darlings'' and his motion picture
credits included ``Mommie Dearest'' and ``The Supernaturals.'' He
also served in the U.S. Coast Guard for three years.
   Kirkwood also was part of a comedy-satire team called Jim
Kirkwood and Lee Goodman, which performed in nightclubs around the
country and also had a radio show on WOR for several years.
   He is survived by a half-brother and a half-sister. A memorial
service is planned.

   Agriculture ministers in the European Economic
Community agreed Saturday to freeze most farm prices within its 12
nations to keep the farm budget at $33 billion.
   After a weeklong debate, the 12 EEC ministers agreed to keep
price supports generally at last year's levels. The biggest cut
will be made in guarantees to growers of citrus fruits, down 7.5
percent. Prices for sugar will drop by 2 percent, although the
community's executive commission had requested a 5 percent cut.
   A tax on the production of surplus milk will be reduced by 25
percent, a move that milk producers had supported.
   The EEC farm budget is more than 60 percent of the
organization's total budget.

<TEXT>
   About 200 firefighters contained most of
a brush fire Saturday that forced the evacuation of 200 homes when
it erupted the day before.
   Firefighters hampered by rough terrain completed 3{ miles, or 70
percent, of the five miles of fire line needed to contain the
blaze, said Dennis Neill, a fire information officer with the U.S.
Forest Service.
   No further evacuations were expected. ``We still have some
concerns about some of the subdivisions in the immediate area of
the fire,'' Neill said.
   The blaze flared up southwest of Monument around noon Friday. By
midafternoon, it could be seen miles away as it consumed grass,
scrub oak and ponderosa pine on private land and land in the Pike
National Forest about 20 miles north of Colorado Springs.
   Authorities ordered the evacuation of four subdivisions
containing 200 homes, but allowed people back into their homes
Friday night.
   The fire's cause was unknown, Neill said.
   ``This is an early fire for us,'' he said. ``It's a symptom of
the dry weather we've had for the last several years. We don't
normally expect these conditions until maybe June or July.''
   Higher-than-expected humidity and low winds helped firefighters
Saturday, Neill said.

   Howard University officials announced Saturday
that James E. Cheek, who has been president of the predominantly
black institution for 20 years, will retire in June.
   Cheek, 56, began at Howard in 1969, and his resignation is to
take effect June 30.
   The Washington Post quoted sources in Sunday's editions as
saying Cheek is expected to be nominated by President Bush to
become ambassador to the Republic of Cameroon.
   During his tenure, he was confronted with a number of student
protests similar to the one earlier this year when a three-day
takeover of the university administration building forced the
resignation of Republican National Committee Chairman Lee Atwater
from the university's board of trustees.
   Last week, students staged a rally on campus and held a
candlelight vigil outside Cheek's home, charging the university
hadn't complied with a March 9 agreement that ended the
anti-Atwater protests.
   Students also complained that financial aid and campus security
problems have yet to be resolved.

   Sailors aboard the USS Wisconsin, sister
ship to the USS Iowa where 47 men were killed last week in a gun
turret explosion, opened their ship Saturday to talk about their
pride in battleships and sense of loss.
   ``The one thing on our mind is the tragic loss of many of our
ex-shipmates,'' said Capt. Jerry M. Blesch, commander of the
Wisconsin. With only four battleships in the Navy, many aboard the
Iowa once served on the Wisconsin.
   ``These are all old ships,'' said Lt. Matt Schatzle, 25, of
Gulfport, Miss., who commands the three 16-inch guns of the
Wisconsin's turret No. 3. ``The crews have a connection with all
the old sailors who served on the same ships back in World War II.
... They do the same jobs, they face the same dangers.''
   An explosion ripped through the Iowa's No. 2 turret Wednesday
during gunnery exercises off Puerto Rico. The cause of the blast
was under investigation. The gun's 2,700-pound projectile is fired
by six 110-pound bags of black powder.
   At the time of the explosion, there were 58 men in the turret,
which extends six decks into the 887-foot ship. The 11 who survived
were all in the lowest deck, loading powder from the ship's forward
magazines, the Navy said.
   Navy teams that entered the turret immediately after the blast
found the No. 2 gun's breech open and undamaged, with the practice
projectile that the gun was to have fired still sitting there, The
New York Times reported in Sunday editions.
   This indicated that the explosion occurred as the six bags were
being loaded into the gun and before it was ready to fire, the
Times said, quoting unidentified sources who have seen initial
reports on the disaster.
   Navy gunnery officers have further narrowed their estimate of
the time of the explosion to the point when the bags were being
transferred from a powder hoist to the gun, the newspaper said.
They said the flame and gases released by the explosion, which
killed everyone in the upper part of the turret, also went down the
powder hoist to the lowest deck.
   The officers said that if the transfer of powder to the guns had
been complete, the hoist also would have been sealed off.
   Pentagon spokesman Jim Turner said Saturday he had no new
information on the investigation. The ship is expected to arrive at
its home port here on Sunday and a base memorial service is
scheduled for Monday with President Bush.
   Aboard the Wisconsin, a Texas sailor was undaunted.
   ``To me, this is the gunner's ultimate dream,'' said Gunner's
Mate 1st Class Billy Owens, pointing into the gun room filled with
the immense breech of the 16-inch gun.
   ``There is a big boom, rattle and shake when it goes off. I just
like hearing them go off. It's the ultimate experience. Little guns
go bang. The big ones boom,'' said the 29-year-old Corpus Christi
native.
   In the turret, conditions are cramped and the equipment old.
Maintenance, said the crew, is a daily ritual.
   ``One of the things about these guns is the pride they
instill,'' Schatzle said. ``Everything in the gun room is
mechanical; there are no computers. The men actually do things.
They can take apart the equipment like a car. They get dirty. It's
a hands-on job, and it's something that the gunners are proud of.
... It's a team and team effort.''
   ``It has brought home the fact that it is a dangerous occupation
and that things can go wrong and will go wrong in the future,''
Blesch said. A Kentucky native, he compared gun duty to coal
mining, where cave-ins and injuries occur.
   Critics have argued that the battleships are too old _
especially the 16-inch guns _ to be effective, something Blesch
disputed.
   ``These are magnificent ships. The Iowa withstood the turret
blast and today is steaming to port, essentially battle ready. What
other ship could?'' he asked.

   Wayne State University officials called for an
end Saturday to the 10-day occupation of a campus building by
students protesting the school's treatment of blacks.
   The students conducting a so-called ``study-in'' at the Helen
Newberry Joy Student Services Center did not respond to the
request, which was the first made by the university, said Wayne
State spokesman Vernon Foss. Later that night, school officials met
with the students.
   As many as 100 students initially occupied the building April
12, but only 40 or 50 were there Saturday night, said a campus
policeman who refused to give his name.
   Foss said the request was part of what the university called its
``last, best offer'' in several days of negotiations with the
students.
   The proposal included an offer of amnesty that would stay in
effect until Saturday night's session was concluded. University
officials, however, had no plans to ask campus or Detroit police to
remove the students, Foss said.
   The university has agreed to 13 of the students' 17 demands,
including granting department status to the Center for Black
Studies. Administators said they would ask the Board of Governors
to establish the department by September.
   Saturday night's meeting was held to address the four unresolved
demands: increased recruitment of black students, reinstatement of
money cut from the black studies center's budget over the past 10
years, increased financial aid for blacks and more black faculty.
   The occupied building contains offices that handle financial
aid, registration, student records and other student services.

   Public library officials seeking ways to
meet a budget crunch didn't have to look further than their
basement, where they found an authentic copy of Lincoln's
Emancipation Proclamation hidden in a junk pile.
   Trustees of Ashfield's small public library were meeting in the
basement worrying over whether state and federal grants would come
through when they stumbled across the copy, said trustee Maurice
Isserman, a professor of history at Mount Holyoke College in South
Hadley.
   ``Somebody said we could sell those old prints over there in the
corner,'' he said. ``I walked over and looked at one and it wasn't
a print, it was a document and I looked down at the bottom and
there was Abraham Lincoln's signature.
   ``I took it to a local appraiser who introduced me to the world
of Lincolnia sales. He told us we had a valuable document and I
called up Sothebys,'' Isserman said.
   The document was one of 48 copies made in 1864, signed by
Lincoln and Secretary of State William Seward, experts at Sotheby's
auction house in New York told library trustees.
   The document will be auctioned next fall and is expected to
fetch at least $70,000, just about equal to what the library needs
to finish renovations, Isserman said.
   ``It was like a providential finding,'' he said.
   Library officials believe the document was given to the library
years ago by a man named George William Curtis, a friend of
Lincoln's and one of the founders of the Ashfield Library
Association.

<HEAD>Control Room Flood Knocks Out Pumps At Nuclear Power Plant</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Thousands of gallons of water
flooded a control room at the River Bend nuclear power plant,
knocking out pumps that help cool the reactor, a Nuclear Regulatory
Commission spokesman said Saturday.
   The plant had been shut down for about three weeks for refueling
and maintenance when the accident occurred shortly after midnight
Wednesday, said Bill Benedetto, spokesman for plant owner Gulf
State Utilities.
   The reactor core's temperature never exceeded 95 degrees, there
were no injuries and the pumps were working again within 10 minutes
of the accident, Benedetto said.
   A federal investigative team arrived Friday to look into the
accident, said NRC spokesman Joe Gilliland.
   According to Gilliland, a maintenance crew had been fixing a
6-inch water pipe in the plant's auxiliary building, which houses
pumps and control centers. Workers used seals to block water to the
section the crew was working on, but the seals failed and about
15,000 gallons poured out.
   The pipe carries water used to cool various plant equipment, but
not the reactor itself, Gilliland said. The water that spilled was
not radioactive.
   However, the flood shorted out electrical equipment running the
pumps that cool the reactor and powering lights in several parts of
the plant, Benedetto said.
   He said the work that caused the spill would not have been
performed if the reactor had been operating.
   The inspection team's report should be completed in about three
weeks, about the same amount of time River Bend is to remain shut
down, Gilliland said.
   River Bend is about 25 miles northwest of Baton Rouge, and has
been in operation since 1985.

<HEAD>Australian Scientist Claims To Expose Major Fossil Fraud</HEAD>

<DATELINE>SYDNEY, Australia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An Australian scientist has charged an
influential Indian scholar faked the fossil history of India and
the Himalayas in what he called one of biggest paleontological
frauds of all time.
   ``It's a massive fabric of disinformation liberally poured into
a 25-year period without anyone blowing the whistle,'' said John
Talent, an associate professor in earth sciences at Sydney's
Macquarie University.
   Talent accused prominent Indian geologist Viswa Jit Gupta of
building his career on a ``warped, twisted, tangled'' web of
disinformation.
   Gupta, a geologist at the Panjab University in Chandigarh,
India, was quoted in The New York Times Sunday as saying Talent was
lying about him. He said Talent's charges were ``far from the
truth'' and the product of ``malicious bias and professional
jealousy.''
   Talent, in an interview Thursday with The Associated Press, said
Gupta had invented fictitious fossils and had rewritten the
geological history of northern India. He said Gupta based his
writings on specimens ``that could be bought in fossil shops, and
were often picked up in the United States, parts of Europe, China
and elsewhere.''
   He said Gupta had reported discovering a ``huge number'' of
fossils in remote areas of the Himalayas, which because of the high
mountain range is accessible to few scientists.
   He contended that most of the specimens were ``common laboratory
rocks.''
   Talent's findings were published Thursday in the respected
British journal Nature.
   Talent said Gupta had published about 400 scientific papers and
several major texts on the geology of the Indian Subcontinent.
   He said academics from around the world had collaborated on the
papers, which were readily accepted by leading international
journals.
   The Sydney Morning Herald newspaper, in an earlier interview,
said Talent estimated that about 60 scientists had ``unwittingly
been drawn into the fraud by agreeing to examine specimens and
co-author papers.''
   Talent said he first became suspicious of Gupta's research in
1971 because of a research paper on tiny marine fossils called
graptolites, which he reported came from a site in Kashmir.
   After visiting the site, Talent said, he discovered ``to my
amazement, you could never find graptolites or any kind of fossils
there because the site was so mashed up.''
   ``I became intrigued at the results that Gupta was putting into
the literature,'' he said. ``I intially believed that the fraud
would collapse under its own weight.
   ``It reached a point that there was so much misinformation that
it was getting difficult to place our own work and that of our
colleagues in context.''
   Gupta told the Times he had invited Talent to visit his
laboratory in Chandigarh and the fossil sites that were in dispute,
but Talent declined. Talent told the newspaper he had not been able
to fit such visits into his schedule, and was calling for an
investigation by a panel of scientists.

   About 200 people, including seriously ill
patients who said medical research with animals had saved their
lives, rallied Saturday at Northwestern University in support of
such research.
   The rally by students, faculty members and pro-research
demonstrators came after a rash of protests and death threats
against biomedical researchers at the university in this suburb
north of Chicago.
   University President Arnold Weber told demonstrators the
university would not be intimidated by recent acts of vandalism
against university buildings, including spray-painted death threats
against faculty members.
   Animal rights groups have denied any connection with the threats
and vandalism.
   Seriously ill demonstrators said research using animals is their
only only hope for a cure, and claimed that foes are jeopardizing
medical progress.
   ``We need to look at the human side of it, and realize what
would happen if animal rights activists got their way,'' said Steve
Carroll, national executive director of the Incurably Ill for
Animal Research, a group he said has 2,500 members nationwide.
   Carroll, 37, was severely burned over 50 percent of his body in
an airplane accident and suffers from chronic osteomyelitis, a
painful bone infection he said can be treated thanks to tests on
animals.
   ``I am a person whose life was saved by animal research,'' he
said. ``There's no way I can express how grateful I am this
research was done.
   ``Painkillers that allowed me to keep my sanity were developed
on animals,'' Carroll said. ``We wouldn't have coronary bypass
surgery, be able to remove cateracts, or have joint implants for
arthritis victims'' without the research.
   Carroll was joined by about a dozen other patients who have
illnesses for which there is not yet a cure, including diabetics,
cancer survivors and two children with congenital heart defects.
   Two parents also spoke at the rally, contending that their
children would not be alive if it weren't for medical progress made
through animal testing.
   A member of Concerned Citizens for Ethical Research, a group
opposed to animal testing, said he was outraged by what he called a
distortion of the issue.
   ``They paint a picture trying to say that animal rights
activists are hurting medical progress,'' said Steve Davis. ``Just
because something has been done in the past, or is legal, doesn't
mean that it's right.''
   The Concerned Citizens group has targeted five scientists in
recent weeks, pressuring them to discontinue their research.
   The group contends Northwestern researchers starve monkeys and
stick electrodes and needles in cats' eyes. Researchers counter
that the animals are anesthetized and feel no pain.

<TEXT>
   In a fiscal ruse that authorities
hoped would help them track Ramon Salcido, police persuaded Wells
Fargo Bank to extend unlimited credit to the accused mass killer.
   The automatic teller machines effectively were deputized to help
catch the man accused of killing his wife, two of his daughters,
his mother-in-law and her two daughters, and a winery co-worker.
Salcido fled to Mexico, where he was captured and deported back to
California late Thursday.
   Salcido was reported to have run out of bank funds last week
while on a cocaine-and-alcohol binge that friends said preceded the
slaughter.
   The Sonoma County sheriff's office arranged with the bank to
track Salcido through any transactions he made with his automatic
teller (ATM) card and instructed bank tellers that his credit line
was wide open, Sheriff Dick Michaelsen said
   Wells Fargo spokeswoman Lisa Hoogerwef said the bank gladly
cooperated with authorities, adding that Salcido tried to use an
automatic teller card at least once at a Wells Fargo branch in San
Rafael on Friday at 9:24 a.m., and possibly again later in San
Francisco while heading for Mexico.
   Investigators said the killings occurred that day between 7 a.m.
and 10 a.m.
   Salcido also bought some clothes with his bank card at the Ross
Dress for Less Store in San Rafael Friday morning.
   ``The debate was (whether or not) you give him open credit. ...
We were worried about the safety of our tellers.'' said Hoogerwef.
   ``We did not want to do anything to set him off,'' agreed Ron
Renfro, the bank's security manager.
   Renfro said as word of the crimes spread, it became more
credible that Salcido would not chance going into a bank where he
might be recognized and would try to use the ATM to get cash.
   Michaelsen said with the bank's cooperation, the department was
able to bypass a court request for permission to tap in to
Salcido's account.
   The sheriff said the bank cooperated because they were in ``hot
pursuit'' and ``lives were in danger.''
   ``I am very proud. I think we did an excellent job,'' said
Michaelsen. ``It was excellent police work. It (his arrest) was not
just a fluke.''

   Three men, two dressed as women, fled
from a Sydney bank Friday after a swindle attempt failed but all
three were captured, one at the scene and two following a car
chase, police reported.
   They said a detective was struck and injured by the suspects'
Mercedes during the chase.
   Officials said two of the suspects were charged with attempted
murder and the third with driving in a dangerous manner. The three,
who were not identified, were jailed pending a court hearing.
   Police gave this account:
   Three men attempted to carry out a credit-card fraud at the
Advance Bank in downtown Sydney shortly after 3 p.m.
   When police responded to an alarm from the bank one man sprayed
officers with mace but he was overpowered.
   His two accomplices, wearing women's clothes, fled in a
limousine and led police cruisers on a chase through central
Sydney, colliding with seven other cars and allegedly hitting a
detective before they were stopped in nearby Darlinghurst.
   The detective was reported in satisfactory condition at Sydney
Hospital.

<HEAD>Northwest Pilots Urged to Settle to Attract `Friendly' Takeover Bid</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TONY KENNEDY</BYLINE>

   Friendly investors could help Northwest
Airlines defend itself from a hostile takeover bid if the carrier's
5,000 pilots quickly agree to a contract, according to a management
letter made public Friday.
   ``Frankly, there are alternatives available to us from friendly
investors,'' Chairman Steven Rothmeier said in the letter, which
was sent to pilots of the nation's fourth-largest airline on
Thursday.
   ``The absence of a pilot contract keeps the patient money
away,'' the letter said. ``But it does nothing to scare away the
highly leveraged money from those investors who don't really care
because if they can't make the airline work, they just break it
up.''
   The letter was released to the media after stock in Northwest
parent NWA Inc. closed at $102.50 on the New York Stock Exchange,
up $3.75 from Thursday's close.
   The stock price reflects a belief on Wall Street that there will
be a bid higher than billionaire Marvin Davis' current $2.7
billion, or $90-a-share, hostile tender offer.
   Calls to the Twin Cities headquarters of the Air Line Pilots
Association went unanswered Friday night. Pilots have been working
under two separate contracts since Northwest acquired Republic
Airlines in the fall of 1986. One of the key sticking points in
negotiations is merging the airlines' seniority lists. Both
contracts have expired.
   ``We are prepared and willing to negotiate around the clock to
reach an agreement,'' Rothmeier wrote. ``We are in a fluid
situation that can change, quite literally, from hour to hour.''
   According to testimony in a lawsuit filed by Northwest against
Davis, representatives for Davis have been in contact with labor
leaders at Northwest, including the pilots union. A judge has
issued a temporary restraining order prohibiting Davis from
``disrupting'' the contract talks, but the order does not forbid
``nondisruptive'' communication.
   Davis aides have said they want to establish an ``open
dialogue'' with the pilots. Davis himself has said he does not
intend to break up the airline by selling strategic assets to pay
takeover debt.

   President Bush is reportedly planning to
recommend a mix of single-warhead Midgetman and multiple warhead MX
missiles in a budget decision that will determine the future of the
nation's nuclear arsenal.
   A White House source, who declined to be identified, said Friday
that Bush's decision was ``expected to be some kind of mix of rail
garrison MX and Midgetman, but the final mix is to be determined.''
   The decision represents a setback for Defense Secretary Dick
Cheney, who reportedly favored deploying only one mobile missile,
the 10-warhead MX. Bush was supposed to make a final decision this
weekend and inform Cheney.
   Cheney had urged Bush to remove the nation's 50 MX missiles from
their concrete silos and put them on railroad cars to be shuttled
around the country _ an option known as the rail garrison MX. He
reportedly wanted to cut off funding for the truck-mobile Midgetman.

   The first half of fiscal 1989 ended with a
budget deficit that is running 7.4 percent ahead of last year's,
according to the government's latest report on its financial
situation.
   For the first six months of the 1989 fiscal year, which began
Oct. 1, the budget deficit totaled $128.43 billion, up from the
$119.61 billion shortfall posted in the first six months of last
year, the Treasury Department said Friday.
   The Bush administration is estimating this year's deficit will
total $163.3 billion, up 5.3 percent from the $155.1 billion
shortfall posted in for all of fiscal 1988. Under the Gramm-Rudman
deficit-reduction law, this year's deficit was not supposed to
exceed $146 billion.
   The administration and congressional leaders last week unveiled
a compromise plan designed to reduce the deficit in the next fiscal
year to $99.4 billion, just within the $100 billion target for
fiscal 1990 established under Gramm-Rudman.

   A judge said a jury's passion led it to give
Rock Hudson's lover an excessive $21.7 million in a landmark AIDS
lawsuit, and he slashed the award to $5.5 million.
   ``It's still a big award,'' said Marc Christian, 35, who was
reached by telephone Friday after Superior Court Judge Bruce
Geernaert's decision.
   Christian had sued the late actor's estate contending Hudson
should have told Christian he had the deadly and contagious disease.
   During the trial, Christian, a former bartender, testified in
sometimes lurid detail that he continued to have sex unwittingly
with Hudson for months after the actor was diagnosed with AIDS.

   The wave of rioting that has swept Jordan
ended an era of remarkable calm in the kingdom and exposed
troubling cracks in the foundation of this strategic Arab country.
   After more than a year of steady economic deterioration,
relatively modest price increases imposed April 16 snapped the
patience of many Jordanians.
   ``It was the straw that broke the camel's back,'' said a teacher
in the southern city of Kerak, one of the flashpoints. Like most
people in the tense cities, he refused to be quoted by name.
   The army moved quickly to contain the rioting, but the economic

   Communist rebels claimed
responsibility Saturday for killing a U.S. Army colonel who advised
this country's military, and officials fearing more attacks
bolstered security for U.S. forces.
   Philippine troops near the six U.S. military installations in
the country were reinforced and put on maximum alert immediately
after Col. James ``Nick'' Rowe was slain Friday, according to Gen.
Renato de Villa, the Philippine army's chief of staff. Rowe's
Filipino driver was wounded.
   Communist assassins in a stolen car sprayed Rowe's vehicle with
bullets while he was on his way to work in suburban Quezon City.
The killers escaped.
   The 51-year-old Rowe, who was a prisoner of war in Vietnam,
served as chief of the ground forces division of the Joint
U.S.-Military Advisory Group, which provides training and
logistical support to the Philippine military.

   House Speaker Jim Wright's intervention with
federal S&amp;L regulators on behalf of Texas businessmen did not
strictly violate ethical standards, according to the House ethics
committee, but its report provides an inside peek at how truly
hard-ball politics is played in the nation's capital.
   Wright, according to a report by the ethics panel's general
counsel, put a ``hold'' on a bill in late 1986 to provide
regulators $15 billion through special fees on the industry to
close the most critically insolvent savings and loan institutions,
many of them in Texas.
   During the same period, Wright was meeting with officials of the
Federal Home Loan Bank Board, which regulates the thrift industry,
on behalf of four Texas businessmen _ two of them Democratic Party
fund-raisers _ deeply embroiled in the S&amp;L crisis.
   Despite split votes by the ethics committee clearing Wright of
specific violations of House rules in those meetings, special
counsel Richard Phelan concluded Wright exercised ``undue
influence'' in two of the cases and in trying to get two of the
Bank Board's toughest regulators fired.

   Soviet defense spending rose 3 percent last
year, despite President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's promises to cut his
military budget, according to an intelligence report released
Saturday.
   But the study, prepared jointly by the CIA and the Pentagon's
Defense Intelligence Agency, also said Gorbachev was laying the
groundwork for his proposed 14.2 percent cut in defense spending.
   The study said chopping military spending so sharply would
require the Soviets to reduce their armed forces by more than the
500,000-troop reduction announced by Gorbachev last December,
meaning further cutbacks in the Soviet military.
   The newly declassified report painted a grim overall picture of
the Soviet economy. It said Gorbachev had been forced to slow the
pace of his economic reforms and to delay such key steps as
allowing the market to set wholesale and retail prices.

   In their place are minimum- and medium-security prisoners,

   Many company bosses duck investor salvos at annual meetings, but
Warren Buffett likely will bask in shareholder adulation because
he's enriched them for the 24th year.
   Buffett, one of the world's wealthiest people, is chairman of
Berkshire Hathaway Inc., a $6 billion conglomerate with interests
that include an encyclopedia, a homespun candy maker, an Omaha
furniture mart, a giant insurance company and investments in Coca
Cola Co., Capital Cities ABC Inc., the Washington Post Co. and
Salomon Brothers Inc., among others.
   Folksy, charming and unconventional, the 57-year-old investor
wows shareholders and stock analysts with a pithy annual report he
writes himself, filled with insights into what he considers good
and bad in his business and the economy in general.
   It's earned him the nickname, ``Oracle of Omaha.''
   This year, Buffett began the report with a 21-page letter to
shareholders, telling them the stock market is lousy, corporate
taxes are higher and the takeover business is getting expensive.
   Nonetheless, he wrote, Berkshire's management team gained $569
million in net worth for them in 1988, contributing to an average
net worth gain of 23 percent over the last 24 years. He also
proclaimed Berkshire had made a great investment in Borsheim's, a
flourishing Omaha jewelry business.
   ``We continue to concentrate our investments in a very few
companies that we try to understand well,'' Buffett wrote. ``There
are only a handful of businesses about which we have strong
long-term convictions. Therefore, when we find such a business, we
want to participate in a meaningful way. We agree with Mae West:
`Too much of a good thing can be wonderful.'''
   Buffett's report is a prelude to Berkshire Hathaway's annual
meeting, which he's holding Monday in Omaha, the company's
headquarters. He plans to make shareholders feel like they're at a
family reunion.
   ``After the meeting we will have several buses available to take
you to visit Mrs. B at the Nebraska Furniture Mart and Ike Friedman
at Borsheim's,'' Buffett wrote to the shareholders. ``Be prepared
for bargains.''
   The biggest bargain Berkshire Hathaway shareholders ever got was
buying the company's stock, which had a book value of about $20 a
share in the mid 1960s, when Buffett acquired what was then
Massachusetts cloth milling concern with $10 million in assets. Now
its book value is nearly $3,000 a share and it trades on the New
York Stock Exchange at nearly $5,900 a share.
   Berkshire Hathaway is considered such a gem that takeover
strategist T. Boone Pickens ranked it last month as among the top
20 of 1,000 big companies for what he called its commitment to
shareholders.
   Buffett's annual report is so widely followed that USA Today
said recently it ``runs a good chance of being the only one anyone
actually reads on or off Wall Street.''
   Verne McKenzie, Berkshire Hathaway's chief financial officer,
said the company is besieged with requests for the annual report
and shareholders flock like pilgrims to the annual meeting.
   ``People travel here from the far reaches of the country and the
world,'' he said.
   Richard A. Lewis, chairman of Corporate Annual Reports Inc., a
professional annual report publishing concern, gave high marks to
Buffett's yearly prognostications to shareholders, largely because
it showed he was honest and direct with fellow owners of the
company.
   ``Buffett is one of the four or five richest men in America,''
Lewis said. ``When he speaks, people listen. He uses his report to
say what he wants to say. He uses the report to underscore his own
investment principles and the keys to his success.''
   Nonetheless, Buffett is not universally admired. Sid Cato,
publisher of a monthly newsletter on annual reports based in
Waukesha, Wis., ranked Berkshire Hathaway's as one of the 10 worst
last year, largely because of what he called Buffett's inflated ego.
   ``I wrote, `Mr. Buffett, you're starting to get on my nerves
already, enough already,'' Cato said.
   Asked if he'd seen this year's annual report, Cato said, ``No,
he has not seen fit to send me a copy.''
