   The garden of Prague's baroque
Lobkowicz Palace that houses the West German embassy once was the
envy of neighboring diplomats.
   But the clipped lawns have been churned to mud by the pacing of
thousands of East Germans who invested their last hope in
emigration to the West.
   As the last refugees left the embassy compound, the grounds and
the street outside looked like a battlefield.
   The refuse of hope and anxiety lay scattered inside and outside
the fence that for thousands of East Germans marked the ``iron
curtain'' dividing the Communist east from the free West.
   For those inside, journalists recording the event were for a
long time their only contact with the outside world and their only
source of information.
   ``What do they think about us in West Germany,'' I was asked
daily. ``Are you reporting on us? Are you writing about us?''
Ringed off in their corner of the West, in the heart of the
Communist East, many were concerned they had been forgotten.
   Uncertainty and anxiety marked their daily routine. And waiting.
Waiting 4 or 5 hours to use one of the two toilets available for
several thousand people. Waiting to take a shower, waiting for a
bed to become free so one could sleep.
   ``It's worth it,'' they said. ``We want to reach the West.''
   When I arrived in Prague nearly two weeks ago, the balmy summer
weather had just come to an abrupt end. A cold rain pelted down
through the night, soaking the ground.
   The tents were so overcrowded that many of the men were forced
to sleep in the open in army sleeping bags. They cut open cardboard
boxes and spread them on the ground to try to keep out some of the
damp.
   In those first days, the refugees would talk, telling of the
lives they left behind, but more anxious to hear about life in West
Germany, trying to divine a picture of the future.
   ``Is there work in West Germany?'' ``How high is the
unemployment?'' ``How much does an apartment cost?''
   Many were initially mistrustful, fearful I could be a member of
the East German secret police.
   One small boy, hanging constantly on his father's hand was
fascinated by my boots, for him a symbol of the West he had seen on
TV. ``Are those real cowboy boots?'' he asked each time he saw me.
``Can I see them?''
   There were stunning scenes of compassion.
   One rainy dawn a young woman and her mother came up to the
embassy's main door. The daughter originally was from East Berlin,
but now lives in Munich, West Germany.
   Her mother wept and clung to her as she ushered her gently
toward the entrance.
   ``Mother, you must go in,'' the daughter pleaded. ``I can't go
with you.'' Then she added. ``I feel as though I were sending you
to an orphanage.''
   As she turned to leave, she told us her mother had been
imprisoned for five years for attempting to leave the country
illegally.
   One man asked me to call his wife in West Germany whom he had
not seen for over a year. She had thought he was going to try to
swim across the Danube river to Hungary from where East Germans can
legally cross to the West. He didn't want her to worry.
   Prague residents, who at first seemed indifferent to the
refugees, gradually became interested in their plight, coming to
the embassy with chocolate for the children, and passing out hot
tea to those sitting out in the cold.
   As the East Germans began boarding buses to take them to the
train station Wednesday night, crowds of Czechoslovaks gathered to
applaud them and wave them off.
   As workers begin to clean up the embassy garden and the streets
outside, remnants poignantly recalled the drama that marked the few
days the refugees spent there.
   At the edge of the fence, a broken baby carriage, a single
abandoned shoe, recalled the panic of two days earlier, when
hundreds of East Germans, desperate to be included in the exodus,
stormed police barricades and clambered over the fence to join more
than 4,000 others.
   Gripped by panic that they could be left behind, many scaled the
building's ornate facade, climbing through the windows, or jumping
from the top of the 6-foot-high fence.
   Mothers and fathers lifted their babies over the fence placing
them in the hands of strangers, the panic of separation written on
their faces for the eternal moments before they themselves
clambered over to join them, unsure if police would move in to stop
them.
   The abandoned East German Trabant and Wartburg cars are being
removed from the streets to a parking lot. Many of the East Germans
simply left the cars and threw away the keys as the trains pulled
out of the Prague station.

<HEAD>Bush Defends Non-Intervention in Panama</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RITA BEAMISH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Bush is defending his decision not
to intervene militarily to help overthrow Panama's Gen. Manuel
Antonio Noriega, while his aides try to quash criticism that the
administration operated in confusion during the failed coup.
   But the president said Friday that his inaction should not be
read as a signal that he would act the same way if another attempt
is made by Panamanians.
   ``I would not rule out any option,'' he told reporters when
asked if he would send in the military next time.
   Bush said that after reviewing information about the coup, he
believes he was right not to unleash U.S. forces stationed in the
South American nation.
   ``I'm not being stubborn, but as I look at all the information I
wouldn't have made a different decision then,'' Bush said.
   But questions and criticisms from Capitol Hill, and even some
administration officials, persisted as to whether it would have
been wiser to help the insurgents in the Panamanian Defense Forces
who tried to topple the dictator.
   Bush explained his position during a closed-door meeting with
Senate Republicans, and later talked to reporters about the matter
outside Walter Reed Army Medical Center, where he had a cyst
removed from his finger.
   ``We were willing to use force but not ... unless we know the
circumstances and have better information,'' presidential spokesman
Marlin Fitzwater said Bush told senators.
   Sen. Sam Nunn, chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee,
charged Friday that a lack of clear policy guidance from Bush was
largely responsible for U.S. confusion. There should have been
definite arrangements for how U.S. troops were to react in the
event of a coup, he said.
   ``We have had a definite, longstanding policy in this country of
encouraging a coup'' in Panama, the Georgia Democrat told
reporters. ``We should anticipate that our policy ... might
succeed. Then we have to know what we're going to do next.''
   Defense Secretary Dick Cheney and Gen. Colin Powell, chairman of
the Joint Chiefs of Staff, testified in closed session before the
Senate Intelligence and Armed Services committees, which are
reviewing discrepancies surrounding U.S. involvement with the coup,
contact with its participants and advance notice.
   Sen. John Warner, R-Va., said both insisted they ``would not
have changed their decision and recommendations to the president.''
   A senior administration official, however, has said there are
things the administration should have handled differently.
   Bush said the decision not to use force was made because ``it
wasn't warranted under the existing circumstances.''
   ``The commander-in-chief must have the lives of American
citizens foremost in mind when making such a decision,'' he said.
   Bush and Fitzwater disputed the assertion of Sen. Jesse Helms,
R-N.C., that the rebels wanted to turn Noriega over to the United
States.
   The president said he still wants to see Noriega removed from
power, but ``there was never a chance to have him handed over to
us.''
   Fitzwater, trying to clarify other conflicting reports, reversed
his earlier statement that U.S. officials had not been in direct
contact in advance with any coup leaders.
   He confirmed that U.S. representatives had been in touch before
Tuesday with coup leader Maj. Moises Giroldi, who is believed dead.
Giroldi, Fitzwater said, told the representatives Sunday that the
coup would occur.
   Earlier, Fitzwater had said that advance word had come through a
third party.
   Fitzwater emphatically denied a Wall Street Journal report that
Giroldi's wife had tried to alert U.S. officials about the coup
three weeks ago.
   Fitzwater also told reporters:
   _A cable transmitted to Washington by U.S. military officials in
Panama incorrectly stated that the rebels wanted the United States
to take custody of Noriega. Fitzwater said the cable should have
said the rebels ``won't'' let the U.S. have custody.
   But he said it was irrelevant to Bush's decisions, because the
incorrect cable didn't reach the White House.
   _Despite early suspicions that Giroldi might actually be
operating a ``set up'' instead of a real coup effort, U.S.
officials now believe he was sincere.
   _Disputing a Wall Street Journal report, Fitzwater denied that
the rebels had ever asked the United States to deploy a helicopter
to take Noriega into custody.

<HEAD>Weapons Plant Said to Have Allowed Dangerous Accumulations of Plutonium</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT BURNS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Independent investigators say in a highly
critical report that there were dangerous amounts of plutonium in
uncontrolled conditions at the Rocky Flats nuclear weapons plant,
but that there was no evidence of an accidental nuclear reaction.
   ``This is at least the seventh report I've received from the
Department of Energy in the last three years that says Rocky Flats
suffers from lax safety attitudes ... and that also admits things
just aren't improving,'' said Rep. David Skaggs, D-Colo., whose
district includes the 364-acre plant near Golden.
   The inspectors said in a report on safety conditions at the
plant that many changes are needed to improve controls on plutonium
used to shape triggers for nuclear warheads.
   Friday's report said that while no evidence was found that an
accidental nuclear reaction had ever occurred at Rocky Flats, there
is a ``real possibility'' of such a disaster because the plant
operator doesn't properly control all its plutonium.
   An accidental reaction would produce a lethal dose of radiation
to workers.
   The study conducted between July and September by Scientech
Inc., an engineering and management company based in Idaho Falls,
Idaho, said there had been ``about eight'' serious violations of
plutonium safety procedures at Rocky Flats since 1962.
   Those incidents lefts an unacceptable margin of safety, the
report said.
   Skaggs said the report was further evidence that problems at
Rocky Flats are getting worse.
   The FBI has been investigating possible environmental violations
at Rocky Flats since June and a special grand jury has been
impaneled in Denver to consider the case.
   Rocky Flats reprocesses plutonium in retired nuclear weapons to
make triggers for new warheads. The facility is owned by the Energy
Department and run under a government contract by Rockwell
International Corp., which earlier this month said it would quit
the plant soon. The new contractor will be EG&amp;G Inc.
   The investigators said they discovered several kilograms of
plutonium-239 in a pipe that serves as an exhaust ventilation duct
in a plutonium processing building. It was found ``outside the
normal envelope used to control'' plutonium inventories, and the
quantity was ``more than enough'' for an accidental reaction.
   Before the investigation, plant managers ``had insisted that
this type of plutonium accumulation was not happening,'' even
though a former employee had warned of the possibility, the report
said.
   Even so, the investigators said the material posed ``no
immediate danger to public or worker safety.''
   The report added, however, that the investigators found
indications that there may be undiscovered accumulations of
significant amounts of plutonium in several other exhaust ducts at
Rocky Flats. No other details on that were provided.
   The report said a former Rockwell employee who designed the
ventilation system, James Stone, had warned Rockwell that the ducts
were ``a probable location for dangerous quantities of plutonium to
collect.''
   Despite the warning, Rockwell didn't identify and correct
plutonium accumulations in ventilation systems, the report said.
   The investigators also said plant workers who provided anonymous
tips on where to look for unsafe conditions were afraid to raise
their concerns to their supervisors.
   Energy Secretary James D. Watkins ordered the investigation in
response to reports that manmade radioactive elements found at
Rocky Flats might have been formed by an inadvertent nuclear
reaction. There is no nuclear reactor at the plant, so speculation
had centered on the possibility of a chain reaction caused by
accumulations of plutonium.
   An appendix to the report said that since the start of the
nuclear age in the early 1940s, 35 accidental nuclear reactions had
occurred worldwide, and that seven such accidents had occurred
between 1958 and 1978 at unidentified U.S. nuclear processing
facilities.
   The seven U.S. accidents resulted in two deaths and 19
significant overexposures of workers but ``virtually no exposure''
to the public, the report said.

   Demonstrators blocked entrances to a federal
building on Friday, demanding that the government do more to fight
AIDS. Eighty protesters were arrested and five officers slightly
injured, authorities said.
   In San Francisco, at least 20 other demonstrators were arrested
in the city's predominantly gay Castro District after marching
there from a rally at the Federal Building two miles away.
   The protesters took over the intersection of Market and Castro
streets to demand a better coordinated national battle against
AIDS. They briefly struggled with dozens of police in riot gear,
according to broadcast reports. Police officials did not
immediately release information about the arrests.
   The Los Angeles demonstrators, numbering from 300 to 400,
carried placards and shouted, chanted and whistled as they
converged on the Federal Building shortly after dawn.
   Those arrested were charged with trespassing for blocking the
entrances to the building, said Mike Larson of the General Services
Administration.
   Seven demonstrators were also cited for resisting arrest and one
was arrested for investigation of assaulting a Federal Protective
Service Police officer after spitting in an officer's face, Larson
said.
   The injured officers suffered cuts and bruises, Larson said.
   Wendell Jones, a spokesman for AIDS Coalition to Unleash
Power-Los Angeles, accused the police of using excessive force.
   ``The police would take their knees and shove them into the
protesters' backs for no reason, except to inflict pain,'' he said.
   ``I have no reports of that,'' Larson said.
   Chip Suntheimer of Act Up-LA said the demonstrators were
demanding quicker release to the public of experimental drugs to
fight AIDS, establishment of an emergency program to wipe out AIDS,
an end to AIDS-related discrimination and quality health care for
all AIDS sufferers, including poor people and members of minority
groups.

<HEAD>Shamir Asks Baker To Set Up Talks on Palestinian Delegation</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BARRY SCHWEID</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Diplomatic Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir,
offering assurances that Israel's peace plan is ``very alive,'' is
asking the Bush administration to help break a deadlock over
Mideast negotiations.
   Shamir made the move Friday after the Israeli cabinet rejected
by tie vote a Labor Party proposal to meet with Egypt on the touchy
issue of which Palestinian Arabs should participate in negotiations.
   The prime minister said Israel ``had not closed the door on the
peace process.'' In fact, Shamir said, ``the Israeli peace
initiative is very alive.''
   Shamir's request for U.S. diplomatic intervention was aired in
an interview with Israel television and elaborated in discussions
between U.S. and Israeli officials.
   He called on Secretary of State James A. Baker III to set up
talks with Egypt and Israel on the composition of a Palestinian
delegation.
   Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak proposed last month that two
Palestinians deported by Israel during disorders on the West Bank
and in Gaza should be included. Shamir and his supporters objected.
   A U.S. official who demanded anonymity said Baker was
considering Shamir's request, as well as other ways to set up
Israeli-Palestinian negotiations. The official insisted the peace
process was not at a dead end.
   ``We are working hard, and we are hopeful,'' he said.
   Baker spoke by telephone with Israeli Foreign Minister Moshe
Arens and Egyptian Foreign Minister Esmet Abdel-Meguid after the
cabinet vote.
   U.S. officials said the cabinet had not dealt with other issues
surrounding the negotiations and that the discussion was expected
to resume next week in Jerusalem.
   Baker, meanwhile, looked for openings for compromise.
   State Department spokesman Richard Boucher insisted Israel had
not rejected Mubarak's 10-point proposal.
   ``Our view is that the Israeli cabinet has held a full
discussion and neither accepted nor rejected the Egyptian ideas,''
he said.
   Mubarak had proposed the negotiations in Cairo between an
Israeli delegation and Palestinians, including the two deportees.
Deputy Prime Minister Shimon Peres and Defense Minister Yitzhak
Rabin, leading members of the Labor party, approved.
   Mubarak's approach would require Israel to concede in advance
that it should relinquish territory on the West Bank and in Gaza as
a basis for gaining peace with the Arabs. Again, Peres and Rabin
agreed.
   The Egyptian leader put his proposal forward after the Palestine
Liberation Organization declined to endorse a plan by Shamir to
hold elections among the 1.4 million Palestinian Arabs who live in
the territories.
   After Baker met last week in New York with Arens and
Abdel-Meguid, he called on the Israeli cabinet to decide how to
``move forward'' on the Shamir proposal. Otherwise, Baker said at a
news conference Friday, ``We will have to go back to the drawing
board.''
   But after the deadlock, U.S. officials said there was no reason
to start anew and that Baker would seek an accommodation between
the Shamir and Mubarak plans.
   ``Any conclusion that it's over because it didn't happen today
is just not right,'' Boucher said. ``I don't think the secretary
put any time limit on this.''
   Baker, he said, was not planning to go to the Middle East.
   Baker endorsed the Shamir plan after it was adopted by the
Israeli cabinet in May. He has also praised the 10 points unveiled
by Mubarak last month, but said they were no substitute for
Shamir's proposal.
   On a related subject, Boucher confirmed reports that Robert
Pelletreau Jr., the U.S. ambassador to Tunisia, recently held two
additional meetings with a PLO official. However, he declined to
disclose what they talked about.
   The PLO news agency, WAFA, said the meetings concerned ``the
efforts under way and the positions of the different concerned
parties to realize a net gain in the peace process.''
   Pelletreau has been meeting in Carthage with PLO officials since
December. The State Department has given only skimpy reports of the
sessions.

   Aer Lingus Airlines agreed Friday to plead guilty

   According to a two-count criminal information, the carrier's

   Aer Lingus, the national airline of Ireland, could have faced a
maximum $2 million fine if convicted of both charges.
   The plea agreement must be approved by U.S. District Judge
Stanley Marcus at an Oct. 25 sentencing hearing.
   U.S. Attorney Dexter Lehtinen said that between 1981 and 1987,
Aer Lingus illegally transported parts for Lockheed C-130 aircraft
for use by the Iranian air force, despite a ban on such trade by
the U.S. government.
   A second count says that Aer Lingus transported Boeing parts to
Iran Air, a commercial airline.

<TEXT>
   Pope John Paul II arrived in South
Korea Saturday to begin a 10-day pilgrimage to Asia that is
expected to focus on human rights and Catholic-Moslem relations.
   The pope's special Alitalia Boeing 747 landed in South Korea
after leaving Rome's Leonardo da Vinci airport and making a brief
refueling stop in Venice.
   In a sign of vastly improved Vatican-Soviet relations, the
Kremlin approved a flight plan that allowed the papal plane to fly
over the Soviet Union. China barred a papal overflight.
   The Asian trip, the 44th foreign pilgrimage of John Paul's
11-year papacy, raises several politically sensitive topics for the
pope.
   In Seoul, the pope is scheduled to address a religious meeting
that has taken up the issue of eventual reunification of North and
South Korea.
   His next stop is overwhelmingly Moslem Indonesia and a stop in
East Timor, a heavily Catholic island annexed by Indonesia after
its invasion of 1975.
   John Paul will also make a two-day stop in the Indian Ocean
island nation of Mauritius before returning to Rome Oct. 16.
   South Korean police and intelligence agencies were placed on top
alert for the pope's visit, his second to the country following a
major tour in 1984. National Police Headquarters in Seoul said a
special watch was being maintained for members of the ``Gray
Wolves,'' identified as an ultra-rightist Turkish underground group.
   In 1981, a Turkish man alleged to be a member of the Gray Wolves
shot the pope in St. Peter's Square.
   The pope came to address the closing of the 44th International
Eucharistic Congress, which has included discussions about eventual
reunification of North and South Korea.
   The Seoul government is extremely wary about efforts to reunite
the two Koreas, which are technically at war since no peace treaty
was signed at the end of the Korean War in 1953. On Thursday, a
dissident pastor who made a secret trip to North Korea for
reunification talks was sentenced to 10 years in prison for aiding
an enemy power.
   Church officials say a small group of Catholics from North Korea
were invited for the papal visit but are not expected to be allowed
to attend by their Communist government.
   In an article published Thursday by the Vatican newspaper
L'Osservatore Romano, South Korean Cardinal Stephen Kim described
the division of Korea as ``a symbol of a divided world that so
ardently desires peace and reconciliation.''
   After Seoul, the pope will spend five days touring Indonesia.
While the scope of the visit is to meet with the tiny minority of 5
million Catholics in the population of 175 million, John Paul is
expected to stress the need for good relations between Moslems and
Christians.
   The Indonesian stop has been clouded by a fury over East Timor.
   This week, Portuguese President Mario Soares called Indonesia
``dictatorial'' and accused the Indonesian government of
persecuting East Timor's Catholic population.
   ``I hope that his Holiness will carry the message he's always
carrying in defense of the oppressed and the victims of
persecution,'' Soares said.
   The Vatican has not recognized East Timor's annexation, and the
bishop of Timor is directly under the jurisdiction of the Vatican
and not a member of the Indonesian Bishops Conference.
   The Vatican newspaper said John Paul wanted to make the stop,
scheduled for only half a day, to comfort Catholics so ``harshly
tested.''

   Some of the jurors thought the most
stimulating part of Sousa vs. Pensacola Christian College was the
cookbook they wrote during the trial.
   It was the perfect recipe for combatting the tedium of a recent
civil trial that dragged on for four weeks, with jurors often
leaving the courtroom while attorneys argued details.
   ``Every time there was an objection, there would be a 15 to
20-minute delay,'' juror Linda Kinchen said. ``And we couldn't talk
about the case, so we started talking about food.''
   The jurors began reading recipes in magazines and then brought
in recipes from home to share. Some even brought in samples of
their favorite dish.
   Eventually they started writing out their recipes in longhand
and categorizing them into groups such as appetizers, main dishes,
salads or desserts.
   The jury for the civil fraud case decided to call their book
``Courtroom Cooks 'n Crooks (We Steal Recipes).''
   Circuit Court Judge Robert Makemson was given a copy of the book
at the end of the trial.
   ``They probably got tired of talking about their grandchildren
so they thought of this,'' Makemson said. ``More power to them.''

<TEXT>
   The government has granted the
longstanding demand of black trade unions to have a public holiday
on May 1, the international labor day.
   The decision, announced Friday, came after years of government
resistence.
   Black workers have staged widespread strikes on May Day in
recent years to press their demand for a holiday, and they rejected
a compromise move by the government two years ago to have a
``Workers Day'' holiday on the first Friday in May.
   ``Certain groups of persons object to May 1 as a public holiday
by virtue of its association with the socialistic and communistic
ideology,'' said Manpower Minister Eli Louw. ``However, the recent
past has clearly shown that its association with socialism is
becoming irrelevant because of the economic failure of that
ideology.''
   The holiday will be called Workers' Day, Louw said.
   South Africa's largest employer organization, the Association of
Chambers of Commerce and Industry said the change removed ``an
issue of contention ... that has been extremely disruptive to
business.''

   The 300-strong labor union stopped work at 4 a.m., leaving
Manila's Ninoy Aquino International Airport without navigational
aid and limited communication facilities, said airport manager
Eduardo Carrascoso.
   At least 60 domestic flights had been canceled and there were no
incoming flights, he said. Only three international flights were
able to take off.
   Carrascoso said the workers, who make $178 a month, were
demanding a $13.70 pay increase to match the salaries of air
traffic controllers. He said officials were negotiating with union
leaders.

<HEAD>Tipster Says Affair May Be Behind Rogers Van Bombing, Newspaper Reports</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: Subs 10th graf, `Marxmiller, 48...' to CORRECT Marxmiller's

<DATELINE>SAN DIEGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A man who says he was questioned by the FBI in
the bombing of a van belonging to the former captain of the USS
Vincennes alleges an extramarital affair may be behind the attack,
The San Diego Tribune reported Friday.
   George Marxmiller said he told the FBI shortly after the March
10 bombing that Capt. Will Rogers had been having a three-year
affair with a woman in Kensington, Md., a suburb of Washington,
D.C., the newspaper reported.
   The FBI declined comment on the case and the Rogers' attorney
called the allegations ``irresponsible'' and ``wrong.''
   Rogers' wife, Sharon, narrowly escaped injury when she jumped
out of the Toyota minivan when a pipe bomb exploded under it at an
intersection in La Jolla. The FBI initially focused its
investigation on a possible terrorist attack.
   Both The San Diego Union and the Los Angeles Times reported
earlier this week that federal investigators think someone with a
grudge against the former skipper, and not revenge-minded
terrorists, may have been behind the bombing.
   On Monday, the Union quoted an anonymous Navy official as saying
the focus of the investigation had switched to a U.S. citizen who
has a personal vendetta against Rogers.
   The day before, the Times quoted four unidentified sources as
saying the probe was now on the personal vendetta theory. The FBI,
however, has said it hasn't ruled out the possibility that the
bombing could be a terrorist attack.
   Will Rogers was the captain of the Vincennes in July 1988 when
it shot down an Iranian jetliner over the Persian Gulf, killing all
290 aboard. Rogers later was exonerated on the grounds he had
reason to believe his ship was to be attacked by a fighter.
   He has since taken another assignment away from the Vincennes.
   Marxmiller, 48, of Buckhead, Ga., said he knew of Rogers' affair
because the 42-year-old Kensington woman was a best friend of his
estranged wife, Rebecca, the newspaper said. The names of Will
Rogers and the Kensington woman are among a list of names of
potential witnesses in Rebecca Marxmiller's divorce suit against
her husband, according to the Times, which did not name the woman.
   Rogers' attorney, Pat Shea, told The Associated Press that
Rogers only met the Marxmillers once several years ago and that
Rogers didn't know why he was being sought as a witness in their
divorce.
   ``The innuendo that you can draw from George Marxmiller's
comments pointing in anyway at Capt. Rogers are way off base. They
are irresponsible and they are wrong,'' Shea said.
   Rebecca Marxmiller released a statement through her attorney
Friday, saying that her husband is trying to discredit a third
person who may be a witness at their divorce trial.
   Marxmiller told the Tribune that he and his wife spent a weekend
in Portland, Ore., in 1987 with Will Rogers and the woman during a
rose festival. The Vincennes was docked in Portland at the time.
   The newspaper said two of its reporters saw photos of Rogers,
the Kensington woman and the Marxmillers. One shows Rogers and the
woman with their arms around each other and the Vincennes in the
background. Another shows her hugging Rogers from behind.
   Marxmiller told the Tribune that many of his friends have been
questioned by federal agents and that the home of his brother, Tom,
in the Los Angeles area was searched by FBI agents earlier this
week.
   Marxmiller's wife of 22 years demanded a divorce last year.
Marxmiller, who said he is a pilot for Eastern Airlines, said he
became emotionally upset and decided not to fly for three months.
   Eastern Airlines then went on strike and his income fell to
almost nothing, he said.

   The White House and Senate Democrats are close
to an agreement that would speed work on a deficit-reduction bill
and guarantee a quick, separate vote on President Bush's coveted
capital gains tax cut.
   Leaders of both parties culminated a day of meetings among
themselves and administration officials Friday by announcing they
had all but agreed to weed dozens of special-interest provisions _
including the capital gains proposal _ out of a budget-cutting
measure.
   Senate leaders planned to meet with their House counterparts
today to nail down a final hurdle.
   Bush and his GOP allies wanted House assurances that that
chamber, which approved its own capital gains cut this week, would
agree to work out a compromise with the Senate.
   ``I think we're pretty close to an agreement,'' Senate Finance
Committee Chairman Lloyd Bentsen, D-Texas, told reporters.
   Early Friday, Bush had journeyed to Capitol Hill to discuss the
offers and counter-offers and to voice his continued support for
paring back capital gains tax rates.
   ``Capital gains is vital,'' he said before the meeting. ``It's
not an extraneous matter with me.''
   The agreement was spurred by a desire by both parties to avoid
an approaching budget embarrassment: automatic spending cuts that
otherwise most likely be triggered Oct. 16 by the Gramm-Rudman
deficit-reduction law.
   Under that law, unless the projected deficit for fiscal 1990,
which began Sunday, is reduced to $110 billion, defense and many
domestic programs will automatically be cut. To obey that budget
ceiling, the deficit-reduction bill will have to be passed.
   But the legislation has collected many provisions that have
little to do with reducing the government's red ink and a lot to do
with helping various interest groups.
   Dozens were tacked on by the Senate Finance Committee at a
late-night session this week, including a $685-million, five-year
tax benefit for some natural gas producers, and a $25 million tax
break for owners of tuxedo rental shops.
   In addition, advocates of reducing the capital gains tax had
planned to try to add their proposal to the budget-cutting measure.
That and the other extraneous provisions promised to make quick
completion of the bill all but impossible.
   Bentsen agreed to drop his own proposal to restore Individual
Retirement Account benefits from the bill if the capital gains
effort was also abandoned.
   The House approved its own version of the deficit-reduction bill
Thursday on a 333-91 vote, a measure that included a temporary
reduction in capital gains tax rates.
   Capital gains are profits from the sale of investments, and are
now taxed at the same rates as other income.
   Under the House-passed bill, the top rate of 33 percent would be
cut to 19.6 percent until 1992, when it would be raised to 28
percent and ``indexed'' to avoid taxing gains arising solely from
inflation.
   Sen. Bob Packwood, R-Ore., has said he wants to lower the amount
of profits subject to the capital gains tax for property held for
long periods of time.

   A bill carrying approval of a unanimous Senate
would allow retirees to keep Medicare catastrophic insurance for
nearly unlimited hospital charges while repealing a surtax that has
threatened the entire program.
   ``Senior citizens will rest a little easier tonight knowing ...
that this body has acted in a sensible fashion,'' said Sen. John
McCain, R-Ariz., author of the bill to salvage parts of the program
but wipe out the surtax.
   Under the bill that cleared the Senate on a 99-0 vote Friday
night, Medicare recipients would lose protection against
catastrophic physicians' fees due to take effect next year and
coverage for prescription drugs that would have been available
starting in 1991.
   The Senate vote set up a confrontation with the House, which
voted 360-66 earlier in the week to repeal the program _ lock,
stock and especially surtax. Negotiators will have to work out a
compromise.
   That may not be easy. While the House favored repeal by a nearly
6-1 margin, senators rejected repeal on a 73-26 vote, a margin of
almost 3-1.
   Catastrophic coverage was enacted a year ago to help prevent a
serious illness from wiping out the finances of a retiree. The
program builds on Medicare.
   Almost as quickly as it became law _ with solid bipartisan
support _ the program came under fire from some of the very people
it was designed to help.
   Lawmakers say most of the complaints came from two groups of
retirees: those who already have coverage and those higher-income
people who must pay the surtax that finances two-thirds of the
program.
   The surtax is paid only by the 40 percent of retirees whose
incomes are high enough that they pay more than $150 federal income
tax. The surtax is 15 percent of the tax liability, up to a maximum
of $800 this year per retiree.
   McCain's bill would wipe out the surtax entirely. What is left
of the program would be financed by continuing the flat $4-a-month
premium that is paid by all but the poorest retirees. The premium
is scheduled to rise gradually to $10.20 a month by 1993.
   Should McCain's amendment become law, retirees would be left
with these benefits:
   _Coverage of unlimited hospital charges after paying the first
$560 a year.
   _Existing Medicare coverage of doctors' fees: 80 percent
reimbursement after the patient pays the first $75 each year.
   _Nursing-home benefits for up to 100 days for each ``spell of
illness'' after the patient spends at least three days in a
hospital. The patient would have to share expenses for 80 days.
   _Up to 38 days of home health care per year.
   _Miscellaneous coverage, including a provision to prevent
impoverishment of a spouse because of high medical bills; unlimited
hospice stays; limited mammography; and government payment of the
monthly premium for the poor.
   Republican Sens. William Roth of Delaware and John C. Danforth
of Missouri, who tried to repeal the program, said the elderly
would be better off giving up those limited benefits and the
government starting from scratch with a new national health policy.
   ``We promised too much, we taxed too much, but let's not throw
it all out,'' said Republican Leader Bob Dole of Kansas, adding
that would leave many low-income retirees with no insurance against
costs of an expensive illness and no way to buy it.
   Earlier, the Senate turned thumbs-down on a leadership-backed
plan that would have preserved most benefits as well as part of the
surtax.
   That 62-37 vote rejected an amendment by Sen. David Durenberger,
R-Minn., to retain almost total reimbursement for hospital charges
and, after the patient pays the first $1,780 a year, all doctors'
fees. Coverage for prescription drugs would have been eliminated.
   Hospital costs are rising by 5{ percent a year, doctors' fees by
15 percent, Durenberger said.
   ``That is the catastrophe waiting to happen to elderly
Americans,'' he said.
   The Senate rejected four other attempts to modify the
catastrophic program, including an amendment by Sens. Carl Levin,
D-Mich., and Tom Harkin, D-Iowa, that would have repealed the
surtax, kept the full benefits and raised income taxes on the
nation's 600,000 wealthiest taxpayers to finance the program.
   Sen. Spark Matsunaga, D-Hawaii, was the only member not voting
on either repeal or the McCain bill.

<HEAD>Nuclear-Powered Probe Is Safe, NASA Says</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   NASA says a nuclear-powered probe to be
launched from the space shuttle Atlantis next week does not pose a
threat, and would have withstood the Challenger explosion without
releasing deadly plutonium.
   ``This important mission can be undertaken safely,'' the
National Aeronautics and Space Administration said Friday in answer
to a lawsuit seeking to stop the Oct. 12 launch.
   The Florida Coalition for Peace and Justice and other
organizations opposed to the launch are trying to spread a tale of
horrors, but ``there is no evidence that these horrors will in fact
or are likely to occur,'' NASA told U.S. District Judge Oliver
Gasch in a brief.
   Gasch has scheduled oral arguments for Tuesday, two days before
Atlantis is to lift off from Kennedy Space Center carrying into
orbit a probe called Galileo.
   The probe has two 24.7-pound radioisotope thermoelectric
generators, known as RTGs, that create electricity for the long
journey. They are similar to those that powered the Voyager probe
as it swept past Neptune recently.
   The Florida group claims danger of plutonium contamination from
a shuttle disaster is far greater than the government has admitted.
But NASA said engineers determined that ``if the Galileo
spacecraft, its RTGs, and its attached booster rocket had been
aboard the Challenger in 1986, no plutonium would have been
released as a result of the accident.''
   NASA has spent $1.5 billion _ and expects to pay $400 million
more _ on the project, which will culminate in six years when the
craft begins orbiting Jupiter.
   ``In essence, plaintiffs do not like the launch decision and are
trying to get the court to second-guess the executive branch of the
government with regard to the acceptability of risk,'' said the
brief filed by Justice Department lawyer Stuart B. Schoenburg.
   Opponents warned that the possibilities of an accident and a
deadly plutonium release from Galileo are 1-in-350.
   NASA countered that exhaustive environmental impact studies
showed the most probable accident statistically would be failure of
the rocket that will propel the probe after it is released from the
shuttle cargo bay.
   Even if the two thermonuclear power plants re-entered Earth's
atmosphere, broke apart on hard rock and released plutonium, there
would be no additional cancer deaths over a 70-year period, NASA
said.
   Studies showed that even in this worst case, according to the
agency, the an individual have only a 1-in-100 million chance of
being hurt.
   The space probe's journey to Jupiter will be a complicated one,
involving one slingshot orbit of Venus and two of Earth to gain
momentum. NASA said the highest potential for human harm would be
if the craft crashed through the atmosphere when it makes its close
approach to Earth. The chances of that happening are 5-in-10
million, the brief said.
   ``Under this maximum case scenario, there is a 1-in-10 million
probability of 9.4 excess cancer fatalities worldwide over a
70-year period,'' NASA said, and the average individual risk would
be 1-in-25 billion.
   The space agency plans to begin the countdown Monday as
scheduled.

should do more to help the island.
   The wife of Vice President Dan Quayle planned to visit Gov.
Rafael Hernandez Colon and Federal Emergency Management Agency
offices in eastern Puerto Rico today before traveling to
hurricane-devastated St. Croix, southeast of Puerto Rico in the
U.S. Virgin Islands. Hugo caused an estimated $1.3 billion in
damages in Puerto Rico and killed 11 people.
   Britain's Princess Alexandra, meanwhile, toured destroyed
buildings and villages on the hurricane-battered British Caribbean
island of Montserrat on Friday before traveling to the neighboring
dependency of Anguilla.
   ``The rawness is a great shock,'' the princess, Queen Elizabeth
II's cousin, said in Plymouth, Montserrat. Pointing to the island's
once-lush green hillside trees, she said, ``It's almost as if
they've all had a shave.''
   The British government said 98 percent of the buildings on
Montserrat, population 12,000, were destroyed by Hugo on Sept. 17.
The storm killed 11 people and caused $120 million in damage on the
island.
   ``I am sure a lot of assistance will come to Montserrat,''
Alexandra said, promising upon her return to London to urge the
government to send more aid.

   President Bush will be wearing a splint on his
finger for a few weeks after a cyst that had become increasingly
bothersome was removed surgically, the White House says.
   ``All is well,'' Bush said as he emerged from Walter Reed Army
Medical Center on Friday. ``It was real minor,'' he told reporters
jovially as he brandished his right hand with a bandaged middle
finger.
   The White House said the 25-minute minor surgery was successful
and that the president should experience no long-term impairment.
Bush is left-handed.
   The president was given a local anesthetic for the operation and
was to be prescribed pain medication as needed. He was spending the
weekend at the presidential retreat at Camp David, Md.
   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said Bush had eight
stiches to close the 1{-inch incision and would wear a splint on
the finger for two to three weeks.
   Col. Allen Smith, chief of hand surgery at Walter Reed,
performed the operation and will visit the White House for a
follow-up exam Tuesday.
   White House physician Burton Lee said it appeared the cyst,
which was undergoing a pathological exam, was benign.
   Doctors had drained the cyst May 10 when Bush underwent a
routine physical examination. Physicians said the cyst had been
present for several years and did not pose a medical problem for
the 65-year-old president.

<HEAD>Rand McNally Omits North Dakota, South Dakota and Oklahoma From New

<TEXT>
   Gov. Henry Bellmon was not amused by his
state's absence from Rand McNally's newly published world atlas,
which also left out North and South Dakota.
   ``We are mystified,'' Bellmon said in a letter to Rand McNally.
``Did you intend an insult or are you trying to say that Oklahoma
is so well-known that travelers need no map to get here? The latter
seems more likely.''
   The letter was signed by the ``3.3 million citizens of the great
state of Oklahoma,'' Bellmon spokesman Sam Armstrong said Friday.
   Rand McNally officials said space limitations forced the
ommissions of the three states from the atlas, which features
colorful photographs of various regions of the world. But one
spokeswoman acknowledged the company may have blundered.
   The $34.95 Rand McNally Photographic World Atlas goes on sale
this month. North Dakota tourism director Jim Fuglie, however, said
he wasn't particularly miffed by the ommission.
   ``It's not like we missed the road atlas,'' Fuglie said. ``If
this was a book designed to reach ... the markets that we seek
tourists from, I would be very concerned.''
   Fuglie said the publication's managing editor told him 30,000
copies of the book are to be published.
   The atlas breaks the United States down into seven regions.
Photos from those regions are included, and accompanying maps show
at least a portion of 47 states.
   ``They did include several regions of the United States and
their portfolios, just kind of touching upon various places,'' said
Bonnie Ryan, a Rand McNally spokeswoman.
   Ryan said the omission was not intended as a deliberate affront
to the three states.
   ``In any case, I have been told that when they go back to print
next year, they're planning changes which include adding more maps
to the U.S.,'' she said.

<HEAD>HUD Auditors Question Rent Formulas; Allege More Favoritism</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN KING</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government is paying millions of dollars a
year in excessive housing subsidies because of errors in the way it
sets rents for the projects, HUD auditors say.
   The auditors said in a report obtained Friday that overpayments
by the Department of Housing and Urban Development could be as high
as $39.1 million for just the tiny sample of rent areas studied.
   They said they couldn't project their findings to estimate
potential nationwide overpayments because the sites selected for
the audit were not chosen randomly. But the report urged department
officials to revisit the formula and to give HUD's regional
economists a greater role in setting rents.
   A second audit, sent to Congress this week, raises fresh charges
of favoritism in awarding rent subsidies and says such conduct was
allowed because of poor program accountability. Mismanagement and
political favoritism are the key subjects of congressional
investigations of HUD during the Reagan administration.
   For the rent study, HUD's inspector general reviewed 142 of the
2,755 areas for which the department sets fair-market rents for
subsidized housing. The report said that in 116 of those areas the
government was paying $39.1 million a year in excessive subsidies.
   In a smattering of areas, the auditors said, HUD might be paying
too little.
   ``Increased efforts need to be made by HUD to ensure that the
department's (fair-market rents) realistically reflect prevailing
local market rents,'' the auditors said.
   Asked to comment, HUD issued a statement saying: ``While we have
every confidence in the way the fair market rents are computed we
welcome the suggestions from the inspector general's office and
want to work diligently with them to ensure that the system is
working properly.''
   The rents, which ultimately determine the amount of subsidies
HUD pays, are calculated through a formula that is supposed to
arrive at rents that are in line with similar, non-subsidized
apartments in the area, with the government rents perhaps slightly
higher to cover any rehabilitation costs.
   But the auditors said in some areas the fair-market rents set by
HUD are well above local market rents. For example, for all of
HUD's Region X _ Alaska, Washington, Oregon and Idaho _
overpayments were estimated between $12.9 million and $14.6 million
a year.
   The second audit, which dealt with the Section 8 program, found
that HUD did not advertise the availability of reserve funding at
the control of agency headquarters and that some of the subsidies
appeared to have been steered to specific housing agency and
developers.
   The auditors also said there was no documentation to support
seven subsidy awards, part of an overall problem of poor selection
guidelines and accountability.
   ``We believe that a commitment of federal funds of this
magnitude should require more than an informal process, i.e.,
documentation, criteria and rationale for the decisions,'' the
auditors wrote in the report, which was requested by the House
Banking Committee.
   The audit said $279 million was allocated from the reserve funds
for fiscal 1988 and 1989 and laid blame for the questionable
selection process on Thomas Demery, the former HUD assistant
secretary for housing.
   Demery, in comments included in the audit, said there had been
no formal system for awarding the money for more than a decade and
that he sought input from HUD's regional administrators before
making funding decisions.
   The new administration at HUD accepted the findings of that
audit without exception and has established written application
guidelines and ranking criteria for the program.

the general's enemies.
   A letter published Friday in the government newspaper Critica
said an unidentified businessman who made the offer presented the
letter to a columnist. It could not be confirmed.
   ``They (opponents) have allowed a price to be put on (Noriega's)
head, with dollars given to them by the United States,'' the letter
said. Therefore, ``we consider it justified to use our money to pay
those who execute traitors.''
   The six people threatened included former President Eric
Delvalle, who tried to fire Noriega last year and was dismissed,
and Col. Roberto Diaz Herrera, a former top commander who was among
the first to accuse Noriega of drug trafficking.
   ``We have international contacts and there will be no difficulty
in carrying out these sworn duties,'' said the letter addressed to
columnist Balatazar Renan Aizprua, who also is chief spokesman for
the state power authority.
   It said the ``nationalist'' businessman deposited the money in a
Swiss bank account. It did not elaborate.
   Armed men in civilian clothes invaded a radio station Friday
that broadcast a rebel communique against Noriega during Tuesday's
botched coup. They destroyed broadcast equipment and forced
employees to leave.
   Threats to Noriega's enemies and the attack on the radio station
came after the general, who blames the coup on the United States,
said he would get tough with opponents. In a speech Thursday,
Noriega said radio stations that were ``bought off'' would be
``torn down.''
   In Washington, President Bush defended his handling of the coup
attempt, saying there was no opportunity to seize Noriega and that
use of U.S. force ``wasn't warranted under the existing
circumstances.''
   Bush said he would not rule out any option in a future coup
attempt, including military intervention.
   The six people threatened in the letter to Critica include
former President Eric Delvalle, who tried to fire Noriega last year
and was dismissed, and Col. Roberto Diaz Herrera, a former top
commander who was among the first to accuse Noriega of drug
trafficking.
   Opposition leader Guillermo Endara continued a hunger strike
from the shelter of the papal nuncio's residence a day after he was
beaten and thrown out of his office by Noriega's soldiers.
   Endara's doctors examined him Friday and said he was in good
condition but could not talk to the press. He was in the 17th day
of a hunger strike to promote an opposition campaign against the
government.
   Endara launched his hunger strike as part of a campaign to
encourage Panamanians to delay tax payments and boycott government
lotteries and casinos.
   On television speech Thursday, Noriega ridiculed Endara's hunger
strike and said he had evidence the United States had planned to
install Endara as president.
   Endara was presidential candidate for an opposition coalition in
elections May 7. International observers said Endara's ticket beat
Noriega's candidate by a 3-1 margin, but Noriega had the election
annulled and appointed a provisional president.
   Noriega dominates Panama through his command of its police and
military, and the United States has been trying to oust him since
he was indicted on U.S. drug trafficking charges in February 1988.
   Noriega says the United States is trying to disavow treaties
that give his country control of the Panama Canal at the turn of
the century. He has withstood U.S. economic sanctions, elections
and two failed coups.
   In addition to Delvalle and Diaz Herrera, the businessmen's
letter threatened Juan B. Sosa, a former ambassador to the United
States, and Gabriel Lewis Galindo, Jose Isabel Blandon and Alberto
Garcia de Paredes _ all opponents of Noriega in exile.

<TEXT>
   Paramilitary groups and members of
the Defense Forces have stepped up harassment of foreign
journalists since the failed rebellion of a military unit Tuesday.
   Soldiers wielding sticks and rubbers hoses Thursday night
attacked journalists gathered in front of the building where
oppositon leader Guillermo Endara was conducting a hunger strike.
Endara was beaten and forced to leave the building.
   Military strongman Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega last year accused
foreign correspondents of being ``disinformers'' and blamed them
for the Panamanian government's bad image abroad.
   Since then, it has not been unusual for international
journalists to be detained for hours at a time, or to have film and
cameras confiscated without explanation.
   Government radio, newspapers and television accuse foreign
correspondents of being on the U.S. State Department's payroll.
   It is worse for the national press. Of the four main newspapers
in Panama City, three are government-owned. The director of the
only independently owned newspaper, La Estrella, is a friend of
Noriega's.
   The danger of running afoul of the regime was demonstrated by
the fate of Radio Exitosa, the only radio station to broadcast a
rebel communique during Tuesday's botched coup.
   On Thursday, Noriega said the United States had ``bought'' the
coup attempt and that radio stations in the pay of the U.S.
government should be destroyed. On Friday, the station was raided,
the employees driven off and its equipment destroyed.
   ``I try to keep a low profile,'' said a Panamanian reporter who
works for another station.
   Freedom of expression has suffered a ``big setback'' in Panama
this year, Manuel Jimenez, the president of the Inter-American
Press Association, said Friday in Monterrey, Mexico. He did not
elaborate, saying the issue would be discussed at next week's press
association convention in Monterrey.
   Thursday night's incidents began when men in civilian clothes
wielding guns and rubber hoses dispersed everyone in front of the
building where Endara was conducting his hunger strike.
   When journalists approached to ask questions the men pushed them
aside. Only one would talk, and all he would say was, ``Just get
out of here.''
   A typical attempt at intimidation involved beating the rubber
hoses on the sidewalk and yelling at journalists to scatter.
   When Endara's office was raided Thursday night, an Associated
Press photographer trying to take pictures was chased and beaten.
   ``Give us the camera,'' the soldiers shouted at photographer
John Hopper as they hit him with sticks. Hopper required seven
stitches to close a head cut, and the soldiers took his camera and
film.
   A cameraman for NBC News lost his video camera during Thursday
night's incident. A Japanese reporter said his car was taken.
   Some television journalists said they had to jump through
windows into private homes when they were chased by the soldiers.
   One U.S. correspondent said she and a photographer were forced
out of a taxi while covering the Endara incident.
   ``They forced us and the taxi driver out and they drove away
with the car,'' she said. Later two men dressed in fatigues rushed
her, grabbed her purse, spilled the contents on the ground and
demanded her car key.
   ``I convinced them I did not have a car, so they took $500,''
said the reporter.

<HEAD>EPA Issues Largest-Ever Toxic Waste Fine</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Environmental Protection Agency is fining
a California company $6.2 million for allegedly storing more toxic
wastes than it was authorized to handle.
   The civil penalty, the largest fine ever under federal toxic
waste disposal laws, was levied Friday against Casmalia Resources
of Casmalia, Calif., operator of a hazardous waste treatment,
storage and disposal facility.
   The EPA accused Casmalia Resources of ``accepting more hazardous
waste materials than its existing landfills were authorized to
handle.''
   The company also was charged with violating federal toxic waste
regulations because it improperly expanded its existing landfills
to accommodate additional wastes.
   EPA spokeswoman Robin Woods said the company must pay the fine
within 30 days or appeal.
   Before Friday's action, the largest penalty obtained by the EPA
for violation of the federal law governing toxic waste disposal was
$2.78 million last March against the Four County Landfill in
Rochester, Ind. That penalty came as a result of a federal judge's
ruling in a civil suit.

   President Bush made a little history by
walking on to the Senate floor for a few seconds.
   Senate associate historian Don Ritchie said there's no record of
any sitting president making an informal visit to the floor,
although presidents have given formal addresses in the Senate
chamber.
   Normally, presidents speak in the larger House chamber to a
joint session of Congress.
   Bush decided to visit the floor after private meetings with
Senate Republicans and Majority Leader George J. Mitchell, D-Maine.
He walked through the door to a round of applause from the handful
of senators on the floor and the mostly empty spectator gallery.
   The visit ended in less than a minute.
   Ritchie said Woodrow Wilson, Herbert Hoover, Richard Nixon and
Gerald Ford spoke in the Senate chamber during their presidencies.
Harry Truman and Ford visited the floor after their terms had ended.

   Computers tell a fighter pilot when
and where to drop his bombs, but the man at the controls still
pushes the ``pickle button'' that releases the explosives.
   At ``Gunsmoke '89,'' a kind of World Series for attack plane
pilots, top airmen show just how important the right stuff is when
it comes to bombing and strafing targets set up on a bleak desert
range.
   The competition for the coveted title of ``Top Gun'' is
unfolding this month during two weeks of daily competition in two
valleys 40 miles northwest of Las Vegas, on the sprawling Nellis
Air Force Base Bombing and Gunnery Range.
   As smoke billowed from dummy bombs crashing around an old tank
being used as a target Friday, Maj. Bud Williams explained the
drill to visiting reporters.
   The red ``pickle button'' that releases the bombs is just one of
the pilot's many concerns as he flashes 200 feet above the desert
floor at 400 miles an hour, pops up to 1,000 feet, then dives down
on a speck of a target.
   The pilot has to concentrate on the degree of the dive, the
location of the target, the speed of his plane, wind and other
factors.
   While focused on the target and the precise second to press the
button _ whose nickname is part of the arcane jargon of the flight
world _ the pilot must also ``fly stable so the radar can get an
accurate look at the target,'' Williams explained.
   A pilot's concentration on his target can prove deadly.
   ``We've had cases of pilots flying the craft into the ground,''
Williams said. ``The result of target fixation is often death.''
   While accidents are a hazard of military practice, the
8-year-old competition has a perfect safety record.
   ``We've never lost a crew member or an aircraft,'' Williams said
as an F-16 Fighting Falcon roared overhead, banking sharply after
dropping a bomb on a target half a mile away.
   The biennial exercise at Nellis draws the cream of the country's
Air Force pilots and crews who have won regional competition at
U.S. bases around the world.
   This year's competitors include teams from Germany, Japan, the
Philippines and the United Kingdom, as well as U.S. bases.
   The dummy bombs provide only a flash of fire and a puff of
smoke, leaving the target _ an aging tank _ charred but reusable.
The real thing would be a different story.
   ``A 500-pound bomb would scatter fragmentation for 3,000 feet,''
Williams said. ``It would have a good kill radius of 300 feet.''
   On Friday, F-16 units from McEntire Air National Guard Base,
S.C., and Hill Air Force Base, Utah, competed on the desert range,
along with A-10s from Bentwaters, United Kingdom.
   After the bombing competition, the planes swept back through the
valley, zeroing in on 25-foot square cloth targets strung across
the desert floor.
   The valley echoed with the ear-piercing chatter of the 20mm and
30mm shells as pilots sqeezed off bursts of gunfire from cannons
that fire 4,200 rounds a minute.
   Pilots fly seven days during the two-week event, which ends Oct.
14 and includes competitions among teams who load the weapons and
maintain the planes.
   There is even a competition to see which pilot lands closest to
his designated arrival time at Nellis. Six flights arrived within
one second of their designated time on Oct. 1.

<HEAD>New Analysis Casts Doubt on Reported Genetic Link For Psychiatric
Illness</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MALCOLM RITTER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Science Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A new study weakens the evidence linking
manic-depressive illness to a genetic defect as proposed in a
widely reported 1987 paper, says a scientist who participated in
both studies.
   Although the evidence remains suggestive, ``it's not up to the
accepted or the conventional level of significance that has been
used in these kinds of studies,'' said David Pauls.
   The original study had been hailed as the first to show a
genetic defect in a psychiatric illness that includes no physical
abnormalities in the brain.
   But with the new data, researchers are ``not nearly as confident
as we were'' that they had found the approximate location of such a
gene, said Pauls of the Yale University School of Medicine.
   ``I guess the conclusion is that the evidence isn't nearly as
strong, and additional work needs to be done so that we can either
definitely rule in or rule out the finding,'' he said.
   The new work was reported recently at a scientific meeting.
Co-authors included several researchers who wrote the 1987 paper,
and other scientists.
   Genes lie along tiny threadlike structures called chromosomes
that are found in cells of the body. The 1987 paper presented
evidence that a gene causing manic-depressive illness in three
generations of a large Amish family lay somewhere within a part of
the chromosome numbered 11.
   The new work suggests that either there is also a second gene
for the disease in the Amish, or that the originally reported gene
does not exist, Pauls said.
   The illness, also called bipolar disorder, is estimated to
affect about one out of every 100 Americans at some time in their
lives.
   Generally it involves severe depression plus episodes of mania,
which can include restlessness, racing thoughts and delusions of
grandeur, or of hypomania, a less intense form of mania. Symptoms
can be largely controlled with drugs.
   Soon after the 1987 paper was published, other researchers
announced that a different group of people showed evidence of a
gene for manic-depressive illness on the chromosome designated X.
Scientists said it supported the idea that more than one gene can
cause the disorder.
   Pauls said that more work has been done on the X chromosome
finding since, and it ``still looks quite convincing.''
   The original Amish research involved genetic testing of 19
family members who had manic-depressive illness or a related
condition, plus 62 family members without psychiatric illness.
   Scientists traced the inheritance of genetic markers, which are
detectable signposts on chromosomes. Statistical analysis comparing
marker inheritance to the appearance of the disease in a family
tree can reveal the location of disease-causing genes that lie near
the markers.
   Since the original work was done, Pauls said in a recent
interview, scientists have added some 40 people to the analysis,
and two people in the original group who had been disease-free
developed manic-depressive disorder.
   When the statistical analysis was performed again to include the
new information, the evidence for the reported manic-depressive
gene became considerably weaker, Pauls said.

   Some people suggested it was a waste of
time, and not even the organizers of a contest to identify animal
droppings could deny that waste was involved.
   The competition Thursday provided a light-hearted send-off to
more than 250 people who attended the American Zookeeper
Association's yearly conference this week.
   ``Bewing able to identify feces has its practical uses,'' said
Tom LaBarge, curator of carnivores for Syracuse's Burnet Park. `You
can tell a lot about an animal by analyzying its feces. It's
usually the first indication if something is wrong.''
   The specimens _ in plastic bags _ were laid out on several
tables to be identified by sight alone.
   There were brief hints in many cases, but No. 20 _ a single
dropping the size of a coconut _ simply said: ``No clue needed.''
Everyone answered elephant correctly.
   Nearly everyone was stumped by the feces of the sea cucumber, a
primitive invertebrate. The clue was: ``Not something you'd put in
a salad.''
   Frank Kohn of the National Zoo in Washington, D.C., was a bit
bemused by the hoopla.
   ``I never see the stuff in plastic bags _ and we never get
clues,'' Kohn said. ``We just scoop it up,''

<HEAD>Proposed Amendments Include Gas Tax, Plan to Increase Black Judges</HEAD>

<DATELINE>BATON ROUGE, La. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Proposals to encourage election of black
judges and boost the gasoline tax to finance highway construction
lead a list of state and local ballot questions before voters today.
   Secretary of State Fox McKeithen predicted that 33 to 35 percent
of the state's registered voters would go to the polls.
   There was little organized opposition to any of the 13 proposed
amendments to the state Constitution, and the transportation
measure drew the most statewide interest.
   The measure mirrored a proposal rejected by the voters April 29
when it was put forth by Gov. Buddy Roemer as part of a tax
revision plan.
   It would raise the gasoline tax by 4 cents per gallon to finance
$1.4 billion in transportation work, including widening highways
and expanding ports and airports. The measure also would require
that all 16 cents per gallon of the present motor fuel tax be used
for highways and public works projects.
   Roemer said the plan would boost efforts to attract new industry
to Louisiana and create thousands of construction jobs.
   ``I won't beat it to death, but it will be a powerful, positive
step forward for Louisiana and its taxpayers,'' the governor said.
   Two proposed amendments to the procedure for electing state
judges stem from federal lawsuits that contend that voting
districts are drawn to dilute black voting strength.
   There are no blacks on Louisiana's seven-member Supreme Court,
one black among the state's 52 appellate court judges and five
black district court judges out of 192.
   One amendment would add a judicial election district with a
majority of blacks in the New Orleans area and temporarily add a
justice to the state Supreme Court _ until the displaced incumbent
finishes out his term.
   Another amendment would create up to 35 black-majority
sub-districts for district and appellate courts.
   Among the other proposed constitutional amendments were one that
would make it easier for police to confiscate the property of
suspected drug dealers and another to set aside at least $5 million
a year in state mineral revenue to restore eroding wetlands.
   Several tax-related amendments were on the ballot, including
measures to raise the automobile license plate fee; to allow cities
and towns to raise property taxes; and to extend from five years to
10 years the current property tax assessment freeze for owners who
expand or improve buildings in certain districts.

baby boomers transformed society as they grew to adulthood, a
Census Bureau official says.
   Baby boomers _ the 75 million people born in the 20 years after
World War II _ swamped schools and later colleges as they grew up,
forcing big investments in classrooms; flooded the job market,
adding to pressures that increased the unemployment rate; and
dramatically transformed a nation's tastes in music and
entertainment, said James Wetzel, chief of the Census Bureau's
Center for Demographic Studies.
   As they grow older, their motivation is changing, he said Friday
during a symposium on the future at the Associated Press Managing
Editors convention.
   ``They're not as concerned about rock stars or college
admissions as they were just 10 years ago,'' Wetzel said. ``The
baby boom generation is into careers. They're moving from sporty
little Japanese cars to minivans. They're concerned with home
ownership and child care.''
   He said the new buzz word is ``cocooning.''
   ``Loosely translated, the baby boom generation is not so fond of
hanging around discos any more. They're staying home with a $2
video and a $9 pizza.''
   Some of those changes represent the kind of forces that shape
nations.
   ``The aging of the population has a powerful down side,'' he
said. ``The young adult population, the population which provides
important impetus for social change and economic change, is
declining.''
   The number of Americans ages 15-25 peaked at about 43 million in
1980 and already has dropped by about 7 million, he said. Between
1990 and 2000, he said, about 7 million to 8 million fewer people
will be in the 25-35 age group.
   Another rapidly growing segment of the population comprises
those older than 85.
   Wetzel said the Health Care Financing Administration projects a
need for 400,000 nursing home beds nationwide between 1990 and
2000, or 100 beds a day for the remainder of the century.
   He said that barring catastrophes such as war or plague, the
median American will be 36 by the year 2000, compared with under 28
in 1970 and 33 today. Median means half are younger and half are
older.
   The wave of older Americans will challenge the hierarchy of
industry, he said.
   Among those challenges is a large increase in the number of
people looking for promotions to management that far outstrips the
positions available.
   Another challenge is recruiting entry level workers from a
shrinking pool of available workers.
   By the late 1990s, the supply of college graduates may be 10
percent smaller than the average pool available in the 1980s,
Wetzel said.
   He also discussed the massive shift of married women, especially
those with children, into the job market. More than six of 10 wives
are in the work force, double the proportion of 1950. More than
half of the nation's mothers are in the work force and slightly
more than half of all the mothers of children below the age of 1
are working, he said.
   The population trends also provide evidence of an America in
which young people remain single longer and where more families are
headed by a single adult.
   About 56 percent of the nation's households have married
couples, down from 75 percent in the 1960s, he said.
   Since 1970, the number of households with married couples and
children has dropped 3.5 percent.
   And in the last 20 years, the number of people living alone has
increased from 9 million to 21 million and the number of households
headed by a single person has more than doubled to 13 million.

<TEXT>
   A news industry far too eager to grab
the easy story has helped trivialize the nation's political life,
House Majority Whip William H. Gray told newspaper editors.
   ``I'll be very candid with you,'' said Gray. ``Eleven years ago
when I went to Congress, there were more press people who
understood what budget authority and outlays meant.
   ``Now you get people writing stories about budget policy who
don't even know what a budget outlay and a budget authority is.
Therefore, what they focus on is the superficial political
categorizations and charges.''
   Gray, a Pennsylvania Democrat, made his comments at a convention
of the Associated Press Managing Editors. He said an increasing
focus on ``the easy story'' has contributed to ``the trivialization
of American politics.''
   Gray last spring had his own brush with the press just before
his election to a House leadership post. News reports citing
unnamed sources said he was the target of an FBI investigation
about his office personnel policies.
   Those reports were later denied, but Gray said they were
symbolic of ``the more recent infatuation'' with the personal lives
of politicians.
   ``Am I advocating an end to public scrutiny? By no means,'' he
said. ``What I would recommend is greater self-control.
   ``Since there can be no all-encompassing definition of what
constitutes news, likewise there should be no predisposition that
all things involving public officials is news.''
   Gray's brush with controversy was among several involving ethics
in Congress, one of which led to the resignation of former Speaker
Jim Wright.
   Congress is likely to approve a new ethics code this fall, Gray
said.
   But there's a deeper problem, he added.
   ``The biggest problem I have as I look at the press in general
in Washington is a tendency to go for what I call the superficial,
the easy story where you can get into simple headlines, simple
bites,'' said Gray. ``I'm often terribly disappointed by that.
   ``It makes all of us in Washington look like a bunch of naughty
kids, calling each other names.''
   Gray said the focus on superficial events has a domino effect,
making politicians fit that style of coverage.
   ``Even more serious is the more recent infatuation with the
personal lives of public officials,'' he said. ``This preoccupation
is not a result of the trivialization of American politics, it is a
contributing factor.''

   Two Burmese students who hijacked a
jetliner in an effort to gain democracy for their military-ruled
homeland surrendered today, and a Thai official indicated they
would be treated leniently.
   The students seized control of the Fokker 28 during a domestic
flight in Burma Friday and ordered it flown to Bangkok. They then
threatened to blow up the craft and the 83 others aboard if their
demands for democracy were not met.
   But after 10 hours of negotiations with Thai and Burmese
officials, the hostages were freed unharmed and the students gave
themselves up.
   ``I think really now it is a matter of looking at the details of
the negotiations and the conditions for the surrender,'' said a
senior Thai official, on condition of anonymity.
   Another Thai official indicated the students would probably be
treated leniently.
   ``We think they are students and not professional terrorists,''
he said on condition of anonymity.
   Although Thailand has nurtured friendly relations with Burma, it
does not have a formal extradition treaty with that country. The
Thai official said it was possible the students would be sent to a
third country.
   Thirty-five hostages were released late Friday and the remaining
48 passengers and crew were allowed to leave early today. Aung Gyi,
a Burmese embassy official, said the passengers would be sent back
to Burma today.
   A Thai official later entered the empty plane and emerged
carrying a box he said contained a bomb.
   The hijackers had demanded the release of political prisoners,
an end to military rule and the restoration of democracy in Burma.
   But Thailand's Deputy Government Spokesman Likit Hongladarom,
said the hijackers _ identified as Ye Yin and Ye Thi Ha _ simply
wanted their demands known and published by the press. They had
probably not expected the Rangoon government would act on them, he
said.
   Slogans were scribbled with a felt pen on the inside and outside
of the aircraft, recalling last year's military crackdown on the
student-led uprising in Burma.
   ``Democracy and human rights for our people'' and ``Our heads
are bloody but unbowed,'' the slogans read.
   The names of the hijackers, which translate as ``brave'' and
``lion'' respectively, appeared to be pseudonyms.
   A statement they gave to a reporter was signed Ye Thon Baw,
which literally means the ``Three brave comrades.'' It was not,
however, clear who the third person was.
   The official Burmese news agency said the plane was hijacked
between Mergui in southern Burma and Rangoon, the capital, then
diverted at gunpoint to Thailand. The Fokker landed in Utaphao, a
sprawling military base southeast of Bangkok used by U.S. B-52
bombers during the Vietnam War.
   The hijackers then handed Thai authorities a list of seven
demands, which included the release of top opposition leader Aung
San Suu Kyi, an end to the military-imposed curfew and restoration
of democracy in Burma.
   Ms. Suu Kyi was placed under house arrest on July 20 after
speaking out against the military government. Her National League
for Democracy is Burma's largest opposition party in Burma.
   Thousands of students fled the 1988 uprising and another
clampdown on opposition this year. Many took refuge with ethnic
rebel groups that have fought the Rangoon government for 40 years
for greater autonomy.
   Thaung Htun, a spokesman for the All Burma Students Democratic
Front, said his group had no part in the hijacking, but said, ``We
have sympathy and understanding with their actions.''

   Airport technicians demanding a pay
increase walked off the job early today but returned to work after
the government promised to study their requests, officials said.
   The seven-hour strike forced the cancellation of 70 domestic
flights nationwide and delays in international flights, said
Eduardo Carrascoso, manager of Ninoy Aquino International Airport.
   Necias Dayap, president of one of the two labor unions that went
on strike, said about 745 workers went on strike, including airport
communications and maintenance technicians. The strike left the
Manila airport without navigational aid and limited communication
facilities, Carrascoso said.
   Normal operations later resumed at the airport.
   Dayap said the workers, who make $178 a month, were demanding a
$18 pay increase to match the salaries of air traffic controllers.

   A hot air balloon crash-landed in

was the second such accident in Australia in less than two months.
   Police said the balloon had been in the air about two hours when
it fell to earth about 30 miles northwest of Melbourne. Three of
the six were seriously injured, police said.
   No other details were immediately available.
   On Aug. 13, two balloons on a sightseeing trip struck each other

ground and killing all 13 aboard.
   An ballooning expert called the accident in August near the town

   A judge convicted the leader of South
Korea's largest dissident group today of making illegal contact
with communist North Korea and sentenced him to two years in prison.
   In a related development, prosecutors today indicted a radical
student charged with making an unauthorized trip to the North. If
convicted, she could be sentenced to death.
   Lee Bu-young, 46, co-chairman of the United National Democratic
Movement, South Korea's largest dissident organization, was
convicted of violating National Security Law and aiding an illegal
labor strike.
   Judge Lee Tae-woon of the Seoul District Criminal Court ruled
that the dissident contacted North Korea early this year to arrange
a meeting in defiance of a government ban.
   Under South Korean law, discussions on national unification may
not be conducted by unauthorized individuals.
   Lee Bu-young also was found guilty of violating the Labor Law
for allegedly aiding workers carrying out an illegal three-month
shipyard strike.
   Dissident sources said Lee was expected to appeal the conviction.
   The Seoul District Prosecutors' Office indicted Im Su-kyong, a
radical student who made an illegal trip to North Korea's capital
of Pyongyang to attend an international youth festival and discuss
unification with communist leaders.
   She was charged with traveling to the North on communist
instructions, giving the Pyongyang government information,
supporting communist causes and receiving money and goods while in
North Korea from June 30 to Aug. 15.
   It was not known when her case would come to trial.
   Ms. Im was arrested when she returned through the border truce
village of Panmunjom.
   Prosecutors said 23 people have been arrested in connection with
Ms. Im's case. The government has said it will prosecute those who
helped her or had prior knowledge of her illegal trip.
   The Korean peninsula was divided into the communist North and
capitalist South after World War II. The North invaded the South to
launch the three-year Korean War in 1950 and a peace treaty was
never signed, keeping the two sides technically at war.
   Although the two Koreas have held occasional talks aimed at
uniting the peninsula, they remain hostile enemies. The border
between the two nations is one of the most heavily fortified areas
in the world.

<HEAD>China Expresses Regret Over Nobel Peace Prize for Dalai Lama</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BEIJING (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   China today expressed ``utmost regret and
indignation'' over the awarding of the Nobel Peace Prize to the
Dalai Lama, saying the Tibetan spiritual leader is working to
undermine the national unity of the country.
   The Foreign Ministry reaction came two days after the Nobel
Committee announced the winner of the prize and a day after China's
official Xinhua News Agency condemned the choice.
   ``The decision taken by the Norwegian Nobel Committee to award
the Nobel Peace Prize to the Dalai Lama constitutes open support to
the Dalai Lama and the Tibetan separatists in their activities to
undermine the national unity and split China,'' the ministry said.
   ``It represents a gross interference in China's internal affairs
and seriously hurts the national feelings of the Chinese people.
Over this we express our utmost regret and indignation.''
   The ministry statement said the decision ``deviates from the
committee's purpose of awarding the prize to those working for and
contributing to `harmony and good will among peoples.'''
   The Nobel Committee, in giving the 54-year-old Buddhist monk the
peace prize, praised his dedication to non-violence and ``great
reverence for all things living.''
   China, however, blames the Dalai Lama and his followers for
instigating at least four major outbreaks of anti-Chinese,
pro-independence violence in the Tibetan capital of Lhasa in the
past two years.
   The Dalai Lama has lived in exile in northern India since
fleeing Lhasa in 1959 following a failed uprising against the
Chinese army.
   China says the remote mountain region of Tibet has been an
integral part of the nation since the 13th century.
   Many Tibetans demand independence, although the Dalai Lama last
year offered a compromise proposal under which Tibet would gain
self-autonomy but cede control of its defense and foreign affairs
to the Beijing government.
   China has rejected the proposal but says it is willing to meet
the Dalai Lama to discuss the Tibet question.

   East Germans turned their attention to
torchbearers and the charismatic Mikhail S. Gorbachev and away from
the thousands who fled westward shortly before the nation's 40th
anniversary festivities.
   The Soviet president was center stage Friday as he visited East
Berlin's war memorials and stood beside East German leader Erich
Honecker as tens of thousands of East German youth paraded by.
   He inspired cheers of ``Gorby! Gorby!'' from the crowd as he
broke ranks to chat and walk among them during the carefully staged
birthday celebrations Friday.
   But Gorbachev joined with East bloc leaders and other friends of
East Berlin, such as PLO chief Yasser Arafat and Nicarguan
President Daniel Ortega, for a lavish show of unity. The two-day
celebration ends today.
   There has been little mention of the exodus of disgruntled East
Germans that has captured world attention.
   Communist authorities worked hard to keep the focus on East
Germany's economic successes and off the turmoil. But hundreds more
East Germans fled Friday to freedom in the West, where at least
47,000 have found homes since early September.
   Police clashed with protesters in Dresden and Magdeburg, and
authorities barred Western tourists from East Berlin.
   Friday's anniversary events were capped by a parade in which
tens of thousands marched down the city's main boulevard carrying
flaming torches and chanting ``German Democratic Republic (East
Germany), our fatherland.''
   ``All of our energy and loyalty to the German Democratic
Republic,'' read one of the banners.
   Gorbachev and Honecker waved and smiled to the crowd. Blazing
beams of blue light cut into the night sky and laser images formed
doves of peace.
   Earlier, Gorbachev visited two war memorials and at one, walked
along columns etched with the words of Josef Stalin, a Soviet
predecessor whose course he has condemned.
   The Soviet leader was greeted along the motorcade route by
throngs of well-wishers. There were signs that East Germans hoped
Gorbachev's reform effort would penetrate the East Berlin
government, which has rejected radical change.
   ``He's trying to do a lot,'' said one young woman.
   The official message, however, presented the orthodox communist
line. Periodicals prepared for the event contrasted World War II
East Germany with the modern, rebuilt country today. Indeed, the
country is in the best shape economically of the Warsaw Pact allies.
   ``East Germany has achieved, through the courage and brilliance
and energy of its people, a life with more dignity and meaning,''
Honecker said in a hourlong speech to party members.

   The daughter of actress Jane Fonda and filmmaker
Roger Vadim was charged with disorderly conduct and other
violations after police arrested her with a friend who was
allegedly carrying drugs.
   Vanessa Vadim, 21, was also charged Friday with obstructing
governmental administration and loitering for the purpose of
purchasing drugs, after narcotics officers saw her enter a building
known for narcotics trafficking, police said.
   She was being held today awaiting arraignment, said Stephen
Rivers, a spokesman for Ms. Fonda.
   He declined further comment on the case.
   Ms. Vadim was arrested with Thomas Feegal, 22, who was charged
with criminal possession of a controlled substance _ two glassine
envelopes believed to contain heroin and a hypodermic needle, said
a police spokesman, Sgt. Peter Sweeney.
   Police found no drugs on Ms. Vadim, the Daily News reported in
today's editions. The News said Ms. Vadim and Feegal, who was
described as her boyfriend, told police they bought the heroin
``for research purposes.''
   Narcotics officers saw Ms. Vadim and Feegal being led into a
known drug location at about 8 a.m., Sweeney said.
   As the two and a third person, Manuel Rivera, 30, emerged from
the building, the officers saw Feegal give a glassine envelope to
Rivera, he said.
   Eleven other arrests were made at the six-story building, which
has broken and boarded up windows and is frequented by junkies, the
News said.
   Feegal, a student at New York University, tried to flee as the
officers began the arrest, and when a police officer grabbed
Feegal, Ms. Vadim tried to pull him away from the officer, the
police spokesman said.
   Police said Rivera was also charged with drug possession.
   Ms. Vadim is the only daughter of Ms. Fonda, who also has a
15-year-old son, Troy, from her marriage to California state
Assemblyman Tom Hayden. Hayden and Ms. Fonda announced earlier this
year that they were separating.
   Ms. Vadim, a student at Brown University, was in New York to
attend the premiere of her mother's new movie, ``Old Gringo,''
which opened here Friday, according to a Fonda associate who
declined to be identified.
   Ms. Vadim and Ms. Fonda on Thursday attended a special screening
of the movie to benefit the Robert F. Kennedy Memorial Fund.
   Ms. Fonda had been scheduled to leave for Rome Friday but
postponed her plans because of her daughter's arrest, the
associated said.

   LAS VEGAS _ A drug pipeline that ended in a Los Angeles
warehouse apparently pumped 60 tons of cocaine into Southern
California and returned some $80 million to traffickers in the past
year, a federal prosecutor said.
   Meanwhile, a sworn statement unsealed Friday alleges that Rafael
Munoz of Juarez, Mexico, was the middleman who provided
``transportation and storage for loads of cocaine coming from
Colombia via Mexico to the United States.''
   Munoz, who remains at large, is considered a premier importer of
multiton quantities of narcotics into the United States, The Los
Angeles Times reported in today's editions.
   Court records in the case were unsealed at a bail hearing for
two men charged in connection with a Sept. 29 raid that netted
about 19 tons of cocaine and $12.2 million in cash _ the biggest
cocaine seizure ever.
   Information about the smuggling operation was provided by James
McTague, 41, the alleged supervisor of the warehouse cache in
Sylmar in suburban Los Angeles for about a year, Assistant U.S.
Attorney Tom Green said.
   ``He indicated that since he had been in charge they had moved
60 tons of cocaine through the warehouse,'' Green said. ``The
ledgers showed that $80 million cash had gone through his hands
since he'd been involved.''
   McTague was among four other men also arrested in the case. The
Los Angeles District Attorney's office dismissed charges against
them Friday so federal charges, carrying significantly sticter
penalties, could be pursued.
   Los Angeles-based Special Assistant U.S. Attorney Susan Bryant
said she expected the case to go before a grand jury next week.
   The men were being held without bail in Los Angeles for
investigation of conspiracy and drug trafficking.
   On Thursday, narcotics agents announced more cocaine seizures
almost as big _ almost 15 tons confiscated in separate raids in
Harlingen, Texas, and New Orleans.
   Almost 9 tons found in a three-bedroom home in Harlingen was
bound for Los Angeles, authorities said, but it apparently was
unrelated to the drug seizure in Sylmar.
   The staggering amount of cocaine seized _ almost 34 tons in less
than a week _ led U.S. Transportation Secretary Samuel K. Skinner
to speculate that Colombia's crackdown on drugs was forcing drug
cartels to move vast quantities of coke quickly into the United
States.
   Drug cartels used to keep large stockpiles of cocaine in
Colombia and move it gradually to the United States, Skinner said
in New Orleans Thursday, but they're now moving it in huge lots.
   ``That's because of the pressure from the government in
Colombia,'' he said.
   But on Friday, drug czar William J. Bennett's office ordered an
urgent review to determine if U.S. estimates of cocaine production
have been vastly understated, the Times reported.
   According to U.S. estimates, the 34 tons confiscated represents
about 8 percent of the cartel's maximum annual production of 400
tons.
   ``The most likely scenario is that there's a hell of a lot more
cocaine in the United States than people thought before,'' one
unnamed senior administration official told the newspaper.
   Evidence seized in the Sylmar warehouse have laid bare the inner
workings of a major trafficking operation, and federal officials
said it may help them follow drug money to legitimate businesses
and banks where it is laundered.
   The disclosures came during an identity and bail hearing for
Carlos Tapia Ponce and his son, Hector Tapia Anchondo, who
authorities claim ran the U.S. leg of the alleged smuggling
operation.
   The two men are being held without bail for investigation of
conspiracy and possession of cocaine with intent to distribute.
   U.S. Magistrate Lawrence Leavitt recessed the hearing without
ruling on a request for bail by Anchondo. Leavitt, who was not
asked to set bail for Ponce, said he would rule on the request
later.

<HEAD>Teachers Lack Confidence In Dealings With Handicapped Pupils</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LEE MITGANG</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Most parents think handicapped children are
faring better in school than a decade ago, but only a third of
classroom teachers say they feel confident in their dealings with
the disabled, according to a new poll.
   The poll, ``A Report Card on Special Education,'' also found
only 11 percent of parents and 15 percent of teachers and other
educators saying schools are doing an excellent job preparing
handicapped students for jobs after high school.
   Only 15 percent of parents and teachers surveyed thought public
schools were doing an excellent job preparing the 4.4 million
disabled children in special education programs for college or
other education beyond high school.
   And while 97 percent of handicapped students said they made
friends at school, 42 percent felt they were teased more often than
other children.
   Nonetheless, 94 percent of eof the ``Education for All
Handicapped Children Act,'' the federal law conferring most of the
education rights such youngsters now have.
   The survey of parents, educators and disabled students was
conducted by Louis Harris and Associates for the International
Center for the Disabled in New York, and the National Council on
Disability. A copy was given to The Associated Press on Friday.
   ``Both educators and parents are saying that schools are not
preparing these students for college or jobs. When you think about
the state of education, as bad as the quality of schooling is for
nondisabled children, to hear that it's worse for the handicapped
is pretty shocking,'' said Thomas Mehnert, assistant survey
director for the disabled center.
   Nearly half of the regular classroom teachers surveyed said they
have two or more handicapped students in their classes. But just 40
percent of those said they had training in special ed, and only 32
percent felt confident of their decisions affecting handicapped
children.
   A total of 702 special ed directors, school principals, regular
and special ed classroom teachers were interviewed by telephone,
along with 1,000 parents and 200 disabled students.
   The survey had a sampling error ranging from plus or minus two
percentage points on questions asked of everyone in the survey, to
plus or minus 14 on questions aimed at various subgroups.
   Fred Weintraub, executive director of the Council for
Exceptional Children in Reston, Va., and an architect of the 1975
special education statute, said the survey suggested ``an
incredibly high happiness rate'' among those served by special ed.
   But he added: ``We have real shortages of well-trained special
ed personnel and it's going to get far worse if we don't do
anything about it. Because of those shortages, we are seeing all
kinds of creative groupings of children _ for example, programs
designed for learning disabled kids forced to include emotionally
disturbed kids. So you have teachers with skills in one working
with some of those kids, but not others.''
   Among the survey's other findings:
   _ 61 percent of parents said they knew little or nothing about
their rights under key federal laws such as the 1973 Rehabilitation
Act, which gave students the right to ``a free, appropriate
education in the least restrictive environment'';
   _ over half the parents surveyed, 56 percent, said they had to
struggle to get the education their children needed, 36 percent
said they had considered filing complaints against their schools,
and 10 percent said they had done so;
   _ over 70 percent of parents gave positive marks to educators'
attitudes toward handicapped children, physical access to school
facilities, and efforts by schools to integrate disabled and
non-handicapped children;
   _ 78 percent of handicapped students say they find their work
interesting and 88 percent called their teachers helpful. But 18
percent of their parents said the quality of academic programs in
their schools was worse for handicapped children.

<UNK>Government Resigns To Set Stage For New Elections</UNK>
<DATELINE>ATHENS, Greece (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Conservative Premier Tzannis Tzannetakis
today resigned, saying his 3-month-old rightist-communist coalition
government had completed its mission to begin a cleanup of Greek
politics.
   The resignation set the stage for new general elections next
month.
   Tzannetakis headed the coalition government that emerged from
the June 18 general elections.
   His New Democracy Party and the communist-dominated Coalition of
the Left and Progress agreed to unite only to push Premier Andreas
Papandreou's eight-year socialist administration out of power and
launch an investigation of government corruption.
   Tzannetakis met with President Christos Sartzetakis at the
presidential palace where he told him that his government had
completed its mission of instigating a cleanup of Greek politics.
   A member of the premier's New Democracy Party said Tzannetakis
was asked by the president to remain until a new administration was
formed.
   But chances for a new government to be formed from the present
Parliament appeared extremely slim.
   New Democracy leader Constantine Mitsotakis and Greek Communist
Party chief Harilaos Florakis stated they would reject a
presidential mandate to form a new Cabinet.
   However, Papandreou has said he would make an attempt to form a
caretaker government.
   Presumably Papandreou will attempt to persuade the communists to
join him in an alliance supported by socialist and leftist forces.
   Papandreou, 70, has been indicted by Parliament twice within the
past three weeks for allegedly instigating illegal wiretapping of
political friends and foes and for his alleged involvement in a
million dollar banking embezzlement scheme.
   Two special courts of Supreme Court judges are expected to
convene within the next two months to start proceedings against
Papandreou and former socialist ministers and officials allegedly
connected with the scandals.
   Papandreou and his ex-ministers have denied any wrongdoing
during their term in office.

<HEAD>Salvadoran Leftists Free Hostages, End Embassy Seizure</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SAN SALVADOR, El Salvador (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Activists freed their 12
hostages and ended a 28-hour seige at the Costa Rican Embassy to
protest alleged human rights violations by the rightist government.
   Government spokesman Mauricio Sandoval called the embassy
takeover ``an affront to the government and people of Costa Rica
... a violent action that makes no sense.'' He alleged the group's
activists had ``direct links'' to leftist guerrillas fighting
Salvadoran governments for 10 years.
   Some of the 20 members of the Federation of Committees of
Mothers and Relatives of Political Prisoners who took part in the
incident may be charged, he said without elaboration.
   The activists, mostly mothers and other female relatives of
people jailed or killed by right-wing death squads over the past
decade, released their hostages Friday. Hostages and activists were
taken away in six International Red Cross vehicles.
   Police would not let reporters talk to evacuees. None of the
hostages _ one Costa Rican diplomat and 11 Salvadorans employed in
the embassy _ appeared harmed.
   Sandoval said the hostages were taken to Red Cross headquarters
in San Salvador for medical checks before being sent home and the
activists returned to their group's headquarters.
   The government spokesman said the activists apparently left
their weapons ``inside the offices or hidden,'' because they
boarded the Red Cross vehicles unarmed. The activists had insisted
they were not armed, but Costa Rican diplomats said they carried
weapons.
   The activists arrived in small groups early Thursday, pretending
to apply for visas, then seized the embassy and took 16 hostages.
They later allowed Ambassador Jesus Fernandez, who had heart
trouble, and some employees to leave. A spokeswoman for the
activists, who did not give her name, told reporters earlier the
hostage-taking was to protest alleged human rights violations by
President Alfredo Cristiani's rightist government, which took power
June 1. It also was to bring pressure for ``concrete measures'' to
end the war.
   For eight years, the federation has protested the kidnappings
and killings of people suspected of leftist sympathies by rightist
death squads. More than 70,000 people have died in the decade-old
war, most of them civilians.

<HEAD>Another Multi-Billion-Dollar Order for Boeing Despite Strike</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GEORGE TIBBITS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SEATTLE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Despite a rancorous strike by 57,800 machinists
at Boeing Co., the world's largest commercial airplane builder
continued to obtain multi-billion-dollar orders.
   With no talks scheduled in the walkout, Boeing officials
announced an order Friday from Evergreen Airways Corp. of Taiwan
for four 747-400s and two extended-range 767-300ERs, plus options
for equal numbers of the same models. T. Craig Martin of Boeing
Commercial Airplanes said the order, including options, eventually
would be worth nearly $2 billion.
   The planes were among 26 ordered by Evergreen Airways from
Boeing and McDonnell Douglas Corp.
   Two planes were delivered Friday, a 757 to Ansett Worldwide
Leasing Co. of Australia for eventual use by Air Belgium, and a
747-400 to Malaysia Airlines. Another 747-400 jumbo jet is set for
delivery Monday to Qantas Airways, Boeing officials said.
   Federal Aviation Administration officials said Friday they were
investigating reports that some supervisors cheated on the
certification tests took so they could perform work normally done
by union members, who entered the fourth day of their strike today.
   Jack Gamble of Boeing Commercial Airplanes said he knew of no
cheating on tests.
   ``If the company was aware of it, it certainly wouldn't allow
it,'' Gamble added.
   The striking International Association of Machinists and
Aerospace Workers represents about 43,300 workers in the Seattle
area, about 12,000 in Wichita, Kan., 1,700 in Portland, Ore. and
several hundred others in Hawaii, California, Montana and Utah.
   ``I have heard from the union, and they are interested in
returning to the table, but nothing is scheduled, and I don't
foresee anything this weekend,'' federal mediator Doug Hammond said.
   A striker's arm was broken when he was struck by a pickup truck
Thursday at the west gate of the 747 and 767 plant in Everett, said
Ken Murray of the Everett police.
   A friend of the injured man struck the driver with his fist and
was arrested for investigation of assault, Murray said.
   The driver of the truck was not cited. Murray said witnesses
said he attempted to stop and was unable to swerve because of other
pickets in the street.
   Production levels were lower than normal and members of another
Boeing union complained of some harassment from strikers.
   Charles Bofferding, president of the Seattle Professional
Engineering Employees Association, the second-largest union at
Boeing, said in a letter that some of his 27,000 members were
``meeting with resistance and mild harassment.''
   He urged his members to wear union identification and to refuse
to do machinists' work.
   Gamble said production was ``going very slowly,'' with company
officials still trying to match supervisors with assembly-line jobs.
   ``The first few days are the toughest, trying to find out who
you have and what they know,'' he said.
   Of the 93 planes scheduled for delivery between now and the end
of the year, about 40 were complete enough to be finished by
supervisors, Gamble said.
   Before the strike, Boeing was running close to capacity,
producing about 30 planes a month.
   The machinists went on striker Wednesday after rejecting an
offer that included an immediate raise of 4 percent with 3 percent
raises in both 1990 and 1991, annual bonuses and a reduction in
mandatory overtime.
   The last machinists strike at Boeing, in 1977, lasted 45 days.

<HEAD>Human Rights Groups Denounce Abuses In Haiti</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MICHAEL NORTON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti (AP) _ Four international human rights
groups said there are persistent human rights violations in Haiti
and urged ruler Lt. Gen. Prosper Avril to stick to his promises of
curbing abuses.
   The delegation from Americas Watch, the National Coalition for
Haitian Refugees, Caribbean Rights, and the International
Commission of Jurists issued a statement Friday after a weeklong
investigation in the impoverished Caribbean nation.
   ``We don't believe that violence and arbitrariness will cease
unless Avril's government proves by its acts that it is firmly
determined to put an end to them,'' the groups said in a statement.
   The delegation said it was worried about ``repeated acts of
repression'' against grass-roots organizations.
   It denounced the absence of legal action taken against thugs and
soldiers responsible for killings since dictator Jean-Claude
Duvalier fled into exile in France in 1986.
   The delegation said those killers must be tried to discourage
``a repetition of these tragic moments in Haitian history.''
   The delegation said, however, the arrest of several soldiers for
various crimes, a new legal assistance program for the poor and
publication of an electoral timetable were all positive steps.
   Avril has pledged to turn over power to a civilian government.
The independent Electoral Council has set elections for autumn
1990, with the president to be sworn in on Feb. 7, 1991, exactly
five years after Duvalier left.
   ``Elections can only have meaning if all Haitian citizens are
free to speak, organize and assemble without fear of persecution,''
the communique said.
   The delegation said Avril assured them that his government
guaranteed the rights of speech and assembly.
   ``He declared that the violation of these rights was the result
of actions taken at the local level'' and that he had discharged
those responsible, the statement said.

<HEAD>Jury Clears Journalist of Libeling Former Indian Prime Minister</HEAD>

<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Pulitzer Prize-winner Seymour M. Hersh said a
federal jury's ruling that he didn't libel a former Indian prime
minister was ``a terribly important victory for any journalist.''
   Jurors deliberated six hours Friday before rejecting Morarji
Desai's claim that he was libeled when Hersh described him as a CIA
informant in the 1983 book, ``The Price of Power: Kissinger in the
Nixon White House.''
   The U.S. District Court jury found Desai had failed to prove
Hersh was guilty of libel _ that is, that he had knowingly printed
false material with malice, or with reckless disregard for whether
it was true.
   Further, the panel said Desai had failed to disprove the claims
about Desai's work for the CIA, which Hersh testified came from a
half-dozen high-level government officials whom he refused to name.
   Desai's lawyer, Cyriac D. Kappil, had asked jurors to award $3.5
million to his client, prime minister of India from 1977 to 1979.
Desai, 94, lives in Bombay and didn't attend the trial because of
failing health.
   The lawyer said he would confer with Desai and fellow attorneys
before deciding whether to appeal.
   Hersh said the verdict in the six-year-old case vindicated him,
and he described the case as ``a terribly important victory for any
journalist.''
   ``I think it's going to make it easier for all the people in my
profession,'' he said of the ruling. ``Nonetheless, it's also very
chilling. It's also very frightening to realize that you can write
things that can put you through a process like this.''
   The book said Desai was paid $20,000 a year by the CIA and was
considered a valuable ``asset'' to the U.S. government during the
administrations of Lyndon Johnson and Richard Nixon.
   Kappil alleged in his closing argument Wednesday that Hersh had
fabricated notes to back up the assertions about Desai.
   Defense attorney Bernard J. Nussbaum countered that such
behavior was ``entirely out of keeping with his career as a
journalist.''
   Hersh won the Pulitzer Prize for international reporting in 1970
for his reports on the My Lai massacre in Vietnam. He has reported
for The Associated Press and the The New York Times, and left the
newspaper to pursue his own writing.
   Former Secretary of State Henry Kissinger testified earlier this
week that he didn't believe Desai was a CIA informant. But he
acknowledged he couldn't be absolutely sure because he wasn't told
the names of informants.

   Exxon Valdez captain Joseph Hazelwood
will be tried outside Valdez because of the publicity and local
concern there over the nation's worst oil spill, prosecutors and
defense attorneys said.
   A new location for the trial, set for January, has not yet been
decided.
   Hazelwood, 42, of Huntington, N.Y., faces three misdemeanor and
three felony charges stemming from the March 24 accident.
   The tanker was under Hazelwood's command when it ran aground
after he turned the controls over to the vessel's third mate,
Gregory Cousins. More than 11 million gallons of thick North Slope
crude oil spilled into the sea.
   Cousins was barred Thursday from serving as an officer on any
ship for nine months after he pleaded no-contest at a hearing in
Seattle to charges of negligence in monitoring the tanker's
position.
   A Coast Guard report said that before leaving the bridge,
Hazelwood talked with Cousins about when to return to the vessel
traffic lanes, which the captain had left to avoid ice in Prince
William Sound.
   Cousins failed to return to the normal course for several
minutes after passing Busby Light, where Hazelwood had instructed
him to turn, the report said. It quoted Cousins as saying he
ordered the appropriate change in course, but the ship failed to
respond.
   Defense lawyers Richard Friedman and Dick Madson have sought to
move Hazelwood's trial out of Valdez, and Assistant District
Attorney Brent Cole said the state supports the move.
   ``Because of the large amount of pretrial publicity and the
large economic impact on Valdez ... we just agreed in the interests
of expeditious proceedings to not got through the hassle of trying
to get a jury in Valdez,'' Cole said.
   Cole said he has asked that the trial be held in Anchorage, but
Friedman said he was unsure that would be a good choice. ``I think
we're moving in the right direction _ away from Valdez,'' he said.
   Anchorage Superior Judge Karl Johnstone was assigned to the case
Tuesday after Palmer Superior Court Judge Beverly Cutler
disqualified herself. Cutler said litigation handled by her father
and her sister could create the appearance of a conflict of
interest.
   Johnstone, assigned by Anchorage Superior Court Judge Brian
Shortell, is a commercial fisherman.
   Friedman said Johnstone's fishing was known when Shortell
assigned him, and the defense team does not believe the activity
poses a conflict. Fishermen were among those injured by the spill.
   Johnstone said he will not make any decisions on the case until
lawyers decide whether they want him to remain.

<TEXT>
   Barbara Bush paid a visit to a teen nightspot,
giving hundreds of students a break from school and a chance to
hear her praise for good, clean fun.
   Mrs. Bush made a brief Friday afternoon stop at the Basement, an
alcohol-free nightclub established last year by parents who wanted
to give teen-agers a safe place to go to on weekend nights.
   The club was closed this summer after six months because of poor
attendance, but it is scheduled to reopen at the end of the month
with live entertainment, movies and a game room.
   Students from several area schools were allowed to leave their
classes to accompany Mrs. Bush to the Basement.
   ``I can't wait to go back and tell George,'' she said from a
stage where rock 'n' roll bands usually play.
   ``I can't think of anything that meets the needs of our times
better than this,'' she said.
   Though Mrs. Bush got an enthusiastic reception during her
appearance, some of the students in the crowd said the main reason
they were at the Basement was because the event got them out of
school on a beautiful fall afternoon.
   Cason White, a 12th-grader at Pace Academy, said he rarely came
to the Basement, noting the regular $5 admission charge. ``It's
kind of expensive and out of the way,'' he said. He and his friends
said they'd rather go to parties.
   The atmosphere at the Basement, said classmate Jeffrey Cohen,
``seems so paranoid, it turns kids off.''
   Anne Landis, a spokeswoman for the club, said organizers are
hoping that changes made during the summer will make the Basement
more appealing to teen-agers. The club is striving to make the
adult supervision less conspicuous, she said.
   ``We don't want kids to think it's too straight-laced,'' Ms.
Landis said.
   Earlier Friday, Mrs. Bush told a convocation at the Morehouse
School of Medicine that the predominantly black college had made
her optimistic the nation's poor will receive better health care.
   Mrs. Bush is a former board member at the medical school,
founded by Health and Human Services Secretary Dr. Louis W.
Sullivan. Its mission is to provide doctors for poor, mainly
inner-city areas.
   She noted that the school's student body is growing rapidly. It
has a 95 percent passing rate on national board tests and has never
experienced an operating budget deficit.
   ``I'm not naive enough to think the graduates of Morehouse will
solve all the health problems ... but I'm optimistic,'' Mrs. Bush
said.

<HEAD>Pope Calls on Koreans to End Bitter Ideological Struggle</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: New thruout to UPDATE with pope's call for Korean reunification,
anti-government protest. Changes byline. No pickup.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By C.W. LIM</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>SEOUL, South Korea (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Pope John Paul II opened an Asian
pilgrimage today by urging Koreans to end the bitter ideological
struggle that has divided their land and to reach out in peace to
Communist North Korea.
   About 1,000 anti-government dissidents staged a peaceful protest
at a Seoul college campus to urge the pope to speak out on alleged
human rights abuses in South Korea. Some 1,000 riot police
surrounded the campus but made no move to halt the protest.
   John Paul arrived in Seoul after flying across the Soviet Union
for the first time and sending greetings by radio to Soviet
President Mikhail S. Gorbachev in a sign of recently improved
Vatican-Soviet relations. The pope expressed hope he would soon
visit Moscow.
   After being greeted with a bugle and drum fanfare by
scarlet-clad bandsman and young women in traditional silk dresses
waving white and yellow papal flags, the pope immediately took up
the issue of Korean reunification that has divided the influential
Catholic community in South Korea.
   Addressing himself to the ``dear people of Korea'' John Paul
said:
   ``In the face of the tragic division which continues to separate
your own people, do you not have the urgent mission to prove to a
world torn by mistrust, strife and hatred that mankind does have
the resources to end division and war, and to forge an enduring
peace?''
   ``Those resources are yours: the spiritual values of mutual
trust and reconciliation, of selfless generosity and brotherly
love,'' he said.
   The Korean peninsula, divided in 1945, is the site of one of the
world's most bitter ideological confrontations, with the capitalist
South locked in a struggle for domination with the totalitarian
North. The two sides, who fought to a bloody stalemate in the
1950-53 Korean War, frequently clash and maintain huge armies along
their narrow 150-mile border.
   North and South Korea are still technically at war since no
peace treaty was signed at the end of the Korean War in 1953.
   ``You yourselves are witnesses of the painful divisions that
affect your own people,'' he said. ``You are searching for a
solution.''
   A heated debate broke out in the Catholic community after a
dissident priest visited North Korea in July to escort home a
radical college student. The two claimed the trip was to promote
unification, but the Seoul government called it an illegal contact
with an enemy state.
   The priest and student were arrested when they crossed back
across the border. Three other priests were jailed for organizing
the priest's trip without government approval.
   Security was extremely tight today with hundreds of police and
security agents guarding the pope. Worshipers attending a Mass
given by the pope at a Seoul church had to pass through metal
detectors and other searches and police guarded surrounding streets.
   The dissidents who held a peaceful protest at Sogang University
urged the pope to denounce the government of President Roh Tae-woo
for what they said were human rights abuses. Protesters applauded
as a student leader said the government's claims to have introduced
democracy were false.
   But most South Koreans agree there have been major political
reforms, and the dissidents have little public support.
   In later remarks, during a Mass in a gymnastics hall where the
1988 Olympic Games were staged, the pope urged young people to
reject violence and hatred. South Korea's radicals have been
criticized for their willingness to stage violent protests.
   After South Korea, the pope goes on to Indonesia and a
controversial stop in East Timor, and then to the Indian Ocean
island nation of Mauritius before returning to Rome Oct. 16.
   The trip is the Polish-born pope's 44th foreign pilgrimage and
the first time he flew over Soviet territory. Alitalia, the Italian
airline that provided the pope's jumbo jet, first sought to fly
over China.
   But when Beijing's Communist government refused, the airline
received permission from Moscow.
   As the Boeing 747 flew over the Soviet capital, the pilot
radioed a message from the pope to the Kremlin, said Vatican
spokesman Joaquin Navarro.
   Addressed to Gorbachev, the leader of a party which has
historically disparaged religion, the message from the leader of
the world's 850 million Roman Catholics said:
   ``Flying over the territory of the Union of Soviet Socialist
Republics on my way to a pastoral visit to several Asian countries,
I want to greet your excellency and assure you of my best wishes
for the wellbeing and prosperity of your fellow citizens.''

   Sotheby's loaned Australian businessman Alan
Bond half of the record $53.9 million he paid for Vincent van
Gogh's ``Irises'' in 1987, a spokeswoman for the famed auction
house said.
   Bond has repaid ``significantly more than half'' of the
approximately $27 million he borrowed, Sotheby's spokeswoman Diana
Levitt said Friday.
   She declined to discuss the terms of the loan but said the
auction house has offered loans to its clients for at least 10
years.
   ``There's nothing new here,'' she said. ``Our loan service is
something we are delighted to provide to our clients. We do it
carefully and conservatively.''
   Many in the art world had through the market for fine art would
suffer after the Oct. 19, 1987, crash of the stock market, but
those concerns were laid aside when Bond bought ``Irises'' the next
month at a price that remains unsurpassed for a piece of art.
   Levitt denied assertions by some in the art industry that the
loan for ``Irises'' fueled the skyrocketing prices in the art world.
   ``The art market is very strong,'' Levitt said.
   She said that of the top nine artworks auctioned at huge prices,
only ``Irises'' was financed. Rival auction house Christie's has
said it declines to finance purchases.
   Levitt noted that three potential buyers were vying for
``Irises'' when the bidding reached the $40 million level. The
painting was made in 1889 while van Gogh was living in a mental
asylum in the south of France. He died the following year.

<HEAD>Barrier Island Bridge Repair Like Christmas in October</HEAD>

<DATELINE>CHARLESTON, S.C. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The reopening of the storm-racked Sawyer
Bridge was like Christmas in October, says the mayor of an island
that has been cut off from traffic since it was savaged by
Hurricane Hugo.
   The swing bridge was partly reopened Friday, easing life for
residents who had been forced to make limited boat trips to the
Isle of Palms and Sullivans Island to survey the storm damage and
salvage their possessions.
   ``I kind of felt like a kid waiting for Christmas,'' said
Sullivans Island Mayor C. Melvin Anderegg. ``I felt like it was
never going to come.''
   In other developments, President Bush boosted the federal
government's pledged contribution to recovery efforts, and South
Carolina raised its estimate of the storm's damage toll to $4
billion to $5 billion.
   Hugo hit the at Charleston coast on Sept. 21 with 135 mph winds,
squashing scores of buildings and leaving thousands without
electricity and other necessities. The storm killed 29 people on
the U.S. mainland and 33 in the Caribbean.
   Hugo twisted a span of the Ben Sawyer Bridge awry and left one
end dangling into the Intracoastal Waterway. Raised and reconnected
at a cost of $1 million, the only road link to the two barrier
islands was opened Friday to one lane of traffic, with the
direction switching every two hours during daylight.
   The first motorist to cross was Carmen Bunch, mayor of Isle of
Palms, who welcomed the respite from awkward boat trips to her home.
   ``It was wonderful not to have to climb over rocks, not to have
to climb over docks and then get into a car,'' Ms. Bunch said.
   Added Karen Brown of Sullivans Island: ``It was nice not to be
wet coming home. ... We just wanted to get home and check on the
cats.''
   Traffic was limited to residents of the islands or people with
business there, said Highway Patrol Capt. H.G. Holloman.
   Engineers were still inspecting the bridge, and hadn't
determined when it could be opened to allow boats to pass.
   Also Friday, the White House announced the federal government
would shoulder a larger share of the relief burden than is normal
under rules of the Federal Emergency Management Agency.
   Washington will pay 75 percent of all eligible costs up to $34
million, and above that amount it will pay all costs, according to
the White House.
   FEMA normally pays 75 percent of repairs to roads, bridges,
publicly held utilities, parks and certain non-profit facilities,
with state state and local governments picking up the rest.
   The change will save state and local governments in South
Carolina at least $20 million, said Gov. Carroll Campbell.
   Damage in South Carolina had been conservatively estimated at $3
billion, but on Thursday, Campbell announced that experts had
revised that upward to $4 billion to $5 billion. The new estimate
was based on discussions with county officials, state department
chiefs and emergency management officials, said Campbell's
spokesman, Tucker Eskew.

<HEAD>Government Employee Seeks to Defect to Soviet Union, Newspaper Says</HEAD>
<DATELINE>JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A government employee
apparently seeking to defect to the Soviet Union has traveled to
London and was staying with Soviet officials, a pro-government
newspaper reported today.
   Susan Dobson, who worked for the Bureau for Information, left
her job in neighboring Namibia on Sept. 24 and met with officials
at the Soviet observer mission in the territory before going to
London, according to The Citizen.
   The newspaper, citing unidentified sources, said Ms. Dobson was
``with the Russians in London.'' The Citizen also said that the
26-year-old woman probably had access to ``sensitive information.''
   Meanwhile, the woman's father, A.E. Millson, confirmed that his
daughter was in London but denied that she was trying to defect,
according to The Saturday Star of Johannesburg.
   ``We are convinced she suffered a mental breakdown,'' Millson
was quoted as saying by The Star.
   The Bureau of Information said, ``Ms. Dobson has not yet given
any reason for her behaviour to the ... authorities.''
   ``She was very tense and emotionally upset during Saturday
afternoon (Sept. 23) preceding her departure,'' the bureau said in
a statement Friday.
   The bureau said Mrs. Dobson, who helped prepare press releases,
had been fired.
   The independent South African Press Association quoted
unidentified sources as saying that Ms. Dobson traveled with a
foreign television crew to northern Namibia Sept. 20, then shunned
colleagues when she returned three days later to Windhoek, the
territorial capital.
   She spent the night at a U.N. military base, and the following
day was taken to the Soviet mission, the press association said.
   Afterward, she called her husband in South Africa. They met in
Botswana and flew to Britain, the report added.
   Officials of the U.N. monitoring force in Namibia could not
immediately be reached for comment. South Africa, which has ruled
Namibia for 74 years, has agreed to grant the territory
independence under a U.N.-monitored process including elections
next month for a national assembly.

   Costa Rican President Oscar Arias
Sanchez warned against U.S. military action against Panamanian
leader Manuel Antonio Noriega, and said all of Central America
desperately needs economic growth.
   ``It is true that he is a despot,'' Arias said Friday. ``It is
true that he is a shame to the whole of Latin America. But I simply
could not be in favor of military action. I think the Panamanians
will take care of him. I think we need to be a little bit patient.''
   Arias, on a visit to attract investment by electronics companies
in Costa Rica, urged economic sanctions against Panama. He said
Gen. Noriega, Panama's de facto military leader, already was
diplomatically isolated.
   ``The minute you send in your Marines, Noriega will have more
solidarity from the rest of the Latin American countries,'' Arias
said. ``It is the wrong thing to do.''
   Arias, the 1987 Nobel Peace Prize winner for his efforts to
bring peace to Central America, chided members of Congress who
criticized President Bush for not using the full strength of the
12,000-man U.S. military force in Panama to help rebellious
officers in the failed coup attempt on Tuesday.
   ``The problem is there are some people here in Washington who
never read past history,'' Arias said.
   Arias met with leaders of many high-technology companies at a
business luncheon and toured an Apple Computer Co. plant before
speaking at a dinner held by the World Affairs Council of Northern
California and the World Forum of Silicon Valley.
   Arias said most countries in Latin America that have been trying
to develop democracy are struggling with their economies and need
U.S. assistance.
   ``We should not be trapped into waiting for political
development before economic change takes place,'' Arias said.
``Democracy is certainly indispensable for peace, but so are
economic growth and justice.''
   Unless the region's debt problems are resolved, he said, ``we
are inviting dictators to come back.''

<TEXT>
   Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev today met
with East German leader Erich Honecker, a day after encouraging the
hard-line government in East Berlin to work with ``all forces in
society.''
   Gorbachev was in East Berlin during the country's 40th
anniversary celebrations, which have been overshadowed by the
exodus of nearly 50,000 refugees who fled to the West in search of
greater freedom and opportunity.
   In a brief dispatch, the state-run news agency ADN said the two
leaders had started their meeting but did not describe the
substance of the talks.
   In a formal address the night before, Gorbachev said: ``There is
no doubt that the Socialist Unity Party (East German Communist
Party) has the intellectual potential, rich experience and
political authority to cooperate with all forces in society to
answer the questions placed on today's agenda.''
   The mass-circulation Bild newspaper in West Germany said Friday
that Gorbachev planned to encourage Honecker to make several
changes, including easing travel restrictions for East Germans and
allowing greater freedom of expression. Honecker has been unwilling
to implement the economic and political reforms now under way in
the Soviet Union, Poland and Hungary.
   For the third straight day, East Germany today barred Western
tourists from entering Communist East Berlin, also erecting three
barriers at the crossing called Checkpoint Charlie by the Western
allies.
   The 6-foot-tall barriers were set up overnight on the East
German side of the checkpoint. They apparently are designed to stop
protests similar to those Aug. 13, the anniversary of the start of
construction of the Berlin Wall, when demonstrators tried to lie
down on the dividing line between the two sectors and hurled
objects at East German border police.
   ``East Germany apparently fears that regime-critics coming from
West Germany could disturb the 40th anniversary celebrations,''
said West Germany's ARD television.
   The Soviet leader, who was to return home later today, was
hailed by youths who shouted ``Gorby! Gorby!'' as he stood beside
Honecker during a three-hour Communist youth parade.
   Many have said democratic change might stem the westward flow of
East German youth and avoid divisions among the East bloc nations.
   East Germany's leaders wanted the anniversary to portray their
country as a socialist success.
   ``All of our energy and loyalty to the German Democratic
Republic,'' read one of the parade banners. But the exodus of
thousands of its citizens to the West from embassies in
Czechoslovakia and Poland, and violent clashes between East Germans
and police have focused world attention on the country's turmoil.
   To squelch any possible protests during the anniversary, the
Communist leadership stepped up security nationwide.
   Church sources today said police arrested eight members of the
country's leading opposition group, New Forum.
   Unconfirmed reports said the government was mounting barbed wire
fences on the border with neighboring Poland and Czechoslovakia,
which East German refugees used as stepping stones to the West.
   West Germany's ZDF television said a caller from East Germany
said Friday barbed wire was being strung along the frontier with
Czechoslovakia. The newspaper Die Welt said East German authorities
were preparing to build fences along the Polish border.
   As anniversary festivities were about to begin in East Germany
Friday, a train carrying more than 600 disgruntled citizens rolled
into West Germany from Warsaw. The same number crossed into Austria
from Hungary early today.
   Thousands more traveled to the West earlier in the week aboard
other trains after East Germany, in what seemed an attempt to
polish its image, set free refuge-seekers camping at West German
embassies in Prague and Warsaw.
   In a formal address late Friday before the East German
leadership, Gorbachev said the East German Communist Party can
manage the country's own affairs.
   ``We have heard demands such as the U.S.S.R. should take down
the Berlin Wall and then people could believe in its (the Soviets')
peaceful aims,'' said Gorbachev. ``Our Western partners should
understand that questions regarding the GDR (East Germany) are not
solved in Moscow but in Berlin.''
   But without being specific, Gorbachev also called on the
authoritarian leadership to reach out to all elements in society.
   ``There is no doubt that (East Germany's Communist Party) has
the intellectual potential, rich experience and political authority
to cooperate with all forces in society to answer the questions
placed on today's agenda,'' he said.
   The Soviet leader defended Moscow's reforms.
   In his own address, Honecker, the 77-year-old East German leader
who has run the country for more than 18 years, reaffirmed the
country's hard line and condemned what he said were international
efforts aimed at the ``destabilization of socialism.''

   Thousands of Soviets marched to the walls of the
Kremlin today to show support for Boris N. Yeltsin and two other
parliamentarians they claim are threatened by hard-line Communist
Party bureaucrats.
   The protest, held on Constitution Day, a Soviet holiday, was
also staged to demand that the civil and human rights enshrined in
the 1977 Soviet Constitution be observed.
   In a near-freezing drizzle, members and sympathizers of the
grassroots pro-democracy Russian People's Front linked hands at 11
a.m. to form a human chain that stretched for miles along Gorky
Street, the main artery leading from the Kremlin to Moscow's
northwestern suburbs.
   Demonstrators carried placards defending Yeltsin, Moscow's
outspoken representative in the Soviet Congress, and two state
prosecutors in the Congress, Telman Gdlyan and Nikolai Ivanov, who
have alleged corruption at the party's highest levels involving
Politburo member Yegor K. Ligachev.
   Yeltsin, the former Communist Party boss in Moscow, came under
attack late last month in the party daily Pravda for allegedly
going on a drinking and buying spree while visiting the United
States.
   Pravda later apologized to Yeltsin, saying those charges, made
in an Italian newspaper article that Pravda reprinted, could not be
substantiated. But to Soviets, the affair was more proof that the
party apparatus was out to get the 58-year-old Communist maverick
who has opposed privileges received by the party elite and called
for a better life for the average Soviet.
   In the case of Gdlyan and Ivanov, the party's policy-making
Central Committee has ordered the Moscow party organization to take
action against them for making the charges against Ligachev, which
the Soviet prosecutor-general's office said have no basis.
   ``Yeltsin, Gdlyan and Ivanov are our conscience!'' said one
hand-lettered poster carried by a Gorky Street protester.
   In leaflets distributed throughout the Soviet capital, the
People's Front had called for Muscovites to line Gorky Street from
central Moscow to the suburban city of Zelenograd, which Gdlyan
represents in the Congress, but organizers said bad weather kept
participation down.
   Nevertheless, knots of protesters were seen as far away as
Sheremetyevo Airport, Moscow's international airport 20 miles from
the Kremlin.
   After making the human chain, 3,000 demonstrators marched to a
paved square on Marx Prospekt between the Kremlin's high, red-brick
walls and the former quarters of Moscow State University, which now
house its journalism school.
   Huddled under umbrellas, they listened to People's Front leaders
make speeches through bullhorns, then marched back up Gorky Street
to Pushkin Square to take part in another demonstration calling for
an end to government restrictions on emigration.
   The protests occurred while President Mikhail S. Gorbachev was
in East Germany to attend ceremonies marking the country's 40th
anniversary. Yeltsin first got in trouble with Gorbachev for
claiming the president's program of economic and political reforms
was being implemented too slowly.

   Premier Miklos Nemeth today urged the
old guard of the Communist Party to leave if they object to
far-reaching reforms. A ranking hard-liner said the Communist
system should be preserved.
   Nemeth, one of the key supporters of reform, told 1,274
delegates at a party congress that the new democratic leftist party
he wants to create from the current Communist Party has no room
``for those who have blood on their hands'' from past Communist
excesses.
   ``Those who feel unwell here should form their own party,'' he
declared to applause from the reformist faction at the congress.
``It's now possible to do that.''
   Nemeth was alluding to Hungary's new commitment to political
plurality as it institutes reforms that put it at the forefront of
change within the Soviet bloc along with Poland.
   The Communist leadership has agreed to permit the country's
first free elections in 41 years by June at the latest and has said
it will abide by the results even if the party is voted out of
power.
   Delegates at the congress, which began Friday, are considering
proposals to terminate their party's 70-year existence and replace
it with a new one drawing heavily on social democratic ideals _
similar to leftist parties in Western Europe.
   Hard-liners, by contrast, want to tinker with the existing party
but reject founding a new one. Former Politburo member Janos
Berecz, an opponent of far-reaching reforms who lost his post in
recent infighting, spoke bitterly of his reform-minded rivals today.
   ``I want to conserve my Communist past,'' he declared, adding
that differences with Imre Pozsgay, the leading reformer along with
Nemeth in the four-man Communist leadership, ``truly put us in
different parties.''
   ``You can tie me to the stake, but you can't do that to the
720,000 party members represented by the delegates,'' said Berecz.
   Committed hard-liners numbered less than 100 at the congress,
but reformists said the old-guard members are actively trying to
enlist the support of the more than 700 delegates not committed to
either camp before crucial voting on whether to found a new party
and on top party positions.
   A splinter group of orthodox Communist radicals called the HSWP
Marxist Unity Front claimed in a leaflet made available to
reporters that they had majority support.
   Party Chairman Rezsoe Nyers _ a moderate who was chosen to
bridge differences among the four-man leadership _ appeared to side
with Pozsgay and Nemeth Friday in urging the delegates to
effectively terminate the old party.
   ``It is my belief that the new party cannot be communist,'' said
Nyers. ``The new party also cannot simply be a social democratic
one.''
   Nyers said the congress should give birth to a new party that
combines communism with social democratic beliefs. He did not
elaborate.
   Today Nyers, one of the prime candidates for the post of
chairman of the new party, told Hungarian radio he would accept the
post providing the congress adopts a political platform he agrees
with.
   He said he expected ``those opposed to Democratic Socialism to
split off _ but anything may happen yet'' at the congress.
   The Communists have lost a series of parliamentary by-elections
in recent months _ a worrisome development for the party as it
prepares for the multiparty election.
   A Central Committee draft document made available to reporters
on the future party's philosophical makeup said ``Democratic
Socialism'' would mean the party would support:
   _Creation of a democratic constitutional state
   _A multiparty system
   _Referendums and other instruments of direct democracy
   _Prevention of excessive centralization of power
   _A freely elected Parliament
   _Election of a president to strengthen the balance between the
branches of power, and of a government responsible to Parliament.
   The process of instituting bolder social and economic changes
began slowly about two years ago, but gained steam after the
ousting of Janos Kadar in May 1988 after 32 years of leadership.
   The pace of reform in recent months has at times moved Hungary
ahead of Poland, the only Soviet bloc country not dominated by
Communists.
   Hungary has alienated three repressive Warsaw Pact allies _ East
East Germany, Romania and Czechoslovakia _ with its reformist
policies, including its decision to allow East Germans in Hungary
free passage to the West.

<TEXT>
   The International Committee of the Red
Cross suspended operations in this southern port city today after
two Swiss relief workers were kidnapped, a Red Cross official said.
   ``Our operations have been suspended in Sidon pending the
release of our two abducted comrades,'' said Mohammed Bizri, the
Lebanese representive of the Red Cross in Sidon.
   The announcement came a day after masked gunmen grabbed Emanuel
Cristen, 32, and Elio Elliquez, 23, shoved them into a car trunk
and drove toward a suburban Palestinian refugee camp. The two were
orthopedic technicians who helped fit artificial limbs for victims
of Lebanon's 14-year-old civil war.
   The pair were kidnapped outside a Red Cross center near the
refugee camp of Ein el-Hilweh on Sidon's southeastern outskirts.
   Bizri said the center was closed indefinitely and ``all Swiss
Red Cross'' officials based in Sidon were withdrawn to Beirut.
   It was the second time within a year that the Red Cross withdrew
from some operations in Lebanon. It withdrew all 31 Swiss nationals
from the country following the November 1988 kidnapping of Swiss
relief worker Peter Winkler. Winkler was freed a month later, and
Swiss workers returned only after receiving assurances from all
sides in Lebanon that there would be no more attacks on
humanitarian organizations.
   ``Contacts are under way on all levels to help win release of
the two Swiss officials but we still have no word on their
whereabouts or who is holding them,'' Bizri said.
   No group claimed reponsibility for the abduction, the latest in
a series targeting humanitarian workers in south Lebanon. Previous
kidnappings were blamed on a radical guerrilla faction headed by
Palestinian Abu Nidal.
   Abu Nidal is the nom de guerre of Sabri al-Banna, who broke from
Yasser Arafat's mainstream Fatah faction in 1973 and set up a rival
group called Fatah-Revolutionary Council.
   The Palestine Liberation Organization, which governs Ein
el-Hilweh, and a Sidon-based Sunni Moslem militia have vowed to
track down the kidnappers.
   PLO spokesman Zeid Wehbeh had pledged to ``spare no effort'' to
help rescue the men.
   A Fatah guerrilla who identified himself only as Amer said all
exits of Ein el-Hilweh were under constant surveillance to prevent
the kidnappers from trying to smuggle out the Swiss captives.
   Moein Shabaita, a spokesman for Fatah faction, the PLO's main
group, linked the kidnappings to a Lebanese Shiite Moslem, Mohammed
Hariri, jailed for life in Switzerland in February for hijacking an
Air Afrique jetliner. A French passenger was killed in the July 24,
1987 hijacking.
   Shabaita said Christen and Erriquez were kidnapped, ``apparently
for the purpose of trying to win Hariri's release.''
   Eighteen Westerners, including eight Americans, are missing in
Lebanon. Most are believed captives of Shiite Moslems loyal to Iran.
   The longest held is Terry Anderson, chief Middle East
correspondent of The Associated Press, who was kidnapped March 16,
1985.
   At least 10 relief workers _ British, West Germans,
Scandinavians, Belgians and Swiss _ have been abducted in southern
Lebanon in the past two years. All but two have been freed.
   In Beirut, acting Prime Minister Salim Hoss today condemned the
latest abduction as ``a cowardly act harmful to our country and
society.''
   Hoss said in a statement that he had ordered police forces in
south Lebanon to ``make every possible effort'' to help win release
of the captives.

<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Bette Davis, the two-time Oscar winner whose
expressive eyes and haughty, cigarette-smoking style made her a
movie legend, died here after a long battle with cancer. She was 81.
   An official with the American Hospital of Paris, Philippe
Duprat, said Miss Davis died Friday night.
   The actress, who lived in West Hollywood, Calif., was traveling
through Paris on her way home from the San Sebastian Film Festival
in Spain, where she was honored for a lifetime of achievement.
   Miss Davis _ who appeared in more than 80 films, including
``Jezebel,'' ``All About Eve,'' and ``Of Human Bondage'' _ died
after a battle with breast cancer that began after a 1983
mastectomy, said her attorney, Harold Schiff.
   ``The doctors had told us the cancer had spread, that it was
terminal,'' he said. ``The doctors had said let her go on going
about her business.''
   ``What a loss,'' said actress Olivia de Havilland, who worked
with Miss Davis in four films including the 1964 ``Hush, Hush Sweet
Charlotte.''
   ``She was a remarkable person to work with, highly professional,
innovative, brilliant and quick,'' said Miss de Havilland, 73, who
resides in Paris. ``She was very well disciplined. I thought she
had some marvelous personal qualities and I was very fond of her.''
   Vincent Price, who worked with Miss Davis on ``The Private Lives
of Elizabeth and Essex'' in 1939 and ``Whales of August'' in 1987,
mourned her as a film genius.
   ``There are very few people left who really sum up the motion
picture industry, who had that star quality. It was really rare,''
Price said in Los Angeles. ``She had extraordinary energy; she was
a genius.''
   At a Sept. 21 news conference in San Sebastian, she joked about
co-stars James Stewart _ ``I never should have let him get away'' _
and Ronald Reagan _ ``He never had much talent but as President he
restored patriotism for Americans.''
   Of her expressive eyes, she said: ``It's my basic facial feature
and what communicated to the camera.''
   Miss Davis was nominated for Academy Awards 10 times and won two
best actress Oscars, for ``Dangerous'' in 1935 and ``Jezebel'' in
1938. She won an Emmy in 1979 for the television production
``Strangers _ The Story of a Mother and Daughter.''
   Her screen heroines were often strong women _ as uncompromising
as the actress was off-screen and on the set, according to those
who worked with her.
   ``The person who wants to make it has to sweat,'' she said once.
``There are no short cuts. And you've got to have the guts to be
hated. That's the hardest part.''
   She gave no one credit for her success except Bette Davis.
   ``The most rewarding thing in the world when you've made it,''
she said, ``is that you don't owe nobody nothin' ... The reward is
an honest day's work.''
   She once suggested the lines for her own epitaph: ``Bette Davis
_ She Did It the Hard Way.'' That included her 1985 comeback from
the mastectomy, a stroke and a broken hip in quick succession.
   Her success story was one of Hollywood's most unlikely tales.
Lacking the looks of a traditional Hollywood glamour girl, the
skinny youngster with the huge eyes relied on her acting skill and
took roles nobody else wanted, playing nasty women more often than
nice ones.
   ``My entire career was never based on looks or glamour or sex,''
she once said. ``It was an absolute miracle that people came to
watch me act.''
   Impressionists copied her mannerisms, and a song, ``Bette Davis
Eyes,'' was a rock hit in 1982. The line most identified with her
was ``What a dump!'' from ``Beyond the Forest.''
   She sought happiness in marriage, but after four husbands she
declared that she had failed and would never marry again. When she
wrote her 1962 autobiography, she titled it ``The Lonely Life.''
   She was born Ruth Elizabeth Davis on April 5, 1908 in Lowell,
Mass., the elder of two daughters of Harlow and Ruth Favor Davis.
Her parents were descended from early New England settlers _
Pilgrims and Huguenots _ and Miss Davis was always proud of her
heritage.
   A friend of her mother's felt two Ruths in the family were too
many. She suggested the young Miss Davis be called Bette, after a
character in the Balzac novel ``La Cousine Bette.''
   Miss Davis' parents separated when she was 7, and through her
childhood she lived alternately with her mother and in boarding
schools. As a teen-ager she showed talent in school theatrics and
decided to become an actress.
   She won a scholarship to study with drama coach John Murray
Anderson, ushered at New England theaters in the summer and won
small roles in stock company shows before making her New York stage
debut in ``The Earth Between'' in the 1920s.

   A nursing home fire that killed nine
patients and injured nearly 100 was caused by one of its victims _
a 78-year-old smoker who accidentally tossed a match on his bed
when he missed a trash can.
   Authorities said Friday that despite the high death toll, they
considered it lucky more people weren't killed in the fire that
broke out late Thursday in the four-story Hillhaven Rehabilitation
and Convalescent Center.
   Thick, black smoke from burning foam rubber mattresses filled
the hallways, hampering evacuation already made difficult by the
frail condition of many of the patients, said Fire Chief Thomas E.
Gardner.
   ``The real problem was the smoke and the fragileness of the
elderly residents' lungs,'' Gardner said. The dead were eight women
and one man, ranging in age from 65 to 97.
   Seven of the injured were listed in critical condition this
morning at Sentara Norfolk General Hospital. Ninety-eight residents
were treated after the fire for smoke inhalation, said Don Haupt,
administrator of the city's Paramedical Rescue Service.
   The fire broke out in the second-floor room of Major Leary, 78,
said Capt. Herbert Redfield, chief of Fire Investigations. Smoking
is prohibited in rooms at the home, but Leary, who was recuperating
from hip problems, had been caught with cigarettes the night of the
blaze, said Jeffrey M. McKain, Hillhaven Corp. vice president.
Smoking is allowed in lounges and public areas.
   ``He was asked last night if he had cigarettes and he said no,''
McKain said Friday. ``But it's easy for a determined patient to get
around rules.''
   A nurse checked Room 226 about 10 p.m. and found Leary sitting
in a chair near the foot of his bed and his roommate asleep,
Redfield said.
   As investigators reconstruct the scene, Leary lit a cigarette
and tossed the match toward a metal trash can about three inches
from the foot of the bed, Redfield said. The match landed on the
bed, setting the covers and mattress ablaze.
   Leary was among those who died in the fire.
   Gardner, the fire chief, said there probably would have been
fewer deaths if there had been fire sprinklers at the nursing home.
But he said the home met all building codes when it was built in
1969 and had passed two state inspections this year.
   Gardner said that further deaths were prevented by several
factors: strong fire walls and fire resistant doors, quick response
by more than 100 Norfolk firefighters and paramedics, the use of a
giant pressurized ventilation system that pumped fresh air through
the building _ and plain luck.
   ``We were just lucky,'' Gardner said. ``Lucky more didn't die.''

   Maxim's, Beijing's best-known symbol of Western
bourgeois elegance, will reopen at the end of the month, five
months after it closed following the military crackdown on the
pro-democracy movement.
   French manager Song Huaigui said Saturday the restaurant, a
popular spot for well-heeled foreigners since it opened in central
Beijing in 1983, will resume its dinner service but for the time
being will remain closed at lunch.
   The restaurant is a joint venture by the French and Chinese.
   ``Now we are not certain about how business will be, but we hope
that foreigners will come back and business will slowly get back to
normal,'' Ms. Song said.
   She said the restaurant has lost more than $800,000 since it was
closed.
   The area around Maxim's, about a mile southeast of Tiananmen
Square, was racked by violence June 3-4 when the military shot its
way into the city and recaptured the square from students
demonstrating for democracy.
   Maxim's closed immediately after the crackdown as most foreign
business people left China and the tourist trade dried up.

   The opposition Labor party voted at its

21 to 16, the legal age for heterosexuals.
   The vote Friday was 3.7 million to 2.3 million.
   The age of consent is the minimum age at which a person may
legally have sexual intercourse.
   During a Thursday debate on the matter, party member Debbie
Epstein, a supporter of the Labor Campaign for Lesbian and Gay
Rights, said: ``Equality shouldn't be a difficult concept for
socialists to grasp.''
   Labor's policy-making National Executive Committee will decide
whether the proposal will be included in the party's election
manifesto.
   The governing Conservatives must call general elections before
mid-1992.

   Typhoon Angela battered the
mountainous northern Philippines Saturday and forced more than
8,500 people to flee their homes for evacuation centers, officials
said.
   Initial reports reaching relief agencies in Manila said the
storm injured four people, damaged or destroyed 34 houses in three
northern provinces, uprooted about $75,000 worth of crops and
caused extensive flooding.
   The storm then headed out of the country toward mainland China.
   The Philippine military Office of Civil Defense said about 2,003
families, or 8,846 people, were forced to leave their homes and
stay in evacuation centers in Ilocos Norte province on the northern
tip of the main Luzon island.
   A spokesman for the office said most of its provincial chapters
failed to give reports because the typhoon toppled many electrical
and telephone posts.
   Detailed damage and casualty reports from remote areas often
take days or weeks to reach the capital due to poor communications.

   Chairman Akio Morita of Sony Corp. grew up in a
wealthy family surrounded by the best technology of the 1920s and
1930s: A Victor phonograph, a Westinghouse refrigerator and a Buick
sedan.
   He went to American movies. ``King Kong'' was a favorite.
   Today, his company not only sets a high standard for consumer
electronics around the world, it owns America's largest record
company and is buying a major Hollywood motion picture studio.
   Sony's plan to pay $3.4 billion to take over Columbia Pictures,
following its buyout of CBS Records in 1987, has some Americans
worried a Japanese company is taking over the popular cultural
heart of the country.
   But the friendly takeover is only the latest in decades of
international investment by a company that has proved its
sophistication in operating around the world.
   Morita helped found a tiny company in the basement of a
bombed-out department store in 1946 and its early attempts at an
electric rice cooker failed.
   Morita himself, trained as a physicist, struggled to paste
together paper hand-painted with magnetic material to use as tape
in Japan's first tape recorder. Postwar shortages made plastic
unavailable.
   But when in the 1950s Sony bought the rights to an American
invention called the transistor and used it in ways its originators
never imagined _ in radios _ the Sony reputation for innovation was
born.
   In the 1960s Sony transformed video tape recorders, also an
American invention, from huge machines run with vacuum tubes to
compact transistorized models that became the professional standard.
   When it adapted those machines for home use in the 1970s, it
helped create the VCR and the culture of ``couch potatoes,'' people
who don't have to leave the house for entertainment.
   In the 1980s Sony's Walkman became a symbol of self-absorbed
joggers, commuters and other yuppies. Today its superlight
camcorders help parents capture their children's first steps on
video and tiny Watchman VCRs let them watch movies on the run.
   Now, with its foray into music and movies, Sony may be putting
its stamp on America of the 1990s as well. But Sony says it wants
to keep the American style of the software it's buying.
   ``Globally, U.S. (entertainment) software is the most
influential,'' Morita said at a recent news conference. ``Columbia
Pictures and CBS Records will remain in the hands of American
management.''
   ``Our motto is global localization,'' he said, and industry
analysts say it's more than an empty slogan.
   Almost half of Sony's 78,900 employees are local people in its
27 overseas factories in places ranging from San Diego to Singapore
to Bridgend, England.
   Sixty-six percent of its sales are outside Japan, and so is much
of its production. Sony began manufacturing in the United States in
the 1970s, long before the recent wave of Japanese investment there.
   Almost all of the televisions Sony sells in the United States
are made locally and 20 percent of its San Diego production is for
export.
   Sony's Bridgend plant exports components all over Europe, and in
1987 won a British government award for exports.
   Industry analysts say Sony's style as well as its structure is
far more international than most Japanese companies. Considered an
upstart by old-line Japanese firms, Sony has an anti-hierarchical
and risk-taking style that sets it apart.
   Morita sets the tone. One of the few true founding entrepreneurs
still heading a major company in a country where most presidents
are merely employees, Morita hawked transistor radios to retailers
in New York and had to fight the image of poor-quality that ``made
in Japan'' meant at the time.
   He has a thick shock of white hair and speaks English with a
fluency few senior Japanese businessmen can boast. Morita, 68, is
blunt by Japanese standards, or even by American ones.
   His recent book, ``The Japan That Can Say `No,''' co-authored
with conservative politician Shintaro Ishihara, caused a stir in
Washington for the way it pulls no punches in the U.S.-Japan
economic debate. Morita has long warned that the United States must
revitalize its electronics industry by investing more in research
and development.
   Morita this year handed over daily management of Sony to its
president, Norio Ohga, an opera singer by training who was hired
because of his frank criticism of Sony's tape recorders when he was
a student in the 1950s.
   Ohga is expected to lead the company beyond its roots in
consumer electronics and into a diversified range of products from
software to industrial electronics.
   The company's sales jumped 38 percent to $16.3 billion in the
year ended March 31, and profits nearly doubled to $549 million.
After several hard years when its Betamax video system gradually
lost out to the VHS standard made by other companies, Sony is back
in full force, analysts say.
   Last year Sony spent more than $1 billion on research and
development, or about 7 percent of sales.

<HEAD>U.S. Weighs More Sanctions Against Panama</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GEORGE GEDDA</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Bush refuses to rule out military
action to oust Panamanian Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega, but the next
U.S. moves are more likely to involve dollars than bullets.
   The new economic strictures under consideration to step up
pressure on Noriega include the withholding of about $1.5 million
in taxes paid monthly to his government on behalf of Panamanian
employees of U.S. agencies, officials said.
   The officials, who asked not to be identified, said discussions
about new sanctions against Panama began well before the failed
coup attempt last Tuesday. According to the Treasury Department,
sanctions imposed to date have deprived Panama of about $400
million.
   Other economic measures under consideration, the officials said,
include limiting even further the payments U.S. companies operating
in Panama can make to the government and prohibiting
Panamanian-flag vessels from using U.S. ports. It was not clear
what such additional sanctions would cost Panama.
   Not all the options under discussion are economic in nature.
   Administration officials have sounded out congressional
intelligence committees on the possibility of U.S. covert actions
against Noriega but none has been approved, said the sources, who
declined to be more specific.
   Bush talked briefly to reporters Friday and defended his
decision not to commit U.S. forces to aid Panamanian rebels during
last Tuesday's coup attempt. When asked whether he might authorize
military action in the future, the president replied, ``I would not
rule out any option.''
   The administration is still convinced that a steady weakening of
the Panamanian economy will make Noriega's rule increasingly
untenable and eventually force his removal, the officials said.
   The economic decline Panama has suffered since early 1988 was
one of the factors cited by the coup plotters in justifying their
action, the sources noted.
   By a vote of 99-1, the Senate adopted a resolution proposed by
Sen. Sam Nunn, D-Ga., on Thursday that expressed support for Bush's
efforts to democratize Panama through a ``full range of economic,
diplomatic and military options.''
   But the administration does not appear intent on deviating too
far from the policy of economic denial and diplomatic pressure
instituted by former President Reagan 19 months ago.
   Among other measures, the United States has withheld payments to
Panama for canal operations and has frozen an estimated $300
million worth of Panamanian assets in U.S. banks. Some trade
benefits, including sugar exports, also have been denied.
   Bush has hoped these measures would damage the Panamanian
economy to the point that the Defense Forces would move against
Noriega. His actions last Tuesday at the time of the coup attempt
indicate a strong preference to limit direct U.S. military
involvement in efforts to oust Noriega.
   The administration is not contemplating a complete trade embargo
against Panama because that would put hundreds of U.S. companies
operating there out of business, the officials said.
   Bush has come under criticism from many members of Congress as
well as from some conservative outside government for not moving
more aggressively in support of the coup leaders last Tuesday.
   Former Assistant Secretary of State for Inter-American Affairs
Elliott Abrams said the U.S. policy of ``speeches and sanctions''
against Noriega is not enough.
   ``To borrow a slogan from Theodore Roosevelt, who was profoundly
involved in Panamanian affairs, it's time for the U.S. to speak
more softly but carry _ and contemplate using _ a big stick,''
Abrams says.
   But former Ambassador Sol Linowitz, who helped negotiate the
Panama Canal treaties, says that military action could put at risk
the 50,000 American citizens in Panama.
   ``The military option can't be done without significant
bloodshed,'' Linowitz told a reporter Thursday. He also opposes
additional sanctions because the ones already in place have
``destroyed the economy without budging Noriega.''
   Linowitz advocates reviving the diplomatic effort in the
Organization of American States _ suspended six weeks ago _ aimed
at negotiating a restoration of democratic rule in Panama.
   According to U.S. officials, there are about 18,000 Panamanians
working for the Panama Canal Commission and other U.S. agencies.
The $1.5 million the U.S. government pays to Panama on behalf of
the Panamanian employees of U.S. agencies ostensibly is used for
education and health care but American officials believe the funds
are used for other purposes.
   They acknowledged that the Panamanian government could retaliate
_ by withholding health and education benefits _ against employees
whose taxes are not paid by U.S. agencies.
   Noriega is said to need $30 million to $40 million a month to
run the government, and officials believe ways must be found to cut
into his income as much as possible without destroying the
Panamanian economy in the process.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Back in 1937, taking the oath of office for a
second time, President Franklin D. Roosevelt said he saw ``one
third of a nation ill-housed, ill-clad, ill-nourished.''
   Half a century later, with tens of thousands of Americans
marching on Washington to demand ``Housing Now!'' what percentage
are still ``ill-housed''?
   ``About one fourth,'' says Daniel Hoffman, research director of
the American Affordable Housing Institute at Rutgers University in
New Brunswick, N.J.
   ``About 24 million families are living in housing that the
government classifies as having a problem,'' said Hoffman. ``The
number of renters has gone up after declining for years and years,
and at the the same time the quality and quantity of the housing
stock of the country has declined, every year in every region.''
   About that there is little dispute. In a field swamped by
statistics and often contradictory studies, no argument exists over
the claim of the demonstrators: America has a housing problem.
   Agreement comes from James Christian, chief economist for the
U.S. League of Savings Institutions in Washington. But he declines
to compare the size of the problem to FDR's one third of a nation.
   ``Oh, Lord,'' he says. ``The estimates of this thing go from
hell to breakfast.''
   At the center of the problem, he puts the cost of land _
especially land where people want to build housing.
   ``Where there are jobs, there are higher incomes, and where
incomes are higher there are enough people who can afford to pay
for the privilege of using the land to push out of the market those
people who can't afford to pay,'' he says.
   ``Land is just a major part of the affordability problem.''
   Researcher Hoffman, a housing planner for 15 years, instead lays
the problem at two basic sources: a change in the federal
government's housing policies starting with Ronald Reagan's
inauguration in 1981 and a departure from the historic levels of
interest rates.
   Government policy affected housing for the poor, he says, and
high interest rates affected the middle class and made ``the
American Dream'' of home ownership remote for millions.
   With Reagan, says Hoffman, ``the federal government essentially
got out of the subsidized housing business. We're not building any
more subsidized housing. It declined with Jimmy Carter and stopped
with Reagan. In 1979, we were building 40,000 public housing units
for the poorest of the poor. Now, none, zero.
   ``And a change in the tax law in 1986 has reduced builders'
interest in unsubsidized rental construction.''
   As for interest rates for mortgage loans, they're running about
10 percent a year, give or take half a point, down from their
dramatic levels of 1982, lower than they have been in 15 years but
still high by historic measurement.
   ``This country wasn't built on 10 percent mortgages,'' Hoffman
says. ``People used to get mortages at 4{ percent and as recent as
the early 1970s, it was 7 percent.''
   He does some calculating, determines that a house with a
30-year, $80,000 mortage could be paid for at $530 a month when the
interest rate was 7 percent but requires $702 monthly at 10
percent.''
   Homebuilding, Hoffman says, is still a booming industry in
America, but what is being built typically is big, glitzy housing
on big lots in the suburbs for ``the trade-up market.''
   ``The median priced house (half costing more, half less) cannot
be afforded by the median-income family,'' says Hoffman.
   Bank economist Christian, on the other hand, waves away interest
costs as a major factor.
   ``Mortgage money is available today at lower rather than 10
years ago,'' he says. ``Cutting mortgage rates another percentage
point or two will not solve this problem. Every nickel you gain in
lower interest costs tends to be lost in higher land prices or
higher consturction costs.''
   Christian tries to picture the problem that brought
demonstrators to Washington as broader than a housing shortage.
   ``It's a whole social service delivery problem,'' he says.
``Housing just happens to be the most visible piece of that,
especially when you see somebody sleepoing on a grate.
   ``But it isn't necessarily a housing affordability problem if
that person doesn't have a job. Is it then an employment problem?
Look one step beyond that _ he may not have a job because he lacks
skills. Do we have an educational problem here?''

<HEAD>Catastrophic Health Roll-back Focuses Attention On Voting Power</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   America's elderly flexed their powerful
political muscles in turning Congress against Medicare's new
catastrophic health insurance program, but analysts say the notion
of a monolithic ``gray lobby'' that speaks with one voice is
largely myth.
   William Schneider of the American Enterprise Institute said the
rush in Congress to roll back the Medicare catastrophic program
enacted just a year earlier confirms the elderly ``hold sway over
Congress because of their voting power.''
   ``This is an enormous constituency, they are organized and they
know how to take it out on Congress at the polls,'' Schneider said.
   Census Bureau figures show that older Americans turn out to vote
more faithfully than the population overall, and that their ranks
will mushroom as the Baby Boom generation ages.
   But many analysts and advocates for the elderly believe Congress
is bowing to the demands of an outspoken minority within the senior
population as it backpedals on the catastrophic package _ to the
detriment of most older Americans.
   ``What you saw was the clout of the vocal and the articulate
elderly, who also tend to be more affluent,'' said Fernando
Torrez-Gil, associate professor of gerontology at the University of
Southern California. ``No one represented the needs of the poor.''
   Robert Binstock, professor of aging, health and society at Case
Western Reserve University, said the catastrophic debate has served
to highlight the diversity of 65-and-over population.
   ``You don't get homogenized on a birthday,'' Binstock said.
``The idea of `the clout of the elderly' is a misinformed cliche.''
   He said election analyses show that elderly people distribute
their votes among candidates in the same proportions as do people
of all ages.
   ``They vote more frequently, but they don't all vote the same,''
Binstock said.
   Members of Congress have been inundated with complaints from
senior citizens about the year-old Medicare Catastrophic Coverage
Act, enacted with fanfare to protect the elderly and disabled from
financial ruin in a serious illness.
   The program offers significant new hospital, doctor and
prescription drug coverage to 33 million Americans, and requires
the elderly to foot the entire bill through increased Medicare
premiums for all but the poorest beneficiaries and a special surtax
of up to $800 a year imposed on higher-income retirees.
   However, the House has already voted to repeal the program
outright and the Senate to drastically cut benefits as a way of
eliminating the unpopular surtax. The final resolution awaits
conference committee action.
   Legislators leading the rollback movement say they are
responding to broad-based opposition from elderly people angry at
being forced to pay for benefits they neither want nor need.
   Those trying to salvage the program argue that the protests
primarily are the handiwork of better-off seniors opposed to the
surtax.
   About 60 percent of the 33 million Americans covered by Medicare
would not be subject to the surtax at all. They would be billed a
flat $4-a-month this year for the additional coverage.
   Less than 6 percent of the 33 million Medicare-eligibles would
have to pay the maximum $800 a year surtax.
   One leading advocate of the catastrophic package, Rep. Fortney
``Pete'' Stark, D-Calif., said legislators were ``being stampeded
by a group, representing a small group of the wealthiest seniors,
to deny needed benefits to a majority of seniors.''
   Rep. Jim Bunning, R-Ky., however, maintained opposition was
virtually unanimous. ``You don't generate a storm this size with
just a few isolated elderly people,'' he said.
   Rick Moody of the Brookdale Center on Aging at Hunter College in
New York City said the opposition represents an old-fashioned
taxpayer revolt by individuals angry at the mandatory surtax.
   ``What really galvanized people was the fear that they were
going to pay higher taxes,'' Moody said. ``Tax revolts are nothing
new.''
   The catastrophic debate in reality has been a defeat for the
`gray lobby,' Moody said, since major advocacy groups such as the
American Association of Retired Persons supported the program but
couldn't deliver the support of their members.
   ``The concept of the gray lobby is dramatically overblown,''
Moody said. ``In this case, the gray lobby largely bought into this
bill and was repudiated by the taxpayers.''
   Torrez-Gil said advocacy groups such as AARP may find their
influence diminished now that elderly people have mobilized at the
grassroots level and split with their leaders in Washington.
   ``The elderly constituency is no longer a homogeneous group,''
Torrez-Gill said. ``It is breaking down into components.''
   Such divisions aside, Schneider said, the elderly have been and
remain ``probably the most powerful constituency in the country
because they vote.''
   ``What changed wasn't the clout of the elderly, what changed was
the nature of their demands,'' Schneider said. ``All of the sudden
they astonished everyone by becoming an anti-tax constituency.''

<TEXT>
   The Moulin Rouge, the city's oldest cabaret,
celebrated its 100th birthday and raised money for AIDS research
during a lavish dinner show featuring performances by American and
French celebrities.
   Champagne flowed and dancing girls did the can-can during the
festivities Friday night, billed as ``Gala of the Century.''
   The largely French-American audience included singers Ella
Fitzgerald and Charles Trenet on stage, and Paloma Picasso and
Roman Polanski in the audience.
   The 900 guests paid $550 each to attend the benefit, sponsored
by the Fondation France-Liberte. Beaming her approval throughout
was the foundation's president, Danielle Mitterrand, wife of the
French president.
   ``Welcome to the Moulin Rouge, the heart and soul of Paris,''
said comedian Jerry Lewis, who wisecracked his way through the
introduction, comparing the famous can-can dancers to ``rockettes
on steroids.''
   Actress Dorothy Lamour, who said her grandmother was from
Toulouse, recalled her days of starring in the road pictures with
Bob Hope and Bing Crosby. ``I wish I'd made `On the road to Paris,'
'' she said.
   She introduced actor Donald O'Connor, who soft-shoed and sang
his way through a nostalgic homage to Maurice Chevalier.
   The audience was quick to correct actress Lauren Bacall when she
called the bash a bicentennial. ``Pardon my faux-pas,'' she said in
French before presenting French singer Charles Aznavour.
   Actress Esther Williams, the movies' swimming queen of the
1950s, wore a long black gown instead of her swimsuit to take the
stage with former Olympic star Greg Louganis and introduce the
water ballet in a plastic pool onstage performed by this year's
sparkling mermaid, Pascale Deschamps.
   Anita Baker, Jane Russell and Tony Curtis sang or told jokes
from the stage. Ms. Fitzgerald, ``the first lady of song,'' got a
standing ovation, and her jazzy jam session with knee-slapping Ray
Charles brought the house down.
   Trenet, 79, moved many to tears with his rendition of the song
``La Mer.'' The glorious days of the cabaret began when Charles
Zidler and Joseph Oller opened an enormous dance hall on Oct. 6,
1889.
   Part of the decor was a restored windmill that was a Montmartre
landmark when it was still farmland on a hill above the city.
   The first-night 1889 audience included dozens of counts and
princes. But it was Toulouse-Lautrec who immortalized the Moulin
Rouge's celebrated dancers from Jane Avril to Valentin ``the
boneless.'' As addicted to the cabaret as he was to absinthe, the
painter spent hours there nightly, sipping and sketching.
   The cabaret closed after a fire in 1915 but came roaring back in
the 1920s with the legendary Mistinguett singing ``Ca, c'est
Paris.''
   By 1930 the movies were drawing away so many patrons that the
Moulin Rouge was turned into a cinema. But after a spectacular
comeback with a charity ball in 1953, there was no looking back.
   Owned today by Jacky Clerico, the Moulin Rouge now plays to a
packed house of 900 twice nightly. Its international audience pays
up to $100 for the champagne dinner and show.

   Documents obtained from the international agency
that regulates trade in ivory show it gets 77 percent of its money
from ivory traders, an arrangement under fire from
environmentalists trying to save the African elephant.
   Many environmentalists want a ban on commerce in elephant tusks.
Without it, they say, the beast that poet John Donne called
``nature's great masterpiece'' could be virtually extinct in Africa
in a generation.
   But the ivory control unit of the regulatory agency _ the
Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild
Fauna and Flora, or CITES _ opposes such a ban.
   That has set the stage for confrontation at the CITES biannual
meeting beginning Monday in Lausanne, Switzerland.
   Environmentalists say CITES opposes a ban because it depends
upon the largesse of ivory traders. CITES says a ban won't stop
poaching.
   The population of African elephants has declined from 1.3
million in 1979 to an estimated 625,000, according to a study by
the Ivory Trade Review Group, a team of environmentalists and
biologists from around the world. The study will be published next
week.
   Well-armed, highly organized poachers who travel freely across
African borders in pursuit of elephant tusks are killing 10 percent
of the remaining elephants each year, the study concluded.
   At that rate, elephants will be extinct in the wild within 30
years, said one of the study's authors, David Western, the director
of Wildlife Conservation International of New York.
   ``The elephant is in trouble,'' said Western, who has
specialized in elephant studies for several years.
   ``The loss of habitat is not the driving force, nor is
population growth,'' he said in an interview. ``The driving force,
according to our studies, is the ivory trade.''
   Elephant carcasses are left to rot in the sun on Africa's dusty
savannahs while their tusks are shipped to Hong Kong to be carved
into ``trinkets and baubles,'' said Richard Leakey, the eminent
anthropologist who is now director of wildlife in Kenya.
   ``Ivory serves no functional purpose,'' he said. ``We surely
have reached the stage in our civilization and emancipation where
we don't need to wear the parts of other animals to decorate
ourselves.''
   Environmentalists helped persuade Japan, Hong Kong, Europe and
the United States to halt ivory imports, beginning last June. Hong
Kong is the headquarters of the ivory trade, Japan its largest
consumer.
   CITES' opposition to a ban has attracted little support, except
from a few African countries that profit from ivory. Other African
countries favor a ban, fearing the loss of tourism revenue if the
elephants disappear.
   Jaques Berney, deputy secretary general of CITES, denies the
agency's opposition to a ban is related to support by ivory traders.
   ``It's completely wrong,'' Berney said in a telephone interview
from the agency's headquarters in Lausanne. ``Our analysis of the
problem is not based on money. ... If we hadn't accepted this
money, there would not be any ivory unit. And the system would have
completely failed.''
   Curtis Bohlen, senior vice president of the World Wildlife Fund
in Washington, said, ``I believe the secretary general has
exercised very bad judgment in accepting these contributions,
because it leads people to the very obvious conclusion that that
has influenced their decision on a ban.''
   CITES (pronounced SIGH-tees) is the principal international
agency responsible for the regulation of trade in all endangered
species. Since CITES was established in 1973 as part of the United
Nations Environment Program, 102 countries have joined it.
   At the meeting, delegates will consider a proposal by Tanzania
that elephants be shifted from CITES' Appendix II, which allows
legal ivory trade with import quotas, onto Appendix I, which would
prohibit ivory trade. A two-thirds vote is required for the change.
   Berney said the agency's secretariat believes a ban simply won't
work.
   ``The main problem is poaching, which in our opinion will not be
solved by a ban on ivory trade,'' he said. Furthermore, a ban might
be ignored by some countries, such as South Africa, which culls
ivory from protected elephant herds, he said.
   Even the most ardent supporters of a ban argue that it must be
accompanied by anti-poaching programs in Africa. But the ban is a
necessary ingredient of any effort to halt the elephants' decline,
they say.
   ``The quota system for elephants under ... Appendix II has
totally failed,'' said Leakey. ``Let's see if stopping it will
work.''
   According to CITES figures, its ivory control unit has received
$308,647 in contributions since 1985. Of that, $238,470, or 77
percent, has come from ivory traders, many of them in Japan and
Hong Kong.
   CITES' other activities are supported by contributions from
member nations. Berney said the secretariat had proposed inclusion
of the ivory unit in the member-supported budget, but delegates to
the 1987 CITES meeting didn't want to increase the budget.
   Governments and environmental groups were asked for
contributions. ``The problem,'' Berney said, ``is that the only
people who have really provided money in considerable quantities
are the ivory traders.''
   Underlying the dispute is scientific disagreement over the
danger the ivory trade poses to elephants.
   While elephant specialists see evidence of a serious decline,
CITES sees little need for drastic action.
   ``There is no disagreement about the decline of the elephants,''
Berney said. ``But to say that the elephant is an endangered animal
throughout Africa is, in our point of view, exaggerated.''
   Western, however, said projections indicate ``the elephant is
going to be effectively extinct much, much sooner than almost any
other animal on the endangered list.''
   Computer models developed by the Ivory Trade Review Group were
used to determine what action might stem the decline. ``Only one
option made any difference,'' said Western. ``Ban trade entirely.''
   He said poaching has disrupted the family and breeding structure
of elephant herds. Bulls, sought for their large tusks, are so
scarce some females can't find mates. The slaughter of females
leaves orphans that die soon after.
   From 1979 to 1987, Africa's ivory exports fell from 900 metric
tons to 300 metric tons, according to the Ivory Trade Review Group.
Yet the slaughter has not appreciably declined.
   In 1979, the group calculated, poachers had to slaughter 54
elephants to reap a metric ton of ivory. By 1987, after older
elephants with larger tusks had gradually disappeared, it took 113
elephants to produce a metric ton of tusks. In addition, 55
orphaned calves died for each metric ton collected. They produced
no ivory.
   The ivory trade is estimated to be worth $1 billion a year, most
of which goes to the traders and craftsmen. African countries where
ivory trade flourishes earned only a few million dollars from ivory
sales in 1987, Western said.
   Elephants are worth far more to tourism, bringing an estimated
$50 million a year into Kenya alone, he said. That is why Kenya and
its neighbor Tanzania favor a ban, he said.
   The Ivory Trade Review Group acknowledged in its study that a
ban carries risks. It will drive ivory trade underground, putting
it in the hands of criminals, and could push up prices by making
ivory scarce.
   The group concluded in its report, however, that ``to persevere
with the present inadequate approach is to make failure, and the
drastic decline of the world's greatest land animal, inevitable.''

<TEXT>
   Home ownership declined in the 1980s for the
first time since World War II, Sen. Lloyd Bentsen said Saturday,
citing high prices and high interest rates.
   ``In the decades following World War II you saw home ownership
continue to climb, but in the '80s it headed downhill,'' said
Bentsen, D-Texas. ``And the reasons were ... that housing costs
were up, but _ one of the big ones _ interest rates were up.''
   According to a study by a senior economist for the Joint
Economic Committee of Congress, home ownership peaked at 65.6
percent of the population in 1980 and then began falling, hitting
63.9 percent last year.
   The study found home ownership had fallen dramatically in the
youngest age groups. In 1973 nearly one-fourth _ or 23.4 percent of
people under age 25 _ owned a home. In 1988 the rate was 15.5
percent.
   In other younger age groups, the situation is similar: 43.6
percent of 25-to-29-year-olds were homeowners in 1973, falling to
36.2 percent in 1988. For the 30-to-34-year-old group, 60.2 percent
owned homes in 1973, dropping to 52.6 percent in 1988. And in the
35-to-39 bracket, the rate fell from 68.5 percent in 1973 to 63.2
percent in 1988.
   The average age of first-time homebuyers has jumped to 32 now,
up from 28 years old in 1980, the study said.
   Housing affordability is determined by several factors,
including tax policy, income growth and housing prices, the study
said.
   Rising house prices are reflected particularly in down payment
requirements, the study said. In this decade alone, the average
down payment for first-time home buyers has risen more than 50
percent, from $8,600 in 1981 to $13,000 in 1988.
   The other major hurdle to home ownership is interest rates, the
study said.
   The interest cost along of a $100,000 fixed rate, 30-year
mortgage at 6 percent, the prevailing rate in the 1960s, would have
been $115,841, with a monthly house payment of $600.
   At 9 percent, the prevailing rate of the mid-1970s, the total
interest cost would have been $188,810, with the monthly payments
$802.
   But at 10.5 percent, the prevailing mortgage rate today, that
interest cost would be $229,306 _ nearly double the interest cost
off a 6 percent mortgage, and monthly house payments would be $915.
   ``That's a tough hill to climb,'' said Bentsen, the chairman of
the Senate Finance Committee, who is pushing for Congress to
reinstate partial tax deductions for contributions to Individual
Retirement Accounts.
   Under Bentsen's proposal, IRA contributions could be withdrawn
without penalty for the purchase of a first home or for education
expenses.
   Bentsen said his IRA plan, which has been offered as an
alternative to President Bush's proposed cut in the capital gains
tax, would give people an incentive to save money for their first
home, a college education, or retirement.
   ``Now if we accomplish those things with savings and the
withdrawal without any penalty, you'll have a great increase in the
amount of capital in this country and that'll bring interest rates
down. And that helps the entire country,'' Bentsen said.

   Nobel laureate Mother Teresa was removed
from intensive care Saturday, nearly five weeks after she was
hospitalized with heart trouble, news reports said.
   Press Trust of India said the 79-year-old Roman Catholic nun was
moved to the post-cardiac unit of the Woodlands Nursing Home, the
hospital to which she was admitted Sept. 5 with high fever and
irregular heart beat.
   The Yugoslav-born nun suffered a heart attack Sept. 8 and
experienced sporadic chest pains until Sept. 18.
   Mother Teresa was awarded the 1979 Nobel Peace Prize for her
work with the poor and the dying in the slums of Calcutta, India's
largest city.
   In 1950, she founded the Missionaries of Charity in Calcutta,
850 miles from New Delhi. The order was formally recognized by the
Vatican in 1965 and now has 3,000 nuns working for it in 87
countries.

   Iran executed 32 drug traffickers
Saturday under tough new laws passed as part of an anti-narcotics
campaign, according to Iranian news reports.
   The smugglers were tried by Islamic revolutionary courts, which
are charged with carrying out the anti-drug campaign, the official
Islamic Republic News Agency said.
   A law passed in January imposed the death sentence for
possession of even small quantities of narcotics. It is believed
that about 950 convicted smugglers have been executed since then.
   IRNA, monitored in Nicosia, said 10 traffickers were hanged
Saturday in Tehran's Qasr prison. Tehran Radio, also monitored in
Nicosia, said 22 others were hanged in eight other Iranian cities.
   Of the 32, three were women, according to the reports. The
traffickers were accused of dealing in opium and heroin.

   A former vice president, a former
senior police official and four soldiers were hanged Saturday for
plotting to kill President Joseph Momoh and overthrow his
government, official sources said.
   Government-controlled radio said Momoh commuted to life
imprisonment the death sentences of six other men convicted in the
attempted coup.
   The men were among 18 people convicted in the failed coup on
March 23, 1987, in which a police officer was killed. The national
appeals court upheld the death sentences last month.
   Those hanged at dawn Saturday included former Vice President
Francis Minah and Mohammed Gabriel Tennyson Kaikai, former
assistant police superintendent, according to the government
sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
   Sierra Leone is a former British colony in western Africa that
became an independent member of the Commonwealth in 1961 and a
republic in 1971.

   Anti-apartheid leader the Rev.
Allan Boesak led 10,000 blacks on a march through this rural town
Saturday and vowed to ``bring this government down'' through
peaceful protest.
   The rally began at a Dutch Reformed church outside Worcester and
traveled to a police station in town where demonstrators presented
a list of demands that included the release of political prisoners
and the lifting of the 3-year-old state of emergency.
   Boesak, one of the country's best-known activists, said he would
make identical demands when he meets President F.W. de Klerk on
Wednesday.
   ``We are not going to have a tea party,'' said Boesak, who will
be joined by two fellow activists, Anglican Archbishop Desmond Tutu
and the Rev. Frank Chikane, head of the South African Council of
Churches.
   ``We are going there to tell (de Klerk) that he must create the
climate so that negotiations (with blacks) can take place,'' Boesak
said.
   The crowd chanted, danced, sang and carried the black, green and
gold banner of the outlawed African National Congress guerrilla
movement.
   ``We want to say this is our non-violent, disciplined,
determined way to bring this government down,'' Boesak told the
cheering crowd at the Esselen Park Stadium, where the two-mile
march ended.
   De Klerk says he wants to negotiate a new constitution within
five years that will bring the black majority into the national
government.
   The president said last month that the government would no
longer disrupt peaceful protests, and since then there have been
huge rallies in major cities and several small towns such as
Worcester, 75 miles east of Cape Town.
   In other developments Saturday:
   _Albertina Sisulu, wife of jailed ANC leader Walter Sisulu,
visited her husband briefly at Pollsmoor Prison outside Cape Town.
Local newspapers have said Sisulu, imprisoned for 25 years and a
close colleague of Nelson Mandela, will be freed within the next 10
days.
   Mrs. Sisulu, an activist in her own right, is under police
restrictions that prohibit her from speaking to the media. However,
the Sisulus' daughter, Nonkulelko Mavumbe, said her father was not
aware of any plans for his release.
   _The West German Embassy sponsored a concert for poet Mzwakhe
Mbuli, who has repeatedly been denied a passport to give poetry
readings abroad. About a dozen other embassies, including the U.S.
mission, expressed support or sent representatives to the afternoon
concert at Johannesburg's Market Theater.
   _The anti-apartheid Democratic Party decided to retain three
leaders at a meeting in Durban. The trio of Zach de Beer, Wynand
Malan and Denis Worrall will continue to guide the Democrats, who
captured 33 of the 166 seats in last month's elections for the
white chamber of Parliament. There are also chambers for Asians and
people of mixed-race, but South Africa's 28 million blacks are
excluded.

<HEAD>Israeli Leaders to Consider Baker Proposal</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LOUIS MEIXLER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>JERUSALEM (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Israeli leaders said Saturday they are
considering an offer by Secretary of State James A. Baker III for
three-way talks involving Israel, Egypt and the United States to
try to break the deadlock in the Middle East peace process.
   Leaders of Israel's two major parties said they were encouraged
by the offer, but it was likely to face strong opposition from
hard-liners in Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir's right-wing Likud
bloc.
   On Friday, Israel's policy-making inner Cabinet voted to reject
an Egyptian proposal for talks in Cairo on elections in the
occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip.
   The center-left Labor Party, the junior partner in the coalition
government, supported Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak's plan. But
the Likud opposed it and the Cabinet deadlocked 6-6. That meant the
proposal was rejected.
   In Washington, U.S. officials said Baker was trying to keep the
Egyptian proposal alive. They said that after the Israeli Cabinet
vote, Baker spoke by telephone with Israeli Foreign Minister Moshe
Arens and Egyptian Foreign Minister Esmat Abdel-Meguid.
   Arens said Baker proposed that Israel, Egypt and the United
States meet for consultations on the formation of a Palestinian
delegation for peace talks.
   ``This offer does not contain the dangers in the proposal''
rejected Friday, Arens told Israel radio.
   Arens, a senior Likud official, said the difference between the
Baker and the Mubarak proposals was whether Israel is to ``meet
with a PLO delegation or a delegation of Palestinians set up with
our agreement.''
   Likud objects to the participation of Palestinians from outside
the occupied territories, but the Palestinians have demanded this.
   As a compromise, Mubarak has proposed that Palestinians who have
been deported from the territories participate. Likud rejects this,
seeing it as a backdoor opening to the PLO. Israel officially views
the PLO as a terror group and refuses to deal with it.
   Arens said Baker first made his offer in a telephone
conversation last week, and he asked Baker Thursday to formally
submit the proposal to Israel. He said the offer could be discussed
in the government's next meeting.
   Labor Party leader Shimon Peres said he did ``not see any real
differences between the Baker offer and the Mubarak proposal.''
   In Cairo, Abdel-Meguid said that ``consultations are under way
with the United States and Israel.'' He did not elaborate.
   Hard-liners in the Likud have said they will oppose the Baker
offer as staunchly as they fought Mubarak's proposal.
   ``There are not going to be any more concessions on the Israeli
side,'' Trade Minister Ariel Sharon said following the Cabinet vote.
   Some Labor officials are urging their party to quit the
coalition government over the peace stalemate.
   Peres said Saturday his party would consider withdrawing if
there is no progress toward peace.
   ``What is clear is that this situation cannot continue,'' Peres
said. ``There are a number of possible actions we can take and we
will examine them.''
   The Israeli peace initiative, which the government endorsed in
May, calls for the election of Palestinians to negotiate an interim
autonomy agreement with Israel. The final status of the occupied
lands would be determined later.
   Israel captured the West Bank from Jordan and the Gaza Strip
from Egypt during the 1967 Middle East war. Palestinians living in
the occupied territories have been waging an uprising against
Israeli rule since December 1987 and are pursuing their longtime
goal of creating an independent state.
   Since the uprising began, 585 Palestinians have been killed by
Israeli troops or civilians. Another 127 Palestinians have been
killed by fellow Arabs, most on suspicion of collaborating with
Israel. Forty Israelis have died.

<DATELINE>CHARLOTTE, N.C. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   PTL founder Jim Bakker's waffling
testimony combined with a skillful job by prosecutors to convict
the TV evangelist of defrauding thousands of loyal supporters who
sent him $158 million, court observers say.
   ``What the prosecutors did was masterful,'' said Charlotte
lawyer Mike Scofield, a former federal prosecutor who watched the
trial closely. ``They simplified and clarified what could have been
a very difficult and confusing case.''
   Ken Andreson, another former assistant U.S. attorney, said
prosecutors Deborah Smith and Jerry Miller did their homework
before bringing Bakker to federal court.
   ``They were very adept at using Bakker's own statements to their
maximum advantage,'' he said. ``They cast him in the light they
wanted the jurors to see him.''
   Following a day and a half of deliberations, a jury Thursday
convicted the former PTL leader of all 24 counts of mail fraud,
wire fraud and conspiracy. Prosecutors accused him of diverting
$3.7 million of the $158 million sent in for PTL partnerships to
his own use.
   Bakker faces maximum penalties of 120 years in prison and more
than $5 million in fines when he is sentenced Oct. 24.
   The evangelist, who posted $250,000 bond and returned to his
home in Orlando, Fla., planned to address his followers at a church
service there Sunday, Don Baldwin, acting general manager of Jim
and Tammy Ministries, said Saturday.
   More than 50 loyal Bakker supporters were among the 75 witnesses
called by defense attorneys Harold Bender and George T. Davis. Many
of the character witnesses acknowledged under cross-examination
that no facts that came up in the trial could alter their view of
Bakker.
   Defense witness Ken Coppersmith reflected their bitterness at
the verdict: ``There's freedom and justice for all _ except Jim
Bakker.''
   Other supporters accused U.S. District Judge Robert Potter, a
conservative Reagan appointee, of bias against their hero. After
the verdict, Potter had said he hesitated to release Bakker on bail
because he believed some Bakker followers had a ``Jim Jones
mentality.''
   Scofield and Andreson praised Potter and the prosecutors for
maintaining control of a trial that often resembled a soap opera.
It featured a hurricane-caused blackout, Bakker praying for a
fainting witness and suffering an emotional breakdown, and his
tearful wife, Tammy Faye, reacting to the verdict by singing gospel.
   Juror Barbara Dalley said Bakker hurt himself when he took the
stand as the last defense witness.
   ``He contradicted so many other witnesses' testimony,'' she
said. ``None of us believed he was telling the truth.''
   Prosecutors portrayed Bakker as a con man who lied on TV to get
people to send him money. During the nearly six-week trial, they
called more than 100 witnesses but never strayed far from their
focus on the fraud case's victims, PTL's faithful ``lifetime
partners.''
   From 1984-87, nearly 153,000 people became partners, typically
by sending in $1,000 in return for a promise of three free nights
of lodging each year for life at PTL's 2,400-acre Christian retreat
in nearby Fort Mill, S.C.
   With the help of Ms. Smith, a Justice Department fraud
specialist, and Miller, an assistant U.S. attorney, the jurors were
able to associate the specific wire and mail fraud charges with
individual victims.
   One count focused on the plight of retired coal miner Lamar
Kerstetter, who suffers from black lung disease.
   Asked what he expected in return for his $1,000, the resident of
Shamokin, Pa., responded: ``My four days and three nights.''
   ``There was constant juxtaposition of the victims with witnesses
who testified about the extravagances of Jim Bakker,'' Scofield
said.
   Andreson said the government was able to dispel the public image
Bakker built through years of TV appearances heralding family
values on his Christian talk show.
   ``They were able to create an identity in the courtroom I
believe not many people were aware of before the trial,'' he said.
   ``It's hard to like someone who spent $100 on cinnamon buns just
to toss them out,'' he said.
   Bakker's former bodyguard testified that he once purchased $100
worth of cinnamon buns because the Bakkers liked the aroma. After
several days, the uneaten buns were thrown out.
   Bakker's former accountant testified that the Bakkers once
earned only about $600 in interest on their bank accounts in a year
in which Bakker earned about $700,000 because the money came and
went so quickly.
   The jury was shown eight hours of videotapes in which Bakker was
seen over and over hawking partnerships as he sold more than twice
the number that could be accommodated at existing PTL facilities.
Only one of the hotels that he showed viewers plans for was
finished before Bakker resigned March 19, 1987, after revelation of
his sexual encounter with Jessica Hahn.

   Police scuffled with 500 protesters staging a

protest a plan to build an anti-guerrilla training center there,
police said.
   Several people were injured, including a 26-year-old man who was
taken to a hospital with a possible broken rib, police said.
   About 35,000 American troops are stationed on Okinawa in
southern Japan.
   An officer at the Ishikawa police station said the brief scuffle
occurred outside U.S.-run Camp Hansen when police were called to
remove the protesters.
   Prior to that, U.S. military authorities canceled plans to take
15 truckloads of construction materials into the camp, said the
officer, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
   The protesters chanted slogans describing the proposed
anti-guerrilla training center as an expansion of U.S. military
facilities on Okinawa.
   U.S. military authorities were not available for comment.

   A strong undersea earthquake struck 130
miles southeast of Amchitka Island early Saturday and was felt
there and on other Aleutian Islands, an official said. There were
no reports of damage.
   The quake's preliminary magnitude on the Richter scale was 6.7,
said Paul Whitmore, a spokesman for the Alaska Tsunami Warning
Center at Palmer. He said the earthquake occurred at 7:48 a.m. ADT.
   Officials of the center said the earthquake was felt strongly at
Amchitka Island, and moderately at Adak Island, about 200 miles to
the east. But a warning of a tsunami, or large wave popularly known
as a tidal wave, was not issued.
   The 1964 ``Good Friday'' earthquake in Alaska measured 8.5 on
the Richter scale and was centered in Prince William Sound. It
generated large waves that devastated several coastal communities
and killed 131 people as far south as Oregon and Hawaii.
   The Richter scale is a measure of ground motion as recorded on
seismographs. Every increase of one number means a tenfold increase
in magnitude. Thus, a reading of 7.5 reflects an earthquake 10
times strong than one of 6.5.
   An earthquake of magnitude 3.5 can cause slight damage, 4
moderate damage, 5 considerable damage, 6 severe damage. A
magnitude 7 quake is a major earthquake, capable of widespread
damage; 8 is a ``great'' quake capable of tremendous damage.

   Bette Davis was remembered Saturday as the
ideal motion picture actress, a powerfully talented perfectionist
who overcame Hollywood's glamour fixation to become one of its
unfading stars.
   Miss Davis, a two-time Academy Award winner, died Friday at the
American Hospital in Paris after a long fight with cancer. She was
81.
   ``She was a beacon of light for all of us who were starting
out,'' said Angela Lansbury, who said she idolized the movie star
as a child in England. She appeared with Miss Davis in the 1982
television miniseries ``Little Gloria _ Happy at Last.''
   ``She once said to me, `The thing about us, we're character
actresses.' She wasn't a great beauty, and she knew that,'' Miss
Lansbury said from her home in Los Angeles. ``She was a tremendous
role model for me. She simply encouraged my aspirations as also not
(being) a great beauty.''
   ``I admired her dogged attention to keep going. ... She never,
never gave up, to the very end.''
   A perfectionist, Miss Davis loathed sloppy work, Miss Lansbury
said.
   ``Her great problem was, that she didn't feel that people were
professional enough. Young actors wouldn't get to the set on time.
She was professional. ... She didn't throw fits, she didn't keep
people waiting. ... She gained attention through her work.''
   Vincent Price, who worked with Miss Davis on ``The Private Lives
of Elizabeth and Essex'' in 1939 and ``Whales of August'' in 1987,
mourned her as a film genius.
   ``There are very few people left who really sum up the motion
picture industry, who had that star quality. It was really rare,''
Price said in Los Angeles. ``She had extraordinary energy; she was
a genius.''
   ``I'm sorry that her ilk doesn't come along anymore,'' said
Ernest Borgnine, who worked with Miss Davis on two films, including
``The Catered Affair'' in 1956. ``She wanted perfection, but she
was never hard.''
   ``Bette Davis was surely one of the most significant women to
shape American film, both through her talents as an actress and her
spirited character,'' Charlton Heston said from his home in Los
Angeles.
   ``She seemed to me to be an ideal motion picture actress,'' said
James Stewart, who costarred with Miss Davis in the 1983 cable-TV
film ``Right of Way.''
   ``She had this wonderful, wonderful talent and was very
cooperative to other people in the picture and with the crew.
   ``I never experienced any better than that spirit of cooperation
and (of) being able to work for the scene, and not just for self in
the scene.''
   ``What a loss,'' said Olivia de Havilland, who worked with Miss
Davis in four films, including the 1964 ``Hush, Hush Sweet
Charlotte.''
   ``She was a remarkable person to work with, highly professional,
innovative, brilliant and quick,'' said Miss de Havilland, 73, who
lives in Paris. ``She was very well-disciplined. I thought she had
some marvelous personal qualities and I was very fond of her.''
   In a statement, former President Reagan, himself a former
Hollywood actor who appeared with Miss Davis in the 1939 film
``Dark Victory,'' called her ``one of the true greats in the motion
picture business. She gave us some of the most memorable moments in
the history of film and touched us in a way few others have.''
   ``For Bette, acting was more than a profession; it was an art.''
   Glenn Ford credited Miss Davis with restarting his acting career
after World War II:
   ``When I got back after the war, she gave me a role opposite her
in a (1946) film called `A Stolen Life,' and from there I went on.
Because of Bette, I was able to begin again after I'd been away for
a while.''

   Supreme Court or no, it's one American
flag no one will be able to set afire _ a 12-foot-tall U.S. flag
made out of a spare, steel beam.
   ``The point of this is to show in a symbolic way that there's
something you can't destroy, and that's the American flag,'' said
Frank Gallo, an art professor at the University of Illinois. He
teamed up with a friend, metal worker Aaron Kurland, to create the
sculpture unveiled Friday along a city street.
   The two call the sculpture ``The Flag That Will Not Burn.'' They
were inspired by the uproar over flag desecration, but Gallo also
sensed a challenge.
   ``It seemed to be almost the antithesis of an I-beam,'' Gallo
said. ``The contrast is so interesting. What a challenge it would
be to see if we can create a sense of fluid movement inside of
something that absolutely couldn't be conceived of as moving.''
   The sculpture is designed to catch sunlight at various times of
the day, and there are plans to light it up at night.

   The San Francisco Symphony had to slim down
to 80 musicians to fit on stage during a performance in the small,
windswept town of Weed.
   The symphony, usually 106 pieces, was coaxed to Weed in far
northern California by pleas from some residents for big-city
culture.
   The 625-seat auditorium where the symphony performed Thursday
night was the smallest hall ever played by the orchestra.
   ``The orchestra treats this with the same seriousness as playing
New York,'' said Peter Pastreich, the symphony's executive director.
   Some residents of Weed, a town of 3,000 nearly 300 miles north
of San Francisco, had to sit on folding chairs in the aisles during
the concert.
   ``It's something we'll never see again in our lifetime,'' said
Siskiyou County Supervisor Ivan Young.

<TEXT>
   Red Cross officials returned to Sidon on
Saturday, a day after two Swiss colleagues were kidnapped by
unidentified gunmen, but relief operations will remain suspended
until the men are freed.
   ``Our operations have been suspended in Sidon pending the
release of our two abducted comrades,'' said Mohammed Bizri,
Lebanese representative of the International Committee of the Red
Cross in Sidon.
   The Red Cross team drove to Beirut on Friday evening after
orthopedic technicians Emanuel Cristen, 32, and Elio Elliquez, 23,
were kidnapped in Sidon and driven off toward the nearby Ein
el-Hilweh Palestinian refugee camp.
   In Bern, Switzerland, Carlos Bauverd, a spokesman for the
International Committee of the Red Cross, told Swiss Radio the team
returned to Sidon Saturday morning. But he stressed that operations
in the south were ``still frozen.''
   ``Contacts are under way on all levels to help secure the
release of the two Swiss officials, but we still have no word on
their whereabouts or who is holding them,'' Bizri told reporters.
   Friday's abductions raised the number of Westerners missing in
Lebanon to 18. The others are eight Amercians, four Britons, two
West Germans, an Irishman and an Italian. Most are believed to be
held by pro-Iranian Shiite Moslems.
   The longest held is Terry Anderson, chief Middle East
correspondent of The Associated Press. He was kidnapped March 16,
1985.
   No group had claimed reponsibility for the abduction of Cristen
and Elliquez, the latest in a series targeting humanitarian workers
in southern Lebanon. At least 10 relief workers _ British, West
Germans, Scandinavians, Belgians and Swiss _ have been abducted
over the past two years. All but two West Germans, who worked for
the ASME-Humanitas relief agency, have been freed. Those
kidnappings were blamed primarily on a radical Palestinian faction
headed by terrorist mastermind Abu Nidal.
   Abu Nidal, the nom de guerre of Sabri al-Banna, broke away from
the mainstream Fatah faction of the Palestine Liberation
Organization led by Yasser Arafat in 1973 and set up a rival group
called Fatah-Revolutionary Council.
   The PLO, the main group in the Ein el-Hilweh refugee camp, and a
Sunni Moslem militia that controls Sidon pledged to track down the
kidnappers.
   ``We shall leave no stone unturned in the city in the search for
the two Swiss men,'' said a Fatah guerrilla who identified himself
only as Amer as he led a search patrol.

   The state sued a company that sells
light bulbs over the telephone, charging it claims all its
employees are handicapped when they may have nothing more disabling
than hangnails or hay fever.
   The lawsuit filed Friday in Jackson County court said workers
for Local Handicapped Workers Inc. have called thousands of people
in Missouri since last April, claiming that ``all the employees
here are handicapped.'' Then the solicitors asked the customers to
buy light bulbs for up to $5.41 each.
   Investigators from state Attorney General William L. Webster's
office say that when they posed as job applicants at the business,
supervisors told them they could earn up to $600 a week and that
``handicaps'' could include pregnancy, hangnails, allergies or the
need for eyeglasses.
   ``I seriously doubt anyone who purchased light bulbs from the
company would consider wearing glasses a handicap,'' Webster said.
``We contend the company misled consumers by telling them a group
of handicapped people were selling light bulbs for a living.''
   When one investigator could not identify a handicap, the manager
``told her to go home and think of a handicap and call back'' and
she would be hired, according to the lawsuit.
   The lawsuit seeks $1,000 for each violation of state consumer
fraud laws, and refunds for people who bought bulbs from the
company.
   An attorney for the company, Dan Allmayer, said the company
denies the charges. Meanwhile, a court order bars it from using the
word handicapped in its sales pitches.

   Publication of an AIDS-education pamphlet on
the use of condoms has run into another delay at the Department of
Health and Human Services.
   The brochure has been circulating at the department for two
years and recently was sent back for review by Kay James, assistant
secretary for public affairs, who said she wanted it to be more
specific about condom failures.
   James, a former director of public affairs for the National
Right to Life Committee, also said in an interview Saturday that
she wanted more information about the audience the brochure was
intended to reach.
   ``That wasn't made clear to me _ whether it would be widely
distributed or given just to high school students,'' she said.
``You would do a different brochure for different audiences.''
   James acknowledged that she sent the brochure back to the Public
Health Service for further review, but denied her action was
ideologically driven.
   ``Peoples lives are at stake,'' she said. ``When people are
making decisions about their sexual behavior ... they need to have
accurate information and that's my only concern.''
   However, sources within the Public Health Service who spoke on
the condition of anonymity, said some people have expressed concern
because they believe James is personally opposed to using public
money to promote condom use.
   The Washington Post, in Saturday editions, quoted a senior
federal health official as saying: ``We have a major battle on our
hands, and we are fighting with at least one arm tied behind our
back. How can we explain that in the 10th year of an epidemic that
has killed so many of our young people, we are not able to help
them use the only method we know can help.''
   Former Surgeon General C. Everett Koop, who was often at odds
with the Reagan administration over his advocacy of condom use,
also said the brochure is needed.
   ``In view of the large number of letters the Public Health
Service has received about concerns on how to use a condom, it
seems clear that such a brochure is long overdue,'' Koop told the
Post.
   James Allen, director of the National AIDS Program Office, said
Saturday that a brochure on condom use is needed but acknowledged
that such a document raises concern for some.
   ``As a federal government that is paying for it with tax dollars
we are subject to a lot of criticism, but that doesn't mean we shy
away,'' he said. ``It means we try to take different sensitivities
into view.''
   The pamphlet is being reviewed by Jeff Nesbit, head of public
affairs for the Food and Drug Administration, who said it had been
sent to James office by his predecessor and that he had not yet
looked through it.
   ``I consider this part of the normal review process,'' he said.
``It is not all that unusual.''

<TEXT>
   Sixteen-year-old Richard Whitaker has moved
with his family six times in the last 10 years, spending time in a
temporary shelter until his father found a job.
   Being a Boy Scout was just one of the things he missed out on,
until the scouts reached out to him and other disadvantaged
youngsters housed in family shelters and welfare hotels around the
country.
   ``Just because they're homeless doesn't mean they can't do well
in school or be a Boy Scout,'' said Howard Sidney, a counselor at
the Anna M. Sample House.
   The Camden shelter, where Whitaker lived with his family until
they rented a home nearby about three months ago, is headquarters
for Boy Scout Troop 108, part of the ``Scoutreach'' program started
last year.
   Whitaker is one of the troop's 16 boys, some from the shelter
and others from the neighborhood in this beleaguered city of 85,000
where about 27 percent of the population is on welfare and an
estimated 500 people are homeless in any given month, including 85
children.
   ``Most people my age say it's not cool being a Boy Scout,''
Whitaker said. ``But I think it's kind of fun. I can be a role
model.''
   The Scoutreach program has produced troops in shelters, welfare
hotels and storefronts in New York, Baltimore, Washington, D.C.,
and Detroit, said Lee Sneath, a spokesman for the Irving,
Texas-based Boy Scouts.
   ``It's more of an evolutionary process than it is a
revolutionary process,'' Sneath said. ``Now that society is
recognizing the plight of these people we're simply responding.''
   Camden's Troop 108 is among more than 130,000 scout troops
across the nation and one of the most recent formed for the urban
homeless and poor. The nation has 4.3 million youngsters involved
in scouting.
   The Scoutreach troops participate in many of the same activities
as regular troops, including camping trips and earning merit
badges. Members of Whitaker's troop can earn badges by cleaning and
performing other chores at the shelter.
   ``By having a Boy Scout troop that meets right at the shelter,
it gives them a sense of participation in a mainstream
institution,'' said Harold Oliver Jr., director of emergency
services for the private agency that runs the Camden shelter.
   ``Hope is the most important item we have to deal with at the
shelter,'' said Oliver. ``The Boy Scouts deliver hope in big doses
to these boys and their families.''
   Members of Troop 103, based at a welfare hotel in New York City,
will participate in the scout's nationwide food drive Nov. 18,
Sneath said.
   ``Here is a troop that is literally at the bottom of the
economic rung, yet they are involved themselves in helping
others,'' Sneath said.
   In Fort Worth, Texas, Explorer Post 588 is based at Willoughby
House, a halfway house for girls. The 18 girls and women in the
post have served time for criminal offenses from petty theft to
drugs.
   In Camden, Whitaker's mother, Betty, serves as a den mother and
his father, Robert, is one of three scoutmasters.
   ``It feels great,'' Mrs. Whitaker said.
   The family was forced to move into the shelter after Robert
Whitaker lost his job and could not find another. He now works as a
security guard.
   The Camden troop, which went on a week-long camping trip last
summer, is organizing activities to raise $1,200 to buy uniforms
and handbooks.
   ``The basic vision on this is that these children are normal
children and they have the desires and expectations of any
children,'' Oliver said.
   Membership in New York City's Troop 103 fluctuates between 15
and 30 boys, said Armando Mejia-Gallardo, a Scoutreach adviser and
the troop's first scoutmaster.
   He said Scoutreach will help change the future of the
disadvantaged scouts.
   ``They don't feel confined to a cycle of poverty anymore,'' said
Mejia-Gallardo. ``They're going beyond that.''

   Colleagues, friends and a generation of fans on
Saturday mourned Bette Davis, who began her career playing nasty,
driven women and died more than a half-century later as one of the
world's most beloved film stars.
   The 81-year-old actress died Friday night at the American
Hospital in Paris, a hospital spokesman confirmed Saturday.
   The two-time Oscar winning actress had been on her way home to
West Hollywood, Calif., from a film festival in San Sebastian,
Spain, where she had been honored for a lifetime of achievement and
had won the hearts of the festival audience with her warmth, wit
and honesty.
   In New York, her longtime attorney Howard Schiff said she died
of cancer and that she had battled the disease since a mastectomy
in 1983. During that same year, she also suffered a stroke and a
broken hip.
   Her doctors knew the cancer had spread and was terminal, he
said, but decided to ``let her go on going about her business.''
   Her business was film, and over the course of 59 years she
starred in some of America's most memorable movies.
   Among her more than 80 films were ``Of Human Bondage,'' ``All
About Eve'' and ``Dark Victory.'' She was nominated for the Academy
Award 10 times and won the best actress award for ``Dangerous,'' in
1935 and ``Jezebel'' in 1938.
   ``What a loss,'' said actress Olivia de Havilland, who worked
with Miss Davis in four films, including the 1964 ``Hush, Hush
Sweet Charlotte.''
   ``She was a remarkable person to work with, highly professional,
innovative, brilliant and quick,'' said Miss de Havilland, 73. ``I
thought she had some marvelous personal qualities, and I was very
fond of her.''
   Vincent Price, who worked with Miss Davis on ``The Private Lives
of Elizabeth and Essex'' in 1939 and ``Whales of August'' in 1987,
said in Los Angeles: ``There are very few people left who really
sum up the motion picture industry, who had that star quality. It
was really rare. She had extraordinary energy; she was a genius.''
   In a statement from Los Angeles, former President Reagan, who
starred with Miss Davis in the 1939 film ``Dark Victory,'' said she
made ``some of the most memorable moments in the history of film
and touched us in a way few others have. For Bette, acting was more
than a profession; it was an art.''
   Actor Charlton Heston paid homage to Miss Davis as ``one of the
most significant women to shape American film both through her
talents as an actress and her spirited character.''
   ``I mark what she has done, and while I salute her passing, I
rejoice that we still have her work,'' Heston said in a telephone
interview.
   Angela Lansbury, who co-starred with Miss Davis in the 1982
television mini-series ``Little Gloria, Happy at Last,'' said the
actress was ``the last of the great Hollywood stars. ... She was a
beacon of light for all of us who were starting out.''
   Miss Davis attributed her success more to hard work than genius,
and she was known for being as strong and uncompromising off-screen
as some of the characters she portrayed. The line most identified
with her was ``What a dump!'' from the film ``Beyond the Forest.''
   She also was credited with giving the gold Oscar statue its
name. According to the story, she contended the statue's rear end
resembled that of her first husband, whose middle name was Oscar.
   ``The person who wants to make it has to sweat,'' Miss Davis
once said. ``There are no shorcuts. And you've got to have the guts
to be hated. That's the hardest part.''
   But there was only admiration and affection from the press and
participants at the Spanish film festival she attended two weeks
before her death.

   She charmed reporters at a Sept. 21 news conference with
comments on her colleagues, such as co-stars James Stewart _ ``I
never should have let him get away'' _ and Reagan _ ``He never had
much talent, but as president he restored patriotism for
Americans.''
   Of her expressive eyes, which inspired the 1982 pop song ``Bette
Davis Eyes,'' she said: ``It's my basic facial feature and what
communicated to the camera.''
   She was frail at the festival and spent most of the time resting
at her hotel. But she put on a brave face when talking to
reporters, saying she had been taking care of details, ``including
makeup, to appear beautiful before you all and offer you the very
best of myself.''
   Her success story was one of Hollywood's most unlikely tales.
Lacking the traditional Hollywood glamour girl looks, the skinny
youngster with the huge eyes relied on her acting skill and took
roles nobody else wanted, playing nasty women more often than nice
ones.
   Born Ruth Elizabeth Davis on April 5, 1908, in Lowell, Mass.,
she was always proud of her ancestors, who had helped settle New
England.
   Because her mother also was named Ruth, the young Miss Davis
came to be called Bette, after a character in the Balzac novel ``La
Cousine Bette.''
   As a teen-ager she showed talent in school theater and pursued
her desire to act by landing small roles in New England summer
theater.
   She made her New York stage debut in ``The Earth Between'' in
the 1920s and by 1930 had landed a three-month contract with
Universal Pictures that took her to Hollywood.
   Her film debut came the next year in ``Bad Sister.'' Five other
pictures followed.
   Of her early films, critic Pauline Kael wrote: ``Bette Davis
introduced a more complicated sexual character _ driving,
neurotic'' that captured the mood of the time.
   When the studio dropped her contract, Warner Bros. picked it up
and in 1932 gave her a co-starring role as an ingenue in ``The Man
Who Played God.''
   It was the beginning of her 18-year association with Warner
Bros., a sometimes stormy period in which Miss Davis was known for
her famous quarrels with studio chief Jack Warner. Yet when Warner
was asked in later years to define the term ``movie star,'' he said
simply: ``Bette Davis.''
   In 1934, Miss Davis was loaned to RKO for the role that would
establish her reputation as the sullen heroine Mildred in ``Of
Human Bondage.''
   In the twilight of her career, she played such television roles
as a Alice Vanderbilt on ``Little Gloria ... Happy at Last'' and a
terminally ill wife in ``Right of Way,'' a 1983 made-for-cable film
co-starring James Stewart.
   After appearing in the premiere of the ABC series ``Hotel'' for
the 1983-1984 TV season she was hospitalized. In June 1983, she had
a mastectomy, and nine days later suffered a stroke. Only months
after being discharged from the hospital, she broke a hip.
   When she returned to acting, in the 1985 made-for-TV movie
``Murder with Mirrors,'' she said she was frightened she would no
longer be able remember her lines and adjust to being on a set. But
she soon found it ``just great to be acting again.''
   Her successful career was not matched in matters of love. After
four husbands she declared that she had failed and would never
marry again. When she wrote her autobiography, she titled it ``The
Lonely Life.''
   ``I haven't been very fortunate; I think it's very difficult for
a famous woman,'' she told reporters in San Sebastian.
   In 1987, she published a second autobiography, ``This 'n'
That,'' which described her battle with medical problems and also
delivered a rebuke to daughter Barbara Hyman's unflattering 1985
book ``My Mother's Keeper.''
   Addressing her daughter in the book, Miss Davis wrote: ``The sum
total of your having written this book is a glaring lack of loyalty
and thanks for the very privileged life I feel you have been
given.''
   In 1977 Miss Davis became the first woman to receive the
American Film Institute's Life Achievement Award, and in 1987 she
was a Kennedy Center Honors winner.
   She is survived by two adopted children, Michael Merrill and
Margot Merrill, and a daughter Barbara.
   Funeral arrangements were not immediately known.

   A band of boistrous demonstrators staged a
``die-in'' in front of the White House on Saturday, lying prone on
the street while chanting and waving signs calling for more federal
help to provide housing for people with AIDS.
   About 100 people dropped flat on their backs on Pennsylvania
Avenue, while other demonstrators drew chalk outlines around their
bodies in the fashion of police lines at a homicide site. The group
banged drums, blew whistles, and chanted such slogans as, ``We die,
they do nothing,'' and ``History will recall, Bush did nothing at
all.''
   One man strummed a guitar while lying on his back.
   They held up cardboard tombstones with epitaphs including;
``Forgotten and dying,'' and ``RIP, Really indecent politics.''
   President Bush is spending the weekend at Camp David, Md., and
did not see the demonstration.
   Group leaders said they wanted to dramatize the number of
homeless people with AIDS who have died in the streets due to lack
of shelter and AIDs treatment.
   Sponsored by the AIDS Coalition to Unleash Power, or ACT UP, the
group called for legislation that would provide $290 million for
housing for AIDS suffers in 1990-91, and for changes in the Housing
and Urban Development regulations to make AIDS victims eligible for
long-term housing assistance.
   The demonstration lasted about 10 minutes, with traffic blocked
off one-way on Pennsylvania by police, until the group marched off
to rejoin a massive housing near the Capitol.

   Placards have been painted, stirring
speeches rehearsed, riot police drilled and graphic photos mailed
to state lawmakers for a legislative showdown on abortion. But a
state Supreme Court ruling last week may have pre-empted the
purpose of the session.
   Legislators in other states, such as Pennsylvania, are
considering abortion bills as part of their regular sessions, but
Florida's four-day special session beginning Tuesday was supposed
to offer a focused battleground on the emotion-charged issue.
   It's the first legislative special session on abortion scheduled
to open since the U.S. Supreme Court's July 3 ruling upholding
Missouri laws restricting abortion.
   Estimates of the number of activists coming for the session
range up to 200,000, or double the population of this picturesque
city where the biggest excitement usually comes at Florida State
University and Florida A&amp;M football games.
   The activists are expected to pump as much as $4 million into
the local economy, but as far as lawmaking, the session may be a
wash.
   Legislative leaders already reluctant to tackle abortion said
the special session became a guaranteed waste of time and money
with a Thursday decision by the Florida Supreme Court. The court _
citing the state constitution's guarantee of privacy _ knocked down
a 1988 parental-consent law for minors seeking abortions.
   ``It's total chaos,'' said state Rep. Ben Graber, an
obstetrician who performs abortions. ``We're heading into a session
that was already vague, and now it's blurred. Obviously, we are
going to have constitutional problems with any bill.''
   Legislative leaders say Republican Gov. Bob Martinez, who
ordered the session, should postpone it. He rejects the idea, and
some say it's possible that the Legislature will come to order as
required by law, then adjourn without action.
   In calling the special session, Martinez noted that the next
60-day regular session of the Florida Legislature isn't scheduled
to begin until April 1990. That's too long to wait, said the
strongly anti-abortion governor.
   He proposed a package of abortion restrictions that include
testing for fetus viability before abortions can be performed after
the first trimester, restricting abortions in publicly funded
facilities, and increasing state regulation of abortion clinics.
   As the session's opening approached, state Rep. Tom Banjanin,
R-Pensacola, described abortion rights advocates as ``not
pro-choice, they're pro-death.''
   Rep. Elaine Gordon, D-Miami Beach, countered: ``We don't need
zygote zealots that are worshiping at the altar of Petrie dishes.''
   The heated rhetoric, and the fact that the state has seen the
bombings of several abortion clinics in recent years, has officials
taking extra security precautions.
   ``The problem is we really don't know what to expect,'' said
Tallahassee Police Sgt. Gary Lassiter. ``We don't know how
different groups will react to different things.''
   The city police force trained a 40-officer ``Alpha Force'' riot
squad for potential widespread civil disobedience. Monitoring
cameras were installed between state office buildings.
   ``Hopefully, they will protect the public's right to speak and
protect the legislators' right to live,'' said Senate President Bob
Crawford.
   Kenneth Connor, who heads the anti-abortion group Florida Right
to Life, is urging fellow activists to put ``our best foot
forward.'' The anti-abortion side is expected to outnumber
pro-choice forces during the special session.
   ``It would disserve the unborn for our people to engage in
unseemly conduct,'' Connor said.
   Politicians say an already high volume of abortion mail has
picked up steadily, not just in amount but in shock value, with
political and personal threats and color photos of butchered
fetuses.
   Anti-abortion lawmakers have received hundreds of small handmade
hangers, along with some regular hangers, symbolizing the
pro-choice side's contention that restricting abortion will spur
unsafe, illegal abortions.
   Martinez contended the session has already produced progress, by
raising discussion of an unborn child's rights.
   Opponents of Martinez, though, say the first-term governor has
boosted efforts to unseat him in 1990. Many polls indicate most
Floridians favor access to abortions. Feminist groups have pledged
to rally women voters against Martinez.
   ``I think he's in a boxing match with a tar baby,'' said Ted
Phelps, manager of the planned 1990 gubernatorial race of U.S. Rep.
Bill Nelson. ``It's an act of political grandstanding and he's
digging himself deeper and deeper into a hole.''
   ``It's not a question of being stubborn,'' counters Martinez.
``Whether or not something passes, it's not going to go away.''

<HEAD>Christians Press for Syrian Withdrawal</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ABDULLAH AL-SHEHRI</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>TAIF, Saudi Arabia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Lebanon's Christian lawmakers on
Saturday demanded guarantees of a Syrian withdrawal from Lebanon,
and Christian leader Gen. Michael Aoun reportedly pressed for a
pullout within six months.
   The 63 legislators were meeting in this western mountain resort
to try to end 14 years of civil war. Anti-Syrian Sunni Moslem
legislators supported the Christian pullout demands, deepening the
deadlock as the deliberations moved into their second week.
   The Maronite Catholics, the dominant Christian sect in Lebanon,
want a pledge for the withdrawal of 40,000 Syrian troops from
Lebanon before they will agree to political reforms that would give
Moslems an equal share of power.
   The Arab League, which sponsored the conference, has suggested a
Syrian withdrawal from Moslem sectors of Beirut within two years to
the Syrian-controlled Bekaa Valley in eastern Lebanon. After that,
Damascus would negotiate on troop levels with a new Lebanese
government.
   Lebanon has been ruled by two rival governments _ one Moslem and
one Christian _ since September 1988.
   The Syrian-backed Moslems have insisted there can be no pullout
until the Christians agree to the reforms.
   Conference sources who spoke on condition of anonymity said
Aoun, a Maronite, is pressing for a Syrian pullout within six
months.
   A Sunni Moslem lawmaker, Abdul-Majid Rafi'e of the northern
Syrian-controlled port of Tripoli, told reporters that the Syrians
should at least withdraw from Beirut before a parliamentary session
scheduled there for later this month to elect a new Lebanese
president.
   Many Lebanese Sunnis oppose the Syrian presence in their nation,
although they are powerless to do anything about it because they
have no military muscle.
   For the second straight day, no formal sessions were scheduled
Saturday as Arab League mediators sought to find a compromise to
break the impasse.
   Conference sources said a full session of the 33 Christian and
30 Moslem parliamentarians will not be held until a compromise is
reached.
   Saudi Arabian, Moroccan and Algerian mediators, who comprise the
Arab League committee on Lebanon, sought international support for
compromise proposals and had intensive contacts with U.S., Soviet,
French and Iraqi envoys, the sources reported.
   The Soviet Union is Syria's main ally and also has close links
with Iraq. France has historic links with the Maronites.
   Iraq, Syria's main Arab rival, has been arming Aoun to help him
confront Damascus in an attempt to thwart Syrian ambitions in
Lebanon.
   However, all these outside powers have supported the Arab
League's peacemaking effort.
   Syrian forces moved into Lebanon in 1976, the year after the
civil war broke out, under a peacekeeping mandate by the 22-member
Arab League.
   Aoun claims the Syrians abrogated that mandate by openly siding
with Lebanon's Moslems.
   The Arab League peace plan announced last month hinges on the
Christians surrendering some of their privileges. The Christians
have dominated the government, parliament, judiciary and army since
independence from France in 1943.
   Along with a phased Syrian withdrawal leading to a security pact
between Damascus and a united Lebanese government, the plan also
calls for the withdrawal of Israeli forces occupying a border strip
in southern Lebanon.
   Syria, which considers Lebanon to be vital to its strategic
defense against Israel, has linked any troop withdrawal to an
Israeli pullout and political reforms.
   Most Moslem lawmakers and some pro-Syrian Christians favor the
Arab league blueprint.
   They contend the Syrians are the only force powerful enough to
keep Lebanon's unruly militias in check and maintain order in the
war-ravaged Mediterranean country.
   Despite the differences, the meeting has made some progress.
   The lawmakers have agreed to divide seats in Lebanon's National
Assembly equally between the two sides. Since 1943, the Christians
have had a 6-5 edge.
   They were considered to be the majority in 1943. But Moslems now
form an estimated 55 percent of the 4 million population.
   The 99-seat parliament was last elected in 1972. Twenty-five
legislators have died or been killed since then and former
President Amin Gemayel's seat has been vacant since he was elected
in 1982. Ten of the surviving legislators are not attending the
Taif talks.

<HEAD>FDA Asking Removal of Generic Urinary Tract Infection Medication</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DEBORAH MESCE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Food and Drug Administration wants a New
York pharmaceutical manufacturer to recall an antibiotic used to
treat urinary tract infections because it believes the company
cheated on product safety tests, an FDA official said Saturday.
   An FDA investigation found indications that Bolar Pharmaceutical
Co. Inc. substituted the brandname product for its own in tests
three years ago to win approval of its own generic product, said
FDA spokesman Jeff Nesbit.
   ``Because of the evidence indicating a substitution, it is not
possible for the FDA to assure whether the Bolar product is
therapeutically equivalent to the brandname product at this time,''
Nesbit said.
   Bolar, based in Copiague, N.Y., and the largest of the generic
drug makers under FDA scrutiny, won approval for its generic
version of the drug nitrofurantoin in June 1988.
   Bolar's product is the only generic drug approved as
therapeutically equivalent to Macrodantin, made by Norwich-Eaton
Pharmaceuticals, currently on the market, although other dosage
forms of nitrofurantoin are available.
   Though the FDA wants to remove Bolar's drug from the market, it
has not asked people taking the generic medication to switch to the
brandname product.
   The FDA does not have the authority to remove a product from the
market. If a company does not comply with an FDA recall request,
the agency can only force a recall in court.
   The Washington Post in Saturday editions quoted Bolar President
Robert Shulman as saying the company would investigate
``extenuating circumstances'' surrounding the drug over the weekend
and decide by early this week whether to recall the product.
   Telephone calls to Bolar's headquarters were not answered on
Saturday.
   The Post quoted Shulman as saying there is ``no difference''
between the drug that was tested and Bolar's version of
nitrofurantoin on the market. He said the company will look at the
matter and added that ``there are circumstances surrounding the
manufacturer and testing (of this product) that the FDA is not
aware of.''
   The FDA is also trying to remove from the market Bolar's version
of the popular high-blood-pressure drug Dyazide because of
questions about whether the company's product is therapeutically
equivalent to the brandname drug. The FDA is investigating whether
Bolar switched samples of the brandname product with its own in
safety tests to win approval.
   The Post quoted unidentified federal officials as saying Bolar
is also under criminal investigation regarding data it submitted to
the FDA concerning its version of Dyazide.
   The FDA is also investigating another alleged incident of
product-switching by Bolar involving an anti-psychotic drug it was
developing in 1982. Bolar officials have said the incident was a
manufacturing error and that the version of thioridazine involved
was never marketed.
   The FDA is investigating more than a dozen generic drug
companies in the wake of allegations of fraud and corruption within
the industry and FDA's generic drug division.
   One of them, Vitarine Pharmaceutical Inc. of Springfield
Gardens, N.Y., has admitted to using the same tactic the FDA is
accusing Bolar of using.
   Vitarine halted distribution of its Dyazide copy in the summer
after admitting it had substituted samples of the brandname drug
for its own in tests required for FDA approval.

   A gallery owner has put together an art exhibit
that offers something to offend just about everyone, including
works by two artists who outraged Sen. Jesse Helms and led to the
bill just passed in Congress.
   Greg Kucera assembled the 20-artist show, called ``Taboo,'' with
his own money, saying ``people have a right to see these works of
art.''
   ``We live in a world where diversity of opinion gives this
culture its richness,'' Kucera said. Without the right to examine
controversial and sometimes disturbing works of art, ``we would be
fascists.''
   Many if not most of the works would presumeably not be eligible
to receive public funds from the National Endowment for the Arts
and the National Endowment for the Humanities under a bill approved
by the Senate on Saturday after passing the House of
Representatives earlier in the week. The bill gives officials the
power to deny grant money to artworks they deem obscene.
   Kucera's show includes works by two artists who angered some
lawmakers, most notably Helms, the North Carolina Republican who
led the effort to prohibit federal aid for art he considers
offensive.
   Helms noted the National Endowment for the Arts had spent
$45,000 to back an exhibit by Andres Serrano, which featured a
photograph titled ``Piss Christ'' of a crucifix in what is
allegedly urine, and by the late Robert Mapplethorpe, whose
photographs depict homosexual acts and children in explicit poses.
   Helms' proposal sought to prohibit federal aid for ``obscene''
or indecent art, and for works offensive to a religion, ethnic or
age group, race, or the disabled.
   A compromise version, approved by the House and now before the
Senate, would bar the endowments from issuing grants for
exhibitions considered ``obscene,'' including works depicting
sadomasochism, homoeroticism, sexual exploitation of children or
people involved in sex acts. Officials would also have to find the
work lacks ``serious literary, artistic, political or scientific
value.''
   Serrano's ``Piss Christ'' and some works by Mapplethorpe are
included in Kucera's show, which opened Thursday and runs through
Oct. 29.
   Kucera said about 1,000 people, five times the normal number,
showed up opening night and that the catalog is selling briskly.
   Kucera boarded up the plate glass windows in his small
storefront gallery before the opening and hired a private security
guard. But by late Friday only one protester had appeared.
   The artists in the exhibit all have found themselves the subject
of controversy at one time or another, Kucera says.
   It includes a crucified Mickey Mouse titled ``Homage to Jim
Bakker'' by a Winston-Salem, N.C., artist who goes by the name
Richard C. Other religious themes are the late Howard Kottler's
``Bar Mitzvah Boy,'' a plate featuring a portrait of a pope and
Athens, Ga., artist Bill Paul's bound and nailed-shut bible.
   Photographs of sometimes naked, bloodied or bruised children in
the exhibit are Lexington, Va., artist Sally Mann's own children,
and the bruises and bloody noses were the result of the usual
childhood horseplay, Kucera said.

   The Justice Department is defending Attorney
General Dick Thornburgh's use of government aircraft for private
travel, including a trip to a convention in Hawaii aboard a Boeing
727 in which he and five assistants were the only passengers.
   David Runkel, a spokesman for Thornburgh, said the Federal
Bureau of Investigation ``has determined that for his personal
security and the security of his communications that he should
travel by government airplane.''
   The FBI is a branch of the Justice Department, which Thornburgh
heads.
   Runkel said Thornburgh was surprised, however, to learn that the
only government aircraft for the Hawaii trip was a 727, a large,
commercial-sized jet used by the U.S. Marshals Service to fly
prisoners around the country.
   ``He thought that it was bizarre when he got inside the plane,
but the 727 was the only plane available that could get him
there,'' Runkel said.
   The flight from San Francisco to Honolulu cost the government
$38,000, according to a report Saturday in The New York Times. The
paper said it had examined records showing that Thornburgh's 48
trips in the last year cost taxpayers $191,000.
   The General Accounting Office, an investigative arm of Congress,
is looking into the trips, the paper reported.
   More than a year ago, Thornburgh restricted government-paid
travel by Justice Department employees to trips directly related to
the job. Conventions, such as the trip to Hawaii, are among the
``people-to-people type'' exchanges that were ruled out.
   Former Attorney General Edwin Meese III had been criticized for
his travels, including a trip to a legal symposium with five other
department officials in Japan. Meese usually took commercial
flights.
   Runkel said Thornburgh would not have flown the 727 except that
another plane had broken down.
   But a letter from the Marshals Service, also an arm of the
Justice Department, said the jet had been requested six weeks
before the Hawaii trip, the Times reported.
   A unidentified FBI official told the Times that the Hawaii leg
of the trip cost $38,000. A first-class, round-trip ticket between
San Francisco and Honolulu costs about $1,400.

   Actress Jane Fonda's daughter was released
Saturday from jail a day after she and her alleged heroin-carrying
boyfriend were arrested outside a reputed drug den, officials said.
   Vanessa Vadim, 21, was released on her own recognizance Saturday
morning after a brief appearance in Manhattan Criminal Court, where
she pleaded innocent to misdemeanor charges.
   Her mother did not attend the hearing, but the two were reunited
at a Manhattan hotel after Ms. Vadim's release, a publicist said.
   ``Vanessa has not been charged with possession of any illegal
substance. The charges against her, basically, are for interfering
with someone else's arrest,'' said a statement from Ms. Fonda read
to The Associated Press by publicist Stephen Rivers.
   ``Vanessa is a good daughter, a serious student of whom I am
very proud, and I stand behind her through this,'' Ms. Fonda said.
   The daughter's attorney, Robert I. Kalina, predicted ``a
favorable resolution of this matter.''
   Ms. Vadim had attended the premiere of her mother's new film,
``Old Gringo,'' just hours before her arrest Friday morning on
charges of obstructing governmental administration, loitering for
the purpose of purchasing drugs and disorderly conduct.
   Police said the arrests occurred at a decrepit building officers
were monitoring in a buy-and-bust operation that netted 11 other
suspects Friday.
   Her boyfriend, 22-year-old Thomas Feegal, was charged with
criminal possession of a controlled substance _ two plastic bags
believed to contain heroin _ and possession of a hypodermic needle,
said police spokesman Sgt. Peter Sweeney.
   ``The whole thing is really sad. These are affluent people who
should have everything going for them, and they come down here to
shoot down their lives like this,'' said narcotics unit Capt.
Stephen Nasta.
   The couple told police they were buying the drugs for a college
study on narcotics use, Nasta said. Nasta, citing the 8 a.m. arrest
time and Feegal's possession of a needle, said he did not believe
that story.
   Ms. Vadim is a student at Brown University in Rhode Island and
Feegal attends New York University.
   Ms. Fonda, who attended the movie premiere with her daughter,
canceled a scheduled trip to Europe after the arrest and remained
in New York, an associate said.
   Ms. Vadim is the actress' only daughter, and her father is
filmmaker Roger Vadim. Ms. Fonda also has a 15-year-old son, Troy,
from her marriage to California state Assemblyman Tom Hayden. The
couple announced their separation earlier this year.

<TEXT>
   The Senate gave final congressional approval
Saturday to putting strings on government aid to the arts by giving
officials the power to deny grant money for works they believe may
be obscene.
   In a weekend session called to tackle pressing budgetary
matters, the Senate sent President Bush a spending bill containing
the art limitations on a 91-6 vote. Bush is expected to sign the
measure.
   The House four days ago voted 381-41 to adopt the same spending
measure, a compromise fashioned by a House-Senate conference
committee.
   The funding prohibition _ which constitutional lawyers say
appears to be the first restriction on federal art assistance based
on content _ also was a compromise. Conservatives wanted a stricter
ban, while liberals argued that any limits would inhibit artists.
   The bill forbids the National Endowment for the Arts and the
National Endowment for the Humanities to finance works that
endowment officials believe ``may be considered obscene.'' It
specifically precludes subsidies for art depicting sadomasochism,
homoeroticism, child exploitation or sex acts between people.
   To deny the money, however, those officials would also have to
conclude that a work lacked serious literary, artistic, political
or scientific value.
   Final passage came as Sen. Jesse Helms, R-N.C., lost a
last-ditch fight to toughen the restrictions. The Senate rejected,
62-35, his proposal to add prohibitions against federal aid for art
that depicts, ``in a patently offensive way, sexual or excretory
activities or organs.'' They then adopted the art restrictions in
the bill on a voice vote.
   Helms argued that the government should not subsidize art that
many people find offensive, and that his proposal _ using language
from a Supreme Court decision _ would prevent that.
   ``No artist, no citizen has a right to intrude into taxpayers'
pockets,'' Helms said.
   Critics of the Helms restrictions said they would amount to
censorship and noted that only about 20 of 85,000 federal arts
grants have caused major controversy over the years.
   ``In a free society, we must not yield to the appeals of the
know-nothings,'' said Sen. Edward Kennedy, D-Mass. ``We must not
embrace the calls for censorship.''
   When the fight began last summer, Helms had sought to ban
government assistance for obscene or indecent art, including
portrayals of sadomasochism, homoeroticism, child exploitation and
sexual acts between people. He also wanted to bar federal grants
for works that belittle any religion, race, ethnic group, age group
or handicap.
   Current federal law permits the National Endowment for the Arts
to finance projects that ``in the experts' view foster excellence,
are reflective of exceptional talent, and have significant
literary, scholarly, cultural or artistic merit.''
   Conservative crticism earlier this year of two federally backed
arts exhibits sparked action in Congress. The endowment spent
$15,000 for a show that featured an Andres Serrano photograph of a
crucifix in urine, and $30,000 to display photographs by the late
Robert Mapplethorpe that pictured children in suggestive poses and
homosexual acts.
   House liberals thwarted a conservative effort last summer to
eliminate or severely slash the endowment's $170 million budget
because of the exhibitions, settling for a symbolic $45,000 cut in
the agency's financing for this year.
   The Senate, however, adopted Helms' original provision on a July
26 voice vote, toning it down in another vote Sept. 29.
   Many lawmakers complained that the controversy left them in a
politically ticklish position: vote for the restrictions or be left
vulnerable to election-year charges of supporting federally
financed pornography. With conservatives aggressively pursuing
strong restrictions, liberals were pressured into accepting
limitations in some form.
   The restrictions are to last one year. A commission established
by the legislation will study the endowments' decision-making in
awarding grants and whether standards for qualifying works are
needed.
   The endowment is also ordered to give Congress a 30-day warning
if funds will be granted to the Southeastern Center for
Contemporary Art in Winston-Salem, N.C., which showed the Serrano
picture, and the Institute for Contemporary Art at the University
of Pennsylvania, which exhibited the Mapplethorpe photographs.
   The $11.2 billion measure for the Interior Department, cultural
and other programs is for fiscal 1990, which began Sunday.
   The legislation also extends for another year a ban on the
leasing of offshore tracts for oil and gas drilling; imposes new
restrictions on lobbyists who seek federal money for clients; and
allows lumber companies to cut timber on federally owned land in
the Northwest while protecting areas inhabited by the rare spotted
owl.
   Voting against final passage of the spending bill were Wyche
Fowler, D-Ga.; Howell Heflin, D-Ala.; Jesse Helms, R-N.C.; Gordon
Humphrey, R-N.H.; Daniel Moynihan, D-N.Y.; William Roth, R-Del. Not
voting were Kit Bond, R-Mo.; Thad Cochran, R-Miss.; and Sam Nunn,
D-Ga.

   The Senate sent compromise legislation to
President Bush on Saturday that would free up sales of timber from
old-growth federal forests in the Northwest while protecting the
habitat of the spotted owl.
   On a 91-6 vote, the Senate gave final congressional approval to
an $11.2 billion spending measure for land and cultural programs
for fiscal 1990 that contained the lumber provisions. Bush is
expected to sign the measure, which is for the fiscal year that
began last Sunday.
   The legislation also includes new restrictions on lobbyists, a
continued moratorium on offshore oil and gas drilling, and limits
on federal subsidies to art considered obscene.
   There was no separate vote Saturday on the forestry language,
which was worked out a week ago by House-Senate negotiators. The
Senate was working over the weekend on budget legislation.
   Disputes over logging federally-owned tracts in the Northwest
have raged for years. Environmentalists argue that rare spotted
owls and the virgin forests they inhabit must be preserved, while
timber interests and others say felling the trees creates jobs and
boosts the region's economy.
   ``Our state is not about to be clear cut from corner to
corner,'' Sen. Slade Gorton, R-Wash., said Saturday.
   ``Our national forests belong to the many,'' countered Sen.
Wyche Fowler, D-Ga. ``They are not private tree farms for the few.''
   Gorton ended up voting for the compromise measure.
   The compromise legislation allows 9.6 billion board feet of
timber to be sold in the region's federal forests this fiscal year.
It strengthens legal protections for the owls, while requiring
environmentalists to let some timber sales now blocked by court
order to proceed.
   Restrictions are also placed on the extent of legal challenges
by environmentalists seeking to halt future sales.
   The bill, which the House approved 381-41 last Tuesday, extends
for another year prohibitions on leasing and drilling off Alaska,
California, Florida and much of the Northeast.
   Pre-leasing studies in waters off the California coast would
also be prohibited for the first five months of 1990, giving
drilling foes additional time to try to block future work.
   Lobbyists who try to win federal monies for their clients would
be forbidden from being paid with those tax dollars. Lobbyists
whose contracts exceed $100,000 would have to file periodic reports
with Congress on their activities. Fines between $10,000 and
$100,000 could be levied on violators.
   Federal art grants would also be withheld from works that
officials believe is obscene and that lack serious artistic value.

   Remembering Bette Davis: She never changed.
   When this reporter first met Bette Davis 45 years ago, she was
full of Yankee spunk, fiercely independent, at war with Jack
Warner. In an interview last April, she was frail but ever
challenging, at war with the world.
   One of the first meetings came when Miss Davis returned to
Warner Bros. after the birth of her daughter.
   ``A woman is never a complete woman until she has become a
mother,'' Miss Davis proclaimed. She may have had second thoughts
40 years later when the same daughter wrote a book attacking her.
   In 1949, Miss Davis was filming the fateful ``Beyond the
Forest,'' her last film under contract to Warner Bros. She always
had something to rail about, and this time it was the industry's
self-censorship.
   ``Hollywood tries to combine entertainment for both kids and
adults in the same picture,'' Miss Davis said. ``The result is a
movie which isn't suitable for either.'' Seventeen years later, the
industry followed her hint and establish the rating system.
   In 1961, Miss Davis had just divorced her fourth husband, Gary
Merrill, and was back in Hollywood making ``A Pocketful of
Miracles'' with director Frank Capra. She continued her outspoken
tradition.
   ``I don't think marriage can work, not for career women,'' she
declared. ``God knows I've tried. It's too bad it won't work,
because I like men. I just can't stay married to them.'' She kept
her vow never to marry again.
   Miss Davis had returned to the stage in 1962, touring in ``An
Evening with Carl Sandburg.'' She explained:
   ``I sat around here for a year and didn't get a call from the
studios. Oh, yes, I had a chance to play Burt Lancaster's mother in
a picture they made in Mexico. I'll be damned if I'll play Burt
Lancaster's mother after 30 years in this business.''
   In 1963, Miss Davis was gloating over the success of ``Whatever
Happened to Baby Jane?'' after it had been turned down by every
studio boss including Jack Warner.
   ``Oh, they simply kill me,'' she said with a wicked glint in her
eye. ``They couldn't understand the picture's success. `It had to
be a freak.' Oh, if they could only learn! It's still names that
sell movies, names that have established a reputation with the
public by past performances. Not the so-called names who are used
in picture after picture even though they can't draw flies at the
box office.''
   Miss Davis became the fifth recipient of the American Film
Institute's Lifetime Achievement Award in 1977. ``I suppose after
four men,'' she said, ``they decided, `Let's give it to a dame.'''
   At 68, she seemed in exuberant good health, but she admitted,
``After 48 years in the acting business, you begin to wonder, `Is
it possible you're still alive?'''
   Later in 1977, Miss Davis was in Luxor, Egypt, filming ``Death
on the Nile'' with an all-star cast. Characteristically, she did
not reside at a modern hotel with the rest of the cast and crew.
She occupied a grand suite at the Old Winter Palace with a sweeping
view of the Nile and the Valley of the Kings.
   She grumbled about being on the remote location: ``When I was at
Warners, I was never off the lot, never! They built everything on
the back lot, from a Welsh village (`The Corn is Green') to the
Petrified Forest. I defy you to tell the difference from the real
thing.''
   In April 1989, at her apartment in West Hollywood, she was a
frail presence. A stroke and a mastectomy had taken their toll, and
she seemed painfully thin. But her voice still crackled with
no-nonsense authority.
   She summed up her contentious lifetime as stated on a small
needlepoint pillow that read ``No guts, no glory.''
   ``Oh, yes, it's the truth. To dare to be hated _ that takes
guts.''

   The party leadership's commitment to free elections by June at
the latest, along with the acceptance of international human rights
provisions, had put Hungary in the forefront of reform within the
Warsaw Pact alliance even before Saturday's vote.
   Only Poland, with the Soviet bloc's first government not
controlled by Communists, has come as far as Hungary in its
democratic strivings.
   The new party, which draws on socialist and communist ideals,
supports ``humanism, freedom and democracy,'' the document stated.
It seeks alliances with reform-oriented communist parties as well
as socialist and social democratic parties, according to the
resolution.
   Liberals grouped in the Reform Union faction had urged since the
congress opened Friday that the new party be free of Communist
Party conservatives. However, in a clear attempt to gain broad
support the position paper avoided direct mention of cleansing of
ranks.
   It instead ``called into its ranks all those who agree with its
platform, who accept the ground rules.'' But the document also
provided that members of the old party would not automatically be
members of the new one by proposing that new membership booklets be
issued by Nov. 10.
   Originally even more wide-ranging in its intention to split with
the past, the reform leadership watered down the document late
Saturday to gain the support of the People's Democratic Forum _
less progressive than the Reform Union but more liberal than the
conservative groupings.
   Members of the two liberal factions debated passionately _
yelling could be heard from a conference hall at one point _ before
agreement was reached on the compromise document.
   The document declared the new party would support the concept of
private and state property, calling for ``a mixed property social
market economy,'' and ``the development of ... a multiparty
parliamentary democracy.''
   Communisat Party chairman Rezsoe Nyers, a moderate reformer
appointed in an attempt to bridge ideological differences among the
four-member party leadership, praised the position paper as ``a
compromise serving the rebirth of our party as a new left-wing
Socialist Party.''
   In a surprise turn, Nyers disclosed that former Politburo member
Janos Berecz, one of the most bitter opponents of reform at the
congress, had asked whether there was room for him in the new party.
   ``I said `Yes, as a reform Communist,''' Nyers said to cheers
from some of the delegates.
   Earlier in the day Berecz had suggested he was ready to be
sacrificed for his communist ideals and said the rank-and-file
membership would not stand for substantive change.
   ``You can tie me to a stake, but you can't do that to the
720,000 party members represented by the delegates,'' he said to
scattered boos and whistles.
   The strong approval of the document was a blow to conservatives
at the congress who had supported plans to make some changes in the
existing party but rejected founding a new one.
   Berecz, who had lost his Politburo post in recent party
infighting, had spoken bitterly of his liberal rivals earlier
Saturday.
   ``I want to conserve my communist past,'' he declared, adding
that differences with Imre Pozsgay, the leading reformer in the
four-man party leadership, ``truly put us in different parties.''
   Pozsgay, the party candidate for the newly created government
post of president in the planned elections, had told reporters
earlier he was closer to social democratic ideals than traditional
communist ones, which he said ``led to a dead end in Eastern
Europe, wherever they were tried.''
   He described Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's campaign
for restructuring and openness as an encouraging ``wind for our
reforms,'' but emphasized that Hungary's decisions were independent
of other countries.
   Premier Miklos Nemeth, also a reformer and member of the
collective party leadership, told the delegates that the new party
would have no room ``for those who have blood on their hands'' from
past Communist Party excesses.
   Another test of reform and conservative strength at the congress
was expected Sunday in voting on leadership posts.
   Reformers, with nearly 500 committed delegates, represent the
strongest faction at the congress with staunch conservatives
numbering less than 100.
   But several reformers said the conservatives were continuing
efforts to win over the more than 700 publicly uncomitted delegates.

   Thousands of Soviets marched in an icy drizzle to
the walls of the Kremlin on Saturday in a show of support for Boris
N. Yeltsin and two other parliamentarians they say are threatened
by Communist Party bosses.
   ``Yeltsin, Gdlyan, Ivanov _ they are our conscience!'' read one
sign supporting the parliamentarians that was carried by a
protester down Gorky Street, Moscow's most fashionable shopping
thoroughfare, as thick crowds looked on.
   Demonstrators also opposed the monopoly on political power by
the Communist Party, and sought establishment of a Western-style
democracy. The protest on Constitution Day, a Soviet holiday, also
demanded that civil and human rights outlined in the 1977 Soviet
Constitution be scrupulously observed.
   Under President Mikhail S. Gorbachev, a lawyer by training, the
Kremlin has acknowledged that constitutionally protected freedoms
of speech, assembly and others have been neglected or violated
outright in the past. It also ordered a rewrite of the
constitution, with Gorbachev himself in charge.
   As a cold rain fell, thousands of members and sympathizers of
the grass-roots pro-democracy Russian People's Front linked hands
to form a human chain whose sections stretched for miles along the
center of Gorky Street, the artery leading from Moscow's heart to
its northwest suburbs.
   Knots of demonstrators were seen along the road as far away as
Sheremetyevo, Moscow's international airport 20 miles from the
Kremlin.
   Although it was not possible to count the participants, they
were far fewer than than more than 1 million residents of Estonia,
Latvia and Lithuania who formed a human chain Aug. 23 to denounce
the 1939 Nazi-Soviet pact that consigned their once independent
homelands to the Kremlin orbit.
   Eyes streaming and noses running from the cold, the
demonstrators stood single file blocking the lane of Gorky Street
reserved for limousines of the state and party elite. Many shouted
opposition to the ruling 20-million member Communist Party, and
some even waved the once banned white, blue and red tricolor of
czarist Russia.
   ``The Communist Party is a mafia _ the first mafia in the
history of the world to take power,'' said one protester, retiree
Valery Kazakov from the southern Russian city of Rostov-on-Don.
``The main thing is to find out who is actually behind that mafia.''
   The protest occurred while Gorbachev was in East Germany to
attend ceremonies marking the country's 40th anniversary.
   The three members of the Congress of People's Deputies the
protesters defended have earned fame and widespread support by
noisily fighting party bosses.
   The strapping rubber-faced Yeltsin is the best-known example. He
first got in trouble with Gorbachev for claiming the president's
program of economic and political reforms was being implemented too
slowly, and was fired as Moscow party boss in November 1987.
   Yeltsin, 58, staged a spectacular political comeback this spring
by winning election to the Congress from Moscow with 89 percent of
the vote over party opposition. Last month, he came under attack in
the party daily Pravda for allegedly going on a drinking and
shopping binge while visiting the United States.
   Pravda later apologized to Yeltsin, saying the charges,
contained in an Italian newspaper article it reprinted without
comment, could not be substantiated. But to Soviets, the affair was
more evidence that party potentates were out to get the maverick
Communist, who has opposed privileges received by the party elite
and called for a better life for the average Soviet.
   ``Pravda is not the truth,'' proclaimed a sign worn by one
Yeltsin supporter. Near the Kremlin, a woman in a white ski cap
made a bonfire from a wad of Pravda's Saturday newspapers.
   Prosecutors Telman Gdlyan and Nikolai Ivanov alleged corruption
at the party's top levels involving Yegor K. Ligachev, the Siberian
widely thought to be Gorbachev's conservative nemesis on the ruling
Politburo. Last month, the party's Central Committee ordered the
two held accountable for leveling groundless charges.
   ``All the hubbub around these brave men is a disgrace for a
great country,'' said Tatyana Tarasova, 40, a producer of cartoons.
``There is such a scandalous quantity of lies.'' Nearby, other
protesters chanted ``hands off Gdlyan and Ivanov!'
   Breaking the human chain after about 1{ hours, about 3,000
demonstrators marched to a square near the Kremlin's high red-brick
walls.
   ``Democracy, democracy!'' hundreds chanted as they passed
Moscow's city hall. Others shouted ``Down with Article 6!'' the
constitutional provision defining the Communist Party's role as the
``leading force'' in society.

   A march by white supremacists Saturday in
the birthplace of the Ku Klux Klan attracted its largest audience
from police, who presided over a gathering that was peaceful _ if
not quiet.
   ``This is what the scum of America tried to prevent for 60
days,'' said the Rev. Richard G. Butler, pastor of the Church of
Jesus Christ Christian-Aryan Nations.
   About 200 members of the Hayden Lake, Idaho, organization and
various Ku Klux Klan and skinhead groups marched to honor Sam
Davis, a Civil War hero of the Confederacy who was executed by
Union forces here.
   The Klan was founded in the town, about 70 miles southwest of
Nashville, after the Civil War, though the modern Klan traces its
roots to another branch founded in Georgia.
   Town leaders said the group could not be denied a permit to
gather, and the community responded with a campaign to close
businesses in the town of 7,600 for the day. Residents also put up
orange ribbons symbolizing brotherhood and a wreath of orange
ribbons in the hands of a statue of Davis on the town square.
   Most businesses did opt to close, Police Chief Stanley Newton
said.
   ``There's not a soul out anywere,'' he said Saturday morning, a
few hours before the supremacists arrived. ``You'd think it was a
ghost town.''
   Robert Lawson, the state's commissioner of public safety, said
100 state police, 100 local officers and from 60 to 100
intelligence officers from agencies outside the state monitored the
march.
   About 40 state troopers with riot helmets and batons stood by
and a police helicopter circled overhead.
   There was no counter-demonstration, although after Louis Beam of
the Aryan Nations led the marchers in three chants of ``Hail Sam
Davis,'' someone in the crowd of about 100 spectators responded
with: ``The hail with you.''
   Police blocked off all streets leading to the square and kept
the curious off the street as the marchers, led by two skinhead
drummers, marched by, chanting ``White Power!'' ``Hail Victory!''
and other slogans.
   Many of the racists carried Confederate flags and wore Klan
robes or military-style uniforms bearing Nazi and Klan insignia.
   The group marched around the courthouse, heard two speeches,
marched once more around the square and returned to their cars
about a half hour after the demonstration began.
   Plainclothes police videotaped the rally and wrote down the
license plate numbers of some marchers.
   Larry Whitlock, a special agent for the Georgia Bureau of
Investigation, was observing for the agency's Anti-Terrorist Squad.
   ``I was surprised. This is the first time the Aryan Nations has
put on something like this away from Hayden Lake,'' Whitlock said.
``I would have thought they would have got a lot more support out
of the Klan up here.''
   Diana Kirkpatrick, who watched part of the rally with her
husband and 16-month-old son, said the town overreacted by closing
businesses for the day.
   ``If they hadn't done that it wouldn't have been such a big
deal,'' she said. ``They got the whole town scared.''
   Typical of those who marched was Randal Smith of Dallas Ga., who
carried a business card that described him as grand dragon of the
Southern White Knights of the Ku Klux Klan.
   Smith said about 30 members of his group were attending the
march, and complained that if a civil rights group had marched
``the town would be wide open, the welcome mats out.''

   The Prudence Island School probably has
the fastest and most orderly fire drills in Rhode Island, if not
the world. And why not _ a 6-year-old and two 5-year-olds make up
the entire student body.
   Shannon Cubellis and Daniel Jenness, both 5-year-old
kindergartners, and first-grader Ethel Flynn, 6, quickly lined up
and marched behind teacher Elizabeth Hambly when the fire alarm
buzzed on a recent day.
   They congregated calmly at the end of the school's driveway
until it was time to return to class.
   Ethel was the first one to school that day, bounding in seven
minutes before class started at 9 a.m. As the first, she got to
ring the school's bell, tugging on the rope 13 times.
   The girl beamed when Hambly admired her denim dress and purple
sweater.
   ``You look beautiful,'' the teacher said.
   The 93-year-old school on the island, linked to Portsmouth by
ferry, was closed six years ago because there weren't enough
students. The island's older children take the 30-minute ferry ride
into Portsmouth to attend middle and high schools, but parents of
elementary-level children opted to teach them at home rather than
put them on the ferry at such tender ages.
   Portsmouth School Superintendent Mario Mancieri said parents
finally persuaded him to reopen the school about a month ago.
   ``My first reaction was, `We have a ferry service. Avail
yourself of that,''' he said. ``Then we started talking about young
children. Someone asked me, `How would you like to put a 5-year-old
on a ferry every morning?' I started thinking about that.''
   Hambly, 27, drives five miles from her home in Portsmouth to
catch the ferry in Bristol each school day.
   Once off the boat, Hambly hops into a car provided by the school
department. She drives about a mile down a narrow, winding road
lined with old cars and quaint cottages and summer homes to the
schoolhouse.
   Prudence Island, with a permanent population of about 200, is
part of the town of Portsmouth.
   Mancieri said he realized the money that would be spent to
transport younger children from the island to Portsmouth could be
used to reopen the schoolhouse.
   He said it would have cost the school district about $35,000 a
year to ship the three students to the mainland on special,
$300-a-trip ferry runs not on the boat's normal schedule.
   Instead, the Portsmouth School Department spent between $20,000
and $30,000 to make over the island's school building, including
asbestos removal, smoke alarms and new paint.
   Shannon and Daniel, the kindergartners, get out of school at
12:30 p.m., while Ethel remains until 3:30 p.m. She doesn't seem to
mind that the boys are free to go home early and play.
   ``After they leave I have some lunch and then I do some of my
work,'' she said.
   Hambly said her school would get at least one more student in
two years, but until then, unless someone moves to the island with
a youngster, it's just going to be the four of them. And to make
sure the students don't miss out on making friends, there'll be
periodic visits to other schools.
   ``Other teachers couldn't get to know their students as well as
I'm going to get to know these three,'' Hambly said. ``There's more
one-to-one teaching and learning.''
   Hambly, after only a month on the job, has three loyal fans in
her students.
   Shannon wants to be a telephone repairman when he grows up and
Daniel wants to be a fireman. Daniel would have to move off the
island because firefighters here are volunteers and he wants to
make money.
   Ethel said she wants to be a teacher.
   ``Just like Ms. Hambly,'' she said.

<HEAD>Army Bars Peace Group From Meeting With Palestinians</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TULKAREM, Occupied West Bank (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The army Saturday barred 700
Israeli peace activists from entering an Arab town to talk with
Palestinians.
   In the occupied Gaza Strip, Israeli troops shot and wounded
seven Palestinians, authorities said.
   At least 585 Palestinains have been killed and more than 12,000
wounded in the 21-month-old uprising against Israeli rule of the
occupied territories. Forty Israelis have died in the violence and
127 Palestinians have been killed by fellow Arabs on suspicion of
cooperating with Israel.
   An army spokesman said the West Bank town of Tulkarem, where the
peace meeting was scheduled between Palestinians and the Israeli
activists, was a ``closed military area'' and that only residents
were permitted to enter.
   The spokesman, who could not be identified under standing
regulations, said Defense Minister Yitzhak Rabin had refused to
grant permission to the left-wing Peace Now group to enter the
Palestinian town of about 50,000, 22 miles northeast of Tel Aviv.
He refused to elaborate.
   The peace activists, many waving banners reading ``Talk Peace
with the PLO Now,'' held a demonstration at roadblocks outside the
town. They were joined by two left-wing members of parliament and
Faisal Husseini, a leading Palestinian activist.
   ``We all know that Israelis could talk with Palestinians if the
roadblocks between us were removed,'' Husseini said.
   ``I want to tell you that we Palestinians have paid a heavy
price and will continue to do so until the forces of peace will
win,'' Husseini said in Arabic. His remarks were simultaneously
translated into Hebrew.
   Dedi Zucker, a left-wing legislator from the Citizens Rights
Movement, said: ``We must do all we can for peace now so we don't
have to attend funerals later.''
   Yael Dayan, daughter of Israeli war hero Moshe Dayan, greeted
Husseini and said she brought a message of peace.
   ``Husseini's father and my father fought each other in the
past,'' she said. ``I hope my childen and those of Husseini will
live together in peace.''
   Moshe Dayan served as defense minster during the 1967 Middle
East war, when Israel's armies seized the West Bank from Jordan and
the Gaza Strip from Egypt.
   Husseini's father, Abdel Qader, commanded a Palestinian force of
irregulars during the 1948 Middle East war. He was killed in a
battle for Jerusalem.
   After the demonstration a few leaders of Peace Now were able to
slip into Tulkarem, where they met with Mayor Hilmi Hanoun.
   The leaders, who asked not to be identified, quoted Hanoun as
saying: ``The moment a Palestinian state is born, we will have
peace.''

   The $20 million campaign for governor of
Virginia has produced a ``Who's Who'' list of celebrity givers,
from entertainer Bill Cosby to former White House Chief of Staff
Donald Regan.
   Even some news media names are listed on campaign finance
reports of those who have pumped money into the race between
Democrat L. Douglas Wilder, the state's lieutenant governor, and
Republican J. Marshall Coleman, a former Virginia attorney general.
   One is Ed Bradley of the CBS News program ``60 Minutes,'' who
gave $500 to Wilder in his bid to become the nation's first elected
black governor.
   ``I look upon this as part of my life as a private citizen,''
said Bradley, who met Wilder at a fund-raiser in New York ``and
liked what he had to say.''
   Bradley said he has contributed to other candidates and, while
has had some concerns about the potential conflict in reporting the
news and giving money to political campaigns, ``the alternative is
to do nothing.''
   ``I don't advertise it, but I don't hide it,'' he said. ``It's a
delicate line you tread.''
   When it comes to drawing money from the famous, Wilder has more
names than Coleman. Most of the gifts are small, with the exception
of Cosby, who gave $100,000 to Wilder.
   But other well-known contributors to the Democrat's campaign
have given far less. They include singer Barbra Streisand, who gave
$1,000; former tennis star Arthur Ashe Jr., like Wilder a Richmond
native, who gave $3,000; and Charlayne Hunter Gault, of the
MacNeil-Lehrer Newshour on public broadcasting stations, who gave
$700.
   Coleman's most famous contributors are political celebrities
rather than entertainers or media stars.
   In addition to Regan, a top aide to former President Reagan, who
gave $10,000, they include President Bush's son, Marvin, who
contributed $1,000 to the GOP candidate's campaign.
   The two campaigns, meantime, also have backing from well-known
national corporations. A major tobacco industry player sided with
Coleman, while Wilder tapped some beer money.
   New York-based Philip Morris USA, which has a major cigarette
manufacturing plant in Richmond, put $15,000 into Coleman's war
chest.
   The Miller Brewing Co. of Milwaukee gave $250 to Wilder. Miller
has a brewery just across the Virginia line in Eden, N.C.
   Wilder also got $7,500 from the Southland Corp. of Dallas, whose
7-Eleven stores are known coast-to-coast.
   In at least one case, a corporate giver is playing it safe by
contributing to both camps. The Richmond-based CSX Corp., a
railroad holding company, has given about $30,000 each to Coleman
and Wilder.
   In all, Coleman has raised $8.2 million to $4.8 million for
Wilder.
   Adding the fund-raising of Coleman's GOP primary opponents and
Wilder's only opponent for the Democratic nomination, state Sen.
Daniel W. Bird Jr. of Wytheville, brings the total for the
governor's race to about $20 million.

   A congress of Latvian activists on
Saturday debated plans for independence from the Soviet Union
despite fears the Kremlin might impose an economic blockade in
retaliation.
   While red hammer-and-sickle flags fluttered over Riga for the
national holiday known as Soviet Constitution Day, the 1,074
delegates of the People's Front of Latvia considered a program that
denounced the Soviet system as ``feudal.'' The plan calls for a
free market economy based on private property and profit.
   ``The last half century has seen the rule of an absurd economic
system, the absence of human rights, and an administrative
arbitrariness, which has led Latvia to national, economic and
ecological catastrophes,'' the movement's draft plan said.
   The program is a 126-point list of goals aimed at building an
independent economy and social structure in Latvia before it would
secede from the Soviet Union.
   It calls for human rights, competing political parties, private
business, and an end to Communist Party domination.
   It also demands an end to discrimination against intellectuals,
abolition of privileges in the distribution of scarce apartments
and food, and restoration of Latvian geographical names.
   People's Front President Dainis Ivans said the program faces
strong opposition, especially from radicals who are registering
Latvians to vote for an alternative parliament that would quickly
declare independence.
   He said the delegates to the congress represent 300,000
supporters of the People's Front.
   The ``centrist'' draft program under debate Saturday sets no
date for independence and conforms in many ways to the reforms of
Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev.
   For example, Gorbachev has backed economic independence for the
Baltic states, which also include Estonia and Lithuania, to both
appease activists and advance reform of the Soviet economy.
   The program also avoids the popular street slogan in Riga, the
Latvian capital, that demands removal of the Soviet ``occupation''
army. Instead the Popular Front calls for the demilitarization of
Latvia.
   Ivans and other leaders spoke agains any abrupt declaration of
independence. ``We all know that no empire has given up its loot of
its free will,'' he said.
   If the Soviet Union should try to blockade Latvia economically
to pressure it back into the fold, Latvia could lose the majority
of its energy supplies, including all of its gasoline, economist
Arnmis Kalnins told the delegates. It could also forfeit 38 percent
of its consumer goods, he said.
   ``The political situation doesn't show Western countries would
be willing to give support at the risk of offending the Soviet
Union,'' he added.
   The congress, expected to end with a vote on the independence
platform Sunday evening, was businesslike in comparison with the
euphoria of the People's Front's first congress one year ago.
   At that time, 150,000 people jammed a park outside the Communist
Party's House of Political Education to weep in joy at the sound of
once-forbidden folk songs and at the sight of the flag of
once-independent Latvia.
   During the past year the Latvian Parliament has passed measures
claiming the right to veto Soviet laws, making Latvian the official
language and restoring minority schools.
   Estonia and Lithuania also have pressed for increased autonomy
during the past year.
   At last year's congress, however, the Latvian activists made
calls only for an ill-defined ``sovereignty'' rather than
independence from Moscow.
   On Saturday, Latvian President Anatoly Gorbunov, a close
associate of Gorbachev, told reporters he was not disturbed by the
new calls for independence because the proposal was offered in a
democratic manner.
   But he said he will oppose parts of the program concerning the
path to independence and local control.
   Speaking of Latvian independence, he said ``at the present time,
there are neither the social nor economic preconditions.''

   Consumers can save close to $150 a year by
using the most energy efficient appliances sold in the United
States, according to a independent non-profit energy research group.
   ``There are many factors that consumers need to look at in
purchasing appliances. Energy is one of them,'' said Steve Nadel,
senior associate at the American Council for an Energy-Efficient
Economy.
   Since ``one-third of the electricity produced in the U.S. is
consumed in our homes'' the council recommends consumers pay closer
attention to the yellow EnergyGuide labels affixed to new
appliances.
   ``We are suggesting that people narrow their searches,'' Nadel
said. The group's guide, ``The Most Energy-Efficient Appliances''
offers consumers help in doing that.
   ``If all the households in the U.S. had the most efficient
refrigerators currently available, the electricity savings would
eliminate the need for about 10 large power plants,'' the report
said.
   The makes and models surveyed by the council meet or exceed the
minimum efficiency standards established by the National Appliance
Energy Conservation Act of 1987, Nadel added.
   The law provides that minimum energy efficiency standards for
major home appliances be reduced by 10 percent to 30 percent and
phased in over five years.
   ``Using appliances and heating and cooling equipment costs an
average household more than $1000 per year,'' the report said.
   ``We estimate that these standards will save consumers at least
$28 billion over the lifetimes of the products sold through the
year 2000,'' the report concluded.
   The council study assumes ``electic water heating so in homes
with gas water heating, since gas is typically less expensive, the
savings would be lower,'' Nadel added.
   However Nadel estimated buying the council's most
energy-efficient refrigerator, dish and clothes washer could save
$146 a year.
   The average family refrigerator is 18.5 cubic feet refrigerators
with top freezers and automatic defrosters, Nadel said.
   The council report rates a Frigidaire 18.6 cubic feet model as
the most efficient in that size category. Based on a national
average energy cost of 7.7 cents per kilowatt hour the booklet
estimates the annual cost to run the Frigidaire refrigerator at $65
annually.
   The average refrigerator that consumers replace costs about $112
to operate yearly, said Nadel. He calculated that consumers would
save $47 a year with the Frigidaire model.
   For two other common household appliances, dish and clothes
washers, Nadel estimated yearly costs for existing models in most
homes at $70 and $90 respectively.
   The council rates a White-Westinghouse dishwasher which costs
$38 a year to operate and a Gibson front-loading standard size
washing machine costing $23 a year to run as the most
energy-efficient new models. The consumer buying these would save
$32 and $67 over current costs.
   The council examined less than 5 percent of the different models
available by July 1989 of refrigerators, freezers, dish and clothes
washers, tank and heat pump water heaters and room and central air
conditioners.
   The report said consumer savings might be increased further by
utility company rebates to users of high efficiency appliances.
   Consumers can obtain a copy of the council's guide for $3 by
writing ACEEE, Suite 535, 1001 Connecticut Ave., NW, Washington,
D.C. 20036.

   More than 700 workers struck the Hyatt

wages and fringe benefits, said union and hotel authorities.
   The two facilities ``are continuing to operate _ certainly no
problems,'' said Hyatt attorney Lisa Van Krieken.
   The strike took the hotels by surprise, she said, adding that a
negotiating session was set for Monday.
   Striking workers include dishwashers, cooks, janitors, waiters,
bartenders, maids, busboys and telephone operators.
   ``The Hyatts have refused even to discuss our bargaining
proposals,'' said Sherri Chiesa, president of Local 2 of the Hotel
and Restaurant Employees and Bartenders Union. The sides were ``far
apart on many issues,'' she said.
   The union office said more than 700 employees were involved in
the strike, which started at 6 a.m.
   The striking employees have been working without a contract
since Aug. 15. They voted Sept. 26 to authorize the union's
leadership to call a strike.

<TEXT>
   A historic Communist Party congress on
Saturday overwhelmingly approved scrapping the 70-year-old party
and replacing it with a socialist organization. It marked the first
time a Soviet-bloc Communist Party has dissolved itself.
   The resolution presented to the congress stated that the party's
``history ... has ended'' and named its successor the Hungarian
Socialist Party. The new party is to resemble the socialist parties
of West Europe, its founders said.
   Of the 1,202 delegates present, 1,005 voted for the motion.
There were 159 votes against and 38 abstentions.
   Reform Communists have for months urged the party to support
their plan to start anew as Hungary prepares for its first free
national elections in 41 years.
   The reformers have pointed to shrinking membership _ more than
70,000 party members have quit this year alone _ and a series of
by-election losses to newly permited opposition parties in arguing
that only a new, democratic-leftist party can compete successfully
at the polls.
   The party leadership's commitment to free elections by June at
the latest, along with the acceptance of international human rights
provisions, had put Hungary in the forefront of reform within the
Warsaw Pact alliance even before Saturday's vote.
   Only Poland, with the Soviet bloc's first government not
controlled by Communists, has come as far as Hungary in its
democratic strivings.
   The new party, which draws on socialist and communist ideals,
supports ``humanism, freedom and democracy,'' the document stated.
It seeks alliances with reform-oriented communist parties as well
as socialist and social democratic parties, according to the
resolution.
   Liberals grouped in the Reform Union faction had urged since the
congress opened Friday that the new party be free of Communist
Party conservatives. However, in a clear attempt to gain broad
support the position paper avoided direct mention of cleansing of
ranks.
   It instead ``called into its ranks all those who agree with its
platform, who accept the ground rules.'' But the document also
provided that members of the old party would not automatically be
members of the new one by proposing that new membership booklets be
issued by Nov. 10.
   Originally even more wide-ranging in its intention to split with
the past, the reform leadership watered down the document late
Saturday to gain the support of the Platform for Rural Equal
Opportunity _ less progressive than the Reform Union but more
liberal than the conservative groupings.
   Members of the two liberal factions debated passionately _
yelling could be heard from a conference hall at one point _ before
agreement was reached on the compromise document.
   The document declared the new party would support the concept of
both private and state property, calling for ``a mixed property
social market economy,'' and ``the development of ... a multiparty
parliamentary democracy.''
   Politburo member Janos Barabas told reporters the change would
not challenge Hungary's ties with more orthodox Communist Parties
in other Warsaw Pact countries ``with whom we are in an alliance
situation.''
   Communist Party chairman Rezsoe Nyers, a moderate reformer
appointed in an attempt to bridge ideological differences among the
four-member party leadership, praised the position paper as ``a
compromise serving the rebirth of our party as a new left-wing
Socialist Party.''
   In a surprise turn, Nyers disclosed that former Politburo member
Janos Berecz, one of the most bitter opponents of reform at the
congress, had asked whether there was room for him in the new party.
   ``I said `Yes, as a reform Communist,''' Nyers said to cheers
from some of the delegates.
   The strong approval of the document was a blow to conservatives
at the congress who had supported plans to make some changes in the
existing party but rejected founding a new one.
   Imre Pozsgay, the leading reformer in the four-man party
leadership, had told reporters earlier he was closer to social
democratic ideals than traditional communist ones. He said the
communist principles ``led to a dead end in Eastern Europe,
wherever they were tried.''
   He described Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's campaign
for restructuring and openness as an encouraging ``wind for our
reforms,'' but emphasized that Hungary's decisions were independent
of other countries.
   Pozsgay has been the party candidate for the newly created
government post of president in the planned elections.
   Premier Miklos Nemeth, also a reformer and member of the
collective party leadership, told the delegates that the new party
would have no room ``for those who have blood on their hands'' from
past Communist Party excesses.
   Another test of reform and conservative strength at the congress
was expected Sunday in voting on leadership posts.
   Reformers, with nearly 500 committed delegates, represent the
strongest faction at the congress, with staunch conservatives
numbering less than 100.
   But several reformers said the conservatives were continuing
efforts to win over hundreds of uncommitted delegates.

   An aviation disaster is turning into a
windfall for a northwest Iowa family.
   Glen Galvin, 17, has earned $6,700 in rewards in his search for
parts from a disintegrated engine from a jumbo jet that crashed
this summer.
   ``It's kind of like winning the lottery, only the odds are
better,'' said Galvin, a senior at Alta High School.
   The engine pieces are from a United Airlines DC-10 that was
headed to Chicago from Denver when its No. 2 engine broke apart on
July 19.
   As the shredded engine parts fell over northwest Iowa, they
severed hydraulic lines in the plane, crippling the flight
controls. Pilots were able to bring the disabled plane to the
airport at Sioux City where it crashed on landing.
   The crash claimed 112 lives, but 184 people survived.
   Most of the parts found so far appear to be engine fan blades or
pieces of blades, said Stephen Gadd, a lawyer representing General
Electric Co. The company made the CF6-6 tail engine that
disintegrated before the crash.
   Still missing is the 300-pound titanium disk that held the
blades. The company is offering $278,000 in rewards for the parts,
ranging from a $500 minimum to $50,000 for the disk, Gadd said.
   They are offering the rewards in hopes the parts will provide
clues to the cause of the crash.
   Galvin didn't begin looking for parts until the National Guard
completed its search of corn and soybean fields in the area.
   ``I found one of the first-stage (engine) pieces right away and
that pretty much started it,'' said Galvin. A search over the Labor
Day weekend turned up most of his ``first batch'' of parts, he
said. He found them in a pasture where he was riding his motor bike.
   The first group of five engine parts netted him $3,200 in
rewards.
   Jerome Clark, a representative of GE Aerospace Engines,
inspected the newer parts in Galvin's possession Thursday and said
several will net the teen-ager another reward in the amount of
$3,500.
   Galvin hasn't decided what he will do with his share of the
reward, but his mother, Illa Glavin, has some ideas.
   ``We figure 10 percent will go to the church and then we are
going to divide it among the family members,'' she said. ``I think
cars or maybe a computer; we look at it as a windfall.''

<HEAD>No Negotiations Scheduled in Boeing Strike</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SEATTLE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A federal mediator said he's ready to organize
new talks between the Boeing Co. and striking Machinists, but there
was no indication Saturday that negotiations would occur soon.
   Labor leaders planned a regional strategy session on Monday,
while striking workers took vacations or temporary jobs as the
strike moved through its fourth day.
   ``We're going to remain open and ready to do whatever we can to
settle the situation at the right time,'' Boeing spokesman Paul
Binder said Saturday. ``We have not at this point planned for any
meetings, scheduled any meetings or made any contact with (federal
mediator) Doug Hammond.''
   Both Boeing and the union say they are willing to negotiate, but
Hammond has declined to say who or what was holding things up.
   ``I have heard from the union, and they are interested in
returning to the table,'' Hammond said Friday, ``but nothing is
scheduled, and I don't foresee anything this weekend.''
   In a recorded message at his office Saturday, Hammond said, ``At
this time there are no meetings scheduled in the Boeing labor
dispute. If there is any change in this, an announcement will be
made.''
   Spokesmen for the Machinists were out of their offices Saturday
morning and not available for comment.
   The strike began Wednesday for 43,300 workers in the Seattle
area, 12,000 in Wichita, Kan., 1,700 in Portland, Ore., and others
at several locations nationwide.
   The machinists voted by 85 percent Tuesday to reject an offer
that included an immediate raise of 4 percent with 3 percent raises
in both 1990 and 1991, annual bonuses of 8 percent of a worker's
gross earnings this year and 3 percent the next plus a reduction in
mandatory overtime. The offer also included a cost-of-living
formula to account for virtually all inflation.
   Picket lines remained up and supervisory personnel continued to
fill in as they could on production lines, Binder said, although he
had no figures on how many people were working.

<TEXT>
   A leading Soviet general made an unprecedented
appearance Saturday before an assembly of NATO legislators, touting
the Kremlin's unilateral arms cuts and challenging the West to act
on disarmament.
   ``This is a great honor for me, the Warsaw pact and the Soviet
military. This is a historic moment. I am here, even in uniform,
representing the Warsaw Pact,'' said Gen. Vladimir Lobov, the first
deputy chief of staff of the Soviet General Staff.
   Lobov, along with NATO supreme commander Gen. John Galvin, spoke
to the Defense and Security Committee of the North Atlantic
Assembly, a consultative group of legislators from member nations
of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization.
   ``The Soviet Union and the Warsaw Pact are no longer a threat to
NATO, to the NATO states and certainly not to the United States,''
said Lobov, who is also a member of the Soviet legislature.
   He said the Soviet Union has decided unilaterally to reduce its
forces by 500,000 troops, 10,000 tanks and 8,500 warplanes. He said
the Soviets will withdraw three armored divisions from East Germany
and remove 500 nuclear warheads from the territories of its Warsaw
Pact allies by the end of the year.
   ``What are you doing?'' Lobov asked the legislators. ``We are
not just talking about things, we are doing them. And of course, we
are expecting something from you.''
   Galvin said that despite the reductions, ``the Soviet Union
remains the most powerful military force in the world. ... They
will have to reduce a long way before things are brought into
balance.
   ``It is the conventional imbalance that poses the greatest
threat to security in Europe,'' he added.
   The NATO commander suggested the Soviets should take several
steps at conventional arms reductions talks in Vienna to raise
Western confidence.
   Galvin said the Soviets should agree to remove their
quick-strike capability by cuts in first-echelon forces in Eastern
Europe; dismantle supply depots in forward areas; remove
operational maneuver groups and high-readiness forces from forward
areas; slow conventional arms production; agree to verification
procedures; and sign a pact to make the measures binding.
   ``Intentions can change,'' Galvin cautioned.

   President Carlos Menem on
Saturday pardoned more than 200 military officers accused of human
rights abuses and aiding military rebellions, saying the move was
essential for national reconciliation.
   The pardons also cover several dozen suspected leftist
guerrillas.
   ``I know there will be those who are unhappy ... but I'm also
convinced that millions of Argentines are applauding this
measure,'' Menem said in brief comments from his home in La Rioja
Province, 745 miles northwest of Buenos Aires.
   Included in the pardons were Leopoldo Galtieri, a former
president and army commander, and 38 other officers who faced trial
in connection with the arrests, disappearances and presumed
killings of nearly 9,000 suspected subversives during the so-called
``dirty war'' of the 1976-83 military dictatorships.
   Also pardoned were Lt. Col. Aldo Rico and Col. Mohamed Ali
Seineldin, the leaders of military uprisings in April 1987 and
January and December 1988 that threatened the elected government of
then President Raul Alfonsin.
   In all, 39 officers charged with human rights abuses and 164
officers accused in connection with the uprisings were free to
leave prison, Menem said. The pardons also applied to three
officers convicted of mishandling the 1982 Falklands War with
Britain _ former navy chief Jorge Anaya; former air force chief
Basilio Lami Dozo, and Galtieri, who faced the separate human
rights charges dating from his days as a military commander before
he became president in 1981.
   Menem and his Peronist Party said the pardons were the best way
to end the rancor that divides this South America nation of 32
million people.
   Alfonsin, elected in October 1983 to end military rule and voted
out of office last May, was wedged between the military, which
opposed trials, and human rights advocates who insisted they be
held.
   The military claimed the accused officers used unconventional
tactics against an unconventinal enemy _ guerrillas whose bombings
and assassinations led to the March 1976 coup against President
Isabel Peron.
   Human rights groups claim the official list of 8,960 people who
``disappeared'' is only about a third of the actual total.
   ``Justice should have been allowed to operate,'' Enrique Pochat,
coordinator of the General Ecumenical Movement for Human Rights,
said of the pardons.
   Rene de Epelbaum, a leader of the Mothers of the Plaza de Mayo
human rights group, said the pardons ``mock justice.''
   ``It is a true moral aberration that leaves in liberty those who
violated human dignity and those who rose up against the
constitutional order,'' the activist said.
   The opposition Radical Civic Union, Argentina's second-largest
party, also criticized the presidential pardons.
   ``One of the things that is necessary to consolidate democracy
is justice, and impunity should not be sanctified,'' said national
Deputy Leopoldo Moreau.
   Menem, who took office on July 8 in the midst of an economic
crisis involving triple-digit monthly inflation, had as little room
to maneuver as Alfonsin.
   More than 100,000 protesters joined a rally sponsored last month
by human rights groups to urge Menem to reconsider the pardons he
had hinted for months he would grant.
   The groups also launched a petition drive to collect 1 million
signatures to oppose pardons.
   However, Menem, a provincial governor at the time of the 1976
military coup and then a political prisoner for nearly five years,
seemed to favor the military argument from the day he took office.
   With the econony in such bad shape, he said, the country could
not tolerate such bitter social divisions.
   Former presidents and generals Jorge Videla and Roberto Viola,
who were convicted in December 1985 of murder, kidnapping and
torture during the ``dirty war,'' remained in prison. They could be
pardoned at a later time.
   Also remaining in jail on human rights charges were former
Buenos Aires Province Police Gen. Ramon Camps, who was convicted
and sentenced to 30 years in jail, and former Gen. Carlos Guillermo
Suarez Mason, who was extradited from the United States in May 1988
and faces trial on charges of homicide.
   The pardons also excluded one of the most notorious of the
leftist guerrillas and the only one now in jail. Mario Firmenich,
co-founder of the Montonero terrorist group, was convicted of
murder and sentenced to 30 years in jail.

<TEXT>
   Voters stood in long lines under
pouring rain Saturday to vote for a new Parliament for Botswana,
one of the few African nations with regular, multiparty elections.
   The conservative Botswana Democratic Party was expected to
retain its comfortable majority. It has governed this diamond-rich
country since independence from Britain 23 years ago and supervised
a capitalist economy that has made Botswana one of Africa's most
prosperous states.
   Eight political parties contested the elections. The polls
closed at 7 p.m. but final results were not expected until Sunday.
   There were no reports of turnout. About 360,000 people over the
age of 21 were eligible to vote.
   It was the sixth general election in this landlocked country in
southern Africa country since independence in 1966.
   The Democratic Party, now led by President Quett Masire, has won
all the elections. It held 28 of the 34 seats in the former
Parliament.
   The socialist Botswana National Front held five seats and
controls the city council in Gaborone, the capital of this nation
of 1.2 million people.
   The Botswana People's Party had one parliamentary seat, which it
was expected to lose. The other five parties were not expected to
win any seats.
   Masire's party was expected to maintain its advantage because of
Botswana's booming economy, which has grown at least 10 percent
annually through the 1980s.
   Diamonds from the Kalahari Desert, along with cattle ranching,
provide most of the wealth.
   When Botswana gained independence it was among the world's 20
poorest nations with a per capita annual income of less than $100.
Today the average yearly income is more than $1,000, one of the
highest in Africa.
   On a continent crippled by foreign debt, Botwana's government
has spent cautiously. The country has foreign reserves in excess of
$2 billion.
   Masire, who has been president since 1980, has avoided large,
expensive public works projects and his administration concentrated
on small-scale development.
   In foreign affairs, his government has been critical of South
Africa's policies of racial discrimination, but it has kept close
business ties with its powerful southern neighbor.
   Botswana's army has never fought a battle, even though the
country is surrounded by such tumultuous lands as South Africa,
Namibia, Angola and Mozambique.
   The Botswana National Front has said it can win seats in larger
towns where jobs and houses are in short supply. The front also
claims Botswana's wealth has not reached ordinary workers and
declaried it would establish more social welfare programs.

<HEAD>Administration in Closed-Door Talks Seeking Cut in Capital Gains
Tax</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Top aides to President Bush met with Senate
leaders behind closed doors Saturday in an effort to devise a
strategy for winning a cut in capital gains taxes without delaying
critical deficit-reduction legislation.
   Democratic leaders, who oppose the capital gains legislation,
were looking for a way to pass the deficit-reduction bill without
the tax cut.
   Senate Majority Leader George J. Mitchell, D-Maine, announced
that seven hours of meetings had produced no agreement.
Nevertheless, he said, he and Republican Leader Bob Dole of Kansas
``believe that the prospects for such an agreement are sufficiently
encouraging to commit that we will continue our meetings.''
   The next round of negotiations was scheduled Sunday morning.
   The central question is whether Republicans will be able to add
a capital gains cut to the bill by a simple majority vote _ 51 at
most _ or whether they will have to get 60 votes because of rules
that govern consideration of the deficit bill.
   The House bill already includes a capital gains cut.
   Each side set the groundwork for blaming the other if the
negotiations fail. Failure could mean further delay in passage of a
catchall package of deficit reduction _ known as reconciliation _
and lead to automatic, across-the-board cuts in federal spending on
Oct. 16.
   Mitchell told reporters the White House is closely involved in
the discussions. ``Our primary objective is ... a meaningful
deficit-reduction package,'' he said. ``The difference we have in
this discussion is that the primary objective of the administration
is a capital-gains tax cut.''
   Dole said of the Democrats: ``They've got a problem. They are
going to be blamed for ... (the automatic budget cuts) and they've
got to get out of it.''
   Mitchell met with Sen. Lloyd Bentsen, D-Texas, chairman of the
Finance Committee, and Sen. James Sasser, D-Tenn., chairman of the
Budget Committee. House Speaker Thomas S. Foley, D-Wash., attended
briefly.
   Trying to develop GOP strategy with Dole were Sens. Pete
Domenici of New Mexico and Bob Packwood of Oregon, senior
Republicans on, respectively, the Budget and Finance committees.
   Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady and White House budget
director Richard G. Darman led the administration effort.
   The stated purpose of the meetings is to find a way to strip
from the deficit-reduction bill _ a package of revenue increases
and spending cuts _ that are not directly related to reducing the
deficit. The measure has become so weighted down with extraneous
pet projects that there is little likelihood that Congress can
enact it before the Oct. 16 deadline.
   The chief controversy is over Bush's proposal to cut taxes on
capital gains. The measure is part of the House version of the bill
and Republicans want to add it to the Senate version.
   Democratic leaders in the Senate are countering with an
amendment to eliminate the capital gains cut and substitute an
expansion of tax-deductible Individual Retirement Accounts.
   Republicans insist that if every extraneous item is stripped
from the bill _ and they don't concede that capital gains is
extraneous _ they be assured a separate vote on capital gains. That
would leave them an easier path to passage with just a simple
majority.
   But Mitchell was emphatic that Democrats, who control the
Senate, will not waive any Senate rules to make it easier for
Republicans to duplicate the capital gains victory they took in the
House. ``That will not happen,'' he said.

   President Virgilio Barco's government
was trying to negotiate a truce with drug traffickers until a
presidential candidate was assassinated in August, a newspaper said
Saturday.
   However, the president's secretary general, German Montoya,
denied he had talked to drug traffickers and said the Barco
administration had never wavered in its commitment to fight the
drug cartels.
   He made the comments after the Bogata daily, La Prensa, said a
former ambassador to the United Nations had delivered messages
between Montoya and the drug dealers. It said Montoya had acted on
direct orders from the president in the negotiations.
   In four years leading up to the purported negotiations, drug
traffickers killed a justice minister, an attorney general, a
newspaper publisher and scores of other people.
   Barco's administration began an unprecedented crackdown on the
nation's drug cartels after Sen. Luis Carlos Galan, a presidential
candidate, was killed while addressing a campaign rally on Aug. 18.
   Two of La Prensa's main owners are Misael Pastrana and Belesario
Betancur, both former presidents and members of the opposition
Conservative Party. Barco is a member of the Liberal Party.
   La Prensa said it had documents from Sen. Alvaro Leyva Duran,
also of the Conservative Party, showing that Montoya wanted talks
to be held between the drug traffickers on one side and the
Colombian government and the United States on the other.
   The drug lords reportedly were prepared to contract former U.S.
Secretary of State Henry Kissenger's Washington-based lobbying firm
to persuade the United States government to begin a dialogue,
according to the newspaper.
   La Prensa said U.S. participation never developed because of
strong opposition first by the Reagan administration and then the
Bush administration.
   In his sharply worded denial Montoya said, ``The decision of the
government was and is to make sure that all the law's weight falls
on those common criminals and terrorists.''
   His statement called the La Prensa report ``calumnious'' and
said it showed the paper's ``lack of solidarity with the national
crusade against drug traffickers that is led by the government and
supported by the world.''
   He acknowledged meeting with a former U.N. ambassador and
interior minister, Joaquin Vallejo, but he said he did so on his
own authority and told him there could be no talks with drug
traffickers.
   According to La Prensa, Vallejo carried messages from the
Medellin drug cartel starting in September 1988 and up until five
days after the assassination of Galan, the leading candidate for
the Liberal Party's nomination for presidential elections in March.
   Authorities blamed drug traffickers for the murder.
   At a meeting on Aug. 23, three days after Galan's burial,
Montoya told Vallejo that negotiations with traffickers were no
longer possible because the government had decided to declare
``total war,'' La Prensa said.
   Barco began his declared war against traffickers on Aug. 19,
saying he would extradite traffickers wanted in the United States.
   The traffickers responded with a terrorist bombing campaign,
which officials say is aimed at forcing the government into new
talks.
   The Barco administration has said repeatedly since Galan's death
that it will never agree to talks with drug lords responsible for
slaying scores of the country's political leaders, police and army
officials, and judges.
   La Prensa said the main document among the messages is a memo in
Vallejo's handwriting that summarizes proposals from Group A,
identified as the Medellin cartel. La Prensa published a photograph
of the piece of paper.
   According to the copy, the cartel was ready to abandon the
cocaine processing business, turn over its arms, laboratories and
airstrips and help the government fight other drug traffickers. In
return, the traffickers asked for amnesty and guarantees not to be
extradited.
   The three alleged chiefs of the cartel, Jorge Luis Ochoa, Pablo
Escobar and Gonzalo Rodriguez Gacha, are among the 12 Colombian
traffickers most wanted for extradition to the United States.
   The Colombian government has offered a $250,000 reward for
information leading to the capture of Escobar and Rodriguez.
   U.S. officials say the Medellin cartel and a rival trafficking
group based in the southern city of Cali are responsible for
processing 80 percent of the cocaine sold on U.S. streets.

   A single-engine airplane plowed into a
pine tree and exploded shortly after taking off in heavy fog from
an east Texas airstrip, killing all five people aboard, officials
said.
   The five men were headed to Destin, Fla., on vacation Friday
night, said Lt. Frank Garrett of the Harrison County Sheriff's
Department.
   Samuel F. Vaughn III, president of Marshall-based Winchester
Oil, owned the airplane and airstrip and was taking friends to
Florida to go fishing, officials said.
   The cause of the crash was not immediately known, Garrett said.
But he said the pilot of the six-seater Cessna-208 turboprop,
Steven Engelbrecht, may not have realized how low to the ground he
was, due to the heavy fog.
   ``The visibility was about 50 to 60 feet,'' Garrett said. ``It
appears the pilot took off and began his left turn too soon because
the airplane crashed in some trees about 150 feet from the runway.''
   Federal Aviation Administration officials were investigating the
accident on Saturday, Garrett said.
   The other victims were identified as Chase Staggers, 29; Johnny
Johnson, 29; and David Perkins, 28, all of Marshall.
   Uncertain is about 20 miles northeast of Marshall, near the
Louisiana border.

   Occupants of Beverly Hills mansions and
skid-row shelters marched hand-in-hand Saturday in the largest
demonstration for decent and fair housing since the civil rights
crusade of the 1960s.
   The mile-long march along Constitution Avenue, from the
Washington Monument to a rally site just short of the Capitol,
crowned a three-day ``Housing Now!'' campaign, sponsored by more
than 200 organizations, on behalf of the homeless as well as all
Americans yearning for more affordable homes.
   Washington Mayor Marion Barry, himself a cosponsor of the
parade, claimed 250,000 people in the throng which filled the
entire line of progression and spilled into adjacent areas of the
national Mall.
   U.S. Park Police characterized that figure as too high, but
their own estimate, 40,000, was not compiled until late in the
afternoon, after many people had drifted away from more than five
hours of speechmaking and entertainment. D.C. Metropolitan Police
spokesman Abraham Parks, by contrast, said his department counted
between 70,000 and 75,000 at the same hour, near the end of the
program.
   Ohio Gov. Richard Celeste, a Democrat, lauded the commitment of
past Republican presidents to fair and decent housing, but
declared: ``I'm angry because Ronald Reagan betrayed that legacy.''
As the crowd cheered, Celeste added: ``The federal government
found, in one week, $1 billion for the poor souls made homeless by
Hurricane Hugo. We need billions for the poor souls made homeless
by Hurricane Ronnie.''
   Celeste said there were 10,000 marchers from Ohio alone, while
15 times that many were in dire need of housing in his state.
   The program culminated a political siege that had been months in
the making, and ended with the rousing oratory of the Rev. Jesse
Jackson and the music of Stevie Wonder.
   Jackson said, ``We are taught that the homeless are derelicts,
crazy people who have chosen self-destruction. My brothers and
sisters, this is America, the richest nation in the world. No one
should go homeless. Their condition is not a measure of their
worth, it's a measure of our worth.''
   Jackson noted reports that Reagan is getting $2 million to
deliver two speeches in Japan. ``He can tell them how he disgraced
our nation with radical disregard for the poor. Why are there 3
million homeless? They cut the Housing Department budget by 75
percent and they stole the other 25 percent,'' he said.
   As for Bush, Jackson said: ``He wants to put more money in the
hands of the rich so they can have a beach house, and the poor can
have no house. That's why we march today.''
   Most of the participants shared the celebratory mood, dancing
and singing as they paraded past the capital's landmarks, though
many were from the destitute ranks of the ``street people''
inhabiting heating grates, cardboard boxes and abandoned cars.
Bolstering their spirits were some early commitments, mostly
symbolic, from both Congress and the Bush administration as a
consequence of their lobbying blitz on Thursday and Friday.
   Despite conflicting crowd estimates, the demonstration clearly
was the largest on the housing issue since Ronald Reagan stemmed
the government's ill-fated plunge into the construction of
low-income housing projects, many of which have turned into
high-rise slums. Few now argue for a repetition of that effort; the
debate, rather, centers on ways to help the destitute and
low-income families integrate themselves into mainstream
neighborhoods.
   Saturday's demonstration rivaled some of the huge turnouts for
the civil rights demonstrations in the 1960s, for which the issue
of fair housing was but one component. The event was backed by the
AFL-CIO, U.S. Conference of Mayors, YMCA and YWCA, National Urban
League, Catholic Charities USA, the Southern Christian Leadership
Conference and the National Organization for Women, among others.
   The Rev. Joseph Lowery, head of the SCLC, referred repeatedly to
President Bush's promise of a ``kinder and gentler'' nation, and
declared: ``It is not kindness to have women and children comprise
most of the homeless. Winter is coming and the soul of our nation
is in peril.
   ``It is not kind and gentle to spend $200 billion on the savings
and loan bailout,'' he added. ``If this is the home of the brave,
why the hell are so many of our brave homeless?''
   Coretta Scott King, widow of Martin Luther King Jr., said ``We
did not come all this way just to let off steam. We will not rest
until every American has a decent job and home and a living wage.
Let the word go out ... we shall be heard and we shall overcome.''

   Most Americans think Gen. Manuel Noriega should
give up power in Panama yet a majority oppose the use of U.S.
military forces to overthrow him, according to a Newsweek poll
released Saturday.
   The poll found that 45 percent of Americans approve of the
degree of U.S. involvement in Tuesday's attempted coup against
Noriega. And nearly three in four expressed a ``fair amount'' or a
``great deal'' of confidence in President Bush's ability to handle
the current situation in Panama as effectively as possible.
   But 30 percent of those polled said the U.S. did not play enough
of a role in the reported coup.
   The poll indicated that Americans strongly support persuading
Panama's neighboring nations to pressure Noriega to surrender
power, with 76 percent of respondents favoring this approach. It
was the most popular of four options for U.S. policy toward Panama
offered by the poll.
   More than half supported imposing a total U.S. economic boycott
on Panama and 46 percent favored setting up a secret operation to
unseat Noriega. Only 26 percent favored use of U.S. military forces
to invade Panama and overthrow Noriega.
   The Gallup Organization interviewed a national sample of 750
adults by telephone on Oct. 5 and 6 for this poll. The margin of
error is plus or minus 4 percent.

   Polisario rebels in the disputed Western
Sahara attacked a Moroccan defense line Saturday, setting off the
bloodiest battle since the two sides declared a truce in February.
   The government said 14 of its soldiers were killed and 80 rebels
killed or wounded.
   A Polisario statement, which described the battle as ``murderous
violence,'' said the fighting broke out at dawn and lasted four
hours.
   The statement, issued in Algeria, Algiers, claimed its fighters
breached nine miles of Morocco's defensive front and pushed
government forces back 15 miles.
   The rebels did not say how the battle ended or give casualty
figures. It said ``numerous'' government soldiers forces were
killed, wounded or taken prisoner.
   The government reported that in addition to the 14 soldiers
killed 31 troopers were wounded. It also said four rebels were
taken prisoner.
   It claimed its forces repelled the attack launched south of the
town of Guelta Zemmour from Mauritanian territory.
   The government said its troops captured 10 jeeps armed with
missile launchers and anti-tank rockets, and 12 Polisario vehicles
were destroyed by Moroccan air attacks.
   The Western Sahara has been claimed by Morocco since Spain left
the territory in 1975, but the Polisario has proclaimed it an
independent state.
   U.N. Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar has proposed a
plan to hold a referendum in the mineral-rich region.
   The Polisasrio guerrilla movement, once actively supported by
Algeria, has fought a mainly losing battle against about 100,000
Moroccan troops in the area.
   The Sahara front had been quiet, except for isolated Polisario
attacks, since the guerrillas declared a ``temporary truce'' in
February following King Hassan II's meeting with Polisario leaders
in Marrakech.
   Similar meetings had been scheduled but were canceled by the
king, who called them ``pointless.''

   The Senate on Saturday confirmed Melvin
Sembler to be ambassador to Australia and Della Newman to be
ambassador to New Zealand, accepting two of President Bush's
nominees despite criticism over their political connections.
   The Senate confirmed them on a voice vote, with Sen. Paul
Sarbanes, D-Md., a critic of the quality of Bush's ambassadorial
appointments, saying he continued to oppose the Sembler and Newman
nominations.
   Sarbanes had complained earlier this year that Bush was handing
numerous ambassadorships to people who were unqualified for the
posts but well-connected politically.
   Sembler, a Florida shopping center tycoon, donated $127,000 to
Bush's 1988 presidential campaign, Sarbanes said earlier this year
in opposing his nomination.
   Newman, a real estate broker from Seattle, Wash., was chairman
of Bush's Washington state campaign and is a longtime friend of the
Bush family.

   The sweet smell of success soured in this
northeast Ohio town, where a 12-year-old girl won the regional
finals in the International Rotten Sneaker Contest on Saturday.
   Melissa Bergdorf, a seventh grader, was the winner _ if that's
the word for it _ with a pair of high-top tennis shoes twice
rescued from the trash can.
   ``They just keep coming back,'' said her mother, Delmarie
Carbaugh, from the Akron suburb of Uniontown.
   Melissa's shoes, without toes and with melted soles, were nearly
done in on camping trips, Mrs. Carbaugh said.
   ``There's not much left. ... The bottom is melted from walking
on hot bricks and the toes are totally gone,'' she said.
   Melissa will be sent to Montpelier, Vt., for the international
contest in March. Her mother, who was awarded the Purple Sole _ an
Odor-Eater shoe insert on a purple silk ribbon _ plans to accompany
her.
   The contest's 17 participants ranging in age from 8 to 16 had to
first prove the foul footwear was their own by skipping in place
and jumping rope.
   The shoes' tattered, shabby appearance were factors, but key to
victory was their smell, said David Hazlett, operations manager for
Eastwood Drug store, where the contest was held. The five judges
were a mother, a pharmacist and a coach; a sales manager from
national sponsor and manufacturer of Odor-Eaters, Combe Inc. of
White Plains, N.Y.; and a dog named Frankie.

<TEXT>
   A woman who took more than
$242,000 from a church-sponsored credit union gave all the cash to
the poor, her lawyer said.
   Vergie Encalade, former manager of the St. Thomas Parish Federal
Credit Union, is facing a federal indictment that accuses her of
siphoning off the money from October 1984 to August 1989.
   ``It's sort of hard for even her to explain,'' her lawyer,
William Quigley, said Friday. ``All the money was given to needy
people and institutions, from starving children in Ethiopia to the
Little Sisters of the Poor.''
   ``There's no evidence she or her family benefited from one cent
of that money,'' Quigley said. ``She's going to accept the
responsibility for what happened and take whatever punishment the
court feels appropriate.''
   A spokesman for the Louisiana Credit Union League said the
accounts of all 350 members are covered by insurance.
   If convicted, Encalade faces up to five years in prison, said
First Assistant U.S. Attorney Al Winters. Encalade is to turn
herself in next week to be arraigned, he said.
   Encalade is known in Plaquemines Parish as an outspoken,
sometimes strident activist who has had a number of run-ins with
public officials in her fight for equal rights and employment
opportunities for blacks.
   In 1986, Encalade and her husband, Justice of the Peace
Frederick Encalade, were convicted of disturbing the peace after
leading 30 people into a Plaquemines Parish Council meeting. The
group disrupted the meeting after the council refused to discuss
setting up a task force on unemployment.
   Quigley said Encalade managed to escape detection during a
number of federal audits. He said she ultimately went to
authorities and confessed.

   Biophysicist Alexander Mauro, a Rockefeller
University professor who helped develop the radio frequency cardiac
pacemaker, has died of cancer. He was 68.
   Mauro died Friday, said institute spokesman Robert Brown.
   The New Haven, Conn., native stayed in his hometown to receive a
bachelor's degree from Yale University in 1942 and his doctorate in
biophysics in 1950. He joined the faculty of the Yale School of
Medicine in 1951, starting a collaboration with cardiac surgeon
William W.L. Glenn.
   In 1958, the pair's work led to development of the radio
frequency cardiac pacemaker, which was designed for patients with
Stokes-Adams disease _ a condition marked by a slow, irregular
pulse.
   A year later Mauro left Yale to become a biophysics professor at
The Rockefeller University, where he specialized in work on cell
membranes. He wrote or co-authored almost 100 scholarly
publications in his career.
   He was survived by his wife, Jean Gilpatrick.

   Rebels launched five attacks against
government troops in rural provinces, killing four soldiers and
wounding eight, the Defense Ministry said Saturday.
   It said the attacks occurred Friday in provinces north and east
of Managua. The statement did not mention rebel casualties.
   Rebels, known as Contras, killed six government soldiers in an
early morning attack Wednesday on a rural military outpost.
   Five Central American presidents signed an agreement in August
designed to end the war and repatriate the Contras, most of whom
are in bases in Honduras near the Nicaraguan border. In return the
Sandinista government promised to hold fair elections.
   Some Contras have returned to Nicaragua, saying they plan to
participate in the elections set for February, but others rejected
the peace plan and said they will continue fighting.
   Observers from the Organization of American States have limited
their movements because of the clashes. There are 52 OAS observers
in Nicaragua to oversee compliance with the peace accords.
   The Contras have been fighting the left-wing Sandinistas since
1981. They claim the Sandinistas' shift to the far left betrayed
the revolution that ousted conservative President Anastasio Somoza
in 1979, ending 42 years of rule by the Somoza family.

<HEAD>Karpov Draws With Yusupov to Maintain Lead; Speelman, Timman Adjourn</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID GOODMAN</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Anatoly Karpov agreed to a 43-move draw with
fellow Soviet Artur Yusupov in the fourth round of the World Chess
Championshiop Candidates' semifinal on Saturday and moved into a
2.5-1.5 lead.
   In the other semifinal, Jon Speelman of England and Jan Timman
of the Netherlands ajourned after a grueling six-hour round.
   Speelman, playing white, sealed his 64th move in a well-known
endgame position with few pieces, which experts said is likely to
end in a draw.
   But Speelman maintains the material advantage of a bishop for a
pawn and he has the option to test Timman's defensive technique
over several playing sessions.
   ``Speelman should keep playing. This is the first game where
he's in the ascendancy,'' said Andrew Martin, a British
international master.
   After three games, Timman leads 2-1.
   The winner of the Candidates' cycle will challenge world
champion Garri Kasparov for his title in a 24-game contest
beginning October 1990. The winners of the eight-game semifinals
will face off in the Candidates final next March.
   A win scores a point and a draw a half.
   Playing with the advantage of white, Karpov's cautious play
enabled Yusupov to equalize shortly after the opening and even gain
a small edge in the resulting endgame.
   With only three minutes' thinking time left for 12 moves, Karpov
defended easily and when he launched a brief counterattack, Yusupov
forced a draw on the 43rd move.
   Although Karpov retains his lead in the contest, many experts
have been surprised by lackluster performance in the first half of
the contest.
   ``Karpov played very insipidly,'' said British International
Master David Norwood.
   Karpov, 38, held the world title for 10 years until he lost to
Kasparov in 1985 and he was widely expected to wipe out Yusupov in
the match.
   Yusupov held dangerous initiatives in the second and third
games, but a horrendous blunder in the third let Karpov seize the
lead.
   ``I feel sorry for Yusupov. He's playing like a hero, but he's
behind in the match.'' said Jonathan Tisdall, an international
master who is Speelman's chief second.
   The closely contested encounter between Speelman and Timman
featured a complicated struggle with the advantage switching
throughout the game.
   In the adjourned position, Speelman has a rook and a bishop, and
Timman a rook and pawn.
   If either match ends in a 4-4 tie, two further games will be
played, followed if necessary by sudden death tiebreakers at
increasingly high speeds.
   The fifth round is scheduled for Sunday with the sixth on
Tuesday. Play in the adjourned game is scheduled to resume Monday,
even though that means the fourth will not be completed until after
the fifth is played.
   Each player is allowed to take one timeout and postpone a game
until the next scheduled session. The four protagonists have
preferred to reserve this option for the second half of their duels.

<HEAD>Premier Resigns To Pave Way For Elections; Papandreou Accepts Mandate</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PHILIP DOPOULOS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>ATHENS, Greece (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Conservative Premier Tzannis Tzannetakis
resigned Saturday, saying his government's mission of starting a
cleanup of Greece's politics was fulfilled. Elections are expected
to be held for next month.
   Former socialist Premier Andreas Papandreou, whose
scandal-plagued government was replaced three months ago by
Tzannetakis' administration, said he accepted a presidential
mandate to try to form a Cabinet within three days.
   Tzannetakis said President Christos Sartzetakis accepted his
resignation but he agreed to stay on as caretaker until a new
Cabinet is appointed.
   He told reporters that during his 45-minute meeting with
Sartzetakis at the presidential palace he explained that his
right-left coalition government completed its task of launching
legal action against officials of the former socialist
administration.
   Within two hours Sartzetakis called in conservative New
Democracy Party leader Constantine Mitsotakis to ask him to attempt
to form a government. But the 71-year-old politician, confident of
victory at the polls, rejected the mandate and recommended that
procedures be hastened for the formation of a government to conduct
elections on Nov. 5.
   He was followed by Papandreou, whose Panhellenic Socialist
Movement (PASOK) lost the June 18 elections after eight years in
office.
   Papandreou told reporters as he left the palace that he had
accepted the presidential mandate. But it appeared highly unlikely
he could put together an administration by Monday that would win
Parliament's confidence.
   Mitsotakis said earlier that ``it would lack seriousness for
Papandreou to take the mandate and move around like a beggar since
he knows one way or another that he has no margins to achieve any
political result.''
   Papandreou said Mitsotakis' comment ``insulted the democratic
institutions and the country's political life.''
   If all attempts to form another government fails, Sartzetakis
then appoints a caretaker regime to take the country to elections.
   In the June election, New Democracy won 145 seats in the
300-member unicameral parliament. PASOK took 125 places while the
Coalition of the Left and Progress copped 28 seats. Two remaining
seats went to independents.
   New Democracy had joined in an unprecedented alliance with the
Communist-dominated Coalition of the Left and Progress to keep
Papandreou from retaining power and punish corrupt PASOK officials.
   Parliament has twice remanded the 70-year-old Papandreou in the
past three weeks to special courts where he will be tried for his
alleged involvement in a multimillion dollar bank scandal and for
allegedly instigating illegal wiretapping of his political friends
and foes while he was in office.

   Gay rights activists stormed a hotel on
Saturday to protest a conservative church group symposium where
speakers warned that homosexuals are a threat to American culture.
   About 35 activists chanted and blew whistles as they entered the
lobby of the Pan Pacific Hotel. The protest occured about a half
hour before the day's keynote speech was set to be delivered.
   The speech by William B. Allen, chairman of the U.S. Commission
on Civil Rights, was titled ``Blacks, Animals, and Homosexuals:
What is a Minority?''
   The protesters sat on the floor for less than an hour before
police wearing leather or surgical gloves led them away. No
immediate arrests were made.
   The sit-in was part of a larger demonstration at the hotel
against the West Coast Symposium on Homosexuality and Public Policy
Implications, held by the California Coalition for Traditional
Values, a church-formed organization.
   The approximate 200 demonstrators outnumbered the estimated 150
people attending the event.
   Allen's speech was delayed nearly four hours from its scheduled
noon delivery time. A conference organizer said his plane was
delayed in Monterey.
   On Friday, the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights, with Allen
dissenting, branded the title of the speech ``thoughtless,
disgusting and unnecessarily inflammatory.''
   Allen told reporters after his speech that the title was ``as
innocent as can be,'' and blasted his colleagues for not reading
the prepared remarks.
   Allen won a standing ovation for the speech in which he opposed
anti-discrimination laws for specific ethnic or minority groups.
   ``Historically, that process has always led to heightened
tensions and heightened antagonisms among the groups competing for
the rewards of the society,'' he said.
   Such demands by blacks in the civil rights era spawned a similar
movement for animals, argued Allen, who is black.
   ``Express laws for minority groups ... is the beginning of the
evil of reducing American blacks to an equality with animals, and
then seducing other groups (including homosexuals) to seek the same
charitable treatment,'' he said.
   ``Basically, what is going on in here is gay-bashing,'' said
Kevin Farrell, of the Orange County Visibility League, a homosexual
rights group with about 300 members.
   ``What's dangerous here is the thin veneer of respectability,''
Farrell said outside the hotel in this Orange County city, 25 miles
southeast of downtown Los Angeles.

   An 11-year-old girl prepared Saturday for
a trip that she hoped would include a visit with her pen pal, Gen.
Manuel Antonio Noriega of Panama.
   Sarah York and her mother first visited Noriega last year at the
general's invitation after the general and the youngster struck up
a friendship through the mail.
   ``The only things that are left are the suitcases and I'm
getting those ready now,'' Pauline York said Saturday, on the eve
of her daughter's and husband's trip to the troubled Central
American nation. They're due back to Negaunee, on Michigan's Upper
Peninsula, on Oct. 17.
   Mrs. York said no meeting was scheduled for this trip with
Noriega, who put down a coup attempt Tuesday.
   ``Our friends there have reassured us that everything in Panama
is OK now,'' she said. ``They would have told her if it was a bad
time for them to come.''
   Sarah first wrote Noriega in March 1988, after seeing him on
television, saying she wanted to learn more about his country.
After a correspondence, Noriega paid for Sarah to visit on a
five-day trip. This second trip, however, was paid for by the York
family.

   In East Berlin late Saturday about 300 troopers moved in to
guard the Communist Party's Central Committee headquarters.
   The demonstrations were the most widespread display of
opposition to the hard-line Communist policies of the East German
leadership in years and came on the country's 40th anniversary.
More than 10,000 people are believed to have participated in the
protests in the four cities.
   Scores of people were arrested and dozens injured by police who
punched, kicked and dragged away protesters and beat many with
truncheons, according to the reports. There were no official
reports on the number of arrests or injured. Three Western
journalists were reportedly detained.
   About 5,000 people held a pro-reform demonstration at East
Berlin's Alexanderplatz square at the end of a visit by Soviet
President Mikhail S. Gorbachev, a guest of honor during the
anniversary celebrations.
   Many East Germans want their hard-line leaders to adopt the
kinds of democratic reforms undertaken by Gorbachev in the Soviet
Union.
   The demonstrators shouted ``Gorby, Gorby, help us!'' and taunted
the police with calls of ``You people are afraid but we're not.''
   Passing the state-owned ADN news agency office, protesters
chanted ``Liar. Liar'' and ``Press freedom, press freedom.''
   One man's head was smashed against the wall of an East Berlin
apartment building when police were breaking up that demonstration.
   Others were kicked by security police, dragged along the ground
to side streets and hauled away, according to witnesses. Some
Western news photographers also were beaten by police who struck at
their cameras.
   Many East Berlin residents watched the melee from their
apartment windows above the street, waving sparklers to show their
support for the demonstrators.
   Late Saturday an estimated 5,000 people converged in and around
an East Berlin church to demand the release of political prisoners.
   Security forces used clubs to disperse them, reported West
German ZDF television, but witnesses contradicted that report. They
said the demonstrators departed in small groups after they were
promised safe passage through the heavy police presence.
   Catherine Field, a reporter for the British newspaper Observer,
said East German authorities arrested three media colleagues at the
church demonstration. She identified them as Peter Millar of the
Sunday Times of London, Igor Reichlin of the AP-Dow Jones news
agency and Gary Matsumoto of NBC Radio Network News. There was no
immediate confirmation by authorities.
   Police units sealed off an area where people were streaming to
watch fireworks marking the anniversary in a move to prevent
another mass gathering.
   The East Berlin protests were the biggest in the East German
capital since a 1953 workers' uprising. Witnesses said at least 100
people were arrested.
   West Germany's ARD television network said security forces also
used violence to break up a protest march by ``several hundred
people'' in Potsdam, just outside Berlin.
   Violence erupted in Leipzig after about 4,000 people gathered
for a pro-reform demonstration in front of the city's Nikolai
church, witnesses reported.
   They said police, wearing riot helmets and carrying shields,
waded into the crowd of protesters and began beating them.
   The demonstrators offered no resistance but shouted ``No
violence,'' ``Shame on you,'' and ``Gorbachev, Gorbachev!'' the
witnesses said.
   ``Dozens of people were taken into custody,'' said one witness.
   In Dresden, about 2,000 demonstrators battled police overnight
and many people were injured, according to witnesses. The number of
injuries was not immediately known.
   A chain of hundreds of officers attacked the demonstrators, who
responded by hurling bottles and other objects, witnesses said.
   The street battles lasted for several hours, said the witnesses,
who spoke on condition of anonymity. It was the fourth straight
night of violence in Dresden.
   In Berlin, East German authorities barred Western tourists from
the city's Communist eastern sector for a third day.
   ``East Germany apparently fears that regime critics coming from
West Berlin could disturb the 40th anniversary celebrations,'' said
West Germany's ARD television.
   On the east side of Checkpoint Charlie, the government early
Saturday erected 2-yard-high steel and concrete barriers along the
dividing marker between the sectors.
   A man from West Berlin with a crowbar hacked and hammered at the
metal part of the barriers, tearing down one section. He was later
pulled back by West Berlin police.
   About 15 East German border guards stood by as a crowd of about
200 taunted them from the Western side.

<HEAD>U.S. Diplomat Visits Panamanian Opposition Leader</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ELOY O. AGUILAR</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>PANAMA CITY, Panama (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The chief U.S. diplomat in Panama on
Saturday visited opposition leader Guillermo Endara at the papal
envoy's residence, where Endara fled after government soldiers beat
him at his office two days earlier.
   Also Saturday, authorities rounded up 10 opposition party
members from their homes and told them to end political activities
before releasing them, the party said.
   Endara was visited at the papal nuncio's residence by John
Maisto, the U.S. charge d'affaires. Maisto made no statement after
his visit.
   Endara was in the 18th day of a hunger strike to protest the
rule of Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega, the Defense Forces chief who
controls the government.
   The opposition leader was attacked and forced from his office by
Noriega's soldiers during a crackdown in the wake of last week's
failed military coup to overthrow Noriega.
   Noriega has accused U.S. officials of backing Tuesday's
attempted coup. U.S. forces blocked some roads but did not take
part in fighting.
   Congressional investigators were expected in Panama City within
the next few days to determine the role the U.S. played in the
coup, sources said Saturday.
   The planned visit was reported by Panamanian opposition
officials as well as U.S. diplomats and military spokesmen. They
spoke on condition of anonymity. Among those expected was Rep. John
Murtha, D-Pa. He was in Panama as an observer of the May 7
elections, which the government annulled after international
observers said the ticket led by Endara won by a 3-1 margin.
   Congressional critics say the Bush administration should have
strongly backed last week's uprising, which appeared to have the
support of some members of Noriega's High Command.
   In Washington, officials said Saturday that President Bush was
weighing more economic sanctions against Panama and sounding out
members of congressional intelligence committees on covert actions
against Noriega.
   The United States has used political and economic pressure in an
effort to oust Noriega since February 1988, when he was indicted in
Florida on drug- trafficking charges.
   In his crackdown since the failed coup, Noriega has arrested
dozens of soldiers and political figures, taken radio stations off
the air and prepared to impose emergency laws to deal with dissent,
including plans to fire employees viewed as disloyal.
   The members of the opposition Christian Democratic Party were
rounded up at their homes Saturday and taken to regional Defense
Forces headquarters in the city of Herrera, 120 miles west of
Panama, according to party Secretary General Ivan Romero.
   The area party members were told to halt all political
activities, including distributing political ``propaganda'' and
holding meetings. They were also warned ``to stop making phone
calls to Panama City,'' he said.
   They were then released.
   Endara leads the Civil Democratic Opposition Alliance, an
opposition coalition that includes the Christian Democratic Party.

<TEXT>
   A man in a fake mustache, glasses and a phony
accent made the evening news by posing as the spokesman for local
Panamanians opposed to that nation's leader Gen. Manuel Noriega.
   Kurt Rappaport, 22, is a University of Southern California
graduate and son of a lawyer. But viewers who watched the news on
KTTV last Tuesday saw him as Arturo Valdez, chairman of the
nonexistent USA-Panama Friendship Council.
   In a 10-second segment, Rappaport told an interviewer in broken
English that the Southern California Panamanian community was
willing to send ``money, forces _ anything with help from the
United States'' to fight Noriega.
   ``They see right through him, like a clear curtain,'' Rappaport
said.
   Rolando Santos, KTTV's director of news operations, confirmed on
Friday that the station had been hoaxed.
   ``Basically, if you look at the situation, somebody played a
prank on us,'' Santos said. ``We're trying to track down what
happened right now. Obviously, it was not intentional.''
   The news staff followed proper procedures, including calling
officials in Washington D.C., he said.
   Rappaport said the impersonation began on a whim last Tuesday
afternoon when a woman identifying herself as a representative of
the KTTV assignment desk called his home in Beverly Hills.
   The woman asked if she had reached the Panamanian consulate.
Rappaport replied that she had, but no officials were available to
talk. He took down a telephone number and called back a few minutes
later as Arturo Valdez.
   ``I'd just finished playing tennis and I had to take a shower,
put on a suit and tie,'' he said. ``I dug out an old pair of
glasses, but I had to shop around for the mustache.''
   The mustache was slightly askew when he arrived at the Fox TV
studio, so Rappaport declined pancake makeup, exclaiming: ``No! I
am not here to be beautiful. I am here to speak for my country.''
   After the interview, Rappaport discovered that the Panamanian
consulate in Los Angeles had closed Sept. 1.

   Tens of thousands of people marched through rainy
city streets Saturday to protest racism and demand better
conditions for Italy's immigrants.
   Under an intermittent drizzle, the marchers walked through
central Rome behind several African immigrants carrying a banner
reading: ``Together for a future without racism.''
   Organizers said 200,000 people took part, but police estimates
varied from 60,000 to 100,000.
   The march was organized by the Communist labor union CGIL and
dozens of citizens' groups and labor associations.
   Demonstrators called for legislation to improve conditions for
immigrants.
   The demonstration was organized afater the killing of a South
African refugee in southern Italy. The death of the migrant farm
worker at the hands of robbers brought demands for improved living
conditions for immigrants.
   In recent years thousands of immigrants from African and other
Third World countries have come to Italy in search of jobs. Very
few are legally registered and most work for low wages.
   The increase in illegal immigration has sparked occasional
racist outbursts among some Italians.

   State biologists don't know what killed
several hundred white pelicans that were found beside eastern
Sierra lakes and streams that supply drinking water to Los Angeles.
   Authorities stressed that the deaths of the large migratory
birds, while unusual, is no threat to the water supply. But tests
were being conducted to see if something in the water could be
causing the deaths.
   Cousins of the brown pelicans found on the California coast, the
white pelicans nest over a wide area of the West. But the trouble
seems confined to the eastern Sierra.
   ``We don't know the cause of the mortality,'' said Vern Bleich,
wildlife biologist with the California Department of Fish and Game.
   Most of the pelicans have been found during the last three weeks
at Crowley Lake, a reservoir and popular fishing lake run by the
Los Angeles Department of Water and Power north of Bishop.
   Carcasses and stricken birds also have been found farther south
along the Owens River and at Tinemaha and Haiwee reservoirs, part
of Los Angeles' vast Owens Valley waterworks.
   Preliminary tests have found an unusually high number of
parasitic worms in the walls of the stomachs of nearly all the
birds, said David Jessup, a state veterinarian and pathologist in
Sacramento.
   There were signs of malnutrition that could be explained by the
worms, but the birds did not appear to have starved, he said.
   Jessup said, however, that many other causes cannot yet be ruled
out. No significant pesticide residue has been found, but more
detailed tests will be made to see if the pelicans had ingested
high levels of toxic metals, he said.

<HEAD>Covering Drug Trafficking Is IAPA Issue</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CAM ROSSIE</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>MONTERREY, Mexico (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Should journalists risk their lives to
report on drug trafficking?
   About 500 members of the Inter-American Press Association will
discuss that and other topics at this week's annual IAPA gathering
beginning Sunday.
   ``We've put the Colombian publishers in the limelight because of
the issues at stake there,'' said Alejandro Junco de la Vega,
executive director of the Monterrey newspaper El Norte, host of the
meeting.
   Luis Gabriel Cano of the Colombian newspaper El Espectador, the
target of a recent bombing blamed on narcotics traffickers, will
lead a panel discussion about the war between drug lords and the
government in his country.
   ``What should the behavior of the press be when you're risking
your life and your company to write about drugs?'' Junco said in a
interview.
   ``It's a growing problem for Mexican newspapers because Mexico
has been converted into a highway for the trafficking of Colombian
drugs from the fields to the United States,'' he said.
   Monterrey, about 150 miles south of the Texas border, is
northern Mexico's largest city with nearly 3 million people.
   IAPA has about 1,300 members throughout the United States, Latin
America, Canada and the Caribbean.
   Manuel Jimenez, IAPA president, said newspapers need to improve
coverage of drug barons.
   ``The work of the press is to bring them to the surface, to
unmask them. We're not doing it sufficiently well,'' Jimenez said
on his arrival Friday.
   Also to be discussed is the progress of press freedoms,
especially in Latin America, said Jimenez of the daily newspaper La
Nacion in Costa Rica.
   The official program begins Sunday night and Mexican President
Carlos Salinas de Gortari will address the members on Monday. The
meeting lasts through Thursday.

   White House Chief of Staff John Sununu
insisted Saturday that U.S. failure to intervene on behalf of
insurgent Pananmanian officers trying to overthrow Gen. Manuel
Antonio Noriega last week does not foretell U.S. policy.
   He said there will be a time for ``an effective way to get
General Noriega out'' and gave 8-to-5 odds that will happen within
six months.
   At the same time, however, he indicated in a CNN ``Evans and
Novak'' television interview that the United States wanted the
Panama Defense Force coup leaders to turn over Noriega to U.S.
hands without any aggressive action by the United States.
   A news report said the United States decided to ask the coup
leaders for just that action, but the decision came too late.
   The Washington Post reported in its Sunday editions the
commander of U.S. forces in Panama was authorized to covertly take
Noriega to an American military base during last week's coup
attempt. But the authorization came just as the attempted coup
collapsed Tuesday afternoon, the Post quoted administration and
congressional sources as saying.
   The sources told the Post Gen. Colin Powell, chairman of the
Joint Chiefs of Staff, relayed the authorization from Defense
Secretary Dick Cheney to Gen. Maxwell R. Thurman, head of U.S.
forces in Panama.
   Thurman was told any mission would have to be carried out
without visible display of U.S. forces, but military personnel
could act undercover, the Post reported. Powell told Thurman he
could have the rebels deliver Noriega to a U.S. base.
   Powell also told Thurman to avoid the possibility of armed
conflict with pro- and anti-Noriega forces, according to the Post.
He was also ordered to develop a plan to capture Noriega with armed
forces and take him to an American base, but was told the plan
would have to be approved by President Bush before action could be
taken.
   A Pentagon spokesman said late Saturday he could not confirm the
report.
   Sununu, asked Saturday what it would have taken to get Bush to
use military force in the coup, said: ``The easiest thing that
could have happened is if the PDF forces brought Mister Noriega to
territory that is under the treaty, under the control of the United
States and we could enforce the indictment'' against Noriega for
drug trafficking charges.
   Asked whether he meant the administration was unwilling to take
any aggressive action, Sununu replied, ``You're talking about an
invasion of Panama,'' and said the `ideal thing'' is for the
Panamanians to undertake the ouster.
   Congressional criticism of Bush's actions, meanwhile, continued
Saturday, with Sen. David Boren, D-Okla., chairman of the Senate
Intelligence committee, stating that the White House erred in not
having the CIA represented at two key decision-making meetings on
Panama on Monday and Tuesday.
   Criticism has come from both Democrats and Republicans, who
accuse the White House of bungling its way through the crisis and
helping doom the coup.
   Boren said he was also bothered that because, ``I'm not certain
that the president was ever really well served or presented with
the kind of decision options that should have been presented to him.
   He said he could find no evidence that Bush was told the Noriega
loyalists were travelling to the PDF headquarters via routes other
than those blocked by U.S. troops. He complained Bush was never
asked, ``Mister President, will you give us authority to use
American troops to block those routes, to keep those reinforcements
from being able to come in and quash the coup?''
   Meanwhile, a Newsweek magazine poll released Saturday said 60
percent of the 750 adults polled Thursday and Friday said it was
``very important'' to get Noriega out of power and 45 percent
believe the United States lent the right amount of support to the
coup attempt. Nine percent said they thought the United States did
too much and 30 percent not enough.
   Pressed during the CNN interview for his prediction on whether
Noriega would still be in power after six months, Sununu said, ``We
certainly would like to see him out. The president has said he
wants him out, and I can't believe that between the will of the
people of Panama, and the will of the people of the United States,
we can't achieve that. ... If you want odds, I'd say eight-to-five
that he probably will be out.''
   As to why Panamanians should think the United States would back
any future coup efforts with U.S. troops, he said the aborted coup
last week proves there is unrest in the PDF, ``And I would not be
surprised if the PDF understands that when the president says our
quarrel is not with the PDF but with General Noriega that there
will be continued unrest in that and an opportunity will come along
in an effective way to get General Noriega out.''
   Continuing an administration effort to counter criticism that
the United States should have sent its troops to back up the coup,
Sununu said there was no communication from the coup leaders inside
Noriega's headquarters until they were ``about to be overwhelmed''
by Noriega's defenders.
   And, countering congressional allegations that the United States
was given a chance to retrieve Noriega, he said, ``There was no
indication whatsoever whether General Noriega was in there'' in
time for Bush to make a decision on intervening.
   Then, he said, the rebels ``made it clear they did not want to
give General Noriega to the United States'' for trial, and ``right
after that, the superior forces'' of Noriega regained power.
   He also disputed a report that he now wants to alter the
administration's decision-making operation to have the National
Security Council take charge in such crises. The chief of staff
said it was ``appropriate'' during the Panama situation that the
chain of command came through the Pentagon, via Southern Command
headquarters in Panama, to Secretary of Defense Dick Cheney and
then to the White House.

<HEAD>Girl Who Got New Liver After Public Appeals To Have Spleen Removed</HEAD>

   Jamie Fiske, who received a liver transplant
after her father made an emotional appeal for a donor, is scheduled
for surgery to remove her spleen because of internal bleeding, her
father said Saturday.
   The operation will take place Monday at the University of
Minnesota Hospital where the 7-year-old girl underwent a liver
transplant in 1982. It will be her first surgery since the
transplant, said Charles Fiske.
   About the seriousness of her condition, Fiske said, ``We've been
in worse places and times.'' Still, he said, ``It's major surgery
for her, given the fact she had a liver transplant.''
   Jamie and her father traveled to Minneapolis on Thursday from
their home in Bridgewater, Mass. Jamie, who is listed in stable
condition, has suffered three bouts of internal bleeding this fall,
and her doctors think an enlarged spleen may be responsible, he
said.
   Doctors don't believe her problem is related to the liver
transplant, Fiske said. Her spleen began to enlarge a year after
her transplant, but doctors said there had been no complications
until now, he said.
   Jamie was born Nov. 26, 1981, with biliary atresia, a condition
in which the liver's bile ducts are blocked. Months later, the
Fiskes learned that only a liver transplant could save her life.
   She underwent a liver transplant after her father, then a
hospital administrator, made an emotional appeal for a donor during
a convention at the American Academy of Pediatricians. The
nationally televised plea resulted in the offer a few days from a
family in Utah whose 11-month-old son was killed in an accident.

   A bill carrying approval of a unanimous Senate
would allow retirees to keep Medicare catastrophic insurance for
nearly unlimited hospital charges while repealing a surtax that has
threatened the entire program.
   ``Senior citizens will rest a little easier tonight knowing ...
that this body has acted in a sensible fashion,'' said Sen. John
McCain, R-Ariz., author of the bill to salvage parts of the program
but wipe out the surtax.
   Under the bill that cleared the Senate on a 99-0 vote Friday
night, Medicare recipients would lose protection against
catastrophic physicians' fees due to take effect next year and
coverage for prescription drugs that would have been available
starting in 1991.
   The Senate vote set up a confrontation with the House, which
voted 360-66 earlier in the week to repeal the program _ lock,
stock and especially surtax. Negotiators will have to work out a

   Independent investigators say in a highly
critical report that there were dangerous amounts of plutonium in
uncontrolled conditions at the Rocky Flats nuclear weapons plant,
but that there was no evidence of an accidental nuclear reaction.
   ``This is at least the seventh report I've received from the
Department of Energy in the last three years that says Rocky Flats
suffers from lax safety attitudes ... and that also admits things
just aren't improving,'' said Rep. David Skaggs, D-Colo., whose
district includes the 364-acre plant near Golden.
   The inspectors said in a report on safety conditions at the
plant that many changes are needed to improve controls on plutonium
used to shape triggers for nuclear warheads.
   Friday's report said that while no evidence was found that an
accidental nuclear reaction had ever occurred at Rocky Flats, there
is a ``real possibility'' of such a disaster because the plant
operator doesn't properly control all its plutonium.

demands for democracy were not met.
   But after 10 hours of negotiations with Thai and Burmese
officials, the hostages were freed unharmed and the students gave
themselves up.
   ``I think really now it is a matter of looking at the details of
the negotiations and the conditions for the surrender,'' said a
senior Thai official, on condition of anonymity.

   A new study weakens the evidence linking
manic-depressive illness to a genetic defect as proposed in a
widely reported 1987 paper, says a scientist who participated in
both studies.
   Although the evidence remains suggestive, ``it's not up to the
accepted or the conventional level of significance that has been
used in these kinds of studies,'' said David Pauls.
   The original study had been hailed as the first to show a
genetic defect in a psychiatric illness that includes no physical
abnormalities in the brain.
   But with the new data, researchers are ``not nearly as confident
as we were'' that they had found the approximate location of such a
gene, said Pauls of the Yale University School of Medicine.
