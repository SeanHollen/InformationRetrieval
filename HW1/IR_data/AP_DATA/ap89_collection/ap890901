   Baseball Commissioner A. Bartlett
Giamatti, who left the presidency of Yale University for the game he
loved, died Friday after suffering a heart attack just five months
into the sport's top job. He was 51.
   Giamatti died at his weekend retreat on Martha's Vineyard eight
days after he banned Cincinnati Reds Manager Pete Rose from
baseball. The decision followed a six-month battle over allegations
that Rose bet on his own team.
   Giamatti, whose wife and son were with him when he died, was
pronounced dead at 4:32 p.m. after ``all-out'' efforts to revive him
failed, said Matthew Stockpole of Martha's Vineyard Hospital.
   The commissioner was unconscious and in full cardiac arrest when
an ambulance arrived at his home at 3 p.m., the hospital said in a
statement. Cardiopulmonary resuscitation was administered in the
ambulance, and doctors at the hospital worked for more than an hour
to revive him.
   Giamatti, a chain-smoker who once said cigarettes were his
``primary vice,'' left New York in the morning to spend the Labor
Day weekend on the popular New England resort island.
   Giamatti's death shocked baseball even as it was still recovering
from Rose's suspension.
   In an interview with The Associated Press two weeks ago, Giamatti
dismissed the suggestion that he had been overly stressed by the
Rose matter.
   ``While it's a serious matter, it doesn't take most of the
time,'' he said. ``Most of the time is spent ... on other things.
The way it's been played, and there's no reason it shouldn't have
been played, would make you think that I was been sitting here all
day worrying about that. But that hasn't been the case for months.''
   Rose was ``deeply saddened'' by the news of Giamatti's death, his
attorney, Robert A. Pitcairn, said in a statement issued in
Cincinnati.
   ``In spite of their dispute, Pete had great personal respect for
the commissioner,'' the statement said. ``He extends his deepest
sympathy to Commissioner Giamatti's family.''
   Giamatti became baseball's seventh commissioner April 1, and was
to have the shortest reign, eclipsing the three years and three
months of William Eckert from 1965-1969.
   Giamatti was the first commissioner to die in office since
Kenesaw Mountain Landis, one of his role models, died in 1944. Like
Giamatti, Landis made his mark with a lifetime ban, against Shoeless
Joe Jackson and seven other members of the infamous Chicago Black
Sox, who were accused of taking money from a gambler to throw the
1919 World Series.
   At Boston's Fenway Park, home of Giamatti's beloved Red Sox,
flags were lowered to half-staff.
   New York Yankees owner George Steinbrenner said he spoke to
Giamatti by phone about 45 minutes before the commissioner was
stricken.
   ``I may have been the last person to talk to him. He was happy.
We laughed,'' Steinbrenner said. ``We've lost perhaps a true
Renaissance man. Any other commissioner there ever will be will pale
by comparison. He was brilliant. He was compassionate. He cared for
the game and cared for its people.''
   ``It was a tremendous shock,'' said deputy commissioner Francis
T. Vincent Jr. ``I dropped him off at noon on Martha's Vineyard and
he seemed OK. He had great friends and admirers. Baseball, his
family, his friends, the country suffered a big loss. This was a
uniquely talented man. It's a very sad event, a tragedy for a lot of
people.''
   President Bush, vacationing in Kennebunkport, Maine, said, ``Bart
was a close friend of mine for many, many years. I just want to pay
my respects. He was a great person.
   ``He loved the game of baseball and in a short time made a real
contribution to the game, standing for the highest possible ethical
standards,'' said Bush, who played baseball for Yale.
   Giamatti, president of the Ivy League school from 1978 to 1985
and a specialist in comparative literature, succeeded Peter
Ueberroth. He had been National League president since December 1986.
   ``Baseball has been deprived today of the services of its finest
commissioner in history,'' Ueberroth, vacationing in Paris, said in
a statement released through his Newport, Calif., office. ``Bart
Giamatti encompassed everything that is good and enduring about
America's favorite pastime. For this man of words, courage and deeds
... no words can express the loss.''
   ``He gave of himself magnificently to Yale as a teacher, as a
scholar and as a leader,'' said Benno C. Schmidt Jr., who succeeded
Giamatti at Yale. ``This university will be a better place because
of his service. He will never be forgotten at this university.''
   Baseball rules call for the executive council, comprised of the
two league presidents and eight club owners, to oversee the game
until a new commissioner is chosen.
   Angelo Bartlett Giamatti, born in Boston on April 4, 1938, got an
early start as a baseball administrator _ as manager of the South
Hadley, Mass., high school team in 1951.
   But books also deeply attracted the man who would later say that
he always found baseball ``the most satisfying and nourishing of
games outside of literature.''
   Giamatti, an internationally recognized scholar on the
Renaissance, was 40 when he became president of Yale, the school's
youngest in 200 years. He had joined the Yale faculty in 1966 after
teaching Italian and comparative literature at Princeton University.
   When he took charge of Yale, Giamatti was faced with a budget
deficit of $2 million, but he balanced the budget in four years.
   His most difficult time came in 1984, when more than 2,600
clerical and technical workers went on a bitter 10-week strike.
About another 1,000 blue-collar workers, including food service
employees and janitors, refused to cross the picket lines.
   While Yale president, Giamatti emerged as an articulate spokesman
for a liberal college education. In 1981, he attacked the Moral
Majority as ``peddlers of coercion'' and said their aims were
antithetical to a liberal education.
   During the AP interview two weeks ago, Giamatti said being
baseball commissioner was a lot like being a university president.
   ``I tell you the truth, this job reminds me much more of the one
I had at Yale. The National League one was much more concerned with
what went on out on the field.
   ``I mean the whole purpose of working in baseball is to remember
that you're also a fan of baseball. I'm vitally interested in what
goes on on the field. I was lucky to have those 2{ years in the
National League. It allowed me to have some peripheral engagement,
to learn a lot. I like baseball. I try to see as much baseball as
possible,'' he said.
   Giamatti is survived by his wife, the former Toni Smith, and
three children: Marcus Bartlett, Paul Edward Valentine and Elena
Walton Giamatti.

<TEXT>
   A 57-year-old San Diego State University
professor who once worked as a California Highway Patrol officer was
among four people arrested during a raid Thursday on a marijuana
farm, authorities said.
   Agents seized 800 marijuana plants, some as much as 14 feet tall,
and arrested Jack David Mooers, an associate professor of teacher
education at SDSU, Narcotics Task Force officials said.
   Also taken into custody at the farm outside Jamul in rural
eastern San Diego County were Mooers' wife, real estate developer
Betty Mooers, 65; James Wesley Johnson, 44; and Bartolo Espinoza
Mercado, 36.
   All four face charges of cultivating marijuana for sale.
   The 50-acre farm was raided after deputies in a sheriff's
helicopter spotted the marijuana plants while hovering over a nearby
methamphetamine lab in a raid two weeks ago, said sheriff's deputy
Steve Reed.
   Agents also found an underground drying room at the farm and
several platic trash bags filled with marijuana buds, said Reed.
   Mooers was a CHP patrol officer in the 1960s and a parole officer
before leaving law enforcement to teach, said San Diego police Lt.
Skip DiCerchio. Mooers began work at the university in 1968, a
campus spokesman said.
   His wife worked in the police department's business office in the
1950s, DiCerchio said.

   Shoplifters and others who commit crimes
in a new supermarket can expect to deal with the Pawtucket police _
unless they steal produce or try to cash bad checks.
   Because Shaw's Supermarket straddles the Providence-Pawtucket
line, the two cities' police departments met recently to decide who
is responsible for crimes in different sections of the store.
   ``The check cashing booth is in Providence, so any checks passed
at the courtesy booth that come back bad will be handled by
Providence,'' said Pawtucket police Capt. Carl Benson. ``We got all
the cash registers.
   ``As far as shoplifters go, I'm told that the only part of the
market that is in Providence is produce, so we expect we'll get most
of the shoplifters.
   ``Not many people steal apples and oranges.''
   Several people have been arrested for shoplifting since the store
opened two weeks ago _ all of them in Pawtucket's section, Benson
said.

<HEAD>Dick Clark To Serve Up Nostalgia At Restaurant</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MIAMI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Dick Clark, whose ``American Bandstand'' spanned
decades of musical tastes, intends to see if he can get to the top
of the charts satisfying tastes for food.
   He expects to open his American Bandstand Grill in downtown Miami
by January and greet patrons with a heavy dose of nostalgia,
including rock 'n' roll memorabilia such as Elvis Presley's cape and
Elton John's shoes.
   The two-story establishment will resemble the studio from
``Bandstand,'' which premiered in Philadelphia in 1952. Clark joined
the show four years later and was the program's host for more than
30 years until earlier this year.
   Dancers will be able to watch themselves on television monitors,
another trademark of ``Bandstand.'' Also planned is a recording
studio where aspiring singers can make a tape complete with
background singers, music and an introduction by the 59-year-old
Clark.
   ``American Bandstand,'' a fixture on ABC-TV for years, is TV's
longest-running musical program and continues to air on the USA
cable network.
   At the upscale Bayfront setting where Clark intends to open for
business, another celebrity has failed in similar venture. In
February, Mariel Hemingway's restaurant, Zemo's, closed after only a
month.

   When the German army invaded Poland, AP
correspondent Lloyd Lehrbas was there to report it. His early
dispatches, based on confused Polish reports, told of the initial
German thrusts. In the following article, filed 12 hours after the
first border bombings, Lehrbas gives an eyewitness account of a
German air attack on the Polish capital.
   Lehrbas eventually followed the retreating Polish government out
of the country. He went on to become an AP reporter in Washington,
an aide to Gen. Douglas MacArthur and, after the war, executive
editor of U.S. News &amp; World Report.

   WARSAW, Sept. 1-(5:35 p.m.-11:35 a.m., E.S.T.)-(AP) _ German war
planes swooped over Warsaw this afternoon in an air attack in
advance of three German armies invading this country.
   I am telephoning this dispatch to Budapest with the phone in one
hand and a gas mask in the other.
   From where I am I can hear the wail of power-diving fighting
ships and can see 14 German bombers slowly, steadily following the
course of the Vistula River, Poland's outlet to the sea.
   Apparently they are attempting to destroy all bridges.
   The raid began at about 4:30 p.m. and is still continuing more
than an hour later.
   The German air raiders now _ 5:35 p.m. _ are coming back after
making a wide circle.
   They apparently are heading toward the government buildings in
the center of downtown, Warsaw.
   I can see puffs of anti-aircraft fire.
   Although the raid is still on, there is no panic.
   Across the street from me, hundreds of inhabitants are watching
fascinated on the rooftops.
   Tremendous explosions are shaking the city and rattling windows.
   Anti-aircraft shells are bursting around the bombers which are
coming over at an altitude of about 6,000 feet.
   Warsaw had little warning.
   Elmer W. Peterson, Associated Press chief of bureau here, and I
heard the anti-aircraft guns before we heard the scream of air-raid
alarm sirens.
   If the bombers have tied up traffic over the steel railroad
bridge spanning the Vistula it is a serious blow for Poland's
traffic from here to the coast and the west.
   The Germans apparently tried for definitely military objectives.
   Reports have started reaching here of German air attacks
elsewhere in Poland.
   A large number of women and children were killed, a Government
communique said, when German planes bombed a refugee train from
Poznan at the Kutno station, 70 miles west of Warsaw.
   The first air raid on Polish territory, it said, occurred at Puck
_ near Danzig _ at 5:40 a.m.
   It said three German planes were shot down near Krakow, four
others near Gdynia _ the Polish port on the same harbor as Danzig _
and that Polish troops had seized a German armored train at Chojnice.
   The communique charged that German troops invading Pomorze (the
Polish Corridor) were ``murdering the Polish population.''
   ``Contrary to Hitler's announcement,'' the communique said,
``many of the towns bombed had no military or strategic value.''
   Nine of the bombers that raided Warsaw flew in the westerly
direction across the city, apparently toward the central railroad
station.
   They have been doing some exceptionally daring bombing, however,
sometimes diving to about 3,000 feet over the Vistula bridges.
   It is now 5:40 p.m. and the sound of anti-aircraft guns and
roaring motors has died away.
   Apparently the raid is over.
   A large hospital for feeble-minded Jewish children was said to
have been hit by the German air raiders late in the afternoon.

<HEAD>Moluccans Still Await Repatriation in Dutch Camps</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: Also in Friday AMs report.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PAUL VERSCHUUR</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>VUGHT, Netherlands (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Forty years after the Netherlands lost
the pearl of its East Asian empire, thousands of its former colonial
subjects still live in exile here, awaiting repatriation to their
own nation that never came to be.
   Camp Lunetten in Vught is the last of 74 resettlement camps
established to house Moluccan troops who fought for the Dutch in
their losing war with rebels in the 1940s in what then was the Dutch
East Indies and now is Indonesia.
   Lunetten, a former Nazi concentration camp, is the Netherlands'
most visible symbol of Moluccan nationalist aspirations, despite the
fact that their homeland, a sprinkling of islands west of New
Guinea, was long ago swallowed up by Indonesia.
   The 220 Moluccans still living in the ramshackle brick buildings
maintain it is their symbol of defiance against the Dutch, whom they
say reneged on a pledge to secure them an independent Moluccan
nation.
   ``As long as we don't have our own nation, we're just living from
one day to the next. We'll always be Moluccans,'' said 30-year-old
Ety Huliselan, who was born, raised and still lives in Camp Lunetten.
   ``We've always been homesick here. It's not our country but a
strange country,'' said her 61-year-old father Johannes, a former
private in the Royal Netherlands East Indies Army.
   Despite assimilation and the passage of four decades, most
Moluccans still hold to the vision of an independent homeland,
according to current and former Dutch government officials.
   The Dutch government says it promised only to do its best to
secure a Moluccan homeland and that political realities have since
ruled out such an effort.
   Moluccan resentment exploded into terrorism in the 1970s when
Moluccan nationalists seized a school, two trains and the Indonesian
Consulate in Amsterdam. The attacks left 11 people dead.
   When the Indonesian separatists defeated the Dutch in 1949, the
Moluccans proclaimed their own Republic of the South Moluccas.
   To save them from possible Indonesian reprisals, however, the
Dutch evacuated about 4,000 Moluccan troops and 8,500 dependents to
the Netherlands in 1951.
   In all, about 45,000 Moluccans now live in the Netherlands, many
still torn between their families' authoritarian traditions and the
more liberal Dutch culture.
   Moluccan drug abuse and Dutch-language illiteracy rates far
exceed the national average, and their unemployment rate of up to 60
percent is four times higher.
   Successive Dutch governments have tried to integrate the
Moluccans into Dutch culture but have also given them more
preferential treatment than any other ethnic minority in this nation
of 14.6 million.
   ``These people have been pampered by the state for years,'' said
Maurice van Hurck, the Welfare Ministry official responsible for
Lunetten. ``They're looking for an enemy on which to vent all their
aggression and the enemy is the Welfare Ministry.''
   Until 1956, all Moluccans lived in camps, where they were issued
free food and clothing. Since then, the government has built them
2,800 rental units and about 50 churches in a program that has no
parallel even in the generous Dutch welfare state.
   A $6.9-million Vught housing project designed along the
organizational lines of Moluccan village stands virtually empty
because Lunetten's residents refuse to move.
   The residents maintain their camp has great symbolic value in
their fight and maintain that leaving it would imply giving in on
their position that they're victims of government neglect.
   Van Hurck said rents in the camp start at the Dutch guilders
equivalent of only $8 a month, and gas, electricity and water are
free. Rents in the new housing complex start at $90 a month, which
is still very low by Dutch standards. Gas and electrical services
for a Dutch household run $90-$180 a month, depending on the size of
the home.
   The Moluccan nationalist movement, which has a
president-in-exile, 79-year-old Johannes Manusama, provided the
Moluccans with a ``new foothold to hang on to their pride,'' said
Annelies Kouwenhoven, a specialist on Moluccan culture.
   ``It's the teaching of a lifetime to Moluccans that the entire
Moluccan culture be transferred from father to son, from mother to
daughter,'' said Mrs. Kouwenhoven, former secretary of the
Dutch-Indonesian Joint Committee on Moluccan Affairs.
   Some Lunetten resident claim they were never officially
demobilized from the Dutch army and are owed 38 years' back pay by
the Dutch government.
   The government has paid for Moluccan youths to travel to the
Moluccan islands so they could choose between life under Indonesia
and life in the Netherlands.
   Only a few have opted for the Moluccas, according to Mrs.
Kouwenhoven.
   Lena Dejong, 32, a second-generation Moluccan woman married to a
Dutchman said young Moluccans continue to profess a belief in
Moluccan nationalism only out of respect for their elders.
   ``We're used to so many things here,'' she said.

   The world watches while a death struggle is
played out by the Colombian government and the nation's powerful
drug lords. But violence is by no means a newcomer to this
blood-stained nation, where a walk in the woods can spur a
confrontation with bandits, death squads or revolutionaries. Here is
a look at Colombia's long history of violence.
</TEXT>
<BYLINE>By TOM WELLS</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A chance encounter with a band of rebels
or a hunt for gems in a jungle river can literally mean life or
death in Colombia, a dangerous land long before the drug lords began
their latest wave of terror.
   The government's war with narcotics traffickers has captured the
world's attention while partially obscuring the fact that Colombia,
for many years, has been a violent place to live.
   More than 75,000 people have been killed in political violence
during the last 25 years, most of them in attempts by a half dozen
leftist guerrilla groups to overthrow the Colombian government.
   Between 1949 and 1953, another 250,000 people died in a war
between the nation's two biggest political parties. Such was the
hatred in that conflict that entire villages, including elderly
people and children, were wiped out. Dump trucks would pour
screaming prisoners over steep cliffs.
   Today, guerrillas execute their own troops for treason, drug
traffickers wage war on other drug traffickers, bandits battle for
control of the nation's emerald mines, and right-wing death squads
issue periodic reminders that they are still around.
   Additionally, about 12,000 people are killed yearly by common
criminals, the national police said in a recent communique.
   The breadth and intensity of Colombian violence at any given time
is perhaps why Colombians scoff when they hear foreign news reports
that describe them as panicky and terror-stricken, a population
huddled indoors while the drug war is played out.
   Colombia's emerald mines, for example, are regular scenes of
violence. Dozens have been killed as bandits struggle for control of
the mines in the hot, steamy parts of the country.
   An army colonel once told an Associated Press reporter who
visited one of the mines that there is an average of one murder a
day among the people who look for emeralds in a shallow river where
a mine dumps rocks taken from a mine.
   Emerald buyers who go to the mines travel in convoys and carry
machine guns and hand grenades. Several times a year the convoys
coming from the mines are ambushed by bandits.
   Two months ago, the army and a group involved in the emerald war
battled with guns in an apartment building 200 yards from the U.S.
ambassador's residence in Bogota. The army found anti-tank weapons,
submachine guns and hand grenades in raided apartment.
   Right-wing death squads have taken a heavy toll in Colombia,
killing more than 1,000 people in the last four years.
   The leftist Patriotic Union party has been the hardest hit, with
751 of its members gunned down or blown up.
   Colombia's Justice Department said recently it suspects the death
squads are operated by drug traffickers.
   Guerrillas long have extorted money from cattle ranchers in the
form of a so called revolution tax. In recent years drug traffickers
have bought up hundreds of ranches.
   When the traffickers refused to pay the revolution tax, the
guerrillas began kidnapping ranchers for ransom. The death squads
are believed to be the drug traffickers' method of settling the
score with the rebels.
   Many of the Patriotic Union's members are former guerrillas who
accepted an amnesty offered by the government four years ago.
   Drug traffickers have been warring among themselves during the
last year for supremacy in smuggling cocaine into the United States.
So far, 180 members of two gangs, one in Cali and the other in
Medellin, have been killed.
   About 150 drug stores belonging to the Cali traffickers have been
blown up in the last year. Victims in the gang war are usually found
riddled with bullets on the outskirts of town.
   Aside from hundreds of casualties each year in the war between
leftist guerrillas and the government's security forces, rural
peasants also get caught up in the conflict.
   Both guerrillas and the army often suspect peasants of being
guerrilla sympathizers or army spies.
   Frequently, a guerrilla band will march through a jungle area and
ask to buy food and other supplies from a farmer.
   The peasant, afraid to refuse, sells much of what he has. Then,
the army arrives and says it has been told that the peasant has been
helping the guerrillas.
   The peasant is often tortured until he tells what he knows of the
guerrillas who came through his farm.
   After that, the guerrillas return and shoot the farmer for
betraying them to the army.

   The Najjar brothers say they
are victims, but fellow villagers call them collaborators. They sit
on the third floor of their fire-damaged home, cradling Uzi
submachine guns provided by Israel.
   With the three brothers are several men from other villages who
joined them in the ruined house after being accused of collaborating
with the Israeli occupation.
   Many of the 100 Palestinians killed by other Palestinians in the
uprising that began nearly 21 months ago were accused of helping
Israel, whose soldiers and settlers have killed more than 550
Palestinians.
   Others of this hilltop town's 10,000 residents accuse Israel of
sponsoring a reign of terror. They say the Najjars and other alleged
collaborators are guilty of beatings, arson, random shooting and
seizing of pro-PLO activists.
   ``They have tear gas, sound bombs, live bullets, everything,''
said Hamzeh Hamarsheh, whose son, Luay, a lawyer, was hospitalized
with head wounds after a beating in July. ``They must be removed.
They are a threat to safety.''

windows across from the Najjar house, pointed to eight bullet holes
in his door.
   Two weeks ago, he said, the Najjar brothers locked him and his
workers in the shop and stood guard until Israeli soldiers arrived
and arrested his nephew, who was wanted for uprising activities.
Later, the Najjars set fire to his car, Attatrih said.
   ``They are ruining things, but what can we do?'' he said. ``I
think I will have to move my shop.''
   Hamarsheh said town leaders complained to Israeli authorities but
nothing was done. The army says a police investigation began after
Israel television reported on alleged abuses.
   The case of Yaabad is one of a growing number. Israeli security
forces are reported to have increased the arming of Palestinian
collaborators in recent weeks.
   Palestinians claim the Israeli army encourages creation of
anti-PLO militias, but the military says weapons are given to
protect threatened Palestinians.
   ``Shock Committees'' that support the Palestine Liberation
Organization have been blamed for the deaths of most of the 100
Palestinians killed by others.
   Col. Raanan Gissin, deputy army spokesman, said in an interview
that Palestinians were armed ``on a highly selective, case-by-case
basis'' for self-defense.
   He would not confirm they were collaborators, but said the
Palestinians were under ``strict control with the clear
understanding that, if the weapons are used improperly, they have to
withstand the consequences.''
   Dedi Zucker, a legislator from the left-wing Citizens Rights
Movement, said in a letter to the Defense Ministry: ``What is
happening in Yaabad is an illegitimate example of protection being
given by Israel.''
   Arab reporters said at least 40 collaborators had been given
weapons in this region 45 miles north of Jerusalem and several had
formed the equivalent of militias, sometimes operating with Israeli
soldiers.
   In Habla village, the reporters said, three collaborators who
shared a house opened fire to scatter pro-PLO protesters and seized
boys painting anti-Israeli graffiti until soldiers arrived to arrest
them.
   Gissin denied the army promoted formation of militias, but
Defense Minister Yitzhak Rabin recently said Israel would encourage
Palestinians to fight pro-PLO activists.
   Trouble in Yaabad began a year ago when townspeople became
suspicious that the Najjars _ Bassam, 35; Ali, 27; and Omar, 23 _
were colluding with Israeli security services. They were convinced
when a Najjar sister was seen carrying a pistol, which Arabs usually
are forbidden to own.
   Palestinian activists ordered over loudspeakers that Najjars be
shunned. The family business of making aluminum blinds was ruined,
four of their cars were burned and they finally moved away with
their wives and children.
   The house was looted and set afire.
   Omar Najjar, standing guard with his Uzi on the soot-stained top
floor, said his family was wronged and had returned to reclaim its
rightful place in the community.
   ``I used to be active in the uprising,'' he said. ``I carried the
Palestinian flag in the marches. But they turned on us here. They
hounded us even after we moved, spreading rumors in our new
village.''
   Bassam suggested on Israeli TV that their relationship with
Israel was official. ``We belong to the Shabak (Shin Bet security
service),'' he said. ``We have orders. They told us not to do
damage. We don't. They allow us to protect ourselves.''
   Their return coincided with the opening of a military government
office, guarded by several rooftop sentry posts, in the village. Two
of the posts are within sight of the Najjar house, which is linked
to one by a military phone.

infidelity for the breakup.
   For this year, the court said 27,778 cases alread had been filed

   Family counselors say rising incomes, dual-career families and
the increased stress of urban living have contributed to the breakup

<HEAD>Medical Researchers Say Urinary Screening Tests of Limited Value</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   More than 50 million U.S. urine tests performed
each year with simple chemical ``dipsticks'' cost more than $150
million and many are unnecessary, medical researchers say.
   Two studies published in Friday's Journal of the American Medical
Association found that dipstick urinalysis _ the most commonly used
urine test _ is unjustified for healthy young men and women, though
it may be useful for screening patients 60 years or older for
unsuspected urinary problems.
   Dipstick urinalysis is one of the most frequently ordered tests
by internists and family practitioners for urinary tract disorders
ranging from infection to malignancy.
   The test involves dipping a chemically treated stick into a urine
sample. Changes in color on the chemically treated sticks can
indicate the presence of sugar, proteins, blood and other substances
that may point to possible bacterial infections or other bladder and
kidney problems.
   About 30 percent of all office visits to internists generate a
dipstick urinalysis, resulting in more than 50 million tests each
year, said the studies by the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force.
   At $3 per test, dipsticks add more than $150 million annually to
the nation's health-care bill, the authors said.
   In both studies, the authors said pregnant women should be
screened for urinary problems, but they recommended using more
sensitive tests such as urine cultures and microscopic examinations
rather than dipstick urinalysis.
   The first study, conducted by Dr. Steffie Woolhander and
colleagues at Harvard Medical School in Boston, looked at the
effectiveness of dipstick urinalysis for detecting blood and protein
in the urine.
   The authors concluded that the benefits of screening symptom-free
young adults are outweighed by the risks of following up false
positives with further and more invasive testing.
   But they said such tests may be appropriate for men and women
over 60 because they have a higher disease prevalence; the
researchers recommended further study to determine the effectiveness
of such screening.
   The second study, by Dr. Richard J. Pels and colleagues at
Harvard, found that dipstick testing of adults under 60 for evidence
of bacterial urinary tract infection is also unwarranted for similar
reasons.
   But they said dipstick screening for bacteria may be appropriate
for women who are over 60 years of age or diabetic.
   Both studies based their findings on a review and analysis of
medical literature, including data from five population-based
studies.
   These studies showed that fewer than 1.5 percent to 2 percent of
young adults with positive blood or protein dipstick results
actually had a serious and treatable urinary tract disease.

   Columbia police found the 3-foot-long reptile Wednesday evening

   ``They called and said they wanted to give her back,'' police
Capt. Dennis Veach said. ``They said they were sorry for stealing

   How do you bake a 100,000-pound cake? In
pieces, with a lot of help and tons of ingredients.
   The attempt to bake the world's largest cake will be the
highlight of Fort Payne's centennial celebration Oct. 18. It will be
35 feet wide and 70 feet long and shaped like the state of Alabama.
   According to the Guinness Book of World Records, the largest cake
baked so far weighed 90,000 pounds. It was put together in Austin,
Texas, to celebrate Texas' 150th anniversary in 1986.
   Gary Gengozian, publisher of The Times Journal newspaper in Fort
Payne, said he got the idea for the cake while serving as president
of the Chamber of Commerce last year.
   ``I felt if we were going to celebrate our Centennial then we
needed to do something people would never forget _ something our
kids and theirs after them could be proud of,'' he said.
   Gary Gilbert of EarthGrains Inc. figures it will take at least 75
employees to mix, bake and ice the cake. The bakery, Fort Payne's
biggest single employer with 750 workers, is making most of the cake.
   The ingredients: 17,680 pounds of granulated sugar, 23,840 pounds
of cake flour, 15,000 pounds of icing, 450 gallons of milk, 9,520
pounds of corn syrup; 1,280 pounds of vegetable oil, 23,840 pounds
of water, 80 pounds of vanilla extract, 960 pounds of baking powder,
320 pounds of salt and 800 pounds of dairy whey.
   The effort will require 150 special steel pans to bake the more
than 17,000 individual sheets that will be assembled into 288 layers.

<HEAD>US Puts Noriega's Wealth at $200 Million-$300 Million</HEAD>
<BYLINE>EDs: SUBS 15th pvs, This was ... to show Panamanian officials annulled
election results after victory of anti-Noriega candidate. ^By GEORGE GEDDA</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Calling him a man of ``shameless excess,'' a
top State Department official said Thursday that Panamanian Gen.
Manuel Antonio Noriega has amassed a personal fortune of between
$200 million and $300 million from drug trafficking and other
criminal activities.
   Deputy Secretary of State Lawrence Eagleburger made the
allegation in response to a challenge from a Panamanian diplomat
last week for the Bush administration to back up its claim that
Noriega has a long history of involvement in drug smuggling.
   Eagleburger spoke to a meeting of the Organization of American
States' permanent council, which was convened at a State Department
request.
   Much of his presentation was devoted to repeating charges
contained in indictments returned by two Florida grand juries in
February 1988.
   But no administration official had ever before offered an
official estimate of Noriega's wealth.
   ``By conservative estimates, we judge Noriega's personal wealth
(much of it hidden in secret bank accounts abroad) to be at least
$200 (million) to $300 million,'' Eagleburger said.
   In response, an American lawyer for Noriega, Frank Anthony
Rabino, said Eagleburger had failed to back up his allegations about
wrongdoing with evidence.
   ``The government has not offered what they promised, which was
proof,'' he said. ``They have again asked you and me and others to
use our imagination, to let our dreams run wild and maybe we'll find
something evil in Gen. Noriega if we speculate, as they asked us to
do, long and hard,'' said Rabino, who served as a member of the
Panamanian delegation for Thursday's meeting.
   Rabino said much of the U.S. case against Noriega was based on
the testimony of Steven Kalish, a one-time Noriega confidant and a
convicted drug smuggler who was given a reduced sentence for his
disclosures against Noriega.
   In Kennebunkport, Maine, where President Bush is vacationing,
national security adviser Brent Scowcroft told reporters the
administration would be making a statement on Friday regarding the
new situation in Panama.
   Bush, in a joint news conference with Canadian Prime Minister
Brian Mulroney, said he was not giving up on the multinational
diplomacy approach to oust Noriega. ``I am going to continue to work
with the leaders in this hemisphere, most of whom feel as I do about
Noriega, to see if we can't help the Panamanian people get what they
deserve. And that is a democratic society that stems from free, fair
elections,'' he said.
   A partial listing of Noriega's assets include, according to
Eagleburger, a $600,000 mansion in Panama City, a farm and an
apartment in France, several luxury apartments in the Dominican
Republic, various jet aircraft, including a Boeing 727 and three
large pleasure yachts _ ``The Macho I, Macho II and Macho III.''
   ``So let us put aside once and for all this contention that Gen.
Noriega is a poor, humble honest man who has been unjustly
accused,'' Eagleburger said.
   He said the story behind last year's indictments ``is simple and
chilling. It is the story of that same shameless excess in the
criminal field'' that, Eagleburger claimed, also has been
demonstrated in the political field.
   This was a reference to the decision of Panamanian authorities to
void presidential elections last May after independent observers
concluded that the anti-Noriega candidate, Guillermo Endara, had won
by a landslide.
   Eagleburger's speech was prompted by an appeal last Thursday by a
Panamanian diplomat, Romulo Escobar Betancourt, in which he asked
that the United States back up its allegations about Noriega.
   The occasion last week was an OAS foreign ministers meeting
convened to discuss the possibility of promoting a democratic
transfer of power in Panama. The OAS effort collapsed after three
months, and the Council of State in Panama on Thursday appointed a
new president, Comptroller Francisco Rodriguez, to take over on
Friday. Noriega will continue as the country's defacto leader.
   In his speech, Eagleburger said, ``Noriega protected cocaine
shipments from from Medellin, Colombia through Panama to the United
States.''
   He said that Noriega provided refuge and a base for continued
operations to the members of the Medellin cartel after the murder of
a Colombian justice minister in 1984.
   ``He agreed to protect a cocaine laboratory being constructed on
Darien Province,'' Eagleburger said. ``And he assured the safe
passage of millions of dollars of narcotics proceeds into Panamanian
banks.''
   In Kennebunkport, Bush said he and Mulroney had discussed the
Panama situation Thursday. ``Clearly we're not going to recognize
Mr. Noriega. We've got sanctions in place that will continue. We are
considering what additionally might be done,'' the president said.
   ``There's a high frustration level; I'm ready to concede that.
But we are not going to give up on this,'' Bush said.
   He said ``no comment'' when asked if there was a coup movement
afoot in the Panamanian military.
   Despite Bush's pronouncement that the administration is
considering what further steps it might take, administration
officials say privately there is little more Bush can do short of
military intervention or kidnaping of Noriega, both remote
possibilities.

dangling over the front seat registered 122 degrees Fahrenheit.
   Tan leaned into the car and pointed his can of Instant Car
Kooler. ``Psst-psst-psst.''
   Within half a minute, the thermometer had plunged 42 degrees to a
more bearable 80 degrees. He said the sunshade alone reduces heat by
only 10 degrees to 15 degrees.
   Tan, 57, began working on his invention about 10 years ago, when
his young son complained frequently about the suffocating heat in
the family car.
   ``From physics, I know that water absorbs plenty of heat. It is a
good medium for moderating temperatures,'' Tan said. ``I also
thought that when it gets so hot, we pray for rain, and after it
rains we know that the temperature drops.''
   Tan got his idea.
   ``It's like making rain inside the car, but the difference is
that we don't make the whole car wet. Instead of rain there are
drops of spray so fine that they vaporize right away,'' he said.
   He also observed a baby's fever is reduced when its body is
rubbed with water mixed with alcohol. So Tan added ethyl alcohol, or
ethanol, to the car spray to make the water vaporize faster and
reduce the air temperature even further.
   Born in Fukien, China, and reared in the Philippines, Tan
obtained a doctorate in physics from the University of Oregon in
1968, taught college physics in Rochester, N.Y., and did laser
research at the National Bureau of Standards in Washington until he
entered private business in the 1970s. He and his wife run a jewelry
and gift shop in an Alexandria shopping mall.
   Tan received a patent for Instant Car Kooler in April, and began
marketing the 16-ounce spray cans in mid-August. The retail price is
$3.50 each.
   In less than three weeks, Tan and his two business partners have
received orders for more than 25,000 cans from prospective
distributors from New York to Texas, and as far away as Austria and
Switzerland.
   One exporter wants to ship Instant Car Kooler to the Middle East,
where Tan says the heat inside automobiles can soar to 165 degrees
or more.
   Tan says his son, now a 22-year-old college physics major, is
delighted with his father's invention and gives away samples to his
friends.
   ``I'm a very religious person, so I give nature credit for the
idea,'' the elder Tan said in an interview Wednesday.
   A devout Roman Catholic, Tan is pleased that he's helping
motorists stay cool.
   ``I try to serve God,'' he said. ``He gave me a mission to do,
and I consider this as a gift from God to mankind.''

   Philomena Jurey wrote her memoirs but can't get
them published. She's known around the world, but a stranger in her
own land. It's the story of her life, she sighs.
   Mrs. Jurey, who ends a 37-year career in journalism today,
covered American presidents for the Voice of America for 14 years.
   In hamlets in Albania and huts in Borneo, her radio voice is
familiar to millions.
   To people who never heard of Dan Rather, she is a megastar.
   And people who watch Rather every night never had the chance to
hear her. The Voice of America broadcasts to millions _ 130 million
a week by its estimate _ but is prohibited by law from beaming its
broadcasts to America.
   Mrs. Jurey's boss, Sid Davis, relishes telling about an incident
that illustrates the upside-down life of a VOA broadcaster.
   When President Gerald R. Ford went to China in 1975, a huge press
corps accompanied him.
   `You had some of the titans of the broadcasting industry making
the trip _ Barbara Walters, all the top anchor people,'' says Davis.
``We arrived in China and you had all these Chinese people lining
the street ignoring the television stars with their vast audiences
and asking, `Where is Philomena? Where is Philomena?'''
   ``Yes, it's true,'' laughs Mrs. Jurey in an interview. ``The same
thing happened when we went back to China with President Reagan. The
rest of the press corps loved teasing Sam Donaldson about that.
   ``It was fun, because we labor in obscurity here.''
   Even though she has been off the air for 19 months, working as
editor-in-chief of VOA news and English broadcasts, she still gets
mail from around the world.
   Many correspondents want to know what happened to her, why she
disappeared from the radio. Some still write to propose marriage. To
which she replies that at age 61, ``I'm old enough to be a young
grandmother.''
   She says she covered the White House for the Voice the way any
reporter covers the news: ``The adrenalin gets going and you just
report what's going on.''
   One difference: She had to remember to speak slowly for an
audience for whom English is a tricky language and she took had to
take pains to put the news in a context for her listeners.
   When a president submitted a request for foreign aid for some
Third World country, for example, she would stress that Congress
always has the final word on such matters.
   And sometimes it was difficult to get over to a foreign audience
exactly what a president is getting at.
   Mrs. Jurey recalls the struggle she had translating it for her
audience when President Reagan said ``he'd had it up to his keister
with something or other.''
   ``They were good sound bites but you had to use valuable air time
to explain them,'' she says. ``Remember when Reagan said, `Make my
day'?''
   Mrs. Jurey's career started, for $32.50 a week, at the Southwest
Times in Pulaski, Va. She joined the VOA in 1961. Her late husband
was a local broadcaster.
   She was born in New Castle, Pa., the daughter of an Italian
immigrant who owned a restaurant, bar and small hotel.
   The most troubling story she covered for the Voice, she says, was
the Cuban missile crisis. It was so sensitive the government wanted
every shade in VOA broadcasts to be exactly right.
   ``That was a most difficult time,'' she says, her voice still
reflecting irritation. ``We had, in effect, a censor in the
newsroom. Someone from our parent agency scrutinizing the copy. I
can understand that. But I didn't think it was necessary.''
   Mrs. Jurey says she intends to continue writing in retirement.
   After she found no one in America wanted to published her memoirs
_ ``I was told that it wasn't marketable because no one know who I
was,'' she says _ she tried her hand at a book about pizza.
   She wrote about five chapters but couldn't land a publisher for
that manuscript either.
   ``They told me,'' she sighs, ``that people want to eat pizza, not
read about it.''

   President Bush's meeting at the White House
today with embattled Japanese Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu touches
off a post-honeymoon foreign policy phase that will test Bush's
management of America's role in the world.
   His biggest decisions involve dealing with the Soviet Union, but
the issues closing in on Bush also range from the strenuous effort
to oust Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega from power in Panama to the
intractable Arab-Israeli dispute and the collapse of a 19-nation
conference on Cambodia.
   The first seven months in the White House have been relatively
easy ones for Bush. His only near-crisis in foreign policy involved
the American hostages in Lebanon and the slaying of Marine Lt. Col.
William Higgins.
   The hostage problem, which also dogged Presidents Carter and
Reagan, was not solved while Bush was on vacation in Maine. But Bush
isn't faced with threatening execution deadlines.
   However, in the months ahead, Bush will be wrestling with all
sorts of foreign policy questions. For instance, he has to decide
how much money he can find to assist Colombia in its war on drug
lords.
   The president has pledged $65 million, and is preparing a
comprehensive proposal to combat drugs to be announced next week.
But Colombian Justice Minister Monica de Greif has appealed publicly
for another $19 million to protect judges and other targets in her
country.
   The president is sympathetic, but can he dig down for Colombia
and argue at the same time that there's nothing more in the coffers
for Poland beyond the $119 million he promised before Solidarity
captured a power-sharing role in Warsaw and food shortages grew
worse?
   It gets to be a matter of priorities, and Poland's supporters in
Congress and among the American public are eager to have Bush expand
the modest aid he has offered and made conditional on the adoption
of economic reforms.
   Even trickier is the situation in the Baltic republics where
proponents of change are getting a far different reception from
Moscow than Solidarity has received.
   Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev has made Bush's life easier by
accepting the political and economic shifts in Poland. The country
remains committed to the Warsaw Pact while changes in its industrial
and agricultural policies could spare the Soviets some of the costs
of supporting Poland.
   But the Communist party's ruling Politburo is taking a skeptical
view of what it calls ``the virus of nationalism'' in Estonia,
Latvia and Lithuania and has warned of ``urgent measures'' to curb
radical changes in the once-independent republics.
   Asked about this development, Bush said he hoped peaceful change
would continue ``not only outside the Soviet Union, but in it.''
   The remark suggests Bush may take the same approach to the
Baltics as he has to Poland, carefully encouraging change without
saying how far he would like to see it go.
   The visit of Japanese Prime Minister Kaifu involves some touchy
presidential diplomacy as well.
   Bush has to juggle U.S. frustration with Japan's $50 billion
trade surplus against the possibility that pushing Kaifu too hard
might contribute to the downfall of his weak government. That could
pave the way for a left-wing coalition in Tokyo that Bush and his
conservative followers would findasteful.
   The collapse of the Paris conference on Cambodia means bracing
for an intensification of the civil war between go that include
Prince Sihanouk and the Khmer Rouge.
   The Bush administration had hoped the c would produce a
cease-fire and a transition government. Now the options are suddenly
bleak.
   In the Middle East, at some n Bush will have to decide whether
the Palestiniberation Organization can be coaxed into coope an
Israeli plan for elections on the West Bank The president and
Secretary of State James A. Baker III consider the proposal the most
practical way of gettingks started. But a PLO boycott could kill the
plan and that would leave Bush scratching his head for another
approach.
   In Panama, meanwhile, Gen. Noriega continues to outfox the Bush
administration, clinging to power through stand-inand defying all
pressures and stratagems. The term of provisional President Manuel
Solis Palma is expiring. What next?

<HEAD>One Day's Dose of AZT: $1.50 to Make, $9 to Buy</HEAD>

   Five capsules of the AIDS drug AZT, one day's
supply for infected people, contain an estimated 15 cents worth of
ingredients.
   They probably cost between $1.50 and $2.50 to manufactthe
drugstore for $9.
   By any standard, a lifetime of treatment with AZT will add up to
a lot of money. Is dicine really a bargain, as its maker maintains?
   The disagreement highlights the arbitrary, often mysteriou
fashion in which pharmaceutical companies decide how much to chrge
for the medicines they hold exclusive right ``The only thing we know
is there is no objective social way of determining what the price
should be except what the market will bear,'' said Dr. Donald Rucer
of the University of Illinois School of Pharn this case, the market
is likely to grow dramatically.
   AZT, known generically as azidothymidine and sold a the only
approved AIDS drug. Until recently, it was recommended only for the
4with AIDS or severe AIDS-related illness. But new research suggests
that the medicine can also forestall AIDS in people at earlier
stages of infection with HIV, the acquiredimmune deficiency syndrome
virus.
   Federal officials estimate that the drug could become routine
therapy for an additional 600,000 infected people _ those who have
very early symptoms or no signs of the disease at all except for
abnormal blood counts.
   Burroughs Wellcome Co., the only company that makes AZT, sells
the drug for $1.50 per capsule. By the time wholesalers and
drugstores take their markups, the retail price is about $1.80.
   Peopleth AIDS typically take about eight capsules a day, while
five capsules daily are recommended for those with no outward
symptoms. For them, the price is $9 a day, or about $3,300 a year.
SomIDS patients have spent about $8,000 a year taking 12 capsules
ly, a dosage no longer recommended.
   On Wednesday, 15 homosexual rights and AIDS activist
organizations asked Burroughs Wellcome to lower the cost.
   ``Absolutely, it's overpriced,'' sor of the Gay Men's Health
Crisis in New York. ``It's clear that at the current price, there
wll be people who won't be able to afford this drug.''
   Leonard Schifrin, an economist at the College of Wilows the
pharmaceutical industry, said that many drug prices are too high, in
part because companies often have no competition for several years
after they introduce innovative medicines.
   Big profits are a way of life, he said, and maintenance drugs
like AZT, taken daily for years, are especially lucrative.
   re used by large numbers of people with serious problems for lof
time,'' he said. ``That's a gold mine, and I hate to see AZT being
mined as gold. It's a basi problem of monopolistic producers and
helpless consumers.''
   Burroughs Wellcome, spokeswoman Karen Collins satried to price
this drug compassionately.'' Dr. David Barry, the vice president of
research, called AZT ``a bar
   Compared with drugs used for other chronic disorders, AZT is
relatively expensive. For instance, maintena Zantac, the ulcer drug,
and Vasotec, the high blood pressure medicine, both cost patients
about 70 cents a day.
   However, Barry noted that AZT is far cheaper than some new
anti-infection drugs that can cost $50 a day or more, although these
drugs are usually given for weeks at a time, not years.
   Barry said that many factors go into setting drug prices, the
cost of production, the number of patients who will take it, the
need for plant expansion cost of continuing to conduct research on
the medicine.
   Buhe overriding factor is the expense of paying foompany's search
for new treatments and cures, wh million last year.
   ``The successful drugs and the revenues obtained from them must
pay for all of the enoarch we do in basic scientific fields or in
applied fields that fail,'' said Ba ``The biggest element that
determines how much we charge for drugs is the bottom line _ how
much revenue do we need to get to keep our company out of the red
and to sustain our research program.''
   Barry said AZT is difficult to mak23 steps. But the manufacturing
cost is just one relatively minor factor in the price, and ``dbe
like determining the cost of surgery based on the cost of stainless
steel used in scalpels. It makes no sense at all.''
   Still, stock analysts do estimate such costs. Johannah Walton of
Shearson Lehton in London calculates that the raw material for
making AZT, mainly thymidine, costs $300 peruring costs between
$3,000 and $5,000 per kilogram.
   If she is right, this means the ingredients in a single 100
milligram capsule cost 3 cents, and manufacturing the product costs
30 to 50 cents.
   A few months after AZT was introduced in 1987, the company cut
its price 20 percent to the current level.
   Though the company refuses to speculate about further price cuts,
Walton said she expects another 20 percent price reduction within
the next year because of improvements in manufacturing, the growing
number of users and the likelihood that newer drugs will be easier
to make and probably cheaper.
   If the price stays the same, she said, sales of AZT could rise to
$800 million to $900 million in 1992.
   This prediction is based on the assumption that the drug will be
used by 40 percent of all people with serious symptoms of HIV
disease, 25 percent of those with early symptoms and 20 percent of
infected people with no symptoms.

<HEAD>Administration Considering Food Aid to Poland</HEAD>

   Agriculture Secretary Clayton Yeutter says the
Bush administration is considering food aid to Poland, but is
awaiting signals from that country's new government.
   ``It's on the front burner, it'll stay on the front burner over
the next few days until we come to some final decisions,'' Yeutter
said Thursday.
   ``At the moment it's premature to draw any conclusion, partly
because the new government is just getting into place in Poland and
we want to have some signals and some expressions of viewpoint from
that government before we get heavily involved in this , R-Kan.,
said the possibility Poland _ especially food aid _ was discussed by
President Bush and key advisers during a meeting Wednesday at Bush's
vacation home in Kennebunkport, Maine.
   ``There may be additional aid offered,'' Dole said. ``We're
talking of some kind of emergency effort by the United States and
the Western alliance,'' Dole told reporters. ``It's a question of
timing; a question of showing that we're willing to do a little more
than when Poland's government was communist.''
   Dole met with leaders of Poland's Solidarity Uninment officials
during a trip to Eastern Europe last month.
   ``Most of the leaders we talked to were pleading for food aid,''
Dole said, recounting meetings with Solidarity leader Lech Walesa,
Polish President Wojeiech Jaruzelski and Poland's new prime
minister, Tadeusz Mazowiecki ``Meat and butter is what they really
need, at least in the short term,'' Doid. ``The primary thing is
food. They want to fill the shelves. They want to show change. ...
People expect things to be better.''
   During his visit to Warsaw last month, Bush said he would ask
Congresve $100 million in development aid for Poland tontry's
private sector. He said he would ask an additional $15 million to
help improve the environment.
   Dolhat there are only ``vague'' ideas of how additional aid to
Poland would be paid for and that the Agriculture Department is
``looking at options.''
   Yeutter was asked about Bush's promise during last year's
presidential campaign that he would never use food as a political
weapon.
   ``When the president said he would not use food as a political
weapon, he was really referring to the kinds of export embargoes
we've had through the years,'' Yeutter said. ``His desire and
interest trating conclusively to American agriculture that we
wouldn't be following that route during his administration.''
   The most controversial embargo was the one against the Soviet
Union, a partial lid on shipments ordered by President Carter on
Jan. 4, 1980, in retaliation for Soviet aggression in Afghanistan.
Ilifted 16 months later by President Reagan.
   Ultimately, experts decided the U.S. embargo had little or no
effect on the Soviets, who mostly turned to other suppliers for
grain during that period.
   ``Every time we'through agricultural embargoes we've ended up
shooting ourselves in the foot,'' Yeutter said.
   ``It seems tat what we're doing now in the way of positive
actions, whether they be in Poland or anywhere else in the world
through food aalls into an entirely separate category,'' he said.
   If fooan be used as ``a mechanism to deliver positive change'' in
polcal and economic circumstances, that would seem to be a laudabl,
Yeutter said.
   Dole said that while Poland's new leaders need substantial food
aid soon, the country's long-term needs include finding the means to
reduce its long-term foreign debt, which now stands at about $42 bi

   Sex on other planets, fearless vampire killers,
gonzo fantasy and questions such as ``Are There Any Really New
Monsters?'' are among the topics being kicked around at the 47th
World Science Fiction Convention.
   More than 5,000 writers, scientists and fans assembled Thursday
for a long weekend of late night ``filking'' and confabs on the
future of sci-fi, and the word is that cyberpunk is out.
   Enthusiasts from science fiction's fandom began flocking to the
Hynes Convention Center clad in Star Trek uniform tops,
propellor-beanies and T-shirts festooned with buttons.
   ``At its best, fandom is far less discriminatory against people
who are different,'' Andi Schecter, a prominent Boston fan said
during a panel discussion on fandom. ``At its worst, we're a bunch
of nerds.''
   Heated, long-running debates are characteristic of these
conventions, whether they're over the proper rotation of a space
station around a manufactured sun in a novel from the '50s or over
the general worth of filkers, singers who rewrite folk songs with
space-age lyrics.
   This year, the filkers are staying at a different hotel.
   ``At times, fandom has all the dynamics of a fourth-grade
playground,'' Schecter said.
   The conference also features the presentation of the coveted Hugo
awards for outstanding science fiction writing, as well as a brunch
with Isaac Asimov, appearances by authors Andre Norton and Frederik
Pohl and publishers Ian and Betty Ballantine, founders of Bantam
Books and Ballantine Books.
   While fans come to meet old friends and gawk at rare sci-fi books
and paraphernalia such as space-age wigs and tiny, futuristic
acrylic cities, those active in the industry come to make new
connections and find out what next year's hot topics will be.
   Chuq Von Rospach, a Hugo nominee who publishes Other Realms
magazine, said he sees writers tending toward bringing fantastic
events into the real world, rather than setting off for worlds of
fantasy.
   Von Rospach and others also said that cyberpunk _ the
controversial sub-genre that took hackers and the technologies of
the information age into the future, with protaganists physically
entering computer systems through their personal computers _ was
waning in support because it was overused.
   Organizers are looking beyond fantasy. They've invited Marvin
Minsky of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Nobel
laureates Sheldon Glashow and Rosalyn Yalow to deliver papers on
such n and society and artificial intelligence.
   Accurate scientirmation is important to hard sci-fi writers
because ``coming across glaring scientific errors tt Kemper, an army
specialist who took vacation time to come to the convention.
   Jack Butterworth has been attending sci-fi ions for 21 years, and
this year he brought his 12-year-old son ``It's somethto go to meet
old friends, see ad movies and get in on some very, very funny di
things,'' he said. ``Sci-fi fans have their ownn things. They never
look at things quite the same way as others.''
   The Hugo awards _ named in honor of Hugo Gernsback, whblished the
first sci-fi magazine ``Amazing Stories'' in 1926 _
   to be presented Saturday night for the best novel, novella, short
story, non-fiction book and other categories.
   On Saturday morning, the Science Fiction Writers of Ameritioning
off autographed books and sci-fi memorabilia to raise money for
Robert Adams, author of the Horseclans series. He is undergoing
experimental radiation treatment in Gainesville, Fla., for lung
cancer.

<HEAD>FmHA Faces Businesslike Future: Yeutter</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Farm Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Agriculture Secretary Clayton Yeutter says the
Farmers Home Administration faces a more businesslike future than
its past as a ``grant agency'' churning out money for hard-up
farmers.
   ``We've just got to reform that program, take it out of the
status of what it's really become _ a grant agency _ and move it
back to being a credit institution once again,'' Yeutter said
Thursday.
   Yeutter's comments came as thousands of delinquent FmHA borrowers
begin getting notices that they had better start settling accounts
or face the possibility of foreclosure.
   The FmHA has its roots in the Great Depression of the 1930s and
is often called the government's farm lender of last resort. To be
eligible, farmers must be unable to get regular loans from banks or
other commercial institutions.
   Yeutter said the Agriculture Department agency has ``made
billions of dollars of questionable loans over the last decade or
so, many of which are in default today.''
   But he noted that attempts have been made to change FmHA and to
toughen its lending practices, only to be thwarted by legal action
filed by farmers or their advocates, or by Congress.
   ``If we have to change legislation in this area in order to do a
more effective and skillful job of managing (FmHA), we'll make
legislative proposals to have that happen,'' Yeutter told a
television news conference. ``If we can do it administratively ...
we'll do it that way.''
   For years, the FmHA has been embroiled in controversial attempts
to collect long-overdue farm loans. New procedures to help protect
the interests of farmers and to enable the agency to proceed with
its collections were included by Congress in the Agricultural Credit
Act of 1987.
   The latest move involves FmHA sending out a new batch of
collection notices to borrowers who failed to make their scheduled
payments by the first of this year.
   The total owed FmHA by all delinquent borrowers is about $8.7
billion, although there is no breakdown showing how much the 1989
notices involve, said agency spokesman Marlyn Aycock.
   The FmHA's county offices were told to mail out the collection
notices by Aug. 25 so delinquent borrowers could have them by Sept.
1, Aycock said.
   The county offices were sent lists of delinquents totaling 13,217
borrowers as of Aug. 1 and were instructed to delete names of those
who had settled their accounts.
   Aycock said those deletions could reduce the list to between
11,000 and 12,000 names by the time they were mailed out last week.
   ``But we won't get an actual count until farther down the road,''
he said.
   The list of delinquencies has shrunk dramatically since Jan. 1
when it was more than 30,000 borrowers, he said. By July 3 it was
down to 15,704 names, and the Aug. 1 count dropped to 13,217 _ the
basic list sent to county offices.
   Borrowers will have 45 days from receipt of the notices to return
forms to FmHA describing how they want to settle their overdue
accounts. The 1987 law requires the agency to tell farmers they have
certain options, including reamortization or rescheduling, payment
deferral, reduced interest rates and, in some cases, debt
forgiveness.
   If farmers don't respond, or if a borrower is in such poor
financial shape that no alternative can be worked out, forced sale
or foreclosure proceedings could begin.
   Aycock said the latest notices are in addition to more than
66,000 sent last fall to delinquent borrowers, many of whom had not
made payments for three years or more.

   A sharp drop in soybean prices helped trigger a
1.4 percent decline in the prices farmers got for raw products last
month, says the Agriculture Department.
   Overall, commodity prices at the farm level averaged the same as
they did in August 1988.
   The department's Agricultural Statistics Board said Thursday in
its preliminary report that lower prices for soybeans, corn, lettuce
and potatoes were mostly responsible for the decrease from the July
average.
   Higher prices for cattle, apples, eggs and grapefruit partly
offset the decline for the other commodities.
   Oilseeds, which include soybeans, and feed grain prices showed
the greatest month-to-month decline, while meat animals and milk had
the largest increases.
   ``A 90-cents-per-bushel decline in the price of soybeans from
July to August was the largest month-to-month decline since
June-July 1984,'' the report said. ``Corn and sorghum prices were
down but the average barley price was up.''
   Wheat prices moved up after four months of small declines. Hogs
and beef cattle were up from July, but calf prices were down
slightly.
   Agriculture Secretary Clayton Yeutter said earlier Thursday that
he expects 1989 will be ``a good year'' for farmers, although there
is ``a mixed situation across the country'' because of drought and
other weather problems.
   ``I would guess net cash income (nationally) would be slightly
below 1988, but not very much below,'' he said. Crop production
generally has rebounded from last year's drought-reduced yields and
exports are up.
   ``Overall, I'd say farmers feel a lot better,'' Yeutter said.
   Based on the preliminary figures, the price index for livestock
and livestock products as a group increased 1.6 percent from July to
August and averaged 5.3 percent more than the year-earlier level.
   Crop prices, overall, dropped 4.5 percent from July and averaged
5.9 percent less than in August 1988.
   The overall index of prices paid to farmers in July averaged 144
percent of a 1977 base used for comparison, down from 146 percent in
July. That was the lowest reading since November when the index was
also 144 percent.

<HEAD>Young Fire Victim's Notes Yield Clues to Blaze That Killed 10</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: Also in Friday AMs report.</HEAD>

   Investigators studying the cause of a New
Year's Day house fire that killed 10 had an unusual piece of
evidence: a journal kept by one of the victims, a 9-year-old girl.
   Kimberly Smischney of Bemidji, described by her teacher as a
child who loved to write, recorded in her journal how spooky it was
that the lights at her cousins' home in Remer often flickered and
popped.
   Her notes helped the fire marshal's office determine that
electrical problems may have caused the blaze.
   ``She wrote many times about the house in Remer because she loved
it. She loved going down there,'' said Arlane Mullranin, Kimberly's
third-grade teacher at Horace May Elementary School.
   Killed in the fire at the converted schoolhouse were Kimberly,
her mother, father and 10-year-old brother, her four cousins and two
neighbor children. Remer, a town of 400, is about 55 miles from
Bemidji.
   The blaze occurred during a holiday gathering at the home of
Kimberly's aunt and uncle, who were out celebrating the aunt's 32nd
birthday when the fire broke out.
   Mrs. Mullranin said Thursday that Kimberly kept the journal as
part of a class project.
   ``Most 8- or 9-year-olds don't like to write, but Kimberly was a
writer,'' she said. ``She just felt she was born to be a writer or a
singer.''
   Children that age, Mrs. Mullranin said, ``enjoy things that are a
little bit strange or spooky. And the house was spooky.''
   ``When I first read them I just commented back, `Isn't this a
funny house,''' she said. ``Later, it made more sense to me.''
   After the fire, the teacher gave copies of pages from Kimberly's
journal to the fire marshal's office.
   ``I felt that possibly Kim could help to solve the mystery and
that I could do something, too,'' Mrs. Mullranin said.
   The cause of the blaze could not definitively be determined,
David Bahma, a deputy state fire marshal, said in his final report,
dated Jan. 5.
   But after ruling out the structure's wood furnace and oil space
heater, he concluded that the blaze was accidental and could have
been started by careless smoking or electrical problems. In his
report, Bahma noted references in Kimberly's journal to ``unusual
electrical occurrences'' at the house.
   In one entry, Kimberly wrote that a light burned out when it was
turned on in a bedroom, Mrs. Mullranin said.
   ``I went to Remer and the first day Saturday night I was going to
sleep near my cousins Eddie and Tigger and Jay (her brother). Well I
sat down to quiet the boys down. I laid back down and my pillow was
gone!'' Kimberly wrote.
   ``Tigger turned on the light to look for it, and the light burned
out. Sam, my other cousin, turned on the bathroom light and it went
out too. I was so scared. I found my pillow.''
   Two weeks later, Kimberly wrote, the lights went out in the house
while others remained on in town.
   ``I went to Remer Saturday and there was a blackout. We had a
couple little ones before the big one,'' Kimberly wrote. ``We had to
get out a lot of candles. We had to close off the upstairs so it
would stay warm. I had almost dropped, in fact I did drop, a candle,
but it went out. I was scared when I dropped the candle.''

<HEAD>Moore Says Ethics Ruling is New Blow to Yucca Mountain Project</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT BURNS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A judge's ruling that an Energy Department
administrator committed an ethics violation will hurt the government
as it tries to revitalize its nuclear waste management program, the
agency's deputy secretary says.
   ``Of course it's a setback,'' Henson Moore said in a telephone
interview Thursday after the ethics finding was disclosed.
   U.S. Claims Court Judge Reginald Gibson found that Samuel Rousso,
acting director of the waste management office, violated a
conflict-of-interest law by helping award a $1 billion contract to a
group of companies that included one of his former employers.
   Moore said he was concerned that the ethics charge was another
blow to the department's credibility, which has been hurt in recent
years by a series of project failures. He suggested the blame should
be put on the Reagan administration.
   ``We're still seeing the fallout of things that happened before
we got here,'' he said.
   The 10-year contract in question calls for managing and
integrating the work of other contractors at the Yucca Mountain,
Nev., site where the department is trying to determine the
suitability of building an underground repository for nuclear waste.
   Gibson's finding was part of a broader ruling, released in
summary form last week, in which the judge blocked the Energy
Department from awarding the contract to Bechtel Management System
Inc., as Rousso and other department officials had recommended in
December.
   Among Bechtel's partners in the bid was Science Applications
International Corp., a San Diego-based engineering and consulting
company where Rousso worked from October 1985 to May 1986.
   The judge said the department could give the contract to no one
but TRW Inc., an unsuccessful bidder that sued the department on
grounds that Rousso's key role in the bid evaluation process had
biased the outcome in Bechtel's favor.
   Moore, the No. 2 Energy Department official, said the department
had not decided whether to appeal Gibson's ruling. He said senior
department officials would take a lengthy look at the situation,
which could lead to major changes in the Yucca Mountain project.
   Rousso joined the Energy Department in June 1986 _ one month
after leaving Science Applications _ and immediately became involved
in preparing for the Yucca Mountain bidding process. He was chairman
of a department panel that studied the various Yucca Mountain
contract bids and recommended Dec. 2 that the Bechtel team be chosen.
   Gibson said Rousso violated a federal ethics statute that
prohibits an Energy Department supervisor from participating in
department decisions involving any energy company that the
supervisor has worked for within the past year.
   Rousso declined to comment on the decision in a brief telephone
conversation Thursday. In an interview with The Associated Press
earlier this week, he said he had acted in good faith and believed
no conflict of interest had been shown.
   The conflict-of-interest statute at issue allows for civil
penalties of up to $10,000 for each violation, to be imposed by the
department head or a federal court.
   Agency spokesman Phil Keif said he didn't know whether the
department was considering seeking civil penalties against Rousso.

<HEAD>Federal Reserve Bank Releases Report on Minority Mortgage Lending</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DANA KENNEDY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The number of mortgage loans issued in the city's
black neighborhoods is disproportionately lower than in white
neighborhoods, the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston reported.
   ``This unfortunate pattern persists even after taking into
account economic and non-racial characteristics that could be
responsible for differences between these neighborhoods,'' said the
report issued Thursday.
   The report stopped short of identifying the problem as redlining,
a practice by which lenders systematically discriminate against
minority neighborhoods.
   ``It's suggesting that there may be other factors, like
insufficient outreach to minority neighborhoods, that contribute to
this,'' said Herb Wass, a spokesman for the Federal Reserve Bank.
``There just isn't sufficient data to find out if it's all the
lenders' fault.''
   Gov. Michael S. Dukakis ordered two state Cabinet members to
review the report and ``to use every means at our disposal to ensure
that every citizen has the opportunity to own a home regardless of
race or national origin.''
   The report said that because the number of mortgages are
vulnerable to ups and downs in the housing market as well as the
credit market, ``it is difficult to disentangle the role played by
lenders, as opposed to buyers, sellers, developers and others, in
causing this disparity between black and white neighborhoods.''
   But the report stated flatly that Boston financial institutions
are ``functioning in a way that hurts black neighborhoods.''
   The report suggested that banks and thrifts should ``lead the
way'' in correcting the problem by re-evaluating their lending
practices and changing the way they market their services and check
credit needs.
   ``I think it points up some crying needs in the city,'' said
Robert Sheridan, president of the Massachusetts Banking Association.
``The message here is that the banking industry must move forward
and I see it as a fair challenge.''
   The report was based on the analysis of about 48,000 real estate
transactions from 1982 to 1987 in Boston's 60 neighborhoods.
   As a result of reports about redlining in Atlanta, New York,
Detroit, Dallas and other cities over the past two years, civil
rights and community activists have continually demanded the release
to the public of numerical ratings the government keeps on community
lending.
   The savings and loan bailout bill approved by the House in June
discourages redlining by requiring that lenders disclose both the
number of loans they approve as well as the number of applications
they get by race, income and sex.

<HEAD>Drug Plan to Cost $7.8 Billion; Some Parts Secret</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BRYNA BRENNAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The White House is putting a $7.8 billion price
tag on its new drug strategy but intends to withhold from the
American public details about 30 percent of the plan, according to
an administration source.
   Speaking on the condition of anonymity, the source said Thursday
the government plans to keep secret classified sections outlining
intelligence operations and detailing how it far it will go in
pursuing drug traffickers.
   White House chief of staff John Sununu said Thursday in
Kennebunkport, Maine, that assembling the $7.8 billion could involve
shifting money from other programs. President Bush is scheduled to
announce the new policy in a nationally televised speech Tuesday
night.
   ``You don't want the narco-traffickers to know what the limits
are,'' the source said. ``We can't let them know how far we would go
before retaliation or how far before we pump more money in.''
   The document draws from suggestions submitted by several federal
agencies to drug czar William Bennett.
   It has been learned the strategy will call for more penalties
against users, stepped-up law enforcement and expanded treatment
programs. Up to $260 million in economic and military aid will be
sent to Colombia, Bolivia and Peru to stop cocaine at its South
American origin, sources said.
   The Pentagon announced Thursday that the first shipments in a $65
million emergency aid package for Colombia are scheduled to leave
Sunday. A final list of supplies still is being drafted, but
Pentagon spokesman Pete Williams said two C-130 B medium range cargo
planes will ferry the initial supplies.
   President Bush, on vacation in Maine, said any international
effort to aid Colombia in its war on drugs ``would be useful.''
   The administration source said Bush will reveal as much of the
drug strategy as he can without compromising operations against
traffickers.
   ``The idea is to tell as much as possible to the people,'' the
source said, ``but it is obvious we can't tell all.''
   Sections of the plan that will remain classified deal with
precise areas of drug operations and strength of U.S. anti-drug
forces overseas, the source said. Some portions dealing with
strategies at home also will remain under wraps.
   Also to be kept secret are which third-party countries give
information to the United States, the source said. The U.S.
intelligence community frequently relies on its allies to pass on
secret data.
   The plan attempts to lay to rest bureaucratic infighting among
various agencies in the drug war. Sources say it calls for an
increased role for the military. More U.S. troops will be committed
to advising and training overseas forces. But the plan stops short
of calling for direct U.S. military intervention.
   The strategy, according to sources, delineates the overseas
operations of the Drug Enforcement Administration, the State
Department, which runs drug eradication programs, and the CIA, which
gathers intelligence data.
   The CIA set up a Counter Narcotics Center in April to ``combine
operational and analytical support to our country's fight against
international drug trafficking,'' according to spokesman Bill Devine.
   He said the plan is to unite the entire intelligence community _
the Federal Bureau of Investigation, Defense Intelligence Agency,
the National Security Agency, Customs and the DEA, along with the
CIA _ in that effort.
   Attempts to stop the cocaine flow into the United States by
working directly in South America were all but stopped earlier this
year by security threats to American personnel from leftist
guerrillas in Colombia and Peru and insufficient guidelines and
cooperation among U.S. agencies.
   At home, the plan envisions a crackdown on drug users, calling
for a program that would allow judges to strip student loans and
other federal benefits from offenders.
   A draft of the strategy, leaked to the media in July, called for
a 49 percent increase in treatment funds _ $925 million in fiscal
1990 compared with $621 million this year _ and $1.2 billion for new
prisons, a 28 percent increase over this year.

   The typical American killed by heart disease is an
elderly man with high blood pressure who does not have much money
and relies on Medicare to pay most of his medical bills, federal
researchers say.
   The statistical portrait was based on 6,665 heart disease victims
in 1986. Heart disease, the leading cause of death in the United
States, killed about 765,000 people in 1986.
   The typical victim wasn't working, had been hospitalized in the
year before dying and had assets of less than $50,000, researchers
with the National Center for Health Statistics said.
   The survey was reported in Thursday's weekly report of the
Centers for Disease Control, the NCHS's parent agency. It is hoped
that the findings will prove helpful in ``addressing the health-care
needs of those with chronic disease,'' the Atlanta-based CDC said.
   Among the key findings:
   _52 percent of those who died from heart disease in 1986 were
male.
   _81 percent were 65 or older, including 26 percent who were 85 or
older. Women were older than men, probably contributing to the
finding that 65 percent of the female victims were widowed. Of the
men, 19 percent were widowers.
   _87 percent of heart disease victims were not employed at the
time of their death. For women, the figure was 95 percent.
   _54 percent had high blood pressure, 27 percent had suffered
strokes, 23 percent had angina and 21 percent were diabetic.
   _75 percent had been hospitalized or placed in a nursing home in
the year before they died.
   _35 percent received help from others in performing basic tasks,
such as walking, eating and dressing.
   _The most common family-income bracket was between $9,000 and
$24,999, reported by 38 percent; 82 percent had family income under
$25,000.
   _70 percent had less than $50,000 in assets at the end of their
lives; 19 percent had nothing, and another 20 percent had less than
$5,000.
   _51 percent used Medicare as their chief source of funds for
health care; only 13 percent resorted chiefly to their own money or
that of their families.
   _86 percent spent less than $5,000 of their own money for health
care in the year before death; 44 percent spent less than $500 of
their own.
   The study was prepared through interviews with next of kin or
others familiar with the patient's life.
   NCHS plans similar studies examining other causes of death.

   A new wave of narcotics with names such as
``croak,'' ``moon rock'' and ``parachute'' is hitting the nation's
streets along with a smokable form of heroin, authorities say.
   ``The drug cartels, like any successful marketers of a product,
are constantly working on new and improved models of their wares,''
Sen. Joseph Biden, D-Del., said Thursday.
   ``Their innovation means more death and devastation for our
cities.''
   Methamphetamines, commonly called ``crank,'' as well as a mixture
of crack cocaine and heroin known as ``parachute,'' are among forms
of narcotics that could take root in the decade ahead, authorities
told a hearing of Biden's Senate Judiciary Committee.
   Also on the horizon are ``croak,'' a mixture of crack and
cocaine, and basuco, a cocaine derivative, authorities said. They
said users already are able to buy a synthetic form of heroin known
as ``P-funk.''
   Mixing crack and heroin staves off the suicidal depression, or
``crash,'' crack users feel soon after the burst of euphoria caused
by the drug, said Dr. Walter Faggett, substance abuse services
director at D.C. General Hospital.
   Heroin remains in wide use but is being sold in new forms, said
William Hopkins, director of street research for the New York State
division of substance abuse services.
   One is called ``his,'' or heroin in a straw. The powder is tapped
into the straw and the ends heat-sealed, Hopkins said.
   Pushers, he said, have taken to handing out business cards
stating the street corner where they can be found. The cards
sometimes contain partial phone numbers. ``At the last minute, they
add two digits,'' he testified.
   That makes it easy to shop by phone.
   ``You can order drugs and a kid will deliver them to you on a
bicycle,'' he said.
   Irate citizens are at times able to clear street corners of
pushers by holding anti-drug rallies, Hopkins said. But then
``steerers'' appear to herd addicts to corners a few blocks away
were sales are in progress, he said.
   Heroin is found in increasingly purer forms, Hopkins said.
   Young addicts are increasingly blending heroin and cocaine, he
said.
   ``Some of these young users shoot, some of them snort and some of
them smoke,'' he said. ``Some smoke it on joints, some smoke it on
tobacco, some smoke it on aluminum foil.''
   The drugs are burned on the foil while the users ``put a straw in
their nose and chase the fumes around the room,'' he said.
   David G. Binney, chief of the FBI's drug section, told the
committee that Chinese gangs have been active in importing heroin
from Burma, Thailand and Laos through West Coast ports in the United
States and Canada.
   Heroin production, primarily from the Mideast, Asia and Mexico,
appears to have doubled since 1985 and the evidence ``clearly
indicates that an increase of smokable heroin is on the horizon,''
he said.

   Between 420 and 520 people may die in traffic
accidents on the nation's roadways during the Labor Day holiday
weekend, National Safety Council officials say.
   Millions are expected to take to the road during the three-day
holiday, which traditionally marks summer's end.
   The council marks the weekend beginning at 6 p.m. local time
Friday and ending at 11:59 p.m. Monday.
   The projection for this year's Labor Day weekend compares with
422 traffic fatalities recorded over the holiday period in 1988,
said council spokeswoman Gail Mansfield.
   The highest toll for the holiday weekend was logged in 1968, when
688 people died in roadway accidents. The lowest Labor Day toll was
407 in 1975, the year after the maximum speed limit was lowered to
55 mph.

<HEAD>Curbs Won't Affect Major Source of Benzene Pollution: Cars</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By H. JOSEF HEBERT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Tighter controls are expected to sharply reduce
releases by industry of the cancer-causing chemical benzene, but
federal officials acknowledge the curbs won't affect the biggest
offender: the automobile.
   Industrial releases account for about 20 percent of all benzene
releases in the country, said Jack Farmer, director of the
Environmental Protection Agency's air emissions standard division.
   Most of the other emissions come from automobiles, although small
amounts also are found in cigarette smoke and various consumer
products.
   Benzene, a flammable, colorless and odorless liquid, escapes into
the air after evaporating either through various industrial
processes or from the automobile as the engine heats.
   Chronic exposure to benzene has been found to cause adult
leukemia, birth defects and other ailments.
   The EPA announced Thursday that it would impose new emission
control requirements on industry aimed at cutting by 90 percent the
more than 40,000 tons of industrial benzene released into the air
each year.
   Most affected will be the steel and petroleum industries, which
will have to install nearly $1 billion in emission-control equipment
at coke production plants as well as at gasoline storage,
distribution and marketing facilities.
   The EPA listed benzene as a hazardous air pollutant in 1977.
   The curbs on industrial benzene pollution were seen as a
significant step coming after a dozen years of debate, but EPA
officials acknowledged the rules address only a relatively small
percentage of the benzene spewed into the air each year.
   While the rules were expected to cut emissions in the steel
industry by 97 percent and in the petroleum industry about 65
percent, they don't address releases when gasoline is pumped into a
car or emissions during the vehicle's operation, officials said.
   However, William Rosenberg, assistant EPA administrator for air
and radiation, said the agency will propose separate regulations
next month aimed at dealing with toxic vapor releases from
automobiles as engines become hot.
   In addition to requiring changes in the composition of gasoline
to reduce vapor releases, Rosenberg said the agency will consider
requiring auto manufacturers to install additional equipment to
capture vapor emissions, including benzene releases.
   Clean air legislation before Congress includes provisions aimed
at reducing the release of toxic chemicals _ including benzene _
from motor vehicles both through tailpipe exhausts and vapor losses
from the engine and fuel systems.
   The EPA estimated overall costs for the new regulations on
industrial benzene pollution were at about $1.3 billion for initial
installation of equipment, with another $200 million annual cost for
maintenance and operation of the new equipment.
   ``These will be costly, but feasible controls,'' said F. Henry
Habicht, deputy EPA administrator, adding that they ``will protect
public health from the risks associated with industrial benzene
exposure.''
   Habicht said the emission reductions are designed to reduce the
chance of a person eventually getting cancer as a result of benzene
exposure to less than one in 1 million when considering the entire
population.
   The risk are higher _ perhaps as much as one in 10,000 _ for
people that live near industrial plants or facilities where there
continue to be high amounts of benzene, Habicht said.

<HEAD>Houston City Councilman Announces Bid for Leland's Seat</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HOUSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The race to fill the the late U.S. Rep. Mickey
Leland's seat intensified with a Houston city councilman adding his
name to the list of candidates.
   Councilman Anthony Hall will be vying for the seat against state
Sen. Craig Washington and state Rep. Al Edwards, who announced their
candidacies for the 18th Congressional District last week. Hall, who
announced his candidacy Thursday, lost to Leland for the same seat
in 1978.
   Gov. Bill Clements set the special election for Nov. 7, the same
day as Houston's city elections. Hall will have to resign his
position as councilman at large to run for Congress.
   Earlier this week, Leland's widow, Alison, citing her family as
her primary concern, said she would not seek her late husband's job.
Mrs. Leland said she would support Houston City Councilman Rodney
Ellis, who has yet to announce his election plans.
   Leland and 15 others were killed Aug. 7 in a plane crash in
Ethiopia while on a hunger relief mission to a refugee camp.

<HEAD>Mayor Calls New Allegations `Character Assassination'</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICHARD KEIL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Mayor Marion Barry is calling new allegations
that he has used drugs part of a campaign by federal officials to
malign his character.
   Barry reacted angrily to news reports Thursday that a convicted
drug dealer who faces additional charges in the nation's capital has
told authorities that he and the mayor used drugs together.
   ``Through leaks to the press and other sources, federal
authorities have done what they set out to do _ to get headlines and
to assassinate my character,'' Barry said in a statement read by his
staff director, Maudine Cooper. ``This is lawlessness by the
government.''
   The mayor was vacationing in Rehobeth Beach, Del., and could not
be reached to comment beyond his prepared statement.
   U.S. Attorney Jay B. Stephens would not say whether Charles
Lewis, the drug suspect, has implicated Barry in interrogations by
federal agents. But Stephens said he wants the Justice Department to
investigate whether stories about Lewis' cooperation originated with
law enforcement officials.
   Lewis has been charged with perjury, cocaine possession and
trafficking in a federal probe that began last December, when
district police inexplicably called off an undercover attempt to
make a drug buy from him after learning that Barry was in Lewis'
hotel room.
   Lewis was convicted on drug charges in the Virgin Islands earlier
this year. Sentencing on that conviction has been postponed
indefinitely.
   For the past several years Barry has been dogged by persistent
rumors that he uses drugs. In his statement Thursday, he repeated
his declaration that he never saw or used drugs during at least six
visits to Lewis' hotel room.
   Despite those denials, top city officials said the newest rumors
about Barry's alleged drug use are harming his bid for re-election.
   ``I was up until 3 a.m. talking to some prior supporters about
this,'' said one top Barry aide, who asked not to be identified. ``A
number of these people say he just can't run for mayor, and they
won't support him.''
   Said another aide, ``All eight people I talked to this morning
said they would not back him. Some of these people were tireless
volunteers, others had been major contributors.''
   Barry is among four people who have announced their candidacies
for the Democratic mayoral nomination. And the Rev. Jesse Jackson,
who has moved to Washington, has failed to completely discount
rumors that he also will run.
   The mayor was scheduled to unveil district drug czar Sterling
Tucker's new anti-drug strategy Friday, but three top city sources
said Barry had scuttled that plan. Cooper said Barry would not
return to work until next Tuesday.

<TEXT>
   Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega has three yachts,
three Lear jets, a farm in France and a $600,000 mansion in Panama
City, Deputy Secretary of State Lawrence Eagleburger says.
   Speaking Thursday to the Organization of American States,
Eagleburger detailed what he described as Noriega's personal assets.
He estimated Noriega's fortune at between $200 million and $300
million.
   The Panama City mansion contains nearly 50 valuable oil
paintings, and Noriega also has a chalet near a Panamanian air strip
in Rio Hato, Eagleburger said.
   Noriega also owns a vacation home on Madden Lake, Panama, a
mountain retreat and several houses on 60 acres in Chiriqui
Province, Eagleburger said. The French farm is about 50 minutes from
Paris, and Noriega also has a luxury apartment in an elite section
of Paris, the U.S. official said.
   Noriega's wife bought furniture, art objects and antiques valued
in the millions of dollars for several luxury apartments he owns in
the Dominican Republic, Eagleburger said.
   He owns various aircraft, including three Lear jets and a
twin-engine plane. Eagleburger said Noriega bought a sophisticated
helicopter for his personal use for $2 million in 1984, and that a
$2.2 million Boeing 727 was used for money laundering.
   Noriega's three large pleasure yachts are called ``the Macho I,
Macho II and Macho III,'' Eagleburger said.
   In December 1987, Eagleburger said, Noriega decorated himself
with an $85,000 ``Eagle Medal,'' made of gold and precious stones.
   Eagleburger also told the OAS that one of Noriega's daughter's
reportedly spent $50,000 in a one-day shopping spree in New York.
The Noriega family ran up tens of thousands of dollars in charges at
the Helmsley Palace in New York, he said.

<HEAD>Agencies Launch Global Change Research Program</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RANDOLPH E. SCHMID</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A collection of federal agencies is beginning a
decade-long, multimillion dollar investigation into changes faced by
Planet Earth.
   ``Evidence is increasing on the scientific table that change is
occurring,'' said Bob Corell of the National Science Foundation,
adding that both natural and human-induced changes could have a
broad impact on the future.
   A host of agencies have joined in the 2-year-old federal
Committee on Earth Science to set up the research ``to monitor,
understand and, ultimately, predict global change,'' said Robert
Post of the Office of Science and Technology Policy.
   ``Global change is a large, complex scientific problem and it
still is not largely understood,'' committee Chairman Dallas Peck,
head of the U.S. Geological Survey, said at a Thursday news
conference.
   ``There is a shared, common purpose _ to go understand global
change,'' said NASA's Dixon Butler.
   Peck described the coming fiscal year as largely a planning
period to be used setting up research programs likely to last a
decade or more.
   The atmosphere and the role of clouds received top priority, with
Michael Hall of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration
explaining that clouds are a major factor in the feared rise in
global temperatures. Their effect is not well understood, he said.
   The widely discussed threat of global warming, however, is only
part of the overall research effort that includes studies of threats
to the earth's protective ozone layer, possible changes in the
oceans and atmosphere, air pollution and acid rain.
   The most attention has been paid recently to the reports of
warmer temperatures, with some scientists concerned that the carbon
dioxide and other gases added to the atmosphere by human activities
will increase temperatures and cause disruptive climate change.
   This so-called greenhouse effect is disputed by other scientists,
however, and evidence is lacking on both sides. That is an area the
researchers hope to tackle early.
   Funds totaling $191.5 million for fiscal 1990 are included in the
budgets of various departments to get the program under way.
   The seven major areas of research set forth in the committee plan
are:
   _Climate and hydrologic systems. The role of clouds is the first
item on the agenda, followed by research in ocean circulation, links
between the air, land and water and their interactions.
   _Biogeochemical dynamics, such things as the relationship between
living organisms and the water and atmosphere. For example, trees
take carbon dioxide out of the air and replace it with oxygen, and
cutting down trees will reduce that activity.
   _Ecological systems and dynamics, which covers how people, plants
and animals would react to climate change and how their reactions
might in turn affect other processes.
   _Earth system history will look into what has happened to the
land, air and water when climate has changed in the past.
   _Human interactions will examine population growth and
development, energy and land use and industrial production and how
those activities affect the earth.
   _Solid earth research will include research on coastal erosion,
volcanoes and their effect on climate, permafrost, the sea floor and
other areas.
   _Solar influences studies will include monitoring the incoming
radiation from the sun, the amount reflected into space and how that
energy affects the earth and its climate.
   In addition to the Geological Survey, Science Foundation, Office
of Technology Policy, NASA and NOAA, other agencies participating in
the program are the State Department, Environmental Protection
Agency, Departments of Transportation, Agriculture and Defense,
Council on Environmental Quality.

   The dollar surged against the Japanese yen Friday,
while share prices on the Tokyo Stock Exchange fell moderately.
   The dollar closed at 145.45 yen, up 1.17 yen from Thursday's
close. After opening at 144.95 yen, the dollar ranged between 144.80
yen and 145.58 yen.
   The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues lost 82.98
points, or 0.24 percent, closing the week at 34,348.22. It lost
40.46 points Thursday.
   Currency dealers said the dollar's firmness followed its sharp
Wednesday afternoon rally in New York, sparked by speculation that
the U.S. Treasury Department was allowing the dollar's rise as long
as the American economy remains stable.
   ``It was mere speculation, but it worked'' to affect the exchange
market, said a dealer with the Bank of Tokyo, who spoke anonymously.
   The dealer said the bullish sentiment for the dollar ``still
remains in the market.''
   He said the dollar has been relatively stable since Monday's
report that the U.S. merchandise trade deficit declined to $27.7
billion in the second quarter, down from $28.4 billion in the first
quarter.
   On the stock market, the Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected
issues, which shed 215.99 points Wednesday, gained 33.13 points, or
0.09 percent, shortly after the market opened to move to 34,504.79.

<NOTE>Legion Says 1 Million Sign Flag Desecration Petition</NOTE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The American Legion said it has received a
petition containing 1 million signatures that seeks a constitutional
amendment against desecration of the American flag.
   Senate Republican Leader Robert Dole of Kansas said Thursday at a
press conference with American Legion National Commander H.F. Gierke
that legislation calling for the amendment has been scheduled for
action on the Senate floor Oct. 16.
   The House will consider a bill Sept. 12 that would create a
federal law against flag desecration, but not amend the Constitution.
   ``It's a long process,'' Dole said of the amendment route, which
requires approval by two-thirds of the House and Senate and
ratification by three-fourths of the states.
   Gierke said the legion has been getting about 40,000 signatures a
day in its ongoing nationwide petition drive.
   Earlier this year, the Supreme Court touched off the controversy
by deciding that burning the flag was a constitutionally protected
form of political protest.

<NOTE>Tax Penalties for Benefits Discrimination Delayed</NOTE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Internal Revenue Service has delayed for
two months implementation of a tax rule that encourages companies to
provide health and life insurance benefits to all their workers.
   The new deadline for implementing the so-called Section 89 rules
is Dec. 1, the IRS said Thursday.
   Legislation enacted in 1986 requires employers to demonstrate
that health and accident plans and group life insurance do not favor
higher-paid workers. The original deadline of Jan. 1, 1989, had been
delayed until Oct. 1.
   Business groups have lobbied to have the rule dropped altogether,
arguing that it is so complex, costly and time consuming that it
will drive some small companies out of business.
   They claim the rule is having the opposite effect intended
because companies are dropping benefits rather than extend them to
all workers.
   Several measures affecting Section 89 are pending in Congress.

<NOTE>New Hearing Set for Poindexter in Iran-Contra Case</NOTE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A hearing will be held next week to determine
whether Iran-Contra figure John M. Poindexter may introduce evidence
that covert aid to Nicaraguan rebels was legal.
   A federal judge Thursday scheduled a Sept. 6 hearing to discuss
whether there was valid evidence that the former national security
adviser could use to defend the charge that he obstructed
congressional inquiries into whether National Security Council aide
Oliver L. North was secretly helping arm the Nicaraguan Contras.
   Poindexter is accused of obstructing Congress in August 1986 by
assuring three House committees that the National Security Council
was observing ``the spirit as well as the letter'' of a ban on U.S.
military assistance to the anti-Sandinista rebels.
   U.S. District Judge Harold Greene said he wanted to determine if
Poindexter should be given a chance to prove he had no motive to
conceal North's activities by showing they were ``legal, authorized,
or known throughout the government.''
   At issue is whether any knowledge of the activities by President
Reagan or other government officials could be presented as evidence
that Poindexter thought the National Security Council was following
the law.

<HEAD>Los Angeles Times Names David Laventhol Publisher, CEO</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Times Mirror Corp. President David Laventhol
has been named publisher and chief executive officer of the media
company's flagship newspaper, the Los Angeles Times.
   Laventhol will replace W. Thomas Johnson Jr., who has been
publisher of the newspaper for nine years, said Robert F. Erburu,
chairman and chief executive officer of Times Mirror.
   With Laventhol's appointment, Erburu said Johnson will ``assume
new companywide responsibilities,'' including chairmanship of the
Times Mirror newspaper management committee, a policymaking group
that shapes the company's strategies in newspaper publishing.
   ``To be publisher of the Los Angeles Times is to be at the center
of the most exciting journalistic enterprise in the country,''
Laventhol said after the announcement Thursday. ``I am happy to have
this opportunity, and I'm grateful to Tom Johnson for leading the
Times through nine years of growth and editorial excellence.
   ``I look forward to working with the men and women of the Times
to produce an even better newspaper.''
   Johnson, speaking to the newspaper's executives, said: ``Things
are going so well here _ circulation is going up, profits are going
up, a new plant is going up _ that Bob Erburu thought I should be
going up as well. And I am, up to the sixth floor of Times Mirror.
   ``After 12 wonderful years _ three as president, nine as
publisher of the Times, it is now time for a change.''
   The newspaper's revenues during the past 12 years grew from $333
million to more than $1 billion. Circulation increased to 1.12
million daily from 1 million and to 1.43 million Sunday from 1.29
million.
   The paper won eight Pulitzer prizes in the last 12 years.
   Laventhol, 55, has been president of Times Mirror since 1987 and
will continue in that position. Laventhol was editor of Newsday, a
daily the company owns on New York's Long Island, from 1970 to 1978
and served as publisher of Newsday from 1978 to 1987.
   Laventhol previously worked at The Washington Post.
   Johnson, 47, will continue to serve as vice chairman of Times
Mirror, will oversee joint marketing efforts of the company's
newspapers and other media operations and will be involved in
acquisition of additional operations.
   Times Mirror also publishes The Sun in Baltimore, The Morning
Call in Allentown, Pa., and three Connecticut newspapers: The
Hartford Courant, The Advocate (of Stamford) and Greenwich Time.

<HEAD>Report: Government To Consider Mandela's Release After Next Week's
Elections</HEAD>
<DATELINE>JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government will consider
freeing Nelson Mandela after next week's elections and the
anti-apartheid leader won't have to renounce violence to get out of
prison, a newspaper reported.
   ``We are not wedded to the demand that he should distance himself
from violence before he is released,'' Justice Minister Kobie
Coetsee said in an interview published Thursday in Die Volksblad, a
newspaper supporting the National Party government.
   ``We will judge the matter objectively, not just on the grounds
of rejecting violence,'' Coetsee said. ``I think the matter will
undoubtedly get F.W. de Klerk's attention after Sept. 6.''
   De Klerk, the nation's acting president, is expected to be chosen
for a full five-year term following the election. He became acting
president after P.W. Botha resigned Aug. 14.
   Until last year, Botha insisted that Mandela, the 71-year-old
leader of the African National Congress, renounce violence in
exchange for freedom.
   Mandela, imprisoned since 1962, is serving a life term for his
conviction on sabotage and plotting to overthrow the government.
   Coetsee arranged a meeting between Botha and Mandela on July 5 at
the president's official residence. At that meeting, Coetsee said,
Mandela had ``endorsed peaceful development.''
   Mandela, the country's best-known black leader, has said he won't
renounce violence until the government dismantles apartheid and
legalizes the ANC.
   Coetsee said he believed Mandela was a moderate figure in the
circles that ``we normally describe as revolutionary.''
   He described Mandela as being a man who ``would not leave his
people in the lurch'' and as having ``an old world, almost an old
Roman'' approach to values.

<HEAD>Second Season Set to Begin Under Revised Rules</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CLEWISTON, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Alligator hunters are poised to fan out
over lakes and canals for the start of the state's second gator
season in a quarter-century, and hide and meat processors won't be
far behind.
   Under new rules, the 221 licensed hunters must kill alligators
immediately by harpoon or bang-stick, a hand-held device that shoots
a .22-caliber cartridge on impact.
   Last year, most of the 2,979 gators bagged were captured and
brought to processors alive. Several airboats were capsized but no
serious injuries were reported in the hunt, the state's first in 26
years.
   Dead gators must be skinned within four hours to keep the meat
from spoiling, so hide and meat processors have made arrangements to
get the fresh meat in cold storage quickly.
   ``The industry has addressed the needs and is taking whatever
actions are necessary to ensure that the quality of the meat is
preserved,'' said Dennis David, coordinator of state alligator
programs. ``Many of them were making arrangements to have ice trucks
and refrigerated trucks and large coolers to purchase carcasses at
the lake shore.''
   Wildlife officials say the state's population of about 1 million
alligators won't be hurt by the monthlong hunt, beginning a
half-hour before sunset today.
   A study of Lake Okeechobee gators indicates the hunt actually may
improve the health of the general population by reducing the number
of reptiles competing for survival, David said.
   The state revived the hunt last year to help trim the gator
population, which has doubled since stringent anti-poaching measures
were adopted in 1970.
   Okeechobee, one of 32 bodies of water open to the hunters, is
drawing particular attention following reported sightings of an
18-foot alligator east of Clewiston on the lake's southwest shore.
   Yet, some feel it's mostly a tall tale.
   ``It's probably 90 percents rumor,'' said Charles Lawhon of Moore
Haven. ``If it's there, it's a well-smart alligator and it keeps
well hidden.''
   Hunters can earn about $500 for the skin and meat of a 4-foot
gator, and prices for large bulls can reach $1,000. The biggest
gator bagged last year stretched 13 feet, 4 inches.
   Parts of the Everglades in western Dade and Broward counties will
be off-limits, despite above-average alligator populations, because
of excessive mercury levels.
   The state selected 229 names at random from among 20,163
applicants for hunting licenses. All but eight attended a six-hour
training session and paid a $250 fee for the right to kill 15 gators
each, David said.
   David expects this year's catch to be about 2,900 again.

<TEXT>
   Jerry Lewis says he has a renewed empathy for
parents whose children die of muscular dystrophy since he and his
wife suffered the loss of an unborn child.
   ``I thought I knew what I was talking about,'' Lewis said,
recalling years of dealing with parents of MD victims. Lewis has
been national chairman of the Muscular Dystrophy Association for 40
years.
   The comedian's 21{-hour, annual Jerry Lewis Labor Day Telethon
begins at 9 p.m. EDT Sunday and will be carried on 200 TV stations
in the United States and Canada. Some 90 million people watched at
least part of last year's fund-raiser.
   Earlier this year Lewis and his wife, Sam, 38, learned she was
pregnant. On May 5, two months into the pregnancy, they learned the
baby's heart had stopped. Lewis, 63, has six sons by a previous
marriage.
   Lewis has conducted his MDA telethons since 1966, coaxing $484
million out of viewers of the entertainment extravaganza. And the
years of pitching for ``one dollar more'' are beginning to pay off,
he said.
   ``We now know that the cure is right around the corner,'' Lewis
said in an interview Wednesday. ``Can you believe it! In 1986 we
were talking about a cure in our lifetime.''
   More than 50 top-name entertainers will be featured on this
year's show, including Frank Sinatra, Liza Minnelli, Sammy Davis
Jr., Tony Orlando, Billy Crystal, Alabama, the Oak Ridge Boys, Jack
Jones, Robert Goulet, the McGuire Sisters, LaToya Jackson, Ringo
Starr, Waylon Jennings and Maureen McGovern.

currency's upswing, while trading on the Tokyo Stock Exchange was
sluggish.
   The dollar closed at 145.45 yen, up 1.17 yen from Thursday's
close. It opened at 144.95 yen and ranged between 144.80 and 145.58
yen.
   ``Dollar-buying pressure overpowered aggressive intervention by
the central bank, made intermittently throughout the trading day,''
said a dealer with Sanwa Bank, a major Japanese commercial bank, who
spoke anonymously.
   Currency dealers said the Bank of Japan stepped into the market,
selling dollars at about 144.95 yen. The Bank of Japan sold an
estimated $700 million during the day, market sources said.
   The central bank does not comment on its market activities.
   The Sanwa dealer said the dollar's strength was attributed to
predictions that U.S. unemployment figures for August, due out in
Washington today, would show an improvement.
   On the stock market, the Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected
issues, which lost 40.46 points Thursday, shed another 82.98 points,
or 0.24 percent, closing the week at 34,348.22.
   Yozo Asai of Yamaichi Securities said the stock market generally
remained weak, centering on major steels and constructions.
   ``A sluggish mood is caused partly by uncertainties over the
exchange-rate movements,'' Asai said.
   Volume traded on the first section totaled 600 million shares,
compared with 650 million shares Thursday.
   Meanwhile, Finance Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto denied a rumor,
spread on the New York market Thursday, that he was involved in
insider trading in the merger of two major Japanese commercial
banks, Kyodo News Service said.
   ``I've never done it. These kind of rumors give me an extremely
unpleasant feeling,'' Kyodo quoted Hashimoto as saying.
   On Tuesday, Mitsui Bank and Taiyo Kobe Bank announced their plans
to merge in April. Together they would become Japan's second-largest
bank in terms of assets after the Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank, the world's
largest.

   Captors holding U.S. hostages in Lebanon are
motivated by a personal vengeance that will be more difficult to
overcome since Israel kidnapped a Moslem cleric, says a U.S. Moslem
leader who claims to have met with the hostage-holders in Beirut.
   Mohammed Mehdi, secretary-general of the National Council on
Islamic Affairs, said Thursday the kidnapping of Sheik Abdul-Karim
Obeid worsened the prospects that the ``exceptionally bitter,
exceptionally paranoid'' kidnappers will free the hostages.
   ``They feel the right to retaliation is sacred, and any
questioning of that is illegitimate,'' said Mehdi, who claims to be
possibly the only person in the United States who has met with the
kidnappers in Beirut.
   Obeid _ who is affiliated with Hezbollah, the pro-Iranian
extremist group believed to sponsor hostage-holders _ was abducted
from his home in south Lebanon July 28 by Israeli commandos. Israel,
saying Obeid was involved in terrorism, has refused to free him.
   The pro-Iranian Organization of the Oppressed on Earth claimed
July 31 it retaliated by hanging U.S. Marine Lt. Col. William R.
Higgins, who was abducted while on U.N. duty in Lebanon. U.S.
officials said they believe Higgins was killed, but some reports say
the killing occurred months earlier.
   Joseph Cicippio, one of the seven other U.S. hostages, was
threatened with death, then given a reprieve.
   Mehdi claims to have met with people responsible for holding
Cicippio and Terry A. Anderson, chief Middle East correspondent of
The Associated Press, during a February 1987 visit to Beirut to
appeal for the hostages' release.
   He said he was led blindfolded to the meeting in a dimly lighted
room in Beirut. The captors he met with _ four men ranging in age
from about 20 to 25 _ bore personal scars from the fighting in
Lebanon, Mehdi said.
   The man who claimed to be in charge of holding Anderson, the
longest-held hostage who was kidnapped in 1985, said his entire
village was destroyed by U.S. bombs dropped in retaliation for the
bombing of the U.S. Marines' headquarters in Lebanon, when 241
servicemen were killed.
   ``He is so damn bitter he is ready to drop such shells on New
York, on Washington,'' Mehdi said of Anderson's captor, who lost his
wife, children and grandparents when his village was bombed.
   The captor responsible for holding Cicippio, who was kidnapped in
September 1986, told Mehdi his children had been burned by American
napalm dropped from an American-made airplane piloted by an Israeli.
Three of the captor's five children died, Mehdi said.
   What Mehdi was told in Lebanon, however, does not entirely match
previous accounts of the kidnappers or events surrounding the
abductions.
   The man holding Anderson has been described as a 38-year-old
Lebanese Shiite, Imad Mugihniyah, who is driven by a desire to free
relatives held in Kuwait for attacks on U.S. and French facilities
there.
   There was one U.S. bombing run following the destruction of the
Marine headquarters and it was not reported to have destroyed any
villages.
   In the case of Cicippio, Israeli sources knowledgeable about
Israel's war in Lebanon say Israeli planes used napalm in a few
cases against strictly military targets belonging to Syria.
   Mehdi said that although Americans consider the kidnappers to be
terrorists, the kidnappers perceive themselves differently.
   ``They said, `We are taking care of these people. Is this
terrorism, or is the burning of our children terrorism?'''
   Mehdi said his attempts to persuade the kidnappers that their
actions violated Islamic law, that the taking of innocent hostages
was contrary to the faith's teachings on personal forgiveness and
individual responsibility, were ``a dead road.''
   Mehdi, who is seeking a meeting with Secretary of State James A.
Baker III, said the U.S. should pressure Israel to release Obeid to
start ``a chain of events to secure the release of the hostages.''
   ``Sheik Obeid, to his group in southern Lebanon, is like the
pope. And you do not kidnap the pope,'' said Mehdi. ``Colonel
Higgins was a victim of this.''
   The United States also should start trying to understand the
suffering that caused the kidnappers to take hostages, Mehdi said.
   ``People are not born terrorists. Circumstances make them take
such violent actions. If we don't bother to examine those
circumstances, we will be denying ourselves the opportunity to solve
a problem,'' Mehdi said.

   The Rolling Stones proved they've still got
hot stuff as they rocked a crowd of 50,000 to kick off their first
tour in eight years.
   ``They're better than ever,'' Joy Harrington, 43, of
Philadelphia, said following Thursday's sold-out show that lasted
more than 2{ hours.
   The Stones are ``the best partying band,'' said Anne Reissig, 51,
from New York's Long Island.
   They were among the crowd that packed Veterans Stadium to see the
Stones launch their 36-city ``Steel Wheels'' tour with fireworks and
Mick Jagger's trademark strut. The group opened its last tour in
Philadelphia in 1981.
   ``We've started in Philadelphia two times in a row,'' Jagger told
crowd. ``I hope it's not too tough on you.''
   ``I think they're better this show,'' said Randy Coppola, 27, of
Medford, N.J., who also saw the British band in 1981. ``I think Mick
Jagger was in top form.''
   The Stones took the stage about 9:30 p.m. with the 1981 hit
``Start Me Up'' and immediately had the crowd dancing. They followed
with ``Bitch'' from 1971 and ``Shattered'' from 1978.
   They then left the stage briefly, explaining they had lost power.
   Jagger, guitarists Keith Richards and Ron Wood, bassist Bill
Wyman, and drummer Charlie Watts were joined on stage by three
backup singers, two keyboard players and five horn players.
   Shortly after midnight, they finished their only encore with
``Jumping Jack Flash,'' which was followed briefly by fireworks.
   ``The Stones not only have it, they have it better than most
bands in the last 10 years,'' said Mark Moatz, 29, of Philadelphia.
``I enjoyed it immensely.''
   Todd Harrington, 23, Mrs. Harrington's son, said the band was
``just as good'' as ever and now were ``more mature, better
dressed.''
   Jagger paraded around the stage singing in his raunchy style and
wearing black pants and a kelly green tuxedo jacket. Later, he wore
a red jacket.
   The Stones performed on a stage that measured 110 feet high and
300 feet wide and showed a scene of industrial decay with catwalks,
gray girders and black nets. ``Strong, tough, urban, risky,'' is how
set designer Michael Fisher, who previously designed the stage for
Pink Floyd's ``The Wall'' tour, described it.
   During ``Honky Tonk Woman,'' two balloon figures of scantily clad
women, nearly as tall as the stage, were inflated.
   The crowd, which saw the band Living Colour open about 7:45 p.m.
with a 45-minute set, ranged from those not yet born when the Stones
first began recording 25 years ago to those as old as the band's
members.
   ``They transcend age groups,'' said Tom Espie, 45, of Scranton.
``I think they're one of the super bands still left.''
   ``They seem to change with the times or stay ahead of the
times,'' said Rebecca Stinnler, a 25-year-old Doylestown resident
who called the band ``the greatest in the world.''
   ``It's just good music. I think anybody would like it,'' said Amy
LaRue, 20, of Reading.
   June Kroop, 41, of Passaic, N.J., said she saw the Stones live
when she was 19.
   ``I never was a hysterical fan for anybody. I just like rock 'n'
roll. It's the adventure, the lure,'' she said.
   Another show is scheduled for Veterans Stadium tonight before the
band goes to Toronto on Sunday.

<HEAD>Cancer Risk Unrelated to Depression, Study Says</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES WEBB</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Feeling down doesn't increase a person's risk of
cancer, says a study that investigated the suggested link between
mood and disease.
   The study shows ``a lot of speculation about the emotional
component in (cancer) is just speculation,'' said Morton Bard, vice
president for services and rehabilitation for the American Cancer
Society.
   The possibility of a connection between outlook and disease has
been ``periodically put forward since the beginning of history,''
Bard said.
   He said the study's message is: ``Hold on there. There is no
answer yet.'' The study, by three researchers at the National
Institute on Aging, challenges the theory that depression can
increase vulnerability to cancer, but doesn't end the debate, said
Alan B. Zonderman, one of the researchers and a psychologist and
senior staff fellow at the institute.
   ``I think for the time being at least, the weight of the evidence
is certainly that there's no risk of cancer from depression,'' said
Zonderman, co-author of a report on the study in today's Journal of
the American Medical Association.
   The study is a 10-year follow-up on 6,403 people who took part in
a 1971-75 survey by the National Center for Health Statistics, which
gathered extensive data on psychology and medical risk.
   The researchers updated the subjects' medical history.
   Using the results of two psychological tests conducted during the
earlier survey, they identified 1,002 as ``down most of the time,''
Zonderman said.
   Of those subjects, 110, or 11 percent, had been diagnosed with
cancer or had died from it since the original study.
   Of the 5,401 subjects who were considered not depressed, 527, or
10 percent, had been diagnosed as having cancer or had died of it.
   The 1 percentage point difference between the cancer rate for the
two groups is statistically insignificant, the researchers said.
   ``We found that depressive systems didn't predict who was going
to get cancer or who was going to die from cancer 10 years later,''
Zonderman said.
   There was no difference in results when researchers adjusted the
study to allow for other factors that could relate to cancer,
including sex, age, marital status, smoking habits, family history
of cancer, hypertension and cholesterol level.
   The results also were unchanged after eliminating subjects who
showed any sign of cancer based on a examination at the time of the
initial survey.
   Earlier studies have supported a link between depression and
cancer, but the new research is a significant blow to that theory,
said Bernard Fox, a professor in the department of psychiatry at
Boston University's School of Medicine, who wrote an accompanying
editorial in the journal.
   Although previous studies also have found no link between
depression and cancer, the work by the National Institute on Aging
is the most extensive so far, said Fox, who specializes in the
relationships between personality and disease.
   ``This is a highly controversial area in which there has
unfortunately been too much exploitation _ for commercial reasons _
relating emotions to cancer,'' said Bard of the National Cancer
Society.
   The new study may help deter people from investing too much faith
or money in the idea that how they feel will effect their
susceptibility to cancer or their ability to fight it, he said.

<HEAD>U S West Reaches Deal Over Refund, Rate Hike</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DENVER (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An agreement between U S West Communications and
regulatory officials will give refunds of $46 million to Colorado
consumers this year and increase telephone rates by more than $85
million beginning in 1992.
   The agreement was reached Thursday by U S West, the state Office
of Consumer Council and the state Public Utilities Commission. The
commission was to hold a hearing on the settlement today in Denver.
   The refund stems from a February 1989 commission order requiring
U S West to return money collected under federally-mandated
depreciation rates that later were overturned by the U.S. Supreme
Court.
   Customers who paid bills between 1985 and 1989 will get a refund
``about equal to the local service portion of one month's telephone
bill,'' the company said. The refunds will appear as credits,
probably in November bills, the company said.
   The company sought the rate increase to upgrade equipment,
especially for rural customers. The size of the rate increase for
individual consumers hasn't been set yet. U S West has proposed
phasing in a hike of less than a dollar a month on every phone bill
in the state.
   ``We're delighted with this settlement,'' said Ron Binz, director
of the consumer counsel office. ``It means telephone customers get
the refund they're entitled to and the state's rural customers get
modern telephone service.''
   Jim Smith, a vice president for U S West Communications, said the
agreement would allow the company to modernize equipment across the
state.
   Switching operations in 84 communities need to be modernized,
officials said, but the company's regular equipment replacement
budget can handle only four to six offices a year.
   The improvements will allow for a variety of new services such as
automatic call forwarding and transmission of computer data over
telephone lines, U S West said.

<HEAD>National Clergy Say Government Faces Emergency, Demands Reform</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   More than 1,800 of the nation's leading
clergymen today accused the government of human rights abuses and
demanded it make good on promises of democratization and other
reform.
   The Korean National Council of Churches said the government of
President Roh Tae-woo was more undemocratic than that of his
dictatorial predecessor and was ``causing people's lives to collapse
with the suppression of human rights.''
   Also today, hundreds of students in Seoul fought with riot
police, and radical youths attacked a police station and an army
officer's quarters in two provincial cities. No arrests or injuries
were reported.
   Authorities said student protesters had received $30,000 from a
Korean group in Japan allegedly controlled by a pro-North Korean
organization.
   The church council, which represents leading protestant clergy in
a nation where one-fourth of the population is Christian, has been a
political force for years. But today's message was its first major
political stand since Roh came to power.
   In a statement issued following an all-night prayer meeting at a
downtown Anglican church, the council said more than 800 people were
arrested as political prisoners in recent months.
   ``Movements for independence, democratization and unification
have been denounced as leftist and pro-communist,'' said the
statement. It said there had been violence, torture and surveillance
``threatening the people's rights to survival and causing the people
to tremble in a sense of crisis.''
   Dissidents, radical students, Roman Catholic clergy and some
politicians have accused the government of stalling on democratic
reforms Roh promised before he took office in February 1988.
   At Seoul's Joongang University, witnesses said 1,000 radical
students battled police with rocks and firebombs to demand the
government disband the nation's intelligence apparatus, the Agency
for National Security Planning.
   About 500 students demanding the release of a radical student
jailed for an illegal trip to North Korea hurled firebombs at riot
police in front of Korea University in Seoul.
   ``Overthrow Roh Tae-woo!'' students yelled. Riot police in combat
fatigues drove them back with tear gas.
   At Kyonghee University in Seoul, 400 students fought with riot
police.
   The Agency for National Security Planning, formerly the Korean
Central Intelligence Agency, announced today that the radical
National Council of Student Representatives received $30,000 for
anti-state activities from a pro-communist Korean student alliance
in Japan.
   The student group sent 20-year-old Im Su-kyong to a youth
festival in communist North Korea in defiance of a South Korean
government ban on unauthorized travel to the north. She was jailed
upon her return on charges of violating national security laws.
   The South Korean security agency claimed that the group in Japan,
the Korean Student Alliance, is under control of the pro-North
Korean Chosoren organization, also in Japan.
   The agency said the alliance delivered the money in August 1988
to the student council's chairman, Oh Yong-shik, who also is jailed
on charges of national security violations.

   Hurricane Gabrielle surprised weather experts with
its quick development from a tropical storm into the fourth
hurricane of the Atlantic season, forecasters said.
   ``It was a little faster than anticipated,'' Jim Gross of the
National Hurricane Center in suburban Coral Gables said this morning.
   Gabrielle strengthened quickly as it pushed away from the African
coast and passed the hurricane threshold late Thursday. It had
maximum sustained winds of 75 mph, with higher gusts in squalls,
forecasters said.
   At 6 a.m. EDT, Gabrielle was centered near 11.9 degrees north
latitude and 33.8 degrees west longitude, or about 625 miles west
southwest of the westernmost Cape Verde Islands. It was moving west
at 17 mph.
   Meanwhile, Felix weakened again to a tropical depression in the
central North Atlantic as its winds dropped to 35 mph. Felix had
become a tropical storm for the second time briefly when its winds
picked up to 40 mph on Thursday.
   At 6 a.m. EDT, Felix was near 30.9 north latitude and 41.5 west
longitude, or about 700 miles southwest of the Azores moving to the
west northwest at 12 mph. The depression was expected to continue on
this course today with little change in strength.
   Neither storm is an immediate threat to land, Gross said.
   A depression becomes a storm when its winds hit 39 mph, and a
hurricane when they reach 74 mph.

<HEAD>West Germany To Take In Thousands Of East Germans From Hungary</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CAROL J. WILLIAMS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BONN, West Germany (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Thousands of East Germans who fled to
Hungary will be allowed to travel to West Germany in the next few
days, government sources and an opposition party official say.
   West German Karsten Voigt, foreign affairs expert for the
opposition Social Democrats, said in Budapest Thursday that senior
Hungarian officials confirmed to him they plan to let out all East
Germans who want to leave for West Germany.
   About 10 percent of the 150,000 to 200,000 East Germans
vacationing in Hungary are thought to be seeking passage to West
Germany, and Bonn and Budapest have agreed to help them, the
government sources said on condition of anonymity.
   Hungary and East Germany are ruled by communist governments and
are in the Soviet camp. However, Hungary has embraced Western-style
reforms while East Germany has shunned them.
   In Vienna, Austrian officials confirmed that Bonn asked them to
arrange for special rail transportation for up to 20,000 East
Germans.
   Voigt discussed the situation in Budapest on Thursday with
Hungary's Communist Party president, Rezso Nyers, and Foreign
Ministry officials.
   Hungary will let the East Germans out under the auspices of the
Red Cross or some other international humanitarian organization,
Voigt told the West German ZDF television network.
   ``I was told this could only be a one-time thing. And it is
certainly important for the East German leadership to tolerate such
a solution if not support it,'' he said.
   The apparent plan to allow East Germans out of Hungary without
the usual documents authorizing their departure may have been
intentionally leaked by West German officials earlier Thursday to
let potential emigres in East Germany know about the rare escape
opportunity.
   Most areas of East Germany receive Western radio or TV broadcasts.
   Asked if Hungary had agreed to allow the escapes during the next
few days, one West German official told The Associated Press: ``I
cannot deny that.''
   Officially, Bonn has denied it is working with Hungary to aid the
escapees. Foreign Ministry spokesman Peter Rothen described reports
of the plan as ``pure speculation.''
   However, Austrian Railways officials in Vienna told The
Associated Press they were asked by Bonn to ready railroad cars for
a mass transport of refugees from the Hungarian border on Sept. 6.
   One official said he expected the exodus sooner, perhaps this
weekend.
   Austrian Railways has promised to make up to 50 train cars
available within six hours at an unspecified border point with
Hungary, the official said on condition of anonymity.
   The Frankfurter Rundschau newspaper said the refugees would be
allowed passage to West Germany on the basis of their East German
visas for Hungary.
   A senior West German Foreign Ministry official, Michael Jansen,
has spent this week shuttling among Budapest, Vienna and Prague.
Hungary's Foreign Minister Gyula Horn visited East Berlin on
Thursday.
   The illegal exodus of at least 6,000 East Germans through Hungary
this summer has strained relations between the two Warsaw Pact
allies, as well as between East Germany and West Germany.
   East German state media have accused Bonn of enticing workers to
the West and have embarked on a propaganda war to scare citizens
into staying.
   Unprecedented legal immigration combined with the largest escape
spree since 1961, when the Berlin Wall was built, will bring at
least 100,000 East Germans to West Germany this year, the
Inter-German Affairs Ministry has predicted.
   Hungary has become the escape route for many East Germans
frustrated with the lack of reform in their country. It began
dismantling its border fortifications with Austria in May as part of
its democratic reforms.
   East Germany, a nation of 16 million, suffers a widespread labor
shortage. The West German economy is expected to benefit from the
new influx of manual laborers and skilled technicians from East
Germany, including a construction boom to provide housing for the
newcomers.

<HEAD>Party Opens Convention by Renewing Call to Legalize Drugs</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JEFF BARKER</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>PHILADELPHIA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Libertarian Party announced plans to
strengthen its self-proclaimed role as America's third party, but
leaders acknowledge their opposition to the drug war isn't likely to
win votes quickly.
   Nevertheless, the party opened its annual convention Thursday by
renewing its call for the legalization of drugs.
   ``It does no good to back away from the unpopular issues,'' 1984
presidential candidate David Bergland told delegates.
   The party believes drugs should be legalized because the ``war''
is an excuse to trample individuals' rights. Just as the prohobition
of alcohol spawned organized crime, the Libertarians say current
laws make drug dealing profitable.
   ``At this moment in time, the Drug Enforcement Administration is
the greatest threat to the liberties of the American people,'' said
Dave Nolan, a founder of the 18-year-old party.
   The party boasts 200,000 members but had less than 500 in
attendance at the opening session of the three-day convention.
Delegates had to pay their own way.
   Nolan conceded that the drug war ``is popular at the moment, and
our stand against it is going to be unpopular.''
   But party leaders said their position would reap dividends
eventually because the war on drugs was doomed to failure.
   ``We will be seen as the ones who stuck to their guns,'' said
Larry Dodge, a onetime U.S. Senate and gubernatorial candidate in
Montana.
   The drug position is consistent with the Libertarian philosophy
that government is too big and intrusive. That philosophy also leads
to them to support abortion rights and gun owners' rights and
advocate a non-interventionist foreign policy.
   Several party leaders said the Libertarians should focus less on
running for president, and more on getting their message to the
public. They announced a renewed effort to use the media and high
school seminars to spread their ideas.
   ``When a representative of the Libertarian Party goes to a public
high school, every student is impressed with the legitimacy of the
party in the political system,'' Bergland said.
   The Libertarians were thrilled that the convention was covered by
C-SPAN, which covers Congress and offers public affairs broadcasts
on cable television.
   ``We look for balance,'' C-SPAN spokeswoman Kristin Wennberg said
Thursday. Mimicking the Republicans and Democrats, the Libertarians
brought placards to the meeting site _ a hotel ballroom _ bearing
the names of all 50 states. But some states had no representatives
present.

<TEXT>
   Chancellor Helmut Kohl said today that
only the truth will heal the wounds of the war Germany began a half
century ago and declared his nation's readiness to reconcile with
Poland.
   In a nationally televised speech to the federal Bundestag, or
parliament, on the 50th anniversary of the start of World War II,
Kohl said Germans had to acknowledge their responsibility for the
Holocaust and Hitler's dictatorship.
   But he said that following Germany's defeat in the war, the
nation had been fundamentally altered and dedicated to the
principles of freedom and democracy. For those reasons, he said, the
younger generation of Germans were absolved of responsibility for
the war.
   ``They bear no guilt for dictatorship or the world war _ neither
collective as there is no such thing, nor individual as their elders
retain that,'' he said.
   But Kohl also said the horrors inflicted on Europe by the Nazi
regime could never be overcome or underestimated.
   ``It must always be a reminder,'' he said, referring to the
millions of victims of the Holocaust. ``It can never be rendered
harmless by false comparisons.''
   Joining parliament to hear the 50-minute speech were guests that
included Polish students, Warsaw's ambassador to West Germany,
Ryszard Karski, and U.S. Ambassador Vernon Walters.
   Kohl was interrupted by applause only once, when he said West
Germany wished success for Poland's new leadership.
   Relations with Poland and other communist nations of the East
bloc were a major theme of Kohl's address and of memorial speeches
by other West German dignitaries, including President Richard von
Weizsaecker and former chancellor Willy Brandt.
   ``We want understanding between the German and Polish peoples,''
Kohl declared. ``This is our duty, and it expresses the yearning of
both peoples.''
   Poland was the first nation to fall victim to Nazi attack, when
Hitler's army invaded Sept. 1, 1939, beginning the world war that
would eventually claim 50 million lives.
   ``In the name of Germany and by German hands were the terrors
brought about for the Polish people,'' Kohl said. ``Reconciliation
is only possible if we tell the whole truth.''
   Kohl recalled the systematic extermination of Jews, Poles,
gypsies and political opponents, and blamed the Nazis and ``the all
too many Germans as well as many others abroad who allowed
themselves to be blinded and misguided by tyranny.''
   His cautious attempt to address the responsibility of today's
Germany for the crimes of the past recalled memories of a more
controversial effort last November by then-Bundestag President
Philipp Jenninger.
   Jenninger, of Kohl's Christian Democratic Union, offended
liberals and conservatives alike when his recollection of how
Germans at the time praised Hitler's repressions was interpreted as
being in sympathy with those sentiments.
   In that speech on the Nov. 10, 1988, the anniversary of the
Kristallnacht pogrom against Jews 50 years earlier, Jenninger said
the Germans of that time saw the early years of the Third Reich as a
``triumphal march.''
   Jewish leaders including Simon Wiesenthal later excused
Jenninger's remarks as unfortunate but not ill-intended, but the
parliamentary leader stepped down a day after the speech in the face
of widespread public criticism.
   Kohl said the foundation of the West German state established
after the war discourages the growth of extremism, but that radical
elements persist today.
   ``Extremism from the political right or left can succeed and come
to power only when the citizens turn away from the democratic
parties or stand indifferent,'' he said.
   He made no direct reference to the ultra-right Republicans party
but appeared to be warning West Germans against defecting from
moderation.
   The Republicans have garnered as much as 10 percent of the vote
in recent local elections on a campaign platform that some view as
threatening the rights of foreigners and have drawn important
support away from Kohl's conservative party.

<HEAD>Israeli Troops Kill Guerrilla Near Lebanese Border</HEAD>

   Israeli troops clashed today with several
guerrillas in Israel's self-declared security zone in south Lebanon.
An army spokesman said one guerrilla was killed and two escaped.
   Security sources in Lebanon said a fourth gunman may have escaped
after being wounded in the clash.
   During the fighting, two Soviet-made Katyusha rockets exploded in
northern Israel causing no damage, security sources said. The
rockets were apparently fired from outside the security zone near
the area of the clash.
   The clash happened before dawn near the village of Beit Yahun,
six miles northwest of the Israeli border, said an Israeli army
spokesman, who requested anonymity in line with military regulations.
   The spokesman said the dead gunman carried a Soviet-made AK-47
assault rifle and large amounts of ammunition and plastic explosives.
   Later, soldiers showed reporters the body of the dead guerrilla,
who was wearing a camouflage uniform. The soldiers also showed three
Kalashnikov assault guns, two of which apparently belonged to the
escaped fighters.
   On Thursday, another round of Katyusha rockets struck near a
house in northern Israel smashing windows but causing no injuries.
   Military spokesmen said they did not know which militia the
guerrilla killed today may have belonged to.
   The last attack in the security zone was on August 9, when a
suicide car bomb carrying 550 pounds of explosives was detonated
near an Israeli military convoy, wounding five Israeli troops and an
allied Lebanese militiaman. Two men in the car were killed.
   Hezbollah, the Shiite Moslem fundamentalist militia, claimed
responsibility for the attack and said it was in retalitation for
Israel's kidnapping of a pro-Iranian Lebanese clergyman. Israeli
troops abducted Shiite cleric Sheik Abdel Karim Obeid from his home
in south Lebanon. Israeli troops along the northern border have been
on alert in anticipation of Hezbollah attacks.
   Israel created the security zone in 1985 as a buffer zone after
withdrawing the bulk of its force following a three-year occupation.
   The 2-to-12-mile-wide zone is patrolled by Israeli soldiers and
the 2,500-member Israeli-supported South Lebanon Army militia.

<HEAD>Moldavians Protest Language Compromise; Baltics Criticize Kremlin</HEAD>

   Thousands of ethnic Moldavians marched today to
protest a law that satisfies their demand to make their native
tongue the republic's official language but which still allows the
use of Russian.
   The law, passed by Moldavian legislators on Thursday, was a
compromise measure meant to appease ethnic Russians and other
minorities who opposed making Moldavian the official language.
   In the three Baltic republics, nationalist group leaders sharply
criticized the Kremlin for attacking their efforts to gain more
autonomy. Latvia's activist organization demanded that the central
government recognize the region's ``special economic and political
status.''
   The Moldavian Supreme Soviet legislature met today to consider
how to apply the controversial language law. Moldavian was made the
official language in a show of independence from the Soviet Union
and an attempt to preserve Moldavian culture.
   Ethnic Moldavians make up 64 percent of the republic's
population, and Russian and other ethnic groups comprise the rest.
   The law makes Moldavian the official language of government and
economic affairs but allows use of both Russian and Moldavian in
everyday life.
   The provision that sanctions some use of Russian was aimed at
ending strikes at an estimated 200 businesses and industries by
ethnic Russians angered by the law.
   Tens of thousands of Moldavians poured into the streets of the
capital, Kishinev, on Thursday night to protest the compromises, and
several thousand massed again today, official and unofficial sources
said.
   ``People are disatisfied with all the compromises the deputies
agreed to,'' Konstantin Bogdanash, a journalist with the People's
Front group that has led the campaign for preservation of the
Moldavian language, said in a telephone interview.
   Bogdanash said protesters outside Kishinev's opera theater, where
the 350-member Supreme Soviet meets, held signs reading, ``People
want Freedom,'' and ``Respected Russians, Mother Russia Calls You
Home.''
   ``The people are scandalized. We need only one language,'' said
Vasily Nestase, another People's Front member.
   He said the group would call a general strike if the decision is
not reversed and that the next step would be secession from the
Soviet Union.
   ``We are not a legal part of the Soviet Union,'' Nestase said,
pointing to the Soviet annexation of Moldavia from neighboring
Romania in 1940 under a Nazi-Soviet agreement of the year before,
which also divided Poland and the Baltic states.
   The lawmakers on Thursday also restored the Latin alphabet taken
away a half-century ago by dictator Josef Stalin when he annexed
Moldavia. Stalin imposed Cyrillic, the alphabet used in Russian, to
back his claim that Romanians and Moldavians are two distinct
nationalities even though the languages are virtually identical.
   A third proposal, which was rejected, would have made Moldavian
the language of communication among Russians, Ukrainians, Jews,
Bulgarians, and other nationalities in the republic. Many
non-Moldavians do not speak Moldavian, but generally know some
Russian.
   Legislators instead opted for an obscurely worded compromise of
bilingualism, similar to that proposed Wednesday by Moldavia's
Communist Party chief, Semen Grossu, after a conversation with
President Mikhail S. Gorbachev.
   According to a reporter for ATEM, Moldavia's official news
agency, it reads: ``The Russian language, as the language of
inter-ethnic communication in the U.S.S.R., is used on the territory
of the republic together with Moldavian as a language of
inter-ethnic communication, which ensures the carrying out of real
bilingualism between Russian and the national tongue.''
   In the Baltics, the leaders of the People's Fronts of Latvia,
Lithuania and Estonia reacted to the Communist Party leadership's
recent scathing criticism of their independence movements.
   A statement released after a meeting of the three groups in the
Latvian capital, Riga, said the party's criticism was adopted
``behind the backs of these republics without even the slightest
attempt to discuss with them problems closely concerning them,''
said Artis Erglis, a secretary of the Latvian People's Front.
   ``Whether the authors wanted it or not, as a result in the eyes
of many people they look like the brothers of those who divided
zones of influence in 1939 and decided the fate of our sovereign
people...'' the statement said.
   The Latvian People's Front issued a statement today saying its
leaders planned to revise their group's platform to include a call
for complete independence for the republic.
   ``Only in an independent, democratic Latvia can an economic and
political crisis be overcome,'' the statement said.

<HEAD>Students, in Public Statements, Say the Protests Were Wrong</HEAD>

   Shu Wei, one of the last students to leave
Tiananmen Square before the military moved in on that bloody dawn in
June, said today she now thinks the student leaders should be thrown
in jail.
   Zhang Lin, who took part in hunger strikes on the square, is
thankful to her university for political education classes giving
students a chance to ``reach a clear understanding'' of the June
tragedy.
   The two were among a group of 13 officials and students from
Qinghua University who met foreign reporters today to give their
views of the student-led democracy movement and its aftermath.
   Their conclusions _ that with thorough ideological guidance the
students now realized their errors in joining the 7-week-long
pro-democracy protests _ matched daily reports in the official press
in which students admit being misled by ``counterrevolutionaries''
bent on overthrowing the government.
   The newly adopted pro-government stances, however, differ with
what many students say in private conversations. They say students
repeat whatever is expected of them at political discussion sessions
but that few people really accept the government version of the
crackdown on the student movement.
   Qinghua Vice President Liang Yoneng said as many as 2,000 of the
university's 13,800 undergraduate and graduate students joined major
street marches in late April and that 200 took part in a mid-May
hunger strike.
   Four students were killed, all by gunshots, and 11 were injured
during the June 3-4 military attack on students and their supporters.
   Chinese officials say 500 people died in the crackdown, while
Western security sources say the death toll may have been in the
thousands.
   Liang said no students had been expelled for participating in the
demonstrations. Three students wanted by police had been arrested,
and police were conducting ``further investigations'' against others
involved in spreading rumors and instigating unrest, he said.
   Liang's only expression of regret was that the university did not
move more quickly to stop the demonstrations. ``If we had stopped
them the losses would have been smaller.''
   Shu, an automotive engineering student, said it was ``quite
reasonable'' for the government to round up student leaders because
``they violated the law in some respects and they must be dealt
with.''
   Student activists who led the protests have been charged with
counterrevolutionary crimes and have been among the thousands
arrested since the June crackdown.
   The students at Qinghua, one of China's most respected
universities, returned to campus on Aug. 14 to catch up on classes
missed during the turmoil and for a heavy dose of political
indoctrination.
   Similar to other Beijing universities, Qinghua students are
receiving four weeks of political education, eight hours a week of
reading documents by government leaders, watching government-edited
videos that show rioters attacking soldiers and writing personal
reflections expected to reveal sadder but wiser individuals.
   The foreign reporters were also given a tour of a computer
classroom and a student workshop and allowed to speak briefly with
students.
   One, 20-year-old engineering student Shi Xiaoli, said students
now agree they were pulled into a counterrevolutionary rebellion.
   But unlike the selected speakers, Miss Shi acknowledged there was
some unhappiness with specific government measures. She mentioned a
harshly worded editorial in the Communist Party's People's Daily on
April 26 which accused the students of causing social turmoil.
   ``It was like setting fire to dry wood,'' she said, referring to
a major protest march on April 27. ``The editorial should have made
clearer that only a handful were counterrevolutionaries.''

<TEXT>
   A Roman Catholic priest who banned shorts,
miniskirts and other scanty apparel in his church has angered some
parishioners, but the archdiocese says it has no plans to overrule
his policy.
   Since he began enforcing the dress code this summer, the Rev.
Roger Griese has turned away worshipers four times from Sacred Heart
Church, where he has been pastor since 1968 in this southwest Ohio
city.
   He also has posted notices reminding congregation members they
must wear modest attire if they are to receive Communion.
   Denial of Communion is highly unusual in Roman Catholic doctrine,
said Monsignor Lawrence Breslin of suburban Kettering, a former vice
rector of the American College in Rome.
   ``My responsibility is to see to the proper and reverent use of
the house of God,'' Griese, 73, said Thursday. ``My responsibility
is to God and the church.''
   Griese's feelings about churchgoers' attire did not represent
those of the archdiocese, said a Dayton spokesman for Archbishop
Daniel Pilarczyk.
   ``I hope that people don't think that his opinion is the general
opinion of all priests,'' said the Rev. Robert Monnin, who also is
pastor of St. Christopher Church in nearby Vandalia. ``That's one
man's opinion.''
   But he said the archbishop had no plans to speak to Griese or
take steps to curtail his policy.
   Ray George, communications director for the Cincinnati
archdiocese, said his office had received about 20 calls about
Griese, ranging from support to outrage.
   Among those angered was Elizabeth Corrado, 20, who ignored the
warning signs and entered Griese's church one Sunday last month
wearing shorts and a silk shirt. She said she was accompanied by her
boyfriend, also wearing shorts.
   ``In front of the entire church, he says, `Get out of my church _
you're not welcomed here,''' Ms. Corrado recalled. ``I couldn't
believe he was saying this. Of course, everybody was staring at us.''

<HEAD>Christian Leader Claims Moslem Infiltration Repulsed</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MOHAMMED SALAM</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Syrian troops bombarded the Christian
heartland today in fierce artillery battles that left at least seven
people dead and 55 wounded.
   Police said the casualties came after midnight in clashes that
escalated after the Christian leader, Gen. Michel Aoun, claimed his
troops repulsed two infiltration attempts by Syrian-backed
militiamen during the night.
   The latest casualties raised the overall toll in nearly six
months of fighting to at least 819 killed and 2,409 wounded.
   Police said the Syrians were shelling the entire 310-square-mile
Christian enclave north of Beirut. The Christian port of Jounieh
north of Beirut was pounded by hundreds of shells and rockets.
   A police spokesman, who cannot be named under standing
regulations, said 80 shells a minute were hitting the enclave as
Christian gunners tried to knock out the Syrian artillery.
   Apartment buildings burned out of control in both parts of
divided Beirut and other areas as the Syrian army and Christian
forces battled through the night and morning.
   One Christian shell blasted the second-floor apartment of Mustafa
Najjar, 33, a soundman with the London-based Visnews television
agency, in the Aishe Bakkar neighborhood of Moslem west Beirut.
   Najjar carried his 8-year-old daughter and 7-year-old son through
the flames to safety. But his wife, Amal, 27, was burned to death,
neighbors said. She was one of seven civilians killed Thursday.
   Ambulances sped through the deserted, smoke-filled streets of
west Beirut taking casualties to hospitals.
   About 90 percent of the city's 1.5 million people have fled the
carnage in recent weeks, leaving an estimated 200,000 people
huddling in basement bunkers and underground garages in the
shell-blasted capital.
   Shells exploded around the once-thriving Hamra business section
and the once-fashionable Ras Beirut residential neighborhood in the
city's Moslem sector at noon.
   A spokesman for Aoun's command said the night-time attacks by
Syria's allies in Beirut and east Lebanon were apparent infiltration
attempt to probe Christian defenses.
   The spokesman, who declined to be named, said one group of 12
militiamen tried to penetrate from Syrian-controlled Moslem west
Beirut near the harbor on the eastern end of the capital's dividing
Green Line.
   Another group tried to ``infiltrate across our lines'' in the
Ein-Tuffaha sector on the mountainous eastern flank of the Christian
enclave.
   ``Both attempts were repulsed,'' the spokesman said. ``We believe
they were reconnaissance attempts by Syria's allies to feel out our
combat readiness.''
   He said Aoun's 155mm guns scored several direct hits on a Syrian
ammunition dump in the mountain town of Bolonia, 15 miles northeast
of Beirut.
   ``The depot exploded in a ball of fire that was followed by a
chain of blasts in the pine woods around Bolonia,'' the spokesman
said.
   The Christians claimed their forces knocked out a Syrian tank in
the Druse Moslem hamlet of Abadiyeh, six miles east of Beirut with
106mm cannons.
   Syrian headquarters in Lebanon declined comment on the Christian
claims.
   Police said Syrian guns in west Beirut were shelling the 28-mile
stretch of Mediterranean coast north of Beirut held by the
Christians.
   The enclave is ringed by Syrian troops and their allies on its
three landward sides. The coastal strip is the Christians' only
lifeline to the outside world.
   A witness in west Beirut said Syrian artillery fire forced ``a
big ship'' off the Christian-held coastline to flee when it tried to
run the blockade the Syrians imposed in mid-March to stop arms and
other supplies reaching Aoun's beleaguered forces.
   ``The ship turned around when the shelling started,'' said the
witness, who spoke on condition of anonymity. ``Shells are falling
around it. Aoun's men are shelling the Syrian artillery to take the
pressure off it.''

<TEXT>
   Grandparents of a 4-year-old boy were
charged with keeping the child in a squalid outdoor pen during the
day, with no toilet and just a bottle of water, officials said.
   Gene and Joyce White said they built the caged pen for the boy to
keep him from roaming out onto a nearby highway.
   ``If that excuse is satisfactory, it will be up to a judge or
jury, but it is not satisfactory to me,'' District Attorney Drew
Edmondson said Thursday. ``The boy was kept in a 10-foot pen with a
wire fence on two sides and board fence on the other two sides so it
could not be seen from the highway.
   ``There was a bean bag-type chair and toys inside the pen. Water
was in a baby bottle, which was in the dirt, and there was no toilet
facilities except in a corner of the pen. There was no roof, and the
pen was covered only by a tree,'' he said.
   The Whites faced a misdemeanor charge usually filed in cases of
failure to pay child support. The ``omitting to provide'' charge
carries a year in jail or a $500 fine.
   Edmondson that was the only charge available to prosecutors. ``We
looked at the child abuse statutes very carefully, and our feeling
is it requires an injury or maiming of the child, which is not
present in this case.''
   The boy, his 11-year-old cousin and the Whites' 13-year-old
daughter who also lived in their recreational vehicle were taken
into custody Tuesday by the state Department of Human Services.
   Child welfare investigators will hold a hearing to determine if
the children should be returned to the home or placed in temporary
custody elsewhere.
   Investigators said the boy appeared to be well-nourished and had
no apparent injuries.
   The boy's mother left him with the grandparents when he was 2,
and the boy's father apparently works in another city, said
sheriff's Deputy Patrick Howland.

   Europe today paid solemn tribute
to the millions of victims of World War II, which started 50 years
ago on Sept. 1 when a German warship opened fire on a tiny Polish
garrison.
   Adolf Hitler's troops quickly overran Poland, and the war spread
around the globe. In the end, 50 million people had died.
   By then the Nazis had shocked the world with the extermination of
6 million Jews, and the United States had forever changed warfare by
dropping nuclear bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki in 1945.
   Many of Belgium's 6 million Dutch speakers woke up to a broadcast
of Hitler declaring war on Poland. BRT state radio opened its
foreign news report with a tape of the original declaration and
Germans cheering for their fuhrer.
   In London, a reunion was planned of some of the people who were
evacuated during Hitler's savage Blitzkrieg bombings of the city.
   Italy's leading daily, the Milan-based Corriere della Sera, told
its readers that ``Europe paid the price of its lacerations with the
loss of its political supremacy.''
   West Germany's Chancellor Helmut Kohl told a special Parliament
session in Bonn: ``We feel sorrow for the unspeakable suffering
which was caused to human beings and nations in the name of the
Germans and by the hand of the Germans.''
   ``We mourn for the many innocent victims from within our own
people,'' Kohl added.
   As he spoke, a group of young Poles sat in the visitors' gallery.
The group had been invited as a sign of reconciliation between West
Germany and Poland, which suffered more than any other country from
the Nazi atrocities.
   There still are nagging questions over West Germany's
relationship with Poland. Kohl has been under pressure from the
opposition Social Democratic Party to visit Poland, as he has
promised to do, and provide more financial aid to Warsaw.
   ``By delaying his visit, the chancellor is wasting good chances
to give a clear expression to the reconciliation process between
Poles and Germans,'' party leader Hans-Jochen Vogel said Thursday.
   The Communist Party daily in Czechoslovakia, Rude Pravo, called
the fighting that spread to all corners of the globe ``mankind's
most terrible war.''
   In Communist East Berlin, Foreign Minister Oskar Fischer called
today a day of ``recollection and sorrow'' during a speech to the
500-member People's Chamber.
   Fischer also repeated the commitment ``to do everything in our
power to insure that war and fascism never again threaten our lives
and the lives of our children.''
   Corriere della Sera called Hitler's Blitkrieg ``the technology of
a new Genghis Khan,'' the dreaded Mongol conqueror of central Asia.
   It noted that Hitler had the support of the ``German masses,''
also pointing out that European political clout plunged after World
War II.
   Some of the most closely watched events were scheduled in Poland.
   President Wojciech Jaruzelski was to speak at Westerplatte on the
Baltic coast, where the first shots were fired.
   ``We will pay homage to all victims of the war, we will pay
homage to its heroes and we will express the will to live in
peace,'' said Wlodzimierz Lozinski, a spokesman for Jaruzelski.
   American conductor Leonard Bernstein was to lead an
internationally televised memorial concert in Warsaw, and Pope John
Paul II was to address fellow Poles in Warsaw by a TV hookup.
   But an event to bring together members of the world's dominant
religions to pray for peace appeared likely to be marred by a
boycott by Poland's only rabbi.
   Rabbi Menachem Joskowicz said he would stay away because the
Roman Catholic Church has not removed a convent from the Auschwitz
concentration camp that many consider offensive to the memory of the
2.5 million Jews killed there.
   Fifty years after the outbreak of World War II, there are still
many unresolved issues traceable to Adolf Hitler's dictatorship.
   They include the role of secret protocols in the 1939
non-aggression pact between Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union.
   The agreement allowed the Soviets to take over the Baltic
republics of Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania, and Western accounts say
the pact paved the way for the start of World War II.
   Recent Soviet reforms have emboldened residents of the Baltics,
now the site of a growing independence movement.
   The Kremlin on Thursday called World War II ``the most horrible
and destructive of all wars.'' The commentary from the official
Soviet news agency Tass then quickly lept to how the ``lessons of
the past'' should lead the West to agreeing with Moscow on arms
control issues.
   In Bonn, ultra-conservative Finance Minister Theo Waigel said he
did not deny ``one iota of German guilt'' for the war. But he added
that ``a one-sided view of history with the conclusion that only the
Germans are burdened with guilt would be unbearable and would lead
to dangerous condemnations.''
   Ultra-conservatives have long asserted that Soviet dictator Josef
Stalin also shares some of the blame for the outbreak of the war.

<HEAD>Investigators Study Scaffolding Used Before Bridge Collapse</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LAUREL, Md. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Federal highway officials scrutinized the
scaffolding used during the construction of a bridge that collapsed
on a major Baltimore-Washington thoroughfare, injuring 14 people.
   The overpass collapsed Thursday during the morning rush hour as
workers poured concrete onto the bridge.
   ``All of a sudden, I saw these big blocks of concrete hitting my
hood,'' said Earnest L. Izzard, 52. ``I thought I was a goner, but
something inside _ I'm sure it was God _ kept me calm.''
   ``It was like a mountain coming down toward you,'' said Thomas
Rogers, 53, of Baltimore, who was riding in the back seat of
Izzard's car. ``I don't know how we made it.''
   Another driver, Kimberly Sue Andersen, 30, of Elkridge, got
deluged with debris and was pinned in her car until rescue workers
pulled her out. She was taken to the Maryland Schock Trauma Center
with head injuries and a fractured jaw. She was listed in critical
but stable condition today.
   Four other passengers and nine construction workers were also
injured. Some of workers went down with the bridge when it fell.
   ``I was right on the bridge,'' said David Klein, 25, a
construction worker from Hanover. ``I heard the metal giving way. I
was wondering if I was going to be alive when I hit bottom.''
   Highway officials say they want to determine whether the bridge's
steel and wood scaffolding was damaged when it was moved from a
bridge that runs parallel to the one that collapsed.
   Such scaffolding is commonly used in bridge construction to
provide a temporary support of the wet concrete deck of the bridge
until the concrete sets.
   The collapsed overpass was one of four bridges being built as
part of a $6.2 million interchange project on the federally owned
parkway at Route 198. When the two bridges over the northbound
parkway lanes were built, the contractors dismantled the scaffolding
after finishing the first bridge and set it up again to build the
second bridge.
   Workers at the site said Thursday that the general contractors,
Associated Marjon Inc. of Ashland, Va., and J.P. Smith of Edgewater,
Md., used that procedure to save time. Construction on the bridges
began in March 1987 and was to be completed by this November.
   Company officials could not be reached Thursday, but federal
officials and the contractor on the first two bridges said the
practice is not unusual.

<HEAD>U.S. Asks Israel's Help in Finding Israei Tied to Noriega, Report
Says</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LOUIS MEIXLER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>JERUSALEM (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The United States has asked Israel to help
persuade a former Israeli intelligence agent to leave Panama, where
he is a top adviser to Gen. Manuel Noriega, a newspaper reported
today.
   A Foreign Ministry spokesman, speaking on condition of anonymity,
said he has no information on any U.S. request concerning Mike
Harari, a former agent of Israel's Mossad intelligenge agency.
   The spokesman added that Harari is a private citizen and Israel
has no influence over his overseas activities.
   Harari is believed to be a security adviser to Noriega, the chief
of Panamanian Defense Forces, who U.S. official say plays a major
role in the flow of drugs into the United States.
   Also today, the Defense Ministry began evacuating from Colombia
the families of Defense Ministry and military industry officials,
Israel media reported.
   Israeli newspapers said Israel is concerned about threats to the
families that were made after reports surfaced that Israeli
ex-commandos trained militias for Colombian drug barons.
   The independent mass-circulation Hadashot newspaper said U.S.
officials believe Harari has detailed information on Noriega's
involvement in drug dealings and informed Israeli officials that
they are interested in questioning Harari.
   The newspaper quoted U.S. officials as saying that Harari's close
relationship with Noriega could cause damage to Israel.
   Hadashot said the United States has been interested in
questioning Harari for several months. The newspaper said Harari
flew to Miami in June on a forged passport but left before FBI
officials discovered he was in the United States.
   The independent Maariv newspaper said the order to evacuate the
families of Israeli officials and businessmen in Colombia was made
after some began receiving death threats from anonymous callers
believed tied to drug cartels.
   The Colombian drug traffickers, Maariv said, are angry about an
Israeli offer to aid Colombia in its fight against narcotics.
   Israeli officials said they have made little progress in an
investigation of four ex-commandos suspected of training hit squads
for drug dealers.
   The head of the police investigations unit, Yehoshua Caspi, said
no information has been found tying reserve Lt. Col. Yair Klein to
drug dealers.
   Klein has admitted giving paramilitary training in Colombia but
said it was for ranchers threatened with guerrilla attack and not
for drug dealers.
   Caspi said police are still waiting for information from the
Colombian police on Klein's involvement, and officials have said the
investigation may be dropped if such evidence is not provided.
   But an American journalist said he was shown a videotape Klein
made in Colombia in which know drug cartel figures appeared along
with the Israeli.
   Kenneth Freed of the Los Angeles Times said on Israel radio he
was shown the video by the head of Colombia's security services.
   He said that in the video ``there was a man named Vladimir, who
was one of the most notorious and well-known agents of the drug
traffickers.''

<HEAD>A Fish Story, As It Turned Out</HEAD>
<HEAD>EDs: New throughout CORRECTS that Bush did not catch fish</HEAD>
<DATELINE>KENNEBUNKPORT, Maine (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   It looked as though President Bush
had finally caught a fish.
   He called media chase boats over to his speedboat Thursday to
photograph him holding a tiny pollack, indicating it didn't really
count because it was barely bigger than his lure.
   Still, it seemed maybe the president's bad-luck fishing streak
had been broken.
   But today, his staff revealed the truth. It was a friend who
caught the fish on Bush's boat Thursday evening and the
photographers had misunderstood because the president was holding it
up.
   The president, an avid athlete, has been spending his summer
vacation at his seaside home here jogging, golfing and boating.
   The fishing trip Thursday extended a steak of a fortnight with
nary a catch for the president.
   His reputation as an angler in serious trouble, Bush threw down
the gauntlet earlier Thursday.
   ``Between now and when I leave on Monday, I guarantee you, I
positively guarantee you that this jinx will be broken,'' Bush told
reporters.
   The five-inch pollack, a food fish belonging to the cod family,
bit on a lure that was almost its size.
   Bush threw it back and indicated to onlookers that the catch
didn't count against his promise to pull in a bluefish or other
gamefish.
   By the end of the day, the fishing story was taking on a life of
its own, with Bush inviting the press corps to watch him take off
for a late-afternoon fishing jaunt.
   When they arrived at the pier, the Bushes were greeted by a small
demonstration of family members and friends singing ``When the fish
come marching in,'' and chanting, ``Go For the Bluefish.''
   They jumped up and down waving signs that read, ``Fish till you
drop,'' ``You can do it,'' ``1,000 dreams of bites,'' ``A fish a day
keeps the press away.''
   Media representatives wore T-shirts reading ``Fish watch'' with a
circled fish and a line through it indicating no fish.

<HEAD>Boaters Rescue Three Whose Plane Crashed in Water After Running Out

<DATELINE>WESTERLY, R.I. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A passing pleasure boat rescued three
people who ditched their single-engine plane in Rhode Island Sound
after running out of gas, the Coast Guard said.
   The plane, flying from Block Island to Westerly, sank in 60 feet
of water Thursday afternoon, but the pilot and two passengers clung
to lobster buoys for about 15 minutes until they were rescued, said
Petty Officer William Murray of the Point Judith Coast Guard
station. No one was injured, he said.
   The pilot, Nicholas Heineman, 61, of Stamford, Conn., told the
Coast Guard a faulty fuel gauge caused him to run out of gas about
two miles south of Weekapaug Point, Murray said.
   The crash of the single-engine, six-seat Cessna 210 was reported
about 1 p.m. by a passing sailboat, Murray said. He said fishermen
aboard the Mickey II rescued Heineman and passengers John Lehman,
48, of Greenwich, Conn., and John T. Dennis, 50, of Poughkeepsie,
after they spent about 15 minutes in the 65-degree water.
   ``They were lucky that they weren't injured in the crash,''
Murray said. ``They must have had a good landing in the water to get
out of it without injury.''
   One of the passengers, an amateur photographer, wanted to try to
re-enter the wreckage to retrieve his camera, but his companions
persuaded him not to, Murray said.
   He said he did not know who owned the plane. Marianne Brown, an
attendant at the Block Island State Airport, said it was a private
plane, not one of the charter aircraft that regularly fly between
Westerly and the island.

   A Pakistani airliner with 54 people
aboard was still missing today, a week after it disappeared on a
flight over the Himalayas.
   ``We're changing the strategy of the search,'' said Pakistan
International Airlines spokeswoman Azra Sultan.
   ``Aircraft have searched every nook and cranny of the mountains
at high altitude but now we're going to concentrate on the
valleys,'' she said.
   The propeller-driven Fokker 27 failed to arrive Aug. 25 on a
one-hour flight from the northern mountain town of Gilgit to
Islamabad, the capital, 175 miles to the south.
   It carried 49 passengers, including Americans Paul McGorrian of
St. Petersburg, Fla., and Vida Sibrys of Streator, Ill., and five
crew members. The Americans were believed to be the only foreigners
aboard.
   The Pakistan air force and army, PIA, the United Nations and
private groups have conducted the largest air and ground search in
the country's history.
   Many of the mountains are covered with snow that could make
wreckage invisible from the air, PIA officials said.
   Four Pakistani aircraft have crashed in the area since 1963. An
air force C-130 was missing for three months before mountain
villagers discovered it.
   The flight over and through Pakistan's northern mountains is
known as one of the most hazardous commercial air routes in the
world. PIA pilots fly it only in clear weather.
   It offers a breathtaking view of the western Himalaya range and
the winding Indus River valley.

teachers' union employees on strike.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Strikes over pay raises, benefits and work rules are keeping more
than 3,100 teachers off the job, affecting more than 50,000 students
in five states.
   And employees of Ohio's largest teachers' union went on strike
today in a dispute over wages and other issues.
   Michigan teachers in Cheboygan and Ferndale walked out Thursday,
bringing to five the number of school districts in that state with
strikes, affecting 15,334 students.
   Other strikes idled 12,500 students in one district in Montana,
11,000 in two districts in Ohio, 7,800 in three districts in
Pennsylvania and 6,800 in an Illinois district.
   But in two Illinois districts, teachers ratified contracts
Thursday, ending strikes and also the hopes of more summer vacation
for about 13,300 students. Harlem's 350 teachers will get raises of
7 percent, 5 percent and 6 percent the next three years. Alton's 700
teachers agreed on raises of 4 percent, 5 percent and a reopening of
the contract in the third year.
   No talks were scheduled until Monday in the Quincy, Ill.,
district, where 350 teachers walked out.
   In Ohio, talks were suspended Thursday in a strike by 180
teachers affecting 3,000 Indian Creek students, and no talks were
scheduled in a walkout by 550 teachers affecting 8,000 students in
Warren.
   Meanwhile, about 90 employees of the 99,000-member Ohio Education
Association went on strike today in a dispute over wages and other
issues.
   A four-day strike by 720 teachers in Great Falls, Mont., extended
vacation for 12,500 students, but officials said they would open
schools next week with substitutes. No negotiations have been
scheduled in the dispute over salaries, career increments,
insurance, transfer policy and severance pay.
   The school board in Laurel, Mont., has postponed the opening of
school until Tuesday, idling 104 teachers and 1,900 students.
Teachers call it a lockout, but school board member Chip Lowery said
the schools were shut because no contract agreement had been reached
by last Tuesday.
   In Pennsylvania, negotiations were to begin today in a walkout
Monday by 225 teachers affecting 3,700 students in the Upper St.
Clair district. In the Big Spring district, talks were scheduled for
Tuesday in a strike by 192 teachers affecting 3,200 students.
   Elsewhere in Pennsylvania, 57 teachers in the Union School
District in Clarion County went on strike today, affecting 975
students, one day after a tentative agreement on a three-year
contract was reached in the Gov. Mifflin School District in Berks
County.

<TEXT>
   A former official with the U.S. Department of
Housing and Urban Development was paid at least $200,000 to help
lobby for HUD financing of a luxury Manhattan apartment building, a
newspaper reported today.
   New York Newsday said HUD eventually agreed to provide an $85
million mortgage for the building.
   Alexander Naclerio was hired to lobby on behalf of the Ritz Plaza
developers in 1986, 11 months after he left his job as director of
housing in HUD's New York office and as top aide to former regional
director Joseph Monticciolo, Newsday said.
   The 479 apartments in the nearly completed 44-story building in
midtown Manhattan will rent for $1,702 to $3,929 a month.
   The project would have been eligible for a $35 million Federal
Housing Administration insured mortgage, but Naclerio argued that
housing costs were higher in New York and that the developer had
purchased neighboring air rights so the Ritz Plaza could be bigger.
   HUD officials agreed to the higher mortgage, the paper reported.
   Naclerio is expected to testify about his role in the Ritz
project when he appears before the House government operations
committee, which is investigating the awarding of federal housing
subsidies under the Reagan administration.

   The Nevado del Ruiz volcano that killed
25,000 people in 1985 spouted steam and ash today, and authorities
ordered some people living nearby to leave their homes.
   The volcano, 80 miles west of Bogota, began erupting Thursday
night. Ash was drifting hundreds of miles north, according to radio
reports.
   People living along five rivers that could be flooded by melting
ice from glaciers that cling to the 16,000-foot high volcano are in
danger, the disaster emrgency office of President Virgilio Barco
said.
   About 2,300 people living along the rivers were ordered to
evacuate, the assistant director of the emergency office, Nicolas
Garcia Piedrahita, said in a broadcast interview today with the
Colombian radio network RCN.
   He said broadcast reports that towns around the volcano were
ordered evacuated were incorrect.
   On Nov. 13, 1985, the Nevado del Ruiz volcano erupted, melting
parts of glaciers. Boulders, trees and mud clogged up the Lagunillas
River. The dam eventually broke, sending a 150-foot-high wall of mud
speeding down a canyon.
   The mud shot from the canyon where it opens onto a plain and
covered the town of Armero in a matter of seconds while people slept.

<TEXT>
   The Energy Department said today it has resumed
commercial sales of tritium after investigators concluded that
missing amounts of the radioactive gas were not diverted for use in
building nuclear warheads.
   In the meantime, a team of department specialists is pressing an
investigation of missing amounts of tritium shipped from the Oak
Ridge National Laboratory in Tennessee to two British companies,
said Phil Keif, a DOE spokesman.
   Keif said discrepancies over how much tritium was shipped to
commercial customers had been resolved, except for the cases of the
British companies, Surelite and Saunders-Roe Developments Ltd. He
said department officials had discounted the possibility that the
missing amounts had been diverted to bomb production.
   ``I don't think anybody thinks that,'' Keif said.
   Tritium is used in biological and energy research and for
production of luminous lights such as those used on airport runways,
as well as signs, dials and watches. It is used in nuclear warheads
to boost the weapons' explosive power.
   The Energy Department had announced last July that it was halting
commercial sales until it could account for about 5 grams of mssing
tritium. Total annual commercial sales of the man-made gas are about
180 grams, it said.
   The decision to resume sales on a limited scale was made Aug. 16.
At the same time, a special team was formed to work out the shipment
discrepancies that had not been resolved during a two-month search
by a joint team of DOE and Nuclear Regulatory Commission officials,
Keif said.
   Keif said a series of eight tritium shipments to E.I. du Pont de
Nemours &amp; Co. for use in biomedical work started Aug. 25 and was
continuing. He said a full-scale resumption of sales would begin
sometime in September after the department had fully installed a set
of tighter controls at the Oak Ridge laboratory.
   Tritium is produced at the Savannah River nuclear reactors, near
Aiken, S.C., but all three active reactors there have been shut down
for more than a year to correct mechanical and management problems.
   DOE said Thursday that no decision will be made until spring on
an exact date for resuming tritium production. In a statement,
Energy Secretary James D. Watkins denied a Washington Post report
that he had decided to recommend to President Bush that the first of
the three reactors be restarted next July.
   ``I have made no final decision on a recommended restart schedule
for any of the department's Savannah River production reactors, and
do not intend to speculate prematurely on possible restart dates,''
Watkins said.
   Watkins also said that even after he makes a recommendation on a
proposed restart date, no exact date could be set until next spring.
Henson Moore, the deputy energy secretary, said in a telephone
interview that Watkins meant uncertainties about technical reactor
issues would probably persist for several more months.
   Moore said that while Watkins had made no final decision on a
recommendation, ``we have a target date in mind'' for restarting the
first Savannah River reactor. Moore said he couldn't disclose the
target date.
   The Post story said Watkins would tell Bush next week that
waiting another 10 months to restart the aging Savannah River
reactors would not jeopardize national security.
   Tritium production is vital to nuclear weapons production because
the gas decays at a rate of 5.5 percent a year and thus must be
regularly replenished to keep the nuclear arsenal fully ready.
   Becky McSwain, a spokeswoman for Westinghouse Savannah River Co.,
which manages the reactor complex under an Energy Department
contract, said Thursday the company would have no comment on the
Post report.
   Earlier, Ms. McSwain acknowledged that Westinghouse two months
ago had recommended to Watkins that the first of the three reactors
at Savannah River be restarted in September 1990, and that Watkins
had indicated he wanted an earlier restart.

   An earthquake struck the Patras region in
western Greece today, damaging 22 buildings but causing no injuries,
police said.
   The Athens Geodynamic Institute said the tremor, which measured
4.8 on the Richter scale, occurred shortly after midnight and was
centered 105 miles west of the capital, on the Peloponnesus
peninsula just south of the city of Patras.
   A police spokesman in Patras said that 22 buildings in the city
had been damaged. Two apartment blocks suffered cracks on the ground
floor, he said.
   He said no injuries were reported but that there was widespread
panic in the city. ``We could not believe that the earthquake was
only of magnitude 4.8,'' he said, speaking on condition of
anonymity. ``It felt much stronger, and many people spent the rest
of the night in their cars or in parks.''
   Earthquakes are frequent in western Greece, with one registering
5.9 on the Richter scale being recorded on Aug. 20 and another
registering 5.7 being recorded on Aug. 24. No damage or injuries
resulted from those quakes.
   The Richter scale is a guage of the energy released by an
earthquake, as measured by the ground motion recorded on a
seismograph.
   A magnitude 5 quake can cause considerable damage.

<HEAD>Tanker Spills Crude Oil in Delaware River</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MARCUS HOOK, Pa. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Hundreds of gallons of crude oil spilled
into the Delaware River when valves were improperly set on an oil
tanker discharging its cargo at a refinery.
   The 865-foot tanker Minerva had unloaded about 480,000 gallons of
its 500,000-gallon cargo and was preparing to take on watter as
ballast when the accident occurred Thursday, said Chuck Webster,
spokesman for the British Petroleum Refinery where the tanker was
unloading.
   Webster said about 600 gallons of crude oil was lost, covering an
8-mile-long area of water. The Coast Guard, which initially
estimated the spill at 4,200 gallons, later revised its figure to
``at least 1,000'' but added that the British Petroleum estimate
could be accurate.
   Coast Guard officials said there were no reports of affected
wildlife.
   The Coast Guard said representatives from the ship and refinery
immediately notified authorities after the spill, and Webster said
booms were lowered into the river within five minutes of the spill.
   ``About half the oil spilled was contained by a boom in the
vicinity of the ship,'' Lt. Jim Weakley said.
   The Coast Guard reported that 500 gallons of oil had been
recovered as of late Thursday.
   The Minerva is owned by Argo Dua Shipping PTE Ltd. of Singapore,
Webster said.
   It was the second spill on the Delaware in less than three
months. The first occurred June 24, when workers on the Presidente
Rivera prematurely dropped anchor, sending the Uruguayan tanker out
of control. The tanker ran aground just south of the
Pennsylvania-Delaware state line, spilling 300,000 gallons of thick
heating oil.

   The number of reported AIDS victims in the United
States rose above 100,000 last month, and more than 3,000 new cases
were recorded in other countries, the World Health Organization said
today.
   U.S. cases increased by 2,630 since WHO's last monthly update for
a new total of 100,885 by Aug. 15.
   The United States accounted for 57 percent of 177,965 reported
AIDS victims in the world. The U.S. share is declining as more cases
of the deadly virus-borne disease are reported in other countries.
   In Europe, updates raised the total of AIDS cases to 25,219.
   France, the continent's worst-hit nation, reported an increase of
740 to 7,149. Spain reported 605 new cases for a total 3,386, and
West Germany listed 139 new victims, raising its total to 3,636.
   Uganda, which has the world's second-highest number of victims,
listed 603 new cases and a total of 7,375. Zimbabwe reported the
number of cases rose to 761, up by 262.
   Somalia reported its first four cases, and Brunei registered one
victim on the WHO list.
   The statistics refer to people who are exhibiting symptoms of the
fatal disease.

   The federal prosecutor's office
today said it has charged a former U.S. Army sergeant with treason
for allegedly running an international spy ring that sold secrets to
communist East Bloc agents.
   The case of former U.S. Army Sgt. 1st Class Clyde Lee Conrad is
the first time a foreign resident living in West Germany has been
charged with treason, said Hans-Juergen Foerster, a spokesman for
the federal prosecutor's office.
   Foerster said Conrad faces a maximum sentence of life in prison
if he is convicted.
   Conrad was arrested Aug. 23, 1988, on suspicion of heading a West
German-based international spy ring with contacts in Sweden and
Vienna, Austria.
   In a statement today, Federal Prosecutor Kurt Rebmann said Conrad
is charged with ``grievous treason'' for providing classified
material to Hungarian military intelligence.
   The indictment, dated Aug. 14, has been filed with the Superior
State Court in Koblenz and also charges Conrad with ``grievous
treason in working as an agent for the Czechoslovak intelligence
service,'' the statement said.
   It said the former soldier provided military documents classified
as secret and top secret to Communist agents, including material
dealing with ``nuclear operations.''
   Conrad, a native of Sebring, Ohio, received at least $1.1 million
for his work as a spy, the statement said.
   Conrad, who retired after 20 years in the military, served with
the Army from 1965 to September 1985 and had resided in West Germany
since his discharge.
   Except for the period September 1979 through November 1980, when
he was based in the United States, Conrad served from 1975 until his
discharge with the U.S. Army's 8th Infantry Division in Bad
Kreuznach, West Germany.
   Bad Kreuznach, where Conrad continued to live after his
discharge, is about 50 miles west of Frankfurt.
   The 42-year-old Conrad was in charge of the division's classified
document center during the majority of his time with the unit.
   The federal prosecutor's statement said Conrad was introduced to
the Hungarian secret service in late autumn 1975 by his then
supervisor in the 8th Infantry Division, who it said also is being
investigated. It did not further identify or provide any other
information on the supervisor.
   The prosecutor's office said Conrad is suspected of passing
secrets to the Hungarians even after his discharge from the army and
that he ``received from the Hungarians at least ($1 million) for his
work as an agent.
   ``From 1981 through 1986, the suspect also worked for the
Czechoslovak intelligence service, to which he also supplied
photographs of secret military documents.'' Conrad received $100,000
from the Czechs, the statement said.
   A date for Conrad's trial is to be announced later by the Koblenz
superior state court, which will hear the case, the prosecutor's
office said.

<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Severe thunderstorms socked the Midwest and upper Mississippi
Valley early today, bringing large hail, high wind and heavy rain to
parts of Minnesota, Wisconsin, Illinois and Indiana.
   The storms dumped up to 7 inches of rain on northern Illinois,
knocking out power to thousands of homes and slowing travel in the
Chicago area.
   The water disrupted commuter buses and trains in Chicago, with 17
viaducts flooded on the southwest side, said Joe Daquilante, a
superintendant for the Chicago Transit Authority.
   American Airlines canceled about 40 flights that were scheduled
to leave O'Hare International Airport between 7 a.m. and 8:40 a.m.
CDT, said spokesman Tom Stack. ``A lot of that was not just because
of the storms this morning _ we still had disruptions from the
weather the night before,'' Stack said, noting that flooding around
the airport had virtually closed off much ground traffic.
   United Airlines canceled a total of 75 departures and arrivals
today at O'Hare, spokesman Rob Doughty said.
   Wind gusted to 60 mph near Rockford, Ill., to 55 mph in
Rochester, Minn., and to 52 mph at Minneapolis.
   The wind downed trees at Sharon, Wis., near the Illinois line,
and gusts blew out the windows of a house at Monon, Ind. High winds
also damaged houses at Buffalo, Ind.
   Over an inch of rain fell in a short period of time in parts of
Indiana, including Kokomo and Muncie.
   Elsewhere, 1} inches fell at Lacrosse, Wis., in about an hour.
Heavy rain flooded streets at Waseca, Minn., and at Genoa City, Wis.
   Isolated severe thunderstorms struck southwest Texas, and a few
showers and thunderstorms were over northwest Kansas and eastern
Colorado. Thunderstorms also brought heavy rain to parts of Florida
Thursday night.
   Clear skies prevailed this morning across most of the nation,
including almost all of the West and much of the Southeast.
   Today's forecast called for showers and thunderstorms extending
from the Mississippi Valley across the Appalachians to portions of
the East Coast; numerous showers and thunderstorms from the Upper
Ohio Valley and lower Great Lakes region to portions of northern New
England; scattered showers and thunderstorms over Oklahoma,
northwest Texas and New Mexico; a few showers across western
sections of Washington and Oregon.
   Predicted highs: in the 70s from the Pacific Northwest across
Montana, the Dakotas and much of the Great Lakes to northern New
England; in the 60s and 70s along the Pacific Coast, near the shores
of Lake Superior and over portions of Maine; around the 100 degree
mark over portions of Texas; between 100 and 110 degrees in the
Desert Southwest; and in the 80s and 90s across much of the rest of
the nation.
   Temperatures at 3 a.m. EDT ranged from 37 degrees at Yellowstone,
Wyo., to 92 degrees at Phoenix.

   Nonaligned nations welcomed Venezuela
into their movement today and began preparing for a summit that is
intended to salvage the waning influence of the 28-year-old
organization.
   Ministers from nonaligned countries met behind closed doors to
iron out final details of next week's summit. The group formally
accepted Venezuela as the 102nd member of the movement, the state
news agency Tanjug said.
   Nicaragua and Indonesia also put in bids to host the next summit
in 1992, conference sources said.
   The preparatory meeting that began today is to conclude on
Saturday. Ministers are expected to adopt a formal agenda for the
summit that begins Monday.
   Next week's summit will focus on ways to revamp and modernize the
movement, the role of which has declined steadily in the past decade.
   ``We are to some extent out of step with ... times that are
dynamic and wait for no one,'' Yugoslav Foreign Minister Budimir
Loncar told today's gathering.
   ``We must must catch up (and) equip ourselves for the future so
as to be able to influence it with the strength of our vision,'' he
said. Minutes later the meeting was declared closed to the media.
   In the 1970s and 1980s, countries belonging to a movement that
once prided itself on its efforts to secure international peace have
fought a series of wars against each other, culminating in the
Persian Gulf war between Iran and Iraq.
   Loncar praised Thursday's agreement between Libya and Chad, both
members of the nonaligned movement, to end their long-running
conflict over a disputed border strip by referring it to the
International Court in the Hague.
   The summit, which will last through Sept. 7, will bring together
53 heads of state and 12 prime ministers from the Middle East,
Africa, Asia and Latin America in Belgrade's modernistic Sava center.
   They include Zimbabwe's Robert Mugabe _ the current chairman of
the Nonaligned Movement _ India's Rajiv Ghandi, Cuba's Fidel Castro,
and PLO chief Yasser Arafat.
   Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi has flown in four camels to keep
him supplied with camel's milk, as well as two horses and a desert
tent to maintain his lifestyle while in Belgrade, Tanjug reported.
   Also expected to attend are observers and guests from 70 other
countries and international organizations, including U.N.
Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar.
   During the summit two separate committees of foreign ministers
will discuss political and economic dilemmas posed by mounting Third
World debt, which conference sources said now totals $1,320 billion
_ or half the total gross natinoal product of developing nations.

   An 18-year-old who concealed her pregnancy
will face trial on a charge of killing the infant she allegedly
abandoned in a trash container.
   Wendi Hawes was bound over for trial Thursday by District Judge
John T. Connolly, who reduced the charge from an open count of
murder to involuntary manslaughter.
   Police said Hawes gave birth April 9 in her room while her mother
was in the next room unaware of the delivery, and told her mother
she had the flu when her mother asked about a noise.
   ``She didn't tell her mother. She was afraid that she would lose
her mother's respect,'' said Hawes' attorney, Donald Poniatowski.
   Hawes told police she believed her son was born dead. But
forensic examiners said the boy was alive when left in the trash,
and that he bled to death after dogs pulled him from the trash and
mauled him.

   Francisco Rodriguez, a high school
classmate of Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega, was sworn in as president
today. President Bush announced there would be no diplomatic
contacts with the new government.
   In a televised ceremony at the Supreme Court, court president
Marisol Reyes de Vasquez administered the oath of office to
Rodriguez and Vice President Carlos Ozores. The proceedings were
closed to the press and diplomats.
   In a statement, Bush said the U.S. ambassador to Panama, Arthur
Davis, would not return. Davis was called back to Washington in May.
   Bush also said the administration will ``continue to take other
steps ... to deprive the illegal regime of funds that belong to the
Panamanian people.'' He did not elaborate.
   After the oath of office, Mrs. Vasquez and Rodriguez exchanged
the traditional embrace and he then donned the presidential sash.
The 10-member court attended the ceremony.
   The Council of State named the president and vice president on
Thursday. It declared that elections cannot be held until U.S.
economic sanctions and ``aggression'' end.
   The council, a body of Cabinet ministers and heads of the
military and agencies that Noriega is presumed to control, said it
will evaluate the situation in six months to determine whether
elections are possible.
   Noriega is head of the Panamanian Defense Forces, the nation's
military, and the de facto leader of Panama.
   The council said Rodriguez will head a provisional government
that will rule with a legislative commission of 41 appointed
members. It said the national legislature will be abolished and the
government will draft a new constitution.
   Rodriguez, a 50-year-old career bureaucrat, was a high school
classmate of Noriega and served in the Cabinet of the late Gen. Omar
Torrijos in the mid-1970s.
   Asked why diplomats were not invited to the swearing-in, a South
American diplomat said: ``I guess they do not want to run the chance
of being turned down by some.'' He noted that several ambassadors
had been recalled by their governments or had ``gone on vacation,''
apparently to show displeasure with the break in constitutional
procedure.
   Panamanian authorities decided to form a provisional government
after canceling the May 7 presidential election. International
observers said the opposition candidate won by a 3-1 margin, but the
government said the results were distorted by U.S. interference and
economic aid to the opposition.
   Opposition leaders have refused a government offer to share power.
   The opposition said this week that it planned no organized
protests of the new government to avoid bloodshed but that it will
continue to fight to have its election victory recognized.
   The Council of State said in a statement that it will consider
new elections only if the United States ``ends its aggression and
releases all funds'' it has frozen.
   ``Panama has suffered in the past two years the most merciless,
brutal and cruel aggression by the government of the United
States,'' the council said. ``The president of the United States, in
the use of his war powers, has decreed against Panama economic
sanctions and measures that government has never imposed against its
most bitter enemies.''
   Panama says its gross national product declined 17 percent in
1988, the worst drop since 1945, and that more than 30,000 jobs were
lost in the economic crisis aggravated by the two-year confrontation
with the United States.
   The Council of State said Panamanians must ``fight all attempts
by a foreign government to manipulate the judicial and political
organization of the Panamanian people.'' The comment was a reference
to U.S. policy not to resume relations with Panama unless Noriega is
removed from office.
   Noriega, who has been indicted on federal drug charges in
Florida, claims Washington is trying to discredit him in a plot to
renege on a treaty to return control of the Panama Canal to the
country in the year 2000, when all U.S. military installations in
Panama must be shut down.

   Col. Moammar Gadhafi, celebrating his 20th
year in power, declared his support for Panama today and said former
President Reagan has landed ``in the dustbin of history.''
   Gadhafi also took credit for inventing perestroika, the Soviet
Union's program of economic and political restructuring, and said
the state of Israel is an illegal entity.
   Gadhafi spoke at a special session of the General People's
Congress, Libya's parliament, to open the anniversary celebration
that has attracted an array of leaders from the Middle East and
revolutionary governments.
   The festivities mark the 20th anniversary of the coup that
deposed pro-Western King Idris and established Gadhafi and his
radical socialist revolution.
   The congress chanted ``one Arab people'' as Gadhafi arrived,
dressed in white slacks, a gray sports jacket, maroon shirt and a
white cape trimmed in gold.
   Gadhafi told the visiting revolutionary leaders, ``I stand with
you in the trenches.''
   Of Reagan, his former nemesis, the Libyan leader said: ``Reagan
has joined Hitler and Mussolini in the dustbin of history.''
   Gadhafi also said that ``the world must not be carved on
religious grounds,'' adding that Israel should not be a Jewish state.
   ``The Zionist entity is a strange entity left over from World War
II that must be removed the same way all the effects of World War II
have been removed,'' Gadhafi said in remarks coinciding with today's
50th anniversary of the war.
   The colonel also said Libya supports Panama and that ``we must
support people's struggles because if the people win it is a victory
for us.''
   President Hafez Assad of Syria and PLO Chairman Yasser Arafat,
who has been at odds with Gadhafi, joined in the anniversary
activities.
   Assad and Arafat sat beside each other on a platform, chatting
amicably before the session opened. Other leaders seated on the
platform included Nicaraguan President Daniel Ortega, Sudan's
military ruler Omar Hassan Ahmed el-Bashir, Algerian President
Chadli Bendjedid and Tunisia's Zine El Abidine Ben Ali.
   Ortega spoke briefly to the assembly, recalling the conflicts
both Nicaragua and Libya had with the United States under Reagan.
   ``Reagan is finished and Gadhafi continues on,'' Ortega said,
according to an unoffical translation of his comments in Spanish.
``In difficult moments he (Gadhafi) was always close. We both had
difficult moments. I owe him so much.''
   When Ortega finished, Gadhafi embraced him and then the two
clasped hands above their heads in triumph.
   The session was the first in a list of events today that included
an air show and a massive military parade through the central Green
Square, which was adorned with lights, pennants, brightly colored
helium balloons, hundreds of Libya's green flags and portraits of
Gadhafi.
   A Western diplomat, speaking on condition of anonymity, said
Libya also sent invitations to President Bush and British Prime
Minister Margaret Thatcher, whose countries accuse Gadhafi of
supporting terrorism.
   The highest-ranking Western leader to attend was Foreign Minister
Gianni de Michelis of Italy, whose participation reportedly
irritated some Western governments.
   De Michelis, in comments apparently aimed at his country's
Western allies, said Italy welcomed efforts to resolve differences
with Libya so the nations can talk ``in a climate entirely free of
suspicions of any kind of action deemed unacceptable to the
international community.''
   His attendance and that of high-ranking envoys from Egypt and
Chad underlined the success of Gadhafi's efforts in recent years to
move away from a radical, go-it-alone policy to one of cooperation
with his North African neighbors and Western Europe.
   Libya was at its most isolated in April 1986 when U.S. warplanes
bombed this Mediterranean port and Benghazi, killing an estimated 41
people, including Gadhafi's baby daughter.
   Gadhafi's adventurism over the years has created other enemies he
now wants to turn into friends, aides say.
   On Thursday, Libya and Chad announced that they had signed an
accord to end 16 years of warfare and hostilities that began when
Libyan tanks invaded northern Chad and soldiers annexed the
mineral-rich Aouzou desert strip.
   The accord calls for the countries to reach a political agreement
over the 40,000-square-mile border region within a year or turn the
dispute over to the International Court of Justice at The Hague.

<TEXT>
   Archbishop Desmond Tutu, his wife
and 34 other activists were arrested today as they began a march
protesting the alleged beating of clergy and church workers during
an anti-apartheid protest.
   The Anglican archbishop, winner of the 1984 Nobel Peace Prize,
was angered by reports that police earlier today had severely beaten
about 20 protesters from the Western Province Council of Churches.
   The clerics and churchworkers said police used batons and whips
to chase them from a security police office in Cape Town, where they
had gone to condemn recent detentions of activists.
   Later, when Tutu and the other activists left St. George's
Cathedral to begin a protest march, they encountered police who
formed a human barricade. Police told the demonstrators to disperse,
then led them into vans when they refused.
   The marchers carried placards with slogans such as ``To Hell With
Restrictions!'' and ``Stop Killing Our People!''
   Canon Winston Ndungane, chief executive officer of Anglican
Church in South Africa, said Tutu's arrest was ``a further
indication that the authorities will use whateverwork stoppages at their
factories to protest a labor law which they say cripples their power
to strike.
   One of the biggest union protests was at a Unilever Ltd. factory
in Boksburg, east of Johannesburg, where 1,000 workers marched
around the premises, many carrying placards denouncing the year-old
Labor Relations Amendment Act.
   The two main black labor federations on Thursday called on their
1.5 million members to stage protests against the act, which limits
the ability of workers to strike, during work hours today.
   The federations also joined other major anti-apartheid groups in
calling for a national protest on Tuesday and Wednesday against the
segregated parliamentary elections on Wednesday. In the past, such
protests have taken the form of a general strike.
   The same organizations have been orchestrating a campaign since
early August to challenge segregation laws and mobilize opposition
to the elections.
   On Saturday, activists plan to attempt an illegal march toward
the Parliament buildings in Cape Town, and on Sunday blacks plan to
hold a mass picnic on a whites-only beach in Durban.
   Police have arrested or detained scores of activists in the past
week and have banned at least two protest rallies planned for this
weekend, including a ``peace service'' in Soweto which was to be
addressed by Tutu.
   The Detainees Aid Center, which assists families of detainees,
said two black activists were detained Thursday in Soweto when they
made their daily appearance at a police station in accordance with
restrictions imposed when they were released from a previous stint
in detention.
   On Cape Town's outskirts, where police and militant youths have
clashed daily for several weeks, several mixed-race students
reportedly were wounded today when officers fired tear gas and
birdshot to disperse a rally.
   The independent South African Press Association quoted a teacher
as saying several students were arrested.
   Police said three mixed-race men were injured Thursday night when
a small mine exploded at a civic center in Athlone, near Cape Town.
There was no claim of responsibility.
   Police headquarters said five black men were found dead from
bullet wounds at a house in Natal Province. Much of the province has
been wracked by a three-year power stuggle pitting supporters of
militant anti-apartheid groups against members of the more
conservative Zulu political organization Inkatha.

<HEAD>U.S. Agency Might Curb Airline Buyouts</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A top Transportation Department official says
the agency is concerned about the latest flurry of takeover activity
in the U.S. airline industry and may move to block future
debt-financed buyouts and foreign purchases.
   Assistant Transportation Secretary Jeffrey N. Shane said in
interviews this week with The Wall Street Journal and The Washington
Post that the department ``will take active steps in response to the
levels of debt and levels of foreign ownership.''
   News accounts of his remarks caused airline stocks to drop
sharply Thursday, but DOT officials declined to comment on the stock
market development today.
   Shane was on vacation today and unavailable for comment. However,
a DOT official said Shane's remarks reflect the feelings of
Transportation Secretary Samuel K. Skinner, who has written letters
to airline officials expressing concern about leveraged buyouts _
the purchase of a company using its own assets as collateral for
borrowing money to complete the purchase.
   Leveraged buyouts usually result in massive debt, often forcing
cutbacks in unprofitable divisions or the selling off of others
divisions or subsidiaries to help pay off the debt.
   Federal officials are said to be concerned that heavy corporate
debts could weaken an airline's financial stability to operate
safely.
   In such a case, or if deems management incompetent, the
Transportation Department can revoke a carrier's permission to fly.
   Shane told the Wall Street Journal that the agency, which was
silent on the recent leveraged buyout of NWA Inc., the parent of
Northwest Airlines, has decided it was time to ``send a message'' to
the investment community.
   ``We want to make sure people don't go off making blind
assumptions about the ability of foreign carriers to buy big chunks
of U.S. carriers,'' Shane told the Journal in an interview published
Thursday.
   Investor Alfred Checchi bought NWA for $3.65 billion in a deal
that also involved KLM Royal Dutch Airlines.
   That sale touched off a flurry of airline stock buying, in
anticipation of further takeovers or mergers involving UAL Corp.,
Pan Am Corp. Trans World Airlines and others.
   But Shane said the Transportation Department was still reviewing
the Northwest purchase and could impose conditions that would
prevent NWA's new owners from restructuring without DOT approval.
   Under the law, foreign investors are barred from owning more than
25 percent of a carrier, but the department can object to smaller
stakes if it believes the foreign carrier is trying to exert control.
   DOT officials also say the agency's stance is limited to airlines
and is not the vanguard of a Bush administration policy turnabout on
foreign investment.

   PTL founder Jim Bakker will have full
access to the grounds at the prison facility where he is undergoing
psychological evaluation because he has not been convicted of
anything, a spokeswoman said today.
   U.S. District Judge Robert Potter suspended Bakker's fraud and
conspiracy trial in its fourth day Thursday after being told by
Bakker's attorney that his client was found cowering in a fetal
position with his head under a couch.
   Potter ordered the fallen evangelist to undergo testing at the
Federal Correction Institute in Butner to see if he is mentally
competent to stand trial.
   No specific information on Bakker's condition will be released,
Sharon Orr, a spokeswoman at the facility, said in a telephone
interview.
   ``About all I can tell you is he will go under extensive
psychological evaluation,'' Ms. Orr said. A typical evaluation takes
30 to 45 days, but ``it has not been determined at this time how
long this particular evaluation will take,'' she said.
   Meanwhile, Bakker's wife, Tammy, apparently was planning to see
her husband. A staff member at Jim and Tammy Ministries who
requested anonymity said Mrs. Bakker has left Orlando, Fla.
   Ms. Orr said Bakker had not made up a visitor list and that they
have not heard from Mrs. Bakker.
   She said Bakker would be allowed to wear street clothes, although
he was issued an orange prison jumpsuit on his arrival.
   Bakker, handcuffed and clad in the jumpsuit, was given a standing
ovation Thursday night by a large crowd of inmates when he was taken
to a mental health housing unit, the Durham Morning Herald reported
today.
   As Bakker walked past a group of patients, one of them spoke to
him and Bakker smiled back, an unidentified source at the
correctional institution told the newspaper.
   Several doctors contacted said that although someone could fake
mental illness, Bakker's symptoms are consistent with stress-induced
psychosis.
   ``Sure, you could fake it,'' said Dr. William Bakewell Jr.,
acting chairman of the University of North Carolina School of
Medicine's psychiatry department. ``But you'd have to be an awfully
good actor to sustain it.''
   On Thursday, with the jury out of the courtroom, Potter heard Dr.
Basil Jackson, a Milwaukee psychiatrist who has been treating Bakker
for nine months, say the PTL ministry founder was depressed and
hallucinating, seeing people as frightening animals out to attack
him.
   Bakker's attorney, George T. Davis, told Potter, ``If Mr. Bakker
is handled gently and carefully he may be able to proceed with this
trial.''
   The defense suggested Bakker, 49, be put in a private psychiatric
institution, but Potter ordered Bakker to the prison for up to 60
days for evaluation. Marshals transported Bakker in handcuffs and
leg shackles.
   Assistant U.S. Attorney Jerry Miller argued before the judge that
Jackson, was a ``hired gun.''
   ``It's hard to interpret it any other way other than Mr. Davis
has once again _ this time he didn't summon his client up to pray _
this time he summons a psychiatrist up to say that his client can't
go forward with the defense, and it's awfully suspect,'' Miller said.
   The jury was not told Thursday about his condition or about
Bakker's commitment. Potter told jurors the trial would not resume
before Wednesday.
   There was no call for a mistrial in court Thursday, and
prosecution and defense lawyers are under court order not to discuss
the case outside court.
   Bakker and other PTL executives are accused of diverting for
their own use more than $4 million raised from followers. If
convicted on all 24 counts, Bakker could be sentenced to 120 years
in prison and fined $5 million.
   Jackson said Bakker's condition worsened between Wednesday and
Thursday, even after he was given Xanax, an anti-depressant sedative.
   ``To put it in lay language, the man is stressed out,'' Jackson
said.
   The Charlotte Observer quoted a former PTL employee as saying
Thursday's events were a reminder of what it was like to work for
Bakker.
   ``The unpredictability, the drama of it _ what the American
judicial system is experiencing is what we experienced at PTL, the
roller coaster that we who have been around him and worked at PTL
were on,'' said Al Cress, who worked in Bakker's executive offices
in 1984-85.
   The newspaper also reported that 20 years ago, Bakker suffered a
nervous breakdown while working for Pat Robertson's TV ministry in
Portsmouth, Va.
   ``Please don't do this to me,'' a sobbing, disheveled Bakker told
U.S. marshals as they took him from his attorney's office to the
courthouse for processing of the commitment order. He curled up in a
fetal position in the back seat.
   Tammy Bakker last year described a similar scene, saying in a
fund-raising letter to supporters that her husband had stayed in a
fetal position for hours after he was forced to leave the ministry.
   Jessica Hahn, the woman whose 1980 sexual encounter with Bakker
led to Bakker's downfall, said in a 1987 Playboy interview that just
after the tryst, a fellow evangelist who had just come from Bakker's
hotel room said he was ``lying in a fetal position in his room,
saying he's happy.''

<TEXT>
   President Bush today made formal the expected
U.S. rejection of the new Panamanian government appointed by Gen.
Manuel Antonio Noriega and said he plans to tighten existing
sanctions against that country.
   As of today, the United States does not recognize any legal
authority in Panama despite its role as one of the most
strategically located countries in the world. The changed situation
is the result of Panama's disputed election process last spring.
   Bush said in a statement that the administration will ``continue
to take other steps ... to deprive the illegal regime of funds that
belong to the Panamanian people.'' He did not elaborate.
   He said the U.S. ambassador to Panama, Arthur Davis, called back
to Washington last May, will not return to Panama and there will be
no diplomatic contact with the new authorities in that country even
though the U.S. Embassy will continue to function.
   There have been no official dealings with the Noriega-dominated
government in Panama for 18 months.
   The statement came on the last day of the term of President Eric
Arturo Delvalle, who was ousted by Noriega 18 months ago but has
been recognized by the United States in exile.
   The president said the United States will continue to support
self-determination and democracy for Panama and ``counter the threat
posed by Gen. Noreiga's support for drug trafficking and other forms
of subversion.''
   ``I am confident that other governments which support human
rights, democracy and self-determination and which opppose drug
trafficking will take similar measures,'' Bush said.
   He said it was ``a sad day for Panama and for the democratic
nations of this hemisphere,'' in the wake of Noriega's invalidation
of last May's election to choose a new president who would have
taken office today.
   Observers of the balloting said it was an overwhelming victory
for Noriega's opposition despite his efforts to rig it, but the
military strongman threw out the results.
   The United States has chosen for the past year and a half not to
extend diplomatic legitimacy to the Noriega-backed government in
Panama, opting instead to continue recognizing Delvalle.
   Delvalle has wielded no authority in exile, spent much of his
time in hiding and had an almost-invisible base of support in
Panama. But his term in office was to expire today with no
acknowledged claimant as his successor.
   The highly unusual diplomatic situation arises a day after the
United States denounced Noriega as a man of ``shameless excess''
with a fortune of up to $300 million from drug smuggling and other
criminal activities.
   ``Noriega's greed, personal ambition and selfishness are the
origin, core and sustenance of Panama's crisis,'' Deputy Secretary
of State Lawrence Eagleburger told the Organization of American
States on Thursday.
   The political vacuum grows out of the decision of Panamanian
authorities to void May's presidential elections after independent
observers concluded that the anti-Noriega candidate, Guillermo
Endara, had won by a landslide.
   Speaking to the OAS, Eagleburger said Noriega's assets included a
string of mansions and other dwellings in Panama and elsewhere, as
well as various jets and three large pleasure yachts _ ``The Macho
I, Macho II and Macho III.''
   An American lawyer for Noriega, Frank Anthony Rabino, said the
case against his client, based on two 1988 Florida grand jury
indictments, was politically motivated.
   Rabino said the U.S. government is asking ``you and me and others
to use our imagination, to let our dreams run wild and maybe we'll
find something evil in Gen. Noriega if we speculate ... long and
hard.''
   Noriega's OAS ambassador, Jose Maria Cabrera, said of
Eagleburger's allegations, ``There is nothing new in this string of
inventions.''
   The State Department asked for the special OAS meeting after a
Panamanian diplomat demanded last week that the United States prove
its drug smuggling allegations against Noriega.
   In his speech, Eagleburger outlined a long list of criminal
activities he attributed to Noriega, contending that he ``protected
cocaine shipments from Medellin, Colombia, through Panama to the
United States.''
   He said that Noriega provided refuge and a base for continued
operations to the members of the Medellin cartel after the murder of
a Colombian justice minister in 1984.
   ``He agreed to protect a cocaine laboratory being constructed on
Darien Province,'' Eagleburger said. ``And he assured the safe
passage of millions of dollars of narcotics proceeds into Panamanian
banks.''
   Refusing to deal with Panamanian authorities has made it
difficult for the United States to protect its interests in Panama,
but there has been no apparent impact on the operation of the Panama
Canal.
   The United States is responsible for operating the world's most
important inter-oceanic waterway. The country also is home to 10,000
U.S. servicemen.
   Another anomaly became history Thursday when Ambassador Juan B.
Sosa, a Delvalle loyalist who has declined for 18 months to
surrender Panama's embassy in Washington to a Noriega appointee,
shut down the mission.
   With Delvalle's term expiring, Sosa said, he could no longer
claim to be the ousted president's official agent in Washington.
   Under the Panamanian constitution an ``elected president'' was to
take office today. With the May elections annulled, the
Noriega-dominated Council of State on Thursday appointed as
president Francisco Rodriguez, who has served as government
comptroller for seven years.

   Police were trying to determine
today whether drug lords ordered the slayings of five people to
retaliate for a U.S.-supported crackdown on Colombian narcotics
traffickers.
   A sixth victim of the shooting was reported in stable condition
in the San Juan Medical Center, where he was under police guard.
   The killings occurred Thursday in the third-floor offices of
Medical Collection Services, which handles accounts for medical
insurance programs, in the San Juan suburb of Rio Piedras.
   An anonymous caller to The Associated Press on Thursday claimed
responsibility on behalf of the Colombian Medellin drug cartel.
   The caller, speaking Spanish with a South American accent, said
the killings were retribution for ``the decision taken by President
Bush and his allies'' to help the Colombian government's war against
drug lords.
   He linked the killings to the jailing of six people in Puerto
Rico accused of running millions of dollars worth of cocaine for the
Medellin cartel. The six are due to stand trial this month.
   The caller said the attack ``constitutes a clear, precise and
final message that we know the (Puerto Rican) government will wisely
understand.''
   Police Superintendent Ismael Betancourt said in a radio interview
today that investigators were taking the call into consideration but
had not been able to determine its authenticity. He said no motive
had been established.
   There is no known connection between the collection agency and
the Bush administration, and investigators have raised no connection
between the shootings and the crackdown in Colombia.
   The FBI joined the investigation but had no immediate comment.
   Gov. Rafael Hernandez Colon, in a statement, said: ``This is
totally abnormal. We haven't had an attack like this here in many
years. We don't know what is behind it.''
   Jose Montanez, supervisor of the police Homicide Division, said
police had ruled out robbery because of the method of the slayings.
Also, the company did not keep a large amount of cash on hand.
   ``It was an execution, obviously,'' Montanez was quoted by the
San Juan Star. ``Everything points to that conclusion. ... It was
not a robbery.''
   He said three men and a woman were found dead in a computer room,
each with a bullet wound to the back of the head. Another man was
shot in the back of the head and died after police arrived on the
scene.
   The only survivor, Carlos Cerra, 50, had a bullet lodged in the
back of the neck but stumbled out of the office and got help.
   Police theorized that the gunmen used silencers because no one
else in the building reported hearing any shots. The office is
located above a pharmacy in busy shopping district.
   Among the dead were Edwin Perez Perez, 36, and his wife, Carmen,
also 36, who owned the business. Police identified the others as
Jorge Alberto Fuertes Betancourt, 41, and Gerardo Clavell Torres,
19, both employees; and a visiting computer-programming student,
Julio Efrain Erazo Navarrete, 27, of Ecuador.

   A judge who once jailed a mother for refusing
to turn her two children over to their father removed himself from
the custody dispute today.
   During a 30-minute hearing attended by both parents, Judge
Douglas Gray of Rockingham County Superior Court said charges that
he is biased against Jesse Murabito are ``untrue and unfounded.''
   However, ``it's important that, at the beginning of a hearing,
litigants believe they will get a fair and unbiased judge,'' Gray
said.
   ``I'm very grateful,'' Mrs. Murabito, 40, said afterward. Her
lawyers had asked Gray to step aside.
   Her ex-husband, Mark Murabito, 34, and his lawyer, Raymond
Kellett, left the courtroom quickly and refused to comment. In
court, Kellett urged Gray to stay in the case, citing possible
delays if he didn't.
   As the judge in the couple's divorce case in 1986 and 1987, Gray
heard _ and rejected _ testimony on allegations that Murabito
sexually abused his daughter, now 6. When Mrs. Murabito hid the girl
and her brother, now 4, to block court-approved visits with their
father, Gray jailed her for a week.
   Early last year, Murabito was charged with felonious sexual
assault against his daughter. A superior court jury rejected the
allegations, which stemmed from incidents after the divorce.
   The day of her ex-husband's acquittal, Mrs. Murabito fled with
the children. With the help of a national underground network set up
for women in her situation, she avoided detection for nine months.
   Gray, meanwhile, awarded Mark Murabito legal custody of the
children.
   Mrs. Murabito and the children, living under assumed names, were
found last month in tiny Loma, Mont. Authorities seized the children
and returned them to New Hampshire, where Gray was to review the
custody dispute.
   Before stepping out of the case, Gray today ordered that the
Murabitos' children remain in foster care and that each parent
continue to have supervised visits.

   Prince Andrew and the Duchess of York danced
into the early hours Friday to the music of Peter Duchin's orchestra
at a glittering gala organized by Save Venice Inc., a U.S.-based
group raising money for preserving the art treasures of the lagoon
city.
   The presence of the British royalty among the crowd of 400
international guests caused a few headaches for organizers.
   Tight security by Italian and British police kept at bay dozens
of impatient ``paparazzi.'' But it also delayed the program and
bottled up a fleet of motorboats whisking guests between exclusive
Venetian hotels, the Palazzo Volpi and the Palazzo Pisani Moretta,
site of the dinner and ball.
   Dozens of policemen patrolled the palazzi and nearby alleys while
divers inspected the canals.
   At Palazzo Volpi, Andrew, his wife, Sarah, and the other guests
attended a party organized by the Bulgaris, the Roman jewel
designers who exhibited some of their expensive necklaces and
bracelets.
   For the occasion, Nicola and Paolo Bulgari gave an American
family from Philadelphia a golden brooch worth more than $3,000.
   The jewel _ a lion head symbol of Venice _ went to Amory
Schwartz, a 27-year-old art historian who won an art ``treasure
hunt'' through the city. His team included his sister, Susan, and
parents, Michelle and Gordon Schwartz.
   The $1,500-a-person dinner and ball ended the second biennial
Regatta Week, organized by the U.S. group prior to the traditional
gondola race through Venice canals on Sept. 3.
   The four-day festival included private parties, concerts and art
tours in Venice and nearby Vicenza.
   Organizers said they raised more than $450,000, which will
finance restoration of the church of Santa Maria dei Miracoli and of
lunettes, paintings and marbles in the churches of San Salvador, San
Giobbe and San Giovanni in Bragora.
   In 1987, the first edition of the Save Venice gala raised
$400,000.
   Prince Andrew and his wife, the former Sarah Ferguson, reportedly
made a donation to the fund. They arrived in Venice Wednesday and
were guests at the luxury hotel Cipriani.
   The duchess smiled but exchanged only a few words with other
guests at the gala. They left shortly before 1 a.m. while the ball
continued until 2:30 a.m. in the candlelight of the frescoed palace.
   Other VIPs included Paloma Picasso, daughter of the late painter
Pablo Picasso; Patricia S. Patterson, New York political and social
figure and chairman of the gala; socialites Mr. and Mrs. Vernon
Taylor of Denver, and Mrs. Harry de Wildt of San Francisco; Mr. and
Mrs. Winston Fowkles III, executive of Time-Life; Marife Hernandez,
former chief of protocol under Jimmy Carter; Laurence D. Lovett,
president of Save Venice; Mr. and Mrs. Austin Hearst of the Hearst
publishing family; Prince Egon and Princess Lyn von Furstenberg; and
Count and Countess Loredan, descendants of Venetian doges.

   A team of 100 people in Bangkok have
baked a 3{-ton Chinese mooncake, which they say is the largest ever
made.
   Mooncakes, made of sweet pastry and decorated with Chinese
characters, are traditionally given as symbols of good will in
Chinese communities to mark the lunar festival.
   The festival, Sept. 14, commemorates Chinese Empress Chang Euh,
who according to legend, ascended to the moon to watch over the
world and protect it from tyranny.
   The mooncake unveiled Thursday was baked at a Bangkok department
store by chefs from the Shangarila Restaurant. It measures 22 feet
in diameter and is 5 inches high, organizers said.
   Chefs beat 5,000 eggs, sifted 1,232 pounds of flour and added 220
pounds of watermelon seeds and 88 pounds of sugar. They also mixed
in more than 2 tons of durian, a pungent tropical fruit.
   The giant cake has to cool for 48 hours before it can be cut up
and sold on Sunday. It is expected to be divided into 10,000 pieces,
which will sell for $3.50 each, with the proceeds going to charity.

<TEXT>
   The consumption of dog meat is on the
rise in South Korea, surpassed only by pork and beef, reports said
Friday.
   A government survey published by the Kookmin Ilbo newspaper
showed the eating of dog meat has increased sharply since the 1988
Summer Olympics, when restaurants were told not to serve it for fear
of alienating foreign tourists.
   The newspaper said the survey was presented Thursday during
working-level talks involving several government agencies. It said
the talks centered on whether to recognize eating of dog as an
indigenous habit.
   Government officials, sensitive about such queries in the past,
refused to confirm or deny the meeting took place.
   Shin Koo-bum, director general for livestock at the Ministry of
Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries, was quoted as saying the
increase in dog meat consumption contributed to a sharp drop in
consumption of beef.
   Dog meat is less expensive than beef, much of which is imported
from the United States, Australia and New Zealand.
   Shim said the amount of dog meat consumed in 1989 was expected to
reach 33,000 tons, compared with 460,000 tons of pork and 136,000
tons of beef.
   ``The government cannot remain silent and is pressed to work out
certain measures about dog meat,'' Shim was quoted as saying.
   The newspaper said Shim proposed lifting restrictions on
restaurants serving dog meat. Since the Olympics, they have been
told to limit operations and not serve foreigners.
   ``We don't have to consider dog meat distasteful or disagreeable
any more,'' said a businessman who frequently visits dog meat
restaurants in downtown Seoul.
   Many South Koreans believe dog meat is a good source of protein
and has a delicate taste. They also say protests by foreigners are
based on a misunderstanding that South Koreans eat their pets, when
instead dogs are bred for meat.
   Dog meat often is sold in tents or open air restaurants along
hillsides and streams on the outskirts of Seoul on weekends.

   The suspected gunman in the slaying of a black
teen-ager who was confronted by a white gang pleaded innocent to
murder today, a day after 7,500 marchers protesting the slaying
clashed with police at the foot of the Brooklyn Bridge.
   Joseph Fama, 18, was ordered held without bail by Brooklyn
Criminal Judge Neil Firetog. A prosecutor told Firetog witnesses saw
Fama fire several shots from close range at Yusuf Hawkins Aug. 23.
   ``Joseph is not guilty of all the charges,'' his attorney, David
DePetris, told Firetog. Fama, wearing jeans and a sweatshirt, stood
silently during the hearing.
   Fama, who had been the subject of a weeklong manhunt, was charged
late Thursday after he surrendered earlier in the day to police in
Oneonta, near Albany, said Chief of Detectives Joseph Colangelo.
   Police estimated Thursday's protest drew 7,500 people _ by far
the largest demonstration since Hawkins, 16, was killed in a racial
attack in the predominately white Brooklyn neighborhood of
Bensonhurst.
   ``This was an absolute success!'' proclaimed Sonny Carson, a
protest leader. ``This will make the city wake up. This will let the
city know that there are young black people who will not take this
any more.''
   The march was orderly until those at the front reached barricades
police erected to keep demonstrators off the bridge's roadways
during the evening rush hour. Demonstrators threw bottles and bricks
and police responded with nightsticks as marchers shouted, ``Take
the bridge, take the bridge!''
   Twenty-three police officers were injured, none seriously, police
said. An unknown number of others were injured.
   Four people were arrested for disorderly conduct and harassment;
two also were charged with assault.
   Billed as a ``day of outrage and mourning,'' the protest came a
day after Hawkins' funeral, and just hours after Fama returned to
Brooklyn under tight security.
   Other charges against Fama included two counts of criminal
possession of a weapon, first-degree assault, first-degree riot,
aggravated harassment, civil rights violation and menacing in
connection with Hawkins' death last week.
   The six other suspects charged in the attack are all free on bail.
   Hawkins was shot twice in the chest after he and three black
friends, answering a used-car ad, encountered a mob of 10 to 30
whites. The attackers, carrying bats and golf clubs, were said to be
spurred by a neighborhood girl's interracial dating.
   The slaying inflamed racial tensions in the city just as Mayor
Edward I. Koch faces a strong challenge in the Sept. 12 Democratic
mayoral primary from a black candidate, Manhattan Borough President
David Dinkins.
   Spike Lee, the writer, director and co-star of ``Do the Right
Thing,'' a movie about racial violence in Brooklyn, argued in a
guest column today in the Daily News for making Hawkins' death an
election issue.
   ``The atmosphere of hate in this city has everything to do with
who is occupying the mayor's chair,'' Lee wrote. ``The man sitting
there now has to go, plain and simple.''
   As the demonstration began, marchers near the front carried two
coffins, one symbolizing Hawkins and the other Huey P. Newton, the
former Black Panther leader who was shot to death last week in a
drug-ridden neighborhood of Oakland, Calif.
   Newton's name was seldom mentioned once the march began, while
the crowd constantly filled the air with shouts of ``Yusuf, Yusuf!''
   People coming from work and onlookers swelled the procession as
it passed through downtown Brooklyn during evening rush hour.
   The march was orderly but vocal and defiant. Monitors with
megaphones kept discipline and led chants of ``No more!'' and
``Whose street? Our street!''
   After marchers overran police barricades at the Brooklyn Bridge,
they poured onto its roadways and blocked traffic.
   Police defused the demonstration at 7:30 p.m. by agreeing to
release one march leader from custody in exchange for ending the
march, said Chief Thomas Gallagher.
   Asked why police did not let the marchers cross the bridge,
Gallagher replied, ``At some point, you have to draw the line, plus
it was dangerous to the demonstrators and to the people in traffic.''

   A mysterious ailment that sent a juror in the
McMartin preschool molestation trial to the hospital has the
presiding judge worried the longest criminal trial in U.S. history
could end in a mistrial.
   Five of the original six alternate jurors have been excused
because of illness and job problems during the trial, now in its
third year. If the ill juror drops out, the last remaining alternate
would replace him, and if one more juror leaves, a mistrial would
end the case without a verdict.
   ``We have to have 12 of you to try this case,'' Superior Court
Judge William Pounders told the panelists who sat in the jury box
with one chair empty Thursday. ``If we're down to the final 12,
we're in desperate straits.''
   Pounders recessed the case until Sept. 11 to await a diagnosis of
the juror's problem and determine whether he will be able to return
to court.
   The jurors have been hearing testimony on charges against Raymond
Buckey, 31, and his mother, Peggy McMartin Buckey, 62, who are named
in 64 counts of molestation and a shared count of conspiracy in a
series of allegations linked to their now defunct McMartin
Pre-School in Manhattan Beach.
   The defense rested last week and the prosecution began calling
rebuttal witnesses.
   The judge did not describe the ill juror's symptoms but said
pathology reports have not yet diagnosed the cause.
   Pounders said he would try to take advantage of the latest delay
by working with attorneys on jury instructions. He said he wants to
submit the case to jurors by December.

   The state attorney general said he will not
prosecute anyone in the 1988 death of a cadet at a police training
academy who died of heat stroke after a day of rigorous exercise.
   The death of Timothy Shepard, 25, of Pittsfield was ``tragic and
avoidable,'' but ``there is no one who can be fairly and responsibly
charged with criminal culpability,'' General James Shannon Shannon
said Thursday.
   He told Shepard's widow, Holly Shepard, and other family members
of his decision before making it public.
   Springfield District Judge Irving J. Goldblatt, who conducted a
two-month inquest into the death, had recommended that charges be
brought against two administrators and an instructor.
   Shepard and other cadets collapsed of heat stroke last Sept. 19
at the police training academy at Agawam. Shepard was the sickest of
the 16 cadets who were hospitalized with exhaustion and dehydration
following a grueling regimen of pushups, confusion drills and
punishment laps. He died Nov. 2.
   ``It makes no sense that he's not going to pursue this. It's
ludicrous, absolutely ludicrous,'' said Mrs. Shepard. She said a
civil suit is now inevitable.
   ``I do not condone the treatment of Timothy Shepard and the other
cadets of Class 12. I despise it,'' Shannon said. ``But I must not
be driven by vengeance. I cannot shape the law to fit my feelings or
the feelings and the irreplaceable loss of others.''
   Evidence showed that the cadets, on the first day of training to
be municipal police officers, participated in physically and
mentally grueling exercises and had limited opportunities to drink
water on a hot, humid day.
   Goldblatt recommended that involuntary manslaughter charges be
sought against Earl Harrington, former director of the Agawam police
academy; Gary F. Egan, former executive director of the state
Criminal Justice Training Council, and State Police Trooper C. Blake
Gilmore, who served as commandant of the state-run academy.
   ``Don't take it from me. Take it from Judge Goldblatt,'' said
Michael Hashim Jr., the family's lawyer. ``He came to a finding
there was probable cause for a finding of involuntry manslaughter to
be brought. For Jim Shannon to toss it aside ... in my opinion, it
just leaves me speechless.''
   Timothy Burke, general counsel for the Massachusetts State Police
Association, said he was pleased by Shannon's decision.
   ``As the factual circumstances reveal, there was never any
intention on the part of any of the state police officers involved
in the training to in any way harm the cadets present on Day One,''
he said.

   A hailstorm killed 26 people and injured 74 in
southwestern Guizhou province, which also has suffered severe
drought this summer, the official Xinhua News Agency said Friday.
   Storms in recent days have damaged 9,791 homes and 41,990 acres
of crops, the report said. It did not say when the storms began or
how the victims were killed or injured.
   Since July, the province has been suffering from severe drought
that has parched 2.79 million acres of farmland. More than 3.5
million people and 1.33 million domestic animals lack drinking
water, the news agency said.
   Authorities have raised $13.4 million to help disaster victims.
   Drought has hit from southwestern China's Sichuan province to the
northern cities of Beijing and Tianjin. East China's Shandong
province has been hit with its worst drought in 40 years, parching
half of its farmland.
   Earlier this summer, severe flooding killed about 1,800 people.
   U.S. Ambassador James Lilley on Friday presented Chinese
officials with a $25,000 check to provide medicine and medical
supplies to flood victims. Aid also has come from from the European
Comunity, which donated $550,000.

<UNK>News Says FAA Warns Airlines of Possible Terrorist Attack</UNK>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A warning of possible terrorist action was issued
this week to airlines in the United States by the Federal Aviation
Administration, a newspaper reported Friday.
   The Daily News said the warning was contained in a general
bulletin from the FAA that said a radical Palestinian group might be
planning an attack.
   ``The timing, location and the nature of the alleged attack is
unknown,'' the News quoted the bulletin as saying. It said
information about the possible attack came from the FBI's New York
office.
   FAA spokesmen in New York and Washington declined to comment.
Spokesman John Leyden said the agency's rules forbid discussing
bulletins but added that 30 such bulletins were issued last year.
   The warnings go to airlines, but are not circulated to the
general public, a policy that drew criticism in the wake of the
December bombing of a Pan Am jetliner that crashed in Scotland,
killing 270 people. Such a bulletin had been circulated before that
crash.
   FBI spokesman Joseph Valiquette said he could not comment on the
report.
   At Kennedy International Airport, installation of an FAA-mandated
detector to check baggage for plastic explosives was proceeding at
the TWA terminal, said Diane Spitaliere of the FAA's New York office.
   The device, known as a Thermal Neutron Analysis system, is
undergoing testing and calibration in an area where visitors are now
forbidden. The FAA plans a public unveiling later in the month,
Spitaliere said.
   The FAA announced Wednesday in Washington that it has acquired
six models of the TNA detector and by the end of the year the other
five would be operating in Detroit, Miami, San Francisco, London and
Frankfurt, West Germany.
   The FAA announcement said another 34 airports among the world's
busiest also will be required to install explosives detectors.

   Georgia's attorney general supports a
quadriplegic's request to turn off the respirator that keeps him
alive.
   Larry James McAfee, 33, wants a Fulton Superior Court judge to
let him activate a timer with his mouth that will turn off a
ventilator he has used since his neck was broken in a 1985
motorcycle accident.
   McAfee ``has both a constitutional and statutory right to refuse
medical treatment,'' Attorney General Michael J. Bowers said in
court papers filed Thursday.
   ``The fact that the exercise of his rights may result in
petitioner's death is a consequence to be considered by him, not an
invitation for the state to abridge his right to free choice,''
Bowers wrote.
   ``While suicide has enjoyed fervent debate among religious,
ethical, legal and medical scholars, it is not a crime in Georgia,''
Bowers wrote.
   Judge Edward H. Johnson scheduled a hearing Wednesday on McAfee's
petition. Last week, Johnson made Bowers a party to the case so the
state's position would be considered in the decision.
   Johnson conducted a bedside hearing two weeks ago to hear
McAfee's testimony before he was transferred from Grady Memorial
Hospital to a nursing home in Alabaster, Ala.

   An arsonist torched a foster home and the
blaze killed four children and injured 12 people, fire officials
said.
   Neighbors said they woke up shortly before 3 a.m. Thursday
smelling smoke and hearing children yelling.
   ``It was a nightmare,'' said Frank Hart, a neighbor who woke to
see the house in flames but managed to help six people to safety.
   ``People were jumping from the second and third floor,'' he said.
``There was blood and people with broken bones and charred bodies
all around.''
   The fire, which was started on an enclosed porch, was the work of
an arsonist, said fire Lt. Jack Christmas.
   Kenneth Postell, 24, who lived on the third floor, said when he
awoke he saw a ``big huge smoke ball'' in his room. He said he
jumped to a second-floor roof and from there to the ground. Postell
and a child were the only ones to escape injury.
   When firefighters arrived at the large three-story
stone-and-frame house, they found heavy fire in the first floor and
people trapped upstairs. The fire was under control by 3:20 a.m.,
firefighters said.
   Seventeen people lived in the house, according to firefighters.
The children who died were found on the second floor. Police
identified them as Keith Moye, 7, and his brother, Preston Moye, 5;
Anwar Hartwell, 9, and Robert Lavenhouse, 15.
   The house belonged to Hubert and Rose Artis, a couple who took in
foster children and had lived there for about 13 years.
   Mrs. Artis, 65, was in critical condition at Albert Einstein
Medical Center with multiple fractures and smoke inhalation. Hubert
Artis, 65, was in stable condition at Temple University Hospital
suffering from smoke inhalation.

   Leaders of the once-banned Solidarity
movement flanked President Wojciech Jaruzelski today as he paid
homage to the small Polish garrison in this Baltic port that bore
the first fierce Nazi onslaught of World War II.
   In the remarkable and apparently unplanned display of national
unity, joining Jaruzelski at the 50th anniversary ceremony were
Solidarity leader Lech Walesa and newly elected Prime Minister
Tadeusz Mazowiecki, a longtime Solidarity activist.
   ``On this day of great national memories we look not only into
the past but also into the future, into the near future and that
which is still far ahead,'' Jaruzelski said.
   ``We should never again be weak, quarreling or isolated,'' he
said. ``Tomorrow Poland must be stronger than today, through its
economic potential and most of all through mutual effort, agreement
and national reconciliation.''
   Jaruzelski and Mazowiecki were to return later to Warsaw, where a
day of world prayer for peace was planned. Also scheduled was an
internationally broadcast concert for peace led by American
conductor-composer Leonard Bernstein at the city's Grand Theater.
   As Jaruzelski spoke at Westerplatte, standing by were 53 veterans
of the legendary Polish garrison on the small peninsula who endured
the guns of the German warship Schleswig-Holstein and staved off a
determined infantry assault for seven days.
   World War II began with the battleship's opening salvo on
Westerplatte, a Polish outpost in then pro-German Free City of
Danzig, at 4:45 a.m. on Sept. 1, 1939.
   At dozens of points along the Polish frontier, the Nazi
``blitzkrieg'' began without warning. A lightning-fast Panzer-led
invasion by 1.5 million German troops obliterated the last organized
Polish army units by Oct. 5.
   Britain and France, after demanding the Germans withdraw, honored
treaty obligations and declared war on Hitler on Sept. 3.
   The stubborn resistance of the 182 Polish soldiers on
Westerplatte, isolated from the rest of Poland, served as an
inspiration for Poles who continued the battle against Hitler until
the march into Berlin nearly six years later.
   Mazowiecki was scheduled to be at the ceremony today, but
Walesa's presence was apparently a spontaneous decision. ``Simple
courtesy requires it,'' he said.
   Walesa, Mazowiecki and Senate Speaker Andrzej Stelmachowski _
another Solidarity activist _ earlier visited the workers monument
erected by the free trade union in 1980 in front of the Lenin
Shipyard where it was born.
   Mazowiecki was in Warsaw on Thursday to continue delicate
negotiations on forming his new government while Solidarity marked
the ninth anniversary of the accords that founded the East bloc's
first legal independent union.
   Today, several hundred supporters sang ``May He Live 100 Years''
to the prime minister as he walked to the monument with Walesa,
their hands raised in the V-for-victory sign.
   Mazowiecki laid red-and-white flowers at the towering columns
dedicated to workers killed during riots along the Baltic coast in
1970.
   Then they bowed to the crowd and Walesa led the singing of the
Polish national anthem.
   As the leaders made their way back to their cars en route to
Westerplatte, the crowd started chanting ``Mazowiecki, Mazowiecki''
and reached out to touch the prime miniser.
   Stelmachowski, taking in the sight of the former political
prisoners now celebrating their victories against Communist control,
said: ``I still have an impression that I am playing a strange part
in a very strange theater.''
   In Warsaw meanwhile, Walter Momper, the governing mayor of
Berlin, visited the monument to the final desperate uprising in the
Jewish ghetto in 1943.
   ``For us as Germans, it is always necessary that we come here and
remember what happened to the ghetto,'' said Momper.
   The Solidarity-dominated Polish Senate adopted a statement on the
war that said the anniversary should be a day of ``new horizons of
reconciliation.''
   ``More than 6 million Polish citizens lost their lives on the
battlefield, as victims of premeditated extermination, or in slave
labor in Nazi concentration camps and Stalin's Gulag,'' the Senate
said.
   Nearly one out of every five Poles living in 1939 died in the
war. The victims included 3 million Polish Jews, 15,000 Polish
officers believed massacred on Stalin's orders at Katyn and
elsewhere in the Soviet Union, 200,000 residents of Warsaw who died
in the capital's doomed 1944 uprising and boy and girl scouts who
organized underground resistance units.

   A man who police say intentionally ran
his family station wagon into the Detroit River, killing his four
young children, was ordered today to stand trial on murder charges.
   Lawrence DeLisle, 28, was bound over to Wayne County Circuit
Court on four counts of first-degree murder in the deaths of his
children, Bryan, 8, Melissa, 4, Kathryn, 2, and Emily, 8 months. He
also will stand trial on a count of attempting to murder his wife,
Suzanne.
   No trial was set; Circuit Court arraignment was scheduled for
Sept. 14.
   DeLisle was calm when Wyandotte District Judge Lawrence Emmert
ordered the trial. Emmert made his decision after hearing two days
of testimony, including questioning of Mrs. DeLisle.
   Mrs. DeLisle said she tried to rescue her children from the car
after it crashed into the river Aug. 3. She said she screamed for
help when she escaped through a car window and swam to the surface
of the water, and that her husband, who had emerged a few seconds
earlier, was quiet and appeared in shock.
   She testified Thursday that her husband said a leg cramp caused
him to jam down on the accelerator. She said she tried to grab the
steering wheel and turn off the ignition when the car sped down the
street and through wooden barriers into the river.
   Police have said DeLisle told them he deliberately ran the car
into the river because of financial and family problems. Mrs.
DeLisle says her husband was coerced into the admission.
   Bryan Ross, who was boating in the river at the time of the
accident, testified that when he saw Lawrence DeLisle float to the
top, he threw him a ski jacket as a life preserver.
   Ross said he saw Mrs. DeLisle surface a few seconds later
screaming, ``My babies, my babies.''

<HEAD>Central Committee Session Meets Amid Party Divisions</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BUDAPEST, Hungary (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Hungary's top communists, divided over
the pace of reform and the move to a multiparty system, met in a
closed-door Central Committee session Friday.
   No formal agenda was announced, but political observers expected
the 108-member Central Committee to debate the increasingly open
rifts between reformers and orthodox communists, which some analysts
predict could lead to a formal split in party ranks at a national
party congress scheduled for Oct. 6.
   The four-man leadership named in June to run the party until the
congress formulates new policies in October is divided over
multiparty elections scheduled to occurr before next June and
negotiations with the opposition on how to run the ballots.
   Party General Secretary Karoly Grosz, a centrist who lost power
in the June reshuffle, has said he may quit altogether.
   Party president Rezso Nyers, who says he is ``first among
equals'' in the four-man leadership, has differed publicly with
leading reformer Imre Pozsgay over whether or not political parties
can continue to be active at workplaces.
   Opposition groups negotiating constitutional reform and a new
election law with the communists have demanded that political
parties be banned from workplaces.
   The communists, who for four decades have maintained extensive
organizations at factories and farms, are stalling on the demand,
and Nyers criticized a compromise put forward by Pozsgay.
   Popular with the opposition, Pozsgay is under fire from some
communists and opposition activists who suspect he is behind an
official youth league move to create a revamped, more powerful
presidency _ a post he is said to want.
   The communists and opposition also are at odds over what to do
with properties owned by the Communist Party, which the opposition
says should be shared among all political parties. The communists
insist the buildings are solely their property.
   Another obstacle to elections emerged this week when the official
trade union organization said it was pulling out of the forum, which
brings together the communists, opposition groups and social
organizations.
   Magda Kovacs-Kosa, a member of the trade union delegation at the
talks, told the Hungarian news agency MTI Wednesday the trade unions
pulled out because economic issues are being largely ignored at the
talks.
   This could isolate millions of Hungarian workers, who are more
concerned with rising prices and falling living standards than with
political reform, she indicated.

<HEAD>Manufacturer Substituted Brand-Name Version for Testing</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: Inserts new 7th graf, Meanwhile, Bolar, with ad defending Bolar</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   One of nation's largest producers of generic
drugs repeatedly sent the brand-name version of a widely prescribed
anti-psychotic drug to a lab for testing in place of its own generic
version, according to a report published today.
   However, the president of Bolar Pharmaceutical Co. of Copiague,
N.Y., called the 1982 incident ``unfortunate,'' and said there was
no ``malicious or fraudulent intent.''
   The Washington Post reported that Bolar on three occasions sent
brand-name Mellaril to Pharmakinetics Laboratory Inc. for testing
instead of its generic version of thioridazine.
   ``My technical staff has concluded that the tablets which you set
for the bioequivalence study are not of your production,'' Alan G.
Woodman, who was president of Pharmakinetics, said in a letter to
Bolar Vice President Jack Rivers.
   Excerpts of the letter were published in the Post today, four
days after the Food and Drug Administration proposed removing from
the market Bolar's generic version of Dyazide, a drug for treating
high blood pressure.
   The FDA said it ``has not been able to fully establish'' that
Bolar's generic version is as effective as Dyazide.
   Meantime, Bolar employees took out a full-page advertisement in
today's New York Times to defend the company's management as
``reputable, honest and caring.'' The ad also expressed outrage over
the ``climate of fear and distrust'' within the generic drug
industry it said was created by a House investigations subcommittee
``because of the fraudulent deeds of a few.''
   To win FDA approval of generic drugs, manufacturers must submit
them for tests by independent laboratories.
   The Post quoted Pharmakinetics officials as saying they became
suspicious that Bolar was switching samples after the outer coating
of tablets sent for testing began to chip and the logo of Sandoz
Ltd., the manufacturer of Mellaril, became visible.
   A second sample was requested, according to Woodman's letter, and
it also proved to be recoated Sandoz tablets. It was only after the
third sample, according to the letter, that Woodman complained in
writing to Bolar.
   ``Pharmakinetics is not the keeper of morality in the
pharmaceutical industry,'' Woodman said in the letter to Rivers.
   ``But Jack, you are an important part of an American success
story, and it's our opinion that the exposure you place yourself and
your company by pursuing this course of action far outweighs any
possible benefit which may accrue to you or the company.''
   Bolar president Robert Shulman told the newspaper that samples of
the brand-name drug were substituted for his company's generic
version, but he said it was the result of a ``silly error,'' when
copies of the Sandoz drug were ``inadvertently mixed in.''
   ``This was an unfortunate, isolated incident of a manufacturing
error,'' he said. ``There was no malicious or fraudulent intent.''
   Bolar's product was approved by the FDA after the company
submitted for testing thioridazine tablets of different size, shape
and weight than the Sandoz product.

   Behind the slogans and political
maneuvers highlighting ethnic tension in Soviet republics is the
hurt and confusion of transplanted Russians who fear being uprooted
from their homes.
   As colonizers, exiles, scientific and economic specialists,
Russians have been settling in Moldavia, the Baltics, and other
non-Russian areas for more than 100 years _ both before and after
the Bolshevik Revolution.
   In a period of heightened ethnic feelings as the Soviet Union's
minorities review what decades of Soviet rule have brought, much of
the anger and frustration is directed at the Russians next door.
   Many of them never learned the local language because it never
has been much of an issue in a land dominated by Moscow. But in a
society that is becoming rapidly polarized by demands for greater
local sovereignty, language has become the first and greatest
indicator of who is who.
   ``Today it's a law on language, tomorrow on citizenship and the
day after on residency,'' Russian-language teacher Raisa Kochetova
complained to the Moldavian Supreme Soviet, or parliament, as it
began its debate Tuesday on a law making Moldavian the official
language of the republic.
   Moldavia on Thursday joined other republics that have passed
language laws. The Baltics have followed with legislation restoring
national flags, economic and political sovereignty, and immigration
restrictions. Estonia went the furthest by setting strict residency
requirements for voting and running for office.
   No nationalist group has called for Russians and others to be
thrown out of their republics. In Latvia, the independence movement
is taking applications from ethnic Latvians, Russians, and everyone
else for citizenship in an independent republic.
   But the immigrants are worried that some slogans of ethnic
protesters demanding they leave will become the policy of powerful
new political movements.
   ``We read stories about apartheid in South Africa, where people
are barred from any work except manual labor if their skin is the
wrong color,'' said Pyotr Zalozhnikov, 45, a Russian worker and
member of a strike committee in the Moldavian city of Tiraspol.
   ``This is what this law would do to all people here who are not
Moldavian. In one day we'll be made deaf-mutes. Our children will
have no future,'' he said by telephone.
   Non-Moldavian workers are feeling the same pressures as
non-Estonians did in that Baltic republic. They reacted the same
way, by walking off their jobs.
   In both republics, the proportion of Russians and non-native
population is less than 40 percent.
   Zalozhnikov echoed the concern for his children expressed by
Nikolai Chugunov, a 42-year-old Russian who has lived in Estonia for
33 years. Although he was not affected by the residency requirements
approved by the Estonian government, he said he was worried about
what steps officials would take next.
   Mihai Ghimpu, one of the top officials in the Moldavian People's
Front, said a language law would change mean nothing for the average
worker. ``For workers, life won't change at all,'' he said in an
interview.
   But partly to demonstrate the view that their lands were taken by
force and partly to preserve the language and culture from the
encroachment of Russian, ethnic leaders insist their language must
be the official one.
   The republics' painful history of incorporation into the Soviet
Union makes many people regard the Slavic population with suspicion.
   When hundreds of thousands of Estonians, Lithuanians, Latvians
and Moldavians were shot or deported as Stalin extended his control
over their lands in the 1940s, they were replaced by Slavs who the
dictator regarded as more reliable.
   Ethnic activists argue that the immigration has continued since
then, either as a predetermined policy to weaken the local
population, or to take advantage of better living conditions on the
Soviet Union's western frontier.
   But many go back much further.
   In the early 19th century, the great Russian poet Alexander
Pushkin was exiled to Kishinev, in what was then the Russian
territory of Bessarabia.
   In 1903, Pyotr Shornikov's grandfather, a factory worker, was
exiled to Moldavia for participating in a strike. He stayed there
when Moldavia became part of Romania after World War I.
   Shornikov has lived in Moldavia all his life, became an
historian, and says he speaks fluent Moldavian. A Russian, he is one
of the leaders of the group Yedinstvo, which is fighting for the
rights of non-Moldavians.
   He rejects the argument that Moldavia is being inundated with a
new wave of immigrants. Kishinev, the capital, was about 47 percent
ethnic Moldavian in the years 1850-90, compared with the 43 percent
Moldavian population now, he said.

<HEAD>Medicare Would Pay for Mammography Tests Under Proposed Rule</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Medicare will pay for routine mammography tests
to detect breast cancer beginning Jan. 1, under a regulation the
government proposed Friday.
   Congress authorized Medicare coverage of mammography examinations
last year, making an exception to the law that prohibits Medicare
payments for routine physical checkups.
   One out of 10 women will develop breast cancer in their
lifetimes, according to medical experts, and elderly women have the
highest risk.
   ``Early detection of breast cancer is essential for effective
treatment, and Medicare coverage will encourage more older women to
obtain mammography screening on a regular basis,'' said Dr. Louis
Sullivan, secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services.
   The regulation, drafted by HHS, was published in Friday's Federal
Register. After 60 days of public comment, a final regulation will
be drafted.
   Under the law, Medicare will pay for mammography tests every two
years for women 65 and older. For younger women on Medicare because
of disability, the program will cover mammogrphy tests annually for
those ages 50 to 64 and for women ages 40 to 49 who are at high risk
of developing breast cancer. It also will cover the exams every
other year for those ages 40 to 49 who are not at high risk and will
pay for one exam for those ages 35 to 39.
   Medicare will pay 80 percent of mammography costs after the
beneficiary has paid the annual deductible of $75 for physicians'
and outpatient services.
   The program will pay $50 for a mammography exam in 1990.
Physicians who do not participate in Medicare will be prohibited
from charging more than 125 percent of that amount, or $62.50, in
1990.
   Coverage of mammographies is expected to cost $150 million in
fiscal year 1990 and $275 million in fiscal 1991.

<HEAD>Fraternity Conference Begins Anti-Hazing Campaign</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An organization representing fraternities at
900 college campuses throughout the United States and Canada
announced Friday it was launching a campaign to eliminate hazing,
which over the past decade has led to 40 student deaths and hundreds
of serious injuries.
   ``Hazing has no place in the fraternity experience. It is a
dangerous form of intimidation that makes a mockery of fraternal
love and we're dedicated to eradicating it in the fraternity
system,'' said Jonathan Brant, executive director of the National
Interfraternity Conference.
   Brant said his group defines hazing as any action or situation
intended to produce mental or physical harassment, embarrassment or
ridicule.
   ``We are today launching an anti-hazing campaign that declares in
unequivocal terms fraternities' outright condemnation of all forms
of hazing,'' he told a news conference.
   The National Interfraternity Conference, based in Indianapolis,
represents 59 major fraternities with 5,155 chapters and more than
400,000 student members in the United States and Canada.
   Brant said the conference had adopted an anti-hazing resolution
more than 30 years ago and that most fraternities have had rules
against hazing for the past two decades.
   However, he said, ``we are painfully aware that in the past 10
years, more than 40 students have died and hundreds have been
seriously injured by student organizations in what have been
referred to as `hazing-related incidents.'''
   Brant said the anti-hazing campaign will involve distribution of
printed materials on campuses, organizing discussion groups at
fraternity chapters and publishing articles in alumni magazines.
   ``Our challenge will be reaching those 5 percent of our members
who I think for sincere but sincerely wrong reasons believe that
hazing is a fundamental part of the fraternity experience,'' he said.
   Also appearing at the news conference was Eileen Stevens of
Sayville, N.Y., whose son, Chuck Stenzel, died as a result of a 1978
hazing incident at Alfred University in upstate New York. Afterward,
she formed a group called CHUCK _ Committee to Halt Useless College
Killings.
   Mrs. Stevens said she does not favor abolishing fraternities and
that she had decided ``to work with them rather than against them''
in dealing with the hazing problem.
   ``It would be very unfair to point a finger and say they were all
guilty,'' she said.
   Last month, two major fraternities, Tau Kappa Epsilon and Zeta
Beta Tau announced that in an effort to eliminate hazing, they have
eliminated the traditional pledge period for students wishing to
join.
   Fraternity pledging evolved in the late 19th century and was
meant to be a rite of passage for new recruits before their
initiation as full members.

   City police have a weapons problem.
Should they keep their .45-caliber Thompson submachine gun, made in
1921, or sell it to a collector for a fat profit?
   Lt. Ronald Gilchrist said officers still use the gun for training
and take it along when responding to potentially dangerous calls in
their community about 35 miles northwest of Pittsburgh.
   But the tommy gun is not practical compared to modern weapons,
Gilchrist said. It is heavy and replacement parts are hard to find.
   ``It would be like comparing a new car to a Model A Ford,'' he
said.
   Some officers want to keep it for nostalgia reasons.
   But Gilchrist said the department needs modern weapons like M-16
rifles or 9mm handguns. He estimated the Thompson's value at more
than $4,000 to collectors.
   ``The value of it is so great that it's not worth us having to
use it and breaking it,'' he said.

   The donor, who again has said the only condition of his gift is

   People are always leaving papers
behind at John Miller's print shop, but a $5,000 municipal bond
caught him by surprise.
   ``There's a lot of bills I could pay,'' said Miller, owner of
Typography Etc., where a female customer left the bond last month.
Since then he has been trying unsuccessfully to find her.
   Miller won't reveal the owner's name because he wants her to
identify herself.
   ``This is the most valuable thing somebody left behind,'' Miller
said. ``Usually it's a work schedule from McDonald's, sometimes it's
a 1040 (federal tax form). But they always come back, which is why I
know she doesn't know she left it.''
   The customer left the 1969 Detroit municipal bond when she came
in to copy documents that belonged to her recently deceased father.
   She wanted to copy the documents quickly, however, so Miller said
he referred her to another shop with high-speed equipment.

   A male college professor's attempt to join an
exclusive women educators society was rejected on a technicality by
a federal judge today.
   U.S. District Judge Howard Munson said Harold Nash's motion for
summary judgment on the society's admission policies cited laws
applicable to employers and not to private groups.
   Munson dismissed the motion and halted, at least temporarily,
Nash's five-year quest to join the Delta Kappa Gamma Society. Nash's
lawyer, former National Organization for Women President Karen
DeCrow, said she would refile the motion.
   Nash, an education professor at the State University of New
York's Oswego campus, said the group has rejected his applications
because of his sex.
   ``Neither men nor women can have it both ways these days,'' Nash
said. ``It seems to me that (applying) was the reasonable thing to
do in the spirit of equal opportunity.''
   Nash, who has taught at Oswego since 1963, wants to join the
society to share in its education conferences and journals, he said.
   Delta Kappa Gamma is an honorary society for women educators with
164,000 members. It annually presents an educators' award for women
authors and gives scholarships and fellowships for women.
   A lawyer for Delta Kappa Gamma, Nancy Pontius of Syracuse,
declined to comment.

   Top drug lords being sought for
extradition to the United States are being protected by corrupt
military officers who help the traffickers avoid arrest, a U.S.
narcotics expert said today.
   ``Infiltration of traffickers into the security forces is a very
serious matter. The traffickers don't feel any threat. They might
even feel protected,'' the expert told foreign reporters.
   Wealthy leaders of the Medellin drug cartel can easily afford to
pay corrupt military officers up to $15,000 a month for information
about anti-drug raids before they occur, said the expert, who
demanded anonymity. Such soldiers generally only earn about $800 a
month in salary, he said.
   The expert did not identify which of the 12 Colombian drug
dealers being sought by the United States who are receiving the
inside information or the military officers who supposedly provide
it.
   Also today, police said they deactivated a bomb made of 40 pounds
of dynamite in Medellin, a day after an explosion at a paint factory
wounded at least 13 people.
   Government officials met Thursday night to consider widening a 10
p.m.-6 a.m. curfew imposed Wednesday to halt drug-related violence,
news reports said.
   A police spokesman, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the
latest bomb was placed at the city's Colombian Industrial Bank. It
was found and deactivated at 8 p.m. Thursday, two hours before the
curfew went into effect, he said.
   ``It could have caused severe damage, enough to affect even
adjacent buildings,'' the spokesman said.
   Earlier Thursday, 33 pounds of dynamite strapped to an ice cream
vendor's bicycle exploded at the Medellin paint factory, causing
$300,000 worth of damage in addition to injuring at least 13 people,
police and fire department spokesmen said.
   Police in Medellin said today that 527 violators of the curfew
were arrested during the night. Most were released in the morning,
they said.
   In Washington, officials said Thursday that some of the $65
million worth of equipment pledged by the Bush administration to
fight the narcotics trade should begin arriving Sunday. U.S.
military personnel were to arrive today for preparations.
   The Colombian government said that under emergency rules, judges'
identities would be kept secret in drug cases. Since 1980, 220
judges and court officials have been slain in a reign of terror
aimed at intimidating them into dropping drug cases.
   The government began fighting back in its boldest attempt ever
after a a leading presidential hopeful, Luis Carlos Galan, was
assassinated Aug. 18. Drug lords responded with threats to kill more
officials and with bombings.
   They were particularly angry over a government decree that
re-established Colombia's extradition treaty with the United States,
where many drug dealers are wanted.
   The bomb at the paint factory Thursday was in a box on the back
of the bicycle, which was left leaning against a retaining wall
around a paint storage tank, Colombian news reports said.
   The blast also damaged about 20 cars, a police spokeswoman said
on condition of anonymity.
   An anonymous caller told radio stations that the so-called Group
of Extraditables, Colombia's cocaine barons, carried out the bombing
and said there would be more attacks ``with more victims.''
   The group issued a statement Aug. 24 declaring ``total war'' on
the government. The group apparently speaks on behalf of the 12
Colombians the United States wants extradited to stand trial on drug
charges.
   Medellin, Colombia's second-largest city in the northwestern part
of the country, is the home of the most powerful cocaine trafficking
organizations in the world. The cartels are believed to supply up to
80 percent of the cocaine in the United States.

   A janitor at a Veterans of Foreign Wars post
who came upon two burglars made sure the thieves didn't get away
with much money by giving them a lot of bread.
   ``I had two bags of stale bread for the ducks I feed every
morning and a box of Entenmann's sticky buns. I started hitting them
with those,'' said Dean Mitchell.
   The two burglars ``were busy defending themselves'' from the
onslaught of baked goods before they took off, he said.
   ``I'm 70 years old and it would have been a chore catching up
with them. They lit out,'' Mitchell said.
   Mitchell came upon the break-in when he opened Post 2093, a hall
the veterans use for social and business events, about 5 a.m.
Thursday and stepped over two knapsacks _ one filled with liquor and
cigarettes.
   ``I knew something was funny. Then here's those two young kids
coming around the corner by the popcorn machine,'' he said. ``I let
out a big noise and said a few things.''
   The pair didn't make off with much _ maybe $150 worth of change
and cigarettes, said post commander George Gray.
   The burglary was the fourth in less than a year at the post.
Burglars once caused $5,000 in damage to the building's ventilation
system when they tried to crawl through the duct work.
   The Orange County sheriff's office reported no arrests in the
case.

   Police raiding a suspected drug house arrested a
10-year-old boy they found sitting atop a pile of bags of heroin and
crack cocaine bags in the closet.
   ``This is the youngest I've heard of,'' police Inspector Rudy
Thomas, head of the narcotics division, said Thursday. ``It shows
you how streetwise these kids can get.''
   Although the boy's mother was at home, she has not been charged
with anything, authorities said.
   Narcotics Sgt. Thomas McCann, who led the drug raid at the
youth's home Tuesday, said an undercover officer ``got the distinct
impression the kid was in control and running the dope business.''
   The youth, whose name was withheld, was sent to a foster home
pending a Sept. 14 Wayne County Juvenile Court hearing on whether
his mother neglected him, according to court records.
   Juvenile Court Referee Paulette Lebost refused Wednesday to
authorize delinquency charges of possessing heroin and cocaine with
intent to deliver because the state won't make wards of delinquents
under age 12.
   ``My options are to warn and dismiss or place him on probation.
And probation to who?'' she said. ``Mom's house?''

   Millions of people jumped out of windows, ran
through smoke-filled stores and pried each other from crushed
vehicles Friday in a city-wide drill 66 years after the great
earthquake that took at least 150,000 lives.
   Safety officials used public address systems to issue mock
earthquake warnings in designated parts of the city and helped
volunteers and school children, many wearing protective padded
hoods, move to open areas.
   In a shopping center in Kichijoji western Tokyo, police and
firefighters rappelled down the sides of tall buildings to practice
rescuing trapped people.
   Others used power saws and crow bars to rescue volunteers from
cars piled on top of each other. Front-end loaders moved the cars to
the side of the road, clearing the way for firetrucks and other
safety vehicles.
   Volunteers jumped from a fourth floor window onto a giant
air-filled cushion, following directions barked through a bullhorn.
   Firefighters filled a department store and shopping arcade with
smoke to simulate an evacuation during fires likely to follow a
major quake. Girls holding handkerchiefs over their mouths ran
through the smoke in a line.
   ``We've lost some business today, but it's for a good cause,''
said the owner of a clothing store.
   At two minutes before noon on Sept. 1, 1923, the Great Kanto
Earthquake rocked the crowded Kanto Plain around Tokyo and firest
from coal cooking stoves quickly spread through the city's small
wooden houses. Most of the victims died in the fires.
   The intensity was estimated later at 7.9 on the Richter scale,
great enough to cause catastropic damage in populated areas. Experts
say another such quake could strike at any time.
   A police chief, speaking on condition of anonymity, acknowledged
Friday that equipment like front-end loaders probably would be
inadequate and not available where they were needed most. ``We'd
just have to work our way from place to place,'' he said.
   Toshiko Maeda, who watched some of the drills, said she worried
about what would happen in a real earthquake.
   ``I doubt things would go this smoothly,'' she said. ``There
probably would be pieces of buildings falling all around us.''

<HEAD>Reagan Regarded AIDS `Like It Was Measles,' Former Doctor Says</HEAD>
<DATELINE>FORT LEWIS, Wash. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Former President Reagan didn't grasp the
seriousness of the AIDS epidemic until he learned actor Rock Hudson
was suffering from the disease, Reagan's former physician said.
   ``He accepted it like it was measles and it would go away,'' said
Brig. Gen. John Hutton, now commander of Madigan Army Medical Center
here.
   Hutton also said Reagan was tested for exposure to the acquired
immune deficiency syndrome virus in January 1987 because he had
received a transfusion of nine pints of blood after he was shot in
the March 30, 1981, assassination attempt. He tested negative.
   Reagan did not realize how serious the epidemic was until July
1985, when he saw a news report that Hudson, who later died of the
disease, was seeking treatment for AIDS in Paris, Hutton said. That
was more than five years after the diease had been identified, and
when it had infected thousands of Americans.
   Reagan, himself a former Hollywood actor, saw the report while he
was recovering from cancer surgery on his intestine and asked Hutton
to tell him about the disease.
   After Hutton's lengthy explanation, Reagan said, ```I always
thought the world might end in a flash, but this sounds like it's
worse,''' the physician said.
   Hutton, 57, a vascular surgeon and career Army physician, talked
about his experiences as Reagan's doctor during a lecture last week
to Madigan medical officers and in an interview with The Seattle
Times, published Thursday. He was a White House physician from 1984
to 1986, and physician to the president from 1986 until last
January. He assumed command of Madigan in April.
   The Reagan administration frequently was criticized for being
slow to respond to the AIDS epidemic. In 1986, support for medical
research and education increased substantially.
   Hutton said that when private citizens asked Reagan what should
be done about the epidemic, he often said money might not be the
answer.
   ``He would say words to the effect: `Is there a message in this?'
... Like, perhaps people are supposed to modify their behaviors,''
Hutton said.
   Reagan, now 78, is vigorous, alert and physically strong, and has
always recovered quickly from medical problems, Hutton said.
   ``I've never seen anyone recover so fast,'' Hutton said. ``He's a
very stoic individual. ... The only thing he got nervous about was
the dental chair.''
   A week after Reagan's colon-cancer surgery in 1985, the president
wanted to ride his horse and was frustrated when Hutton said no. Six
weeks after the surgery, Reagan finally went riding with friends at
his California ranch and took off galloping as soon as he saw an
open trail, Hutton said.
   Hutton said he went into the stable shortly after the ride and
found the president with a sheepish look and Nancy Reagan looking
peeved. She said to Hutton: ``He said you said he could gallop.''
   ``I'm thinking my job is in the balance,'' Hutton said.
   Hutton said he told Reagan he was about 90 percent recovered
after six weeks and that the president knew best whether he could
ride.
   AIDS, which disables the body's immune system, is most often
transmitted through sexual contact and through the sharing of
contaminated hypodermic needles or syringes. It also can be
transmitted from mother to child at or before birth or through
transfusions of blood or blood products. Tests developed since 1981
have greatly lessened the risk of getting AIDS from transfusions.

   ``Batman'' has been given a rating of
``Children Not Allowed'' in Belgium but Warner Bros. is preparing to
fight the restriction in court before the movie's Sept. 13 opening,
officials said Friday.
   Thursday's rating decision bans everybody under 16 from the movie
and is expected to cut ticket sales by 30 percent _ hundreds of
thousans of dollars, according to Bruno Mertens, general manager of
Warner Bros. Belgium.
   ``A movie like James Bond gets an `All Ages' tag while Batman is
`Children Not Allowed,''' Mertens said. ``That is beyond
comprehension for any professional who saw both movies.''
   The Justice Ministry committee wrote to Warner Bros. that
``Batman'' ``exuded a general atmosphere of violence,'' Mertens
said. It compared ``Batman'' to ``A Clockwork Orange,'' a cult
classic of the 1970s with explicit violence and sex.

   A national children's advocacy group said
Friday it has joined an unwed California father's petition to the
Supreme Court for a re-hearing in his case seeking visitation with
his daughter.
   The court in June upheld a California law that regards a woman's
husband as the father of her children, thereby denying Michael
Hirschensohn access to his child, said David Levy, president of the
National Council for Children's Rights.
   But one of the justices, John Paul Stevens, was ``mixed up'' on
the facts of the case, said Levy. He thought Hirschensohn had had a
hearing in California on the visitation issue, when he had not.
Whether the hearing had taken place was never argued before the high
court, Levy said.
   ``About half a million children are born out of wedlock every
year and in many cases the fathers are being cut out of their right
to know and raise their children,'' said Levy.
   ``What this is all about is an unwed father who wants to be
involved and is spending tens of thousands of dollars on legal fees
that could be spent on the child,'' he said.
   Levy said his organization and Hirschensohn are asking that the
Supreme Court order a hearing on the visitation question.
   The child's mother had a relationship with Hirschensohn when she
was separated from her husband and lived with Hirschensohn on and
off for several years, said Levy.
   Eventually, the woman returned to her husband and took the child,
who is now 7, with her. Hirschensohn said the move ended a
father-daughter relationship that had been established. He said
blood tests have verified that the girl is his daughter.
   ``A child is being deprived of the right to have the financial
and emotional support of her natural father,'' said Levy.
   ``There is no reason why the child and father in this particular
case should lose out because one of the justices thought a hearing
had already occurred,'' said Levy.
   The Supreme Court, which is in recess, resumes business in
October.

   The government said Friday that its chief
economic forecasting gauge turned up in July for the first time in
three months, posting a modest 0.2 percent gain which many
economists interpreted as further evidence that there is no
recession on the horizon.
   The Commerce Department said the gain in the Index of Leading
Economic Indicators followed no increase at all in June and a steep
1.3 percent drop in May, the biggest decline since late 1987. The
index had risen 0.6 percent in April.
   The government initially reported a month ago that the index had
fallen in June as well, marking the fourth time in five months that
the index had fallen.
   At the time the June report came out, many analysts were
convinced that the economy was on the verge of a recession. However,
since that time a variety of government statistics have been revised
to show more strength than previously believed.
   These revisions have sent economists scurrying to scrap their own
recession forecasts in favor of predictions calling for the economy
to experience a slowdown in the second half of the year but come
nowhere close to toppling into a recession.
   Bolstering that view, the government issued its first look at
August economic activity on Friday with release of the unemployment
statistics. That report showed the jobless rate held steady at 5.2
percent in July while the number of jobs, after adjusting for
strikes, shot up by more than 200,000.
   Allen Sinai, chief economist of the Boston Co., said that the
leading indicators, the good employment report in August and a
string of other government statistics in the past month showed that
``not only is there no imminent recession, there isn't even a
slowdown'' at the present time.
   He predicted that overall economic growth, as measured by the
gross national product, could advance at a rapid clip of between 3
percent and 3.5 percent in the current July-September quarter.
   That would be substantially faster than the 2.7 percent GNP
growth rate from April through June. But Sinai predicted growth
would slow in the final three months of the year, reflecting an
expected dip in auto sales after the flurry of model-yearending
discount incentives offered in July and August.
   Michael Evans, head of a Washington forecasting firm, said he
expected growth in the final half of the year would average 2.2
percent. While that would be down a percentage point from the
first-half growth rate, it would be enough to reach the
administration's goal of 2.9 percent growth for all of 1989.
   ``We are going to have a fine year for the economy,'' Evans said.
``Inflation started out badly, but it has calmed down, and now you
would have to look pretty hard to find something you didn't like
about this year.''
   Analysts believe that with inflationary pressures easing because
of a moderate slowdown in growth, the Federal Reserve board has been
able to achieve the so-called soft-landing it was seeking.
   In July, five of the 11 leading indicators showed strength, with
the biggest positive push coming from an increase in the growth of
the nation's money supply.
   Analysts said that reflected the fact that the central bank began
easing credit conditions slightly in June and July, a development
which has helped to push interest rates lower.
   Other sources of strength in the July report were a jump in
consumer confidence, the rise in stock market prices during the
month, an increase in plant and equipment orders and an increase in
the backlog of unfilled manufacturing orders.
   Five indicators held back the overall increase. The biggest
negative factor was a decline in raw materials prices. While lower
inflation is generally seen as good for the economy, the leading
index considers it a drawback because it can signal falling demand.
   Other negative factors were a drop in orders for consumer goods,
an increase in weekly unemployment claims, a fall in building
permits and changes in business delivery times.
   The 11th indicator, the length of the average workweek, showed no
change from June to July.
   The overall index stood at 144.0 percent of its 1982 base of 100.

   All, it would seem, was bliss at Buckingham Palace.
   Prince Charles and Diana emerged unscathed from a spate of rumors
about their marriage. Prince Andrew and his wife, Sarah, are happily
raising a baby. Prince Edward gave up military life and apparently
found peace with a theater company.
   Queen Elizabeth II was the picture of grandmotherly contentment.
   But now, suddenly, shocking headlines! Headstrong Princess Anne
and her shy commoner husband are splitting up. Is the British royal
family in trouble?
   Not really. It has survived worse crises, only to grow in
prestige and popularity. And compared with the scandals that beset
some of their ancestors, the separation announced Thursday of the
queen's daughter from Capt. Mark Phillips is small potatoes.
   ``Many, many royal marriages have been very unhappy indeed,''
says Michelle Brown, curator of the Royal Britain Exhibition.
``There have been lots of royal divorces in the past, and many
people far more miserable than Capt. Phillips and Princess Anne seem
to have been.''
   Like the unfortunate Sophia Dorothea, whose husband, George I,
locked her in a castle for 32 years for being unfaithful to him in
1694.
   Or, more recently, the drawn-out saga of Princess Margaret, the
queen's younger sister, whose marriage to Lord Snowdon ended in
divorce in 1978.
   And then there was 19th-century George IV, whose attempts to
divorce Caroline of Brunswick became a prolonged and disgraceful
public spectacle.
   Anne and Mark, who have two children, do not plan to divorce,
Buckingham Palace says.
   While most newspapers ran the split on the front page Friday, The
Independent ran just one paragraph on page 2. The Independent simply
doesn't believe the royals matter. Others enjoy them as soap opera.
   ``No scriptwriter could wish for a better cast,'' the columnist
Godfrey Smith has written: Queen Elizabeth II as ``everyone's
favorite mum,'' Prince Margaret the ``willful younger sister,''
Prince Philip ``the cantankerous father,'' ``interesting children
(cheerful Charlie, randy Andy, educated Edward and angular Anne),
all sorts of in-laws (divine Diana, problem-girl Princess Michael),
grandchildren galore...''
   There is, however, genuine sympathy for Anne.
   Her marriage in 1973 to Phillips, televised from Westminster
Abbey, was dubbed a storybook romance, but rested mainly on a shared
passion for horses, and marital strife has been rumored for eight
years.
   Anne's short temper and caustic tongue earned her an unpopular
image that only changed in the 1980s through her quiet, sustained
and often courageous work on behalf of the world's needy children.
   She may never rival Princess Diana in looks, and as seventh in
line to the throne she is unlikely to become Queen Anne. But she is
blessed with wit, poise and intellect, and at 39 she is by far the
most interesting of the British royals.
   ``We are very possessive about our royal family, and we were all,
in a sense, guests at that fairy-tale wedding 15 years ago,'' The
Times editorialized Friday. ``The queen's daughter has never been a
fairy-tale princess, however, and the monarchy is the stronger for
it.''
   Indeed, the line was taken by some newspapers that the marriage
was a sham, and that its end came as a relief.
   Other European countries also treasure their royals, and scandals
are far fewer. Belgium hasn't had any problems since King Leopold
III married a commoner in 1941 without his government's approval.
Holland's Princess Irene scandalized Protestants by converting to
Catholicism to marry a Spaniard, but her divorce 17 years later
barely caused a ripple. The Swedish and Danish royal families are
squeaky clean.
   So, for the most part, is the British family. But when it does
arise, divorce is always an emotional issue, from much-married Henry
VIII four centuries ago to Edward VIII, who had to abdicate in 1936
to marry the twice-divorced American, Wallis Simpson.
   ``It was only since Queen Victoria and Prince Albert set up this
wonderful sort of epitome of the perfect family that the pressure
existed,'' curator Brown told London Broadcasting Corp. radio.
   ``Before then, royal marriages had all the rough and tumble and
all the problems of any other marriage and nobody tried to pretend
otherwise.''

   Unemployment held steady at 5.2 percent last
month as the surprisingly robust economy added more than 200,000
jobs, the government said Friday in a report prompting forecasts
that the record-long expansion will last well past its seventh
anniversary.
   The Labor Department's official figure for non-farm payroll
expansion last month was 110,000 jobs. But strikes reduced the job
totals by about 108,000 _ meaning that without the walkouts the
new-job total would have been some 218,000.
   The government also revised its July job growth figure upward to
184,000 from 169,000, and the June totals up again from 250,000 to
297,000, further signs that the economy continues to expand at a
pace that will keep it out of recession in the short term.
   The stock market greeted the unemployment report favorably, while
bond prices moved sharply higher after another closely watched
economic report suggested a possible upcoming manufacturing slowdown.
   Bond prices jumped after the National Association of Purchasing
Management released its Purchasing Managers' Index, which plunged to
45.2 percent in August from 46 percent in July. A reading below 50
percent indicates the manufacturing sector of the economy is in
decline.
   But other data released this week, including two more reports
Friday, also suggested economic strength, leaving little doubt the
expansion will begin its eighth year come November.
   ``We still have a very solid labor market,'' said Donaldson,
Lufkin &amp; Jenrette senior vice president Elliot Platt. ``The evidence
is clear that the economy remains strong and we are clearly not
plunging into recession.''
   Said DRI-McGraw-Hill chief economist David Wyss: ``Once again the
economy looks stronger than we thought it was. We're really not
seeing much sign of slowdown.''
   In the other reports released Friday:
   _The Commerce Department said its chief economic forecasting
gauge rose in July for the first time in three months. The Index of
Leading Economic Indicators rose a modest 0.2 percent after
registering no gain in June and plunging by 1.3 percent in May, the
biggest drop since late 1987 following the stock market crash.
   _Commerce said construction spending inched up 0.02 percent,
rising by $100 million to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of
$415.7 billion in July. The modest increase followed a decline in
June, and analysts said it offered hope the lengthy construction
slump is over.
   These reports came on the heels of a sharp upward revision in the
projected rate of economic growth in the second quarter. The
government earlier this week said the gross national product grew at
an annual rate of 2.7 percent in the April-June period, up from a
1.7 percent preliminary estimate. The unemployment report, the first
comprehensive look at August economic performance, indicated similar
growth in the third quarter.
   All but gone are the predictions of recession that were easy to
find in the spring. Since then the Federal Reserve has eased its
hold on credit after a year-long tightening designed to slow growth
and curb inflation.
   Now all but a smattering of forecasters believe the economy is
growing at a sustainable pace, with only dogged inflation
threatening to trigger recession in late 1990 or 1991.
   ``The primary fear now is that the economy is going to take off
again and inflation with it and that the Fed is going to have to hit
the breaks again,'' said Wyss.
   Wage data in the report should prove encouraging to inflation
watchers, although perhaps discouraging to workers.
   The government said average hourly earnings were essentially
unchanged last month _ actually falling by a tiny fraction _ after
rising 0.7 percent from June to July. For the year ending in August
average hourly wages were up 3.9 percent, the government said, well
below the pace of consumer inflation.
   The report also showed a slight reduction in factory activity,
with the average manufacturing work week dropping 0.1 hour to 40.9
hours. Average factory overtime dropped by the same amount to 3.9
hours a week.
   The Labor Department said the civilian jobless rate held steady
at 5.2 percent in a month that saw number of Americans looking for
work but unable to find jobs fall by a modest 76,000 to 6.42
million. More than 117.5 million Americans had jobs, an increase of
138,000 from July.
   The official job-growth numbers were skewed by several
strike-related developments. About 130,000 telephone workers were
out on strike, while about 20,000 coal miners returned to work after
walkouts.
   Strikes affect the data because the job totals are taken from a
government survey of businesses, and strikers are not counted as
being on payrolls. But strikes do not affect the unemployment rate
because that statistic is taken from a separate household survey in
which strikers are considered to still have jobs.
   The new job growth was predominantly in the service-producing
sector, which added nearly 70,000 jobs. That number would have been
higher in a normal month because the telephone workers fall into the
service portion of the economy.
   Manufacturing and construction posted modest gains in August of
11,000 and 8,000 jobs, respectively. The manufacturing total showed
slight job declines in some areas, including furniture and lumber
products, but a gain of 25,000 in auto manufacturing, a sign that
automakers called back some of the workers laid off because of
sluggish sales.
   In a separate calculation that includes military personnel
stationed in the United States, the Labor Department said the
unemployment rate was 5.1 percent, down from July's 5.2 percent.

at a lodge in the Grand Teton National Park outside Jackson, Wyo.,
the State Department said Friday.
   The meeting is designed to lay the groundwork for a summit

   State Department spokeswoman Margaret Tutwiler said topics will
include arms control, human rights and regional conflicts.
   Baker and Sheverdnadze agreed in Paris in late July to hold the

At the July meeting, Baker had shown Shevardnadze pictures of the

   President Bush greeted Japanese Prime Minister
Toshiki Kaifu as a ``new friend'' today but immediately cautioned
that the health of the partnership of their countries will require
Japan to increase its imports.
   ``I share the prime minister's belief that while Japan is noted
as an exporting superpower, the time has also come for Japan to be
an importing superpower,'' Bush said.
   The president, interrupting his Maine vacation for the
get-aquainted session at the White House with the new Japanese
leader, said economic imbalances between the two allies were
discussed ``at length.''
   Kaifu, speaking after Bush in a brief departure ceremony after
their meeting, said Japan recognized the trade imbalance and said
his country would continue to ``make efforts for expanding imports.''
   At the same time, Kaifu noted that the United States must do more
to reduce its budget deficit, increase the rate of savings by
Americans and increase the competitiveness of U.S. industry.
   The United States is running a $50 billion annual trade deficit
with Japan, and Bush said, ``We know that the health of our
relationship partly depends on bringing our economic relatonship
into better balance.''
   The two leaders said their discussions also included talks about
China, Cambodia and international terrorism.
   ``While we met as new friends, our talks were conducted as old
friends,'' Bush said. He cited ``broad agreement on the major items
of our bilateral and international agenda.''
   Kaifu picked up on the theme, saying that ``I just completed my
first meeting with the president. Nevertheless, I was able to
conduct talks with the president as if I were meeting an old
friend.''
   Kaifu also said he proposed to Bush an international effort, to
be partly funded by Japan, to bring food and other relief to people
in developing nations. He said the effort would be named after the
late Rep. Mickey Leland, D-Texas, killed last month while flying to
a refugee camp in Ethiopia.
   From the White House, Kaifu went to Capitol Hill to meet with
Senate leaders.
   In a separate meeting today, Secretary of State James A. Baker
III cautioned Japanese Foreign Minister Taro Nakayama that close
economic cooperation between the two nations was crucial because of
``rising protectionism'' in the United States, according to a
Japanese official.
   Baker pressed for movement on lowering Japanese trade barriers
against U.S. super computers, satellites and forest products, said a
Japanese official who briefed reporters on condition of anonymity.
   The official quoted Nakayama as reiterating the Japanese position
that these trade issues would be discussed, but not under the cloud
of threatened U.S. sanctions.
   The Baker-Nakayama breakfast meeting ranged from talks about
Cambodia and China to the current turmoil in Latin America, the
official said.
   As the two leaders began their two-hour round of talks, Kaifu
told Bush he had been to the White House 18 years ago when Gerald
Ford was president, and earlier as a newly elected member of
Parliament when John Kennedy was president.
   Kaifu, wearing his trademark polka dot tie, posed with Bush for
photos in the Oval Office before a session in the Cabinet room with
their advisers.
   The Kaifu visit entails some touchy matters for Bush, as the
United States wants to push its concerns over Japan's $50 billion
trade surplus, but guard against pushing Kaifu so hard that it
weakens his fragile new government.
   Although the two countries have very good economic relations,
``there are economic frictions over various issues,'' Kaifu said in
an interview on ``CBS This Morning,'' and ``Japan wishes to make as
much effort as possible in order to resolve those economic
frictions.''
   He said, ``I would like to, through my talks with the president,
make sure that this relationship of mutual trust will remain
unshakeable and firm.''
   The meeting came a day after Bush welcomed Canadian Prime
Minister Brian Mulroney and his family to the Bush family's seaside
home in kennebunkport, Maine.
   The leaders said they discussed many issues, including their
shared support for embattled Colombian President Virgilio Barco in
his attempted crackdown on drug traffickers.
   Kaifu is making his first trip to the United States after
recently taking office in the wake of sex and political scandal that
felled his predecessor and other prominent Japanese leaders.
   ``It is customary for new Japanese prime ministers to visit
Washington early on to establish a personal relationship with the
president,'' Scowcroft told reporters.
   ``This is one of our more important international relationships
and it is important that the two establish this kind of close
contact, and that's really the purpose of the visit.''
   The 58-year-old Kaifu is one of Japan's youngest prime ministers,
but he has served in parliament for 29 years and was twice minister
of education.

   Convicted Colombian drug kingpin Carlos
Lehder Rivas continued to arrange cocaine transactions from his
Florida jail cell while awaiting trial in 1987, the government said
Friday in a plea agreement with his ex-wife.
   Yemel Nacel, 34, of New York was one of nine people who entered
guilty pleas in the so-called ``Son of Lehder'' case.
   In its agreement with Ms. Nacel, the government said Lehder, the
leader of the Medellin cartel, had used her to arrange cocaine
transactions while awaiting trial in Jacksonville.
   He was convicted and sentenced to life in prison. He is being
held in isolation at the maximum-security prison in Marion, Ill.
   Ms. Nacel, who told U.S. District Judge John H. Moore II that she
is a housewife and mother, pleaded guilty to a charge of conspiracy
to distribute 5 kilograms or more of cocaine. She faces a maximum
15-year prison term and a $4 million fine.
   Ms. Nacel will be held without bond until sentencing Nov. 29.
Co-defendant John Lee Moller, 44, who previously lived in Mexico,
also will remain in jail until sentencing. The guilty pleas are
contingent on Moore approving the formal plea agreements.
   Ms. Nacel married Lehder in Toronto in February 1977 and was
divorced in 1980 or 1981 in Haiti. She was involved in cocaine
trafficking with Lehder as recently as 1987, when Lehder was
arrested in Colombia and hastily brought to the United States, the
government alleged.
   Five other defendants, including Jack Carlton Reed, who was tried
with Lehder and convicted of conspiracy, remain scheduled for trial
Sept. 11.
   Moller, who was among the others pleading guilty, was accused of
smuggling cocaine as recently as 1985. He faces up to 20 years in
prison and forfeiture of about $2 million in property, including
land in Tequesta, Fla., $896,000 cash in a safe deposit box in
London and the proceeds of $473,000 owed him on loans.
   Richard James Barile, accused of being instrumental in
distributing large amounts of cocaine for Lehder in California in
the 1970s, faces up to eight years under the plea agreement.
   Donald Podesto, also accused of distributing cocaine in
California, failed to appear because a flight was canceled in
Chicago.
   Richard C. Tracy of Taos, N.M., faces up to three years on his
plea to charges of being involved in the case, and five others have
sentencing caps of two years.
   All of those who entered plea agreements have agreed to cooperate
with the government.
   Prosecutors earlier dismissed charges against Mayari Ann Sargent,
a Washington, D.C., businesswoman who won pretrial motions
suppressing some evidence.
   Facing trial with Reed, 58, are Thomas Howard Herington, 35, of
Mill Valley, Calif.; attorney Barry Kane, 52, of Hyannis, Mass., and
Fort Luderdale; Donald Kenneth Lady, 41, of Pomona, Calif.; and
Samuel Thomas Stewart, 53, of Anaheim, Calif.
   Prosecutors have projected the trial will last two months because
the remaining defendants span a 15-year time frame discussed in the
indictment.
   Sixteen others remain fugitives in the case, including the
leaders of Medellin cartel leaders who are now listed on the ``most
wanted list'' of drug kingpins sought by the Justice Department.
   They include Pablo Escobar Gaviria, Jose Gonzalo Rodriquez Gacha,
Jorge Ochoa Vasquez and Fabio Ochoa Vasquez.
   Also indicted in the case was fugitive U.S. financier Robert
Vesco, who is living in Cuba, and Everette William Bannister, a
close associate of Bahamian Prime Minister Lynden O. Pindling.

   Security officials said Friday they
expected East Germany to use a mass exodus of refugees from Hungary
to slip agents into West Germany.
   The sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the flight
of thousands of refugees provided an ``excellent opportunity'' to
funnel intelligence agents into West Germany.
   In addition to traditional espionage activities, the East German
government wants to learn more about the refugees themselves, how
they are treated in West Germany when they arrive, and how they
adjust to a new life in the West, security officials said.
   At least 6,000 East Germans have used Hungary's newly porous
border with Austria to flee to the West since the barbed-wire
barriers of the former Iron Curtain were dismantled beginning in May.
   West German government officials have indicated a mass transfer
of East Germans to West Germany from Hungary is being planned in the
next few days.
   As many as 20,000 East Germans in Hungary are expected to ask to
come to West Germany.

   A story written by filmmaker Ingmar
Bergman about the turbulent marriage of his parents will be filmed
by Denmark's Bille August next year, the two Oscar-winning directors
announced Friday.
   ``I feel a great need to tell the story of these two people who
are in my blood system, in my nerves and in my genes,'' Bergman, 71,
told reporters.
   The filming of ``Good Intentions'' starts in the autumn of 1990,
with a world premiere in Sweden for the four-part television series
planned for Christmas 1992, officials said. A cinema version also
will be distributed.
   Bergman described his parents, Karin and Erik, as ``predestined
for catastrophy in life because of too high demands from within
themselves, toward each other and from society.''
   Bergman nursed the idea of ``Good Intentions'' during the 1982
filming of the partially biographical ``Fanny and Alexander,'' which
won four Oscars. Since then, he has retired from directing films,
though he still produces plays.
   August's international breakthrough came with ``Pelle the
Conqueror,'' which won a 1989 Oscar for best foreign film. It also
won the Golden Palm award last year at the Cannes Film Festival.

   Willie Nelson and Kris Kristofferson are
getting together to make a scoundrels-and-scruples television movie.
   The movie, tentatively titled ``Rip,'' will be filmed in Austin
next month. It was written and will be produced by the Texas team of
Bud Shrake and writer Gary Cartwright.
   According to Shrake, ``Rip'' is about a modern Texas ranger ``who
has a high moral code and is forced to solve a crime with a
scoundrel. It's kind of like `48 Hrs.'''
   Kristofferson will play the ranger, nicknamed Rip, while Nelson
is to portray the scoundrel.
   Nelson and Kristofferson also appeared together in Shrake's 1984
film, ``Songwriter,'' and were reunited later in CBS's television
movie version of ``Stagecoach.''
   CBS has scheduled the film for broadcast in February.

   Alex Valhos, a 6-year-old cancer patient, is
getting support from someone who knows what he is going through _
baseball star Dave Dravecky.
   Valhos is at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, where he
will undergo an 18-day series of tests and conditioning followed by
a bone marrow transplant.
   ``Welcome to Seattle!'' the child said when he arrived at
Seattle-Tacoma International Airport on Thursday night.
   Dravecky, the San Francisco Giants pitcher who is also a cancer
victim, helped raise some $100,000 for Alex during his own dramatic
comeback to major league baseball several weeks ago.
   A week later, Dravecky broke his arm pitching a game in Montreal.
The injury was related to surgery last year to remove a malignant
tumor from his left arm.
   More than 7,000 people have undergone preliminary tests for
compatibility with Alex, who suffers from T-cell leukemia. But it
appears his 2-year-old brother, Gregory, may be the best hope for a
bone marrow donor, although he is not a perfect match.
   The cancer research center is named for Northwest native Fred
Hutchinson, a pitcher for Detroit from 1939 to 1953 who died of
cancer in 1964.

   Border guards fired shots in an unsuccessful
attempt to stop an East German man from fleeing his communist
homeland, police said Friday.
   The West German government and the Allied powers in West Berlin
protested the use of force. West Berlin police said the 24-year-old
man, who was not identified, managed to scale border fortifications
and flee unharmed to the West on Thursday.
   Police said border guards fired two shots despite East German
claims that a shoot-to-kill order had been lifted. It was not known
if the shots were fired directly at the man.
   The Allied powers in West Berlin _ the United States, France and
Britain _ lodged protests condemning the shooting incident and
called on the East German government to ``end the use of deadly
force which clearly violates all foundations of human rights.''
   The Berlin Wall and the frontier between East Germany and West
Germany are heavily fortified and guarded by armed troops,
electronic alarms and attack dogs.

   A starving teen-ager rescued from a mobile
home told authorities that her mother beat her, tied her up with
ropes and put chicken wire over the windows to keep her imprisoned,
police said Friday.
   Betty Faye Green, 18, weighed 42 pounds and was too weak to walk
when she was admitted to Tift General Hospital on Wednesday, police
said. She was listed in stable condition Friday.
   Four younger children appeared to be healthy.
   Their mother, Ola Mae Thomas of Tifton, was arrested Wednesday
and charged with false imprisonment and aggravated battery. She was
in the Tift County Jail awaiting bond Friday.
   Detective Mitch Williams said police found the 4-foot-11 Ms.
Green when they were summoned to the mobile home by a social worker.
   He said police found chicken wire over all the home's windows and
ropes on the doors that could be used to tie them shut.
   The teen-ager's room was empty of furniture, he said.
   ``There were no fans, there was nothing in the room, not even a
light bulb,'' he said. ``She had bruises and scars and she had some
rope burns on both wrists. She told us her mother had been tying her
up. There was a rope outside the door.''
   Detective Buddy Dowdy said Ms. Thomas' four other children, ages
9 and younger, appeared to be healthy and in excellent physical
condition. They have been placed in foster homes.
   Dowdy said there was plenty of food in the home, but it
apparently was mostly withheld from the teen-ager. He said he did
not know why.
   ``She was denied access to food,'' he said. ``She spent most of
her time bound or locked in her room.''
   Williams said the mobile home's toilet was inoperative but was
still being used. Investigators at first ``thought somebody was dead
in the bathroom because it smelled so bad,'' he said.
   Hospital spokeswoman Valerie Hall declined to discuss Ms. Green's
prognosis Friday and said the hospital would not allow her to be
interviewed ``for her protection and her recovery.''
   Assistant District Attorney Ronald Adams said no hearing had yet
been scheduled for Ms. Thomas, who could be sentenced to 30 years in
prison if convicted of the felony charges.
   A neighbor, Betty Moore, said she had not seen Ms. Green since
the first of the year, but the four other children were clean and
neatly dressed Monday when they left for the first day of school in
the southern Georgia town of 14,000.
   Other neighbors said Ms. Thomas often cursed her children loudly
and seldom left the mobile home on Tifton's impoverished south side.
   ``From six o'clock in the morning until late at night, when her
man came home, she was steadily cussing the children,'' said Odell
Moore, Mrs. Moore's husband.
   The neighbors said Ms. Thomas' boyfriend or husband had been
living at the mobile home for at least three years.
   A social worker who had helped one of Ms. Thomas' children with
academic problems for the past year did not see Ms. Green at the
home during an April visit and was told by Ms. Thomas that she was
away, said Department of Family and Children's Services Director
Rodney Griffin.
   In May, the social worker noticed Ms. Green had lost too much
weight, he said. He said Ms. Green and Ms. Thomas both said the girl
was fine and refused hospital treatment.
   Griffin said the social worker again tried to get the daughter to
a doctor on Wednesday, but Ms. Thomas ordered her out of the house.
She returned with police.
   Ms. Thomas told police she is 27, saying she was 9 years old when
Ms. Green was born. Dowdy said police believe she was 13 at the time
of her daughter's birth.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   More Jews left the Soviet Union in August than
in any month for the past 21 years, the chairman of the National
Conference on Soviet Jewry announced Friday, calling it ``a
development of major significance.''
   The conference, a nationwide group that has monitored Jewish
emigration from the Soviet Union since 1968, reported that 6,756
Jews left last month, surpassing the previous high of 4,746 in
October 1979. Of those who left in August, 793, or 11.7 percent,
went to Israel.
   ``This is a development of major significance, and we hope that
the upward trend in emigration, which we have witnessed since the
beginning of 1989, will continue,'' said Shoshana S. Cardin,
chairman of the conference.
   Soviet restrictions on Jewish emigration have been a point of
contention between U.S. and Soviet officials for years, although the
issue has been eclipsed recently by other human rights topics, such
as the drive for greater autonomy by the Baltic republics and
Moldavia, and demands by other ethnic groups.
   Bush administration officials and Jewish activists in this
country have said that higher levels of emigration and proposed
relaxations in Soviet visa law could prompt the U.S. government to
waive provisions of 1974 legislation linking emigration with trade
benefits.
   On June 13, the National Conference on Soviet Jewry passed a
resolution saying that if the favorable trends continued, it would
support waiver of portions of the Jackson-Vanik amendment.
   The bill, named after the late Sen. Henry Jackson, D-Wash., and
former Rep. Charles Vanik, D-Ohio, required higher trade tariffs on
Soviet imports as long as the president felt the Kremlin was
limiting emigration.
   The newly constituted Soviet parliament, the Supreme Soviet, is
expected to consider a new emigration law when it convenes later
this month, although it was not clear how liberal the new
legislation might be or when it might be passed.
   The National Conference said that some problems persist in Jewish
emigration from the Soviet Union. Ms. Chardin said in June that some
400,000 invitations had been mailed to Soviet Jews to emigrate,
although it was not clear how many actually wished to leave.
   Since January, 33,444 Jews have been allowed to leave the Soviet
Union, and the total for 1989 could surpass the previous high of
51,320 set in the 1979, according to officials of the National
Conference on Soviet Jewry. In July of this year, 4,537 Jews
emigrated.
   Last year, 18,965 Jews emigrated from the Soviet, up sharply from
the 1987 figure of 8,155 and the 1986 figure of 914, the conference
reported.
   A State Department source said the U.S. government had no
immediate reaction to the figures, but noted that the Bush
administration has been keeping close tabs on Soviet emigration
policy with an eye to possibly easing enforcement of the
Jackson-Vanik amendment.

   China has denied permission to Pope John Paul II to
fly in Chinese airspace on a pilgrimage to the Far East in October,
an Alitalia airline spokesman said Friday.
   The Beijing government had not given an official explanation for
the decision, said the airline spokesman, Gianpiero Piva. The
Italian carrier is to fly the pope Oct. 6 to Seoul, the first stop
on the 10-day trip.
   China severed diplomatic relations with the Vatican in 1957 and
allows worship only under the guise of the Chinese Patriotic
Catholic Church, which consecrates its own bishops. The church
claims more than 3 million members and an unknown number of other
Catholics remain secretly loyal to the pope.
   Piva said an alternate air route had not yet been chosen and it
was not clear if the delay would lengthen the flight considerably.
   The pontiff's 44th foreign trip also includes visits to
Indonesia, East Timor and Mauritius.

<HEAD>Pan Am Settles Lawsuit, Says Flight Attendants Can Weigh More</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Pan American World Airways has agreed to pay
$2.35 million to 116 flight attendants who were penalized by the
airline for weighing too much.
   The airline also agreed to loosen up its weight rules and stop
conducting appearance inspections of its flight attendants.
   The agreement settles a class-action lawsuit by the flight
attendants, who said they were fired, forced to resign or denied
promotions because the airline decided they were overweight.
   The lawsuit was filed five years ago in San Francisco by the
Independent Union of Flight Attendants, which charged that Pan Am
was discriminating against women by adopting different weight
standards for women and men.
   In 1987, a federal judge ruled in favor of the flight attendants
and ordered Pan Am to change its weight policy. Pan Am had appealed
that decision.
   Under the settlement announced Thursday, Pan Am agreed to
withdraw its appeal without admitting any wrongdoing and establish a
more liberal weight policy. It also agreed to pay the union's legal
fees and the $2.35 million, which includes back pay, to the flight
attendants.
   The agreement must be approved by the courts.
   In the old policy, women flight attendants would have been
considered overweight, for instance, if they were 5 feet 7 inches
tall, of medium build and weighing more than 136 pounds. The new
policy raises the maximum weight level to 151 pounds.

<HEAD>Moldavian Lawmakers Allow Loopholes for Russian Language</HEAD>

<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Lawmakers in the southern republic of Moldavia
opted Friday for more compromises that severely weaken attempts to
require all residents of the republic to speak the Moldavian
language, activists said.
   The legislature, or Supreme Soviet, named Moldavian the state
language Thursday but said Moldavian and Russian could be used in
everyday life. That infuriated thousands of Moldavians, who
demonstrated on the street late into the night while the lawmakers
debated.
   After hours of debate Friday, it decided that local governments
could choose their own official language, said Vladimir Solonar of
Yedinstvo, a pro-Russian group.
   Moldavia previously had no official language, but Russian is
typically used in government and commerce, especially because many
cities are dominated by non-Moldavians. Nationalists are trying to
restore common use of their language, but non-Moldavians fear
discrimination and have gone on strike at 200 enterprises to protest.
   Thousands of Moldavians demonstrated Friday outside the opera
house in Kishinev, the capital of the republic, to protest the
weakening of their proposal to require everyone to speak Moldavian.
   Another compromise will permit business enterprises to choose
their own language if they can win permission from both the local
government and the republic's Council of Ministers, Solonar said.
   Many businesses will try to use the loophole to continue using
Russian, predicted Yuri Plugaru of the pro-Moldavian People's Front
said.
   Thousands of Russians in the republic are in their 12th day of
strikes over the language law, whose original form would have
required Russians, Ukrainians, Bulgarians and other nationalities to
use Moldavian to speak to each other.
   Plugaru said Moldavians are considering a general strike
themselves to protest the compromises.
   Both the Moldavian and Russian representatives, however, said
everyone would have to study the final law before deciding the
strike question.
   The language dispute reflects widespread tension among many of
the Soviet Union's more than 100 ethnic groups stemming from decades
of repression and neglect. Many of the ethnic minorities say they
have been forced to learn and use Russian even though it is vastly
different from their native tongues and is alien to their cultural
heritage.
   ``People are unsatisfied with all the compromises the deputies
agreed to,'' said Konstantin Bogdanash, a journalist with the
People's Front group that has spearheaded the campaign for
preservation of the Moldavian language.
   Bogdanash said protesters held signs reading, ``People want
Freedom,'' ``No Lies,'' and ``Respected Russians, Mother Russia
Calls you Home.''
   The legislature also restored the Latin alphabet taken away a
half-century ago by dictator Josef Stalin when he annexed Moldavia.
Stalin imposed Cyrillic _ the alphabet used in Russian _ to back his
claim that Romanians and Moldavians are two distinct nationalities
even though the languages are virtually identical.
   The legislators also ordered creation of a commission to look
into the sharpening political divisions in the republic.
   In the Baltic republics, meanwhile, grassroots political groups
lashed out at the Soviet Communist Party leadership for its recent
scathing criticism of their campaign for independence, and the
Latvian organization demanded the Kremlin recognize the region's
``special economic and political status.''
   ``Whether the authors wanted it or not, as a result in the eyes
of many people they look like the brothers of those who divided
zones of influence in 1939 and decided the fate of our sovereign
people, at that time independent republics, also behind their
backs,'' said a statement released after a meeting of leaders of the
People's Fronts of Latvia, Lithuania and Estonia. It referred to the
Nazi-Soviet non-aggression pact that put the Baltics in the Soviet
sphere of influence.
   The document said the party's remarks were the most ``sly or
dangerous for democracy'' it has made since Stalin's rule.
   The Latvian People's Front said Friday its leaders planned to
revise their group's platform to include a call for complete
independence for the republic.
   ``Only in an independent, democratic Latvia can an economic and
political crisis be overcome,'' the statement said.
   It called for authorities to ``rehabilitate the once-independent
republic of Latvia'' and ``recognize the special economic and
political status in the territory of Latvia to guarantee the return
of independence and democracy.''
   The full platform is to be published in a week in the Latvian
press and will then be considered at an Oct. 7 meeting of all the
People's Front's members, said Sarmite Elerte, a spokeswoman for the
group.
   Leaders of the Lithuanian People's Front adopted a similar
resolution last week.

   A 19-year-old ``skinhead'' pleaded guilty
Friday to a charge of first-degree manslaughter for the racially
motivated beating death of a black man last fall.
   Kyle Brewster was ordered by Multnomah County Circuit Judge
Robert W. Redding to return to court Oct. 10 for sentencing. Deputy
District Attorney Norman Frink recommended Brewster be sentenced to
the maximum possible term of 20 years in prison with a 10-year
minimum.
   Brewster was charged in the Nov. 12, 1988, beating death of
Mulugeta Seraw, a 27-year-old Ethiopian citizen.
   Seraw and two companions were attacked by a group of skinheads
outside Seraw's home in southeast Portland. Authorities said Seraw
was beaten to death with a baseball bat.
   A second defendant, Kenneth M. Mieske, 23, earlier pleaded guilty
to murder in the Seraw killing. Steven R. Strasser, 20, is awaiting
trial in the case.
   Brewster also pleaded guilty to first-degree assault for an
attack on one of Seraw's companions and pleaded no contest to three
counts of first-degree intimidation.
   The intimidation charges included a charge stemming from an
unrelated attack on a security guard at a downtown Portland grocery
store.
   Neo-Nazi skinhead gang members in Oregon have been connected to a
number of racially motivated assaults in Oregon in the last year.
   Six people described as skinheads were arrested in Portland this
week for attacking a 15-year-old Hispanic girl at a city park. Those
arrested included three juveniles.

judgment of Germans who were ``blinded and deceived'' by Adolf
Hitler.
   On the anniversary of the Nazi attack on Poland that plunged
Europe into World War II, Kohl tried in a solemn parliamentary
speech to ease German guilt while acknowledging the importance of
``keeping the horror in our minds, keeping it present.''
   In Communist East Berlin, ailing leader Erich Honecker missed the
memorial ceremony in the 500-member People's Chamber, where Foreign
Minister Oskar Fischer delivered the main address.
   Fischer called Friday a day of ``recollection and sorrow'' and
said the government was committed ``to do everything in our power to
ensure that war and fascism never again threaten our lives and the
lives of our children.''
   Kohl declared West Germany's commitment to reconciliation with
Poland and mending of the tear in Europe inflicted by the war.
   ``The wounds caused by World War II have not healed yet. They are
burnt into the minds of nations,'' Kohl stated.
   But he alluded to ``encouraging developments'' in East-West
relations and vowed the full support of West Germany for
reform-oriented Soviet bloc nations as payment for past wrongs.
   ``We Germans are under a special obligation to do so,'' Kohl
said. ``This stems not least from the Hitler-Stalin pact of 1939.''
   Secret protocols to that pact deeded the Baltic states to the
Soviet Union and allowed the Nazis to invade Poland on Sept. 1, 1939.
   ``We feel sorrow at the untold suffering inflicted on people and
nations by Germans and in the name of Germany, and we mourn the many
innocent victims from the midst of our own nation,'' Kohl said.
   ``People still vividly recall the cattle wagons of the `death
trains,' packed with people destined for the extermination camps .
..'' recalled Kohl, who said the scenes of suffering were sharp
among his childhood memories.
   ``It is true that too many people in Germany and some abroad were
blinded and deceived by that tyrant,'' Kohl said, referring to
Hitler. But he said ``we should beware of making hasty judgements
from today's vantage point.''
   ``Who among us can say with a good conscience that, confronted
with such evil, they would have summoned the strength to be martyrs?
And who among us can judge what it meant at that time to risk not
only one's own life but the lives of one's family as well?'' he
asked.
   ``People today are no better and no worse than the people of that
era, but they are not under compulsion to make decisions in the
conditions prevailing under totalitarianism.''
   Kohl's 50-minute speech was interrupted by applause only once,
when he expressed West Germany's wish for the success of Poland's
new leadership.
   Kohl plans to visit Poland this fall, but the trip hinges on
resolution of remaining political differences between the two
states, as well as a package of economic aid.
   The still-fragile relations with Poland also figured prominently
in the anniversary addresses of President Richard von Weizsaecker
and former Chancellor Willy Brandt.
   ``Countless are the victims and indescribable is the suffering
which the people of your country had to bear during and after the
war,'' Weizsaecker wrote in a letter to Polish President Wojciech
Jaruzelski on the occasion.
   ``My country has given a binding promise that it will neither now
nor in the future make any territorial claims on Poland,''
Weizsaecker vowed.
   The Bundestag members voted unanimously to endorse Weizsaecker's
call for reconciliation with Poland.
   Nearly one-third of present-day Poland was once part of Germany,
and Poles consider any claims to that property to indicate
revanchism among West Germans.
   Suggestions among West German conservatives that reunification of
Germany could some day take place within the pre-war borders are
among the wedges that continue to separate West Germany and Poland.

   Construction spending recorded a slight
increase in July as strength in non-residential building offset
weakness in housing and government projects, the Commerce Department
reported Friday.
   The department said that spending rose by a tiny 0.02 percent, a
gain of $100 million, putting the seasonally adjusted annual rate at
$415.7 billion in July.
   The increase followed a 0.9 percent decline in June and an
advance of 0.8 percent in May.
   While the July rebound was modest, analysts said it offered at
least the hope that the lengthy construction slump may be coming to
an end.
   Allen Sinai, chief economist for the Boston Co., noted that new
home sales and construction starts for new homes, were beginning to
advance after a steep drop in the first part of 1989. He said that
rebound would soon be reflected in the construction spending report
and would help to lift the overall figure.
   ``Construction is on its way up because the lower mortgage rates
have boosted sales,'' he said.
   Sales of both new and existing homes fell sharply earlier in the
year as mortgage rates climbed to a high of 11.22 percent in late
March. Rates then began falling and dropped as low as 9.81 percent
in late July.
   The Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp. said that rates have been
rising slightly in recent weeks and as of Friday the national
average for fixed-rate mortgages stood at 10.22 percent.
   Analysts said they did not believe the small increase in rates
would be enough to dampen demand as long as mortgages don't rise
much further.
   In July, all of the strength came in non-residential
construction, which was up 0.9 percent to an annual rate of $99.7
billion. It was the third consecutive monthly gain in this sector,
following even stronger increases of 1.4 percent in June and 1.1
percent in May.
   The July increase was led by a 3.4 percent jump in spending for
hotels and motels and a 3.1 percent gain in factory building
projects.
   Residential construction edged down 0.2 percent to an annual rate
of $198.2 billion with single-family construction dipping 0.1
percent while multi-family building was off a sharper 1.7 percent.
   Government construction spending fell by 1.2 percent in July to
an annual rate of $80.9 billion as the biggest single government
category, highway construction, dropped 4 percent.
   The total construction figure was up a slight 1.2 percent from
the level of building a year ago.

<TEXT>
   Shellfire blanketed Beirut on Friday,
smashing apartments, setting woodlands ablaze and gutting the
hilltop Casino de Liban, a relic of the days when this devastated
city was the playground of the Middle East.
   At least 11 people were killed and 66 wounded in one of the
fiercest exchanges of the 6-month-old artillery war between the
Christian army units of Gen. Michel Aoun and a Moslem alliance led
by the 40,000 Syrian troops in Lebanon.
   Police said 80 shells and rockets a minute fell on the city and
surrounding wooded hills hills at the height of the battle. Some
neighborhoods on both sides of the sectarian dividing line became
infernos of flaming buildings.
   At least 823 people have been killed and 2,420 wounded, by police
count, since the shelling began March 8. Nearly all the casualties
have been civilians.
   Barrages from long-range Syrian artillery covered virtually all
the besieged 310-square-mile enclave north and east of Beirut, in
which 1 million Christians have been trapped for months.
   Aoun's artillery hammered Syrian-controlled west Beirut, the
Druse Moslem stronghold in the Chouf Mountains southeast of the
capital and the main Syrian supply route through the Bekaa Valley of
east Lebanon.
   Fighting intensified Thursday after reports that the peace
mission of French envoy Francois Scheer had collapsed. France, which
governed Lebanon by mandate until 1943, seeks an end to arms
supplies for all factions, withdrawal of foreign forces and reform
of sectarian power-sharing.
   Scheer left Beirut on Wednesday for Saudi Arabia to meet with
King Fahd, head of a three-member Arab League committee trying to
find a solution to the 14-year-old civil war.
   Police said 130mm Syrian artillery in the central mountains hit
the state-owned Casino du Liban north of Beirut with at least 80
shells, setting it on fire.
   The landmark casino overlooking the Mediterranean was the largest
in the Middle East, a symbol of the carefree days before the war,
which has taken 150,000 lives.
   Associated Press newsman Bahjat Jaber reported by telephone from
the Christian port of Jounieh, north of Beirut, that ``hundreds of
shells and rockets'' were landing.
   ``They're shelling the coast, the mountains, the towns and the
road network,'' Jaber said. ``The whole area's burning.''
   Voice of Lebanon, a Christian radio station, said the ``Syrian
death mill toils without letup, spitting out destruction in every
direction.''
   Beirut Radio, controlled by Aoun, said the escalated shelling was
Syria's ``reply to efforts aimed at finding a settlement.''
   Forest fires raged out of control in the hills around Beirut. In
the city, ambulances raced through smoky streets filled with rubble
from wrecked and blazing apartment buildings.
   Hospitals are short of space and medicine. Shellfire has damaged
most of them. Barbir Hospital was hit 130 rounds in one four-day
period.
   Casualties appeared amazingly low given the level of shelling,
but most of Beirut's 1.5 million people have gone abroad or fled to
safer parts of the country. The approximately 150,000 still in the
city spent Thursday night and Friday in underground shelters.
   Police said Christian gunners knocked out a radar-controlled
130mm howitzer nicknamed ``Abu Abdo'' on the seafront road in Moslem
west Beirut. Several Syrian guns along that stretch have been
destroyed in recent weeks.
   Abu Abdo _ which translates roughly to ``Father of the Tough
Guy'' _ and other 130mm guns have fired on ships trying to reach
Christian ports north of Beirut with arms and other supplies.
   Police said a freighter dashed into Jounieh with a cargo of fruit
and vegetables soon after the gun was silenced. They said it was
driven back by Syrian fire on its first try earlier Friday.
   On Tuesday, Syrian gunners hit a Maltese-flag tanker bound for a
Christian port and set it afire, killing nine of the 11 crewmen.
   Aoun's command said its men repulsed two overnight probes by
Syrian-backed militias along the southern and eastern flanks of the
Christian enclave.
   A spokesman, who would not let his name be used, said Christian
gunners destroyed a Syrian ammunition dump in pine woods near
Bolonia, 16 miles northeast of Beirut. He said at least two howitzer
shells hit a Syrian army base in an unfinished seven-story building
in west Beirut.
   The Syrian command does not comment on its losses.
   Syrian soldiers are in Lebanon under an Arab League peacekeeping
mandate issued in 1976, a year after the sectarian civil war began.
Aoun calls them an occupation force and has declared a ``war of
liberation'' to drive them out.

   Police arrested Anglican
Archbishop Desmond Tutu and hundreds of other activists nationwide
Friday as clerics, students and workers staged protests in support
of a growing anti-apartheid campaign.
   Tutu, winner of the 1984 Nobel Peace Prize, was arrested along
with his wife and 34 other protesters as they marched outside St.
George's Cathedral to protest the alleged beating of church workers
by police earlier in the day.
   Tutu and the others were released several hours later.
   ``We are going to defy until freedom comes,'' Tutu told several
hundred supporters after his release. ``I'm increasingly proud of
being part of a community that has decided we have had enough.''
   Police spokesman Brig. Leon Mellet said all 36 could face
prosecution under a law that prohibits demonstrations near
Parliament. The march took place about 200 yards from Parliament.
   Police also threatened Friday to take ``decisive action'' against
members of the media who defy state-of-emergency regulations that
prohibit reporting on unrest.
   About 20 protesters from the Western Province Council of Churches
said police used batons and whips Friday to chase them from a
security police office in Cape Town, where they had gone to condemn
recent detentions of activists.
   Tutu described the beatings as ``utterly, utterly scandalous. It
was a peaceful demonstration.''
   Later, when Tutu and the other activists left St. George's, which
Tutu heads, they encountered police who formed a human barricade.
Police told the demonstrators to disperse, then led them into vans
when they refused.
   In Washington, State Department spokeswoman Margaret Tutwiler
said the United States had made its concern known to the South
African government and has asked for a full report on the incident.
   ``Once again, we urge the South African government to permit the
peaceful expression of political dissent,'' she said.
   Canon Winston Ndungane, chief executive officer of Anglican
Church in South Africa, called Tutu's arrest ``a further indication
that the authorities will use whatever means possible to prevent a
man of peace going about his work.''
   ``When (Tutu's) peaceful intervention is met by this kind of
behavior, it lessens whatever hope we have of ending the conflict in
this country,'' Ndungane said.
   Tutu's wife, Leah, was among about 200 women arrested Wednesday
in Cape Town for staging an unauthorized protest. The women were
released without bail and told to appear in court next month.
   Tutu, the first black to lead the Anglican Church in southern
Africa, has played a prominent role in the nationwide defiance
campaign launched Aug. 2. The campaign is aimed at challenging
segregation laws and mobilizing opposition to the Sept. 6
parliamentary elections, which exclude the 28-million black majority.
   On Saturday, activists planned an illegal protest march on
Parliament and also planned to defy a police ban by holding a huge
rally in Soweto, the township outside Johannesburg. On Sunday,
blacks have scheduled a mass picnic on a whites-only beach in the
Indian Ocean city of Durban.
   Police have arrested or detained scores of activists in the past
week, and more were reported Friday in cities nationwide.
   Several blocks from the site of Tutu's march, police arrested
more than 100 college and university teachers for staging an illegal
anti-government protest on a pedestrian mall.
   In Durban, police arrested about 300 students, both black and
white, who were demonstrating just outside the University of Natal
campus.
   On Cape Town's outskirts, where police and militant youths have
clashed daily for several weeks, several mixed-race students
reportedly were wounded when officers fired tear gas and birdshot to
disperse a protest rally.
   Police said they were ``deeply concerned about the screening
abroad of film material featuring scenes of unrest.''
   ``Police hereby issue an early warning to the media to strictly
comply with all media emergency regulations,'' a statement said.
   Under the 3-year-old state of emergency, reporting on police
action and unrest is prohibited without permission from authorities.
   The restrictions have not been enforced comprehensively, but
photographers and television cameramen have had their film
confiscated by police with increasing frequency in recent weeks.
   Thousands of black union members, meanwhile, joined the defiance
campaign Friday, staging work stoppages at their factories to
protest a labor law they say cripples their power to strike.
   One of the biggest union protests was at the Unilever Ltd.
factory in Boksburg, east of Johannesburg, where about 1,000 workers
marched around the premises, many carrying placards denouncing the
year-old Labor Relations Amendment Act.
   The two main black labor federations have joined other major
anti-apartheid groups in calling for a national protest next Tuesday
and Wednesday against the elections. In the past, such protests have
taken the form of a general strike.
   The labor relations act has been the subject of a bitter dispute
among the government, employers and unions since it was drafted by
government officials last year.
   Employers agreed to some changes after unions complained it would
virtually eliminate their ability to strike. But several provisions
remain which they unions say are unacceptable, including a
prohibition on sympathy strikes by workers not directly involved in
a contract dispute.
   Friday's protest was endorsed by the 1 million-member Congress of
South African Trade Unions and by the 500,000-member National
Council of Trade Unions.

   East German leader Erich Honecker has been released
from the hospital and is recovering well, the state-run ADN news
agency said Friday.
   Honecker, 77, was taking a vacation to rest and recover from
recent gall-bladder surgery, the news agency said in a one-sentence
dispatch.
   Honecker's operation has prompted a flurry of speculation about
his health. East German media reported Thursday that Honecker's
recovery was proceeding slowly, but denied West German reports that
the operation had to be abandoned because of the ``condition of the
tissue.''
   East German officials called reports that Honecker was seriously
ill with cancer ``totally unfounded.''
   Western diplomatic sources have said Honecker would not travel to
Leipzig to open the international trade fair there Sunday and he was
not present at ceremonies in East Berlin Friday called to mark the
50th anniversary of the beginning of World War II.
   Honecker underwent a gall-bladder operation two weeks ago and has
not been seen in public since.
   The orthodox communist leader has ruled the country of 16.6
million people since 1971.

<HEAD>Marcos Denied Burial In National Cemetery, Wife Says</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HONOLULU (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Federal officials have rejected a request that
former Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos be buried at the
National Memorial Cemetery of the Pacific here, his wife, Imelda
Marcos, said Friday.
   But federal officials in Washington said Friday that no request
had been received from Mrs. Marcos.
   Mrs. Marcos said she made the request when Marcos was very
critically ill in June and was not expected to live more than a few
days. He has rallied somewhat but remains in critical condition at
St. Francis Hospital.
   Marcos turns 72 later this month.
   His wife told The Honolulu Advertiser that she sought burial in
the national cemetery because her husband fought alongside Americans
during World War II and because current Philippine President Corazon
Aquino has said Marcos will not be allowed to return to the
Philippines dead or alive.
   Alan Sumitomo, a supervisor at the cemetery, said that to be
eligible for burial there, a person must be a veteran of U.S. armed
forces with honorable or general discharge or a dependent of a
veteran. Exceptions to the rule can be made by the federal
Department of Veterans Affairs, he said.
   Mrs. Marcos said the request was made to U.S. Veterans Affairs
Secretary Edward J. Derwinski through her Washington attorney,
Richard Hibey. She said Derwinski told Hibey there was ``no way''
that Marcos would be allowed burial in the national cemetery.
   But Pam Siciliano, spokeswoman for the Department of Veterans
Affairs, said Friday: ``We are not aware of any conversation or
contact between Mr. Derwinski and Mrs. Marcos or her attorney.''
   Derwinski was in Poland representing President Bush at World War
II commemoration ceremonies and was to return Sunday.
   ``We have not received a request from the Marcos family for
information on Mr. Marcos' eligibility for burial in a national
cemetery, and we can't discuss or make a final determination about
his eligibility until we have a contact from the family or Mrs.
Marcos,'' Ms. Siciliano said.
   There was no listing in Washington telephone directories for a
lawyer named Hibey.
   The national cemetery is located in Puowaina Crater, more
commonly known as Punchbowl, and overlooks Honolulu. It is the
burial place of World War II correspondent Ernie Pyle and astronaut
Ellison Onizuka, who died in the space shuttle Challenger disaster.
   The Marcoses have lived in Honolulu since they were ousted in a
popular revolt that swept Mrs. Aquino to power in February 1986.
They face a U.S. indictment accusing them of stealing more than $100
million from the Philippines treasury and stashing the money in the
United States.
   Mrs. Marcos previously said she would never bury her husband
anywhere but in the Philippines. She said she thought burial in the
Honolulu veterans cemetery would be a way to resolve the controversy.
   However, she said she continues to hope that Marcos will be
allowed to return to the Philippines to die in his country or to be
buried there.
   ``I will take (his remains) to the airport and wait there as long
as necessary,'' she said.

   A man accused of drowning his children by
ramming the family station wagon through a barrier and into the
murky Detroit River was ordered Friday to stand trial on four counts
of first-degree murder.
   Lawrence DeLisle, 28, also will be tried on a charge of attempted
murder for allegedly trying to kill his wife, Suzanne DeLisle, 32,
who was in the car and frantically tried to save their four children
Aug. 3.
   Police say DeLisle confessed to crashing deliberately to be
relieved of his ``burdens.'' But he later renewed his original claim
that it was accidental, and that a leg cramp made him jam down the
gas pedal, and his wife said the confession was coerced.
   DeLisle's eyes watered when District Court Judge Lawrence Emmert
bound him over for trial after a preliminary examination in this
Detroit suburb.
   Emmert, who reviewed videotapes, audio tapes and a manuscript of
DeLisle's lie-detector test and police interrogation, said the
defendant's confession was not coerced and may be used as evidence.
   DeLisle's attorney, Frank Eaman, said the tapes shouldn't be used
because police pressured DeLisle. He said he plans to appeal.
   Wayne County Assistant Prosecutor Kevin Simowski maintained
DeLisle was questioned properly.
   ``Police never threatened him. Police, if anything, were
sympathetic,'' he said. ``He didn't break down during any of the
interviews.''
   Emmert said critical testimony came from two witnesses who saw
DeLisle's car accelerate straight toward the river.
   ``Neither of them indicated that the car deviated at all,'' he
said.
   Mrs. DeLisle, who says she believes her husband is innocent,
testified Thursday that as her husband's leg cramped, she grabbed
the steering wheel and pulled to the right while he pulled to the
left and tried to grab his foot off the gas pedal. Police tests of
the car found no mechanical defects.
   She said she tried to save her children after the car hit the
bottom of the river. The couple were rescued by boaters who then
tried to dive for the children.
   Bryan, 8; Melissa, 4; Kathryn, 2; and Emily, 8 months, died at a
hospital within hours of the crash.

<TEXT>
   A 69-year-old woman was evicted from her
government-subsidized apartment by a judge who called it a
``shooting gallery and a haven for drug dealing'' and said she had
done nothing to stop it.
   Thursday's eviction was the first of its kind under a new
anti-drug clause in Austin Housing Authority leases that allows the
eviction of a family if one member is arrested on a narcotics charge.
   Justice of the Peace Ricardo Madrigal said that Novella Caro _
who shares the three-bedroom apartment with a daughter,
granddaughter and grandson _ knew of the drug activities and failed
to stop them.
   Madrigal ordered Ms. Caro out of the apartment within five days.
   Ms. Caro's apartment was raided twice by police in eight months.
Police said several people were arrested and that cocaine, marijuana
and drug paraphernalia were confiscated.
   Ms. Caro was not arrested and was not present during the raids.
But Madrigal ruled that Ms. Caro, as head of the household, should
be held responsible for the activities.
   A resident of local housing projects nearly 18 years, Ms. Caro
said she will live with a daughter for a while, and ``after that, I
don't know.'' She receives $362 a month in Social Security benefits.
   She said she knew her daughters used drugs but did not know that
drugs were being sold or used in her house.
   But information in police reports and testimony in Thursday's
trial suggested otherwise.
   According to one report, a police informant had purchased cocaine
from her. The president of the housing project's tenants council and
Ms. Caro's neighbor, Lou Cora McCarther, said that twice she
witnessed Ms. Caro's participation in narcotics deals.

<HEAD>Farmers Can Apply for 1989 Crop Losses, USDA Chief Says</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Farmers whose 1989 crops have been wiped out or
reduced sharply by drought and floods can begin applying for federal
payments on Sept. 15, Agriculture Secretary Clayton Yeutter said
Friday.
   Applications can be filed at county offices of the department's
Agricultural Stabilization and Conservation Service through April
27, 1990, he said.
   Congress authorized nearly $900 million in federal payments under
the Disaster Assistance Act of 1989 for farmers who suffered crop
losses of more than 35 percent to 50 percent of normal production,
depending on whether they participated in this year's commodity
programs.
   ``Our ASCS field staff will process disaster payment requests as
quickly as possible to get financial aid to those farmers who have
suffered crop losses due to drought, excessive moisture and other
perils,'' Yeutter said in a statement.
   One of the USDA provisions will deduct the value of a replacement
crop to determine a farmer's disaster payment for losses on his
first crop.
   For example, if a farmer's winter wheat crop was wiped out and he
planted grain sorghum to replace it, the grain sorghum's value would
be considered in computing the disaster aid that was due.
   A formula will be used to account for the production costs of the
planting and harvesting the replacement crop on so-called failed
acres. The idea is to come up with a net value figure for the
replacement crop.
   An agency official, Tom VonGarlem, explained the formula
operation in an example:
   Suppose a farmer planted grain sorghum, or milo, on failed winter
wheat land, and harvests 30 bushels per acre this fall. The formula
calls for 75 percent of the output to be the farmer's net production
of sorghum _ 22.5 bushels per acre.
   At around $2 per bushel, the sorghum would have a value of $45
per acre. VonGarlem said this is what would be deducted from the
disaster payment that the farmer otherwise would get for losing his
winter wheat.

   President Bush said Friday the United States
will have no diplomatic contact with the new Panamanian government
approved by Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega and he promised additional
economic measures will be taken against that country.
   At the State Department, spokeswoman Margaret Tutwiler called the
appointment of the new government by Panama's Council of State ``a
thinly disguised coup d'etat.'' She dismissed the new unelected
president as the ``latest puppet'' of Noriega.
   The United States has recognized as the legitimate authority in
Panama President Eric Arturo Delvalle, who was ousted by Noriega's
allies in February 1988. But Delvalle's term in office would have
ended Friday, and the administration ceased recognizing him as
Panama's constitutional leader.
   The U.S. Embassy in Panama continues to function but Bush made
clear in his statement that ``we will not have any diplomatic
contact with the Noriega regime.''
   U.S. Ambassador Arthur Davis, who was withdrawn from Panama in
May, will not return, Bush said.
   ``This should have been a proud day for Panamanians and for all
who believe in self-determination and democracy,'' Bush said.
   ``Instead, it is a sad day _ a sad day for Panama and for the
democratic nations of this hemisphere.''
   In effect, little changed with Friday's statements since the
United States has had no official dealings with the Noriega-led
goverment for 18 months and no change is contemplated for the new
team he has assembled.
   As for Delvalle, he has spent much of that time in hiding and
wielded no power.
   Still, the administration used the occasion of the appointment of
a new leadership in Panama to intensify its campaign against Noriega.
   ``Noriega's naming of a so-called `provisional government' is
completely outside Panama's constitution, and is, in effect, a
thinly disguised coup d'etat,'' Ms. Tutwiler said. ``Noriega's is an
outlaw regime.''
   She spoke disdainfully of the figurehead president, Francisco
Rodriguez, who was named to replace outgoing President Manuel Solis
Palma.
   ``Noriega's latest puppet president is an unknown within Panama
with no political following, whose chief qualification for the
position seems to have been his long-time friendship with Noriega,
and his slavish loyalty to the dictator,'' Ms. Tutwiler said.
   Diplomatic hostility to Panama, she said, is being reflected in
the decision of a number of countries, including Venezuela, Peru,
Uruguay, Colombia, Brazil, Chile and Argentina, to withdraw their
ambassadors from Panama City.
   Bush said that the administration will ``continue to take other
steps ... to deprive the illegal regime of funds that belong to the
Panamanian people.'' He did not elaborate.
   Early last year, the United States began withholding from Panama
revenues payable to that country for Panama Canal operations. Among
other actions, trade sanctions were imposed and Panamanian assets in
the United States were frozen. The amount of frozen assets is in the
$300 million range.
   Officials said privately a number of options are being considered
for further tightening of the exisiting sanctions but they gave no
additional details.
   An elected president was to have been sworn in Friday in Panama
but authorities there voided the May 7 elections after independent
observers concluded that the anti-Noriega candidate had won in a
landslide.
   National security adviser Brent Scowcroft, talking to reporters
who accompanied Bush on an Air Force One flight back to
Kennebunkport, Maine Friday, said the United States is ``rethinking
all aspects of our relationship with Panama,'' including U.S.
posture on the Panama Canal treaties and further economic sanctions.
   ``There could be other steps including economic,'' he told
reporters, but he declined to discuss what they might be.
   Asked if he had run out of options and why the United States had
not taken further steps before now, he said, ``because we didn't
want to increase the suffering of the Panamanian people.''
   Regarding the canal, Scowcroft said the choices were to abide by
the treaties, suspend them or abrogate them, but said there are no
plans to take action at this time.
   He said the exercises by U.S. troops in Panama will continue,
``to keep our troops alert ... to the extent we may have to defend
the Panama Canal against whatever.''

<HEAD>Appeals Court Overturns Decision Throwing Out Small Town's Dance
Ban</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PURDY, Mo. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An appeals court on Friday reversed a judge's
ruling that a small town school district's ban on dancing violated
the constitutional separation of church and state, paving the way
for the Purdy school board to resume its ban.
   The ruling by a three-judge panel of the 8th U.S. Circuit Court
of Appeals in St. Louis is ``a victory for losers and hypocrites,''
a plaintiff in the case said Friday, and her attorney vowed to
appeal.
   U.S. District Judge Russell Clark ruled in August 1988 that the
nearly century-old ban on dancing at the Purdy school
unconstitutionally promoted the values of residents who opposed
dancing for religious reasons. Clark said he did not believe the
board's claim that the ban was simply a policy matter.
   The school board had said it supported the ban not because of
religion, but because of possible drinking and discipline problems
and because it was an unnecessary expense.
   Although the school board appealed Clark's ruling it allowed
students to hold a homecoming dance last December.
   The case drew wide attention in part because of the similarities
to the hit motion picture ``Footloose.''
   The 8th Circuit panel noted Friday that many of the 900 residents
of Purdy, a Ozarks mountain town in southwestern Missouri, were
religious conservatives. But the judges panel said there was no
unconstitutional mingling of church and state just because the ban
adhered to the conservatives' religious views.
   ``We simply do not believe elected government officials are
required to check at the door whatever religious background ... they
carry with them before they act on rules that are otherwise
unobjectionable under the controlling ... standards,'' the panel
said.
   The appeals court said the plaintiffs should support school board
candidates whose views mirror their own instead of going to the
courts.
   ``Political divisiveness along religious lines ... is not a
proper consideration except in cases involving financial aid to
parochial schools,'' the appeals panel said.
   Ransom Ellis, an attorney for the school district, said he was
pleased with the new ruling. ``I know that the school board and the
defendants in the case were also very pleased,'' he said.
   But William Fleischaker, an attorney representing students and
parents who sued to have the near century-old ban revoked, said he
would ask the full nine-judge appeals court to consider the case and
that he would take it to the U.S. Supreme Court if necessary.
   The appeals panel ``ignored in its finding the vast amount of
evidence that the school board, in retaining the (dance ban), acted
with specific intent to promote a religious view,'' Fleischaker said.
   Joan Fox, one of the parents in Purdy who sued to have the ban
revoked, was outraged at Friday's ruling.
   ``I think it's a victory for losers and hypocrites in a community
where cowardice and bigotry sustains them,'' she said.

<DATELINE>WARSAW, Poland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Pope John Paul II, speaking to Poles Friday
via TV from the Vatican, recalled the horrors that gripped the
capital of his native land 50 years ago with the Nazi invasion of
Poland.
   The pope's speech was part of an international ``Day of Prayer
for Peace'' in Warsaw, attended by leaders of the Roman Catholic
Church and other religions, to coincide with the 50th anniversary of
the start of World War II. But Poland's only rabbi stayed away to
protest the presence of a Catholic convent outside the Auschwitz
concentration camp in southern Poland.
   ``On Sept. 1, 1939, with the invasion of Poland, began a long and
painful period of suffering of humanity, of Christians and Jews, of
everyone,'' the pontiff said, his image appearing on a large TV
screen overlooking Warsaw's Victory Square.
   ``Fifty years later, what sounds on Warsaw streets is not the
echo of heavy soldier's boots ... but the light and friendly steps
of pilgrims, men and women professing different faiths, who come
from all parts of the world. They have no power other than the power
of memories, which stimulates reflection and fervent prayer for
peace,'' the pontiff said in Polish.
   ``The memory of World War II, and the local conflicts that have
been going on for the past 50 years, and those which still
tragically continue, obliges all of us to persist in the aim to
eliminate war from all parts of the world, so it ceases to be a tool
for resolving disputes,'' he said.
   In Warsaw, banners of black changing into Poland's white and red
colors hung from the windows of the Royal Castle, painstakingly
rebuilt in the 1970s after being leveled during the war along with
much of Warsaw.
   Around the square hung a rainbow banner decorated with a dove and
``Peace'' written in many languages. A huge billboard proclaimed:
``War Never Again.''
   Photographs of the destruction of Warsaw were shown on a TV
screen set up for the pope's address, and smoke was released from
the castle tower to recall its burning in September 1939 after being
struck by a German bomb.
   On Friday evening, Leonard Bernstein conducted an anniversary
symphony concert at the Grand Theater.
   Earlier, Solidarity leaders joined Communist President Wojciech
Jaruzelski in a display of national unity at the Baltic port of
Gdansk as the country honored the small Polish garrison that exactly
50 years ago bore the first fierce Nazi onslaught of World War II.
   On one side of Jaruzelski was Solidarity leader Lech Walesa; on
the other was newly elected Prime Minister Tadeusz Mazowiecki, a
longtime union adviser.
   A third senior Solidarity adviser, Senate Speaker Andrzej
Stelmachowski, stood a few steps behind the president, who used the
occasion to stress the theme of national understanding.
   ``On this day of great national memories we look not only into
the past but also into the future, into the near future and that
which is still far ahead,'' said the president.
   ``We should never again be weak, quarreling or isolated,'' said
Jaruzelski. ``Tomorrow, Poland must be stronger than today, through
its economic potential and most of all through mutual effort,
agreement and national reconciliation.''
   Sitting in the front row were 53 veterans of the legendary
garrison that endured the guns of the German warship
Schleswig-Holstein and staved off a determined infantry assault for
seven days.
   ``I shot ... at the enemy. It was my duty,'' said Wiktor
Bialous-Bielas, 73, wearing his uniform and holding a sword as he
recalled the morning 50 years ago when the war began.
   World War II began with the battleship's opening salvo on
Westerplatte, a Polish outpost in then pro-German Free City of
Danzig, at 4:45 a.m. on Sept. 1, 1939.
   Isolated from the rest of Poland, the stubborn resistance of the
182 Polish soldiers on Westerplatte served as an inspiration for
Poles who continued the battle against Hitler until the march into
Berlin nearly six years later.
   Jaruzelski and Mazowiecki returned to Warsaw after the ceremony,
while Walesa attended a Solidarity Mass celebrated by Gdansk Bishop
Tadeusz Goclowski in a wooded glade nearby.
   Earlier, Walesa, Mazowiecki and Senate Speaker Andrzej
Stelmachowski _ another Solidarity activist _ visited the workers'
monument erected by the union in 1980 in front of the Lenin
Shipyard, where it was born.
   Mazowiecki laid red and white flowers at the towering columns
dedicated to workers killed during riots along the Baltic coast in
1970.
   The Solidarity leaders then bowed to the crowd and Walesa led the
singing of the Polish national anthem.
   Stelmachowski, viewing the former political prisoners celebrating
their victories against Communist control, said: ``I still have an
impression that I am playing a strange part in a very strange
theater.''

<HEAD>Clergy Accuse Roh of Suppressing Opposition</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Hundreds of clergymen accused President
Roh Tae-woo's government Friday of suppressing political opposition
and stalling on democratic reforms. They backed radical students'
demands for unifying South and North Korea.
   ``The government is causing people's life to collapse with the
suppression of human rights,'' the Korean National Council of
Churches said in its first major stand against Roh.
   Riot police battled about 1,500 students who hurled rocks and
firebombs as they demanded Roh's ouster and the disbanding of the
government intellence agency.
   The agency quoted a jailed student leader as saying his group had
received $30,000 from a pro-North Korean student alliance in Japan
to support its protests.
   The church statement came from the council representing more than
1,800 Christian ministers who claimed more than 800 political
prisoners have been arrested in recent months.
   They also accused Roh of being more undemocratic than his
dictatorial predecessors.
   ``The church will stand in the vanguard in the fight for
democratization of South Korea and unification of the two Koreas,''
said the statement issued after an overnight prayer meeting at a
downtown Anglican church.
   ``Movements for independence, democratization and unification
have been denounced as leftist and pro-communist,'' said the
statement.
   It said violence, torture and surveillance are ``threatening the
people's rights to survival and causing the people to tremble in a
sense of crisis.''
   The council, the largest Christian group in South Korea where
one-fourth of the 42 million people are Christian, was an active
political force during past authoritarian regimes.
   Roh has carried out wide democratic reforms since he took office
in February 1988 but critics argue he has not done enough.
   Opponents are especially critical of his failure to clear the
legacy of his disgraced predecessor, Chun Doo-hwan, who is under
public fire for alleged corruption and power abuse involving his
family and former aides.
   Later Friday, some 1,000 radical students attacked police in
front of Seoul's Joongang University Campus to press demands that
the Agency for National Security Planning be disbanded.
   Students claimed the agency, the main government intelligence
body, is blocking democratic development and efforts by South
Korea's ``democratic forces'' to promote unification with communist
North Korea.
   At Korea University, also in Seoul, 500 students yelled
``Overthrow Roh Tae-woo!'' as they attacked riot police. They
demanded the release of a radical student under arrest for an
illegal trip to North Korea. Police retaliated with tear gas.
   The government intelligence agency announced a major radical
student group, the National Council of Student Representatives, had
received $30,000 from a pro-North Korean student alliance in Japan.
   The agency quoted Oh Yong-shik, a former head of the Seoul-based
group student group who is now in jail on anti-state charges, as
confessing he was given the money in August 1988 for anti-government
campus and street demonstrations.

   A University of Florida professor was
shot to death Friday and police arrested one of his graduate
students, authorities said.
   Arthur Kimura, 41, an associate professor of pathology at the
School of Medicine, was found shot in his home shortly after
deputies received a call that a burglar alarm had gone off at the
residence, said Alachua County sheriff's detective Capt. Andy
Hamilton.
   ``A vehicle seen leaving the residence was stopped shortly after
the call by an Alachua deputy,'' Hamilton said.
   Jens Peter Hansen, 41, of Gainesville was taken into custody from
the car and charged with first-degree murder, the captain said.
   The motive for the slaying was still under investigation, he
added.
   Hansen was a doctoral candidate studying under Kimura, said Larry
Lansford, a university spokesman, but the school did not immediately
have additional information about him.
   Kimura, had taught at the Gainesville school since 1980 and
specialized in cancer research, Lansford said.
   He was ``a highly respected scientist and a valuable faculty
member of the pathology department,'' said Dr. Noel Maclaren, head
of the department.

<HEAD>Heavy Rain In Illinois And Indiana</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Thunderstorms developing ahead of a cold front dropped up to 8
inches of rain Friday and whipped up damaging wind in parts of the
Midwest, and rain was scattered from the Plains to the Southeast.
   Storms in Indiana knocked out power, flooded streets and routed
more than 100 migrant workers from their temporary homes. Three
people were injured, none seriously, in Pulaski County when high
wind overturned a mobile home. About 40 homes were damaged in
Pulaski and neighboring Fulton County.
   The heaviest rain fell near Kokomo, Ind., where gauges topped out
at between 6 and 8 inches, said meteorologist Ed Price of the
National Weather Service.
   ``This rain sort of came as a big surprise,'' said Brian
Reichart, vice president of Red Gold Inc., a tomato canning company
at Orestes, Ind.
   He said flooding forced about 100 migrant workers and 30 children
from a camp early Friday; they were taken to the canning factory
nearby and later moved to a Red Cross shelter.
   ``We had some scared little kids,'' Reichart said. He said it
probably would be several days before the migrant camp and the
canning factory could reopen.
   Schools in Elwood and other Indiana communities were closed, and
some classes at Ball State University in Muncie were canceled
because of flooded buildings.
   At Kokomo, workers at several Delco Electronics Corp. plants were
sent home because the plants were flooded, and Public Service
Indiana said power was out to almost one-third of the city,
including a Chrysler plant.
   Nearly 3 inches of rain fell at Springfield, Ill., during the
morning, close to the amount of rain normally received there during
the entire month of September.
   Heavier rainfall totals for the 6 hours up to 2 p.m. EDT included
2.08 inches at Indianapolis; 1.76 inches at Dayton, Ohio; and 1.13
inches at Alpena, Mich.
   The cold front bulged southward and showers and thunderstorms
also developed ahead of it from the Texas Panhandle through southern
Kansas, southern Missouri, and southern sections of the Ohio Valley.
   Showers and thunderstorms also were scattered across Florida and
across Alabama into eastern Tennessee.
   Elsewhere, rain was scattered over northern New England and
Washington state.
   Afternoon temperatures were only in the 60s along the Pacific
Coast, in the Northwest and northern Rockies, the upper Mississippi
Valley, the Great Lakes and northern New England.
   Temperatures around the nation at 3 p.m. EDT ranged from 54
degrees at Caribou and Houlton, Maine, to 103 at Phoenix. Friday's
low for the Lower 48 states was 24 at Pinedale, Wyo.
   Pocatello, Idaho, chilled to a record low of 38 degrees.
   For Saturday, scattered showers and thunderstorms were forecast
from the lower Mississippi Valley and eastern Gulf Coast states to
New England and the lower Great Lakes. Scattered showers and
thunderstorms also were forecast from the northern high Plains to
the northern Pacific Coast. A few showers and thunderstorms were
forecast for the southern and central high Plains region.
   Highs in the upper 60s and 70s were predicted from the upper
Mississippi Valley through the Great Lakes region to northern New
England, across most of the Pacific Coast; in the 90s from the
southern Atlantic Coast to the southern high Plains; in the 90s or
above 100 in the desert Southwest and central valleys of California,
parts of central Texas; and in the 80s in most of the rest of the
nation.

   A federal judge ruled Friday in favor of United
Press International in a 12-year-old libel case stemming from the
death of a Hawaiian man who linked a public official to organized
crime.
   U.S. District Judge Charles Richey said the complainant in the
case failed to prove that the news report was false and the reporter
was protected under the ``neutral reporting doctrine.''
   The case revolves around the death of a Hawaiian environmental
activist named George Helm, who a biweekly newspaper on June 15,
1977 ``strongly implied'' had been killed by local underworld
figures.
   Dennis Stone, a UPI reporter, filed a story based on the
newspaper report and an interview with the missing man's father. The
story said the missing activist had been threatened by a member of
Hawaii's Board of Land and Natural Resources named Larry Mehau,
according to George Helm's brother and father.
   Stone's story also said the brother, Adolph, identified Mehau as
the ``godfather'' of Hawaii's underworld crime.
   In a subsequent dispatch the same day, Stone wrote that the
missing activist had told his brother, Adolph, that he was planning
to expose Mehau and others.
   The next day, UPI distributed a story detailing the Hawaii
governor's strong defense of Mehau and rejection of the bi-weekly
newspaper story.
   Mehau quickly sued UPI and lost two years later at the trial
level. On appeal, the Hawaii Supreme Court reversed the decision,
saying that Stone acted with actual malice when he filed his two
stories.
   The case was remanded to the federal court in Hawaii and removed
to the Disrict of Columbia when UPI went into bankruptcy here.
   Finally the case was switched from bankruptcy court to the
district court and ended up with Richey.
   ``... the disputed facts indicated the Mehau has failed to prove
by a fair preponderance of the evidence that Stone's reports are
false,'' said Richey.
   ``Further the undisputed facts indicated that Stone's reports are
absolutely protected under the neutral reportage doctrine, which the
Court adopts herein for the first time in this circuit.''

<HEAD>Defense Consultant Admits Selling Pentagon Bid Information</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES ROWLEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A defense consultant admitted Friday that he
sold Unisys Corp. confidential bid information about a Pentagon
contract for $24,750 and shared the proceeds with a fellow
consultant.
   William J. Sanda, 53, pleaded guilty in U.S. District Court in
Alexandria, Va., to a charge of conspiring to defraud the government
in connection with the sale of information to Unisys in 1987 about a
$100 million Marine Corps contract.
   Sanda, who was president Strategic Systems Institute of
Rockville, Md., agreed to cooperate with the Justice Department's
continuing investigation of Defense Department procurement fraud
dubbed ``Operation Ill Wind.''
   U.S. District Judge Claude Hilton scheduled sentencing for Dec.
1. Sanda could receive a five-year prison term and be fined up to
$250,000.
   His guilty plea signals that the Justice Department is preparing
to expand its investigation to include current and former Unisys
executives based in Eagan, Minn., who sought confidential bid
information on contract to build shelters for sophisticated
communications and electronic equipment used by the Marine Corps.
   Unisys spokesman Peter Hynes, declined to comment on Sanda's
guilty plea, said the company is cooperating with the probe.
   Sanda admitted that he agreed in March 1987 to be a ``front man''
for fellow consultant William Parkin.
   Under their arrangement, Sanda agreed to take a third of the fee
that Unisys paid while Parkin would receive the rest for providing
the inside information.
   Parkin, 65, has been sentenced to 26 months in prison and fined
$25,000 for his role in the procurement scandal. His cooperation
with the investigation appears to have helped prosecutors bring the
charge against Sanda.
   According to court papers, Sanda first approached an RCA employee
and offered to provide bid information about competitors. Sanda
later reported to Parkin that he was unable to work out a deal with
RCA, one of several companies bidding on the contract.
   Sanda soon reported that a Unisys Corp. marketing representative
expressed interest in purchasing information.
   The Unisys Corp. official is not named but was identified in
court papers unsealed earlier this year as marketing executive Ralph
Hughes, who Hynes said left the company in December 1988.
   Sanda showed Hughes a sample of bid information, later reporting
to Parkin that Hughes believed that Sanda ``had an inside source''
at the Pentagon, according to court papers.
   Unisys paid Sanda $19,500 under a consulting contract on Aug. 19,
1987. According to the court papers, Sanda cheated Parkin out of
$1,000 by telling his fellow consultant Unisys had paid $18,000.
   Sanda gave Parkin $12,000 instead of $13,000, which would have
been the two-thirds share of $19,500, according to court papers.
Parkin gave $6,000 to Thomas Muldoon, another defense consultant who
court papers say was the source of the bid documents, the court
papers said.
   Muldoon has been implicated but not charged in the ``Ill Wind''
probe.
   After receiving the first payment, Sanda reported that the Unisys
executive, again identified in earlier court filings as Hughes, told
him of a complaint to the Navy that Unisys had hired Sanda to gain
an unfair edge in the contract competition.
   Hughes had told Sanda that Unisys would have to ``fill a file
cabinet with data to support the contention that Sanda was doing
technical work'' for the company,'' according to court papers.
   Sanda later reported to Parkin that a Unisys vice president, not
identified in the court papers, suggested firing Sanda because of
the complaint but the company decided against to avoid appearing to
be engaged in wrongdoing.
   Sanda was paid another $5,250 by Unisys in November 1987, shortly
after he had advanced Parkin $4,000 for more information.
   The court document disclosed that Sanda tried to sell bid
information on Navy and Air Force radar test kits to Gould Inc.
Sanda told prosecutors he met with the president of Gould's NAVCOM
division but was not hired by the company.
   Sanda told prosecutors that he gave the Gould official
information about the company's own bid to show he had an ``inside
source'' but that the numbers were ``slightly off.''

   Fighting between government forces and
anti-communist rebels has intensified around the eastern city of
Khost, government and diplomatic sources said Friday.
   They said the guerrillas want to show they are still a force
despite deep divisions in the rebel alliance.
   The rebels have been battling to capture a provincial capital as
a seat for a provisional government since the Soviet Union withdrew
its troops in February after nine years of military intervention.
   Diplomatic sources, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the
offensive against Khost, 18 miles from the border with Pakistan,
appears to be the most organized attack since February.
   Naqib Sameer, deputy spokesman at the Foreign Ministry, noted a
non-aligned summit conference opens Monday in Yugoslavia, and said
the rebels ``want to show their power to the non-aligned conference.
The opposition groups are trying to cover their previous defeats.''
   The diplomats and Sameer said the rebels also want to be draw the
attention of the United Nations General Assembly, opening this month.
   Diplomatic sources said the government appeared to be having
trouble recapturing two military posts at Tani, south of Khost,
despite heavy use of the warplanes.
   Sameer denied that Khost was threatened, saying the posts had
changed hands a number of times since February.
   He said the guerillas used artillery, rockets and machine guns
against government positions in the Khost fighting over the previous
24 hours. He accused the Pakistani armed forces of supplying support
from across the border and claimed Saudi Arabian militiamen were
fighting in Afghanistan.
   Sameer said the Afghan armed forces were responding with
aircraft, artillery and rockets.
   Rebel failure to capture Jalalabad, 80 miles east of the capital
city of Kabul, and recent internal clashes within the rebel alliance
prompted questions in the U.S. Congress about further funding for
the rebels.
   In place of Jalalabad, Khost, the capital of eastern Paktia
province, is considered one of the softer targets because its
proximity to rebel bases in Pakistan makes it easier to organize
supply lines.
   In other combat, Sameer said government forces repulsed guerrilla
fighters in southeastern Kandahar province and around Jalalabad.
   The government said the road between Kabul and Jalalabad was open
again. In Kabul, the almost daily rocket attacks since June have
ebbed.
   Sameer said a rocket hit Kabul on Thursday in the Qali-e-Naharha
neighborhood, killing one civilian and injuring two.
   Diplomats said the lull was apparently from the guerrillas
concentrating their firepower on Khost and use of a new missile by
the government.
   The government has been using Soviet-designed SCUD ballistic
missiles, with a range of 170 miles, to fire on rebel positions near
Jalalabad and Khost from the capital.
   A new short-range weapon, perhaps a Soviet rocket known as a Frog
7, also is being used by government troops, the diplomats said. The
Frog 7 has a range of about 40 miles.
   They said the new rockets, first noticed last week, apparently
have extended the security belt around Kabul.
   Rocket attacks on Kabul since June have killed more than 300
people and injured more than 900.
   The rebels have been fighting to overthrow the soviet-supported
Marxist government for more than a decade.

   Former Vice President Walter F. Mondale
and four current and former legislators will travel to Warsaw this
month to advise Poland's new leaders on how to run a parliamentary
government, Mondale said.
   Mondale, Sen. Peter Domenici, R-N.M.; and former Sens. Howard
Baker, R-Tenn.; and Thomas Eagleton, D-Mo.; are traveling as private
citizens, not as representatives of the government, Mondale said
Thursday. The delegation is also to include former Rep. Jim Jones,
D-Okla.
   The U.S. group will advise Polish leaders on such parliamentary
matters as rules, powers and conducting debates, said Mondale, who
was a senator from Minnesota before becoming vice president in the
Carter administration.
   The trip follows the appointment last month of Solidarity editor
Tadeusz Mazowiecki as prime minister in a power-sharing arrangement
with the Communist Party, which has dominated Poland for more than
four decades.
   Mondale said that if Poland became independent of the Soviet
bloc, it would be a boost to U.S. security.
   ``If we can create and help create an independent Poland, that
would do more for the national security of this country than another
hundred billion dollars of guns, because if Poland is free, the
Russians could never fight a war in Europe,'' he said.
   The group, which also will include former U.S. Rep. Jim Jones,
D-Okla., will be attending a Sept. 21-23 conference on the role of
parliaments in developing economic policy, said Sue Grabowski of the
National Democratic Institute for International Affairs, which is
sponsoring the meeting.
   The event is not being held at the Polish government's
invitation, but parliamentary leaders have indicated they approve,
Grabowski said.
   Mondale is the institute's chairman.

   As news of Princess Anne's broken marriage swept
the British press, the separating couple and people close to them
fended off questioning journalists Friday.
   Anne, only daughter of Queen Elizabeth II, stayed through the end
of the International Olympic Committee's annual meeting in Puerto
Rico and left by private plane for a visit to Belize.
   Her husband, Capt. Mark Phillips, and their two children stayed
out of sight at their country estate in western England.
   Royal Navy Cmdr. Timothy Laurence, whose letters to Anne made
headlines this spring, told reporters he would not leave his house
until they went away.
   By the time Buckingham Palace confirmed Thursday that Anne, 39,
and her husband of nearly 16 years would separate, speculation about
Laurence's relationship with the princess was rife.
   Laurence, 35, told a reporter from an evening paper he was tipped
off Wednesday that a statement about Anne's marriage would be made
by Buckingham Palace and had decided to stay at home.
   ``Quite honestly, I'm prepared to stay here all day or as long as
it takes,'' he said.
   His neighbors in Winchester, 66 miles southwest of London, were
not so patient.
   The Daily Mirror said an elderly woman came out to harangue
reporters surrounding Laurence's house. It said she called them
``rotters,'' then sang three choruses of ``God Save The Queen,''
Britain's national anthem.
   Laurence was linked to Anne on April 8 when Buckingham Palace, in
an attempt to stop media speculation, announced that he was the
author of letters to the princess that were stolen from her home.
   On Friday, The Daily Mirror reported that a Canadian woman often
linked in news reports with Phillips also was besieged by reporters.
   The newspaper said Katherine Birks called police after
journalists surrounded her home in Caledon, Ontario. It said police
sealed off the street and escorted her jeep out of the driveway at
dawn.
   Lack of access to those involved has not stopped Britain's
tabloids from reporting on the royal separation.
   Most speculated on financial arrangements, although nothing is
known about what personal income Anne might have and little is known
about the income Phillips, 40, derives from his farming and
equestrian ventures.
   That did not keep The Sun from headlining, ``1 Million Pounds For
Mark,'' which it called ``a payoff from the queen,'' suggesting that
would keep him from telling his story of the marriage.
   Another paper, Today, decided it would be a ``3 Million Pound
Payoff'' for Phillips, basing its estimate on a lawyer's opinion
that he was entitled to 250,000 pounds ($390,000) for every 1
million pounds of Anne's money. It did not say how it determined how
much she had.
   The Star came down in the middle: ``2 Million Pound Kiss-Off to
End Royal Marriage.''
   At the Daily Mail, Anne was blamed for the separation with
headlines saying ``Anne Wanted Her Freedom,'' and ``Mark Hoped They
Would Stay Together But the Princess Decided to End the Sham
Marriage.'' It quoted Phillips' father as saying the decision had
not been mutual and his son would have been happy to continue the
marriage.
   ``When they married, everybody expected that Mark was going to be
hanging on her coattails,'' it quoted Maj. Peter Phillips as saying.
``Right from the word go he said he was going to do his thing and
she hers. He would not want to be a hanger-on. That is not his way
of life, I'm pleased to say.''

<BYLINE>EDS: INSERTS five grafs after 5th pvs, Having watched ..., to give
reaction from Vincennes skipper, description of magazine. ^By BRYNA BRENNAN</BYLINE>
<UNK>Associated Press Writer</UNK>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A naval commander who had observed the USS
Vincennes in the Persian Gulf said the ship had ``no good reason''
for shooting down an Iranian civilian airliner, killing all 290
aboard.
   The unusually candid article by Cmdr. David R. Carlson in the
U.S. Naval Institute Proceedings magazine this month said others had
remarked on the agressive behavior of the Vincennes, which had been
dubbed ``robo cruiser.''
   Carlson, commander of the USS Sides, a frigate that was on the
scene when the USS Vincennes shot down the Airbus on July 3, 1988,
clearly put the blame on actions taken by the ship and disputed any
notion of self-defense.
   ``No profit has come from the pathetic postincident attempts to
place the blame on the victims,'' he wrote. ``View it as you will,
Iran Air Flight 655 was shot down for no good reason.
   ``Having watched the performance of the Vincennes for a month
before the incident, my impression was clearly that an atmosphere of
restraint was not her long suit. Her actions appeared to be
consistently aggressive, and had become a topic of wardroom
conversation.''
   Capt. Will Rogers, skipper of the Vincennes at the time, said
Carlson's assessment was subjective and not in line with the Navy's
conclusions.
   ``The Navy investigated the events of July 3, 1988, in
excruciating detail and published its findings in the Fogarty
Report,'' Rogers said in a statement issued by the Navy in San
Diego, where he is stationed.
   ``Commander Carlson's comments in the magazine article are his
personal opinions of the Airbus incident,'' he said. ``I fully stand
behind the Navy report and the performance of my crew.''
   Navy spokesman David L. Dillon in San Diego said that the
magazine is not part of the Navy.
   ``It's published by the Naval Institute, a private self-supported
non-profit professional society and it's a forum for people to
express personal opinions and assertions in various articles related
to Navy issues, but the Naval Institute is not part of the U.S.
government, so his comments are his own personal opinion,'' he said.
   Carlson suggests the crew of the Vincennes wanted to prove the
capability of the ship's Aegis missile-defense system in the Persian
Gulf.
   On the day of the incident, Carlson said, a crewman informed him
that the Vincennes had classified the plane as an Iranian F-14
fighter.
   ``I was also prepared to deal with an air threat, but in all
honesty did not perceive one,'' Carlson said.
   According to Carlson, the event started with the Vincennes'
helicopter drawing fire from Iranian speedboats, which he claims
were only warning shots.
   ``The Vincennes saw an opportunity for action, and pressed hard
for Commander Middle East Force to give permission to fire,''
Carlson said.
   ``The tragedy was avoidable, and we must learn from it,'' he said.
   ``A review of the facts is in order,'' Carlson wrote. ``When the
decision was made to shoot down the Airbus, the airliner was
climbing, not diving; it was showing the proper identification
friend or foe ... The Vincennes was never under attack by Iranian
aircraft.''
   A naval investigator told Congress last September that a series
of errors caused by stress, including misinterpreting electronic
data, caused the mistaken attack on the airliner.
   Rear Adm. William M. Fogarty, who headed the Navy's investigating
team, said the captain of the Vincennes, Will Rogers III, ordered
the ship's missiles fired in the mistaken belief the airliner was an
Iranian F-14 fighter plane.
   Carlson, in his article, puts some of the blame on himself.
   ``I wondered aloud in disbelief, but I did not do the one thing
that might have helped,'' he wrote. ``I did not push for a
reevaluation.
   ``Had I done so, the information might have come forward quickly
enough to allow me to attempt to dissuade the Vincennes from
shooting.''

<TEXT>
   Col. Moammar Gadhafi celebrated 20 years in
power by pledging support Friday for ``freedom fighters'' in Panama
and elsewhere and declaring that Ronald Reagan had been consigned to
``the dustbin of history.''
   He proclaimed Libya's solidarity with ``the people of Panama in
confronting American imperialism.''
   Gadhafi was an obscure, 27-year-old army signals corps officer
when he led a coup Sept. 1, 1969, while King Idris was abroad.
   On the anniversary of the coup he addressed a special session of
Libya's parliament that also was attended by at least 19 heads of
state.
   Friday's festivities included an air show and a nighttime
military parade through Tripoli's central Green Square, which was
adorned with lights, balloons, Libya's green flags and portraits of
Gadhafi.
   Gadhafi, in olive fatigues, watched from a platform as soldiers
from Libya and other African and Middle East countries marched by.
   Other marching groups included foreign civilians. One group,
identified by Libyan officials as members of European Greens
environmental organizations, wore T-shirts and baseball caps adorned
with pictures of Gadhafi.
   Gadhafi did not speak during the parade, which lasted two hours
and 15 minutes.
   When Gadhafi went to address the General People's Congress
earlier, he was greeted by delegates and guests shouting ``One Arab
people!''
   ``I stand with you in the trenches,'' said the Libyan leader,
clad in white slacks, a gray sports jacket, maroon shirt and a white
cape trimmed in gold.
   Gadhafi took aim at former President Reagan.
   ``The empires of colonialization are now in the dustbins of
history. The conquerors who believed that they made themselves
divine on this planet ... Alexander the Macedonian, Hitler,
Mussolini and Reagan, are in the dustbin of history,'' he said,
according to an official translation.
   Libya will offer ``supplies and support'' to revolutionary
movements around the world, he said, and declared:
   ``We delightedly announce here to all freedom fighters in
Nicaragua, Panama, New Caledonia, Reunion, Mayotte, South Africa,
Namibia, Palestine, Caledonia, French Guyana and in Central America;
we happily announce to them that your ally is becoming stronger and
will not abandon you. We will be victorious.''
   ``The Libyan revolution ... has entered the Pacific Ocean,'' he
said, ``inciting peoples to seek freedom, supporting the small
peoples whose islands France has turned into a scene for nuclear
tests.''
   Singling out Panama, Gadhafi said the United States demanded that
he withdraw support for Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega as a condition
for resumption of U.S.-Libyan dialogue.
   ``Libya is present in Panama, the Sept. 1 revolution is present
in Panama,'' he said. ``We say this: We will not withdraw our
position, which fully and absolutely supports the cause of the
people of Panama in confronting American imperialism.''
   He said the United States also wants Libya to recognize Israel,
but ``there is no question of recognizing Israel. The Zionist entity
is a strange entity left over from World War II that must be
removed. ... Palestine is for the Palestinians.''
   President Daniel Ortega of Nicaragua spoke briefly, recalling
conflicts both countries had with the United States.
   ``In difficult moments, he was always close,'' Ortega said of
Gadhafi, according to an unofficial translation of his remarks in
Spanish. ``We both had difficult moments. I owe him so much.''
   Hafez Assad, president of Syria, and chairman Yasser Arafat of
the Palestine Liberation Organization, who have been at odds for
years, chatted before the parliament session began.
   Other leaders attending included Omar Hassan Ahmed el-Bashir, the
military ruler of Sudan; President Chadli Bendjedid of Algeria, and
Zine El Abidine Ben Ali, president of Tunisia.
   There were reports that a summit was possible of five countries
trying to form a North African economic union, but a Western
diplomat said disagreements has arisen over finances. The nations
are Algeria, Libya, Mauritania, Morocco and Tunisia.
   On the eve of the anniversary, Gadhafi acted to bury the hatchet
with Chad, Libya's southern neighbor and adversary in a 16-year war.
The two countries signed an accord Thursday in Algiers declaring a
formal end to over the mineral-rich Aouzou border strip.
   Western European diplomats estimated Gadhafi spent hundreds of
millions of dollars preparing Tripoli for the festivities.
   In the past year, Gadhafi has loosened restrictions on Libyan
commerce and tried to mend fences with Arab neighbors and reduce
tensions with the West.
   A Western diplomat said the Libyan leader even invited President
Bush and Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher of Britain. The
highest-ranking Western visitor was Gianni De Michelis, Italy's
foreign minister. Libya was once a colony of Italy.
   U.S. relations with Libya have been sour for years. Reagan
ordered the bombing of Tripoli and Benghazi in April 1986 because of
Gadhafi's alleged support for international terrorism.

   The genetically altered virus released in a
cabbage patch three weeks ago in the first test of its kind has been
killing off the pest it's supposed to fight and then dying off right
on schedule, scientists said.
   The virus killed off all the cabbage looper insects that it was
supposed to as part of the controlled experiment, said H. Alan Wood,
a virologist at the Boyce Thompson Institute for Plant Research.
   The institute is conducting the tests at Cornell University's
Agricultural Experiment Station in Geneva and sprayed the field for
a second time on Thursday.
   ``It's very gratifying,'' Wood said. ``Our application technology
was perfect. Everything was working just the way we predicted it
would.''
   The Aug. 9 spraying made history as the first field release of a
genetically altered virus in the United States. The experiment was
heralded as a milestone in the development of non-chemical methods
of pest control.
   The virus was genetically altered in the laboratory to be
short-lived so that it would pose no threat of uncontrolled
spreading.
   Samples that were taken one and two weeks after the first
spraying show that the altered virus disappeared entirely from the
900 cabbage plants where it was applied within, according to Wood.
   But the virus that was ingested by the insects, as well as
whatever small amounts were absorbed into the soil, will persist in
decreasing amounts for another two years or so, he said.
   Thursday's spraying was the second in a series of three scheduled
for late this summer. Another 900 plants, out of a total of 2,700 in
the test plot, were sprayed.
   The Boyce Thompson Institute will monitor the field for two to
three years to see how long the virus lives in the natural
environment and to check for any movement of the virus, according to
an agreement with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency.

   A teen-ager alleged to have shot dead a black
youth in a white neighborhood pleaded innocent to a murder charge
Friday and was ordered held without bail.
   Joseph Fama, 18, was placed in protective custody at his lawyer's
request after a hearing in Brooklyn Criminal Court, said Correction
Department spokesman Tom Antenen.
   In other developments Friday, a second suspect in the racially
charged case indicated he was ready to cooperate with a grand jury
probe, and tensions erupted into violence outside a courtroom.
   Prosecutors said Fama was a leader of the gang of whites who
chased four black teen-agers with baseball bats, golf clubs and at
least one gun on the night of Aug. 23. One of the blacks,
16-year-old Yusuf Hawkins, was shot in the chest and died.
   The murder of Hawkins has touched off a series of protests and
marches against racism, some of them met by counter-protests by
residents of the mostly Italian-American neighborhood of Bensonhurst
where the killing occurred.
   Fama fled after the shooting and remained a fugitive until early
Thursday when he surrendered to police in upstate Oneonta. He was
returned to the city, and witnesses identified him in a lineup, said
Assistant District Attorney Paul Burns.
   Hours after his return, an estimated 7,500 protesters clashed
with police during a ``Day of Outrage'' march against racism through
Brooklyn. Twenty-three officers were injured in the brawl.
   ``I'm sure some of them came there because they had all good
intentions, but others clearly came with bricks and bottles bent on
violence,'' Mayor Edward I. Koch said.
   In court, Fama attorney David A. DePetris entered an innocent
plea for his client and challenged Burns on what the lineups
produced.
   ``A number of individuals who viewed Mr. Fama did not identify
him in any way, shape or form,'' the lawyer said. ``There is
substantial dispute as to what actually occurred at the lineups.''
   Fama said nothing during the arraignment.
   He is charged with two counts of second-degree murder, assault,
criminal possession of a weapon, menacing, riot and aggravated
harassment.
   Brooklyn District Attorney Elizabeth Holtzman said later her
office and the police were looking for others who many have
participated in the attack.
   Also on Friday, another suspect, 19-year-old Joseph Serrano,
appeared before Criminal Court Judge Seymour Gerschwer and indicated
he wanted to cooperate with the grand jury investigating the
incident. His lawyer, Joseph DeCandia, would not elaborate and said
he was leaving the case.
   Serrano, who has not been indicted, remains free on $75,000 bail.
   In addition to Serrano, five other Bensonhurst youths have been
arrested in the attack. Two of them _ Keith Mondello, 19, and
Pasquale Raucci, 18 _ have been indicted on murder charges.
   At their arraignment in a jammed courtroom at Brooklyn state
Supreme Court, both pleaded innocent and Justice John J. DeLury
refused prosecutors' request that bail be revoked and allowed
Mondello to remain free on $100,000 bail and Raucci on $75,000.
   The ruling shocked and outraged Hawkins' family and their
supporters.
   ``Oh my God,'' said the victim's father, Freddy Stewart.
   A tense confrontation followed a few moments later with the Rev.
Al Sharpton, an adviser to the Hawkins family, shouting threats at
Mondello's lawyer Stephen Murphy and calling him a murderer.
   A few minutes later, outside the courthouse, a Sharpton supporter
attacked a WNYW-TV camera crew that refused to stop filming Hawkins'
family.
   ``I was kicked in the arm, punched and pushed,'' said Barbara
Lloyd, a technician.
   Ms. Lloyd and cameraman Nick Jutchenko, who also said he was
punched, said they would file a complaint against the attacker.
   New York Newsday photographer Lilliana Nieto was also attacked by
the group. She said that while she was taking photographs of Ms.
Lloyd being attacked, Sharpton yelled ``Get her'' and someone
smacked her in the face and head.

   Nearly a half century ago, a young Army
airman left his wife and family in Wichita to fight World War II
over the skies of the Pacific Ocean.
   On Friday, 1st Lt. Robert Schwensen was finally laid to rest
here, a year after his remains were discovered by Australian gold
miners atop a mountain in a dense jungle of New Guinea.
   Schwensen and four other men aboard a C-47 had been listed as
missing in action since their aircraft was shot down by Japanese
fighter planes in February 1943.
   Schwensen was buried under overcast skies with an honor guard and
a 21-gun salute at Fort Leavenworth's National Cemetery, close to
the grave of his oldest brother, Capt. Justus Schwensen, who died in
a bomb run over Hamburg, Germany, in 1945. Another brother, 1st Lt.
Richard Schwensen, was killed by small arms fire at Remagen,
Germany, less than a month before Capt. Schwensen's death.
   ``At last, he's going to finally be home where he belongs,'' June
Rockhill, the woman Robert Schwensen left behind in the fall of
1942, said in an earlier interview. She was 18 at the time and
married just three months.
   After coming to terms with her husband's disappearance and
apparent death, she married Kenneth Rockhill of Eureka in 1947.
   ``This has been very trying for me and my husband. It brings back
a lot of memories,'' she said. ``But my husband's been wonderful
through the whole thing.''
   Mr. and Mrs. Rockhill and Schwensen's two surviving brothers _
E.W. ``Swede'' Schwensen of Del Mar, Calif., and Dr. John Schwensen
of Mansfield, Texas _ were among the hushed audience of about 100 at
the rites.
   `I thought the ceremony was lovely,'' said Mrs. Rockhill, who
cried during the service. ``There have been so many memories over
the years, and this sort of finalizes everything.''
   A C-47, an olive-colored World War II transport, circled the
cemetery before the ceremony. Later, three fighter jets flew over
the cemetery, covered with rows and rows of small white grave
markers.
   Chaplain Col. James H. McKinney officiated at the service and
said, ``The jungle of New Guinea has given us back those remains so
we can bury a ghost.''
   Brother Swede Schwensen described his brother as ``just a tough
kid.''
   ``We're glad that it's all put to rest now. We can pay our final
respects,'' he said after the ceremony.
   He walked a few steps to the grave of Richard Schwensen after the
ceremony and prayed.
   John Schwensen, who is a minister, gave the eulogy. In an
interview after the ceremony, he said of his dead brother: ``He was
in New Guinea and now he is at rest in our own minds here. It does
give us some consolation. My only wish is that my parents were
here.''
   He said he was just 12 years old when he learned that his brother
was missing in action. ``At first, I didn't understand it, but then
I realized that life has death in it,'' he said.
   Air Force officials in Washington said it is rare to find the
remains of missing servicemen so long after World War II.
   They said identifying Robert Schwensen's remains was difficult
because the Air Force no longer had records of his relatives. Both
his parents had died.
   Swede Schwensen contacted the Casualty Memorial Affairs Office in
Alexandria, Va., and made the arrangements for his brother's remains
to be flown to Kansas for burial at Fort Leavenworth.

<HEAD>Washington Mayor Complains to Thornburgh About Leaks</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Mayor Marion Barry asked Friday to meet with
Attorney General Dick Thornburgh over press reports that federal
investigators have been told the mayor smoked crack on several
occasions.
   In a letter to Thornburgh, Barry said disclosures concerning the
Justice Department's investigation into his links with convicted
drug dealer Charles Lewis have damaged his ability to govern the
city.
   He said he hoped Thornburgh would follow U.S. Attorney Jay B.
Stephens' request for a full investigation into the disclosures..
   ``This is an issue bigger than Marion Barry Jr. and the politics
of the District of Columbia,'' Barry said in the letter. ``It is
about the fundamental principles upon which our system of laws is
based.''
   David Runkel, the Justice Department's chief spokesman, refused
Friday to comment directly on the mayor's request, but indicated
that an inquiry is standard in such cases.
   ``You can assume whenever there is an unauthorized disclosure of
information, there will be an investigation,'' Runkel said.
   Earlier this year, Thornburgh ordered an investigation into leaks
that Rep. Bill Gray, D-Pa., was being questioned by federal
investigators.
   Gray, then in a campaign for the Democratic whip's post in the
House that he went on to win, also had complained to Thornburgh
about leaks from the Justice Department.
   The Justice Department responded by declaring that Gray was not
the target of an investigation and Thornburgh went as far as saying
he was willing to subpoena reporters' telephone records in order to
find the source of the leaks.
   U.S. Attorney Jay B. Stephens declined Friday to comment on
whether Lewis has implicated Barry in interrogations by federal
agents. But Stephens said he wants the Justice Department to
investigate whether stories about Lewis' cooperation originated with
law enforcement officials.
   In his letter to Thornburgh, Barry said everyone involved in the
investigation of his contacts with Lewis is a Justice Department
employee.
   ``There seems to be one or more persons who, with impunity, are
systematically leaking information that is part of an on-going
investigation,'' Barry's letter said. ``The reality of all of this
is that once published, unsubstantiated allegations take on a life
of their own and are repeated as fact.''
   Quoting unnamed sources, The Washington Post has reported that
Lewis identified to federal investigators four women in the Virgin
Island who he claims can back up his allegations that Barry used
crack and other drugs there.
   At least one woman has given investigators a statement backing
Lewis' account that Barry smoked crack on one occasion, the Post
quoted the sources as saying.
   WUSA-TV earlier quoted sources as saying that Lewis has told
investigators he smoked crack with the mayor in Lewis' hotel room in
December.
   Another station and newspaper, WRC-TV and The Washington Times,
have carried stories in the past two days saying federal
investigators believe they have enough evidence to seek an
indictment of Barry on perjury and obstruction of justice charges.
   Lewis has been charged with perjury and cocaine possession and
trafficking in connection with a federal probe that began last
December after city police inexplicably called off an attempt to
make an undercover drug buy from Lewis when they learned Barry was
in Lewis' hotel room.
   For the past several years, Barry has been dogged by rumors that
he uses drugs. On Thursday, he repeated his claim that he never saw
or used drugs during at least six visits to Lewis' room.
   Barry had been scheduled to appear Friday with the city's new
drug czar, Sterling Tucker, but the news conference was canceled
Thursday. About two hours before the news conference, city officials
also canceled Tucker's appearance.

<HEAD>Former Cuban Interior Minister Given 20 Years in Prison</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MEXICO CITY (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Jose Abrantes, a former interior minister of
Cuba, was sentenced to 20 years in prison for abuse of office and
other charges related to the drug trafficking scandal in Fidel
Castro's government.
   Prensa Latina, the Cuban government's news agency, said Friday
the same military court that orderd the prison term for Abrantes
sentenced six other officials to terms of up to 12 years. The
dispatch, monitored in Mexico City, said the Communist Party
newspaper Granma reported the sentences.
   Abrantes, who was fired in June for failing to detect drug
trafficking in his ministry, was convicted of abuse of office,
improper use of financial resources and property, and negligence in
service, according to the report.
   The Communist Party's Central Committee expelled Abrantes and
Pascual Martinez, a former vice minister of the interior, from the
party and Abrantes lost his post as a deputy in the Mariano
municipal assembly, the dispatch said.
   The court reported that lieutenant colonels Manuel Gil and
Rolando Castaneda were demoted to private and army authorities would
be asked to take similar steps against Abrantes and Martinez, who
are both division generals, and Brig. Gen. Roberto Gonzalez, Prensa
Latina said.
   It said the Council of State would be asked to cancel honorary
titles and decorations held by the defendants and advise government
agencies of any illegal transfers of property that were revealed.
   Martinez was sentenced to 12 years in prison; Gonzalez to 10
years; Lt. Col. Oscar Carreno to seven years; Castaneda, six years;
Gil, five years, and civilian Hector Carbonell, eight years, on
various charges.
   President Castro personally ordered Abrantes to investigate
reports that Cuba was a transit point for tons of Colombian cocaine
en route to the United States, Prensa Latina reported during the
trial.
   During the four-day trial that ended Sunday, prosecutors said
Abrantes' mistakes were so bad in handling the narcotics
investigation they appeared to have been deliberate, but not enough
evidence existed to accuse him of treason, according to Prensa
Latina.
   It reported the prosecutors said Abrantes knew in February that
officials in his ministry were involved in drug trafficking but took
no action.
   Four military officers were executed in July for their roles in
the trafficking and 10 others drew sentences of up to 30 years.

<HEAD>Bush Praises Contribution to Ethics, Education</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   KENNEBUNKPORT, Maine _ President Bush paid tribute Friday evening
to A. Bartlett Giamatti, saying the late baseball commissioner stood
``for the highest possible ethical standards.''
   ``Bart was a close friend of mine for many, many years,'' Bush
said. ``I just want to pay my respects. He was a great person.
   ``He loved the game of baseball and in a short time made a real
contribution to the game, standing for the highest possible ethical
standards.''
   Both men had graduated from Yale, where Bush was captain of the
1948 baseball team and Giamatti became president before becoming
baseball commissioner.
   Bush added Giamatti's ``contribution to higher education in this
country is well known, and on top of all that, he was a thoroughly
decent human being.''
   Bush's son George recently became part owner of the Texas
Rangers, and the president and Giamatti attended several major
league baseball games together this season, including the Rangers at
Baltimore.
   Speaking of Giamatti's decision to ban Pete Rose from baseball
for life for gambling, Bush said: ``That was not an easy matter for
him. I had not commented on it, but I have talked to him at great
length about it.''
   Bush said he had tried to get in touch with Giamatti recently to
talk about the Rose case and ``just missed'' the return call a few
days ago.
   ``All through that I was thinking of the difficultly that he had
in setting these standards that high and staying with it,'' said
Bush.

   An arsonist poured gasoline on the porch of a
crowded foster home and set off a fire that killed four children and
injured 12 other people, six of them critically, investigators said.
   Five other children and six adults living at the house were
injured in the fire early Thursday in north Philadelphia. A
firefighter was also injured.
   The blaze occurred two days after firefighters put out a fire of
undetermined origin at the house, said fire Lt. Jack Christmas.
Authorities had no suspects in either fire.
   Six of the injured remained in critical condition Friday, one was
in fair condition and three were stable following Thursday's blaze
at four area hospitals, officials said. Two people, including the
firefighter, were treated and released.
   Survivors, neighbors and the first firefighters and police on the
scene and were being interviewed, Capt. Lawton Connelly said Friday.
   ``I was real scared,'' said resident Latasha Rogers, 18, who
escaped through a window with her 2-year-old son and two other
children.
   The door of her second-floor bedroom was already on fire when she
awoke. ``It still hasn't hit me,'' she said. ``I still didn't get
over that the four had died. We were all so close.''
   Eighteen people lived in the three-story house. Connelly said he
did not know if police had talked to the other resident, a
23-year-old woman.
   Connelly said it had been confirmed that gasoline was the source
of Thursday's blaze.
   ``The fire marshal informs us that we have four points of origin,
two on the front porch, one inside the door and one at the base of
the steps inside,'' said Connelly, commander of the homicide
division.
   Hubert and Rose Artis had run the home since 1972. Both were
among the injured.
   Mrs. Artis was in critical condition at Albert Einstein Medical
Center along with three other residents, ages 20, 15 and 3, a
hospital official said. A 12-year-old was listed as critical at St.
Christopher's Hospital for Children and a 17-year-old was critical
at St. Agnes Medical Center, officials said. Artis was in stable
condition.
   City Licenses and Inspections Commissioner Donald Kligerman said
the Artises did not have a zoning variance for the single-family
area or licenses authorizing them to run a rooming house, to engage
in food preparation or to operate a business.
   However, Dick Olanoff, spokesman for the city Department of Human
Services, said foster homes are considered private homes and do not
need such licenses.
   The Artises ``have been outstanding foster parents, as evidenced
by the fact that two former foster children elected to stay there
after they turned 18,'' Olanoff said.
   The dead children were identified by the city Medical Examiner's
Office as Keith Moye, 7, and his brother, Preston Moye, 5; Anwan
Hartwell, 9; and Robert Lavenhouse, 14. All were trapped in a
second-floor bedroom.
   The injured ranged in age from 2 to 65.

<TEXT>
   A judge on Friday blamed the crew of a
Delta Air Lines jet for a 1985 crash that killed 137 people, even
though air traffic controllers had failed to warn the crew of severe
weather.
   In a 72-page opinion, U.S. District Judge David O. Belew Jr. said
Delta had failed to prove that the National Weather Service and
controllers at the Dallas-Fort Worth International Airport were
negligent.
   In the longest major aviation trial in U.S. history, attorneys
for Delta had argued that the weather was to blame for the crash
because crew members didn't have sufficient warning about the
severity of a thunderstorm at the airport.
   The airline had sought to make the government pay all or part of
the millions of dollars in claims arising from the crash.
   The Atlanta-based airline said it would appeal the decision,
saying it was ``in direct conflict with the recent jury verdict ...
in Fort Lauderdale holding Delta blameless in all respects for the
accident.''
   Delta ``continues to believe that the facts surrounding this case
clearly establish total government responsibility for the tragic
accident.''
   In Washington, Joe Friday, assistant administrator for weather
services at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration,
said: ``We are continuing to work with the FAA (Federal Aviation
Administration) and the aviation industry to improve our science and
technology so that this kind of tragedy will not be repeated.''
   The Lockheed L-1011, en route from Fort Lauderdale, Fla., to
Dallas, crashed trying to land at DFW on Aug. 2, 1985, when it was
caught in a downburst of wind during a thunderstorm. The accident
killed 137; 27 people on board survived.
   Windle Turley, a Dallas attorney representing a dozen victims of
the crash, said he was pleased with the ruling. ``We're very happy.
We felt from the beginning that Delta was the only negligent party
in this case,'' he said.
   Belew said the crew of Delta Flight 191 knew, or should have
known, that there was severe weather on the approach to the airport,
and that the thunderstorms were likely to cause dangerous wind
shear, an abrupt change in wind direction and force.
   A National Transportation Safety Board investigation had blamed
wind shear for the crash.
   In his ruling, the judge said that ``attempting to land the
aircraft in a thunderstorm constituted negligence on the part of the
crew of DL191, and proximately caused the crash.''
   The government, however, did not escape criticism.
   Belew said DFW tower personnel should have taken steps to be sure
that incoming pilots were aware of the weather's severity, and that
a meteorologist should have been sure that the weather was being
monitored continuously while he took a long dinner break.
   But Belew cited other cases in which a controller's failure to
warn pilots of bad weather was not considered negligent when the
pilot already was aware of conditions.
   He said the failure of air traffic controllers to route the plane
to another runway was not negligent, particularly because the pilots
did not request a new runway.
   Yet ``the court considers the failure of governmental employees
to pass on weather information to have been inconsequential to the
fate of (Flight) 191 in that there is no evidence that the crew
would have acted differently with this confirmation of information
already known.''
   The trial began in March 1988 and lasted almost 14 months,
although it recessed several times so Belew could clear backlogged
criminal cases.
   The government argued that the flight crew didn't heed FAA tower
warnings, didn't ask for weather information and decided to fly into
the storm. The government also says the jet's radar should have
warned the pilots of weather conditions.
   The flight crew was killed in the crash.
   Delta has paid at least $66 million in death, injury and damage
claims from the Flight 191 crash, but in those cases, survivors
waived the issue of liability.
   In the only previous case that considered liability, a U.S.
District Court jury in Fort Lauderdale determined that Delta was
blameless in the crash.
   Delta attorney John Martin, during final arguments in the Fort
Worth case after testimony ended in April, said the pilots did not
know about the ``nightmarish wind shear.''
   ``The pilots of 191 were certainly not aware of impending doom,''
he said.
   Wind shear is considered particularly dangerous at low altitudes
and when pilots are taking off and landing. Such a downburst of air
can cause a plane to lose altitude quickly.
   The judge said Delta's overall training program for pilots in
wind-shear situations was ``lax,'' but not negligent.
   Belew ruled out the possibility that tranquilizers Capt. Edward
M. Connors might have been taking at the time of the accident
contributed to the crash, saying the evidence was too speculative.
Government attorneys had argued that Connors' use of Valium and
Stelazine might have impaired his ability to properly respond to the
situation.

   The U.S. government will go after the
personal assets of Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega and his friends and
companies he controls in stepping up its drive against the
Panamanian leader, U.S. officials said Friday.
   They said Washington is compiling a list of companies and
individuals associated with Noriega to block their assets and affect
them financially by keeping them from doing any kind of business
with U.S. individuals, agencies or companies.
   ``We are going after Noriega's cronies and firms he is identified
with,'' one U.S. Embassy official told The Associated Press,
speaking on condition of anonymity.
   Officials said the list will be made public within days and would
include dozens of firms.
   In its efforts to force the ouster of Noriega, whom it accuses of
drug trafficking, the U.S. government imposed economic sanctions on
Panama last year. The measures include withholding tax payments,
freezing Panamanian government assets in the United States and
refusing to pay Panama Canal tolls.
   The total amount retained by the U.S. government is estimated at
close to $300 million.
   But the sanctions have failed to budge the general, who as
commander of the Panamanian Defense Forces is the most powerful
individual in the country. The Defense Forces include both the
military and the police.
   Opposition leaders have said the U.S. sanctions affect low-income
groups by aggravating the economic crisis.
   The U.S. Embassy official said the new strategy was more
selective and avoided measures that hurt the Panamanian population.
   On Friday, Michael Kozak, deputy undersecretary of state for
Latin American affairs, said in Washington that the United States
intended to ``put pressure on firms and friends of the regime
without damaging the economy.''
   President Bush said the United States will not recognize
Francisco Rodriguez, the provisional president named by the
Panamanian government, because his appointment was the work of
Noriega.
   The U.S. Embassy source said, ``We can make it illegal for any
U.S. firm and individual to deal with any Panamanian company owned
by an associate of Noriega or by Noriega directly or indirectly.''
   This could mean a loss of millions of dollars by Panamanian
companies that do business with U.S. government agencies like the
military Southern Command and the Panama Canal Commission.
   The Southern Command's installations are home to nearly 14,000
U.S. military personnel and it spends millions of dollars on food
and other items. The Panama Canal Commission has nearly 8,000
employees, which also means millions of dollars in maintenance and
contracts and purchase of parts locally.
   The U.S. official said one company already targeted by the U.S.
government is an export-import company in the Colon free zone that
at one time was run by Carlos Duque, former presidential candidate
of the government coalition.

   U.S. military advisers may be sent to
help Colombia in its war against drug barons, but this country's
defense chief said Friday foreign troops are not needed ``to solve
our domestic problems.''
   ``We can face this challenge alone,'' Defense Minister Gen. Oscar
Botero told a news conference.
   Late Friday, both the U.S. Embassy and the Defense Ministry
denied there were any U.S. military advisers in Colombia.
   The Pentagon said Thursday up to 200 American military personnel
could wind up in Colombia for tasks ranging from unloading to
training.
   A U.S. narcotics official said drug traffickers wanted in the
United States have managed to avoid a government crackdown and
remain in Colombia because of corruption among Colombian authorities.
   Authorities in Medellin, home of the most powerful cocaine
cartel, said police defused a 40-pound bomb that was left at a bank
Friday by terror squads working for drug lords.
   It was the latest development in a series of assassinations,
bombings and arson by the drug cartels in the past two weeks. Drug
lords are trying to force the government to reverse its decision to
begin extraditing suspects wanted by the United States.
   The U.S. Justice Department seeks extraditions of 12 Colombians
believed to be key figures in cartels that supply most of the
cocaine sold in the United States.
   Botero said the Colombian army was capable of handling the $65
million worth of equipment being sent by the United States without
the aid of 200 advisers, but did not rule out requesting technical
help in ``specific fields.''
   He said the best aid the United States and other wealthy nations
could give would be reducing drug use among their populations.
   The general said 2,004 properties had been searched, 550 estates
seized, 1,061 weapons found and 1,356 cars, 33 yachts, 142
motorcycles and 349 aircraft confiscated.
   Colombia began its toughest crackdown on drug dealing after the
leading presidential candidate, Sen. Luis Carlos Galan, was
assassinated Aug. 18 during a speech at a campaign rally. Drug lords
responded to the crackdown with threats to kill more officials.
   U.S. authorities said they believe corruption is slowing the
crackdown and that drug chieftains remain in Colombia, protected by
some officials, despite speculation that narcotics overlords may
have fled the country.
   ``I feel confident most of these people are in Colombia,'' the
U.S. narcotics official said of traffickers sought by the United
States.
   Traffickers eluding arrest ``don't feel a threat. They might even
feel protected,'' he said.
   ``Infiltration is a very serious factor,'' the official said of
attempts by the traffickers to bribe Colombian government officials
and members of government security forces.
   The official said drug cartels may have people stationed in small
towns watching only for military or police movement. Army colonels
can make up to $15,000 monthly working for drug dealers.
   The narcotics official spoke with reporters on the condition that
his name or title not be disclosed.
   The meeting with journalists was initiated by the U.S. Embassy,
perhaps indicating concern among U.S. officials that Colombia's drug
fight may be waning.
   Embassy officials said they had no information about U.S.
advisers coming to Colombia to aid Colombian security forces in
using $65 million pledged by President Bush.
   Barco said Thursday the $65 million Bush offered for Colombia's
war on drugs was important but that the real solution is ``to put
the brakes on the demand.''
   In drug raids, the Colombian army has found records in drug
traffickers' hideouts showing telephone calls to army bases and
police stations. Arms caches have included police guns and equipment
and scores of police uniforms, apparently used as disguises.
   The army and national police, which are part of the Defense
Ministry, have ousted about a dozen officers for drug trafficking or
being on traffickers' payrolls.
   The U.S. narcotics official said he did not know how high up in
the government the corruption goes.
   ``If the Colombian people do not win this battle, I pity what
will happen to this country,'' the official said.
   Asked if he thought the battle would get more intense, he said,
``There is no doubt in my mind there will be a great deal of
bloodshed.''
   He said the traffickers will kill their adversaries one by one if
they defeat the current crackdown. Even President Virgilio Barco
could be assassinated, he said.
   Barco said Thursday on Colombia was ``doing its duty'' in the
anti-drug fight and called on developed countries to stop cocaine
use.
   The U.S. official said the Colombian Supreme Court will determine
much of the success or failure of the crackdown.
   The Supreme Court eventually will rule on the constitutionality
of Barco's decree to extradite Colombians to the United States under
a state of seige that exists.
   In the last year the court has declared unconstitutional five of
10 Barco decrees aimed at controlling guerrilla violence and at
thwarting drug traffickers.

<TEXT>
   A 9-year-old Bangladeshi girl molested by
the man who brought her to the United States was ordered returned
Friday to her foster home, which state officials previously had said
wasn't ``culturally relevant.''
   Grays Harbor County Superior Court Judge Michael Spencer
overturned a court commissioner's ruling that let state Child
Protective Services take the child, known as Kushi, from her Hoquiam
home on the central Washington coast and place her with her sister
in nearby Lacey.
   Kushi, a Moslem, was brought to the United States along with
several other family members by Stefan Christopher, a former United
Nations consultant who had the family live and work on his farm.
   Christopher, 52, married one of Kushi's older sisters, divorced
her and then married Kushi's 12-year-old sister.
   On Sept. 11, he faces sentencing for guilty pleas to taking
indecent liberties with the girl and two other children. Sheriff's
department officials say Christopher ``physically and
psychologically tortured'' the family.
   The Superior Court commissioner had decided after a closed
hearing that the foster home didn't offer a ``culturally relevant''
upbringing as required by the state. Neither foster parent is Moslem.
   More than 200 people marched on the state capitol Monday to
demand the girl be returned to foster parents Bob Martin, a chemical
engineer, and Betsy Seidel, a middle school English and geography
teacher.
   ``I'm happy for now,'' said Seidel. ``I realize it's just
temporary but I'm thrilled. Kushi is coming back into our home.
That's where she belongs.''
   Details of Spencer's closed-door hearing were confirmed by state
officials and by Tom Copland, the child's court-appointed guardian.
   Copland sought the court hearing after being barred from the
earlier closed hearing that resulted in Kushi's removal from the
Martin-Seidel home. The girl will be returned there this weekend.
   ``Judge Spencer simply ruled that, under the facts of this case,
the Superior Court had the authority to require a (full court)
hearing prior to Kushi's removal from the foster home,'' said
Copland, an Aberdeen attorney.
   ``It was nothing more than a procedural ruling on an issue of law
and had nothing to do with the merits of the case or the actions or
motives of any party.''
   Howard Shuman, spokesman for the state Department of Social and
Health Services, said officials would continue trying to contact
Kushi's parents in Bangladesh to learn where they would prefer she
stay.
   Kushi currently is living with a sister who declined to comment
when contacted by The Associated Press. But Seidel said Kushi was
excited about the prospects of returning to their home.
   ``She called us collect last night and said she wanted to go to
school. She didn't understand why she couldn't,'' Seidel said.

<DATELINE>PANAMA CITY, Panama (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A provisional government loyal to Gen.
Manuel Antonio Noriega took office Friday, and the United States
refused to recognize it, vowing to impose more economic sanctions.
   Noriega did not attend the brief ceremony at which his
schoolmate, Francisco Rodriguez, was sworn in as Panama's sixth
president in six years.
   Later, in a televised speech Friday night, Rodriguez appealed to
the United States to end its confrontation with Panama.
   President Bush said in Washington earlier Friday that he would
tighten sanctions ``to deprive the illegal regime of funds that
belong to the Panamanian people.''
   ``I am confident that other governments which support human
rights, democracy and self-determination and which oppose drug
trafficking will take similar measures,'' he said.
   U.S. officials in Panama said the tighter sanctions would try to
keep Noriega and his associates from doing business with U.S.
companies.
   Noriega is under indictment for drug trafficking in the United
States, which says he is a key connection for Colombia's cocaine
cartels.
   ``The fact that Gen. Noriega handpicked another president doesn't
change the political situation of the country,'' opposition leader
Guillermo Endara said through a spokesman.
   ``The corruption will continue. The dictatorship will continue.
Nothing will change. Things will change when democracy is restored
in this country.''
   Rodriguez, a career bureaucrat who has served Noriega for 20
years, donned the presidential sash in a 20-minute televised
ceremony. The ceremony was closed to the public and press, and the
diplomatic corps was not invited.
   The Council of State on Thursday designated Rodriguez, 50, as
president and Carlos Ozores Typaldos, a 49-year-old jurist, as vice
president.
   Supreme Court President Marisol Reyes de Vasquez administered the
oath of office to both.
   Rodriguez spoke for about four minutes, quoting poet Khalil
Gibran and promising to ``carry out my work with love, with love of
my country, with energy and, above all, with dedication to serve the
best interests'' of Panama.
   At a news conference afterward, he defended the legality of the
provisional government, calling it ``a product of the best political
options after the dialogue with the opposition was interrupted.''
   Rodriguez later appealed in a nationally televised speech for an
end to the face-off between Panama and the United States.
   ``In this transition phase, the United States has a magnificent
opportunity to show the world its sincere concern for establishing a
solid democracy in Panama by letting Panamanians decide for
themselves,'' he said.
   Rodriguez did not mention new elections in his 30-minute speech.
   In an interview, Ricardo Arias Calderon of the opposition
Christian Democratic Party called the swearing-in ``equivalent to a
coup d'etat carried out in order to place the country completely
outside any constitutional government, and thus assure the
continuation in power of General Noriega.''
   Asked if the opposition planned any demonstrations, he said:
``Under present circumstances that is not feasible. We have had
since May over 200 people imprisoned.''
   Rodriguez was appointed to fill the constitutional void created
when the Noriega-controlled government annulled the May 7 general
election.
   The opposition later refused Noriega's invitation to join a
junta, saying it would continue to press for recognition of its May
7 victory and Noriega's departure from power.
   International observers of the election said the opposition won
by about a 3-1 margin. The government said it was annulling the
election because of alleged U.S. interference.
   Rodriguez asked for international support in what he called
Panama's attempt to achieve a democracy in the face of U.S.
aggression.
   He is the sixth person to don the presidential sash since Noriega
became commander of the Defense Forces in 1983, succeeding the late
Gen. Omar Torrijos as Panama's military strongman.
   Only one, Nicolas Ardito Barletta, was elected. He was forced to
resign in 1986.
   Panama's Council of State said the provisional government will
consider calling new elections in six months if the United States
releases Panamanian funds frozen in U.S. banks, lifts economic
sanctions and ends what it termed ``U.S. aggression.''
   The freeze was imposed after Noriega's indictment last year as
part of U.S. support of the opposition campaign to force the general
to resign.
   Noriega says the campaign against him is a thinly veiled plot by
U.S. rightists to renege on the 1977 treaties. Under the treaties,
Panama is to take full control of the Panama Canal at the end of the
century.
   Bush said Friday the United States ``will not have any diplomatic
contact with the Noriega regime.''
   He said that ``the candidates chosen by the Panamanian people
will not be allowed to take office today, as required by the
Panamanian Constitution. Panama is therefore, as of this date,
without any legitimate government.''
   Bush's decison will have little practical impact. The U.S.
Embassy remains open and officials said there were no plans to close
it down.

   Nevado del Ruiz, the volcano that wiped
out a valley and 23,000 people in 1985, spouted steam and ashes
Friday but then grew calm, an official said. People living nearby
were evacuated.
   ``Volcanic activity has decreased significantly,'' said Camilo
Cardenas, head of President Virgilio Barco's emergency committee.
   A plume of smoke that reached five miles high earlier was down to
half a mile by 12:30 p.m., and ``so far there hasn't been any
indication of avalanches,'' he said.
   Nevado del Ruiz erupted Nov. 13, 1985, melting parts of its
icecap. Boulders, trees and mud dammed a river, and when the barrier
broke, a wall of mud 150 feet high swept down the valley onto the
sleeping town of Armero.
   The 16,000-foot volcano began spewing ash and smoke shortly after
Thursday midnight, officials said. The emergency office in
Manizales, a city of 300,000 about 15 miles away, said 2,500 people
would have to be evacuated from river areas that might be flooded.
   Later Friday, the committee said the volcano's activity had
regressed to a moderate state and a red alert was reduced to a less
serious orange alert.
   Airplane flights diverted from the volcano were resumed late
Friday but highway traffic was restricted to emergency vehicles.
   Television pictures showed Manizales with dark, ash-filled skies
at noon. People in the streets covered their noses and mouths with
handkerchiefs.
   Cardenas said Barco cut short a trip to a north central
provincial town and made an observation flight over the volcano.

   The parent company of United Airlines said Friday
it was considering a $6.5 billion buyout proposal from a group that
included the company's employees, senior management and British
Airways PLC.
   UAL Corp.'s board of directors said it had received and was
reviewing the $300 a share proposal, which tops an earlier offer of
$6.19 billion, or $275 a share, by investor Marvin Davis, and was
willing to consider other offers as well.
   UAL's announcement capped a week of frenzied takeover speculation
involving the nation's biggest airlines and kicked off a full-scale
bidding war for the Chicago-based company, parent of United Airlines.
   The UAL board also indicated that Davis had informed it that he
might sweeten his current offer to more than $300 a share after he
reviewed confidential corporate data.
   No decisions were made, but the UAL board said a committee of
independent directors would consider any proposals or financial
alternatives available to the company.
   The stock of UAL, parent of United Airlines, jumped $7.25 to $287
a share Friday on reports that United's pilots union, management and
British Air was preparing a bid for the carrier.
   Under the proposal made by the group, British Airways would
control 15 percent of the consortium that would acquire UAL. Under
federal law, foreign carriers may not control more than 25 percent
of a domestic carrier.
   The employees, including the pilots and staff of UAL, would
participate through an employee stock ownership plan that would hold
a majority of shares. In return the employees would agree to
unspecified wage concessions, the UAL board said in a statement.
   The management element of the consortium would include Stephen
Wolf, UAL's chief executive officer, and Jack Pope, its executive
vice president.
   Wolf would be asked to sit on the board of British Airways, and
Sir Colin Marshall, British Airways' deputy chairman and chief
executive, would sit on the UAL board.
   In a prepared statement, Wolf said the buyout proposal did not
contemplate the sale of any essential assets or the revision of its
plans for fleet expansion and new routes.
   British Airways, the world's biggest international carrier,
issued a statement saying it had agreed in principle to invest $750
million in the consortium in a combination of junior and senior
securities.
   British Airways Chairman Lord King said the proposal would allow
United and British Airways to form ``the most formidable
international partnership in every part of the globe.'' United is
the second largest U.S. airline.
   Earlier reports about the group's proposal indicated the pilots
union might put up as much as $1 billion, with funds coming from two
of the union's pension funds, one of which is overfunded.
   The rest of the buyout funding apparently would be borrowed.
   United pilots said in a statement they were pleased the employee
ownership plan was being considered.
   ``We look forward to a positive response from United's board of
directors to our joint labor-management proposal.''
   Also Friday, the leadership of the flight attendants' union at
United approved a resolution directing its representatives to pursue
participation in employee ownership of the airline.
   ``The airline is in play and we intend to protect our members'
interests,'' said Pat Friend, president of the Association of Flight
Attendants United unit. ``An employee stock ownership plan for
flight attendants may be the best way ... to do that.''
   A relationship between United and British Airways would further
link two of the world's biggest commercial airlines.
   UAL has a fleet of 421 aircraft serving more than 151 cities in
North America and the Pacific region.
   UAL also owns 50 percent of the Apollo computerized reservation
system, one of the nation's largest, with British Airways holding an
11 percent stake in that business.
   British Airways in December 1987 entered into a joint marketing
agreement with United that included the sharing of facilities at
five major U.S. airports plus joint marketing.
   Davis' bid for UAL and the recent buyout of NWA Inc., parent of
Northwest Airlines, have ignited a speculative fever in airline
company stocks.
   But the U.S. Department of Transportation hinted Wednesday it may
move soon to curb leveraged buyouts and foreign investments in the
airline industry.
   Jeffrey Shane, assistant transportation secretary for policy and
international affairs, said the agency was concerned that a high
degree of debt from an airline buyout could compromise an airline's
safety.

   The White House is putting a $7.8 billion price
tag on its new drug strategy but intends to withhold from the
American public details about 30 percent of the plan, according to
an administration source.
   Speaking on the condition of anonymity, the source said Thursday
the government plans to keep secret classified sections outlining
intelligence operations and detailing how it far it will go in
pursuing drug traffickers.
   White House chief of staff John Sununu said Thursday in
Kennebunkport, Maine, that assembling the $7.8 billion could involve
shifting money from other programs. President Bush is scheduled to
announce the new policy in a nationally televised speech Tuesday
night.
   ``You don't want the narco-traffickers to know what the limits
are,'' the source said. ``We can't let them know how far we would go
before retaliation or how far before we pump more money in.''

agency program.
   Although the report praises Kemp's commitment to ridding the
Department of Housing and Urban Development of mismanagement, it
said some of the blame for the slow pace of improvements in the
single-family home program rests at his feet.
   ``Problems still exist and will continue to exist unless there is
a coordinated leadership drive by the various offices in
headquarters who are responsible for property disposition
activities,'' the auditors said in an Aug. 25 report obtained by The
Associated Press.
   ``This leadership and coordination was not apparent during our

   Captors holding U.S. hostages in Lebanon are
motivated by a personal vengeance that will be more difficult to
overcome since Israel kidnapped a Moslem cleric, says a U.S. Moslem
leader who claims to have met with the hostage-holders in Beirut.
   Mohammed Mehdi, secretary-general of the National Council on
Islamic Affairs, said Thursday the kidnapping of Sheik Abdul-Karim
Obeid worsened the prospects that the ``exceptionally bitter,
exceptionally paranoid'' kidnappers will free the hostages.
   ``They feel the right to retaliation is sacred, and any
questioning of that is illegitimate,'' said Mehdi, who claims to be
possibly the only person in the United States who has met with the
kidnappers in Beirut.
   Obeid _ who is affiliated with Hezbollah, the pro-Iranian
extremist group believed to sponsor hostage-holders _ was abducted
from his home in south Lebanon July 28 by Israeli commandos. Israel,
saying Obeid was involved in terrorism, has refused to free him.

<HEAD>In Two Months as Argentina's President, Carlos Menem Gains Support</HEAD>
<HEAD>An AP Extra</HEAD>

<BYLINE>By ED McCULLOUGH</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>BUENOS AIRES, Argentina (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   In his first two months in office,
President Carlos Menem has imposed drastic measures on Argentines to
bring their chaotic economy back into line _ and he is winning their
support.
   He has more than tripled prices for public services _
electricity, gas and water rates; subway, bus and train fares _ and
has temporarily shored up an economy that had set off food riots and
forced the Radical Civic Union's Raul Alfonsin out of the presidency
22 weeks before his term was up.
   And while one of every two Argentines did not vote for Menem, the
Peronist, in May's presidential election, he now is gaining favor
for what he has done so far.
   ``There is more stability,'' said Juan Manuel Casa, a 29-year-old
car salesman who didn't vote for Menem. ``He's doing the right
things.''
   ``I think Menem is the only way to save the country,'' said
Ricardo Gutierrez, a suit salesman, who also did not vote for Menem.
   The public-service price increases have narrowed an unsustainable
budget deficit, while a 54 percent devaluation has stabilized the
austral currency and brought down interest rates.
   Wage and price guidelines have cooled hyperinflation. While the
cost of living rose by 197 percent in July, the rate for August is
projected at 35 percent and for September at 10 percent or less.
   ``What's most important is that it is going down,'' said Victor
Vazquez-Presedo, a business school dean, noting that inflation had
not risen for the first time since last November. ``Everyone thought
we were mired in hyperinflation and that was frightening.''
   Stores in Buenos Aires are well stocked now. Merchants are no
longer worried about inflation rising from day to day and accept
credit cards again. The price of a steak or a quart of milk no
longer is front-page news.
   Early rains have bolstered predictions of a 41 million-ton farm
harvest, including wheat, soybeans and corn, which would mean a 60
percent increase over last year's harvest. Central Bank reserves
have increased to about $1 billion. The International Monetary Fund
has resumed negotiations on Argentina's request for a $1.5
billion-loan.
   Although taking a taxi and dining out still are relative luxuries
for most Argentines, real wages are about 30 percent higher than
they were in June, if still 30 percent below what they were in
January.
   ``I have friends who renewed their passports in anticipation that
things would not get better,'' said Isidro Soloaga, an economist
with the Latin America Research Foundation. ``Now, no one talks
about that and hardly any left.''
   Menem's popularity has increased since the election May 14. To
his Peronist Party's base of organized labor, he has attracted
middle-class support by appointing a conservative Cabinet, pledging
to sell off state industries, and lowering taxes on farm exports.
   Two polls have put his public approval rating at 80 percent or
better. In the election, he won just under 50 percent of the vote in
the multiparty race.
   ``What our polls are showing is that ... when people are shown
economic plans they have faith in, even though there must be
sacrifices, there is public support,'' said Marbita Carballo de
Cilley, who directed the Gallup poll that gave Menem a positive
rating of 87 percent.
   Menem has persuaded organized labor to accept wage increases
below inflation rates, big business to contribute to social welfare
programs, provinces to forgo federal subsidies, farmers to plant
more wheat and soybeans.
   He also has taken the political risk of talking to the British
about restoring the diplomatic relations broken off when the
Argentine military governnent then in power launched an invasion of
the Falkland Islands in 1982 _ only to go down to defeat.
   Human rights groups aren't happy, however, about a pending pardon
or amnesty for military officers accused of torturing and executing
people they suspected of being leftist subversives during the
1976-83 dictatorship.
   ``I don't think people will react violently to a pardon,'' said
Hebe de Bonafini, president of the Mothers of the Plaza de Mayo,
whose children disappeared or were killed in the military years.
``People are hemmed in by the economy, by hunger.''
   While Menem apparently is off to a good start, success remains a
long way off.
   An estimated 9 million of Argentina's 32 million people live at
or below the poverty line, and about one of every seven workers is
unemployed. Soup kitchens set up three months ago are still open.
   Unions representing doctors, teachers, commuter-train personnel
and others have gone on strike for higher wages or have announced
plans to do so. Police in northwest Tucuman province 25 had to use
tear gas Aug. 25 to break up a sit-in by several hundred public
employees.
   The political coalition Menem forged after taking office has
approved legislation transferring authority from Congress to the
presidency to sell state companies, but it is fraying over proposals
to suspend subsidies to businesses and the provinces.
   Organized labor fears the selling of state-run companies may lead
to cutbacks in jobs and wages, despite Menem's assurances to the
contrary. Political opponents worry that Menem might be
concentrating too much power in the presidency.
   The coalition may or may not hold together for other pending
legislation, including tax reform and updating the constitution to
allow a president to seek re-election.
   But for now, Argentines are taking Menem on faith.

<BYLINE>AP Television Writer</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   Diana Rigg started her acting career in
Shakespeare, but she will be forever known as the exotically
beautiful, black-leather-clad counterspy on the British series ``The
Avengers.''
   Although that was more than 20 years ago, her stint as Mrs. Emma
Peel was unforgetable. Since then, other than a short-lived and
unmemorable American sitcom in 1973-74 called ``Diana,'' she has
rarely been seen in this country.
   Rigg makes up for it this season as she succeeds Vincent Price as
host of ``Mystery!'' on PBS at the start of the new season on
Thursday, Oct. 12. The show is an anthology of the best English
mysteries.
   ``I don't think there will be a major difference other than the
question of our personalities,'' she said on a visit to this country
to promote the show and tape her appearances at WGBH in Boston.
   ``Mystery!'' is noted for Edward Gorey's Gothic steel engravings
for the title sequences, and Gorey has designed a new black and
white set for the host that has a one-dimensional look.
   ``I'm not playing a part. I am myself. I suppose it will evolve,
but it's always dangerous to speak up front. I'd rather wait and
see. My job is to introduce each show. For those who know the
characters it's an affirmation and for those who don't it's an
explanation.
   ``Plus, we'll also take a wider approach to the subject at hand.
For example, we'll talk about the rules of law as they developed in
England for the `Rumpole of the Bailey' series. I like the idea of
giving a tidge of information.''
   Rigg recently completed a miniseries for the BBC called ``Mother
Love'' that may show up on ``Mystery!'' It's a decidedly different
role from Emma Peel.
   ``It's the story of a woman who brings up her son by herself
after her divorce,'' she said. ``She loves her son passionately and
believes he's never seen his father in the years since the divorce.
But the father and son carry on a deception, and when the mother
finds out, murder and mayhem ensue.''
   She plays the mother, David McCallum (``Man From U.N.C.L.E.'') is
the father and the son is James Wilby, who stars in a new version of
``A Tale of Two Cities'' for ``Masterpiece Theatre'' this season.
   ``The Avengers,'' British television's version of James Bond,
starred Patrick Macnee as a suave secret agent in a bowler. It was
witty, absurd and diabolical. His first female partner was Honor
Blackman, who left to play Pussy Galore in the Bond movie
``Goldfinger.'' Rigg was his partner, Emma Peel, when the show began
its run on ABC in 1966. She stayed with it two years, then was
replaced by Linda Thorson. It left ABC in 1969, but was later seen
on late-night on CBS.
   ``It was a very stylistic show and it set the tone for a lot that
followed,'' she said. ``It certainly set the pattern for women as
equal partners. James Bond hasn't reached that yet. It was ahead of
its time and quite original for television.
   ``Emma Peel saw herself as the equal of any man. She could
compete without being strident. Patrick and I chose a very
tongue-in-cheek approach. That made it more fun for us and more
believable for the audience. There's no question that people
remember me most for `The Avengers,' but one has to move on. You
don't expect an artist to paint the same picture over and over.''
   Rigg played a Spanish contessa in the 1969 Bond film ``On Her
Majesty's Secret Service.'' It was the only movie in which 007 got
married and in which George Lazenby played Bond. She and Price, her
predecessor on ``Mystery!'' were in ``Theatre of Blood'' in 1973.
   Rigg, who is married to British producer Archie Sterling, said
she has tapered off her career since the birth of her daughter 12
years ago. Still, she was in a new version of ``Witness for the
Prosecution'' for CBS and recently was on the stage in London in
``Follies.''

   The stock market's strength has presented a
special challenge for a breed of Wall Streeters known as technical
analysts: How do you interpret charts and indicators when prices
reach levels never seen before?
   All but the newest of newcomers have experience dealing with this
kind of situation, from the day in early 1983 when the Dow Jones
industrial average hit 1,070 for the first time through the top at
2,722 in August 1987.
   But all that practice wasn't enough for them to find any
foolproof system for determining when a market at new peaks has
further to go and when it is running out of steam.
   Most do agree that stocks now are nowhere near the extreme
``overvalued'' levels they reached two years ago, so easy to spot
now with the advantage of hindsight.
   Still, a good many chart-watchers see cause for concern, or at
least caution, heading into the last four months of 1989.
   Consider that most basic of measures for evaluating the market,
the ratio of stock prices to corporate earnings.
   As measured by the leading market indexes, the price-earnings
ratio of a typical stock recently stood at about 13 to 1, down from
about 20 to 1 in 1987.
   ``P-E ratios at 13 or so don't seem `too high,''' said Martin
Zweig, editor of the investment advisory letter The Zweig Forecast.
   ``But what are `peak earnings' worth? The business cycle has been
up for seven years. If we're headed for recession, stocks are
anything but cheap.''
   Zweig also notes that stocks are trading at more than 2.5 times
their book value, or theoretical worth if the companies they
represent were liquidated. Only twice before has that ratio been
higher, just preceding the crashes of 1929 and 1987.
   Short-term measures of sentiment, or enthusiasm for stocks,
``deteriorated expectably in August,'' said Philip Roth, technical
analyst at the securities firm of Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc.
   Roth also observed, however, ``The trend is up. We would become
more negative on it only if volume stays high but prices fail to
move ahead.''
   Andrew Gold at Prudential-Bache Securities says several measures
of ``momentum,'' such as the cumulative number of stocks advancing
minus those declining, topped out a few weeks ago, before the Dow
Jones industrials and other market indicators pushed on to new highs.
   This and other signals ``suggest the market is headed for an
intermediate-term peak sometime this fall,'' he contends.
   But amid all the wariness, some analysts cast ringing votes for
further market gains.
   ``At no time in the past 18 months have conditions been more
bullish than they are today,'' proclaims Stephen Leeb, editor of the
advisory letter Indicator Digest.
   ``Some might argue that stocks are no longer cheap, since P-Es
have risen. While that is true, it is also true that inflation has
fallen.
   ``What really counts is not the absolute level of P-Es, but how
high P-Es are relative to inflation. By that measure stocks are
about as cheap as they have been in the postwar period.''
   Leeb says he believes the bull market has at least another year
to run. ``There are going to be reactions along the way, maybe some
as severe as 7 percent or 9 percent,'' he concludes.
   ``But the big rewards will continue to go to those who play the
big trend rather than the short-term swings.''

<HEAD>Labor Celebrates Success Abroad, But Questions Abound At Home</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Striking Eastern Airlines employees, coal
miners and phone workers are the symbol of both the uncertainty and
solidarity the American labor movement reflects on this Labor Day.
   In an extraordinary year, labor has suffered some major losses
yet won some impressive victories, although the spotlight on the
negatives has tended to obscure the bright spots.
   A number of unions have proven that labor-management cooperation
can work but, as in the case of the United Auto Workers, learned as
well that too much of a ``good'' thing can prove troublesome.
   Others have found hope in their solidarity _ particularly in the
Eastern and miners' strikes _ but will spend labor's traditional
holiday wondering if their jobs are the price they will pay for
their pride and determination.
   The movement has lost one nemesis, Ronald Reagan, but gained
another, Frank Lorenzo.
   Union workers here can take pride in remarkable developments in
Poland _ their dues helped support the Solidarity trade union from
its underground days to its historic rise as leader of the first
non-communist government in the East bloc. Through the AFL-CIO, U.S.
unions funneled thousands of dollars worth of printing equipment and
other supplies to Solidarity while it was outlawed.
   ``I think the role of the American trade union movement in this
should not be overlooked,'' AFL-CIO President Lane Kirkland said
last week.
   Kirkland, head of the 14-million member AFL-CIO, the major
umbrella group for the nearly 18 million Americans who belong to
unions, says those who are eulogizing the labor movement don't
understand it.
   ``The key to any evaluation of the labor movement ought to
examine what we regard as the most important measure and that is
internal cohesiveness and solidarity,'' he said. ``And I think it's
fair to say that we do have a higher degree of solidarity and
cohesion today than we've had in many, many years.''
   A number of developments bolster Kirkland's point. Among them:
   _The virtually unprecedented support of the pilots' union when
the Machinists union struck Eastern on March 4.
   _Joint negotiations between former enemies, the Communications
Workers of America and the International Brotherhood of Electrical
Workers, with AT&amp;T and the ``baby Bell'' regional telephone
companies. That solidarity continued in a number of strikes against
the regional companies.
   _Nationwide wildcat strikes to support 1,700 miners who struck
Pittston Coal Group after lengthy and bitter negotiations failed to
bring a settlement. Pittston is seeking to halt its contributions to
union pension funds, a move that likely would cause other companies
to follow suit.
   Still, there have been setbacks for labor as well.
   A trickle of defections among union pilots turned into a steady
flow that has allowed Eastern _ and Lorenzo _ to move ahead with
plans to reorganize the carrier as a smaller, non-union airline.
Labor still hopes to use Congress and bankruptcy court to oust
Lorenzo but its chances appear slim as the strike reaches the
six-month mark on Labor Day.
   The most highly publicized failure of ``Big Labor'' was the Auto
Workers' defeat in an election at a Nissan plant in Smyrna, Tenn.,
its first attempt to organize a U.S. plant fully owned by the
Japanese. The UAW lost by a 2-1 margin in a fight many within labor
said the UAW was too hasty to bring to a conclusion by calling the
election.
   The vote came just weeks after UAW President Owen Bieber beat
back a drive by a dissident group that sought to oust the union's
leadership because of labor-management cooperation the group said
had gone too far.
   At Nissan, and at other industries that traditionally have been
the backbone of trade unions, the labor movement is running into two
main obstacles: management programs to undermine union support by
giving workers more say and perks, and intricate anti-union
campaigns to defeat organizing drives including screening applicants
to determine their attitudes toward unions.
   At Smyrna, Nissan screened more than 100,000 workers for about
3,000 jobs.
   But Kirkland said the Japanese aren't to blame for doing that.
   ``They are led into this course in some cases not by anything
inherent in their culture or their own countries, because in many
instances they have a history of dealing with trade unions in their
own countries with good faith, but are following the advice of
hustlers, American hustlers, who have made a new profession out of
trying to guide employers for a fee,'' Kirkland said.
   To counter such tactics, labor is changing the way it looks at
organizing and now accepts as ``associate members'' workers at
plants where organizing efforts failed and immigrant workers looking
for residency status in the United States.
   By getting its foot in the door, and offering those workers
benefits such as cut-rate credit cards, insurance and legal
services, unions hope to foster goodwill that will bring success in
later elections.
   Such a concept, once reviled by traditionalists in the movement,
has brought in 300,000 associate members in the past three years
and, according to Kirkland and other federation officials, is
beginning to pick up steam.
   The federation also is now stepping in to avoid most fighting
among unions by deciding which affiliate should get the chance at
non-union companies targeted for organizing. And the affiliates are
making fresh efforts at attracting women, minorities and workers in
the growing service sector.
   The noisy year for labor has to some degree obscured some
remarkable contract agreements.
   The Steelworkers union won back many of the concessions workers
were forced to give earlier in the decade when the industry was
nearly crippled.
   The CWA and IBEW came out of the AT&amp;T talks and the regional
negotiations settled so far with contracts that include innovative
packages of parental leave, elder care and child care benefits.
   And UAW workers at a joint Chrysler-Mitsubishi plant in Illinois
last week agreed on a new contract believed to have the best
job-protection provisions ever included in a major industrial
contract.
   In the final months of 1989 the Eastern strike and legislative
initiatives are likely to dominate labor's agenda.
   Pending on Capitol Hill are efforts to raise the minimum wage and
a number of other labor-backed measures, including expanded child
care benefits and a number of bills designed to curb mergers and
acquisitions. Also pending, but unlikely to pass, is a measure
designed to force President Bush to intervene in the Eastern strike.
   Kirkland refers to Bush as ``Reagan Lite,'' sharing his former
boss' pro-management bent but not his virulent anti-union
philosophy. Bush is regarded as no friend of the labor movement, but
not as its No. 1 enemy, as was Reagan.
   That designation has been passed to Lorenzo, who was successful
in making Continental Airlines a non-union carrier and appears on
the verge of winning again at Eastern.
   His recent talk of selling Continental has sparked hope in the
labor movement that the airline unions might yet pull a victory out
of defeat.
   Kirkland said there will be no winners even if the carrier
returns to the union fold. But his contempt for Lorenzo was clearly
evident as he added a caveat.
   ``Scorched earth on both sides is not a victory,'' he said. ``Of
course it's better than scorched earth on just one side.''

   Marlon Brando, Paul Newman, Gregory Peck and
Audrey Hepburn return to the screen this fall, adding starpower to
new films that are expected to continue the industry's
record-breaking year at the nation's theaters.
   ``The autumn movies look better than last year's; every company
has promising films,'' comments John Krier of Exhibitor Relations
Co., which compiles box-office figures. ``It's a well-balanced fall.
   ``In addition to the new films, several of the summer movies will
continue into the fall. `Batman' and `Lethal Weapon 2' are holding
well, and there is also strength in `Parenthood,' `When Harry Met
Sally ...' and `sex, lies and videotape.'''
   Drama is the strong suit in the Hollywood autumn this year. The
most anticipated return is that of Marlon Brando, missing from the
screen for nine years. He stars with Donald Sutherland in ``A Dry
White Season,'' about a white family and a black family in 1976
South Africa.
   Brando also just finished shooting ``The Freshman'' with Matthew
Broderick in Canada. He predicted the movie would be a flop, and
announced to the Canadian press that he was fed up with moviemaking
and ``The Freshman'' was his last film.
   ``I wish I hadn't finished with a stinker,'' he said.
   Paul Newman, whose last film was his Academy Award-winning ``The
Color of Money,'' will be seen in two movies. In ``Fat Man and
Little Boy'' he takes part in the building of the first atomic bomb.
In ``Blaze,'' he's Louisiana governor Earl K. Long, who had a
much-publicized romance with a stripper, Blaze Starr (Lolita
Davidovich).
   Gregory Peck returns in ``Old Gringo,'' playing the American
iconoclast Ambrose Bierce in a Mexican revolution adventure also
starring Jane Fonda and Jimmy Smits.
   A film directed by Steven Spielberg is always an event. This fall
will bring his ``Always,'' loosely based on the World War II
fantasy, ``A Guy Named Joe.'' The stars: Audrey Hepburn, Richard
Dreyfuss and Holly Hunter.
   Other star turns include:
   Bette Midler in ``Stella,'' the fourth version of the tearjerker
``Stella Dallas.''
   Jessica Lange as a criminal lawyer defending her father on war
crime charges in ``Music Box.''
   Jane Fonda and Robert De Niro as a widow and a fellow factory
worker who can't read in ``Stanley and Iris.''
   Jack Nicholson in ``The Two Jakes,'' the long-postponed sequel to
``Chinatown.''
   Tom Selleck as a airline worker serving time after a frameup by
crooked cops in ``An Innocent Man.''
   Al Pacino and Ellen Barkin in ``Sea of Love,'' described as ``an
erotic suspense thriller.''
   Jack Lemmon, Ted Danson and Olympia Dukakis in a generational
drama, ``Dad.''
   Tom Cruise in ``Born on the Fourth of July,'' based on the life
of the handicapped Vietnam veteran Ron Kovic.
   Bruce Willis and Emily Lloyd in Norman Jewison's ``In Country,''
about a family struggling to heal Vietnam war wounds.
   And for one of the biggest star casts in years, see ``Steel
Magnolias,'' from the hit play by Robert Harling about life in a
Southern beauty parlor. The players: Sally Field, Dolly Parton,
Shirley MacLaine, Daryl Hannah, Olympia Dukakis, Julia Roberts, Tom
Skerritt and Sam Shepard.
   ``The Fabulous Baker Boys'' stars Jeff and Beau Bridges as
brothers who are cocktail-lounge piano players. Into their lives
falls Michelle Pfeiffer.
   Helen Mirren and Paul Scofield in ``When the Whales Came.'' Set
on the Isles of Scilly at the beginning of World War I, the film is
about our relationship with the natural world, specifically with
narwhals.
   ``Enemies, a Love Story'' is director Paul Mazursky's adaptation
of Isaac Bashevis Singer's novel about a man (Ron Silver) and his
entanglements with three women: Anjelica Huston, Lena Olin and
Margaret Stein.
   Milos Forman's films are much anticipated. This time he has
undertaken another version of ``Les Liaisons Dangereuses,'' the last
being ``Dangerous Liaisons.'' Forman's is called ``Valmont.''
   Also in the dramatic vein: ``To Kill a Priest,'' Ed Harris and
Christopher Lambert; ``Johnny Handsome,'' Mickey Rourke and Morgan
Freeman; ``Welcome Home,'' Kris Kristofferson and JoBeth Williams;
Jessica Tandy, Freeman and Dan Aykroyd in the Broadway hit ``Driving
Miss Daisy.''
   Comedy isn't overlooked. Woody Allen returns in a film as yet
untitled, but he has revealed the cast: himself, Alan Alda, Daryl
Hannah, Anjelica Huston and Sam Waterston. Eddie Murphy and Richard
Pryor will appear in ``Harlem Nights,'' written and directed by
Murphy who was also executive producer.
   ``The War of the Roses'' features Michael Douglas, Kathleen
Turner and Danny DeVito in a comedy directed by DeVito. Douglas and
Turner star as a wealthy couple whose divorce attorney is played by
DeVito.
   Robert De Niro and Sean Penn undertake comedy in ``We're No
Angels,'' based on the Humphrey Bogart-Aldo Ray movie about escaped
cons. Glenn Close and James Woods also abandon drama for a humorous
look at parenthood in ``Immediate Family.'' Michael J. Fox and the
whole gang return in ``Back to the Future Part II.'' Look for Part
III next year.
   Monty Python's Terry Jones directs a spoof, ``Erik the Viking,''
with buddy John Cleese and Tim Robbins. Christopher Guest of
``Saturday Night Live'' takes on the New Hollywood in ``The Big
Picture,'' with Kevin Bacon as a film student turned hotshot
director.
   ``Worth Winning'' stars Mark Harmon as a handsome TV weatherman
whose dating habits are put to the test when a friend bets that he
can't get engaged to three women within three months.
   Chevy Chase and Beverly D'Angelo return as the troubled Griswolds
in ``National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation.'' John Laroquette and
Bronson Pinchot appear in a cop comedy, ``Second Sight.''
   Adventure is in fairly short supply. ``The Bear'' is based on
James Oliver Curwood's ``The Grizzly Bear,'' directed by
Jean-Jacques Annaud. ``The Bear,'' which stars a bear, is a French
movie released through Price Entertainment. It was released in Japan
and throughout Europe in 1987 and is coming to England. It has done
more than $90 million overseas.
   Sean Connery, Dustin Hoffman and Matthew Broderick play three
generations of robbers who attempt a big heist in ``Family
Business.'' Broderick and Denzel Washington star in ``Glory,'' about
a black fighting regiment in the Civil War. Michael Douglas is a New
York cop who braves the Japanese underworld in ``Black Rain.''
   Sylvester Stallone is back in the slammer again in ``Tango and
Cash,'' along with Kurt Russell; they're rival Los Angeles cops
framed by drug dealers. ``Next of Kin'' offers Patrick Swayze and
Liam Neeson in a Chicago police story.
   Two new animated features will provide some entertainment for the
younger crowd and their parents: ``The Little Mermaid,'' the first
Disney fairy tale since ``Sleeping Beauty'' in 1958; ``All Dogs Go
to Heaven,'' from Don Bluth (``An American Tail,'' ``The Land before
Time'').
   Awards for the busiest actors of the fall go to Olympia Dukakis
and John Goodman, each with three films. How does he ever find time
away from ``Roseanne''?

<HEAD>Specialty Retailers and Apparel Makers in Fashion Among Stock Pickers</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARYBETH NIBLEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Big-ticket items ranging from refrigerators to
cars have moved slowly out of stores this year, but clothing has
been selling at a healthy rate.
   This pattern has drawn attention to stocks of retailers
specializing in apparel, particularly women's fashions, and clothing
manufacturers.
   Several Wall Street analysts expect the trend to continue and
recommend investing in selected retailers and apparel makers that
stand to profit from current spending preferences.
   The latest results from the country's major retailers showed
apparel sales rose again in August from the past year's blah pace.
The buildup in sales momentum was given an extra nudge by
back-to-school business.
   Jeffrey Feiner, a retail analyst at Merrill Lynch &amp; Co., says
part of the pickup in August reflected the weakness at apparel
stores a year earlier when women rejected clothing styles. Women are
busily replacing worn out wardrobes this year after finding few
fashions that suited them for the last two years.
   ``We believe that the somewhat better-than-expected August sales
increases continue to reflect some shift in consumer spending away
from automobiles, houses and bigger ticket durables and toward the
enhancement of wardrobes,'' Feiner says, noting that high credit
costs and an uncertain economic outlook have made consumers
reluctant to make large outlays for expensive goods.
   ``We also believe this trend bodes well for retailers' profit
outlook,'' Feiner says.
   Cash registers at accessory and cosmetics counters also are
ringing up better sales.
   Low inflation in clothing prices should help maintain the rebound
in apparel spending, says Deborah Bronston, a textile and apparel
analyst at Prudential-Bache Securities Inc.
   With the memory of poor business in recent years still fresh,
manufacturers and specialty retailers have made an effort to control
price increases. Prices for materials and imports aren't rising as
fast as they had in other years in this decade, which makes
controlling markups somewhat easier.
   Clothing makers across the board are benefiting, says Bronston,
citing Leslie Fay Cos., Liz Claiborne Inc., Oshkosh B'Gosh Inc. and
Russell Corp. as examples.
   Elizabeth Armstrong, an analyst at Prescott, Ball &amp; Turben Inc.,
says her company also considers several clothing makers to be fine
investments right now, mentioning that prospects appear good for
Phillips-Van Heusen Corp. especially because of the improving
profitability at the G.H. Bass &amp; Co. shoe manufacturing division it
acquired in 1987.
   Robert Raiff of C.J. Lawrence, Morgan Grenfell Inc. said that as
a group, apparel makers haven't really responded yet to the apparel
spending recovery, which means opportunities exist for significant
appreciation in stock prices.
   Among the clothing companies he thinks have substantial room for
improvement are Brown Group Inc., Hartmarx Corp., V.F. Corp., and
Kellwood Corp.
   Christopher Vroom of Alex. Brown &amp; Sons Inc. points out that
specialty apparel retailers have consistentedly outperformed mass
merchandisers, such as Sears, Roebuck and Co. and K mart Corp., this
year.
   Chains including Limited Inc., one of the country's leading
specialty apparel merchants, appear on investment firms' lists of
recommendations. Others talked about favorably on Wall Street
include Charming Shoppes Inc., Claire Stores Inc., Deb Shops, Gap
Inc. and Merry Go Round Enterprises Inc. as well as numerous
department stores that emphasize apparel.

<HEAD>Woodcutting Time: Play Safe With Chainsaws</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RANDOLPH E. SCHMID</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   With the arrival of autumn, thoughts begin
turning to keeping warm in winter's chill. That anticipation sends
thousands of Americans into the woods with chain saws, exacting a
heavy toll of fingers and toes among the unwary.
   In a typical year, the Consumer Product Safety Commission
reports, as many as 125,000 people are treated in hospital emergency
rooms for injuries related to chain saws.
   The largest share of injuries, nearly one in three, occur when
the saw operator is moving the saw, or changing his position, and
touches the moving cutting chain. The answer is simple: carefulness.
   Kickback is the No. 2 cause of injury, causing some 20 percent of
chain saw accidents, according to the safety commission. And
kickback injuries are often the most severe, with the chain striking
the head or face.
   Improved saws are reducing that toll, with the new models less
likely to kick back at the operator. This can still occur, however,
and the solution is the same: be careful.
   An example is remembering to hold the saw off to the side when
using it, so that if it does suddenly catch and jump back it will
miss the head and face.
   Cutting with the tip of the saw is particularly dangerous and
should be avoided.
   Saws skating or bouncing along instead of cutting account for 13
percent of saw accidents. Other major problems include loss of
balance, saws pinching and getting stuck, and tree branches falling
on the saw operator.
   Either gasoline and electric chain saws can be dangerous.
Gasoline saws can cause burns and fires; the electric ones can
result in shock if misused.
   The safety commission's advice is direct. To begin with, be sure
you know how to operate the saw correctly and that it is oiled, the
chain tension is set correctly and generally the machine is in
proper working order.
   Clear the work area so the chain will not contact anything other
than the wood to be cut. And place gasoline saws on the ground
before starting them; do not start them on your leg or knee.
   When using the saw, gloves can be a big help in maintaining a
grip. Always hold the saw firmly with both hands, and be sure of
your footing so you don't slip or lose your balance.
   When cutting larger pieces of wood use wedges to hold the sides
apart so they don't pinch the saw.
   When cutting logs, stand on the uphill side so the log doesn't
roll down on you when it comes free.
   And be very wary of cutting branches that are under tension; they
can spring loose suddenly, causing you to fall or lose control of
the saw.
   The safety commission urges dressing properly for chain-saw
cutting. This, the agency says, includes gloves and safety shoes,
eye goggles and relatively snug clothing so loose ends don't catch
on branches or the saw. A hard hat is also recommended, as are
hearing protectors in the case of gasoline-driven saws.

   Critics and pressure groups might dislike
tabloid television, but the format will be back in force this fall.
   Led by the new syndicated shows ``Crimewatch Tonight,'' ``Hard
Copy'' ``Missing-Reward'' and network shows ``Rescue: 911'' and
``Unsolved Mysteries,'' a flurry of reality-based ``news'' programs
will play a conspicuous role in the coming television season.
   Along more conventional programming lines, CBS News will
broadcast three weekly magazine shows: Thursday's ``48 Hours,''
Sunday's ``60 Minutes'' with additional correspondents Meredith
Vieira and Steve Kroft (and no more Diane Sawyer) and ``Saturday
Night With Connie Chung,'' a retooled version of the network's
``West 57th.''
   CBS has yet to announce what Chung, who recently left NBC, will
do in her new program.
   Anchorman Dan Rather will return with a three-hour special
edition of ``48 Hours: Return to Crack Street,'' an update of CBS'
ground-breaking 1986 documentary on the drug trade. ``48 Hours:
Return to Crack Street'' will be shown on Sept. 14 at 8 p.m.; after
that, ``48 Hours'' will run one hour each week.
   CBS' ``Rescue: 911,'' following emergency personnel on their
rounds, will be narrated by William Shatner and is scheduled for
Tuesdays.
   In addition to Wednesday's ``Unsolved Mysteries,'' NBC's answer
to Fox's crime-busting series ``America's Most Wanted,'' the peacock
network is set to produce occasional episodes of ``Yesterday, Today
and Tomorrow.''
   ``Yesterday, Today and Tomorrow,'' which was slammed for its use
of news re-enactments when it debuted with three episodes this
summer, may return in January as a mid-season replacement, NBC says.
It is anchored by Mary Alice Williams, Maria Shriver and Chuck
Scarborough.
   ABC has two magazine shows, its returning ``20-20'' on Friday
nights and ``PrimeTime Live,'' a one-hour show built around the top
news stories of the week. Teaming Sam Donaldson with Sawyer,
``PrimeTime Live'' will be shown on Thursdays.
   Only a few small changes are planned for the network newscasts:
Rather is considering relating the day's events for the ``CBS
Evening News'' from a standing position, and Forrest Sawyer has
replaced Donaldson as anchor of ABC's ``World News Sunday.''
   The Fox Broadcasting Corp. will present its reality-based shows
``Cops'' and ``The Reporters'' in new time periods on Saturdays. The
science-themed program ``Beyond Tomorrow'' now runs 30 minutes on
Saturdays.

   Americans came home from work last week, locked their doors,
flipped on their TVs and stared in astonishment at the fabulously
wealthy empire they had created.
   With its fine homes and ranches, its regal horses and sleek
limousines, it looked like a society worth fighting for. The
Colombian drug barons, who own it all, certainly think so.
   When the barons declared war on the Colombian government for
daring to enforce the law, President Virgilio Barco spoke out to
those he considered responsible _ American drug users.
   ``Those of you who depend on cocaine,'' he said, ``have created
the largest, most vicious criminal enterprise the world has ever
known. What might seem to be a matter of personal habit ... has
thrown us all into a war we did not ask for.''
   When President Bush goes on television Tuesday to announce his
strategy for fighting that war, he will be speaking to a nation that
considers illegal narcotics its greatest scourge.
   On any day, in almost any community, illicit drugs influence the
way people live and the way many die. What follows is a glimpse at
seven days in the battle against drugs in America.

   At 3 a.m., police go to work in Fort Walton Beach, Fla.
   Sheriff's deputies serve a warrant on a travel trailer that
allegedly serves as a crackhouse. A woman and two men are arrested
for possession of crack cocaine and drug paraphernalia.
   Those bare facts tell little about who these people are and what
brought them to this place. But the incident is typical of many such
events around the country on this or any other day.
   Crackhouses have become the 1980s equivalent of Prohibition
speak-easies, operating brazenly and raking in handsome profits. But
they're unlikely ever to evoke nostalgia. For many people, they
represent a neighborhood's ruin.
   In Spokane, Wash., 27-year-old Matthew Hartnett is arrested for
torching a suspected crackhouse. Police denounce the apparent act of
vigilantism, but neighbors applaud it.
   ``At the least,'' said one man, ``we ought to give him a
certificate of citizen appreciation.''

   A police video camera in Norfolk, Va., captures a revealing
glimpse of entrepreneurs at work.
   Two narcotics officers staking out an apartment building
courtyard say they videotaped two dealers making more than 100
cocaine deals in six hours _ about one sale every 3{ minutes.
   The stakeout comes to an abrupt halt when the suspects spot the
hidden camera through the blinds of a vacant apartment and burst in
on the officers. One suspect, 18-year-old Leonard Ingram, allegedly
fires a shot that goes wild. He is charged with attempted murder of
a police officer.
   Guns, drugs and money are now inextricably linked in an unholy
trinity. And it is violence _ not drug abuse _ that has become the
most alarming aspect of the illegal narcotics trade.
   In Los Angeles, the drug gang capital of the nation, two cars
pull up to a red light at 8:30 p.m. It's a pleasant evening, the
temperature in the 70s, a bit of light lingering after the sunset. A
gun battle erupts between occupants of the two cars, who belong to
rival drug gangs. A 17-year-old is killed and three other youths are
wounded. When police order the combatants to drop their weapons, one
allegedly points a gun at them. Four people are arrested.

   Arkansas Gov. Bill Clinton, in his weekly radio address, tells
parents about new laws that will be in effect when their children
head to class Monday. He stresses the tough penalties for people who
sell drugs near campuses and a law that prohibits students from
wearing electronic beepers that might be used to make drug deals.
   Once, such laws might have been considered Draconian, not to
mention unnecessary. Now they're typical of a barrage of anti-drug
legislation that desperate lawmakers have enacted.
   In Florida, authorities report convicted drug dealers are losing
their homes, boats, planes and jewelry under a new law permitting a
75 percent sales tax on their ill-gotten gains.
   ``There are literally tens of millions of dollars out there, and
it's the state's challenge to find that property,'' said Greg Marr,
coordinator of the program.
   In Hawaii, U.S. Marshal Faith Evans says law officers have seized
$1.3 million in real estate owned by drug dealers in the past month

   Crazy or not, Ms. Beal and her sisters are among the growing

   Just east of the main bus station in New York City, security
guard Robert Reynolds patrols a grungy block of 41st Street with the
newest recruit in the war on drugs: Damien the Doberman.
   Crack dealers and smokers had taken over the block, smoking,
sleeping, defecating and fornicating in public. So business owners
chipped in this July to hire 24-hour private guards, who patrol with
a nightstick in one hand and a chain leash in the other.
   ``Within one week we had eliminated most of the problem,'' said
Carl Person, who organized the effort. ``Police are limited, but a
dog doesn't know from constitutional rights. If a dog goes `woof
woof,' the people can't argue with it.''
   The guard service costs $1,750 a week, with business people
contributing from $25 to $250, depending on their rent.
   ``It's expensive, it's an added tax, but unfortunately it's the
only way to do it in New York City,'' said Ron Savitt, a
businessman. ``There will never be enough police to cover it.''
   The same complaint is heard elsewhere. In Century, Fla., a town
of 2,600 on the Alabama border, members of the six-member police
force say the crack problem is too big for them to handle.
   ``It's like fighting Vietnam,'' said Officer Gary Johnson. ``It's

   A Detroit woman who settled a crack debt by allowing her
13-year-old daughter to be raped is sentenced to life in prison by
Wayne County Circuit Court Judge James J. Rashid.
   Although her crime normally would carry a 10- to 25-year
sentence, Rashid says Susan Barbier, 29, has ``sunk to an
intolerable level of humanity'' and shows no potential for reform.
   ``This case demonstrates tragically the far-reaching impact of
drugs on innocent people,'' the judge said.
   Although some people say drug abuse is a victimless crime, no
such argument is made about child abuse. Often, as on this day, they
go hand in hand.
   In Charlottesville, Va., social workers say they're seeing more
children placed in foster care because their parents abuse drugs.
   And in Richmond, Va., a 12-year-old girl is shot in the head and

   In the shadowy world of drug dealing, it helps to
know the lingo.
   ``It marks you as being a regular, instead of a cop,'' said a
police officer who worked the streets of the Bronx under cover, and
asked that his name not be used.
   Typically, a ``steerer'' takes the buyer-user to the dealer,
first ascertaining if the buyer is genuinely looking to score _ buy
drugs _ or is an undercover cop.
   Depending on the size of the operation, the steerer may be
supplemented by a holder, who safeguards the stash, the dealer's
drugs or money. This ensures that the dealer has a minimum amount of
drugs or money on his person if he is arrested by police or robbed
by a buyer.
   Holders are usually kids younger than 16 _ the penalties are
milder for juveniles.
   Another way buyers obtain drugs is through peephole operations. A
steerer takes a buyer to an apartment, where the dealer accepts the
buyer's money and pushes the drugs through an opening in the
apartment door.
   Following are some of the more common terms in the drug
vocabulary, according to Assistant Chief John J. Hill, head of the
New York City Narcotics Division:
   CRACK _ A purified, smokeable form of cocaine, usually mixed with
baking soda and cooked. Crack is commonly sold in chunks packaged in
vials less than an inch long, originally made to hold perfume
samples. The drug produces one to five minutes of euphoria marked by
hyperactivity and hyper-awareness, and long-term effects include
paranoia, said Dr. James Cocores of Fair Oaks Hospital, a
drug-treatment center in New Jersey.
   PANCAKES _ When the cocaine and baking soda are cooked to make
crack, usually in a frying pan, the finished product comes out
resembling a pale, thick pancake, which is then broken into small
chunks to be sold.
   NICKELS _ $5 worth of narcotics, sold in bags or, in the case of
crack, a three-quarter-inch vial.
   TRAYS _ $3 worth of narcotics, sold in bags or, in the case of
crack, a half-inch vial.
   JUMBOS _ A $10 vial of crack, usually sold in a one-inch vial.
   DECK _ A $10 bag of heroin.
   BUNDLE _ Ten decks equal one bundle of heroin, which sells for
about $100.
   STEM _ Glass pipes of various shapes, with a hole at one end for
inhaling crack cocaine, which is melted with a propane or butane
lighter outside the stem. Some users punch a hole in the side of a
juice bottle, where they insert a straw. Then they heat the crack in
a piece of foil placed over the bottle opening and inhale the fumes
through the straw.
   CRANK _ Amphetamines, also known as speed, a once-popular drug
showing signs of resurgence.
   ICE _ A smokeable form of amphetamines that originated in Asia
and spread to Hawaii and the West Coast. A few puffs of ice can
produce a high similar to that of crack but which lasts all day.
Cocores called ice ``big-time trouble'' and said continued use may
result in schizophrenia.
   SPEEDBALL _ A mixture of heroin and cocaine, usually injected as
a liquid. It brings an instantaneous euphoria like cocaine, without
the accompanying irritability, followed minutes later by the calmer
heroin high. The same mixture, but using crack cocaine and smoked
rather than injected, produces similar effects and is called
``parachute.''
   SPIKES _ Hypodermic needles used to inject heroin, cocaine or
speedballs.
   SKIN POPPERS _ Addicts who inject narcotics into a pinched fold
of skin, which gives them a slower high, because it takes a longer
time to reach the bloodstream and the brain.
   MAINLINERS _ Addicts who inject narcotics directly into their
veins, which produces a faster high because the drug goes directly
into the bloodstream and reaches the brain faster.
   DUST, ANGEL DUST _ An animal tranquilizer known as PCP, which is
usually used to lace marijuana. A bag of dust, which sells for about
$8, usually contains enough for about two small cigarettes.

   Matsushita Electric Industrial Co. Ltd., maker of

million transistors a month from Motorola Inc. starting in September.
   The announcement Thursday in Tokyo follows up on an agreement
between the companies announced earlier this year. It marks the

purchases of semiconductor devices custom-made by a U.S.-based

   The transistors will come from a Motorola factory in Malaysia, so
the sales won't help American workers or the U.S. trade balance, but
Motorola spokesman Jeffrey Gorin said it was a good sign for other
sales.
   ``We see a thawing of trade restrictions,'' Gorin said.
   Motorola's sales of transistors to Matsushita are scheduled to

Motorola said it hopes to sell the transistors to other Japanese
companies as well.
   Matsushita uses about 50 million transistors a month in making
video cassette recorders. That is what the Motorola devices will be

<HEAD>Banks May Have To Add To Loss Provision: Report</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Major U.S. banks likely will have to increase
their loan-loss provisions this year to protect themselves from
shaky foreign loans and an ``irreversible process of forgiveness''
initiated by the federal government, according to a leading Wall
Street credit rating firm.
   But the study by Moody's Investors Service warned that some banks
may be forced to restructure their operations as a result, and that
could mean future staff cuts or asset sales.
   Banks added more than $20 billion to their provisions for loan
losses in 1987, resulting in huge earnings declines or losses that
year for many. The credit ratings of many of the major money center
banks also were lowered.
   The Moody's report, released Wednesday, said more steps may be
needed because the Third World debt problem ``appears to be
unraveling further.''
   ``They (U.S. banks) are not all out of the woods yet,'' it said.
   The extent to which banks need to pad their loan-loss reserves
remains in dispute.
   Last spring, the General Accounting Office, the auditing arm of
Congress, said Third World countries were falling behind on $70
billion in debt repayments to U.S. banks and that American
regulators should make banks put up more reserves to protect
depositors against loan losses.
   But more recently, the U.S. comptroller of the currency
reportedly has proposed accounting changes that could discourage
banks from making large additions to their loan-loss reserves, in
order to avoid jeopardizing their quarterly dividend payments.
   Nonetheless, Moody's says, U.S. institutions still lag behind the
reserves taken by big European banks.
   Britain's central bank, for instance, recently required the four
big British banks to raise their loan-loss provisions so they would
amount to nearly half of their credits to troubled debtor nations,
up from around a third. The U.S. average is 30 percent.
   The Moody's report said the U.S. plan for reducing the $1.3
trillion Third World debt, known as the Brady plan, has begun ``an
irreversible process of forgiveness.'' The debt initiative places
more emphasis on having lender banks cut debt and interest payments
than on providing new loans.
   ``The U.S. government has shifted from one focused on protecting
the banks ... to one focused on protecting the political and
economic stability of the borrowers by encouraging debt reduction,''
the report said.
   Mexico in July became the first nation to reach a debt
restructuring agreement under the Brady plan, although a number of
its creditor banks reportedly have been slow to participate in the
plan.
   In that pact, banks were given the choice of reducing interest or
principle on the old debt or lending new money. At least one bank,
Citicorp, the nation's largest, said in a recent published report
that it would opt for making new loans.
   Moody's predicted the agreement with Mexico ``will provide the
country with very modest relief,'' and that further bank concessions
might be necessary ``unless officials sources step up their help.''

<HEAD>Abandons Plan to Sell Latin Routes, Foresees $370 Million Less in
Cash</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARCY GORDON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Eastern Airlines said it has abandoned an earlier
plan to sell its Latin American routes, which means the strikebound
carrier will have about $370 million less in cash by year end than
first projected.
   But Rolf Andresen, Eastern's vice president of finance, insisted
Thursday that the cash balance of nearly $400 million now expected
to be available for operations and paying debts is ``an amount
that's very adequate for our needs.''
   In an operating plan presented to creditors in April, Eastern
projected a year-end cash balance of $774 million, but Andresen said
that will be reduced because the Latin American routes won't be sold.
   Andresen reiterated Miami-based Eastern's pledge to pay all
creditors 100 percent with interest.
   ``We have a profitable and totally financially viable airline,''
he said in a telephone interview.
   Earlier Thursday, Eastern President Phil Bakes, Andresen and
other senior officials told creditors that the airline's operating
results are better than projected in its April plan and it has
dropped intentions to sell any South American routes.
   The officials made a two-hour presentation to a meeting of the
creditors committee in New York, following speculation in recent
days that Eastern faces a revenue shortfall of up to $500 million
and may have to revise its plan for emerging from Chapter 11
bankruptcy protection.
   The Wall Street Journal quoted sources earlier this week as
saying that parent Texas Air Corp. may underwrite some of Eastern's
operations because the negotiations with rival American Airlines on
the sale of the usually profitable Latin American routes had stalled.
   Texas Air Chairman Frank Lorenzo announced last Thursday that he
is considering selling a minority or controlling interest in
Houston-based Continental Airlines, Texas Air's other airline
subsidiary.
   Bakes and other senior officers told the creditors they
anticipate profits before taxes of $62 million next year and $140
million in 1991.
   Attorneys representing the creditors committee didn't return
phone calls Thursday seeking comment.
   A spokesman for the pilots union, one of three that has been on
strike against Eastern since March 4, called the airline's admission
of a shortfall ``a clear indication that the (bankruptcy)
reorganization plan is doomed to failure.''
   Referring to the projected cash balance of $400 million or so,
pilots union spokesman Ron Cole said, ``We believe that that's an
extremely optimistic assessment on Eastern's part.''
   Eastern, under bankruptcy protection since March 9, has been
trying to rebuild to about two-thirds its pre-strike size and has
hired new pilots, mechanics and flight attendants to replace the
strikers.
   Andresen declined to say why the decision not to sell the Latin
American routes was made.
   ``There are many factors,'' he said. ``It's not a one-issue
answer.''
   Eastern previously claimed it was doing so well rebuilding from
the crippling strike that it will be bigger than expected after the
reorganization, hinting that the Latin American routes might not be
sold.
   Dallas-based American, the chief bidder for the routes, recently
expressed frustration at the lack of progress in the negotiations.
``The frustration factor is very real _ it's really not clear that
they want to sell,'' American spokesman Ed Stewart said in
mid-August.
   Raymond Neidl, an analyst for Dillon, Read &amp; Co. Inc., suggested
Thursday that Texas Air wanted top dollar for the routes and
probably was holding out for a higher figure than anyone offered.
   ``Long term, I think they're in better shape not selling it,'' he
said. ``If there is a cash shortfall, then they could take some
other actions.''
   Andresen said Eastern has received ``good prices'' for the assets
it has sold in recent months, mainly aircraft and airport gates.

   About 18,000 1988-89 Merkur Scorpio cars,
marketed by Lincoln-Mercury dealers, were recalled by Ford Motor Co.
because of a problem with a throttle sensor.
   The problem may cause the sensor to stick, making the West
German-made vehicles equipped with 2.9-liter engines to idle roughly
or too fast. The engine also may hesitate when put into gear.
   Ford said Thursday it will notify owners by mail and tell them to
return the cars to Ford dealers, where the sensor will be replaced

   El Diario-La Prensa, the Gannett Co.
Spanish-language daily newspaper with a 60,000 circulation, has been
sold to a group of New York investors who include the paper's
publisher.
   The paper's predecessors have a history of more than 100 years of
continuous publication in New York. The paper was formed by a merger
of two Spanish-language papers in the late 1960s.
   Gannett, the nation's largest newspaper group, paid $9 million
for the paper in 1981, according to The New York Post, but the
Thursday sale price was not disclosed. The Post, quoting
unidentified sources, reported that the daily was sold for $25
million. Newsday reported that it was sold for $12 million to $14
million.
   Carlos Ramirez, the paper's publisher since 1984, will continue
in that capacity. Joining him on the new ownership management team
are Peter W. Davidson, a New York investment banker, and Rupert
Phillips, an owner and operator of several daily papers.

<TEXT>
   An index measuring the ability of the typical
American family to buy a home fell in July to the lowest level in
nearly four years, reflecting rising home prices.
   The National Association of Realtors said Thursday that a family
with a median income of $32,876, meaning half of the nation's
families earned more and half less, had only 98 percent of the
income necessary to buy a median-priced existing home costing
$96,400.
   That was the index's lowest level since September 1985 and marked
a decline from 99.1 percent in June when the index dipped below 100
percent for the first time since March 1986.
   The decline in affordability in July was blamed on a $3,000
increase in median home prices nationally. That more than offset the
effects of a decline in the average mortgage rate from 10.59 percent
to 10.39 percent. The association uses a composite rate reflecting
both fixed-rate and adjustable-rate mortgages.
   The changes increased the monthly principal and interest payment
on a median home by $10 to $699, which represents 25.5 percent of
the median family's income.
   By region, the median family in the Midwest had 129.2 percent of
the income needed to buy a median home; Southern families, 97.8
percent; families in the West, 73.5 percent, and residents of the
Northeast, 70.5 percent.
   ``Consumers' incomes have not kept pace with home prices in the
Northeast and West. First-time buyers simply don't make what it
takes to buy in those regions,'' said Ira Gribin, president of the
Realtors.

   The embattled founder of a stock-tip
telephone line says he's only ``helping the little guy'' by passing
on the research of major Wall Street firms along with his own market
recommendations.
   But state regulators say the fast-talking Barry K. Davis, barred
from the securities industry 18 years ago, may be giving investment
advice illegally.
   In a telephone interview Thursday, Davis fumed at the state
Bureau of Securities, a recent news story about his service and the
attitude of Wall Street firms.
   ``Let's say my background hasn't been wonderful. What has that
got to do with what I'm doing for the little guy in America today?''
he said.
   What he does for the little guy is help prepare a recorded phone
message changed thrice daily with a menu of rumors, tips, boasts
about past successes and the state of the economy.
   Subscribers to Traders &amp; Investors Alert of Fort Lee pay $695 a
year. For $1,750, subscribers receive a beeper so they can be
summoned to phone for special reports.
   It's not just the little guy on a subscriber list of 1,600 Davis
says he helps. He claims that a long list of brokers from major Wall
Street research firms call him, though he would not identify them.
   He says they provide some of the line's information from the
firms' research departments. Davis said he also talks to exchange
floor sources, goes to other advisory services and computer bases
and takes tips from people invited to call in.
   Brokers say they call to find out what other firms are saying,
what they may have missed from the newspapers or to crystalize the
day's information.
   ``Everything he says is not etched in stone, but it gives you an
idea of why things are moving and it gives you ideas of what to
do,'' said Howard Borenstein, a broker at the Chicago firm David
Noyes &amp; Co.
   Davis says the large Wall Street firms are not too happy with him
for cutting into their business.
   Morgan Stanley &amp; Co. spokesman Peter Roche said the service had
gotten hold of some daily announcements from the brokerage's
research department, and sales staff were reminded that sharing the
information was forbidden.
   ``The brokers at Goldman, Sachs don't need to call something like
that,'' said a spokesman for that firm. He also doubted how much
help Davis gets. ``There's no such thing as free research.''
   Nor is the state Bureau of Securities too happy.
   Bureau chief James McL. Smith said Davis may be operating as an
unlicensed investment adviser. The investigation is continuing.
   Bureau enforcement director Richard Barry said regulators
naturally gravitate to a once-banned industry member who returns to
it. He also referred to a potential for such a service to be used
for market manipulation.
   ``There's a lot of possibilities of investment advisers to take
unfair advantage of the market,'' he said.
   ``All I am is a research reporter,'' said Davis, who speaks so
quickly he is sometimes difficult to understand. His conversation is
laced with profanity and constantly interrupted by shouts at
co-workers.
   ``We claim under the freedom of the First Amendment that we are
doing electronic broadcasting,'' he said.
   When known as Barry Sutz in 1971, Davis was barred by the
Securities and Exchange Commission from the industry, for, he says,
under-capitalizing his brokerage firm. Until setting up the line in
September, Davis, 46, of Cresskill, said he traded for himself,
worked in the insurance business and sold franchises.
   He said he changed his name because he tired of Sutz. ``I also
had a nose job because my nose was too big. I change anything I want
to change. That's why I'm a great trader,'' he said.
   He called himself chief of research for TIA and the original
brains behind it, but declined to identify its principals or top
executives.
   He said he now welcomes scrutiny by the SEC and state regulators,
though when three of Smith's investigators paid a call in May,
police were called to eject them.
   ``Tell us what the law is and we'll pay attention to it,'' he
said. ``Does a checkered past have the same rights as anybody else
unless he's proven guilty?''
   He also criticized The Wall Street Journal for running what he
called an unflattering article two weeks ago. He said the
newspaper's owner, Dow Jones &amp; Co., which runs a financial news
service aimed at stockbrokers, wanted to ``wipe us out because we're
in competition.''
   Dow Jones spokesman Roger May had no comment.

<HEAD>Confidential SEC Memo Raises Boesky-Milken Questions</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A published report about convicted financier
Ivan F. Boesky and Michael Milken raises questions about whether
Boesky was trying to entrap the junk bond trader.
   The Washington Post reported Thursday that Boesky, now a key
government informant, allegedly met with Milken, former head of
Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc.'s high-yield bond department, in July
1986, before Wall Street's insider trading scandal mushroomed.
Milken now faces charges in the probe.
   According to the Post, a confidential Securities and Exchange
Commission memorandum indicated the two met ``to discuss how to
`conceal the true nature' of a $5.3 million payment from Boesky to
Drexel.''
   The government contends the $5.3 million payment was part of a
secret stock trading arrangement between the two high-powered Wall
Street figures. Drexel claims the March 1986 payment was for
consulting services it provided Boesky.
   ``Boesky and Milken met in July 1986 to discuss how they could
substantiate the `consulting services' gloss which they had used to
conceal the true nature of the $5.3 million payment,'' the SEC memo
said, according to the Post.
   Prosecutors have never revealed when Boesky began cooperating
with authorities but the date could be significant for Milken's
defense against securities fraud and racketeering charges.
   If Boesky was cooperating in July 1986, the SEC memo might
indicate that he was trying to gather evidence on Milken for the
government, an issue that Milken defd raise at his trial, set to
start next year.
   Several Wall figures implicated by Boesky, including invest and
West Coast stock broker Boyd Jefferies, have pleaded guiltd in turn
given information on others accused o The SEC asked Post editors on
Wednesday not to publish confidermation contained in the May 1988
memo, claiming the thought processes of commission attorneys'' now
suing Milkr securities law violations.
   John H. Sturc,in the SEC's enforcement division, which prepared
the confidentmemo in May 1988, was said to be furious that ihe
newsaper.
   However, Sturc declined all comment on the maturday, as did other
SEC officials.
   ``Any sby Michael Milken is totally untrue,'' Milken attorney
Martin Fmenbaum said through a spokeswoman in New York.g leaks by
the government are deplorable and are designed to deike Milken his
right to a fair trial,'' Flumenbaum's statement said.
   The SEC's two-page letter to the Post, which said the memo's
disclosure was unauthorized, added that publication could ``injure,
outside of the judicial processes, the reputation of persons who are
either entit day in court or who are not alleged by the commission
to have violated the federal securities laws and possibly to impede
thession's ability to litigate.''
   But Post Managing Editor Leor. said, ``We feel that what we
published is neody's rights.''
   In its editions Friday, the Post again quo confidential SEC memo
_ the newspaper did not st to Milken had told government
investigators he ``fabricated'' trading losses in transactions
Boesky.
   The SEC memo was quoted as saying that Milken aide Charles
Thurnher admitted he fabricated a loss figure for a Boesky
investment in Unocal Corp. common stock because he believed that
Boesky's bookkeeper had inflated Boesky's losses from another
transaction.
   Both of the transactions were part of billion payment from Boesky
to Milken that the SEC alleges was part of a secret stock-trading
arrangement between the two men.
   Boesky, once a leading speculator in the sf potential takeover
targets, stunned the financial community in November 1986 when he
agreed to pay a then-record $100 million to settle SEC civil insider
trading charges.
   He also struck a plea bargain with federal prosecutors in ris
cooperation and is serving a three-year prison sentence for
conspiracy to lie to the SEC.
   nd defense lawyers will not say when Boesky began cooperating, t
documents at the time he was sentenced in 198egan after he was
implicated in an insider trading scheme by Dennis Levine.
   Levine, a former Drexel investt banker, was hit with civil
insider trading charges in May 1986 and pleaded guilty to four
felony counts and settled civil charges a month later.
   Drexel has agreed to pay a record $650 million in fines and
restitution and to plead guilty to six felony counts in order to
settle both civil and criminal charges. Milken, who also was named
in the SEC civil charges against Drexel, maintains his innocence and
has refused tNY-09-01-89 0130EDT

<HEAD>Back-to-School Sales Benefit Apparel Retailers; Mass Merchandisers
Slump</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOYCE M. ROSENBERG</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Clothing merchants and department stores benefited from
back-to-school shopping during August, but mass merchandisers
suffered as consumers generally remained hesitant about big
purchases.
   ``We saw good sales in the apparel department, but many of the
other departments show a cautious consumer,'' Walter Loeb, an
analyst with Morgan Stanley &amp; Co. Inc., said Thursday after the
nation's biggest retailers announced their August sales results.
   Consumers generally are in a strong financial position and are
confident right now, but their spending ``is drifting sideways,''
agreed Jeffrey Edelman, an analyst with Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc.
   Consumers have cut back on purchases of what are called
discretionary items, as opposed to necessities such as food, because
of rising mortgage payments and other credit costs.
   August sales are important because the month marks the beginning
of the retailers' most critical season. Shopping generally
accelerates in mid-August as families prepare for the new school
year and then continues to build through the holiday season, when
stores earn about half their annual profits.
   Economists track retail sales because the figures are a component
consumer spending, which in turn accounts for about two-thirds of
U.S. economic activity.
   Consumer caution has hurt big general storeowners such as the
nation's largest retailer, Sears, Roebuck and Co. Sears said its
August sales were up 2.3 percent overall, but sales at stores open
at least a year _ known as same-store or comparable-store sales _
fell 1.1 percent.
   Retailers and analysts consider same-store sales a more accurate
reflection of a company's performance than totals that include sales
at recently opened stores.
   Another mass merchandiser, K mart Corp., also had a disappointing
August, with overall sales up 4.8 percent and same-store sales up
1.5 percent.
   Wal-Mart Stores Inc., the discount chain that consistently has
outperformed its competitors, said its overall sales jumped 26
percent in August, while comparable-store results rose 11 percent.
   Positive results at stores that specialize in apparel, such as
J.C. Penney Co. Inc., were due largely to back-to-school shopping.
Penney, where sales have steadily improved in recent months
following a prolonged slump, reported a 17.1 percent surge in
overall August sales, while same-store sales increased 15.7 percent.
   Limited Inc., the nation's biggest specialty apparel retailer,
reported an 11 percent increase in overall August sales and a 7
percent jump in same-store sales.
   Department stores also had a good month.May Department Stores Co.
said its overall sales rose 9.6 last month and same-store sales grew
6.5 percent.
   Jeffrey Feiner, an analyst with Merrill Lynch &amp; Co., said the
improvement at the apparel and department stores was better than he
had expected and the trend bodes well for retailers' third-quarter
profits.
   Edelman, meanwhile, cautioned that some of the rosier sales
reports looked stronger than they actually were because the figures
were compared with weak results of August 1988. A year ago, the
fashion industry was just beginning to emerge from a severe drought.
   The figures reported Thursday were from major general merand
apparel retailers. The government's monthly retail sales report is
more comprehensive, incl dealers, supermarkets, restaurants and
elsewhere.
   Other rg August sales included:
   _Dayton Hudson Cor a 5.1 increase in same-store results.
   _Montgomery Ward &amp; Co., which reported a 1 percent overall sales
gain, and a 0.8 percent comparable-store sales increase.
   _Woolworth Corp., which said its sales rose 13.3 percent overall
and 7.8 on a same-asis.

   Share prices were firming at midday in London on
moderate volume as last-minute buying at the end of the current
trading account squeezed a number of the market's biggest stocks.
   Traders described the market as bullish but nervous. An
encouraging response by Wall Street to the U.S. August unemployment
figures due out today could lift the London market higher, they
said. However, worries about a battery of mid-year earnings results
due over the next two weeks will make any upward move tentative.
   Around midday, the Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100 share index
was up 10.0 points, or 0.4 percent, at 2,398.9, its highest level of
the session. The key index opened the day up 4.2 points and has
improved steadily since.
   The narrower FT-30 share index was up 10.4 points at 1,988.0.
Volume through midday was a moderate 265.9 million shares.

<HEAD>Chicago Merc Fines 4 For Pre-Arranged Trades During Crash</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Chicago Mercantile Exchange, whose
self-policing practices are under federal scrutiny, has suspended
four traders and fined them a total of $450,000 for alleged
violations during the 1987 stock market crash.
   Two of the traders were suspended for two years and ordered to
return $44,500 each to customers who were allegedly cheated.
   The traders are accused of making pre-arranged transactions of
stock-index futures in violation of exchange rules.
   They allegedly cheated their customers by executing their orders
privately for their own enrichment, instead of in the open auction
of the Merc's Standard &amp; Poor's 500 stock-index futures trading pit.
   None of the traders has admitted or denied the allegations.
   The stiff penalties suggest that the Merc, the world's
second-largest futures market, is taking a tougher stand against
wrongdoing in the face of intense scrutiny of the industry's
self-policing.
   Federal prosecutors on Aug. 2 announced indictments for alleged
trading fraud against 45 traders and one clerk at the Merc and the
Chicago Board of Trade. The next day, Leo Melamed, chairman of the
Merc's executive committee, promised to ``instill the fear of God''
in any traders who think of stealing.
   Most complaints against traders are settled before they get to a
full-blown hearing, and the case against the four traders was headed
in that direction until the federal investigation became known.
   Afterward, the Merc broadened its probe to include more trades
and brought added charges against the two main targets.
   Traders Albert V. Furman III and Patrick J. Shannon Jr. were
suspended from exchange membership for two years and ordered to make
restitution of $44,500 each.
   Furman was fined $125,000 by the exchange. In addition to
pre-arranged trading, the exchange found Furman guilty of failing to
fully answer all questions during an investigation of his case.
   Furman previously had been fined $125,000, suspended two months
and ordered to pay $127,500 restitution, in connection with other
alleged improper stock-index futures trades made during the week of
Oct. 19, 1987.
   Shannon was fined $225,000 in addition to his suspension.
   Peter Shannon, Patrick's brother, was fined $50,000 and suspended
from exchange membership for two months.
   Sidney L. Rabin was also fined $50,000 and suspended from
exchange membership for two months.
   Stock-index futures are contracts for future delivery of groups
of stocks. Futures traders can use stock-index futures to hedge
against losses on actual stock market investments or simply to
speculate on the prices of the underlying stocks.

<HEAD>Former Law Partner Sentenced to Five Years For Insider Trading</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CLIFF EDWARDS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A former partner in a prominent Chicago law firm
has been sentenced to five years in prison, believed to be the
longest term ever issued for illegal insider stock trading.
   U.S. District Judge Marvin Aspen on Thursday also ordered Alfred
Elliott, 45, a former law partner in Schiff, Hardin &amp; Waite, to pay
the government $332,000 in fines and $353,000 in profits he made
from trading stocks based on inside information he obtained over a
two-year period.
   ``You are a brilliant, talented man who could have accomplished
anything you wanted in the practice of law,'' Aspin told Elliott
before the sentencing. ``But to accumulate money and stockpile it
the way you did, that kind of greed boggles the mind.''
   Elliott was one of two lawyers at the firm who represented
companies on imminent corporate mergers and acquisitions. He was
indicted last July and convicted later on 70 counts of using
confidential information to buy and sell stock. He reportedly made
more than $600,000 between March 1984 and April 1986.
   Elliott said he knew he had made a mistake and that he had tried
to right the wrongs made against the law firm, which he left in 1986
after his actions became known.
   ``I realize what I did was wrong. It was crazy, nuts,'' Elliott
said. ``I am a person of integrity and I really am sorry this
happened.''
   Elliott's attorney, James Streicker, also had argued for leniency
in the sentencing, and compared his client's case to that of
financier Ivan F. Boesky, The Wall Street speculator is serving a
three-year prison sentence for conspiracy to lie to the Securities
and Exchange Commission, a sentence he received after striking a
plea bargain with federal prosecutors in return for his cooperation.
   Boesky had agreed in 1986 to pay $100 million to settle insider
trading charges filed by the SEC.
   For his part, Elliott paid more than $500,000 in damages and
repaid profits after insider-trading allegations in a 1986 civil
case filed in federal court by the SEC.
   But Aspen rejected the comparison of Elliott to Boesky, and
sentenced Elliott to five years, which the U.S. attorney's office
believes to be the stiffest sentence ever imposed in such a case.

   The government said today its chief economic
forecasting gauge rose in July for the first time in three months,
further chasing away fears of a possible economic downturn.
   The Commerce Department said its Index of Leading Economic
Indicators rose a modest 0.2 percent in July after registering no
gain in June and plunging by 1.3 percent in May, the biggest drop
since late 1987 following the stock market crash.
   The small July increase in the index was in line with
expectations of many analysts, who believe growth should continue at
a moderate pace for the rest of the year.
   That view is a sharp reversal of the prevalent opinion just a
month ago when weakness in the leading index and a variety of other
government statistics had raised fears that the economy was about to
topple into a recession.
   But since that time, the government has basically rewritten
economic history, issuing various revisions showing that everything
from employment growth to consumer spending were stronger than
originally believed.
   ``The image we had of an economy on the verge of a recession has
been changed by these revisions,'' said Bruce Steinberg, senior
economist at the New York brokerage firm of Merrill Lynch.
   Economists are not forecasting that the country is on the verge
of boom times, but they are now much more confident that the longest
peacetime recovery in U.S. history, currently in its seventh year,
should be able to continue for some time to come.
   The leading index is a compilation of 11 forward-pointing
business statistics designed to forecast economic performance three
to nine months down the road.
   In July, five of the economic statistics showed signs of
increasing strength, five flashed weak signals and one was unchanged.
   The biggest source of strength was a pickup in growth in the
nation's money supply. The Federal Reserve, which had been
restraining monetary growth in an effort to fight inflationary
pressures, has now switched course and over the past two months has
been loosening credit conditions.
   Economists believe this change in Fed policy has already provided
momentum for the economy in such key sectors as housing construction.
   Other sources of strength in July were a jump in consumer
confidence, a rise in stock prices, an increase in plant and
equipment orders and an increase in the backlog of unfilled
manufacturing orders.
   Five indicators held back the overall increase. The biggest
negative factor was a decline in raw materials prices. While this
indicated lessening inflationary pressures, it is read as a negative
for the index because it can also signal lower demand. Other
negative factors were a drop in orders for consumer goods, an
increase in weekly unemployment claims, a fall in building permits
and changes in business delivery times.
   One indicator, the length of the work week, showed no change from
June to July
   The various changes left the index at 144.0 percent of its 1982
base of 100.
   The Bush administration is projecting that the overall economy
will grow at an annual rate of 2.9 percent this year. That growth
target can be achieved even if the economy slows in the second half
of the year from the 3.2 percent annual rate of first six months of
1989.
   Many analysts are looking for a modest slowing of growth, but
nothing close to a recession.
   David Berson said he expected the rate of growth would slow
slightly in the July-September quarter primarily because auto
companies are working to reduce a high inventory of unsold cars. But
he said he expected the year would end on a strong note once
inventories are trimmed.

   The nation's unemployment rate remained at 5.2
percent in August as the resurgent economy created more than 200,000
jobs, the government reported today.
   The Labor Department's official figure for non-farm payroll
expansion last month was 110,000 jobs. But strikes reduced the job
totals by about 108,000 _ meaning that without the walkouts the
new-job total would have been some 218,000.
   The government also revised its July job growth figure upward to
184,000 from 169,000, a sign the economy continues to expand at a
pace that will keep it out of recession in the short term.
   The unemployment report is the first comprehensive look at
economic performance in August, and the numbers bolster recent
predictions that the record-long expansion seems in no danger of
ending.
   In another good-news report issued this morning, the Commerce
Department id the Index of Leading Economic Indicators, the chief
economic forecasting gauge rose in July for the first time in three
months. The July gain of 0.2 percent followed no change in June and
a plunge of 1.3 percent in May.
   The reports came on the heels of a revised report on the gross
national product that said the economy grew at an annual rate of 2.7
percent in the second quarter of 1989, up from the 1.7 percent rate
in a preliminary report.
   The government said the number of Americans who were looking for
work but could not find jobs fell by a modest 76,000 last month to
6.42 million. More than 117.5 million Americans had jobs, an
increase of 138,000 from July.
   The official job-growth numbers were skewed by several
strike-related developments. About 130,000 telephone workers were
out on strike, while about 20,000 coal miners returned to work after
walkouts.
   Strikes affect the data because the job totals are taken from a
government survey of businesses, and strikers are not counted as
being on payrolls. But strikes do not affect the unemployment rate
because that statistic is taken from a separate household survey in
which strikers are considered to still have jobs.
   The new job growth was predominantly in the service-producing
sector, which added nearly 70,000 jobs. That number would have been
higher in a normal month because the telephone workers fall into the
service portion of the economy.
   Manufacturing and construction posted modest gains in August of
11,000 and 8,000 jobs, respectively.
   The manufacturing total showed slight job declines in some areas,
including furniture and lumber products, but a gain of 25,000 in
auto manufacturing, a sign that carmakers called back some of the
workers laid off because of sluggish sales.
   Wage data in the report should prove encouraging to inflation
watchers, although perhaps discouraging to workers.
   The government said average hourly earnings were essentially
unchanged last month _ actually falling by a tiny fraction _ after
rising 0.7 percent from June to July. For the year ending in August
average hourly wages were up 3.9 percent, the government said, well
below the pace of consumer inflation.
   The report also showed a slight reduction in factory activity,
with the average manufacturing work week dropping 0.1 hour to 40.9
hours. Average factory overtime dropped by the same amount to 3.9
hours a week.
   The report adds to recent strong economic data showing that the
economy continues to grow, and at a somewhat stronger pace since the
Federal Reserce eased its hold on credit after a March 1988-1989
tightening designed to keep inflation in check.
   ``We are looking at an economy that is stronger than people had
thought,'' Merrill Lynch analyst Bruce Steinberg said in advance of
the report. ``One report after another has shown more strength.''
   There were no dramatic shifts in the unemployment rate among
demographic groups last month, although the rates for blacks overall
and black men in particular rose.
   Here are the August unemployment rates for the groups listed in
the Labor Department's report, compared with July:
   _Adult white men, 3.8 percent, unchanged from July.
   _Adult white women, 4.1 percent, down from 4.3 percent.
   _White teen-agers, 12.7 percent, down from 13.4 percent.
   _Blacks, 11.1 percent, up from 10.9 percent.
   _Adult black men, 9.8 percent, up from 9.3 percent.
   _Adult black women, 9.4 percent, down from 9.9 percent.
   _Black teen-agers, 33.4 percent, up from 33.1 percent.
   _Hispanics, 9.0 percent, unchanged.
   In a separate calculation that includes military personnel
stationed in the United States, the Labor Department said the
unemployment rate was 5.1 percent, down from July's 5.2 percent.

<HEAD>Air Canada Orders $1 Billion In Boeing Aircraft</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SEATTLE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Boeing Co. picked up its second big commercial
airplane order in about a month with Air Canada ordering nine
extended-range 767-300s valued at about $936 million.
   In addition to the nine firm orders, Air Canada took options on
another nine 767-300ERs, Boeing said Thursday.
   Boeing Commercial Airplanes said the firm orders, including spare
parts, would be worth nearly $1.9 billion, if all options are
exercised.
   Late in July, Texas Air Corp. placed a $2.8 billion order with
Boeing, the world's leading airplane maker, to upgrade its
Continental and Eastern airline units.
   Aloha Airlines also ordered four 737-300s worth about $125
million, Boeing confirmed. Aloha also has options for four more
737-300s.
   Pierre J. Jeanniot, Air Canada's president and chief executive
officer, said it chose the long-range widebody jet as its principal
plane for long-range domestic and international service.
   The new jets will replace 14 Lockheed L-1011s and allow for fleet
expansion. Air Canada already has 21 smaller 767-200s, including 13
with extended-range capability.
   The two-engine, extended-range jets can carry 210 passengers
6,200 nautical miles. Air Canada will receive the first of the new
planes in 1993 and plans to use it on North Atlantic routes,
including Toronto-Frankfurt and Montreal-London.
   Boeing said the planes, equpped with Pratt &amp; Whtiney engines,
will burn about 30 percent less fuel than the three-engine L-1011s
they will replace and cost about 25 percent less to operate.
   Aloha is to receive the first of its newly ordered planes in
November 1992. Aloha, a major inter-island carrier in Hawaii, has 13
twin-engine 737s, including two new 737-300s.
   The 737-300, powered by CFM International engines, can carry 128
passengers about 3,000 nautical miles.
   So far this year, Boeing has received orders for 692 jetliners
worth a total $36.4 billion, an industry record.

<HEAD>Bankruptcy Trustee Does Inventory</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WITHAMSVILLE, Ohio (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Four oil paintings, a grand piano, a
Jacuzzi and vintage wine and champagne are among the items at Marvin
Warner's horse farm that will be sold to pay off creditors of his
failed Home State Bank.
   Ronald Mowrey spent two days this week taking inventory of
property at Warner's lush, 600-acre farm just east of Cincinnati in
Clermont County. Mowrey is to oversee sale of the farm and contents,
under supervision of the U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Jacksonville, Fla.
   The creditors sued Warner after the March 1985 collapse of
Cincinnati-based Home State. Warner, 70, was convicted on Ohio
felony charges after the collapse, but is appealing the convictions.
   Home State's collapse triggered a statewide thrift crisis.
   Mowrey said he believes he will have Warner's farm and household
furnishings assessed and ready for auction or private sale _
whichever will bring in the most money _ within 30 to 40 days.
   The property also includes antique tables and chairs, crystal
wine glasses, exercise equipment, an antique hat stand, leather
chairs and a fur rug, along with less exotic washers and dryers and
vacuum cleaners.
   There are also 30 to 40 head of cattle and a bull on the farm, he
said.
   ``There is a real air of sadness there,'' Mowrey said Wednesday.
``There are pictures of the family and the children on the tables.
There are pictures of them growing up, doing things as a family. It
has a real ring of sadness.''
   Mowrey, a lawyer and former FBI agent from Jacksonville, took
control of Warner's assets after U.S. Bankruptcy Judge George
Proctor changed Warner's proceedings last month from a Chapter 11 to
a Chapter 7 action, under which assets are sold to satisfy
creditors' claims.
   Warner's creditors have claimed they are owed more than $3
billion.
   The farm, called Warnerton, will be sold separately. Mowrey said
one buyer has offered $4 million for about 400 of the 600 acres. If
appraisers think this is fair to the creditors, the offer will be
accepted, Mowrey said.
   The dozens of thoroughbred horses that once grazed the pastures
are gone. Creditors' lawyers say most of the horses were apparently
transferred to Warner's son, Marvin Warner Jr., who owns a horse
farm in Lexington, Ky.
   Mowrey said he will make a similar inventory and assessment of
Warner's newer 400-acre horse farm in Ocala, Fla., next week. Under
Florida's homestead law, a person in bankruptcy proceedings cannot
be deprived of his home, even to pay creditors. A debtor is allowed
up to 160 acres outside a city as a ``home'' exemption, unless the
court decrees otherwise.
   Warner's creditors contend he improperly spent money which should
have gone to his creditors to buy, stock and furnish his Ocala
property. They are asking that the court disallow the farm as an
exemption.
   Warner has asked Proctor to change his proceedings to a Chapter
12 action, which would exempt Warner from forced liquidation by
labeling him a farmer. A Chapter 12 action is designed to protect
farmers from foreclosure.
   Mowrey said the decision will be up to the judge, but said his
examination has convinced him Warner probably would not qualify as a
farmer.
   Mowrey said he estimates Warner has assets of between $3 million
to $40 million, far short of what creditors are seeking. Warner, in
court papers filed in the early 1980s, declared his worth at between
$85 million and $100 million.

<DATELINE>MINNEAPOLIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Grand Metropolitan PLC has agreed to sell
operations in three South American countries owned by its Pillsbury
Co. subsidiary, the company said.
   Cargill Inc. will buy Pillsbury's flour mill and pasta plant in
Venezuela. Separate agreements were reached with local investors to
sell Pillsbury's two consumer foods plants in Guatemala and its 10
percent share in a flour mill in El Salvador.
   Neither side would discuss the terms of the transaction or size
of the operations, except to say there were 400 employees in the
Venezuelan plants and 200 employees in the Guatemalan plants.
   Since acquiring Minneapolis-based Pillsbury early this year,
London-based Grand Met has been selling off Pillsbury subsidiaries
that don't fit its long-term strategies. The divestitures also help
reduce its large acquisition debts.
   ``It may have been so small they found it not worth keeping or
developing,'' said L. Craig Carver, a securities analyst with Dain
Bosworth.
   Since Venezuela has been plagued by such problems as the collapse
in the price of oil, a staggering national debt, uncontrolled
inflation, a weak currency and social unrest, its troubles made
Pillsbury's operations there ``unpredictable from a financial
standpoint,'' said Marlene Johnson, a public relations official with
Pillsbury.
   ``But, essentially, we decided they didn't fit our long-term
stragegy,'' Johnson said.
   Cargill, the privately held grain giant based in Wayzata west of
Minneapolis, already has 15 flour mills in the U.S. and three in
Venezuela.
   ``We feel that that country is taking some sound steps to correct
some international problems. We have long-term confidence,'' said
Alan Holbert, a public relations official with Cargill.

   Nordstrom Inc., which operates nearly two
dozen upscale department stores throughout California, has agreed to
pay a $200,000 fine and penalties to settle a false advertising
lawsuit.
   The Seattle-based chain, which didn't admit any wrongdoing, also
agreed Thursday to a six-year injunction that bars it from falsely
representing special purchase merchandise as clothing on sale that
is regularly available.
   A lawsuit filed by the District Attorney's Consumer Protection
Division alleged that seven of the stores in Southern California
used ``fictitious original or regular price'' labels for a
comparison to sale prices, but that the items actually were never
available at the higher prices.
   ``When the district attorney's office brought the problems to our
attention, we took steps immediately to make sure it doesn't happen
again,'' Nordstrom spokeswoman Chris Breidenbaugh said. ``In the
future, we will be careful to be as specific as we can.'' The
charges stemmed from sales ads from last October and December.

<HEAD>IRS Proposing Deal To Settle Dispute Over Back Taxes</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DALLAS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Internal Revenue Service has proposed settling
Nelson Bunker and Carolyn Hunt's back tax bill for about $200
million _ less than one-third of the $700 million the government
originally sought.
   Grover Hartt III, attorney representing the IRS in the Hunts'
bankruptcy case, said Thursday he had proposed the $200 million
settlement to his superiors in Washington, D.C.
   U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Harold Abramson Thursday gave attorneys for
Bunker and his wife 30 days to hammer out details of the settlement
with the IRS.
   The agreement in principle is a breakthrough in the nearly
year-old bankruptcy negotiations of Bunker Hunt, whose financial
troubles stem in part from a scheme by Hunt and his brother William
Herbert Hunt to control the silver market in 1979 and 1980.
   Hunt and his wife filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection last
September to defend themselves from a string of lawsuits and claims
for back taxes, interest and penalties arising in part from the
silver scheme.
   ``We are proposing to settle because we feel it is in the
government's best interest economically,'' Hartt said. ``The
rationale is it is economically beneficial to get 80 percent of $100
today than it is to get 100 percent of $50 a year from now.''
   Russell L. Munsch, attorney for Bunker Hunt, declined to discuss
terms of the deal, saying ``that is still in negotiations.''
   The decision to settle the case comes one week after testimony in
the $300 million tax trial involving Bunker and his brothers,
William Herbert and Lamar, was completed in Washington, D.C.
   U.S. Tax Court Judge Jules G. Korner III isn't expected to rule
in that case before February 1990.
   If the IRS settles Bunker and Herbert's tax liability before a
judgment is rendered in the 1982 tax trial, it could mean that the
tax trial was a futile effort, said Michael Henke, attorney who
represented both brothers.
   Henke asked that the tax court ruling be expedited. He said the
case has cost the Hunts about $3.5 million in attorneys fees and
expenses.
   Under an order issued by the bankruptcy judge Thursday, creditors
will be allowed to file competing reorganization plans in Bunker's
bankruptcy case beginning Oct. 1. Until then, creditors have to base
their negotiations for debt repayment on the Hunts' reorganization
plan.
   The settlement being discussed between Bunker and the IRS would
be similar to that already proposed in the bankruptcy of Herbert and
his wife, Nancy. The IRS says the couple owes $300 million in back
taxes.
   The IRS contends the two brothers owe the agency a combined total
of $1 billion in back taxes but has agreed to settle Herbert's case
for about $150 million and Bunker's for about $200 million.
   In Bunker's case, the IRS would receive 80 percent of a
liquidating trust or about $110 million. The agency would also get a
$90 million non-dischargeable to be paid out of gifts, inheritances
and future income after Bunker and his wife emerge from bankruptcy.
The couple would be allowed to keep their home and certain personal
belongings, Hartt said.

   The stock market got off to a weak start today as
traders weighed the implications of new economic reports.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials dipped by 1.52 to
2,735.75 by 10 a.m. on Wall Street.
   Little distance separated advancing and declining issues on the
New York Stock Exchange as 421 stocks gained in price, 453 declined
and 554 were unchanged.
   The NYSE composite index of all its listed common stocks edged
down 0.14 to 195.13.
   Volume on the Big Board totaled 18.92 million shares after the
first 30 minutes of trading.
   Before the market opened, the government issued a report on the
job market that indicated the economy is growing at a moderate rate,
making the threat of recession seem more remote. The Labor
Department said the nation's unemployment rate remained at 5.2
percent in August. Non-farm payrolls expanded by 110,000, a total
that was reduced by about 108,000 due to strikes.
   A Commerce Department report pointed to a possible buildup in
momentum after months of sluggish economic activity earlier this
year. The Index of Leading Economic Indicators rose a modest 0.2
percent in July after registering no gain in June and plunging by
1.3 percent in May, the biggest drop since late 1987 following the
stock market crash.
   The early leader on the Big Board's list of actively traded
shares was Niagara Mohawk Power, which was up [ at 12}.
   Union Carbide was the second most heavily traded share in the
early going and lost [ to 31.
   UAL, parent of United Airlines, jumped 5 to 284} on word that the
airline's pilots union is preparing to make a bid for the carrier.
   On Thursday, the Dow Jones average of 30 industrials ended at its
second-highest close ever after trading near its opening level for
much of a fairly sluggish session. The industrial average rose 9.12
to 2,737.27, pushed up by a late round of buying.
   Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones by nearly 6 to 5 in
nationwide trading of NYSE-listed stocks, with 801 up, 672 down and
510 unchanged.
   Volume on the floor of the Big Board eased to 143.42 million
shares from 174.35 million Wednesday.
   The NYSE's composite index rose 0.36 to 195.27.

   Aztec tribesmen were such fanatics about
their game of Patolli they would gamble anything from corn fields to
families in order to win this ancient version of ``you bet your
life.''
   Three Albuquerque men who have fashioned an update of the game on
an 18-inch by 18-inch board are wagering mere money _ about $60,000
so far _ in their gamble that it will be a big seller.
   ``The odds are about one in 1,000 that board games will be a
financial success,'' says Mike Kimball, a graphics artist at the
Albuquerque Journal, who with friends Phil White and Jim Franchell
designed a modern-day Patolli, which means ``game of the mat'' and
sells for $29.95 in specialty game stores.
   Kimball says his father, Richard Kimball, a writer in Prescott,
Ariz., was doing research for an article when he came across a
reference to Patolli about three years ago.
   ``He suggested to us that it might be interesting to play, but he
could find no records of rules or anything, just accounts by
Spaniards,'' Mike Kimball says.
   ``We decided to come up with some rules we felt maintained the
spirit of the thing,'' he says. ``We kept refining it until we had a
real playable game and we decided it would be a good thing to put on
the market.''
   Modern-day Patolli players compete to be the first to maneuver
four game pieces around the padded vinyl playing mat to a center
pyramid. They must avoid capture while wagering precious stones. The
winner gets a pot of golden tiger eyes, the most valued stones of
all.
   The players must know which stones to move, when to block and for
how long, when to bargain with a captive, what kind of bets to make.
But the strategy can change with a roll of the five wooden dice,
bare on one side, one to five dots on the flip side.
   The playing stones are polished red jasper, black obsidian,
turquoise howlite and white quartz, a throwback to the pebbles that
Aztec players used.
   Betting cards outline payoffs on four different bets _ Cortez'
Boast, Montezuma's Fate, Omen of the Days and So Speak the Gods.
   Aztecs would ``wager just about anything. They were so into
gambling, they'd wager jewels, capes, they'd wager their farms,
their kids, their wives, and occasionally themselves,'' Kimball says.
   ``They'd put up their lives for a certain amount of money. If
they paid the guy back, there would be no problem,'' he says. ``If
they couldn't pay the guy back within a certain amount of time,
they'd become a slave to that person...or they would be sacrificed.
But a slave is a pretty valuable thing and you wouldn't just waste
him.''
   The playing mat developed by Kimball and partners is rimmed on
each side with 20 Aztec day signs such as the alligator, deer, dog,
vulture, wind, house, jaguar or death.
   The mat has a series of squares shaped like a cross on which
playing pieces are moved.
   The cross shape was used by the Aztecs on their mats and
represented to them the universe and the four seasons of life _
birth and spring in the east, adulthood and summer in the south,
autumn and old age in the west and winter and death in the north.
   Kimball says although he and his partners did not know the exact
rules of the Aztec game, they were intrigued by its gambling aspects.
   ``We played other games like Parchisi and Go, but this
incorporates gambling, and it became a lot more exciting,'' Kimball
says. ``Once we refined the whole idea of the game, we decided it
would make a good game to mass-produce.''
   The partners had their mats printed and contacted other suppliers
for game components. The first run of 2,000 games was produced in
1988 and most are sold.
   Worldwide Games, a mail-order company in Colchester, Conn., has
ordered 240 Patollis to be featured in its 1990 catalogue, Kimball
says. Other specialty stores have ordered samples.
   Individual orders for Patolli have come from Spokane, Wash., to
West Peabody, Mass.; from Japan to England to Canada. Some European
game merchants also have expressed intense interest, Kimball says.
   ``According to them, this is exactly what European yuppies are
looking for.''

<HEAD>Crop Futures Mixed As Frost Fears Recede</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Grain and soybean futures prices were narrowly
mixed in early trading today on the Chicago Board of Trade, with
some of the selling reflecting an easing of frost fears in corn and
soybean country.
   Soybean futures had run up sharply Thursday after at least one
private weather forecasting firm predicted patchy frost in some
parts of the Midwest late next week. But many other private
meteorological firms issued frost-free forecasts this morning.
   Overnight rainfall in much of the Corn Belt added to the selling
pressure on ideas that the moisture may improve soybean yields.
   And an increase in farmer selling of corn was an additional drag
on the corn market.
   Wheat futures were mostly higher in moderate trading, partly in
reaction to news of an increase in export sales of wheat last week.
   In early trading, wheat was { cent lower to 2{ cents higher with
the contract for delivery in September at $3.88{ a bushel; corn was
} cent to 1{ cents lower with September at $2.33} a bushel; oats
were { cent to 1 cent lower with September at $1.34{ a bushel;
soybeans were \ cent to 2\ cents lower with September at $5.87} a
bushel.
   Livestock and meat futures were mixed in early trading on the
Chicago Mercantile Exchange.
   Live cattle were .13 cent lower to .08 cent higher with October
at 73.62 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .02 cent to .15 cent
lower with September at 82.57 cents a pound; live hogs were .02 cent
to .35 cent lower with October at 40.35 cents a pound; frozen pork
bellies were unchanged to .45 cent higher with February at 44.30
cents a pound.
   Cattle futures settled mixed on Thursday while pork futures
advanced.

<HEAD>Eastern Airlines Creditors May Not Be Burnt By Bankruptcy</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BART ZIEGLER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Six months after Eastern Airlines filed for
bankruptcy protection, analysts are optimistic that bondholders and
other creditors of the troubled carrier won't get burnt.
   ``Eastern's creditors are coming out better than they probably
would have expected at the start of the bankruptcy,'' said Philip
Baggaley, who follows the airline for Standard &amp; Poor's Corp., a
credit rating agency.
   Eastern appears well on its way toward selling assets as proposed
under its reorganization plan, added analyst Robert Decker of Duff &amp;
Phelps Inc., a Chicago investment research firm.
   ``I give Eastern a pretty good chance of being able to meet their
object that they've been stating, that they'll be able to pay off
their debt holders in full,'' Decker said this past week.
   Eastern owes about $3.5 billion to creditors, including
bondholders, banks, ticketholders, fuel suppliers, and equipment
trust certificate holders.
   A crippling strike March 4 virtually grounded the Texas Air Corp.
division, and five days later it filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy
reorganization. Since then it gradually has been rebuilding its
flight schedule.
   It also has been selling assets to raise cash, such as its
Northeast shuttle service, which went to developer Donald Trump for
$365 million.
   Eastern said last week that its rebuilding plan is going better
than expected and that the carrier may not sell the full $1.8
billion in assets envisioned under its original rebuilding plan.
Among the assets no longer up for sale are its valuable South
American routes.
   However, since it has not sold as many assets, Eastern said it
may not have the cash to make as many prepayments on debt as it
expected.
   Among Eastern's debts are $39 million in industrial revenue
bonds, which financed construction of airport facilities used by
Eastern; about $200 million in subordinated debentures; and more
than $700 million in equipment trust certificates, which financed
aircraft purchases. All these securities are publicly traded.
   Recently, holders of $63 million in Eastern equipment trust
certificates were paid in full when the certificates' issuer, GE
Capital Corp., decided to redeem them early. Now GE Capital will
receive payments from Eastern for use of the jets, S&amp;P said.
   S&amp;P's Baggaley said the early redemption of the certificates,
which was allowed because of Eastern's bankruptcy filing,
``indicates that GE Capital feels that they're going to continue to
get their rental payments. It's at a high lease rate and GE decided
they wanted it all for themselves.''
   Raymond Neidl, an analyst at the New York brokerage Dillon, Read
&amp; Co. Inc., said Eastern has been making interest payments on its
remaining equipment trust certificates, but the creditors have no
recourse if it stops.
   These certificates, unlike the GE Capital ones, do not allow the
certificate holders to repossess the planes should Eastern stop
making payments.
   Owners of Eastern's subordinated debt haven't fared as well as
the certificate holders. Eastern has halted interest payments on
these convertible securities.
   But all is not gloomy here. The price of these debentures, which
dropped when the carrier filed for bankruptcy, rebounded sharply as
it became more likely that Eastern would pay off its creditors in
full, Neidl said.
   ``Nobody's been really hurt so far,'' he said. ``The prices of
all issues have moved up very strongly.''
   He said investors holding Eastern debt certificates may win no
matter how the airline's saga ends.
   If Eastern's reorganization goes as planned and it emerges as a
profitable carrier, the price of the debt issues will continue to
rise. Should Eastern's plans go awry, creditors need not worry
because the carrier's assets would fetch enough at auction to cover
its debts.
   Neidl also was optimistic about Eastern's future. But, he said,
recent comments by Texas Air Chairman Frank Lorenzo that he may sell
all or part of Continental Airlines, the holding company's other
airline unit, complicate the picture.
   Should he sell a partial stake, the cash could be funneled to
Eastern to help it pay off debt. But if Continental is sold
outright, Eastern may not survive as an independent carrier, and it
could be put up for sale or liquidated, the analyst said.
   ``I don't think Eastern could make it on its own,'' he said.

<HEAD>Commission Says United States Faces Workforce Crisis</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A ``work force crisis'' will cripple the United
States' ability to compete internationally without immediate steps
to improve the education, training and efficiency of U.S. workers,
says a report submitted today to Labor Secretary Elizabeth Dole.
   At a news conference where Mrs. Dole officially received the
report, the secretary said the problems in the work force require
the attention of business, labor, government and private citizens.
   ``The skills of our work force have not kept pace with the more
complex jobs of today,'' Mrs. Dole said. ``This skills gap must be
bridged if our remarkable economic expansion is to continue and if
we are to succeed in the ever-more-competitive global marketplace.''
   The report was produced by the Commission on Workforce Quality
and Labor Market Efficiency, created in 1988 by Mrs. Dole's
predecessor, Ann McLaughlin.
   Commission chairman Richard F. Schubert, who was also at the news
conference at the State of Illinois Center, warned that the United
States is already facing a lack of skilled workers and an excess of
unskilled workers _ as predicted in a 1987 report prepared for the
Labor Department.
   ``When we started the commission's work last summer, I think most
of us had hoped to identify two or three major initiatives that
would produce immediate, broad-gauge improvements in work force
quality,'' said Schubert. ``Since that time, however, we have come
to the realization that there are no simple, easy solutions.''
   The commission's 44 recommendations cover three broad fronts:
improving education for young people; providing lifetime education
and training for workers; and improving productivity and efficiency
by providing more help to working parents and developing a system to
better match workers with jobs.
   Schubert, a former president of Bethlehem Steel and the American
Red Cross, said some of the recommendations would cost the federal
government more money _ including increased spending for child-care
and job training programs and tax breaks to individuals and
businesses that invest in education and training.
   ``We are aware of the other urgent issues calling for financial
support,'' Schubert said. But, he added ``I believe we are going to
have to make very substantial increases in the investments we make
in our people and in our work force.''

<HEAD>Union Strikes Freight Car Plant</HEAD>
<DATELINE>JOHNSTOWN, Pa. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The first steel strike in this
manufacturing city since 1959 began Friday when about 800 United
Steelworkers members walked off the job against the freight car
division of Bethlehem Steel Corp.
   The division's 11 p.m. shift walked off the job about 12:01 a.m.
on Friday and was cheered by about 100 workers standing outside the
plant.
   USW Local 2635 voted 785-29 Wednesday to oppose the company's
two-year contract offer and go on strike. The office and technical
workers, USW Local 9157, voted 15-2 against the contract.
   Bethlehem Steel called its last offer fair in view of current
business conditions.
   The union's negotiating committee said the company's offer of 50
cents per hour in wage increases would have left compensation below
1982 levels.
   ``I think we're going to be out for a long time,'' Andrew
``Lefty'' Palm, director of USW's District 15, said late Thursday.
   ``When they lost money, we saved (them) and now they're making
money and don't want to share it,'' Palm said.
   The union made concessions in 1983 to keep the then-struggling
plant operating. It accepted a wage and benefit freeze in 1986 and
agreed to extend the freeze through a wage-reopener vote in 1988.
   The division, which had slumped to fewer than 10 employees in the
early 1980s, has increased employment dramatically since 1987,
Bethlehem Steel spokesman Gary Graham said.
   Employment now is at about 1,000, including salaried workers.
   Graham acknowledged that the division turned a profit in 1988
from making railroad freight cars, but said it had lost a total $30
million in the five previous years. It has orders booked into next
year.

   The U.S. dollar rose in busy European trading
Friday, aided by the release of bullish U.S. unemployment figures.
   Gold prices fell under pressure from the dollar's gains.
   Dealers said the healthy unemployment data confirmed the market's
expectations that the U.S. Federal Reserve is unlikely to lower
interest rates.
   By showing that the U.S. economy is growing at a moderate pace,
the figures mean ``we're not likely to see interest rate cuts in the
near-term,'' said Marek Stefanowicz, senior dealer at Nomura Bank
International PLC.
   Some traders said they were surprised by the dollar's move. They
said they had expected more profit-taking as U.S. dealers begin to
close their positions before the Labor Day weekend.
   In Tokyo, where trading ends before Europe's business day begins,
the dollar rose 1.17 yen to a closing 145.45 yen from Thursday's
144.28. Later, in London, it was quoted at a lower rate of 145.23
yen.
   In London, the dollar gained against the British pound. It cost
$1.5565 to buy one pound, cheaper than $1.5735 late Thursday.
   Other late dollar rates in Europe, compared with late Thursday:
1.9785 West German marks, up from 1.9580; 1.7085 Swiss francs, up
from 1.6880; 2.2200 Dutch guilders, up from 2.2090; 6.6700 French
francs, up from 6.6035; 1.1817 Canadian dollars, up from 1.1758; and
1,413.50 Italian lire, up from 1,406.90.
   Gold fell in London to a late bid price of $358.50 a troy ounce,
compared with late Thursday's $359.95. In Zurich, gold was lower,
closing at a bid $358.40 an ounce, compared with 360.00 late
Thursday.
   Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold fell 76 cents to close at a bid
$359.28 an ounce.
   Silver prices fell in London to a late bid price of $5.06 a troy
ounce from Thursday's $5.09.

<DATELINE>NICOSIA, Cyprus (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Iran is demanding $1.5 billion in
compensation from Japan's Mitsui conglomerate for its abandonment of
a petrochemical plant in southern Iran, the official Islamic
Republic News Agency reported Friday.
   The news agency, monitored in Nicosia, quoted Ahmad Rahgozar,
head of the National Petrochemical Co., as telling the daily
newspaper Kayhan that Japan had offered a ``friendly settlement,''
and that he hoped the dispute would be solved ``shortly.''
   There was no immediate comment from a Mitsui delegation that has
been in Iran since Sunday in an effort to settle the problem.
   Iranian officials have warned that the issue might jeopardize
Japanese business interests in Iran as the country launches a
multibillion-dollar reconstruction program after a cease-fire that
halted the eight-year gulf war with Iraq last year.
   Iran claimed earlier this month that the giant Japanese
conglomerate had offered to pay $1.25 billion after pulling out from
the project, but that the figure was rejected as too low.
   Mitsui and Japan's International Trade Ministry denied the
report. A Mitsui official said a compensation package was being
discussed but that the final figure would be well below the sum
mentioned.
   The plant was 85 percent completed before the gulf war broke out
in September 1980. The Japanese halted work on it October 1984 after
the plant was badly damaged in Iraqi air raids.

<HEAD>China Sets Up Commission to Handle Huge Industrial Debts</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BEIJING (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   China has set up a special commission to tackle
the ``increasingly serious problem'' of factories failing to pay
debts and taxes, the official China Daily said Friday.
   The report said the team, to be headed by Finance Minister Wang
Bingqian, will seek to assist enterprises in repaying debts that
have risen to 108.5 billion yuan, or about $29.3 billion at current
exchange rates.
   Wang told the first meeting of the commission that defaults in
the state-run business sector have risen rapidly this year,
disrupting the economy and interfering with the state budget.
   Li Guixian, governor of the People's Bank of China, was quoted by
the daily as saying defaults had intensified the acute shortage of
funds and reduced factories' working capital.
   It said the government's austerity policies, which have reduced
construction projects and cut back on available credit, and the
refusal of some firms to pay taxes, are reasons for the default
problem.
   Li said that in the coming months banks will provide loans to
companies with sound economic records to help clear their debts.
   The daily said that as of the end of June China's industrial and
commercial banks had already provided loans to clear 8 billion yuan.
   Bank experts say many companies with large stockpiles of raw
materials and products must also strive to move their stocks in
order to pay their debts, the daily said.
   The report said the Daqing Oil and Chemical Factory, one of
China's largest enterprises, had been seriously affected by defaults
from subsidiary companies. It said that by the end of July 1,100
companies were in arrears by 300 million yuan to the factory.
   Wang, in a gloomy report to the National People's Congress,
China's parliament, on Thursday said government subsidies for
inefficient state-owned industries have ballooned in recent years.
The government now pays an estimated 40 billion yuan a year to
subsidize money-losing enterprises.

   The stock market remained higher this afternoon
but trading slowed ahead of the long Labor Day weekend.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials was up 15.58 to 2,752.85
by 3 p.m. on Wall Street.
   Advancing issues maintained a wide lead over declining ones on
the New York Stock Exchange with 857 up, 524 down and 556 unchanged.
   The NYSE composite index of all its listed common stocks went up
by 0.93 to 196.20.
   Volume on the Big Board totaled 115.19 million shares with one
hour left to go.
   Stock prices benefited from strength in the bond market and
futures-related program buying.
   A collection of economic reports were open to varying
interpretations but, on balance, the markets reacted favorably to
the figures.
   Bonds sported big gains after an abbreviated pre-holiday session,
helped by a bullish response to the August survey from the nation's
purchasing managers. The National Association of Purchasing
Management said its monthly poll showed weakness in the industrial
side of the economy.
   A report on the job market that suggested the economy is growing
at a moderate rate, making the threat of recession seem more remote.
The Labor Department said the nation's unemployment rate remained at
5.2 percent in August. Non-farm payrolls expanded by 110,000, a
total that was reduced by about 108,000 due to strikes.
   A Commerce Department report pointed to a rebound in momentum
after months of sluggish economic activity earlier this year. The
Index of Leading Economic Indicators rose a modest 0.2 percent in
July after registering no gain in June and plunging by 1.3 percent
in May, the biggest drop since late 1987 following the stock market
crash.

<TEXT>
   Fujisawa Pharmaceutical Co. announced Friday it is
acquiring Lyphomed Inc. for about $670 million, the first major
acquisition of a U.S. drug company by a Japanese pharmaceutical
maker.
   ``We believe the merger of Lyphomed and our U.S. operations will
further strengthen our position in the U.S. and will allow Fujisawa
to compete more effectively in world markets,'' Dr. Tomokichiro
Fujisawa, president of the Osaka, Japan-based company, said in a
statement released by the two companies.
   Fujisawa has owned nearly 30 percent of Lyphomed _ about 9
million of the company's 29.9 million common shares _ since October
1986, according to Lyphomed spokeswoman Melissa Marsden.
   The $31.87-a-share purchase price exceeds Fujisawa's $31-a-share
offer last week for Lyphomed, based in the Chicago suburb of
Rosemont. The final figure represents an all-time high for Lyphomed
shares, which are traded over the counter.
   Ms. Marsden put the purchase price at approximately $670 million,
which includes conversion of the company's preferred stock.
   The merger should be completed April 1, the companies said.
   Dr. John N. Kapoor, Lyphomed's chairman, said the new merged
organization has the ``potential to be a worldwide leader.''
   ``We eagerly anticipate building on our past achievements and
contributing Lyphomed's many talents as part of Fujisawa's team,''
Kapoor said in the statement.
   Kapoor owns about 14 percent of Lyphomed's stock, a stake he had
previously agreed to sell to Fujisawa once Lyphomed's board approved
a buyout.
   ``This is the first major acquisition ever of a U.S. drug company
by a Japanese drug company,'' said John Boettiger, first vice
president of Rotan-Mosle Inc., a Houston securities firm. ``I think
it's a good deal for both companies.''
   ``Fujisawa sells pills primarily, and Lyphomed is the largest
provider of intravenous drugs to hospitals,'' Boettiger said.
   ``The buzz word in health care is combination therapy, and this
allows either company to provide both intravenous and oral
medicine.''
   Fujisawa is the largest research-based drug company in Japan,
Boettiger said. Its sales for the fiscal year ended March 1 were
$1.46 billion.
   The deal will give Fujisawa access to Lyphomed's U.S. sales
network, which already markets about 400 products to more than 95
percent of U.S. hospitals, he said.
   Lyphomed enjoyed explosive growth in the mid-1980s, particularly
after it became the only company federally licensed to make
pentamidine, a drug used to treat AIDS-related pneumonia.
   Overall sales soared from $4 million in 1981 to $172 million in
1987.
   But the company ran into hard times last year after the U.S. Food
and Drug Administration uncovered quality-control problems at
several Lyphomed plants. Lyphomed lost $21.1 million in 1988.
   Lyphomed has since shuffled top management and posted a profit of
$105,000 on revenues of $71.7 million in the first six months of
1989. Boettiger said that Lyphomed's future prospects looked good,
particularly since the company received FDA approval last month to
open its new plant in Puerto Rico.

   When banking assistant Barbara DeVahl
takes her 4-year-old daughter Erin to public kindergarten starting
this week, she'll go to work a few feet away.
   Ms. DeVahl's employer, First Bank System, has donated space for
Downtown Kindergarten, part of St. Paul's municipal school system.
It's a combination of school and day care aimed at recruiting
parents with young children.
   ``The school district needs space, the corporation needs
employees who hang around _ it really helps with turnover _ and the
youngsters really need a quality education and parental involvement
in that education,'' said Barbara Roy, a First Bank assistant vice
president.
   Only a few employers nationwide have embraced this degree of
responsibility in the education and care of their workers' young
children. But more businesses are looking at such arrangements,
largely because of the changing workforce and in particular the
growing number of working mothers.
   Fifty-seven percent of all women with children under 6 years old
are in the workforce, double the percentage in 1970, U.S. Census
Bureau figures show. A Department of Labor study last year showed
the fastest rate of increase among working mothers are those with
toddlers under age 2.
   Ms. DeVahl said one of the biggest advantages to the First Bank
arrangement is that she won't have to worry about transporting her
daughter from kindergarten to day care during the middle of the
workday.
   That's one problem First Bank wanted to eliminate for employees
when it donated the space to the school district. There are other
benefits too.
   ``I'm really looking forward to having lunch with my daughter,''
Mrs. DeVahl said.
   Since her husband works downtown, the family can commute
together. ``I think it will give us a little bit more relaxed
time,'' she said.
   Bank officials are aggressively promoting the Downtown
Kindergarten, as it will be known until parents and students rename
it, as a recruitment tool.
   ``We also knew that kindergarten is a particularly tricky year
for making child-care arrangements because of the children being in
school part day and then needing some other kind of a program,'' Roy
said.
   School Superintendent David Bennett, who has been a supporter of
workplace schools, agreed.
   ``For children, it's very disruptive at a young age to have to
adjust to family life and school life and day care. You begin to
wonder who the stable and predictable adult in your life is,''
Bennett said.
   Once kindergarten is completed every day, children will remain at
the site for day care, which will cost $75 a week for 4-year-olds
and $70 a week for 5-year-olds. Public aid defrays the cost for
low-income families.
   Roy was instrumental in establishing the combined kindergarten
and day-care program. In 1986 and 1987, she headed a local task
force that worked to expand child-care availability in St. Paul.
   Children of First Bank's employees will have priority in
enrollment, but at least two children of non-bank employees have
enrolled. Spaces were offered to other downtown employees to help
fill the class.
   St. Paul public school officials, who have modeled the program
after a similar one in Dade County, Fla., have sent letters to 10
large local corporations encouraging them to consider donating space
for kindergartens and expanded day-care for their own employees'
children, Bennett said.
   ``I think they really are going to put their very best energy
into having this work out because the spotlight is on it,'' Roy said.
   Just west of Minneapolis, Wayzata public school officials are
trying to persuade Trammel Crow Co., a commercial real estate
developer, to set aside space in another office tower planned at the
Carlson Center for a similar program. In a recent survey of tenants,
100 employees said they would be interested in enrolling their
children in a similar program, said James Brandl, the community
education director for Wayzata schools.
   Will Hoeg, a Trammel Crow executive, said he's interested in the
idea as a tenant recruitment tool. ``It's just one of those things
that makes you feel good about doing. We're potentially helping out
our future generation,'' Hoeg said.
   Thomas Schultz, project director for early childhood education at
the National Association of State Boards of Education in Alexandria,
Va., said he's unsure whether the idea will catch on that quickly.
   But he endorsed First Bank program. ``It seems to me any
arrangement that provides a service that offers continuity to the
kids in terms of the day experience they have...is great as an
example of creativity.''

   Soybean futures gave up most of the previous
session's gains Friday on the Chicago Board of Trade, retreating
along with corn futures prices as fears of an early freeze in the

   Wheat futures prices rose substantially, though, partly on
expectations for increased export sales.
   Fears of a freeze late next week in patches of the Midwest were
greatly diminished Friday as most forecasters discounted the
possibility. Among them was USDA Chief Meteorologist Morton
Strommen, who said he saw no evidence of weather patterns that might
produce an early freeze.
   At the close, wheat futures were { cent lower to 6 cents higher

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Dow Jones &amp; Co. said Friday it is preparing to
put an over-the-counter market stock into its transportation average
because a wave of mergers and buyouts is making it impossible to
find enough big transport companies on the New York Stock Exchange.
   It would be the first time any of the three Dow Jones averages _
industrials, utilities and transportations _ has included a stock
that was not traded on the New York Stock Exchange.
   UAL Corp. could be the next NYSE stock to disappear from the Dow
Jones average of 20 transportation stocks. UAL, parent of United
Airlines, has received a $6.19 billion bid from investor Marvin
Davis. A joint bid of more than $6.5 billion from United's pilots
union, management, and British Airways also reportedly was being
formulated.
   The over-the-counter market is a network of dealers that trades
issues by computer over phone lines without any central exchange.
Over-the-counter companies generally are smaller than those listed
on the New York Stock Exchange and many are regarded as more
speculative because they have not had the opportunity to establish
records as seasoned businesses.
   Preparations for adding an over-the-counter stock have been going
on at least since January, but have gained urgency with the dealings
over UAL.
   ``We're not going to do this until we have to do it, but we
wanted to make sure people were prepared for it,'' said Dan Hinson,
an assistant managing editor at Dow Jones' Wall Street Journal. ``In
a week, United could be gone.''
   Yellow Freight System Inc. and Roadway Services Inc. are among
the over-the-counter candidates to replace the next NYSE stock that
drops out, said Charles Stabler, an editorial consultant to Dow
Jones.
   The industry body that oversees over-the-counter trading welcomed
Dow Jones' decision.
   ``This is just another example and testimonial to the stocks that
trade in NASDAQ,'' said John T. Wall, executive vice president for
marketing and market services at the Washington-based National
Association of Securities Dealers.
   At the New York Stock Exchange, spokeswoman Sharon Gamsin said
that while mergers and acquisitions have taken away some stocks, the
NYSE's total listings were at a record level.
   Seven stocks have dropped out of the Dow Jones average of 20
transportation stocks and been replaced since the end of 1986.
   TWA dropped out in October 1988 when its chairman and owner, Carl
Icahn, took the company private. Most recently NWA, parent of
Northwest Airlines, dropped out in July when it was bought by a
group led by investor Alfred Checchi.
   The transportation average traces its origins to 1884, when Dow
Jones &amp; Co. began occasionally reporting on an index of 11
representative stocks, most of which were railroad companies. In
1897 the company began separate indexes for railroad and industrial
stocks.
   The railroad average was renamed the transportation average in
1970 to reflect its changing composition. It now consists mainly of
airlines, trucking companies and a handful of railroads.

<TEXT>
   The industrial side of the U.S. economy continued
to weaken during August and a growth index fell to its lowest level
since the economic expansion began in late 1982, the nation's
corporate purchasing managers said Friday.
   But many economists said they weren't concerned about a possible
recession, noting that inflation remains under control and other
economic indicators point to continued growth.
   The government said Friday that August unemployment held steady
at 5.2 percent with the creation of more than 200,000 new non-farm
jobs excluding the effects of phone strikes.
   In other reports, the government said construction spending
inched up 0.02 percentage point in July and the Index of Leading
Economic Indicators rose a modest 0.2 percentage point in July.
   The Purchasing Managers' Index, a widely watched barometer of the
economy's direction, fell to 45.2 percent last month from 46 percent
in July. That was the lowest reading since December 1982, the month
after the beginning of the current economic expansion.
   A reading below 50 percent indicates that the manufacturing
sector of the economy is in decline while a reading above 50 percent
indicates growth, according to the National Association of
Purchasing Management.
   Robert J. Bretz, chairman of the association's Business Survey
Committee, said all major indicators of the manufacturing sector
pointed down in August.
   A measure of production growth fell for the second consecutive
month to its lowest level in more than 6{ years. New orders also
declined, but at a lesser rate than in July. Inventories fell for an
eighth consecutive month as purchasers adjusted to slowing
production and new orders.
   ``The bright spot on the economic horizon continues to be
relatively strong exports and sharply decreasing inflation,'' said
Bretz, who also is director of materials management at Pitney Bowes
Inc.
   Of the 67 percent of the purchasing executives exporting, 23
percent reported better export orders, up from 22 percent who said
so in July, according to the survey.
   It also said prices fell in August, the third consecutive monthly
decline, with purchasing executives finding 29 out of 38 selected
commodities lower in price, up from 21 in July.
   ``All this says the economy is growing but it's slowing,'' said
Robert A. Brusca, chief financial economist for Nikko Securities Co.
International Inc. ``The weakness in the manufacturing sector is
very pronounced.''
   Brusca said the Federal Reserve may soon be forced to ease its
credit policies, by lowering interest rates a bit, to keep the
economy moving. That sentiment helped push bond prices sharply
higher Friday, which in turn gave the stock market a boost.
   But while some economists expressed concern about the economy's
future, others painted a less gloomy picture.
   ``We may have a pocket of weakness in the manufacturing sector
but we've seen recent indications that show the consumer is alive
and well and spending money,'' said Elizabeth G. Reiners, a money
market economist for Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. ``And that's keeping
the economy going.''
   She noted the government recently reported that new home sales
surged 14.4 percent in July _ the fastest pace in three years _
because interest rates had been dropping in recent weeks.
   Here are some details from the August purchasing managers report:
   _The index of manufacturing production fell to 46.5 percent, down
from 48.3 percent in July. That was the lowest since a reading of 44
percent in December 1982.
   _New orders declined for the third consecutive month. However,
the new orders index stood at 45.1 percent, up slightly from 44.8
percent in July.
   _Inventories fell for an eighth straight month to 43.3 percent
from 45.5 percent in July.
   _The pace of vendor deliveries quickened, with the index at 44.9
percent vs. 46.9 percent, even though slightly more commodities were
in short supply.
   _An employment index stood at 44.7 percent, up slightly from 44.4
percent in July.
   The monthly report is based on replies to questions asked of
purchasing executives in more than 250 industrial companies. The
index is a composite of five separate indicators, including new
orders, production, vendor deliveries, inventories and employment.

   Stock prices pushed higher today but trading
slowed ahead of the long Labor Day weekend.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials posted another all-time
high.
   The stock market benefited from strength in the bond market and
futures-related program buying with traders engaging in maneuvers
aimed at profiting from the differences between prices of
stock-index futures and actual stocks.
   A collection of economic reports out today were open to varying
interpretations but, on balance, the markets reacted favorably to
the figures.
   Bonds sported big gains after an abbreviated pre-holiday session,
helped by a bullish response to the August survey from the nation's
purchasing managers. The National Association of Purchasing
Management said its monthly poll showed lingering weakness in the
industrial side of the economy.
   The bond market initially sold off in reaction to a report on the
job market that suggested the economy is growing at a moderate rate,
making the threat of recession seem more remote and the chances of
interest rate declines less likely.
   The Labor Department said the nation's unemployment rate remained
at 5.2 percent in August. Non-farm payrolls expanded by 110,000, a
total that was reduced by about 108,000 due to strikes.
   A separate Commerce Department report pointed to a possible
rebound in momentum after months of sluggish economic activity
earlier this year. The Index of Leading Economic Indicators rose a
modest 0.2 percent in July after registering no gain in June and
plunging by 1.3 percent in May, the biggest drop since late 1987
following the stock market crash.
   Takeover speculation continued to fuel buying. Airline stocks
made a comeback from Thursday's selloff. UAL, parent of United
Airlines, jumped 7{ to 287\ on word that the airline's pilots union
is preparing to make a bid for the carrier. AMR, owner of American,
rose 1} to 89}.

   The president of Cie. Industrielle said Friday he
does not plan to fend of an unwelcome takeover bid for the insurance
holding company with a formal counter-offer.
   But Jean-Marc Vernes indicated he will continue the fight against
Cie. Financiere de Suez, a financial holding company whose $3.6
billion bid is the largest ever on the French market.
   In an interview on French radio, Vernes said he had two main
reasons for deciding against a formal counterbid _ the cost, and a
concern that overt hostility could jeopardize approval for Cie.
Industrielle's purchase of the insurance group Colonia Versicherung
AG.
   Under French stock exchange rules, a counter-offer would have to
be at least 5 percent more than the Suez offer.
   Vernes also alleged that Suez had offered him $2,424 a share for
his Cie. Industrielle interests before it launched its takeover bid
in the market for $1,970 a share.
   Suez said later it ``challenges'' Vernes' allegations. In a brief
statement, it said the price offered to Vernes in private
discussions was ``coherent'' with the proposed $1,970 tender, given
technical details of the payment. It did not elaborate.
   Friday's announcement by Vernes leaves the road clear for Suez to
pursue its takeover bid.
   The Cie. Industrielle president left his defensive strategy
unclear. He said, however, that he has asked for an investigation
into heavy orders for the group's stock that blocked efforts to
trade on the Bourse last week.
   Vernes said he was ready to negotiate a solution with Suez,
although he stipulated that he is prepared to do so only on the
condition that he retains control of Cie. Industrielle.
   Suez already has 18.47 percent of Cie. Industrielle and 32
percent of Groupe Victoire. Cie. Industrielle, in turn, holds 40
percent of Groupe Victoire. The tender offer by Suez is scheduled to
expire on Sept. 18.

   The dollar gained against all major foreign
currencies Friday following the release of positive economic data,
including a report showing strength in the nation's job market
during August.
   Gold prices rose domestically after weakening overseas.
   On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold bullion for current
delivery closed at $360.60 a troy ounce, up 70 cents from late
Thursday. Republic National Bank of New York quoted a late bid for
gold of $359.25 an ounce, up 65 cents.
   The dollar's ascent began after the government reported that the
August unemployment rate held steady at 5.2 percent with the
creation of more than 200,000 new non-farm jobs excluding the
effects of phone strikes.
   The government also reported that construction spending inched up
0.02 percentage point in July and the Index of Leading Economic
Indicators rose a modest 0.2 percentage point that month.
   ``The numbers were very positive in terms of showing economic
strength,'' said Robert Ryan, a senior trader with Irving Trust Co.,
``and that indicates that (interest) rates will remain firm.''
   Marek Stefanowicz, a senior dealer at Nomura Bank International
PLC in London, agreed, ``We're not likely to see interest rate cuts
in the near-term.''
   Higher rates support the dollar because they make
dollar-denominated securities, such as stocks and bonds, more
attractive to foreigners, thereby increasing the need to convert
foreign currencies into dollars.
   In Tokyo, where trading ends before Europe's business day begins,
the dollar rose 1.17 yen to a closing 145.45 yen from Thursday's
144.28. It was quoted at 145.23 yen in London, and at 145.60 yen in
New York, up from 145.065. The dollar gained against the British
pound. It cost $1.5565 to buy one pound in London, cheaper than
$1.5735 late Thursday. Sterling fetched $1.55775 in New York, down
from $1.5650.
   Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late Thursday,
included: 1.9790 West German marks, up from 1.9675; 1.70725 Swiss
francs, up from 1.7005; 6.6665 French francs, up from 6.6290; 1.1815
Canadian dollars, up from 1.17935; and 1,417.00 Italian lire, up
from 1,411.00.
   Late dollar rates in Europe, compared with Thursday: 1.9785 West
German marks, up from 1.9580; 1.7085 Swiss francs, up from 1.6880;
2.2200 Dutch guilders, up from 2.2090; 6.6700 French francs, up from
6.6035; 1.1817 Canadian dollars, up from 1.1758; and 1,413.50
Italian lire, up from 1,406.90.
   Gold fell in London to a late bid price of $358.50 an ounce from
Thursday's $359.95. In Zurich, gold closed at $358.40 an ounce, down
from $360.00.
   Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold fell 76 cents to close at a bid
$359.28 an ounce.
   Silver prices were mixed. On New York's Comex, silver bullion for
current delivery settled at $5.076 a troy ounce, up from $5.045.
Silver fell in London to $5.06 an ounce from $5.09.

   Sterling Motor Cars on Thursday boosted rebates to
$5,000 on three of the four 1989 car models it sells in the United
States.
   The new rebates apply to the Sterling 827SL, 827SLi and 827SL
Limited Edition automobiles. The rebate for the fourth car in the
Sterling lineup, the 827S, will be $3,000.
   Prices for Sterling's 1989 models were $23,550 for the SL,
$29,975 for the SL and SLi, and $30,450 for the Limited Edition. The
company will introduce its 1990 cars in November.
   ``We have suffered as a small entrant in the highly competitive
luxury car segment and feel this rebate program will provide the
impetus for the consumer to choose Sterling over one of the more
familiar marques,'' Sterling President Graham Morris said in a news
release.
   Sterling, produced by Austin Rover Group Ltd. of England, has
faced trouble with U.S. sales. Year-to-date sales for this year,
through July 31, were 32 percent behind the 5,653 cars through that
date last year.

<HEAD>Bond Prices Rise on Purchasing Managers' Report</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Bond prices surged higher Friday, boosted by a
report that suggested a possible slowdown in manufacturing.
   Release of the report by the National Association of Purchasing
Management helped wipe out losses the market suffered earlier in the
session in response to a stronger-than-expected employment report.
   The Treasury's benchmark 30-year bond rose 13-16 point, or about
$8.13 per $1,000 face amount, while its yield slumped to 8.12
percent from 8.19 percent late Thursday.
   Trading was light and ended early ahead of the three-day Labor
Day weekend.
   Bond prices fell in early trading after the Labor Department
reported that the unemployment rate remained at 5.2 percent in
August and that a resurgent economy had created more than 200,000
new jobs.
   The prospect of a vigorous economy dashed traders' hopes that the
Federal Reserve would relax credit, allowing interest rates to fall
and bond prices to rise.
   But prices roared back after release of the Purchasing Managers'
Index, which is compiled from a survey of purchasing executives in
industrial companies. The index fell to 45.2 percent in August from
46 percent in July, reaching its lowest level since December 1982.
   A reading below 50 percent indicates the manufacturing sector of
the economy is in decline while a reading above 50 percent indicates
growth.
   The report ``suggested that both manufacturing activity and
prices at the producer level are going to be quite weak going
ahead,'' said Ward McCarthy, a managing director of Stone &amp; McCarthy
Research Associates Inc.
   But the market's reaction to the purchasing managers survey
confounded some analysts. William Sullivan, director of money market
research for Dean Witter Reynolds Inc., said traders should have
paid more attention to the unemployment data.
   The purchasing managers report ``is an extremely narrow snapshot
of the manufacturing sector in contrast to employment, which is a
broad-based picture of the U.S. economy,'' including the service,
financial and other industries, Sullivan said.
   ``The bottom line of the employment report is that the Fed policy
is on hold,'' he said.
   However, Robert Brusca, chief economist with Nikko Securities Co.
International Inc., found weakness in the unemployment report,
noting among other things that it showed a decline in worker hours.
   Brusca also said there was evidence of a slowing economy in other
recent statistics, including Thursday's government report that
factory orders fell 1.7 percent in July.
   ``I think the reaction (to the unemployment report) today in some
sense was on target,'' he said.
   In the secondary market for Treasury bonds, prices of short-term
government issues picked up [ point to \ point, intermediate
maturities were up between 13-32 point and | point and longer-term
issues rose 21-32 point, according to Telerate Inc., a financial
information service.
   The movement of a point is equivalent to a change of $10 in the
price of a bond with a $1,000 face value.
   The Shearson Lehman Hutton Daily Treasury Bond Index, which
measures price movements on all outstanding Treasury issues with
maturities of a year or longer, rose 5.21 to 1,177.88.
   Corporate issues were lower. Moody's Investment Grade Corporate
Bond Index, which measures total return on a portfolio of 80 bonds
with maturities of five years or longer, slipped 0.05 to 328.00.
   In the tax-exempt market, the Bond Buyer index of 40 actively
traded municipal bonds rose [ point to 92 27-32. The average yield
to maturity edged down to 7.35 percent from 7.36 percent late
Thursday.
   Yields on three-month Treasury bills fell to 8.09 percent as the
discount slipped 6 basis points to 7.83 percent. Yields on six-month
bills fell to 8.17 percent as the discount dropped 3 basis points to
7.75 percent. Yields on one-year bills fell to 8.21 percent as the
discount fell 5 basis points to 7.64 percent.
   A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point. The yield
is the annualized return on an investment in a Treasury bill. The
discount is the percentage that bills are selling below the face
value, paid at maturity.
   The federal funds rate, the interest on overnight loans between
banks, was quoted at 8 15-16, up from 8~ percent late Thursday.

<TEXT>
   A strike by miners protesting a new work
schedule Friday virtually paralyzed the government-owned El Salvador
copper mine, both the company and union leaders said.
   Nearly 4,000 workers are ordinarily employed at El Salvador,
Chile's third largest copper mine with an output of around 100,000
tons a year. Chile produces around 1.1 million tons of copper a year.
   The stoppage, which was voted by workers earlier in the week, is
legal.
   Darwin Bustamante, president of the National Copper Workers
Federation, said at a news conference that the strike ``almost
completely paralyzed the mine.''
   An official at the mine, who asked not to be identified by name,
told the AP by telephone that the strike ``has paralyzed the mining
operations,'' but other activities such as refining, were not
affected.
   He said no figures were immediately available on absenteeism.
   The strikers are protesting a decision by the government's copper
company, CODELCO, to add 412 miners to 300 already under a work
schedule known as ``continued week,'' which means they would would
take their day off on weekdays instead of Sunday.
   The company said the measure is needed to ensure that the mine
will remain in operation ``every day of the year.''
   According to the Chilean labor law, a legal strike can not last
longer than 59 days.
   New efforts to settle the strike were reported under way Friday.
Union leader Bustamente said the Mining Ministry could soon start a
mediation effort.

   Dutch-owned PolyGram International Ltd. is set
to acquire most of independent A&amp;M Records for about $500 million,
according to published reports.
   PolyGram, the third largest label behind Warner Bros. and CBS,
will buy all of A&amp;M's holdings except its publishing concerns and
real estate holdings, the Hollywood Reporter said Thursday.
   The two companies refused to comment publicly. The Wall Street
Journal said in its Friday editions that a deal was close to being
completed.
   A&amp;M, one of the last privately held major labels, claims a talent
roster headed by Janet Jackson, Sting, Toni Childs, Joe Jackson, Al
Green, Brenda Russell, Human League and Suzanne Vega. The label was
founded in 1962 by trumpet player Herb Alpert and partner Jerry
Moss, who used their initials to name it.
   The company's purchase by PolyGram had been rumored previously.
   PolyGram already distributes A&amp;M records in Europe; RCA records
is the label's American distributor.
   PolyGram, 90 percent owned by Dutch electronics giant NV Philips,
bought Island Records in August for around $300 million. PolyGram's
artists include Bon Jovi, Fine Young Cannibals, U2, Andrew Lloyd
Webber and Luciano Pavarotti.

<HEAD>FDA Investigates Drug Company Over 1982 Tablet Substitution</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DEBORAH MESCE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Food and Drug Administration said Friday it
is investigating a 1982 incident in which the maker of a generic
version of an anti-psychotic drug substituted samples of another
company's brand-name version for testing.
   The incident involved Bolar Pharmaceutical Co. Inc. of Copiague,
N.Y., one of 11 companies being investigated by the FDA for problems
ranging from manufacturing irregularities to fraud. The company is
one of the nation's largest drug manufacturers.
   The disclosure came less than a week after the FDA began steps to
remove from the market Bolar's version of the hypertension drug
Dyazide. The agency said its investigation has been unable to
determine whether the generic version is as effective as the
brand-name product.
   Bolar issued a statement saying that its version of the drug
thioridazine ``was never developed, never tested, never sent to the
FDA and never marketed.''
   Bolar President Robert Shulman was quoted in Friday's Wall Street
Journal and Washington Post as saying the incident was ``a
manufacturing error'' and ``an isolated case'' that occurred in
attempting to copy the tablet color of the brand-name drug.
   FDA spokesman Jeff Nesbit said, ``We have additional Bolar drugs
under investigation, including thioridazine.''
   In the course of the FDA's investigation, the agency obtained a
letter from PharmaKinetics Laboratories Inc. of Baltimore to Bolar
questioning, based on a visual inspection, the thioridazine samples
Bolar submitted for testing. The brand-name version of the drug,
Mellaril, is made by Sandoz Ltd.
   Pharmakinetics officials became suspicious that Bolar was
switching samples after the outer coating of tablets sent for
testing began to chip and the Sandoz logo became visible.
   Bolar later submitted different generic versions of Mellaril and
won FDA approval to market the product in 1983. The approved pills
were a different size, shape and weight from the brand-name drug.
   Paul Perito, an attorney for PharmaKinetics, called the Bolar
matter ``an isolated incident.'' PharmaKinetics President Steven
Woodman added, ``We have not had any other incident like this from
this manufacturer or any other.''
   Earlier this summer, Vitarine Pharmaceuticals Inc. of Spring
Valley, N.Y., admitted to the FDA that it substituted a brand-name
product for its generic version to win FDA approval.
   PharmaKinetics did the testing for that drug as well, but Woodman
said the lab did not suspect any problems at the time.
   In the case of Bolar's generic version of Mellaril,
PharmaKinetics said it notified the company of the problem after it
was noticed and refused to conduct tests on the samples.
   ``Pharmakinetics is not the keeper of morality in the
pharmaceutical industry,'' Alan G. Woodman, who was president of
PharmaKinetics at the time, said to Bolar Vice President Jack Rivers
in a letter obtained by the Post.
   ``But Jack, you are an important part of an American success
story, and it's our opinion that the exposure you place yourself and
your company by pursuing this course of action far outweighs any
possible benefit which may accrue to you or the company.''
   PharmaKinetics was not required to notify the FDA of the problem,
PharmaKinetics and FDA officials said.
   Bolar, in its statement, said the letter appeared to have been
leaked to the news media ``to increase pressure on the FDA to remove
low-cost generic Dyazide from the marketplace.''
   In a full-page advertisement in Friday's New York Times, Bolar
employees stated their support for their company's management and
said they were ``outraged'' at U.S. Rep. John Dingell, D-Mich.,
chairman of the Energy and Commerce investigations subcommittee,
which has been investigating the generic drug industry and FDA's
generic drug division.
   The ad attacked Dingell ``for creating a climate of fear and
distrust within the entire generic pharmaceutical industry because
of the fraudulent deeds of a few.''

   The wave of takeover speculation sweeping the
airline industry has raised concerns among government regulators and
others over possible safety and competitive problems stemming from
debt-financed buyouts.
   Government officials are worried that the heavy debts could
weaken an airline's financial ability to operate safely, the
Transportation Department has signaled anew that it will severely
scrutinize any deals relying heavily on debt.
   And some analysts warn that the debt burdens piled up in highly
leveraged buyouts of airlines could mean sharply higher air fares,
if the airlines pass their higher debt costs directly to passengers.
   ``The money's got to come from someplace,'' said Morten Beyer,
chairman of Avmark Inc., an aviation consulting firm in Arlington,
Va.
   In a leveraged buyout, a company is purchased using its own
assets as collateral for financing the loans used in the takeover.
That means the loans are repaid either by selling the assets or by
using the company's cash flow.
   Critics of such deals say the big debt-servicing requirements
could require LBO companies to cut spending in other areas, and in a
severe economic downturn could lead to bankruptcy.
   In addition, proposed airline takeovers may offer as collateral
some assets that aren't really in the companies' hands _ such as new
jets that have been ordered with little money put down.
   ``I think the (airline) deals are extremely aggressive,'' said
Chriss Street, an LBO specialist who is a managing director of
Seidler Amdec Securities Inc. in Los Angeles.
   Some experts believe an airline is the wrong kind of company to
qualify as a good candidate for a buyout financed with debt.
Airlines have heavy capital-spending requirements and must deal with
unions in setting labor costs. Furthermore, their business always
has been very sensitive to the ups and downs of the economy.
   In one of the biggest recent leveraged deals, an investor group
led by Alfred Checchi, which included KLM Royal Dutch Airlines,
bought Northwest Airlines parent NWA Inc. for $3.65 billion on Aug.
4.
   That ignited a flurry of airline stock buying, in anticipation of
new takeovers or mergers involving UAL Corp., AMR Corp., Pan Am
Corp., Trans World Airlines Inc., Continental Airlines and others.
   United Airlines parent UAL already has received a $6.19 billion
buyout proposal from investor Marvin Davis and said late Friday it
would consider a rival plan from a group led by UAL management and
employees and other offers.
   Assistant Transportation Secretary Jeffrey N. Shane said this
week that the department ``will take active steps in response to the
levels of debt and levels of foreign ownership.''
   News accounts of his remarks caused high-flying airline stocks to
drop sharply Thursday, although they rebounded on Friday.
   Transportation Secretary Samuel K. Skinner previously had written
letters to airline officials expressing concern about leveraged
buyouts. But Shane told the Wall Street Journal that the agency,
which was silent on the NWA buyout, has decided it was time to
``send a message'' to the investment community.
   In cases of safety issues or if it deems management incompetent,
the Transportation Department can revoke a carrier's permission to
fly.
   A Transportation Department official, who asked not to be
identified, said Friday that the agency is concerned about the
impact of takeovers on airline competition and safety, but not
specifically on fares.
   The costs of airline debt also could mean discount fares could
become rarer, said consumer attorney James Flug, a partner in the
Washington law firm Lobel, Novins, Lamont &amp; Flug.
   Transportation officials also have voiced concern about foreign
ownership.
   In addition to KLM, other foreign carriers have been racing to
snap up chunks of major U.S. airlines. British Airways has joined
with the employee-management bidders for UAL. Scandinavian Airlines
System, which already holds 9.9 percent of Continental's parent
Texas Air Corp., has been in talks to buy a stake in Continental.
   Under U.S. law, foreign investors may not own more than 25
percent of a carrier, but the DOT can object to smaller stakes if it
believes the foreign carrier is trying to exert control.
   Shane told the Wall Street Journal that his department is
reluctant to approve such foreign purchases, because there still are
many questions about U.S. airlines' access to European markets after
the Common Market's planned unification in 1992.
   He also said the Transportation Department still was reviewing
the NWA purchase and could impose conditions that would prevent
NWA's new owners from restructuring without department approval.
   ``We've been cooperating with them all along,'' said NWA
spokesman Bob Gibbons in Minneapolis, referring to the agency's
review.

   An upbeat attitude about the economy's health
sent the stock market higher Friday, carrying the Dow Jones
industrial average and broader indicators to record heights.
   Activity on Wall Street wound down in the afternoon as traders
began leaving early for the long Labor Day weekend.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials rose 14.82 to a new high
of 2,752.09, surpassing the previous peak of 2,743.36 reached Monday
and bringing its gain for the weak to 19.73 points.
   Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones by about 9 to 5 in
nationwide trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed stocks, with
897 up, 498 down and 561 unchanged.
   Volume on the floor of the Big Board came to 133.30 million
shares, down from 143.42 million on Thursday.
   A collection of economic reports were open to varying
interpretations but, on balance, financial markets reacted favorably
to the figures.
   A report on the job market, which provided the first glimpse of
economic conditions last month, suggested the economy is growing at
a moderate rate, making the threat of recession seem more remote.
   The Labor Department said the nation's unemployment rate remained
at 5.2 percent in August. Non-farm payrolls expanded by 110,000, a
total that was reduced by about 108,000 due to strikes.
   Separately, a Commerce Department report pointed to a rebound in
momentum after months of sluggish economic activity earlier this
year. The Index of Leading Economic Indicators rose a modest 0.2
percent in July after registering no gain in June and plunging by
1.3 percent in May, the biggest drop since late 1987 following the
stock market crash.
   Countering the positive economic news was the August survey of
the nation's purchasing managers. The National Association of
Purchasing Management's monthly poll showed lingering weakness in
the industrial side of the economy.
   Bonds rallied on the purchasing managers' assessment and sported
significant gains after an abbreviated pre-holiday session. The
bullishness in the bond market spurred buying enthusiasm in the
stock market.
   General Motors headed the list of actively traded shares on the
Big Board. It added 1 to 50 and more than 2 million shares changed
hands. Other major automakers also posted gains: Ford rose ] to 54\
and Chyrsler gained ] to 27.
   Some of the blue chips contributing to the advance in the Dow
Jones industrial average included: Exxon, up \ to 44; General
Electric, up | to 58\; International Business Machines, up \ to
117]; McDonald's, up \ to 29[; Merck, up [ to 73|; and Philip
Morris, up } to 164{.
   Takeover speculation continued to preoccupy traders. Johnson &amp;
Johnson rose 1[ to 53{ amid what were described as vague takeover
rumors.
   Airline stocks made a comeback from Thursday's selloff. UAL,
parent of United Airlines, jumped 7\ to 287 on word that the pilots
union was preparing to make a bid for the carrier. AMR, owner of
American, rose 1} to 89}.
   Lyphomed gained 1] to 31] in over-the-counter trading. The
company said it has agreed to be bought by Japan's Fujisawa
Pharmaceutical Co. Ltd., which already owns 30 percent of the drug
manufacturer.
   Nationwide, consolidated volume in NYSE-listed issues, including
trades in those stocks on regional exchanges and in the
over-the-counter market, totaled 158.996 million shares.
   As measured by Wilshire Associates' index of more than 5,000
actively traded stocks, the market added $17.3 billion, or 0.50
percent, in value.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks rose
1.10 to a record 196.37, well above its previous best close of
195.45 registered Monday.
   Standard &amp; Poor's industrial index rose 2.42 to 405.27, and S&amp;P's
500-stock composite index finished up 2.28 at 353.73, also a record.
   The NASDAQ composite index for the over-the-counter market gained
2.01 to 471.34. At the American Stock Exchange, the market value
index closed at 383.96, up 1.77, and above its previous best of
382.24 on Aug. 10.

<HEAD>Cotton Futures Down Sharply in Technical Trading</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID DISHNEAU</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Cotton futures prices fell sharply Friday on the New York Cotton
Exchange in what appeared to be another leg of a technical
correction that began a week earlier after prices reached their
highest levels in nearly two years.
   On other markets, copper futures prices fell on perceptions that
a Chilean miners strike will be short-lived, and soybean futures
wilted amid diminishing fears of an early freeze in the Midwest.
   Cotton futures settled .15 cent to 1.49 cents lower with the
contract for delivery in October at 72.06 cents a pound.
   Friday's decline marked the fifth daily drop in cotton futures
prices in six trading sessions. The downtrend began Aug. 25, the day
after most contracts set new lifetime highs on concerns that the
effects of too much rain in the Southeast and too little in Texas
have cut sharply into yield prospects for the 1989 U.S. cotton crop.
   On Aug. 24, the October contract traded as high as 76.60 cents a
pound, the highest price for a near-month cotton contract since
Sept. 24, 1987.
   But in its rapid run up to that level, the market sometimes
leapfrogged prices between one day's close and the next day's
opening. One school of technical analysis contends that markets must
return to fill these ``gaps'' before continuing a trend.
   Ernest Simon, a cotton specialist with Prudential-Bache
Securities Inc., said the market may be on its way to filling a gap
in the December contract's progress.
   ``We are right now near the top of a gap formed some time ago,''
he said.
   The December contract reached an intra-day low Friday of 72.75
cents a pound and would have to fall to 72 cents to fill the gap, he
said.
   ``It was strictly technical,'' Simon said of Friday's trading.
``The technicians started to sell it, the funds started to sell it,
it got into a lot of sell stops and just went down.''
   Copper futures prices fell steeply on New York's Commodity
Exchange following a wire service report that the leader of a miners
union in Chile said a strike that began Friday at the Chilean Copper
Co.'s El Salvador mine would likely be settled within 48 hours.
   Copper settled 2.25 cents to 2.55 cents lower with September at
$1.297 a pound.
   In precious-metals trading on the Comex, gold settled 70 cents an
ounce higher across the board with October at $362.40 a troy ounce;
silver was 3 cents to 3.7 cents higher with September at $5.076 a
troy ounce.
   Soybean futures gave up most of the previous session's gains on
the Chicago Board of Trade, retreating along with corn futures
prices as fears of an early freeze in the Midwest faded.
   Wheat futures prices rose substantially, though, partly on
expectations for increased export sales. Afte the close, the
Agriculture Department announced a sale of 200,000 metric tons of
wheat to China.
   Wheat settled } cent to 5{ cents higher with September at $3.91{
a bushel; corn was 1\ cents to 2} cents lower with September at
$2.32} a bushel; oats were 1\ cents to 2{ cents lower with September
at $1.33} a bushel; soybeans were 6{ cents to 9} cents lower with
September at $5.81{ a bushel.
   Livestock futures retreated in light, pre-holiday book-squaring
on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange but frozen pork-belly futures
rallied on hopes that surplus U.S. pork bellies may be shipped to
Poland as part of an aid package.
   Live cattle settled .45 cent lower to .03 cent higher with
October at 73.32 cents a pound; feeder cattle were unchanged to .27
cent lower with September at 82.45 cents a pound; live hogs were
unchanged to .62 cent lower with October at 40.15 cents a pound;
frozen pork bellies were .05 cent lower to .40 cent higher with
February at 44.07 cents a pound.
   Most energy futures retreated modestly on the New York Mercantile
Exchange on reports that OPEC may be planning higher crude-oil
production quotas.
   West Texas Intermediate crude oil settled 14 cents lower to 1
cent higher with October at $18.82 a barrel; heating oil was .30
cent to .50 cent lower with October at 53.90 cents a gallon;
unleaded gasoline was .23 cent lower to .30 cent higher with October
at 53.30 cents a gallon.

<HEAD>SEC Seeks Appeals Court Rehearing on `Stock Baskets'</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Securities and Exchange Commission will
appeal a court ruling that it erred in authorizing trading in a
security that is based on the value of broad stock market indexes,
officials said Friday.
   The 7th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled last month that the
securities, known as ``stock baskets,'' resemble futures contracts,
not stocks, and as such, they should be regulated by the Commodity
Futures Trading Commission, which originally sanctioned them.
   After the SEC authorized the American Stock Exchange and the
Philadelphia Stock Exchange to begin trading the stock baskets in
April, the Chicago Board of Trade and the Chicago Mercantile
Exchange, which trade in similar financial instruments, sued in
federal court.
   A three-judge 7th Circuit panel ruled in favor of the two Chicago
exchanges, saying any stock basket security must be registered with
the CFTC.
   The SEC decided to seek a re-hearing by the same panel or a rare
hearing by the entire 7th Circuit, known as an ``en banc'' hearing,
said Brandon Becker, associate director of the SEC's self-regulatory
oversight and market structure office.
   CFTC officials said they had not seen the SEC court papers and
could not comment.

<HEAD>Eastern Says Claims Settled, Operations Safe</HEAD>

<DATELINE>MIAMI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Eastern Airlines on Friday said it has settled
pre-strike safety claims by the Federal Aviation Administration and
gotten favorable marks for the safety of its rebuilding effort.
   ``The FAA has concluded that the company is operating at the very
high safety standards required by its operating certificate,''
Eastern said in a statement.
   Charles E. Bryan, head of the Machinists union at Eastern, said
the statement was ``typical of the FAA's relationship with (Texas
Air Corp. Chairman) Frank Lorenzo's airlines.'' The unions, marking
the end of their sixth month on strike Monday by joining the Labor
Day parade in New York, say Eastern is unsafely rushing its
rebuilding without the unions.
   Company spokeswoman Karen Ceremsak said Eastern is paying some
$11.5 million in FAA fines. The FAA safety charges were from 1985 to
1988, she said, and the claims were settled to meet an Aug. 31 U.S.
Bankruptcy Court deadline for old claims against the carrier.
   Eastern filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy reorganization on March
9, five days after its three unions went on strike.
   Ms. Ceremsak said $8.5 million Eastern is paying stems from a
1986 civil penalty of $9.5 million the FAA assessed because of
numerous record-keeping violations. She said all the fines had to do
with the pre-strike workforce.
   ``This is old news, it's housekeeping for the FAA,'' she said.
``This was a completely different workforce.''
   The FAA expressed satisfaction with Eastern's current maintenance
personnel, its supply of tools and spare parts, and the ability of
its newly hired pilots, Eastern said.
   Eastern released its statement late in the afternoon, and no FAA
officials were immediately available in Washington. Ms. Ceremsak
said Eastern had been delaying its announcement while working out
details and trying to coordinate its statement with the FAA.
   ``The FAA also acknowledges the numerous improvements made by
Eastern subsequent to March 4, 1989, which have enhanced the
company's regulatory compliance posture,'' Eastern said.
   Eastern said its past violations didn't affect passenger safety.
The Miami-based carrier said it has carried more than 485 million
passengers since 1975 with 29 fatalities, one of the best records in
the airline industry.
   Bryan said union officials know that Eastern has been cutting
corners on maintenance, such as failing to certify altimeters.
   ``They're whitewashing it,'' Bryan said.

   Unemployment steadied at 5.2 percent last
month, the government said in a report prompting forecasts that the
record-long expansion will survive past its seventh anniversary.
   The government on Friday also revised its July job growth figure
upward to 184,000 from 169,000, and the June totals up again from
250,000 to 297,000, further signs that the economy continues to
expand at a pace that will keep it out of recession. The bond market
largely shrugged off the news.

   The industrial side of the U.S. economy continued
to weaken during August and a growth index fell to its lowest level
since the economic expansion began in late 1982, the nation's
corporate purchasing managers said.
   The Purchasing Managers' Index, a widely watched barometer of the
economy's direction, fell to 45.2 percent last month from 46 percent
in July. That was the lowest reading since December 1982, the month
after the beginning of the current economic expansion.
   Bond prices rose on the news as traders believed the slowdown
could lead the Federal Reserve to relax credit.

   The Commerce Department said Friday the gain in the Index of
Leading Economic Indicators followed no increase at all in June and
a steep 1.3 percent drop in May, the biggest decline since late
1987. The index had risen 0.6 percent in April.

at $415.7 billion in July.
   While the July rebound was modest, analysts said it offered at

<HEAD>State Probes Death of Wild Vultures at Disney Island</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LAKE BUENA VISTA, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A state agency is investigating the
deaths of 19 wild vultures at Walt Disney World's Discovery Island
during a trapping-and-removal operation for the unwanted predators.
   Disney spokesman Charlie Ridgway acknowledged Friday that about
15 vultures died of heat exhaustion in a storage shed while awaiting
transfer to a nearby wildlife refuge.
   ``We are cooperating fully in the investigation'' by the state
Game and Fresh Water Fish Commission, Ridgway said. ``We had, and
still have, a problem with the vultures. We did relocate a number of
them and _ purely accidentally _ about 15 of the vultures died of
heat exhaustion in the hot summer heat.''
   Curator Charles L. Cook of Discovery Island received an emergency
federal permit May 24 to relocate up to 100 of the aggressive
scavenger birds that were bothering visitors and threatening rare
birds and animals on the 11-acre sanctuary and tourist site.
   A subsequent report filed by Cook said 149 vultures were
captured, according to a story for the New York Times Regional
Newspapers. Other Disney documents show 19 vultures died in the
trapping operation, 18 were released and 112 were moved to
Chassahowitzka National Wildlife Refuge.
   Ridgway said he didn't have details of the operation, but the
number of vultures specified in the federal permit was exceeded
through a misunderstanding and there was no intent to harm any of
the vultures.
   Cook could not be reached for comment.
   While common in Florida and other Southern states, the large,
black vulture is protected under the Migratory Bird Treaty Act.
Violations can bring up to six months in jail and a $5,000 fine for
individuals and a $10,000 fine for corporations.
   ``They perform an extremely valuable function in cleansing the
land of dead animals,'' said Phil Million, a spokesman for the U.S.
Fish and Wildlife Service.
   The vultures have become an increasing problem at Discovery
Island, where they are attracted by the food supply around the
island and a nearby campground, Disney officials have said.
   In letters to wildlife officials, Disney said the vultures have
attacked Galapagos tortoises and brown pelicans, consumed large
stocks of animal feed and even torn apart furniture at the park.
   ``Discovery Island is to these birds like Social Security in your
senile human population ... They never had it so good,''
veterinarian E.E. Schobert wrote in a letter that Disney filed with
its request for state assistance.
   Walt Disney World has acquired a reputation for innovative
environmental and wildlife projects, including the training of
monkeys for use by paraplegics.

<HEAD>Bolivia Announces Agreement to Eliminate Debts to Argentina</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LA PAZ, Bolivia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Bolivian government has reached an
agreement to eliminate all its debt to Argentina, its principal
trading partner and creditor.
   Argentina will cancel $800 million owed to it by Bolivia, and in
return Bolivia will cancel $300 million that Argentina owes it for
natural gas purchases, Foreign Minister Carlos Iturralde announced.
   Bolivia has been paying $55 million a year in interest to
Argentina for funds that were largely borrowed during the 1980
right-wing military government headed by Luis Garcia Meza.
   ``With this agreement we are effectively lowering our debt $500
million, which represents 20 percent of our total debt,'' said
Iturralde.

<HEAD>As Bush and Kaifu Discuss Trade, Japan's Trade Figures Continue to
Improve</HEAD>

   The Japanese government said Friday the nation's
surplus in the broadest measure of trade fell in July for the fifth
month in a row.
   The announcement came as President Bush and Japanese Prime
Minister Toshiki Kaifu discussed trade in Washington.
   Japan's current account surplus, which includes merchandise
trade, shipping, tourism and investment income, fell 18.3 percent
from its level of a year earlier to $5.31 billion, the Finance
Ministry said.
   Car and steel exports were down, while computer and business
machine imports were up.
   Japan's surplus in trade alone, a narrower measure, declined
nearly 20 percent to $6.97 billion in July from a year earlier, the
ministry said.
   Government officials hope the recent trend will help Japan repeat
last year's performance, when it cut its current account surplus 8.7
percent to $79.5 billion.
   Meeting with Kaifu in Washington, Bush said: ``I share the prime
minister's belief that while Japan is noted as an exporting
superpower, the time has also come for Japan to be an importing
superpower.''
   Kaifu said Japan recognized that trade imbalances were a source
of irritation and said his country would continue to ``make efforts
for expanding imports.''
   Friday's figures show that in July a booming economy at home
continued to drive Japan's growth, while exports lagged.
   Japan's imports jumped to $16 billion, 13.5 percent higher than
in July of last year. Imports of computers, business machines, and
textile products were strong, ministry officials said.
   Exports inched up 0.3 percent from a year earlier to $23 billion.
Exports of cars declined 5.3 percent and steel exports declined 3.7
percent compared to last year.
   American and Japanese officials will meet Monday and Tuesday in
Tokyo to discuss ``structural'' ways to reduce their bilateral
imbalance. Japan will probably ask the United States to reduce its
budget deficit, which economists say fuels its trade deficit.
   U.S. officials may ask Japan to stimulate its domestic economy to
increase imports and encourage its people to spend rather than save.
   After adjustment for seasonal fluctuations, the current account
surplus grew to $4.05 billion in July from $2.92 billion in the
previous month.
   The surplus in merchandise trade declined to $5.47 billion in
July from $5.75 billion the previous month.
   Both exports and imports were measured when contracts were
settled. The Finance Ministry each month makes a separate
announcement of trade statistics that are compiled when goods pass
through customs.
