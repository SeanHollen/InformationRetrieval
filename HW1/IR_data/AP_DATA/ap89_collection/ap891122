   El Morro Castle, the fortress
Spaniards built 400 years ago to keep out pirates and now a major
tourist attraction, has become a battleground for tree lovers and
those who demand historical authenticity.
   In the tree-lovers camp are conservationists and a group of art
students protesting what they call the ``chainsaw massacre'' of El
Morro's trees by the National Guard after Hurricane Hugo struck on
Sept. 18. All 200 trees on the 21-acre site, not just those damaged
by the storm, were chopped up and hauled away, leaving a litter of
stumps.
   In the opposing camp are the National Park Service and Puerto
Rico's Commonwealth Historic Preservation Office. They control
separate areas of El Morro and authorized the clearance as part of
their plan to restore the site to its original state _ a treeless
garrison.
   About 100 students at the School of Plastic Arts, which is on El
Morro grounds, planted saplings and protest placards outside the
school and have been maintaining an around-the-clock vigil there
since early October.
   The students, who once did their artwork in the shade of the
trees, have organized protest marches to the governor's mansion, La
Fortaleza, demanding reforestation of El Morro.
   Conservation groups have taken up the cause, which has provoked
a stream of letters in The San Juan Star, including one containing
Joyce Kilmer's most famous poem, ``Trees.''
   W.P. Crawford, the National Park Service superintendent in
Puerto Rico, said Hugo's 140-mph winds left only few trees standing
at El Morro and most of the rest were too badly mangled to be saved.
   Taking them out was only thing to do, he maintained.
   Besides, Crawford said, a 1983 general management plan, approved
two years later by the U.S. and Commonwealth governments, said the
broad grassy slope leading to the fort should be treeless, the way
it was originally.
   ``Maybe with a superhuman effort some of the trees could have
been saved,'' he said. ``But because the general management plan
calls for removing all the trees, I didn't think it was worth the
time and effort of nursing a dozen or so along.''
   ``What we are trying to do is protect the historic scene,'' as
mandated by Congress for all U.S. historic sites, Crawford said.
``The historical context has got to be No. 1 by law.''
   Archaeologist Guy Pantell, who has asked the presidential
Advisory Council on Historic Preservation in Washington for an
investigation, said the historical argument did not justify the
destruction of trees not damaged by the storm.
   ``If this was so, parts of El Morro would have to be eliminated.
Its construction occurred during several centuries,'' Pantell said
in an interview with the Star.
   The walled fort, which overlooks San Juan Harbor, was built
mostly between 1589 and the 1650s to guard the city against
seaborne attack. Today, it is by far Puerto Rico's most popular
tourist attraction, with 2.5 million visitors a year.
   Tourists approach El Morro's tiered batteries across a 200-yard
esplanade, which is a popular place for picnics and flying kites.
Historians say the esplanade was purposely kept clear of vegetation
to give El Morro's defenders a clear line of fire.
   But during the 1940s, soldiers planted about 50 sea pines and
coconut palms along the road in front of El Morro, which at that
time had a U.S. Army officers' club. Other trees were planted
nearby on land controlled by the Commonwealth government.
   Gov. Rafael Hernandez Colon, who had endorsed the tree removal,
has reversed his position and appointed a committee to work out a
compromise.
   Committee member Enrique Marti, founder of the conservation
group Pro Bosques Urbanos, or Pro Urban Forests, said the panel had
agreed to selectively plant trees at El Morro to keep the main
esplanade clear. He said the landscape would look better than it
did before the hurricane.
   But not everybody is satisfied.
   ``Our children will see the trees, but we won't,'' said Lourdes
Quintero, 24, one of the protesting art students.

   Sculptor Isabel McIlvain is closing in on the
moment of truth for her 8-foot-tall portrayal of John F. Kennedy.
   Her clay statue is about to be cast in bronze, the final step
before its unveiling outside the Massachusetts capitol as the
formal memorial to a beloved native son.
   For older generations, the heroic image will recall the optimism
and vigor embodied by Kennedy. For generations born since the young
president was slain on Nov. 22, 1963, the statue offers a glimpse
of the era known as Camelot.
   ``My wish is to portray somebody who was a magnetic leader and
who had a lot of youth, a lot of hope about his role and the
possiblities for America,'' said McIlvain, a professor of sculpture
at Boston University.
   McIlvain's work, which will take about six months to cast,
depicts Kennedy in a classic pose _ striding into a breeze, eyes
forward, elbows bent with his left hand tucked into his suit pocket.
   ``There are some people who have the carriage but they are stiff
and pompous, where there's nothing stiff about Kennedy,'' said the
artist, who has spent thousands of hours studying her subject. ``I
think you can see the man's wit, the glint of humor in his eye.''
   The finished $175,000 sculpture, which has been paid for through
donations from citizens' groups and schoolchildren, is scheduled
for unveiling May 29, which would have been Kennedy's 72nd birthday.
   It will be displayed outside the Statehouse near a statue of
Henry Cabot Lodge, the Republican whose son Kennedy defeated in
1952 in the U.S. Senate campaign that launched his national career.
   The John F. Kennedy Memorial Commission was established by the
state Legislature in 1983 to create a suitable tribute. The
commission sponsored a yearlong competition for memorial designs,
which drew 300 entries from around the country.
   Judges debated the former president's stance, demeanor and
whether both coat buttons should be buttoned the way Kennedy
preferred, despite the dicates of style.
   History _ and McIlvain _ won after it was established Kennedy
had indeed appeared in more than 200 photographs with his
two-button coat buttoned contrary to sartorial custom.
   ``I tried to catch his spirit, so it's not my thinking imposed
on him as much as it's a reflection of him,'' said McIlvain, who
won the commission's approval in April 1988.
   ``He was an extremely charming man, but I didn't want the
super-polished, stereotypical person,'' she added, citing again the
hand in the pocket. ``I'm sure his mother told him endlessly not to
do it because it sags the pocket out, but that's the real John
Kennedy.''

<DATELINE>WEST BERLIN (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Polish housewife huddles behind a motley
collection of children's clothes and three light bulbs laid out for
sale on an icy patch of ground.
   A West German psychologist says he specializes in the big stuff:
smuggling musical instruments or porcelain from East Berlin to the
western sector and sending back color TVs, automobiles with false
papers and computers.
   In East Berlin, a physical education teacher plies a furtive
trade as an illegal taxi driver outside the newly opened
Friedrichstrasse subway station near the Berlin Wall. On a good day
he makes the equivalent of two weeks' pay by charging West German
marks.
   All three are part of a black market burgeoning with the
crumbling of the Berlin Wall.
   It threatens the already frail East Germany currency and also
raises the prospect of a huge underground barter of state-subsided
East German goods for Western luxuries.
   ``East Germany's problem of controlling people has been replaced
by a problem of controlling things,'' said Manfred Milzer, an
analyst at the state-funded West German Institute for Economic
Research.
   East Germany's beleaguered government says it plans to impose
``harsh measures'' to curb the black market, while pro-democracy
opposition groups have joined state appeals to East Germans not to
use their new freedom to travel for smuggling.
   There are no firm estimates of the size of the black market.
   East German officials estimate that non-East Germans alone will
have smuggled out 2.5 billion East German marks worth of subsidized
goods this year, according to the East German daily newspaper
Berliner Zeitung. At East Germany's official rate, that equals
$1.35 billion.
   An indicator of a new surge in black market activity is the
plunge in the value of the East German mark since the Communist
government's abrupt decision Nov. 9 to let its citizens travel
freely.
   Before Nov. 9, it was officially on a par with West German mark
and actually exchanged in West Germany at 10-1. Since then it has
fallen as low as 30-1.
   There are reports of East Germans, many of whom have accumulated
marks for lack of anything much to buy, smuggling out huge
quantities of money since the border was opened.
   The black market had already expanded rapidly this year
following Poland's easing of travel restrictions last Jan. 1.
   An open-air Polish market, with more than 1,000 small-time
traders standing around before their wares operates daily alongside
a rail line in West Berlin's Kreutzberg district.
   The Poles there are among up to 10,000 a day who pour through
East Germany and cross into West Berlin, a three-hour train ride
from the Polish city of Szczecin on the East German border.
   Some of the traveling Poles have developed a regular pattern,
said a Customs Department spokesman in East Berlin. They sell in
West Berlin, and buy up state-subsized goods in East Germany.
   ``These people make up to a 1,000 percent profit,'' said the
official, speaking on condition of anonymity in an interview at the
department's headquarters.
   The East German government, said Milzer, spends 50 billion East
German marks on subsidies (about $27 billion), one-fifth of its
annual budget.
   In black market terms, that means a purchaser with West German
marks can buy a consignment of children's dresses for the
equivalent of a few cents apiece.
   The first 10 days after the opening of the wall, when more than
6 millon people crossed, was a black marketeer's dream, according
to a 27-year-old psychologist at a drug rehabilitation center in
West Berlin. He's been in the black market business for three years.
   ``That first week I got 10 color television sets into East
Berlin just piled into cars,'' he said in an interview, speaking
about his trade on condition of anonymity.
   With the gradual easing before Nov. 9 on crossings by West
Berliners, he made three or four a month, usually taking West
German mark profits back to East Berlin.
   He said he also makes high-risk night-time exchanges of smuggled
goods on the transit autobahn that runs through East Germany to
West Berlin.
   He began, he said, by helping a few friends in East Germany. He
now has a network of 20 East German contacts bolstered in the past
year by the addition of two Polish middlemen. They deal mainly
face-to-face and have a code for telephone messages.
   He has regular buyers in West Berlin, but sells pieces of East
Germany's famed Meissen porcelain in other West German cities
because the upsurge in smuggling by Poles has depressed prices in
West Berlin.
   His major deals, he recalled, were three cars. East Germans can
wait up to 15 years to buy a Trabi, the natonal make. Only cars
less than 4 years old _ way beyond the means of most East Germans _
can be imported.
   He buys older cars, then buys illegally acquired documents of a
newer model wrecked in a crash, resprays the old vehicle and
changes the engine and license plates.
   ``For East Germans, this is the only way to get things or real
money,'' he said. ``I just cover my expenses, but there is big
money to be made _ perhaps more now.''

   President Bush's son-in-law was arrested
on drunken driving and drug possession charges after being stopped
in his pickup truck, police said.
   William Heekin LeBlond, 32, estranged husband of Bush's
30-year-old daughter, Dorothy, was stopped Nov. 10 on Route 62 and
charged with drunken driving and possession of marijuana, Police
Chief Arner Tibbetts said Tuesday.
   Tibbetts said he did not know how much marijuana LeBlond had or
whether any alcohol was found in his car.
   LeBlond spent the night in the Maynard jail before being
released on $25 bail the next morning, Tibbetts said.
   LeBlond, of Cape Elizabeth, Maine, separated from his wife of
eight years in August.

<HEAD>Notes Penned By Dictator Auctioned in London</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Two of the rarest items ever seen in the West _
letters by Soviet dictator Joseph Stalin _ were sold at auction in
London and fetched a total of $30,000.
   Sotheby's auction house would not say how it obtained the brief,
scrawled notes, pencilled about 1930 on leaves apparently torn from
notebooks.
   Both were written to Klimenti Voroshilov, a henchman of Stalin
and one-time commissar of defense.
   One note commuted a death sentence on Andrei Snesaryev, a
Bolshevik general, to 10 years' imprisonment. It sold for $22,300.
The other, telling Voroshilov to meet with Stalin at a theater,
went for $7,700.
   Sotheby's would not say how it obtained the notes, which were
bought by British dealders, but they may have come from the
Snesaryev family as eight of the family photographs were included
with the note about the meeting.
   ``Autograph letters or notes by Stalin are of the greatest
rarity, as few ever reached the West and I know of nothing in the
past 10 years,'' said Professor Chimen Abramsky, an expert on
Soviet history.
   ``These notes to Voroshilov illustrate Stalin's manner of
working, without the aid of a secretary or a typewriter,'' he said.
   Abramsky related that Snesaryev, who spoke 14 languages
fluently, tangled with Stalin during the civil war that followed
the 1917 revolution. The dispute was over the conduct of military
operations near Tsaritsyn, which made Stalin's military reputation.
The city was later renamed Stalingrad.
   Snesaryev was condemned to death as a traitor but reprieved. He
was chief of the Red Army general staff from 1919 to 1921, when he
published a book on Afghanistan warning the Soviet Union never to
embark on a war with that country.
   Abramsky said Snesaryev was arrested and condemned again in 1930
in the notorious Stalin purges but reprieved when his wife appealed
to Voroshilov to intervene. He died in 1937.
   Stalin died in 1953, Voroshilov in 1969.

   The state Senate is forging a new coalition
today: Two of its members are getting married.
   The early evening marriage of Democrats Vi Simpson and William
D. McCarty under the Statehouse rotunda will mark the first time
two Indiana senators have been husband and wife.
   ``A new caucus is being formed in the Indiana state Senate; it
is a special caucus of two,'' said Senate President Pro Tem Robert
D. Garton, who sponsored a resolution Tuesday honoring the couple.
``I think we can take credit for bringing them together.''
   Said Senate Minority Leader Dennis P. Neary: ``You're making
history.''
   Simpson, 43, and McCarty, 46, are in their second terms and have
been married before.
   They have sat across the aisle from each other for five years.
Neary said he offered to let the two sit side by side but that was
rejected. ``Rather than having any family quarrels or fights, they
will not be sitting together,'' said Neary.
   McCarty will continue to maintain his home in Anderson and plans
to run for re-election 1990. Simpson hasn't decided about seeking
re-election. Her term runs through 1992.
   She works for an environmental consulting firm in Indianapolis
and will keep her home in Ellettsville, 60 miles southwest of
Anderson.
   The two will take turns spending time at each other's home, she
said.
   ``It actually works reasonably well,'' said McCarty.

   Promoter Ted Shupe was hoping to ham it up
again with another porcine grappling extravaganza, but there just
wasn't enough interest in his proposed Utah State Pig Wrestling
Championship.
   So rather than root around for contestants, he has called the
thing off.
   His advertising for the event carried a Nov. 20 deadline for
registration, and after checking his mail and returning about half
a dozen phone calls, he announced Tuesday that no pork-pinning
event would be held.
   Shupe said he only had 10 teams signed up with entry fees paid.
Eight to 10 others showed interest during the last few days, but he
said he needed 40.
   The contest, originally scheduled to start today at the Weber
County Fairgrounds, would have pitted squads of five humans racing
the clock to wrestle young pigs into barrels.

<DATELINE>APPLETON, Wis. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The breaching of the Berlin Wall, cheered
by many as another step in the democraticization of Eastern Europe,
gets a wary response from the ultraconservative John Birch Society.
   ``Nothing's really changed,'' said Executive Director G. Allen
Bubolz. ``The message is still the same.''
   That message was contained in a full-page advertisement Saturday
in the Chicago Sun-Times.
   The society, established in the late 1950s to fight communism
and expansion of government, placed the ad in conjunction with
Polish solidarity leader Lech Walesa's visit to Chicago.
   Its headline was ``Aid to Poland? Hold on a minute!'' and it
criticized Walesa's request for more U.S. aid and investment in
Poland.
   ``The U.S. government should hardly be giving away money!'' the
ad said. ``And financing communist-style socialism is doubly
horrendous. All programs involving foreign aid ... should be
terminated, especially those delivering American taxpayers' money
to Communists, crypto-Communists and collaborators with
Communists.''
   The Birch Society was founded in 1958 by 11 men alarmed at the
growth of communism in the world and what they felt was
then-President Eisenhower's failure to fight it.
   It was named after John M. Birch, a Baptist missionary and U.S.
Army captain killed by Chinese communists a few days after World
War II. It took the motto: ``Less government, more responsibility
and with God's help a better world.''
   Bubolz, a former insurance executive in Appleton, said the group
now claims ``tens of thousands'' members who meet in local chapters
around the nation. The society declines to provide exact numbers.
   This year the society moved its longtime headquarters from
Belmont, Mass., and San Marino, Calif., to Appleton, a city of
65,000 on the banks of the Fox River in northeastern Wisconsin. It
operates in a 10,000-square-foot office complex.
   Although communist regimes in Poland, Hungary and other Eastern
European countries appear to be weakening, the society remains
alarmed at the prospect that a new, more dominant socialism will
emerge, financed by misguided U.S. aid, Bubolz said.
   The group contends that while travel restrictions have been
lifted in East Germany and free elections have been allowed in
Poland, most of the recent changes in Eastern Europe are cosmetic.
   The changes have left observers in the West ``euphoric,'' but
Bubolz believes true democracies are unlikely in those countries.
   John McManus, an aide to Bubolz, said the society hopes to
educate Americans about the danger of financing ``the so-called
reforms'' in Eastern Europe.
   The society dismisses the changes initiated by Soviet leader
Mikhail Gorbachev throughout the communist bloc as ploys intended
to disarm the United States and gain economic aid, he said.
   If the United States does not resist the temptation of providing
economic aid to Eastern bloc nations, ``you and I are going to keep
Soviet-style socialism going,'' McManus said.
   ``The communist world is in the greatest economic peril it has
ever faced ... so some desperate and dramatic things are going to
happen to get the financing to keep their things running,'' he said.
   Bubolz said the society's founders anticipated liberalization of
the communist bloc. ``Communism is only a tool of a larger
conspiracy'' to spread a more dominant socialism worldwide, he said.
   ``The end result is one world government and what one world
government means, should it be successful, is the loss of our
national sovereignty,'' Bubolz said.
   McManus said his group will continue to spread its message
through pamphlets, lectures, videotapes and other media.
   ``What we are is an alternate medium of information,'' he said.

<TEXT>
   Guerrillas raided a luxury
hotel before dawn Tuesday, trapping eight U.S. Green Berets who
barricaded themselves on one floor and remained as night fell and
other foreigners were evacuated.
   Red Cross spokeswoman Marie Aude Lude said 17 foreigners were
safely evacuated in the evening following negotiations involving
the Red Cross, the Roman Catholic Church and the rebels
   She said no U.S. military personnel were among those freed.
   ``All the people are over 30, and none of them looks like an
American soldier,'' she said. It was not known how many other
foreigners were still in the El Salvador Sheraton Hotel in the
western part of the capital.
   Knowledgeable diplomatic sources, who insisted on anonymity for
security reasons, said the Americans barricaded on the fourth floor
of an annex to the Sheraton's main building and would spend the
night there. The eight were described as heavily armed Green Berets
from Fort Bragg, N.C.
   A rebel spokesman in Washington listed 15 people he said had
been evacuated from the five-story annex: three U.S. military
advisers, five Israeli military advisers, one German citizen, five
Salvadoran hotel workers and one Guatemalan military adviser.
   The rebel spokesman, Salvador Sanabria, also said on ABC's
``Nightline'' that rebel forces were fired upon by U.S. military
advisers. That could not be confirmed.
   Col. Carlos Aviles, spokesman for El Salvador's military, told
the news program from San Salvador that a Catholic clergyman acting
as an intermediary had arranged for some foreigners to be evacuated.
   Aviles said the military would seek to free those holed up in
the hotel on Wednesday.
   The Americans were barricaded in one or two rooms and controlled
the fourth floor hallway, while the guerrillas were on the third
and fifth floors.
   The army moved tanks and hundreds of soldiers into the western
neighborhood of Escalon to fight the attackers, whose assault
renewed an urban offensive that had appeared to be waning. About
1,000 people have been killed since the offensive, the largest of
the decade-old civil war, began the night of Nov. 11.
   The Bush administration said the United States was ``making
plans as necessary'' to protect the lives of Americans. White House
spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said no options _ including military
ones _ were ruled out.
   State Department spokeswoman Margaret Tutwiler said the
Salvadoran armed forces rescued 20 hotel guests, including several
Americans, from a part of the hotel not penetrated by guerrillas.
No details were given.
   The attack comes one day after President Bush reaffirmed strong
U.S. support for President Alfredo Cristiani's rightist government.
The United States has provided about $3.5 billion to oppose the
insurgency, in which about 71,000 people, mostly civilians, have
died. Fifty-five U.S. military advisers are assigned to El Salvador.
   Soldiers from an armored personnel carrier earlier rescued the
secretary-general of the Organization of American States, who had
been in a different part of the Sheraton when the guerrillas
mounted the attack.
   Joao Baena Soares, the OAS chief, was evacuated from the hotel a
few hours later without incident.
   A government statement said the armed forces had foiled a
guerrilla attempt to kidnap Baena Soares. He made no comment but a
guard answering the phone at the OAS headquarters in Washington
said late Tuesday that Baena Soares was ``OK and he's coming back
(to Washington) tomorrow.''
   Meanwhile, in an apparently unrelated incident, a U.S. Embassy
officer was slightly wounded Tuesday morning when he was struck by
what was described as a stray bullet at his home in the Escalon
neighborhood.
   Embassy spokesman Jeff Brown said, ``It was completely
incidental. He was not on the scene at the time, he was not
involved. He is the only American that was injured in any way today
that we are aware of.''
   Brown said the victim worked for the Agency for International
Development, but there was no immediate identification available.
   One of the six barricaded Americans seen by the AP told
reporters he had been talking with the rebels at one point and that
no shots had been fired, nor would they shoot unless fired upon.
   ``We're here because we don't feel we can leave safely,'' said
the soldier, who declined to provide his name.
   Col. Carlos Aviles of the Salvadoran army said it was unclear
how many rebels remained on hotel grounds overnight.
   One source said there were fears the rebels left behind mines or
booby-traps after slipping away.
   The hotel manager told the AP by telephone there was still
sporadic firing around the building.
   Journalists had to leave the area shortly before the overnight
curfew went into effect at 6 p.m.
   State Department sources said Tuesday night that many of the
guests trapped in the Sheraton, including several Americans, had
been allowed to leave the building in the custody of the Red Cross.
   At 5:30 p.m. (6:30 p.m. EST), a half-hour before the curfew,
Monsignor Gregorio Rosa Chavez, the Roman Catholic auxiliary bishop
of San Salvador, arrived at the hotel for negotiations with the
guerrillas.
   He was accompanied by Francois Musy, head of the International
Red Cross office in El Salvador, and Monsignor Emil Stehe, the
archbishop of Ecuador who arrived in Salvador last week.
   Rosa Chavez asked the army officer in charge of the troops
around the hotel to withdraw the soldiers from the hotel grounds
and he complied. The troops pulled back a half-block.
   Rose Chavez was asked who would be evacuated and he said,
``Everybody comes out.''
   A U.S. source said the military men trapped in the raid on one
wing of the Sheraton, which is no longer part of the U.S.-based
hotel chain, were on a two-week training mission and had been
scheduled to leave Tuesday.
   The six men seen by the AP were in civilian dress and did not
identify themselves as U.S. officers, but carried M-16 rifles and
spoke of having been in Vietnam and of the rules of engagement for
U.S. advisers.
   Citing the rules for U.S. military advisers, one described what
he and his companions did when the building came under attack.
   ``We did not fire,'' he said. ``Those are the rules of
engagement. Unless we're fired upon, we don't fire.''
   Hotel manager Robert Nieuwveld, who took refuge in an
administrative office with three employees, two guests and an AP
reporter, said about 12 U.S. citizens had been among about 20
guests trapped in the rear when the guerrillas took it over.
   The guerrillas issued a statement saying no one was being held
hostage.
   ``The objective is to take Escalon,'' said a guerrilla in charge
of an insurgent position about 80 yards from the hotel. ``We're
taking Escalon because here the armed forces are not going to
bombard people's homes. This is where the oligarchy lives.''

   It's a safe bet that when the Thanksgiving
feast is over, Andy Ross will boast the cleanest wishbone in town.
   After the holiday, Ross is planning to give his family's turkey
carcass to some of his hungry employees at the Smithsonian
Institution's National Museum of Natural History so they can enjoy
the leftovers.
   Ross is chief of the museum's osteological preparation
laboratory, and his employees are hundreds of thousands of tiny
beetles _ all voracious flesh eaters _ that are used to clean the
delicate bones of birds and mammals for the museum's study
collections.
   ``The teacher of my two preschoolers asked her class to save the
turkey bones from Thanksgiving dinner and bring them to school for
study,'' Ross said. ``I made the mistake of telling her I could do
it better.''
   He says his beetles will finish the job in just 24 hours.
   These are no ordinary bugs but beetles of the species Dermestes
maculatas, which are among nature's primary scavengers of carrion.
Not to fear, they turn up their noses at living creatures.
   Ross' lab contains hundreds of thousands of the beetles in a
couple of insulated steel ``bug rooms'' in a museum courtyard. They
spend their brief lives swarming hungrily over the remains of
everything from whale skulls to hummingbird wings in 90-degree heat
and constant darkness.
   When the beetles have picked everything clean, they are given an
unceremonious heave-ho into bug heaven by freezing or fumigation.
After a final gasoline and ammonia bath, the bones are ready for
scholars.
   So far this year, his beetles have helped the museum clean the
bones of 5,500 birds and mammals, keeping up with current
acquisitions and nibbling away at a backlog of skeletons that dates
back 70 years.
   ``They're friendly little things,'' Ross says. ``They can give
you nice, clean skeletons with minimal effort.''
   Although they're always eating on the job and constantly engaged
in office romances, the beetles are model employees in many ways.
   They never complain about long hours or lousy working
conditions. They never demand a raise. Too busy for idle gossip,
they work themselves to death within about three months, but they
are quickly replaced by a younger generation of workaholic
apprentices.
   A few dozen beetles were whetting their Thanksgiving appetites
Monday by chowing down on the bones of a wild turkey in a plastic
box in Ross' office. That started the 37-year-old vertebrate
zoologist to musing about the scientific value of clean bones.
   It was wild turkey, Ross recalled, that the Pilgrims supposedly
shared with their Indian guests at the first Thanksgiving feast in
Massachusetts in 1621.
   If some lucky archaeologists could find a buried garbage heap
from that meal and compare its bones with those of the wild turkey
in his office, Ross said, ``we could tell whether the Pilgrims
really ate turkey or just a big chicken.''

   James Brady, felled by a shot from the same
gun that wounded President Reagan eight years ago, says lawmakers
who don't want handgun controls should ``try being in my wheels for
just one day.''
   In a wheelchair, the former White House press secretary appeared
before a Senate panel Tuesday to push for a bill that would require
a seven-day waiting period before buying a handgun.
   ``I had no choice but to be here today because too many members
of Congress have been gutless on this issue,'' Brady said. ``They
have closed their eyes to tragedies like mine. They ignore the
statistics.''
   It was the first time since Brady was shot in the brain during
the attack on Reagan on March 30, 1981, that the former
presidential spokesman had personally lobbied Congress on gun
control.
   His wife Sarah, who appeared at his side, has become a leading
national speaker on the issue as head of the group Handgun Control
Inc. The bill carries their name as the Brady Bill.
   With a strong voice, Brady said the bill would reduce handgun
violence. He described the impairment he has endured and how it
destroyed his realized dream of serving as Reagan's press secretary.
   ``I experience pain _ pain sometimes so intense I cry,'' he
said. But even that, he said, is less difficult to endure than his
loss of independence.
   ``Those members of Congress who oppose a simple seven-day
waiting period should try being in my wheels for just one day,''
Brady said.
   ``You should know what I go through every day. I need help
getting out of bed, help taking a shower and help getting dressed.
And damn it, I even need help to go to the bathroom.''
   In addition to providing a cooling-off period for buyers of
handguns, the bill would require that gun dealers obtain
identifying information and send it to police, who would check to
see if the purchaser was a convicted felon barred by law from
purchasing a weapon.
   The bill is opposed by the National Rifle Association and by the
Bush administration.
   ``I understand,'' Brady said, ``that many of you are intimidated
by the gun lobby. But you've got to look squarely at the facts.
   ``There are too many cowardly lions walking the halls of
Congress,'' he said.
   The Bush administration says it favors a more limited method for
checking criminal records.
   But Mrs. Brady said the waiting period has proven effective in
keeping guns away from convicted felons in several states that have
their own versions of the law. Illinois, she said, reported
blocking 2,470 applications for gun sales to felons in 1988 under
its 72-hour waiting requirement.
   The bill was strongly opposed by Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, who
charged it would cause ``harassment'' of ``law-abiding sportsmen.''
   Hatch left the hearing before Brady spoke.
   Brady said: ``I don't question the rights of responsible gun
owners. That's not the issue. The issue is whether the John
Hinckleys of the world should be able to walk into a gun store and
purchase a handgun instantly.''
   Hinckley was acquitted by reason of insanity in 1982 for the
shooting of Reagan, Brady, a Washington police officer and a Secret
Service agent.

<HEAD>Euro-Yuppies Seen as New Market for U.S. Products</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Farm Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Alligator steaks in Britain, California wines
in France and Texas-style barbecues in West Germany are part of
what some Agriculture Department observers say is a move by
European yuppies to go up-scale American.
   ``The marketing niche of young, urban professionals, or yuppies,
that originated in the United States has spread to Europe as
well,'' says the department's Foreign Agricultural Service.
   But while sellers in Europe ``are targeting young and affluent
consumers for their upscale consumption and bulging wallets,'' the
agency said it may be a bit early to predict whether U.S. exporters
can benefit significantly.
   Whatever the European country, yuppie food tastes have common
preferences for high quality, convenience and innovation,'' said
Mark Condon, a trade show manager for the USDA agency.
   ``These qualities are part of the market of the future,'' he
said. ``In our upcoming food exhibits in Europe, we have a lot of
the kinds of products that would appeal to yuppies.''
   Those include: low-calorie and low-fat health foods,
non-alcoholic beers, hickory chips for barbecue fires, ethnic
foods, picture-perfect produce, California wines, and foods with no
preservatives or additives.
   ``Europeans are market-savvy people,'' Condon said. ``Items must
be of top quality. They can't be cheap or discounted.''
   The rise of yuppie food interests in Europe is described in the
forthcoming December issue of AgExporter magazine published by the
agency.
   ``As in the United States, the European yuppie market is
small,'' the report said. ``But yuppies are trend setters and
innovators, often the first to try a new food or fashion. Later,
their tastes and preference trickle down to other segments of the
population, gradually being adopted by a broader audience.''
   So it is important to know what European yuppies are currently
consuming, the report added. Their tastes, however unusual some may
be today, could be the general rule tomorrow.
   Dale Good, U.S. agricultural trade officer in Hamburg, said the
appeal of American foods to European yuppies varies from country to
country. For example, in West Germany the products have to be
compatible with German food traditions.
   ``The concept of eating cuisines from other countries is just
emerging,'' Good said.
   But in Italy, the opposite seems to be the case, says U.S.
agricultural counselor for Rome, Frank Piason. The current rage is
for ethnic food, especially Tex-Mex, in the land of pasta.
   ``For the Italian yuppie, the focus is on lighter eating and
less fatty food,'' Piason said. ``The Italian yuppie is likely to
consume pasta salad or rice salad, rather than pasta, during
lunch.''
   Also, U.S. wines are popular with the young Italians, the report
said. That's also the case in France.
   ``While trying to sell U.S. wines in France might seem like
bringing coal to Newcastle, the French are actually fascinated with
U.S. wines,'' said Holly Higgins, who recently completed a two-year
assignment as U.S. agricultural attache in Paris.
   So the ``plugged in group'' in France goes for American wines
and Tex-Mex specialities such as chili and enchiladas, she said.
   Microwave ovens also are gaining in France, the land of the
long-simmering sauce, Higgins said. Changes in lifestyles, more
working women and less time for cooking are changing eating habits.
   David Mergen, U.S. agricultural attache in Madrid, says, ``Yes,
Spain does have yuppies'' and they can be found in the middle of
the day at expensive restaurants close to where they work.
   ``Spanish yuppies prefer to eat dishes that are low in
cholesterol and they also tend to drink lighter alcoholic drinks,''
Mergen said. ``Yuppies drink mineral water and fruit juices. They
drink wine with meals, however, and gin and tonics in the evening.''
   One of Mergen's colleagues, Isabel Pastor, said the opening of
several Madrid restaurants that serve American food has helped
promote awareness of U.S. foods. At least two of the restaurants
have names such as ``Hollywood'' and ``Boston,'' she said.
   In Britain, the preferences of yuppies are also highly varied
and subject to changing moods of style and trend, said marketing
specialist Christine Chapman of the U.S. agricultural trade office
in London. But a few of the ``in'' foods are alligator steaks and
spicy Creole cooking.
   Chapman said organic foods are part of the yuppie menu, along
with foreign items such as surimi, a processed fish product from
Japan, Tex-Mex from the United States, and kedgeree, a dish
originally from India of rice and chopped fish bound together with
egg.
   ``Champagne is high on the list, particularly if it is laced
with black currant juice or wine,'' she said. New World wines from
the United States and Chile are growing in popularity.
   Even conservative Switzerland has a yuppie market, according to
agricultural specialist Hansruedi Bachmann of the U.S. embassy in
Bern. More than the average consumer, the Swiss yuppie is attracted
by U.S. foods, especially California wines.
   ``Swiss yuppies, however, do not eat fast food,'' Bachmann said.
``Instead, they frequent luxury type restaurants with an upscale,
high-quality image.''

<HEAD>WASHINGTON TODAY: Sometimes Presidents Say the Darndest Things</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TOM RAUM</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   When he chats with kids, President Bush
sometimes says the darndest things.
   In what other forum, for instance, would he have revealed that
he showered with pet Millie after the spaniel ``rolled in something
bad?''
   Where else would he give this advice on youthful presidential
aspirations? ``It's fun to dream about stuff.''
   Sometimes his playful banter with groups of children _ for whom
Bush seems to have a special affinity _ may even shed light on the
current state of the presidential mind.
   For example: In giving equal billing to his meeting with Denver
Broncos quarterback John Elway and his upcoming summit with Soviet
President Mikhail S. Gorbachev, Bush seemed to be voicing his
administration's basic ambivalence about the summit _ whether to
talk it up or talk it down.
   Granted, the audience was made up of fifth graders, so the
president tended to over-simplify during a visit this week to
Chicago's Pickard Elementary School.
   The purpose of the visit was to talk about the war against
drugs. But soon the conversation turned to how he liked his job.
   ``Sometimes it feels good and sometimes it feels less good. But
most of the time, it's wonderful because I like my job and I like a
lot of parts of it,'' he said.
   ``You know what I got to do? I got to meet the quarterback for
the Denver Broncos football team, and I know (Chicago Bears coach)
Mike Ditka, and I know some of the others _ so I get some fun stuff
to do in sports.''
   In the next breath he told the kids: ``We're going off to meet
Mr. Gorbachev and in a week or so, you're going to be reading all
about that because it will be in every paper.''
   ``And why are we doing it? Well, we're trying to make the world
a little more peaceful. We want it to be a place where you grow up
that you don't have to worry about having to go off to war.''
   Later, speaking to grownups at a Republican fund-raiser in Rhode
Island on Monday, Bush first declared ``this is going to be a
historic meeting.'
   But, then he softened that considerably: ``I don't want to see
over-promise coming from it.''
   The next day, presidential press secretary Marlin Fitzwater was
asked whether the summit _ which Fitzwater won't even acknowledge
is a summit unless he slips _ was to be historic or not.
   ``This is a historic meeting that we don't want to
overpromise,'' Fitzwater said on his first try.
   On his second pass at the question, he said: ``I think everybody
realizes that it is historic, if only because it's happening in
historic times.''
   Bush, who has five adult children and 11 grandchildren, has no
difficulty getting kids to talk with him.
   At the Chicago session, he was asked ``How did you get to be
president?''
   ``Well, I was in politics a long time and I was in business and
I worked hard,'' Bush said. He recounted his first defeat in
seeking a Senate seat, his unsuccessful 1980 presidential bid and
his eight years as Ronald Reagan's vice president.
   ``And you've got to learn that if somebody says something ugly
about you, don't worry about it. I used to be very worried when I
was much (younger) _ 15, 20 years ago. Somebody said something that
was critical, I would worry about that. I don't worry about that
any more.''
   Bush, a millionaire, was asked, `Are all presidents rich?''
   ``In our history, some didn't have much money at all. And that
... certainly should never be a requirement,'' he said.
   And, oh yes, how was his dog Millie doing?
   ``Oh, she's wonderful. I don't want to say this in front of
anybody, but I had to take her in the shower yesterday and give her
a bath because she rolled in something bad. I mean, really bad.
   ``And so Barbara, my wife, said, `Would you mind giving Millie a
bath?' So even when you're president, you've got to do some stuff
that isn't too good or fun. But when she slept up on our bed last
night, she was very clean and she smelled real clean.''

was released from a Chicago hospital after a six-day stay, a
hospital official said.
   Smith, 91, who had been admitted Nov. 16, was released Tuesday,
said a Resurrection Hospital official who did not give her name.
   A friend, Merton Henry, had said Smith had a digestion problem

   William Shirer finally received his
severence check from the Chicago Tribune _ 57 years late.
   Shirer, author of the classic ``Rise and Fall of the Third
Reich,'' was fired by the Tribune in 1932 in Vienna for mixing up
the name of a woman who had been arrested by Austrian police. He
said the newspaper promised him a month's severance pay and he went
to Spain ``to collect my thoughts.''
   The pay never came, until Tuesday. Two Tribune editors visited
him at his home and brought a $1,250 check.
   They also gave him an honorary Beck award, which, ironically, is
named after the man who fired Shirer, Edward Scott Beck.
   The 85-year-old Shirer, who is working on a book about Leo
Tolstoy, said some of his experiences as a newsman in Europe
working for the Tribune still rankle.
   But he said, ``as time goes by, the bitterness passes. Better

   Rudolf Nureyev will step down as dance director of
the Paris Opera Ballet, a company he helped bring to prominence,
but he's not leaving the group.
   He and company President Pierre Berge announced Tuesday that the
two ``decided mutually'' that the Soviet-born dancer would leave
his post. A statement, though, said he would stay on as ``premier
choreographer,'' a position created for him ``to insure the
presence of his productions at the Paris Opera.''
   Nureyev, 51, had been artistic director since 1983.
   The Paris Opera became almost a soap opera in recent weeks, with
tensions mounting as Nureyev and Berge exchanged charges in the
press.
   Nureyev has been frequently absent. He is touring the United
States with ``The King and I,'' and is scheduled to play the lead
role immortalized by Yul Brenner for two more years.
   Berge is not new to controversy. Last year, he fired Daniel
Barenboim as director of the new Opera-Bastille opera house in part
over his high fees.

   Early American folk art collected by Abby
Aldrich Rockefeller, who delighted in discovering the work of
untrained and unrecognized artistic talent, goes on display today
at the Smithsonian Institution's National Museum of American Art.
   The 182 objects in the exhibit includes portraits, landscapes,
trade and shop signs, weathervanes, whirligigs, toys, pottery,
furniture, quilts and carved figures, most of them produced in the
18th and 19th centuries.
   They are some of the finest works from the collection of more
than 2,600 objects at the Abby Aldrich Rockefeller Folk Art Center,
which opened in 1957 at Colonial Williamsburg in Virginia. Many
objects in the touring exhibition have not been seen outside
Williamsburg for decades.
   The nucleus of that museum, which claims the finest public
collection of American folk art in the world, were the 420 works
bequeathed by the wife of John D. Rockefeller Jr., a founder of the
Museum of Modern Art in New York, who began buying the works of
early, untrained American artists in the 1920s.
   Many of the works were created by craftsmen or self-taught
artists like Wilhelm Schimmel, a vagrant from Pennsylvania's
Cumberland Valley who carved small animals and birds in exchange
for food and drink, and John Brewster Jr., a deaf-mute who earned a
living painting portraits such as ``Boy With a Finch,'' which has
become an icon of American folk art.
   Among the most popular paintings in the show is ``Baby in Red
Chair,'' the familiar image of a smiling, sleeping baby in a high
chair, produced by an unknown early 19th century artist, probably
from Pennsylvania.
   Other pictures are by such widely known early American artists
as Edward Hicks, Erastus Salisbury Field and Ammi Phillips. Four
20th century objects in the exhibit signify the Rockefeller
museum's growing interest in contemporary folk art.
   The Rockefeller exhibit, whose national tour began in New York
last January, will remain at National Museum of American Art
through Feb. 19, and then will travel to museums in San Francisco,
Dallas and Tulsa, Okla.

<HEAD>Publisher Advocates a Press Role in Fighting Drug Problem</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The nation's drug problem is so threatening
that the press must abandon its customary role as a mere observer
and become part of the solution, says Katharine Graham, chairman of
the Washington Post Co.
   ``Some of our reporting can help show ways out of the abyss, and
show some possible solutions to these great problems,'' Mrs. Graham
told a press audience.
   Delivering the Frank E. Gannett Lecture, an annual affair to
which many leaders of Washington's journalism community are
invited, Mrs. Graham said Tuesday night that to prepare the speech
and get a better grasp of the drug scene, she recently went into
the city ``to see some parts of Washington where the crisis is most
severe.''
   ``I can tell you that we have yet to fully appreciate the
far-reaching consequences of drug abuse,'' she said. ``It's not
only a question of violence in the drug-riddled area of the cities.
Indeed, police sweeps have driven much of the overt drug activity
here inside. Much worse is the time bomb ticking away.''
   Mrs. Graham recalled that after the Watergate scandal a friend
told her it was the Post's responsibility to help rebuild faith in
government, but she disagreed. ``Our responsibility is to tell
people what is going on,'' she replied.
   ``I still believe that is true, but today the answer is more
complex,'' she said. ``Certainly it is not the role of the press to
fix the problems of society, and yet we occupy a unique position
that enables us to be part of the solution.''
   She cited the thousands of babies who are born addicted,
diseased or disabled and asked what will happen when they hit the
school system. She noted the thousands of youths whose role models
are drug addicts and who are ``primed for failure.''
   And she said attention must be paid to the ethics of
middle-class whites who participate in the drug culture _ such as
city merchants selling $250 sneakers.
   She quoted one of the Post's reporters: ``We're still just
gawking at the problem.''
   She said the press must take care in telling ``these dreadful
stories'' that the public does not tune out and, along with
reporters, become ``desensitized.''
   Moreover, the press must recognize ``a simmering distrust'' of
the media in the black community and must make sure its reporting
standards and its practices are ``fair and colorblind.''
   But mostly, she said, the press can use its news and opinion
pages to help point to solutions.
   ``I'm not talking about `feel good' stories that gloss over
problems and generalize solutions in vaguely optimistic terms,''
she said. ``I'm talking about substantive reporting on what people
and institutions are doing to cope with and try to overcome the
problems we face.''

<HEAD>Nation's Air Quality Watchdog Finds Foul Air Surprisingly Close</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>

   The Environmental Protection Agency, which
monitors and regulates the nation's air quality, doesn't have to go
far in the search for sick air _ only to its own headquarters.
   The EPA acknowledged Tuesday it has major indoor air pollution
problems after a survey of employees at its headquarters found as
many as 40 percent complain of headaches, dizziness and other
ailments they blame on the air at the office.
   Senior EPA officials promised to move as quickly as possible to
correct the situation and ``make EPA a truly healthful place to
work.''
   Union leaders praised the effort, but noted workers' complaints
about poor office air quality and its unhealthy effects were
largely ignored for years.
   ``EPA employees have a long history of building-related
illnesses and a deteriorating indoor air environment,'' said Bob
Carton, an official of the National Federation of Federal
Employees, which represents some EPA workers.
   Union officials said similar problems can be found in other
offices and are too often ignored.
   ``This same legacy of inattention and neglect (about indoor
pollution) is one that is played out not only at EPA, but in many
other federal state and private sector buildings both in Washington
and around the country,'' said Kirby Biggs, chairman of the health
and safety committee of the American Federation of Government
Employees.
   Many of the EPA health problems have been blamed on poor air
circulation and chemicals alleged to come from carpeting at the
agency's maze of offices over a southwest Washington shopping mall.
   ``Because indoor air quality is an emerging field, we do not
have a scientific baseline to gauge where our facilities rank in
terms of other buildings,'' said Charles L. Grizzle, assistant EPA
administrator for resource management. ``However, we regard the
level of employee health problems reported in the survey to be
unacceptable.''
   Earlier this year, EPA administrator William Reilly ordered a
series of reports on air quality in EPA headquarter offices and the
employee survey of 4,900 EPA employees was the first of the reports
to be made public. Special monitoring for pollutants is underway at
more than 100 locations within the office complex to try to
determine the cause of the problem.
   Eighty-one percent of the EPA's headquarters employees responded
to the questions, including 1,400 workers who added described their
health problems and concerns in greater detail.
   According to the survey, at least 40 percent of the 3,995
workers who responded complained of ailments associated with poor
indoor air quality. These included complaints of frequent
headaches, dizziness, fatigue, mucous membrane irritation and
tearing or itching eyes.
   About 10 percent of the respondents said they experienced such
problems frequently or always when at work and that conditions
improved when they left the EPA offices.
   Concerns about the air quality at the EPA headquarters emerged
in late 1987 when several employees became ill after the agency
began installing 27,000 square yards of new carpeting, union
officials say. Some of those workers still cannot work in their
former offices without becoming nauseous, breaking out in hives or
having breathing difficulty, said Carton, the union official.
   The EPA recently began removing some of that carpeting, which
workers complain is giving off unhealthy chemicals. A
labor-management health and safety committee has been formed to
``identify problems and set priorities for corrective action,''
said Grizzle.

   NBC's ``The Cosby Show,'' seriously
challenged last season by ABC's ``Roseanne,'' has climbed back on
top again in last week's Nielsen ratings.
   ``Cosby,'' repeatedly beaten out by ``Roseanne'' last season,
won for the third straight week and all of NBC's Thursday comedies
were in the top 10.
   ``Roseanne,'' running fourth in recent weeks, was pre-empted
last week by the second part of the ABC miniseries ``Small
Sacrifices.''
   ``Small Sacrifices,'' starring Farrah Fawcett as an Oregon woman
convicted of shooting her children, placed second.
   The first part was 12th in the previous week's ratings.
   NBC was first for the week with an average rating of 16,
according to the A.C. Nielsen Co. ABC had 13.2 and CBS 11.7. Each
point represents the percentage of the nation's 92.1 million homes
with televisions.
   In the season-to-date, NBC leads with 15.1, followed by ABC's
13.5 and CBS's 12.4.
   NBC also leads in the November sweeps, which helps determine an
affliate's advertising rates. The ratings: NBC 15.5, ABC 12.6, CBS
12.0.
   Fox Broadcasting Co. had its highest Sunday rating for regular
programming with 8.1. A one-hour ``America's Most Wanted'' special
came in ahead of ABC and NBC in the 8-9 p.m. time slot. It was
48th, while ``Married ... With Children'' tied for 41st place.
   The Top 10: NBC's ``The Cosby Show,'' ABC miniseries ``Small
Sacrifices'' Part II, NBC's ``A Different World,'' NBC's
``Cheers,'' NBC's ``The Golden Girls,'' CBS' ``60 Minutes,'' NBC's
``Empty Nest,'' CBS' ``Murder, She Wrote,'' NBC's ``Dear John'' and
ABC's ``The Wonder Years.''
   The first part the CBS miniseries ``Till We Meet Again'' lost
out to its Sunday competition, NBC's ``Perry Mason'' movie. It was
in a three-way tie for 24th place, while ``Perry Mason'' was 17th.
   The miniseries, based on the novel by Judith Krantz, beat ABC's
Sunday telecast of the feature film ``Outrageous Fortune,'' which
tied for 37th place.
   The ``Midnight Caller'' episode last Tuesday starring Kay Lenz
in a reprise of her Emmy-winning role as an AIDS victim, came in
50th. It was up against the last hour of ``Small Sacrifices.''
   ABC's ``World News Tonight'' maintained first place among the
evening news shows. The ratings: ABC 11.2, CBS 10.7, NBC 10.1.
   The lowest-rated show of the week was CBS' ``Wolf.''

<TEXT>
   The mood was triumphant on
Wenceslas Square as more than 150,000 people gathered to hear
banned playwright Vaclav Havel and other leading dissidents report
on their first-ever meeting with authorities.
   It was the opposition leaders' first address to the masses after
12 long and lonely years of campaigning for human rights.
   Havel, 53, Czechoslovakia's best-known dissident, excused his
brevity with the quip that if he said everything he wanted to, they
would be standing in freezing temperatures until the microphones
were turned off.
   But the Rev. Vaclav Maly, a Roman Catholic priest, summed up the
mood when he told them, ``We are grateful to all of you that we can
speak at this thrilling, exciting time, pregnant with expectation.''
   He spoke Tuesday just after the opposition posted a big
breakthrough: a meeting with Communist Premier Ladislav Adamec.
   The city was electric with excitement and the tension was
palpable because of widespread rumors that police planned a major
crackdown on demonstrations following Monday's march through Prague
by about 200,000 people.
   Students hurriedly distributed leaflets appealing to the
population to stay calm and steer clear of any provocations.
   Grabbing bowls of soup or food provided by sympathetic citizens,
students at the DAMU acting school _ one of the centers of a
student strike _ hammered furiously at typewriters and shouted
orders to each other.
   Outside, a large national flag and a banner with the words, ``If
not now, when? If not us, who?'' fluttered in the breeze.
   Curious passers-by, many wearing ribbons in the national colors
of red, white and blue, clustered at the windows of scores of
shops, restaurants and offices plastered with protests and
petitions denouncing Friday's brutal police attack on peaceful
students calling for democratic change.
   It was the brutality and the example of the tumultuous changes
in East Germany, until last month the closest ally of Prague's
hard-line government, that provided the long-awaited spark for mass
pro-democracy protests in Czechoslovakia.
   The Wenceslas Square rally was haunted by the presence of those
who were not there: Communist leaders whose resignation was loudly
demanded, and at least 30 political prisoners.
   ``As long as there is a single political prisoner, we cannot
talk about a fundamental change in the political climate,'' said
Milan Hruska, a miner who helped found the new Civic Forum
opposition movement and the only worker to speak. So far, there has
been little involvement by workers in the protest movement.
   Maly read an emotional appeal by Cardinal Frantisek Tomasek for
everybody to work for change.
   ``We must be free to elect a government that will be for us, not
against us,'' the 90-year-old cardinal said in the message. His
words provoked a roar of ``Free elections! Free elections!'' from
the tightly packed crowd.
   An almost eerie silence settled over the vast square before the
crowd followed Marta Kubisova, an officially banned folk singer and
heroine of the 1968 movement, in an emotional rendition of the
national anthem.
   Thousands raised their fingers in the V-for-Victory sign.

<HEAD>Escrow Agent Charged With Embezzling $5.6 Million from HUD</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JENNIFER BRANDLON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BALTIMORE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Prosecutors say charity began at home for the
woman known as Robin HUD, who was charged with stealing $5.6
million from the Department of Housing and Urban Development and
claimed she gave much of it to the poor.
   Former escrow agent Marilyn Louise Harrell was indicted by a
federal grand jury Tuesday on fraud and embezzling charges in one
of the most prominent cases stemming from the HUD scandal.
   Testifying before congressional committees investigating
mismanagement and political favoritism at the agency during the
Reagan administration, Harrell admitted taking money she was
supposed to hold in escrow for the government.
   Federal authorities said Tuesday she spent most of the money on
herself, her family and her friends, buying 40 cars, making house
payments and purchasing a $2,500 TV console and other items.
   ``The single largest charity by far was herself,'' said
Breckinridge L. Willcox, U.S. attorney for Maryland.
   ``She gives charity a bad name,'' HUD Secretary Jack Kemp told
reporters.
   Harrell, 46, was charged with embezzling $5.6 million from HUD,
making false statements to the federal government and making false
statements in connection with a loan application. If convicted, she
could be fined up to $1 million, sentenced to up to 22 years in
prison and ordered to make restitution.
   Attorney General Dick Thornburgh said the case appeared to be
the largest single theft of government funds charged against an
individual.
   ``Oh, Lordy, Lordy,'' Harrell said when informed of the
indictment. She said her attorney advised her to plead innocent.
   ``Most of what I gave to my family was my own money, money that
I had legitimately earned,'' said Harrell, who is now unemployed
and working on a book about herself. ``I don't understand why they
want to make it sound like I am such a terrible person.''
   Harrell is one of a dozen escrow agents suspected of keeping
more than $10 million from the sale of homes whose owners defaulted
on government-insured mortgagages. She is the second of the agents
to be charged.
   Two weeks after she testified in Congress, HUD seized her house
in Washington's Maryland suburbs as well as several other
properties she said she purchased with HUD money to help charities
and homeless families.
   According to Willcox, about $625,000 of the embezzled funds have
been recovered from Harrell. ``I'm not sure there's a whole lot
left,'' he said.
   Willcox said Harrell has cooperated with investigators.
   By her own accounting last June, Harrell spent $1.35 million to
buy and rehabilitate 16 homes for needy families, $810,000 on
salaries for ex-criminals employed by her construction company,
$450,000 in donations to seven charities, $368,000 on payments and
insurance for 40 cars given to individuals and charities, and
$300,000 for a shelter being built by Maryland Suburban Rescue.
   Charlotte Chepaitis, who worked with Harrell to take care of
poor people in Baltimore, denied prosecutors' statements that
Harrell was merely helping herself.
   ``They don't know what they're talking about when they say Mrs.
Harrell never did anything to help the poor,'' she said. But she
added that Harrell did not require an accounting of her money.
   ``We didn't keep any books,'' Chepaitis said. ``The books was
kept only by God. He carried the pencil and paper, and Jesus said,
`Do your alms in secret and the Father in heaven will reward you.'''
   Several members of Congress have accused the Justice Department
of failing to aggressively prosecute HUD-related crimes.
   The department's statement announcing the indictment indirectly
responded to such criticism, noting that the government had
obtained 140 HUD-related convictions nationwide in fiscal 1989 and
nearly 600 in the last four years.
   Most of those cases have involved individuals charged with
defrauding HUD loan programs. Congressional critics have said
Thornburgh shows little zeal for investigating former top agency
officials and prominent Republicans who participated in HUD
programs found to have been tainted by political influence.
   Thornburgh has rejected the criticism as partisan sniping.

<HEAD>Talks Break Down, Sandinistas Seek Summit</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Nicaragua's government is planning to call for
an emergency meeting of Central American presidents following a
breakdown in cease-fire talks between the Sandinistas and the
Contra rebels.
   The negotiations were suspended Tuesday night after the Contras
refused to go along with a Sandinista demand for a partial
withdrawal of rebel forces to base camps in Honduras.
   That was the leftist government's price for agreeing to a
cease-fire but the Contras declined to go beyond a pledge not to
infiltrate more troops from base camps in Honduras.
   The chief Contra negotiator, Col. Enrique Bermudez, blamed the
Sandinistas for suspension of the talks, saying the rebels were
willing to continue efforts to work out an agreement.
   But an American negotiating for the Sandinistas, Paul Reichler,
said that when the talks reconvened Tuesday afternoon at an
Organization of American States office, ``everybody realized we had
come to an impasse. Nobody suggested we keep talking.''
   The talks were convened Nov. 9, eight days after President
Daniel Ortega suspended a cease-fire that had been in effect on an
informal basis for 19 months. Ortega said the Contras had been
engaging in widespread terrorist activities.
   The Contras and the State Department warned Ortega might be
laying the groundwork for postponing national elections set for
Feb. 25. But Ortega has insisted the elections will take place as
planned.
   Tuesday morning, Tinoco issued what he called a major
concession, dropping a previous demand for the total withdrawal of
Contra forces and insisting that about 2,300 _ about half the
estimated total in Nicaragua _ pull back to the base camps in
Honduras.
   But the Contras maintained that a withdrawal of forces to a
neighboring country had no precedent in any cease-fire negotiation.
With adequate U.N.-sponsored verification, the Contras maintained,
the peace could be assured without a rebel withdrawal.
   Tinoco insisted a ``separation of forces'' was necessary to
avoid the type of situation which has prevailed in El Salvador,
where all cease-fires have been short-lived.
   He said the Contra refusal to withdraw troops to Honduras
``shows they are not interested in peace.'' He also criticized the
State Department for doing ``absolutely nothing'' to facilitate an
agreement.
   In calling for the withdrawal of 2,300 Contras to Honduras,
Tinoco said that is the number of rebels who have infiltrated into
Nicaragua over the past several weeks.
   Contra spokesman Bosco Matamoros insisted there was no Contra
infiltration, only a ``rotation'' of forces. But earlier this
month, the State Department confirmed an infiltration had indeed
taken place.
   Mediators from the Organization of American States and the
United Nations issued a statement Tuesday night saying they will
remain in contact with both sides so they can reconvene the
discussions ``at the earliest date.''
   After the talks broke down, Reichler said the Sandinistas may
demand the Honduran government expel the remaining rebels from the
base camps the Contras have been using for years.
   ``They (the Hondurans) have a legal obligation to do that
anyway,'' Reichler said. More than 6,000 rebels are at the Honduran
camps, sustained by U.S.-supplied food, shelter, clothing and
medical services.
   Combined with the escalating violence in El Salvador, the
suspension of the talks cast doubt on the future of the Central
American peace process.
   At their most recent meeting, last August, Central American
presidents called for the demobilization of the Contras by Dec. 5,
and there was some optimism at the time that a peaceful settlement
might be reached.

<HEAD>Stocks Hit Another Record High, Dollar Dips</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The key index on the Tokyo Stock Exchange achieved
another record-high closing Wednesday, while the dollar ended lower
against the Japanese yen.
   The dollar closed at 143.88 yen, down 0.55 yen from Tuesday's
144.43-yen finish. It started at 143.75 yen and ranged between
143.73 yen and 144.00 yen.
   The 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average gained 227.05 points, or 0.63
percent, ending at 36,286.92, yet another high. It had added 166.29
points for a record closing at 36,059.87 the previous day.
   Nikko Securities dealer Yutaka Yoshino attributed the index's
strength to improved external factors, including the yen's
stability on the foreign exchange market.
   An overnight rise in the Dow Jones industrial average of 30
major issues in New York also encouraged Japanese investors to buy,
he said.
   Among winners were food, pharmaceutical and trading house
issues. Yoshino said shares related to East-West trading also
attracted participants after news reports that Japan's Sanyo
Electric Co. will export videocassette recorders to East Germany.
   In currency dealings, the dollar-yen rate was moving narrowly
after the yen edged higher on overseas markets, where West German
marks rose against the dollar, traders said.
   Although the dollar remained weak against the major European
currencies, Japanese investors showed strong demand for the dollar,
said a trader with major commercial bank, speaking anonymously.

<HEAD>Bush Signs Bill Cutting Star Wars Funds</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Bush says he signed the $286 billion
military spending bill despite disappointment that it includes the
first budget reductions in the Star Wars missile defense system.
   The bill the president signed late Tuesday provides $3.8 billion
in fiscal year 1990 for Star Wars, also known as the Strategic
Defense Initiative, and less than the administration requested for
the B-2 stealth bomber program.
   Working from a stack of legislation approved by Congress as it
rushed to leave town for the year, Bush also signed:
   _A measure to guarantee reparations to Japanese-Americans
interned in U.S. camps during World War II. The provision, part of
a $17.2 billion appropriation for the State, Justice and Commerce
departments, contains no money for the estimated 60,000 camp
survivors but says up to $500 million would be provided as an
``entitlement'' in 1991.
   Congress has authorized $20,000 for each survivor, a total of
$1.2 billion.
   _A ban on smoking on virtually all domestic airline flights, an
expansion of current rules forbidding passengers from lighting up
on routes lasting two hours or less. The new regulations take
effect 96 days after signing, which would be Feb. 25.
   _A $44 billion spending bill for agriculture, rural development
and other programs, including soup kitchens for the homeless and
funds for the Food and Drug Administration's fight against AIDS.
   _The $157 billion labor, health and education appropriations
bill, stripped of abortion provisions that prompted a veto earlier.
   _The $3.4 billion District of Columbia appropriations bill, also
stripped of abortion provisions to which the president objected and
which led to yet another earlier veto.
   The defense bill provides $1.1 billion less than Bush requested
for this year for the Star Wars program, the first budget reduction
in the program in its six-year history.
   Bush said he was disappointed by the cut and expressed hope that
Congress would support the administration's future requests.
   The measure provides $4.3 billion for two B-2 stealth bombers,
$430 million and one plane less than the administration sought in
the fiscal year that began Oct. 1.
   The money also will be used for some advance procurement costs
for five planes to be bought in fiscal 1991 and for spare parts.
   Approximately $1.1 billion is included for the 10-warhead,
rail-based MX and the single-warhead, truck-based Midgetman nuclear
missiles.
   The amount is about $150 million less than the administration
requested for the two weapons and includes House language imposing
a 50-missile cap on the MX.

<HEAD>Robert Fulghum: The Life Worth Living is Worth Imagining</HEAD>

<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SEATTLE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Robert Fulghum sometimes tells strangers he's a
nun or a taxidermist with a fondness for bears, not the
best-selling author he is.
   Fulghum, wrapping up a promotional tour for the book ``It Was on
Fire When I Lay Down on It,'' said fellow airplane passengers
invariably ask him, ```What do you do?''' He often doesn't give a
straight answer.
   The 52-year-old author of two books of short, inspirational
essays that top The New York Times' list of best-selling
non-fiction, has been dreaming up stories since he was a boy.
   It's a way to keep your mind alive, he said Tuesday.
   ``What I like to do is engage my seatmate in a game of
imagination,'' said Fulghum, who has been traveling frequently
these days. ``For the rest of the flight we pretend to be something
we always wanted to try being.
   ``Once I was a nun. That was great. From San Diego to Phoenix
yesterday I was a taxidermist,'' he recalled telling one fellow
passenger, a systems analyst who confessed he always wanted to be a
plumber.
   Today's creative thought often has been the start of something
big for Fulghum, a former Unitarian minister who lives on a
houseboat within view of Seattle's skyscrapers.
   His first book, ``All I Really Need To Know I Learned In
Kindergarten,'' made the Times' list three weeks after it was
published last year. About 1.25 million hardcover copies are in
print and 1.5 million in paperback.
   ``It Was On Fire'' was published in September and quickly pulled
into second place on the Times' list behind the conversational
``Kindergarten.''
   The new book's title comes from a newspaper story that described
the rescue of a man from a smoldering bed. When rescuers asked how
the fire started, the man said, ``I don't know. It was on fire when
I lay down on it,'' Fulghum wrote.
   He said the man's answer was a ``life-story in a sentence. Out
of the frying pan into the hot water.''
   The first book came about in a roundabout way.
   After attending a Unitarian seminary in Berkeley, Calif.,
Fulghum decided to revise his philosophy. He whittled a 400-plus
page statement of beliefs to a list he read at a private school
anniversary in Seattle.
   Daniel J. Evans, a U.S. senator from Washington at the time, was
in the audience. He liked it so much he read it into the
Congressional Record.
   The list spread. A church bulletin in Kansas City, Mo.,
published it. The Kansas City Times ran a copy. Friends sent
mimeographed copies to friends.
   And a Connecticut teacher sent a copy home with her class. One
student's mother, a literary agent, contacted Fulghum to see if he
had more observations on life.
   Fulghum had boxes.
   ``The first time I saw his manuscript was on a Friday
afternoon,'' said Diane Reverand, executive editor and vice
president at Villard Books, Fulghum's publisher.
   ``I was working late and picked it up. I read the first essay
and had a visceral reaction,'' Mrs. Reverand said. ``We bought it
on Monday.''
   What sold Mrs. Reverand and millions of readers is the way
Fulghum makes life seem simple.
   ``These are complicated times. Everyone feels overwhelmed,''
Mrs. Reverand said. ``But he gets us back to basics. There's a
comfort to his message that things aren't as complicated as they
seem to be.''
   One example is the lesson of the sandbox: share everything, be
fair, don't hurt others, don't hit, put things back where you found
them, clean up your own mess.
   Fulghum, born in Waco, Texas, led a lonely life where making up
stories became a way to pass time in his strict Baptist home.
   During the late 1950s, he lived as a beatnik and studied Zen in
a Japanese monastery. But he discovered he already knew what he
needed to know.
   When the book promotion is done, Fulghum will head to a quiet
place in Utah with a reading list that includes Italian novelist
Umberto Eco, a couple of guides to sharpening knives, and a book of
Milton Berle's 10,000 best jokes.
   ``My own books are letters to a friend. They're meant to be read
that way,'' Fulghum said. ``When people ask me what I do I never
answer `writer.' I'm not like Faulkner. ... I'm more of a letter
writer.''
   Fulghum fans can expect to see another book of essays once he's
finished campaigning for the re-election next year of a friend,
Rep. Jim McDermott, D-Wash. But they won't see Fulghum's one-liners
on coffee cups or T-shirts.
   ``I had to turn 'em down,'' he said. He also turned down a
television production company that was planning a situation comedy
based on his life. John Denver would have played him.
   And what of the proceeds of his books? He said he'll turn them
over to his children, who are all married, in exchange for a
regular salary when he turns 55.
   He didn't want to discuss his earnings. Ivy Books reportedly
paid $2.1 million for paperback rights to ``Kindergarten.'' The
price was a record for a non-fiction book.
   ``Fame and fortune can destroy happiness,'' he said. ``I was
happy before all this started and with any luck I'll survive it.''

<HEAD>Broadcasters Say TV Coverage Of House Of Commons A Hit</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MICHAEL WEST</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The camera work won't win any awards and the plot
dragged a bit, but the first television coverage of the House of
Commons won generally favorable reviews today.
   The cameras took the first peek Tuesday at proceedings in
Parliament's lower house, the start of a controversial eight-month
experiment.
   The British Broadcasting Corp., Independent Television News and
Sky Television all reported calls from satisfied viewers.
   The first televised session was a debate on a speech given
earlier Tuesday by Queen Elizabeth II in the House of Lords. The
queen outlined proposed legislation that Prime Minister Margaret
Thatcher's Conservative government will introduce in the coming
year.
   The queen's speech, an annual event carried out amid colorful
pageantry, is written by the government of the day. The House of
Lords, which has had TV cameras since 1985, is the unelected upper
chamber of Parliament.
   Independent Television News said in a statement: ``The (Commons)
pictures are fairly stiff but not as bad as we might have feared.
Most of the viewers who have called us said they liked it although
one man from Dagenham said it sent him to sleep.''
   Tony Hall, head of news and current affairs at BBC-TV, said the
live coverage from the eight remote-control cameras was exciting
and lively. But he added: ``We still don't have the full flavor of
the House because of the restrictions imposed on us, but we were
pleased.''
   The BBC expects big ratings for Tuesday's program but said
official viewing figures will not be known for at least a week.
   The Times said in an editorial: ``For the great majority who
have never seen the Commons at work ... the first opportunity to
see the Commons as they are made riveting television.''
   The 650-member Commons, which voted 318-264 in February 1988 to
allow television coverage, has appointed an independent company to
operate the cameras and sell the pictures to the BBC and other
broadcasters.
   Mrs. Thatcher was among those who opposed letting the cameras
in, saying she feared for the good reputation of the House, which
is often disrupted by noisy scenes.
   The House has ruled that when proceedings get rowdy the cameras
must shun the disturbance and focus on House Speaker Bernard
Weatherill.
   Wide-angle shots are allowed at other times, but the House has
said for the most part cameras should go for head-and-shoulders
shots of the legislator speaking at any one time.
   Reaction shots are forbidden unless a legislator is specifically
referred to by the member speaking at the time.
   British news reports noted that a brawl on the floor of the West
German Parliament can be freely shown and that President Mikhail S.
Gorbachev's Soviet Parliament, like others in the Eastern bloc,
give broadcasters more leeway than does the Commons.
   The BBC noted in news reports that television has come to the
Commons 30 years after its introduction in West Germany and 10
years after cameras were first allowed in the U.S. House.
   The U.S. Senate has had the cameras since 1986.
   Radio broadcasting from the Commons began 14 years ago and
newspaper reporters were first let into the House 218 years ago.
   The first televised speech from the Commons was by Conservative
legislator Ian Gow, who to loud shouts of ``Hear, hear'' from
supporters said: ``I have always voted against the televising of
the proceedings of this House and I expect that I always will.''
   But Weatherill, who approves of the cameras, said in a BBC
interview Tuesday that he hoped television would ``show the House
of Commons at work as it really is.''

   Congress yielded today to the complaints of
many older Americans and voted to repeal a far-reaching Medicare
expansion designed to protect retirees against being bankrupted by
a catastrophic illness.
   Republican lawmakers said President Bush will sign the repeal.
   By voice vote this morning, the Senate accepted a House demand
that the law be repealed. The House had restated its position by a
346-55 vote Tuesday night.
   Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., who had tried to salvage parts of the
program, called the votes ``a victory for the nation's seniors''
because an income surtax on higher-income retirees was repealed.
But he expressed disappointment that valuable benefits also were
lost.
   Senate Majority Leader George J. Mitchell, D-Maine, decried the
votes. ``By repealing the legislation, we haven't repealed the
problem,'' he said. Congress must return next year to deal with the
problems of ``the aging of the population of this country and the
growing need for health care,'' Mitchell said.
   Rep. Henry Waxman, D-Calif., an author of the original law but
backer of repeal, seemed to agree. ``The only sensible thing for
Congress to do ... is repeal it and come back next year and figure
out something on catastrophic that the elderly want and they are
willing to pay for,'' he said.
   The surtax on higher-income retirees, which was the target of
most of the complaints against the program, would be repealed
retroactive to Jan. 1, the date it took effect. The $4-a-month
special premium that most Medicare recipients are paying would
remain in effect through Dec. 31.
   The extended hospital coverage that has been available to
retirees this year would expire at year-end along with liberalized
skilled nursing care. Scheduled limits on out-of-pocket expenses
for doctors' bills and prescriptions would die before taking effect.
   When Congress returns on Jan. 23, said Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah,
``We'll be listening to our constituents' horror stories about
seniors being forced out of hospitals because we have repealed the
extended hospital-care benefit.''
   ``We are going to see on the first of the year whopping
increases in medigap insurance premiums,'' predicted Rep. Willis
Gradison, R-Ohio, referring to the private insurance policies that
many older Americans have bought to provide coverage beyond regular
Medicare benefits.
   Some insurance companies have predicted those private policies
could cost up to $25 a month more when the catastrophic benefits
are wiped out.
   The far-reaching expansion of the Medicare program was enacted
last year with broad support in both parties. But many retirees
began flooding Congress with complaints after learning that the 5.6
percent with the highest incomes would have to pay the surtax of up
to $800 a year.
   Other complaints came from seniors who already had private or
employer-provided policies protecting against catastrophic expenses.
   Senators yielded to repeal only after the House rejected the
Senate's final proposal. It would have repealed the surtax but used
the monthly premium to pay for limited hospital coverage and a
package of minor benefits, including mammograms, home health care
and hospice care.
   Repeal would leave many of the 32.8 million retirees without
insurance coverage or finances to pay hospital, doctor and drug
bills associated with a major illness.
   Under the catastrophic law, a retiree hospitalized for 150 days
this year, for example, has to pay only $560, even if there were
two or more separate hospital stays. Without catastrophic
protection, the out-of-pocket bill would be $21,560 for one stay _
and even more for multiple stays.
   Repeal would wipe out these major benefits:
   _Hospital: A $560-a-year limit on out-of-pocket hospital
expenses. Patients would be liable for co-insurance on part of a
stay, and for separate deductibles for multiple stays in a year.
   _Doctors' fees: Starting in 1990, a ceiling of $1,370 on
out-of-pocket expenses. Repeal would leave the voluntary Part B
coverage, which older Americans buy with a monthly premium. But
regular Part B has no limit on out-of-pocket expenses.
   _Drugs: Starting in 1991, 60 percent of drug costs after the
patient pays $600 a year out of pocket. The share would rise to 80
percent in 1993.
   _Nursing: Up to 150 days a year of skilled care in a nursing
facility after patient pays a daily rate of $25.50 for eight days.
Regular Medicare covers far less and only after patient has spent
at least three days in a hospital.

<HEAD>New Math at Nation's Food Banks: Deposits Down, Withdrawals Up</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MITCHELL LANDSBERG</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Deposits of surplus food at the nation's food banks have
declined this year as the ranks of bank patrons _ the poor and
hungry _ continue to grow.
   The federal government and private corporations are donating
less food to private charities than in the past, according to food
bank officials in several cities.
   At the same time, said Kevin Fagan, director of development for
the Greater Philadelphia Food Bank, ``There's no question that
demand is just flying through the ceiling.''
   Food bankers blame the decline, in part, on a frenzied pace of
corporate takeovers that have left food industry executives glued
to the bottom line and less concerned about the needy.
   ``I think corporations are not as generous as they have been in
the past,'' said Rodney Bivens, executive director of the Oklahoma
City Food Bank, where contributions were down 41 percent by the end
of September.
   Donations have picked up slightly since then, Bivens said, but
are far from meeting the rising demand for food. ``The reality is,
the agencies that we serve end up giving out less,'' he said.
   Once, a poor family might have been able to count on a loaf of
bread with sandwich meat in its weekly food bag from a charitable
organization. Now, Bivens said, the bag may contain two loaves of
bread _ but no meat.
   Donations to the Philadelphia organization are down at least 15
percent from last year.
   ``The ultimate loser is, obviously, the most needy of us all,''
said Fagan.
   The organization is fairly typical of the 200 food banks that
have sprung up around the nation since the first one was
established in Phoenix in 1967.
   About half its food comes from Second Harvest, a Chicago-based
distributor of surplus food that is the largest single supplier for
most food banks. Second Harvest collects products that are
considered unmarketable by major corporations because they are
mislabeled, underweight or overweight, too close to an expiration
date, discontinued or repackaged.
   The rest of the bank's donations come from local sources:
supermarkets, manufacturers, charitable organizations or private
individuals.
   The food is distributed to a network of local organizations that
are involved, in one way or another, with feeding the needy.
   Although some food banks say their local contributions remain
steady, all have been hurt by the first year of decline at Second
Harvest since the organization was founded more than 10 years ago.
Corporate contributions are expected to be down 16 percent this
year from last.
   The decline would be even larger, Second Harvest officials say,
were it not for a spurt of corporate charity following Hurricane
Hugo and the Northern California earthquake.
   The federal government used to supply a substantial portion of
the food given out by private organizations, but that amount has
been shrinking, too. Second Harvest officials say they received 172
million pounds of surplus government food in 1987, but half that
amount in 1988 and this year.
   The U.S. Department of Agriculture estimates it will distribute
239 million pounds of food to charitable organizations this year,
down from 272 million pounds the previous year.
   The main reason for the decline, USDA spokesman Phil Shanholtzer
said, is a sharp drop in the amount of surplus dairy products, in
part because of a change in federal price support payments.
   The president of Second Harvest, Philip R. Warth Jr., said the
change hit food banks hard. After that, he said, the drop in
corporate support was ``a downturn coming on the heels of a bigger
downturn.''
   Warth said the slowdown in the corporate spigot is partially due
to the merger mania that has swept the food industry in recent
years. But he refused to say which companies have become less
generous; food bankers are acutely sensitive about biting the hand
that feeds their clients.
   ``We still consider the nature of our relationship to be very
much a partnership, so our task is to very gently tug on the
coattails of the industry,'' Warth said.
   The directors of several food banks did name some companies
that, they claimed, have been donating less since being purchased
by other corporations. Among those named repeatedly were Pillsbury,
General Foods, Kraft and Nabisco.
   But officials at three of those companies _ all but Kraft _
denied that they were giving less; those at Pillsbury and General
Foods said they were giving more. A spokeswoman for Kraft, which
merged with Philip Morris last year, said she didn't know how much
the company was giving Second Harvest.

<TEXT>
   The army ousted five soldiers from an elite
combat unit and stripped an officer of his command after a
20-year-old soldier committed suicide, reportedly because he was
hazed by his comrades.
   The shakeup in Givati Brigade came after Saturday's suicide of
Eli Shahar, a brigade sergeant.
   Maj. Gen. Matan Vilnai, head of the army's southern command,
decided the five soldiers ``are no longer worthy of serving in the
Givati brigade,'' the army said in a statement on Tuesday.
   The army said Vilnai removed Shahar's company commander from his
post and reprimanded a senior officer, who served as a regiment
commander. The five soldiers ousted from Givati are being
investigated by the military police, the statement said.
   The suicide brought criticism from legislators and warnings that
the harsh methods used to put down the 23-month Palestinian
uprising were creeping into soldiers' behavior towards each other.
   Shahar shot himself at a base in the Israeli-annexed Golan
Heights on Saturday. The Givati brigade is often assigned to quell
riots in the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip. Shahar reportedly
had asked for reassignment.
   Israeli newspapers reported that the suicide was triggered by
harassment from fellow soldiers during a mock trial staged to
punish Shahar for removing his helmet during target practice.
   Legislator Sarah Doron of the right-wing Likud bloc urged that
steps be taken to prevent similar hazing incidents.
   ``We have to ensure that such an ugly and dangerous thing
doesn't happen again,'' she said in a letter quoted by the Yediot
Ahronot daily.
   Initial findings of the army probe published by two newspapers
Tuesday show the soldiers roused Shahar from sleep for the mock
trial after being ordered by the company commander to give him a
``motivation lecture.''
   The unit commander entered the tent during the trial and brought
it to an abrupt halt, the Maariv daily said.
   But the officer then reportedly ordered Shahar punished by
serving two hours' guard duty wearing a helmet. It was after the
order that Shahar shot himself.

   An errant rocket skipped
off the ground and knocked down a 115,000-volt power line,
scattering debris across a highway and sparking a small brush fire,
authorities said.
   Traffic on U.S. 70, which crosses the range, had been halted
before Tuesday's midday test, and there were no injuries or other
damage. But the debris briefly delayed the road's reopening, said
Jim Eckles, a White Sands spokesman.
   Three rockets were launched during a test of the Multiple Launch
Rocket System, Eckles said. One hit the ground and skipped,
knocking the wire from the crossbars of five wooden towers, he
said. A brief brush fire was started by the live wire, he said.
   Jon Samuelson, spokesman for Plains Electric Generation and
Transmission Inc., said the wire runs about 70 miles from near
Truth or Consequences to Alamogordo in southern New Mexico. Crews
were sent to repair an undetermined amount of damage, he said.

<TEXT>
   The Tokyo Stock Exchange's key index rose to yet
another high today, while the dollar declined against the Japanese
yen.
   The 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average gained 227.05 points, or 0.63
percent, closing at 36,286.92. It had reached the previous record
of 36,059.87 on Tuesday, when it gained 166.29 points.
   The dollar closed at 143.88 yen, down 0.55 yen from Tuesday's
144.43-yen finish. It opened at 143.75 yen and ranged between
143.73 yen and 144.00 yen.
   Traders said exchange market players merely were adjusting
dollar-holding positions, buying the dollar as it approached the
day's low.
   Yoshitsugu Hanada, a Mitsui Bank trader, said there was active
selling of yen to buy West German marks, and this helped push down
the yen's rate against the dollar in late trading.
   ``It is more difficult for market players to reverse a trend in
the West German mark-yen trading than in that of the dollar-yen. To
make the yen stronger, the market needs strong dollar-selling
incentives to weaken the U.S. currency,'' he said.
   ``But market players have little incentive to sell the dollar
now,'' Hanada added.
   Spot trading volume was estimated at $6.46 billion, up from
$3.77 billion Tuesday.
   Meanwhile, Bank of Japan Governor Satoshi Sumita will step down
on Dec. 16 at the end of his present term, Finance Minister Ryutaro
Hashimoto announced Wednesday.
   Hashimoto told a news conference that Sumita would be succeeded
by Yasushi Mieno, senior deputy governor at the central bank.
   On the stock exchange, the market's main barometer continued to
rise following an overnight increase in the Dow Jones industrial
average in New York, dealers said.
   Nomura Securities analyst Masahiro Nomura said the yen's higher
opening against the dollar also reassured Japanese investors.
   Share buying was encouraged by optimism that Japanese interest
rates would decline before long, he said.
   Among gainers were steel, electric power plant and shipbuilding
issues. An estimated 900 million shares changed hands on the first
section, up from Tuesday's 800 million.

<HEAD>Congress Passes HUD Reforms</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Both houses passed and sent to the president
early today a package of reforms for management of the Department
of Housing and Urban Development, legislation that grew out of the
multibillion-dollar scandals that have rocked HUD.
   Both houses acted by voice vote.
   The package includes HUD reforms proposed by Secretary Jack Kemp
and by both House and Senate housing subcommittee members that
arose from congressional investigations of the department's fraud,
influence-peddling and political favoritism scandals.
   The action came after a House panel last week stripped away a
larger proposal to revamp federal housing programs. Some Democrats
had hoped to keep the two linked as a way to force congressional
action on the housing program revision, but they relented and
agreed to push through the reform package alone before Congress
ended its session for the year.
   The bill requires that consultants and lobbyists working on HUD
programs register with the department and identify for whom they
are working, as well as any fees they receive. Recipients of HUD
grants would have to report their use of consultants and lobbyists.
   HUD would be required to publish notices of funding availability
and application procedures, selection criteria and other
information, including any waivers of regulations, as a way to
prevent subsidy awards based on insider information.
   Other provisions would:
   _Create a new HUD chief financial officer's position, as well as
a comptroller of the Federal Housing Administration, to oversee
financial management.
   _Apply new restrictions on the Section 8 moderate rehabilitation
program, which provided subsidies for renovating low-income housing
that were at the heart of evidence of influence-peddling and
political favoritism in the HUD scandals.
   _Make it illegal for consultants to sell their influence in
securing housing subsidies for a contingent fee or a per-unit fee,
as occurred during the Reagan administration.
   _Strengthen the secretary's ability to enforce new HUD laws with
civil money penalties against developers, consultants, applicants
and mortgage lenders. It would restrict the secretary's ability to
use discretion in awarding housing assistances.
   The Senate deleted a proposal by Kemp to require a greater focus
on antipoverty uses for awards made under the Community Development
Block Grant program. It also deleted a prohibition against FHA
loans for vacation homes or investment homes. Provisions to protect
the inspector general from dismissal and to give him the power to
subpoena were deleted in the House.
   The Senate also added provisions that extend many of the HUD
reforms to the Farmers Home Administration, which oversees rural
housing programs and is under the Department of Agriculture.

   The Senate gave final congressional approval
early today to legislation that would require $180 million in
anti-drug money be targeted for local school districts and
disadvantaged communities.
   The Senate approved the measure by voice vote in a post-midnight
session after the House passed the legislation _ also by voice vote
_ Tuesday night. The measure went to the White House.
   The amendments to the Drug Free Schools and Communities Act
would provide emergency grants to areas with high rates of drug
arrests, convictions and other indicators of abuse.
   Model alternative schools could be established to provide
educational opportunities to students expelled under anti-drug
programs, so they wouldn't become dropouts.
   Money given to states could be used for drug testing of student
athletes, and drug-free school zones would be authorized as
demonstration programs.
   In order to receive assistance, local educational agencies and
colleges must impose a program to prevent drug use by students and
employees. School districts would have to include comprehensive
anti-drug programs from the elementary grades through high school.
   The legislation includes a provision preserving the authority of
state and local educational agencies to determine curriculum,
textbooks and course content _ language to avoid undue federal
intrusion into local education.

<HEAD>Radiation Threatens Aircraft Shutdown During Landings</HEAD>

   Radiation from a powerful radar system built
to detect submarine-launched missiles could endanger virtually all
military aircraft landing at a Georgia air base, the Air Force has
concluded.
   Sen. Sam Nunn, D-Ga., asked the Air Force last year to assess
the danger posed to aircraft by the PAVE PAWS radar system two
miles south of Robins Air Force Base. He released a letter Tuesday
that outlined the Air Force conclusion.
   The letter, from Brig. Gen. Burton R. Moore, said review of the
effect of phased array radar on electro-explosive devices, or EEDs,
found that any aircraft with such devices could be endangered.
   EEDs are tiny explosive charges used, among other things, to
trigger weapons systems and ejection seats, or to jettison bombs
and fuel tanks. They normally are detonated by an electrical
circuit, but they also can be set off by high levels of
electromagnetic energy from radio waves, radar emissions, static
electricity or lightning.

encourage similar moves by the Soviet Union.
   In a study to be published soon by the Brookings Institution,
William H. Kaufmann, a Harvard University lecturer who was an
adviser to former Secretaries of Defense Robert McNamara and Harold
Brown, argues that the United States could safely reduce its
current defense budget of $305 billion to $160 billion by 1999.
   Draft copies of his report began circulating as a Pentagon

<DATELINE>CARSON CITY, Nev. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Nevada legislators voted unanimously to
erase a 300 percent pension increase they gave themselves last June
and hope voter outrage that forced the repeal will fade by the 1990
elections.
   Gov. Bob Miller signed the pension repeal bill two hours after
getting it from lawmakers who met Tuesday in a two-hour special
session that set a record for its brevity. Assembly Democrats asked
the governor to convene the session.
   ``It's over,'' Miller said. ``The action is in the best
interests of the taxpayers of the state because the possibility of
future payments at that inflated 300 percent level no longer
exists.''
   The Democratic governor said he wasn't trying to salvage any
political careers in the Legislature by calling the session to
repeal the increase that he had vetoed earlier in the year.
Legislators overrode the veto the same day.
   Miller said his concern was the potential expense of ``millions
over the years'' unless the benefits were reduced.
   Under the increase, pensions for the part-time lawmakers rose
from $25 a month per year of service to $100 a month per year of
service.
   Representatives of the citizens lobbying group Common Cause led
the fight against the increase, circulating a petition to put the
issue on the 1990 ballot.
   ``I'm really feeling good today,'' Common Cause spokeswoman
Leola Armstrong said as the increase was canceled.
   Despite the repeal, legislative leaders conceded voter outrage
that led to the session may come back to haunt them next year.
   Democratic Assembly Speaker Joe Dini said the pension increase
will remain ``a campaign issue that hurts everybody who voted for
it.''
   Dini said the low pay for part-time lawmakers still should be
raised. The legislators draw about $12,000 in pay and various
expense money for about six months of work every other year.

<TEXT>
   Beijing's main art museum has opened an exhibit
called ``Baptism of Blood and Fire,'' an array of artwork
glorifying the military assault that crushed the pro-democracy
movement.
   The China Art Gallery show of 113 paintings, photographs,
sketches, cartoons and works of calligraphy is the government's
latest effort to justify June's quelling of what it calls a
``counterrevolutionary rebellion.''
   The exhibit includes several paintings of wounded soldiers, one
of whom shouts ``I'm for the people, the people are for me'' as he
is helped through the smoke and fire of the June turmoil by a
sympathetic citizen.
   Another with a similar depiction of a soldier dripping blood has
the inscription ``the blood of this soldier awakened the people.''
   Ink sketches, paintings and photos show soldiers painting fences
and watering plants in the capital, washing clothes together with
women citizens and giving haircuts to Beijing residents.
   Another painting has a young girl drawing a sketch of an armed
soldier, and a poster shows a similar armed soldier with doves
flying in the background and the inscription ``he guards the people
of the capital.''
   A work of calligraphy reads ``the army and the people are as
fish and water.''
   One cartoon shows a character with a grotesque mouth shaped like
a loudspeaker spitting out a tape on which is written ``Voice of
America.''
   The U.S. government-run VOA has been denounced by the government
for its reports on the pro-democracy movement. VOA has been accused
of aiding those attempting to overthrow the government.
   The government propaganda campaign began immediately after the
June 3-4 military attack on student-led demonstrators in which
hundreds, perhaps thousands of people were shot and killed.
   State-run television repeatedly broadcast tapes of people
throwing rocks and attacking military vehicles and showing the
charred, mutilated bodies of soldiers burned and killed.
   Bookstores have sold similar videos and photo albums, all
depicting mob brutality and the heroic deeds of the military but
editing out all evidence that soldiers opened fire on unarmed
crowds of people.
   The Beijing Daily today said the city was coming out with a book
that would ``expose the evil doings of elites during the turmoil.''
   It said the book would show how people such as dissident
scientist Fang Lizhi, who is now hiding in the U.S. Embassy in
Beijing; and political scientist Yan Jiaqi, who fled the country
after June, fanned rebellion, plotted the overthrow of the
government and promoted bourgeois liberalism.
   The largest exhibit on the rebellion opened at the Military
Museum in August and drew more than 600,000 people in its first
month, mostly students and workers bused in to receive the
government's version.
   The art exhibit, which opened Tuesday, was more low key, with
most of the viewers being students and young people who had
wandered in after visiting other shows in the gallery.
   One university student said he found the exhibit ``very
educational,'' but most were noncommittal or shied away when asked
what they thought of the art work. An attendant told reporters they
were not allowed to ask questions.
   Despite the barrage of propaganda praising the military, many
Beijing residents, particularly those who joined the spring
demonstrations, in private express strong resentment toward the
People's Liberation Army and its role in the violent suppression of
the pro-democracy movement.
   Martial law remains in effect in Beijing, although most military
guards were replaced by armed police at the beginning of this month.

   Congress adjourned for the year early
Wednesday after a nearly all-night session in which it approved a
$14.7 billion deficit-reduction bill and repeal of Medicare
coverage of long-term medical care for the elderly.
   On a pair of quick voice votes that belied the preceding months
of partisan battling on both issues, the Senate sent both measures
to President Bush, who was expected to sign them.
   ``The end product is one I think we can take some pride in,''
Senate Budget Committee Chairman James Sasser, D-Tenn., told his
colleagues as they began considering the budget cutting bill at
about 1:45 a.m.
   About an hour earlier, the House voted 272-128 to approve the
deficit bill.
   After the vote, House leaders made their traditional
end-of-session telephone call to President Bush, who was asleep
when the 12:47 a.m. call was made.
   ``We've had a good session,'' House Majority Leader Richard
Gephardt, D-Mo., told the president. House Speaker Thomas S. Foley,
D-Wash., and Minority Leader Bob Michel, R-Ill., also spoke of
lawmakers' accomplishments, while Michel added apologies for
``waking you up at this ungodly hour.''
   Bush was roused again, however, at 3:48 a.m. when Senate
Majority Leader George Mitchell, D-Maine, and Republican Leader Bob
Dole of Kansas telephoned him to report the chamber's work was
finished.
   ``When all the dust settles, I think you had a pretty good
session of the whole Congress,'' Bush told the two leaders.
   The Senate adjourned for the year at 4:07 a.m., while the House
followed 24 minutes later.
   Earlier in the evening, the House _ as it has been doing for
weeks _ insisted that Medicare benefits for elderly people with
long-lasting diseases be completely repealed. Lawmakers rejected
Senate language retaining parts of the program by 346-55, and voted
by voice to eliminate the entire program.
   The Senate decided to finally accept repeal, rather than return
to their districts to face seniors angry over the surtax they must
pay to support the initiative.
   Lawmakers also became embroiled in a conflict with the Bush
administration over whether the executive branch's foreign policy
powers should be restricted.
   The House stripped language offensive to the White House out of
a bill authorizing State Department operations for the next two
years and sent the new bill to the Senate hopes of finishing the
measure before adjournment. But the legislation became the victim
of a jurisdictional dispute between committees and will await
action next year.
   The measure contained a provision stemming from the Iran-Contra
scandal providing criminal penalties if the administration
pressured foreign governments into carrying out policies that break
American law. The administration believed the language could tie
its hands in discussions with other governments.
   And they passed a series of other measures, ranging from Senate
approval of a resolution condemning violence in El Salvador to
House adoption of a measure proclaiming National Drunk Driving
Awareness Week.
   Debate on a $14.7 billion deficit-reduction bill for the current
fiscal year was delayed as lawmakers worked out differences on the
final shape of the measure.
   Congressional leaders and the Bush administration had agreed to
the deal in negotiations that ended in Tuesday's early morning
hours. But they had to spend nearly 12 hours preventing stray
provisions _ such as an effort to put the Fairness Doctrine
requiring broadcasters to give equal time to differing viewpoints _
from finding their way into the measure.
   The deficit-cutting package contained some actual savings as
well as some only on paper, such as shifting the money-losing
Postal Service off the budget. It also relies heavily on
across-the-board cuts triggered last month by the Gramm-Rudman
deficit-reduction law, a mechanism most legislators see as an
unthinking way of shrinking federal spending.
   The day began with a rhythm that has become familiar to Capitol
denizens in recent days: little action on the floors of both houses
but many closed-door meetings to hammer out final deals.
   Layered over that was an atmosphere often observed in the
closing days of school: a tangible restiveness to go home for the
year, which leaders promised would occur if the deficit-cutting and
Medicare bills were completed.
   ``People have made up their minds,'' said Rep. Jack Buechner,
R-Mo. ``They have their families packed up in cars and they're
ready to go home for Thanksgiving.''
   The deficit-reduction package culminated a year of turmoil that
started with a much-heralded budget pact between Congress and the
White House.
   But that degenerated into bitter partisan fighting over
President Bush's ill-fated attempt to slah capital gains tax rates.
Because of the gridlock, the Gramm-Rudman law chopped $16.1 billion
from most federal programs Oct. 1, excluding Social Security and
many other benefits.
   Democrats and Republicans agreed that the deal worked out met
Bush's demands for $14 billion in legitimate savings. White House
spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said the president considered it ``an
excellent bill.''
   It lets the Gramm-Rudman cuts stay in effect until early
February, producing savings of $4.6 billion. Over the entire 1990
fiscal year, which began Oct. 1, the reductions would cut domestic
programs by 1.5 percent and defense spending by 1.4 percent.
   The package also raises $6 billion in new taxes, most levied on
corporations. Of the total, $2.7 billion comes from speeding up
payroll, gasoline and aviation tax collections, a step the
administration insists is merely an accounting gimmick netting no
real new revenues.
   Another $400 million comes from including deferred compensation
_ such as the earnings some employees place into 401(k) retirement
plans _ in the formula that determines the amount of wages subject
to Social Security taxes. That could require workers in the $50,000
range to pay Social Security tax on slightly more of their earnings
beginning in 1990.
   Reductions in Medicare, mainly cuts in payments to doctors and
hospitals, would save $2.8 billion. Cuts in deficiency payments for
corn and other crops would save $235 million, boosting Nuclear
Regulatory Commission fees would raise $54 million and extending a
1 percent fee for Veterans Affairs housing loans would net $169
million.
   On the more questionable side, the package claimed savings of
$1.7 billion for ignoring the Postal Service's projected losses and
$700 million by stretching out retirement payments to federal
workers.
   In their other undertaking, lawmakers set about rolling back
catastrophic care benefits for 33 million senior citizens that were
enacted last year with broad popular support.
   The cheers turned to boos this year when many older Americans
began complaining about the surtax imposed to pay for the benefits.
That tax peaked at $800 for the most well-to-do 40 percent of
senior citizens.
   As enacted in 1988, the benefits covered long-term doctor and
hospital bills, prescriptions and minor expenses such as
mammography and hospice care.

<HEAD>Pilot Will Appeal Murder Verdict in Wife's Death</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A man who authorities said put parts of
his slain wife's body through a wood-chipping machine has been
convicted of murdering her. He plans to appeal the conviction.
   An attorney for Richard Crafts said after the verdict was
announced Tuesday that he would argue in the appeal that publicity
about the case _ including a recently published book _ deprived the
defendant of a fair trial.
   ``He's calm. He does wish for us to appeal. And he still
maintains he's innocent of this crime,'' said Crafts' attorney,
Gerard Smyth.
   The defense argued that Craft's Danish-born wife, Helle, may
still be alive. The former flight attendant hasn't been seen since
Nov. 18, 1986.
   The prosecution never produced a body, and submitted as evidence
only three-quarters of an ounce of human remains it claimed were
those if Mrs. Crafts.
   Crafts, a 51-year-old former airline pilot, appeared unemotional
with his hands clasped behind his back when the verdict was read
after a nine-week retrial.
   Sentencing was set for Jan. 8. Murder carries a sentence of 25
years to 60 years, which is considered a life term in Connecticut.
   The pretrial publicity included numerous media stories about the
first trial, which ended last year in a mistrial, and a book about
the case, ``The Woodchipper Murder,'' by Arthur Herzog, that hit
the bookstores in October.
   ``When you take all those things together, it's difficult to say
none of those things affected the outcome,'' Smyth said.
   The appeal also will focus on jury selection and the narrow
conditions under which the jury could have convicted Crafts of the
lesser crime of manslaughter, Smyth said.
   Crafts' first trial in New London ended in a mistrial last year
when one juror, after 17 days of deliberations, held out for
acquittal.
   The Norwalk jury took less than three days to convicted Crafts.
   The prosecution alleged Crafts killed his wife at their Newtown
home late Nov. 18 or early on next day, cut the body with a chain
saw and used a rented wood chipper to dispose of some of the pieces
in a stream.
   The evidence included bits of bone, a fingernail, hair samples
and other body parts recovered from the site. Witnesses testified
that they saw a man using a wood chipper on a bridge during a
rainstorm Nov. 20, 1986.
   The defense argued that none of the body pieces could be
identified conclusively as Mrs. Crafts', and that without a body
the jury had to find Crafts innocent.
   But State's Attorney Walter Flanagan said the evidence taken
together revealed a carefully crafted plot to kill Mrs. Crafts and
get rid of the evidence.
   He alleged that Crafts couldn't stand the thought his wife
wanted a divorce, and described Mrs. Crafts as a devoted mother of
three who wouldn't simply abandon her family, as the defense
suggested.

<HEAD>Production Under Way on Soap Opera About Homosexuals</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WESTMINSTER, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Production is under way on a soap
opera called ``Secret Passions,'' with homosexual characters and
story lines, and it will be marketed to cable TV stations, its
producer says.
   ``It's going to be a very realistic portrayal,'' producer David
Gadberry said. ``We're going to show how it hurts when two gays
break up. ... We'll have kissing and people in bed together, but
we're more suggestive than explicit.''
   Gadberry said the daytime serial will pull no punches despite
its production in conservative Orange County, where voters in one
city earlier this month rejected a gay-rights ordinance.
   The show will be set in the imaginary city of Orangethorpe,
Orange County, and the story will revolve around recent real-life
county events such as violent clashes over a homosexual pride
festival in Santa Ana and Irvine voters' removal of protection for
homosexuals in an anti-discrimination law.
   The soap also will include a character named the Rev. Arthur
Dimsdale, a conservative minister who preaches that homosexuals are
devils.
   ``I wonder who that could be,'' said the Rev. Louis Sheldon, an
evangelical Presbyterian minister who heads the Traditional Values
Coalition.
   Sheldon said the show is going to make the inner workings of his
opponents' lifestyle regular TV fare.
   ``They're promoting the homosexual lifestyle if they're bringing
a soap opera on cable television throughout the nation and the
city,'' he said.
   Randall Murphree of the conservative American Families
Association in Mississippi said his group would closely monitor the
show's development.
   The association has succeeded in past boycotts against product
sponsors who advertise on shows containing what the group deems
material offensively violent, too sexually oriented or hostile
toward organized religion, Murphree said.
   Gadberry said he got the idea for the show about a year ago when
a relationship ended.
   ``Gays are stereotyped in the media,'' Gadberry said. ``Whenever
you see them on television shows, they're evil or something bad
happens to them. We're going to try to achieve a better balance.''

<TEXT>
   The 27-year-old adopted son of actress Jill
Ireland died from an accidental mixture of lethal drugs, the
coroner has ruled.
   The type and quantity of drugs won't be disclosed for another
week, but Jason McCallum had a history of abusing heroin, cocaine,
morphine and alcohol.
   ``He died of acute multiple drug intoxication, administered by
ingestion and injection,'' Bob Dambacher of the Los Angeles County
Medical Examiner-Coroner's office said Tuesday. ``It is listed as
accidental.''
   McCallum was found dead Nov. 7. After his burial, Miss Ireland
said she thought her son had shaken his drug habit.
   She adopted Jason while she was married to actor David McCallum,
known for his role as agent Illya Kuryakin in the 1960s television
series ``The Man From U.N.C.L.E.''
   Miss Ireland and David McCallum were divorced in 1967, and she
married actor Charles Bronson a year later. Jason was one of seven
children Bronson and Miss Ireland raised.
   Miss Ireland, 54, is fighting cancer.

<HEAD>Zaikov Removed as Moscow Party Boss, Named Deputy Defense Council
Chief</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN-THOR DAHLBURG</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A hard-line Communist who served as party boss in
Moscow for the past two years has been replaced in the powerful
post.
   Lev N. Zaikov, 66, was named President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's
top deputy on the Soviet Defense Council.
   Party officials called the move a promotion for Zaikov, a member
of the ruling Politburo member. But the new job also means Zaikov,
who many Muscovites say has become increasingly unpopular, will not
have to run in local elections this winter and risk defeat.
   Zaikov assumed the Moscow party post in November 1987 after
Gorbachev engineered the firing of Boris N. Yeltsin, who had
objected to the slow pace of Gorbachev's economic and social
restructuring program.
   Zaikov's two-year tenure coincided with dwindling food supplies
in state-run stores, and he was blamed by some Muscovites for a
host of ills ranging from filthy streets to the shortage of
detergent and soap.
   According to the official news agency Tass, Zaikov's replacement
``is connected to his appointment to the post of first deputy
chairman of the Defense Council of the U.S.S.R.''
   Tass said Zaikov received the ``gratitude'' of the Moscow party
committee that voted in plenary session to replace him, indicating
he was leaving in official good graces.
   Yuri Prokofiev, 50, who as second party secretary in Moscow had
been Zaikov's deputy, was elected his successor by secret ballot,
beating two other candidates, Tass said.
   It said Gorbachev attended the meeting, indicating the Kremlin
leader accorded high importance to the personnel switch.
   In his functions as president, Gorbachev chairs the Defense
Council, a little-known body that helps formulate national defense
policy and whose membership was long a virtual secret.
   Gorbachev in July disclosed for the first time that the role of
the Defense Council had been enhanced, and said the body was being
restructured.
   He hinted he planned to make the Defense Council the main body
that decides Soviet military policy in the future, and Zaikov's
appointment to a post that previously had never been mentioned
publicly may be a step in that direction.
   Zaikov has experience in military-related matters, since he
served under Gorbachev as the party's top official overseeing the
defense industry and from 1983 to 1985 as party chief in the
Leningrad region, an armaments industry center.
   One of the most powerful officials in the Communist Party
apparatus, Zaikov has supported the policy of promoting scientific
and technological progress, but has called for strict limits in the
party's drive for ``glasnost,'' or greater openness in society.
   This spring, Yeltsin and Zaikov's party apparatus clashed in the
country's first contested elections in seven decades. Yeltsin was
seeking the Moscow-wide seat in the new Congress of People's
Deputies.
   Muscovites showed their support for Yeltsin, giving him 89
percent of the vote against the party machine candidate, the
director of a Moscow automobile and truck works.
   As party chief in Moscow, Zaikov would have been expected to run
in the March 4 elections for the city's governing council. Many
Muscovites had predicted Zaikov's defeat, which under party policy
could have led to stripping him of his party post.
   However, a secretary at the party committee in Moscow's Frunze
district rejected a Western reporter's suggestion that Zaikov had
been ousted because of sagging popularity.
   ``Oh no, you can't be more mistaken,'' she said by telephone.
``He wasn't fired. Far from it _ he was promoted.'' A duty officer
at city party headquarters also said Zaikov had received a ``higher
position.''

   Does Mount Rushmore need a facelift?
   In an effort to answer that and other questions, a helicopter
will hover beside Mount Rushmore National Memorial next week as
engineers photograph cracks and other rocky wrinkles in the aging
60-foot-tall presidential faces.
   ``This is the first time that a total structural analysis has
ever been done,'' Mount Rushmore Superintendent Dan Wenk said
Tuesday. ``We hope it will give us some long-term knowledge with
which to manage this great resource.''
   Late sculptor Gutzon Borglum carved the faces of George
Washington, Thomas Jefferson, Abraham Lincoln and Theodore
Roosevelt a half-century ago from a granite peak in the Black Hills.
   The engineering study is part of a $40 million project to spruce
up the memorial for its 50th anniversary in 1991 and to preserve
the Shrine Of Democracy for future generations.
   ``One of the things that Gutzon Borglum recognized when he
carved the mountain was that there were a number of cracks,'' Wenk
said. ``We've never known the long-term impact of those cracks.''
   Each fall, workers seal the cracks with a mixture of granite
dust, white lead and linseed oil to lessen the damage when cool
weather causes the rock to contract. The engineering study will be
used to develop a more comprehensive maintenance plan, Wenk said.
   ``We want to find out what the structural integrity is and what
we can do if there is a problem,'' he said.
   The study is being conducted by RE-SPEC Inc., a Rapid City
engineering firm. Staff geologist Tim Vogt said the company is
using a technique called photogrammetry, or measuring with
photographs.
   ``What we're doing is making a very detailed precision map of
the sculpture area,'' he said. ``Once we have that very detailed
map ... we can determine the structural stability of the mountain.''
   If weather permits, engineers on Monday will chart reference
points on the faces with black markers 15 inches in diameter.
Close-up photographs will be taken Tuesday.
   ``The faces will look funny for a couple of days,'' Vogt said.
He said the entire structural analysis should be completed by
summer.
   Mount Rushmore isn't in immediate danger of disintegrating, Vogt
said.
   ``The Park Service is just doing their job to make sure there's
no long-term degradation.''
   Vogt said an engineering project of Mount Rushmore's scale is a
challenge.
   ``It's a unique application of an engineering problem,'' he said.
   At least one piece of Mount Rushmore lore stems from the cracks
in the granite faces.
   ``President Jefferson's likeness appears to be looking at a
higher plane than the other presidents,'' Wenk said. ``The romantic
view of that situation is that Gutzon Borglum saw him as a
visionary. The reality is that there was a crack in the granite
that ran through Jefferson's nose. Borglum had to keep tilting the
head back in order to ensure that the crack would not cause the
sculpture to fail prematurely.''
   The $50,000 first phase of the structural analysis is being
funded by the Mount Rushmore National Memorial Society, a private,
non-profit group formed 60 years ago to support and promote the
monument. A drive is under way to raise $40 million for the entire
improvement project.

<HEAD>Suit Allowed for Failing To Preserve Car</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BOB EGELKO</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SAN FRANCISCO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Owners of a car damaged in a crash can be
sued for failing to keep it as evidence, a state appeals court said
in a ruling that one judge predicted would make the state a ``giant
junkyard.''
   In a 2-1 decision released Tuesday, the 1st District Court of
Appeal said the owners had a duty to preserve the car if they
should have known it was needed by an opposing party in the case.
   The ruling reinstated a claim by Solano County against the
family of Brian Delancy, driver of a car that overturned in August
1985, injuring Delancy and a passenger.
   The passenger, Faith Lynn Owens, sued Delancy, his parents, E.W.
and Katherine Delancy, and the county, blaming the crash on
careless driving, negligent entrustment of the car to the youth,
and an unsafe road.
   The county, seeking to reduce its own damages, then filed a
claim against the Delancys, saying the car had been defective.
   The county said it should be entitled to reimbursement from the
Delancys because the family had destroyed the car before the
original suit was filed, allegedly after inspecting the car and
finding defects.
   Superior Court Judge Richard Harris dismissed the claim based on
car's destruction.
   But the appeals court disagreed.
   The opinion by Justice James Perley said the county was entitled
to seek reimbursement for any harm it suffered if it could prove
the Delancys either knew or should have known that the car was
needed as evidence when they destroyed it.
   In a dissenting opinion, Justice Carl Anderson said the ruling
would impose a burden by forcing owners to preserve wrecked cars
indefinitely, without having been sued or notified of the need to
keep the car intact.
   ``The owner of all wrecked cars will now be forced to store the
wreck (or drive the partly damaged car without repair) for an
intolerable period of time,'' Anderson said. ``What little
landscape our ever-encroaching `civilization' has left will hence
forward be transformed into one giant junkyard.''
   Perley, joined by Justice Marc Poche, dismissed Anderson's
prediction as hyperbole.
   The Delancys could have fulfilled any duty they owed by writing
to the county and saying they planned to destroy the car on a
certain date unless the county took over the cost of preserving it,
Perley said.
   ``The `intolerable burden' we supposedly place on parties in the
Delancys' position is no more than the cost of copying and
postage,'' Perley said.

<TEXT>
   A class-action lawsuit by five blacks is
challenging as unconstitutional a Boston police practice of
stopping and searching suspected gang members and their friends on
sight.
   Others claim the tactic is a valuable weapon against crime in an
inner-city area plagued by nine slayings in less than a month.
   The lawsuit filed Tuesday alleges officers searched one man
merely because he wore a New York Giants cap and T-shirt _ clothing
associated with a gang of the same name _ and forced another to lie
in a puddle of urine.
   The Suffolk Superior Court lawsuit was filed by two adults and
three teen-agers against the city and nine police officers on
behalf of blacks and Hispanics ages 15 to 30 who live, work or
travel through a section of Boston that police call Area B.
   The area _ the neighborhoods of Roxbury, Mattapan and part of
Dorchester _ has seen a steep increase in the past year in violent
crime that police blame on drugs and gang disputes.
   In May, police announced they would conduct on-the-street
searches of known or suspected gang members and people associated
with them.
   The lawsuit argues the practice violates the Fourth Amendment
protection against unreasonable search and seizure. It seeks an end
to the practice and unspecified money damages for the plaintiffs.
   Police spokesman Jim Jordan declined to comment on the lawsuit
but referred reporters to a earlier memorandum by Police
Commissioner Francis Roache explaining the policy.
   The memorandum reminds officers that the policy is to protect
constitutional rights. But it also noted that police may stop
anyone reasonably suspected of criminal activity.
   ``Simply stated,'' Roache's memo said, ``this means that if an
officer observes activity, which based on his training and
experience leads him reasonably to suspect, on grounds that he
could explain, that a person has, is or is about to commit a crime,
the officer may briefly detain that person to investigate.''
   He continued, ``This detention may be based on less than
probable cause, but reasonable suspicion is more than a hunch or
mere suspicion, or good faith belief.''
   Police Superintendent Paul Evans, in charge of patrol officers,
said Tuesday the origin of the controversy was nine slayings in 24
days that left officers in Area B perplexed.
   ``Frustrated commanders announced what they called a
`search-on-site' policy, it never translated as a department(-wide)
policy,'' Evans said. ``It was only meant to be a warning to youth
gangs with guns. ... There's a lot of guns out there.''
   As for the cases cited in the lawsuit, Evans said police are
aware of the need to observe civil rights. ``We're not correct 100
percent of the time, but as to an unconstitutional policy violating
people's rights, that's not the case at all,'' he said.
   The lawsuit, prepared by the Civil Liberties Union of
Massachusetts, outlines experiences of the plaintiffs in recent
police encounters.
   One plaintiff, Rolando Carr, 30, a demolition worker, was shot
and wounded by an officer on Oct. 10 while walking down a road in
the public housing project where he lives. The lawsuit alleges that
Carr, who is recovering from his wound, was searched after he was
shot but that police failed to find evidence of a weapon or
criminal activity.
   Another plaintiff, Kenneth Lowe, 25, a sheetmetal worker from
Everett, was searched at gunpoint a month earlier, forced to lie in
a puddle of urine and made to take off his shoes and pull down his
trousers and underpants, the lawsuit alleges. Police told him he
was being searched because he wore the New York Giants T-shirt and
cap, according to the lawsuit.
   None of the plaintiffs belonged to a gang or associated with
gang members and no charges were ever filed as a result of the
searches, said attorney Margaret Burnham.

<HEAD>Defendant Weeps at Testimony About Crash that Killed 27</HEAD>

   The defendant in the nation's deadliest
alcohol-linked crash wept in court as witnesses described children
being rescued from a burning bus in a wreck that killed 27.
   Relatives of the victims also were in tears Tuesday over
testimony in the trial of Larry Mahoney, who is charged with 27
counts of murder, drunken driving and numerous other crimes in the
May 14, 1988, crash.
   Mahoney's small pickup truck was traveling the wrong way on
Interstate 71 when it collided with the former school bus, which
was carrying members of a church youth group back to Radcliff, Ky.,
from a Cincinnati-area amusement park. Three adults and 24 children
died of smoke inhalation and 12 others were seriously injured in
the nation's deadliest crash allegedly caused by drunken driving.
   Mahoney, 36, had appeared sad but maintained his composure since
jury selection began Nov. 8.
   Witness Roy Weeks testifed that while driving on Interstate 71
with his wife, Vicki, he dodged a vehicle going the wrong way. Mrs.
Weeks turned to watch the tail lights, and a few moments later saw
the fire.
   ``The flames lit things up like floodlights,'' Mrs. Weeks said.
   When Weeks, one of the first to reach the scene, described an
injured girl ``calling for her dad and crying,'' relatives of the
victims began crying in the courtroom.
   Before long, Mahoney also was sobbing softly, his face in his
left hand and his shoulders gently heaving.
   The sight of Mahoney in tears appeared to unnerve some jurors,
but prosecutor Paul Richwalsky said he wasn't worried the Carroll
Circuit jury would be swayed.
   ``There is sympathy on both sides. There is emotion on both
sides,'' Richwalsky said. ``They jury recognizes that ... and
they're supposed to put it aside.''
   The trial resumes Monday for Mahoney, of rural Owen County, who
is charged with 12 counts of first-degree assault and 41 counts of
wanton endangerment in addition to murder and drunken driving.
   Other witnesses Tuesday included one of Mahoney's friends,
Taylor Fox, who said he knew Mahoney had been drinking a few hours
before the 10:55 p.m. crash.
   At one point that night, Mahoney asked Fox to go with him to the
town of Burlington to see a girlfriend, so Fox offered to drive and
took the truck keys, Fox testified.
   ``I thought, ``He's been drinking and he doesn't have no
business being on the road,''' Fox said. ``I planned to take him to
Burlington, anyway, so I just took the keys.''
   Mahoney later changed his mind and said he was going home, Fox
said. Mahoney promised to go straight home, ``so I give him his
keys back,'' Fox said.
   ``I'd say he was drunk,'' Fox said.
   But under questioning from Summers, Fox said he saw Mahoney
drink only one beer. He also said Mahoney wasn't staggering or
slurring his words.
   Fox also was less specific about offering to drive Mahoney to
Burlington, saying he ``probably'' made the offer.

<HEAD>Buck Helm Mourned as Loving Father; First Death Claim Paid</HEAD>

   Buck Helm, the dock clerk who
survived four days in the rubble of a freeway flattened by the
Northern California earthquake, was remembered at his funeral as a
loving friend and father.
   Helm's ex-wife, Lorrie, and their son Marc wept arm-in-arm
Tuesday as they read eulogies at an open casket service lasting
less than three minutes.
   Lorrie Helm said between sobs, ``The pain of our loss is great.
But the memory of his love will give us strength to go on.''
   Helm, 58, died Saturday of respiratory failure, 28 days after
his rescue from the collapsed stretch of Interstate 880 in Oakland,
where he was trapped in his car for 89 hours.
   Also Tuesday, the state announced the first payment of a death
claim from the collapse of the freeway in the 7.1-magnitude quake,
which struck Oct. 17, killing 67 people and causing $7 billion in
damage.
   About 100 people crowded a chapel in the small mountain town of
Weaverville, 200 miles north of San Francisco, for the funeral of
Helm, who became a symbol of hope and survival after the quake.
   Marc Helm recalled his father's sacrifices for his family. The
elder Helm commuted hundreds of miles on weekends to from his job
in Oakland. He slept in his van during the week so his children
could have more.
   ``Never once did he complain about the commute,'' his son said.
   ``I only hope I can be as good as a father to my children. My
father will become a spirit that will live forever in the hearts of
his children.''
   Helm had four children: Greg, 35; Marc, 22; Jeff, 16, and
Desiree, 12.
   The family's sobs could be heard from the next room as friends
walked past the oak casket, draped with a flag and surrounded by
six sprays and wreaths of white, peach, yellow, and red flowers.
   At the family's request, news cameras were excluded from the
services. At the burial one of Helm's sons yelled at reporters to
get away.
   Helm was buried next to the grave of his mother, Loraine
Simmins, in the 140-year-old Trinity Center Cemetery north of
Weaverville.
   At a news conference after the service, an attorney for the
family, Vasilios Choulos, said he would file a claim with the state.
   The family of one of the 42 people killed in the freeway
collapse will receive $150,000 in the first resolution of a claim
stemming from the earthquake, the state Board of Control said.
   Relatives of Juan-Daniel Luis Rubi, a self-employed sunroof
installer who lived in San Francisco, will receive the settlement
this week, said board spokesman Curt Soderlund.
   The settlement doesn't prevent survivors or their families from
suing the state for more money, Soderlund said.
   The board has so far received six claims under the new law that
appropriated $30 million for such settlements. Individual survivors
are eligible for up to $50,000 and a family of four may receive a
maximum of $200,000.

<HEAD>Release of Two Soviet POWS Imminent, Official Says</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Afghan rebels plan to free two Soviet
soldiers, the first release of Soviet POWs since the Red Army ended
its decade-long occupation of Afghanistan in February, a Soviet
official said today.
   The soldiers will be reunited with their mothers in the
Pakistani frontier city of Peshawar after more than three years of
captivity, said Vladimir Ivanov, a Soviet Embassy spokesman in
Islamabad.
   ``We don't know exactly when yet, but I think it will be within
a week,'' Ivanov said of the release.
   The two Soviets are to be released through the International
Committee of the Red Cross with the Pakistan Foreign Ministry
acting as mediator. Guerrilla sources confirmed the plan but gave
no further details.
   Ivanov said the two army privates, identified as Andrei Lopuhk
and Valery Prokapchuk, were captured by the anti-communist rebels
in 1986.
   Guerrilla sources have, however, claimed that Lopukh defected to
their side in 1987.
   The insurgents, called mujahedeen or Islamic ``holy warriors,''
offered to release Lopukh in June but he told a news conference he
wouldn't go home until Kabul releases an estimated 35,000 rebel
prisoners.
   Asked whether Lopukh had changed his mind, Ivanov said:
``Apparently so.''
   Soviet forces fought to prop up Afghanistan's Marxist government
between December 1979 and February 1989.
   The guerrillas, many of whom are based in neighboring Pakistan,
say they hold about 75 Soviet POWs but Moscow says about 300 of its
soldiers are still missing.
   The guerrillas released two Afghan POWs last week but have not
said how many of their own countrymen they hold.
   Pakistan, in addition to the United States, has backed the
guerrillas throughout their struggle to topple the Kabul government
and establish an Islamic republic of Afghanistan.
   Afghan government forces continue to control the country's major
cities despite relentless rebel attacks. The insurgents have
refused to negotiate peace with Kabul officials, whom they blame
for inviting the Soviet intervention.

<HEAD>Body Found Tentatively Identified As Missing U.S. Journalist</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TAMPA, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Items found on a body discovered near a
Peruvian jungle town indicated it was that of a reporter for The
Tampa Tribune, and that he was killed by leftist insurgents, his
newspaper reported today.
   Todd Smith, 28, who was researching stories on cocaine
traffickers and leftist guerrillas, was last seen Friday as he left
for the airport on the outskirts of Uchiza, 245 miles northeast of
Lima.
   The tentative identification was made late Tuesday, said Tom
Leary, assistant press attache for the U.S. Embassy in Peru. He
said an autopsy was to be performed today in Uchiza.
   The body was found three blocks from the central square of the
town in the Huallaga Valley in central Peru, a notoriously lawless
cocaine-producing region. He appeared to have been beaten and
strangled, said British journalist Simon Strong, who accompanied
U.S. officials to the scene.
   At least 15 Peruvian journalists have been killed in Peru's
guerrilla and drug trafficking violence, but Smith would be the
first American reporter slain.
   A placard found with the body suggests the slaying was the work
of the Maoist rebel group Shining Path, Strong said.
   The wooden sign denounced the United States: ``In this way die
North American spies linked to the Pentagon who are carrying out an
anti-subversive plan in Latin America and especially in Peru.
   ``Death to the North American imperialism. Long live the
Communist Party. Long live the war of the people.''
   His body was identified from a taxi receipt bearing his name
found in his pocket, Strong said.
   Smith, who was due back in Tampa on Monday, was in Peru on
vacation, said Lawrence McConnell, the Tribune's managing editor.
   ``I think it was his intent to come back and write about what he
found there, but we didn't assign him,'' McConnell said.
   ``This is one of the trickiest areas to work,'' said Michael
Smith, a correspondent for The Washington Post and Newsweek who has
lived in Peru for 16 years. ``If he was doing it alone, that's even
more difficult. Most journalists I know try to work in pairs when
they go to the Huallaga. It's not the kind of place to go alone.''
   The Upper Huallaga region, the world's largest source of the
coca leaf used to make cocaine, has been in turmoil since the
Shining Path recently started extorting payments from peasant
farmers and Colombian traffickers. The terrorists use the profits
to finance their revolution.
   Smith, a Latin American scholar, had reported previously on
jungle warfare in Central America.
   In 1981, he studied at the Instituto Fenix language school in
Cuernavaca, Mexico, and in 1983 he won the Lee Scholarship for
Latin America Research at the Library of Congress.
   After three years with the St. Petersburg Times, he left in May
1987 to become a freelance reporter in Central America.
   He traveled extensively, compiling a series on 10 weeks he spent
with the Nicaraguan rebels. He reported their 200-mile treks from
rebel bases in Honduras to combat zones in northern Nicaragua. The
series was published in the St. Petersburg Times and the San
Francisco Chronicle.

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The British Broadcasting Corp. and the U.S.
television networks are talking about co-producing shows for their
own and foreign markets, a top BBC official said.
   Long-term deals could help control costs, the BBC's director
general, Michael Checkland, said Tuesday, and ``together we could
sell to the expanding European market.''
   Referring to recent loosening of restrictions in Eastern Europe,
he also asserted that ``the opening of the Eastern bloc presents
new opportunities for us both.''
   The non-commercial BBC is supported primarily by yearly fees,
now about $100 per residence, that it charges its viewers. With
changes in British broadcasting coming, including more commercial
channels to increase viewing alternatives, the BBC is seeking new
sources of income.
   It already has deals with U.S. cable networks and PBS that
account for half its co-production business, Checkland said in a
luncheon speech here to the International Radio &amp; Television
Society.
   Now, he said, ``we are talking to the networks to see if we can
do business with them, too. I very much hope we can ... long-term
deals between us are certainly in both our interests.''
   Meeting later with reporters, Checkland said the BBC had a few
co-production deals on individual programs with U.S. networks about
20 years ago but has done nothing since.
   Now, he said, BBC and CBS officials have been discussing
long-term co-production possibilities in recent weeks, and ``we're
just generally talking'' about that with ABC and NBC.
   He described the CBS talks as positive, but declined to be
specific.
   ``I think we're making progress, but haven't got to the very
point where we have to make an announcement,'' he said.

<HEAD>Playboy Twins Charged with Tax Evasion; Pay for Sex Alleged</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Twin sisters who appeared nude in Playboy
magazine evaded income taxes on about $1 million they were paid by
an elderly millionaire in exchange for sex, the government alleges.
   A grand jury indictment returned Tuesday charges Leigh Ann
Conley of Milwaukee and her sister Lynette Harris of Arlington,
Texas, with failing to report income for several years beginning in
1984. The sisters, now 35, appeared nude together in Playboy in
1981. They also appeared in the movies ``I, the Jury,'' based on a
Mickey Spillane novel, and ``Soceress.''
   They were paid over a four-year period by David Kritzik, a
widower who died June 1 at age 89, the indictment alleged.
   Kritzik founded General Merchandising Co., a mail order company
that established a regional chain of Treasure Island discount
stores and was sold to the J.C. Penney Co. in 1962 for $11 million.
   Ms. Conley was paid a total of $326,000 and Ms. Harris received
$685,000, the government said.
   Ms. Harris' attorney, Kurt Muller, said the money was a gift,
and didn't need to be reported as income.
   Assistant U.S. Attorney Mel S. Johnson said the twins were paid
for sex.
   ``It's income if it's payment for services; it's not income if
it's a gift,'' Johnson said.
   Muller suggested the charges were the result of accusations by
Kritzik's son, Stanley, in connection with a legal dispute with Ms.
Harris.
   Identifying herself as a former mistress, she challenged
Kritzik's will and sought $5 million from his estate. She also sued
the son, seeking damages for what the lawsuit alleges are
statements damaging her reputation.

<HEAD>Police Lift Ban on Asian Wall Street Journal</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Police have lifted a ban on local
distribution of the Asian Wall Street Journal after the newspaper's
editor said he regretted any misunderstanding caused by an article
about Buddhism, police said today.
   Police chief Sawaeng Thirasawat on Tuesday lifted the 5-day-old
ban on the Hong Kong-based daily, said the officer of the Special
Branch police.
   The officer, who declined to be named, said the newspaper could
again be sold in Thailand once the new order was published in the
Royal Gazette. He did not know how long that would take.
   The newspaper's normal circulation in Thailand is 2,500. It is
owned mainly by Dow Jones &amp; Co. of the United States.
   Police found objectionable a July 21 article that they said had
insulted the Supreme Patriarch of Buddhism, the state religion. The
article concerned the controversy between the patriarch and the
Santi Asoke, a fundamentalist sect that has criticized what it
considers unethical practices of the mainstream religion in
Thailand.
   Editor Barry Wain had lodged an appeal with Sawaeng and Interior
Minister Pramarn Adireksarn.
   ``I expressed regret for any misunderstanding the article may
have caused,'' Wain said in a statement.
   ``As I have explained previously, the article was about a very
public dispute within the ranks of Thai Buddhism. It was not our
intention to denigrate any of the parties involved.
   ``I deeply regret that some people have interpreted the article
as an insult to the Supreme Patriarch.''
   The Committee to Protect Journalists, a private U.S. group, sent
a message to Thai Prime Minister Chatichai Choonhavan on Friday
expressing concern over the ban as well as threatened action
against the Far Eastern Economic Review magazine.
   ``Such actions are particularly dismaying in view of your
country's reputation as being one of the freest for the foreign
press in Asia,'' the telex said.
   The controversial article in the Far Eastern Economic Review's
Nov. 23 edition said the Tourism Authority of Thailand was
indirectly protecting the sex business to attract tourist dollars.
The weekly magazine is based in Hong Kong.

   The dollar fell against all major currencies in
moderately active European trading early today.
   Gold bullion, which jumped above $400 an ounce on Tuesday for
the first time since January, surged again in choppy trading.
   Dealers said the dollar recovered some ground in late-morning
trading after falling sharply after the opening. Trading is
expected to fall off with U.S. markets closed for Thursday's
Thanksgiving holiday. West German markets were closed Wednesday.
   In Tokyo, where trading ends before Europe's business day
begins, the dollar fell 0.55 Japanese yen to a closing 143.88 yen.
Later, in London, it fell further to 143.75 yen.
   Other dollar rates at midmorning compared with late Tuesday:
   _1.8065 West German marks, down from 1.8200
   _1.6072 Swiss francs, down from 1.6200
   _6.1585 French francs, down from 6.2000

   _1,331.00 Italian lire, down from 1,341.00
   _1.1700 Canadian dollars, down from 1.1705
   In London, the British pound rose to $1.5723 from $1.5645 late
Tuesday.
   Gold opened in London at a bid price of $406 a troy ounce, up
from $402.75 bid late Tuesday. At midmorning, the city's five major
bullion dealers fixed a recommended price of $406.60.
   In Zurich, the bid price was $407.75, up from $399 bid late
Tuesday.
   Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold rose $8.28 to close at a bid $406.89.
   Silver rose in London to a bid price of $5.78 a troy ounce, up

   A college professor from New Mexico who
was trapped in a hotel by a Salvadoran rebel attack said he
barricaded his room with mattresses as a precaution against stray
bullets.
   Ron Blood, a professor of education administration at the
University of New Mexico, described in a telephone interview from
El Salvador on Tuesday how government troops landed on the roof of
the El Salvador Sheraton and led him and others to safety through
heavy fighting.
   ``I've been in tough spots before but never like that,'' Blood
said.
   Blood, 57, was in the capital for work with a university office
that works with the U.S. Agency for International Development. He
was staying in a section of the luxury hotel separate from
five-story annex where rebels temporarily trapped dozens of
foreigners.
   Early today, the only foreigners remaining in the hotel annex
occupied by the rebels were eight armed U.S. Army Green Berets who
apparently were waiting for the insurgents to slip away from
encircling Salvadoran government troops under cover of darkness.
   ``The battle just closed in around the hotel, and it became
apparent the army was not going to be able to clear it,'' he said.
   Blood barricaded himself in his room, covering his windows with
mattresses and hiding in his bathtub because he had been told that
was the safest place.
   He got through to the U.S. embassy on a walkie-talkie system
which the university's San Salvador office shares with AID.
   ``They told us the guerrillas had entered the hotel. After that
I stopped using the radio because it beeps and people with radios
are likely targets.
   ``The battle just went on and on. You could hear the glass
breaking,'' he said.
   By afternoon, Salvadoran government troops he likened to
commandos landed on the roof of the Sheraton, he said.
   ``They entered from above and helped clear the building. ...
They took us down through the building and out to a little armored
vehicle, called a tanqueta, or little tank,'' Blood said. ``The
hotel was still under very heavy fire.''
   In contrast, a Portland, Ore., couple who were trapped in the
hotel for 14 hours said they didn't feel threatened.
   Larry Miller and his wife Charlotte Miller, both 71, were freed
unharmed along with other foreigners, said their son, Lyman Miller
of Portland. He spoke with his parents by telephone Tuesday evening.
   ``They were well treated, they never had a gun pointed at them
directly or were threatened in any way and it was clear the
guerrillas objective was never to harm them in any way,'' Miller
said.
   The Millers had been in El Salvador since Oct. 15 with the
International Executive Service Corps, an agency that sends retired
U.S. business executives to advise their counterparts in developing
nations. Miller went to work with an asphalt manufacturing company.
   Blood, director of the university's Office of International
Technical Cooperation, was in El Salvador to prepare for the
planned closing of the university's education office next month.
The office, which is finishing contract work for AID, will close
today because of the fighting, Blood said.

Resurrection Hospital in Chicago earlier in the day after a six-day
stay.
   ``She's here for a few days of recuperation before going home''
to Skowhegan, said the nursing supervisor, who wouldn't provide a
condition report.
   A friend, Merton Henry, said previously that Smith had a
digestion problem on a flight from Bangor, Maine, to Chicago. She
had planned to attend a meeting in Indianapolis.
   A Republican, she served in the Senate from 1948 to 1972.

<HEAD>Authorities Say Hiker May Have Unknowingly Hid from Searchers</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A hiker lost for two weeks in rugged South
Carolina wilderness may have hid from a search party because she
believed she was being chased by men intending to harm her,
authorities said.
   ``From the very beginning, before the search was initiated, she
became frightened or paranoid that somebody was trying to run her
down,'' said Oconee County (S.C.) Emergency Preparedness Director
Walt Purcell.
   ``We feel that had she wanted to come out and be rescued, the
opportunity was probably there numerous times,'' he said.
   Although the hiker, 22-year-old Eloise Lindsay, insisted Tuesday
that men chased her along the trail, authorities said they have no
such evidence and have no plans to investigate further.
   Officials who interviewed the backpacker said the most likely
scenario is that she became frightened and panicked when she saw
hunters and later thought her rescuers were the same men chasing
her.
   ``We don't believe anybody was chasing her,'' said Tim Morgan,
assistant sheriff of Pickens County, S.C.
   On Monday, two days after authorities called off the search that
involved more than 100 people for seven days, Miss Lindsay was
found by a deer hunter a few miles north of the 43-mile Foothills
Trail in Table Rock State Park.
   Six months out of college, Miss Lindsay told reporters she had
gone backpacking to think about what to do next with her life. She
said she left the main trail and got lost when she sensed she was
being followed by men.
   ``I could tell there was no good intent involved,'' she said,
although there was no clear indication the men meant to harm her.
   ``I used instinct, like a deer,'' she said, adding that the men
carried walkie-talkies and that she could hear them talking about
her.
   Miss Lindsay, who began the hike alone on Nov. 4, first began to
fear she was being tracked by area construction workers Nov. 7,
long before she exhausted her seven-day food supply.
   Oconee Sheriff's Office Chief Deputy James Singleton said he
believes Miss Lindsay heard workers talking over walkie-talkies
amplified through speakers on their trucks and thought they were
discussing her.
   Miss Lindsay said she later knew rescuers were searching for her
but said she still believed other men also were trailing her.
   The hiker _ who suffered infected blisters on both feet, cuts
and abrasions _ recalled her ordeal at a news conference under a
tree wrapped in yellow ribbons outside her parents' home in Atlanta.
   She saw rescue helicopters overhead but she didn't build a fire
to attract attention, she said, because it might have given her
away to the men she believed were chasing her.

   The Episcopal Church's presiding bishop says the
killings and arrests of church workers in El Salvador show that the
Bush administration should change its Latin American policy.
   ``There comes a time when accountability must be demanded of our
government's actions,'' the Most Rev. Edmond L. Browning, leader of
the Episcopal Church's National Council, told reporters Tuesday.
   An Episcopal missionary from the United States and at least five
other lay workers arrested by the Salvadoran National Guard have
been released, but 12 more _ all Salvadorans _ were still being
held, Browning said.
   Altogether, 19 Episcopal lay workers were arrested Monday
morning at the St. John Evangelist Church in San Salvador, a
sanctuary for 400 refugees, Browning said.
   Six were released Tuesday, including the American, Josie
Beecher, 37, of Olympia, Wash.; three Spaniards, who were ordered
deported; a Canadian and a Guatemalan.
   It was unclear whether another worker, Marcela Rodriguez, who
holds dual Colombian and U.S. citizenships, was released.
   Three Episcopal priests from Los Angeles have gone to San
Salvador to try to secure the release of those who remain in
custody, Browning said.
   ``I haven't been this incensed about anything in a long time,''
he said.
   In a letter to Salvadoran President Alfredo Cristiani, Browning
appealed for the church workers' safety and release. Copies were
sent to President Bush, other government officials, the Archbishop
of Canterbury and other Anglican leaders.
   The United States has provided billions of dollars in aid to the
government of El Salvador, which has been engaged in a 10-year
civil war with leftist rebels.
   Many clerics there have been accused of siding with the rebels.
   The Rev. Luis Serrano, pastor of St. John Evangelist, has been
in hiding for 1{ weeks. ``We believe he's safe,'' said Browning,
adding, ``We daresay he was on the list'' of those targeted for
arrest.
   The whereabouts of Beecher's 4-year-old daughter, Mariana, was
unknown, but friends may have taken her in when her mother was
arrested, said Browning.
   Among the Salvadorans still believed in custody were Juan
Antonio Berti Quinones, assistant director of the Episcopal relief
agency that runs the refugee center, and his wife, Ana Rivera de
Quinones.
   Six prominent Jesuit priests, including the rector and vice
rector of the country's prestigious Central American University,
were slain last week as the Salvador government stepped up its
campaign against the Roman Catholic and Protestant clergy.
   ``The murder last week of the six Jesuits and their housekeepers
has been but the most dramatic in a chilling sequence of threats
and actions against church and humanitarian workers in El
Salvador,'' said Browning.

   Thousands of mourners accompanied the body
of a slain Basque politician through city streets today, and
demonstrators around the Basque region burned barricades and closed
businesses to protest his death.
   Jon ``Josu'' Muguruza was killed Monday by two suspected
right-wing gunmen as he sat in a Madrid restaurant with other
Basque legislators of his radical coalition, the Herri Batasuna
(Popular Union) Party. He was elected to parliament Oct. 29.
   Muguruza's body, accompanied by 5,000 supporters waving Basque
flags and chanting anti-government slogans, was carried to city
hall, where it will lie in state.
   A second deputy-elect from the same party was shot in the
attack, which came on the eve of the swearing-in ceremonies for the
new Parliament. He has improved considerably since undergoing
surgery for four bullet wounds, doctors said.
   Herri Batasuna is widely regarded as the political wing of the
separatist group ETA, which claims responsibility for attacks that
have killed more than 600 people in a 21-year campaign for
independence for the Spanish Basque region.
   Most businesses in the region closed for the day, heeding the
party's call for a general strike or succumbing to pressure from
roving groups of protesters who advised them not to open, news
reports said.
   Youths burned barricades on highways in the three Basque
provinces and neighboring Navarre, and officials suspended bus
service in the provincial capitals of San Sebastian, Bilbao,
Vitoria and the Navarran capital, Pamplona.
   One resident of the town of Santurce, who identified herself
only as Susana, told Spanish radio that masked youths had shut down
her bread store. ``We're scared,'' she said.
   Socialist Prime Minister Felipe Gonzalez has called the shooting
``horrendous'' and said apprehending the gunmen was a top priority
for the government.
   Several Spanish dailies, citing Interior Ministry sources, said
investigators believe the two men who burst into the Madrid
restaurant and opened fire with pistols were aiming at the injured
politician, Inaki Esnaola, and accidentally killed Muguruza.
   Two other deputies, three senators and three others were seated
at the table but uninjured in the attack.
   The dailies said the fact that the attack occurred on the 14th
anniversary of the death of authoritarian ruler Gen. Francisco
Franco, and that the gunmen used military-issue ammunition, led
police to suspect a link with ultra-right army factions.
   ``(The) attack ... bears the unmistakable signs of fascism,''
leading daily El Pais said in an editorial.
   Both Muguruza, who was 31, and the 41-year-old Esnaola were
regarded as ``moderates'' who favored the resumption of talks
between government representatives and ETA, suspended by Gonzalez
in April after ETA broke a moratorium on its attacks.
   They also supported Herri Batasuna's decision to take its seats
in Parliament for the first time since the country's return to
democracy in 1977 _a decision party spokesman Jon Idigoras said it
would stick to, despite the attack.
   Until now, Herri Batasuna members had refused to swear
allegiance to the 1978 Spanish constitution, a prerequisite for
parliamentary participation.

<HEAD>Court Cites Privacy Right in Quadriplegic's Wish to Die</HEAD>

   Georgia's Supreme Court has unanimously decided
the right to privacy allows a man paralyzed in a motorcycle
accident to shut off the breathing apparatus that has kept him
alive for four years.
   The right to privacy is guaranteed in the state and U.S.
constitutions and outweighs whatever interests the state has in
preserving the life of 33-year-old Larry McAfee, the court ruled
Tuesday.
   McAfee already had permission from a trial-level judge to use a
special device to shut off his ventilator and to receive a sedative
to alleviate any pain that resulted. The judge suggested the state
appeal so the Supreme Court could issue guidelines for future
cases, but the high court suggested that is a legislative task.
   Arthur Caplan, director of the Center for Biomedical Ethics at
the University of Minnesota, said the ruling's emphasis on privacy
rights could influence a U.S. Supreme Court case next month.
   The federal justices are scheduled to hear arguments Dec. 6 on
behalf of Nancy Beth Cruzan, a Jasper County, Mo., woman injured in
a car accident six years ago at age 25.
   ``In the Cruzan case, part of the argument is whether the right
to privacy extends to these types of decisions,'' Caplan said.
   McAfee's attorney, Randall Davis, said the young man is ``most
gratified that the highest court in Georgia has affirmed his right
to decide his own destiny.''
   ``He is currently reviewing several options which have been
offered to him, but he does not necessarily believe that he will
change his mind as to the removal of his life support system,''
Davis said.
   McAfee, living in an Alabaster, Ala., nursing home, has said he
planned to return to Georgia sometime after the holiday season to
shut off his ventilator. But he has met with people who said they
could show him he could live a better life with the aid of new
technology.
   McAfee suffered a severe spinal cord injury in a 1985 motorcycle
accident that left him a quadriplegic. He cannot breathe without
artificial assistance.
   Some advocates for the disabled said McAfee's situation resulted
from insensitive government policies that do not give people like
McAfee a chance to live outside institutions.
   ``Essentially, states like Georgia ... give disabled people two
choices: the nursing home or the cemetery,'' said Paul Longmore, a
California historian and quadriplegic.
   The Supreme Court noted the existence of a ``living will'' law
in Georgia that allows competent adults to direct doctors not to
use extraordinary procedures to keep them alive if they become
terminally ill. But the court said McAfee's case doesn't fit those
conditions.
   Lawmakers said Tuesday that they probably will consider
guidelines next month that could enable families and physicians
involved in right-to-die cases to act without fearing legal action.
   ``No one likes to see a fellow human being die. But there are
some things worse than dying,'' said state Sen. Donn M. Peevy. ``So
I suppose if we are to be civilized we need to propose a legal
guideline for those rare situations.''

<HEAD>Orders for Durable Goods Drop for Second Month</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARTIN CRUTSINGER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Economics Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Orders to U.S. factories for ``big ticket''
durable goods fell 0.6 percent in October, the second consecutive
monthly decline, the government reported today.
   The Commerce Department said orders for durable goods _ items
expected to last three or more years _ dipped to a seasonally
adjusted $124.59 billion last month following a 1.1 percent drop in
September.
   While the October decline had been expected, the real surprise
was a sharp revision to the orders number for September, which a
month ago had been reported as a small increase of 0.2 percent.
   The back-to-back declines in orders provided fresh evidence that
the U.S. manufacturing sector is facing a severe slowdown. Many
economists are forecasting that the country will dip close to a
recession in the coming six months as a slump in manufacturing
spills over into the rest of the economy.
   Much of the weakness so far has been in the auto industry, where
weak sales have already prompted layoffs and production cutbacks.
   For October, transportation orders rose by 3 percent to $33.54
billion, recouping some of a giant 10.8 percent drop in September.
   However, the October strength came from inceased demand for
military ships and civilian aircraft. Orders for motor vehicles
were down again.
   The total demand for defense equipment fell by 12.4 percent to
$9.33 billion. However, this followed a huge 33.9 percent increase
in military orders in September.
   The September advance had originally been reported as an even
larger 60 percent increase, but the Commerce Department said
changes in the original company reports triggered a big downward
revision that transformed the overall September figure from a small
positive to the big decline.
   Excluding the volatile defense category, orders would have risen
0.5 percent in October after posting a 3.5 percent decline in
September.
   Orders in the key category of nondefense capital goods,
considered a good indication of industry expansion plans, rose 3.2
percent in October to $36.50 billion, but this followed several
months of weakness.
   Analysts believe that capital investment, which has been one of
the main factors propping up economic growth in the past two years,
will weaken significantly in coming months.
   Orders for the machinery category that includes computers
dropped 4.6 percent to $21.53 billion, while the non-computer
machinery category fell 3.8 percent to $20.16 billion.
   Shipments of durable goods fell 1.7 percent to $122.4 billion
following a 3 percent decline in September.

<HEAD>NYNEX, Strikers Sign Tentative Settlement</HEAD>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A union representing 40,000 telephone workers in
the Northeast signed a tentative agreement with NYNEX early today
to end the last of the Baby Bell strikes begun in August.
   The settlement was announced by the Communications Workers of
America and NYNEX, which serves 10.5 million customers in New York,
Connecticut, Rhode Island, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, Vermont
and Maine.
   The bitter, 16-week strike over health care issues left one
worker dead, delayed directory assistance, repairs and installation
and was marked by more than 500 reported acts of vandalism.
   The CWA and 20,000 members of the International Brotherhood of
Electrical Workers went on strike Aug. 6 against NYNEX, one of four
regional phone companies struck that week. The other Baby Bell
strikes were settled by September.
   The CWA and the IBEW agreed with NYNEX Nov. 13 on a settlement
framework, then began negotiating local issues. The IBEW returned
to work Monday at New England Telephone, a NYNEX subsidiary. Today,
the CWA signed with NYNEX subsidiary New York Telephone as well as
with NYNEX.
   NYNEX spokesman John O'Brien, in announcing the tentative
three-year pact, said union members would vote on the agreement by
Dec. 1 and return to work Dec. 4.
   ``With this proposed accord, we have saved our health care,''
said Jan Pierce, CWA vice president.
   The biggest issue in the strike was a company attempt to shift
the cost of health care to the workers, with costs ranging up to
$1,500 a year.
   The settlement does not include any health-care cost-shifting,
Pierce said. Nor does it include a lump-sum bonus or profit-sharing
plan the company had previously offered.
   The settlement includes raises of 3 percent the first year and
1.5 percent in each of the remaining two years, plus cost-of-living
allowances in the second and third years.
   As talks continued and broke off repeatedly, NYNEX reported
numerous acts of vandalism and offered $100,000 for information on
the alleged sabotage. Two weeks ago, some 361,000 customers north
of New York City lost service.
   Sticking points included what would happen to the more than 150
workers suspended or fired during the strike for alleged offenses
ranging from harassing management workers to assaulting them and
damaging their cars.
   CWA spokesman Bob Master said that under the settlement, the
disciplined workers will have the right to go through a grievance
procedure.
   ``I think the tremendous challenge to us is the tremendous
animosity built up during the strike,'' said CWA President Morton
Bahr. ``This company needs cooperation to be a viable,
profit-making corporation.''
   A 34-year-old striker died in a confrontation Aug. 15 at a NYNEX
office in suburban Valhalla. Police said he jumped onto the hood of
a non-striking worker's car as she crossed a picket line, then fell
off and struck his head.

<HEAD>American, Three Namibians Fined For Insulting Election Commission</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WINDHOEK, Namibia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An American journalist and three
Namibians were convicted of insulting the head of Namibia's
election commission and have been fined nominal amounts.
   Windhoek Regional Court Judge J.S. Verwey ruled Tuesday that
Scott Stanley, head of the conservative American Press
International, was guilty of violating a law that makes it a crime
to ``insult, disparage or belittle,'' the election commission.
   Stanley was fined 250 rand ($95), while the two Namibian editors
and a publisher, convicted under the same law, were fined amounts
ranging from 20 rand ($8) to 150 rand ($58).
   According to court testimony, Stanley visited Namibia in July
and interviewed Bryan O'Linn, a respected lawyer and head of the
election commission established to investigate charges of
intimidation prior to the Nov. 7-11 polls.
   Stanley then returned to his Washington-based news agency and
filed a report to U.S. radio stations that suggested that O'Linn
was biased in favor of the South-West Africa People's Organization,
known as SWAPO, and therefore unfit to head the commission,
according to testimony.
   The report criticized O'Linn but did not address any specific
cases handled by the commission.
   Leftist SWAPO, which waged a 23-year war against South African
rule of Namibia, won 57 percent of the vote in the pre-independence
election.
   Stanley sent a transcript of his radio report to Namibian
newspapers, two of which published stories quoting his work.
   The publisher of the newspapers, Diether Lauenstein, and the
editors of the publications, the Windhoek Advertiser and the
German-language Allegemeine Zeitung, were convicted along with
Stanley.
   O'Linn testified that Stanley's report was inaccurate and
misleading.
   The law prohibiting criticism of the election commission was
enacted in a proclamation by Namibia's South African administrator,
Louis Pienaar. SWAPO had no role in the running of the commission.
   South Africa, which has ruled Namibia for 74 years, has agreed
to grant independence to the territory under U.N. supervision.

<TEXT>
   Congressional sponsors of a sweeping Medicare
overhaul say changing the way physicians are reimbursed would help
slow climbing health care costs in the program and eventually in
the nation.
   The changes also will improve access to medical services for
Medicare recipients, and ultimately for all Americans, and begin a
trend toward more preventive care and fewer expensive, high-tech
procedures, they said.
   ``In the next three or four years, you'll see a tremendous shift
in physician behavior to more appropriate care,'' Sen. Jay
Rockefeller, D-W.Va., an architect of the plan, said Tuesday.
   ``There is going to be significant change ... in terms of
procedures,'' he said. ``There's going to be much greater emphasis
on primary care, wellness and preventive care.''
   These changes would occur first for Medicare's 33 million
elderly and disabled beneficiaries and eventually they would be
adopted by private insurance companies and spread throughout the
nation's health care system, he said.
   ``Medicare is the driving force in medicine because of its
budget,'' he said. Physician payments have been increasing 16
percent a year for a decade and are expected to reach $44 billion
this year.
   The measure was worked out by House and Senate negotiators
Monday as part of the budget reconciliation bill. Congress
completed action on the overall bill early today.
   The American Medical Association supports the plan, saying it
will help keep costs stable. John Zapp, the association's director
of government relations, said most Medicare recipients probably
wouldn't notice much difference in medical care.
   Opponents say the plan would lead to a decline in the quality of
services. Edmund Haislmaier, a health-care policy analyst at the
conservative Heritage Foundation, said the plan may initially level
out costs but there are not enough incentives to control
expenditures over the long term.
   He said it could lead to rationing of medical services over time.
   The plan includes a new schedule for reimbursing physicians who
treat Medicare patients, to be phased in over five years beginning
in 1992. Reimbursements are now based on a physician's customary
charges, which can have little relationship to cost and can vary
greatly among doctors.
   The new rates would boost fees for family and general practice
physicians and internists. Fees would be lowered for surgeons,
radiologists and other specialties that are based on procedures.
When the system is in place, however, surgeons and other high-paid
specialists typically would make more overall than those in general
practice.
   The fees would be standardized by specialty, with adjustments to
account for regional cost differences. Physicians who practice in
poorly served areas, notably inner cities and rural areas, would
get a 10 percent bonus.
   The American Society of Internal Medicine, the leading
professional organization for internists, backs the plan, saying
the fee schedule ``will neutralize incentives for physicians to
practice a very high-tech oriented style of medicine.''
   A spokeswoman for the American College of Surgeons said, ``Right
now, we're very favorable,'' although its officials must still read
the final measure.
   ``This group realizes the world is different and there's a
certain reality out there,'' said spokeswoman Linn Meyer. ``There's
a lot of concern with the costs of medicine ... There has to be
belt tightening. All health-care sectors are going to be affected.''
   Another part of the plan would slow the increase in payments to
physicians by linking payment increases to a Medicare spending
goal. Reimbursement rates could be cut if physician payments exceed
the goal,
   The plan also requires physicians to submit claims for
beneficiaries. About 20 percent now require the patient to pay the
bill and seek reimbursement from Medicare.
   A related feature also included in the budget bill would enable
rural hospitals to receive the same medicare payments as their
urban counterparts for treating elderly and disabled patients.
   The disparity in Medicare reimbursement rates, at least 12
percent for rural hospitals, has been blamed by some congressman
for the deterioration in rural health care and closing of rural
hospitals.
   Under the plan, Medicare payments to rural hospitals would be
equalized over five years. Initially, however, Medicare payment
rates to rural hospitals would be increased by 4.2 percent.

<HEAD>Blind Couple, Condo Association at Odds Over Guide Dogs</HEAD>
<DATELINE>POMPANO BEACH, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A blind couple are fighting with
their condo association over where their guide dogs do their
business.
   Adam and Denise Shaible say it's better if their two dogs answer
nature's call in the couple's assigned space in the parking lot.
That's where it's easiest to clean up.
   But the condominium association of Island Club Number Four wants
to hold the Shaibles to an agreement signed when they bought their
$84,000 condo in May. Under that agreement, the guide dogs must go
on the Shaibles' patio in a dog run the couple agreed to build.
   Association members also charge the Shaibles don't always clean
up after their dogs _ an accusation the couple deny.
   Earlier this month, the Broward County Human Rights Division
sided with the condo association. The Shaibles have appealed the
decision to the panel.
   ``We're blind. We have a right to have our dogs and our lives,''
Denise Shaible, 30, said in today's Sun-Sentinel of Fort Lauderdale.
   While the 503-unit complex does not allow pets, guide dogs are
not legally considered pets _ but extensions of the Shaibles, said
their attorney, L. Jerry Cohn.
   According to the couple, the condo association forced them to
sign the agreement as a condition of purchase, violating federal,
state and local laws prohibiting discrimination against the
handicapped.
   But Ellen G. Hirsch, attorney for the condo association, said
the dog run in the 4-by-12-foot patio was the Shaibles' idea, not
the association's.

<HEAD>Jury Returns Libel Verdict Against Paper</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PITTSBURGH (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A jury awarded a $275,000 to a former borough
lawyer who sued The Pittsburgh Press for libel over an article on
his role in a political dispute.
   Press Editor Angus McEachran said that he was shocked by the
verdict Tuesday and that the newspaper would appeal.
   The Common Pleas jury awarded $75,000 in actual damages and
$200,000 in punitive damages to William Murray, 53, of Palm Beach
Gardens, Fla.
   Murray, formerly a solicitor for Brentwood, sued over a 1985
article quoting a judge as saying Murray ``may have lied'' to him.
The day after the article appeared, the judge told the paper that
it was Murray's assistant who appeared before him, not Murray, and
the Press ran a clarification the same day.
   Scott Melton, one of Murray's attorneys, argued that the
clarification was insufficient because it ``did nothing to let
readers know that Mr. Murray never lied to a judge in court.''
   The article focused on a dispute involving a former mayor who
sued the borough in late 1984 over speaking privileges at borough
council meetings.
   McEachran suggested jurors failed to understand the judge's
instructions that Murray, as a public figure, had to prove actual
malice _ that the report was published with knowledge it was false
or with reckless disregard for the truth.
   The Press' competitor, the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette, lost the
largest libel judgment ever paid by a newspaper. The $2.2 million
award went to a former judge who sued over a 1979 article about a
disputed will he handled as a lawyer.

   About 200 people prayed and
called for freedom outside the Palace of Justice today in a protest
urging the release of a prominent dissident on trial for sedition
and subversion.
   Jan Carnogursky, a Roman Catholic activist and human rights
campaigner, went on trial Monday on charges filed on the basis of
one article written for a Bratislava underground monthly and a
statement signed with four other activists in August.
   If convicted, he faces up to 10 years in jail.
   The four other activists were detained with Carnogursky on Aug.
14, but they were tried Nov. 14 and allowed to remain free pending
their trial.
   One of them, Miroslav Kusy, a leading Slovak rights activist,
was given an eight-month suspended sentence after being convicted
of ``harming state interests abroad.''
   The three other activists, Hana Ponicka, Anton Selecky and
Vladimir Manak, who were charged with sedition together with
Carnogursky, were acquitted.
   Carnogursky's trial began Nov. 6 but was immediately adjourned
because his defense lawyer became ill.
   About 200 people gathered outside the Palace of Justice as the
trial was under way today, praying and singing religious songs.
Several people held up tiny crosses.
   As a speaker called for the release of Carnogurksy, the crowd
burst into chants of ``Freedom! Freedom!''
   Police blocked off the immediate area to traffic, but they did
not intervene in the protest.
   The small demonstration broke up broke up after two hours.
Police were standing at the door of the Palace of Justice and
several were posted in nearby street, including a few directly in
front of the demonstrators.
   In front of the demonstrators, a Czechoslovak flag and
photographs were pinned to a lamppost.

<TEXT>
   The countries five largest cities retained
their rankings in the Census Bureau's latest estimates of city
populations but San Diego replaced Detroit as the nation's sixth
largest city.
   The Census Bureau said that San Jose, Calif., and Jacksonville,
Fla., also moved up in the rankings of the country's 25 largest
cities in a new report prepared for release today.
   New York City ranked No. 1 in population in 1988 followed by Los
Angeles, Chicago, Houston and Philadelphia, the same positions
these cities held in 1986, the last time the bureau estimated city
populations.
   But San Diego replaced Detroit as the nation's sixth largest
city while San Jose passed San Francisco and Indianapolis to move
into 12th place. In the other change in the top 25, Jacksonville
replaced Washington, D.C., as the 16th largest city.
   Since 1970, there have been major shifts in the ranking of the
most populous cities, with many in the East and Midwest being
replaced by cities in the South and West. Seven of the 10 largest
cities in 1970 were in the North and East but by 1988 there were
only four in these regions. Baltimore, Washington and Cleveland had
been replaced by San Diego, San Antonio and Phoenix.
   Among the 25 largest cities, 12 are estimated to have lost
population from 1986 to 1988, including Houston, Dallas and Denver.
Dallas' population loss dropped the city under 1 million, a level
Dallas had reached for the first time in 1986.
   The bureau's new estimates were prepared using procedures that
rely on measuring components of population change since 1986 such
as statistics on births and deaths and monitoring of federal income
tax returns to make estimates of net migration into an area.
   The bureau's population estimates cover inside the city limits
and do not include suburbs. Populations and rankings for
metropolitan areas, including suburbs, can differ substantially
from those for cities.
   Following are the 1988 Census population estimates for the
country's 25 largest cities, with each figure followed by the 1986
estimate. The figures are in thousands:
   New York: 7,353; 7,263
   Los Angeles: 3,353; 3,259
   Chicago: 2,978; 3,010
   Houston: 1,698; 1,729

<HEAD>NY Telephone Gets Highest Telecommunications Fine</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PETER ALAN HARPER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government has proposed a record $377,240
fine against New York Telephone for allegedly failing to tell
workers how to handle hazardous materials.
   If the fines proposed Tuesday are approved, they would be the
highest ever imposed by the Occupational Safety and Health
Administration against a telecommunications company.
   The accusations stem from 26 unannounced visits to New York
Telephone work sites throughout the state in July, when the
Communications Workers union lodged complaints with OSHA.
   OSHA found 62 willful violations, 16 serious violations and two
``other-than-serious'' violations.
   ``It's a very widespread case,'' said Edward Jerome, an official
at OSHA's Albany regional office. ``It's unusual in that extent,
that we had so many facilities not in compliance.''
   Anthony DeSiervi, OSHA assistant regional administrator in New
York City, noted that most of the citations involved paperwork.
``We are not alleging employees were overexposed to these
materials,'' he said.
   New York Telephone spokesman Tony Pappas denied the allegations.
   ``This company has always been interested in safety,'' he said.
``A willful violation is not something the company would do. We are
going to contest that.''
   The company has until Dec. 12 to contest the citations.
   The agency claimed that the company willfully violated OSHA
standards by failing to inform employees about hazardous materials
and train workers in handling such substances.
   Other alleged violations involved failure to properly store
compressed gas cylinders and test employees for exposure to lead.
   The mentioned substances, which included compressed gases,
leaded solder and solvents, can cause reproductive system problems,
nerve disorders, dizziness, skin and eye irritation, breathing
problems, headaches and nausea.
   Marsha Love, a health and safety director for the CWA, said the
company had eight years to implement safety measures under state
law, which was superseded by federal law in 1988.

<TEXT>
   The world's most populous democracy
began deciding today whether Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi gets
another chance to govern or falls victim to the most cohesive
opposition challenge ever mounted in India.
   At least 22 campaign workers and voters were killed in scattered
bombings, knifings and shootings on the first day of the
parliamentary election, which continues Friday and Sunday.
   As polls closed today, reports of rising violence and ballot
fraud mounted in Gandhi's own constituency of Amethi. Police,
residents and both political parties reported several clashes
between supporters of the Congress Party and the Janata Dal, the
major partner in the opposition coalition.
   More than 100,000 paramilitary troops were deployed across this
nation of 880 million people to help local police stem campaign
violence, which has killed at least 66 people since parliamentary
elections were announced Oct. 17.
   Preliminary reports indicated voter turnout of about 50 percent,
a normal turnout.
   Only 15 of India's 25 states and five of its seven federally
governed territories voted today. The rest of the country, with the
exception of Assam state, votes Friday and Sunday.
   Voting was postponed indefinitely in Assam because electoral
rolls were incomplete.
   At stake in the elections are 524 of the 543 seats in the Lok
Sabha, or House of the People, the policy-making lower house of
Parliament.
   Opinion polls conducted this month for two major Indian news
magazines indicated the Congress Party, haunted by allegations of
high-level corruption, would get 180 to 215 of the seats. That
would either doom it to defeat or force it to seek a difficult
coalition with smaller parties.
   In Uttar Pradesh, the state that elects 85 of the seats,
opposition leaders charged the electoral roll did not contain the
names of many 18-year-olds who are eligible to vote for the first
time this year.
   ``It's a calculated step to prevent the young generation who are
opposed to the Congress Party to cast ballots,'' Madhukar Dighe,
spokesman for the opposition Janata Dal party, said in the state
capital of Lucknow.
   This year's election violence is ahead of the 38 deaths reported
in the last campaign five years ago.
   The health minister of western Gujarat state was fatally stabbed
Tuesday night after addressing a Congress Party rally in
Hatmatiana, 600 miles southwest of New Delhi. United News said a
21-year-old man was arrested but a motive was not known.
   Three bomb blasts rocked the Kashmir valley near the Pakistani
frontier, where Moslem militants who want to secede from
predominantly Hindu India have warned voters to boycott the
election. No injuries were reported, but Press Trust of India said
the militants set fire to three polling stations and snatched
ballots from poll workers at two other sites.
   A local opposition leader, Sanjay Singh, the Janata Dal party's
candidate in a simultaneous state legislature election, was shot in
the arm three miles from Amethi, aides said. They claimed the
gunman was a Congress Party activist.
   ``No limbs were broken, but the limbs of democracy have been
broken,'' said Janata Dal spokesman Yashwant Sinha.
   Gandhi and his chief opponent, Janata Dal leader Vishwanath
Pratap Singh, are running in separate constituencies in Uttar
Pradesh.
   Gandhi was expected to win in the Amethi constituency, where he
was opposed by the Janata Dal's Raj Mohan Gandhi, grandson of
India's beloved independence leader Mohandas K. Gandhi.
   Raj Mohan Gandhi, who is no relation to the prime minister, was
roughed up by police when he complained of ballot-stuffing in
Jagdishpur, one of main towns in the Amethi district, party
headquarters in New Delhi reported.
   ``The whole election in Amethi has become a farce,'' said Dinesh
Goswamy, spokesman for the National Front opposition coalition
comprising the Janata Dal and four other parties.
   The Congress Party, meanwhile, accused Janata Dal activists of
killing three Congress supporters in Haryana state just north of
the capital.
   ``This is a desperate and final assault on Indian democracy by
the fascist opposition,'' Congress Party spokesman Anand Sharma
told a news conference in New Delhi.
   Despite the latest opinion polls, the prime minister professed
confidence as he voted in New Delhi.
   ``We're going to win,'' he told reporters after he and his wife,
Sonia, and their 18-year-old son, Rahul, voted across the street
from their house.
   The opposition was buoyed by the jubilant receptions according
Singh in Uttar Pradesh and Bihar states this week.
   The National Front has built its platform on pledges of honest,
capable government, accusing Gandhi of presiding over a coterie of
corruption and inefficiency.
   Gandhi, grandson of Indian's first prime minister, Jawaharlal
Nehru, and son of Prime Minister Indira Gandhi, has maintained that
only his family's Congress Party can govern effectively.
   The Congress Party has governed India for all but 29 months
since independence from Britain in 1947.
   Even when the Congress Party was ousted in a 1977 election, the
opposition was not nearly as united as the National Front is toda.
The vote then was considered more a vote against Mrs. Gandhi and
her emergency rule than a vote for the opposition, and Mrs. Gandhi
returned to power shortly afterward.
   Gandhi was swept into office on a massive sympathy vote in
December 1984, two months after his mother was gunned down by two
of her bodyguards.

<DATELINE>BIDDEFORD, Maine (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A man who kidnapped his two young sons
after divorcing his wife in Texas moved them from town to town
before shooting them to death as authorities closed in, police said.
   Roy Irwin Abbott, 52, turned himself in at the sheriff's office
Monday, telling a receptionist according to court papers: ``I need
to see a police officer. I've killed my kids.''
   Authorities had known since mid-October that Abbott may have
brought his sons to Maine, State Police Sgt. Michael Harriman said.
Officers looked for him in Eliot, his hometown; Augusta; Kittery;
and Portsmouth, N.H., where a brother lives, Harriman said.
   ``Each time we checked these locations, there was another move
on his part, indicating he was aware he was being hunted,''
Harriman said after Abbott's arraignment Tuesday.
   After Abbott's surrender, police went to a dirt road in
Shapleigh in southwestern Maine and found the bodies of the boys,
each shot twice at close range with a shotgun, Harriman said.
   Maine officials identified the boys as Roy Irwin Abbott Jr., 6,
and Ronney Abbott, 4. Texas authorities identified the younger boy
as Rooney Abbott, and neither agency could explain the discrepancy.
   Authorities said Abbott held various jobs, including work at the
Portsmouth Naval Shipyard and at a dry cleaner, and could be quiet
and pleasant despite a history of violence. Harriman said Abbott
was in prison in Maine from 1962 to 1964 for assault with intent to
kill a sheriff's deputy.
   Abbott did not have to enter a plea Tuesday. He was ordered
jailed for a bail hearing Nov. 29.
   Police in Denton, Texas, said Abbott told Maine officials he
shot his sons after deciding to turn himself in, because they began
crying and insisted they did not want to go home.
   In Shapleigh, Abbott told people he was on the run.
   ``He made no secret of the fact he had fled Texas with the
children, and he was hiding from his wife,'' said store owner
Barbara Belanger. She said that someone once overhead him and
called the sheriff's department.
   When Abbott's divorce from Maria Louisa Abbott, 40, of Denton,
became final on Sept. 1, he took custody of the sons for the Labor
Day weekend but never returned the youngsters, and the mother had a
kidnapping warrant issued, police said.

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   By trying to force two law firms to identify
cash-paying clients, the government is asking lawyers to violate
their ethical codes, defense lawyers contend.
   ``I think it's just another attempt by the government to use
every law that can be used against lawyers and their clients in the
name of the war on drugs,'' said Neil Sonnett, president of the
National Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers on Tuesday.
   The government last Thursday filed lawsuits under a 1984
Internal Revenue Service law aimed at controlling money-laundering
by requiring anyone conducting business to report cash transactions
of $10,000 or more.
   The law is regarded as an important tool of law-enforcement
officials to obtain information about the financial dealings of
drug traffickers.
   ``Crack and what it's done to America has given the government
the confidence that it can push aside not only civil liberties, but
legitimate concerns that lawyers have for their clients,'' said
Michael Ross, chairman of the American Bar Association's grand jury
committee.
   The two law firms, Fischetti Pomerantz &amp; Russo and Goldberger &amp;
Dubin, have represented alleged mob figures and drug suspects. They
filed reports required under the money laundering law but refused
to identify the clients who paid in cash, saying doing so would
violate the constitutional rights of their clients and the
attorney-client privilege.
   If they fail to comply, they could face criminal penalties
including prison terms and fines up to $500,000.
   Mark Pomerantz, of Fischetti Pomerantz, said the lawsuit would
be contested.
   ``We believe that the government's attempt to make us disclose
the identity of our client is an improper intrusion in the
attorney-client relationship,'' he said. ``It should not be law
that a private attorney should function as an agency for the
government to gather information that can used against the client.''
   Assistant U.S. Attorney Kay K. Gardiner said the government was
merely enforcing the law.
   Ross, however, said that when the law was adopted in 1984, the
government agreed not to subpoena or summon lawyers except when the
information was essential to an investigation and the information
was not available from any other source.

   The Senate early today unanimously confirmed
San Francisco attorney Vaughn R. Walker as a U.S. district judge,
ending a two-year controversy surrounding his membership in a club
with a record of discrimination.
   Walker's nomination was delayed for the two-year period because
of his 15-year membership in the Olympic Club of San Francisco,
which had no black members until last year and still excludes women.
   He resigned Feb. 15 but critics said the move came too late and
questioned his claim to have opposed the exclusion of women.

   Ashland Oil Inc. will pay the state $4.6
million in civil penalties and other costs for damage caused by a
1988 spill of more than 700,000 gallons of diesel fuel near
Pittsburgh, Gov. Robert P. Casey said today.
   The money will finance a number of intiatives, including an
environmental survey of the Ohio River basin and scholarships for
the study of environmental protection.
   ``This is also the largest single environmental payment the
company has agreed to pay in Pennsylvania, and it's unique because
through this agreement, the Ashland penalties will be put to sound
environmental use,'' Casey said in a statement.
   The civil penalty amounts to $1.25 million.
   The fuel flowed into the Monongahela and Ohio rivers when a
storage tank ruptured at the company's facility in Jefferson, south
of Pittsburgh.
   The spill killed thousands of fish and birds and forced public
water systems in three states to stop drawing from the rivers.

<HEAD>Arafat to Bush: Be More Aggressive Toward Israel</HEAD>
<DATELINE>JERUSALEM (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   PLO chief Yasser Arafat urged President Bush to
adopt a more aggressive stance toward Israel and criticized the
Israeli proposal for elections in the occupied territories,
state-run radio said today.
   But in a message sent to Bush in Washington, the Palestinian
leader did not rule out talks between Israel and Palestinians
``under the right conditions,'' Israel radio said.
   The radio did not say how it obtained a copy of the message,
which it said was marked ``classified.'' The radio's Arab affairs
reporter read a Hebrew translation of the message.
   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said on Tuesday that Bush
had received a message from Arafat ``in the last couple of days,''
but he refused to divulge its contents. ``It was a private message
and was sent orally in order to keep it private,'' Fitzwater said.
   In the message, Arafat said an increasing number of Palestinians
believe Israel is not seriously searching for a political solution,
according to the radio report.
   ``This is creating an atmosphere that rouses the radicals
against the moderates, and it makes it difficult for us to keep up
the hopes of our people. Patience is waning,'' Arafat was quoted as
saying.
   ``The Palestinian nation believes the United States' obligation
to Israel's security should not prevent it from acting with a
balanced policy that takes into account the legitimate rights of
the Palestinian nation and the needs of both sides of the
conflict,'' Arafat reportedly said.
   ``A more aggressive attitude by the U.S. toward Israel would
raise our hopes ... all the while goading Israel to adopt a
reasonable stance,'' he was quoted as saying.
   In the message, Arafat said Israel's plan for elections in the
occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip is really aimed at establishing a
body to replace the PLO, the radio reported.
   ``Understandably, our people in the occupied territories are
aware of this Israeli tactic and will foil every Israeli attempt to
achieve this goal,'' Arafat was quoted as saying.
   Israel's Foreign Ministry refused to react to the message or
speculate on how it may have been leaked to Israel radio.

<TEXT>
   East Germany's ruling Politburo, facing
growing challenges to Communist domination, today proposed talks
with ``other political forces'' to discuss free elections and other
reforms.
   The wording of the brief statement from the official news agency
ADN appeared to indicate that the growing opposition movement would
be included at the proposed ``round-table'' talks.
   ADN did not specify a date for the talks.
   It was one of the Communists' most significant concessions to
the opposition in the current unrest.
   Leader Egon Krenz is clearly concerned that even though he has
allowed free travel and opened the Berlin Wall, huge crowds are
still demanding further political reforms such as those under way
in Poland and Hungary.
   The ``round-table'' format was used in Poland to help bring
about the Solidarity-led government there. It was not clear whether
the East German Politburo intends to follow the same format.
   According to ADN, the Politburo presented the proposal ``for the
political parties united in the government coalition to meet at a
round table with other political forces in the country.''
   The ``other political forces'' appeared to refer to the
indepenedent pro-democracy groups that have mushroomed in recent
weeks. The smaller established political parties already are part
of the government coalition.
   ``There (at the talks) the ideas about a new elections law, the
implementation of free, democratic elections and a reform of the
Constitution could be discussed,'' the ADN dispatch said.
   Parliament already is considering a change to rid the
Constitution of the Communist monopoly on power. Free elections
have been promised for next year or 1991.
   Earlier today, Krenz said the party remains vital to the
country's future.
   Krenz, who faces an early challenge to his leadership at a party
congress next month, also indicated today that he intends to stay
in his post.
   Speaking at a factory, Krenz said the party will keep its grip
on the nation's factories _ a traditional source of local control _
and won't let itself be pushed ``up against the wall'' by the
growing oppostion, ADN said.
   Krenz is likely to have to fight for his job when the special
party congress meets Dec. 15-17, with power to redefine Communist
policy and to choose a new leadership. Krenz has been party chief
since Oct. 18.
   ``I didn't take over to push for change just for four weeks,''
Krenz told workers in East Berlin, according to ADN.
   Krenz said the party congress must address the question of
responsibility for the current situation, but cautioned against
``pre-judgment.'' A parliament committee already is weighing
possible criminal charges against Krenz's predecessor, Erich
Honecker, and his inner circle.
   West Germany's mass-circulation Bild newspaper said today that
Guenter Mittag, Honecker's former right-hand man and economy czar,
was questioned for 14 hours last week. It said investigators want
to find out in which Swiss bank accounts the secret police and
Communist Party hid ``hundreds of millions of (West German) marks.''
   East Germany's Liberal Democrats, long allied with the
Communists, have been leading calls for an end to the Communist
monopoly on power.
   The party's No. 2 official, Hans-Dieter Raspe, told ADN the
Liberal Democrats are proposing to put one of their members into a
revised presidential post as head of state.
   At present, Krenz holds the post of head of state as well as
party chief. His title as head of state is Chairman of the Council
of State. That post would be abolished under the Liberal Democrats'
plan.
   Manfred Gerlach, who heads the Liberal Democrats, said at his
first open news conference today that the government should
recognize democratic movements like the New Forum group and allow
them to compete with established parties.
   Krenz has come under bitter attack from the growing opposition
movement, as well as by the government-controlled National Zeitung
newspaper.
   The National Zeitung said people do not believe Krenz will carry
out reforms, many of which he has discussed in careful generalities.
   The critics have stressed Krenz's role as a member of Honecker's
old guard, his support for the Chinese crackdown on the
pro-democracy movement in June, and his alleged involvment in
election fraud.

<DATELINE>DALLAS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Dozens of people marked today's 26th anniversary
of President Kennedy's assassination by visiting the plaza where he
was gunned down.
   ``It was a gray cloud over Dallas for such a long time. I think
it's an event that needs to be remembered but not dwelled upon,''
said Ron Thompson, 34, a lifelong Dallas resident making his first
visit to Dealey Plaza.
   Thompson said he was in third grade when Kennedy died.
   ``It was a strange day,'' he said. ``I was in school and all of
a sudden everybody was crying. I was real young but still it was
something else.''
   Rain kept early visitors from Dealey Plaza, but by mid-morning
about 70 tourists and Dallas residents had stopped. Neither the
Kennedy family nor the city stages any public memorial at the
assassination site.
   ``We had to stop here,'' said Max Ooley of Borden, Ind., who was
traveling with his wife to visit their son in San Antonio for
Thanksgiving.
   ``I always wondered about the conspiracy aspect of it,'' he said
as he looked across Elm Street at the grassy knoll, which figured
in the Warren Commission investigation of the assassination.
   Conspiracy theorists believe there was more than one gunman and
that some of the shots came from the knoll. The Warren Commission
said Lee Harvey Oswald acted alone, firing from the sixth floor of
the former Texas School Book Depository.
   In Februrary, the Dallas County Historical Foundation opened an
exhibit on the sixth floor. Previously, a cenotaph, or empty tomb,
was the city's only Kennedy memorial.
   Exhibit security supervisor David Kilbourn said about 900 people
tour the exhibit each day, but Tuesday's total was almost double
that, and he expected more people would show up today.
   ``Certainly, Dallas is linked in the minds of people with three
things: the assassination, the Cowboys and the TV show,'' said Bob
Hays, interim director of the historical foundation.
   ``You go out here any hour of the day or night and see people
standing in Dealey Plaza pointing and taking photographs.''

   Congress came together early today to complete
work on catastrophic health care and the budget deficit and adjourn
for the year, leaving behind a record notable as much for its own
internal business as for public policy.
   As they headed for the exits, the House and Senate adopted a
$14.7 billion deficit-cutting bill that relied heavily on
accounting gimmicks to make the required savings, and voted to
cancel a program that covers catastrophic health care costs for the
elderly.
   Both bills were forwarded to President Bush for his signature,
and the Senate adjourned at 4:07 a.m., with the House following
suit 24 minutes later.
   Before leaving, the House and Senate also managed to complete
work on all 13 money bills needed to run the federal government for
the coming year. But as they looked back on 1989, they saw little
to brag about.
   ``We made no new bold initiatives in public policy,'' said House
Minority Leader Robert Michel, R-Ill. The best that could be said,
he added, was that House leaders have laid aside the bitter
atmosphere in which the year started and set the stage for real
achievements next year.
   In the annual adjournment telephone call to the president at
12:47 a.m., Michel told Bush ``the whole attitude around here has
had a decided change.'' To underscore that point, Michel won
approval on the House floor of a resolution thanking Speaker Thomas
S. Foley, D-Wash., for his ``impartial'' stewardship of the House.
   When Senate leaders called Bush three hours later, the president
said ``when all the dust settles, I think you had a pretty good
session of the whole Congress.''
   Foley, who took over the reins at mid-year when his
ethics-scarred predecessor Jim Wright resigned, agreed. He listed
``creating a mood of comity and confidence'' as his top
accomplishment.
   But much of the session was consumed by controversies over the
ethics of members of Congress and efforts to raise lawmakers' pay.
Wright's ethics case tied up the House for nearly half the year,
and six senators became snared in ethics controversies as the year
ended.
   ``This is the unfinished Congress,'' said Rep. Newt Gingrich,
R-Ga., the No. 2 GOP leadership official in the House. ``The jury
is still out.''
   Among accomplishments were the first increase in the minimum
wage since 1981, although it was less than Democrats sought; a new
bipartisan approach toward U.S. policy in Nicaragua; passage of a
massive bailout for the savings and loan industry; aid to encourage
political and economic reforms taking place in Poland and Hungary;
and an extensive anti-drug package.
   The Capitol's Democratic leaders also claimed credit for barring
several things that didn't take place: the nomination of John Tower
to be secretary of defense, a constitutional amendment banning flag
desecration and a cut in the tax rate on capital gains.
   At year's end, Congress also summoned its courage and approved
another initiative which lawmakers won't claim much credit for _ a
pay raise for themselves and other top federal officials. With it
came a series of ethics reforms, including a ban on acceptance of
speaking fees.
   Under a complicated formula, House members will see their
current $89,500 salary boosted to at least $120,800 over the next
13{ months in exchange for giving up their speaking fees.
   Senators will get only an $8,900 raise but they will be able to
keep speaking fees until the honoaria system is phased out over
many years.
   ``It's a session that began with some despair based on the
internal bickering, and ended with buoyancy based on the Congress
coming together on the pay raise,'' said Rep. Jim Leach, R-Iowa.
   He said the session reflected tension between a White House and
a Congress dominated by different parties, ``in which the executive
has prevailed in setting the agenda and reining in the instincts of
Congress to spend more.'' At the same time, ``Congress and world
events have laid the basis for greater executive branch restraint
on military spending in the coming years,'' he added.
   Foley listed an ambitious legislative agenda for the 101st
Congress in 1990, including clean air legislation, a major child
care initiative, new progress on reducing the budget deficit and
campaign finance reform. He said Congress may also need to
readdress the need for catastrophic health care coverage for the
elderly.
   Senate Minority Leader Bob Dole, R-Kan., agreed that some of
those would be high priorities. ``We'll be off to a fast start''
when Congress returns in January, he said.
   In the final hours of the 1989 session, the House insisted on
complete repeal of the catastrophic health care law, which paid for
long-term care in return for a surtax on wealthier retired people.
It was the surtax that prompted an outcry that led to moves to
scuttle the law.
   The final deficit-cutting package contained some actual savings
as well as some that were more illusory, such as shifting the
money-losing Postal Service off the budget. It imposed some $6
billion in new taxes, most on corporations, and relied on
across-the-board cuts triggered last month by the Gramm-Rudman
deficit-reduction law for another $4.6 billion.
   One bill that missed the adjournment boat was a two-year, $9.7
billion authorization measure for the State Department, the U.S.
Information Agency and the Board for International Broadcasting.
The measure, which also codified a series of trade sanctions
against China over its bloody crackdown on pro-democracy protesters
last spring, will have to be taken up again next year.

   Attorney General Dick Thornburgh today
filed an unprecendented national security declaration that could
kill the Iran-Contra criminal case against a former CIA station
chief.
   For the first time, the government invoked a provision of
federal law to bar disclosure of certain classified information, a
step that could lead to dismissal of criminal charges against
Joseph Fernandez.
   Independent counsel Lawrence E. Walsh, the Iran-Contra
prosecutor, immediately deplored the move, accusing Thornburgh in a
statement of trying to protect ``fictional secrets'' in a way that
could block the trial from going forward.
   Thornburgh's action was disclosed at a pre-trial proceeding
before U.S. District Judge Claude Hilton. The judge scheduled
another court session for Friday morning to provide an opportunity
to review the declaration.
   As CIA station chief in Costa Rica, Fernandez assisted White
House aide Oliver North's secret Contra resupply network at a time
when Congress had banned military assistance to the Nicaraguan
rebels by U.S. intelligence agencies.
   Fernandez is accused of obstructing the CIA inspector general's
office and the Tower Commission that investigated the Iran-Contra
affair and of making false statements about his activities on
behalf of North.
   Evidence that Fernandez plans to use in his defense would cause
``serious damage to the national security of the United States,''
Thornburgh said in a statement.
   Outside the U.S. Courthouse, Associate independent counsel
Laurence Shtasel said ``we are disappointed that the affidavit is
extremely broad'' and blocks the disclosure of ``information that
is generally known to the public.''
   ``An important prosecution is at stake,'' Shtasel said. ``Joseph
Fernandez is the highest-ranking CIA official ever indicted.''
   Justice Department spokesman David Runkel said the department
believes the Fernandez case still can be brought to trial, despite
the declaration.
   Ron Noble, a deputy assistant attorney general in the
department's criminal division, said there is ``always a
possibility'' that the government can come up with a way to bring
at least some of the charges against Fernandez.
   ``It is my abiding sense that further judicial examination ...
will establish the potential for accommodating both the defendant's
rights and the national security interests at stake, thereby
allowing this case to be tried to conclusion,'' Thornburgh said in
his statement, which Noble read in court.
   Fernandez's lawyer, Thomas Wilson, said the ``sword of
Damocles'' had been hanging over his client's head for three years
and that Hilton should dismiss the case now that the declaration
has been filed.
   Lawyers in Walsh's office asked the judge to let them respond in
writing before he makes a decision on any national security
affidavit filed by the department.
   After the hearing, Walsh issued a statement saying, ``We deplore
the fact that the attorney general for the first time has filed an
affidavit to protect fictional secrets which could prevent the
trial of a former high-ranking CIA official.''
   In July, Hilton said Fernandez must be allowed to present in his
defense details concerning CIA programs in Costa Rica and the
locations of agency stations in Honduras and El Salvador.
   Fernandez was to have gone to trial July 24, but Hilton rejected
a proposal by prosecutors that would have limited disclosure of the
classified material.
   The Justice Department sought to appeal Hilton's rulings to the
U.S. Court of Appeals in Richmond, Va., but that effort failed.
   Meanwhile, businessman Albert Hakim pleaded guilty Tuesday to a
misdemeanor while one of his corporations used to divert arms sale
profits pleaded guilty to a felony.
   The Iranian-born Hakim said in court that he helped pay for a
security fence at North's home with money from ``the Enterprise,''
the complex of foreign companies Hakim operated in the Iran-Contra
scandal.
   Lake Resources Inc., a Swiss company used as a conduit for Iran
arms sale money and aid to the Contras, pleaded guilty to theft of
government property, a felony carrying a maximum penalty of up to
$500,000. Hakim, who faces sentencing Feb. 1, was the principal
shareholder in Lake Resources.
   The plea agreement says that from late 1985 to November 1986,
Hakim, his business partner Richard Secord, North and national
security adviser John Poindexter used their influence ``to generate
and divert approximately $16.2 million ... to Enterprise bank
accounts.''
   U.S. District Judge Gerhard Gesell accepted the agreement after
meeting with prosecutors and defense attorneys.

   Some travelers beat the pre-Thanksgiving rush by getting on
planes, trains and automobiles early, while harsh weather _ already
blamed for 14 deaths in four states _ caused delays today.
   Airports braced for the stampede of people heading home today,
traditionally one of the heaviest travel days of the year.
   Six people were killed in separate traffic accidents on snowy
roads in Minnesota on Tuesday. The storm snarled evening rush-hour
traffic in the Twin Cities area and up to 6 inches of snow coated
parts of North Dakota today.
   Eight deaths were blamed on high wind, slick roads or cold in
Pennsylvania, New Jersey, Rhode Island and Maryland.
   And more than 200 Newark, N.J., residents were left homeless by
two wind-blown fires that destroyed a row of houses and an
apartment building.
   Edith and George Webber of rural Black Earth, Wis., had no
worries as they avoided the crunch and took a flight Monday to
Washington National Airport. They were being met by their son who
lives in Towson, Md.
   ``We offered to bring the turkey and he said `never mind,' so we
brought some Wisconsin cheese and some jams and stuff,'' said the
73-year-old Webber.
   Angela Ploof, 18, who works as a nanny in Bedford, N.Y., also
avoided the rush by leaving earlier this week for home in Mosinee,
Wis.
   ``It's a surprise for my mom,'' she said. ``It'll be a total
shock.''
   For today's travelers, the possibility of snow loomed over
several key airports.
   ``The weather reports for our four hubs _ Chicago, Denver,
Washington, D.C., and San Francisco _ indicates the possibility for
light snow to fall in three of those areas, with fog in San
Francisco,'' said Rob Doughty, spokesman for United Airlines, the
largest carrier at Chicago's O'Hare and the nation's second-largest.
   ``There is the potential for some delays across the system,'' he
said. ``When the weather affects the system, there's not a whole
lot any of us can do about it.''
   Light snow caused slight delays this morning at O'Hare, and the
Federal Aviation Administration implemented a nationwide air
traffic quota system, which keeps airplanes on the ground until
weather improves near their destinations.
   Dense fog had cut visibility to near zero Tuesday afternoon at
Salt Lake City's airport. The only planes allowed to land were
those equipped with new radar, said airport operations manager
Frank Ratliffe. The fog also contributed to commuter-hour accidents
on freeways, but none involved serious injuries.
   An estimated 210,000 people today were expected to pass through
O'Hare, the world's busiest airport. It usually handles about
160,000 per day.
   ``We advise that because of the volume of traffic, that people
leave earlier than usual for the airport,'' said Lisa Howard,
spokeswoman for the Chicago's Department of Aviation. ``And prior
to leaving, check with the airlines.''
   Los Angeles International Airport Manager Stephen Yee similarly
urged travelers to arrive at least two hours before domestic
flights and three for international flights to allow for long lines
at baggage check-in, ticket counters and passenger screening points.
   He also warned that closures in long-term parking facilities
were likely and urged travelers to use commuter shuttles.
   Maynard Scarborough, spokesman for Boston's Logan airport, said
a new program this year called ``Meet and Greet'' encourages people
to leave their cars at lots in the suburbs.
   ``People who park there are given a bus ticket which enables
them to ride into Logan on the bus at half-price, meet a traveler
who pays full fare and ride back,'' he said.
   The Baltimore-Washington Airport recruited Maryland Aviation
Administration employees to volunteer as ``holiday helpers'' for
the third year.
   The volunteers will be posted at busy locations to answer
questions and offer assistance to travelers.
   Amtrak reservations on the Seattle-to-San Francisco and
Seattle-to-Chicago runs today and Sunday have been sold out for two
months, said spokesman Art Lloyd.
   In New Jersey, one of the weather-related deaths occurred when a
tree toppled by gusting winds struck and killed a principal as she
was getting out of her car at her elementary school. And a
Baltimore woman died when a warehouse fell on her house.
   An 83-year-old woman in East Providence, R.I., suffered broken
bones in a fall, possibly caused by high wind, and died after
several hours outside in cold and rain, officials said.
   In Newark, Red Cross officials were attempting to find shelter
from the blustery weather for the 200 people displaced by the
fires. One of the fires apparently was started in abandoned
buildings by a homeless person trying to keep warm, authorities
said. The other blaze was arson, authorities said.
   Diane Curry, a first-floor resident of a burnt-out building,
fled safely through a window with her three children and pets.
   ``Everything's gone,'' she said. ``I'll stay with my sister
until I can be relocated.''

   An American Airlines pilot, confronting bad
weather en route to the East Coast, left it up to the passengers
whether to continue or return to O'Hare International Airport,
according to a report published today.
   On a show of hands, the passengers voted to continue to New
York, two passengers said.
   The weather during the flight Thursday became so bad that the
plane had to land about 60 miles away, at Stewart Airport near
Newburgh, N.Y. The trip was completed by bus.
   American Airlines today said it is investigating the Chicago
Sun-Times report involving Flight 492 to LaGuardia Airport.
   American spokesman Tom Stack said the airline had not been able
to determine whether the pilot actually left the decision up to
passengers.
   ``Normally I would think those kinds of things are decided by
air traffic control, in conjunction with the pilot,'' said Stack.
He added, ``We don't have any reaction because we're investigating
the circumstances.''
   The plane carried a cockpit crew of three and 62 passengers,
Stack said. He declined to identify the pilot.
   Federal Aviation Administration spokesman Don Zochert would not
say if the agency is investigating and referred calls to American.
   Passengers Fred and Muriel Sider of suburban Chicago said they
still can't believe what happened.
   ``I've been a travel agent for 20 years and never saw anything
like this,'' said Ms. Sider.
   ``The passengers were asked if they wanted to go ahead to New
York, where there were bad storms, or return to O'Hare,'' said her
husband, president of Fred Sider Advertising in Northbrook.
   ``Passengers who live in New York and people headed there on
business raised their hands that they wanted to go ahead,'' Ms.
Sider said. ``They were in the majority.''
   Sider said that after they landed he asked the pilot why he let
the passengers decide.
   ``He said he was following instructions from the tower,'' Sider
said.
   ``Not this tower,'' said Ralph Korner, manager of Stewart
Airport. ``That would be strictly an airline carrier's decision. I
never heard of such a thing. It sounds a bit strange.''
   A safety officer at Stewart Airport who declined to give his
name confirmed that the plane landed at the airport at 10:21 a.m.
Thursday, but said he hadn't heard about the incident.
   ``There was severe weather at that time,'' he said. ``That
particular morning there was a small tornado in the area.''
   At an elementary school near the airport, seven students were
killed and 18 injured when high winds collapsed a wall in the
school cafeteria.

   Jeanne Sharp, whose ancestors lived and
farmed in this rural New York community before the American
Revolution, is learning a hard lesson about rebellion: Governments
often fight back.
   Sharp and more than 300 other residents who filed a lawsuit
trying to block construction of a garbage incinerator are in turn
being sued, by lawmakers.
   ``I've been thinking a lot about Ethan Allen,'' said Sharp. ``I
have some idea of what my ancestors went through to get here.
   ``If they can put up with it, so can I.''
   Residents sued Washington County and adjoining Warren County
last year over the proposed incinerator, which is to be built in
Hudson Falls, about 40 miles north of Albany, to burn garbage for
both counties. They contend that local officials approved the plan
without a proper public hearing.
   The counties and their industrial development agency
countersued, seeking $1.5 million from 320 plaintiffs, most of them
Washington County residents. Washington County later dropped out,
but Warren County and the IDA remain.
   The residents, recognizable around the area by the bright orange
``PLAINTIFF'' bumper stickers affixed to their cars, say the
countersuit was filed to harass them into dropping their lawsuit.
   Environmentalists say it could have national implications for
other citizen action groups that turn to the courts to challenge
controversial projects. The environmental movement even has a name
for it _ a SLAPP suit, or Strategic Lawsuit Against Public
Participation.
   ``It's a strategy to hush people up and stop them from speaking
out,'' said Lois Gibbs, who led the fight over the Love Canal toxic
dump in Niagara Falls and now runs the Virginia-based Citizens
Clearinghouse for Hazardous Waste.
   ``This case stands out as the only one of its kind that I know
of where government chooses to sue its own people,'' said Will
Collette, Citizens Clearinghouse's SLAPP suit expert.
   Other SLAPP suits, which Collette calls ``legal terrorism,''
have been brought across the country by private companies involved
in projects. ``The idea is to squash the opposition.''
   People who bring SLAPP suits don't expect to win them, he said.
``They all get dropped. They never go to trial. Warren County has
no expectation of winning its case.''
   In Washington County, some supervisors told people they might
lose their homes or cars as a result of the countersuit, the
plaintiffs claim.
   ``They're trying to harass us and intimidate us down to a
handful of manageable troublemakers,'' said Melody Brown, who
admits to being one of the more vocal incinerator opponents being
sued.
   The countersuit contends the citizens' lawsuit was frivolous and
that actions by the incinerator opponents, during the sale of bonds
for the project, cost the counties $1.5 million.
   ``At the original closing date for the bond sale, there were
committed purchasers. As the result of the activities of the
citizens, those contracts were abrogated, it was necessary to enter
into new contracts, and passage of time and a change in the market
brought a $1.5 million loss,'' said Benjamin Pratt, a Glens Falls
lawyer for the counties and IDA. That loss increased the cost of
the project and with it the cost of burning garbage.
   Now the incinerator opponents want to add more litigation to the
fray _ a federal civil rights lawsuit in response to the lawsuit
against them. They've hired Atlanta-based civil rights lawyer
Robert Remar.
   ``The First Amendment to the Constitution gives all of us the
right to freedom of speech, freedom of association and the right to
petition government for redress of grievances,'' said Remar. ``When
a government seeks to basically punish the citizens for having
exercised those rights, that's a violation of the Constitution.''
   Pratt said the counterclaim doesn't violate anyone's civil
rights.
   ``They have the right to speak with respect to the proceedings
and actions being taken by the government. They have a right to sue
their government if they feel that something is done improperly.
But they don't have the right to ... perform in such a fashion that
they interfere with the contractual rights that the government has
with third parties and cause a $1.5 million loss.''
   Hammond Robertson, chairman of the Warren County Board of
Supervisors, said he supports the counterclaim, as has a majority
of that board every time someone moves to drop it.
   ``I have to recognize that people have some strong feelings on
this issue,'' said Robertson. ``But there are 110,000 people in
these two counties. We have some obligation to the other 100,000
people.''
   While the lawsuits go on over the $80 million incinerator _
resolution isn't expected until some time next year _ excavation is
nearing completion at the plant site next to the Hudson River.
   Meanwhile, the incinerator has hit a legal snag in yet another
lawsuit. A state judge ruled that the state should have required
more environmental assessments of the project before renewing its
latest permits. That suit was brought by the village of Hudson
Falls. Construction has stopped while the state considers whether
to appeal.
   The main point of the original lawsuit, whether there was a
public hearing on the project, is still in dispute. While Robertson
said a hearing wasn't required, Pratt said the two-county IDA held
one.
   Stephanie Wenk, another active incinerator opponent, said the
IDA hearing lasted just 45 minutes and that everyone wasn't allowed
to speak.
   ``The public hearing was a sham,'' said Wenk, who has been known
to tie a gag over her mouth at supervisors' meetings. ``They let 11
people speak out of 49 ... Then they just banged the gavel and that
was it.''

<HEAD>Bush Mourns ``Terroristic'' Killing of Lebanon's President</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Bush today denounced as
``disgraceful, terroristic'' the killing of Lebanon's newly elected
president, Rene Mouawad, and pledged continued U.S. assistance for
efforts to end Lebanon's 14-year civil war.
   ``It is a disgraceful performance and is condemned by the United
States of America,'' Bush said. ``However, we must not let this
brutal killing stand in the way of trying to bring peace to the
troubled corner of the world. I would like to offer the help of
America...to bring these killers to justice.''
   Bush, speaking to reporters aboard Air Force One during a flight
to Memphis, Tenn., for a speaking engagement, said the
administration had no official confirmation of reports Mouawad was
killed when a car bomb exploded as his motorcade passed by.
   ``It is a disgraceful, terroristic happening, if true,'' Bush
said. ``We have no official confirmation, but it looks to be true.
I think it is a direct setback to the tripartite effort of trying
to bring peace to Lebanon.''
   In Beirut, a police spokesman said Mouawad, president for only
17 days, died instantly in the blast, which came minutes after the
president held a reception marking Lebanon's Independence Day.
   At least 23 other people were reported killed, including 10 of
Mouawad's bodyguards.
   Mouawad, 64, a Maronite Catholic, was an advocate for
Christian-Moslem reconciliation in his country. He was elected Nov.
5 at a special Parliament session as part of an Arab
League-sponsored peace plan. His election was opposed by the
Christian leader, Gen. Michel Aoun.
   In Washington, the State Department issued a statement
condemning the death as a ``despicable act of terrorism against a
man of peace. ... We appeal for calm in Lebanon and extend our
deepest sympathies to the family of President Mouawad and all the
people of Lebanon.''
   On Capitol Hill, John H. Kelly, assistant secretary of state for
Near Eastern affairs, praised Mouawad as a ``conciliator''
determined to bring peace to Lebanon.
   ``I know all Americans feel sympathy and pain at another loss
for Lebanon,'' Kelly said during an appearance before a House
Foreign Affairs subcommittee on the Middle East.
   ``We will continue to support efforts to restore a functioning
government in Lebanon,'' Kelly said. ``We hope the spirit of
reconciliation that was represented by the installation of the new
government will survive this morning's terrible act.''

<DATELINE>PRAGUE, Czechoslovakia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   More than 200,000 people gathered
in downtown Prague today in the sixth straight day of
anti-government demonstrations, and tens of thousands of students
held sit-ins at universities to demand democratic reforms.
   Protest leaders threatened a general strike Monday to press
their demands.
   For the first time, government television carried live
broadcasts of the protest in downtown Wenceslas Square, showing
interviews with actors at the demonstration interspersed with film
of rock bands.
   But an announcer then came on the air and said the broadcasts
were being temporarily stopped because some employees of the
Czechoslovak state television did not agree with them.
   This was after they had shown a worker, a Communist Party member
for 20 years, who questioned official accounts of a demonstration
Friday that was brutally dispersed by police.
   ``What is the government afraid of? They may be afraid because
they are lying to us for 20 years,'' said the worker, identified as
Honza Lexa.
   Demonstrators chanted, ``Jakes to the dustbin!'' referring to
hard-line Communist Party boss Milos Jakes, who unlike other East
bloc leaders has resisted reforms introduced by Soviet President
Mikhail S. Gorbachev.
   The country's leading human rights activist, playwright Vaclav
Havel, was greeted with chants of ``Long live Havel!''
   ``Those who have for long years made bloody vengeance to those
who opposed them are now afraid of us,'' Havel told the crowd.
``After 20 years of timelessness, history is coming back to this
country.''
   Elsewhere in Czechsolovakia, 80,000 students and intellectuals
staged sit-in strikes and vowed to go ahead with a general strike
next week. They claimed growing worker support, despite
conciliatory moves by the Communist premier.
   Sharp divisions emerged in the ruling elite.
   While Jakes has maintained a hard line against the protesters,
Premier Ladislav Adamec on Tuesday met with a delegation that
included prominent dissidents, an unprecedented event that all but
legitimized the burgeoning opposition movement.
   Members of the group said Adamec was conciliatory, telling them
authorities were open to dialogue with the opposition, whose
leaders have long been harrassed by police and jailed on charges of
anti-socialist agitation.
   He reportedly told them that neither martial law nor police
force would be used to block protests.
   Church sources said a Jakes ally met today with Roman Catholic
Cardinal Frantisek Tomasek, who lent his influential voice to the
pro-democracy movement in a strongly worded appeal Tuesday.
   The sources, who asked not to be identified, said Tomasak's
meeting with hard-line Prague Communist Party boss Miroslav Stepan
focused on a planned Mass Saturday that could become a focus for
demands for more religious freedom.
   In the southern city of Bratislava, 200 people today prayed and
called for freedom outside the Palace of Justice in a protest
urging the release of dissident Jan Carnogursky on trial for
sedition and subversion.
   Well-informed sources who spoke on condition of anonymity said
the Communist Party's policy-making Central Committee would
probably meet on Friday to discuss the burgeoning political crisis.
   The state-run media, which has begun reporting criticism of the
government, estimated 80,000 students holding sit-in strikes at
Prague University and other schools around the country. The
students have called a two-hour general strike for Monday and claim
growing support from the workers.
   Jan Ruml, one of the four members of the newly formed Civic
Forum who attended the talks with Adamec, said the group was
sticking to its demands for the resignation of Jakes, Stepan and
other top leaders.
   ``We unequivocably support the strike of students, theater and
creative artists and support a general strike on Nov. 27,'' he
added.
   Vladimir Hanzal, a musician, told a packed Civic Forum news
conference that 1,400 workers at Prague's CKD factory _ the city's
biggest industrial enterprise _ had voted to join the general
strike.
   The information could not be independently confirmed. The
official youth daily Mlada Fronta quoted an unidentified worker at
the factory as saying employees would join the student-led strike,
then make up the two hours of missed work later.
   More than 150,000 people rallied on Prague's central Wenceslas
Square on Tuesday, emboldened by the tide of democratic change that
is ending one-party rule in Poland and Hungary and has brought
broad changes to East Germany.
   Thousands of other protesters gathered in at least 14 other
cities and towns. The large-scale provincial demonstrations were
the first since a 1968 Soviet-led invasion crushed the ``Prague
Spring'' reform movement.
   Havel and others spoke from the balcony of the building housing
offices of Svobodne Slovo, the voice of the Socialist Party and the
first official newspaper to denounce the police repression of a
rally Friday in Prague. Police have since shown restraint.
   Adamec, according to the people who met him, said he approved of
a ``different concept of the leading role of the (Communist)
party'' but that socialism must be protected.
   The party's leading role is laid down in the Czechoslovak
Constitution.
   Adamec also said, according to the group members, that he
favored including non-communists in his government.

<TEXT>
   President Rene Mouawad was killed today
when a bomb exploded on a street in Moslem west Beirut as his
motorcade passed by. He had been president only 17 days.
   A police spokesman said Mouawad died instantly in the blast,
which came minutes after the president held a reception marking
Lebanon's Independence Day. The spokesman refused to say why police
initially reported Mouawad was not hurt in the blast.
   At least 23 other people were reported killed, including 10 of
Mouawad's bodyguards.
   Col. Mohammed Khashab, a police bomb squad official, said the
bomb was hidden in a small shop and detonated by remote control. He
denied earlier reports that a car, which was set ablaze by the
blast, had contained the explosives.
   There was no immediate claim of responsibility. The bomb went
off at 1:45 p.m. on Bustros Boulevard in the Sanayeh district. It
was so powerful it hurled the president's bulletproof Mercedes
limousine several yards off the street.
   Mouawad, 64, a Maronite Catholic, had long advocated
Christian-Moslem reconciliation in his country. He was elected Nov.
5 at a special Parliament session as part of an Arab
League-sponsored peace plan aimed at ending Lebanon's 14-year-old
civil war.
   He was sworn in the same day, despite strong objections by the
Christian leader, Gen. Michel Aoun, who opposed the plan. The
parliamentary session was moved to Syrian-controlled north Lebanon
after Aoun threatened to shell it.
   Mouawad's top aides, Prime Minister-designate Salim Hoss, a
Sunni Moslem, and Parliament Speaker Hussein Husseini, a Shiite
Moslem, also were in the 10-car convoy, in the vehicle behind the
president's. Police said they were not hurt.
   ``It is a national disaster,'' Hoss said in a radio address to
the nation, 2{ hours after the explosion. ``President Rene Mouawad
was assassinated by the hand of treason,'' he said, his voice
breaking with emotion.
   Syria's state-run media issued a similar statement today,
condemning the assassination and blaming it on ``the hand of
betrayal and treason.''
   President Bush denounced the assassination as ``disgraceful,
terroristic'' and pledged continued U.S. assistance for efforts to
end Lebanon's civil war. ``It is a disgraceful performance and is
condemned by the United States of America,'' Bush said.
   ``However, we must not let this brutal killing stand in the way
of trying to bring peace to the troubled corner of the world. I
would like to offer the help of America...to bring these killers to
justice,'' Bush said.
   In other early reaction, an Israeli official described the
murder as a defeat for Syria. In Paris, National Assembly deputies
held a moment of silence.
   A statement from Hoss's office said Hoss and Husseini had
convened in ``crisis talks'' to prepare for a quick Parliament
session to elect a successor to Mouawad.
   The statement stressed that the leaders were trying to avoid a
political vacuum that would undermine the peace plan, which was
approved last month.
   Aoun objected to the plan because it did not include a timetable
for the withdrawal of the 40,000 Syrian troops in Lebanon. He
denounced Mouawad as a Syrian puppet.
   The Syrians were deployed in Lebanon in 1976 under a
peacekeeping mandate to quell civil war fighting. Aoun said they
abrogated the mandate by siding with the Moslems in the civil war,
and he has vowed to drive them out.
   On Sept. 14, 1982, President-elect Bashir Gemayel, a Maronite,
was assassinated.
   His brother, Amin Gemayel, became president and served until his
term ran out in September 1988. From that time until Mouawad's
election, Lebanon had been without a president because Parliament
was unable to agree on a president.
   The police spokesman, speaking on condition of anonymity in line
with standing regulations, said 23 people, including 10 of
Mouawad's bodyguards, were also killed today. He identified the
dead bodyguards as six Syrian army soldiers and four Lebanese
soldiers.
   The spokesman also said 36 people, including many civilians,
were injured.
   Mouawad and his aides had just left Government House in Sanayeh,
where they were hosts to foreign diplomats, parliamentarians and
other dignitaries at a reception marking Independence Day.
   Lebanon gained independence from France on Nov. 22, 1943.
   Hundreds of Syrian soldiers and Lebanese army troops and
policemen converged on the scene. The Syrians fired their rifles
and several rocket-propelled grenades in the air to clear the way
for ambulances. Most of the victims were quickly picked up by
civilian cars and rushed to hospitals before ambulances arrived.
   The streets emptied of civilians, who apparently feared an
outbreak of shelling duels between Aoun's troops and allied Syrian
and Moslem forces.
   Voice of Lebanon radio broadcast appeals for blood donations.
   The Independence Day celebration in Sanayeh was markedly
low-key, but all ambassadors accredited to Lebanon attended,
underscoring their countries' recognition of Mouawad as head of
state.
   In east Beirut, about 1,000 soldiers of Aoun's mainly Christian
units held a symbolic parade at the military academy in the
garrison town of Fayadiyeh.
   The French, British, Italian, Turkish and Chinese military
attaches attended the celebration. Seven helicopters hovered
overhead as three aging Hawker Hunter jets fighters made a single
low run over the parade grounds.
   Brig. Gen. Issam Abu Jamra, one of the three officers in Aoun's
breakway military Cabinet, presided over the parade.
   Aoun reportedly fears an attempt on his life and seldom ventures
out of the bunker under the devastated presidential palace in the
Beirut suburb of Baabda.
   Mouawad is survived by a wife, Nayla Koury, and two children _
Michel, 17, and Rima, 22.
   Before being elected president, Mouawad had been a member of the
99-seat Parliament since he was elected to represent his home
region of Zghorta in 1957 at the age of 32. His assassination
leaves only 72 surviving members of the Parliament.

<HEAD>Deficit, Health Care Bring Congress' Year to a Close</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: LEADS with 5 grafs to UPDATE with comment from Bush, Mitchell.
Picks up 4th graf pvs `Before leaving ...</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JIM DRINKARD</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   Congress early today repealed catastrophic
health care, passed a deficit-reduction bill and adjourned for the
year, leaving behind a record notable as much for its own internal
business as for public policy.
   President Bush said he was pleased with the outcome, especially
the deficit package that took most of the year to complete. He
praised both Democrats and Republicans for ``a spirit of real
cooperation.''
   ``We have laid the foundation for a very productive session''
when Congress returns in January, Senate Majority Leader George
Mitchell, D-Maine, told reporters.
   As they headed for the exits, the House and Senate adopted a
$14.7 billion deficit-cutting bill that relied heavily on
accounting gimmicks to make the required savings, and voted to
cancel a program that covers catastrophic health care costs for the
elderly.
   Both bills were forwarded to Bush for his signature, and the
Senate adjourned at 4:07 a.m., with the House following suit 24
minutes later.
   Before leaving, the House and Senate also managed to complete
work on all 13 money bills needed to run the federal government for
the coming year. But as they looked back on 1989, they saw little
to brag about.
   ``We made no new bold initiatives in public policy,'' said House
Minority Leader Robert Michel, R-Ill. The best that could be said,
he added, was that House leaders have laid aside the bitter
atmosphere in which the year started and set the stage for real
achievements next year.
   In the annual adjournment telephone call to the president at
12:47 a.m., Michel told Bush ``the whole attitude around here has
had a decided change.'' To underscore that point, Michel won
approval on the House floor of a resolution thanking Speaker Thomas
S. Foley, D-Wash., for his ``impartial'' stewardship of the House.
   When Senate leaders called Bush three hours later, the president
said ``when all the dust settles, I think you had a pretty good
session of the whole Congress.''
   Foley, who took over the reins at mid-year when his
ethics-scarred predecessor Jim Wright resigned, agreed. He listed
``creating a mood of comity and confidence'' as his top
accomplishment.
   But much of the session was consumed by controversies over the
ethics of members of Congress and efforts to raise lawmakers' pay.
Wright's ethics case tied up the House for nearly half the year,
and six senators became snared in ethics controversies as the year
ended.
   ``This is the unfinished Congress,'' said Rep. Newt Gingrich,
R-Ga., the No. 2 GOP leadership official in the House. ``The jury
is still out.''
   Among accomplishments were the first increase in the minimum
wage since 1981, although it was less than Democrats sought; a new
bipartisan approach toward U.S. policy in Nicaragua; passage of a
massive bailout for the savings and loan industry; aid to encourage
political and economic reforms taking place in Poland and Hungary;
and an extensive anti-drug package.
   The Capitol's Democratic leaders also claimed credit for barring
several things that didn't take place: the nomination of John Tower
to be secretary of defense, a constitutional amendment banning flag
desecration and a cut in the tax rate on capital gains.
   At year's end, Congress also summoned its courage and approved
another initiative which lawmakers won't claim much credit for _ a
pay raise for themselves and other top federal officials. With it
came a series of ethics reforms, including a ban on acceptance of
speaking fees.
   Under a complicated formula, House members will see their
current $89,500 salary boosted to at least $120,800 over the next
13{ months in exchange for giving up their speaking fees.
   Senators will get only an $8,900 raise but they will be able to
keep speaking fees until the honoaria system is phased out over
many years.
   ``It's a session that began with some despair based on the
internal bickering, and ended with buoyancy based on the Congress
coming together on the pay raise,'' said Rep. Jim Leach, R-Iowa.
   He said the session reflected tension between a White House and
a Congress dominated by different parties, ``in which the executive
has prevailed in setting the agenda and reining in the instincts of
Congress to spend more.'' At the same time, ``Congress and world
events have laid the basis for greater executive branch restraint
on military spending in the coming years,'' he added.
   Foley listed an ambitious legislative agenda for the 101st
Congress in 1990, including clean air legislation, a major child
care initiative, new progress on reducing the budget deficit and
campaign finance reform. He said Congress may also need to
readdress the need for catastrophic health care coverage for the
elderly.
   Senate Minority Leader Bob Dole, R-Kan., agreed that some of
those would be high priorities. ``We'll be off to a fast start''
when Congress returns in January, he said.
   In the final hours of the 1989 session, the House insisted on
complete repeal of the catastrophic health care law, which paid for
long-term care in return for a surtax on wealthier retired people.
It was the surtax that prompted an outcry that led to moves to
scuttle the law.
   The final deficit-cutting package contained some actual savings
as well as some that were more illusory, such as shifting the
money-losing Postal Service off the budget. It imposed some $6
billion in new taxes, most on corporations, and relied on
across-the-board cuts triggered last month by the Gramm-Rudman
deficit-reduction law for another $4.6 billion.
   One bill that missed the adjournment boat was a two-year, $9.7
billion authorization measure for the State Department, the U.S.
Information Agency and the Board for International Broadcasting.
The measure, which also codified a series of trade sanctions
against China over its bloody crackdown on pro-democracy protesters
last spring, will have to be taken up again next year.

   A former policeman went on trial Wednesday
charged with injuring a protester detained during mass
demonstrations in East Berlin last month, the official ADN news
agency said.
   The policeman allegedly pushed the man down the stairs at a
police station after he was arrested during a large demonstration
Oct. 7.
   The demonstrations by tens of thousands of people in East Berlin
and other cities led to the ouster of hard-line Communist party
leader Erich Honecker.
   Police have not interfered with demonstrators since early
October. Honecker had ordered troops and police to shoot if
necessary to maintain order, but the order was rescinded by Egon
Krenz, who replaced Honecker as party leader Oct. 18.
   ADN identified the man brought to trial only as Horst L.,
without giving his full name. The agency said he was 41 and
referred to him as a ``former policeman,'' indicating he had been
sacked from the force.
   The agency said 76 cases of alleged police brutality are under
investigation.
   Police beat protesters in East Berlin, Dresden and other cities
in the early wave of unrest.

   British Airways grounded a Miami-bound jumbo jet
Wednesday after a flight attendant spotted a rat on board.
   The Boeing 747, which had flown to London from Washington, was
being prepared for departure from Heathrow Airport when the flight
attendant saw the rodent scurrying around the passenger cabin, the
airline said.
   None of the 297 passengers had boarded, it said.
   Airline officials said that fumigating the plane would have
taken up to eight hours, so Flight 293 was changed to another jumbo
jet, which left two hours late.
   The rat was caught and the plane fumigated, said an airline
spokeswoman.
   It was not known where the rat got on the plane.

   Chinese university students must ``adhere to
socialist collectivism and love labor,'' according to a new code
from the State Education Commission.
   The code will help students ``grow up to be socialist successors
more rapidly,'' said Education Commission official Zhang Renxian.
   The official Xinhua News Agency, which carried the remarks by
Zhang, did not provide details of the code, but said it demands
that students ``defend the interests of the motherland, abide by
the constitution, adhere to socialist collectivism and love labor.''
   It also takes up moral behavior, maintaining public order and
``abiding by the discipline of foreign affairs.''
   The government says that inadequate attention to mental and
physical discipline and political education led to the spring
pro-democracy student movement that was ended by a bloody military
crackdown on what authorities say was a counterrevolutionary
rebellion.
   Since June, all university students have been required to attend
classes on party doctrine and ideology.
   There also has been a renewed stress on physical labor, an
educational practice largely abandoned in the past decade.

   Elections that had been slated for
September 1990 have been postponed for at least two years in hopes
that the disputed Western Sahara will be able to join the voting,
King Hassan II said Wednesday.
   Hassan, who holds wide powers under Morocco's constitutional
monarchy, called on the United Nations to speed up plans to hold a
referendum in the territory to determine whether residents want to
live under Moroccan rule.
   In a speech broadcast to the nation, he told Moroccans that he
hoped the referendum could be held within two years with general
elections to follow afterward.
   Morocco has waged war against guerrillas of the Polisario Front
for control of the sparsely populated, mineral-rich territory since
Spain pulled out of its former colony in 1975.
   The guerrillas have stepped up their campaign against government
troops in recent weeks, with losses estimated in the hundreds for
both sides.

   As far back as Jumia Davi can remember,
she has been voting for the ruling Congress Party. And each time
she votes, the local party man has given her 10 rupees, about 60
cents.
   On Wednesday, the great-grandmother didn't get a thing.
   ``But I am still a supporter,'' said Mrs. Davi. ``I've seen a
lot more than broken campaign promises in my 100 years.''
   Mrs. Davi, who turned 100 last month, was one of tens of
millions of people to cast their ballots in the first day of
India's national elections to decide the fate of Prime Minister
Rajiv Gandhi's government.
   For Mrs. Davi, who is bent with age and unable to walk, voting
was difficult. She rode to the poll in the back of a bicycle
rickshaw accompanied by relatives, including her great-grandson who
walked alongside. The family is poor and can't afford a taxi.
   Her 70-year-old son carried her to the ballot box, but on the
way he slipped and Mrs. Davi fell to the ground, skinning her elbow.
   Once inside the booth, Mrs. Davi had to search for several
minutes to find the symbol of the prime minister's Congress Party.
   Like 63 percent of her countrymen, she is illiterate.
   ``I was looking for the big hand,'' she said, extending her palm
in a gesture similar to the Congress Party symbol. ``But I couldn't
find it. The ballot was too big.''
   The ballot, 2 feet long and a foot wide, was filled with the
names and symbols of 38 candidates.
   Finally, her daughter-in-law found the symbol and Mrs. Davi
shakily placed an ink stamp on the box.
   Mrs. Davi says she was perturbed this year that no one paid her
any money to vote.
   ``The Congress people promised it, but they failed me,'' she
said. ``I could use the money. Only my son is working but he also
is getting old.''
   Vote-buying is a tradition in India. Local party offices
function like businesses, dispensing jobs and money in exchange for
votes.
   In one section of the capital, hundreds of people were lined up
to vote and all of them said they had chosen Congress.
   ``They built all of our houses and gave most of us jobs,'' said
the headmaster of the school where the voting was being conducted.
``We owe it to them.''
   Mrs. Davi, who has long gray hair and twinkling black eyes, is a
Hindu who was born in what is now Lahore, Pakistan. She moved to
India shortly before independence in 1947 and said she has never
missed an election.
   ``You can call me an old women, but I love democracy,'' she says
daubing her injured arm with a piece of scrap cardboard. ``Look, I
am even bleeding for it.''

   Nov. 17
   Grants Pass (Ore.) Daily Courier on East bloc reform and Cuba:
   More than 40 years of pent-up frustration continues to spill
dramatically from the (tear) in Eastern Europe's communist
political fabric. ...
   The restless peoples of the East bloc have told their
governments they will no longer be put off in their desires for
basic personal freedoms and for political and economic reforms. ...
   Manufacturing facilities ... rust in a sea of obsolescence.
Collective farms ... have failed to feed the population that the
factories have failed to clothe. ...
   All of which must be giving the shakes to ... Fidel Castro. ...
All of the problems plaguing Eastern Europe plague Cuba as well,
and Castro must know the day is coming when the Cuban people demand
basic travel, trade and political freedoms. ...
   That day will be hastened when the Soviet Union _ now propping
up the anemic Cuban economy with massive financial aid and sugar
price subsidies _ weans Castro from his umbilical cord to Moscow
and tells him it's time for Cuba to shift for itself in the real
world.

   The Palm Beach Post, West Palm Beach, Fla., on Lech Walesa:
   Poland wants money from the United States. Lech Walesa came to
Washington last week with hat in hand, asking for a Marshall Plan
for his country. Brother, can you spare $3 billion.
   The sad truth is that the U.S. can't help ... Walesa now or
anytime soon. The Marshall Plan that saved Western Europe in the
late 1940s and early '50s cost $13 billion. Multiply that three or
four times to imagine what it would cost today.
   Then remember also that we are spending $165 billion each year
just to pay off our $2.8 trillion national debt. ...
   Other nations and our own citizens have always looked to the
U.S. government for action on the big problems. If we can't fix the
debt problem, they will learn how America can just say no.

   Baraboo (Wis.) News-Republic on national coordination against
abductions:
   The recent abduction of 11-year-old Jacob Wetterling near his
hometown of St. Joseph, Minn., once again casts an ugly light on
the fact that this country does not have a national clearinghouse
for information regarding missing children.
   While posters featuring the boy's picture and other relevant
information have been distributed throughout the nation, they
include three different telephone numbers for people to call with
information.
   Mothers have been told by police that it is easier to trace a
stolen automobile than it is to trace a missing child.
   That is a national disgrace.
   With advanced technology in the field of communications, there
is no justifiable reason the nation does not have one central place
where information regarding missing children can be processed.
   That clearinghouse could be the repository for information
regarding known child abductors and sexual molesters, as well as a
funnel for information regarding sightings of possible victims.
   Such a service would not only aid authorities in their search
for missing children but would also offer parents with missing
children a chance to keep completely up to date on the search for
their children.
   While the plight of Jacob Wetterling has touched millions across
this nation, even if he is found safe and sound, the publicity
surrounding this case will all be for naught if Congress does not
begin to seriously consider a national missing children's center.

   Columbia (Mo.) Daily Tribune on education:
   The issue is the poor performance of high school grads relative
to those in other nations.
   Why do we compare so poorly?
   Studies are showing that broad societal priorities are a factor.
In the United States, teen-agers are distracted by other influences
that diminish their interest in school. Parents and other adults
foster this dissuasion.
   Schooling today should be a deadly serious business, yet we
trivalize it. We do not respect and reward our system or our
teachers as much as citizens do in other lands where young people
are becoming better educated.
   We'd better wake up.

   The Providence (R.I.) Journal-Bulletin on coffee-cocaine:
   American negotiators in London walked away last July from an
international agreement that had propped up the price of coffee for
27 years. In so doing, they dealt Colombia and the United States a
serious defeat in the cocaine war.
   ...
   It seems obvious that the United States should not have taken a
bite out of Colombia's export earnings from coffee while it was
asking the Colombians to help curtail an even larger export _
cocaine. Indeed, it was obvious to President Bush and drug czar
William Bennett _ once they learned of the walkout. ...
   Coffee consumption is slipping: Only an estimated 52 percent of
Americans, for example, now drink coffee, down from 75 percent in
1962. Colombian farmers, most of whom are impoverished, already
have enough incentive to switch from coffee to coca without
American trade negotiators helping out.
   Apparently, American negotiators had objected to the coffee
producers' sales to Eastern bloc nations at discounted prices; and
they wanted a change in the quota structure to allow the United
States to receive higher grades of beans. ...
   Bennett must also keep an eye on obscure but important decisions
being made by such agencies as the Commerce Department and the
Office of the Special Trade Representative.

   Greensboro (N.C.) News &amp; Record on nuclear arms:
   The thrill of exerting world power isn't all that's behind the
formidable U.S. defense machine, but it's one factor in keeping it
intact. In the next few years, unless U.S. leaders remain blind to
warning signals, that power-high may have to come down.
   One obvious signal, of course, is the cut in Soviet defense
forces this year. Long promised by (Soviet President Mikhail S.)
Gorbachev, it appears that a 1 percent cut has already occurred and
that cuts will increase next year.
   Gorbachev has little choice. The expense of waging a nuclear
arms race against the United States and of defending Eastern Europe
ravaged the Soviet economy.
   Occurring as they do side-by-side with the new openness of
glasnost, Soviet defense cuts and economic shifts are easily
interpreted by Westerners as ideological turnarounds. Far from it:
Soviet ideology lives.
   But the ledger has the same columns the world around. Soviets
can't afford to wage the cold war any longer, and the United States
can't either. Watching the Soviets face facts in red and black ink
should prompt Americans to do the same.
   The post-war alignment has cost this country dearly in
protecting and gaining the allegiance of other nations. It may have
drawn U.S. concerns outward at the expense of domestic needs, now
perhaps the strongest warning signals of all.
   It's hard to find a time in U.S. history when there were more
urgent crises in housing and education. The drug trade has thrust
an unprecedented challenge on our society.
   Solving these will require wholesale budget changes that far
exceed simply meeting Gramm-Rudman requirements: They demand
nothing less than a revised set of national priorities.
   At a time when Europeans are looking beyond immediate political
changes and talking about long-range goals, so Americans should be
assessing where we want to be in five years, and 10, and 20. Our
world position then is likely to be determined by our domestic and
economic health _ at home.

   Move over L.L. Bean.
   The new guy on the block is a catalog company that sells
everything from recycled toilet paper to a $2,295 trip to the Costa
Rican rain forest _ and gives free birch tree seeds with every
order.
   Sound quirky? Its owners used to think so, but the catalog for
the environmentally conscious is winning praise from interest
groups that hope it soon will be as mainstream as the Freeport,
Maine, outfit.
   ``It's 100 percent business, 100 percent philosophy,'' said Alan
Newman, co-owner of Seventh Generation, Products for a Healthy
Planet. ``If we are successful, we will be successful because of
our ability to sell to someone who doesn't consider themselves
environmentalists.''
   Jonathan Schorsch of the Council for Economic Priorities and
co-author of the book ``Shopping for a Better World'' said Seventh
Generation is on the leading edge of a spreading movement. He said
a few similar companies have sprung up on the West Coast.
   ``I don't think that means buyers can be less aware,'' Schorsch
added. ``It still requires a certain amount of homework on how
green these products are.''
   Seventh Generation sells biodegradable garbage bags, cleaners
made of organic ingredients, beeswax crayons, organic flea powder,
portable water filters, solar flashlights and energy-efficient
lighting products.
   Joanne Hurley of the Sierra Club applauded the company's
educational approach. The catalog explains products and their
benefits and tells readers where to get more information.
   John Rustin, an economic analyst for the New York-based
Environmental Defense Fund, said Walmart, a major retailer, has
been looking for environmentally sound products to sell in its
discount stores.
   Newman, peering out from behind lime green glasses and clad in
jeans, a flannel shirt and Birkenstock sandals, owns the catalog
company with his pin-striped New York partner Jeffrey Hollender.
   Their styles are as different as their wardrobes _ Newman's
battered address book is covered in scribbled notes; Hollender's is
columned and neatly printed. But they share a devotion to the earth.
   ``It's nice to have a business that is so supportive of a
philosophy I've had for years,'' Newman said. ``It's also nice that
our success is directly linked with the degree we help our
customers clean up the environment.''
   Seventh Generation is filling more than 1,000 orders a week and
fighting a backlog. The company also has turned down 2,500 items
for the catalog.
   Newman's favorite item is the toilet paper, made from recycled
paper products. Newman figures if people are brave enough to try
recycled toilet paper, they've crossed a prissy line and are open
to other products.
   ``I remember when it used to be quirky,'' Newman said. ``But
it's something so simple and really makes a difference. Here was
have something that was on its way to clog a landfill. And using it
causes us to not have to cut down more trees.''
   Newman and Hollender entered the project last year with a wary
eye.
   ``I really thought the marketplace was five or eight years away,
and the marketplace has a way of chewing up people who get in ahead
of their time,'' Newman said.
   He had been running another catalog company and was advising the
national advocacy group Renew America with its catalog operation.
Renew America decided to get out of the catalog business and
offered to sell to Newman.
   He said their catalog targets environmental groups, other
catalog mailing lists and those who inquire about it. But the key
to converting the public, they say, is to make it easy and
inexpensive to be environmentally conscious.

<HEAD>Mayor Claims Trump Hotel Owes City $2.8 Million</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Mayor Edward I. Koch claims a hotel partly owned
by his longtime nemesis, billionaire developer Donald Trump, owes
the city $2.8 million under a lease agreement, but a state agency
is cool to the idea.
   The mayor said Tuesday he had asked the state to demand payment
from the Grand Hyatt Hotel.
   Harold Holzer, spokesman for the state Urban Development Corp.,
which acts as the city's agent in the lease arrangement, said the
UDC wants an independent auditor to make sure the case is
``separate from City Hall's relationship with Donald Trump.''
   The hotel issued a statement calling the city's claim a
``blatantly political attack'' and ``one last cheap shot'' at Trump
by Koch.
   ``Totally untrue,'' the mayor responded.
   Koch said an audit ``reveals disturbing accounting practices
that we want rectified.'' He said the audit was initiated ``without
my knowledge.''
   The hotel's statement characterized the issue as ``a dispute
amongst accountants and attorneys over technical accounting
determinations and legal interpretations.''
   Karen Burstein, the city's auditor general, said that in 1985,
Hyatt revenue reached $78 million and the operating partnership
paid $3.7 million as percentage rental. But the following year, she
said, revenue rose to $79.9 million and rental paid to the city
fell to $667,155 under new accounting procedures.

<HEAD>Town Seeks Reduced Prison Term for Convicted Doctor</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PEORIA, Ill. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The trouble of recruiting doctors to
small-town America prompted a hospital official to support a
lighter prison term for a felon he wants to hire as a doctor.
   An administrator for Jarman Hospital in Tuscola asked U.S.
District Judge Michael Mihm on Tuesday for an early release for
Monty McClellan, convicted of felony bankruptcy fraud.
   McClellan also has a malpractice charge pending against him
stemming from the death of a patient in 1984.
   But administrator Mark Fedyk, who said he was unaware of the
malpractice charge, insisted the hospital needs a doctor. ``It's
very difficult to recruit people to small towns,'' he said.
   Tuscola is a town of 3,800 about 100 miles southeast of Peoria.
   McClellan was convicted in January 1988 and sentenced to eight
years in prison, but a federal appeals court ruled Mihm erred by
giving him more than the maximum five years allowed for bankruptcy
fraud.
   At the resentencing hearing Tuesday, Mihm agreed to delay a
decision until Jan. 19, and urged hospital officials to scrutinize
McClellan's record.
   Mihm said Utah's medical licensing board limited McClellan's
practice for ``gross incompetence'' in treating patients.
   ``If I were to let him out early and something were to happen
while he was working there, I don't want any blame for that,'' Mihm
said, ordering part of McClellan's confidential file turned over to
hospital and city officials.
   ``I want to make sure ... they are fully informed of any warts
and wrinkles we are informed of.''
   ``We wouldn't have any problem letting the whole community know
about his problems,'' said Richard Parsons, McClellan's attorney.
``I hasten to point out to the court that malpractice suits against
doctors are common.''
   McClellan filed for bankruptcy protection in Illinois in 1984
and moved to West Jordan, Utah. He was convicted of bankruptcy
fraud, mail fraud and lying to a bank about his income to secure
loans. Prosecutors said he sold two sports cars to his father
shortly before his bankruptcy filing to hide them from creditors.

<TEXT>
   Best-selling author Robert Fulghum spelled out
his credo in his first book, ``All I Need To Know I Learned In
Kindergarten.'' Fulghum's simple philosophy has captured the
imagination of millions of readers.
   It is:
   Share everything.
   Play fair.
   Don't hit people.
   Put things back where you found them.
   Clean up your own mess.
   Don't take things that aren't yours.
   Say you're sorry when you hurt somebody.
   Wash your hands before you eat.
   Flush.
   Warm cookies and cold milk are good for you.
   Live a balanced life _ learn some and think some and draw and
paint and sing and play and work every day some.
   Take a nap every afternoon.
   When you go out into the world, watch out for traffic, hold
hands and stick together.
   Be aware of wonder. Remember the little seed in the Styrofoam
cup. The roots go down and the plant goes up and nobody really
knows how or why but we are all like that.
   Goldfish and hamsters and white mice and even the little seed in
the Styrofoam cup _ they all die. So do we.
   And then remember the Dick-and-Jane books and the first word you
learned _ the biggest word of all _ LOOK.

   South Carolina Gov. Carroll Campbell on
Wednesday thanked Americans for their help in the wake of Hurricane
Hugo and urged tourists to return to prime vacation spots in his
state.
   ``This storm left us bent and bruised, but thanks to all the
outside help and the strength of our people, we're not broken,'' he
said.
   ``South Carolina is coming back strong. Anybody who says
otherwise is packing more wind than Hugo.''
   Campbell said at a news conference that tourism is a major
industry in South Carolina, bringing in $4.7 billion in revenue and
providing 97,000 jobs.
   He said many hurricane-ravaged tourist areas rebounded quickly.
   ``Unfortunately, some of the publicity we received as a result
of the storm created misconceptions and made many potential
visitors uneasy,'' Campbell said. ``We want to make sure travellers
know that our vacation destinations are on line and can still
provide visitors with a great experience.''
   Hugo, he said, killed 18 people and caused an estimated $6
billion in damage when it slammed into the South Carolina coast
Sept. 22. He said about 16,000 state residents are still homeless
because of the storm.
   Wylie Whisonant Jr., deputy undersecretary of commerce for
travel and tourism, appealed to the media to ``give as much
coverage to the recovery process as was afforded the destruction.''
   ``This is particularly vital to the tourism industry, which
relies on image to induce sales,'' he said. ``Often the effects of
inaccurate or incomplete coverage can be just as damaging
economically to an area as the initial destructive force.''

   When Hurricane Hugo hit South Carolina two
months ago, Pamela Muirhead lost her home, her belongings and the
silversmith tools she used to make her living.
   But Ms. Muirhead and her friends will put their problems aside
for a time and gather Thursday for a special Thanksgiving dinner.
   ``I'm really lucky that I can look forward to a good potluck
with friends who I love a lot,'' said Ms. Muirhead of Folly Beach,
near Charleston. ``I feel really bad for the people who are here
who don't have the friends I have.''
   Because life has not returned to normal for thousands in South
Carolina who survived Hugo, the American Red Cross and NAACP have
joined with churches to prepare Thanksgiving dinner at 13 sites for
about 5,000 people.
   Volunteers will serve 350 turkeys, 330 pounds of stuffing, 15
cases of cranberry sauce, 24 cases of canned sweet potatoes, 25
cases of peas and 300 pumpkin pies, said Red Cross spokeswoman
Barbara Lohman in Charleston.
   The NAACP donated the turkey, the Red Cross bought the
trimmings, and church workers and community volunteers will do the
cooking.
   While this isn't the first time the Red Cross has sponsored a
holiday dinner, ``it seemed particularly appropriate this year,''
Ms. Lohman said.
   Hugo swept ashore in South Carolina on Sept. 21, killing 29 and
causing an estimated $4 billion in damage. In the hardest-hit
areas, the rebuilding process is slow, making the holiday season
even rougher.
   Isle of Palms Mayor Carmen Bunch contended federal help has been
slow ``and with the holidays coming on, it will be lonely for a lot
of people.''
   The island near Charleston, where nearly every house was
destroyed or damaged by Hugo's 135 mph winds, will host a
Thanksgiving dinner for about three dozen residents, police
officers and firefighters.
   ``I think (people) are still very unhappy. A lot of them are in
a state of shock. There's despair. But I think they will overcome
it,'' the mayor said.
   In Charleston, several churches planned to deliver turkeys and
hams to hurricane victims, as well as hold dinners.
   ``We got a lot to be thankful for, and this is the time to give
thanks for that,'' said City Councilman Robert Ford, who represents
many of the city's poorer areas. ``Everything we lost in Charleston
was mostly material anyway.
   ``People should be grateful for the fact that they have their
lives and health and well-being.''
   Even volunteers will get the chance to sit down for a holiday
feast.
   The Mennonites, who have been in South Carolina repairing
storm-damaged homes, will serve dinner to eight Red Cross
volunteers who were going to help them with building repairs on
Thursday. Afterward, all will eat dinner together in Moncks Corner,
north of Charleston.
   ``Somebody is giving care to the care-givers, as well,'' Ms.
Lohman said.
   But the storm still has cast an unforgettable shadow across the
lives of thousands _ even those who did not lose their homes and
belongings.
   ``I'm glad the holidays are here. It takes my mind off the
broken house and insurance people,'' Kathy Troughton of Mount
Pleasant said.
   ``People are really more thankful, or they're trying to put it
all behind them and really celebrate,'' she said. ``After what
we've been through, it's time to celebrate, instead of taking it
for granted like we normally do.''
   Robert Green lost his home on Johns Island south of Charleston.
   ``I'm thankful because my family made it through,'' Green said.
``We lost things, but our lives were spared and we'll get into
another place. It's not the same, but it's not too bad, either.''

<TEXT>
   A group of U.S. Army Green
Berets escaped from a luxury hotel in San Salvador this morning
after leftist guerrillas abandoned their 28-hour siege of the
building and fled.
   The soldiers sprinted from a five-story hotel annex when
Salvadoran security forces outside assured them the rebels were no
longer in the area.
   The Green Berets ran crouched, carrying M-16s with grenades on
their belts to waiting police pickup trucks that sped off with them.
   Reports in El Salvador varied on the number of soldiers had been
trapped overnight in the building, but a U.S. official in
Washington said there were 12.
   President Bush said today that a unit of U.S. Army's elite Delta
Force commandos was sent to El Salvador and ``liberated'' the hotel
from rebels without a shot. But it appeared the rebels had left the
hotel before the U.S. special operations force arrived.
   The 12 soldiers inside the hotel, normally stationed with the
7th Special Forces Group in Fort Bragg, N.C., had been in the
country at the end of a two-week training mission, said a Bush
administration official. They were scheduled to return to the
United States Tuesday, when the hotel was beseiged by the rebels,
the official said on condition of anonymity.
   Most of the from 15 to 20 leftist guerrillas in the hotel
apparently slipped away during the night, the Green Berets said.
   ``We watched them and could have shot them if we wanted to, but
that's not our job,'' said one of the Green Berets.
   The raid on the hotel by the guerrillas Tuesday was their latest
action in an offensive against government troops that began Nov.
11. At least 1,000 people have been killed in the offensive, the
biggest in the rebels' decade-old war against a succession of
U.S.-backed governments.
   The Green Berets had been holed up near a stairwell on the
fourth floor of the five-story ``VIP Tower'' while government
troops conducted a house-to-house search in the wealthy San
Salvador neighborhood of Escalon.
   Three bodies were lying in one street, dozens of telephone poles
were toppled and thousands of bullet holes were in the hotel. Rifle
shots rang out in the area until just 30 minutes before the Green
Berets left the hotel.
   Reporters who went through the third and fifth floors of the
hotel where the rebels were on Tuesday found none this morning. The
hotel is known as the El Salvador Sheraton, although it is no
longer part of the U.S.-based hotel chain.
   Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front guerrillas had seized
the hotel annex Tuesday, trapping the Americans, civilian guests
and the secretary-general of the Organization of American States,
who was on a peace mission.
   Salvadoran soldiers surrounded the building, and OAS chief Joao
Baena Soares and the civilians were evacuated later Tuesday.
   Col. Carlos Avilas, a Salvadoran military spokesman, claimed
Baena Soares, who returned to Washington late Tuesday, was the
target and said two of the diplomat's Salvadoran bodyguards had
been killed.
   But it was not clear if the rebels had intended to seize the
annex.
   The group of fighters was not large enough to seize the
sprawling hotel complex, and the rebels denied trying to kidnap the
OAS chief. One of the trapped U.S. soldiers said the guerrillas
appeared surprised and confused when they entered the annex.
   The attack on the western neighborhood turned the area into a
battle zone and stunned a war-weary city that had just begun to
return to a semblance of normality.
   The attack provoked a strong reaction from President Bush, who
hinted that U.S. military force might be used to assist the trapped
Americans. The United States also has said it would expedite
military aid to the Salvadorans, and a large U.S. military cargo
jet was seen landing at the international airport at 5 p.m. Tuesday.
   The men were not part of the group of 55 advisers stationed in
El Salvador, a number set by congressional limitation. The
congressional stricture allows, however, for the transitional type
of training teams that the men were part of, the U.S. official in
Washington said.
   The United States also has provided $3.5 billion in aid to El
Salvador during the 10-year-old guerrilla insurgency, which has
claimed the lives of more than 71,000 people, mostly civilians.

<TEXT>
   The son of President Nicolae Ceausescu
on Wednesday lauded the iron-willed leader who has defied the
reforms sweeping the East bloc, and he urged a Communist Party
Congress to re-elect his father, ``the brilliant genius of the
nation.''
   Nicu Ceausescu, himself a senior Communist official, led an
orchestrated joyful demonstration from the more than 3,000
delegates at the 14th party Congress as he extolled the virtues of
his father.
   The elder Ceausescu, 71, stared stolidly from a stage holding
top party functionaries.
   ``Ceausescu, CPR!'' the crowd thundered, using the abbreviation
for the Romanian Communist Party and clapping in unison until
silenced by a wave of the hand from the ``conducator,'' or leader.
   The conference's staged shows of affection, unmatched anywhere
in the East bloc since the Stalinist era, have been the most
visible sign of the hold Ceausescu has on the meeting. His keynote
speech Monday rejecting reforms was met by the same tumultuous but
clearly staged shows of affection and respect.
   ``The brilliant genius of the nation should be re-elected as
general secretary,'' declared the younger Ceausescu, a non-voting
member of the 39-member Politburo.
   He extolled his father's opening speech as ``a brilliant
analysis of the shining path carved by our nation'' since 1965,
when Ceausescu took power.
   Picking up a theme sounded by his father, the younger Ceausescu
criticized reform-minded Warsaw Pact allies moving toward
multiparty democracy, declaring that ``our policies have never been
dictated by opportunistic considerations.''
   Voting on party leadership is slated for Friday, with Ceausescu
the sole candidate for the post of secretary general. He is
expected to win.
   Views first expressed by the president Monday also were
reflected in a speech Tuesday by his wife, Elena, a full member of
the Politburo and the second-most powerful figure in the tightly
ruled country.
   Mrs. Ceausescu said the ninth party congress that installed her
husband ``put an end to the practice of the mechanical copying of
the socialist model and ... of accepting everything foreign,'' the
party daily Scinteia reported.
   The theme of independence has been sounded stridently in recent
months, apparently to justify Romania's decision to remain true to
its rigid controls in all sectors despite democratization elsewhere
in the Soviet bloc.
   In a possible allusion to Moldavia, the neighboring Soviet
republic where ethnic Romanians have been agitating for more
national identity, Mrs. Ceausescu urged Romanians to return to the
``orthography of the Latin alphabet.''
   Residents of Moldavia, known as Bessarabia until the Soviets
took it over, were granted the right by Moscow this summer to use
the Latin alphabet, instead of the Cyrillic alphabet.
   Ceausescu indirectly appeared to urge the return of Bessarabia
on Monday, calling for the abrogration of the Hitler-Stalin pact of
1938 that carved up parts of Europe, ceding Moldavia to the Soviets.
   Romanian officials and Western diplomats, speaking on condition
of anonymity, suggested the statement was primarily a political
assertion of independence, instead of a true call for a return to
pre-war borders.
   These comments were sure to worsen bilateral relations already
strained by Romania's rejection of reforms at a time of fundamental
change in the Soviet Union and in other allied countries.
   The strain was reflected in a Scinteia account of the meeting
between Ceausescu and Soviet Politburo member Vitaly Vorotnikov,
the head of the Soviet delegation to the Congress.
   ``The presence of the Soviet delegation ... emphasized the good
relations between the two parties,'' said the report, indirectly
suggesting that Soviet attendance had not been taken for granted.
   Several nations' Communist Parties, mostly from the West but
also from reform-minded Hungary, did not send delegations to show
their disagreement with Romania.
   China, which quashed a pro-democracy movement in June, was
graciously welcomed. Ceausescu extended ``a warm, friendly salute''
to Politburo member Qiao Shi, the delegation leader, and both sides
expressed ``satisfaction over ascending contact'' between the two
parties, Scinteia said.
   The domestic situation is aggravated by recurring shortages of
food and energy that leave shelves sparsely stacked, houses chilly
and cars idle.
   Western diplomats say there is too much fear of Ceausescu for
any opposition to form.
   Mrs. Ceausescu served notice of the intent to continue
suppression of all opposition, saying: ``We are prepared to firmly
reject all actions of imperialist and reactionary circles to
destabliize and undermine socialism.''

   President Bush, warming up for a
prime-time address on the political upheaval in Eastern Europe,
today gave a Thanksgiving-eve salute to Memphis citizens involved
in public service and volunteer efforts.
   ``We are nearing the dawn of a new decade,'' he said. ``Let it
be a decade with no dark corners, no forgotten people, no forgotten
places.''
   The president delivered his speech outdoors in a cold driving
rain before an audience of hundreds of people standing in several
inches of mud.
   He stood before the crowd without an umbrella and the rain
plastered his hair across his forehead. ``I hope you haven't gotten
pneumonia,'' he said in closing.
   Encouraging Americans to reach out to help others, Bush said,
``Everyone has a gift to give. Everyone of us has a special talent
that can help solve America's problems. And every institution in
America can make the kind of commitment you've made here.''
   After a two-hour stop in Memphis, Bush was to fly back to
Washington for a helicopter hop to Camp David, the presidential
retreat in Maryland's Catoctin Mountains, where he will spend the
holiday.
   The president scheduled a 9 p.m. EST, televised speech from Camp
David about the dramatic opening of the Berlin Wall, democratic
reforms in Eastern Europe and his summit next week with Soviet
President Mikhail S. Gorbachev.
   White House Press Secretary Marlin Fitzwater said the events in
Eastern Europe ``tend to lend themselves'' to ``presidential
analysis and reassurance to the nation of the course that the
United States is taking.
   ``Secondly, it's far enough past the diminishing of the Berlin
Wall so that we can reflect on that with some ability to put events
in perspective,'' he said.
   Bush has a good prop for the speech if he wants it. On Tuesday,
West German Foreign Minister Hans-Dietrich Genscher gave him a slab
of concrete from the Berlin Wall.
   Today's trip was linked to a series of articles published by the
Memphis Commercial Appeal about people whose volunteer efforts help
improve the lives of others.
   The newspaper calls the series ``A Thousand Points of Light,''
borrowing the president's own phrase about volunteer and public
service efforts.
   In his speech, Bush singled out some of the individuals who have
been featured by the newspapers, from a teen-ager involved in
helping rebuild houses to an 82-year-old woman who teaches reading
to illiterate prisoners.
   ``They are great American success stories, and they're powerful
reminders that everyone can do something for someone else,'' the
president said.
   Bush also honored the newspaper, saluting it as the first in a
series of individuals and organizations recognized by the White
House as ``Daily Points of Light.''
   Challenging others to follow the newspaper's example, Bush
called on ``every publisher, every broadcaster, ever member of the
American news media to follow the lead of the Commercial Appeal.
Many have begun to do so.
   ``All three of the major networks have started regular features
on volunteers in America _ and local papers and stations have
become involved. Many more can,'' he said.
   Bush also stopped at St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, one
of the nation's top research facilities for catastrophic diseases
in children. He was greeted by the facility's founder, entertainer
Danny Thomas, and then met with several young cancer patients,
including a child from the Soviet city of Leningrad.
   Among the hospital's specialties is research into leukemia, the
disease that claimed the life of one of Bush's own children, Robin,
who died in 1953, two months shy of her fourth birthday.
   When Bush arrived in Memphis, he stopped at Memphis Baptist
Medical Center to see Roy Lee ``Chucky'' Mullins, football player
for the University of Mississippi who suffered an injury in an Oct.
28 game that left him paralyzed from the neck down.
   The plight of Mullins, 20, a defensive back from Russellville,
Ala., has sparked attention across the country, and the White House
said $405,000 has been collected to set up a trust for him.
   Bush and his wife, Barbara, in a letter to Mullins, lauded his
``strength to meet this adversity.'' Mullins was born in poverty
and won a scholarship to the school.

   Only a few of the 20 young workers
waiting at the tram stop in front of Prague's largest industrial
complex wore the tricolor ribbons showing they were in sympathy
with pro-democracy protesters.
   But five answered ``yes'' in unison when asked whether they
supported the demonstrators, who have rallied throughout
Czechoslovakia for a sixth day.
   None of the other workers disagreed.
   ``Yes, the students have our full backing,'' said Radek, a
20-year-old worker at a compressor plant of the CKD complex in the
suburb of Vysocany. ``We too want free elections. We want a better
life.''
   ``We are on our way again to Wenceslas Square,'' said a nearby
worker.
   ``We have never missed a demo,'' added another. He said they
were there Friday when police brutally cracked down on a peaceful
rally. ``But we ran away in time,'' he said.
   The giant plant at Vysocany made history in 1968 shortly after
Soviet tanks moved into the center of Prague. In the last attempt
to save the ``Prague Spring'' reforms, a hastily convened Communist
Party congress at the plant called for the immediate withdrawal of
the Soviet-led invasion force. But the resolution was later
declared illegal by the hard-line government.
   The driver of a passing car honked his horn in sympathy as he
passed the young workers, and a small group of middle-aged
machine-tool operators on the other side of the street held up a
banner proclaiming ``CKD is with you.''
   ``Ninety percent of the workers are passive supporters of the
pro-democracy movement and 40 percent are active backers,'' said
Radek.
   Members of the group said there were continuing rumors the
Communist Party's paramilitary militia was preparing a crackdown.
   ``They are on alert since 10 p.m. last night at CKD,'' one
worker said. They are on guard at every gate. You'd better not go
in there.''
   At another CKD semiconductor plant in suburban Polovodice,
employees who insisted on anonymity confirmed reports by dissidents
that a meeting there had voted 1,407-2 Monday to adopt a resolution
endorsing the demands of the Civic Forum opposition groups.
   ``Under the leadership of our party, we fulfill the decisions of
the 17th Congress,'' proclaimed a sign hung high on the walls of
the complex. It had apparently been there for years.
   But a makeshift poster pasted to the entrance gate said ``We
support the general strike,'' called for two hours on Nov. 27.
Mimeographed typewritten pages with statements from the opposition
groups were also stuck to the gate with adhesive tape.
   ``Militia people were here during the night and removed them,''
said a bystander. ``But now they are on again.''
   A woman in a glass booth controlling visitors to the plant
replied angrily when asked about the notices.
   ``They are putting them on. They are taking them off. What do I
care?'' she said.
   The demonstration, meanwhile, had begun at Wenceslas Square, and
Czechoslovak TV for the first time showed live excerpts. The
program interviewed a worker, who said footage shown on Austrian TV
of Friday's police crackdown cast doubt on a party newspaper report
that it was the students who attacked police.
   ``What is the government afraid of?'' the worker asked. ``Is it
because they have been lying to us for the past 20 years?''

   In the past six months, Margaret Thatcher has
suffered an election upset, lost her treasury chief in a policy
dispute, tumbled in the opinion polls and stirred dissension in the
ranks of her Conservative Party.
   Now a colleague says he will probably challenge her for her job,
and a prime minister who until recently looked unassailable is
suddenly looking embattled.
   Mrs. Thatcher has never before been opposed in the annual
election of the party leader, and her challenger, lawmaker Sir
Anthony Meyer, concedes he is a complete outsider with no chance of
winning.
   Instead, he told BBC radio Wednesday, he hopes to provoke enough
abstentions to send Mrs. Thatcher a message ``that support for the
prime minister is slipping.''
   Meyer said he would mount his challenge unless ``somebody much
better qualified'' came forward, an apparent invitation to more
likely successors, such as former Defense Secretary Michael
Heseltine, to join the race.
   The election by the 374 Conservative members of Parliament must
be held before Dec. 19, and a complex procedure requires Mrs.
Thatcher to get a majority of 57 percent to win outright.
   If she fails, a second round is held, in which other candidates
may enter.
   Nobody imagines Mrs. Thatcher losing on the first round. But a
large number of abstentions and no-votes would prove a crippling
blow. The Independent newspaper said last week it had polled every
Tory lawmaker and found that 217 would back her, 86 would oppose
her, and 71 were undecided or wouldn't say. The paper said that if
more than 100 voted against her, she would be in serious trouble.
   Mrs. Thatcher's problems seemed to begin in June, when a
thrashing in elections to the European Parliament suggested her
combative attitude toward integration into the European Economic
Community was out of step with the voters.
   Inflation, meanwhile, had risen above 8 percent. Interest rates
headed to an eight-year high of 15 percent. The trade deficit was
running at record levels and the Tories were as much as 11 points
behind the opposition Labor Party in the polls.
   Also, her widely unpopular reform of property taxes was
confronting homeowners with higher bills, and there were
indications that Mrs. Thatcher herself was beginning to listen to
those who counseled a kinder, more caring approach.
   But last month came a stunning setback when Chancellor of the
Exchequer Nigel Lawson resigned in a quarrel with Mrs. Thatcher
over how to rescue the economy.
   His successor, John Major, has warned the public to expect a
bleak 1990.
   Reelected for her third consecutive term in June 1987, Mrs.
Thatcher doesn't have to call an election until mid-1992, and her
supporters say her problems are not unusual for a government in
midterm.
   But Meyer said there was ``a much more profound discontent''
with the Tories, and that Mrs. Thatcher was ``out of sympathy with
what people's deeper instincts are.''
   ``The trouble is, I don't think she is capable of changing
either her attitudes or her policies,'' he said on London
Broadcasting Co. radio.
   ``Every time there's a great dustup with her ministers and it's
said that from now on she's going to listen, she doesn't actually
listen. She's so convinced that she's right that she doesn't
listen.''
   Meyer is one of those Tories who believe the issue is Europe and
Britain's place in it. They believe the public does not share Mrs.
Thatcher's fear of a European ``superstate'' unraveling her
anti-socialist program. They believe the public, unlike Mrs.
Thatcher, sees nothing wrong with Britain adopting the welfare and
working standards of the Continent.
   Mrs. Thatcher has always thrived on confrontation, and she
looked her usual fighting self in Parliament on Tuesday during the
first debate to be televised live from the House of Commons.
   Her 1990 legislative program was full of the hallmarks of
Thatcherite free enterprise: new curbs on union power and more
deregulation of national industries and services.
   But in the influential Financial Times, an editorial Tuesday
already was looking forward to the post-Thatcher era, arguing that
she has accomplished all she can in reviving Britain's fortunes and
has no more peaks to climb.
   ``A political race deprived of her commanding presence can now
be envisaged,'' it said. ``The question for the UK is whether the
country builds on the achievements of Thatcherism, while remedying
its defects, or sees them demolished, instead.''

   A judge ordered the man accused of
killing Black Panther Party co-founder Huey P. Newton to stand
trial for murder after refusing to hear testimony supporting a
claim of self-defense.
   Muncipal Court Judge George Nelson ruled Tuesday at a
preliminary hearing for Tyrone D. Robinson, who did not testify.
   Prosecutor Teresa Drabec argued successfully that the testimony
of defense witnesses was inadmissible hearsay because none of them
actually saw the confrontation between Newton and Robinson that the
defense says led to the Aug. 22 curbside killing.
   Nelson did allow testimony by prosecution witness Brian Walton,
who identified Robinson as having shot an unarmed Newton three
times.
   Robinson's lawyer, Al Wagner, said he planned to produce at
least two witnesses who would testify they saw Newton armed and
high on cocaine, and that he had threatened to ``blow someone
away.'' Wagner said he planned to appeal the judge's ruling.
   Robinson says he shot in self-defense because Newton was armed
and demanded cocaine.
   The prosecution portrayed Robinson as having killed Newton to
advance his standing with the Black Guerrilla Family, a gang whose
narcotics dealers Newton robbed.

   A man who claims his family was given most
of the northern United States by the king of England during
colonial times has sued to get it back.
   Robert Brewster, of Longmont, Colo., said in his U.S. District
Court lawsuit, filed in Cheyenne, that he wants the land to set up
his own country for blue- and green-eyed people.
   Brewster claimed his family was given the land between the 40th
and 48th north latitudes from ocean to ocean. The 48th parallel is
approximately at the Canadian border and the 40th parallel
stretches approximately from Eureka, Calif., across the United
States to New York City.
   ``It is now necessary for the Brewsters to reclaim their land
before the federal government loses its ability to return the
land,'' the lawsuit said. ``The USA has lost its vision and is
collapsing every day with newspapers reporting each morning of
massive land purchases by Japan or OPEC.''
   The lawsuit filed Monday said Brewster is a descendant of
William Brewster, a founder of the Plymouth Colony in 1620 in what
is now Massachusetts.
   The lawsuit said William Brewster and his companions were given
the land by the King of England when they left that country to move
to the ``New World.''
   Brewster said he wants the land back so he can ``form an area
where only green-eyed and blue-eyed persons will be permitted.''
People with green and blue eyes are superior to those with brown
eyes, Brewster said, but will soon be extinct unless they are
protected.
   Brewster also asked the court for permission to establish a
standing army to protect the borders of his country.
   The United States, as represented by the U.S. Attorney's office
in Cheyenne, has 30 days to respond to Brewster's lawsuit,
according to a woman in the U.S. District Court clerk's office. She
said Wednesday that the case has been assigned to Judge Alan B.
Johnson, but no hearing date has been set.

   A fire in a historic neighborhood of
cobblestone streets and Old World-style homes killed a woman and
five children early today, authorities said.
   At least seven people, including four firefighters, were
reported injured in the blaze, which destroyed a two-family house
and damaged two neighboring houses in the city's German Village
section.
   ``My wife heard something that woke her up. I looked outside. It
was terror,'' said George Dorn, 87, who lives across the street.
``Flames were coming out all the windows, all the doors,
everything.''
   Firefighters using a crane to lift debris pulled the bodies of
three children and a woman from the ruins of the home where the
fire started, authorities said.
   Another child was found dead in the other half of the two-family
home, and the body of a girl age 1 to 3 was pulled from a
neighboring house, firefighters said.
   The identities and relationships of the dead were not
immediately released.
   But John F. Donahue said his daughter, Brenda Paas, her husband,
David, and their three children, ages 2, 3 and 5, lived in the half
of the two-family home where the fire began. Paas escaped without
injury.
   ``The fire started in the couch, and I tried to get it out but
got stuck in the door,'' Paas said. ``The electricity was out and
the smoke was so thick I couldn't get back in.''
   Donahue said his daughter told him Tuesday that she suspected
trouble with the gas line under the house because her oven would
not work. Firefighters refused to speculate on the cause of the
fire, reported at 12:35 a.m.
   The fire broke out in a section settled by German immigrants in
the 19th century. The neighborhood of tidy brick homes and narrow
streets and alleys was once a rundown part of town but was
revitalized and restored in the past 25 years.
   The four firefighters were in fair condition, said Doug Brandt,
a spokesman for Ohio State University Hospitals.
   At least three residents were taken to hospitals with burns and
smoke inhalation.
   Michelle Madoski, 17, was listed in serious condition, Brandt
said. Noah Bragg, 28, was in intensive care at St. Anthony Mercy
Hospital, and his wife, Dawn, 21, was in fair condition, said
hospital spokeswoman Marlene Broseman.

   Sam the cat turned up at Roma Greene's
house in time for Thanksgiving ... three years after he disappeared.
   ``This has really made my holiday,'' said Mrs. Greene, of
Loudendale, just outside Charleston. ``He loves me better than
anything. I can't wait for the children to come home for
Thanksgiving.''
   Sam left the house the week before Thanksgiving 1986.
   ``It was a cold, blizzardy night,'' Mrs. Greene said. ``But he
always went outside to use the bathroom and then curled up in his
chair beside the fire. I said, `Sam, you'd better hurry up. You'll
freeze out there tonight.'''
   But Sam disappeared. ``I cried for a week. It was the worst
Thanksgiving I ever had,'' Mrs. Greene said. ``For a year,
everywhere I'd go, I'd ask if anyone had seen him.''
   Last Wednesday, Mrs. Green opened her bedroom blinds and saw the
cat curled up in a chair on the porch.
   ``I opened the door and said, `Sam, Sam,''' she said. ``He said,
`Meow, meow.' I said, `Sam, I do wish you could tell me where
you've been for the last three years.'''
   From his disheveled condition, worn feet and thinness, Mrs.
Greene believes he must have traveled a long distance.
   ``He hasn't stopped eating since he got back,'' she said. ``I'll
never get him full.''

   Most people have to go after their
Thanksgiving turkey, whether by shopping or hunting, but three of
the birds came to Sandy Ham.
   ``Animal Control caught two and the third jumped over the
fence,'' Ham said of the stray turkeys that wound up in her
fenced-in backyard Monday.
   Ham's neighbor, Kim Fischer, saw the three black gobblers as she
was leaving her house. Concerned about the birds' safety with two
major streets nearby, she and her son Paul helped Ham herd the
birds into Ham's backyard, where neighborhood children tried to get
the birds to pose with them, Ham said.
   ``They clucked around the yard from noon to about three ... They
chirped and gobbled and had a great time,'' she said of the birds.
   ``Somebody asked me: Are you going to keep them? I said I have
four children; I don't need three turkeys,'' she said.
   Ken Johnson, chief of wildlife for the Nebraska Game and Parks
Commission, said he did not know of any wild turkeys being released
in the area and guessed the birds could have been raised by someone
in the area.
   Two of the turkeys were released at Wilderness Park.
   The third showed up Tuesday at the Mid-America Headquarters of
the Seventh-day Adventist Church.
   ``Wouldn't you know it, he came to a place where most of us are
vegetarians. He knew where to come,'' said Sharon Klein, a
secretary there.

   Lebanon's political history has been
plauged by violence and turmoil.
   Since independence from France in 1943, Lebanon's nine
presidents have grappled with sectarian fighting, coup attempts and
invasion by foreign forces.
   The latest victim was Rene Mouawad, who was elected president by
an emergency session of Parliament Nov. 5 in Syrian-controlled
north Lebanon and served only 17 days before his assassination
Wednesday.
   The first president was Bishara Khoury, who was released from
his cell in a French prison when Parliament elected him Sept. 21,
1943. The French-educated trial lawyer headed the Christian-Moslem
National Resistance against the French, who ruled Lebanon under a
League of Nations mandate from 1920 to 1943.
   In 1950, forces loyal to Khoury and his Sunni Moslem prime
minister, Riyad Solh, suppressed a two-week revolt by the Syrian
Social Nationalist Party aimed at making Lebanon part of a
``greater Syria.'' Syrian nationalist leader Antoine Saadeh was
executed.
   A year later, Solh was assassinated on a visit to Jordan.
   In 1952, Khoury resigned after protest demonstrations broke out
when he sought to amend the constitution to extend his term.
   Parliament elected Camille Chamoun, a former U.N. ambassador and
a Maronite Catholic chieftain who survived four assassination
attempts to complete his six-year term.
   Chamoun asked for American help in 1958 when he faced a Moslem
revolt inspired by Egyptian leader Gamal Abdel Nasser's radical
pan-Arabism. President Dwight D. Eisenhower sent 10,000 U.S.
Marines to Beirut in July 1958 and the rebellion fizzled.
   Chamoun's successor, army Gen. Fuad Chehab, crushed a coup
attempt on New Year's Eve by pro-Syrian army officers in 1959.
   Lawyer Charles Helou, elected in 1964, ruled as Yasser Arafat's
Palestinian guerrillas built up their power base in Lebanon. In
1969, the Lebanese army clashed with Arafat's fighters in street
battles in south Beirut.
   Helou's successor, pro-Syrian Maronite Suleiman Franjieh,
oversaw the clashes between Christians and Palestinians that
triggered the civil war in April 1975. More than 150,000 people
have died since then.
   Parliament came under shellfire when Elias Sarkis, a former
Central Bank governor, was elected in 1976 with strong Syrian
backing. During his term the Israelis invaded in 1978 and 1982.
   Bashir Gemayel, the Israeli-backed commander of the Christians'
main militia was elected to replace him. Gemayel, 34, was
assassinated in an east Beirut bombing Sept. 14, 1982, a week
before he was to be sworn in.
   Parliament unanimously elected his elder brother, Amin. His
reign saw the advent of Iranian-sponsored Shiite terrorism,
including the kidnapping of Westerners and the suicide bombings of
U.S. and French military bases.
   Gemayel stepped down Sept. 22, 1988, with Parliament unable to
elect a successor. He left Lebanon in shambles and now lives in
France.

   Actor Martin Sheen was among 66 demonstrators arrested for
blocking Los Angeles' federal building today during a third day of
large-scale protests around the country against U.S. support for
the government of El Salvador.
   About 200 people took part in the demonstration, during which
nine protesters lay down at the building's entrance and were
covered with sheets splattered with red paint.
   ``I cannot not be here. It's an action that says no more
military wars, no more recognition of the illegal government of El
Salvador which kills its people,'' Sheen said.
   On Tuesday, demonstrators blockaded government buildings in San
Francisco and Washington state. A policeman was knocked unconscious
and bloodied with a two-by-four in Minneapolis, and some activists
called for a boycott of Salvadoran coffee.
   Tuesday's demonstrations brought more than 200 arrests.
   The protests coincided with heavy fighting in San Salvador,
including the takeover by leftist rebels of a luxury hotel. The
takeover trapped U.S. soldiers.
   The demonstrators' anger focused on last week's killings of six
Jesuit priests, slayings the protesters blame on rightists allied
with the Salvadoran military.
   U.S. citizens ``do not want their dollars spent on torture and
murder,'' said San Francisco Mayor Art Agnos in a statement
coinciding with one protest. ``We aren't in the business of buying
bullets to murder priests or anyone else.''
   President Bush on Monday reaffirmed U.S. support for Salvadoran
President Alfredo Cristiani's rightist government. The United
States has provided about $3.5 billion to oppose the insurgency, in
which more than 71,000 people, mostly civilians, have died.
Fifty-five U.S. military advisers are assigned to El Salvador.
   ``I believe that the United States has parallels to Germany in
the 30's right now and that our money is funding atrocities,'' said
Eliza Reid protester in Olympia, Wash.
   In Minneapolis, Officer Lyle Beauchamp was hit in the face with
a board and knocked unconscious. He required stitches. The board
came out of a crowd while police were arresting protesters for
spray-painting buildings, authorities said.
   Seventeen demonstrators were arrested.
   An estimated 400 people blocked entrances to the San Francisco
Federal Building, and 141 were arrested in the three-hour protest.
Some of the demonstrators later briefly blocked traffic in front of
the Salvadoran consulate.
   Some of the building's 6,000 workers, as well as people headed
for court, struggled through the protesters to get into the
20-story building.
   Most of those arrested were cited for disturbing the peace. A
similar protest Monday ended with 136 arrests.
   In Olympia, about 200 protesters briefly blocked a street and 29
people were arrested for blocking the entrance to the Federal
Building. They were cited for trespassing.
   In Bellingham, Wash., near Seattle, about 150 protesters
carrying a huge banner moved from the Federal Building into an
intersection where police cars, motorcycles and a logging truck
blocked their way.
   Twenty-three people were arrested for disorderly conduct after
they sat down in the street.
   A group represented by actor Ed Asner was one of several calling
for a boycott of coffee from El Salvador, a $200 million-a-year
cash crop that represents 21 percent of that country's gross
national product and 5 percent of U.S. coffee imports.

   Congress and President Bush have agreed on a
potpourri of minor tax increases as part of a deficit-reduction
plan, but don't expect them to crow about it.
   Neither the president nor lawmakers seem to relish being
associated with higher taxes, even when few voters are affected.
Bush spent a good part of his campaign last year promising no new
taxes, and Congress this year appeared happy to go along.
   ``Well, I guess nobody has indicated that these are new taxes,''
said Sen. James Sasser, D-Tenn., suggesting it's all in the eye of
the beholder.
   The critical point about calling a tax a tax is ``do average
people think they are new taxes?'' added Sen. Pete Domenici, R-N.M.
   Few of the tax provisions in the $14.7 billion deficit-reduction
plan approved Wednesday morning, with Bush's support, will be
noticed by ``average people.''
   The measure raises taxes by $8 billion this budget year but
includes $2 billion of selective tax cuts, leaving a net $6 billion
tax increase. Also included are about $4.5 billion of targeted
spending reductions in an array of federal programs.
   Here are some provisions of the bill and how they would affect
the deficit this budget year:
   
</TEXT>
<NOTE>REVENUE INCREASES</NOTE>
<TEXT>
   
   SOCIAL SECURITY TAXES: Include deferred compensation, such as
earnings set aside in a 401(k) retirement account, in the formula
used to calculate the total amount of wages in the economy that are
subject to Social Security tax. That would mean a slightly
greater-than-usual increase each year in the maximum amount of
earnings subject to Social Security taxes; this ``wage base'' is
$48,000 this year and will be $50,000 next year. Revenue: $400
million.
   AIR SERVICE: Delay until Jan. 1, 1991, scheduled reductions in
the 8 percent tax on airline tickets and the 5 percent tax on air
freight. Double to $6 per passenger the tax on international
tickets. Revenue: $895 million.
   CRUISE SHIPS: Impose a $3-per-passenger tax on international
overnight cruise ships and on gambling ships in international
waters. Revenue: $4 million.
   OIL TAXES: Impose a 5-cent-a-barrel tax on domestic crude oil
and imported oil and oil products to help clean up spills. Revenue:
$106 million. An additional 3-cent tax would apply to Outer
Continental Shelf oil for pollution control. Revenue: $9 million.
   CHEMICALS: Impose a gradually increasing tax on sale or use of
certain chemicals deemed to deplete the earth's ozone layer.
Revenue: $489 million.
   WITHHOLDING: Require withholding of income taxes from wages of
farm workers who already have Social Security taxes withheld.
Revenue: $270 million.
   BANKS: Repeal tax break for interest earned on loans to permit
workers to buy stock in an employer's company through Employee
Stock Ownership Plans, unless the ESOP owns a majority of the
company's stock. Revenue: $1 billion.
   TAKEOVERS: Prohibit corporations from carrying back losses _ and
thus getting refunds of past taxes _ generated by borrowing to
finance a takeover of another company. Revenue: $226 million.
   ACCOUNTING: Repeal the completed-contract accounting method,
which has allowed large builders and defense contractors to defer
taxes. Revenue: $109 million.
   PAYROLL SPEEDUP: Require large employers to turn over to the
treasury more quickly the Social Security and income taxes they
withhold from workers' pay checks and the matching Social Security
taxes they pay. Present law permits employers to hold on to
withheld taxes _ and use them as they wish _ for limited periods.
Starting next Aug. 1, they would have to hand over the taxes the
business day after any day on which collections totaled $100,000 or
more. Revenue: $2.45 billion.
   EXCHANGES: Restrict the ability of certain investors to avoid
taxes on gains when business or investment property is exchanged
for property of a like kind. Revenue: $100 million.
   BONDS: Reduce tax benefits for high-risk ``junk'' bonds sold at
deep discount. Revenue: $21 million.
</TEXT>
<NOTE>TAX CUTS</NOTE>
<TEXT>
   
   CORPORATE MINIMUM TAX: Simplify paperwork associated with the
corporate minimum tax, which is designed to assure that profitable
companies pay some tax even though large deductions would otherwise
wipe out any tax liability. Revenue: $416 million.
   PENALTIES: Revise the 150 tax penalties in federal law to
simplify them and prevent duplicate penalties for the same offense.
No revenue effect in 1990.
   The compromise bill includes extension of several expiring tax
breaks through Sept. 30, 1990. Among them, and the cost of
extension:
   SELF-EMPLOYED: A deduction for 25 percent of the cost of health
insurance for self-employed people, their spouses and dependents.
Revenue loss: $183 million.
   EDUCATION: A tax exclusion for up to $5,250 a year tuition
assistance received by an employee from an employer. Revenue loss:
$418 million.
   MORTGAGE BONDS: A tax exemption for bonds used to help
lower-income families buy their first home. Revenue loss: $10
million.
   LOW-INCOME HOUSING: A credit that encourages investment in
building rental housing for the poor. Revenue loss: $69 million.
   RESEARCH: A credit for increased spending for research and
experimentation. In addition, a rule allowing corporations to
allocate up to 64 percent of their research costs against foreign

   LEGAL AID: An exclusion from the taxable income of workers for a
limited amount of employer-paid group legal assistance. Revenue
loss: $112 million.
   TARGETED JOBS CREDIT: A credit under which the government in
effects pays 40 percent of the first $4,000 of first-year wages of
poor or disabled workers. Revenue loss: $36 million.
   ENERGY CREDITS: Subsidies for business investment in solar,
geothermal and ocean-thermal property. Revenue loss: $50 million.

<TEXT>
   
   HEALTH: The deficit would be reduced by about $2.8 billion by
limiting Medicare and Medicaid reimbursements to doctors and
hospitals and by extending a requirement that the monthly Medicare
Part B premium cover 25 percent of program costs.
   In an effort to hold down medical costs and improve care in
rural and inner-city areas, the bill revises dramatically the
system under which the government reimburses physicians for
services to Medicare patients. It sets up a national fee schedule
based on the costs of providing services. The bill also limits
amounts doctors may charge Medicare patients above the Medicare
reimbursement level.
   The bill would expand child health coverage under Medicaid and
require that states cover pregnant women and children under age 6
whose incomes are up to 33 percent above the poverty level. Cost:
$150 million.
   SOCIAL SERVICES: Add $100 million to block grants to states for
various social service programs.
   AGRICULTURE: Reduce 1990 crop deficiency payments for corn,
other feed grains, wheat, upland cotton and rice by about 3
percent. Save $235 million. Limit spending for export enhancement
and targeted export assistance. Save $143 million.
   STUDENT LOANS: Tighten eligibility rules for supplemental loans
to save $35 million.
   INSURANCE: Reauthorize and extend national flood insurance and
crime insurance programs. Raise $190 million.
   FEDERAL RETIREES: Require that federal employees retiring in
1990 receive lump-sum benefits over two years, rather than one,
saving $700 million the first year and losing $750 million the
second.
   VA LOANS: Extend the 1 percent loan fee for VA loans and renew
authority of the Veterans Affairs Department to sell loans without
any guarantee that it would repurchase them in case of delinquency.
Raise $665 million.
   POSTAL SERVICE: Remove the service, which has its own deficit,
from the federal budget, resulting in a $1.77 billion cut in the
general deficit.

<HEAD>Durable Goods Orders Fall</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARTIN CRUTSINGER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Economics Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Manufacturing orders for ``big ticket''
durable goods fell in October for the fourth time in six months,
the government said Wednesday in a report economists termed further
evidence that U.S. industry is facing a sharp downturn in activity.
   The Commerce Department said orders for durable goods _ items
expected to last three or more years _ dipped 0.6 percent to a
seasonally adjusted $124.59 billion last month after a 1.1 percent
drop in September.
   Analysts, who had been looking for an October decline, were
suprised by the sharp downward revision in September, a month when
the government had earlier reported that orders posted a small 0.2
percent increase.
   The back-to-back monthly declines, coming on the heels of even
bigger decreases in July and May, were viewed as ominous for the
health of the manufacturing sector.
   ``The U.S. manufacturing sector is in a recession. Very few
industries are hiring and most are laying off employees,'' said
John Hagens, chief economist for the WEFA Group, an economic
forecasting company in Bala Cynwyd, Pa.
   The open question, economists said, was whether the sluggishness
in manufacturing would spill over into the rest of the economy and
spell an end to the economic recovery, which has already lasted a
peacetime record of seven years.
   Cynthia Latta, an economist with DRI-McGraw Hill, predicted that
economic growth would dip below an annual rate of 1 percent in the
final three months of this year and she said economic activity
would remain lackluster through the first half of 1990.
   ``We are not forecasting a recession but we are forecasting
miserable growth. It is so close to the edge that the economy could
slip into negative growth,'' she said.
   The last time the economy faced such an extended period of
weakness was in mid-1986 when U.S. manufacturers were battling
massive imports and weak foreign sales. However, manufacturing
rebounded in 1987 and 1988 as a declining dollar helped spur a boom
in export sales.
   Analysts said they were not looking for that to recur this time,
in part because overseas growth in many countries is slowing.
   ``There is very little on the horizon to revive manufacturing
over the next six to nine months,'' said Allen Sinai, chief
economist of the Boston Co.
   He said a slump in manufacturing, which accounts for 18 percent
of U.S. jobs, would not be enough by itself to trigger a recession.
But he said he was forecasting a mild slump next year because of a
belief that services industries will see weak sales as well.
   Much of the industrial slowdown so far has been in the auto
industry, where slumping sales have already prompted layoffs and
production cutbacks.
   For October, transportation orders rose by 3 percent to $33.54
billion, recouping some of a giant 10.8 percent drop in September.
But the strength was concentrated in increased demand for military
ships and civilian aircraft. Orders to automakers were down again.
   Military orders fell by 12.4 percent to $9.33 billion. However,
that followed a huge 33.9 percent military increase in September.
   Excluding the volatile defense category, orders would have risen
0.5 percent in October after posting a 3.5 percent decline in
September.
   Orders in the key category of non-defense capital goods rose 3.2
percent in October to $36.5 billion, but that was concentrated in
demand for civilian aircraft and did nothing to dispell concerns
that this sector will weaken as businesses, facing a profits
squeeze, cut back on expansion plans.
   Orders for the machinery category that includes computers
dropped 4.6 percent to $21.53 billion, while the non-computer
machinery category fell 3.8 percent to $20.16 billion.
   Shipments of durable goods fell 1.7 percent to $122.4 billion
after a 3 percent decline in September.

   President Bush said today that an American
special operations force ``liberated'' a hotel in El Salvador where
leftist rebels had trapped a dozen U.S. Army Green Berets, but an
administration official said later that the force never went into
action.
   It appeared the 12 soldiers had fled the hotel after the rebels
withdrew, and the White House issued a statement saying ``updated
information showed U.S. forces did not actually enter the hotel.
Entry proved to be unnecessary.''
   Bush, speaking to reporters aboard Air Force One, said the U.S.
team was joined by special operations forces from the Salvadoran
government. He said he consulted with Salvadoran President Alfredo
Cristiani about the action but that the decision to go forward was
his alone.
   ``They were our special operations ... that I sent down there,''
Bush said. ``When you see Americans held hostage like this, there's
a message in all this. This president, backed by our defense
secretary, will stand to protect the lives of Americans wherever we
can.''
   But in Washington, an administration official knowledgeable
about the early-morning operation said the U.S. special operations
forces never went into action.
   ``They were sent. They were in position. ... But as the
operation evolved, they never went into action,'' said the
official, who insisted on anonymity. ``The bad guys melted away and
the 12 came out.''
   The official said the elite commando units were sent to Salvador
``on a pure contingency basis. They could have been used, but there
wasn't a need for them.''
   Another adminstration official, who also demanded anonymity,
said the 12 Green Berets, normally stationed with the 7th Special
Forces Group at Fort Bragg, N.C., had been on a two-week training
mission in El Salvador. They were scheduled to return to the United
States on Tuesday, when the hotel was beseiged by the rebels, the
official said.
   ``That hotel was liberated with finality from the clutches of
this outrageous guerrilla attack,'' Bush told reporters while en
route to Memphis for a speech.
   He said the special force, a unit of the Army's elite Delta
Force commandos, swept the Sheraton Hotel for mines and that there
was no fighting. ``Thank God they didn't have to fire a shot,'' he
said.
   But presidential spokesman Marlin Fitzwater hours later issued a
statement that said ``updated information showed U.S. forces did
not actually enter the hotel. Their entry proved to be
unnecessary.''
   Reports from El Salvador indicated the rebels apparently left a
five-story hotel annex sometime before dawn. Bush said the U.S.
operation occurred early this morning.
   ``We must not stand by and fail to support a country that has
oved down democracy's path,'' the president said. ``It's our
responsibility.''
   Congress has limited the number of U.S. military advisers in El
Salvador to 55, but allowed for transitional training teams. The
trapped Green Berets fell into this area.
   The men were in El Salvador on a mission to evaluate U.S.
training programs for the Salvadoran government troops and to
engage in their own ``unilateral training,'' the U.S. official said.
   Earlier, Fitzwater hinted at possible U.S. military
intervention. He said the pre-dawn attack Tuesday against the hotel
showed the ``true colors'' of the guerrillas fighting to overthrow
the Salvadoran government.
   ``They are attacking defenseless citizens in a civilian hotel
and using the surrounding neighborhood of defenseless Salvadoran
citizens as a shield against the government forces,'' said
Fitzwater.
   He said top Pentagon, CIA, State Department and National
Security Council officials met twice in the White House on Tuesday
to monitor events. The panel, known as the deputies' committee, was
formed to improve coordination in the aftermath of the abortive
coup in Panama.
   The situation was being watched ``on through the night'' by
staff at both the State Department and National Security Council,
said Fitzwater.
   ``The United States stands committed to the people and the
government of El Salvador,'' he added.
   State Department spokeswoman Margaret Tutwiler said the
Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front rebels had revealed
themselves as ``terrorists, pure and simple.''
   An Associated Press reporter in El Salvador saw armed military
men, believed to include U.S. advisers, brandishing M-16 rifles and
barricaded on the fourth floor of the hotel.
   Guerrillas were believed to have been be on the third and fifth
floors.
   On Capitol Hill Tuesday, the Senate voted for a resolution
condemning continuing violence on all sides in El Salvador and
vowing to reconsider U.S. aid if the killers of six Jesuit priests
are not brought to justice.
   The resolution also asked that the Bush administration report to
Congress by Feb. 20 on the status of the investigation into the
deaths last week.
   The new guerrilla attack came one day after Bush reaffirmed
strong U.S. support for Cristiani's rightist government. The United
States has provided about $3.5 billion to oppose the insurgency
over the last decade.
   The State Department warned U.S. citizens not to travel to El
Salvador and urged Americans already there to register with the
U.S. Embassy.
   Ms. Tutwiler said some 20 hotel guests, including several
Americans, who had been in the unoccupied part of the hotel were
led out by Salvadoran armed forces and taken to Army high command
headquarters Tuesday afternoon.
   Although the hotel that was attacked Tuesday is called the
Sheraton, the U.S.-based hotel chain said it sold its interest
several years ago.

   MEMPHIS (AP ) _ President Bush on Wednesday urged the news media
and other organizations to join his crusade for volunteerism by
publicizing good works until they become part of ``everyday
thinking.''
   ``Imagine if every institution, from airlines to dry cleaners to
high schools to neighborhood softball teams, were to join regularly
honoring as heroes those who are engaged in the war against drug
abuse, illiteracy, AIDS, homelessness, hunger and other problems,''
Bush said in a speech at the Commercial Appeal newspaper.
   ``We are nearing the dawn of a new decade. Let it be a decade
with no dark corners, no forgotten people, no forgotten places.''
   Bush made the comments at a soggy outdoor ceremony to honor the
Commercial Appeal's ongoing campaign focusing on people involved in
community service.
   The daily ``Points of Light'' feature in the newspaper stems
from Bush's inauguration call for ``1,000 points of light.'' It is
one of his favorite themes, and he uses the phrase to refer to
individuals, businesses and groups whose volunteerism makes society
better for everyone.
   Bush also paid a visit to St. Jude's Children's Research
Hospital, where he was greeted by the facility's founder,
entertainer Danny Thomas.
   Bush looked in on a handful of children cancer victims and said
he regretted he had never before visited the renowned center, which
specializes in fatal childhood diseases.
   In his remarks at the Commercial Appeal, Bush said other media
organization's should follow the newspaper's example in encouraging
community service.
   ``I'd like to challenge every publisher, every broadcaster,
every member of the American news media, to follow the lead of the
Commercial Appeal,'' he said.
   ``Imagine an America where service to others is a fact of life,
part of everyone's everyday thinking.''
   Bush told a crowd that gathered in a pouring rain outside the
newspaper that ``every one of us has a special talent that can help
solve America's problems. ... So if you've got a hammer, find a
nail. If you can read, find someone who can't . If you're not in
trouble, seek out someone who is. Because everywhere there is a
need in America, there is a way to fill it.''
   Bush also announced the White House would begin a ``points of
light'' program to each day single out a person or institution that
exemplifies the concept of community service.
   ``Each day the White House will recognize one individual or
institution who has successfully addressed our most dire social
problems by engaging in community service,'' the White House said
in a statement.

   Deficit reduction and health care for the
elderly, the two big issues Congress handled in its waning hours
early Wednesday, will be back next year, House and Senate leaders
say.
   And President Bush predicts ``some fights down the line'' when
Congress returns in January.
   Shortly before adjourning for the year in a nearly all-night
session, the House and Senate approved legislation repealing the
new Medicare catastrophic health insurance plan.
   Designed to protect the elderly from financial ruin because of
extended illness, the catastrophic law passed the last Congress
with great fanfare and bipartisan support. But organizations
representing the elderly organized against the plan and especially
its surtax of up to $800, which would have hit the wealthier
retirees next year.
   The Senate tried to save the part of the plan that extended
Medicare to cover long hospital stays, but the House insisted on
total repeal and, in the legislative equivalent of an
across-the-Capitol arm wrestle, the House won early Wednesday.
   Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell, D-Maine, told reporters
later he expected to work next year on catastrophic illness and
nursing home care coverage.
   ``We repealed the law, but we could not repeal the problem,'' he
said.
   On the other big final-night item of business, Mitchell and
House Speaker Thomas S. Foley defended the $14.7 billion deficit
reduction bill passed as lawmakers were about to leave town. But
they conceded more was needed.
   ``None of us is satisfied,'' Foley said.
   The bill includes several minor tax increases, leaves in place
the Gramm-Rudman law's across-the-board spending cuts into
February, trims Medicare costs and has a new system for paying
doctors under the program.
   Even with the reductions _ some of which are mere bookkeeping
changes _ the deficit in the current fiscal year will be well above
Gramm-Rudman's target of $100 billion for fiscal 1990, according to
congressional estimates.
   Bush, who submits his first full budget, for fiscal 1991, to
Congress in January, told reporters he was pleased the deficit bill
was finally passed. He praised the ``spirit of cooperation'' behind
the effort.
   The Democratic leaders blame Bush for the fact that the plan
isn't more substantial, especially the president's insistence for
much of the year that it had to include a cut in capital gains tax
rates. Bush agreed a few weeks ago to wait until next year to try
again for that cut, which Democrats contend is a giveaway to the
richest in America.
   Asked Wednesday about his sometimes contentious relations with
Congress, Bush said he wanted to be ``a healer'' on the day before
Thanksgiving.
   ``This is not the time to pick a fight,'' he said, but
acknowledged there will be ``some fights down the road.''
   Consumer advocate Ralph Nader promised Wednesday he would launch
a fight for Congress to repeal next year the pay raise it voted to
give itself.

   Entertainers Liza Minnelli, Willie Nelson,
Smokey Robinson and Andrew Lloyd Webber were honored as ``Grammy
Living Legends'' for their contributions to the music industry.
   The two-hour gala was staged Tuesday by the National Academy of
Recording Arts &amp; Sciences to honor influential veteran performers.
It featured performances by the honorees and others such as Kris
Kristofferson, Gene Autry, Emmylou Harris and New Kids on the Block.
   It was videotaped for broadcast Friday on CBS.
   ``These legendary artists have shaped and advanced music,
influenced society and are still at the height of their careers,''
Mike Greene, president of the academy, said in a statement.
   Ms. Minnelli recently demonstrated musical vitality in the new
album ``Results,'' which experiments with an updated, popular sound.
   Lloyd Webber, a three-time Grammy award winner, was honored for
his creation of such theatrical blockbusters as ``The Phantom of
the Opera,'' ``Evita,'' and ``Cats.''
   Nelson, whose most recent album is titled ``A Horse Called
Music,'' has won five Grammys and is known for such classics as
``Always on My Mind,'' ``Mamas, Don't Let Your Babies Grow Up to Be
Cowboys,'' and ``On the Road Again.''
   Robinson has recorded some 40 albums in his more than 30-year
career. With the group the Miracles, he established himself with
songs like ``Tracks of My Tears.'' Later he went solo and has
enjoyed success with ``Being With You,'' and ``Just to See Her.''

   President Bush has a place in
history. Now he's on the map. A small island near his vacation home
has been named in his honor.
   President Bush Island, four uninhabited acres of ledge, rocks
and woods, is located along a route often traveled by Bush when he
is boating and fishing during his vacations in Maine.
   The island, formerly Green Island, was named for Bush by a
couple who have known Bush and his family for years.
   ``My father and his grandfather were good friends,'' Elizabeth
Milligan said Tuesday from her winter home in Florida. ``Our
families have known each other for a long time, and we just thought
it would be nice to have something in Kennebunkport named after the
president.''
   She said she had not heard from the president concerning the
honor, but, ``We wrote them in the summer that if they had any
objections, we would like to know. We have had no objections.''
   Milligan, who has owned the island for 35 years, announced the
name change and said the property eventually would be turned over
to the Kennebunkport Conservation Trust to assure its protection
for future generations.

   Does celebrity Mayor Sonny Bonno
have his eye on the governor's race? The singer-actor-politician
was quick to nix that suggestion after he huddled privately with
the current holder of the job.
   Bono met with Gov. George Deukmejian on Tuesday before the state
leader spoke at a regional meeting of law enforcement officials in
Palm Springs.
   After the two GOP colleagues met behind closed doors, they
appeared briefly and spoke to reporters who asked whether Bono
aspired to be governor.
   ``As far as his role in party politics or other office, that's
certainly something that's up to him,'' said Deukmejian, who isn't
running for re-election next year.
   Bono was quick to respond that he had ample challenges running
this desert resort city and wouldn't seriously consider assuming
responsibility for the entire state.
   Bono, 54, starred with ex-wife Cher on the television variety
series ``The Sonny and Cher Comedy Hour,'' in the 1970s. In April
1988, he was elected mayor of this desert community, located about
100 miles southeast of downtown Los Angeles.

   The State Department, citing ``the democratic
evolution in Hungary and Poland,'' today stopped processing new
applications for refugees allowed to emigrate to the United States
from those East bloc countries.
   ``Unless we change our present policy and practices, we will be
unable this year to process and admit other deserving applicants
from such countries as Bulgaria and Romania,'' spokeswoman Margaret
Tutwiler said.
   She said the majority of the 6,500 slots for refugees from
Eastern Europe came from Poland and Hungary and that there was a
backlog of 20,000 people from those countries awaiting resettlement
in the United States while living in Western Europe.
   Under the new policy, no new applications will be taken from
Hungarians and Poles ``unless they are in immediate danger for
political reasons,'' Ms. Tutwiler said.
   The Hungarians and Poles with ties in the United States who
previously registered for immigration interviews before today will
be heard, she said.
   ``In the interests of insuring that our refugee resources are
allocated to the most needy, and in recognition of the democratic
evolution in Hungary and Poland, the administration has decided to
change the refugee programs for those two countries,'' the
spokeswoman said.
   ``Exceptions to this policy will be granted only on a limited
case-by-case basis with the approval of Washington,'' Ms. Tutwiler
said. ``Regular U.S. immigration programs will, of course, continue
to be available to all Eastern Europeans.''

   Bombings, stabbings and shootings left
35 people dead Wednesday, the first day of voting to determine if
Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi's Congress Party or a newly energized
opposition governs India for the next five years.
   Each side accused the other of massive fraud.
   Fifteen of India's 25 states and five of its seven federally
ruled constituencies voted Wednesday. Balloting continues Friday
and Sunday, but no results are to be announced before Sunday night.
   Voters will choose 524 members of the Lok Sabha, or House of the
People, the law-making lower chamber of Parliament. The Lok Sabha
will choose the next prime minister.
   Gandhi _ the 45-year-old grandson of Jawaharlal Nehru,
independent India's first prime minister, and son of slain Prime
Minister Indira Gandhi _ sought to portray the election as a choice
between stability and chaos. Only his family's party, he said,
could guarantee economic improvement and combat ethnic and
religious tensions.
   He was challenged by a five-party opposition coalition known as
the National Front, a loose alliance of parties spanning the
ideological spectrum and led by former finance and defense minister
Vishwanath Pratap Singh. It built its platform on promises of
honest leadership, accusing Gandhi's government of high-level
corruption and ineptness.
   Opinion polls suggested the Congress Party could lose power for
the second time since 1977, but Gandhi professed confidence. ``We
are going to win,'' he said after casting his ballot.
   Preliminary reports after polls closed estimated voter turnout
at 55 percent, about normal.
   More than 100,000 paramilitary troops were deployed to bolster
security, but reports of violence mounted. Indian elections
traditionally are violent, and the killings brought to 79 the total
deaths since parliamentary elections were announced Oct. 17.
   In Gandhi's Amethi constituency, a remote rural area in northern
Uttar Pradesh state where Gandhi is seeking re-election to
Parliament, the prime minister's opponent was roughed up by police
when he complained of ballot-stuffing. The candidate, Raj Mohan
Gandhi, is the grandson of independence leader Mohandas K. Gandhi.
   A local opposition leader, Sanjay Singh, was shot in the arm
about three miles from Amethi town, said aides. They claimed the
gunman was a Congress Party worker.
   Dinesh Goswamy, spokesman for the National Front in New Delhi,
alleged police helped Congress Party workers rig a large number of
polling booths.
   Anand Sharm, the Congress Party's chief spokesman, scoffed at
the allegations and accused the opposition of rigging votes.
   Three bombs rocked the Kashmir valley near the Pakistan border,
where Moslem militants who want to secede from predominantly Hindu
India warned voters to boycott the election. No one was injured.
   In the town of Anantnag, militants placed two coffins near a
polling station with signs that read: ``Whoever votes will meet
this fate.''
   Kashmir election officials estimated voter turnout at less than
5 percent.
   Violent clashes between Congress Party workers and opposition
supporters were reported in northern Haryana and southeastern
Andhra Pradesh states.
   In Uttar Pradesh state, where the Congress Party's traditionally
heavy suppport has been eroded, opposition leaders charged the
electoral roll did not contain the names of many 18-year-olds
eligible to vote for the first time.
   The Congress Party has ruled India for all but 29 months since
independence from Britain in 1947.
   Even when the Congress Party was ousted in a 1977 election, the
opposition was not nearly as united as the National Front is today.
The vote then was considered more a vote against then-Prime
Minister Indira Gandhi and her emergency rule than a vote for the
opposition. Mrs. Gandhi returned to power shortly afterward.
   Gandhi was swept into office on a massive sympathy vote in
December 1984, two months after his mother was assassinated.
   The initial aura of confidence and optimism inspired by the
youthful Gandhi, a Western-educated former airline pilot, has faded
as allegations of corruption dogged his friends, his party and his
government.
   The main accusation stems from newspaper reports that the
Swedish arms manufacturer AB Bofors paid up to $50 million in
kickbacks to win a 1986 contract to sell India $1.4 billion in
artillery guns.
   Gandhi denied that any Indian received kickbacks or commissions.

   A memo posted in the squad room of a sheriff's
substation told deputies the county would issue them three
undocumented aliens they each should carry in the trunks of their
patrol cars.
   ``This is very much a racist document,'' said Louis Quijas, a
police captain in Kansas City, Mo., who is president of the Latino
Police Officers Association.
   Written on county stationery, the memo stayed tacked up for
about a week at the Poway substation before an angry deputy took it
down and sent a copy to the national association. Poway is a city
20 miles north of downtown San Diego that contracts with the
Sheriff's Department for public protection.
   The deputy, Sgt. Joseph Lopez, said Tuesday he was transferred
to the overnight shift at another substation within two weeks of
telling internal affairs investigators that he sent the copy to the
association.
   ``The transfer was too coincidental. It was to get me out of
there,'' he said. ``They think I'm too vocal, but I always stand up
for what I believe in.''
   Capt. J.C. LaSuer, commander of the Poway station, said the
reassignment was prompted by unrelated personality conflicts.
   He acknowledged that the memo, which was accompanied by a
photograph of what it described as the county's standard-issue
undocumented workers, was in bad taste.
   ``It's a shame because we work so darn hard to try to get
positive things going with the migrants up here,'' he said. ``This
is something that should not have been done.''
   He said the internal investigation has ended, but no decision
has been made on any action.

<TEXT>
   A Soviet scientist who first visited
the United States last year to monitor nuclear weapons tests
defected quietly during a private return visit _ and separated from
his family to do it.
   Boris Kazak, a geophysicist with the Soviet Academy of Science,
said he met with an FBI agent outside a coffee shop in remote
Mojave, Calif., on Friday and told the agent he wanted to seek
political asylum.
   Kazak disclosed his defection Sunday to a reporter in
Independence for the Inyo Register, a Bishop, Calif., newspaper
that agreed to the scientist's request that the news not be printed
until Wednesday.
   The FBI would not comment, citing bureau policy.
   Kazak, 51, said he was so impressed by his nuclear weapons
inspection visit to rural Inyo County that he arranged a personal
invitation from the owners of the Eastern Sierra News Service to
return to Independence, a town of 1,000 residents about 80 miles
east of Fresno.
   ``What shocked me in America was the total disregard of all the
titles, be he a baron or a count or a king. No difference,'' he
said.
   Armed with the invitation, Kazak, also a qualified electrical
engineer, obtained visitor visas for his wife Ljudmila, son Juri
and himself. The family was allowed to take only $600 out of the
country with them. They arrived Oct. 15.
   Friends found a house for them in the Eastern Sierra Nevada area
and arranged an account at a local food market. But Ljudmila, 44,
and Juri, 15, decided to return to the Soviet Union.
   Pained embraces marked their departure Friday from Los Angeles
International Airport, he said. Then he met the FBI to defect.
   Kazak has two months to apply for legal resident status in the
United States. He said he hopes to find work and persuade his
family to return.
   Kazak said his wife had never liked the idea of defecting and
worried that her defection could bring harm to her mother and
brother. She also was in poor health, did not speak English and
simply missed her home, he said.
   Kazak, who speaks French, German and English, specializes in
developing instruments to measure the earth's movement.
   He spent several months in the United States as part of an
exchange organized by scientists to demonstrate that the
superpowers could effectively monitor nuclear tests, an important
component of some arms-reduction treaties.

<TEXT>
   Prime Minister Tadeusz Mazowiecki, the
East bloc's first non-Communist government leader, travels Thursday
to the Soviet Union in hopes of resolving sensitive issues and
making headway on economic reforms.
   More than 40 years of Communist rule in Poland ended Aug. 24
when the Parliament elected Mazowiecki, a former Solidarity editor
and close adviser to Lech Walesa, to lead the new government.
   The Soviet government sent its ``friendly congratulations'' upon
Mazowiecki's election. Mazowiecki has said Poland would respect its
Warsaw Pact obligations but that relations between the two
countries must be based on reciprocity.
   Though bound by economic and military treaties to Moscow, the
new government is emotionally distant from its powerful neighbor,
which installed Communists in Poland after World War II.
   Mazowiecki's first foreign trip took him to Rome to meet with
Polish-born Pope John Paul II and not to Moscow, as tradition
required of his Communist predecessors.
   During the trip, Mazowiecki intends to raise the painful matter
of ``blank spots'' in history, such as the massacre of Polish
officers during World War II in the Katyn forest, as well as seek
an improvement in the situation of an estimated 2 million Poles
living in the Soviet Union.
   Poland also would like to renegotiate the terms of trade with
the Soviet Union, which accounts for one-third of Poland's foreign
trade. A high-level delegation of economic officials is
accompanying Mazowiecki.
   Poland conducts one-third of its foreign trade with the Soviet
Union and is seeking Soviet support for its transition to a
market-oriented economy and efforts to make its currency, the
zloty, convertible.
   The Soviet Union exercises considerable influence on the Polish
economy because it supplies almost all of Poland's oil, natural
gas, and iron ore as well as many of the cars, planes, washing
machines and televisions.
   Polish government spokesman Malgorzata Niezabitowska said the
current situation in East Germany and the issue of eventual German
unification would be among the issues discussed.
   Both Poland and the Soviet Union have suffered from German
aggression in the past and appear to be wary of the potential
emergence of a powerful German nation in the heart of Europe.
   Mazowiecki is to spend two days in Moscow meeting with Soviet
officials, including President Mikhail S. Gorbachev.
   Mazowiecki, a Roman Catholic, is to travel Sunday to the city of
Zagorsk, the site of a Russian Orthodox monastery.
   Later that day, he is scheduled to travel West to the Katyn
forest, where more than 4,300 Polish officers were murdered in
World War II.
   Katyn is one of the war's most painful memories for Poles, and a
Soviet memorial to the officers places responsibility for the
murder on Hitler's army.
   Most Poles and Western historians believe that the officers were
massacred by the Soviet secret police in the spring of 1940 after
they were deported to the Soviet Union following the oubreak of
World War II.
   A joint Soviet-Polish historical commission established by
Gorbachev and Polish President Wojciech Jaruzelski in 1987 to clear
up the ``blank spots'' has yet to deliver a verdict.
   This year, the Polish side of the commission said there is no
reasonable doubt the Soviets were responsible.
   Mazowiecki is also planning to meet with representatives of the
estimated 2 million-member Polish community in the Soviet Union.
Millions of Poles were deported to the Soviet Union during World
War II and many were not allowed to return after the war.
   Niezabitowska said Poland wants Poles living in the Soviet Union
to have greater possibilities to cultivate their native culture and
traditions.
   Mazowiecki also will visit Leningrad.

<HEAD>Group Urges Special Requirements for Independent Operators</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A national environmental group on Wednesday
asked federal regulators to set special rules for independent power
producers to build or run nuclear power plants.
   The move by Public Citizen, an anti-nuclear group founded by the
consumer activist Ralph Nader, was in anticipation of a trend
toward independent power producers _ companies other than electric
utilities seeking to run nuclear stations.
   Public Citizen filed a petition with the Nuclear Regulatory
Commission calling for the agency to require independent producers
to meet special regulations governing the issuance or transfer of
plant construction permits or operating licenses.
   The NRC regulates all U.S. commercial use of nuclear energy. The
110 nuclear plants now in operation are owned by electric
utilities, but some non-utility companies recently have expressed
interest in entering the field.
   Joseph Fouchard, an NRC spokesman, said the commission has never
had a license application from an independent and has never
considered tailoring licensing requirements for specific types of
owners or operators. He added that the commission would consider
the Public Citizen petition and respond ``as soon as possible.''
   Public Citizen said its main concern was that the long-term
financial stability of independent power producers may be less
certain than that of utilities because independent producers are
not governed by state regulatory bodies that assure the utilities a
set return on their investment in power plants.
   ``If a nuclear (independent) can't produce enough power or sell
enough of the power it produces, it may not be able to pay for the
necessary maintenance and repair of its plant,'' said Daniel
Borson, a nuclear analyst at Public Citizen. That, in turn, could
jeopardize plant safety, he added.

<TEXT>
   Snow, dense fog and ice-covered roads slowed many people heading
home for Thanksgiving on Wednesday, one of the heaviest travel days
of the year with people packing highways, buses, trains and planes.
   Because of fog on the West Coast and snow in the Midwest, the
Federal Aviation Administration implemented a nationwide air
traffic quota system early Wednesday, keeping planes on the ground
until weather improved near their destinations, said Rob Doughty, a
spokesman for United Airlines in Chicago.
   ``We're going to try to get everybody over the river and through
the woods to grandma's house, but they have to be patient,'' said
Tom Troske, operations manager at Salt Lake City's airport, which
was socked in by heavy fog part of the day.
   This week's high wind, slick roads and cold have been blamed for
at least 14 deaths in Minnesota, Pennsylvania, New Jersey, Rhode
Island and Maryland.
   The worst weather for travelers Wednesday was fog in Utah that
began rolling off Great Salt Lake on Tuesday. It sporadically
reduced visibility at the airport from zero to about 1,200 feet,
Troske said.
   At Delta Airlines, the airport's largest carrier, eight inbound
and six outbound flights were canceled in the morning, said
district manager Fred Rollins.
   Larger, newer planes equipped with new radar enabling them to
come in during zero visibility were allowed to land, but older
planes such as Boeing 727s and 737s were being delayed, he said.
   Fog also disrupted arriving and departing flights Wednesday at
Portland International Airport in Oregon, although larger aircraft
already on the ground were allowed to leave.
   But Amtrak ticket agent Barbara Jackson in Portland said trains
were full. ``It's hectic and a pretty steady flow of people,'' she
said.
   Amtrak reservations on the Seattle-to-San Francisco and
Seattle-to-Chicago runs Wednesday and Sunday had been sold out for
two months, said spokesman Art Lloyd.
   Fog also was a problem in more temperate areas, closing Orlando
International Airport in Florida to arrivals until mid-morning and
delaying motorists heading for the airport. Departures were
unaffected.
   Light snow fell at Chicago's O'Hare airport, but no more than an
inch was predicted.
   An estimated 210,000 people were expected to pass Wednesday
through O'Hare, the world's busiest airport, with an additional
217,000 expected Sunday. The daily average is 160,000.
   But United spokesman Doughty said his airline expected 42,000
customers Wednesday at O'Hare, fewer than the record 49,000 the day
before Thanksgiving last year.
   ``Reservations are down and fares are up, the whole economy is
softer,'' he said.
   Six inches of snow blanketed parts of North Dakota on Wednesday,
causing dozens of fender-benders accidents. For Thursday, blowing,
drifting snow was expected with some temperatures only in the teens.
   ``For those going to Grandma's house on Thursday morning, it may
be kind of tricky,'' said Mark Ewens of the National Weather
Service in Fargo, N.D.
   Ice was the problem for travelers in northern New York state,
covering roads in Plattsburgh, Chazy, Malone and around Lake
Champlain, with blowing snow hampering visibility. In and around
the Malone area snow was packed on roads and slush made driving
treacherous, state police reported.
   Elsewhere in the Empire State, New York City's annual
Thanksgiving eve ritual _ gridlock created by holiday travelers and
shoppers _ was performed again Wednesday with more than 1 million
cars, up 12 percent from normal, creating ``an avalanche of
traffic.''
   ``It's like lemmings marching into the sea,'' said city
Department of Transportation spokesman Victor Ross.
   Not everyone tried to get in or out of the Big Apple by car. At
the Port Authority Bus Terminal, an estimated 280,000 people _ up
25 percent from an average day _ were moving through.
   At the metropolitan area's three airports _ Newark, LaGuardia
and Kennedy _ 1 million passengers were expected Wednesday through
Sunday, the Port Authority said.
   Not everyone traveled. In Washington, hundreds of volunteers
were already cooking for Thanksgiving dinner for the homeless, to
be served at the West front of the U.S. Capitol, said Mitch Snyder,
founder of the sponsoring Community for Creative Non-Violence.

   An envelope bearing two rare
misprinted stamps was withdrawn from auction Wednesday after
bidding failed to reach the minimum asking price of $1.9 million,
the auctioneers Christie's said.
   Christie's auction house will negotiate a private sale with an
international group that had expressed interest in purchasing the
Mauritius ``Post Office'' cover but failed to raise the necessary
funds before the auction, said spokeswoman Katharina Feller.
   Ms. Feller said bidding stopped at $1.6 million. The auctioneers
had predicted the stamps would bring up to $2.5 million, which
would be a record for any philatelic item.
   She described the outcome as ``rather unexpected.''
   Ms. Feller declined to reveal the identity of the seller, an
independent financial concern, or the prospective buyers.
   The envelope, bearing two of the finest known examples of the
red Mauritius ``Post Office'' one penny stamp, was originally
purchased for 5 rupees at an Indian bazaar in 1897.
   It was addressed to a ``Mr. Jerrom, Secretary to the Bombay
Auxiliary Bible Society, The Esplanade, Bombay, India.''
   Only 15 copies of the Indian Ocean island's one penny stamp are
known to exist, most of which are held in museums or the British
Royal family's collection.
   The ``Post Office'' stamps were the first to be issued by a
British colony. They were originally meant to read ``Post Paid''
but the reportedly poor-sighted watchmaker who engraved the plate
for the stamps used the words ``Post Office'' instead.
   In 1968, the envelope was bought for $380,000 by the brothers
Raymond and Roger Weill, stamp dealers from New Orleans.
   The stamps were put up for auction by the financial concern
which subsequently purchased the Weill brothers' collection.
   Ms. Feller said another lot from the Weill collection, the
British Guiana 2-cent ``Cotton Reel'' brought $366,000 at
Wednesday's auction.
   The record price for a stamp stands at $1 million for a U.S.
postmaster's provisional cover called the ``Alexandria Blue Boy,''
sold privately in 1981. The highest price at auction is for a West
German Baden 9 kreuzer stamp printed in the wrong color, which
brought $680,000 in 1985.

<TEXT>
   Citrus industry officials Wednesday
celebrated the first Europe-bound shipload of Texas grapefruit to
move out of the Port of Brownsville since a 1983 freeze devastated
Lower Rio Grande Valley groves.
   A chartered ship being loaded with 90,000 40-pound cartons will
pull out of Brownsville headed for West Germany by the end of the
week, said Charlie Rogers, president of the Texas Produce Export
Association, based in Harlingen.
   Rogers said there have been a few containerized shipments of
citrus to Europe out of the Port of Houston in recent years, but
nothing the size of the Brownsville shipment.
   Citrus exports from Brownsville were halted in 1983 by a rare
hard freeze that killed thousands of acres of trees. The industry,
concentrated in the state's three southernmost counties, has made a
steady comeback.
   ``We're approaching about 45 percent of pre-freeze production
levels. In acreage, we're probably a little over 55 percent of
pre-freeze number of citrus trees,'' said Les Whitlock, manager of
the Texas Valley Citrus Committee.

<TEXT>
   Congress has told President Bush to hold back
$115 million in contributions to the World Bank unless he certifies
its loans to China will promote individual freedom and human
rights, officials said Wednesday.
   The bank, owned by 152 countries, is the largest source of aid
to the Third World. Its president, Barber Conable, and its largest
contributions come from the United States.
   Most of its funds come from its borrowing on world markets.
   The bank halted new loans to China in June after the government
cracked down on the pro-democracy student movement, but it
continued to disburse money on loans granted earlier.
   Conable has said he hopes to resume new lending soon, but has
not set a date.
   Bush on Tuesday signed into law a bill that would make available
$965 million for the International Development Association, a part
of the bank that lends to the poorest countries. But the law says
that $115 million of that will not be available until Jan. 1.
   It also provides that the money will not be available then
unless the president certifies that any loans the bank makes to
China help the movement toward democracy.
   The $965 million brings the United States up to date on its
contributions to the eighth replenishment of funds for the poorest
countries, known as ``IDA-VIII.'' That totaled $12.4 billion for
the three years ending next June.
   Of 34 donors, the United States is the only one that has not
agreed to a contribution to the ninth replenishment. If it
continues to contribute 22 percent of the total, bank officials
calculated that Congress would have to appropriate $3.18 billion,
which would be $300 million more than under IDA-VIII, for the next
three-year period.
   Conable said Monday that the Bush administration wants to ask
Congress for the money but is working out what its place in the
federal budget should be.
   A meeting of representatives from the donor countries is
scheduled for next month.

<TEXT>
   Casino whiz Steve Wynn promised ``a wonderment
the world will flock to see'' and delivered on that promise
Wednesday with his glitzy $630 million Mirage Hotel _ including a
scented volcano.
   The 3,049-room hotel, opening five weeks ahead of schedule, is
the first new resort on the Strip in 15 years and already has
sparked a $2.5 billion building boom in this gaming and
entertainment capital.
   ``We've been waiting four years going on 20 to say, `Welcome to
the Mirage,''' Wynn said. ``We've often said fantasy becomes
reality. But fantasy is a dream, it's not real, at least not until
today.''
   Thousands of people poured into the resort when the doors opened
at noon. The first two ``guests'' to check in were two white tigers
belonging to illusionists Siegfried and Roy.
   The 30-story showplace cost more than 100 times the value of the
cluster of casinos that dotted the Strip when Wynn first visited
here as a 10-year-old in 1952.
   The hotel's 6,000 employees and a like number of guests were
given a preview look at the Mirage on Monday and Tuesday.
   Tuesday night saw a flurry of activity as workers stocked plush
stores and put the finishing touches on an exotic habitat for the
white tigers. Siegfried and Roy have signed a $58 million contract
with Wynn and will open in the hotel's new 1,500-seat showroom Dec.
26.
   That was the date Wynn planned to open the Mirage until he
landed the Sugar Ray Leonard-Roberto Duran championship fight,
which will be staged Dec. 7.
   Outside, tourists gawked and traffic stopped on the busy
six-lane Strip this week while workers conducted final tests on the
54-foot volcano that erupts with flames in front of the resort.
   Wynn was upset by the smell of the eruptions, and persuaded
utility executives to come up with a fuel mix that has the scent of
pina colada.
   The volcano and nearby waterfalls out front are designed to
block the neon lights of other resorts across the flashy Strip.
   ``I'm burned out on neon,'' said Wynn, whose downtown Golden
Nugget Hotel is also void of any neon. ``I think it's cheap. To me,
neon is yesterday Las Vegas.''
   The hotel's pool is one quarter of a mile around. Nearby is
planned a 1.5 million-gallon saltwater dolphin habitat approved by
the National Marine Fisheries Service.
   Guests registering for rooms with rates running from $89 to $129
are greeted by a $1.2 million aquarium containing 20,000 gallons of
water and four-foot sharks.
   Nearby is a nine-story atrium with 70-foot palm trees. And
there's a plan for ``The Jackson Attraction,'' featuring
memorabilia of Wynn's friend, Michael Jackson.
   The casino covers an area more than twice the size of a football
field. Features range from nickel slots to an elegant room for high
rollers where $1,000 chips are the minimum available.
   Running along the perimeter of the casino are restaurants that
will serve 2,500 people, and 30,000 square feet of retail space
catering to an upscale clientele.
   Wynn, chairman and majority owner of Golden Nugget, Inc., a
public company that owns the Golden Nugget and the Mirage, is
confident his new property will be profitable, despite the high
cost, saying it can earn the necessary $1 million a day.
   He said it would have $1.5 billion to build it in Atlantic City,
N.J., where Donald Trump's new 1,200-room Taj Mahal is expected to
cost $1.2 billion when completed next year.
   Wynn, who's had off-and-on battles with billionaire developer
Trump, said he wants to be known as a hotel operator, not ``the
star.''
   ``I want people to say that Steve Wynn built the best hotel in
the world. I don't want to say I own it. I want to be the guy that
designed it. That's my edge.''

<HEAD>Discovery Ready for Dazzling Thanksgiving Eve Launch</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: Leads with 6 grafs to update with weather deteriorating at overseas
landing site, picking up at the 4th graf previous, ``The countdown.''</HEAD>

   Discovery was set to light up the
sky tonight in a dazzling holiday liftoff that may be visible for
hundreds of miles as the shuttle streaks toward orbit with five
astronauts on a secret military mission.
   The Thanksgiving Eve launch was scheduled sometime between 6:30
p.m. and 10:30 p.m. If a forecast of clear skies holds, the
700-foot geyser of fire from the craft's solid fuel booster rockets
could be visible over a 700-mile track from Key West to Charleston,
S.C.
   But while the weather here looked favorable, Air Force
meteorologists said it had deteriorated at an overseas emergency
landing runway, a location called a trans-Atlantic abort site or
TAL, that is needed for launch.
   Without revealing the overseas site because the shuttle's route
was classified, Air Force spokesman Ron Rand said: ``The weather at
the TAL site does not look good, and it doesn't look like it's
going to get better.''
   He said observers at the site, believed to be Ben Guerir Air
Base in Morocco, would continue to monitor the situation and hope
for a break as the Discovery countdown continued.
   Technicians during the day pumped 528,000 gallons of liquid
hydrogen and liquid oxygen propellants into Discovery's 154-foot
external fuel tank, and NASA reported no problems with the
countdown.
   ``The countdown is on schedule; everything is going fine,'' NASA
spokeswoman Lisa Malone reported today. Shuttle crews had made up
12 hours' preparation time lost last week in replacing a faulty
rocket control unit.
   Forecasters said the weather should be 80 percent favorable for
a launch, raising confidence that the astronauts will have turkey
in space on Thanksgiving.
   An accident involving a truck pushing a forklift into a bunker
near the launch pad late Tuesday will not affect the mission, NASA
said. The bunker contains lasers used to position the shuttle
precisely on the pad, but they were not damaged.
   Because the shuttle's satellite is classified, the Pentagon will
not permit NASA to disclose the exact launch time until nine
minutes before liftoff. But it is expected to be about 7:30 p.m.
   There also will be a news blackout throughout the mission.
   Military officials say the secrecy is necessary to make it more
difficult for Soviet reconnaissance satellites and a spy ship off
Cape Canaveral to track the shuttle.
   Critics argue that the secrecy is unnecessary because the
Soviets, with their intelligence capability, undoubtedly already
know a great deal about the mission and that once Discovery is in
orbit, they will be able to track it precisely and know what is
doing.
   Sources close to the project reported the astronauts are to
deploy a $300 million 2{-ton signal intelligence satellite designed
to eavesdrop on military and diplomatic communications in the
Soviet Union and other countries. A similar satellite was released
on another shuttle flight in 1985.
   The flight crew is headed by Air Force Col. Frederick C.
Gregory, the first black named to command a shuttle flight. The
others are Air Force Col. John Blaha, the pilot, and three mission
specialists, Navy Capt. Manley L. Carter Jr., F. Story Musgrave and
Kathryn C. Thornton.
   The menu for the mission includes ``thermostabilized'' turkey
and gravy, which means the food has enough preservatives to be
carried without refrigeration.
   ``We are hopeful the crew will have Thanksgiving dinner in
space,'' said Dick Young, spokesman for the National Aeronautics
and Space Adminstration.
   The launch will be only the third after nightfall in 32 shuttle
missions. Gregory, and the pilot Air Force Col. John Blaha,
practiced night landings on the shuttle runway here in a jet
equipped to handle like a shuttle.
   The expected four-day mission will end with a nighttime landing
at Edwards Air Force Base, Calif.
   Gregory and Blaha also would have to land the shuttle in the
dark here or at emergency runways in Spain or North Africa in case
of an abort after liftoff.

<TEXT>
   Rene Mouawad, native of a mountain region
known for its violent feuds, was a cool-tempered lawyer who
advocated dialogue in his divided country.
   Mouawad, killed by a bomb Wednesday after only 17 days as
Lebanon's president, was an early advocate of reconciliation.
   As minister of education in 1981, he sliced through sectarian
hatreds to organize examinations for Christian and Moslem
youngsters whose studies had been interrupted by the civil war.
   He requisitioned schools in three districts east of Beirut so
the students could do their work, protected by a multi-sect brigade
from the Lebanese army.
   It was the fist time in six years that Christian and Moslem
students were able to do that.
   An art lover, Mouawad sponsored an operation to salvage 1,000
paintings and sculptures from Education Ministry warehouses set on
fire in Israeli air raids in 1982, during Israel's invasion of
Lebanon.
   Only a day before his death, Mouawad urged the Lebanese to come
together and work to end the bloody conflict.
   ``Enough agony, enough blood, enough destruction, enough
impoverishment, enough adventures,'' said the 64-year-old Maronite
Catholic president.
   ``Let's at long last close ranks and build the new Lebanon,'' he
said in a televised Independence Day address.
   Mouawad, elected president Nov. 5 as part of an Arab
League-sponsored peace plan, was unable to spread his government's
hold beyond Syrian-controlled regions and a part of the Christian
enclave north of Beirut.
   The most vocal opposition to his presidency came from a fellow
Maronite, army commander Gen. Michel Aoun, who denounced Mouawad as
a Syrian puppet and claimed his election was unconstitutional.
   Mouawad took part in a 20-member ``national dialogue committee''
formed in September 1975 to find a settlement to the civil war,
then five months old.
   ``Violence cannot solve problems. Dialogue is the only way to
find solutions,'' he said at the time.
   But that peace effort collapsed, as have many others since.
   Unlike the tough mountain warriors in his rugged home region of
Zgorta, known for its hot tempers, Mouawad often was referred to as
``the cool Zgortan.''
   The Mouawad family, and the Issa Khoury clan to which his wife,
Naila, belongs, are allied with the powerful Franjiehs in the
northeastern region.
   The Franjiehs are headed by former president Suleiman Franjieh,
one of the last of the old-style Maronite warlords.
   Mouawad had been a member of the 99-seat Parliament since he was
elected to represent his home region in 1957 at the age of 32. His
assassination left only 72 surviving members.
   He spent the first year of his parliamentary term as an exile in
the Syrian port city of Lattakia, after a member of a rival family
accused him of taking part in an inter-clan clash in June 1957 in
which 16 people were killed.
   Mouawad returned to Lebanon in 1958, shortly after newly elected
President Fuad Chahab dropped charges against him for ``lack of
undisputed evidence.''
   Later, the witness who testified against Mouawad withdrew his
allegation, saying it was politically motivated.
   Mouawad graduated with a law degree in 1947 from the
French-affiliated St. Joseph University in Christian east Beirut.
   He started his own practice in the northern provincial capital
of Tripoli two years later, but gave it up when he entered
Parliament.
   He was named minister of telegraphs and telecommunications in
1961 and held the post until February 1964. He was named minister
of public works in 1969 and minister of education in 1980.
   Mouawad is survived by his wife, Nayla, and two children,
23-year-old Rima, a law student in Paris, and 17-year-old Michel, a
high school senior in Paris.

   President Bush prepared to address the nation
Wednesday night on the momentous events in Eastern Europe, which
will be at the center of next week's summit with Soviet President
Mikhail S. Gorbachev.
   Bush was to deliver the prime-time, Thankgiving-eve speech from
Camp David, where he is spending the holiday with his wife, Barbara.
   It was the first time the presidential retreat in Maryland's
Catoctin Mountains has been used as the site for a nationally
televised speech. Bush's remarks set the stage for talks with
Gorbachev Dec. 2 and 3 on warships in the Mediterranean off the
coast of Malta.
   The meeting, originally billed as a relaxed, get-acquainted
session, has been transformed into a highly charged summit by the
opening of the Berlin Wall and the loosening of hard-line Communist
policies in East Germany, Hungary, Poland, Czechoslovakia and even
Bulgaria.
   ``It's impossible to deny the fact that we are at a moment in
history when many nations of the world are in transition and when
democracy and communism are in transition,'' White House press
secretary Marlin Fitzwater said in previewing the speech.
   Bush and Gorbachev have voiced hope for a calm and peaceful
period of change in Eastern Europe and Central Europe. Bush has
emphasized that the summit is not intended to reshape the future of
Europe.
   The meeting may produce a joint pledge not to interfere in the
political turmoil.
   Bush has said he will use the meeting to promote the process of
reform and democracy. The Soviets say the meeting could produce a
timetable for resolving key issues facing the two superpowers.
   The president told reporters aboard Air Force One that he was
looking to the Malta summit with the ``Boy Scout motto: Be
prepared.''
   ``I've got a lot of homework to do,'' he said. ``We're going in
a spirit of total good will. We are not going to blind-side our
allies.''
   Bush said he would not have a Yalta-type meeting, ``trying to
divvy up anything or decide the fate of any sovereign nation.''
   ``It would be presumptuous and arrogant for the president of the
United States _ superpower though we may be _ to try to decide the
future of Europe in a way that would impinge on the sovereignty of
any country, east or west.''
   On the eve of Bush's speech, Gorbachev said in Moscow that the
Soviet Union was ``well disposed'' to the changes sweeping Eastern
Europe. The Soviet Union and East European countries, he said,
``miscalculated'' the need for overhauling their badly strapped
economic structures.
   ``Now we have to make up for lost time and this requires a more
rapid pace of change,'' Gorbachev said. He predicted the reforms
``will affect everything'' in Eastern Europe and said he was in
favor of ``a society that is more open to the world and is ready
for cooperation.''
   Bush, before delivering his speech, made a two-hour visit to
Memphis, Tenn., to salute citizens involved in volunteer and
community service efforts, the kind of work that he calls ``a
thousand points of light.''
   As Bush left for Memphis, a contingent of Red Army soldiers
waving American flags greeted him on the White House lawn. Bush
shook hands with some of the 40 members of the Red Army Chorus,
which is touring the United States and Canada.
   On his return to Washington, Bush was to fly directly to Camp
David, where he will remain until Sunday.
   Bush will hold pre-summit talks at Camp David with British Prime
Minister Margaret Thatcher on Friday as he continues his
preparations for his first meeting with Gorbachev as president.

   When Robert Mays had to tell his only
child she was not his biological daughter, ``she cried and cried
for a long time'' then asked what the news meant, he said Wednesday.
   His voice at times breaking, Mays spoke publicly for the first
time since learning that genetic tests showed 10-year-old Kimberly
Michelle Mays was the daughter of another couple.
   ``I held her, she just simply wept. I was crying myself. She
said, `Daddy, daddy, daddy, what does this mean?'
   ``I told her, `Honey, it means only that you are not my
biological daughter and that means nothing in our life. I've loved
you, raised you and cared for you, and that's not going to
change,''' Mays said.
   Mays said he was ``shocked, disappointed and let down,'' Friday
when he learned the results of genetic tests that showed two
families had raised each other's child.
   Kimberly was born to Ernest and Regina Twigg, who reared a girl
named Arlena. Arlena, who died of heart disease last year, was born
to Mays and his wife, Barbara, who died of cancer in 1981.
   Kimberly and Arlena were born within three days of each other at
Hardee Memorial Hospital in rural Wauchula.
   Just before Arlena's death in Pennsylvania, the Twiggs learned
through genetic testing that she was not related to either one of
them.
   The Twiggs claimed in a federal lawsuit that a swap occurred in
the hospital and began a 14-month search for the child they lost.
The Twiggs, parents of seven other children, recently moved to
Sebring where Twigg is a railroad ticket agent and Mrs. Twigg is a
substitute teacher.
   Sebring is 65 mile east of Sarasota, where Mays is a roofing
contractor.
   Mays did not rule out a lawsuit of his own when questioned by a
throng of reporters in his attorney's office. He said his thoughts
now are only about Kimberly's welfare.
   ``It's history. It's over. It's time for both sides to just
think of her,'' he said. ``Kim is damaged. Kim will probably suffer
from this for the rest of her life in some manner or form.''
   He said he felt no anger toward the Twiggs.
   ``I sincerely believed Kimberly was my biological daughter up
until last Friday,'' Mays said.
   Mays said he would never have agreed to genetic testing of the
slender, hazel-eyed blonde if the Twiggs hadn't signed an agreement
in October promising not to seek custody of Kimberly no matter what
the test results revealed.
   He described Kimberly as a `very sensitive child'' who is
``totally confused right now'' and worried about hurting feelings
on either side.
   When Kimberly came home from school Friday, Mays had their
suitcases packed for an outing on their boat.
   ``She noticed a look of concern on my face and asked what was
wrong. I just sat her down on the edge of her bed and told her,''
Mays said.
   After he broke the news to Kimberly they left for a few days on
the boat, where Mays tried to console the girl and help her adjust
to the idea. Although there's no timetable, the next step is for
Kimberly to meet with psychologists who will make recommendations
about a first meeting and subsequent visitation schedule with the
Twiggs.
   He said it would be her decision on how to proceed. He said he
would be there to advise her.
   On one hand, Mays called it ``a sense of relief for me. I'm glad
it's over ... It was a tremendous burden not knowing.''
   ``But we can't change anything,'' he added. ``The facts are the
facts.''
   Mays hasn't come to grips yet with Arlena's death.
   ``I certainly feel a sense of loss,'' he said, adding that he
had been deprived of any contact with his biological daughter. He
added there will always be a question in his mind: ``Could I have
made a difference in her life?''
   Kimberly has celebrated her birthday on Nov. 29 and won't switch
to Dec. 2, the day the Twigg baby was born.
   ``I'm sure if it's left to Kim, she'll celebrate it on both
days,'' said Mays. ``We decided we'd do it on the 29th, sort of as
a remembrance to Arlena.''

   There's no place like home for the
holidays for most Americans, according to a poll released Wednesday.
   Ninety-seven percent of Americans surveyed spend one or more
holidays with their families each year, according to poll conducted
for the J.M. Smucker Co.
   The survey also showed the respondents were more likely than
usual to say grace before eating their holiday meal.
   ``We are pleased with the survey's results, which seem to
indicate that Old-World values are still alive and well in the
U.S.,'' said Tim Smucker, chairman of the Orrville-based jelly and
jam maker.
   According to the survey, Christmas and Thanksgiving were the
most popular holidays for gathering with relatives, with 95 percent
of those surveyed spending at least Christmas or Thanksgiving with
family members.
   Participants were asked if they usually celebrate any of six
holidays with family: New Year's, Valentine's Day, Easter, Memorial
Day, July Fourth, Labor Day, Thanksgiving and Christmas.
   Eighty-three percent of those surveyed begin their holiday meals
with a prayer or grace, while 48 percent begin daily meals that way.
   Respondents from all regions said they were likely to say grace
or a prayer before a holiday meal. Ninety percent of respondents in
the South, 86 percent of those polled in the Midwest, 77 percent of
those in the Northeast and 72 percent of the respondents in the
West said they planned to give thanks before holiday dining.
   People surveyed in the South were the most likely to report
beginning everyday meals with grace. Fifty-eight percent of
Southerners polled said they started daily meals with a prayer,
while 39 percent of the respondents in both the Northeast and West
said they did so.
   Asked which values they want most for their children to learn,
58 percent of those polled said honesty, 48 percent said a belief
in God and 27 percent said a respect for elders.
   The telephone poll of 1,030 adults nationwide was conducted Nov.
3-5 by Bruskin Associates of New Brunswick, N.J. The poll had a
margin of error of plus or minus 3 percentage points.
   The director of the survey, Dick Bruskin, said the survey
results were a change of pace.
   ``We're so used to dealing with statistics that point to the
deterioration of family life that this study comes as encouraging
news about where the American family really is today,'' he said.

   The Congress that adjourned early Wednesday
started last January by rejecting a pay raise, spent 11 months
doing preliminary work on clean air, child care, the deficit and
other matters, then voted itself a raise and left town.
   Mighty debates were held on abortion, flag burning, capital
gains taxes, and the unprecedented resignation of the speaker of
the House _ none of which added much to a meager legislative
portfolio.
   ``There's a sense that we didn't do a damn thing this year,''
said a discouraged Rep. Robert Matsui, D-Calif.
   ``It's sort of the lost year,'' agreed Rep. Vin Weber, R-Minn.
   That's not to say there were no accomplishments:
   _The minimum wage was raised for the first time since 1981.
   _A costly but important bailout and reregulation of the savings
and loan industry was enacted.
   _A legislative truce was reached, phasing out military aid to
the Contra rebels in Nicaragua.
   _Separate bills were passed by the House and Senate on oil spill
liability to help prevent or deal with another Exxon Valdez
disaster but resolving the differences between them was put off
until next year.
   _Aid was approved for Poland and Hungary and more money
earmarked for anti-drug efforts.
   And congressional leaders, trying to put a positive face on
things, say they laid a lot of ``groundwork.'' Make judgments next
year, ``when we have completed action,'' Senate Majority Leader
George Mitchell, D-Maine, implored reporters.
   But while some was done, more noteworthy were the things and
people that were undone.
   The most celebrated undoings of the year were the cases of two
Texans, House Speaker Jim Wright and former Sen. John Tower.
   Bush's nomination of Tower as secretary of defense seemed a sure
winner at first. The Senate almost never rejects an alumnus.
   But Tower became portrayed as a drunk and a womanizer who had
negotiated treaties for the United States and then turned around
and cashed in his knowledge with private interests. The rejection
gave Bush a black eye with his administration barely out of the
gate.
   The Tower episode left partisan scars in the Senate, but nothing
like the institutional heart attack suffered in the House.
   Democrat Wright was toppled after the House ethics committee
charged him with violating rules that limit gifts and outside
income received by lawmakers. Wright maintained his innocence, but
resigned before the full House could rule.
   Then his third in command, House Majority Whip Tony Coelho,
D-Calif., quit rather than face an inquiry into his private
financial dealings.
   ``Given the way we started the year, I think the big success is
we're up and running again,'' said Rep. Mike Synar, D-Okla.
   An entire new House Democratic leadership team, headed by
Speaker Thomas S. Foley, was installed. Wright's chief accuser,
Rep. Newt Gingrich of Georgia, was promoted to the No. 2 spot among
House Republicans _ and himself became target of an ethics probe.
   And other ethics cases linger.
   Five senators are under investigation for intervening with the
government on behalf of a savings and loan executive who gave their
campaigns thousands, and whose thrift later went under at a cost to
the taxpayers of billions.
   Several House members are being investigated after allegations
of sexual misdeeds, including one convicted of sex with an underage
girl and another who hired a male prostitute as a personal aide.
   A spectacular legislative undoing was the case of the Medicare
catastrophic illness law.
   Passed only a year earlier with great bipartisan fanfare, it
promised to protect retirees from financial ruin in cases of
extended serious illness. But Congress repealed it this year after
protests from angry elderly constituents who objected to paying up
to $800 a year to cover the costs.
   The Democratic-controlled Congress spent most of the year
disagreeing with Bush over the minimum wage. Legislation to raise
it to $4.25 an hour was passed this month only after both sides saw
embarrassment if they didn't act before the visit of Polish
Solidarity leader Lech Walesa.
   Another stalemate, over Bush's proposal for a cut in the capital
gains tax, poisoned the atmosphere for any serious effort to reduce
the federal deficit.
   Bush eventually agreed to wait until next year on his tax cut
and a last-minute deal was struck that claimed $14.7 billion in
deficit reduction _ at a time of $150 billion deficits _ and much
of it was just accounting changes.
   Two Supreme Court rulings resulted in huge debate but little
legislation.
   When the high court gave states more ability to restrict
abortion, it rekindled an issue that had been quiet for years.
Suddenly, lawmakers who had comfortably sat on the fence were
pushed over to the pro-choice side.
   But President Bush used his veto to beat back attempts by
Congress to restore federal spending on abortions for poor women
who were raped or victims of incest.
   When the court ruled unconstitutional a Texas law banning flag
burning, Bush, with rhetoric and events reminiscent of his
presidential campaign, pressed for a flag-protecting constitutional
amendment.
   Democratic leaders stalled action until public opinion turned
against such tinkering with the Bill of Rights, and Congress passed
a simple statute designed to meet the court's objections. If the
new statute is also overturned, the issue will be back.
   The Democrats point to the flag, abortion, and especially
capital gains as examples of how Bush took stands which had little
to do with problems Congress is equipped to solve. Next year, they
vow to move their agenda and bring Bush along.
   Republicans defend Bush as taking a wise and prudent course, and
share with Democrats the defense that this was only the first year
of a two-year Congress.
   ``A significant amount of shadow boxing occurred, but that isn't
all bad,'' said Sen. Pete V. Domenici, R-N.M. ``Shadow boxing
sometimes gets people ready.''
   For example, next year's clean air and child care legislation
``are going to be much better for it,'' he said.
   An ambitious clean air bill to attack the three major problems
of air pollution _ acid rain, urban smog and toxic chemicals in the
atmosphere _ got bogged down in the House in regional disputes over
acid rain and requirements for clean burning motor vehicle fuels.
Separate measures to increase federal child care assistance passed
the House and Senate, but end-of-session arguments in the House
prevented final agreement.
   Lawmakers are hoping they'll accomplish so much next year that
voters won't be upset next November about the pay raise they voted
themselves.
   A storm of public protest forced rejection of a 51 percent pay
raise proposal last winter. Congressional leaders never gave up,
and this month approved with broad bipartisan support a new plan.
   By Jan. 1, 1991, House salaries will jump to about $125,000,
with members then barred from making paid speeches before interest
groups. Senate salaries will probably just top $100,000 by then _
but they'll keep taking the lobbyists' speech money. Members of
both houses now make $89,500.
   Speaker Foley said the ethics reforms make the House bill a
``landmark'' and many House and Senate members said the Senate will
be forced to revisit its decision next year.

   Former Sen. Margaret Chase Smith planned
to spend Thanksgiving in Maine Medical Center, where she was
recuperating from ``a slight heart problem,'' a hospital
spokeswoman said Wednesday.
   The spokeswoman, Terry McGarvey, said Mrs. Smith, 91, was
expected to return to her home in Skowhegan in a few days.
   Mrs. Smith had requested that no additional information be
released, Ms. McGarvey said.
   Mrs. Smith was discharged Tuesday from Resurrection Hospital in
Chicago after a six-day stay and was flown to Portland, where she
was admitted to Maine Medical.
   She had been admitted to the Chicago hospital Nov. 16, after
suffering a digestion problem on a flight from Bangor to Chicago,
according to friend Merton Henry, a Portland lawyer.
   Henry said Wednesday he was told that the heart problem was
minor. ``It was probably brought on by the big attack of
indigestion she had,'' he said.

<HEAD>Government Opens Fisal Year with $26 Billion Deficit</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The federal government opened the new fiscal
year with a deficit of $26.09 billion in October, four times higher
than the imbalance the previous month, the Treasury Department said
Wednesday.
   While the flow of red ink was in line with expectations,
analysts said it pointed up the huge task the government is facing
in trying to meet the deficit reduction targets called for in the
Gramm-Rudman deficit reduction law.
   The deficit law sets a target of $100 billion for the fiscal
year that began Oct. 1. That would mean that with the budget year
just a month old, the government is already one-fourth of the way
toward hitting the deficit target for the entire year.
   Congress completed work early Wednesday on a deficit reduction
bill that would trim spending by $14.7 billion with a goal of
reducing this year's deficit to about $103 billion, according to
supporters of the measure.
   However, private economists said that estimate was based on
optimistic assumptions and that the actual deficit was likely to be
well above that figure.
   Michael Evans, head of a Washington forecasting company, said he
believed the 1990 deficit would hit $165 billion, up from an actual
deficit of $155.15 billion in the fiscal year that ended Sept. 30.
   ``We are not making any progress on the deficit,'' Evans said,
adding that his forecast is based on the assumption that the
country will avoid a recession next year. If a downturn, which some
forecasters consider likely, does occur, Evans said the deficit
will top $200 billion.
   The deficit in September, the last month in the 1989 budget
year, totaled $6.07 billion. This smaller deficit resulted from
higher government tax revenues, reflecting quarterly tax payments
made by corporations and individuals.
   Without that higher revenue, the October deficit climbed to
$26.09 billion. This was still slightly below the October 1988
deficit of $27 billion.
   Government revenues in October totaled $68.43 billion, while
spending was $94.52 billion.
   As usual, the biggest spending categories were for the military,
Social Security and other programs in the Department of Health and
Human Services and interest on the national debt.
   Military spending totaled $19.15 billion in October and is
projected to total $286.89 billion for the entire fiscal year.
   Social Security payments amounted to $19.86 billion last month
and are projected to total $242.95 billion for the full budget year
while other programs in HHS, including Medicare and Medicaid,
totaled $13.35 billion in October and are expected to cost $190.17
billion for the full year.
   Interest on the $2.89 trillion public debt amounted to $16.46
billion last month and is expected to total $254.36 billion for the
full fiscal year.
   The administration is projecting that spending for all
government activities in fiscal 1990 will amount to $1.179 trillion.

   Talbot ``Sandy'' D'Alemberte, a Florida
attorney and former chairman of that state's ethics commission, has
been hired as chief counsel for a Senate subcommittee investigation
of federal housing programs, the panel said Wednesday.
   D'Alemberte, 56, already has begun preliminary investigative
work at the request of the subcommittee chairman, Sen. Bob Graham,
D-Fla.
   Ken Klein, a Graham spokesman, said no agreement on compensation
has been reached as yet but said D'Alemberte likely would be paid
at or near the $240 maximum per-day allowance allowed under Senate
rules.
   The ranking Republican on the panel, formally named the HUD
investigation subcommittee of the Senate Banking Committee, is Sen.
Connie Mack, also from Florida.
   D'Alemberte is former law dean at Florida State University in
Tallahassee and is in line for the presidency of the American Bar
Association in 1991. He served in the Florida House from 1966-72
and was head of the ethics commission in 1974-75.
   The subcommittee was formed last month to investigate
allegations of favoritism and mismanagement at the Department of
Housing and Urban Development during the Reagan administration. A
House subcommittee investigation that began in April has all but
concluded its public hearings although staff investigations are
continuing.

<HEAD>Gov't Proposes Drastic Cuts in Subsidies, Price Increases</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BUDAPEST, Hungary (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government Wednesday proposed an
austerity program for next year that would forsee a 15 percent
increase in consumer prices and a big reduction in subsidies to try
to cut the budget deficit.
   The budget directives for 1990 presented in parliament by
Finance Minister Laszlo Bekesi provoked sharp criticism from
legislators who feared it would lead to higher inflation and
unemployment.
   On Tuesday, Premier Miklos Nemeth said Hungary's foreign debt
was expected to reach $20 billion by the end of the year.
   Hungary has embarked on an ambitious program of political
reforms. Last month, legislators adopted a series of laws to lay
the legal groundwork for the first free multiparty elections in
more than 40 years.
   Nemeth said Tuesday that measures necessary to stimulate the
stagnating economy and gain credibility for foreign investors would
not be as popular.
   Bekesi said a 15 percent increase in consumer prices was
envisioned for next year and subsidies were to be cut by 17
percent. According to the MTI news agency, the subsidy cuts would
result in a further price rise of 1.5 percent to 2 percent,
particularly affecting transport, energy, water and rents.
   Bekesi said the goal was to cut the budget deficit from $330
million to $250 million.
   Lawmakers also reviewed the government's three-year economic
program in a first reading which drew considerable criticism.
   Sandor Nagy, the leader of the official trade unions, said in
the nationally televised debate that the program ``would lead to
stagnation, inflation, impoverishment and unemployment.''
   MTI said Wednesday in a separate report that unemployment was
expected to double next year to between 50,000 and 60,000 people or
about one percent of the workforce.
   It quoted Csaba Halmos, who heads the state office for wages and
manpower, as saying unemployment was expected to reach more than
five percent ``over the next few years.'' He was not more specific
about the timeframe.
   Bekesi said that in order to counterbalance the increased cost
of living, spending on education and health would be increased by
40 percent.
   According to MTI, a $600 million package earmarked for social
welfare would allow an increase in the monthly pensions of $13 in
two stages and an increase in family allowances of $5.
   Pensioners in Hungary last year received an average of about
$75, but 250,000 pensioners are believed to live below the
government-accepted minimum subsistence level of about $66. The
average monthly wage is about $133.
   Pay raises of about 16 percent are envisioned in the program in
the fields of education, scientific research, health, justice and
in the police force, MTI said.
   The economic proposals will be reviewed again by the government
next month, taking into account the changes suggested by the
legislators.

   Former U.S. District Judge Walter L. Nixon
Jr., removed from the bench and stripped of his salary, lost his
law license Wednesday when the Mississippi Supreme Court ordered
him disbarred.
   Nixon, 61, was released Tuesday from a halfway house in New
Orleans, where he was completing a prison term for perjury. He was
convicted in 1986 and sentenced to five years for lying about
discussing a marijuana case with a prosecutor.
   On Nov. 3, the Senate voted overwhelmingly to take Nixon off the
bench in Mississippi and strip him of his $89,500 salary. He had
earlier been impeached by the House.
   Under state Supreme Court rules, a felony conviction results in
automatic disbarment.

<TEXT>
   The Senate early Wednesday confirmed President
Bush's choice for the key job at the National Labor Relations
Board, but the administration's nomination for one of three other
slots at the agency was returned to the White House because of
Republican opposition.
   Confirmed as NLRB general counsel was Jerry Hunter, the state of
Missouri's former top labor official. The general counsel is
independent of the board and chooses the cases the panel will hear.
   The nominations of Hunter and Bush's three choices for the board
itself, Dennis M. Devaney, Clifford R. Oviatt Jr. and Donald
Rodgers, were being treated as a package until opposition to
Rodgers surfaced.
   The National Right to Work Committee has opposed Rodgers, a
former Teamsters union official, on grounds he supports compulsory
unionism. The organization has mounted an aggressive lobbying
campaign to defeat the nomination, and won at least a temporary
victory as the Senate rushed toward adjournment early Wednesday.
   By law, all nominations must be returned to the White House if
they have not been considered and the Senate is adjourning for a
period of longer than 30 days, unless senators agree unanimously to
carry the nomination over until Congress reconvenes.
   Unanimous consent was granted to requests to hold over the
nominations of Oviatt and Devaney, but conservative Republicans
forced the Rodgers nomination back to the White House. Bush either
would have to renominate Rodgers, name him as a recess apppointment
while Congress is out of session or name a replacement.
   The Senate did vote to allow Devaney, himself a recess
appointment of former President Reagan, to continue serving until
Dec. 16. His nomination for a full term will be taken up after
Congress returns.

   The work was finished, the panels
had been replaced and space shuttle workers were packing up their
tools when a technician noticed he was missing a screwdriver.
   Like everything else having to do with the space shuttle, this
event Tuesday night prompted a hurried meeting of top brass.
Launching space shuttle Discovery with a screwdriver rattling
around somewhere in its innards does not fit with NASA's mission
plans.
   ``We could only assume that it had been left in the aft
(compartment); you have to assume the worst,'' said Lee Solid, site
director for Rocketdyne, contractors for the space shuttle main
engines.
   The aft compartment contains the shuttle's three huge engines.
   All technicians who had worked in the area searched their tool
kits looking for the Phillips screwdriver, weighing 42 grams. No
luck.
   Engineers for Rocketdyne, NASA and Robert Crippen, the man who
has the final word on launching the shuttle, met to discuss the
problem.
   ``We had assessed whether it would have been a problem, and
accepted the risk,'' said Solid. An analysis showed, he said, that
the errant screwdriver would cause no problem even if it hitchhiked
in the aft compartment.
   In the 31 previous shuttle flights _ indeed in all the manned
space launches _ many tools have gone along unintentionally,
although Solid said ``we have very stringent tool-control.''
   In the end, it was much ado about nothing.
   The screwdriver was found on the floor.

   A Jesuit leader charged Wednesday that the
United States was handing ``weapons to butchers'' in El Salvador,
suggesting that Washington shares responsibility for the slaying of
six priests there.
   The Rev. Joseph O'Hare, president of Fordham University, spoke
at a Mass for the slain priests that drew more than 1,000
worshipers, including New York's Roman Catholic cardinal, John J.
O'Connor, three bishops and the Vatican's representative to the
United Nations, Archbishop Renato Martino.
   The slain priests, including the rector and vice rector of
Central American University in San Salvador, were dragged from
their beds and shot to death last week. Their two housekeepers also
were slain.
   Human rights observers blamed the Salvadoran army or right-wing
death squads for the murders, while the U.S.-backed government
denied involvement. Clerics in El Salvador long have been accused
of siding with leftist rebels.
   O'Hare, in his homily, decried the billions of dollars in
military aid given to El Salvador by the United States. While U.S.
policy ``in theory at least has had respectable objectives,'' he
said, its effect has been to escalate violence and thwart political
negotiation.
   He said the killings of the priests ``pose with brutal clarity
the question that continues to haunt the policy of the United
States toward El Salvador: Can we hand weapons to butchers and
remain unstained by the blood of their innocent victims?''
   The comment was greeted with a half-minute of applause, a most
uncommon event during Mass.
   The slain priests and their housekeepers were martyrs, O'Hare
said, ``champions of the poor'' killed for their commitment to
human rights. ``We can only be humbled by their commitment to the
truth,'' he declared.
   One worshipers was Bill Ford, brother of Ita Ford, a Maryknoll
nun who was killed with two other nuns and a lay worker in El
Salvador nearly nine years ago. He spoke outside the church of his
``sense of deep disappointment that eight years, nine years have
made really no difference.''
   ``The killers are still armed and financed by the United States
government,'' Ford said. ``And I just have to wonder how many more
people have to die before our government realizes that we are
giving guns and ammunition to murderers.''
   O'Connor did not speak at the Mass and left without commenting
to reporters.

   China will continue as one of the world's
biggest wheat importers at least through the coming decade, an
Agriculture Department report said Wednesday.
   ``Wheat is currently in great demand as a preferred food
grain,'' said the department's Economic Research Service. ``Due to
population growth and income increases, China will remain a major
wheat importer through the end of the century.''
   The brief report noted that China was the biggest importer of
U.S. wheat in 1988-89. Those sales totaled 8.1 million metric tons
in the marketing year that ended last May 31. The Soviet Union, by
comparison, imported less than 5 million tons in the same period.
   ``Despite the political turmoil in China's major cities this
spring, agricultural production has been virtually unaffected,''
the report said. ``However, China's agricultural trade,
particularly imports, will grow more slowly because of the lower
availability of foreign exchange resulting from a slower rate of
foreign investment and less tourism following the unrest.''
   But the report added that China's ``wheat imports will remain
high to avoid unrest among urban consumers.''

   Producers who have 1985-crop corn and grain
sorghum stored under federal price support loans in the
farmer-owned reserve program will be allowed to extend these loans
for another year, the Agriculture Department said Wednesday.
   Keith Bjerke, executive vice president of the department's
Commodity Credit Corp., said the loans are scheduled to mature
after Dec. 31.
   ``This action will ensure that adequate supplies are maintained
in the feed grain FOR (reserve program),'' he said.
   Farmers who put grain in the reserve normally must leave it
there until market prices rise enough to trigger its release, or
until the loans come due. At that time, the grain is available for
use or sale on the market.
   By extending the loan period, the grain can be kept off the
market for an additional time, during which the farmer can draw
federal rental payments at an annual rate of 26.5 cents per bushel.
   Bjerke said the one-year option also will be availalbe to those
producers who previously extended their loans for six months.
   But 1989-crop feed grains will not be allowed entry in the
reserve program, since a substantial portion of these crops have
already been marketed, he said. Decisions about the reserve and the
1990 crops will be made later.
   Farmers should contact local offices of the Agricultural
Stabilization and Conservation Service for details, Bjerke said.

<TEXT>
   A 25-year-old man was convicted
Wednesday of killing 15 people when, in a fit of jealousy, he set
fire to a rooming house 5{ years ago.
   An Essex County Superior Court jury deliberated 10 hours over
two days in the case of James Carver.
   As the jury announced its verdict, Carver's wife, Maryjane,
began to screech ``No, no, no'' and cried out ``He didn't do it!''
Carver kept his eyes straight ahead. But when handcuffs were
clapped onto his wrists, he buried his head in his hands.
   Mrs. Carver was taken to Anna Jacques Hospital in Newburyport
and released later.
   Carver faces a mandatory life sentence with a minimum 15 years
in prison. Sentencing was set Dec. 1. Carver's attorney, Dennis
Jackson, immediately filed an appeal.
   The prosecution said Carver, a former truck driver, set the fire
July 4, 1984, because he was jealous that his former girlfriend was
dating a man who lived at the Elliott Chambers rooming house in
Beverly, 15 miles north of Boston.
   The rooming house had 33 residents when the fire broke out; 13
died in the fire, a 14th was killed jumping from a window and
another victim died weeks later.
   Asked how the case was lost, Jackson said the jury ``had to
believe the confessions, the alleged confessions, and disbelieve
the mother.''
   Gail Carver took the stand at her son's trial to say she saw him
asleep at her home in Danvers at the time of the fire.
   ``Now I hope that the families and friends of those 15 people
(who died) can have some peace,'' said District Attorney Kevin
Burke.
   Burke said the heart of the prosecution's case was Carver's own
words.
   ``It's an accumulation of evidence, but it was the statements of
the defendant himself, the admissions he made to several people,''
Burke said.
   It was Carver's second trial on the charges. The first ended in
a mistrial in March when a prosecutor found he had failed to give
the defense a statement that incriminated Carver.
   Burke noted that as a result of the tragedy, legislation was
enacted requiring water sprinklers in rooming houses.

<TEXT>
   Reforms sweeping the Soviet bloc don't
appear to be reaching communist North Korea, but the United Nations
Command still hopes for reduced tension on the Korean Peninsula, a
senior commander said Wednesday.
   U.S. Navy Rear Adm. Larry Vogt said the small amount of
information coming out of North Korea indicates the communist
nation is concerned about reforms in Eastern Europe and opposes any
attempt to emulate it. People in North Korea probably have not been
told about the changes in East Europe, he said.
   ``They just don't want to change,'' said the senior
representative of the United Nations Command to the Military
Armistice Commission that polices the cease-fire that ended the
Korean War in 1953. The U.N. Command comprises the United States
and 15 other nations that aided South Korea during the Korean War.
   Vogt said in an interview that contacts with North Korea through
armistice commission meetings at the Panmunjom truce site have
helped reduce tension and brought improvements along the
Demilitarized Zone dividing the nations.
   ``Both sides are exchanging information and ideas so we're very
helpful we will see some changes,'' Vogt said.
   ``Progress is measured probably in milimeters compared to what's
going on in Europe. But the fact that we can still see the South
and North getting together, shaking hands over a conference table
... and holding talks ... that's extremely important,'' he added.
   North Korea and South Korea technically remain at war since no
peace treaty was signed at the end of hostilities in 1953. The two
bitter rivals have been holding talks in recent months on easing
tension.
   The armistice commission can only police the ceasefire along the
DMZ and not seek any larger political solution to the Korean
confrontation, Vogt said. But the commission has made progress in
easing tension even if it has been gradual, he said.
   Violent and other serious confrontations between North and South
have declined steadily over the years, Vogt said. ``Our main
purpose is to maintain the truce. We've done that for 36 years,''
he said.
   Vogt noted that North Korea maintains the world's fifth-largest
army and the divided peninsula remains a major potential trouble
spot.
   U.S. forces can help preserve peace by remaining in South Korea
until a political solution is found to the confrontation with North
Korea, Vogt said.
   ``We're a trip wire. We actually are a deterrent here that the
North Koreans have to deal with,'' he said.
   Some U.S. congressmen have called for a reduction in the 43,000
U.S. troops in South Korea to save money. U.S. and South Korean
government officials oppose any reduction, saying it would be
premature.
   ``Any talk of force reductions ... could lead North Korea to
miscalculate,'' Vogt said.

<TEXT>
   Afghan Moslem insurgents announced
Wednesday that ``relatively fair'' elections would be held within
five months in guerrilla-controlled areas of Afghanistan and
refugee camps in Pakistan.
   The election would be run by a self-styled guerrilla government
based in Pakistan. Six of the seven major guerrilla parties have
agreed on the logistics, said Syed Gallani, justice minister of the
guerrilla government.
   Voting would be completed no later than April but ``hopefully it
will start before the end of this year,'' Gailani said. ``No doubt
conditions in Afghanistan are rather difficult for elections ...
(but) it will be relatively fair.''
   The U.S.-backed guerrillas have been fighting for 11 years to
oust successive communist governments in Kabul. They have promised
elections several times but postponed them for various reasons.
   Another guerrilla spokesman, Azim Nasser-Zia, said the
fundamentalist Hezb-i-Islami faction has refused to participate,
claiming elections are contrary to the tenets of Islam.
   Gailani said the polls will elect a council of 500 Afghans who
will either give the existing guerrilla government a vote of
confidence or replace it with another.
   The insurgents proclaimed a government-in-exile in February to
coincide with the withdrawal of Soviet combat troops from
Afghanistan after nine years of intervention.
   Western observers had predicted an early collapse of the Kabul
government following the Red Army's departure, but Afghan President
Najib remains in power and his communist troops control
Afghanistan's major cities.
   The guerrillas, however, control most of the countryside.
   Gailani said Afghans living in government-controlled cities
won't vote, effectively eliminating a third of Afghanistan's
estimated 15 million people.
   It is also doubtful that women will vote, Nasser-Zia said. Some
of the hard-line guerrilla groups reject female voting as
un-Islamic.
   About 3.5 million war refugees live in refugee camps in
Pakistan's Northwest Frontier Province. Another 2 million Afghans
fled to Iran.
   Ballot boxes will be located in refugee camps in Pakistan, but
Gailani refused to explain how the voting would be done inside
Afghanistan, where fighting continues, or in Iran where most
refugees live in cities, not camps.
   He said details will be released ``in the near future.''

   Here are some tips to help avoid fraud or debt problems during
the holiday shopping season, according to consumer groups:
   _Guard your credit card number. For example, don't allow
merchants to record your number when paying by check. Visa,
Mastercard and American Express forbid a merchant from charging the
credit card to cover the check if it bounces anyway.
   _Destroy carbon copies from all your credit card transactions.
   _Never lend your card to anyone.
   _Leave the cards you don't expect to use at home.
   _Double check your credit card bills to ensure all purchases are
listed correctly and contact the credit-card issuer immediately if
there's an incorrect expense. Cardholders are liable for up to $50
of unauthorized purchases before they report a card stolen or lost
but they're not liable for purchases after a report is filed.
   _Avoid impulse buying. Stick to a holiday-gift budget to avoid
going into debt with credit card charges you can't pay after the
bill arrives.
   _Use a lower-interest bank card in department stores if you
carry a balance, because most retail cards have higher rates than
bank cards. But if you can afford to pay off your accounts in full
at the end of the month, store cards can be good deals because they
carry no annual fees.
   _Consider paying off your holiday debt with a personal loan,
which may carry a lower interest rate than credit cards.
   _Contact your creditors if you have trouble repaying bills. In
many cases creditors are willing to work out a suitable repayment
plan. But if you run into problems, the National Foundation for
Consumer Credit, a non-profit group based in Silver Spring, Md.,
can direct you to a counseling office in your area. The number is
1-800-388-CCCS.

<HEAD>Honduras, Costa Rica Reject Meeting After Sandinista Talks Fail</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DORALISA PILARTE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MANAGUA, Nicaragua (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Honduras and Costa Rica on Wednesday
rejected Nicaragua's suggestion for an urgent meeting of Central
American presidents following the collapse of peace talks with
U.S.-backed rebels.
   With civil war raging in El Salvador, it seemed unlikely such a
meeting could occur anytime soon.
   Also Wednesday, a Foreign Ministry spokeswoman said a U.S. State
Department videotape purporting to show leftist Salvadoran
guerrillas training in Nicaragua was a fake and a ``cheap
propaganda'' move by Washington.
   Nine days of peace talks between the leftist Sandinista
government and the Contras, as the U.S.-backed rebels are known,
ended Tuesday in stalemate at the Washington headquarters of
Organization of American States.
   The talks dealt with reinstating a 19-month cease-fire that
Nicaragua President Daniel Ortega ended Nov. 1 and demobilization
of the Contra force, most of whom are in border camps in Honduras.
   Victor Hugo Tinoco, the deputy foreign minister leading the
Nicaraguan delegation at the talks, said his government would call
for an emergency meeting of the presidents of Honduras, El
Salvador, Guatemala and Costa Rica.
   Presidents of the four countries and Ortega agreed Aug. 7 that
the Contras should dismantle by Dec. 5, a deadline the Sandinista
delegation offered to extend until Dec. 31.
   The Contras were not part of the pact and have refused to
demobilize before general elections scheduled for Feb. 25 in
Nicaragua.
   ``This effort of peace proposed by President Daniel Ortega ...
succumbed because of the intransigent attitude of the
counterrevolutionary delegation,'' said a communique from Ortega's
office.
   It blamed the United States for the failure of the talks, saying
Washington's continued funding of the rebels allowed them to remain
in place, and it said Honduras was harboring the Contras.
   ``There is no doubt that the principal responsibility for the
existence and permanence of the Contras in Honduras falls on the
Honduran government, which is the one that should impede the use of
its territory as a base of aggression against a neighboring
county,'' the communique said.
   President Jose Azcona Hoyo of Honduras said Wednesday he would
not attend an emergency meeting. Azcona said the five presidents in
the Aug. 7 pact signed in Tela, Honduras, had agreed to a Dec. 8-9
meeting, which he would attend.
   ``Ortega is losing much prestige,'' Azcona told reporters at an
airport news conference before leaving for vacation Wednesday
morning. ``Ortega is being called upon to maintain a steady and
serene position ... and not to be worrying the area with his
attitude.''
   Honduras is holding general elections on Sunday and Azcona, who
by law cannot seek re-election after his four-year term, is to hand
over power to his successor Jan. 27.
   Carlos Rivera, acting foreign minister of Costa Rica, told
reporters in San Jose on Wednesday that his country would not
attend an emergency meeting.
   ``We do not believe that an emergency meeting is necessary,''
Rivera said after meeting with President Oscar Arias. ``We have
programmed a meeting of the presidents in Nicaragua for December,
and there we can discuss the Contra demobilization.''
   In El Salvador, fierce fighting now in its 12th day between the
Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front guerrillas and the
rightist government made it unlikely that President Alfredo
Cristiani could attend an special summit soon.
   There was no immediate response from Guatemalan President
Vinicio Cerezo.
   The fighting in El Salvador drew attention away from the
Sandinista-Contra talks.
   But Nicaragua was back in the spotlight on Monday when the State
Department screened a video it said showed top leaders of the
guerrillas taking part in training maneuvers at El Tempisque
training center, north of Managua.
   The United States regularly accuses the Sandinistas of training,
supplying and supporting the Salvadoran guerrillas. The Nicaraguan
government has said it hasn't done so since 1980.
   ``This video does not contain definite proof,'' said Foreign
Ministry spokeswoman Mercedes Borge. ``We consider it a montage.
This is just cheap propaganda by the State Deparment.''
   There is increased likelihood now of a Sandinista ``final
offensive,'' such as the one in March 1988 that drove right into
Honduran territory.
   That offensive, called ``Danto 88,'' took place shortly after
Congress refused to keep funding the Contras militarily, and forced
the rebels to the negotiating table with the Sandinistas. Since
then, Congress has been giving the Contras aid in the form of tents
and other non-lethal military supplies.
   The Sandinistas, who in 1979 ousted the government of rightist
President Anastasio Somoza, said that as of mid-1989 the 8-year-old
war with the rebels left 57,000 dead, injured or missing.

   Former U.S. Rep. Pat Swindall, convicted this
summer on nine federal perjury charges, was suspended from
practicing law Wednesday by the Georgia Supreme Court pending the
outcome of his appeal.
   Swindall, a conservative Republican who lost his re-election bid
to Democrat Ben Jones in 1988, was convicted in June of lying to a
grand jury about his negotiations with an undercover agent posing
as a money launderer.
   State Bar of Georgia rules stipulate that a lawyer convicted of
a crime involving moral turpitude may be suspended from practice
until all appeal rights are terminated.
   Swindall had asked the State Disciplinary Board to suspend his
license pending the outcome of the appeal.
   Swindall was sentenced to a year in prison and fined $30,000. He
remains free pending his appeal.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Ninety senators urged Cuban President Fidel
Castro in a telegram Wednesday to free three long-term political
prisoners, including one who has been fasting for 23 days.
   They also urged Javier Perez de Cuellar, secretary general of
the United Nations, to intervene with Castro to obtain the release
of the three _ Alfredo Mustelier, Ernesto Diaz Rodriguez and Mario
Chanes de Armas. All have been held more than 20 years.
   ``All three vow to to enter hunger strikes until they die or are
released,'' the senators said.
   ``These men are willing to sacrifice their lives for their
freedom,'' said Sen. Connie Mack, R-Fla., organizer of the Senate
appeal to Castro and the United Nations.
   ``We must not let their suffering continue in silence,'' Mack
said.
   The three prisoners are known as `plantados,'' a Spanish term
used to characterize long-term political prisoners in Cuba who
refuse to accept political re-education.
   The telegram to Castro read:
   ``We urge you to immediately release three `plantados' who have
served over 20 years in Cuban prisons. Alfredo Mustelier is now on
a hunger strike which could take his life. Ernesto Diaz Rodriguez
and Mario Chanes de Armas vow to continue the hunger strike. Their
continued imprisonment is in violation of Cuban law, which limits
prison terms to 20 years.''
   The 45 Democrats and 45 Republicans who signed the telegram
include Democratic Leader George Mitchell of Maine and Republican
Leader Bob Dole of Kansas.

   A man was sentenced Wednesday to 2{ years in prison
for flying a helicopter onto federal prison grounds in an escape
attempt by former championship raceboat driver Benjamin ``Barry''
Kramer.
   Charlie Clayton Stevens, 35, a sea urchin diver from Gold Beach,
Ore., attended his sentencing in a wheelchair, still recovering
from fractures in both legs and other injuries suffered when the
helicopter crashed April 17 at the federal Metropolitan
Correctional Center south of Miami.
   Stevens pleaded guilty earlier to bringing in the helicopter and
conspiracy in the planned escape by Kramer, who was convicted of
drug smuggling in Illinois and was awaiting trial in a Fort
Lauderdale cocaine case.
   Kramer hung on as Stevens took off, but the helicopter's rear
rotor snagged a wire atop the prison fence and crashed, injuring
both men.
   ``All I can tell you is I would rather have not done it,''
Stevens told U.S. District Judge James Kehoe.
   Kramer, 34, faces sentencing Jan. 19 on his guilty plea to three
counts. His brother, Mark Kramer, was sentenced Tuesday to 7{ years
as two other escape participants were sent to prison.
   Stevens was accused of buying two planes and a helicopter as the
front man for the escape plotters and started taking flying lessons
in January as the plan developed.

<TEXT>
   Here is a transcript of President Bush's
informal question-and-answer session with reporters Wednesday
aboard Force One en route to Memphis, Tenn.:
   Bush: Let me just make a couple of general comments. First, I'm
very pleased that the Congress has adjourned. We are pleased with
the reconciliation bill that finally was passed. I thank the
leadership, Republican and Democrat, on both sides, both the Senate
and the House, for a spirit of real cooperation there.
   Now, this is important legislation in terms of driving that
deficit down, so that worked out well. The legislative session _ I
got some, not all, of what I wanted. But it ended up in a good
spirit. And I told the leaders _ leaders of the House right after
midnight, and the leaders of the Senate about 3:00 or 4:00 this
morning _ that I thanked them for what they did.
   In terms of the Lebanon, we are distressed about the reported
killing of President Moawad. And it is a disgraceful terroristic
happening, if true _ and I want to say that because at this
juncture, though it looks to be true, we've not had final
confirmation. And I think it is a direct setback for the tripartite
efforts that were trying to bring peace to Lebanon.
   It is a disgraceful performance; it is condemned by the United
States of America and _ however, we must not let this brutal
killing stand in the way of trying to bring peace to this troubled
corner of the world. And I would like to offer the help of America
for the officials there, the Prime Minister and others, to bring
these killers to justice. And it's hard to do that in that part of
the world, but I think all people of conscience will want to join
us in trying to not only bring those to justice who were
responsible for this killing, but in a broader sense, to help the
peace process in Lebanon.
   And then the third subject I want to comment on is the Salvador
guerrillas coming into areas with civilian populations, terrorists
themselves in my view, coming in and taking over a hotel. This
morning, Lebanese _ I mean, Salvadoran special operation forces
joined by U.S. elements, special operations, went through that
hotel, and I can tell you that I'm very pleased that all the
Americans have been released and there was no loss of life in this
sweep this morning as that hotel was liberated with finality from
the clutches of these outrageous guerrilla attacks.
   Q: Mr. President, can you tell us, were any of the Salvadorans
killed? Any of the rebels killed this morning in that?
   Bush: In that sweep of the hotel? No. Apparently not.
   Q: Can you explain what elements of U.S. troops were involved?
Were they sent down _
   Bush: Special operations forces.
   Q: Were they sent from Ft. Bragg?
   Bush: There were _ I can't _ I'll leave others to tell you about
where they came from, but they were our special operations. And
when you have _
   Q: Does the army have a base there?
   Bush: No _ that I sent down there. And when you see Americans
held hostage like this, there's a message in all of this. This
President, backed by our Defense Secretary, is going to protect the
lives of Americans wherever we can, and go to any end we can to
protect the lives of American citizens. And so _ it all worked out
and I'm very pleased. We moved rapidly. We had a very good orderly
process that resulted in our being able to do this.
   Q: What, beyond the events of this morning, what kind of
military, further military assistance are you going to give to
Cristiani's government, because of the situation still going on in
the capital with the _
   Bush: Well, he hasn't asked for any further military assistance.
He knows that we support his government. It was, after all,
democratically, freely elected. And then you have a handful of
Marxist guerrillas that are being financed by heaven knows who, but
they are out of step with the changes that are taking place in the
world. And we must not stand by and fail to support a country
that's moved down democracy's path, and we're going to do it.
   Q: Does that mean that you are prepared then, if he asks, to
send some, something other than advisors?
   Bush: Your question is too hypothetical. I don't answer
hypothetical questions like that.
   Q: How close did you come to canceling this trip today to stay
in Washington?
   Bush: I didn't come close at all. I _ you know, had I _ had
there been some emergency situation that was _ looked like it
needed management from the White House, I would have stayed there,
but that's not the fact. So it really _ we felt _ we have felt
that's been reasonably well under control. My main concern being
safety of American citizens.
   Q: Was there any fighting this morning during the sweep?
   Bush: I haven't heard any report of any. Oh, you mean not during
the sweep of the hotel? No.

<HEAD>Jury Exonerates Woman Who Killed Abusive, Drunken Husband</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONG BEACH, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A woman has been acquitted of killing
her husband on a day he began drinking at 7 a.m., assaulted her
three children and told her: ``It's time to get rid of you.''
   Robin Elson, 28, didn't deny she shot her husband, unemployed
auto mechanic Jack Elson, on Dec. 17, 1988. Elson, 44, died of
wounds to the back.
   But the jury agreed Tuesday with her lawyer, Lynda Vitale, that
it was self-defense after 6{ years of beatings and abuse.
   Court clerk Allyn Mattox's voice choked with emotion when she
read the verdict. And Elson embraced Vitale, tears streaming down
their faces, while tears filled the eyes of most people in the
court.
   The three-week trial focused on the so-called battered wife
syndrome.
   Psychologist Nancy Kaser-Boyd said during nearly three days of
testimony that women often endure abuse because they become afraid
to leave, feel helpless, have low self-esteem and limited resources.
   Testimony revealed that while Elson had been beaten by her
husband in the past, the day he died was worse than usual.
   He had been drinking since about 7 a.m. He beat and choked
stepdaughter Renee, now 11; kicked and punched son Camrin, 3; and
harassed son Brock, 1.
   He turned a hose full-force on the family's pet dog and threw
the animal three times onto the roof of their home in East Long
Beach.
   That afternoon, he told his wife he felt suicidal, accused her
of being a poor mother and said: ``It's time to get rid of you.''
   He forced her to point his rifle at him as part of what he
called a self-defense lesson, poking the gun in her chest when she
refused to learn. When the ``lesson'' ended, he put the rifle on
the living room floor and said: ``It's hot and ready to go.''
   Elson said that in her mind, that meant he was going to kill her
and the children.
   She said she later went back into the living room, picked up the
gun and shot her husband. He was hit twice in the back. A medical
examiner's report said he had a blood alcohol level of 0.16.
   Deputy District Attorney Tom Holmes questioned the jury's
decision.
   ``The rules regarding self-defense do not permit this kind of
result,'' Holmes said. ``There has to be an imminent danger of
great bodily harm or injury. This simply was not a correct
verdict.''
   Juror Susan Jepsen said, ``I really hope women learn from this
not to let it go this far.''

<TEXT>WASHINGTON: hotel. No?    Q: Given your strong words about protecting
Americans abroad through use of force if necessary, what about the hostages
in the Lebanon?    Bush: Show me where they are, and then we'll see what
we can do.    Q: People in Lebanon responsible for the killing today?
What can we do? Are we planning something _    Bush: Again, it's very
hard because you're dealing with international terror, or perhaps domestic
terror. You are dealing with cowardice. You are dealing with car bombs.
You are dealing with this cowardly way of trying to effect political change.
And so it is extraordinarily difficult. We certainly will offer whatever
intelligence we might come by, and I expect the French and tripartite countries
and others will do the same thing. But there is no specific plan of action
at this moment, because, as I say, we haven't even confirmed with finality
that the President has been killed, although it looks very bad.    Q:
Back on El Salvador, what is your opinion of the government going into
in and virtually raiding churches and arresting church people and accusing
them of being in sympathy with the rebels? These are church people of different
faiths that are down there and have been working with the poor.    Bush:
If they have not been harboring the guerrilla forces, if there is
no _ no participation in this _ in this war against the FMLN, then I would
condemn it totally. Certainly, killing of priests, what _ how _ whoever
does it _ is condemned by the United States, and I have offered help to
Cristiani. He has accepted some, what we've offered, in order to bring
these killers to justice. But no matter who killed them, what element killed
them. So I would condemn that kind of behavior on any quarter. It simply
cannot be. I would also urge that there be no harboring of fugitives or
of soldiers of the, the, whatever camp. And we can't have that.    Q:
Were you up all night, sir?    Bush: Well, I got awakened a couple of
times.    Q: (inaudible) -- saying about the operation, and to what extent
thre were rebels in the hotel --    Bush: No. Not up all night on this,
no.    Q: Pardon?    Bush: Not up all night on this.    Q: Oh, I see.
   Bush: Up all night waiting to hear from the senators whether the conference
had gone home.    Q: But when the special forces -- (inaudible)
-- were there numbers of FMLN troops still in the hotel, or had they fled?
   Bush: That is a little murky still.    Q: (inaudible) _ whether they
actually freed anyone, or just went in and _    Bush: They just left the
hotel to be sure there were no mines, went through there anticipating that
there might be opposition forces.    Q: Was there any resistance when
our people and the    Salvadorans went through the hotel?    Bush: No,
I don't think there was. I think it was placid. And the problem was that
the United States' people _ it was not felt that they could come out of
there, given the fact that the hotel might have been booby-trapped or mined.
And there was a murky situation on who was there, and who wasn't there,
whether there was guerrilla forces there or not. But all I know is we have
specially trained forces. They are trained to do this kind of a mission.
They were put on alert, they were sent, and they performed their mission.
And, thank God, they didn't have to fire a shot.    Q:Are they still there,
or?    Bush: Sure.    Q: (inaudible) in the hotel?    Bush: I don't
know that yet.

<HEAD>Soldiers Wound 12 Palestinians, Accused Collaborator Killed</HEAD>
<DATELINE>JERUSALEM (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Israeli soldiers shot and wounded at least 12
Palestinians in clashes during a general strike Wednesday and
masked Palestinian assailants fatally stabbed a 70-year-old man
they accused of helping Israel, Arab reports said.
   Palestinian journalists said the alleged collaborator, Muhammed
Mustafa Nazal, was killed in the occupied West Bank town of Jenin
by four masked Palestinians. The journalists said without
elaboration that Nazal carried an Israeli-licensed weapon.
   He was the 148th Palestinian killed by fellow Arabs during the
23-month-old uprising against Israeli rule in the occupied
territories. Most were suspected collaborators, but some were
killed for ``moral offenses'' such as prostitution, which is viewed
by Moslem radicals as undermining the rebellion.
   At least 615 Palestinians have died of Israeli gunfire in the
revolt, and 42 Israelis also have been killed.
   In stone-throwing clashes in the occupied lands, Israeli troops
shot and wounded at least 12 Palestinians, including seven in the
occupied Gaza Strip's Shati refugee camp, Arab hospital officials
said. The army command confirmed one wounded.
   State Israel radio reported an Israeli man from the West Bank
settlement of Efrat was slightly injured by stones thrown at his
car near the Dheisheh refugee camp in the Bethlehem area. Moshe
Dvir suffered skull injuries and underwent surgery at Hadassah
Hospital.
   The confrontations came as businesses and transportation in the
occupied territories were paralyzed by a general strike ordered by
the Moslem fundamentalist movement Hamas, Arabic for ``zeal.''
   Hamas said the strike was in solidarity with Palestinians jailed
by the Israeli authorities. The group's elderly leader, Sheik Ahmed
Yassin, and some 200 members are in jail awaiting trial on charges
that include murder of Arabs, assistance in the killing of two
Israeli soldiers and other security offenses.
   According to army figures, 9,101 Palestinians were jailed as of
Nov. 14, including 1,735 held in administrative detention, a
procedure allowing imprisonment for up to one year without trial.
   In the West Bank town of Ramallah, the body of an unidentified
Arab man was found at a garbage dump Wednesday, area police
spokesman Mordechai Bareket said. He said the man was apparently
murdered.
   Arab reporters said the man was apparently stabbed to death and
his body was then burned beyond recognition. The reason for the
killing was unclear.

   U.N. chief Javier Perez de Cuellar, President Bush and other
leaders worldwide denounced the killing Wednesday of President Rene
Mouawad of Lebanon but hoped Lebanese could transcend the ``dark
shadow'' it cast on the region.
   The U.N. General Assembly and the French Parliament held a
moment of silence and Syria declared seven days of mourning for
Mouawad, who was killed in Beirut by a remote-control bomb minutes
after marking Lebanon's Independence Day.
   ``Those who perpetrated this abominable crime are the enemies of
Lebanon's unity,'' Syrian President Hafez Assad said in a telegram
to Lebanese parliament Speaker Hussein Husseini. He said the
assassination should trigger ``a new impulse to double support for
Lebanon so it can destroy the evil in its nest.''
   Saudi Arabia, which played a key role in brokering the Taif
peace pact for Lebanon, expressed its sorrow in a statement by the
official Saudi Press Agency that was monitored in Cyprus.
   The statement called the murder a ``beastly and wanton act,''
saying Saudis shared the grief of the Lebanese people and ``asked
God to help them overcome this painful event so that Lebanon may
live in peace again.''
   ``Saudi Arabia will spare no effort in the quest for restoring
security and stability in Lebanon,'' the statement added.
   The Syrian News Agency blamed the killing on Lebanese Christian
army Gen. Michel Aoun, who did not recognize Mouawad's 17-day
administration. Aoun denied responsibility.
   Bush called it a ``disgraceful, terroristic happening'' and
pledged U.S. assistance for efforts to end Lebanon's 14-year civil
war.
   ``We must not let this brutal killing stand in the way of trying
to bring peace to the troubled corner of the world,'' Bush said on
Air Force One en route to Memphis, Tenn. ``I would like to offer
the help of America ... to bring these killers to justice.''
   Perez de Cuellar called Mouawad ``a Lebanese patriot who assumed
his responsibility in full knowledge of the dangers and challenges
involved and for this he earned widespread admiration and respect.''
   The U.N. chief said it was especially tragic that the slaying
should have taken place on Lebanon's national day ``and at a time
when there was hope that such acts of violence which have plagued
the country for so long were things of the past.''
   Mouawad, 64, had promised to enact a Arab League peace plan to
end the civil war.
   The U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, Thomas R. Pickering,
said the Mouawad's courage ``should strengthen the resolve of all
Lebanese, as well as of the Arab League, in their efforts to ...
restore the unity and territorial integrity and independence of
Lebanon.''
   The Arab League's U.N. envoy, Clovis Maksoud, said he hoped and
expected the Lebanese Parliament to convene as soon as possible,
perhaps within 24 hours, to elect a new president to fill the
vacuum.
   ``I hope this tragic development will jolt everyone to recover
Lebanese sovereignty, independence, institutions and reform,'' said
Maksoud. ``This is a cruel interruption in the process for peace
and reconciliation in Lebanon, but it is not a breakdown.''
   The official Jordan News Agency said the kingdom expressed
``deep and great sorrow,'' and an official Jordanian spokesman told
the agency:
   ``This murder, which is considered a Lebanese and an Arab
tragedy, has thrown a dark shadow over the whole region.''
   A Foreign Ministry statement in Cairo said ``Egypt strongly
condemns this criminal, terrorist act and calls on the Lebanese
people to hold on to their unity and put aside their differences at
this difficult time.''
   Avi Pazner, a spokesman for Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak
Shamir, said the killing of Mouawad ``is new proof that Israel must
take all measures necessary to assure its security.''
   In France, National Assembly deputies held a moment of silence
after hearing the news of Moawad's death.
   ``I am overwhelmed by this murder that cost President Moawad his
life,'' Edwige Avice, a junior minister in the French Foreign
Ministry, told the assembly.
   The Belgian government said in a communique that Belgium
``condemned in the strongest manner the assassination of a Lebanese
politician who was well known for his moderation, and feels that
this attack imperils the re-establishment of legality in a country
which has already suffered too much.''

<HEAD>West Is Fair But East Gets Snow And Rain</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Snow and rain, some of it heavy, fell across much of the eastern
half of the nation Wednesday, and more cold air swept across the
central part of the nation.
   Snow spread across much of the Ohio Valley during the afternoon,
coming from the Great Lakes region and from a storm system
developing over the Gulf Coast states.
   A mixture of snow, sleet and freezing rain made travel
treacherous in southern Ohio, the National Weather Service said.
   The storm system developing for the Gulf Coast states also
produced rain across much of the area from eastern Texas to the
southern and central Appalachian Mountains.
   Thunderstorms extended from southeastern Texas across central
Louisiana and central Mississippi.
   The heaviest rain during the six-hour period up to 1 p.m. EST
was 2.15 inches at Barksdale Air Force Base, near Shreveport, La.,
while 1.19 inches fell at Monroe, La.
   The storm over the central Gulf Coast was expected to track
toward the northeast during the night, spreading Thanksgiving Day
snow across parts of the middle Atlantic Coast region.
   Snow squalls were in parts of the upper Great Lakes during the
afternoon, and 4 to 6 inches of snow was reported in the Milwaukee
area.
   Light snow also fell across northern Illinois, with up to 2
inches reported in the Chicago area. Light snow also extended
across Iowa into eastern Nebraska and southeastern South Dakota.
   Fair weather prevailed across the western half of the country,
but dense fog developed from Tuesday into Wednesday in the
California valleys and in northern Utah, snarling airport traffic.
   Cold air spread across much of the central states, bringing an
end to several days of unseasonably warm weather, as northwesterly
wind gusting above 40 mph blew across the middle Mississippi Valley
and the central half of the Great Plains.
   Afternoon temperatures were generally in the teens from Upper
Michigan into the eastern Dakotas, with readings only in the single
digits in the Red River Valley on the border of Minnesota and North
Dakota.
   In the Northeast, Binghamton, N.Y., had a record low of just 10
degrees.
   Wednesday's low for the Lower 48 states was 4 degrees below zero
at Grand Forks, N.D.

   President Rene Mouawad was assassinated
Wednesday by a remote-controlled bomb that ripped through his
motorcade 17 days after he was elected with a mandate to try to end
Lebanon's civil war. Twenty-three others died in the thunderous
explosion.
   The murder dealt a crippling blow to an internationally
acclaimed peace accord brokered by the Arab League last month in a
bid to resolve the conflict that has killed more than 150,000
people in 14 years.
   U.N. Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar called it ``a day
of mourning for Lebanon, and a day of anger for the entire
international community.'' U.S. and other diplomats at the General
Assembly in New York begged the Lebanese people to adhere to the
peace plan.
   Police said thousands of people fled Beirut to safer areas
shortly after the bombing. Long lines of cars loaded with
mattresses, household goods and personal effects were seen heading
out of the capital in the evening.
   No group claimed responsibility for killing Mouawad, 64, a
Maronite Catholic.
   But pro-Syrian leftist factions blamed Christian army commander
Gen. Michel Aoun, who has been holding out against the peace pact
from his base in the Christian enclave north of Beirut. Aoun had
called Mouawad a ``Syrian lackey.''
   The murder raised fears of renewed warfare between Aoun's 20,000
mainly Christian troops and an alliance of the Syrian army and
leftist Moslem militias, unless Parliament quickly elects a
successor.
   An official statement said Mouawad will be buried Saturday in
his hometown of Zgorta, 45 miles north of Beirut in Syrian-policed
north Lebanon.
   Sources close to Prime Minister-designate Salim Hoss, requesting
anonymity, said legislators would probably hold a parliament
session in north Lebanon after the burial to elect a new head of
state.
   Hoss ordered a seven-day period of mourning.
   Police said 36 other people were wounded when the bomb, packed
with 550 pounds of dynamite, exploded in a small roadside shop on
the Rue de Rome in Moslem west Beirut as Mouawad's 10-car motorcade
passed at 1:45 p.m. (6:45 a.m. EST).
   The blast hurled the president's bulletproof blue Mercedes-Benz
across the two-lane boulevard, landing it upside-down in an empty
parking lot.
   Hoss, a Sunni Moslem, and Shiite Moslem parliament Speaker
Hussein Husseini, who were driving in separate limousines behind
the president, escaped unhurt.
   Aoun hastily convened his three-man interim Cabinet, then
denounced the killing as a ``loathsome crime.''
   Hoss, his voice shaking with emotion, said in a radio address:
   ``It is a national disaster. President Rene Mouawad was
assassinated by the treacherous hand of treason. He fell a martyr
of peace, a martyr of Lebanon's unity and national reconciliation.''
   Mouawad, a lawyer, became the second Lebanese president to be
assassinated since Lebanon gained independence from France.
   Bashir Gemayel, also a Maronite, was assassinated by a bomb
blast in Christian east Beirut on Sept. 14, 1982, three weeks after
he was elected. He was 34.
   Mouawad was elected president by Parliament Nov. 5 in a session
held at a remote air base in Syrian-policed north Lebanon, outside
the range of Aoun's artillery.
   He was entrusted with enforcing the peace accord, which
Parliament had approved Oct. 22 after 23 days of deliberations in
the Saudi Arabian resort of Taif under the auspices of the Arab
League.
   Mouawad designated Hoss to form a national reconciliation
government to implement the accord, which gives the Moslem majority
an equal share of power with the Christians.
   Hoss discussed the assassination and its impact on peacemaking
efforts in telephone contacts with King Fahd of Saudi Arabia, King
Hassan II of Morocco and Algerian President Chadli Bendjedid, said
Hoss adviser Samir Mansour.
   The three leaders make up the Arab League mediation committee
that sponsored the Taif accord, which provides for a phased pullout
of Syrian troops from major cities to redeploy in east Lebanon's
Bekaa Valley within two years.
   Aoun, whose troops fought six months of fierce artillery battles
with the Syrian army from March to September, insists on a
timetable for a total Syrian withdrawal.
   By police count, at least 930 people were killed and 2,744
wounded before an Arab league-sponsored cease-fire took hold Sept.
22.
   The Syrians have 40,000 troops controlling 70 percent of Lebanon
under a 1976 Arab League peacekeeping mandate.
   At the State Department in Washington, spokeswoman Margaret
Tutwiler condemned the slaying.
   The politicians were heading home from an Independence Day
ceremony in the Sanayeh district of Syrian-policed west Beirut when
the explosion rocked the city.
   Killed with Mouawad were six Syrian soldiers and eight Lebanese
troops and officers assigned to guard him, including his aide de
camp Col. Joseph Ramya, and nine civilians, three of them women,
police said.
   West Beirut's streets quickly emptied. Residents feared a new
outbreak of shelling duels.
   Mouawad is survived by his wife, Nayla, and two children,
23-year-old Rima, a law student in Paris, and 17-year-old Michel, a
high school senior also in Paris.

   President Bush said he was sending a message
abroad with his deployment of a highly secret U.S. commando unit in
El Salvador, but his public disclosure raised eyebrows at home as
well among officials normally barred from acknowledging such units
exist.
   ``We have specially trained forces. They are trained to do this
kind of mission. They were put on alert. They were sent and they
performed their mission and thank God they didn't have to fire a
shot,'' Bush said.
   ``He said that?'' exclaimed one Pentagon officer, shaking his
head in wonderment when told of Bush's comments. ``Well, I guess he
can. He's the commander-in-chief.''
   The U.S. troops Bush ordered to El Salvador did not enter the
hotel tower where 12 Green Berets had been under siege by leftist
rebels, and they left El Salvador without engaging in any rescue
attempt, military sources said.
   Bush dispatched two planeloads of special operations squads _
specially trained to conduct guerrilla warfare, counter-terrorist
operations and hostage rescues _ and they were positioned near the
hotel, one administration official said, commenting on condition he
not be named.
   But the soldiers never went into action because the leftist
rebels left during the night, White House and other officials said.
   Bush said that the hotel ``was liberated with finality'' with
the help of the special unit and that it had swept the hotel for
mines or lurking guerrillas. Later, however, White House spokesman
Marlin Fitzwater issued a statement saying, ``Updated information
showed U.S. forces did not actually enter the hotel. Entry proved
to be unnecessary.''
   Still, Bush said, giving prominent mention to Defense Secretary
Dick Cheney, the message of the day was: ``This president, backed
by our defense secretary, will stand to protect the lives of
Americans where we can.''
   Bush and Cheney worked hand-in-hand to plan the U.S. military
action in order to avoid any of the communications glitches that
occurred during the failed coup attempt last month against
Panamanian Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega, several Pentagon sources
said.
   ``Cheney was back and forth to the White House. They were in
constant touch,'' said one senior official.
   After Bush's comments on the special troops, officials confirmed
that the units _ numbering somewhat less than 200 men _ dispatched
to the scene were from the U.S. Special Operations Command, which
is centered in Fort Bragg, N.C.
   ``These are the snake-eaters. The covert operations guys,'' said
one administration official familiar with their training. ``But
they're not glory boys. They just do their job, and don't get the
credit.''
   The ``special operations'' units sometimes known to the public
as the Delta Force grew out of the 1980 hostage-rescue attempt in
Iran during the Carter administration. These units may use
specialized Air Force transport teams and Navy divers.
   Overall, the Special Operations Command set up in 1987 under a
congressional mandate totals 35,000 active, reserve and national
guard personnel organized in a variety of units, said Col. Tom
Jones, spokesman for the command at Fort Bragg.
   In contrast, the 12 men that were inside the hotel are part of
the Green Berets, the ``Special Forces'' units also based in Fort
Bragg.
   The dozen men had been on a two-week training mission in El
Salvador and were scheduled to return to the United States on
Tuesday, the day the hotel was besieged by the rebels.
   The mission of the Green Berets is unchanged from their days in
Vietnam, when they trained troops in foreign countries to fight for
themselves.
   The first group was formed, and then deactivated during World
War II. They found a special patron in President Kennedy, who built
their numbers and authorized their specialized headgear, which had
been banned in the Army.

<HEAD>Dubcek Attends Dissident's Trial in Czechoslovakia</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Alexander Dubcek, leader of
communist Czechoslovakia when Soviet tanks crushed the Prague
Spring reforms in 1968, attended the trial of dissident Jan
Carnogursky on Wednesday.
   His being allowed to attend was unusual, as was state
television's briefly showing Dubcek at the Palace of Justice for
the morning session.
   The trial for sedition and subversion began Monday. Carnogursky,
a Roman Catholic activist and human rights campaigner, faces up to
10 years in jail if convicted. He is being tried on the basis of
one article written for a Bratislava underground monthly and a
statement signed with four other activists in August.
   Outside the palace, Dubcek briefly addressed a crowd of several
thousand people and was cheered when he said he agreed with them
that the charges against Carnogursky are unfair, witnesses reported.
   Dubcek was taking advantage of fast-moving developments here
marked by mass protests throughout the nation. Czechoslovakia's
early attempts at far-reaching political and economic reforms under
Dubcek were put down by a Soviet-led Warsaw Pact invasion in August
1968.
   The crowd thinned to about 200 around noon. They prayed and sang
Catholic songs, including one titled, ``They'll Know We Are
Christians by Our Love.''
   In the afternoon, about 15,000 pro-democracy demonstrators
gathered at the court site for a peaceful protest rally. Police did
not interfere.
   According to a Western reporter who attended the court session,
Carnogursky _ a lawyer barred from practice _ told the court it
cannot be subversive to tell the truth and his activities were
Christian in character rather than political.
   Four other activists were detained with Carnogursky on Aug. 14.
Unlike Carnogursky, they were released until their trial began on
Nov.14.
   One, Slovak rights activist Miroslav Kusy, received an 8-month
suspended sentence after being found guilty of ``harming state
interests abroad.''
   The three others _ Hana Ponicka, Anton Selecky and Vladimir
Manak _ were acquitted of sedition charges.
   People held up tiny crosses on Wednesday as they waited for
information on the Carnogursky trial.
   The crowd burst into chants of ``Freedom, freedom!'' as one
speaker called for the release of Carnogurksy.
   Police blocked off the area but did not intervene.

   Federal engineers have intensified an
investigation of possible defects in the anti-lock brake system of
the Jaguar XJ6, which consumers have blamed for five accidents, the
government said Wednesday.
   The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration also
announced stepped-up probes of electrical short circuits in some
Ford Taurus and Thunderbird models, faulty safety belts in
Chevrolet Camaros and Pontiac Firebirds and brake problems in BMWs.
   The agency said it was upgrading the investigations from
preliminary evaluations, which involve mostly paperwork, to
engineering analyses, in which engineers study the possibly
defective parts. If evidence of widespread problems is found,
recalls could be ordered.
   The agency discontinued investigations of reported throttle
control problems in 1986 and 1987 GM Oldsmobile Delta 88s and Buick
Le Sabres.
   Also discontinued were engineering analyses of stalling problems
in the Chrysler 1987-88 Jeep and sudden acceleration in the 1985
through 1988 Oldsmobile 98, Buick Electra and Cadillac Fleetwood.
   In its monthly report on defect investigations, the agency said
it was studying an estimated 38,315 Jaguar XJ6 models with
anti-lock brake systems.
   There have been 56 complaints of failures in the electronically
controlled brakes. This means the driver has to apply more pressure
than usual to slow the car. The problem has been blamed for five
accidents, one of which involved an injury, the agency said.
   Jaguar spokesman Mike Cook declined to comment, saying the
automaker had not seen the report.
   Engineers also will probe 58 complaints of short circuits in the
power seats of the 1987 and 1988 Ford Taurus and Thunderbird, of
which an estimated 549,084 are on the road. Consumers have linked
the problem to 16 fires.
   The Camaro and Firebird complaint involves 1984 through 1987
models, of which 1.5 million are on the road. There have been 136
complaints of the plastic buckle cover disintegrating and jamming
the latch. The problem has been blamed for nine injuries and one
death.
   Another 182 complaints have been received about 1985 through
1987 models BMWs with anti-lock brakes, about 185,000 of which are
in use. Sticking valves are believed to be keeping the brakes from
releasing. One accident and an injury have been linked to the
problem.
   An engineering analysis also was begun of 668 complaints of
steering loss resulting from ball joint wear in General Motors
Corp. light trucks from 1988 and 1989. An estimated 1.2 million are
on the road. Four accidents and two injuries have been reported.
   The agency also opened prelminary evaluations of:
   _Five complaints of fuel leaks, including three that caused
fires, in Chrysler cars with turbo-chargers manufactured between
1984 and 1989.
   _Nineteen complaints of excessive steering wheel vibrations in
an estimated 100,000 Hyundai Excels from 1987 through 1989. One
accident and one injury have been reported.
   _Cruise control failure in 1984 through 1987 models of the Buick
Regal and the Oldsmobile Cutlass Supreme, of which 420,000 are on
the road.

<HEAD>Denver Begins Construction on Nation's First Major Airport in 15

   Transportation Secretary Samuel Skinner on
Wednesday helped Colorado officials celebrate the long-awaited
construction of the nation's first new major airport in 15 years.
   Skinner joined Federal Aviation Administration chief James
Busey, Gov. Roy Romer, Denver Mayor Federico Pena and other
Colorado dignitaries who had a hand in the battle for the new
Denver International Airport on the rolling plains northeast of
Denver. It will replace cramped Stapleton International Airport.
   The airport, which could boost the number of jobs in the Denver
area by more than 20,000, is being touted as one solution to a
projected national air-transportation crush that is already causing
congestion and delays.
   ``You'll be putting in place today, in the next few years, a
facility that will help not only Colorado but our nation,'' Skinner
said.
   Busey said the new airport will ``reduce delays here and at
major airports throughout the nation.''
   Stapleton, one of the major hubs for Continental and United
airlines, is the fifth busiest airport in the United States.
Projections for the new airport would make it second only to
Chicago's O'Hare in the next 20 years. It is expected to open in
1993.
   Heavy equipment has been moving earth on the airport site for
several weeks prior to Wednesday's ceremony, which featured a
marching band from Denver's public schools and a flyover by
military jets.
   The new airport, beset by controversy since planning started
more than 15 years ago, is expected to cost $2.3 billion and will
be largest single public works project in the history of Colorado.
It on 45 square miles of land the city is buying from Adams County,
10 miles northeast of Stapleton.
   The project is the nation's first major airport construction
since 1974, when the Dallas-Fort Worth airport was completed.
   President Bush on Tuesday signed into law the fiscal 1990
transportation appropriations bill, which includes $40 million for
the first purchases of air traffic control equipment for the
airport.
   Funding for the project got a kick-start last month when Skinner
earmarked $60 million in fiscal 1989 discretionary funds to begin
construction.
   In May 1988, Adams County residents voted to allow Denver to
annex the land needed for the airport. But a snag in the plan
appeared last January when some lawmakers pushed an alternative
plan to expand Stapleton onto the adjacent Rocky Mountain Arsenal.
   Pena turned the issue over to the Denver electorate, which voted
in May in favor of the new airport site.
   Proponents of the airport say it will boost the Denver and
Colorado economies by creating 2,500 construction jobs immediately
and 20,000 fulltime jobs eventually. They also say the airport will
create $5.1 billion in additional business revenue pear year and
draw domestic and international businesses to Colorado.
   An FAA report early this year estimated a new airport could
reduce delays at Denver by about 90 percent. An estimated 32
million to 34 million passengers are expected to use Stapleton in
the year 2000, compared with 16.1 million in 1987, the FAA report
said.

   The low-rated ``USA Today On TV'' series, begun
at a cost of $40 million as a video cousin of the USA Today
newspaper, got the ax on Wednesday. Its final broadcast will be on
Jan. 8.
   The show's demise had been expected.
   The syndicated weekday series premiered in a blaze of publicity
in September 1988 on 156 statons. Then called ``USA Today: The
Television Show,'' the series had four anchors, short stories, a
fast pace and a busy assortment of high-tech graphics.
   The format was widely booed by TV critics, who complained that
the stories were too short and too often inane.
   A new name, several format changes, three executive producers
and 14 months later, the end was announced. The decision will
affect only 84 stations. The others already had pulled the plug.
   The series currently has two anchors, Bill Macatee and Beth
Ruyak. The latter co-anchors the show's one-hour weekend edition
with Boyd Matson. The executive producer is Jack Hurley. The show
has a staff of about 150.
   Created by Steve Friedman, former executive producer of NBC's
top-rated ``Today'' show, the half-hour program originates from
Rossyln, Va., near Washington, D.C. It is produced by GTG East,
part of GTG Entertainment, a joint venture of former NBC board
chairman Grant Tinker and the Gannett Co.
   In a joint statement Wednesday, Tinker and John Curley,
Gannett's chairman and president, said they were proud of the
show's quality and standards, although ``obviously disappointed''
that the series ``didn't attract a wider audience.''
   A GTG spokesman in New York declined to elaborate on their
statement.
   However, the show's declining ratings and reduced roster of
stations were definite factors.
   In its first week, the show and its weekend edition had an 8.1
rating. In the latest available A.C. Nielsen Co. ratings, for the
week ending Nov. 12, the weekday show averaged a 2.9 rating.
   Each ratings point represents 921,000 homes.
   ``USA Today On TV,'' in a category that TV executives call
``reality'' programming, was the second such syndicated series to
be cancelled this season. The first was Orion Entertainment's
``Crimewatch Tonight.''

the disclosure of classified information, stepped into the
Iran-Contra case of a former CIA station chief Wednesday in an
unprecedented move that could scuttle the case.
   Acting at the request of U.S. intelligence agencies, Attorney
General Dick Thornburgh filed the unprecedented national security
declaration that could lead to dismissal of charges against Joseph
Fernandez, who assisted Oliver North's secret Contra resupply
network in 1985 and 1986.
   However, Thornburgh said in a statement that ``further judicial
examination of the rulings which cause me to enter this declaration
will establish the potential for accommodating both the defendant's
rights and the national security interests at stake, thereby
allowing this case to be tried to conclusion.''
   Fernandez is accused of lying about his activities to the Tower
Commission and the CIA inspector general.
   Thornburgh said evidence Fernandez plans to use in his defense
would cause ``serious damage to the national security of the United
States.''
   But independent counsel Lawrence Walsh said ``we deplore''
Thornburgh's action because it protects ``fictional secrets.''
   ``We are disappointed'' that the declaration ``is extremely
broad'' and blocks the disclosure of ``information that is
generally known to the public,'' said associate independent counsel
Laurence Shtasel, the prosecutor in the Fernandez case.
   ``An important prosecution is at stake,'' Shtasel said. ``Joseph
Fernandez is the highest-ranking CIA official ever indicted.''
   U.S. District Court Judge Claude Hilton scheduled another court
session Friday morning, giving prosecutors time to propose ways of
preserving portions of the two obstruction and two false statement
charges against Fernandez.
   Hilton will decide whether some or all of the criminal charges
must be dismissed, a decision that could be appealed.
   Fernandez's lawyer, Thomas Wilson, said the ``sword of
Damocles'' had been hanging over his client's head for three years
and that Hilton should dismiss the case now that the declaration
has been filed.
   Shtasel declined to say whether the declaration makes the case
untriable.
   On July 24, the judge said Fernandez must be allowed to present
in his defense details concerning CIA programs in Costa Rica and
the locations of agency stations in Honduras and El Salvador as
well as the location of a third CIA Latin American facility.
   That prompted the Justice Department to seek to appeal Hilton's
ruling to the U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Richmond, Va. That
court said only Walsh's office had the power to appeal.
   Prosecutors had proposed referring to the CIA facilities by
number and dropping a portion of one count so the CIA projects in
Costa Rica wouldn't have to be mentioned, but Hilton said that
would not satisfactorily protect Fernandez's right to a fair trial.
   One of the CIA projects Thornburgh is protecting involves U.S.
efforts to improve the effectiveness of Costa Rica's defense
forces, according to court papers. A second involves a
sophisticated communications station to bolster Costa Rica's
security and a third deals with Nicaraguan nationals in Costa Rica.
   The last project was designed to enhance Costa Rica's
preparation for a possible attack by Nicaragua.
   One of the charges against Fernandez is that he lied when he
said the construction of an airstrip in Costa Rica was an
initiative by that country's government.
   In another Iran-Contra-related case, U.S. District Court Judge
Harold Greene said Wednesday that Rep. Lee Hamilton, D-Ind., is
among the anticipated prosecution witnesses in the trial of former
national security adviser John Poindexter.
   Greene made the disclosure in an order scheduling a Dec. 4
pre-trial hearing.
   Hamilton was chairman of the House intelligence committee during
the Iran-Contra affair and his testimony at Poindexter's trial,
scheduled to begin Jan. 22, could figure in four of the five
criminal charges in the case.
   Hamilton made inquiries at the White House in 1986 about
possible improper activities by North.
   Poindexter is accused of obstructing Congress, making false
statements to Hamilton's committee and conspiracy.

   Several Argentine deputies
introduced a bill Wednesday to bring home the remains of leftist
guerrilla Ernesto ``Che'' Guevara, although his body has never been
found.
   Guevara, a charismatic Argentine doctor who fought with Fidel
Castro in Cuba and returned to South America to foment revolution,
was slain by soldiers in the jungles of Bolivia in October 1967.
   ``Guevara was a combatant for freedom in Latin America, whether
or not we agree with his political ideal,'' said a communique
signed by members of the small Socialist Party and the Radical
Civic Union, the country's second-largest party after the governing
Peronists.
   The deputies said they did not know where Guevara's remains are
but that presumably they are near the Bolivian town of Higueras,
where he was shot to death.
   Che remains a cult figure to many leftists throughout Latin
America, with his bearded likeness adorning T-shirts, posters and
even the mudguards of trucks.

<HEAD>City Party Chief Ousted Amid Charges of Incompetence</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Communist Party leaders in Leningrad accused
officials of incompetence and sacked their party chief in the
aftermath of embarrassing multi-candidate elections earlier this
year, Tass reported Wednesday.
   Boris Gidaspov, head of the regional party committee, was named
head of a unified city and regional party structure at a meeting of
party leaders, the official news agency reported. It did not say
what would become of the sacked party chief, Anatoly Gerasimov.
   Tass said discussion at the Leningrad party meeting was ``sharp
and open.''
   ``Open accusations of indecisiveness, incompetence, trying to
avoid decision of contemporary problems were addressed to many
party and government leaders,'' Tass said.
   Gidaspov was elected four months ago to lead the Leningrad
regional party organization after its surprising defeat in the
March multi-candidate elections to the Congress of People's
Deputies parliament.
   He replaced Yuri F. Solovyev, a candidate member of the ruling
Politburo who was defeated even though he had no opposition. He
failed to receive 50 percent of the vote.
   The move in Leningrad, the Soviet Union's second most populous
city, came a day after the party organization in Moscow replaced
its head, Politburo member Lev N. Zaikov.
   Party spokesmen said Zaikov had been promoted to first deputy
chairman of the Defense Council, a Kremlin group headed by
President Mikhail S. Gorbachev.
   Local party organizations will be facing local elections over
the next several months and are trying to restructure themselves to
avoid similar defeats to those they suffered in March.

<HEAD>Judge Upholds Ruling that Justice Department Stole Software</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES ROWLEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A federal judge Wednesday upheld a bankruptcy
court's 1987 finding that the Justice Department used fraud and
deceit to steal software from a computer company.
   U.S. District Judge William B. Bryant rejected the Justice
Department's appeal of the earlier ruling by then-Bankruptcy Judge
George Bason Jr.
   Bason had awarded $6.79 million plus attorneys fees to Inslaw
Inc. the computer company that has since emerged from bankruptcy.
   Bryant reduced the award by $655,200 but upheld Bason's finding
that through ``trickery, fraud and deceit,'' the Justice Department
stole enhancements to a word-processing system for U.S. attorneys
offices that were developed by Inslaw.
   Bryant also upheld Bason's conclusion that the department never
negotiated in good faith to settle Inslaw's claims it owned the
software enhancements.
   ``Once the software was in the possession of DOJ, there is no
evidence that the government ever negotiated in good faith,''
Bryant wrote.
   ``By failing to acknowledge or accept Inslaw's claims, the
government continued its fraudulent behavior toward Inslaw. This
behavior persisted long after Inslaw filed for reorganization''
under Chapter 11 of the bankruptcy code, Bryant noted.
   Justice Department spokesman Amy Brown said agency lawyers were
studying the opinion.
   Inslaw accuses the Justice Department of driving it into
bankruptcy by allowing the official who oversaw the contact, C.
Madison Brewer, to wage a personal vendetta.
   Bryant upheld Bason's finding that Inslaw was the victim of
animosity displayed by Brewer and other officials of the department.
   ``What is strikingly apparent from the testimony and depositions
of key witnesses and many documents is that Inslaw performed its
contract in a hostile environment that extended from the higher
echelons of the Justice Department to the officials who hasd the
day-to-day responsibility for supervising its work,'' Bryant said.
   Bryant also found the Justice Department violated the automatic
stay of bankruptcy proceedings by installing the enhanced computer
system in 45 U.S. attorneys offices.
   Bryant also rejected government claims that Bason was biased
against the department because he was not reappointed to another
term as bankruptcy judge.
   But the judge reduced the award by $655,200. The amount
represented 12 percent of the company's license fee that was to
cover maintenance of the software.
   Bryant said the Justice Department should not have to pay for
services that Inslaw did not perform.
   Nancy Hamilton, the company's vice president and wife of founder
William Hamilton, said the decision means ``Bason has been
vindicated. I think it's a little hard to say that two judges are
biased.''
   ``We think right now this decision is pretty important and
pretty difficult for the Justice Department to ignore,'' she said.
   The company emerged from bankruptcy last year after receiving a
$2.5 million loan from IBM, Mrs. Hamilton said. The company will
continue its lawsuit to obtain punitive damages against the Justice
Department.

   The four-day Thanksgiving weekend began with some
tricky driving conditions over much of the Eastern half of the
nation.
   The National Weather Service said Wednesday evening that
snowstorms were scattered over the Southeast, mid-Atlantic states,
the Appalachians, the Ohio Valley and sections of the Great Lakes
states.
   The National Safety Council projected before the bad weather
struck that from 400 to 500 motorists could be killed between 6
p.m. Wednesday and midnight Sunday.
   Last year, there were 438 traffic deaths during the four-day
Thanksgiving observance.
   The worst Thanksgiving period was in 1965 when 720 traffic
deaths were reported.

   A fire roared through two downtown homes
early Wednesday, killing five children and one woman, authorities
said.
   Three firefighters and at least three residents, two of whom
leaped from a second-floor window to escape the flames, were
hospitalized after the 12:37 a.m. blaze. Two more firefighters were
treated at a hospital and released, fire officials said.
   ``This is difficult to take. It's hard to deal with when you see
babies burned up,'' said Lt. Gregory M. Lee, a fire division
investigator.
   Lee identified the dead as Brenda Paas, 26, and her three
children, Joshua, 5, Jeremy, 3, and Kristi, 20 months, all of whom
lived in one side of a duplex; Aaron Jay Bragg, 3, of Waverly, a
visitor staying in the other side of the duplex; and 10-month-old
Carrlisa Erin Madowsky, who lived in a house next door.
   Michelle Madowsky, 17, the mother of the infant, was in serious
condition at the Ohio State University Hospital burn unit, hospital
spokesman David Crawford said.
   Noah Bragg, 28, and his wife, Dawn, 21, leaped from the rear
window of the duplex and were both in fair-to-good condition at St.
Anthony Mercy Hospital, spokeswoman Marlene Broseman said.
   Mrs. Paas' husband, David Paas, said the couple were asleep on
their couch on the ground floor and awoke to find it burning.
   ``I tried to get (the couch) out but got stuck in the door,''
Paas said in a telephone interview. ``The electricity was out and
the smoke was so thick I couldn't get back in.''
   Lee said trying to move the burning couch outdoors was a serious
mistake.
   ``The first thing you must do is try to get people out. That was
not done. They had three babies upstairs.'' Lee said.
   Investigators said the cause of the fire had not been determined.

   About 1,000 people visited a new exhibit on the
sixth floor of the former Texas School Book Depository on
Wednesday, the 26th anniversary of the day that President John F.
Kennedy was shot from one of its windows.
   Across the street at Dealey Plaza, many stopped to read the
memorial of Kennedy's assassination and to gaze at the downward
slope of Elm Street, where the president's motorcade had passed.
   Some visitors recalled how the president's death changed their
lives.
   ``It was a gray cloud over Dallas for such a long time. I think
it's an event that needs to be remembered but not dwelled upon,''
said Ron Thompson, 34, a lifelong Dallas resident who said this was
his first visit to Dealey Plaza.
   He was in third grade when Kennedy died.
   ``It was a strange day. I was in school and all of a sudden
everybody was crying. I was real young but still it was something
else,'' Thompson said.
   Wet weather kept early visitors from Dealey Plaza, but by
mid-morning about 70 tourists and Dallas residents had stopped.
   ``We had to stop here,'' said Max Ooley of Borden, Ind., who was
traveling with his wife to visit their son in San Antonio for the
Thanksgiving holiday.
   ``I always wondered about the conspiracy aspect of it,'' he
said, as he looked at the grassy knoll, which played a large part
in the Warren Commission investigation of Kennedy's death.
   Conspiracy theorists believe more than one gunman fired shots
and that some of the shots came from the knoll. The Warren
Commission said Lee Harvey Oswald acted alone, firing the shots
from the sixth floor of the depository.
   Neither the Kennedy family nor the city of Dallas stages any
public memorial to the event at the assassination site.
   An empty tomb was the city's only Kennedy memorial before the
Dallas County Historical Foundation opened the sixth floor exhibit
in February. Five wreaths lay on the tomb Wednesday morning.
   Cosy McLemore, spokeswoman for the foundation, estimated 1,000
people viewed the new exhibit Wednesday.
   ``Certainly, Dallas is linked in the minds of people with three
things: the assassination, the Cowboys and the TV show,'' Bob Hays,
interim director of the historical foundation, told The Dallas
Morning News.

   The Gannett Foundation on Wednesday
announced a $25,000 grant to help the victims of the Sept. 14
shooting rampage at a Louisville, Ky., printing plant that left
eight people dead and 11 wounded.
   The grant will be given to the Greater Louisville Community
Relief Fund, which has collected more than $158,000 to pay for
medical and support services for the victims and their families.
   The gunman, an employee of the Standard Gravure Corp. who had
been on disability leave for psychiatric problems, went on a
shooting rampage at the plant before killing himself last fall.
   ``This grant was recommended to the Gannett Foundation because
of the family-like closeness between employees of the (Louisville)
Courier-Journal and Standard Gravure Corp.,'' said George N. Gill,
the Courier-Journal's president and publisher, in a statement.
   Standard Gravure and the newspaper are located in adjoining
buildings and both were formerly owned by the Bingham family.
Gannett now owns the Courier-Journal.
   The Gannett Foundation of Arlington, Va., with assets of nearly
$650 milion, is among the nation's largest private foundations.

   Settlement of an Illinois legal dispute over
abortion Wednesday eliminated perhaps the greatest immediate threat
to the Supreme Court's 1973 decision legalizing abortion.
   ``This is a tremendous political victory for the pro-choice
movement,'' said Dawn Johnsen, legal director of the National
Abortion Rights Action League. ``It's a relief having this case off
the Supreme Court's docket.''
   Johnsen said Illinois Attorney General Neil Hartigan, who helped
engineer the settlement, ``clearly has reacted to pressure from the
pro-choice majority.''
   The nation's highest court had been scheduled to hear arguments
in the Illinois case Dec. 5, but the settlement ends the legal
controversy. The formality of seeking a dismissal remains. Such
action, when requested by both sides in a case, is not rare.
   The justices will hear arguments next week in a pair of abortion
cases from Minnesota and Ohio. In those, the court must judge the
validity of state laws requiring doctors to notify the parents of
young, unmarried girls before performing requested abortions.
   The court's decisions in both cases, expected by July, would not
necessarily involve the core holding of the 1973 decision in Roe
vs. Wade _ that women have a constitutional right to abortion.
   In that landmark ruling, the court said states may not interfere
with a woman's decision to have an abortion during the first three
months of her pregnancy. The court said states may seek to protect
the women's health during second-trimester abortions and may seek
to protect fetal life in rare third-trimester abortions.
   A more politically conservative court last July gave states
greater leeway in regulating abortions. But its ruling in a
Missouri case did not abolish the trimester-by-trimester structure
adopted in Roe vs. Wade.
   It was that structure, criticized in recent years by five of the
court's nine justices, which was threatened in the Illinois case.
   The key issue was a set of stringent regulations imposed on
Illinois clinics where most early-pregnancy abortions are performed.
   A federal judge struck down many of the regulations, ruling they
unnecessarily and unconstitutionally would have forced abortion
clinics to become ``the functional equivalent of small hospitals''
for no valid purpose.
   The 7th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals agreed, calling many of
the regulations ``totally unjustified from a medical standpoint.''
   Had the Supreme Court allowed such regulations, Roe vs. Wade's
ban on state first-trimester regulation effectively would have been
overturned.
   The three Illinois laws at issue _ The Medical Practice Act, the
Ambulatory Surgical Treatment Center Act and the Health Facilities
Providers Act _ generally apply to all medical centers where
outpatient surgery is performed.
   Some of the regulations imposed by the laws, however, were aimed
solely at abortion. The laws were challenged by operators of
abortion clinics in Rockford and Chicago.
   The regulations covered staffing and equipment requirements and
even the physical dimensions of a facility.
   One abortion-specific regulation required patient counseling
that included a discussion of alternatives, description of the
procedure to be performed and an explanation of risks and possible
complications.

<HEAD>NYNEX, Strikers Sign Tentative Settlement</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PETER ALAN HARPER</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   Striking NYNEX workers signed a tentative
agreement early Wednesday, ending a 3{-month strike that affected
millions of customers and led to the death of a worker on a picket
line.
   The agreement with the Communication Workers of America ended a
season of bargaining that began with a strike the week of Aug. 6 by
four regional telephone companies. All but NYNEX had settled by
September.
   CWA workers start voting for ratification next week and should
be back to work Dec. 4.
   The strike delayed directory assistance, repairs and
installation for NYNEX's 10.5 million customers in New York state,
two cities in Connecticut, Rhode Island, Massachusetts, New
Hampshire, Vermont and Maine.
   ``It was a long struggle and got very acrimonious and bitter,''
said Jan Pierce, the CWA vice president who lead the negotiations
for the union. ``We had a lot of members that were fired, some that
were hurt, one that got killed.''
   ``It's hard to look at that struggle in victorious terms when we
paid such a price,'' he added. ``But it was a victory for the CWA
and every worker in America who works for a company that has a
company-paid insurance plan.''
   Under the agreement, the company will continue paying for health
costs. Proposals for lump-sum bonuses and profit sharing were
dropped. Wage increases will be 3 percent the first year and 1.5
percent the second and third years, with cost of living increases
added the second and third years.
   Even in the announcement of the settlement, there was discord.
The CWA announced early Wednesday that an agreement had been
signed. However, NYNEX disputed that. Not until 7:30 a.m. did both
sides agree that they had signed a tentative deal.
   A sticking point was how to treat workers suspended or fired
during the strike for alleged offenses ranging from verbally
harassing management workers to physically assaulting them and
damaging their cars.
   Bob Master, a CWA spokesman, said that the disciplined workers
would have the right to go through a grievance procedure, including
a review by a joint union-management panel and arbitration. He said
about 75 workers were fired and 80 suspended during the strike.
   One striker died after a confrontation Aug. 15 at a NYNEX office
at Valhalla in Westchester County. Police said the man jumped onto
the hood of a non-striking worker's car crossing a picket line,
then fell off and struck his head. The union claimed the driver
struck the striking worker.
   Two small groups remain on strike, dissatisfied with the wage
hike: 59 CWA workers at NYNEX Materiel Enterprises in
Massachusetts, a centralized purchasing agent for NYNEX, and 84
workers at NYNEX Information Resources, a Yellow Pages publisher in
New York City.
   ``We hope to clear up the issues separating us'' before the Dec.
4 back-to-work date, Pierce said.
   The CWA's 40,000 members at NYNEX subsidiary New York Telephone
and 20,000 members of the International Brotherhood of Electrical
Workers at New England Telephone struck NYNEX on Aug. 6.
   The strike centered on the company proposal to shift some of the
costs of health care to union workers, from weekly premiums to
yearly deductibles of up to $1,500 a year for families.
   Talks were sporadic and mediators had to be called in.
   The IBEW reached an agreement late Friday and its workers
returned to work Monday, with the blessing of CWA officials. But
the CWA talks broke down early Saturday, resumed informally Monday
and concluded with the tentative deal Wednesday.
   NYNEX reported more than 500 acts of vandalism and offered
$100,000 for information on the alleged sabotage. Two weeks ago,
some 361,000 customers were temporarily without service in
southeastern New York's Ulster, Orange, Sullivan and Dutchess
counties.

   The bodies of two Texas boys allegedly
kidnapped and killed by their father were flown home Wednesday, and
Maine authorities disputed allegations that they could have done
more to prevent the deaths.
   State police refused to say what they found in the lake cottage
where Roy Irwin Abbott Sr. was believed to have stayed with his
young sons shortly before shooting them to death on a dirt road
Monday.
   Abbott, 52, apparently used the cottage without the permission
of its owner, his brother Benjamin Abbott of Portsmouth, N.H.
   ``It is very unlikely we're going to be describing what, if
anything, we found,'' said Stephen McCausland, spokesman for the
Maine Department of Public Safety.
   The bodies of Roy Irwin Abbott Jr., 6, and Ronney Abbott, 4,
were put on a flight Wednesday to Texas, where services are planned
Saturday in Denton County, said John Black, a funeral home manager
in nearby Springvale.
   Autopsies showed the boys died of multiple wounds from a shotgun
fired at close range. Maine authorites identified the younger boy
as Ronney, but Texas authorities said his name was Rooney.
   According to court papers, Abbott walked into a sheriff's office
Monday and said: ``I need to see a police officer. I've killed my
kids.'' He was arraigned Tuesday, made no plea and was held for a
Nov. 29 bail hearing.
   Authorities in Maine and Texas said that Abbott took his sons on
Sept. 1, the day his divorce became final from Maria Louisa Abbott,
saying he would return them after the weekend.
   In Shapleigh, where the lake cottage is located, some residents
have said that the sheriff's office apparently did not pursue the
case vigorously enough to stop the killings.
   ``He made no secret of the fact he had fled Texas with the
children, and he was hiding from his wife,'' said store owner
Barbara Belanger.
   Authorities had known since mid-October that Abbott may have
brought his sons to Maine, State Police Sgt. Michael Harriman said
Tuesday.
   Officers looked for him in Eliot, his hometown; Augusta;
Kittery; and Portsmouth, N.H., where his brother lives, Harriman
said.
   ``Each time we checked these locations, there was another move
on his part, indicating he was aware he was being hunted,''
Harriman said after Abbott's arraignment.
   York County Sheriff C. Wesley Phinney Jr. said Wednesday that
the complaints about his department were ``just simply not
accurate.''
   After deputies learned Abbott had talked of kidnapping the boys,
they traced his car's license plate back to Texas, where it was
registered to someone else and had been on a car sold to a junk
dealer, Phinney said.
   Even though that car was different from the car Abbott was
driving, the sheriff said deputies turned up nothing to lead them
to Abbott.
   Denton police told York County authorities that the person who
originally got the license was not involved in any kidnapping and
Phinney's department closed its case on that complaint, the sheriff
said.

<HEAD>Unrest in East Europe, Latin America Raises Journalist Casualties</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By THOMAS GINSBERG</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   More than a dozen journalists have been killed
or injured in recent months in the upheaval in Eastern Europe and
fighting in Latin America, monitors say.
   In El Salvador, David Blundy, reporter for the Sunday
Correspondent in London, was killed last week covering the civil
war, and another Briton was wounded this week.
   In Czechoslovakia, police and security forces beat up at least
five American, one Dutch and two British journalists, and destroyed
or confiscated their equipment during pro-reform demonstrations
this past weekend, according to preliminary counts by Western
groups that monitor such activity.
   In Peru, American reporter Todd Smith of the Tampa Tribune in
Florida was found dead five days after he disappeared while
investigating drug traffickers.
   At least five Colombian reporters have died since the Bogota
daily El Espectator was bombed Sept. 2, one of the highest tallies
in that South American country's war on drugs, according to Sally
Chew, an editor at the New York-based Committee to Protect
Journalists.
   The newspaper is one of several in Colombia that have carried
out campaigns against drug trafficking.
   ``Aside from China in June, in the last two months we've had
more cases than the rest of the year,'' Ms. Chew said. ``It may
drop, but now it's very high.''
   Governments, even hard-line ones, sometimes respond to public
pressure. But against rebels and drug traffickers, ``there's
nothing you can do to protect yourself,'' Ms. Chew said. ``These
stories need to be covered. All we can do is insist on a certain
amount of respect for journalists.''
   Leonard Sussman, an expert on press freedoms at the New
York-based human rights organization Freedom House, said 60
journalists worldwide have been killed in 1989, compared with 46
last year, 32 in 1987 and 19 in 1986.
   ``One can make a very rough estimate that what we're seeing now
is the loosening of government oppression in places, which means
that there is dissent in some places for the first time,'' Sussman
said. ``When one has the fresh flavor of dissent, people, including
governments, don't know how to handle it and violence comes into
play.''
   Sussman said reporting of attacks on journalists is better in
recent years, ``but there's no escaping the fact that violence is
on the increase. ... The ultimate answer is to democratize the
societies so that it doesn't happen.''

   A demonstration turned violent
Wednesday when hundreds of right-wing supporters attending two
rallies favoring German reunification clashed briefly with
opponents at the rally, police said.
   One Republican Party member was injured when an outdoor rally
attended by 350 right-wingers at Herleshausen turned into a fight
with about 20 opponents, and police said he was hospitalized for
treatment. Another Republican supporter was detained for an
identity check and released, police said.
   Fights with counter-demonstrators were also reported at a rally
by 500 Republicans in nearby Eschwege, 135 miles northeast of Bonn
near the East German border, but no injuries were reported.
   Republican activists had come from all over West Germany to the
villages near East Germany to make public calls for the
reunification of Germany.
   The Republicans, running on an anti-foreigner, nationalist
platform, have become a force in West German politics through
several electoral successes this year.

   Protest leaders vowed Wednesday to
go ahead with a general strike amid signs of growing worker
support, and 200,000 people in Wenceslas Square chanted the name of
Alexander Dubcek, the ousted leader of the failed ``Prague Spring''
reforms.
   The demonstrators who rallied for a sixth straight day roared
their approval when a message was read from Dubcek, the Communist
leader whose reforms were crushed by a Soviet-led Warsaw Pact
invasion in 1968.
   They also cheered banned playwright Vaclav Havel, who said the
hard-line leaders ``are now afraid of us.''
   Dubcek, a 68-year-old pensioner living in Bratislava, said in
his message that he vehemently backed demands for the resignation
of President Gustav Husak, who succeeded him as Communist leader in
1969, and current party chief Milos Jakes, responsible for purging
Dubcek and a half-million other Communists.
   As the crowd chanted ``Dubcek! Dubcek!'' dissident Venek Silhan
announced that the once popular leader hoped to address the crowd
``in the nearest future.''
   In Bratislava, capital of Slovakia, about 15,000 protesters
demanded free elections and shouted ``Long live Dubcek!'' outside
the Palace of Justice trial of prominent dissident Jan Carnogursky.
   Earlier Wednesday, Dubcek briefly addressed a crowd of a few
thousand people after attending the morning court session.
   Witnesses said Dubcek told the demonstrators to maintain calm
and order. He agreed with them that the sedition and subversion
charges against Carnogursky were unfair.
   State-run TV, for the first time in years, showed Dubcek briefly
as he attended the trial.
   The state news agency CTK reported that the Politburo met and
decided to call a meeting of the party's Central Committee on
Friday, apparently in response to the unprecedented rallies that
show no signs of abating.
   Elsewhere in Czechsolovakia, 80,000 students and intellectuals
staged sit-in strikes and vowed to go ahead with a general strike,
planned for Monday. They claimed growing worker support.
   Workers interviewed at Prague's giant CKD works, where at least
1,400 voted to back the two-hour work stoppage, said units of the
People's Militia, the Communist paramilitary police, were guarding
gates at their plant.
   Havel, Czechoslovakia's most prominent dissident, joyously
greeted the crowd in Wenceslas Square and said that ``after 20
years of timelessness, history is coming back to this country.''
   ``Those who have for long years made bloody vengeance to those
who opposed them are now afraid of us,'' Havel said.
   Viewers were able for the first time to watch live clips from
the square on state TV. But the broadcast was abruptly halted after
a worker interviewed by a reporter on the square accused the
government of lying.
   ``What is the government afraid of? They may be afraid because
they are lying to us for 20 years,'' said the worker, identified as
Honza Lexa.
   An announcer appeared to say the broadcast was temporarily
halted because some unidentified television workers disagreed with
it. Clips from the square resumed 35 minutes later.
   The incident reflected the smoldering emotions touched off
around the country by the protests, the biggest challenge to the
hard-line government since 1968.
   The Communist Party, apparently anxious to stem the wave of
protest triggered by police brutality against student
demonstrators, has held meetings with influential voices who have
supported the pro-democracy movement.
   Demonstrators have claimed that a mathematics student was killed
by police during a rally Nov. 17. The government denies it.
   Jakes and his ally, Prague party chief Miroslav Stepan, strongly
attacked the organizers of the rallies as ``anti-socialist.''
   But Stepan held a surprise meeting Wednesday with the
influential head of the Roman Catholic church, Cardinal Frantisek
Tomasek, who issued a statement Tuesday strongly backing the
demonstrators. In another first, state TV showed excerpts of that
meeting as well.
   Premier Ladislav Adamec, who broke with years of policy Tuesday
by receiving a delegation that included prominent dissidents, met
the head of the Writers' Union, Miroslav Valek, according to CTK.
   One of the strongest sources of support for the striking
students has been the intelligentsia. Actors in dozens of theaters
have been on strike since the weekend, turning their stages into
political debating clubs. Thousands of artists have joined them.
   CTK carried an interview with dissident Jan Ruml, one of four
members of the new opposition group Civic Forum who met Adamec
Tuesday.
   Ruml was quoted as stressing that the meeting with Adamec did
not mark the start of a government-opposition dialogue, and that
Civic Forum would persist in backing the Nov. 27 strike and calling
for the resignation of Jakes and other top Communists.

<HEAD>Botanist Readying For Biosphere Test Exit Calls Experiment Success</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ARTHUR H. ROTSTEIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>TUCSON, Ariz. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Botanist Linda Leigh, who has spent the
last three weeks literally in her element, called her stay in an
experimental biosphere a success Wednesday but said she's ready to
return to Earth.
   When Ms. Leigh exits Thanksgiving afternoon from 21 days inside
an airtight, 17,000-cubic foot glass-and-steel structure, she will
have been the longest inhabitant of a completely enclosed
ecosystem, with air and water generated and recycled independently
of Earth's.
   ``I'll be emerging tomorrow at 2 p.m. as scheduled, and
everything is rolling,'' she said.
   Ms. Leigh has been living inside a test module for Biosphere II,
a $30 million project under construction. Scientists plan to place
four men and four women inside a much larger sealed structure for
two years to determine whether humans can duplicate Earth's life
systems for possible use in space.
   ``The one thing that I really do miss is just companionship,''
Ms. Leigh said Wednesday in a telephone interview from within the
module, located on a ranch about 30 miles north of Tucson.
   ``I don't think that it's a matter of feeling lonely, but
there's just something about direct human contact and sitting with
somebody and pouring them a cup of tea or a cup of coffee and
having that morning discussion; it's very different than doing it
over the phone or over the video,'' she said.
   ``Other than that, I'm quite content on the inside. I feel like
I could stay in here indefinitely.''
   Since entering the module Nov. 2, Ms. Leigh has been in frequent
daily contact with her outside support team by telephone, video
conference, two-way radio and just looking through the glass
windows.
   Three daily medical checks, including pulse at rest and after
exercise, blood pressure, pulmonary function, blood oxygen
saturation and urine tests, have shown her health is ``unbelievably
positive. The physicians on the outside can't believe it,'' she
said.
   Two people also check her psychologically each day, Ms. Leigh
said, ``just to make sure that my state of mind or humor is
normal.''
   Ms. Leigh baked herself a 39th birthday cake on Nov. 12 of
sorghum, rice flour and sweet potatoes harvested from her
mini-field. Her colleagues serenaded her with ``Happy Birthday'' by
video and directed her to gifts hidden in her living area.
   Other crops have ranged from jalapeno peppers to kohlrabi. Lemon
grass, mint, tarragon and fennel are among the herbs she has used
to season her meals and make tea. She also has a tank of talapia
fish.
   ``I had talapia Vera Cruzana the other night,'' she said.
   Water for drinking, cooking and showering is dehumidified from
the air. Samples are passed through a special port for outside
analysis, along with samples of waste water and her urine. The rest
of the waste water is fed into a marsh recycling system.
   The botanist also has had to be a mechanic and technician,
repairing the loose belt of a large fan that heats and cools the
module, and fine-tuning the irrigation system.
   Ms. Leigh said she hasn't felt isolated because her support team
is excellent. In fact, she occasionally has had to pull the
curtains in her living area to get away from the observing eyes
outside. Either that, ``or I go out into what we call `the
wilderness' and just stay out within the plants.''

<HEAD>Officer Sorry, But Says He Feels Justified in Shooting of 13-Year-Olds</HEAD>
<DATELINE>INVER GROVE HEIGHTS, Minn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A police officer apologized to
the families of two 13-year-old immigrants killed by a blast from
his shotgun, but said the shooting was justified because he thought
the boys were armed.
   ``I am the father of three sons and a daughter. I feel a great
loss and a deep grief,'' Kenneth Murphy wrote in a letter to the
families of Thai Yang and Ba See Lor, both Hmong immigrants from
Southeast Asia.
   ``I only hope you can accept my sincere apologies and
sympathies. In my 21 years as a police officer, I had hoped that I
would never face this type of situation,'' he wrote, according to a
copy of the letter released by his lawyer Tuesday.
   The boys, both of St. Paul, were shot in the back from about 30
yards away while fleeing through a field in suburban Inver Grove
Heights last week after abandoning a stolen car following a
high-speed chase, investigators said.
   The state Bureau of Criminal Apprehension is investigating the
shooting and two special prosecutors have been appointed to take
the case to a Dakota County grand jury next month.
   Murphy, 54, has been placed on paid administrative leave from
the Inver Grove Heights force.
   In his first public comments on the shooting, Murphy said in
interviews Tuesday that he feared for his life when he saw what he
thought was a gun. The object turned out to be a screwdriver.
   ``I felt there was a weapon involved. Knowing their behavior and
what they had done,'' Murphy said, his eyes tearing and voice
choking as he referred to the alleged car theft and police chase.
   ``The first thing I thought of was a silver or chrome barrel of
a pistol.''
   Murphy said he fired at Yang not realizing that Lor was nearby.
   When medical help arrived, Murphy said he noticed an 8- to
10-inch-long screwdriver on the ground and realized he had mistaken
the gleam of tool's shaft for a gun.
   Accompanied to one interview by three of his grown children and
his lawyer, Murphy said he didn't know the two victims were so
young until one of his sons told him almost nine hours after the
shooting.
   ``It's bad enough that it was anybody, but especially
13-year-olds,'' he said.
   Lor and Yang, both born in refugee camps in Thailand after their
families fled their homes in Laos, were buried several feet away
from each other Sunday in St. Paul's Oakland Cemetery.
   Minnesota has the largest Hmong community in the country after
California, and members of the community have alleged that the
shooting was racially motivated. But Murphy and his attorney, Paul
Rogosheske, said race had nothing to do with it.
   ``We do realize how difficult it is to move and start a new
life,'' Murphy said in his letter. ``My wife also was an immigrant
to this country. She feels your anguish, as only a mother can and
I, as only a father can.''
   Murphy's wife is a native of Yugoslavia.

<HEAD>WASHINGTON: Curtain: Berlin.</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   In the 1940s, West Berlin remained free because Harry Truman
said: Hands off. In the 1950s, Ike backed America's words with
muscle. In the 1960s, West Berliners took heart, when John F.
Kennedy said: I am a Berliner. In the 1970s, Presidents Nixon, Ford
and Carter stood with Berlin _ by standing with NATO. And in the
1980s, Ronald Reagan went to Berlin to say: Tear down this wall.
   Now we are at the threshold of the 1990s. And as we begin the
new decade, I am reaching out to President Gorbachev, asking him to
work with me to bring down the last barriers to a new world of
freedom. Let us move beyond containment, and once and for all end
Cold War.
   We can make such a bold bid because America is strong, and 40
years of perseverance and patience are finally paying off. More
recently, quiet diplomacy, working behind the scenes, has achieved
results. We can now dare to imagine a new world, with a new Europe,
rising on the foundations of democracy.
   This new world was taking shape when my presidency began with
these words: ``The day of the dictator is over.'' During the spring
and summer we told the people of the world what America believes,
and what America wants for the future. America believes that
``liberty is an idea whose time has come in Eastern Europe.''
America wants President Gorbachev's reforms, known as perestroika,
to succeed. And America wants the Soviets to join us, in moving
``beyond containment,'' to a new partnership. Some wondered if all
this was realistic. Now, though we are still on the course set last
spring, events are moving faster than anyone imagined or predicted.
   Look around the world _ in the developing nations, the people
are demanding freedom. Poland and Hungary are now fledgling
democraties _ a non-communist government in Poland, and free
elections coming soon in Hungary. And in the Soviet Union itself,
the forces of reform under Mikhail Gorbachev are bringing
unprecedented openness and change.
   But nowhere in the world today _ or even in the history of Man _
have the warm hearts of men and women triumphed so swiftly _ so
certainly _ over cold stone _ as in Berlin. Indeed, in all of East
Germany. If I may paraphrase the words of a great poet, Robert
Frost: There is certainly something in us that doesn't love a wall.
   When I spoke to the German people in Mainz last May, I applauded
the removal of the barriers between Hungary and Austria, saying:
``Let Berlin be next.'' And the West German people joined us in a
call for a Europe whole and free.
   Just yesterday, the West German Foreign Minister gave me a piece
of the Berlin Wall _ it is on my desk as a reminder of the power of
freedom to bring down the walls between people.
   It brought back memories of seven years ago, when I went to
Modlareuth, a small town in Germany also known as Little Berlin. A
divided village, really, its cobbled streets blocked by barbed wire
and concrete _ on the one side freedom, on the other despair. I
talked with the townspeople, not a hundred and fifty yards from the
specter of armed guards in towers. Some day I'd like to go back to
Little Berlin, and see families reunited, see neighbors once apart,
coming together.

   President Bush on Wednesday declared a state
of disaster in three Louisiana parishes hard hit by heavy rains and
flooding earlier this month.
   The disaster declaration covering residents of Jefferson,
Orleans and St. Charles parishes is the fourth federal disaster aid
proclamation in Louisiana this year.
   Bush's proclamation opens the way for Federal Emergency
Management Agency assistance in the way of loans, temporary
housing, grants and other programs to help individuals, businesses
and local governments recover.
   The heavy rains hit Louisiana on Nov. 7-9.

<TEXT>
   Change is coming swiftly. And with this change, the dramatic
vindication of free Europe's economic and political institutions;
the new Europe that is coming is being built _ must be built _ on
the foundation of democratic values. But the faster the pace, the
smoother our path must be. After all, this is serious business.
   The peace we are building must be different than the hard,
joyless peace between two armed camps we've known so long. The
scars of the conflict that began a half-century ago still divide a
continent. So the historic task before us now, is to begin the
healing of this old wound.
   During our visit to Poland and Hungary last July, I found new
encouragement that we were on track _ and that there was, at long
last, the chance for fundamental change. I saw first-hand acts of
healing and reconciliation. It was in Warsaw at my lunch for
General Jaruzelski and the leaders of Solidarity that I met a woman
who had worked, at great personal risk, for the release of jailed
Solidarity members. She was asked: ``How is it possible, after such
a short time, to break bread with the men who ordered those
imprisonments _ why the absence of bitterness?'' And she replied:
``Our joy at what is happening now is more powerful than memory.''
   I wish you could have been there, for what we witnessed was
extraordinary. The old antagonisms melted away as former
adversaries stood up, often with tears in their eyes, and toasted
the future. Our guests knew that history would judge them by how
well they would cooperate. Well, there is a spirit of cooperation
in Eastern Europe _ the result _ Poland and Hungary are being
transformed.
   They deserve our support, and they're getting it. We have
matched our words with action _ new loans and grants _ teams of
American economic experts _ working to help them adjust to a free
market economy _ clearing the way for U.S. investment and trade
with Poland and Hungary. Now the peoples of these nations can
finally expect their hard work to lead to a better life.
   These same winds of change are sweeping our own hemisphere,
democracy transforming the Americas with stunning speed.
Regrettably, there are some exceptions _ Panama, Nicaragua and
Cuba. And these last two are holding out against their people only
because of the massive support of weapons and supplies from their
communist allies. So when I see President Gorbachev, I'll ask him
to join with us to help bring freedom and democracy to all the
people of Latin America.
   So as we celebrate the events of Eastern Europe, remember that
some walls still remain between East and West. These are the
invisible walls of suspicion. The walls of doubt, misunderstanding
and miscalculation.
   It was while in Eastern Europe last summer that I decided to
make a personal effort to break through these last barriers.
   Back in May, I set down five steps President Gorbachev should
meet if we are to take his new thinking seriously: First, reduce
Soviet forces; second, support self-determination in Eastern
Europe; third, work with us to end regional disputes; fourth,
achieve a lasting pluralism and respect for human rights; and
fifth, join with us in addressing global problems, including the
international drug menace and dangers to the environment. Serious
problems still remain, especially regional conflicts. The Soviet
Union has made progress in these five areas. That is undeniable.

<TEXT>
   With that in mind and the momentous changes in Eastern Europe, I
invited President Gorbachev to meet me 10 days from now. This is a
first meeting _ a time for exploration. It is not a time for
detailed arms control negotiations best left for next year's summit.
   I want President Gorbachev to know exactly where the United
States stands. Let me be clear _ America stands with freedom and
democracy. We are not meeting to determine the future of Europe _
after all, the peoples of Europe are determining their own future.
   Though there will be no surprises sprung on our allies, we will
miss no opportunity to expand freedom and enhance the peace.
   And to those who question our prudent pace, they must understand
that a time of historic change is no time for recklessness. The
peace, and the confidence, and the security of our friends in
Europe _ it's just too important.
   We will seek President Gorbachev's assurance that this process
of reform in Eastern Europe will continue. And we will give him our
assurance that America welcomes reform not as an adversary seeking
advantage, but as a people offering support.
   Our goal is to see this historic tide of freedom broadened,
deepened _ and sustained.
   We find enormous encouragement in its peaceful advance and its
acceptance by the Soviet Union. We can now raise our hopes on other
issues _ our common environment, our common war against drugs, as
well as on human rights, and the regional conflicts that remain.
   Immediately after my visit with President Gorbachev, I will go
to Brussels to consult with our partners in NATO _ the very
alliance that has kept the West free for 40 years. I will assure
them that no matter how dramatic the change in Eastern Europe, or
in the Soviet Union itself, the United States will continue to
stand with our allies and our friends.
   For in a new Europe, the American role may change in form but
not in fundamentals. After all, the Soviet Union maintains hundreds
of thousands of troops throughout Eastern Europe.
   Study the map, review history and you'll see that this presence,
with the Soviet Union's natural advantage of geography, cannot be
ignored.
   So even if forces are significantly reduced on both sides, a
noble goal indeed, we will remain in Europe as long as our friends
want and need us.

   Off the island nation of Malta, Mikhail Gorbachev and I will
begin the work of years. We can help the peoples of Europe achieve
a new destiny, in a peaceful Europe whole and free. I will tell
President Gorbachev, the dynamic architect of Soviet reform, that
America wants the people of the Soviet Union to fulfill their
destiny. And I will assure him that there is no greater advocate of
perestroika than the president of the United States.
   When we meet, we will be on ships at anchor in a Mediterranean
bay that has served as a sea lane of commerce and conflict for more
than two thousand years. This ancient port has been conquered by
Caesar and Sultan, Crusader and King. Its forts and watchtowers
survey a sea that entombs the scuttled ships of empires lost _
slave galleys, galleons, dreadnoughts, destroyers. These ships,
once meant to guard lasting empires, now litter the ocean floor,
and guard nothing more than reefs of coral.
   So if the millennia offer us a lesson, perhaps it is this: True
security does not come from empire and domination. True security
can only be found in the growing trust of free peoples.
   It has been said that peace is not the work of a single day, nor
will it be the consequence of a single act. Yet every constructive
act contributes to its growth; every omission impedes it. Peace
will come, in the end, as a child grows to maturity _ slowly, until
we realize one day in incredulous surprise that the child is almost
grown.
   It is our hope that Malta will be such a constructive act _
guiding brave pilgrims on their journey to a new world of freedom.

   Q: There were pockets of Marines who were actually in the hotel
also at the same time that the hostages _ who were actually
barricaded and had weapons and were safe yesterday. Were they
involved at all in helping this morning?
   Bush: Helping what?
   Q: Helping this operation? The Marines who were barricaded?
   Bush: I don't know yet. I don't know yet.
   Q: Do we have any intelligence available as to why this
offensive by the FMLN occurred when it did?
   Bush: Desperation. But I haven't seen more than that. I mean,
they see the tide moving against them. They see the embarrassment
that Ortega went through when the arms coming through Salvador were
exposed publicly and they saw how he was almost _ I mean, not
Ortega _ yeah, Ortega _ almost isolated from the other democracies.
And I think they see that their cause has very little following as
the world moves away from Marxism that they _ that they have as
their creed. And, so, I think there's a certain desperation on
their part.
   Q: So you think they're concerned about _ (inaudible) East
Germany and other Eastern bloc nations?
   Bush: Well, I don't know, but I would think so. I would think
they'd be concerned about a lot of things.
   Q: Are you saying that _ back on the Cristiani's troops moving
in on the churches _ are you saying that they were justified, they
have been justified?
   Bush: I'm not justifying it at all. I've told you what I think.
   Q: You made it sort of hypothetical. You said ``if'' _ if
they're harboring fugitives, then that's okay to move in on them,
but otherwise, you would condemn it. I'm wondering what your
assessment is of what's been going on in this case.
   Bush: I can't assess it for you because I don't know about all _
I don't know about the cases you're talking about. I just gave you
a broad parameter of _ (inaudible)
   Q: Mr. President, if we could switch to Eastern Europe for a
moment, things look like they're loosening up now in
Czechoslovakia. What are your feelings or emotions about that?
   Bush: Well, do you want me to be more emotional on it than I was
about East Germany? Is that the case?
   Q: We'll have to listen to your piece tonight.
   Bush: Yeah, listen _ tune in up there. Tune in. And I think now
people understand why I didn't go rushing off to the Wall in
Berlin. I think there's worldwide understanding about that.
   Q: (Off mike.)
   Bush: Maybe one or two in this country that don't understand it,
but those who are involved in all of this seem to understand it
very clearly.
   Q: On this trip today, critics like Jesse Jackson say this is
nothing but public relations. The ``thousand points of light'' is
just a PR gimmick to tell the American people that you don't want
to put federal _ increase federal spending for social programs.
What is your response?
   Bush: Well, I'd _ I don't want to respond to your question
because I haven't heard Jesse Jackson say that.
   Q: You'll read his comments.
   Bush: Well, when I get there. But let me put it in a more
positive note. What's happening in terms of the concept of a
``thousand points of light'' is very, very exciting, and it's in
keeping with our great American tradition of one American helping
another. And when you see what this one newspaper is being able to
do to by encouraging individuals to help others, it is staggering;
it is monumental, and it is terribly exciting. And people helping
people and the volunteer sector can do so many more things in
totality than the federal government can do. So if he doesn't
understand that, I need to sit down with him and try to make him
understand how beautiful it is and how much good is being done. And
that's what this is all about.
   So, I can't -- I'm not going to take on Jesse. It's the day
before Thanksgiving. I mean, I've got a lot of things to be
thankful for.
   Q: (Off mike.)
   Bush: What? No, I won't take him on. I mean, he's out there _
let him do his thing. The American people understand this, and it's
beginning to be much clearer to them. It's a wonderful concept.
   Q: It's another way of saying, ``Read my lips, no taxes.''
   Bush: Absolutely not. Was that his allegation?
   Q: Well, that's what some the Democrats are saying.
   Bush: Oh, well.
   Q: Could we _ could we have one on Congress here?
   Bush: It's Thanksgiving.
   Q: Over the months you've had _ (inaudible) _ rhetoric with
Congress saying, you know, a lot of partisanship, and now that is
all is said and done, you seem to be _ (inaudible) _ do you plan to
make more conciliatory comments?
   Bush: I'm a dealer. It's the day before Thanksgiving. I have a
lot to be thankful for. One is that there was a reconciliation
bill, one is that there was some progress, and two is that they're
leaving town. So, we've got a lot to be grateful for and this is no
time to pick fights. You guys want to push me into these fights,
and I'll get into them once in a while, but I want to continue to
extend a bipartisan hand, get out there and try to solve some
problems here. And I think we have solved some. I'm glad we moved
on an ethics package. I wish we'd moved on an environmental
package. I'm glad we got a reconciliation bill. I wish we'd moved
on my anti-drug@anti-crime proposal.
   So, we get some _ we give a little here and compromise. And I'm
in a spirit of goodwill today, the day before Thanksgiving. But
you're right, there will be some fights down the line. But
fortunately now, with Congress out of town, we can focus on the
upcoming meetings with Mr. Gorbachev and we can get wrestling with
our very difficult budget problems which are facilitated, I might
add, by the bipartisan effort on reconciliation. They're not
solved, but they're facilitated. So, I have a lot to be thankful
for.
   Q: (Off mike.)
   Bush: Yeah.

   Q: When are you signing it?

thought maybe I had. (Laughs.) As soon as it appears _
   STAFF: I don't think we've received the package yet.
   Bush: When the carrier pigeon comes alongside, bring him in. I

   Q: The summit's 10 days away, sir. Are you a bit more confident
that you can sort of set the atmosphere you want to _ (inaudible) _
and how are you going to do it?
   Bush: Yes, yes. Do what _ keep on doing what we're doing. Boy
Scout motto, ``Be prepared.'' Yes. They're going. They're going on,
yes.
   We'll have a visit with Margaret Thatcher on Friday; I'll be on
the phone to some more European leaders, and maybe leaders in our
hemisphere, because I don't want to send a sign to the Western
Hemisphere that, because of this Malta meeting, we are losing
interest in the problems here and that I'm not interested in their
opinion as to what goes on in Eastern Europe or what might be on
the minds of the Soviet leaders.
   Mulroney'll be weighing in. He's had a good meeting with Mr.
Gorbachev; so, I've got a lot of homework to do. We're getting good
advice from outsiders, people not in the government. We're dealing
_ I'm dealing with some at what I would call the expert level, a
little below Cabinet level in our government, and that's a good
thing to do, because we've got some wonderful people in our career
services, intelligence, Foreign Service that are very
knowledgeable, and I've got a lot of preparation to do, but I look
forward to the meeting with Mr. Gorbachev. We're going in in a
spirit of total goodwill. We are not going to blindside our allies,
and it'll be a good meeting.
   Q: (Inaudible).
   Bush: Not at _ not Yalta. That is correct. We are not trying to
divvy up anything or decide the fate of any sovereign nation. That
is not what we will do. We have large partners in NATO. We have
small partners. We have countries in Europe that are not in NATO,
and it would be presumptuous and arrogant for the President of the
United States, superpower though we may be, to try to decide the
future of Europe in a way that would impinge on the sovereignty of
any country, East or West, and that is not what we're going to be.
And I'm sure, from various ways, I am certain that President
Gorbachev understands that.
   This is going to be a good meeting, and you know, I think, given
the _ even though this _ the genesis for this meeting was several
months ago, the rapidity of change in Eastern Europe might have
dictated that such a meeting be held even if we hadn't planned it.
So, when I said, in that David Frost interview that some of them _
some of us missed the nuances of it _ three times that ``the Wall
would come down,'' I did not have that in mind when we set this
meeting two months before that, but I would like people to note
that I felt that way, and sure enough, it is happening _ faster
than many of us might have thought, but we don't want to miss an
opportunity. We're not going to miss an opportunity.
   You know, Thanksgiving is the time to count blessings. Some of
you know that part of mine are our 11 grandchildren, and I like to
put this meeting now, at least at this time of year in the context
of how will this _ these discussions, and then what we do later on
_ affect the lives of our family and of all the other families that
are going to be praying together and celebrating together tomorrow
at Thanksgiving? And this kind of meeting, where you eliminate
misunderstanding and look down the road a decade or so, can be
extraordinarily helpful in guaranteeing a peaceful future for kids
all over, including the Soviet Union. So it's _ I'm thinking of it
rather philosophically now with Thanksgiving tomorrow.
   Q: (Inaudible) _ decisions on the military _ (inaudible) _
   Bush: No, because you see, we're part of an alliance. And a
decision to do something of that nature has got to be a collective
decision. And I've always felt that way, and _ you know, he'll
understand that. I mean, that doesn't mean you can't philosophize,
but there would be the inhibition. And the inhibition is we're part
of an alliance. And what the French think, the Brits think, the
Germans think, and the Danes, Belgians _ everybody involved _ is
very important to me. So we wouldn't _ we aren't going to be
dealing out cards that affect somebody else _ commit somebody else
to something. We can't do that.
   Lest I not have another opportunity, I hope all of you have a
very happy Thanksgiving, too. Thank you.
   Q: Thank you.

<HEAD>Bulgarian Party Leadership Moves to Drop Vestiges of Zhivkov Rule</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROLAND PRINZ</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>VIENNA, Austria (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Bulgaria's communist leadership set up a
commission Wednesday to investigate corruption under ousted leader
Todor Zhivkov and fired his son Vladimir as head of a party
department, the state news agency BTA said.
   The Communist Party's ruling Politburo also decided at its
meeting in Sofia to turn over to the public official residences and
hunting retreats used mostly by Zhivkov and his guests.
   For the first time, the Council of Ministers appointed a
government spokesman _ Filip Bokov, 41, an English-speaking Foreign
Ministry official trained in Moscow.
   Vladimir Zhivkov lost his job at the Central Committee's culture
department 1{ weeks after his father was toppled as party chief and
state president on Nov. 10.
   After his father's departure, the younger Zhivkov, denounced by
some Bulgarians as having an excessive life style, seemed certain
to lose his post.
   Todor Zhivkov, who held power for 35 years, has since been
accused of living in luxury at the people's expense. At recent
rallies sanctioned by authorities, protesters demanded he be tried
in court.
   According to BTA, the Politburo also decided to convene the
policy-setting Central Committee on Dec. 11 to discuss the economic
and social crisis and other issues.
   The Politburo set up a special, 11-member state and party
commission to consider what BTA called ``some urgent problems
related to distortions in social and economic life.''
   Its chairman will be former Foreign Trade Minister Andrei
Lukanov, who was elevated to the Politburo and became a Central
Committee secretary in a reshuffle soon after Zhivkov's fall.
   The panel also includes the chief prosecutor and the chairman of
the Supreme Court, making it likely the commission will prepare
cases for prosecution in court.
   BTA said 13 plush official residences were turned over to
charitable, student and tourist groups, including one at Pravets,
Zhivkov's hometown.
   Six hunting retreats used by Zhivkov and his entourage will be
made available to the Ministry of Agriculture and to a tourism
organization promoting international hunting, BTA said.
   The agency said most of any tourism revenue gained this way will
go to national medical care needs.

   Crews of the SR-71
Blackbirds bade farewell Wednesday to their spy jets, shot down by
budget cuts after dodging attackers at the edge of space for 24
years by flying faster than a speeding bullet.
   ``It feels like a death in the family,'' Maj. Don Watkins, an
SR-71 pilot, said after a news conference announcing that Tuesday
marked the final operation of the highest-flying and fastest
airplane, which can photograph a license plate from more than 15
miles up.
   Col. James Savarda, commander of the 9th Strategic
Reconnaissance Wing, said the ``emotional end to an era in aviation
history'' came when President Bush signed a budget measure deleting
more than $200 million for the SR-71, the nation's original stealth
aircraft.
   Savarda would not rule out that the decision could leave a gap
in the nation's spying capabilities during some future crisis, but
he said budget cuts have forced the military to rely solely on
satellite surveillance and the much slower and lower-flying U-2 spy
plane.
   Critics of the SR-71, including top Defense Department and Air
Force officials, have said satellites provide adequate spying
capabilities.
   Defenders of the Blackbird, including the State Department and
CIA, contend that satellites risk being shot down and are not as
versatile as the plane, which has overflown crisis flashpoints
since its introduction in January 1966.
   Nearly three decades after the first SR-71 prototypes were built
by Lockheed, the twin-engine planes based at Beale Air Force Base,
110 miles northeast of San Francisco, still hold world records for
speed and altitude.
   The Blackbird also has fascinated air show audiences. Its dagger
shape, black and sinister, resembles a starship out of the movies.
Its unusual form has been used on the cover of numerous aviation
books.
   The SR-71's top capabilities remain secret, but the Air Force
says it flies higher than 85,000 feet at more than 2,100 mph _ or
over three times the speed of sound. That's roughly 33 miles a
minute _ faster than a bullet; fast enough to streak from San
Francisco to New York in 1 hour, 45 minutes.
   Its pilots and navigators wear spacesuits. They say they have
been attacked numerous times by ground and air missiles, but the
plane can easily outrace enemy missiles and fighters. In fact, the
Blackbirds do not even return fire; they are unarmed.
   The plane was the first to employ the stealth or radar-evading
technology that is the hallmark of the nation's newest military
aircraft.
   There are reportedly only nine of the 30 original SR-71s still
in operation. Some have crashed; others simply have worn out.
   Blackbirds at forward fields in Mildenhall, England, and Kadena
Air Base in Okinawa, Japan, will be flown to Beale. They eventually
may be sent to museums, base officials said.

   Spectators who often crowd
this military base to watch space shuttles land will be barred from
the public viewing site at the end of Discovery's classified
flight, NASA says.
   The shuttle was launched from Cape Canaveral, Fla., Wednesday
night. It is expected to land here in the Mojave Desert on Sunday
night, but the exact landing time will be announced only 24 hours
beforehand.
   Discovery's mission was to deploy a 2{-ton, $300 million spy
satellite to eavesdrop on Soviet military and diplomatic
communications.
   ``Since the flight is a classified Department of Defense
mission, no viewing site will be available'' for the landing, said
National Aeronautics and Space Administration spokeswoman Nancy
Lovato.
   ``Access to Edwards Air Force Base will be restricted to
official business only during landing operations,'' she added.
``There will be no guest access nor will usual NASA tours be held
during that period.''
   Huge crowds have jammed onto the public viewing site on the east
shore of Rogers Dry Lake for previous non-classified landings,
including a record crowd of 500,000 that joined then-President
Reagan in watching Columbia land on July 4, 1982.

   A longshoreman testified he saw a policeman squat
by his parked car, aim his gun and kill a black motorcyclist as the
prosecution concluded its case Wednesday into two deaths that
sparked rioting in January.
   The state presented 27 witnesses over six days in its effort to
prove that Colombian-born officer William Lozano, 31, was guilty of
manslaughter in the slayings of Clement Lloyd, 23, and his
passenger, Allan Blanchard, 24, who died of injuries suffered when
the motorcycle crashed after the shooting.
   The Jan. 16 shooting in the predominantly black neighborhood of
Overtown triggered three days of rioting that left one looter shot
dead, 11 people injured by gunfire and 13 buildings burned down.
   Longshoreman Lonnie Vickers said he was standing outside a bar
when he first heard and then saw the motorcycle being pursued by a
squad car. In the opposite traffic lane, Vickers said Lozano was
standing by the rear of his parked patrol car.
   ``As the motorcycle approached, he just got down and pointed his
gun,'' Vickers said. ``He followed the motorcycle right around and
`bam' _ he just shot.''
   Under cross-examination by defense attorney Roy Black, Vickers
insisted that the motorcycle, which he estimated was going 40 to 50
mph, was already on its way past Lozano when the officer fired.
   Vickers also maintained that Lozano remained right beside his
parked car in the opposite lane. That is a crucial point for the
defense, which claims the motorcycle was barreling down on Lozano
in the same lane when he shot in self-defense.
   Previous witnesses said the officer took several steps out into
the street before pulling his gun.
   Unlike the previous eyewitnesses, Vickers was not a resident of
a nearby apartment building and did not know the residents. The
defense claims that the other prosecution witnesses, all of whom
are black, met during the riot and changed their stories to
implicate Lozano.
   Hilda McPhee, a resident of the adjacent apartment building,
testified that she saw the motorcycle just as it reached the
squatting officer.
   ``After the motorcycle got in my view, I heard a `pow,''' she
said, adding that the motorcycle remained in the lane opposite from
Lozano, and that the officer was never in danger.
   Under cross-examination, however, she said the shot came just
after the motorcycle passed Lozano. That would clash with
prosecution evidence indicating that Lloyd was shot from in front.
   Also testifying was Maj. Mike Gonzalez, homicide investigation
director for the Miami police department, who talked to Lozano
about an hour after the shooting.
   He quoted the officer as saying, ```I went out in the street. He
was coming right at me.'''
   Lozano then told him he did not know if he had hit Lloyd,
Gonzalez said.
   ```It didn't seem like it. He didn't act like it,''' Gonzalez
said Lozano told him.
   Prosecutors say that shows Lloyd continued in a straight line
and, therefore, was never headed directly at the policeman.
   The defense, which will open its testimony on Friday, has not
said whether Lozano will take the stand in his own behalf, nor how
long their presentation will take.

   Here is the text of President Bush's
Thanksgiving address to the nation:
   Good evening. Like many of you, I'm spending tomorrow with
family. We'll say grace, carve the turkey, and thank God for our
many blessings _ and for our great country.
   This holiday also marks the adjournment of Congress. And I've
worked with Congress _ extending my hand across the party aisle,
advancing legislation to free our streets of the fear of crime and
drugs. We proposed ways to clean the air, the water and the land
around us. And we've joined with the nation's governors to enter an
historic compact to better our schools. And especially touching is
that so many Americans have answered the call for community
service, the thousand points of light, by rolling up their sleeves
and pitching in for the hopeless, the helpless _ each volunteer, a
beacon of light for someone who has lost his way.
   And this will be a very special Thanksgiving. It marks an
extraordinary year. But before our families sit down tomorrow, we
will give thanks for yet another reason: Around the world tonight,
new pilgrims are on a voyage to freedom and for many, it's not a
trip to some far-away place, but to a world of their own making.
   On other Thanksgivings, the world was haunted by the images of
watchtowers, guard dogs and machine guns. In fact, many of you had
not even been born when the Berlin Wall was erected in 1961. But
now te world has a new image _ reflecting a new reality _ that of
Germans, East and West, pulling each other to the top of the wall _
a human bridge between nations. Entire peoples all across Eastern
Europe, bravely taking to the streets demanding liberty _ talking
democracy. This is not the end of the book of history, but it is a
joyful end to one of history's saddest chapters.
   Not long after the wall began to open, West German Chancellor
Kohl telephoned, and he asked me to give you, the American people,
a message of thanks. He said that the remarkable change in Eastern
Europe would not be taking place without the steadfast support of
the United States. Fitting praise from a good friend. For 40 years,
we have not wavered in our commitment to freedom. We are grateful
to our American men and women in uniform. We should also be
grateful to our postwar leaders. You see, we helped rebuild a
continent through the Marshall Plan, and we built a shield, NATO,
behind which Americans, Europeans could forge a future in freedom.
   For so many of these 40 years, the test of Western resolve, the
contest between the free and the unfree, has been symbolized by an
island of hope behind the Iron Curtain: Berlin.

   The B-2 Stealth bomber
flew its eighth test flight Wednesday, just four days after a
lengthy test, the Air Force announced.
   The five-hour, 48-minute mission tested flight control and
structural systems, part of a series of tests intended to verify
the bomber's operational characteristics, an Air Force statement
said.
   On Saturday, the bomber flew for seven hours, 17 minutes.
   The pilots Wednesday were identified as Air Force test pilot Lt.
Col. John Small and Northrop Corp. test pilot Leroy Schroeder.
   The strategic bomber lifted off from Edwards Air Force Base in
the Mojave Desert at 8:13 a.m. and landed at 2:01 p.m.
   The B-2 was designed to evade radar detection through the use of
composite materials and countoured surfaces, which absorb radar
signals instead of reflecting them to receiving stations.
   The bomber, which is capable of delivering nuclear and
conventional weapons, is intended to replace the nation's fleet of
aging B-52 supersonic bombers.
   An Air Force spokesman did not immediately return a telephone
call seeking more detail about the Wednesday flight.

<TEXT>
   The government-appointed People's
Power Assembly on Wednesday elected Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega to
his first major civilian post, as national coordinator of the
lawmaking body.
   Noriega is military chief and as such the country's most
powerful individual. The new position allows him to officially call
special sessions and assume functions assigned to him by the
510-member assembly.
   The assembly also declared a state of general alert and asked
provisional President Francisco Rodriguez to declare a state of
national urgency because of the political crisis here.
   The People's Power Assembly was designated to replace the
National Assembly after Noriega had Rodriguez installed as
president on Sept. 1, when the previous civilian government's term
expired.
   May elections were annulled when it became apparent Noriega
opponents were winning.
   The General State Council, which includes the Cabinet and top
military officers, gave the assembly authorization on Nov. 9 to
elect a national coodinator who was not a member.
   Noriega was chosen because it ``is fundamental to make political
decisions that guarantee the permanence of the republic and the
national sovereignty,'' the assembly resolution said.
   Assembly member Ramon Ashby said in proposing Noriega that he
should be a spokesman and defender of the assembly.
   The Panama City city council late Tuesday unanimously agreed to
ask the General State Council to name Noriega chief of government.
   The United States has been applying political and economic
pressure to force Noriega to quit as military chief since February
1988, when Noriega was indicted on federal drug trafficking charges
in Florida.
   Noriega denies the charges. He calls them a U.S. attempt to
avoid complying with the 1977 Panama Canal Treaties, which require
the United States to turn over control of the waterway to Panama at
the end of 1999.

<HEAD>Douglas, Architect of New Zealand's Economic Reforms, to Resign</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WELLINGTON, New Zealand (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Roger Douglas, a former finance
minister who engineered sweeping economic changes in New Zealand
the past five years, announced Thursday he plans to retire from
politics.
   Douglas, who this month marks 20 years as a member of
Parliament, said he would resign after the next election, scheduled
for October 1990. He is 51.
   Under Prime Minister David Lange, Douglas revolutionized what
was one of the world's most regulated economies by removing import
protection, cutting income taxes, introducing a consumption tax and
imposing management systems on the public sector.
   When Lange and Douglas publicly feuded over the pace of economic
reform, Lange ousted Douglas from the Cabinet last December.
Douglas retaliated by campaigning against Lange and he was
reinstated in August as Minister for Police and Immigration.
   Lange then resigned as prime minister that same month and was
succeeded by Geoffrey Palmer.
   ``I think the time has come for me to pursue a career other than
politics,'' Douglas said. ``I have decided to make this
announcement now because the Labor Party is calling for nominations
and that process will close in January.
   ``If I stayed here, and as I said I still believe I've got a
contribution to make here, I would really in three or six years be
locked in here for another 10 or something like that and I just
didn't want that to occur,'' he said in a statement.
   Palmer said Douglas was responsible for making bold, innovative
decisions that provided a solid future for this island nation's
economic growth.
   He said future generations would view Douglas' term as finance
minister as one of the periods of greatest change in modern New
Zealand.

   A major abortion-rights case that the state
attorney general feared would be used by the U.S. Supreme Court to
restrict abortions has been settled, the state announced Wednesday.
   The settlement would guarantee women continued access to
abortions in Illinois, said Dr. Bernard Turnock, director of the
Illinois Department of Public Health.
   Attorney General Neil Hartigan said for the settlement to stand,
the high court would have to delay a scheduled hearing in the case
and refer it back to the U.S. District Court in Chicago, which
would have to approve the settlement.
   ``We have reached the goal we set at the beginning of our
negotiations,'' Hartigan said. ``The principals in this case ...
have created a system that protects a woman's health and safety
while exercising her right of choice.''
   Hartigan and some abortion rights forces had feared that without
a settlement, the Supreme Court might use the case to completely
overturn its 1973 Roe vs. Wade decision, which legalized abortion.
   The settlement proposes to resolve a legal challenge to Illinois
regulations that set elaborate rules for building codes and other
requirements for abortion clinics.
   Turnock said at a news conference that the settlement will
``refine or refocus'' the current regulations governing abortion
clinics ``to dispense with those that are unnecessary,
inappropriate or excessive.''
   Ann-Louise Lohr, staff counsel to the Americans United for Life
Legal Defense Fund, said the anti-abortion group was ``extremely
disappointed'' that Hartigan didn't let the case go to the Supreme
Court.
   She called the settlement a ``backroom deal that will compromise
the ability of all states to protect the health and safety of
women.''
   But Molly Yard, president of the National Organization for
Women, said, ``I think it is very clear that Neil Hartigan has read
the message of the majority of voters on the whole question of the
right of a woman to control her reproductive'' choices.
   The agreement will modify Illinois abortion-clinic regulations
challenged in 1985 by Dr. Richard Ragsdale of Rockford, who was
represented by the American Civil Liberties Union of Illinois.
   Ragsdale, who had lost his lease in his building and been unable
to find new office space that met the old codes, argued that the
requirements for non-hospital surgical centers were medically
unnecessary and forced him to build the equivalent of a small
hospital for a simple procedure.
   He maintained the regulations were a veiled attempt by the
Illinois Department of Public Health and Turnock to restrict
women's access to abortion in the state.
   Four years ago, Ragsdale won a preliminary injunction against
Illinois' existing regulations in U.S. District Court in Chicago.
Barred from enforcing the regulations, Turnock and Hartigan's
office appealed, arguing that the rules are necessary to protect
women's health.
   In 1987, the U.S. 7th Circuit Court of Appeals sided with
Ragsdale, upholding the lower court's ruling and agreeing that the
regulations place an unconstitutional restriction on women's right
to undergo abortion.
   The requirements include 250-square-foot surgical rooms, some
corridor widths of eight feet, lounges, lockers and separate
toilets for male and female employees and a janitor's closet
adjoining the surgical suite.
   Under the modified rules, abortion clinics would not be required
to modify their buildings in any significant way, said ACLU
attorney Colleen K. Connell.
   ``Will the price of an abortion go up?'' she asked. ``No.''
   In addition, abortions will continue to be performed by private
physicians in their offices, by doctors at walk-in surgical clinics
and by physicians at full-service hospitals, officials said.
   But walk-in surgical centers that perform abortions as their
sole or majority business will be subject to inspections beginning
as early as next year by the Department of Public Health, Turnock
said.
   Surgical centers whose sole business is abortions will be
limited to performing them before the 18th week of pregnancy.
Surgical centers licensed to perform both abortions and other
outpatient procedures may perform them after 18 weeks, he said.
   The U.S. Supreme Court had agreed to hear the case on July 3,
and had scheduled oral arguments for Dec. 5.
   Abortion rights groups have said that if the Supreme Court
upheld the rules for Illinois, other states might take it as a
signal to adopt similar restrictions.
   A survey released last week indicated 98 percent of abortion
clinics nationwide would be violating at least one of the Illinois
rules if they were adopted by the clinics' home states.
   Three-fourths of the clinics said the regulation would force
them to relocate and could drive them out of business, according to
the National Abortion Federation and Planned Parenthood, the groups
that released the results.
   ``With the agreement reached today,'' Hartigan said, ``we
believe that we now have a system that addresses the public health
concerns relating to abortions performed in ambulatory surgical
clinics.''
   The Supreme Court is also expected to rule in July on an Ohio
law that requires doctors to notify one parent of unmarried, minor
girls before performing abortions.

   The leaders of Eastern Airlines pilots union
voted Wednesday to end their bitter sympathy strike and notified
the company they were ready to return to work.
   The abrupt decision, eight months into a strike by the carrier's
Machinists union, deals a severe blow to both the Machinists and
organized labor, which has used the pilots support of the strike as
a symbol of its newfound solidarity.
   Wayne Dolan, an Eastern pilot and spokesman for the Air Line
Pilots Association, said the union's 20-member Master Executive
Council for Eastern made the decision at a meeting in Reston, a
suburb of Washington.
   He said the union would notify Eastern management the pilots
were ready to return to work. Eastern has been hiring replacement
pilots and using the union pilots who crossed picket lines and it
was not immediately clear whether it would welcome the striking
pilots back.
   Technically, under the Railway Labor Act which governs airline
contract disputes, only the Machinists are on strike. The pilots
and Eastern's union flight attendants have been honoring Machinist
pickets in legal sympathy strikes.
   The airline has replaced many of the 3,600 pilots who went on
strike March 4 with non-union pilots, and Eastern said Wednesday
there were no jobs for the strikers _ 2,250 remaining as of
Wednesday _ to return to.
   John Peterpaul, vice president of the International Association
of Machinists, said in a telephone interview late Wednesday,
``We're not calling this thing off.''
   ``What they (the pilots) do is their affair,'' he said.
   Eastern said in a statement issued at its Miami headquarters:
``It's a very interesting development. Our only regret is that it
didn't come earlier and we could have avoided all the trauma that
has come to Eastern Airlines.''
   Eastern said returning pilots ``will be recalled as jobs come
open in the future'' and invited them to sign the recall list.
There airline has 1,800 pilots currently.
   The Machinists went on strike after refusing to agree to a
demand for $150 million in concessions on wages, work rules and
other subjects by Frank Lorenzo, chairman of Eastern's parent
company, Texas Air Corp. The Machinists said later they would agree
to similar or greater concessions if Lorenzo would sell Eastern,
but sale attempts have fallen through.
   The stunning decision by the pilots union came a day after
President Bush vetoed a bill that would have created a special
congressional panel to investigate the strike and propose a
solution.
   Congress can't try to override the veto until it reconvenes in
two months. Peterpaul said he thought there was a good chance
Congress would vote to override.
   ALPA President Henry Duffy spoke to the Eastern council meeting.
Duffy last week was denied a seat on the AFL-CIO Executive Council
after narrowly missing being chosen for a vacancy two years ago. He
was said to be irate at not being chosen, particularly because of
the support ALPA has given the Machinists.
   Sources who attended the meeting said Duffy endorsed a return to
work.
   The pilots union has a history of crossing the picket lines of
other unions, limiting the effectiveness of airline strikes. But it
stood with the Machinists until Wednesday, though more than 200
pilots had returned to work on their own, according to Eastern and
union officials.
   ``The decision to return to work was the most difficult decision
we have had to make since Eastern was acquired by Texas Air
Corp.,'' said Skip Copeland, head of ALPA's Eastern Master
Executive Council.
   Copeland blamed Bush's veto for the decision, saying it left the
pilots with little choice but to return to work because prospects
for a settlement of the Machinists strike in the near future were
virtually non-exisstent.
   Copeland said the decision ``is a best a small victory'' for
Eastern and Lorenzo, but it in fact should give Eastern more than
enough pilots to complete its planned reorganization.
   Copeland replaced Jack Bavis in August, who was recalled by the
membership after he endorsed a return to work then.
   Eastern, which filed for bankruptcy protections five days after
the strike began, has been rebuilding by hiring replacement
workers, and pilot shortages and training problems have been the
biggest personnel problem.
   However, it was not clear that pilot shortages were now a
problem. ``They've got all the pilot they need,'' said Paul Karos,
airline analyst at First Boston Corp. ``The strike has been mainly
symbolic.''
   Copeland said the pilots have been instructed to contact the
company about returning to work.
   ``The time has come now to go back, rebuild Eastern and get on
with our lives and professions,'' Copeland said.
   The White House announced the veto at 11:35 p.m. Tuesday; the
measure would have become law at midnight had Bush not acted by
then. In his veto message, Bush said Congress, which would have
conducted the investigation, had no business interfering in the
contract and court disputes over the 8-month-old strike. He refused
in March to use his power to block the strike by naming an
emergency mediation board.
   Lorenzo, in a letter to Bush, praised the president for having
the political courage to veto the measure and ``a clear vision of
the need to keep the airline industry competitive.''
   But the president's action prompted stinging attacks from
Eastern's unions, which pointedly recalled Bush's remarks to the
AFL-CIO convention last week praising the role of unions in
promoting democracy and workers' rights abroad.
   ``There, he expressed concern for working men and women and
their families,'' said George Kourpias, president of the
Machinists. ``By vetoing the Eastern bill, he kicked a large
segment of those workers in the teeth.''
   The unions accused Bush of supporting what they deem as efforts
by Lorenzo to use the bankruptcy protection to reorganize Eastern
as a non-union carrier.
   ``By failing to sign the Eastern bill, the president embraced
the meanest, worker-hating boss in the nation, Frank Lorenzo,''
said George Kourpias, president of the Machinists union.
   ``The president has dropped any pretense of fairness and chosen
sides with Frank Lorenzo, a symbol of the worst type of American
employer,'' the AFL-CIO said in a statement that called the veto
``a strong message to every working American that the president is
not on their side.''

   Two more children died Wednesday as a result
of the tornado that smashed down a cafeteria wall at East Coldenham
Elementary School during lunch, bringing the death toll to nine.
   Mark Flanagan, 7, was declared dead about 8:30 p.m. at
Westchester County Medical Center in Valhalla, where the boy had
been in critical condition since the tornado struck last Thursday.
   ``His condition had been deteriorating over the last couple of
days. It was not good to begin with,'' said hospital spokesman
Barry Bowman.The boy was declared brain dead after a series of
tests Wednesday, Bowman said.
   ``I personally am brokenhearted over this,'' Bowman said. ``It's
been a terrible tragedy, but perhaps this is the end of it, I
hope.''
   Earlier, 8-year-old Jennifer Homan died at the Albany Medical
Center Hospital, said hospital spokesman Elmer Streeter.
   He described the cause of death as ``brain death secondary to
multiple trauma.'' He would not discuss whether the child had been
on life support systems.
   Jennifer had been in critical condition since she was
transferred from St. Luke's Hospital in Newburgh the day of the
tornado, Nov. 16. The school is located about five miles west of
Newburgh and about 60 miles north of New York City.
   Gov. Mario Cuomo, meanwhile, ordered an investigation into the
disaster. The state will secure building records and debris from
the cafeteria wall to determine if structural flaws contributed to
the eight deaths, he said.
   Cuomo said engineering experts would be hired to see whether the
school, which was built in 1962 and renovated in 1984, could have
been better constructed to withstand the tornado.
   ``The state is determined to do all that it can to prevent
another tragedy like that which occurred at the East Coldenham
Elementary School last week,'' Cuomo said. ``The steps that I have
taken today will help assure that this process moves ahead
thoroughly and expeditiously.''
   Sixteen other children were injured when the tornado struck.
Nine remained hospitalized Wednesday, with their conditions ranging
from fair to good, spokesmen at three hospitals said Wednesday.
   Funerals for the seven other youngsters killed were held
Saturday and Monday.

<HEAD>Bush Calls on Gorbachev to Help `Once and For All End Cold War'</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   President Bush on Wednesday hailed the
dramatic changes sweeping Eastern Europe as ``a joyful end to one
of history's saddest chapters,'' and urged Soviet President Mikhail
S. Gorbachev to work with him at next week's summit and beyond to
``once and for all end the Cold War.''
   In a Thanksgiving-eve speech broadcast to the nation from Camp
David, Bush said he would seek assurances from Gorbachev that the
process of reform will continue in Eastern Europe.
   ``And we will give him our assurance that America welcomes this
reform not as an adversary seeking advantage but as a people
offering support,'' Bush said. ``Our goal is to see this historic
tide of freedom broadened, deepened and sustained.''
   The sweeping rhetoric made clear that Bush now sees the the
summit as going far beyond the relaxed, feet-up, get-acquainted
meeting that he originally envisioned. He pledged there would be
``no surprises sprung on our allies'' at the shipboard meeting in
the waters of the Mediterranean off Malta on Dec. 2 and 3.
   ``After all, the peoples of Europe are determining their own
future.''
   Bush delivered his remarks in a library-like setting, in front
of a fireplace, in Laurel Lodge, which houses his office at Camp
David as well as dining facilities.
   Bush spoke at a time of momentous events in Eastern Europe,
dramatized by the opening of the Berlin Wall _ a piece of which was
given him by a visiting West German official _ and the loosening of
hard-line Communist policies in East Germany, Hungary, Poland,
Czechoslovakia and Bulgaria. At home, critics have charged Bush
with being timid in responding to the reforms.
   Bush praised Gorbachev as ``the dynamic architect of Soviet
reform'' but he tempered his remarks by saying that Nicaragua and
Cuba retained authoritarian governments because of massive support
of weapons and supplies from their communist allies. Bush said he
would ask the Soviet leader to help bring freedom and democracy to
Latin America.
   ``So as we celebrate the events of Eastern Europe,'' Bush said,
``remember that some walls still remain between East and West.
There are the invisible walls of suspicion, the walls of doubt,
misunderstanding and miscalculation.''
   House Speaker Thomas S. Foley, interviewed on CNN after the
speech, said that in the past Bush appeared ``perhaps too detached
and too calm, too relaxed about things that are truly exciting.''
   ``But,'' he added, ``I think that .. Democrats now expect the
president to approach these historic issues with determination and
prudence.''
   Bush's speech marked the first time that the presidential
retreat in Maryland's Catoctin Mountains was used as the site of a
nationally televised address. The president is spending
Thanksgiving weekend at Camp David with his wife, Barbara.
   ``This will be a very special Thanksgiving,'' Bush said.
``Around the world tonight new pilgrims are on a voyage to freedom
and for many, it is not a trip to some far-away place, but to a
world of their own making.''
   Bush said that ``in a new Europe, the American role may change
in form but not in fundamentals.'' The United States has been the
guarantor of West European security since World War II.
   He said that even if U.S. and Soviet forces are significantly
reduced, as both superpowers have proposed, ``we will remain in
Europe as long as our friends want and need us.''
   Bush hailed Gorbachev as ``the dynamic architect of Soviet
reform'' and said that in Malta, ``I will assure him that there is
no greater advocate of perestroika than the president of the United
States.'' Perestroika is Gorbachev's beleaguered program to
restructure his country's faltering economy.
   Bush said that as the nation heads into a new decade, ``I am
reaching out to President Gorbachev, asking him to work with me to
bring down the last barriers to a new world of freedom.
   ``Let us move beyond containment, and once and for all end the
Cold War,'' Bush said.
   In his prepared text, Bush referred to ending ``cold war.''
   Gorbachev has opened the floodgates for the reform sweeping the
Soviet bloc. He said Tuesday that he favored a ``more rapid pace of
change'' in the region to make up for ``lost time.''
   Bush said that for the first time since the Berlin Wall was
erected in 1961, ``the world has a new image _ reflecting a new
reality _ that of Germans, East and West, pulling each other to the
top of the wall, a human bridge between nations.
   ``Entire peoples all across Eastern Europe, bravely taking to
the streets demanding liberty _ talking democracy. This is not the
end of the book of history, but it is a joyful end to one of
history's saddest chapters,'' the president said.
   Bush, however, did not address the issue of German reunification.
   He said that with the events in Eastern Europe, ``change is
coming swiftly. And with this change, the dramatic vindication of
free Europe's economic and political institutions; the new Europe
that is coming is being built _ must be built _ on the foundation
of democratic values.
   ``But the faster the pace, the smoother our path must be,'' Bush
said.
   Bush said that last May, he set down five points that the Soviet
Union should pursue that would ``inevitably result in improved
relations with the West.'' The Soviet Union has made progress in
each area, Bush said. ``That is undeniable.''
   The areas are reductions in Soviet forces, support for
self-determination in Eastern Europe, cooperation with the United
States to end regional disputes, respect for human rights and joint
efforts to address global problems such as the environment and the
drug epidemic.
   With the Soviet record and the changes in Eastern Europe in
mind, Bush said he invited Gorbachev to meet him in the
Mediterranean, a summit just 10 days away.
   ``This is a first meeting _ a time for exploration. It is not a
time for detailed arms control negotiations best left for next
year's summit,'' Bush said, referring to an expected late spring or
early summer summit in the United States.
   He said he hoped the Malta meeting would be ``a constructive act
_ guiding brave pilgrims on their journey to a new world of
freedom.''
   Earlier Wedneday, the president told reporters aboard Air Force
One that he was looking to the Malta summit with the ``Boy Scout
motto: Be prepared.''
   ``I've got a lot of homework to do,'' he said.
   Bush will hold pre-summit talks at Camp David with British Prime
Minister Margaret Thatcher on Friday as he continues his
preparations for his first meeting with Gorbachev as president.

<HEAD>Eight Amazon Nations Meet To Coordinate Jungle-Saving Policy</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BRASILIA, Brazil (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Environmental officials of eight South
American nations met Wednesday to try to find ways to stop
destruction of the Amazon rain forest, the world's largest
wilderness.
   Experts from Brazil, Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador, Guyana, Peru,
Suriname and Venezuela met in this capital city to coordinate
research projects, fund-raising plans and political strategies
related to Amazon protection.
   ``Everyone talks a lot about the environment but until now funds
have been scarce,'' said one Brazilian official at the meeting,
speaking on the condition of anonymity. ``Together, all eight
countries will be better able to finance these projects.''
   The Amazon Pact committee was founded in March in Quito,
Ecuador, amid international outcry over the devastation of the 8.68
million-square-mile Amazon jungle.
   Bolivia and Venezuela were among countries expressing interest
in strong measures to protect border rivers, contaminated by
mercury dumped by gold miners.
   Brazil's Foreign Ministry voiced interest in a project to
monitor jungle rivers and the impact the rain forest has in
altering weather patterns.
   Last year, illegal land clearing by farmers, ranchers,
prospectors and peasant settlers wrecked 55,350 square miles of
Brazil's 2 million-square-mile rain forest, according to the
government.
   The government estimates about 5 percent of Brazil's Amazon has
been destroyed. The World Bank estimates 12 percent of the
Brazilian jungle has been cut and burned.

<TEXT>
   The General Assembly adopted a resolution
Wednesday deploring West Germany's becoming South Africa's leading
trade partner and criticizing it for allegedly letting the
apartheid state obtain blueprints for submarines.
   In passing 12 anti-apartheid resolutions, the assembly also
criticized Chile and Israel for their military trade with the
Pretoria government.
   The United States and Britain voted against most of the
resolutions, calling them unbalanced and unconstructive. Western
European nations joined them in opposing some measures.
   One resolution passed by consensus supported the right of the
South African people to reach a negotiated political settlement
with South Africa's government to end racial conflict.
   The other resolutions contained more controversial elements.
Each received dozens more votes than required for passage, through
the backing of the more than 100 votes of the non-aligned movement.
   Key provisions of the 12 resolutions include:
   _A call for all nations to cut off trade, banking, investment,
cultural and sports links with South Africa.
   _Criticism of West Germany ``which recently emerged as the
leading trading partner of South Africa.'' No figures were given,
but the United States, Japan and Britain also were high on the list.
   _Condemnation of ``the collaboration of Israel with the racist
minority regime of South Africa in the military and nuclear
fields.'' Israel has been accused of helping Pretoria develop a
medium-range missile and nuclear technology that could be used to
make weapons.
   _Castigating West Germany, ``which allowed the provision by two
corporations based on its territory to South Africa of blueprints
for the manufacture of submarines and other related military
material.''
   _Criticism of Chile, ``which has become an important outlet for
the sale of South Africa's military hardware.''
   _Concern over ``arbitrary detentions and trials, including those
of woman and children, executions of political prisoners, the
ongoing use of vigilante groups and the stifling of the press.
   _Demands for release of ``all political prisoners and detainees,
especially children.''
   _Demands for immediate release of Nelson Mandela, the African
National Congress leader serving a life prison term for plotting
sabotage.
   _Demands for withdrawal of troops from black townships in South
Africa.
   South Africa's assembly voting rights were suspended in 1974 for
failing to heed calls for the abolition of apartheid.
   A West German U.N. representative said his country has prevented
any further blueprints from reaching South Africa that would have
provided information needed to make a submarine operational. The
South African navy said in August that it had shelved plans to
build its own subs.

   Los Angeles Daily News on senators and the S&amp;L crisis:
   If Sen. Alan Cranston, D-Calif., is ... wondering why people
question his integrity, he need look no further than his own
contradictory statements about allegations that he and four other
senators attempted to interfere with a federal probe of Lincoln
Savings and Loan.
   As recently as last Thursday (Nov. 16), Cranston contended that
he and three other senators _ Dennis DeConcini, D-Ariz., John
Glenn, D-Ohio, and John McCain, R-Ariz., met with Edwin J. Gray,
then chairman of the Federal Home Loan Bank Board, on April 2,
1987, merely to urge Gray to bring a lengthy investigation of
Lincoln to a close, not to influence its outcome. (Sen. Donald W.
Riegle Jr., D-Mich., also intervened in Lincoln's behalf but did
not attend that particular meeting.)
   Gray's subordinates in the San Francisco office recommended that
Lincoln be shut down. ... (Instead) ... a decision to seize the
failing thrift was delayed for two years. ...
   Cranston's most recent statement about the meeting with Gray
seems to contradict his comments last month that he and the other
senators, all of whom received large contributions from Lincoln
Chairman Charles H. Keating Jr., ``may well have'' discussed a
regulation limiting Lincoln's investments in speculative land
deals, junk bonds and other risky ventures. ...
   He (Cranston) contended, in a letter to the Senate Ethics
Committee ..., that he was simply trying to help a constituent
(California-based Lincoln) who felt he was being hassled by the
feds. ``Most important, Mr. Keating never received from me any
reason to believe that those contributions were in exchange for my
help with the Federal Home Loan Bank Board, or with anybody else,''
said the senator. ...
   Cranston and his colleagues seemed to be doing all that Keating
could have asked, with the possible exception of buying his S&amp;L.
That unfortunate task was left to the taxpayers, who must now fork
over at least $2.5 billion in liquidation costs to pay for the mess
that the senators helped create.

   Independent, Marshall, Minn., on alcoholic beverage container
labels:
   Cans of beer, and bottles of beer, liquor and wine are looking a
little different nowadays. Nov. 18 was the effective date of a
federal rule requiring health warnings on all alcoholic-beverage
containers sold in the United States. The requirement was part of
the Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1988.
   Superseding any state laws on the subject, the rule says labels
must carry the message: Government warning: (1) According to the
Surgeon General, women should not drink alcoholic beverages during
pregnancy because of the risk of birth defects. (2) Consumption of
alcoholic beverages impairs your ability to drive a car or operate
machinery, and may cause health problems.
   It's all part of the Big Brother syndrome infesting Washington,
which finds bureaucrats and politicians falling all over themselves
to watch out for us. Can there be any person in America old enough
to consume alcoholic beverages legally who is not aware of the
dangers of driving after drinking? Of course not.
   Can there be any pregnant woman nowadays who is unaware of the
health toll exacted by fetal alcohol syndrome? The answer is the
same.
   Technically speaking, the rule ... is only temporary. The (U.S.
Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms) has yet to issue a final
rule, which may or may not differ from the one that is attracting
so much flak.
   Either way, it will demonstrate that Big Brother is, indeed,
watching closely over us.

   The House of Commons has a reputation for being rowdy and

   That is quite different from the image viewers get of

   The Communist Party on Wednesday offered to
hold talks with rival political groups on free elections and other
reforms demanded during weeks of anti-government protests.
Opposition leaders agreed.
   Also Wednesday, a member of the ruling Politburo said the
Communists' guarantee of a leading role in government affairs is
unfair and should be abolished.
   The ``dogmatic, distorted model of the political system should
be changed in theory as well as practice,'' Poliburo member
Wolfgang Herger said at a public lecture. His comments were the
strongest indication to date that the Communists acknowledge the
inequity of a constitutional mandate to rule.
   At the same time, Communist Party leader Egon Krenz said the
Communists won't be pushed around by the opposition and he has no
intention of stepping down, the official ADN news agency reported.
   In a Thanksgiving-eve speech, President Bush called recent
changes in East Germany and other Soviet bloc countries ``a joyful
end to one of history's saddest chapters.'' He spoke of East
Germany's opening of the Berlin Wall but did not address the issue
of possible German reunification.
   The offer of talks from the ruling Politburo was vague about who
could take part and did not set a date for negotiations.
   Elke Guenther of New Forum, the biggest opposition group, said
in response: ``We have wanted to talk to the Communist party for
years. And there certainly are enough things to talk about.''
   Lutheran Bishop Gottfried Forck said he expected the pro-reform
group Democracy Now to organize opposition involvement. Rainer
Eppelmann, of the Democratic Awakening group, said his group had
not received an invitation to take part.
   Talks between Communists and the opposition in Poland led this
year to formation of a government there not led by Communists _ the
first in the East bloc.
   Krenz, who serves as both party leader and head of state, told
workers at a factory on the outskirts of East Berlin the party will
keep its grip on the nation's factories _ a traditional source of
local control _ and won't let itself be pushed ``up against the
wall'' by the opposition.
   ``I didn't take over to push for change just for four weeks,''
ADN quoted Krenz as saying.
   Krenz replaced his mentor, Erich Honecker, on Oct. 18, after the
worst unrest in the nation's 40-year history and the exodus of tens
of thousands of East Germans dissatisfied with years of stringent
rule.
   The government Wednesday ordered a ban on taking antiques or
consumer goods out of the country, ADN said. No details were given,
but the order appeared to be the first step toward halting the
drain on the economy caused by East Germans taking heirlooms and
state-subsidized goods to the West to sell for hard currency.
   The offer to meet with the opposition was one of the Communists'
most significant concessions in the current unrest, which began in
September and has grown to include protests by hundreds of
thousands of people across the country.
   More than 100,000 East Germans left the country this month
alone, testifying to continued dissatisfaction despite the opening
of the Berlin Wall and lifting of travel restrictions.
   Krenz's long partnership with Honecker and other Communists now
suspected of having lined their pockets at public expense has
tainted the new leadership and damaged the party chief's
credibility.
   Before the Politburo offer, Manfred Gerlach of the Liberal
Democratic Party, long aligned with the Communists, said fledgling
opposition groups such as New Forum deserve recognition and a
greater voice in making decisions.
   Ms. Guenther and other opposition leaders, however, were
suspicious of his motives, having long suspected the Liberal
Democrats of trying to establish themselves as the main opposition
force.
   ``We are profoundly skeptical of the changes claimed by the
established parties,'' Ms. Guenther said. ``Manfred Gerlach has
long been a functionary within the government that has been
discredited.''
   Hans-Dieter Raspe, Gerlach's deputy, told ADN the Liberal
Democrats aspire to the presidency in the first free elections,
which some expect as soon as next spring.
   Gerlach, at his first open news conference, said opposition
groups should be allowed to compete with the Communists.
   ``This should be done both for the benefit of political
pluralism and also to get as wide a range of participation as
possible in deciding a future course,'' Gerlach said.
   He pressed the Communists to relinquish their constitutional
mandate for a ``leading role'' in the government, blaming their
40-year monopoly for economic decline and loss of public trust.
   The Communists meet in a special party congress Dec. 15-17, and
Krenz may be challenged if his popularity does not improve.
   ``I am concerned about proposals to have the delegates directly
elect the general secretary,'' Krenz said Wednesday, indicating
opposition to congress procedures that could bring in party members
whose backing is uncertain.
   Under the current procedures, delegates are elected by local
party organizations, and the delegates vote in a new 163-member
Central Committee. The Central Committee in turn chooses a party
leader.
   Under pressure to earn their posts in competitive elections,
top-ranking Communists have reportedly splintered into groups that
advocate differing paces of democratic change.
   Some have also begun shunning privileges they've enjoyed for
years, such as exclusive villas, as opposition demands for criminal
investigations of former leaders are heeded.
   The West German newspaper Bild reported Wednesday that
Honecker's former deputy, ousted Politburo member Guenter Mittag,
was interrogated for 14 hours last week about reports he stashed
hundreds of millions of marks in Swiss banks.

   Canadian filmmaker Harvey Hart, who directed
episodes of ``Columbo'' and such television miniseries as ``East of

attack on Tuesday, aged 61.
   Hart won a Golden Globe Award for ``East of Eden,'' an

   His Canadian movies included ``Fortune and Men's Eyes'' and his
U.S. work included the pilots for the series ``Judd for the

   Producer Victor Solnicki, who developed several projects with
Hart, said the Toronto-born filmmaker ``was proudest of his work
during the golden years of CBC-TV drama. He was one of the first 12

<HEAD>Lawyers Say Evidence Supports Claims About Death Squads</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GREG MYRE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Lawyers said Wednesday they
have evidence backing allegations by a former policeman who says he
was part of an authorized death squad that assassinated
anti-apartheid activists.
   The lawyers also said authorities were not vigorously pursuing
the charges by ex-policeman Butana Nofomela and two former
colleagues, who all admit to participating in police killings in
South Africa and neighboring countries.
   ``After only a brief investigation into allegations made by
Nofomela, it would appear that significant corroboration exists
(for) certain of the allegations,'' said Peter Harris of the
Lawyers for the Independent Board of Inquiry into Informal
Repression, a private firm.
   Nofomela admitted being a death squad member in an affidavit
signed Oct. 19, the night before he was scheduled to hang for a
murder that had no political overtones.
   Nofomela, who has acknowledged involvement in at least eight
police killings, has been granted a temporary stay of execution.
   Police have denied the existence of a death squad but have
appointed a commission to investigate.
   Police Gen. Herman Stadler, in an interview on government
television, said it was possible policemen could have carried out
illegal actions without the knowledge of their superiors.
   He said police took the death squad allegations seriously and
intended ``to get to the kernal of the matter.''
   Last week, former police Capt. Dirk Coetzee said he had been a
commander of a death squad and ex-constable David Tshikalange said
he also was a member. Both men have fled South Africa.
   All three ex-policemen have said they carried out the killings
based on orders from their superiors.
   ``While Nofomela's recollection of certain dates may be
inaccurate, the substance of his allegations remain,'' said Brian
Currin, a lawyer for the board.
   The board said their evidence backs Nofomela's claims that he
was present at four separate incidents from 1981 to 1985 in which
eight activists were killed.
   They include:
   _ the slaying of black lawyer Griffith Mxenge in 1981.
   _ a 1983 raid on a home in Swaziland that resulted in the deaths
of two suspected African National Congress guerrillas.
   _ the 1985 murder of security guard Japie Moponye, whose brother
was linked to the ANC.
   _ a 1985 shooting near Durban that left four activists dead.
   All the cases are unsolved.
   Police have denied the existence of a death squad, but have
appointed a commission to investigate.
   The private lawyers met Wednesday with the two men heading the
commission, Police Lt. Gen. Alwyn Conradie, and the attorney
general of the Orange Free State Province, T.P. McNally.
   The lawyers provided the commission with evidence they have
gathered in their investigation, including information showing
Nofomela carried four passports with four separate identities.
   The lawyers said they understood that the four passports were
standard issue for security police and allowed them to travel to
neighboring countries without being identified.
   ``What is apparent to me is that certain very important leads
appear not to have been pursued as they should have,'' Harris said.
   The official commission says it hopes to complete its
investigation by the end of November. President F.W. de Klerk is
not expected to comment on the case until he reviews a report by
Law and Order Minister Adriaan Vlok.
   Almost all the country's leading newspapers, including those
that support the government, have called for a public judicial
investigation.

   Deposits of surplus food at the nation's food banks have
declined this year as the ranks of bank patrons _ the poor and
hungry _ continue to grow.
   The federal government and private corporations are donating
less food to private charities than in the past, according to food
bank officials in several cities.
   At the same time, said Kevin Fagan, director of development for
the Greater Philadelphia Food Bank, ``There's no question that
demand is just flying through the ceiling.''
   Food bankers blame the decline, in part, on a frenzied pace of
corporate takeovers that have left food industry executives glued

   Gary Bennett considers himself a
lifesaver, trying to rescue babies from poverty and disease in
Central America.
   Carol Bogart, who paid Bennett more than $5,000 for a little
girl he never delivered, sees him as a false hero.
   ``I'm angry,'' said Bogart, 40, of Denver. ``I'm angry about
what she went through, and her mother. Who knows what that woman
thinks or believes?''
   After almost two years, Bennett hasn't completed a single
adoption, and the state has shut down his agency because he
allegedly violated adoption rules.
   Bennett concedes he bit off ``more than I could chew'' and says
he counted too much on friends who liked the idea but couldn't help
carry it out. His good intentions, he says, were thwarted by red
tape, lack of money and naivete.
   ``The only reason that I started this was the children ... not
for me, but for these people, so their babies won't die.''
   Bennett first took an interest in the Miskito Indians in 1984
after he left his $83,000-a-year air-conditioning repair business
in suburban Fort Worth and ``sought a thrill'' training Nicaraguan
Contra rebels. A friend invited him to see the Miskito Coast, a
225-mile-long strip of jungle along the Honduras and Nicaragua
coast with poverty so bad ``you're not human if you can ignore it.''
   He said he began taking food and arranging aid shipments to the
Miskitos in 1985. He sought help from the federal government and
obtained medical visas for four sick, malnourished children.
   ``There are four children who will have good lives because of
him,'' said David Sowders. Sowders and his wife, Denise, became
foster parents of abandoned twins Bennett brought from a military
hospital on the Honduras border in 1985.
   ``The nurse came to Gary and said `Would you please do what you
can for these kids?' and so Gary went, found their father and got
permission to bring them out on medical visa,'' said Sowders, a
Dallas Times Herald editor.
   The Sowderses paid for the twins' medical care and are in the
process of adopting them. Bennett helped them look in Nicaragua for
the twins' father to get him to relinquish custody.
   Bennett, a 42-year-old divorced father of four, became the
foster parent of another of the four children, a Nicaraguan girl
named Angie, now 3. He recently received the final custody
relinquishment documents from the girl's father, and said that the
adoption is in its final stages.
   The fourth child is with another Dallas couple, Bennett said.
   Because of his work with the four children, friends urged him to
start an adoption agency, and in late 1987 he got a provisional
license from the Texas Department of Human Services for the
non-profit Mosquitia Coast Child Find Inc.
   The provisional license gave the agency six months to prove
itself by completing an adoption in order to get a regular,
biennial license. The state twice extended the license but in
September refused another because Bennett had failed to place a
child with permanent, adoptive parents and apparently had bent
regulations, Human Services officials said.
   Carol Bogart was one of about 75 people who contacted Mosquitia
Coast seeking children, Bennett says now, though at one point he
told state officials that ``thousands'' had called him. Fewer than
10 people were interviewed by social workers connected with the
agency, Bennett said.
   Bogart, who already had a 4-year-old son, Michael, paid $5,200
in adoption deposits and fees and $2,000 to an agency that was to
evaluate her suitability. In return, Bennett promised he'd bring
her a little girl in November 1988. Then he said he was certain it
would be December.
   ``The rest of December came and went,'' she said. ``I was
calling them frantically, constantly ... They said, `No question,
you will have this baby for Christmas.''' In the months that
followed, ``They were still stringing me along and sending me the
pictures. I was worried about what was happening to her, what kind
of shape she was in, and was she being taken care of properly.
   ``You get so hooked into it that you just can barely stand to
give it up. I couldn't invest myself emotionally in it anymore. And
Michael was just having a terrible time. He had been waiting for a
baby sister for months.''
   Bennett said the adoption fell through when his assistant and
girlfriend, Pat Nealy, was jailed for a day in Tegucigalpa,
Honduras, because of questions over Kyla Sue's nationality. A
travel document Nealy and Bennett obtained for the girl showed she
was born in Nicaragua. But in an affidavit relinquishing parental
rights, the girl's mother said the child was born in Tegucigalpa.
   Bogart accused Bennett of trying to circumvent stricter Honduran
adoption laws by passing Kyla Sue off as Nicaraguan.
   The Department of Human Services investigated her claim last
summer, but could not validate it. But the department said
Mosquitia Coast failed to meet several regulations, including
providing records and properly training staff.
   The state had criticized Bennett earlier for bringing the four
children into the United States on medical visas when he intended
to have them adopted.
   Bennett says his problems are political. ``Our State Department
says one thing and what they actually do is another. I'm just one
man. We haven't placed any. We're just banging our heads against
the wall.''
   Case records show that the most serious state allegations
against Mosquitia Coast involved its inability to retain a
professional social worker and Bennett and Nealy's competence to
counsel parents giving up their children.
   Donna Parrish, the Human Services licensing official assigned to
Bennett's agency, declined to discuss Bennett's qualifications, but
said: ``Child-placing is very complicated. It's very difficult for
professionals to become involved in it and go through it in the way
that it needs to be done, let alone someone with no background it.''
   The final report on the agency indicates two families withdrew
applications they had filed with Mosquitia Coast as it went out of
business, and several other families were referred to other
agencies.
   Bogart's is the only complaint on file with Human Services.
Bennett said he will return her money.
   Kyla Sue and three other children are at a ``safe house'' in
Tegucigalpa, he said. They are his foster children in the
government's eyes, but can't leave because adoptive parents must be
lined up for each child, he said, adding he hesitates to look for
permanent homes for them because he doesn't want to appear to be
operating an illegal adoption service.
   Sowders believes Bennett will be better off taking help to the
Miskito than bringing children out. ``I saw firsthand how hard it
is to get one tiny thing done,'' he said. ``It took more resources
and help than he had available.''

   Tom Skerritt and Max von Sydow are two Cold
War adversaries who form a reluctant partnership to prevent an
assassination in the HBO movie ``Red King, White Knight.''
   Skerritt is Bill Stoner, a former CIA agent and recovered
alcoholic, and von Sydow is Szaz, a retired Eastern bloc
intelligence agent, in this taut and interesting thriller that
premieres Saturday on Home Box Office. It was filmed on location in
Budapest, Hungary, which gives it a bleak atmosphere that enhances
the suspense.
   American officials hear of plans by the KGB to assassinate the
Soviet general secretary and send Stoner to verify its validity.
Stoner is selected for ``deniability'' in case he's discovered
because he's no longer an agent.
   ``This appealed to me because it's told on two levels,'' said
Skerritt. ``One level is the story of man trying to rehabilitate
himself after the suicide of his wife and his alcoholism. On the
other level, he knows the identity of the man who will attempt to
assassinate the Soviet leader.
   ``As happens so often with people in politics, the American
officials debate whether to tell the Russians until Stoner and Szaz
are forced to take matters into their own hands.''
   ``Red King, White Knight'' is representative of a new wave of
political thrillers in which the Soviets are no longer completely
the enemy.
   ``Stoner is angry, withdrawn and less adventurous,'' said
Skerritt. ``He was probably once an ultraconservative politically,
but all he's gone through and the changes in the past 10 years has
probably changed his philosophy. He's at a time when he's trying to
recapture his life and self-esteem. He hopes this assignment will
bring back his sense of self-worth.''
   He also runs into an old love interest, Anna, played by Helen
Mirren. After their last encounter, Anna was sent to prison.
   Skerritt can be seen in the feature movie ``Steel Magnolias,''
in which he plays Sally Field's husband and Julia Roberts' father.
He made that a year ago in Natchitoches, La., and since then also
filmed ``The Heist'' for HBO.
   And he was Kirstie Alley's boss and love interest for several
episodes of NBC's ``Cheers.''
   ``I did `Cheers' for the sheer pleasure of it,'' he said. ``I
had no intention of becoming a regular.''
   His only series was the short-lived ``Ryan's Four'' on ABC in
1983. He was a doctor in charge of four young interns.
   Skerritt grew up in Detroit, where he attended Wayne State
University before transferring to UCLA. While still a student he
was cast in the movie ``War Hunt,'' which also starred Robert
Redford, Sidney Pollock, Gavin McLeod and John Saxon.
   His film career went on to a small role as a comic motorcycle
officer in ``Harold and Maude,'' and since then he has starred in
``M-A-S-H,'' ``Turning Point,'' ``Alien,'' ``Ice Castles'' and
``Top Gun.'' He was the third lead in ``M-A-S-H'' as Duke. He was
asked to do the television series, but the character was dropped
when he turned it down.
   ``That was a lot of fun,'' he said. ``That was an extraordinary
experience. I'd worked with Robert Altman before when he directed
some `Combat' episodes I was in. I knew I could get silly. We did a
lot of improvisation. He hired improvisation people as extras and
put microphones and cameras everywhere to pick up what they were
doing.''
   He took a small role in ``Thieves Like Us''' so that he could
monitor Altman as director. He took the role in ``Harold and
Maude'' to monitor Hal Ashby's directing technique.
   He and his partner, Sue Aran, wrote a screenplay called ``The
Last of the Grape Jelly Glasses,'' which was optioned by
Guber-Peters prior to their new contract with Columbia Pictures.
   Skerritt describes it as a human comedy about an older man with
a heart condition who leaves a retirement home to take a last trip
on the Sacramento delta in his houseboat. He would direct and play
the old man's son-in-law.
   ``I'm trying to focus on directing now,'' Skerritt says.

<TEXT>
   For 20 million Japanese, Hiroshi Kume is an anchor
in the stormy seas of modern life.
   The 45-year-old, boyish-looking newscaster on TV Asahi's ``News
Station'' program anchors one of the nation's most popular news
show, drawing viewers with his pioneering, opinionated 80-minute
look at the day's events.
   In a culture that usually leans more to cooperation than
criticism, Kume has become a working man's hero for many. Admirers
claim he has the ``common man's touch,'' fearlessly criticizing the
powers that be in a Japan wracked by government scandals,
international criticism and new riches.
   With the irreverent style of a quiz show host _ his former
occupation _ he has revolutionized Japanese TV news and set off the
so-called ``News Wars'' in which competing networks imitated his
style.
   Critics and competitors claim he's biased, brash and _ perhaps
worst of all _ not a real journalist.
   Part Howard Cosell, part Willard Scott, and in no way a Peter
Jennings, a Tom Brokaw or a Dan Rather, Kume rebuffs both the pans
and the praise.
   He avoids including himself in the legions of middle-class,
loyal ``salary men'' who glue this country together. He points out
that anyone who earns a TV anchor's salary _ about $700,000
annually, TV insiders say _ can hardly be considered one of the
trampled masses.
   One television critic, Sadanobu Aoki, says Kume's support comes
from viewers who, desiring political reforms but not revolution,
applaud the unprecedented way he speaks out.
   ``He criticizes authority without hesitating, but he also
balances his criticism. People like to think they see a little of
themselves on the screen when they watch him,'' says Aoki.
   For some Japanese, Kume is an independent voice, the kind of
voice silenced in pre-war Japan by fealty to the emperor and muted
in postwar Japan by subservience to Japanese business.
   Kume delights in pointing to his ratings _ a 20 pecent share of
the viewing public _ when confronted with claims he doesn't measure
up to the staid, detached delivery of Japan's other talking heads.
   Four years ago, TV Asahi brought Kume on from competitor Tokyo
Broadcasting System, where he hosted quiz shows, cooking programs
and musicals. It then forged a format incorporating Kume's views of
the news.
   The move prompted loud criticism from media watchers about
Kume's lack of journalism experience. But his outspoken delivery
quickly attracted viewers. What followed was a cavalcade of
imitations in the same late evening time slot.
   Kume admits to being worried by the only copycat show that has
survived. The encroaching ratings of public broadcaster NHK's
``News Today'' makes him think he should run a tighter ship, and
``move from a news show to real news.''
   ``I think maybe I'll tell fewer jokes,'' says a smiling Kume,
who has remarked to Japanese interviewers that he learns more from
watching Beat Takeshi, a popular TV comedian, than from other
newscasters.
   On TV, Kume wears pullover sweaters, waves his hands, grimaces,
lurches forward into the camera, and delights in pointing to scale
models of volcanoes or train sets while reviewing the day's major
events.
   The commentary comes out after an event has been described, as
Kume talks over the issues with his co-anchors.
   Among other things, Kume's newscasts have highlighted the long
travails of the governing Liberal Democratic Party, which has been
embroiled in influence-peddling and sex scandals.
   ``I feel my mission is to check the activities of the government
and the Liberal Democratic Party, and I would even criticize the
Socialists if they gained power in the government,'' Kume said in
an interview.
   ``I'm criticized for this, but I believe this is my mission and
will continue doing it. It's part of what free speech is all
about.''
   Kume believes his move to news from cooking and quiz shows has
had an impact on the public. ``They think, `If this
light-hearted-type person can talk about politics, maybe I can
too,' '' he said.
   He does conform to some traditions, but adds his own bad-boy
twist. In Japan, newscasters end their shows by bowing respectfully
to the camera from their seats. Kume bows too.
   But as the screen cuts to black, viewers see his head fall
forward onto the desk, as if exhausted by the weight of his success.

<HEAD>First Orthodox Head Of Church Council Stresses Diversity</HEAD>
<HEAD>With Laserphoto</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID BRIGGS</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   In the 1950s, the National Council of Churches,
with mainline Protestantism enjoying an Indian summer of
prosperity, didn't seem to need any one else to set the
moral-religious agenda of the nation.
   Today, ``for the sake of a Christian role in a civil society,''
the council needs to embrace the diversity of American religious
life rather than stand above it, said the council's first Eastern
Orthodox president.
   ``Ironically, it's in being a catalyst for a more pluralistic
society'' that the council can play a more central role in public
policy debates, the Very Rev. Leonid Kishkovsky said in an
interview.
   ``It is not in re-establishing an establishment.''
   The council, the country's largest ecumenical organization,
includes most of the country's major Protestant and Eastern
Orthodox denominations.
   Kishkovsky, secretary for ecumenical and external affairs of the
Orthodox Church in America, was installed last week in Pittsburgh
to a two-year term as president of the council.
   He takes over as president in a time of transition for the
council, when officials are seeking to revitalize the nation's
largest ecumenical organization.
   The Rev. Arie R. Brouwer resigned as chief executive of the
council in June in a dispute over reorganization plans. In spite of
inflation, the contributions from member churches have remained
stagnant at around $12 million to $13 million for the last 15 years.
   While some evangelical churches have grown rapidly and the
percentage of Catholics in the United States has jumped 40 percent
in the last four decades, many of the largest churches within the
council have suffered significant membership losses. The council
today represents 32 church bodies with a membership of 42 million.
   Particularly as sectarian tensions divide other nations, U.S.
religious groups need to be a model of showing how people who
disagree on volatile issues can work toward a common ground,
Kishkovsky said.
   ``I think that in modest, but in real, helpful ways, (the
council) could help model out in our relations with Christians a
model of living together,'' Kishkovsky said. ``Americans have a
kind of key role in that kind of modeling around the world.''
   For example, Kishkovsky, who was born in Warsaw, said in Poland
there is a concern among the Protestant and Orthodox minorities
that the Catholic Church could be ``potentially oppressive'' as it
gains political influence with the democratic reforms going on
there.
   Kishkovsky said it would be ``foolhardy'' for the U.S. council
to set as its only goal bringing in the 53 million-member Catholic
Church as a member, but they can work toward a closer partnership.
   ``I really want to work on that,'' said Kishkovsky, part of a
12-member council delegation that met with Pope John Paul II in
April. ``I will help as much as I personally can.''
   The Kishkovsky, 46, who also is rector of an Orthodox church in
suburban New York, includes among his other goals emphasizing the
spiritual foundation of the council and persuading the ecumenical
agency to tackle tough issues such as abortion and homosexuality.
   ``Many of us have recognized the need to bring into the council
a spiritual, biblical dimension,'' said Kishkovshky, a member of
the council's governing board since 1979. ``It has been seen that
there is kind of an anemia of the spiritual.''
   But the tendency to focus on social policy issues with little
regard to personal spirituality is not limited to the council, he
said.
   ``I think there is a strain in American religion that is highly
pragmatic,'' according to Kishkovsky.
   Along with service, there needs to be emphasis on piety, prayer
and worship in council deliberations, he said.
   ``For me, the core of it is the spiritual,'' Kishkovsky said.
``You have to love God and love your neighbor.''
   But he said that does not mean the council should duck volatile
issues such as abortion and homosexuality as it has in the past for
the sake of unity.
   ``I believe that variety, pluralism, on pretty divisive issues
isn't something that needs to be feared,'' Kishkovsky said. ``It's
necessary for the civil society.''
   Within the council, Kishkovsky said ``that day maybe has
passed'' when the agency stayed away from discussing controversial
issues such as abortion for fear of offending groups holding
traditional views such as the Orthodox churches.
   ``It's in the air in American religious life,'' Kishkovsky said.
``Serious issues need to be explored among people of different
opinions.''

   A Lutheran church in San Francisco has called
a Minneapolis lesbian couple to become associate pastors in
defiance of a denominational ban on the ordination of practicing
homosexuals.
   The 120-member St. Francis Lutheran Church, which is adjacent to
San Francisco's heavily gay Castro neighborhood, has hired Ruth
Frost, 41, and her partner, Phyllis Zillhart, 32, to work part time
for the church and work with the Lutheran Lesbian and Gay Ministry
outreach program in the San Francisco Bay area.
   ``We believe that this is an issue of justice,'' said the Rev.
James DeLange, senior pastor of the church, which is part of the
Evangelical Lutheran Church in America.
   But Bishop Lyle Miller of the Sierra Pacific Synod said if
Zillhart and Frost accept their call, he will set in motion a
process that could lead to the expulsion of St. Francis from the
denomination.
   ``They know I care very much about the church's witness to gay
and lesbian people,'' Miller said. ``But we're not prepared or able
to participate in marriages or ordinations of gay and lesbian
people.''

   American Jews should not judge black
candidates solely by their association with Jesse Jackson, says an
official of Reform Judaism.
   Albert Vorspan, senior vice president of the Union of American
Hebrew Congregations, said it is ``unrealistic and wrong'' to
expect black candidates to publicly repudiate Jackson in return for
Jewish consideration.
   ``Jesse Jackson has become our Banquo's ghost, hovering
everywhere in the Jewish consciousness. We do not have to support
Jesse Jackson out of some misconceived Jewish guilt. I could not
vote for him. But it is sick to let him become the lens through
which Jews see and judge all blacks. There is a name for that _ it
is racism,'' Vorspan said.
   Jackson referred to New York as ``Hymietown'' in 1984, a remark
for which he later apologized.

   Bishops should be careful about criticizing
Catholic politicians, and Catholic public officials have a moral
responsibility to act to limit abortions, according to guidelines
on the abortion debate offered in a religious publication.
   In an article in a recent issue of America magazine, the Rev.
Robert J. McManus, vicar for education of the Diocese of
Providence, R.I., said Catholic bishops need to make clear they
defend the constituional principle of church-state separation and
should be prudent about criticizing the political stance of a
Catholic public official.
   Such criticism, McManus warned, could ``reawaken inadvertently a
latent yet historically evident prejudice that Catholics are not
politically independent enough of their bishops' political agenda
to govern in a pluralist society.''
   At the same time, McManus said, Catholic public officials are
not ``morally free to do nothing'' when capable of limiting the
legal availability of abortion.
   ``Political acquiescence in the face of immoral public policies
is morally unacceptable for a Catholic public official,'' McManus
said.

<HEAD>A Long-Lived Holiday Gift Idea</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CHET CURRIER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   As you shop for a niece, a grandson or some
other young person on your list this holiday season, the idea of
giving a financial gift may strike your fancy.
   Nobody can expect that the sight of a savings bond or
mutual-fund confirmation statement sticking out of a Christmas
stocking will light up an 8-year-old's eyes.
   But what an investment gift lacks in short-term gratification
can be more than offset by long-term appreciation, in both the
economic and emotional senses of the word.
   We're not talking just ``money'' here, but the start of some
savings and investment program that can be added to and grow over
time to help a young person start building for the future.
   A financial present can be ``more personal than cash and more
durable than this year's fashions,'' in the words of Standard &amp;
Poor's Corp.'s advisory publication The Outlook.
   Fine, you might say, but 500 shares of IBM costs a little more
than I planned to spend (it would run you a little more than
$50,000, counting commissions, and would saddle you with a
cumbersome gift-tax burden besides).
   Then what about one, five or 10 shares of some company you
believe provides a good product or valuable service that offers the
prospect of growth in the years ahead?
   A single share of stock doesn't come cheap through the usual
channels. You could be charged as much in commissions as the price
of the share itself.
   If you have a good working relationship with a bank or brokerage
firm, however, you might be able to persuade that worthy
intermediary to waive its usual fees as a courtesy.
   Alternatively, you might try phoning the investor relations
department of the company itself for suggestions about how best to
proceed. A well-run company should be eager to acquire young,
potentially long-term shareholders.
   While you are at it, check to see if the company has a dividend
reinvestment plan that allows for periodic additional purchases of
shares without brokerage commissions, or possibly even at a
discount. In a few cases, it may be possible even to buy the first
share through the reinvestment plan.
   Of course, the stock of an individual company is only one of
numerous choices open to financial gift shoppers.
   Some mutual funds offer to open accounts with initial
investments of $250 or $500. A few set no minimum at all.
   Among the simplest of all possibilities are bank investments,
such as certificates of deposit, and U.S. savings bonds, which can
be bought for as little as $25 at most financial institutions or
from your nearest Federal Reserve bank or branch.
   These options come with no commissions or other fees. Beware,
however, of bank accounts that reduce their interest rates and
impose maintenance charges for balances below specified levels.
   Or if you are of a mind to protect the youngster from all
eventualities, there is always gold, sold by many banks and brokers
in the form of bars, bullion coins or custodial receipts.
   Though the standard unit for most gold investments is a troy
ounce, recently base-priced at just above $400, several are
available in fractions of an ounce.
   ``Remember that you will pay more per ounce for gold if you buy
smaller sizes,'' Standard &amp; Poor's analysts caution.
   Whatever your preference, give some thought to discussing a
financial gift with a child's parents before it is bestowed, if
only to see that it fits in with whatever other planning and saving
measures are being taken.
   Most investment gifts to children are made under arrangements
such as state ``gift to minors'' statutes, which require the
designation of an adult as a custodian.
   There is also the matter to be decided beforehand of who will
take responsibility for any tax bills or other expenses that arise
from the investment while the child is still growing up.

<HEAD>Attacks on Church Workers a Common Case in History</HEAD>

   In the long view, it's not uncommon for
Christian workers to be arrested, imprisoned or killed for
upholding rights of the the poor and weak.
   ``It's not an aberration, but the regular lot of the church,''
an internationally recognized church researcher said about the
persecution of church workers in El Salvador.
   ``If seen in the historical context, this is something that has
gone on since the beginning of Christianity,'' said the Rev. David
B. Barrett, who has been compiling statistics on repression of
church workers. ``It's always been that way.
   ``Only the means and location are unpredictable. It's just like
lightning; you can't be sure where it's going to strike next. It's
like cancer; you can't stop it.
   ``The church can't minister without this risk. Whenever
Christians take seriously their commission to witness to the faith,
it's going to cost a lot.''
   Barrett, a British Anglican priest who edits the broadest
compilation of church statistics, the World Christian Encyclopedia,
now is doing missions research in Richmond, Va., for the Southern
Baptist Foreign Mission Board.
   Of the current surge of church persecutions in El Salvador,
including the killing of six Roman Catholic priests and arrests of
several Episcopal Church workers, he said:
   ``This just happens to be the latest case in a long-term pattern
in the world. Nearly every country has had its share of it over the
last 2,000 years. Now it's mainly in Third World countries in
conditions of instability.
   ``The main church pattern today is pursuing ministries to aid
the poor, the dispossessed and marginalized persons of society. In
many countries, if you do that, you are a marked man with
right-wing people.
   ``The moment you start taking the Christian commitment seriously
in those situations, you or your friends are likely to be picked up
or shot.''
   Church missions officials say about 50 religious professionals,
Protestant and Roman Catholic, have been killed in Central America
alone in the last decade, including 20 priests and nuns in El
Salvador and 15 in Guatamala.
   Many other clergy have been arrested or expelled and sometimes
whole dioceses and church institutions have been temporarily
evacuated because of military harassment.
   El Salvador's Archbishop Arturo Rivera y Damas, whose
predecessor, Oscar Romero, was assassinated in 1980, blames the
recent killings on the country's armed forces or its adjuncts. A
Salvadoran official has recommended that bishops quit the country.
   ``I hate to think it, but this type of thing is becoming more
and more common,'' said the Rev. Matthew Roche of the Jesuit
Missions Bureau.
   The Rev. Donald Doherty of the Maryknoll Fathers said: ``It's
actually nothing new, but a reversion back to the military's
collusion with death squads. There are a lot of threats and a lot
of actual murders.''
   In the world-at-large, Barrett's figures project an average of
1,000 church-employed workers killed annually in modern times for
their faith, including about 300 Protestant and Catholic clergy and
300 nuns.
   ``Only a fraction of them gets into media,'' he said. ``It's the
tip of the iceberg. Most cases are not uncovered until too late to
be a media story, and sometimes word of them doesn't get out for
three or five years.
   ``Scattered reports come from all around in letters and reports
of mission boards and from the Vatican.''
   The assaults on church personnel seems to come in waves, such as
those in the last decade that swept Ethiopia, Urganda, Cambodia,
Argentina and Chile and still beset some Latin American countries
and Africa's Sudan.
   Among the century's worst cases were the Nazi crushing of
opposing Christians as well as Jews, the Stalinist murders of
thousands of ministers, the slaughter of Armenian Christians and
the killings of Jesuit priests in the Spanish civil war.
   ``People knew what they stood for,'' Barrett said. ``They stood
for justice, freedom, rights of the underprivileged, things that
dictators can't understand. There's a long history of that.''
   He said the situation is parallel in El Salvador, and other
regions where people are oppressed and Christians ``stand up for
the faith.''
   ``Clearly the churches are commited to God's preferential option
for the poor,'' he said. ``It's a new insight that came about in
the Roman Catholic Church in Latin America in the '60s that the
poor were grievously sinned against, and something should be done
about it.''
   But it is the mandate of the church from its ``basic documents,
from the Bible and the call of Christ to witness to the nations.''
   A group of New York Jesuits, after learning of the killing of
their colleagues in El Salvador, at first were outraged, but
strangely, one relates, the mood later became a kind of ``sad
exuberance.''
   ``After all,'' said the Rev. Thomas H. Stahel, associate editor
of the national Jesuit weekly, America, ``these happy few had done
the ultimate Jesuit thing _ `Jesu-ite' (like Jesus) _ by laying
down their lives.''

   Roman Catholic bishops should be careful about
criticizing Catholic politicians, and Catholic public officials
have a moral responsibility to act to limit abortions, according to
guidelines on the abortion debate offered in a religious
publication.
   In an article in a recent issue of America magazine, the Rev.
Robert J. McManus, vicar for education of the Diocese of
Providence, R.I., said Catholic bishops need to make clear they
defend the constituional principle of church-state separation and
should be prudent about criticizing the political stance of a
Catholic public official.
   Such criticism, McManus warned, could ``reawaken inadvertently a
latent yet historically evident prejudice that Catholics are not
politically independent enough of their bishops' political agenda
to govern in a pluralist society.''
   At the same time, McManus said, Catholic public officials are
not ``morally free to do nothing'' when capable of limiting the
legal availability of abortion.
   ``Political acquiescence in the face of immoral public policies
is morally unacceptable for a Catholic public official,'' McManus
said.

   American Jews should not judge black
candidates solely by their association with Jesse Jackson, an
official of Reform Judaism says.
   Albert Vorspan, senior vice president of the Union of American
Hebrew Congregations, said it was unrealistic and wrong to expect
black candidates to publicly repudiate Jackson in return for Jewish
consideration.
   ``Jesse Jackson has become our Banquo's ghost, hovering
everywhere in the Jewish consciousness. We do not have to support
Jesse Jackson out of some misconceived Jewish guilt. I could not
vote for him. But it is sick to let him become the lens through
which Jews see and judge all blacks. There is a name for that _ it
is racism,'' Vorspan said.
   Jackson referred to New York as ``Hymietown'' in 1984, a remark
for which he later apologized.

   A Lutheran church in San Francisco has called
a Minneapolis lesbian couple to become associate pastors in
defiance of a denominational ban on the ordination of practicing
homosexuals.
   The 120-member St. Francis Lutheran Church, which is adjacent to
San Francisco's heavily gay Castro neighborhood, has hired Ruth
Frost, 41, and her partner, Phyllis Zillhart, 32, to work part time
for the church and work with the Lutheran Lesbian and Gay Ministry
outreach program in the San Francisco Bay area.
   ``We believe that this is an issue of justice,'' said the Rev.
James DeLange, senior pastor of the church, which is part of the
Evangelical Lutheran Church in America.
   But Bishop Lyle Miller of the Sierra Pacific Synod said if
Zillhart and Frost accept the jobs, he will set in motion a process
that could lead to the expulsion of St. Francis from the
denomination.
   ``They know I care very much about the church's witness to gay
and lesbian people, but we're not prepared or able to participate
in marriages or ordinations of gay and lesbian people,'' Miller
said.

<HEAD>Smashing Finish Expected for Record Movie Year</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BOB THOMAS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   As a smashing finish to what has been the
movie industry's biggest year, the major studios are bringing forth
brightly wrapped packages to make the holiday season equally
prosperous.
   Among the offerings: Meryl Streep and Roseanne Barr in a
devilish comedy; a remake of ``A Guy Named Joe'' from Steven
Spielberg; Denzel Washington in ``Glory,'' the story of the first
black regiment in U.S. history; Sylvester Stallone and Kurt Russell
in an action film; Tom Cruise as a disabled Vietnam veteran; Paul
Newman as a Louisiana governor entangled with a stripper; and Chevy
Chase on a Christmas vacation.
   Some may hit, some may miss. No matter what happens, the
business will be celebrating a record year on New Year's Eve.
   ``The box office will be $5 billion versus last year's record of
$4.46 billion,'' predicts Daily Variety's financial wizard A.D.
Murphy. ``Even more encouraging than ticket prices is the number of
admissions: 1.5 billion versus 1.08 billion last year. It's the
highest in five years.''
   While the number of tickets sold has held steady for 28 years at
around 1.1 billion, that is not a stagnant figure, Murphy said. Ten
years ago, theater rentals represented half of the studios'
receipts from feature films. This year, the income from theaters is
one-quarter of the lifetime receipts, the rest coming from such
markets as videocassettes, television network and syndication
sales, cable and pay TV.
   ``Much of the reason for the big box office this year comes from
the increase in screens,'' adds John Krier, president of Exhibitor
Relations, which monitors box-office figures. ``You can see the
difference in the number of new complexes that have opened in Los
Angeles and other cities. Many of them are large theaters.''
   As a sign of the times, Krier pointed out the record number of
films that have soared over the $100 million gross mark this year:
``Batman,'' ``Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade,'' ``Lethal Weapon
2,'' ``Honey, I Shrunk the Kids,'' and holdovers from late 1988 _
``Rain Man'' and ``Twins.''
   In addition, three films have sold more than $90 million worth
of tickets and may hit the magic mark: ``Dead Poets Society,''
``When Harry Met Sally ...'' and ``Parenthood.'' The October
release, ``Look Who's Talking,'' has made more than $85 million in
five weeks and seems certain to climb over $100 million.
   Despite negative reviews, Eddie Murphy's ``Harlem Nights'' has
the same potential.
   Here are some of the major enticements for the holiday moviegoer:
   _``Back to the Future Part II,'' more time travel with Michael
J. Fox and the mad professor Christopher Lloyd.
   _``The War of the Roses,'' a black comedy with Michael Douglas,
Kathleen Turner and Danny DeVito, directed by DeVito.
   _``Glory,'' Edward Zwick directs Denzel Washington, Matthew
Broderick and Morgan Freeman in story of a young, white Civil War
colonel and his all-black regiment.
   _``Always,'' Steven Spielberg's venture into sentimental
romance, a remake of ``A Guy Named Joe'' with Richard Dreyfuss and
Holly Hunter.
   _``Valmont,'' Milos Forman's version of ``Les Liaisons
Dangereuses,'' starring Colin Firth and Meg Tilly.
   _``We're No Angels,'' Robert DeNiro and Sean Penn in a remake of
the Humphrey Bogart-Aldo Ray comedy.
   _``Enemies, a Love Story,'' Paul Mazursky's look at a
relationship starring Anjelica Huston and Ron Silver.
   _``Handmaids Tale,'' the film version of Margaret Atwood's
celebrated novel, starring Faye Dunaway and Robert Duvall.
   _``She Devil,'' with Meryl Streep as a romance novelist who
steals the husband of Roseanne Barr, who exacts a fiendish revenge.
   _``Henry V,'' Kenneth Branagh stars and directs in Shakespeare's
play about the embattled British king.
   _``Born on the Fourth of July,'' Tom Cruise as the disabled
veteran in a contemporary drama directed by Oliver Stone
(``Platoon'').
   _``Blaze,'' Paul Newman as Gov. Earl Long in a passionate affair
with a strip teaser (Louise Davidovich).
   _``National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation,'' Chevy Chase and
Randy Quaid in another gag-filled romp.
   _``Tango and Cash,'' Sylvester Stallone and Kurt Russell in a
fast-paced buddy picture.
   _``Driving Miss Daisy,'' Jessica Tandy, Morgan Freeman and Dan
Aykroyd in a movie version of the hit play.
   _``Family Business,'' a generational saga with Sean Connery,
Dustin Hoffman and Matthew Broderick as bank robbers.
   Why do the studios send so many top attractions into the
marketplace at the end of the year? Partly it's in hopes that
Academy Award voters will be impressed.
   History _ especially last year's Oscars _ has proved that films
released late in the calendar year have a far greater chance of
Academy consideration.
   Murphy cites the commercial reason: ``Twelve percent of the
year's box office comes in the next six weeks. That's amazing
because it's really two hot periods, Thanksgiving and the Christmas
holidays, with a huge chasm in between. That's when people are
shopping and kids are still in school. Some pictures are unable to
bridge that chasm and they disappear.''
   The year-end results will be carefully watched by all the
studios as they calculate their share of the movie market. For the
year through Nov. 19, Murphy figures Warner Bros. ahead with 17.3
percent, thanks in large part to ``Batman'' and ``Lethal Weapon
2.'' Columbia-Tri-Star follows with 15.9 percent, then comes
Universal at 15, Paramount at 14.6 and Buena Vista (Disney) at
14.2. Orion, Fox and MGM-UA languish in single digits.
   Warner Bros. seems likely to maintain its lead, as long as the
Chevy Chase and Stallone-Russell vehicles perform well. But if
``Back to the Future Part II'' breaks as big as Universal hopes,
the company could take over the lead.
   Since most of the other films are being released in middle to
late December, they probably won't affect the final tally.

<HEAD>Thousands May Slip Into Poverty Because of Hugo</HEAD>

   Hurricane Hugo, the greatest natural
disaster to befall South Carolina in a century, swept thousands of
poor people and the near-poor into a maelstrom from which many will
take years to emerge.
   ``Disaster is the great equalizer,'' said Barbara Lohman, of the
American Red Cross. ``It reduces us all to the same level, but the
poor will take much longer to recover.''
   ``I'm here in the hands of the good man, the Lord,'' said
Rosalee Johnson, whose home in the rural Hamlin Beach section of
Mount Pleasant was destroyed by a wall of seawater that accompanied
the storm.
   ``You've got to do the best you can. It's hard until something
comes around,'' she said, as debris smoldered in a fire in front of
the shell of the building that was once her house.
   The devastation could push 184,000 South Carolinians into
poverty _ annual income below $12,100 for a family of four, said
Marvin Lare, executive director of the South Carolina Institute on
Poverty and Deprivation. That would raise the state's poverty rate
from 16.6 percent to over 19 percent.
   In 17 of 24 counties declared federal disaster areas, more than
20 percent of the population was living in poverty before Hugo, and
that will increase at least 10 percent, he said. ``Ten percent
would be a very conservative estimate considering the damage to
homes and jobs, especially in areas where you already have high
rates of poverty. The economic viability of those areas could not
readily snap up the difference.''
   Hugo killed 29 people, destroyed 5,000 homes and did at least $4
billion damage on Sept. 21. An estimated 247,000 jobs were lost, at
least temporarily, with the hardest-hit industries those that
employed large numbers of lower-income workers such as tourism,
forestry and agriculture.
   For many of the poor, recovery will come only through the good
will of volunteers, emergency aid and hard work.
   Mrs. Johnson, who lives in a trailer donated by a church group,
said the Federal Emergency Management Agency has been some help,
but ``they never give you back what you lost.'' FEMA says its goal
is to provide emergency aid, not replace what was lost or improve
on victims' pre-disaster standards of living.
   Nearby, Vanessa and Nathaniel Richardson and their four children
sought shelter in a donated trailer after Hugo washed their modest
white, frame house from its foundation. Insurance covered only
$25,000 owed the builder who held a lien on the home.
   Not only does Mrs. Richardson not have money with which to
rebuild, she was forced to take a leave from her job in a school
cafeteria because Hugo-related damage closed the day-care center
three of her children attended.
   Richardson was laid off as a boat builder and now works odd jobs.
   Mrs. Richardson has lived in the close-knit community all her
life, but she is beginning to think about moving, just as some
rural poor are expected to do _ migrate to urban areas seeking jobs
and housing.
   Jobs are available, many for hurricane-related cleanup and
construction, but with so many buildings damaged or destroyed,
housing is at a premium.
   ``You're between the devil and the deep blue sea,'' said Floy
Deaton, executive director of the Charleston Interfaith Crisis
Ministry. ``You can pay exorbitant rent or live in a shelter. Right
now people are desperate for places to live. It's a seller's
market.''
   Housing, out of reach for many now, may be more than a
short-term problem.
   As landlords get insurance checks, they may be more willing to
do more extensive renovations to lower-income apartments to attract
higher rents, Ms. Deaton said. The Interfaith Crisis Ministry
shelter, which usually houses about 100 men a night, now shelters
160 and there are plans to expand.
   Agencies serving the poor say the extent of the problems may
just be coming into focus.
   Last month, the state Department of Social Services issued $62
million in food stamps in addition to the $13 million usually
issued monthly. It will be months, though, before officials know
how many more people than before will now regularly need food
stamps, said Leon ove, administrator of the program.
   Immediat storm, critics complained that the rural poor eached in
the relief efforts. That's changed, bough, some say.
   ``The poor people are beingut they're being reached in the last
stages,'' ullard, director of the missions division of thptist
Convention. Southern Baptists comprise thination in the state, with
700,000 members. In ing the storm, the church provided hot meals
fople.
   The churches are working to reach poornot have received aid, but
many may be reticentdisaster centers to apply, Bullard said. ``Our
hunch is there are a lot of folks who are not able to read or write
and may be embarrassed to go and apply. In Clarendon and
Williamsburg counties, as many as 30 percent of the adults can't
read or write to fill out FEMA forms.''
   Iris Campbell, the wife of Gov. Carroll Campbell, had suggested
that churches adopt families disped by the storm, but some of the
offers of helpuffed. ``The whole idea of being adopted doesn't
appeal to them because it takes away some of their pride,'' Bsaid.
   Volunteers from Baptist churches will spread out across the
state during the coming months to lend a hand with rebuilding.
   While there are no firm figures, some officials believe more
dwellings occupied by the poor were destroyed because many weren't
very sturdy in the first place. But rebuilding too elaborately
could displace the very people the volunteers wantif property
values go up, Bullard said.
   ``y to build them back to about where they were be we don't hurt
the people by increasing the valu ability to insure and pay for
it,'' he said.

   In the poor, black enclave of Hamlin
Beach, the air is acrid with mud and decaying marsh grass two
months after Hurricane Hugo. Flies swarm over discarded furniture
and shacks still shorn of their tin roofs.
   Relief has been slow in coming to the rural hamlet nestled on a
marsh in Mount Pleasant, across the Intracoastal Waterway from the
posh Wild Duness.
   The 600 residents, many descendants of slaves, wonder what to do
about homes in ruins, acked along the road and appliances rendered
useless by a wall of seawater that accompanied thaking it real
hard. They're depressed,'' said Isaac Manigault, surveying the
remains of his home that was ripped from the foun. ``I've never
seen anything like this,'' added Manigault, who rode out the last
great hurricanes to hit the area _ Gracie and Hazel in the 1950s _
in that house.
   Flies circle waterlogged mattresses, asketball trophies are
scattered in the yard. A neighbor's home lies in splinters and
marsh grase of pickups destroyed in the storm.
   Manigault's 76-year-old mother, Mary Jane, braved 135-deep
waters during the height of Hugo to walk more than a mileto an
evacuation shelter. Her hointends to rebuild.
   ``I don't know how, but I hope I can,'' said Mrs. Manigault, who
is lia mobile home. ``I know the good Lord will take care of me.''
   Many in the enclave of poor aith to see them through the job of
rebuilding. But faith will e to be augmented by temporal help.
   ``We suilding supplies, plywood, lumber and the like,'' said the
Rev. A.J. Blake, pastor of the Goodwill A.M.E. Churing to get
mobile homes for residents whose houses were destroyed or badly
damaged.
   Most dover their losses. Of those who did, few had flood
insurance to cover damage from the storm surt in some places along
the coast.
   Assistance has reached tholated community, but the response ``is
not as ought to be,'' Blake said, adding that many residents have
not heard from the Federal Emergency Management Agcy.
   Compounding that problem is a reluctance by many to ask for help.
   ``You have a lot of pride among these people,'' he said. ``We've
had reporters come in from out of state and folks say: `I don't
want to be on TV. I don't want my picture in the newspaper.'''
   For some, there is bitterness that relief shipments, slow coming
at first, have tapered off even more since attention was diverted
to the Northern California earthquakehat struck Oct. 17.
   ``There are a lot more poor people in this area than in
California, and we need the help bad,'' said Manigault, a plumber
who lost most of his tools.
   FEMA gave him some money for living expenses and clothing and he
has picked up some additional money doing odd jobs. He will
rebuild, but not in the same spot.
   ``I'm too scared to come back. You never know what will happen
in the future,'' he said. His son, however, hopes to rebuild on the
family homestead.
   A short distance away, Elizabeth Edwards' house is little more
than a shattered framework of lumber. A ceiling fan and chandelier
hang precariously from the rafters. Ms. Edwards has moved into a
mobile home donated by a Boone, N.C., Christian aid group,
Samaritan's Purse, until her home can be rebuilt.
   ``There's nothing we can do but trust in the Lord. It could have
been worse,'' she said. ``We just take it as it comes.''

<HEAD>Redistricting: GOP To Try Lawsuits To Counter Legislative Weakness</HEAD>

   The Republicans have a game plan for the
battle over congressional redistricting in 1991: wherever you can't
beat them, sue them.
   ``We're going to litigate like crazy in the 1990s,'' a party
lawyer told aides and political advisers to Republican governors.
   Their first objective, obviously, will be to win at the polls
the power to shape redistricting plans themselves, and to block any
the GOP deems unfairly tilted against them.
   Court action will come next, and it is certain to be widespread,
by both political parties and by other interest groups. No matter
how the lines are drawn in any state, somebody will be dissatisfied.
   Ben Ginsberg, the Republican National Committee counsel, said
the party will raise a variety of redistricting issues, seeking
cases that may lead eventually to a definitive Supreme Court ruling
on gerrymandering _ the practice of shaping congressional districts
for political advantage.
   Each party has done it when it could, and the other party has
protested. Democrats had the upper hand in the last redistricting
because of their state House legislative strength, and they are
likely to hold the advantage again this time.
   In addition, the Democrats got a head start in using the
techniques of national politics in the state legislative contests
that are crucial to control of redistricting. They set about it 20
years ago, picking the spots most likely to strengthen their hand.
   The objective, for either party, is to control at least one of
the three points of state decisionmaking on congressional
districts: governor, state House or state Senate.
   It takes all three to write a redistricting plan, but any one of
them can block it. So by winning control in at least one branch of
the state legislature, the party out of power can force the
governor to bargain and compromise on congressional district lines.
   ``Being at the table, having a hand on the pencil when it comes
time to draw the lines, is what keeps you in the ball game on
redistricting,'' said Norman mmings, political director at the
Republican National Committee.
   That pushes up the stakes for both partiein the state elections
of 1990, with state legislatures and 36 governors to be chosen for
terms that will put em in charge of the redistricting based on the
1990 census.
   Republican National Chairman Lee Atwater told GOP governors
meeting in Hilton Head, S.C., earlier this month that redistricting
is the key to Democratic control of the House.
   He claimed that ``the sword of the gerrymander and the shield of
incumby'' keep them in control, a catchy line even though it is a
thin comeback to 35 years of Democratic majorities.
   Both national parties have field staffs assigned to help their
candidates for the state legislatures.
   he Republicans tested theirs in Virginia and New Jersey this
fall. They gained four seats in the Virginia House but remain a
minority. They lost control of the New Jersey Assembly. So the
Democrats will coedistricting in 1991 in both those states.
   Going into the 1990 elections, the Democrats control both
branches of the legislatures in 29 states, the Republ only 8, with
split control in a dozen. There are 29 Democratic governors, 21
Republicans.
   Those are the numbers that have the Republicans looking to
theourts as a last line of defense. Not that court challenges to
redistricting plans are new business; 47 of the 50 state blueprints
wound up in court last time.
   Contentious from the beginning, redistricting got really tough
60 years ago, when Congress set the limit on House seats at 435.
That meant that the only way a growing state could gain eat was for
another state to lose one.
   Reapportionment based on the 1990 census is expected to mean at
let six more seats in the House for California, probably four for
Florida and three for Texas, and one apiece for Arizona, Georgia,
North Carolina and Virginia.
   The likely losers are New York, 3 seats; Pennsylvania, Michigan,
Ohio and Illinois, 2 apiece; and one each from Iowa, Kansas,
Kentucky, Massachusetts, West Virginia and Wisconsin.
   Gearing up for the competition, both parties are pumping their
computers full of voting records that will enable them to predict
the party leanings of voters not just by districts but by
neighborhoods, block by block.
   Ginsberg said that means the gerrymanders of thwill be more
sophisticated, and sometimes more difficult to challenge in court.
In addition, he said, interest groups and would-be watchdog
organizations will be able to get into the game for the price of a
small computer.

   With cities large and small on the front lines
in the war on drugs, the League of Cities wants Dec. 3-9 declared
as national ``Fight Back Against Drugs Week.'' Local officials are
trying innovative tactics in the struggle, but some ``soldiers''
question whether the nation has the resources and the resolve to
win it.

   In Yakima, Wash., klieg lights aimed at crack houses discourage
nighttime drug deals. Havens for drugs are torched in El Dorado,
Ark. Helmeted Philadelphians sabotage pushers with dusk-to-dawn
street vigils.
   America's cities are battlefields in a way far different than
Bunker Hill or Bull Run. This enemy is drugs, and the weapons
include community hotlines in Columbus, Ohio, newspaper coupons in
Clinton, Iowa, and 1960s-style activism in Shreveport, La.
   ``It's a grassroots war,'' said Randy Arndt, spokesman for the
national League of Cities. ``Drugs is far and away the No. 1 issue
for our cities, ahead of poverty, homelessness, affordable housing
and trash disposal.''
   Images of war are beamed nightly by television into the nation's
living rooms. Police commandos wear flak jackets to shield them
from assault guns. The number of body bags rivals Beirut casualty
lists. Killings erupt from gang wars in Los Angeles to the murder
capital of Washington, D.C.
   President Bush, the commander-in-chief, formally declared war in
September, saying drugs would be fought ``block by block, child by
child.''
   Soldiers in the fight applauded Bush's rallying cry but
criticized the limit of federal dollars, which puts the burden on
cities to pay for the combat.
   ``You can declare war all you want. We ain't got the
ammunition,'' said Sheriff Doug Bair of Yakima County, Wash.
   ``The front line is asked to supply the rear. It's like the
Normandy invasion financing itself by holding a rummage sale,''
said Phoenix Mayor Terry Goddard, president of the League of
Cities. ``Is that any way to win a war?''
   The League of Cities is pushing Dec. 3-9 as national ``Fight
Back Against Drugs Week'' to give the war on drugs some momentum.
   An underground army has formed of citizens who have had enough.
But criminologist Lawrence Sherman of the University of Maryland
cautions that fighting should be left to professionals.
   ``Rather than encouraging open combat, officials could ask
citizens to keep their heads down. Not even Smokey the Bear wants
us to rush into forest fires with a garden hose,'' Sherman said.
   The number of bystanders shot and murdered in drug-related
shootings has tripled in the last three years in New York, Los
Angeles, Washington and Boston, Sherman said. From 1986 to '88, New
York City had 128 bystander deaths, Los Angeles 105.
   Police would like to see better national strategies, such as a
national tipline to snitch on drug dealers and stiff fines to make
the drug trade less profitable.
   ``What we are doing is fighting a war. We have not gotten into a
mindset of winning the war,'' said Sevrin Sorensen of the National
Association of Chiefs of Police.
   In the meantime, the combat goes on.
   Yakima, a city of 50,000 in Washington's apple country, has
become a cocaine distribution point for the Northwest, police say.
Drugs are smuggled in from Mexico by agents who blend in with
migrant farm workers.
   To make the drug trade conspicuous, police train four 500-watt
lights on suspected drug dens. Their purpose is similar to air raid
lights discouraging attacking warplanes, and police said they have
reduced traffic 95 percent to the buildings since September.
   ``We want to create a strong sense of paranoia among dealers and
users,'' said Police Chief Pleas Green said. ``We're forcing people
out of their comfort zone.''
   But an American Civil Liberties Union official in Seattle is
unimpressed. ``It sounds like a Hollywood approach to the war on
drugs,'' Jerry Sheehan said.
   The southern Arkansas city of El Dorado, population 26,000,
condemned three suspected crack houses and set them on fire this
spring.
   ``It was really interesting to see people in the neighborhood
standing on the porches, cheering and applauding when the houses
were burning,'' said Mayor Larry Combs.
   In Inglewood, Calif., police have infiltrated suspected crack
houses to run sting operations. When users come to buy drugs,
they're busted.
   In the past 15 months, Philadelphia has sealed 600 abandoned
houses with cinder blocks and stucco to keep out dealers and their
trade.
   A network of community anti-drug groups has spread across
Philadelphia in the past two years. Wearing white plastic helmets,
residents hold all-night vigils to push dealers off street corners.
   ``We all have to get out there and roll our sleeves up. It's the
worst crisis to hit America since Pearl Harbor,'' said Herman
Wrice, a Drexel University professor and community leader.
   The country's heartland, too, has mobilized.
   In Columbus, Ohio, police opened a hotline for residents to
report crack activity in their neighborhoods. It averages about 65
calls a week from private citizens.
   ``Nothing will frighten the pushers so much as to know that
apathy is officially dead in central Ohio, and we're on the
march,'' Mayor Dana Rinehart said.
   Community activists also joined the battle with a block watch
program.
   ``The only way we're going to eliminate the drug problem is to
pitch in and do some of the dirty work. The police can't be
everywhere all the time,'' said Mark Goodman, a member of the Olde
Towne East Neighborhood Association.
   Baseball is an ally in Kansas City, Mo. Ewing Kaufman, the
billionaire owner of the Kansas City Royals, pledged free college
tuition to 500 students at one of the city's most neglected high
schools if they stay off drugs.
   Under the $10 million experiment, the entire 9th and 10th grades
at Westport High School will go to college if they pass random drug
tests.
   ``You give them hope, you give them opportunity, you show them
that somebody cares about them, and they'll stand up to other
people. They'll turn out good,'' Kaufman said.
   The passions of war can even overwhelm anti-tax sentiments. This
month, voters in the Kansas City area approved a quarter-cent
increase in the sales tax to raise $98 million over the next seven
years to fight the war.
   ``The people are fighting back,'' said Joe Serviss, treasurer of
Citizens Against Drugs. ``They are sick and tired of being locked
in their homes and intimidated by drug dealers.''

   The black community of Cedar Grove in Shreveport, La., which was
terrified by an all-night riot 14 months ago, has become the
personal battleground of activist and former comedian Dick Gregory.
   Gregory arrived in June in the northwestern Louisiana city of
200,000. He converted A.B. Palmer Park, once overrun by dope
dealers, into a joyful, child-filled bunker. And he has recruited
Coretta Scott King, her son, Martin Luther King III, and dancer Ben
Vereen for his fight.
   ``I'm here to protect my America and my children. I'm here for
the same reason people go to war,'' Gregory said. ``We want our
neighborhoods back. We want people who'd be willing to die, but not
willing to kill.''
   In the Iowa community of Clinton, police worked with the Clinton
Herald to come up with a newspaper coupon so readers could
anonymously list the names of anyone they suspect of using or
selling drugs.
   ``I'm quite sure we're going to be able to achieve some arrests
through this,'' said Police Chief Gene Bienke.
   But Councilman John Rowland criticized the campaign as ``a Big
Brother syndrome.'' Said Rowland: ``Apparently, it's drugs today.
What is it next week, political subversives?''
   Battlelines stretch from Phoenix, Ariz., to Phoenixville, Pa.
   Authorities in Phoenix target casual users. Those busted can
avoid jail by seeking treatment in rehabilitation centers at their
own expense, which saves on prosecution costs.
   Phoenixville, a Philadelphia suburb of 17,000 residents, hired
its first undercover cop this year. Vince Pacifico, a 25-year-old
former prison guard, helped arrest 31 suspects.
   New York City set up Tactical Narcotics Teams last year after a
rookie police officer was killed guarding a witness in a drug case.
TNT saturates a drug-plagued area for 30 to 90 days, arresting
buyers and sellers to disrupt the drug trade.
   In its first year, TNT made 7,000 arrests. But critics of the
$116 million, two-year program say dealers return when TNT moves
on, not unlike search and destroy missions in Vietnam when
territory was taken but the enemy crept back in.
   Police are encouraged by their successes, but they concede the
enemy is entrenched.
   ``This must be the longest war in history. It's going to be like
the Thousand Year War,'' said Francis Hall, retired head of New
York City's narcotics division.

   Ron Webeck could barely walk,
couldn't talk and was nearly blind when he was flown to his
family's home to die of a devastating AIDS-related brain disease.
That was more than four years ago.
   Today, Webeck, 42, is thriving and researchers are trying to
find out why.
   ``I realize that I'm probably not supposed to be here,'' he
said. ``I've been given an incredible gift _ I'm cured.''
   Tests have failed to turn up the AIDS virus in Webeck's blood.
Even rarer is that scientists can no longer find a trace of the
virus that caused his brain infection _ progressive multifocal
leukoencephalopathy, or PML _ a disease that preys on AIDS victims
and usually kills within six months.
   ``Sure he's healthy _ he looks good, he feels good and he can do
anything he wants to do,'' said Dr. Joseph Berger, a University of
Miami neurologist and AIDS researcher who wrote about the case in
the medical journal Neurology.
   ``But I'd have to say with 99 percent certainty that he's
sitting on a time bomb,'' Berger said, ``That what caused his
illness in the first place is somehow being suppressed and will
come back.''
   AIDS researcher Sidney Houff, who examined Webeck at the
National Institutes of Health in Bethesda, Md., calls his recovery
``remarkable,'' but he's not ready to call it permanent. ``What
exactly caused him to survive and recover is a mystery. We had
never seen anyone survive from it before. Up until that point,
everyone with PML had died a miserable death.
   ``There's no telling what may happen in the future. I'm hopeful
for him, but if his immune system is sufficiently challenged,
there's always the chance the virus that causes PML will reappear.''
   Webeck thinks doctors are being overly cautious.
   ``I'm going on five years now. How long do I have to be healthy
before they finally give up and agree I'm well?''
   For Webeck, who says he lived in the fast lane of San
Francisco's gay community in his 20s, the first signs something was
wrong came in the spring of 1985. While working as a waiter in
Provincetown, Mass., he felt an aggravating twinge in his neck. He
soon began falling down and had to quit because he could no longer
add customers' bills.
   A culture of spinal fluid taken at Massachusetts General
Hospital eight weeks later showed the presence of the human
immunodeficiency virus (HIV), the virus that causes AIDS. A scan
revealed lesions on his brain and a biopsy showed that PML had
infected his brain tissue.
   After weeks of violent illness and with his weight at just above
120, doctors suggested Webeck make plans to be with his family.
They thought he only had days to live. ``They didn't have to say
the word _ it was written all over their faces. They rushed me home
with no medicine, nothing.
   ``They figured, `What's the use?'''
   Dr. Leonard Mueke, who treated Webeck at Massachusetts General,
said he had to tell the patient and his family the dismal prognosis.
   ``Based on what we knew about other patients similarly
diagnosed, I don't think we had any option but to conclude that he
didn't have a very good outlook,'' said Mueke, now at the Scripps
Clinic in La Jolla, Calif.
   ``He was sent home with two medications to treat certain
symptoms of his illness that he opted not to take, but it's true we
had nothing to give him for his primary diagnosis of AIDS and PML.''
   Under his parents' care in St. Petersburg, Webeck suffered
through seizures and a bout with depression that ended in his
attempt to take an overdose of sedatives. After 10 days in the
hospital, he survived.
   ``That was a big turning point for me. I met death and was
spared. I started to realize I got some work to do before I go.''
   That's when, amazingly, Webeck started getting better.
   Without medical treatment, only an attitude shaped by books on
positive thinking and an insatiable will to live, Webeck began
forcing himself to eat and teaching himself to walk again. By July
1986, he set out to find a cause for his return to health. He wrote
to every major medical center and AIDS researcher in the country.
   After scores of encouraging but noncommittal responses, Berger
at Miami and then Houff at NIH agreed to make extensive
examinations. Some procedures were painful, such as tapping bone
marrow and spinal fluid, but Webeck hoped for clues that could help
others.
   Huff, who completed more than three weeks of examinations of
Webeck in June, found that all components of his immune system were
basically normal. One odd thing was that Webeck had the usual
number of B lymphocytes, white blood cells that produce antibodies
against disease. All other PML patients Houff had seen had produced
vast numbers of tainted blood cells that made their way into the
brain tissue and caused the infection.
   ``His immune system was able to shut down the production of B
lymphocytes and slow the progress of the disease,'' Houff said.
``Now, how he was able to do that is something we don't know.''
   Houff, who has moved to the Veteran's Administration Hospital in
Washington, D.C., and the faculty of Georgetown University,
currently has five other patients involved in his study. Four have
lived after bouts with PML, but for much shorter periods than
Webeck, and all but one are suffering other AIDS-related infections.
   Meantime, the tanned, mustachioed Webeck is stronger than ever,
recently put in the peculiar circumstance of being a one-time AIDS
patient forced to go on a diet when his weight topped 180 pounds.
   Webeck receives a disability check from Social Security, so he
has time to speak to churches and civic groups, and to care for a
friend with AIDS. He hopes to travel full-time to promote AIDS
research and to show that the virus does not always mean a death
sentence.
   ``I can't even count the number of people I've seen die from
AIDS,'' he said. ``Many of them were so devastated when they heard
they had it they sort of gave up. If people see me, maybe they will
think twice that miracles do happen.''

<HEAD>Burning Out On Taking Care Of The Needy</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ALLISON J. PUGH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Doctors, social workers and therapists are giving
a new name to a syndrome they say is draining their ranks:
``compassion fatigue.''
   It strikes people who take on too heavy a load of other people's
burdens, leaving little time or energy for themselves. Victims
become disillusioned and depressed, and often start to show cracks
in their professional veneer.
   ``Everyone that I work with is affected by it. I've felt it in
myself,'' said social worker Lydia Parsons of the Mid-Maine Medical
Center in Waterville. ``I've had other people tell me about it,
about me, before I was aware of it.''
   Compassion fatigue is gaining recognition. A half-dozen
presentations were devoted to it at a recent National Associations
of Social Workers conference. Dr. Edward Poliandro, of Mount Sinai
Medical School in New York, said people ``were hanging from the
rafters'' to hear his workshop on stress management.
   Some hospitals are offering support programs that feature stress
management classes, longer staff meetings, and even daily walks
through the park.
   As many as 20 percent of caregiving professionals suffer such
burnout, said Dr. Lyle H. Miller, head of the Biobehavioral
Institute in Boston.
   Typical victims sound almost like TV stereotypes of social
workers or doctors, working too much, sleeping too little,
sacrificing their own lives and families for case after case.
``It's the best and the brightest and the most committed and the
most energetic that burn out,'' Miller said.
   Parsons is a classic example. As director of the social work
department at the Redington-Fairview Hospital in Skowhegan, Maine,
she was running on empty so often she couldn't do anything very
well. ``I always felt guilty even going for lunch, because there
was always someone waiting for me.''
   Parsons quit that job and, after a break in which she worked
part-time, joined Mid-Maine, where there are frequent staff
meetings and peer support.
   Thomas A. Welch, a former Catholic priest who left a Boston-area
hospice program after a decade of helping the terminally ill deal
with the prospect of death, said he had been happy with his work
but that it was too consuming to stay good at it for long.
   ``It's very heavy emotional material. It's not something that
anyone should do for a very long time,'' said Welch, who left both
the church and the hospice in 1985 and now owns an Italian
restaurant. ``You get a sense that the whole world is dying after a
while. I heard a friend say I was a downer, I should find a way to
lighten up.''
   Compassion fatigue went recognized for a long time because of
the stigma attached to it, experts say.
   ``Very often people in any line of field would be looked down
upon if they were to acknowledge they were really stressed out,''
said Poliandro, who teaches stress management at the Mount Sinai
Medical School.
   ``There's a double standard of being in the helping profession
that we should be able to see it in ourselves'' before anxiety
becomes a crisis, said Parsons.
   When perfect employees ignore their stress they can become an
administrator's nightmare, Miller said. They can develop headaches,
backaches, fatigue, depression, and irritability. They might start
to abuse drugs and alcohol, or begin not showing up for work,
Poliandro said.
   The best way to fight compassion fatigue?
   Take a vacation, Poliandro and Miller agreed.
   Administrators can help, however. The boss can force workers to
take lunches away from their desk, outlaw working past 9 p.m., or
forbid employees to work weekends, Poliandro said.
   At Mount Sinai, personnel can enlist in the ``wellness''
program, which offers, among other activities, daily walks through
nearby Central Park. ``It's a rapid walk, to build up their health,
but also they do it just to enjoy being outside and away from the
pressures of the office,'' Poliandro said.
   Ultimately, professionals who help people have to teach
themselves how to stave off the needs of their own patients, said
Miller and Poliandro.
   ``Humans have a tremendous capacity to be resilient,'' said
Poliandro. ``They just have to be able replenish their energy.''

<HEAD>Patients with Burning Skin Pain Find Comfort in Hot Pepper Extract</HEAD>
<HEAD>With LaserPhoto</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KELLEY SHANNON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SAN ANTONIO, Texas (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The burning was so painful that Reyes
Martinez sometimes couldn't touch the soles of her feet. Skin pain
from diabetes was so great that ``about the only place I went was
to the doctor and to church.''
   She found cool relief from an unlikely source. Capsaicin, the
stuff that makes a pepper sting, can help ease skin pain.
   ``I said, `Well, I eat a lot of the chili peppers. I don't care
how it's made _ I'm just glad it helps,'' said Ms. Martinez, who
with other patients at the University of Texas Health Science
Center is using the purified extract of hot pepper resin to soothe
skin irritations caused by diabetes and shingles.
   Capsaicin is the active ingredient in a medicated cream called
Axsain, being tested at the center's pain clinic and 19 other
medical centers in the United States and Canada. Axsain isn't the
first medication to use capsaicin, but it contains the most
concentrated dose, said Joan Hoffman, a nurse and pain clinic
investigator who coordinated the studies at the San Antonio center.
   ``I think patients come to studies like this because they're
hopeful that it's going to work. It's interesting to them because
it's peppers.''
   Lots of peppers _ it takes more than 1,000 pounds of peppers to
produce one ounce of powdered capsaicin.
   The pain clinic is conducting studies using the hot pepper cream.
   One involves 20 patients suffering from post-herpetic neuralgia,
or pain caused by shingles. A medical center in Canada also is
testing 20 patients with that affliction. The other San Antonio
study involves 40 diabetics.
   Though final results are not in, preliminary indications are
that the cream helps, Ms. Hoffman said. Sixty-nine percent of
patients with pain from shingles showed improvement after
treatment. No results are yet in on the diabetics.
   Dr. Michael Pfeifer, of the Diabetes Research and Analysis
Association and Humana Hospital in Lexington, Ky., cited ``very
positive'' experience with it.
   Capsaicin helps ease burning by blocking pain messages carried
to the brain by C-fiber nerves, associated with hot and cold
sensations, researchers say. Though the applications relieve pain
eventually, the cream causes a burning sensation at first, ``like
when you touch jalapenos with your hands,'' said Ms. Hoffman.
``Well, you touch this, and then if you touch your eye with that
cream on your hand it burns. It won't damage your eyes. But it is
hot.''
   The side effect prompted some people to quit the study. But
researchers say the burning subsides with the frequency of
application.
   ``It's kind of like you're desensitized to it. Just like, I
guess, eating jalapenos,'' Ms. Hoffman said.
   Diabetics usually don't have as much problem as shingles
patients because the pain they sometimes experience often is
accompanied by slight numbness.
   Study participant Stella Murphy, 59, said the burning was
bothersome, but she stuck with the study in an effort to soothe her
shingles pain. ``It really saved me. It was a little bit of a
hassle ...
   ``It does burn pretty much, just like hot peppers would.''
   Participants applied cream several times a day for eight weeks;
sometimes they were given the real cream and sometimes a placebo.
After that they enter a one-year test during which they are given
the real cream and monitored.
   Axsain is available at about 90 percent of the nation's drug
wholesalers, said Bryan Ackerman, a marketing vice president for
Ilinois-based GalenPharma, which was formed last year to produce
the cream. GalenPharma is treating Axsain as a specialty item that,
like medications such as insulin, does not require a prescription
but must be obtained by asking a pharmacist for it.
   The company suggests Axsain be used under a doctor's
supervision, and Ackerman said it also has been used effectively in
patients with post-surgery neuralgia _ severe pain after an
operation.
   One possible drawback is Axsain's cost _ about $50 for a 2-ounce
tube _ and some insurance companies won't pay because it's sold
over-the-counter.
   But Ms. Hoffman says the response at her clinic demonstrates how
patients are hunting for relief. ``We got just a heap of responses,
hundreds of calls. It's kind of sad because they're very
desperate.''

<HEAD>Zebra Mussel Infestation of Great Lakes Could Be Costly</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ANN ARBOR, Mich. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Zebra mussels accidentally imported to
the Great Lakes in the last four years are threatening commercial
and sport fishing and forcing cities and industries into costly
measures to protect water supplies.
   The 2-inch-long mollusk, first dropped off an ocean-going
freighter in Lake St. Clair outside Detroit, has spread through
Lake Erie and a colony was found in Lake Michigan near Green Bay,
Wis., said Michael Donahue, executive director of the Great Lakes
Commission, headquartered in Ann Arbor, Mich.
   Intake pipes for industrial plants and municipal water systems
are among favorite breeding grounds for the greenish-striped
mussel. Monroe, Mich., just south of Detroit, is designing a system
to bathe the mouth of its intake system with ozone-infused water in
hopes of killing the mussels' larvae, but there is very little that
apparently can be done to stem the surge of the mussels.
   Cleveland is also facing heavy bills to rid itself of an
infestation, and Detroit has been forced to partially close its
water plant.
   ``I will guarantee you that it may be Detroit and Cleveland's
problem today, but it is going to be Gary's and Michigan City's
problem in the near future,'' Donahue said. ``There's just no way
to stop it.''
   In addition, the mussels feed voraciously on algae that other
fish and mollusks need, and could devastate Lake Erie's walleye
pike _ one of the lake's most important commercial fish, by
covering spawning grounds, said Jon Stanley, of the U.S. Fish and
Wildlife Service in Ann Arbor.
   ``Those actions in Lake Erie, we expect, will reduce the walleye
population by about half,'' Stanley said. A ``good portion'' of the
estimated $600 million a year in Lake Erie fisheries comes from
walleye.
   Beaches also could become fouled by the sharp-edged mussel
shells, Stanley said. ``You can notice the difference on some
beaches already. They used to be nice soft sand, but now they
crunch underfoot as you walk.''

<HEAD>Researchers Use Dogs to Test Radon Exposure</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Thirty dogs will have radon
detectors attached to their collars as part of a study into the
effects of the odorless gas.
   ``We hope to find an association between radon exposure and lung
cancer in dogs and, therefore, in humans,'' said Purdue University
veterinarian Robert Teclaw. ``The long-term goal is to find out if
dogs can serve as warning signals on environmental hazards to
humans.''
   Dogs were chosen because they are in the house as much or more
than people, who work outside the home, and because they have a
shorter lifespan. Any health hazards from radon will show up
earlier in the animals than in humans.
   Dog owners in Tippecanoe County, where Purdue is located, this
month began fitting their pets with the collars, which will be worn
for three months. The detectors weigh less than an ounce and are
the size of a silver dollar. Film inside the detector is sensitive
to ions emitted by radon. Radon coming in contact with the film
will leave tell-tale tracks.
   Radon is a colorless, odorless, radioactive gas that comes
predominantly from the decay of radium, which occurs naturally in
the soil and can accumulate in a house. Exposure over a long period

   Crisp, red apples and test tubes of tiny
trees in a lab cooler represent hope for the future of
chemical-free fruit production.
   Already, researchers have developed new varieties with natural
resistance to major diseases, reducing the need for fungicides,
said Schuyler Safi Korban, head of the University of Illinois
breeding program, who hopes genetic engineering can improve the
process even further.
   ``Now, with all the concern over the use of chemicals these
varieties will become more important. Growers are coming to us
asking where they can get these varieties,'' said Korban. Illinois'
program has produced nine varieties since the Prima was introduced
two decades ago to resist apple scab disease.
   Growers might have sprayed fungicide 12 times a season to
prevent scab disease, but resistant varieties have cut Illinois' $1
million-a-year chemical bill for apples by 60 percent, he said.
   Newer varieties include Jonafree, Redfree, Williams' Pride and
Dayton. The apples are resistant to scab and, in varying degrees,
fire blight, apple cedar rust and powdery mildew _ among the most
prevalent diseases in the industry, and some are even resistant to
bugs.
   Consumers were slow to switch from their favorite Red Delicious
and Jonathan apples, Korban said, but recent controversy
surrounding the chemical Alar and its link with cancer changed
that. Alar was used by some growers to keep apples colorful and
fresh on trees longer, extending the harvest.
   ``We're making progress in reducing chemical use, though it may
not be as fast as some would like,'' said Paul Curtis, who operates
a 5,000-tree orchard and grows varieties developed at the Illinois,
including Jonafree.
   Conventional breeding has led to the new varieties of apples
with disease and insect resistance. Korban hopes genetic
engineering will speed and improve the process and give
already-popular varieties resistance.
   ``It is a great idea but these things take years to develop and
test,'' said Ron Meyer of the Illinois Apple and Peach Marketing
Board. ``It took 25 years to develop good varieties that were
resistant to scab.''

<HEAD>Atari Aims to Zap Nintendo; Rolls Out Competitor for `Game Boy'</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Atari Corp., once a major player in the home
computer game business,has rolled out a new handheld machine that
the company hopes will help it compete with industry powerhouse
Nintendo.
   The machine, called Lynx, is a one-pound, portable video game
system featuring detailed graphics, sharp color and sound effects.
   Toy analysts say the clarity of its game screen and its
technological capability give Lynx an edge over the handheld Game
Boy from Nintendo of America Inc., which diplays a fuzzier image in
black and white.
   However, Lynx retails for around $179, compared with $89.99 for
Game Boy. Both systems come with one game cartridge each, cables to
link machines and certain other accessories. Individual games for
Lynx cost $35 to $40 while Game Boy's average around $25.
   Atari spared no hyperbole in touting the new device Tuesday at a
New York news conference. The company said Lynx ``has been called
the most innovative consumer electronics product since ... the Sony
Walkman.''
   ``The first day that I saw it ... it just blew my mind,'' Atari
President Sam Tramiel gushed.
   Lynx has gotten raves from reviewers and retailers expect it to
sell well, benefiting from the continuing popularity of home video
game systems that hook up to televisions.
   ``We're very enthusiastic about it,'' said John Sullivan, a
buyer for Toys `R' Us Inc. who attended Atari's news conference.
   Jeffrey Rothenberg, a buyer for FAO Schwarz, said the Lynx price
tag of $179 seems justifiable given the quality of the hardware and
the software.
   ``We'll have to see how the customer reacts,'' he said.
   Fewer than 70,000 Lynx systems will be available in the United
States before Christmas _ and then only in New York area stores.
Five game cartridges will be ready for holiday sales. Atari said
full national distribution will begin in the first half of 1990 and
about a dozen titles will be brought out then with dozens more
expected later in the year.
   Nintendo, which has said the 1.1 million Game Boys it intends to
ship for Christmas won't meet even half of the demand, has five
cartridges available for Game Boy and plans to have 10 in stores
before the year's end.
   Atari President Tramiel blasted Nintendo for unfairly dominating
the video game business. The Sunnyvale, Calif.-based Atari has
lawsuits pending against Nintendo, charging that the company uses
monopolistic practices to lock out competitors.
   Tramiel accused Nintendo's Japanese parent company, Nintendo Co.
Ltd., of using ``strong-arm tactics'' to try to thwart Atari's
recent launch of Lynx in Tokyo. Nintendo threatened to withhold its
merchandise from distributors that began carrying Lynx, according
to Tramiel.
   Nintendo has said the charges are groundless.
   Tramiel said Atari, which pioneered home video games about 10
years ago, is gaining a good reputation as a consumer electronics
company, particularly in Europe, and intends to fight for a share
of the electronic games market.
   ``We are the only U.S. company left in the game business,''
Tramiel said. ``We do not plan to sit back and let Japan take us
over.''

<HEAD>There's More to Toy Shopping Than Video Games This Year</HEAD>

   Though video games again will be a big hit under
Christmas trees this year, dolls familiar from parents' childhoods,
speedy new miniature cars and other traditional-type toys are
expected to be popular.
   U.S. toymakers likely will have only ho-hum sales during the
crucial holiday season, but business still promises to be slightly
better than last year's flat sales performance.
   ``Most manufacturers are looking at flat sales again. My gut
feeling is it's going to be a little better than anticipated,''
said Larry Carlat, editor of the trade magazine Toy &amp; Hobby World.
   Michael Goldstein, vice chairman of Toys `R' Us Inc., said the
retailer forsees good holiday business based on the performance of
a proven lineup.
   ``We expect to have a good Christmas with strength in video,
dolls, action figures and die-cast cars,'' he said.
   Sales remain brisk for Nintendo home video game systems,
compatible game cartridges and other gadgets that work with the
machines that turn televisions into game screens.
   Fancier, pricier machines from other manufacturers, featuring
souped up graphics, also are moving quickly, confirming that the
three-year-old video game fad hasn't faded.
   From NEC Corp. comes the TurboGrafx-16 system and Sega of
America Inc. is offering Genesis. Both retail for around $200,
making them about twice the price of Nintendo's device.
   Handheld computer games could satisfy shoppers searching for
something slightly different _ if they can find them.
   Transistor radio-sized Game Boy from Nintendo is selling fast at
about $89.99 and the company says it doesn't expect to have nearly
enough to meet demand.
   On Tuesday, Nintendo rival Atari Corp. unveiled its own handheld
video game, called Lynx. It sells for a stiff $179, but features
sharper, color graphics compared with Game Boy's fuzzier,
black-and-white images.
   Nintendo has been a standout for the past two Christmases while
the rest of the toy business was slumping. Nintendo of America
Inc., the U.S. subsidiary of Japan's Nintendo Co. Ltd., estimates
that its sales will grow to $2.6 billion this year from $1.7
billion in 1988. Industrywide, electronic game sales will rise to
$3.4 billion from $2.3 billion, Nintendo says.
   Nintendo's success has come at the expense of American
toymakers, who have been controlling costs more closely and taking
a cautious approach to new product introductions for fear that a
major flop could mean major losses.
   The cost controls and caution have helped U.S. companies
maintain profitability despite lackluster sales growth.
   ``In 1989, we've seen every toy company run a very tight ship,''
said analyst David S. Leibowitz of American Securities Corp. ``The
bottom line for most of the major toy companies will be running
significantly further ahead than the top line.''
   The toy industry is expecting sales, excluding electronics, as
high as $13.25 billion this year, according to the Toy
Manufacturers of America, a trade group. The bulk of that business
is done at Christmas. Sales totaled $12.75 billion in 1988, a small
improvement from 1987's $12.5 billion.
   Besides the wave of video games, this year's popular toys are
likely to include many that have been around for awhile in one form
or another, stores and industry experts say.
   Mattel Inc.'s Barbie remains the darling of the doll world, and
after 30 hasn't encountered a newcomer she can't clobber in sales.
Barbies start at about $11.
   Bigger dolls, some new, some old, also have hit their potential
this year. Oopsie Daisy, a doll that crawls, falls down and crawls
again, is selling well, said Angela Bourdon of Toys `R' Us. The
16-nch baby doll from Tyco Toys Inc. costs around $35.
   The winsomely ugly Cabbage Patch Kids, under new parent company
Hasbro, are attempting a comeback and trying to repeat the buying
hysteria they created in the mid-1980s.
   Other hot dolls are Mattel's Li'l Miss Dressup and Li'l Miss
Makeup, gurgling Baby Bubbles, Tiny Tears and Betsy Wetsy under the
Ideal brand name, and Dolly Surprise from Hasbro Inc.'s Playskool
division.
   Action figures, which start at under $10, will have another busy
Christmas. Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles from Playmates Toys Inc.,
Real Ghostbusters and Robocop from Tonka Corp.'s Kenner Products
division are some red-hot figures, as is the granddaddy of them
all, Hasbro's G.I. Joe.
   Miniature cars have proven their popularity and should have
another good year, led by Lewis Galoob Toys Inc.'s Micro Machines.
   Super fast cars were rolled out for this Christmas amid much
fanfare but toy watchers say sales could stall once the initial
advertising roar dies down. The battery-powered vehicles have been
a smash in Japan since debuting there in late 1987. Sporting names
like Hyper Drivers and Record Breakers, these high-performance
model racing cars zoom at around 30 miles an hour.
   The electronic game craze has renewed interest in board games.
Some of the sought-after titles include Encore and Shark Attack
from Hasbro's Milton Bradley Co.
   But analysts doubt any of the abundant lineup of toys will be
sensational enough to steal the limelight from video games.
   ``There are not a lot of new products that are making noise,''
said Carlat, of Toy &amp; Hobby World. ``There's no blockbuster _
except Nintendo.''

<TEXT>
   Global wheat supplies are at their lowest
level since the early 1970s, but an Agriculture Department report
predicts larger crops next year.
   World wheat output in 1989-90 is forecast at a record 532
million metric tons, up 6 percent from last year. Although
consumption is expected to rise only 1 percent, demand will once
again exceed supply.
   ``Many have expressed concerns that current low stocks will not
be sufficient to buffer large production shortfalls,'' the
department's Economic Research Service said in a preliminary report
Tuesday.
   ``However,'' it added, ``relatively high world prices and the
lower acreage reduction requirements in the U.S. 1990 wheat program
are expected to result in an increase in world production next
year.''
   The 1989-90 U.S. wheat marketing year began June 1 and includes
this year's harvest of 2.04 billion bushels, about 55.6 million
tons. Agency economists project that wheat prices at the farm might
average $3.85 to $4 per bushel over the entire marketing year,
compared with $3.72 in 1988-89.
   But the agency also cautioned that ``greater-than-expected
export demand or problems with next year's crop would be the most
likely causes of a sharp price run-up in the second half of the
marketing year.''
   In another report, the government's Joint Agricultural Weather
Facility, operated by the Commerce and Agriculture departments,
said that winter wheat planted this fall for the 1990 harvest was
in ``mostly fair to good'' condition in the week of Nov. 13-19.
   ``High winds and lack of soil moisture caused condition to
decline in the Great Plains, especially in Nebraska,'' the report
said. ``In Kansas, Oklahoma and Texas, poor secondary root
development forced producers to limit (livestock) grazing'' on fall
wheat pasture.
   The winter wheat crop was said to be ``good to fair'' in Montana
and Colorado, and ``fair to good'' in Oregon, ``good to fair'' in
Washington and ``good'' in Idaho. Corn Belt winter wheat was
reported in ``good to fair'' condition.

<HEAD>Analysts: Japanese Patent Could Mean Millions for Texas Instruments</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By EVAN RAMSTAD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>DALLAS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Texas Instruments Inc. could reap hundreds of
millions of dollars in royalties a year from Japanese computer-chip
manufacturers if a patent granted recently by Japan for the basic
computer chip is enforced, analysts say.
   Texas Instruments officials on Tuesday confirmed Japan's
decision to issue the patent late last month for the integrated
circuit, which Texas Instruents' engineer Jack Kilby first
demonstrated in September 1958.
   ``It is TI's belief that this basic patent covers virtually all
integrated circuits manufactured in Japan,'' said Stan Victor, a
Texas Instruments spokesman.
   Texas Instruments officials refused to speculate how much money
the Dallas-based company could make from the royalties over the
11-year life of the patent.
   But Richard J. Agnich, a Texas Instruments senior vice
president, said, ``We believe that a long-term trend supporting
enforcement of intellectual property rights is now in place, and
that the opportunity exists for TI to earn a significant ongoing
stream of royalty income.''
   Analysts said the patent could also aid Texas Instruments as it
renegotiates licensing agreements for its products with a Japanese
firms in 1990.
   ``As we're renegotiating our license agreements, this becomes
part of our intellectual portfolio,'' Victor said.
   Kiyo Ota of Nomura Research Institute said Texas Instruments,
with the patent, could negotiate strong agreements in product areas
in which the company is not currently involved, such as
high-definition television.
   The integrated circuit is found in every computer and most
electronic devices and its discovery helped Texas Instruments
become one of the world's first high-technology companies.
   But Japan has become the world's largest chip producer, making
as many chips as all other nations combined.
   U.S. companies are battling to regain dominance in the
semiconductor field. In one such effort, several companies,
including Texas Instruments, and the government formed the
Austin-based Sematech consortium to bolster semiconductor research.
   Texas Instruments shares jumped $2.50 Tuesday to close at $32 on
the New York Stock Exchange after news of the patent reached the
market. The number of TI shares changing hands totaled more than
2.16 million, compared with average daily volume of about 371,000
shares.
   The Japanese journal Nihon Keizai Shimbun reported that
integrated circuit manufacturers in Japan could pay patent fees of
a minimum of 3 percent of the total value of their chip production
to Texas Instruments.
   Two analysts said such royalties could exceed $100 million
annually to the electronics and defense company. The Japanese
journal reported an even higher figure, saying Texas Instruments
could be paid $600 million to $700 million a year based on the size
of the Japanese integrated circuit market, which saw sales of $15
billion to $17 billion this year.
   ``If I were to make an operating guess on the front end, and I
would underline guess, this could mean $100 million a year to TI.
That would be a reasonable first working guess,'' said David
Garcia, an analyst with Howard, Weil, Labouisse, Friedrichs, a New
Orleans brokerage.
   Ota said the figure could reach $500 million annually from a 3
percent royalty, but added that negotiations on joint ventures and
cross licensing agreements could lower the percentage.
   Texas Instruments earned $255.8 million on sales of $4.66
billion for the first nine months of this year. Its revenue for the
period included $125 million in royalties.
   The company originally asked for the Japanese patent in 1960,
but the Japan Patent Office did not make its award for a
``semiconductor device'' until Oct. 30. The patent will last until
Nov. 27, 2001, Texas Instruments said.
   Kilby and Texas Instruments were awarded a U.S. patent for the
integrated circuit in 1964.

<TEXT>
   Media tycoon Christopher Skase, who
just six weeks ago was on the verge of becoming a Hollywood studio
magnate, has joined the growing ranks of fallen Australian
corporate giants.
   A year ago, the former fianance reporter was hailed as a
whiz-kid after buying the Channel 7 television network in Australia
and at age 41 becoming the nation's youngest media baron.
   But after weeklong crisis talks with his bankers, Skase's Qintex
Australia Ltd. went into receivership Tuesday with debts of $1.6
billion. His undoing followed a failed $1.5 billion bid for the
U.S. movie company MGM-UA Communications Co.
   Skase's swift fall was helped by media magnate Rupert Murdoch's
counterbidding for MGM-UA. MGM-UA terminated its proposed deal with
Qintex after the Australian company failed to produce a $50 million
letter of credit.
   Skase made his fortune buying a run-down retail company in
Tasmania 15 years ago called Qintex and turning it into a media
conglomerate by buying and selling radio stations and upscale
resorts in Queensland and Hawaii.
   He is the latest victim of a series of corporate collapses that
have claimed some of the big names in Australian business, such as:
   _George Herscu, whose Hooker Corp., with $1 billion worth of
holdings in the United States, went into receivership earlier this
year. Hooker said last week it will close six of its seven B.
Altman department stores in the United States after failing to find
a buyer. Its other U.S. holdings include the Bonwit Teller fashion
chain and several shopping malls.
   _Alan Bond, whose media and brewing empire has debts of $7
billion. An official audit last week questioned the viability of it
continuing as an ``ongoing concern.'' His holdings include the G.
Heileman Brewing Co. of the United States.
   _Robert Holmes a Court, who reportedly was Australia's richest
man until the October 1987 stock market crash wounded him.
   _Ariadne Australia Ltd., headed by New Zealand high-flyer Bruce
Judge, which was one of Australia's fastest-growing companies until
the stock market crash saw it report a major operating loss in 1988.
   _Laurie Connell, whose Rothwells Ltd. investment bank collapsed
after the stock market crash.
   Skase fell from budding Hollywood studio magnate to the ranks of
Australia's corporate losers in just six weeks. In September, he
was on the verge of wrapping up the biggest deal of his life. By
November, he was locked in a fight for corporate survival.
   Unable to deliver the letter of credit after bidding for MGM-UA,
Skase was forced to put his U.S. affiliate, Los Angeles-based
Qintex Entertainment Inc., in Chapter 11 bankruptcy-court
protection from creditors. The Australian Stock Exchange then
suspended trading in Qintex shares when the company failed to
respond to its queries about its finances.
   The company applied to the Supreme Court in Victoria state late
Monday to enter receivership to prevent the group's foreign and
Australian banks from trying to sell its assets.
   The collapse raised the prospect that Channel 7, one of three
national networks, could be taken over by foreign banks, in
violation of Australia's foreign ownership laws. It coincided with
an investigation by regulators into the finances of all three
commercial television networks following ownership changes that
have plunged the industry into financial crisis.
   Peter Buchanan, a lawyer representing Qintex Australia and a
group of associated companies, told the Supreme Court on Tuesday
that the company wants to keep operating in an attempt to pay its
creditors.
   Buchanan said it was vital that Seven Network and other Qintex
television stations continue operating so they do not lose their
broadcasting licences.
   The Supreme Court said the Qintex group had fallen into serious
financial difficulty and that the group's affairs were ``complex
and interrelated.''
   It said the significant advantage of a court-appointed receiver
and manager was that the group's affairs would be managed as a
whole.
   Qintex's problems have highlighted a growing concern about
corporate debt in Australia. Seventy-five percent of the nation's
$1.8 billion foreign debt is from the private sector.

   Striking telephone workers reached a tentative
settlement with New York Telephone and its parent Nynex early
Wednesday to end a 16-week-old, sometimes violent walkout, a union
spokesman said. Nynex declined to confirm that.
   The settlement was announced by Bob Master, spokesman for the
striking Communications Workers of America. However, a Nynex
spokesman, John Bonomo, said he was not aware of any agreement.
   ``We have a settlement with our signature ready, which has not
been signed'' by the CWA, Bonomo said.
   If ratified, the 40,000 striking CWA members would begin
returning to work on Monday.
   ``With this proposed accord, we have saved our health care,''
said Jan Pierce, CWA vice president.
   ``The enormous sacrifices that our members made, their will,
their strength, their bedrock commitment, their unbreakable spirit
will never be forgotten.''
   The report of the settlement came one day after 20,000 members
of the CWA's allies, the International Brotherhood of Electrical
Workers, went back to work for New England Telephone.
   The IBEW and CWA members went on strike Aug. 6 against Nynex,
one of four regional telephone companies struck that week. Actions
against the other three companies were settled by September.
   The biggest issue in the Nynex strike was a company attempt to
shift the cost of health benefits.
   The settlement does not include any health-care cost-shifting or
deductibles, said Master. Nor does it include a lump-sum bonus or
profit-sharing plan the company had previously offered.
   It includes wage increases of 3 percent the first year and 1.5
percent in each of the remaining two years of the contract, plus a
cost-of-living allowance in the second and third years.

   Financier Charles H. Keating Jr. has nothing
to say to Congress about his failed Lincoln Savings and Loan
Association or the estimated $2 billion the collapse will cost
taxpayers.
   Keating refused to answer questions Tuesday from the House
Banking Committee, citing his Fifth Amendment protection against
self-incrimination.
   The Phoenix, Ariz., millionaire's brief appearance late in the
afternoon came after lawmakers sharply criticized M. Danny Wall,
the nation's chief thrift regulator. Wall received little sympathy
during 10 hours of testimony in which he denied responsibility for
the cost to taxpayers of the Lincoln bailout.
   Rep. Henry B. Gonzalez, D-Texas, the committee's chairman, has
called for Wall's resignation and said the regulator's political
future in part depended on his performance before the committee.
However, both Democrats and Republicans said they were unimpressed
by his response.
   ``Somehow it rings very hollow to say the huge regulatory
bureaucracy could do nothing, did nothing, as the institution went
down,'' Gonzalez said.
   ``The thrust that I get out of the testimony is `poor Danny
Wall, too busy to do the job that I have been assigned to do,'''
said Rep. Jim Bunning, R-Ky.
   The committee has been focusing on why Wall rejected a May 1987
recommendation from field examiners in San Francisco that the
government seize Lincoln, based in Irvine, Calif., and stop its
losses.
   Wall and his two top aides, enforcement director Rosemary
Stewart and supervision director Darrel Dochow, maintain that the
San Francisco officials never gathered the legal proof needed to
shut Lincoln down.
   The discrepancies between the testimony from Wall and his aides
and witnesses from earlier hearings was so great that Rep. Chalmers
Wylie of Ohio, the panel's senior Republican, declared: ``The areas
of disagreement are disparate enough that someone has perjured
himself.''
   Before and after his appearance, Keating rebuffed reporters'
shouted questions. But, he issued a written statement saying it is
possible he will testify after his legal problems are resolved.
   As chairman of Lincoln's parent company, American Continental
Corp., Keating faces a federal grand jury investigation in Los
Angeles. He is the target of a $1.1 billion fraud and racketeering
suit brought by federal regulators.
   Committee aides were hoping that Keating, who has a reputation
for outspokenness, would be unable to resist responding to the
previous torrent of criticism.
   But Keating said, ``On the advice of counsel, I respectfully
exercise my constitutional prerogative and privilege ... and
decline to answer questions here today.''
   Late in the hearing, Gonzalez revealed that documents examined
by the committee show that on the day before Lincoln was seized by
the government _ April 13, 1989 _ Wall received two telephone calls
from a Keating associate, Barbara Thomas. She is a former member of
the Securities and Exchange Commission under President Carter.
   Wall said he could remember only that he received the calls and
that Thomas was urging approval of an application to sell Lincoln,
which the agency turned down.
   Gonzalez pointed out that as the calls were made, American
Continental was declaring bankruptcy. Regulators say that action
complicates their efforts to reduce the estimated $2 billion cost
of the failure to taxpayers.
   According to committee aides, American Continental made a
$250,000 unsecured, three-year loan to Thomas in December 1987.
   Gonzalez said he will decide later whether further hearings are
necessary to explore other aspects of the Lincoln disaster.
   In a separate development Tuesday, Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz.,
wrote the Senate Ethics Committee that he never acted improperly on
behalf of Lincoln although Keating gave him $112,000 in campaign
money and use of an airplane.
   ``I have every confidence that you and the committee will
determine that there has been no improper conduct on my part and
that you will clear my name,'' McCain wrote Ethics Committee
Chairman Howell Heflin, D-Ala., and Vice Chairman Warren Rudman,
R-N.H.
   McCain is one of five senators who received campaign money from
Keating and in April 1987 met with regulators to discuss their
supervision of Lincoln. All five lawmakers have denied wrongdoing,
but the Ethics Committee has hired an outside counsel to gather
information in the case.

   Charles H. Keating Jr., and his family,
accused of stealing millions of dollars from his failed savings and
loan, have large sums of money in bank accounts and companies
abroad, according to court papers and congressional testimony.
   Keating, the head of American Continental Corp., the Phoenix
holding company that owned the Lincoln Savings and Loan
Association, still holds accounts in London, Paris and at least
three cities in Switzerland, Geneva, Zurich and Lausanne, court
papers say.
   In one case, Keating channeled more than $10 million in Lincoln
funds to the Panama-based Southbrook Holding Co., which federal
examiners said was owned by American Continental.
   ``It doesn't surprise me that Mr. Keating finally found Gen.
Manual Antonio Noriega because that's one reason Noriega has been
able to survive ... You have a tremendous volume of bank, corporate
monies there,'' House Banking Committee Chairman Henry Gonzalez,
D-Texas, said at a recent hearing.
   The failure of Lincoln is expected to cost taxpayers $2 billion,
making it the nation's costliest savings and loan failure.
   Keating's dealings overseas were detailed in a class action
lawsuit filed in Los Angeles this week on behalf of thousands of
people who bought $250 million in worthless junk bonds issued by
American Continental.
   Keating, who still earns $400,000 annually as the chairman of
the bankrupt American Continental, denies wrongdoing in the Lincoln
case. He claims he is the victim of harassment by the federal
government.
   Other information came out at a hearing on Irvine, Calif.,-based
Lincoln before the House Banking Committee.
   Joseph W. Cotchett, an attorney in Burlingame, Calif., who
represents bond holders, alleged in court papers that ``Keating and
his immediate family received well over $34 million of Lincoln
money for their own personal use.''
   Keating and his wife, Mary Elaine, also used the American
Continental jet ``to make frequent trips to Switzerland, France,
England and Ireland,'' Cotchett said.
   The lawsuit shows a host of complicated financial transactions,
some of which Cotchett claims were designed to cover up phony deals.
   For instance, the papers said Keating's son, Charles Keating
III, once visited Switzerland ostensibly to set up a foreign
currency trading company with others in Zurich and in Dusseldorf,
Germany. The senior Keating eventually paid a firm called
Gesellschaft Fur Trend Analysen some $20 million for unknown
reasons, the lawsuit said.
   ``It is alleged that payments served as sham transactions to
cover up Keating's transfer of monies from the United States to
Switzerland,'' the suit said.
   The lawsuit contends that in a similar transaction, Keating used
Lincoln money to form a subsidiary called Dungiven Investments.
Dungiven then diverted $17.5 million to a Bahamian investment
trading company called Trendinvest Ltd.
   ``Millions of dollars were channeled through this subsidiary in
supposed losses before the stock was sold back to Trendinvest,''
the lawsuit said.
   This was a sham to hide the transfer of money from the United
States to offshore banks, Cotchett said.
   Keating's American Continental also had ties to the London-based
Kuwaiti Investment Office, which makes real estate investments on
behalf of the Kuwait government.
   Specifically, Kuwaiti Investment had a 45 percent interest in
The Phoenician Resort, a 605-room luxury complex near Scottsdale,
Ariz. The resort was owned by Lincoln.
   Last week, federal regulators dismissed Keating and 23 family
members and associates from positions at the Phoenician.

<TEXT>
   The union for striking telephone workers, which
reported a tentative settlement with New York Telephone and its
parent NYNEX early Wednesday, later said the announcement was
premature but an accord still was near.
   ``We had a tentative settlement; it wasn't signed,'' Bob Master,
a spokesman for the Communications Workers of America said
Wednesday. He said he expected an agreement before the day was
over, but details still were being ironed out.
   It was the second on-again, off-again announcement of an accord
in the rancorous 15-week strike. The first was eight days earlier,
when management said a settlement was in hand and the CWA
contradicted the statement.
   This time it was NYNEX that said the long-awaited settlement had
not actually materialized.
   A NYNEX spokesman, John Bonomo, agreed, however, that it should
not be far off.
   ``We have a settlement with our signature ready, which has not
been signed'' by the CWA, he said Wednesday.
   One striker died in a picket-line accident during the walkout
over health care issues which affected service to millions of
customers.
   Any deal would have to be ratified by the CWA membership. If
ratified, the 40,000 striking CWA members would begin returning to
work Dec. 4.
   The two sides met Tuesday and Wednesday.
   On Monday, 20,000 members of the CWA's allied union, the
International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers, went back to work
for New England Telephone, also a NYNEX subsidiary.
   Members of the two unions went on strike Aug. 6 against NYNEX,
one of four regional telephone companies struck that week. Actions
against the other three companies were settled by September.
   The biggest issue in the NYNEX strike was a company attempt to
shift the cost of health care to the workers, with costs ranging up
to $1,500 a year.
   The unsigned settlement did not include any health-care
cost-shifting or deductibles, said Master. Nor did it include a
lump-sum bonus or profit-sharing plan the company had offered
previously.

   Lockheed Corp. said Texas billionaire
Harold C. Simmons has announced his intention to increase his
ownership of Lockheed stock to 15 percent from 10.6 percent.
   The Dallas investor has been buying stock since last year in the
defense contractor, which among other things builds the
radar-evading stealth fighter plane. His average cost per share has
been $48, according to analyst Howard Rubel with the Cyrus J.
Lawrence Inc. brokerage in New York.
   Lockheed's stock had fallen well below that level recently.
   It was battered by the announcement last week that Lockheed is
$300 million over budget on development of a sub-hunting plane for
the Navy and may show a loss for the year. The stock also was hurt
by Defense Secretary Dick Cheney's statements over the weekend that
he plans to significantly cut defense spending.
   The stock closed up $1.12{ to $37 Tuesday on the New York Stock
Exchange.
   That would mean Simmons has shown a paper loss of more than $74
million on the 6.74 million shares he had purchased before
Tuesday's announcement that he wanted to buy more.
   ``Mr. Simmons obviously is making an attempt to salvage some of
his losses'' by hoping the stock price rises again, Rubel said.
   Simmons revealed his plan to buy additional stock in a letter
received Tuesday by Daniel M. Tellep, Lockheed's chairman, the
company said.
   In response to speculation he might try to take over the
company, Lockheed created an employee stock ownership plan that
holds 17 percent of the company's stock, effectively blocking an
unfriendly takeover.
   Lockheed also has a ``poison pill'' plan to discourage hostile
suitors. As amended last December, when Simmons announced he would
increase his investment in Lockheed to more than $15 million, the
plan allows shareholders to buy stock at a discount if a group or
person acquires 20 percent of the company's common shares
outstanding.
   In a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission in
October, Simmons said had not changed his plans for his stake in
Lockheed. In his original statement he said his purchases were
``for purposes of investment and in order to acquire a significant
equity interest in the company.''

   Less than a week after Avon Products Inc.
announced it was prepared to fight any takeover advances, an
investor group headed by Texas financier Robert M. Bass disclosed
it has increased its stake in Avon to 5.9 percent.
   While the Bass group said it bought 2.5 million more Avon shares
``for investment purposes,'' it said it might seek discussions with
the cosmetics company's management or other shareholders.
   The disclosure came Tuesday in a filing with the Securities and
Exchange Commission in Washington.
   An Avon spokesman in New York said Bass telephoned Avon Chairman
James E. Preston on Monday, informed him about the planned filing
and said the stake was acquired for investment purposes.
   ``We're taking it for face value,'' the spokesman, John Cox,
said of Bass's explanation. Cox said the Bass Group ``has been a
significant holder of the company's stock since December of last
year.''
   Ms. Sam Moore, office manager at Bass's Ft. Worth, Texas,
office, said ``we have a policy of not discussing business with the
news media.''
   Earlier this year Avon fended off two separate takeover
proposals, rebuffed an overture by another investor group and
repeatedly insisted that it wants to remain independent.
   In its SEC filing, Bass said his group had purchased a total of
2.5 million shares between Oct. 3 and Nov. 17 for prices ranging
between $27.35 and $36.80 per share.
   The filing said the shares were purchased ``for investment
purposes,'' and said the group may have discussions in the future
with Avon management about the company's recent operating history,
general business outlook and prospects.
   The filing said the group also may ``engage in discussions with
other persons, including other shareholders'' of Avon.
   Last week, Avon sought to repel unwanted takeover advances from
an alliance of investors, including oil heir Gordon P. Getty, a
senior executive of Mary Kay Corp. and the Fisher real estate
family of New York.
   The group, a limited partnership called Chartwell Associates,
has indicated it owned 6.9 percent of Avon's outstanding shares,
intended to acquire more shares and might propose a merger with
Avon.
   Earlier this year, Avon rejected outright takeover proposals
totaling $2.1 billion by the rival direct sales company Amway Corp.
of Ada, Mich., and $2.85 billion by Minneapolis-based investor
Irwin Jacobs.
   Avon also fended off takeover feelers from Mary Kay, like Avon,
a leading direct-seller of cosmetics.
   Avon stock rose 75 cents to $36.12{ a share in consolidated New
York Stock Exchange trading on Tuesday.

   A federal appeals court has taken up a
challenge to a Securities and Exchange Commission rule that the
agency says eliminates unequal voting rights among corporate
shareholders.
   But the Business Roundtable, an association representing chief
executives of 200 major corporations, claims the rule interferes
with corporate governance, which comes under the jurisdiction of
individual states.
   The SEC claims it has a right to impose the rule as part of its
mission under the 1934 law that created it: to protect public
shareholders.
   Both sides presented arguments to a three-judge panel of the
U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia on
Tuesday.
   The panel, consisting of circuit judges James L. Buckley,
Stephen F. Williams and Harry T. Edwards, reserved decision.
   SEC Rule 19c-4, adopted in July 1988, prohibits publicly traded
corporations from weakening the voting power of those who own
existing stock by issuing new classes of stock with superior or
``supervoting'' rights.
   The SEC may bar an offending company's stock from being listed
on any stock exchange regulated by the SEC or with the National
Association of Securities Dealers stock quotation system.
   ``The SEC turns the statute on its head,'' said Robert D.
Rosenbaum, attorney for the Business Rountable, which ranges from
such corporate giants as American Express Co. to Xerox Corp., and
Quaker Oats Co. to and Citicorp.
   Although the SEC is trying to protect the shareholder voting
rights, the rule would prevent company executives from issuing
stock that could give insiders the power to thwart a hostile
takeover, said Rosenbaum.
   The Business Roundtable sought to have the appeals court find
either that the SEC exceeded its authority in imposing the rule, or
that the section of securities law that gives the SEC such power
should be declared unconstitutional.
   In legal papers submitted to the appeals court, the Business
Roundtable contended the publicly traded companies affected by the
Rule 19c-4 ``would be banished from trading in the nation's public
securities markets if they took any action or issued any security
prohibited by the rule, including actions they are otherwise
permitted to take under state law.''
   Rosenbaum told reporters outside the courtroom the group
believed it was up to corporations and their shareholders to decide
how to allocate voting power, as required by federal law.
   ``The SEC claims the power, not just to regulate but to approve
certain capital structures,'' he said.
   But Jacob H. Stillman, associate general counsel for the SEC
countered: ``We're not attempting to do these broad things they
claim.''
   Without the supervoting rights rule, ``shareholders could be
stripped of their ability to participate in management, and
confidence in the securities markets could be impaired,'' the SEC
said in its legal brief.
   ``Voting rights can't be taken away from existing shareholders,
that's all this case deals with,'' said Stillman.
   The state of Ohio filed a friend-of-the-court brief contending
the SEC was usurping the states' authority over corporate
governance. Without a clear indication otherwise by Congress, ``the
SEC should not be given the authority that Congress, itself, has
not exercised,'' said Cordelia A. Glenn, an Ohio assistant attorney
general.
   The brief was joined by Delaware, Kentucky, Michigan, Idaho,
Pennsylvania, Wyoming, Nebraska, North Carolina, Missouri, Georgia
and West Virginia.

<TEXT>
   The new navy blue uniforms for flight attendants
at Eastern Airlines and Continental Airlines have some striking
Eastern employees seeing red.
   Attendants at the two airlines, both subsidiaries of Texas Air
Corp., are trading in their old uniforms _ a purplish color at
Continental and brown at Eastern _ for new navy blue outfits.
   The new uniforms due early next year have fueled speculation
that Texas Air Chairman Frank Lorenzo's master plan is to combine
the two airlines, as the striking Eastern unions have long charged.
   ``It sounds like some kind of a move toward unification,'' Ted
Bybel, a striking Eastern pilot, said Tuesday. ``The uniform is a
very strong symbol.''
   Eastern has been in Chapter 11 bankruptcy reorganization since
early March, when its pilots, Machinists and flight attendants
struck the Miami-based airline. Eastern has been replacing the
union workers and rebuilding as a smaller carrier.
   Lorenzo put Houston-based Continental through a Chapter 11
bankruptcy in 1983, also restructuring it as a non-union carrier.
He said last August that he is considering selling all or part of
Continental.
   The unions have charged that Lorenzo has repeatedly siphoned off
Eastern assets to Continental as part of a plan to eventually merge
the two.
   The airlines have refuted the charges. Texas Air spokesman Art
Kent in Houston said Tuesday that the timing of the new uniforms is
only a coincidence, since they have been in the planning stage for
more than a year at Continental and since shortly after Eastern's
bankruptcy filing.
   ``It's a very professional color,'' Kent said in a telephone
interview, referring to the new navy blue.
   He noted that the new Continental uniforms are double-breasted
while Eastern's are single-breasted, and the stripes on the two
sets differ.
   Navy blue has become the color of choice for airline uniforms,
Kent said, noting that carriers including United Airlines and
American Airlines use it.

   Japan will contribute $150 million to an economic

$1 billion from Western nations, Kyodo News Service reported
Wednesday.
   Quoting unidentified government sources, Kyodo said Japan would
pledge the contribution at a meeting of aid donors in Brussels on

   Together with promised emergency food aid and other assistance,
this would bring Japan's aid to Poland in the current fiscal year

   United Airlines says it plans to raise fares on
most domestic routes and eliminate discount fares used primarily by
business travelers.
   United, the nation's second-largest airline, said Tuesday that
as of Nov. 30, its first-class, one-way fares will increase by $8,
while full-fare and some discounted coach prices will go up by $5.
The increases don't apply to Maxsaver, the airline's biggest
discounted advance purchase fares.
   The airline said it also was eliminating on Nov. 29 its same-day
purchase Supercoach fares that are used almost exclusively by
business travelers.
   Trans World Airlines, Midway Airlines and Continental Airlines
said they will match most of the increases. American, Delta, USAir
and Eastern said they are studying the issue.
   The price increases are needed because of higher operating
costs, primarily fuel expenses, which advanced by 16 percent in the
third quarter, said United spokesman Rob Doughty.
   Analysts are predicting operating losses in the industry for the
current quarter and continued higher costs next year.
   However, some analysts noted a slowdown in passenger traffic
growth and questioned whether the increases would hold up.
   ``In view of weaker traffic increases, I'd be surprised if
United's action held up across the board,'' said Robert Decker, an
analyst with Duff &amp; Phelps Inc. in Chicago.

<TEXT>
   Saatchi and Saatchi Co. PLC, the world's biggest
advertising agency, on Wednesday announced the departure of Andrew
Woods, the deputy chairman of the company's U.S. unit.
   Woods, who was also a Saatchi board member resigned from New
York-based Saatchi and Saatchi Consulting Ltd. to ``pursue other
business interests,'' the company said.
   Jeremy Sinclair, who was joint deputy chairman with Woods,
retains the title of deputy chairman and will serve solely in that
capacity, the company said.
   Saatchi said Woods' resignation was precipitated by the
company's decision to scale-down U.S. acquisitions substantially.
Woods' main function at Saatchi was to oversee the company's
expansion in the United States, it said.
   Woods, who had been finance director since joining Saatchi in
1984, was given the title of deputy chairman with responsibility
for overseeing Saatchi's consultants' business in May.
   In October, Saatchi appointed a new chief executive, French
entrepreneur Robert Louis Dreyfus, and a finance director, Charles
Scott.
   Woods' future with Saatchi was brought into question when the

<HEAD>Philip Morris Expected to Offer Home Delivery of Exclusive Brand
of Cigarettes</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Philip Morris Cos. is expected to offer credit
card holders home delivery of its Cartier Vendome cigarettes early
next year, the Wall Street Journal reported today.
   Marketing consultants say the New York-based tobacco giant is
counting on the technique to give Cartier Vendome an added air of
exclusivity. The company introduced the pearl-tipped cigarettes in
Los Angeles in October. They were previously available only in
Europe.
   Though Philip Morris executives said two months ago they would
try ``home subscriptions,'' they refused to discuss any aspect of
the plan, the Journal reported.
   ``It strikes me as an innovative strategy,'' said George
Widemann, president of Grey Direct, the direct-marketing division
of Grey Advertising. ``But one with interesting precedents in other
product categories.''
   Packaged-goods companies are relying more and more on
direct-marketing tactics, such as catalogues and newsletters, to
reach the small markets for their products.
   Experts say the direct-marketing approach would provide tobacco
companies with lists of dedicated smokers. Cigarette advertising on
television has been prohibited since 1971.
   The market for luxury tobacco comprises less than 1 percent of
total cigarette sales in the United States.
   Cartier Vendome cigarettes, packed in oval boxes bearing the
House of Cartier's logo, cost about twice as much as an average
pack of cigarettes.
   Philip Morris is distributing the brand through upscale hotels,
restaurants and tobacco shops.
   Because taxes account for a large percentage of cigarette
prices, some direct-marketing experts say Philip Morris may find
barriers to selling mail-order cigarettes across state lines.
   Several states are requiring direct mailers to charge their
customers state sales tax.
   ``It's one of the top issues facing the direct-marketing
industry,'' said Robert L. Sherman, general counsel for the Direct
Marketing Association.

<HEAD>GM May Cut 25 Percent of White-Collar Work Force, Newspaper Report
Says</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DETROIT (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   General Motors Corp., which has been on a
company-wide cost-cutting program for three years, is looking at
slashing its white-collar work force 25 percent by the mid-1990s,
it was reported today.
   The Wall Street Journal said it had obtained an internal GM memo
indicating the company was looking into a plan that would eliminate
about 5,000 jobs a year, or as many as 25,000 total, for the next
five years.
   Details of the plan haven't been completed and employees have
not been notified about it, the newspaper said. The memo said the
cuts would be described to GM's top managers Nov. 30.
   GM spokeswoman Patricia Malloy declined to confirm or deny the
memo or whether such a plan was under consideration.
   ``Are we looking at head count? We continue to look at
employment levels,'' she said. ``As we head into the '90s, having
the right number of people with the right skills who are adding
value throughout the corporation is absolutely critical.''
   She also said the eight-member management committee comprising
GM Chairman Roger Smith, President Robert Stempel and others meets
monthly, but that Nov. 30 is not a regularly scheduled meeting.
   Malloy declined to give a date for the next regularly scheduled
meeting.
   The Journal said the plan would not involve large-scale layoffs.
Most of the cutbacks would be accomplished through attrition.
   At the end of last year, GM had 103,410 salaried and 327,277
hourly workers in the United States, according to the company's
Public Interest Report. That total is down 17 percent from 126,078
salaried and 392,910 hourly U.S. employees at the end of 1986.
   The following year, GM began its ``Action Plan'' to cut costs
across the board. At the end of the third quarter of this year, the
company said it had made $11 billion in cuts since the program
began.

   The stock market edged upward today, bolstered
by an unexpectedly upbeat report on the state of business activity.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials rose 4.27 to 2,643.56 in
the first half hour of trading.
   Gainers outnumbered losers by about 5 to 4 in nationwide trading
of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 506 up, 392 down and

   Analysts said the news came as a positive surprise for traders
who have grown increasingly worried lately about the slowing pace
of the economy.
   But they questioned whether investors would bid enthusiastically
for stocks on the eve of a long weekend.
   The markets will be closed Thursday for Thanksgiving, and will
be open Friday for what traditionally is one of the Street's
slowest days of the year.
   Gainers among the blue chips included International Business

<TEXT>
   On the eve of the year's biggest travel
weekend, auto safety advocates are pushing everything from air bags
to keeping people from catching Z's at the wheel to prevent highway
deaths.
   Groups ranging from the heavily funded Insurance Institute for
Highway Safety to the volunteer-run Motor Voters issued statements
or held news conferences Tuesday designed to promote safety.
   More than 400 people die on the nation's highways each
Thanksgiving Day weekend _ there were 438 fatalities last year,
down from a high of 764 in 1968.
   At a Washington seminar on Sleep Loss and Driving Safety,
experts said sleep plays a key role in up to 400,000 traffic
accidents a year.
   More than 20 percent of all drivers have fallen asleep at the
wheel at least once, said William C. Dement, director of a sleep
disorders clinic at Stanford University.
   Dement said adults can build up a ``sleep debt'' that grows
larger if they avoid needed sleep over several days and that
Americans generally don't get enough sleep. A lack of needed sleep
can impair driving, he said.
   Charles Czeisler of Boston's Brigham and Women's Hospital said
family get-togethers often keep Thanksgiving weekend travelers from
getting enough sleep before they head for the road. He said some
sleep-deprived drivers will become aware they are operating ``on
automatic pilot, but they just won't be able to respond to warning
signals in time.''
   Meanwhile, a spokesman for the National Highway Transportation
Safety Administration responded to three auto safety and consumer
groups who accused the agency of failing to promote and enforce
auto air bag rules.
   Public Citizen, the Center for Auto Safety and Motor Voters
criticized both the government and the auto industry at a news
conference to promote air bags, which are expected to be in
one-third of the 10 million 1990 cars to be sold in the United
States.
   The agency has required air bags or automatic front seat belts
in all 1990 cars.
   NHTSA spokesman Barry McCahill said the agency has made the
promotion of all types of occupant protection its ``number one
priority.''
   A Virginia woman, appearing at the news conference with the
safety coalition, said she survived a 110 mph head-on collision
because an air bag popped out of her steering wheel.
   ``It's truly good to be here, literally,'' said Denise Rusk of
Kilmarnock, Va., who said she could not remember what happened
after a Ford station wagon crossed into her lane on Sept. 22, 1988,
and smashed head-on into her car. Both cars were going 55 mph,
putting the force of the impact at 110 mph.
   Showing no sign of her injuries, Mrs. Rusk said she had 36
broken bones, but the air bag prevented her from slamming into the
steering wheel and ashboard of her new Chrysler LeBaron
convertible. The driver of the other car, which did not have an air
bag, was killed.
   It's probably too late for anyone to change the family car for
the weekend trip, but the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety on
Tuesday released its first ranking of cars according to the
likelihood of a rider dying in one of them.
   The analysis, based on traffic accidents involving 1985-87
models over three years ending in 1988, covers the 103 most popular
cars sold in America.
   Chevrolet Corvette showed the highest death rate per 10,000
vehicles registered.
   Volvo's 740@760 had the lowest death rate.
   The results show large cars generally were safer and small cars
more dangerous, but there were exceptions and results varied widely
among car sizes and among different models of the same car.
   The institute used a complex formula to predict what death rate
might be expected according to size, typical driver age and driver
sex.
   Based on this, nine cars performed far better than predicted:
Nissan Sentra two-door, Volvo 740@760 four-door, Volkswagen Jetta
four-door, Ford Taurus station wagon, Honda Prelude, Chevrolet
Cavalier station wagon, Ford Escort station wagon, Toyota Celica
and Toyota Cressida four-door.
   Seven cars performed far worse than predicted: Chevrolet
Chevette four-door, Plymouth Reliant four-door, Chevrolet Celebrity
two-door, Dodge Aries four-door, Chevrolet Corvette, Chrysler
LeBaron four-door, and Chevrolet Sprint two-door.

   Ashland Oil Inc. will pay the state a record
$4.6 million in civil penalties and other costs for damage caused
by the company's massive January 1988 diesel fuel spill near
Pittsburgh, Gov. Robert P. Casey said today.
   The money will finance a number of state environmental
initiatives, including scholarships, training and study of natural
and recreational resources.
   ``This is also the largest single environmental payment the
company has agreed to pay in Pennsylvania, and it's unique because
through this agreement, the Ashland penalties will be put to sound
environmental use,'' Casey said in a prepared statement released
today.
   More than 700,000 gallons of diesel fuel flowed into the
Monongahela and Ohio rivers when a storage tank ruptured at the
company's facility in Jefferson, south of Pittsburgh.
   The spill killed thousands of fish and birds and forced public
water systems in Pennsylvania, Ohio and West Virginia to stop
drawing from the rivers.

<HEAD>EC Commission Proposes Measures to Upgrade Train Services</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   In a bid to upgrade rail services after
1992, the European Community Commission Wednesday proposed to open
the EC railway sector to private enterprise.
   It said the railways should remain state monopolies but that
private firms must be able to use them to ship goods in competition
with the rail companies.
   Currently, only the EC railway companies can handle goods
shipped by rail.
   ``Roads, waterways and airspace are considered public and
accessible to all, but this principle of free access has not been
applied to the railways,'' EC Transport Commissioner Karel Van
Miert said in a statement.
   He said the rail companies must remain responsible for
maintaining and upgrading the rail networks.
   But their service activities must become separate branches to
compete with private enterprise, he added.
   Over the last decade intra-EC traffic by road, air and rail
increased by 400 percent, according to EC figures.
   Although EC road and airways are increasingly congested, Van
Miert said transport by rail remains underused despite its
potential for growth.
   To reverse that, he said the EC states must improve rail
infrastructure between member states and to ensure a smoother
transit of goods from one EC state to another.
   ``The open market of 1992 opens promising perspective for
railroads in the trade bloc,'' Van Miert said.
   On Tuesday, transport ministers of six EC states which are
considering a high-speed passenger train network, asked for EC
funds.
   Van Miert said such networks ``were subject to special
attention'' but did not indicate if any EC funds would be earmarked
for that purpose.

   President Bush vetoed legislation creating a
special congressional panel to investigate the 8-month-old strike
against Eastern Airlines, saying Congress was improperly trying to
interfere in contract and court disputes.
   ``This would hinder saving Eastern Airlines and the jobs of its
employees,'' Bush said in a statement accompanying his veto. The
White House announced the action less than 30 minutes before the
midnight Tuesday deadline for the president to act or allow the
measure to become law without his signature.
   Bush, in a decision that angered organized labor and
particularly Eastern's unions, said it was unrealistic to believe
the commission could find a solution to the bitter strike within
the 45 days called for in the measure.
   He also said that any intervention by Congress would interfere
with Eastern's attempts to reorganize in bankruptcy court.
   ``The bankruptcy court is charged with protecting the overall
interests of the concerned parties in an evenhanded fashion,'' Bush
said in his veto message. ``This state of affairs should not be
disturbed by new legislation.''
   Congress did not attempt a veto override as both houses rushed
through other business and adjourned for the year early today. But
Sen. Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass., said he would try to bring the
measure up again when Congress returns in January.
   Organized labor lobbied heavily for the measure and several
union leaders said a Bush veto would sour labor's already strained
relations with the White House.
   ``By failing to sign the Eastern bill the president embraced the
meanest worker-hating boss in the nation _ Frank Lorenzo,'' George
Kourpias, president of the striking Machinists union, said today.
Lorenzo is chairman of Texas Air Corp., Eastern's parent company.
   ``It is utterly disgraceful that the administration goes out of
its way to support and identify with workers in Poland, China and
Eastern Europe, yet it isn't even willing to hear what a
congressional fact-finding commission might have to say about the
8-month-old strike at Eastern,'' said Skip Copeland, head of the
striking Eastern pilots.
   Henry Duffy, president of the Air Line Pilots Association,
called Bush's veto ``a deliberate slap at American workers.''
   Eastern released a letter sent today to Bush from Lorenzo,
thanking the president for political courage and ``a clear vision
of the need to keep the airline industry competitive.''
   It was the second time Bush has acted to keep the government out
of the strike.
   He refused in March to use his power to block the strike by
naming an emergency mediation board, saying he believed the dispute
should be settled by the company and its unions.
   The measure would have created a commission consisting of two
senators and two representatives _ one Republican and one Democrat
from each chamber _ charged with studying the strike and proposing
a contract solution.
   The measure also would have required the commission to suggest
ways to maintain competitiveness in the airline industry and to
protect employees of airlines that file for bankruptcy protections.
   The measure called on the commission to issue a report within 45
days. Its findings would not have been binding on Bush but could
have led to additional legislation.
   The Eastern strike began March 4 when workers represented by the
Machinists union walked off the job at the end of a federally
mandated cooling off period. The airline's union pilots and flight
attendants have for the most part honored Machinists' pickets.
   Miami-based Eastern filed for court protection from creditors
under Chapter 11 of the bankruptcy laws days after the strike began
and has told the U.S. Bankruptcy court in New York it plans to
emerge as a smaller carrier. Eastern has continued to operate
throughout the strike, adding flights as it hires replacement
pilots, mechanics and flight attendants.
   After Bush refused to intervene, labor lobbied Congress to pass
a measure demanding that the president name an emergency mediation
board. But the Democratic sponsors could not muster enough support
for that proposal, settling instead for the measure creating a
congressional investigation.
   The strike came after the Machinists union refused to accept
concessions demanded by Eastern. The unions, who have tried
unsuccessfully to arrange the sale of the airline, contend Texas
Air has siphoned Eastern cash and assets and wants to use
bankruptcy to bust the unions.
   Texas Air has said concessions by Eastern's union workers were
necessary for the airline to remain competitive.

<HEAD>Circle K to Address Increasing Debt</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PHOENIX (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Circle K Corp. has announced a restructuring
plan, which includes selling unprofitable stores and possibly parts
of the company, to try to get rid of its mounting debt.
   The restructuring plan was presented Tuesday during the
Phoenix-based company's annual shareholders meeting here.
   The plan calls for bringing in investment advisers to develop a
financial-restructuring plan and naming William A. Franke, board
member and financial consultant, to oversee the plan.
   It also calls for the convenience store chain to open no new
stores for several years, to reduce capital spending and store
inventories. It also calls for the hiring of senior operating and
merchandising executives who are trained to make the company more
competitive.
   There are 4,685 Circle K stores throughout the United States,
although the company now owns only about 12 percent of them.
   The company said the restructuring was not an indication that it
was preparing to seek protection from creditors under federal
bankruptcy laws.
   ``The restructuring just means we're taking a look at our asset
base,'' company chairman Karl Eller said.
   He said Circle K's senior management must develop a more
cohesive plan to make the company more competitive.
   The company faces continued competition from other
convenience-store chains and also from supermarkets, which often
are staying open 24 hours, Eller added.
   ``It's going to be tough,'' he said. ``While we expect positive
cash flow, it will take several quarters to do it.''
   But the company's restructuring plan was met with skepticism by
some shareholders who fear management may not be able to turn the
company around.
   ``I don't think anybody in this room is happy with the financial
situation,'' said Don Jackel, a Phoenix graphics consultant who
owns 600 of the company's 43.6 million common shares. ``I heard the
words, but I didn't sense any direction whatsoever. I just saw some
people going through the motions, that's all.''
   After aggressive expansion left the company with a heavy debt
load, Circle K reported an operating loss of $5.5 million for
fiscal 1989. It has $1.1 billion in long-term debt.
   Circle K management put the company up for sale last summer, but
in September decided to stop looking for a buyer.

<HEAD>New England Fishing Industry in Turmoil as Fleet Grows and Stocks
Dwindle</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ALAN COOPERMAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Economists sometimes call it the ``cows on the
common'' problem.
   When each town in New England had a common field where cows were
free to graze, more and more farmers would bring their animals,
until, finally, not enough grass was left for anyone.
   Today's commercial fishermen ply New England waters in
million-dollar boats with fish-finding sonar devices. But they are
in essentially the same position as 18th century farmers squabbling
over fodder.
   With demand for fish rising and no restriction on the number of
U.S. fishing boats, the New England fleet has grown so fast that it
is quickly depleting the stocks of haddock, cod and other staple
species, fishermen and scientists say.
   ``I'm a skipper and a boat owner, I've got a mortgage and a
family to support, and it's getting real scary,'' said John Raymond
of South Berwick, Maine, as he stood on a Boston pier earlier this
year with a spike in his hand, unloading 22,000 pounds of fish
after eight days at sea.
   Raymond, 38, said he and his three crewmen on the 86-foot
trawler Olympia are staying at sea longer and fishing more
aggressively _ often hauling nets through the night _ but their
catch is declining.
   ``Seven or eight years ago, I would get 60, 70, maybe 80,000
pounds every trip,'' he said. ``Now, I'm lucky to get 20,000.''
   He is not alone. All along the coast from Portland, Maine, to
Providence, R.I., fishermen are finding fewer haddock, cod,
flounder and redfish, the bottom-feeding groundfish that provide
the flaky, white, mild-flavored fillets that Americans consumers
prefer.
   ``The stocks of these species are at all-time lows, and it's
touch-and-go whether they'll ever fully come back,'' said Stephen
H. Clark, a biologist with the National Marine Fisheries Service in
Woods Hole.
   ``Unless something is done to reduce the (fish) mortality rate,
the probability is that yields will continue to decline, and the
risk that these stocks will never recover is going to increase.''
   The declining number of fish is causing turmoil throughout the
New England fishing industry, which has deep historical roots in
many communities, generated $493 million in wholesale revenues last
year and employs more than 15,000 full-time fishermen and 10,000
processors and wholesalers.
   Among the signs of frustration and dissension, according to
fisherman and regulators:
   _Incursions by American trawlers into richer Canadian waters,
leading to chases by Canadian patrol boats and, in one recent case,
to warning shots being fired over the bow of an American vessel.
   _A flourishing black market in undersized scallops, illegal
fishing in spawning areas and allegations that some trawlers carry
nets with illegally tight mesh.
   _Bitter rivalries between groups of fishermen using different
types of gear and operating out of competing ports.
   _Rising prices for consumers and concern among both fishermen
and wholesale buyers over the fairness of fish auctions in major
ports, particularly Boston.
   Ironically, Clark and many other experts date the problem to the
extension of the U.S. territorial limit from 12 to 200 miles in
1977-78.
   While the 200-mile limit reduced competition from foreign
vessels, it also prompted a rapid buildup of the U.S. fleet, not
only in the number of vessels, but also in their size and
sophistication, said Buell Hollister, an information officer for
the Massachusetts Division of Marine Fisheries.
   ``When the 200-mile limit was created, it was a highly
publicized event and it really got a lot of people interested in
the industry,'' Hollister said. ``Investment capital came pouring
into the American fleet, and it coincided with a tremendous
revolution in electronic technology, which really refined the
fish-catching effectiveness of the trawlers.''
   Among the new devices are sensitive sonar systems with color
displays that can identify the location, direction and species of
schools of fish deep below the surface.
   Also, satellite navigation systems now allow trawler captains to
pinpoint their position with such accuracy that they can leave nets
in the water, then return and find them later.
   The over-fishing problem has been compounded by a 1984 World
Court decision that gave Canada control over thousands of square
miles of disputed territory in the fertile Georges Bank and Gulf of
Maine fishing grounds. That has forced the New England fleet into a
smaller area, making competition even more intense.
   Smaller, less sophisticated fishing operations are quickly being
edged out as the bigger ones grow. New England's offshore fleet now
includes about 1,400 vessels weighing 5 tons or more, more than
double the number in the 1970s.
   ``Without question, the New England groundfish industry is
totally overcapitalized,'' said David S. Crestin, deputy director
of the federal Office of Fishery Conservation and Management in
Washington.
   The species that has been most devastated is haddock. Landings
of haddock from New England waters are less than a tenth of the
level that prevailed from 1935 to 1960, despite more intensive
fishing.
   Even more significant than the size of the catch, however, is
the ``spawning biomass'' _ the total weight of all the fish mature
enough to reproduce _ because that determines the viability of the
species.
   Until the 1960s, the spawning biomass of haddock in New England
waters was about 120,000 metric tons. Now, it's less than 20,000,
the National Fisheries Service says.
   The decline has been nearly as dramatic for cod, whose spawning
stocks on Georges Bank have fallen by two-thirds in less than a
decade.
   An attempt in the late 1970s to limit the fish harvest by
imposing quotas on fishermen led to widespread cheating and has
been abandoned by the New England Fishery Management Council, the
board that regulates the industry.
   In recent years, the council has repeatedly discussed the
possibility of limiting the size of the fleet, as Canada does. But
the discussions have foundered every time on ``don't gore my ox''
objections, said the council's chairman, James L. Warren of Brewer,
Maine.
   ``You can get general agreement that there ought to be some sort
of control on the amount of (fishing) effort,'' Warren said. ``But
when you get down to the specific details is where you run into
problems, because Joe Blow says, `Well, what if my son decides to
follow me in the business?' or `What if I want to buy another
boat?'''
   Other proposals that have been discussed include shutting down
the groundfish fleet for a year to allow the fish population to
regenerate, or aggressively marketing species that are still
plentiful, such as herring and mackerel.
   Some fishermen said they believe a shake-out is inevitable.
   ``A lot of guys are going to go broke,'' predicted Jimmy
Bramante of Boston as he prepared to take his 88-foot Captain Sam
II out to Georges Bank. ``The way it's going, how much more can the
fish stocks take?''

   Grain and soybean futures prices were narrowly
mixed in early trading today on the Chicago Board of Trade with
wheat slightly lower and corn and soybeans posting modest gains.
   Trading conditions were thin as many players got an early start
on the Thanksgiving Day holiday, and analysts predicted little
price movement on the day.
   The early decline in wheat prices extended Tuesday's losses and
reflected forecasts for needed rain in U.S. winter-wheat growing
areas during the coming week.
   The corn and soybean markets gained in line with stronger cash
markets and prospects for new sales of corn to South Korea and
Mexico. Corn and soybean futures rose slightly in Tuesday's session.
   In early trading, wheat futures were { cent to 1} cents lower
with December at $4.08} a bushel; corn was { cent lower to { cent
higher with December at $2.38{ a bushel; oats were { cent to 1 cent
higher with December at $1.46 a bushel; soybeans were 2 cents to 2{
cents higher with January at $5.88 a bushel.
   Cattle futures were higher while pork futures were mixed in
early trading on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.
   Live cattle were .15 cent to .30 cent higher with December at
75.87 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .02 cent to .33 cent higher
with November at 83.30 cents a pound; live hogs were .15 cent lower
to .13 cent higher with December at 50.05 cents a pound; frozen
pork bellies were .30 cent lower to .53 cent higher with February
at 63.10 cents a pound.
   Livestock and meat futures rose on Tuesday.

   New England's fishermen are a maverick
breed, happily isolated on the sea. But on shore their independence
has translated into an erratically regulated industry whose unions
have lost power.
   From the family-owned vessel 300 miles out on the ocean to the
rubber-booted processors who make their way at dawn to this city's
fishhouses, the rules of the game are fairly loose.
   Fishing is near the top of ``Most Dangerous Professions'' lists
and the walls of The Seaman's Bethel here are lined with the names
of men lost at sea.
   Federal inspectors keep tabs on product standards and the Coast
Guard observes sanitary conditions on boats, but industry
statistics such as how many fishermen are injured on the job
annually are hard to come by.
   Cramped boats bearing seven to 10 fishermen head out for two
weeks at a time, often under stormy, frigid conditions. Back on
land, the predominantly female fish processors stand in one spot
sometimes eight hours or more at a stretch, scaling, cleaning and
packing fillets.
   ``The most frequent (accident) is the loss of fingers. A finger
goes zing and that's it,'' said Paul Swaim, a port agent and
recordkeeper for the National Oceanic and Atmospheric
Administration in New Bedford.
   ``Accidents happen,'' he said. ``Slippery floors, knives and the
machinery are pretty dangerous things.''
   Perhaps as wearing as the fishing industry's inherent hazards is
the incalculable, wet and numbing monotony that is so much a part
of the business.
   Despite the conditions, New England's fishing unions have been
on the wane in the 1980s, broken in part by unsuccessful strikes in
the early part of the decade, said Harvey Mickelson, an attorney
for the New Bedford's Seafood Dealer's Association.
   Fish cutters and processors weakened themselves when they went
on strike in 1981, according to many in the fishing community.
   Joe Testaverde, a Gloucester-based fisherman, said unions have
never had much muscle in his North Shore port. He said at most six
of the port's 100-plus boats were unionized.
   ``Independence runs very strong in fishing,'' said Testaverde.
``From my father's days to his father before him, fishermen have
never been much for unions.''
   Ethnic traditions also have a lot to do with the resistance to
organized labor, Testaverde said. Italians, a substantial
population in Gloucester, have traditionally opted for
kinship-based agreements rather than contracts with workers.
   In New Bedford, the unions established by once-dominant Yankee
fishermen have fallen away as the Portuguese population, whose
focus is on family rather than worker solidarity, has grown and
taken over much of the industry.
   Family ties extend to onshore processing as well. Fishhouses
employ hundreds of women, many of them the daughters, sisters or
cousins of veteran fish cutters and packers.
   The women make about $6.70 an hour and although they'd like more
than the six or so holidays they get a year, the work is generally
steady, they said.
   Henri Francois, who directs the 40-boat Seafarer's Union, said
seafarers and industry workers are becoming more union-oriented
``because the fishermen are starting to think of retirement and
health care.''
   But Jim Costakes, who represents the port's boat owners,
disagreed. He said less one-third of the fleet was unionized and he
doesn't expect the figure to change.
   ``You've got a new generation in the industry who are more
interested in what they can get now,'' he said. ``Their concern
isn't for the pension in the future.''
   That's right, said Jim Jardin, a champion scallop shucker and
regular crew member based in New Bedford. He said fishermen are
interested in immediate benefits, of which he finds fewer these
days.
   Boat owners generally take 45 percent of the catch while the
crew splits the remaining 55 percent, Jardin said. Under union
influence three or four years ago, crews took an average 63
percent, he said.
   ``Sometimes (boat owners) can't make it on the catch alone, so
they have to make it up somewhere,'' the 25-year-old said. ``The
crews usually swallow it these days.''

   Vasco da Gama and Ferdinand Magellan may
seem unlikely rivals for Donald Duck and Mickey Mouse. But under an
ambitious plan by a group of U.S. businessmen, the 15th-century
Portuguese explorers could vie with Walt Disney stars as major
European theme park attractions.
   A U.S.-owned company, backed by the Portuguese government, is
planning an $80 million to $100 million theme park near Lisbon,
based on the pioneering Portuguese sea voyages to Africa, Asia and
the New World some 500 years ago.
   The Lusolandia park is set for a 1993 opening, one year after
the scheduled launch of a Euro Disneyland park in France.
   Lusolandia Holdings' chairman Edward Kane, a Boston native, said
the project sprang from Disney's rejection five years ago of an
idea from then Portuguese Prime Minister Mario Soares to locate a
European Disneyland in Portugal.
   As Lisbon representative of the Washington-based International
Trade and Guarantee Corp., a company advising U.S. businesses
abroad, Kane had been asked by Soares _ currently Portuguese
president _ to approach Disney.
   ``Walt Disney Enterprises basically said no way, Portugal is too
small potatoes for them,'' said Kane.
   Disney decided to locate closer to Europe's more affluent and
densely populated ``golden triangle'' formed by London, Paris and
Brussels. Their French amusement park program foresees costs of up
to $2.8 billion to 1997.
   After Disney's refusal, Kane turned to Management Resources, an
Anaheim, Calif., company specialized in creating and running theme
parks and formed by ex-Disney employees.
   ``I had the idea of ... instead of Mickey Mouse and Donald Duck
... let's make it a Portuguese historical theme park, let's replace
Donald Duck with Bartolomeu Dias and Mickey Mouse with Vasco da
Gama,'' said Kane, a retired U.S. foreign service officer.
   Portuguese authorities backed the plan, and Mangagement
Resources enthusiastically joined the project. Feasibility studies
predicted 2.15 million first-year customers from Portugal's 10
million inhabitants and foreign visitors to Portugal who last year
topped 16 million.
   The park is to be built near the town of Azambuja, some 28 miles
northeast of Lisbon along the main north-south freeway to Oporto,
Portugal's second city.
   Kane said the park will also have good road links to Portugal's
main tourist destination _ the southern Algarve region _ and to
neighboring Spain. The site proposed for a new Lisbon international
airport is 7 miles to the east of the park location.
   Visitors will enter the 247-acre park into a mock-up of
Renaissance Lisbon, complete with castle and 15th century main
street.
   From a reconstructed quayside, replicas of the explorers'
caravels will carry would-be Magellans on a voyage of discovery
across an artificial lake to ``theme areas'' representing Brazilian
jungles, mysterious African kingdoms and the glittering
civilizations of India, China and Japan.
   Kane said the latest technology will be used to create a
fun-as-you-learn environment for adults and children. The park
publicity brochure promises ocean storms and Amazonian canoe trips
as well as cultural exhibitions highlighting lands along the
Portuguese sea routes.
   Portuguese historians will advise on the park's authenticity and
experts from other countries will be contacted to set up Japanese
tea houses and African dance displays.
   Lusolandia Holdings is registered in Bermuda and owned 50-50 by
Management Resources and International Trade and Guarantee Corp.
   Soon, Kane said, they will be joined by a Portuguese partner and
create a Portuguese company _ Lusolandia Empreedimentos Turisticas.
   Private financing for the project is being sought mainly in
Europe. Kane also hopes to gain Portuguese government funding and
is discussing loan prospects with the Luxembourg-based European
Investment Bank.
   The Portuguese government has created a special task force of
officials from four ministries to steer the project through
Lisbon's bureaucratic maze.
   Inspired by the ideas of Prince Henry the Navigator, Portuguese
14th and 15th century mariners undertook a series of voyages that
expanded Europe's perception of the world and opened contacts with
the people of other continents.
   Dias became the first man to sail beyond the shores of North
Africa down the West African coast to the Cape of Good Hope in
1488, da Gama discovered the sea route to India in 1499 and Pedro
Alvares Cabral first landed in Brazil in 1500. Sailing under
Spanish colors, Magellan began the first circumnavigation of the
globe in 1519.

<HEAD>Fashion Industry Begins Covering Large Women</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KAREN SCHWARTZ</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WARWICK, R.I. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Whether it's the holiday glitter of
rhinestones on satin or the elegance of pearls on black velvet,
larger women can dress for the season as never before in fashions
from an industry that realized 35 million women were tired of being
ignored.
   ``All the names that never wanted to be associated at one time
with large sizes are now saying there is a viable market out
there,'' said Sandi Alpert, a fashion coordinator for large sizes
at Bloomingdale's main store in New York City.
   In the early 1980s, fashion designers began realizing the third
of American women with figures more like Mrs. Claus than Snow White
were an untapped market. Today sales of sizes 14 and larger are
more than $10 billion annually as more designers join the movement
and women feel better about adorning their less-than-perfect frames.
   ``The trend is for women to be happy at whatever size they are
at the moment, not to worry about dieting and to put their life on
hold until they lose weight,'' said Lisa E. Weingeroff, president
of Sizzle Marketing and Promotions Inc. in Warwick.
   Sizzle began manufacturing affordable costume jewelry for large
women earlier this year. It designs chokers long enough not to
choke, earrings with deep enough clips and long enough posts not to
pinch, and rings and bracelets larger than standard sizes.
   ``Almost every plus-size woman couldn't go into a store and find
a necklace that would hang properly, that would lay on the chest
properly,'' said Weingeroff. In addition, ``Designs are larger in
general so they stand out better.''
   The holiday fashion pages of December's Weight Watchers Magazine
show a gold Sizzle necklace and earrings highlighting a strapless,
sequined top by Mondi.
   But not so long ago large women could hardly find clothes, let
alone sequins, baubles and accessories.
   ``This woman has been the victim of a stereotype _ `She's big,
she's not interested in fashion, she just wants to hide her body,
she doesn't go out,''' said Christina Gruber, editor of Plus Sizes,
a trade publication for retailers and manufacturers.
   ``I have an expression called `polyester pull-on' and that's
what most of us in our 50s remember'' as being available to large
women, Alpert said. ``If you wanted really high fashion you had to
go to a tailor or couturier.''
   In 1979, Pierre Cardin and Gloria Vanderbilt ventured into
larger clothing offering designer jeans in bigger sizes. In 1983,
Givenchy offered a large-size line and others steadily followed.
   ``The first person who had the nerve to put out the designer
jeans took a lot of guts,'' said Carole Shaw, editor of the
magazine, BBW: Big Beautiful Women. ``Then when they blew out the
doors, (the fashion industry) said to themselves, `Do you think it
could be possible that fat ladies really want pretty clothes?'''
   But Diane Specht, Plus Sizes publisher, said it's really only
been in the past two years that the fashion industry firmly moved
into the large-size market.
   It wasn't a Christmas wish that changed the industry; rather, a
matter of economics.
   ``Consumer demand,'' said Helen Laskow, of Givenchy En Plus and
president of the Plus Designer Council, a consortium of about a
dozen manufacturers formed in April.
   As women entered the workforce, they needed something
presentable to wear to work.
   ``Now you've got women in their 20s and 30s who are doctors and
lawyers _ professionals _ and who need to dress. It isn't they need
clothes, they need fashion. They're out there in the world, in the
public eye,'' said Bloomingdale's Alpert.
   ``The market had to dress this woman because she was going crazy
and they began to hear about it,'' she said.
   The trend shows no signs of waning. The average American woman
is growing older and her waistline is growing, too. The majority of
large-size shoppers are in the 35 to 55 age range, said Specht. She
said they account for about 15 percent of the entire women's
fashion industry _ spending upwards of $10 billion annually.
   Indeed, BBW published bi-monthly when it first appeared because
``when we started out in 1979 there wasn't enough fashion to put in
every month,'' said Shaw. In January, the magazine began publishing
monthly for its 200,000 subscribers.
   Weight Watchers Magazine also revamped its 20-year-old format a
year ago to include more fashion and beauty advice for its million
readers, said Kay Parmenter, vice president of advertising.
   After all, ``Large-size women want what every other woman wants.
They want to look pretty, feminine and fashionable,'' said Laskow.
   And that's just what they can do this holiday season.

<HEAD>The Suite Life of Jim Pickett, Hotel Entrepreneur</HEAD>

   Not afraid to risk a few million on a hunch,
Jim Pickett asserts he did for the hotel industry in 5{ years what
took Bill Marriott 13 to accomplish.
   He opened 12 hotels in that time. And he says there are many
more to come.
   His Pickett Hotel Co. develops and manages hotels offering only
suites. It was selected as the No. 1 all-suites hotel company last
year by Business Travel News magazine. Marriott Suites finished
second and Park Suites third.
   The magazine rated 10 all-suites hotels in 11 categories, such
as quality of food, ease in arranging individual and group travel,
and facilities for resort travel. It gave Pickett the highest marks
in price value, helpfulness of the staff, appearance, and quality
and variety of amenities.
   Pickett, a native of Dayton, rolled all his pet peeves from many
years as a business traveler into a checklist with a notion he
could do better.
   ``Like hangers hooked onto the rod. If you have two drinks you
can't put it back on the pole; air conditioners that are so loud
you can't talk. ... What I hated the most was telephones next to
the bed. I said put it on the desk. I tried 100 shower heads and
the one in my house is the one in the hotel,'' he said in an
interview.
   And guests can watch television in the bathroom.
   ``People who are very busy like being able to shave or spend
time in the bathroom and watch the news. They don't always have
time to read the newspaper,'' Pickett said. There is also a TV in
the bedroom.
   Pickett's strategy is to offer a suite for the price of a hotel
room in the same market. The challenge is breaking old habits.
   ``You don't think `maybe there's an all-suite hotel where I'm
going,' but once we get them _ our guest cards are running about 96
percent (favorable) _ they're coming back.''
   Hotel analysts say suite hotels enjoy growing popularity among
business and leisure travelers.
   ``The suite has been one of the hottest segments of the hotel
business, and a segment getting increasingly competitive,'' said
John Rohs, an analyst with Wertheim Schroder &amp; Co. Inc. in New York.
   He said larger, well-known chains are playing a major role in
the development of suite hotels.
   ``Marriot and Hyatt are getting into the business. They're
well-managed companies with a lot of marketing muscle. Name
recognition and marketing clout are everything,'' he said.
   Napoleon H. Overton, an analyst with Morgan Keegan Co. in
Memphis, said Holiday Corp.'s Embassy Suites opened the market for
suite hotels and now has about 60 percent of the market.
   ``I think the all-suite segment of the lodging industry is the
most promising over the next five to seven years. Embassy Suites
dominates right now,'' he said. ``Pickett is not a household name.
As their system grows, that problem will lessen and benefit the
company.''
   Only 3 percent of all hotel rooms are suites, analysts said.
Rohs said that figure probably would level off at about 10 percent.
   Pickett got his start in the Columbus area as a developer of
suburban office parks. He began the hotel company with a $5 million
investment in 1983 in one of his own office parks in Dublin, a
Columbus suburb.
   He has since opened 12 Pickett Suite resorts, hotels and inns in
cities east of the Mississippi River.
   He hopes to add 30 more by 1992, mainly by acquiring old hotels.
``Not many places need a new hotel, but a lot of them need better
ones,'' he said.
   At Pickett, the overnight traveler won't find grand ballrooms or
enormous conference rooms.
   ``We focus on the single transient, multiple transient and small
groups, two to 40 people,'' Pickett said.
   The privately owned company had revenue of $50 million last
year, compared with $354,000 after its first year in operation.
   Pickett, 47, attributes his success to adapting quickly to the
needs of ``baby boomers of traveling age.''
   One boon to the industry has been the female traveler, whose
rising prominence has not escaped Pickett's attention.
   Literature from the hotel boasts that rooms include a stocked
refrigerator, built-in hair dryer, bathrobe and morning newspaper
delivery.
   ``Security seems to be most important for women. We have a
stocked refrigerator. You don't have to run down the hallway in
your bathrobe to get a pop,'' he said.
   Pickett has hotels in downtown Columbus; Atlanta; Tampa, Fla.,
and the Raleigh-Durham Research Triangle in North Carolina; resorts
in Walt Disney World Village and Vero Beach, Fla.; and inns in
Indianapolis; Dayton, Ohio; Cincinnati; Nashville, Tenn.; Detroit;
and Orlando, Fla.

   The lite brigade is swelling. Thanksgiving
gluttony aside, American food companies are jumping on the trend of
giving shoppers the same great taste, but no fat, or cholesterol,
or sugar, or salt ....
   ``Next to foods that can be microwaved, light foods continue to
be the fastest-growing segment in the store,'' said Judy Ball,
manager of customer relations for Kroger Co., the nation's largest
supermarket chain.
   ``If two comparable products are on the shelf next to each
other, the one that says `Light' will probably sell better,'' she
said in a telephone interview from her Cincinnati office.
   One of the newest entries is the venerable Hostess Cupcake, with
the seven-loop squiggle signature on top and sugary white cream in
the middle.
   The new version, called Hostess Lights, is 97 percent fat-free,
contains no cholesterol and has fewer calories than its regular
Hostess counterpart.
   ``This allows people who are watching their diet to have a sweet
snack every once in a while without feeling guilty,'' said Pamela
Marsh, a snack nutritionist at Hostess.
   ``This allows them to have their cake and eat it too.''
   Hostess cupcakes were invented 70 years ago and helped build
Hostess' parent company, St. Louis-based Continental Baking Co.,
into the nation's largest wholesale bakery.
   Hostess Lights, the cupcake for the 1990s, will be available
around the nation in a few months. They've been on sale since
October in New York, Philadelphia, Boston and Washington, and have
fared fairly well, Marsh said.
   Rolling out more and more products that tout healthful qualities
has probably increased overall sales in the food industry, but only
slightly, said Roger Spencer, a stock analyst with Dean Witter
Reynolds in Chicago.
   ``Any growth in a slow-growth industry is always welcome, but
it's certainly not anything that would bowl you over,'' Spencer
said.
   He said that overall the healthy products seem to be drawing
consumers away from their less healthy counterparts, rather than
increasing consumption of products.
   ``The skinny guys will keep buying what they've always bought
and the fat guys will use this new stuff,'' Spencer said. ``And
we'll all live to be about the same age.''
   The only problem with the food industry's urge to be healthy is
that no one has agreed on what is healthy.
   ``It's kind of confusing for consumers,'' Ball said. ``When they
pick up something that says `Light' it may not be at all what they
expect.''
   The Food and Drug Adminstration, which oversees the majority of
food products sold in the supermarket, has no definitions for
low-calorie, low-fat, or low-cholesterol foods.
   ``There are no clear-cut definitions, but we have proposed
definitions that we're in the process of putting into effect,''
said Chris Lecos, a spokesman for the FDA.
   Meanwhile, other regulatory agencies like the U.S. Department of
Agriculture and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms also
are involved with their own set of guidelines for ``Lite'' beef and
``Lite'' whiskey.
   The lack of definitions is part of a broader controversy being
debated in Washington about the use of improper health claims on
products and concerns that food labels are becoming meaningless.
   ``What I always say is that the grocery aisles are becoming the
mine fields of misleading information for consumers,'' said Bruce
Silverglade, legal director of the Center for Science in the Public
Interest.
   Silverglade said the explosion of health boasts and bravado may
mean a boost in profits now, but food companies will pay for that
by alienating consumers in the long run.
   ``If unabated, consumers will disregard everything on the
label,'' he said. ``We'll be in a position of throwing out the baby
with the bathwater because people simply won't know what to
believe.''
   Hostess Lights are a good example of products that may be
walking the line between what is slick marketing and what is a
genuinely healthful alternative.
   The cupcakes come in three flavors: plain, filled with vanilla
pudding, and with a raspberry filling. They're made with a new
angel food cake recipe that doesn't use egg yolks or animal fat.
   According to the FDA's proposed guideline for ``Light'' or ``Low
Fat'' products, the reduced-calorie product should have at least
one-third fewer calories than the regular version.
   Two of the three Hostess Light cupcakes miss that mark and the
other Light cupcake, the one with plain cake, passes only because
it's a half-ounce lighter than cupcakes made with the original
recipe.
   ``Our use of the word `Light' does not fall into the
reduced-calorie category. Some people may use the term to relate to
calories, but we're not positioning this as a diet food,'' said
Marsh, a Hostess spokeswoman.
   She said the brand name Light was selected because the cupcakes
are 97 percent fat-free and they contain no cholesterol.

   Thousands of Boeing workers returned to the
assembly line today after a 48-day strike, picking up a $500 bonus
check won in their new contract and relieved to be earning money as
the holiday season begins.
   ``It feels like the first day of school,'' said Jerry Clark, a
42-year-old father of two, as he showed up at Boeing's plant in
Renton, where he builds plane models for the world's No. 1
manufacturer of passenger jets.
   ``It's nice to go back. If it were another time of year it would
be different,'' said Tracy Dorning, an electrical inspector at
Renton. ``We might have stayed out longer.''
   The second-longest strike in Boeing history had practically shut
down production. Supervisors and non-striking personnel delivered
24 planes, but many of the aircraft had been virtually completed
before the walkout.
   Boeing spokesman Jack Gamble said most of today would be spent
in meetings to organize the start-up.
   Gearing up is ``going to be slow,'' he said. ``It will not
happen overnight.'' Boeing had been turning out 29 planes a month
before the Machinists union, representing 57,800 employees in nine
states, went on strike.
   The Machinists on Monday voted 81.4 percent in favor of a
contract that provides wage increases of 10 percent over three
years, plus bonuses of 10 percent the first year, 5 percent the
second and 4 percent the third.
   Most workers were to receive a $500 advance on their bonus
today, with the rest coming in December.
   Many who on Tuesday picked up their fifth and last $100 weekly
strike check said they were relieved to see an end to the strike.
   ``I think it's fair, but for the amount of days we were out we
could have done better,'' said Carl Olson, who works at Boeing
Advanced Systems.
   ``I'm glad to get back to work, but I voted against the
contract,'' said Richard Duncalf. He said the union had failed to
get improvements in the wage offer that was rejected Oct. 3, the
day before the strike began.
   Tom Baker, president of Machinists District Lodge 751 in
Seattle, said it may take time for members to leave behind
bitterness.
   Boeing spokesman Harold Carr said the company instructed
managers to ``be sensitive to the people returning to work and to
do everything they can to make sure that they're welcomed back and
that there's harmony in the workplace.''
   Under the contract, a cost-of-living adjustment will account for
virtually all of inflation, and workers will receive a
60-cent-per-hour increase immediately.
   It also includes a reduction in mandatory overtime to two
consecutive weekends and 144 hours per quarter. In the old
contract, workers could be required to work 200 hours a quarter and
four weekends in a row.
   The union includes 43,300 workers in the Seattle area; 12,000 in
Wichita, Kan.; 1,700 in Portland, Ore., and smaller numbers at
scattered sites in California, Hawaii, Montana, Utah and other
states.
   Boeing had record profits in its most recent quarter and has a
backlog of more than 1,700 planes worth about $85 billion, with
deliveries for those jets stretching past the turn of the century.
   The last Boeing strike, in 1977, ended after 45 days. Its
longest walkout lasted 140 days in 1948.

   Many people hestitate and consider the issues
before crossing a union's picket line, but would a doctors'
walk-out stop a parent from rushing a sick child past strikers and
into a hospital emergency room?
   Labor organizers say more and more doctors are joining the ranks
of unions nationwide _ a trend that could change the rules by which
medical professionals currently play.
   Before doctors take the lives of others into their hands, they
take a Hippocratic oath binding them to act ``with purity and with
holiness.''
   But does that oath deprive doctors and surgeons of the right to
protect their own interests, financial and otherwise?
   Union proponents and medical ethicists say doctors do have the
right to protect their own interests _ up to a point.
   But much like air traffic controllers, those in the medical
profession are bound to wrestle with overarching issues of public
safety and welfare.
   Dr. Sanford A. Marcus, president of the Union of American
Physicians and Dentists, claims his Oakland, Calif.-based
consortium has 50,000 members and is growing.
   He said members, affiliated through a number of offshoots around
the country, are working together to advocate the rights of both
physicians and their patients. It is not a conventional labor
union, which does collective bargaining and calls strikes.
   ``The entire field of health care financing and distribution is
being stood on its ear in these times,'' Marcus said. ``The rules
... are going to change an awful lot.''
   Since the mid-1980s membership in health maintenance
organizations has been on the rise around the nation. The prepaid
medical plans generally employ specific doctors and hospitals that
provide reduced-rate care to HMO members.
   Supporters say group health plans benefit both parties by
bringing more patients to doctors and reduced costs to those who
need health care.
   But Dr. Arthur Caplan, a bioethicist at the University of
Minnesota, said the shift to group plans has put doctors under new
strains that might best be addressed through unionization.
   ``It's a reaction by doctors feeling increasingly
disenfranchised within the health care system and by cost
containment measures that are basically shifting the structure of
medicine away from a profession and more toward a business,'' he
said in a telephone call from Minneapolis.
   Edward Hanley, who directs the 1,000-member Doctors and Surgeons
Association of Massachusetts, said doctors have ended up in many
cases with the short end of the stick financially.
   ``The medical profession has had no power,'' Hanley said from
the 4-year-old association's Wellesley headquarters. ``They aren't
in the business of negotiating the economics. They're trained to
help people who are ill.''
   He said doctors need to unionize to negotiate more effectively
on HMO contracts.
   Dr. Barry Leibowitz, president of the 16-year-old New York-based
Doctors Counil, said doctors have also begun complaining that
health care decisions have been usurped as HMO managers lay down
guidelines.
   ``Anyone who's salaried and not protected (by a union) is
subject to the vagaries of the marketplace and management,'' he
said. ``The employers ... have very little understanding of what a
physician needs to function.''
   Aside from patients' concerns, union organizers conceded doctors
were not entirely above materialism and the possible perks
collective bargaining might provide.
   ``Doctors have always disdained money because we thought it
would tarnish our God-like image, but the fact is you've got to
talk about money,'' the UAPD's Marcus said. ``Somebody has got to
be there to help them get a good shake.''
   Ethically speaking, Caplan said he saw no problem with unions
and that, in some cases, they might be overdue.
   The bioethicist did, however, draw the line where strikes were
concerned. Failing to honor their patients' needs before their own
self-interests would constitute a serious breach, he said.
   Marcus said if push ever came to shove he was confident medical
union members would never let a patient's care suffer.
   ``We would never withhold care,'' he said. ``That's not to say
we wouldn't strike against the fiscal machine, the bureaucracy or
the industrial complex that has been built out of health care, but
the patient must be taken care of under all circumstances.''

<HEAD>BAT Posts 18 Percent Profit Gain, Restructuring on Course</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   BAT Industries PLC, the British conglomerate
fighting off a takeover bid by Hoylake Investments Ltd., said
Wednesday its third-quarter net profit jumped 18 percent from a
year ago.
   For the three months ended Sept. 30 BAT earned 251 million
pounds, or about $394 million, compared with 212 million pounds in
the same period a year ago. Earnings per share came to 16.27 pence,
the equivalent of about 26 cents, compared with 14.03 pence in the
comparable 1988 period.
   Sales advanced 20 percent to 5.05 billion pounds from 4.2
billion pounds.
   ``This excellent performance provides us with a position of
immense strength from which to build shareholder value, now and in
the future,'' said BAT Chairman Patrick Sheehy.
   A particularly strong showing by its financial services
businesses helped the results, the company said.
   BAT said its restructuring plan was on course for completion by
the middle of next year.
   Under the share-enhancing plan, which is designed to fend off
the Hoylake bid, BAT intends to focus on tobacco and financial
services.
   Hoylake, which has pursued BAT for months, recently announced it
was considering revising its offer to include cash in place of some
of the debt instruments in the original 13.3 billion-pound, $21
billion, offer, but would keep the value of the offer at 850 pence,
or about $13.35 a share.
   Hoylake's original bid technically lapsed while awaiting U.S.
regulatory approval.
   BAT has already announced plans to sell off its U.S. retailing
operations, including its Saks Fifth Avenue and Marshall Field's
stores, and other businesses, as part of the restructuring. The
sales are expected to raise 4 billion pounds, or about $6.3 billion.
   BAT also plans to buy back up to 10 percent of its stock.
   For the first nine months of the year, BAT's net profit rose 46
percent to 828 million pounds from 568 million pounds in the same
period a year ago. Earnings per share came to 47.25 pence compared
with 40.77 pence.
   BAT's pre-tax profits from January through September rose 17
percent to 1.23 billion pounds from 1.05 billion pounds.
   Sales climbed 20 percent to 14.82 billion from 12.33 billion
pounds.
   BAT now is free to continue buying back up to 153 million of its
shares. Late last month, the company bought 6 million BAT shares,
but was barred from further purchases until the release of the
third-quarter results.

   Seated in his workshop where he has
meticulously transformed elephant tusks into intricate ivory
artwork for four decades, Wong Cheong-lam knows the days of his
craft are numbered.
   ``I'm the only one left,'' he sighs, looking around the the
workshop where six carvers once worked.
   The artwork crafted by the 55-year-old Wong and the 1,200 or so
other ivory carvers in Hong Kong has long been popular.
   Wholesalers from the United States, Europe and Japan have
eagerly snapped up tons of ivory worked in Hong Kong. Shop windows
in tourist districts display works ranging from panormaic
landscapes carved from an entire tusk to delicate earrings.
   But now the centuries-old craft may be doomed.
   In October, the Convention on International Trade in Endangered
Species (CITES) adopted a ban on world ivory trading to save
Africa's dwindling elephant population, which has dropped from 1.5
million in the 1970s to an estimated 600,000 now _ victims of
poachers after their tusks.
   The ban gives ivory traders until Jan. 18 to sell their stocks.
But Hong Kong companies say they will need much longer to sell 670
tons of ivory, the world's largest known stockpile, worth about
$128 million.
   Wong estimates the value of his own uncarved ivory at about
$25,600 and said he has no idea what to do. ``It'll take at least
five years to carve it all.''
   Local traders are lobbying the government in this British colony
to allow them to continue sales past the January deadline and are
scrambling to figure out how to save their industry.
   ``Between the elephants and the carvers, who do you think should
be protected?'' asked an angry Dominic Ng, a leading ivory trader.
   Ng suggests the government forbid the import of more tusks but
allow the carving and export of the existing stockpile until the
ban is reviewed in 1991 by CITES.
   But since the United States, Japan and other major ivory import
markets are upholding the ban, it is not clear how much such a
policy would help the industry in Hong Kong. The only legal market
for traders would be smaller countries that do not belong to CITES
or refuse to go along with the ban.
   The Hong Kong government has indicated it will abide by the
trade ban, and officials are considering vocational training for
carvers thrown out of work.
   But Wong is skeptical about retraining workers.
   ``Ivory carvers usually do not have much education,'' he said.
``It is too late for them to learn another skill and doing other
odd jobs will barely make ends meet.''
   The government also has promised to seek support for the
creation of an international fund to buy up the ivory stockpile in
Hong Kong.
   Local traders are demanding compensation for their stockpile,
which they say consists of ivory that was purchased with approval
by CITES before it imposed the ban.
   A government survey found 93 percent of the ivory in Hong Kong
contains valid CITES certification, but conservationists argue much
of the stockpile comes from the tusks of poached elephants that the
convention has nonetheless allowed onto the market.
   Nicholas Pirie, chairman of the local branch of the Royal
Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, says the Hong
Kong ivory must be destroyed.
   If ivory exports were permitted to continue, it would be easy
for more poached ivory to be smuggled into the colony and claimed
as part of the original stockpile, Pirie argues.
   ``I sympathize with the workers but I don't sympathize with the
bosses,'' he said.
   At his workshop, in an old residential building, Wong
methodically works on a six-inch-high elephant figure, using a tiny
drill to carve wrinkles in the animal's feet. The project will take
up to three weeks.
   Such craftsmanship has been an integral part of Chinese art for
centuries. But Wong believes the long history of ivory carving in
Hong Kong, now the main center for such work, is reaching an end
with or without the ban.
   ``Who wants to learn how to carve ivory nowadays?'' he said,
explaining it takes five years of apprenticeship and pays only
about $500 a month.

   The dollar ended lower in choppy European trading
Wednesday in a market dominated by the West German mark.
   Gold and silver were up strongly.
   In late afternoon trading, the dollar changed hands at 1.8095

   The stock market chalked up a moderate gain
today, bolstered by a stronger-than-expected report on the state of
business activity.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials rose 9.81 to 2,649.10 by
2 p.m. on Wall Street.
   Gainers outnumbered losers by nearly 4 to 3 in nationwide
trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 775 up, 583

   The Commerce Department reported that new orders for durable
goods showed a 0.6 percent decline in October.
   Excluding military items, which are subject to wide swings month

   Analysts said the news came as a positive surprise for traders
who have grown increasingly worried lately about the slowing pace
of the economy.
   But they questioned whether investors would bid enthusiastically

   The markets will be closed Thursday for Thanksgiving, and will

   In another sign of tough times on Wall Street,
Merrill Lynch &amp; Co. on Wednesday announced a restructuring expected
to include layoffs and said changes in the industry had hurt
profits and ``permanently altered the market landscape.''
   In a letter to employees, Merrill Lynch's top two executives
said the giant firm would realign or eliminate unprofitable areas,
cut operating costs and trim investment bankers' bonuses.
   Merrill Lynch, the nation's largest retail brokerage with 40,500
employees and 12,600 brokers worldwide, said layoffs are likely but
it did not give an estimate.
   Wall Street still is struggling to recover from the October 1987
stock market crash and subsequent slowdown in the securities
business. A number of major firms this year have laid off thousands
of employees and slashed divisions in an attempt to stay profitable.
   ``Here we are two years from the crash and business is still
tough, profits are still under tremendous pressure and
unfortunately there is no reason to be tremendously optimistic
looking into 1990,'' said analyst Lawrence Eckenfelder at
Prudential Bache Securities Inc. in San Francisco.
   ``There isn't a firm out there that isn't to some extent in a
similar position to Merrill,'' he said.
   Merrill attributed its problems to increased competition from
commercial banks and foreign securities firms, continued
overcapacity pre-dating the crash and higher business risks.
   ``These factors have permanently altered the market landscape
and are likely to remain intense throughout the coming decade,''
Merrill Chairman William A. Schreyer and President Daniel P. Tully
said in the letter dated Monday.
   ``Indeed, they have already reduced or even eliminated the
profitability of some of our businesses, and operating results have
not been what we want them to be,'' said the letter, released
publicly Wednesday. ``We must recognize that many of these changes
are not short-term or cyclical in nature. They are fundamental and
will not go away.''
   Merrill reported third-quarter earnings of $41 million, down 38
percent from $65.6 million in the year-earlier period, while
nine-month profit fell 20.8 percent to $148.4 million. The firm
blamed an industry slowdown in businesses including stock and
municipal bond underwriting and bond trading.
   Schreyer and Tully said that despite gains in market share in
some areas and growth in client assets, ``our profitability as
measured by return on equity is still not adequate.''
   Earlier this week, Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc., the nation's No.
2 brokerage, slashed broker commissions for the first time in 15
years shortly after it began laying off 800 people and
restructuring senior management.
   Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc., in a major retrenchment following
its settlement of securities fraud charges, sold its entire retail
brokerage business and cut hundreds of employees in recent months.
   Merrill this year already has reduced its payroll by 550 jobs,
bringing the total number of cuts since the end of 1987 to 5,500.
Overall, employment on Wall Street totaled 229,000 at the end of
June, down 12.6 percent from a peak of 262,200 in early 1987.
   Industry profits in second-quarter 1989 topped $1 billion,
thanks to lower interest rates, higher stock-trading volume and
more merger and stock underwriting activity.
   All those areas have slumped since then. Volume on the New York
Stock Exchange hit a 1989 low of 151.8 million shares in September.
Volume leaped to a high of 182.4 million in October, but much of
that occurred during and shortly after the Oct. 13 market plunge.
   The dollar amount of merger activity for the first nine months
of the year was off 14 percent from 1988 and leveraged buyouts, a
major source of revenue for Wall Street firms, were off 21 percent,
according to Securities Data Co.
   The volume of initial public stock offerings by companies was
down 48.7 percent in the first nine months of 1989, Securities Data
said. Just 151 companies have one public so far this year, compared
with 210 last year, 502 in 1987 and 496 in 1986. Junk bond issuance
is down about 40 percent.
   ``Firms have taken an increasingly gloomy look and said if this
continues at the rate it is we're going to have continued
overcapacity and we're going to have to cut further,'' said Jeffrey
Schaefer, senior vice president of the Securities Industry
Association.

<TEXT>
   Ashland Oil Inc., continuing its financial
mop-up of one of the nation's largest inland fuel spills, has
agreed to pay the state a record $4.6 million in costs and civil
penalties, officials said Tuesday.
   Gov. Robert P. Casey said the money will finance a number of
state environmental initiatives, including an aquatic survey of the
Ohio River Basin and scholarships and training in the study of
natural resources.
   The governor said it was the largest payment ever made in
Pennsylvania for an environmental violation.
   ``We wanted to punish Ashland. We wanted them to pay substantial
penalties for what they did. And then we wanted to broaden the
effect of this so that there would be long-term environmental
benefit that would come from this incident,'' Casey said.
   ``I'm serving notice ... that the protection of the environment
of Pennsylvania is a top priority, that polluters will pay dearly
when they harm the environment,'' he said.
   Ashland agreed to the settlement to avoid protracted litigation,
company Chairman John R. Hall said.
   ``This essentially concludes all outstanding issues associated
with the spill,'' he said.
   The accident occurred Jan. 2, 1988, when a 3.8 million-gallon
storage tank collapsed at Ashland's Floreffe terminal south of
Pittsburgh and sent 750,000 gallons of fuel into the Monongahela
River, which flows into the Ohio River.
   The spill killed thousands of birds and fish and forced public
water systems in Pennsylvania, Ohio and West Virginia to stop
drawing water from the rivers.
   Casey described negotiations with the Kentucky-based oil giant
as ``intensive and extensive.''
   ``I don't think something like this is easily forgotten,'' he
said. ``I think our people were deeply affected by this, I know I
was, and this agreement ...is a strong statement of how deeply we
feel about this.''
   So far, the spill has cost Ashland at least $32.5 million, said
Ashland spokesman Roger Schrum. That figure consists of $14 million
for damages, expenses and civil penalties, including the $4.6
million Pennsylvania agreement; $11 million for cleanup; $2.25 for
a federal criminal fine; and $5.25 million in attorneys' fees.
   The company has set aside an additional $10 million from a
class-action settlement to handle any outstanding claims. So far
Ashland has settled more than 5,000 third-party claims, Schrum
said, but it isn't known how many potential claims remain.
   Schrum said the costs have not had a significant impact on the
company's earnings. Ashland had to pay a $2.5 million deductible,
but insurance covered most of the balance of the penalties, damage
and cleanup costs, he said.
   Part of the problem of assessing damage from the spill was that
no biological studies of the Ohio had been conducted before the
accident, Casey said.
   Of the $4.6 million settlement, $1.25 million is for civil
penalties and $1.75 million will fund a comprehensive aquatic
survey of the Ohio River Basin.
   Of the remaining funds:
   _$300,000 will fund environmental training programs in
Pittsburgh;
   _$215,000 will be used to develop a scholarship endowment fund
to state residents pursuing careers in environmental protection;
   _$250,000 will be paid to the Pennsylvania Fish Commission and
$200,000 to the state Game Commission;
   _$35,000 will be given to the Department of Environmental
Resources to purchase water quality enforcement equipment; and
   _$660,000 reimburses DER and other state agencies for their
costs in the cleanup.

   Share prices closed higher Wednesday, boosted by
moderate gains in early Wall Street dealings.
   The Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index finished 7.2
points, or 0.3 percent, higher at 2,192.3, but down from an early
peak of 2,197.4. At its lowest, the index dipped to 2,186.6 at late
morning.
   Volume was a light 324.2 million shares, down from Tuesday's
modest 350.6 million shares.
   Dealers said a flurry of corporate news ahead of official
dealings helped London to early gains, but that there was a lack of
aggressive follow-through buying.
   The market's upward potential was capped by continuing weakness
in sterling, dealers said. There were fears that Thursday's release
of British trade figures for October could depress the currency and
the London equity market, they said.

<HEAD>Head Of Japan's Central Bank Stepping Down At End Of Term</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Bank of Japan Governor Satoshi Sumita, who carried
out monetary policy during a period of historic economic and trade
events, will step down when his term ends Dec. 16, the government
announced Wednesday.
   Minister of Finance Ryutaro Hashimoto told a news conference
Wednesday that Yasushi Mieno, senior deputy governor at the central
bank, would replace Sumita.
   It widely had been believed that Sumita would step down at the
end of his term, to be replaced by Mieno. During the day, Sumita
had conferred with Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu and with Hashimoto
and expressed his readiness to resign.
   At his own news conference, Sumita generally lauded the choice
of Mieno as his successor and said he did not expect any basic
changes in Japan's monetary policy.
   Sumita's statement about Japanese monetary policy referred to
the Bank of Japan's fundamental inflation-fighting posture and
suggested that he wasn't addressing the issue of another possible
discount rate increase.
   Mieno, 65, is a Tokyo University graduate and has served as
chief of the Osaka branch of the Bank of Japan as well as head of
the central bank's business bureau.
   While in office, Sumita carried out monetary policy that helped
pave the way for Japan's present sustained economic growth and
relative price stability.
   The Bank of Japan cut its official discount rate five times to
help spur economic growth following the September 1985 agreement
among the so-called Group of Seven major industrial countries to
guide the dollar down and help the U.S. reduce its trade deficits.
   At his press conference, Hashimoto praised Sumita for helping
Japan through the difficult period. He said Sumita's contributions
toward overcoming the nation's economic slowdown and establishing
steady growth were highly regarded.
   More recently, as the yen has been softening against the dollar
and raising the danger of inflation, the central bank rtaised its
discount rate on May 31, ending its nine-year-old easy monetary
stance.
   The Bank of Japan raised the discount rate for the second time
this year, to 3.75 percent, on Oct. 11 in an attempt to prevent the
yen from falling further.
   Sumita, at his press conferences and speeches in recent weeks,
has been warning about the danger of inflation, pointing to a
tightening balance of supply and demand in both labor and products
and to considerable money supply growth.
   While he has tried to discourage speculation about still another
hike in the discount rate this year, such speculation has persisted
in Japan's financial markets. But Sumita has said the central bank
is studying the effects of the previous discount rate increases,
indicating that it was premature to boost rates again.
   ``(Sumita) served during a very difficult time,'' Hashimoto
said, characterizing him as a ``strong central bank governor.''
   Recalling Sumita took over the Bank of Japan four years
ago,Hashimoto lauded the governor's ``appropriate efforts'' in
helping to expand Japan's domestic economy and shifting currency
rates in line with the September 1985 Plaza Accord and successor
agreements such as the Louvre currency accord of February 1987.
   When Sumita became governor, the dollar was hovering at about
247.85 yen, compared with its recent levels of about 143.50 yen.

   Allied-Lyons PLC, a major British food and beverage group,

Dunkin' Donuts Inc.
   Dunkin' Donuts fought off a hostile takeover earlier this year
by DD Acquisition Corp., a Canadian partnership. In December,
Dunkin' Donuts decided to accept bids on a friendly basis.
   London-based Allied-Lyons agreed to pay $47.25 a share for all

<HEAD>Soybean Futures Rally; Grains Close Mixed</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Soybean futures prices closed moderately higher
Wednesday on the Chicago Board of Trade amid a bevy of mildly
bullish developments. Wheat futures declined slightly while corn
was little changed.
   Supportive factors in the soybean market included a dip in
farmer sales of soybeans before the Thanksgiving holiday; talk of
export interest from Spain, Japan and Indonesia; and a Census
Bureau report showing lower-than-expected U.S. stocks of soybean
oil at the end of October.
   The move may have been exaggerated by thin market conditions
caused by the absence of traders who got an early start on the long
weekend.
   Analyst Dale Gustafson of Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. in Chicago
said some traders may also have bought soybeans in anticipation of
a rally when trading resumes Friday.
   In the past decade, he said, the soybean market has tended to
climb on the day after Thanksgiving.
   ``I don't know why,'' Gustafson said. ``Maybe all the bears go
on vacation.''
   Wheat futures were pressured by forecasts for needed rain in
U.S. winter wheat areas in the coming week.
   At the close, wheat futures were 1 cent to 2 cents lower with
the contract for delivery in December at $4.08 a bushel; corn was {
cent lower to \ cent higher with December at $2.38 a bushel; oats
were 1 cent to 1} cents higher with December at $1.46{ a bushel;
soybeans were 2{ cents to 4 cents higher with January at $5.89} a

<TEXT>
   Reed International PLC, a British paper, packaging
and publishing company, announced Wednesday that its American
subsidiary has agreed to buy the the legal publisher
Martindale-Hubbell Inc. for $303.7 million.
   Martindale-Hubbell, a privately owned concern based in New
Providence, N.J., publishes the Martindale-Hubbell Law Directory.
   ``This acquisition offers us a unique opportunity to expand our
subscription-based information publishing for the U.S. legal
market,'' said Peter Davis, Reed International's chief executive.
   The directory provides background information on over 700,000
U.S. lawyers and 44,000 law firms. It has a circulation of about
45,000.
   Reed said that Martindale-Hubbell is very similar to R.R.
Bowker, a U.S. specialist library information group which Reed
acquired four years ago.
   ``This acquisition is expected to create substantial synergistic
benefits for both Martindale-Hubbell and R.R. Bowker,'' Reed said.
   Martindale-Hubbell's pre-tax profit came to $14.9 million in
1988, the announcement said. The company is forecasting a rise of
10 percent to 15 percent in this year's pre-tax earnings.
   Martindale-Hubbell's net assets stood at $31.5 million at the
end of last year, but this didn't include any valuation for
publishing rights. The company employs 363 people.
   The buyer is Reed Publishing USA, the main U.S. operating
subsidiary of Reed International. It is headquartered in Newton,
Mass.
   Reed said Martindale-Hubbell would be merged with a newly-formed
subsidiary of Reed Publishing USA.
   Richard Carolan and Tina Carolan, who control a majority of
Martindale-Hubbell's voting stock, are selling their shares to Reed
and are retiring from management positions in the company.
   Ira Siegel, the president of R.R. Bowker, will be appointed
president and chief operating officer of Martindale-Hubbell, Reed
said. The other Martindale-Hubbell managers are staying on at the
company, Reed said.
   Reed intends to complete the purchase Jan. 3.

<DATELINE>LAS VEGAS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Steve Wynn, the hotel-casino builder who
promised ``a wonderment the world will flock to see,'' on Wednesday
opened the glitzy $630 million Mirage Hotel _ scented volcano and
all _ on the Las Vegas Strip.
   The 3,049-room hotel is the Strip's first new resort in 15 years
and already has sparked a $2.5 billion building boom in this gaming
and entertainment capital.
   ``We've been waiting four years going on 20 to say, `Welcome to
the Mirage,''' Wynn told a crowd that included Gov. Bob Miller.
``We've often said fantasy becomes reality. But fantasy is a dream,
it's not real, at least not until today.''
   Thousands of people began pouring into the resort when the doors
opened to the public at noon. Many of the spectators were guests
who lined up to register, while others just milled through the
resort to view the spectacle.
   The first two ``guests'' to check into the resort were two white
tigers belonging to illusionists Siegfried and Roy, who have signed
a $58 million contract to appear at the resort beginning Dec. 26.
   Wynn praised a number of people who played a major role in the
Mirage, including indicted financier Michael Milken, former head of
the junk bond division of Drexel Burnham Lambert that arranged the
$565 million financing for the project.
   Wynn is chairman and majority owner of Golden Nugget Inc., which
owns the Mirage and Golden Nugget Hotel.
   The hotel's 6,000 employees and about as many guests received a
preview look at the Mirage on Monday and Tuesday.
   Tuesday night saw a flurry of activity as workers stocked plush
stores and put the finishing touches on the exotic habitat for the
Siegfried and Roy tigers.
   Wynn had planned to open the Mirage on Dec. 26, but moved the
date up when he landed the Sugar Ray Leonard-Roberto Duran
championship fight for Dec. 7.
   Tourists gawked and traffic stopped on the busy six-lane Strip
this week as workers conducted final tests on a flame-spewing,
54-foot volcano in front of the resort. Wynn, who was upset by the
gaseous odor emitted from the eruptions, persuaded utility
executives to come up with a mix that has the scent of pina colada.
   Guests arrive via a palm-lined entry that features the volcano,
three lagoons and waterfalls. Valets whisk arriving cars through a
maze of tunnels under the resort.
   The top five floors contain 260 penthouse suites for coveted
casino customers. And for his high-stakes ``stratosphere'' players,
Wynn has six private bungalows at one side of the resort, each with
its own swimming pool.
   The main hotel pool is a quarter-mile around. Nearby is planned
a dolphin habitat approved by the National Marine Fisheries
Service, including a 1.5 million gallon saltwater aquarium.
   Registering guests are greeted with a flashy, glass-front $1.2
million tank containing 20,000 gallons of water and four-foot
sharks. Nearby is an atrium and dome nine stories high with palm
trees 70 feet tall.
   Along the perimeter of the casino are restaurants that will
serve 2,500 people, and 30,000 square feet of retail space catering
to an affluent clientele. Room rates run $89 to $129 a night.
   The casino covers an area more than twice the size of a football
field and has features ranging from nickel slots to a room for high
rollers where $1,000 chips are the minimum available.
   The hotel's 1,500-seat, $30 million showroom will feature
Siegfried and Roy, who will perform three weeks a month. The other
week will be filled by stars such as Dolly Parton, Kenny Rogers,
Johnny Mathis and Cher.
   Siegfried and Roy's tigers will have their own habitat, at the
end of a moving walkway that brings people from the Strip to one
area of the resort.
   Planned nearby is ``The Jackson Attraction,'' featuring
memorabilia of Wynn's friend, Michael Jackson, a frequent visitor
to Las Vegas.
   The volcano and waterfalls are designed to block the neon of
other resorts across the Strip.
   ``I'm burned out on neon,'' said Wynn, whose company's Golden
Nugget Hotel downtown has no neon. ``I think it's cheap. To me,
neon is yesterday Las Vegas.''
   Wynn is confident the Mirage will be profitable, despite the
high cost, and said it could earn the $1 million a day needed to
pay for it.

<HEAD>Government's Latest Privatization To Raise $8 Million</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By COTTEN TIMBERLAKE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government Wednesday reduced the price for
shares in Britain's water industry in an attempt to attract
investors during a period of high interest rates and slumping
stocks.
   The government said it would sell 2.183 million shares at 240
pence each, or $3.77, or a total of 5.24 billion pounds, $8.2
billion. That would make the sale Britain's third-largest
privatization.
   The government previously had indicated a price of 250 pence a
share, or $3.93, in the sale of the 10 water authorities of England
and Wales.
   Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher's Conservative government has
sold off billions of dollars worth of state-owned companies in the
past decade to promote capitalism in Britain.
   The two biggest privatizations have been the sale of the
government's remaining one-third stake in British Petroleum Co.
PLC, which fetched $11.3 billion and the $8.5 billion sale of
British Gas PLC.
   All the sales will be dwarfed, however, by the planned sale of
Britain's electricity industry, which could raise more than $31
billion. The government hopes to complete that sale before the next
election, which must be called by mid-1992.
   Analysts said the government reduced the price of the water
shares to lure investors in an unfavorable environment.
   Interest rates at an eight-year high of 15 percent coupled with
Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson's sudden resignation last
month have fueled fears of a recession in Britain and helped to
undermine confidence in London's stock market.
   Investors also were shaken when London share prices took a big
tumble on Oct. 16, after a severe drop on Wall Street the previous
Friday.
   The water and electricity sales also have prompted sharp
protests from critics who believe public utilities should remain
under government control to protect consumers from price hikes in
vital services.
   Government minister Michael Howard said the water sale has been
fully underwritten and that there has been ``encouraging interest''
from financial institutions.
   About 4.3 million people have already registered as potential
shareholders to qualify for perks in the form of discounts or bonus
shares, the government said.
   Opposition Labor lawmaker Ann Taylor said the government set a
low price because it ``is obviously extremely worried that they
will not be able to sell these shares.''
   With the exception of the BP sale, which coincide with the
October 1987 stock market crash, the privatizations have been
hugely successful, swelling the ranks of British shareholders.
   Trading in the water shares is to begin on London's Stock
Exchange on Dec. 12, although analysts expect active ``gray
market'' of unofficial trading among institutional investors before
then.
   The government is selling half the shares to institutional
investors in packages made up of all 10 water authorities. It also
has allotted 18.5 percent of the shares for overseas investors.
   The remaining shares are being sold to British individuals who
can choose to buy shares in any of the 10 authorities. They will be
required to buy a minimum of 100 shares each, and will be able to
pay for them in installments. The initial payment will be 100
pounds, or $157.
   The shares' annualized yields will vary from 8.1 percent for
Thames Water, Britain's largest water authority, to 9.7 percent for
South West Water.

<HEAD>Experts Say Consumer Has Edge This Holiday Season</HEAD>
<HEAD>With AM-Holidays-Credit Tips</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By VIVIAN MARINO</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   With the economy weakening and some retailers already offering
deep discounts, experts say bargain-hunting consumers could do well
this holiday season _ if they play their credit cards right.
   Faced with slower activity as a result of the weakening economy,
card issuers are offering promotions such as pre-approved cards,
sweepstakes, free rides to shopping areas and other premiums to
spur card use during the critical buying season.
   ``The consumers have gained a big new edge,'' said Robert K.
Heady, publisher of Bank Rate Monitor, which tracks interest rates
among major banks and thrifts nationwide. ``But you've got to do
your homework before you dash into the malls screaming, `charge.'''
   Interest rates on credit cards and unsecured personal loans are
up sharply from the holiday shopping season of a year ago,
according to North Palm Beach, Fla.-based Bank Rate Monitor.
   The average bank credit card, for example, carries of rate of
18.66 percent, compared with 18.15 percent a year ago. Personal
loans average 17.11 percent, up from 16.44 percent in 1988, it said.
   The stakes are even steeper in California, where some of the
major banks charge as much as 20 percent interest on credit cards
and 21.75 percent on personal loans, Bank Rate Monitor said.
   In some cases rates on retailers' charge cards can run even
higher.
   But consumers can avoid any of these finance charges and take
advantage of the relatively easy access to credit if they pay their
monthly bills on time, something consumer groups recommend and
about 40 percent of card-using Americans do.
   With card costs running high, credit-card companies, banks and
retailers have been focusing on special services or promotions as
they vie for consumer dollars.
   As much as a quarter of their charge volume from the 130 million
Americans that buy on credit comes during the lucrative Christmas
holiday season.
   The competition seems to be steeper this year as recent economic
data reveal anemic growth, prompting some retailers to already
begin offering discounts, something virtually unheard of in the
early years of the nation's seven-year-old economic expansion.
   ``There seems to be more promotion,'' said Elgie Holstein,
director of the non-profit consumer group Bankcard Holders of
America. ``The real emphasis is not to sign up new cardholders but
to get get you to use one card over another.''
   Issues are using direct mail and broadcast ads to tout deals
ranging from pre-approved credit cards to free transportation to
shopping districts.
   MasterCard and Visa are offering special contests giving
cardholders a chance at winning prizes every time they use their
cards during the holidays. Visa's grand prize is having bills up to
$1 million paid over a five-year period; MasterCard provides up to
$18,000 a year over 10 years.
   American Express has been heavily promoting its buyer-protection
plan, which gives cardholders limited warranties on charged
merchandise that's lost, stolen or broken.
   And for the first time it's offering to bus cardholders in New
York City and Chicago to key shopping areas. If it works out,
American Express says it may expand the service to other cities
next year.
   But despite these promotions many economists predict that
consumers aren't likely to spend as much as they had in previous
years when economic conditions were booming, particularly for major
purchase items like automobiles or appliances.
   ``I don't mean to sound like Scrooge ... (but) you're going to
have a cautious consumer going into the holiday season,'' said
Maury Harris, chief economist for PaineWebber Inc. ``There's not a
lot of pent-up demand.''
   Economists note recent reports that show drops in retail and
auto sales as well as overall durable goods. Harris also cited a
sharp increase in applications for unemployment benefits in recent
months.

   Assets of the nation's 478 money market mutual
funds rose $4.65 billion to a new record in the latest week, the
Investment Company Institute said Thursday.
   The rise, to a record $368.27 billion in the seven-day period
ended Wednesday, followed a $200.8 million drop in the funds'
assets the previous week, according to the Washington-based mutual
fund trade group.
   The Investment Company Institute said that in the latest week,
assets of 235 general purpose funds rose $737 million to $119.53
billion, assets of 97 broker-dealer funds increased $1.72 billion
to $159.11 billion, and assets of 146 institutional funds rose
$2.19 billion to $89.62 billion.
   The seven-day average yield on money market mutual funds fell in
the week ended Tuesday to 7.99 percent from 8.01 percent the
previous week, according to Donoghue's Money Fund Report, a trade
journal based in Holliston, Mass.
   The 30-day average yield fell to 8.05 percent from 8.09 percent,
Donoghue's said.
   The average maturity of the portfolios held by money funds was
44 days, up from 43 days, Donoghue's said.
   Separately, the newsletter Bank Rate Monitor said its survey of
100 leading commercial banks, savings and loan associations and
savings banks in the nation's 10 largest markets showed the
effective annual yield available on money market accounts fell to
6.37 percent as of Wednesday from 6.38 percent a week earlier.
   The North Palm Beach, Fla.-based newsletter said the effective
annual yield available on special savings accounts, called Super
NOW accounts, was unchanged at 5.08 percent.
   Bank Rate Monitor said the effective annual yield was 8.09
percent on six-month certificates of deposit, down from 8.11
percent the previous week. Yields were 8.12 percent on 1-year CDs,
down from 8.16 percent; 8.05 percent on 2{-year CDs, down from 8.09
percent; and 8.05 percent on 5-year CDs, down from 8.09 percent.

   In a bid to bolster sagging revenues, a number
of major airlines plan to raise fares on most domestic routes and
eliminate discount fares used mainly by business travelers.
   United Airlines, the nation's second-largest carrier, led the
move Tuesday and quickly was matched by several competitors.
   United said that as of Nov. 30, its first-class, one-way fares
will increase by $8, while full-fare and some discounted coach
prices will go up by $5. The increases don't apply to the popular
MaxSavers, the airlines' most deeply discounted advance-purchase
fares.
   A full-fare unrestricted coach ticket on United from Chicago to
Los Angeles, for example, will be raised from $525 one way to $530.
A first-class, one-way ticket from Boston to Seattle will go from
$792 to $800.
   Chicago-based United said it also was eliminating on Nov. 29 its
same-day purchase Supercoach fares, used mainly by business
travelers. That fare is $399 one way from Chicago to Los Angeles.
   Spokesmen for Trans World Airlines, Continental Airlines,
Eastern Airlines and Midway Airlines said they would match most of
the increases. Delta Air Lines, USAir Group Inc. and Northwest
Airlines said Wednesday they were studying the issue.
   American Airlines, the biggest U.S. carrier, will match the fare
increases but doesn't plan to eliminate its Supercoach fares, said
American spokesman Jim Brown.
   Robert Decker, an analyst with Duff &amp; Phelps Inc. in Chicago,
said that given a recent slowdown in passenger traffic ``I'd be
surprised if United's action held up across the board.''
   Passenger traffic normally begins increasing at this time of
year, a peak holiday travel season.
   The fare hikes are needed because of higher operating costs,
mainly fuel prices that rose by 16 percent in the third quarter,
said United spokesman Rob Doughty.
   Analysts are predicting a disappointing performance by the
industry for the fourth quarter and continued higher costs next
year.
   ``I think it's a very positive move on the part of the
airlines,'' said Louis Marckesano, who follows the industry for
Janney Montgomery Scott Inc. in Philadelphia. ``This would be a
first step in checking that erosion.''
   The next step, Marckesano said, might be for the airlines to
raise their deep-discount MaxSaver fares. He said they may wish to
postpone that move until after the holiday season to avoid
antagonizing vacationers, the most frequent users of MaxSavers.
   The airlines made their last major fare increase in September,
when they boosted their cheapest fares by more than 15 percent and
doubled cancellation penalties. They also raised Supercoach fares
by around $20 for a one-way ticket.
   The September increases followed a big discount move in
mid-August, when the airlines slashed some round-trip fares by as
much as $160 to lure passengers in the historically weak autumn
season. Most fares to Europe were reduced by $100 through next
spring.

   The nation's Big Three automakers said Wednesday
that 20,300 workers will be temporarily laid off next week in new
and extended production shutdowns because of sagging vehicle demand.
   Ford Motor Co. said it would stop production at its Dearborn,
Mich., assembly plant for the week of Dec. 4. The company also said
it was extending by a week a previously announced one-week shutdown
of its Lorain, Ohio, plant that begins next week.
   The Dearborn plant, which employs about 2,100 hourly workers,
makes Mustang cars. The 2,700 hourly workers at the Lorain plant
make Ford Thunderbird and Mercury Cougar cars.
   Chrysler Corp. said it would suspend production of the Dodge
Omni and Plymouth Horizon at its Jefferson Avenue plant in Detroit
next week, putting 1,700 workers on temporary layoff.
   Chrysler had announced earlier it would shut down its Toledo,
Ohio, Jeep assembly plant next week, affecting 5,500 employees.
   Also, General Motors Corp. said its assembly plants in
Doraville, Ga., and Fairfax, Kan., would be down next week,
affecting 4,200 and 4,100 workers respectively.
   The Doraville plant makes the Oldsmobile Cutlass Supreme car and
the Fairfax factory makes the Pontiac Grand Prix.

   The stock market staged a pre-Thanksgiving rally
in moderate trading Wednesday, bolstered by stronger-than-expected
economic news and talk that interest rates might be headed lower.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials rose 17.49 points to
2,656.78.
   Advancing issues outnumbered declines by about 3 to 2 in
nationwide trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed stocks, with
888 up, 565 down and 533 unchanged.
   The Commerce Department reported that new orders for durable
goods showed a 0.6 percent decline in October.
   Excluding military items, which are subject to wide swings month
to month, the department said orders for goods with usable lives of
several years or more increased 0.5 percent from the month before.
   Analysts said the news came as a positive surprise for traders
who have grown increasingly worried lately about the slowing pace
of the economy.
   The market's advance also got a boost at midsession from signs
that the Federal Reserve might have taken further steps to relax
its credit policy.
   The markets will be closed Thursday for Thanksgiving, and will
be open Friday for what traditionally is one of the Street's
slowest days of the year.
   Texas Instruments climbed 4} to 36{ in active trading. On
Tuesday the news surfaced that the company had been granted a
patent in Japan for the basic integrated circuit.
   Other gainers among the blue chips included General Electric, up
{ at 60[; McDonald's, up ] at 32}; Philip Morris, up | at 41];
Coca-Cola, up | at 77|, and International Business Machines, up |
at 100[.
   Syntex added 1| to 49|. Late Tuesday the company reported higher
earnings for its fiscal quarter ended Oct. 31.
   Some precious-metals stocks added to their recent gains as the
price of gold climbed $7.30 to $411 an ounce on the Commodity
Exchange in New York. ASA Ltd. rose | to 56[; Newmont Gold 1[ to
50[, and Bond International Gold } to 10{.
   Home Intensive Care, traded in the over-the-counter market,
tumbled 4 5-16 to 3 5-16. The company said it would try to persuade
Congress to reverse a measure that would cut in half the Medicare
reimbursements it receives for dialysis treatment.
   Volume on the floor of the Big Board came to 145.73 million
shares, against 147.90 million in the previous session. Nationwide,
consolidated volume in NYSE-listed issues, including trades in
those stocks on regional exchanges and in the over-the-counter
market, totaled 178.67 million shares.
   As measured by Wilshire Associates' index of more than 5,000
actively traded stocks, the market increased $17.93 billion, or
0.54 percent, in value.

   Bond prices edged higher Wednesday in an
abbreviated pre-Thanksgiving session amid signs the Federal Reserve
was encouraging lower interest rates.
   The Treasury's benchmark 30-year bond rose \ point, or about
$2.50 per $1,000 in face amount. Its yield fell to 7.87 percent
from 7.90 percent late Tuesday.
   Martin Mauro, senior economist for Merrill Lynch Capital
Markets, said bonds got a lift at midday when the Fed injected
reserves into the financial system by making short-term purchases
of securities from dealers.
   ``Traders think the Fed is being friendly, being
accommodative,'' he said.
   By making funds available to the financial system, he said the
central bank takes pressure off interest rates. Falling interest
rates boost bond prices.
   The injection of reserves was reflected in a decline in the
federal funds rate, the interest on overnight loans between banks.
The rate dropped to 8[ percent from 8{ percent late Tuesday.
   Ward McCarthy, an analyst for the investment firm Stone &amp;
McCarthy Research Associates Inc. in Princeton, N.J., said a
government report that orders for durable goods fell 0.6 percent in
October failed to move the bond market.
   The news had been widely expected and added to the pool of
evidence pointing to a slowdown in manufacturing.
   Activity in the bond market drew to a close at 3 p.m. EST, about
two hours easrlier than normal, because many traders left early
ahead of Thanksgiving.
   Markets in the United States and Japan are closed for holidays
on Thursday while markets in West Germany were closed Wednesday for
a holiday.
   In the secondary market for Treasury securities, prices of
short-term governments rose \ point, intermediate maturities
climbed ] point and long-term issues were up as much as 5-16 point,
according to Telerate Inc., the financial information service.
   The movement of a point is equivalent to a change of $10 in the
price of a bond with a $1,000 face value.
   The Shearson Lehman Hutton Daily Treasury Bond Index, which
measures price movements on all outstanding Treasury issues with
maturities of a year or longer, rose 2.91 to 1,197.61.
   In corporate trading, industrials were up. Moody's Investment
Grade Corporate Bond Index, which measures total return on a
portfolio of 80 corporate bonds with maturities of five years or
longer, rose 0.15 to 339.21.
   In the tax-exempt market, the Bond Buyer index of 40 actively
traded municipal bonds rose [ to 93]. The average yield to maturity
slipped to 7.27 percent from 7.28 percent late Tuesday.
   Yields on three-month Treasury bills fell to 7.85 percent as the
discount dropped 12 basis points to 7.51 percent. Yields on
six-month bills fell to 7.69 percent as the discount fell 11 basis
points to 7.32 percent. Yields on one-year bills dropped to 7.54
percent as the discount fell 10 basis points to 7.05 percent.
   A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point. The yield
is the annualized return on an investment in a Treasury bill. The
discount is the percentage that bills are selling below the face
value, which is paid at maturity.

<HEAD>Chinese Banks to Lend $27 Billion to State-Run Enterprises</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Chinese banks have decided to lend $27 billion to
state-run enterprises strapped for cash, although the government's
overall tight credit policy remains in effect, a central bank
official said Wednesday.
   The loans are to be extended in this year's last quarter, said
Hong Yuncheng, spokesman for People's Bank of China.
   ``The loans are still within the original plan set for this year
and the fund shortages will be eased to a certain extent,'' the
official Xinhua News Agency quoted Hong as saying. ``The tight
credit policy is still proceeding in accordance with the schedule
and the total number of loans has been brought under control.''
   One Asian economic expert in Beijing, speaking on condition of
anonymity, said the government actually appeared to be relaxing its
credit restrictions ``because the economy is so bad.''
   The large injection of funds is not likely to be a heavy
economic burden, said a Western diplomat familiar with China's
economy.
   ``The government has been saving up pennies all year to have a
big wad of cash in the fourth quarter when the harvest comes in,
when they really need cash,'' said the diplomat, also insisting on
anonymity. ``They don't need to issue IOUs and can stay within
budget.''
   Last year, the government issued large amounts of IOUs to
farmers for contracted grain, causing widespread resentment and
some protests.
   This year, there have been isolated reports of IOUs being issued.
   ``In China, it's not unusual for a lot of money to move into the
economy in the fourth quarter. What is unusual is that the Chinese
have shown such restraint in the first three quarters,'' the
diplomat said. ``But the government has been promising more money,
and it appears they have it. ...It seems in line with credit growth
projections.''
   Xinhua quoted unidentified analysts as saying China must stick
to its austerity program and tight monetary and credit policy for
the next two or three years in the face of continuing high
inflation and demand for funds.
   The central bank is joining the Industrial and Commercial Bank,
the Bank of China, Agricultural Bank and others to raise money for
the loans to finance key state projects, purchases of agricultural
goods, and exports, Hong said.
   Under the tightened credit policy, the banks' priority is to
raise money for large enterprises, he said.
   ``This will enliven the domestic economy and ensure the normal
development of industrial and agricultural production,'' he said.
   Chinese banks already have offered $108 million in loans to
hundreds of foreign-funded enterprises facing fund shortages
because of China's austerity program.
   The People's Bank of China also has announced a $5.4 billion
loan to avoid issuing IOUs to farmers who are selling autumn crops
to the state. It was not clear if this was included in the $27
billion package.
   The austerity measures, which began a year ago, cut government
spending and credits extended to industry, and canceled thousands
of construction projects.
   The measures have pushed many small private and collective firms
into bankruptcy and forced some larger enterprises to the brink of
financial collapse.
   In October, industrial output value declined for the first time
in the past decade of reforms, raising fears the economy was headed
for recession.

   OPEC oil ministers began arriving in
Vienna Wednesday for discussions on pricing and production strategy
for 1990.
   Saudi Arabia's Hisham Nazer fended off questions about increases
in the output ceiling of the 13-nation Organization of Petroleum
Exporting Countries.
   ``We will see when we meet because I haven't seen any of my
colleagues yet,'' he told reporters.
   Kuwait's Ali Khalifa al-Sabah, Ecuador's Diego Tamariz and
Venezuela's Celestino Armas also were early arrivals at the luxury
hotel where OPEC does much of its behind-the-scenes bargaining.
   Tamariz said he thought there was room for a fresh increase in
OPEC's production ceiling, but offered no figure. The cartel's
quota is 20.5 million barrels a day in the final quarter of 1989.
   The ministers were to continue arriving through Thursday, when
the cartel's monitoring committee was to meet. Although only eight
ministers are members of the panel, all were expected to attend,
officials said.
   OPEC's formal winter meeting will begin on Saturday, one of two
conferences held annually.
   The ministers' discussions could lead to a new production
agreement that will help determine OPEC's supply of crude to world
markets next year.
   Analysts estimate the cartel produced more than 23 million
barrels a day last month, well over the current cap of 20.5 million
barrels.
   Despite the flood of oil, prices have remained fairly stable in
recent months helped by unexpectedly higher demand for OPEC crude,
mainly from developing countries.
   Futures prices for West Texas Intermediate, the benchmark
American grade, have fluctuated in the $19 to $20-a-barrel range.
Middle Eastern varieties run several dollars a barrel less.
   The average price of seven crudes monitored by OPEC was $17.76 a
barrel last week, just under the cartel's price target of $18 a
barrel. Only a year ago, the basket of crudes was priced at $12.34
a barrel.
   In their discussions, the ministers will have to figure out how
much they can produce next year and still keep prices firm, or
better yet, slightly higher to meet the cartel's target price.
   The International Energy Agency, made up of 24 Western nations,
estimates demand in the first half of 1990 at slightly under 21
million barrels a day, more than 2 million barrels under what the
cartel is now producing.
   In the face of lower demand, the producing nations would have to
trim output to keep the market and prices steady and restore
discipline among those members who have been openly violating their
quotas.
   Kuwait and the United Arab Emirates have been producing more
than 2 million barrels a day, about double their individual
allotments, to press their demands for bigger shares of the
cartel's production pie, according to analysts.
   Saudi Arabia, OPEC's biggest producer and the world's largest
crude exporter, also recently began exceeding its allocation, a
move seen by analysts as a negotiating tactic before this week's
talks.
   At a September meeting, the ministers discussed a plan presented
by Iran that addressed the sensitive issue of redistributing
production shares among the 13 nations.
   The plan called for lifting the supply cap to 21.5 million
barrels a day to meet the demands of Kuwait and the United Arab
Emirates for larger shares. Gabon and Ecuador would also get more
under the proposal.
   Algeria, Indonesia, Nigeria and Venezuela would lose some of
their percentage shares as would Iran and Iraq. Saudi Arabia, Libya
and Qatar would maintain their current levels, according to the
plan.

<HEAD>Continental May Rehire Striking Workers</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DENVER (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Dozens of grounded Continental Airlines flight
attendants, furloughed after a four-day strike in March to protest
low wages, have been told by the airline that they can fly again in
mid-December.
   ``Most everyone is accepting the offer,'' said Carla Winkler, a
spokeswoman for Continental's Union of Flight Attendants in Denver.
   Ms. Winkler said the flight attendants were happy to fly again,
but were disappointed with wages at the airline, where most of the
employees do not belong to a union.
   Houston-based Continental, a subsidiary of Texas Air Corp., was
put under Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in 1983 by Texas Air
Chairman Frank Lorenzo and later emerged as a non-union carrier.
Lorenzo also put sister carrier Eastern Airlines under Chapter 11
protection, and has been rebuilding Eastern without its unions
since they struck the airline in early March.
   Ms. Winkler said most of the Continental attendants worked part
time or collected unemployment during their time off.
   ``It's not all that different from the salary they were
making,'' she said.
   Starting flight attendants at Continental make about $14,000 a
year, with increases to $24,000 after six years on the job. Other
major airlines offer similar starting salaries, but with higher
salaries in the upper scales.
   Under federal law, Continental was obligated to rehire the
striking workers before bringing any new flight attendants on board.
   Officials said some of the 220 striking workers have left for
other jobs, but about 160 will start retraining in Houston next
week.
   The rehired workers all will be flying out of Continental's hub
in Newark, N.J.
   Continental officials also said the rehired attendants can
request transfers when they start work again.
   Art Kent, a spokesman in Houston for Continental, said some of
the striking attendants took early retirement or were fired for
reasons not related to the strike shortly after the walkout. He
said the airline has identified 220 that took part in the strike.
   ``A total of 162 are left of that 220. It appears all of them
are accepting'' to be rehired, he said.

<TEXT>
   Philip Morris Cos. reportedly plans to
offer credit card holders home delivery of its Cartier Vendome
cigarettes early next year, but officials of the tobacco giant
declined to confirm the report Wednesday.
   ``We didn't contribute to the story'' in the Wall Street
Journal, Philip Morris spokesman Steven H. Weiss said. ``We weren't
talking about it, and that still holds true.''
   Marketing consultants say the New York-based company is counting
on the technique to give its Cartier Vendome brand of cigarettes an
added air of exclusivity, the newspaper reported Wednesday.
   The approach would also give the tobacco company a list of
tobacco users, marketing experts noted.
   The company introduced the pearl-tipped cigarettes on Oct. 11 in
Los Angeles, Weiss said. Prior to that, the brand was available
only in Europe.
   The market for luxury tobacco comprises less than 1 percent of
total cigarette sales in the United States.
   Cartier Vendome cigarettes, packed in oval boxes bearing the
House of Cartier's logo, cost about twice as much as an average
pack of cigarettes, Weiss said.
   ``We think there is a market out there,'' he said. ``There are
discerning smokers who want a cigarette that has the appearance,
refined taste and distinction that says Cartier.''
   The cigarette is manufactured by Philip Morris but is
distributed by Cartier through upscale hotels, restaurants and
tobacco shops.
   Some direct-marketing experts say Philip Morris may find
barriers to selling mail-order cigarettes across state lines.
   Several states are requiring direct-mailers to charge their
customers state sales tax.

   Dunkin' Donuts Inc. said Wednesday that
its new owner plans to seek buyers for the 12 Chili's restaurants
owned by a Dunkin' Donuts subsidiary.
   Allied-Lyons PLC, a major British food and beverage group,
agreed last Friday to buy Dunkin' Donuts for $325 million in cash.
   Dunkin' Donuts spokesman Richard Hart said Allied-Lyons will try
to sell Dunkin' Ventures, a subsidiary that operates the Chili's
restaurants. Hart said Allied-Lyons has no intentions of selling
Dunkin' Donuts Inc.
   Dunkin' Donuts fought off a hostile takeover earlier this year
by DD Acquisition Corp., a Canadian partnership. In December,
Dunkin' Donuts decided to accept bids on a friendly basis.
   London-based Allied-Lyons agreed to pay $47.25 a share for all
outstanding shares of Dunkin' Donuts common stock.
   Dunkin' Donuts has 1,600 U.S. outlets and 250 abroad.

   Gold prices rallied again on Wednesday, topping
$410 an ounce. The dollar drifted mostly lower in sluggish
pre-holiday trading.
   Enthusiastic buyers continued to snap up gold bullion after the
metal passed the psychologically significant price of $400 an ounce
on Tuesday.
   On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold for current delivery
surged $7.30 to $411.00 a troy ounce. The Republic National Bank
quoted a troy ounce of gold bullion at $410 as of 4 p.m. EST, $6.50
higher than Tuesday's late bid.
   In earlier overseas trading, gold was bid late in London at
$409.75 an ounce, up from $402.75 bid late Tuesday. The late bid
price in Zurich soared to $409.00 from $399.00 bid late Tuesday.
Hong Kong gold prices rose $8.28 to close at a bid of $406.89.
   Silver turned in a mixed performance, posting sharp gains abroad
before steadying in the United States.
   The metal rose to a late bid price of $5.83 a troy ounce in
London, up from $5.71 bid late Tuesday. Silver gave up a portion of
Tuesday's 14.6-cent gain in New York. On New York's Comex, silver
for current delivery settled at $5.800 a troy ounce compared to
$5.834 on Tuesday.
   The dollar ended lower against most major currencies in choppy
European and U.S. trading as traders remained preoccupied with the
West German mark.
   Trading activity was described as subdued. West German markets
were closed for the day; U.S. and Japanese markets were winding
down for Thanksgiving holidays on Thursday.
   Currency dealers are bullish toward the mark because they are
betting West Germany might have to raise interest rates to keep its
economy from over heating. It is widely believed that West German
growth will accelerate as East Germans continue to pour into the
country.
   Higher West German interest rates would raise returns on
mark-denominated investments and spur demand for marks.
   The dollar was quoted at 1.81275 marks late in New York, down
from 1.81375 on Tuesday. Earlier, in London, the dollar changed
hands at 1.8095 marks, down from 1.8200 marks late Tuesday in
London.
   In Tokyo, the dollar fell 0.55 Japanese yen to a closing 143.88
yen. Later in London, it fell to 143.50 yen and in New York, it
declined to 143.10 yen, down from 143.555 late Tuesday.
   In London, the British pound rose to $1.5655 from $1.5645 late
Tuesday. One pound cost $1.56775 in New York, less expensive for
buyers than $1.56975 on Tuesday.
   Other late dollar rates in New York compared with Tuesday's late
quotes included: 1.6110 Swiss francs, down from 1.6130; 6.1835
French francs, up from 6.1775; 1,337.00 Italian lire, up from
1,336.00; and 1.16875 Canadian dollars, down from 1.16995.
   Selected dollar rates in Europe, compared with late Tuesday's
rates, were: 1.6100 Swiss francs, down from 1.6200; 6.1710 French
francs, down from 6.2000; 2.0418 Dutch guilders, down from 2.0537;
1,337.50 Italian lire, down from 1,341.00; 1.1695 Canadian dollars,
down from 1.1705.

<TEXT>
   Gold prices surged for the fourth straight day Wednesday on New
York's Commodity Exchange, where a late flurry of investment buying
pushed the market to within easy range of a new high for this year.
   Despite some profit-taking earlier in the session and a downturn
in silver prices, which normally moves in tandem with gold,
analysts said the gold market's 5-week-old rally showed no sign of
slackening.
   ``We're only now starting to reach a new leg of bullish
enthusiasm,'' said Fred Demler, metals economist with Drexel
Burnham Lambert Inc. in New York.
   On other commodity markets Wednesday, livestock and meat futures
rose; cocoa futures sank to new 14-year lows; energy futures were
mixed; and grains and soybeans were mixed.
   Gold settled $7.20 to $8.10 higher with the contract for
delivery in December at $411.60 a troy ounce and the lightly traded
spot contract at $411. It was the market's highest close since Jan.
3, the first trading day of 1989, when the near-month gold contract
finished at $413.40.
   Silver finished 3.2 cents to 3.8 cents lower with December at
$5.808 a troy ounce.
   About a third of gold's gains occurred in the final half-hour of
the session as traders who had earlier taken profits from the
market stormed back as buyers in anticipation of gains Thursday on
European markets, although U.S. markets will be closed for
Thanksgiving.
   ``I would want to be long given the recent history of this
market,'' said Bette Raptopoulos, a metals analyst with
Prudential-Bache Securities Inc. in New York.
   Investment demand for gold continues to increase as prices rise
and economic uncertainty chases investors from the stock and bond
markets, analysts said.
   Livestock and meat futures rallied on the Chicago Mercantile
Exchange in line with stronger cash markets.
   After the close, the Agriculture Department released a monthly
cold-storage report showing 40.2 million pounds of frozen pork
bellies in warehouses as of Oct. 31. The number was slightly higher
than expected and could prompt some selling of pork-belly futures
when trading resumes Friday.
   Live cattle futures settled .10 cent to .42 cent higher with
December at 76 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .15 cent to .30
cent higher with November at 83.45 cents a pound; hogs were
unchanged to .28 cent higher with December at 51.25 cents a pound;
frozen pork bellies were .20 cent to .60 cent higher with February
at 63.25 cents a pound.
   Cocoa futures prices sank to new 14-year lows on New York's
Coffee, Sugar &amp; Cocoa Exchange, reflecting the burdensome supplies
of cocoa on the market.
   Cocoa settled $19 to $23 lower with December at $918 per metric
ton.
   Energy futures finished mixed on the New York Mercantile
Exchange with heating oil up sharply following Tuesday's American
Petroleum Institute report of an unexpected drop of 3.14 million
barrels of U.S. distillate stocks last week.
   Forecasts for frigid weather this weekend in the Midwest and
Northeast also spurred buying of heating-oil contracts.
   West Texas Intermediate crude oil settled 7 cents to 14 cents
lower with January at $19.82 a barrel; heating oil was .14 cent to
1.15 cents higher with December at 61.09 cents a gallon; unleaded
gasoline was .29 cent lower to .10 cent higher with December at
51.73 cents a gallon.
   Soybean futures posted moderate gains on the Chicago Board of
Trade amid mildly bullish developments. Wheat futures declined
slightly while corn was little changed.
   Supportive factors in the soybean market included a dip in
farmer sales of soybeans before the Thanksgiving holiday; talk of
export interest from Spain, Japan and Indonesia; and a Census
Bureau report showing lower-than-expected U.S. stocks of soybean
oil at the end of October.
   Wheat settled 1 cent to 2\ cents lower with December at $4.07} a
bushel; corn was } cent lower to { cent higher with December at
$2.38{ a bushel; oats were 1\ cents to 1} cents higher with

   Heating oil futures surged Wednesday, helped by
cold weather in many parts of the country and bullish inventory
statistics.
   Crude oil and gasoline futures prices slipped.
   The December contract for No. 2 heating oil gained 1.15 cents a
gallon to finish at 61.09 cents a gallon on the New York Mercantile
Exchange. The contract for January delivery rose 0.94 cent to 60.52
a gallon and February advanced 0.54 cent to 58.90 cents a gallon.
   The American Petroleum Institute reported that heating oil
supplies dropped by 3.1 million barrels a day last week to 119.3
million barrels.
   ``The APIs were very bullish for heating oil,'' said Randall
Rothenberg, energy broker with Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. ``The cold
weather also helped.''
   Crude oil for January delivery fell 14 cents to close at $19.82
a barrel, while February lost 10 cents to $19.68 a barrel and March
closed down 8 cents at $19.50.
   Wholesale unleaded gasoline for December ended 0.23 cent lower
at 51.73 cents a gallon, January dipped 0.29 cents to 52.47 cents
and February finished at 53.13 cents, down 0.24 cent a gallon.
   Analysts said increases in crude oil and gasoline stocks helped
knock those futures prices down. The API report showed that crude
oil inventories rose 1.3 million barrels a day to 348.9 million
barrels last week, while total gasoline stocks rose 5.1 million
barrels to 223.5 million barrels.
   Analysts said that while the market is concerned about the
meeting of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries on
Saturday, participants are generally optimistic about the outcome
and are taking a wait-and-see posture.
   WTI prices have remained stable in the $19- to $20-a-barrel
range for the last several weeks.

<HEAD>GM Studying Large White-Collar Reduction</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By FREDERICK STANDISH</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>DETROIT (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   General Motors Corp. reportedly is considering
slashing its white-collar work force by up to 25 percent over the
next five years, cuts that would accelerate a five-year-old job
reduction effort.
   Like other major U.S. automakers, GM has been seeking to cut
costs in an effort to meet intensifying competition while dealing
with an industrywide downturn and slowing national economy.
   The nation's largest automaker had 103,410 salaried workers at
the end of last year, 21.8 percent less than its 132,279
white-collar workers five years earlier, according to GM figures.
   GM's hourly employment dropped 16.1 percent to 327,277 by the
end of last year from 390,133 at the end of 1983.
   On Wednesday, The Wall Street Journal reported it had obtained
an internal GM document saying the company was looking into
reducing its salaried work force by about 5,000 people annually
during the next four or five years.
   GM spokeswoman Patricia Malloy declined to confirm or deny that
such a study was going on or that such a memo existed.
   However, she said: ``Are we looking at a head count? We continue
to look at employment levels. As we head into the '90s, having the
right number of people with the right skills who are adding value
throughout the corporation is absolutely critical.''
   Since 1987, General Motors has been involved in what it calls
its ``Action Plan'' to cut costs throughout the corporation. In its
third-quarter earnings report, GM said it had cut costs by $11
billion and aimed to cut $12.5 billion to $13 billion by the end of
1990.
   The Journal said GM's top managers would meet Nov. 30 to review
the memo on cutting salaried jobs. Malloy said the management
committee meets monthly and that Nov. 30 is not a date for any
regularly scheduled meeting.
   She declined to say when the next meeting would take place.
   GM, Ford Motor Co. and Chrysler Corp. each have cost-cutting
programs under way, including cutbacks in the number of
white-collar workers.
   Chrysler's plan to slash $1 billion from its budget by the end
of next year, including an 8 percent reduction in its salaried work
force of about 28,000 employees, has attracted the most recent
attention.
   In 1983, Chrysler had about 26,500 salaried employees worldwide.
By the end of last year, after Chrysler had acquired American
Motors Corp., the salaried work force had risen to just more than
32,000.
   Ford spokesman Tom Foote said the nation's No. 2 automaker has
reduced its U.S. salaried work force by about 30 percent during the
last decade, mainly during the early 1980s.

   Texas Instruments Inc. stock continued to climb in
active trading Wednesday after the announcement that the company
was awarded an important patent in Japan.
   Industry analysts say Texas Instruments could reap hundreds of
millions of dollars in royalties per year from Japanese
computer-chip manufacturers because of the patent on integrated
circuits, which took 29 years to be approved.
   Texas Instruments officials declined to speculate on how much
the Dallas-based company might gain from the patent on integrated
circuits it developed in 1958. But Richard J. Agnich, a senior vice
president, said, ``The opportunity exists for Texas Instruments to
earn a significant ongoing stream of royalty income.''
   The stock jumped $4.75 a share to $36.50 on Wednesday on the New
York Stock Exchange after a gain of $2.25 a share Tuesday, giving
it a two-day gain of almost 24 percent.
   ``I have an aggressive `buy' recommendation of this stock,''
said Richard Whittington, semiconductor industry analyst for
Kidder, Peabody &amp; Co. in New York.
   That wasn't the feeling throughout the industry.
   ``It sounds good. It feels good, but we don't know how good,''
said Erik Jensen, a semiconductor analyst for Robertson, Stephen &amp;
Co. in San Francisco. ``I am not recommending the stock at this
point.''
   Jensen said he doesn't think earnings from the patent will
appear immediately and that all the benefits won't be in dollar
form.
   Analysts said the patent could aid Texas Instruments in
renegotiating licensing agreements for its products with Japanese
firms in 1990.
   As far as the news making Texas Instruments a takeover target,
Whittington said, ``It makes them a far more valuable investment
and that's all I'm willing to say.''
   Texas Instruments spokeswoman Terry West said the company has
programs in place to prevent a takeover.
   Texas Instruments knew about the patent Oct. 30, but didn't
announce it until Tuesday. Still, rumors from Japan arrived in time
for Texas Instruments stock to jump in late trading Tuesday on
heavy volume.
   According to Securities and Exchange Commission rules, a company
does not have to disclose every important development as it happens.
   Texas Instruments officials declined to say Wednesday whether
the SEC had questioned the company or criticized it for keeping the
information secret so long. SEC spokeswoman Mary McCue said the
agency had no comment.
   The NYSE requires listed companies to make full and timely
disclosure of all material corporate developments. NYSE spokesman
Richard Torrenzano would only say, ``We'll be looking into it.''
   Texas Instruments General Counsel Richard Agnich said the
company has discussed the importance of patents in general in
quarterly statements, including its most recent one on Oct. 20.
   ``We have said that we think we have ... opportunity because of
our patent portfolio,'' he said. ``We don't go talking patent by
patent, or the status of individual applications.''
   Ms. West said the company's financial reports and statements had
indicated the company was ``optimistic that we would get the
patent.''
   Texas Instruments' good fortune raised the possibility that
National Semiconductor Corp. of Santa Clara, Calif., might also
receive a Japanese patent, since it is the parent of another U.S.
company that once owned a basic U.S. patent on the integrated
circuit.
   Jack Kilby and Robert Noyce are regarded as co-inventors of the
integrated circuit. Noyce, then with Fairchild Semiconductor Corp.,
was awarded a U.S. patent in 1961. Kilby was awarded his patent in
1964. Both U.S. patents have now expired.
   Fairchild has since been acquired by National Semiconductor.
Mary Coady, a National spokeswoman, said the company was checking
on whether it had a patent application pending in Japan. She said
the company did not expect to know until next week.
   The integrated circuit is found in every computer and most
electronic devices and its invention helped Texas Instruments
become one of the world's first high-technology companies. But
Japan has become the world's largest producer of chips.
   The recently awarded Texas Instruments patent will last until
Nov. 27, 2001.
   ``Initially, we watched the integrated circuit spread around the
world with a great deal of pride ... and today there's some concern
... about the United States' competitiveness in the industry,''
said Kilby.
   ``That's a long story I'm not sure I fully understand,'' Kilby
said. ``Many of the American semiconductor manufacturers feel that
the Japanese used some unfair tactic ... I don't know that that's
really so.''
   But, regarding the lagging patent from Japan, Kilby said,
``That's a little peculiar ... Their process is a little slower
than ours, but 30 years is most unusual.''
   The delay actually makes the patent more valuable because
licensing fees will be much higher than they would have been in the
1960s, when integrated circuit production in Japan was much smaller.

   Media and entertainment giant Time Warner Inc.
said Wednesday it has agreed to sell textbook publisher Scott
Foresman and Co. for about $455 million and will take a $175
million pretax loss on the sale.
   It is Time Warner's first major sale of assets following Time
Inc.'s agreement this past summer to buy Warner Communications Inc.
for $14 billion.
   The buyer is Harper &amp; Row Publishers Inc., a subsidiary of
Rupert Murdoch's News Corp., and the deal puts Harper among the top
five educational publishers.
   Analysts said Scott Foresman has not performed as well as
expected since Time bought it for $520 million cash and $50 million
in assumed debt in October 1986. Time subsequently put the college
textbook division of another of its publishing companies, Little
Brown &amp; Co., under Scott Foresman.
   In the past two years, the costs of competing in the textbook
publishing business grew as publishers consolidated, promotional
costs climbed and school officials became more insistent on changes
in books to suit their areas.
   Rumors that Scott Foresman was for sale have circulated for more
than 18 months, predating Time's deal with Warner. The agreed sale
price includes $48 million in debt, the companies said.
   Time Warner refused to say how much Scott Foresman generated for
the company last year, but trade sources estimated revenue at about
$249 million.
   ``Scott Foresman is a stand-alone business unrelated to what
they do,'' said Peter Appert, media analyst for C.J. Lawrence
Morgan Grenfell.
   He said Time Warner would have had to invest considerable
amounts to keep Scott Foresman competitive and clearly did not want
to do that.
   Mary Kukowski, who follows Time Warner for Bear Stearns &amp; Co.,
said the sale was ``very positive'' for Time Warner despite the
pretax loss it will cause in the fourth quarter.
   ``It is positive to get it behind them and move on,'' she said.
   She said the accounting complications of combining Warner's
results with those of Time already have caused stock market
analysts to discount the company's financial results for the year
and are focusing on 1990 prospects.
   Time Warner said proceeds from the sale would help it reduce its
debt, but that its main reason for selling the Glenview, Ill.-based
textbook publisher was that Scott Foresman was outside its core
businesses. Those businesses are magazines, filmed entertainment,
records, cable and pay television and books marketed directly to
consumers through stores or book clubs.
   The transaction is expected to be completed by the end of the
year and is subject to regulatory filings.
   In trading on the New York Stock Exchange, Time Warner fell 37{
cents a share to $131.37{.
   Harper &amp; Row already has a college textbook division but sold
its elementary and high school textbook division five years ago.
   In the meantime, Harper &amp; Row was acquired by Australia-based
News Corp.
   George Craig, president of Harper &amp; Row, said the acquisition
``rounds out the Harper &amp; Row educational publishing program with a
premier name in that field.''
   According to the book industry newsletter BP Report, Scott
Foresman had $249 million in revenue in 1988, including $181
million from elementary and higher education and $68 million from
college textbook publishing.
   The acquisition will place Harper &amp; Row among the top five
publishers in both the school and college categories, according to
BP Report.
   The leaders are Harcourt Brace Jovanovich Inc., Paramount
Communications Inc.'s Simon &amp; Schuster unit, Macmillan-McGraw Hill
School Publishing Co. and Houghton Mifflin Co.
   Harper &amp; Row also publishes a range of general-interest books in
hardcover and paperback and has medical and religious book
divisions. It recently launched a new mass market paperback line of
books.

   An investment group that has purchased a small
Bahamian island plans to build an exclusive time-share resort for
members only.
   Marina operator Mark Soverel and his partners bought Spanish Cay
in the Abaco Island chain from a trustee for an undisclosed sum and
announced plans Tuesday for a $112 million resort to be reserved
for 1,775 members.
   The 183-acre island north of the Bahamian capital of Nassau had
been a hideaway for the late Dallas Cowboys owner Clint Murchison,
whose guests included George Bush before his oil business collapsed.
   ``I've sailed in many places in the world, but I have to say the
waters of the Bahamas are the most beautiful,'' Soverel said.
   For $35,000 up front and annual fees of $2,000, club members
will be welcome on the island 32 days a year. Developers will build
200 villas next to a marina, waterfront lots will be offered for
home construction and 100-foot slips will be available for 200
boats.
   The developers have been given a 10-year exemption from Bahamian
real estate taxes and will receive a 90 percent refund on duties
for construction materials, said Michelle Pindling, Soverel's
Bahamian attorney and daughter of Prime Minister Lynden Pindling.
   Soverel, a Palm Beach Gardens marina operator and sailboat
racer, has been joined in the venture by French businessman
Phillipe Berman, investment banker David Kelso and retired Xerox
chairman Peter McCullough.
   Governing board members include golfer Greg Norman and baseball
player Gary Carter, and the island's club will be managed by Club
Corp. of America, which operates prominent city clubs around the
world.

   After nine months of a bitter walkout, striking
Eastern Airlines pilots voted to end their strike.
   The Eastern pilots union voted at a meeting Wednesday in Reston,
Va., to abandon their picket lines the day after President Bush
vetoed legislation that would have set up a blue-ribbon
congressional commission to investigate the dispute.
   The participation of the pilots has been a crucial element of
the walkout begun by the airline's Machinists union, and later
joined by the pilots and Eastern flight attendants. The strike led
Eastern to file for bankruptcy-law protection.

than the imbalance the previous month, the Treasury Department said.
   While the flow of red ink was in line with expectations,
analysts said Wednesday it pointed up the huge task the government
is facing in trying to meet the deficit reduction targets called
for in the Gramm-Rudman law.

   An American Airlines pilot asked passengers
during a severe storm to vote on whether to divert the flight to a
New York state airport or turn back to Chicago, two passengers said
Wednesday, but federal aviation investigators said it was a simple
misunderstanding.
   American Airlines denied the pilot of Flight 492 to New York's
LaGuardia Airport had let passengers make such a decision last
Thursday.
   Muriel and Fred Sider, a suburban Northbrook couple aboard the
flight, insist that's what happened, but the Federal Aviation
Administration investigated Wednesday and concluded otherwise.
   ``Nobody did anything wrong,'' said FAA spokeswoman Kathleen
Bergen at regional headquarters in New York.
   ``He was not asking passengers whether they wanted to fly into a
storm _ that's a captain's decision,'' she said. ``He was asking
how many passengers needed ground transportation to LaGuardia.''
   ``The issue is closed,'' Bergen said. ``Nobody did anything
wrong.''
   ``We just felt that it was an unbelievable situation that
passengers would be polled as to where the flight was going to
go,'' said Mrs. Sider, who said she was among the minority who
wanted to turn back.
   The pilot went with the majority, who voted to continue the
trip, she said. Because of the storm, the plane landed 60 miles
away, at Stewart International Airport near Newburgh, N.Y.
   ``That's carrying democracy a touch too far. I don't want to be
involved in safety decisions,'' said Sider, a 64-year-old
advertising executive who wrote a letter complaining to American.
   The plane had a safe _ but ``very bumpy'' _ landing in a heavy
rainstorm, Mrs. Sider said. The couple learned later that severe
winds that same day collapsed a cafeteria wall at an elementary
school three miles from Stewart, killing seven students and
injuring 18.
   ``We knew before we left that weather conditions were bad on the
East Coast,'' said Mrs. Sider, a 61-year-old travel agent. ``They
kept us at O'Hare on the ground for about an hour before they
decided to go.''
   ``About an hour into the flight the pilot got on the loudspeaker
and said that LaGuardia was definitely closed in, but they could
get into Stewart Airport ... and wanted a vote as to how the
passengers felt,'' Mrs. Sider said.
   ``The stewardesses took a show of hands,'' she said.
   The pilot told passengers landing at Stewart would be safe.
   Other passengers ``laughed and said, `Hey, we're getting to vote
on it,''' Sider said.
   But American spokesman Tom Stack said passengers were not asked
to make any decisions about where the plane would go. The decision
to land at Stewart was made by airline officials at headquarters in
Dallas, he said.
   ``There was never any question raised to the passengers about
the diversion,'' he said.
   Once the plane landed at Stewart, passengers were asked to
decide whether they wanted to be bused into New York City or take a
return flight back to Chicago, Stack said. They were given the
option because the airline figured many of the businesspeople on
board had missed meetings and would want to return, Stack said.
   The pilot, whom Stack would not identify, ``did what he was
supposed to do and handled himself in a professional manner,'' the
spokesman said.
   The plane carried a cockpit crew of three and 62 passengers,
Stack said, but he would not release a passenger list.
   Kathleen Bergen, a spokeswoman at the FAA's eastern region
headquarters in New York, said the agency is investigating. She had
no further comment.
   The head of a Washington, D.C.-based group that lobbies for
passengers' rights said he'd never heard of such a case before.
   ``They're paying the pilot to make those kinds of decisions,''
said Chris Witkowski, director of the Aviation Consumer Action
Project. ``I don't know if it's advisable to place that
responsibility on the passengers.''
   The Siders say they're certain other passengers would back up
their version of events.
   ``I understand instructions when I hear them, and my wife's been
a travel agent for 20 years,'' Sider said. ``I don't think we both
could have misunderstood it.''

   After nine months of a bitter walkout, striking
Eastern Airlines pilots voted late Wednesday to end their strike.
   The participation of the pilots has been a crucial element of
the walkout begun by the airline's Machinist union members, and
later joined by the pilots and Eastern flight attendants.
   The Eastern pilots union voted at a meeting in Reston, Va., to
abandon their picket lines the day after President Bush vetoed
legislation that would set up a blue-ribbon commission to
investigate the dispute.
   In his veto message, Bush said Congress, which would have
conducted the investigation, had no business interfering in the
contract and court disputes over the strike.
   A statement released by the Air Line Pilots Association said the
pilots voted to call off their strike in sympathy with the
Machinists and return to work. But Eastern officials have replaced
many of the 2,250 striking pilots with non-union fliers and have
said there would be few if any jobs for the strikers to return to.
   ``It's a very interesting development,'' Miami-based Eastern
said in a statement. ``Our only regret is that it didn't come
earlier and we could have avoided all the trauma that has come to
Eastern Airlines.''
   There currently are no openings for pilots at the airline, which
now has about 1,800 fliers, the company said. But it indicated
there could be slots in the future, which would be filled in the
order in which pilots returned to work _ except in cases where
pilots with experience on specific types of aircraft are needed.
   Eastern said striking pilots ``will be recalled as jobs come
open in the future'' and invited them to sign the recall list.
   ``The strike continues for us,'' John Peterpaul, vice president
of the International Association of Machinists, said in a telephone
interview late Wednesday. ``What they (the pilots) do is their
affair. ... We're not calling this thing off.''
   Peterpaul said there is a fairly good chance that Congress will
be able to override the president's veto. That action, which
congressional sponsors of the measure have promised, can't come
until Congress reconvenes in two months.
   Technically, under the Railway Labor Act, which governs airlines
contract disputes, only the Machinists are on strike. The pilots
and flight attendants have been honoring Machinist picket lines in
legal sympathy strikes.
   There were only about 2,250 Eastern pilots on strike as of
Wednesday, according to ALPA, down from 3,600 when the strike began
on March 4.
   The pilots had been the linchpin of the strike, surprising
management when they joined Eastern's Machinists in a sympathy
walkout. The pilots, who are more difficult to replace, wielded far
more economic clout than the Machinists and flight attendants they
joined on the picket lines. That made the strike far more
threatening.
   Back in March, the decision of the pilots _ the elite among
union members _ to join the working-class Machinists strike dealt
the crushing blow to Eastern, which already was suffering from
financial losses and longtime labor-management tensions.
   Frank Lorenzo, chairman of Eastern's parent Texas Air Corp., put
Eastern under Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection on March 9, five
days after the strike began. Since then, Lorenzo and his management
team have been hiring replacement workers and rebuilding Eastern as
a smaller carrier.
   ``They've got all the pilots they need,'' Paul Karos, an airline
analyst at First Boston Corp., said Wednesday. ``The strike has
been mainly symbolic.''
   ``Pilot power'' was a key element in the early months of the
walkout, as the national pilots union threatened countrywide job
actions in solidarity with the Eastern fliers and the pilots'
attorneys argued forcefully against the company in federal
bankruptcy court.
   The strength of the pilots' ranks eroded, however, as the
grueling strike wore on.
   The crucial turning point came in August, when Eastern pilots
voted by a wide margin to continue the strike but several hundred
fliers crossed picket lines and returned to work.
   As the pilots still on strike increasingly were stripped to the
radical core of the group, their leadership was changed. Jack
Bavis, chairman of the Eastern pilots' executive council, was
recalled by union leaders and replaced by Skip Copeland, a 27-year
Eastern veteran considered a hard-liner on the strike and far less
conciliatory than Bavis.
   ``The strike has, for all intents and purposes, been over,''
said Louis Marckesano, an analyst with Janney Montgomery Scott Inc.
in Philadelphia. ``It doesn't have much purpose anymore.''

<HEAD>Company, 2 Officials Sentenced in Fraud Case Involving Shuttle Parts</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ORLANDO, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>

   An aerospace manufacturing company has been
fined $340,000 and two of its top officials sentenced to prison for
manufacturing and supplying defective fasteners used on the rocket
boosters of NASA's space shuttles, officials said Wednesday.
   Lee Aerospace Products Inc., company President Darrell Lee and
Vice President Jerry Martin were convicted Sept. 22 in U.S.
District Court on multiple counts of mail fraud and submitting
false statements to NASA, according to a statement from U.S.
Attorney Robert W. Genzman.
   NASA used the defective fasteners on its manned space shuttle
missions for more than four years, from August 1983 to September
1987, the statement said.
   On Jan. 28, 1986, the space shuttle Challenger exploded shortly
after liftoff, killing all seven crew members. Later tests laid the
blame for the tragedy on the O-rings in the joints between the
booster segments, not to any fasteners.
   Lee Aerospace and Lee were convicted on 14 counts of mail fraud
and 20 counts of providing or causing to be provided false
statements to an agency of the United States, Genzman said.
   The company, based in Chatsworth, Calif., was fined $10,000 on
each of the 34 counts.
   Lee, 47, who was described as a California resident, was
sentenced to four years and 70 days in prison and fined $50,000.
   Martin, 43, was convicted on 12 counts of mail fraud and 17
counts of submitting false statements. The company's former
production manager was sentenced to 19 months in prison and fined
$7,000.
   Bolts, screws and other fasteners manufactured by Lee Aerospace
have been distributed for use in commercial aircraft and military
hardware, as well as the space shuttle program.
   The government alleged the company and its two officers
``defrauded and caused USBI Booster Production Co. to make false
statements to NASA in the sale of substandard fasteners by falsely
certifying that the fasteners had been manufactured and tested in
accordance with all applicable specifications _ when in truth and
in fact they had not.''
   NASA on Wednesday expressed satisfaction with the sentences.
   ``We cannot legislate ethics and integrity,'' said William D.
Hager, NASA's assistant inspector general. ``But today we have
succeeded in raising the stakes in the fight against white-collar
crime.''

   Boeing Co. production workers returned to their
jobs Wednesday after a 48-day strike, but opertions weren't
expected to be back to normal until after New Year's, company
officials said.
   Boeing spokesman Paul Binder said 50 percent to 55 percent of
the work force returned on the first two shifts, with a 60 percent
to 65 percent return projected by the end of the day following the
strike by the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace
Workers.
   No problems or incidents were reported, and the number of
workers on the job will be ``close to normal, I would imagine, by
Monday,'' Binder said.
   Wednesday was devoted almost exclusively to crew meetings and
development of back-to-work plans.
   At the factory that makes 747 and 767 jetliners in Everett,
where strikers ``tended to be a little more visible and vocal''
than elsewhere, company officials who sat in on a few meetings
found ``everybody was in a good mood, pretty upbeat,'' said Jack
Gamble of Boeing Commercial Airplanes.
   Workers entering the complex in Renton, where the smaller 737s
and 757s are made, expressed mixed feelings about the new contract
but relief to be earning money again.
   ``It's nice to go back. If it were another time of year it would
be different. ... We might have stayed out longer,'' said Tracy
Dorning, 28, an electrical inspector at Renton.
   Many said they would be willing to work overtime voluntarily as
the company scrambles to catch up with an enormous backlog of
orders. But they were glad mandatory overtime had been reduced.
   ``They can ask me and I'll be here,'' said Carol Whitson, 36, a
wire shop worker, ``but you can't work people to death. I'm glad
the restrictions are there.''
   At Boeing Military Airplanes in Wichita, Kan., machinist Bart
Harris said he was ready for work but would have remained on the
picket line had the contract vote gone the other way.
   ``You've just got to put your feelings aside and do it,'' he
said. ``It could have been much better, but the majority rules.''
   The union represents 57,800 workers, including 43,300 in the
Seattle area, 12,000 in Wichita, 1,700 in Portland, Ore., and a few
hundred at scattered sites in California, Hawaii, Montana, Utah,
Wyoming, North Dakota and other states.
   Although Boeing is the biggest employer in the Puget Sound area,
``the strike was a relatively small economic event'' in the region,
said Richard Conway, a Seattle economic consultant.
   Major retailers and Boeing subcontractors reported relatively
small declines in business, partly because many workers had been
working so much overtime before the strike and many subcontractors
were behind in deliveries, Conway said.
   Boeing, the world's largest commercial airplane maker, was
producing 29 airplanes a month before the walkout. During the
strike, supervisors and non-striking personnel delivered 24 planes,
all of which were virtually complete before the walkout.
   Getting production back on schedule will take until ``probably
sometime after the first of the year if everything goes well,''
Gamble said.
   Boeing shuts down almost completely for the four-day
Thanksgiving holiday weekend and for the week between Christmas and
New Year's Day.
   Gamble said it would take two weeks to get just the commercial
airplane production force reorganized and reassigned, tools
recalibrated and work positions realigned.
   Most workers arriving Wednesday were able to collect a $500
advance on the annual bonus to be paid Dec. 8 under the new pact.
