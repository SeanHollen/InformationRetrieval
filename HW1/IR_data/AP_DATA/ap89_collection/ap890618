   An 11-year-old American pilot who hopes to
become the youngest person to fly around the world landed his small
Cessna 210 Centurion Sunday after flying across the icy North
Atlantic.
   ``It was like flying over a big lake,'' said Tony Aliengena after
the nearly six-hour flight over the often storm-swept 1,100 miles of
ocean, probably the longest, most treacherous leg of the flight.
   Tony landed his single-engine turboprop Cessna in Oslo late
Sunday, about 10 minutes after an escort plane carrying his mother,
sister and Soviet and American journalists.
   The boy and his family planned to rest and sightsee in Norway's
capital city before flying to Sweden on Monday on a trip dubbed
Friendship Flight 89.
   Tony, from San Juan Capistrano, Calif., is carrying letters from
American schoolchildren to Soviet schoolchildren and an 800-foot
``friendship scroll'' signed by 200,000 American youngsters. He
plans to present the scroll to President Mikhail S. Gorbachev when
he reaches Moscow.
   Tony set out June 5 from John Wayne Airport at Costa Mesa,
Calif., on the 19,000-mile trip dubbed Friendship Flight '89.

<HEAD>Canadian Court Rules Satiacum Is Not A Political Refugee</HEAD>
<DATELINE>VANCOUVER, British Columbia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Canadian court has ruled
that a former Puyallup tribal leader convicted of racketeering in
the United States is not a political refugee under Canadian law.
   The unanimous ruling by the Canadian Federal Court of Appeals
could lead to Robert Satiacum's deportation to the United States,
the Morning News Tribune of Tacoma reported in Sunday's editions.
   The court held that Canada's immigration appeals board
incorrectly granted Satiacum's request to become Canada's first
political refugee from the United States.
   The immigration board had agreed with Satiacum's claim that he
was in danger of persecution and death if he returned to America.
However, that decision was appealed by the Canadian Department of
Education and Immigration, which said Satiacum sought refuge in
Canada to escape a prison term in the United States.
   The case will return to the immigration appeals board, but that
board is precluded from deciding in Satiacum's favor a second time.
   Once the board rules again, Satiacum's case will return to a
hearing to decide whether he will be deported to the United States.
   Satiacum, a resident of Tacoma, Wash., went to Canada following
conviction on 46 counts of racketeering in November 1982. After he
fled, Satiacum was convicted of 24 counts of embezzlement. He was
not sentenced in either case.
   Satiacum, meanwhile, faces criminal charges in British Columbia
that could jeopardize his efforts to win a permanent home in Canada.
   He is to go on trial Nov. 6 on charges that he molested a young
girl. Under Canadian law, a conviction on the charge _ which carries
a 10-year prison sentence _ would give the immigration minister the
right to deport him without a hearing.
   Neither Satiacum nor his lawyer, David Gibbons, could be reached
for comment Friday.

   The Pigeon River runs clean and clear for a
few miles downstream from its source. But as it snakes through the
mountains of western North Carolina the stream becomes a foaming,
stinking sewer that looks like root beer, smells like rotten eggs
and carries a dose of deadly dioxin.
   The river's tragic transformation takes place in this little mill
town of 4,700 residents.
   It was here, 20 miles west of Asheville, that the Champion
International Corp. built a paper products plant in 1908. Since
then, Champion's mill has dumped countless millions of gallons of
dark, poisonous wastewater into the Pigeon River.
   For those eight decades, people downstream in Tennessee have
complained time and time again, to little avail.
   If the Tennesseans fear for their health, upriver in North
Carolina the fear is for 2,000 mill jobs. Now, folks on both sides
of the state line are waiting anxiously as the river's fate is about
to be decided by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency.
   ``It's the classic confrontation between jobs and environmental
concerns,'' says John Marlar, the EPA official in Atlanta who must
make the initial recommendation. It could come within 30 days.
   ``We have received more than 180,000 letters on this matter,'' he
said. ``It has been a unique case in that there are two states
involved and that they have been unable to reach an accommodation
with each other. And, it's very, very rare when we have to step in
and take over a state's responsibility to monitor water quality, the
way we've had to do in North Carolina.''
   The Canton plant, which makes envelope paper and milk cartons,
has enormous political clout on its side of the border. It is the
biggest employer in the western end of the state, with a payroll of
2,000 workers.
   ``Champion has been operating since 1981 without a valid federal
wastewater discharge permit,'' Marlar said. ``In 1984 the state of
North Carolina issued them a permit, over our objections, and that's
when we got involved.''
   People along the river have complained for decades that
Champion's steaming hot, dark-stained and foul-smelling effluent was
wiping out most of the aquatic life for 60 miles downstream, making
the river unfit for recreation or use as a water supply.
   Then, in 1987, the federally sponsored National Dioxin Study
revealed that the bleaching process used to make milk cartons also
creates chloroform and dioxin, one of the deadliest poisons.
   ``That changed everything,'' Marlar said.
   It also created a furor along the Tennessee border, 37 miles
downstream from Canton. The news was especially disturbing in
Hartford, a riverside hamlet two miles from the state line.
   The community, known locally as ``Widowsville,'' has had a rash
of cancer deaths over the past 20 years.
   ``We're convinced there's a correlation between these deaths and
the river,'' says Charles Lewis Moore, the chief administrative
officer of Cocke County, Tenn.
   He added, ``The EPA has recommended that the river be posted to
prevent people from eating the few bottom feeders _ catfish and
suckers, mostly _ that can survive in that muck and mire. But what
about the people who have lived beside it for all these years?''
   Joe Hall is one of those people. The 50-year-old Hall, who
operates a grocery and restaurant at Hartford, said he can't
remember when the river wasn't black and stinking.
   ``When we were kids we used to have to hold our noses to keep
from smelling it when we walked back and forth from school,'' he
said.
   At Newport, 10 miles further downstream, local people formed the
``Dead Pigeon River Council'' to fight for a clean river. Fran
Ketterman, one of the founders, had little good to say about either
the EPA or Champion.
   ``Champion could clean up the river if it really wanted to. Also,
we didn't even learn about the dioxin from the EPA. It was
Greenpeace that tipped us off,'' she said.
   Fish taken from the river have shown high dioxin levels, she
said. ``You should see those fish; their bodies are covered with
huge abscesses and tumors, their fins are backwards and their eyes
are missing.''
   The Pigeon River flows through the center of Newport but the
city's 8,500 residents pipe in their drinking water from the French
Broad, six miles away.
   Cocke County loses more than $7 million a year in potential
development and tourism dollars because of the river's pollution,
according to studies quoted by Moore.
   ``We're counting on the EPA to clean up this mess,'' he said.
   Oliver Blackwell, the manager of Champion's Canton plant, says
there is no hard evidence to bear out allegations about increased
incidence of cancer in Cocke County.
   However, he quickly adds: ``I know the people in Tennessee are
very upset and concerned. We haven't done a good job keeping them
informed of all of our many past efforts to clean up our discharge,
but we're working on it and I ask them to be patient and to trust
us.''
   The Tennesseans laugh when told that Blackwell wants their trust.
   They say Champion was using economic blackmail when it threatened
to close its Canton plant in late December, after Tennessee
authorities refused the company's proposal to substantially reduce
the color in its discharges. The dark color prevents sunlight from
filtering through and sustaining aquatic life.
   Tennessee's refusal was influenced by Gov. Ned McWherter's canoe
trip down the Pigeon River last fall. After spending time on the
river, and after learning that Champion International, the nation's
fifth-largest paper maker, had realized $1.24 billion in profits
over the past 10 years, McWherter declared Tennessee was being
abused by North Carolina.
   Tennessee's refusal to accede on the water color issue _ and the
company's subsequent threat to close the plant _ sent the people of
Canton into a frenzy of fear and anger against the people downstream.
   ``We've been wronged by a neighbor,'' complained North Carolina
Gov. Jim Martin.
   Things got so heated at one point that a North Carolina
legislator proposed that all shipments of Tennessee's strong, brown
liquid _ Jack Daniel's whiskey _ be stopped at the border. Cooler
heads prevailed.
   ``I regret all those angry charges and boycott threats,'' says
Blackwell. ``It's just that the technology currently doesn't exist
to completely clean up our discharge.''
   If ordered to clean up its act completely, he says, the plant
would have to close, thus throwing 2,000 people out of work. Stamey,
Canton's city manager, shudders at the prospect of losing the $90
million worth of annual wages and benefits generated by Champion.
   ``We've got our fingers crossed, waiting to see what the EPA will
do about Champion's water permit,'' Stamey said. ``We really can't
make any plans for the future until we know the outcome.''
   On March 29, the EPA issued a preliminary draft of a compromise
plan that would give Champion three years to install the technology
needed to significantly reduce the color content and toxicity of its
discharge.
   The EPA's Marlar said he thinks Champion should be required to
immediately begin reducing the amount of dioxin released into the
river, but the exact formula has not been worked out.

   Two years ago, the EPA tested a trout from the river and it had a
dioxin level of 90 parts per trillion, more than three times higher
than the consumption cutoff level recommended by the government.
Sludge taken from the river has tested as high as 260 parts per
trillion.
   ``If, after three years the company has met all of our
requirements, we will issue them a discharge release permit,''
Marlar said. ``Meanwhile, as long as they continue to operate
without a permit they are leaving themselves liable to possible
legal actions.''
   Blackwell estimated the compromise proposal would mean a 50
percent reduction of the mill's workforce over the next few years.
He said it will cost Champion about $300 million to install the
necessary technology.
   ``But,'' he added, ``it will allow us to remain in operation. So
we can live with this compromise if we have to.''
   Whether the people downstream can accept the three-year plan is
another matter.
   ``Something should be done, right away,'' Joe Hall said. ``It's
wrong to let a company destroy a beautiful river simply in the name
of profits.''

<HEAD>Report: Former Regional HUD Director Works at HUD Contractor</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: Embargoed until 5 a.m.; time set by source</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The former regional director of the Department of
Housing and Urban Development received a $125,000-a-year job from
businessmen who shared in a $17 million profit from a government
contract the official helped to award, New York Newsday reported in
its Sunday editions.
   Joseph Monticciolo left his government job early in 1988 to
become board chairman and chief executive of the Eagle Capital
Group, an investment group headed by developer Sheldon Goldstein.
   Also Sunday, The New York Times reported that more than half the
money New York state received from a special discretionary HUD fund
went to projects pushed by Sen. Alfonse D'Amato.
   Newsday reported that most members of the Eagle group also were
involved in an investment group headed by Goldstein that made a
large profit on at least one deal.
   Goldstein is a prominent financial supporter of Gov. Mario Cuomo
and D'Amato.
   The investment group bought seven housing projects from HUD in
1983 for $10.9 million after putting up only $550,000 in cash. Three
years later, the group sold the projects for an estimated $17
million profit, the paper said.
   While Monticciolo was regional director, several other HUD
management contracts were awarded to Goldstein firms, the newspaper
said.
   The Eagle Capital Group was formed late in 1987, one month before
Monticciolo left HUD. He receives $125,000 a year to direct the
firm. He also has received a 15 percent share of the group at almost
no cost. Other partners invested a total of $1 million in the firm.
   Newsday reported that both Eagle and Monticciolo are being
investigated by Congress as part of a growing probe by Congress into
political favoritism at HUD during the Reagan administration.
   Neither Monticciolo nor Goldstein would comment on the story, the
newspaper said.
   A spokesman for Eagle said Monticciolo had not favored Goldstein
while at HUD and had done nothing wrong in the housing projects deal.
   Meanwhile, the Times reported that almost a third of the nearly
$38 million in a HUD discretionary fund went to projects in New York
state between 1981 and 1988. The funds were at the department
secretary's disposal.
   More than half of the $12 million the state got went to projects
supported by D'Amato, the Times said.
   None of the projects is known to be part of the federal
investigation into HUD, the paper said.
   A swimming pool for Island Park, D'Amato's hometown, has been
criticized as an unnecessary HUD-financed project. But the Times
said most of the projects pushed by D'Amato appeared to be
legitimate.

   Two people on fire crawled out of an
underground utility switching vault and a third had to be carried
out after an explosion that knocked out power in much of downtown
Omaha Saturday night, witnesses said.
   One of the victims, a female worker for the Omaha Public Power
District, yelled ``Help me. Help me. I'm on fire,'' said Kari
Eckert, a security guard for the telephone company, who was one of
the first people on the scene.
   ``I turned around and I almost got sick,'' Ms. Eckert said. ``I
was scared to death.''
   Two of the victims got out of the vault and were in an alley and
the third had to be carried out, she said.
   Dan Shields used his coat to try to beat flames off one of two
men who were injured. ``Their clothes were burnt completely off. It
was sickening,'' he said.
   The three victims were utility employees, said Omaha Police Sgt.
Robert Frock. He said the explosion's cause was not immediately
known.
   The crew was working on a project for the phone company,
replacing a switching unit, said Jim Brader, a US West
Communications spokesman. He said he did not know how much
electricity was running through the lines at the time of the
explosion.
   A man and a woman were taken to St. Joseph's Hospital, where they
were in critical condition, with second- and third-degree burns over
80 percent of their bodies, Frock said.
   Another man was taken to the University of Nebraska Medical
Center, where he was listed in critical conditon. He was to be
transferred to a burn unit at a hospital in Lincoln, the medical
center said.
   The explosion knocked out seven electrical circuits in the
downtown area, said Mark Gautier Jr., an Omaha Public Power District
spokesman. The power was expected to remain off until early Sunday.
   Some minor traffic accidents were reported in downtown Omaha
because several traffic lights were out.

   An East German jet carrying 113 people slammed onto
a runway, veered into a field, and burst into flames Saturday after
an aborted takeoff, killing at least 17 people, officials said.
   Forty-seven people were injured, 13 seriously, East German
Transport Minister Otto Arndt said earlier. However, the state-run
news agency ADN said two of the injured died overnight.
   One of the dead was a farmer working in the field, ADN had quoted
Arndt as saying.
   The Moscow-bound jet, carrying 103 passengers and a crew of 10,
was racing down the runway of East Berlin's Schoenefeld Airport and
had lifted off slightly when the pilot decided to abort the takeoff,
ADN said.
   It was not immediately known why he aborted takeoff.
   The Soviet-built Ilyushin II-62 slammed to the ground, careened
through runway barriers, veered into a field, then burst into flames
and broke apart, the news reports said.
   ``I felt an impact, and then the plane jolted. Suddenly the plane
stopped and I saw flames,'' East German television quoted an
unidentified passenger as saying.
   Passengers jumped from sections where the fuselage was torn open
or slid down emergency chutes, ADN said.
   Rescue workers found several bodies in an overnight search of the
smoldering wreckage of the jet, owned by the state-run Interflug
airline, ADN said. It did not say in its latest reports if more
people were missing.
   Most passengers were East Germans, according to ADN. The plane
also carried 11 Soviet passengers, two from Poland, one from Italy
and one from Nepal, the news agency said.
   About 700 firefighters, police and other officials rushed to the
scene to put out the fire and aid rescue efforts.
   A pilot, who was not identified, helped passengers out of the
burning aircraft even though he himself was injured, ADN said.
   A newscast on East German television showed the airplane's
smoldering wreckage resting in a field, its nose sheered off and
pieces of metal scattered around.
   ``There was a jolt, and then everything was dark. My husband and
I felt our way out through the smoke to an exit,'' the news agency
quoted Elke Fuchs, an East German woman injured in the accident, as
saying.
   Diethart Guenther, a safety expert with the Interflug airline,
said the aircraft was ``torn apart and completely burned out'' in
the accident, ADN said.
   Arndt said the country's fleet of Ilyushin-62 aircraft would be
grounded for safety inspections.
   ADN said a high-level government commission was directing the
rescue operation and would also conduct an investigation.
   The last serious accident with a jetliner at Schoenefeld Airport
was on Dec. 12, 1986, when an Aeroflot Tupolev 134 crashed into a
wooded area as it prepared to land, killing 80 people.
   Investigators later said the cause of the accident was a
misunderstanding between the pilot and airport control tower.

   Poles voted again Sunday as the
Solidarity-led opposition tried to capture the few open
parliamentary seats it did not clinch in the first round of the
freest elections in Eastern Europe in four decades.
   The communist party hoped to soften the stunning rebuff of the
June 4 voting. The independent Solidarity union won 252 of the 261
seats open to it in the new National Assembly.
   The turnout of the 27 million eligible voters remained a big
question for Sunday's second round. Many said they made their views
clear in the first round and turned their attention back to the
economic difficulties of daily life in Poland.
   All but nine of the 303 elections were being contested only by
communist candidates and their allies who failed to get first-round
majorities.
   However, Solidarity sought to bolster its power in the National
Assembly by endorsing the most reform-oriented party members in the
runoff.
   Eight seats remained undecided in the new, freely elected
100-member Senate, where Solidarity candidates took 92 places by
getting more than 50 percent of the vote on June 4.
   Solidarity also won 160 of the 161 seats open to independent
candidates in the 460-member Sejm, or parliament, during the first
round.
   Only three Sejm candidates from the communist party coalition _
reformers who had gained support from Solidarity activists in their
regions _ won first-round victories.
   In addition, 33 of the 35 top government officials on the
``national list'' of unopposed Sejm candidates did not receive the
required 50 percent of the votes cast, and they have been replaced
by 66 new candidates for the second round.
   The communists' best chance of winning a Senate seat was Henryk
Stoklosa, a rich fertilizer company owner from the western province
of Pila. He was the only coalition candidate to outpoll a Solidarity
opponent, although he did not get a majority.
   The elections are part of political and economic reforms
negotiated during two months of unprecedented talks between the
communist government and the opposition. The two sides also agreed
in April to make Solidarity legal again.

   An Afghan airliner crashed in Iran on
Sunday after gunmen tried to seize the plane and struggled with the
pilot, the official Iranian news agency said. Twenty-six people
reportedly survived the crash.
   The Soviet-built Antonov An-26 airliner went down near Zabol, a
city in eastern Iran close to the rugged Afghan border, the Islamic
Republic News Agency said. IRNA said initial reports indicate that
36 passengers were aboard the 40-seat, short-haul aircraft. The
civilian version of the plane, originally designed as a military
transport, normally carries a crew of five or six.
   The agency said it was not known how many casualties there were.
   The report, monitored in Nicosia, did not identify the gunmen,
say how many there were, or provide any other details on the
attempted hijacking.
   IRNA said the plane crashed at 12:30 p.m. and that Iranian rescue
teams were immediately ordered to the scene in Sistan-Baluchestan
province.
   The agency said Prime Minister Hussein Musavi sent his deputy
premier for political affairs, Alireza Moayyeri, to Zabol to
investigate the incident.
   It quoted Moayyeri as saying before he left Tehran, 700 miles
northwest of Zabol, that 26 people, including pilot Mirvis Paktia,
were dragged from the wreckage and hospitalized in Zabol. The
pilot's condition was not given.
   The news agency quoted several survivors as saying the aircraft
crashed after the pilot struggled with the unidentified hijackers.
``He lost control of the plane, and that led to its crash,'' the
agency said.
   It was not immediately known where the airliner was flying from
or its destination. But it was apparently on an internal Afghan
flight.
   Moayyeri declined further comment on the incident ``until the
matter has been fully investigated,'' IRNA reported.
   Iran supported the Moslem guerrillas who fought the Soviet army
in Afghanistan for nine years until it withdrew earlier this year.
Tehran continues to support the guerrillas' war against Kabul's
Marxist government.

   A gas explosion in a small coal mine in central
China killed 18 miners and injured one, the official Xinhua News
Agency reported Sunday.
   It said poor ventilation caused the blast Thursday in the Gutian
Coal Mine in Xianning City in Hubei province.
   The mine is owned by the local government, but a private
individual contracted to manage it in January, the report said. It
said the dead were local farmers employed by the contractor.
   More than 4,000 miners died in accidents in China in 1988, the
worst year for mine disasters in 40 years of communist rule.
   Most mines in China lack modern equipment and safety provisions.

   A rain-swollen river burst through an
embankment in eastern Bangladesh, sending rushing waters through 10
villages and leaving hundreds of people marooned on rooftops,
officials said Sunday.
   At least 600 people climbed on top of their homes to escape the
surging waters of the River Gumti, which tore a 100-foot-wide hole
in the embankment at Debidar village on Saturday, officials at the
Flood Forecasting Center said.
   The river, fed by incessant rains and a swollen Brahmaputra River
that feeds it, flooded Debidar and nine other villages in Comilla
district, 55 miles east of Dhaka, said an official, speaking on
condition of anonymity.
   He said more than 500 people had fled their homes in panic and
taken shelter in a school.
   Rescue workers were trying to close the breach and remove the
marooned people from the roofs, he said.
   The Flood Forecasting Center said other tributaries of the
Brahmaputra and Ganges, which crisscross Bangladesh, were steadily
rising. At least 10 areas in northern and eastern Bangladesh were
likely to be inundated by Monday if the rivers continued to rise,
the center said.
   The two rivers originate in neigboring India. The Brahmaputra
passes through the eastern Indian state of Assam before flowing
through Bangladesh into the Bay of Bengal.
   Officials in Bangladesh said the flood destroyed about 15,000
acres of paddy, the main food crop of the impoverished nation.
   Bangladesh, a low lying delta of 110 million people, alternates
between floods and drought. Two months ago, a drought destroyed
almost half the 5 million tons of paddy that was ready for harvest.
   Last year, three fourths of the country was inundated during
floods that killed at least 1,400 people and left 2.3 million
homeless.

   Nuclear power stations provided nearly 25 percent of
all the electricity produced during 1988 in the United States and 23
other developed, free-market countries, according to a report.
   During that year, the amount of electricity generated by nuclear
power in those 24 countries rose by 8.9 percent to 23.5 percent, the
report said.
   It said that figure will peak in 1990 at 23.8 percent before
decreasing gradually to 22.7 percent by 2000.
   The 24 countries belong to the Organization for Economic
Cooperation and Development, and the report was released Saturday by
its Nuclear Energy Agency.
   The report said nuclear power generated 19.5 percent of the
electricity in the United States in 1988, far less than the 70
percent in France, 66 percent in Belgium, 47 percent in Sweden, 37
percent in Switzerland, 36 percent in Finland and Spain, 34 percent
in West Germany and 27 percent in Japan.

   An environmental group is urging
President Corazon Aquino to declare June 21 ``Earth Rest Day'' as
part of a worldwide effort to protect the environment.
   Maximo Kalaw, president of Haribon Foundation, said in a letter
to Mrs. Aquino that such a day would ``awaken our hearts, minds and
spirits to the plight of our endangered planet.''
   A government report recently said illegal logging and
slash-and-burn farming are destroying forests in the Philippines.
The document said the country's forest cover, once 54 percent, has
been reduced to 25 percent, leading to severe soil erosion in some
areas.
   The report also said that 18 species of wildlife are now listed
as endangered in the Phillipines and that another 25 are on the
threatened list.
   The United Nations Environment Program is coordinating ``Earth
Rest Day.''

<TEXT>
   Iran's political moderates have filled the
power vacuum in the immediate aftermath of the death of Ayatollah
Ruhollah Khomeini.
   But his ghost is likely to haunt Iran for some time as its
leaders pick their way through the political mine field left by his
passing.
   Despite efforts by the Tehran hierarchy to head off any political
upheaval after Khomeini's death June 3, the moderates, or
pragmatists, still face a power struggle with radical rivals who
claim they are Khomeini's revolutionary heirs.
   President Ali Khamenei, 49, was swiftly elected the country's
spiritual leader by the 83-member Assembly of Experts, formed in
1979 to ensure a smooth succession when Khomeini died.
   But it is Hashemi Rafsanjani _ Parliament speaker, acting
commander-in-chief, and Khamenei's political ally _ who has emerged
as the strongman of the pragmatist alliance.
   Ahmad Khomeini, the late leader's 43-year-old son, appears to
have been effectively sidelined, his political ambitions dashed for
the time being at least. He is a one-time Rafsanjani ally now allied
with the radicals.
   Rafsanjani's high profile at this critical time underlines that,
for now, the pragmatists have wrested control away from the
radicals, who were on the rise before Khomeini died.
   Radicals, including Interior Minister Ali Akbar Mohtashemi, along
with military commanders and political leaders, have declared
allegiance to the new leader.
   But that display of unity masks the bitter rivalries that could
intensify now that Khomeini is not around to keep them in check, as
he did for years by alternating his support between the factions.
   Rafsanjani has favored increasing foreign ties to end Iran's
isolation _ even if he has given little sign of it since Khomeini's
death.
   Analysts believe that for the time being, he has to tread softly
to avoid accusations he is deviating from Khomeini's legacy of scorn
for Iran's enemies.
   Rafsanjani and his allies believe that economic and social
liberalization are essential after the sacrifices and hardships of
the eight-year war with Iraq.
   They believe Iran cannot afford to rely on fundamentalist slogans
to feed and employ its rapidly growing population, which is hungry
for a better life after the war, the excesses of the Islamic
revolution, and chronic economic problems.
   By contrast, the anti-Western radicals want to tighten state
control of the economy and further Khomeini's fundamentalist crusade
among the world's 800 million Moslems.
   Rafsanjani and his allies may be able to consolidate control if
they can hold out until August, when presidential elections and a
national referendum on sweeping constitutional changes will be held.
   The speaker is the only declared candidate in the Aug. 18
election. Khamanei, whose second four-year term expires in October,
cannot run for a third term.
   ``If Rafsanjani gets the constitutional changes through and gets
elected as well, he'll be in a very strong position,'' said Shahram
Chubin, an Iran specialist with Geneva's Graduate Institute of
International Affairs.
   ``But he'll have to move slowly against the radicals, cutting
them off one by one,'' he said.
   The reforms are being worked out by a committee formed by
Khomeini before his death to correct what he called ``flaws and
imperfections'' in the 1979 revolutionary constitution. The panel is
expected to recommend investing more power in the presidency and
possibly scrapping the post of prime minister, now held by
hard-liner Hussein Musavi.
   It may also propose downgrading the religious qualifications for
leadership, thus opening the door for men with lesser Islamic
credentials.
   Khomeini's death apparently ended the concept of Veleyat-e Faqih,
or rule by the divine regent, and Rafsanjani is now likely to push
for a more secular state.

<TEXT>
   Every few minutes, a jet leaving Kai Tak Airport
soars over the Sham Shui Po detention center for Vietnamese boat
people.
   Pham Ngoc Quang and the other 6,650 Vietnamese at the camp want
to take the flights to the United States and other Western
countries. That is why they suffered the long, hazardous journey by
boat to Hong Kong.
   Hong Kong wants to fly them all back to Vietnam.
   Pham, who paid a smuggler eight gold rings for the boat passage,
insists he left Vietnam ``not to be fed ... but to find freedom.''
   He is among the growing number of Vietnamese who fled their
homeland not because of political persecution but because of
economic hardship. They have overwhelmed refugees facilities in Hong
Kong and elsewhere and prompted demands they be forcibly repatriated.
   Pham fought for the army of communist North Vietnam, whose
overthrow of the U.S.-backed South Vietnam government in April 1975
began the boat exodus. More than a million Vietnamese have left, but
Western nations are increasingly reluctant to resettle them.
   Boats carrying 369 Vietnamese arrived in Hong Kong on Saturday,
bringing arrivals this year to 20,327, compared with 19,000 in 1988,
a government spokesman said on condition of anonymity. In all, some
44,000 illegal immigrants from Vietnam live in refugee camps in Hong
Kong.
   On Friday, local police in Tokyo said 105 people found on a
wooden boat near a southwestern Japanese island were Vietnamese who
left home in search of a place where they could ``enjoy a higher
standard of living.''
   For 14 years, much of the world considered anyone fleeing Vietnam
a legitimate refugee, and they were entitled to quick resettlement
in the West. But as more peasants flooded out in recent years,
officials began considering sending them back.
   ``Now many countries are sick of the refugee problem, especially
when faced with people who are not real refugees,'' said Prachyadavi
Tavedikul, deputy spokesman of Thailand's Foreign Ministry.
   The anger over boat people is not limited to governments.
   About 700 people marched through Hong Kong's Yuen Long district
on Sunday to protest the opening in their neighborhood of a new camp
for boat people. They called on authorities to stop allowing
Vietnamese into this British colony.
   At an Indochinese refugee conference in Geneva recently, Britain
and Hong Kong called for the forced return of those not fleeing for
political reasons. Hong Kong Governor David Wilson said this was the
humane course, because they would otherwise continue to sail in
unsafe boats only to suffer prolonged detention in camps.
   But Vietnam, with Soviet backing, repeated it will not accept
those forced to return.
   The United States said it opposed forced repatriation unless
economic, social and political conditions in Vietnam improve
dramatically.
   The conference did not endorse forced repatriation, but it
adopted a plan to screen all new arrivals. The plan called for
encouraging voluntary return and said if this did not succeed,
alternatives would be examined.
   Some officials in Thailand and Malaysia have said privately that
forced repatriation is the only solution and that screening
procedures don't deter the arrivals.
   Under screening procedures adopted by Hong Kong last June, only
143 Vietnamese have returned voluntarily, even though the United
Nations gives financial aid for people to return.
   The harsh boat journey and pirate attacks also have not stopped
the boat people.
   According to Suvit Yodmani, Thailand's government spokesman, two
Vietnamese women arriving there May 30 said pirates attacked their
boat and killed the other 18 passengers. On June 1, fishermen picked
up three Vietnamese after their boat carrying 40 people capsized,
Suvit said.
   Hong Kong, Malaysia and Thailand will, however, benefit from the
pledges at Geneva to resettle 53,500 Vietnamese refugees over the
next three years. The United States pledged 22,000 places.
   In Hong Kong, some relief officials say conditions are worse than
ever and government detention sites are inhumane. With no room left,
this week 4,500 refugees were living on a remote island in spartan,
filthy conditions with no electricity.
   Chris Bale, the director of the relief agency Oxfam Hong Kong,
said many Vietnamese were suffering psychological problems from
being confined in camps for years.
   Many Vietnamese appeared dejected and listless in the Sham Shui
Po detention center, a former army barracks surrounded by a high
metal wall topped with barbed wire.
   Across the street, a billboard advertising American cigarettes
features a huge picture of the Statue of Liberty.
   In the camps, northern and southern Vietnamese clash and refugees
stage daily hunger strikes to protest their classification as
illegal immigrants.
   ``Just be careful when you walk by. Some may be very violent,'' a
government worker warned a reporter visiting Sham Shui Po on Friday.
   Bale said few solutions were offered in Geneva to the root of the
problem _ the conditions in Vietnam that prompt flight.
   ``We're talking about one of the world's poorest countries,
ostracized by the world community for 10 years, still bearing the
scars of a very long and bitter war,'' he said.
   He urged the United States to free trade and aid for Vietnam by
normalizing diplomatic relations. Washington has said it won't do
that before Vietnam resolves the conflict over its decade-old
military occupation of Cambodia.

   Vietnamese boat people arriving in
Hong Kong braved the seas hoping for resettlement in the West, but
instead they are finding themselves towed to this deserted island.
   Tents raised by sticks and branches are their homes. Worn-out
mats, cardboard and plastic sheets are their beds. Daily meals are
biscuits and canned food.
   Litter is spead over the island's tiny paths and slopes, its
stench worsened by the summer heat. There is no electricity.
   About 4,500 Vietnamese were on the island during a
government-arranged visit by reporters Friday.
   ``My future is bleak,'' said 30-year-old Phan Quyen, a dental
technician who fled Ho Chi Minh City, formerly Saigon. ``I want to
go to Australia. Anywhere is better than Tai A Chau. Life here is
tough, I have not had any rice for 11 days.''
   Le Thi Chau, 31, an English teacher from Danang in central
Vietnam said: ``I never imagined it like this. It's terrible. But I
have sympathy with the Hong Kong government. Many, many people have
arrived.''
   There are no cooking facilities on the island and refugees are
forced to dig holes for toilets, said Marine Police chief inspector
Au Wai-lam.
   ``There is no hygiene at all,'' he said. ``I feel sorry for them,
but look at the situation in Hong Kong. We just can't cope with it.''
   A junior officer said the boat people often fight over food and
space. People from northern Vietnam clash with the southern
Vietnamese, others said.
   Since May 30, authorities have been towing boats carrying
Vietnamese to the island, 19 miles from the city center, because no
other facilities remain in Hong Kong. Initially, the refugees were
allowed ashore only to relieve themselves.
   The Vietnamese spend several days on the island before being
moved to facilities in Hong Kong.
   Western relief agencies have criticized conditions at Tai A Chau.
   When Typhoon Dot approached earlier this month, authorities moved
some of the Vietnamese from Tai A Chau to a nearby island and others
to the Marine Police headquarters on the main Hong Kong island. When
the threat subsided, they were moved back.
   Besides the Vietnamese, the only people on the island are Chow
Yu-fook and Ng Sing-tai, an elderly Chinese couple who live near the
pier. They say the Vietnamese have ruined their peaceful existence.
   ``I can't sleep at night,'' said Mrs. Chow, 62. ``They are
annoying. The beans and sweet potatoes I grew are gone. I can't even
pick up shells. The fish are all scared away by the boats.''

<BYLINE>Activists Call For Action to Avoid ``Bottomless Pit of Agitation''
^By MIKE ROBINSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Twenty-five years after Congress tore down the
trappings of racial segregation in America, civil rights leaders are
reeling from setbacks in the Supreme Court and calling for urgent
measures to save protections they say are endangered by the latest
decisions.
   ``What is required is legislative action to address every single
point the court made and sooner rather than later,'' U.S. Civil
Rights Commission member Mary Frances Berry said following the
court's latest decision last week.
   Failure of Congress to act, she said, could cause ``a bottomless
pit of agitation'' similar to the turmoil that gave rise to the
landmark Civil Rights Act of 1964. The measure, signed into law by
President Lyndon B. Johnson 25 years ago next month, banned
segregation in public accommodations and its Title VII paved the way
for court action to end to bias in hiring and promotions.
   ``The court is essentially saying, hey Title VII, let me give you
a good birthday present,'' Berry said. ``And the birthday present is
that we could care less about civil rights or history or any of it.
We are the Reagan Court and take that.''
   Her bitter tone was echoed by numerous civil rights leaders.
   ``Redneck justice meted out with country club manners is no less
painful than the real thing,'' Molly Yard, president of the National
Organization for Women, declared in a statement.
   In a 5-4 decision, the court on Thursday barred use of an 1866
civil rights law to fight racial harassment, although it did
unanimously uphold the law itself, originally passed to help freed
slaves.
   It was only the latest in a stream of 1989 decisions that alarm
civil rights leaders.
   On Jan. 23, the court in a 6-3 decision put limits on what state
and local governments may do to implement affirmative action plans,
striking down a Richmond, Va., program that set aside a portion of
public works projects for minority-owned contracting companies.
   On June 5, the justices in a 5-4 decision made it more difficult
for workers to prove job bias through the use of statistical data.
   On June 12, in a 5-4 decision, the court expanded the possibility
for white men to challenge longstanding, court-approved plans
providing preferential treatment for minorities and women in
government jobs.
   The court's new turn has been welcomed by conservatives as a long
overdue change in direction. Conservative legal analyst Bruce Fein
said ``legions'' of lawsuits could be expected, challenging
longstanding consent agreements in government hiring cases. The wave
of litigation will mean progress, he said, because much of the time
white males were not party to the initial agreements.
   ``It was like negotiating Munich without Czechoslovakia at the
negotiating table,'' he said. ``Czechoslovakia didn't fare very
well. It wasn't a very glorious result.''
   Civil rights forces scorn such comparisons, saying there were
ample chances for white men to become parties to the initial
agreements and that in many cases they did participate in fairness
hearings. ``I don't think most of the consent decrees were entered
into in a star chamber with everybody else excluded,'' said Patricia
Ireland of the National Organization for Women.
   Court decisions since January have taken a heavy toll on what
civil rights forces had counted as permanent gains, she said.
   ``I think our recourse has to be political and I don't mean just
electoral politics but the politics of marches and demonstrations,''
she said.
   Meanwhile, a cascade of criticism rained down on the court
following Thursday's decision.
   The court is ``abandoning (its) historic role (as) the principle
protector of individual rights and liberties for the last 35
years,'' said Benjamin Hooks of the Leadership Conference on Civil
Rights.
   Ralph Neas of the Leadership Conference said that he had spent
part of the afternoon meeting with congressional aids ``to discuss
the range of legislative options'' and that prospects appeared good
that civil rights legislation would be introduced this year.
   ``Without doubt the Supreme Court has made it much more difficult
for minorities and for women to win civil rights cases,'' he said.
He called the latest round of decisions ``a disaster for all those
committed to equal employment opportunity.''
   Barbara Arnwine, executive director of the Lawyers Committee for
Civil Rights Under Law, declared that the court has ``absolutely no
appreciation for modern-day racism.''
   ``This court seems to feel that racism isn't really an issue in
modern society and that blacks and Hispanics and Asians are making
it and that they're making it at the expense of white men,'' she
said. ``And that's wrong.''

   Soviets had comforted themselves with the belief
their children would have better lives, but glasnost is making them
painfully aware of how untrue that can be, a Soviet journalist says.
   ``There was an expression that `children are the only privileged
class,''' said Natalie Darialova. That belief was easy to maintain
during the decades when officials denied social problems and branded
acknowledgment as undermining communism.
   But under the recent policies of glasnost, or more openness,
Soviets are finding that the system has failed the children, leaving
them neglected at home or stupefied with boredom, she said.
   An estimated 300,000 are consigned to orphanages that do little
more than feed and clothe them, Ms. Darialova said.
   The root of those abuses was the top-heavy bureaucracy and the
corruption that flourished during Leonid Brezhnev's years as Soviet
leader, she said in a recent interview here while on a private trip.
   In addition, she said, society's pressure on women to work _ and
their need for the extra income _ led many couples to neglect their
children. A prominent Soviet sociologist reported last year that 94
percent of Soviet women worked and that working mothers spent an
average of just 30 minutes a week ``on spiritual communication with
their children.''
   Ms. Darialova began investigating the problems of youth in 1985
when she was assigned by the weekly Literary Gazette to do a story
about five children left unattended who died in a house fire.
   When she asked local authorities why the parents hadn't been able
to find someone to watch the children, ``I found that no one was in
charge'' of child welfare, she said. ``The local soviets (councils)
had no authority, no money. They were the poorest bodies.
   ``Under Brezhnev, social and cultural programs were cut. Much
money went to who knows where,'' she said.
   The bleakness of life in many Soviet cities is, in effect, a sort
of child abuse, Ms. Darialova said. Many children have little to do
with their free time and youthful energy.
   That can lead to street crime, which Soviet figures say has risen
by about 40 percent in the past year, or other anti-social behavior.
One press report bemoaned motorcycle gangs made up of ``minors who
like to ride with the wind.''
   ``Imagine a city with no cultural facilities. Children can go out
and buy a bottle of wine, and the road to crime is open,'' she said,
adding that by ``cultural facilities'' she meant movies and places
for rock music, as well as opera and classical music.
   The government has begun an extensive program to combat alcohol
abuse by upping prices and raising the drinking age to 21, but it
has not reduced children's desire to combat boredom through
intoxication, she said.
   Coming to grips with their children's problems has been traumatic
because ``in general, there is much love. All their lives is in
their children ... Russian babushkas (grandmothers) are famous for
their devotion.
   ``In discussions I often hear that in Brezhnev's time we didn't
have these problems. Of course it is frightening when you open a
newspaper and it's more and more (problems).
   ``But it is a new atmosphere. We now feel the ability to do
something, not to be just obedient employees.''

   You can be doggone sure Dixie ain't like
other parts of this here United States. That's the message of a work
scrunching the South's A-to-Z uniqueness into an 8-pound, 1,643-page
book to be unveiled this week.
   Beginning with baseball great Hank Aaron and ending with zydeco,
``wonderful Cajun music played with an accordion,'' editor Bill
Ferris says the newly published Encyclopedia of Southern Culture
provides a one-of-a-kind single-volume reference work.
   The book boils down the region to its bare bones, he says, but
leaves the marrow of the South's contributions and history in 24
major subjects _ including agriculture, art and literature, black
life, law, politics and science.
   Articles focus on every aspect of Southern life from defining
``good ole boys and girls,'' to how to prepare collard greens and
okra, to explaining the impact air conditioning has had on the
region's economic development.
   ``Roots'' author Alex Haley wrote the forward to the
encyclopedia, which was edited by Ferris, director of the University
of Mississippi's Center for the Study of Southern Culture, and
Charles Wilson, professor of history and Southern studies at the
university. It is to be unveiled at a gala Tuesday in Washington.
   ``I testify that this Encyclopedia of Southern Culture mirrors
the very best of what has lately come to be called `the new
South,''' Haley wrote. ``Never before has such a volume been
produced by a team so committed to distilling and presenting our
Southern distinctiveness.''
   Ferris said Haley was asked to do the forward because ``we felt
his work really was symbolic of our quest to understand the roots of
all Southerners. And Alex Haley has become a spokesman for bridging
white and black, old and young, and male and female worlds _ which
this volume seeks to do.''
   The dinner Tuesday in the U.S. Senate Caucus Room will have as
its hosts the state's congressional delegation and University of
Mississippi Chancellor Gerald Turner. The chairman of the National
Endowment for the Humanities, Lynne Cheney, and Mississippi author
Willie Morris are among those scheduled to speak.
   Ferris said that between 600 and 800 are expected to attend.
   The encyclopedia, funded by more than $400,000 in public and
private grants including almost $246,000 from the National
Endowment, features articles by more than 800 experts on various
aspects of the South.
   Although most of the entries were written by academic scholars _
with ``academic jargon'' edited out, other contributors were
solicited, Ferris said.
   ``For example, the man who wrote the article on Mississippi River
law is a practicing lawyer in Vicksburg, Emmett Ward, whose law
practice is focused on the river,'' Ferris said.
   Cheney said she's pleased with the finished product. The $49.95
work printed by the University of North Carolina Press should be
widely distributed by fall.
   ``The Encyclopedia of Southern Culture masterfully illustrates
Southern religion and folk life, explores Southern manners and
myths, and celebrates Southern literature and art,'' Cheney said.
``Hundreds of dedicated scholars contributed to this work and
succeeded in capturing the unique richness of life in the South.''

   A member of the ruling Politburo was quoted Sunday
as making conciliatory remarks about dissent, but official media
reported more arrests of student activists and demanded the United
States give up dissident Fang Lizhi.
   Also, state-run media said Sunday the government will require
people who are granted travel visas by foreign countries to obtain
two exit permits from the Chinese government instead of one.
   The move, apparently aimed at keeping dissidents from fleeing,
requires citizens to obtain exit permits before and after they apply
for visas. In recent days, large crowds seeking visas have formed
outside foreign embassies.
   Qiao Shi, a standing member of the Politburo, told a meeting of
non-party officials Saturday that ``it is very natural that people
have different views and doubts'' under the current ``complicated ''
situation.
   The comments, reported Sunday by the official People's Daily
newspaper, were more conciliatory than past remarks by hardliners
who now control the Communist Party.
   Since the suppression of pro-democracy demonstrations this month,
the government has been waging a nationwide campaign to compel
greater loyalty to the party.
   The newspaper quoted Qiao as saying the party would continue to
promote socialist democracy and improve the legal system.
   The front-page coverage strengthened speculation that Qiao will
replace Zhao Ziyang as general secretary of the 47 million-member
party. The party Central Committee is expected to meet soon to
formalize Zhao's ouster.
   Zhao is believed to have been stripped of power after opposing
the decision by senior leader Deng Xiaoping and Premier Li Peng to
declare martial law in Beijing on May 20.
   The subsequent June 3-4 military attack on Beijing claimed up to
3,000 lives, according to Chinese witnesses and Western intelligence
reports. The Chinese said about 300 died, including many soldiers.
   Qiao has kept a low profile during his long career as a party
administrator, but is generally considered a conservative because of
his record as head of internal security and party discipline.
   The national television news reported 10 more arrests of
protesters, including three identified as students. Two were said to
be leaders of an independent student group representing universities
from outside Beijing.
   The third, Liu Huan, identified as a spokesman for the student
movement, was accused of absconding with 17,000 yuan, about $4,600,
in student funds.
   More than 1,300 people have been arrested for rioting and
counterrevolutionary activities following nationwide uprisings
sparked by the military invasion of Beijing.
   The Beijing Daily said Sunday that Yang Tao, a Beijing University
student and one of 21 student activists on a nationwide wanted list,
was arrested in western Gansu province Saturday.
   Yang was the fifth student reported to have been arrested or to
have turned himself in since the list was published June 13.
   A Beijing court Saturday sentenced seven men and one woman to
death for beating soldiers and burning vehicles during the military
takeover, which met the resistance of thousands of Beijing residents.
   They were the first to receive the death sentence for battling
troops during the army assault on Beijing. Three Shanghai men
earlier were sentenced to die for setting fire to a train that ran
through a barricade set up by protesters in Shanghai, killing six
people.
   The condemned have three days to appeal their sentences, although
stays of execution are rare. Execution in China is by a bullet to
the back of the head.
   The People's Daily also carried a letter from a legal expert
saying the United States was violating both Chinese and
international law by sheltering dissident Fang Lizhi and his wife,
Li Shuxian.
   Chen Weidian, vice president of the China Law Society, said it is
normal international practice that foreign embassies don't use their
premises to shelter criminals.
   Fang, a astrophysicist and prominent dissident, fled to the U.S.
Embassy after the military crackdown. The Chinese government later
ordered his arrest and has accused the U.S. government of
interfering in China's internal affairs by protecting him.

   Workers and drifters in their 20s or 30s account
for most of the more than 1,300 people reported arrested in the
crackdown on pro-democracy demonstrators.
   But students, teachers, scientists, factory officials and farmers
also have been charged in the nationwide roundup, according to
reports in state-run media.
   Some were arrested after days in hiding or flight. Others were
turned in by relatives or surrendered.
   The official media provide few names and even less personal
background about those arrested. The longest profiles are given to
those with criminal records.
   They are accused of setting army trucks and tanks on fire and
beating and stoning soldiers, sometimes fatally, in their efforts to
stop the army from entering the city to put down the student-led
protests. Some are accused of stealing weapons or military supplies.
   Most of the students are accused of spreading
counterrevolutionary propaganda.
   Here are a few of the accused:
   _Bai Xinyu, 61, was arrested June 11, but police are still
investigating his case, the Beijing Daily reported during the
weekend. It said Bai had been sentenced to labor reform and prison
``many times'' for hooliganism and attempted murder, and regarded
the confrontation between the army and angry crowds in Beijing on
June 3-4 as ``an opportunity to get even with the government.''
   _Wu Rangyuan didn't burn any army trucks herself, but the Beijing
Daily charged that she incited others to do so. It said the
46-year-old researcher at the Chinese Academy of Sciences
Semiconducter Research Institute was arrested June 9 and charged
with agitation and rumor-mongering.
   ``She incited a gang to attack a traffic center, spreading the
rumor that anti-riot police were stationed inside,'' the paper said.
``She also spread the rumor that army trucks weren't burned by
rebels but were burned by the soldiers themselves.'' When rebels had
trouble burning a truck, she advised them to torch the tires, not
the metal sides, the paper said.
   _Yang Tao, 19, a skinny history student at Beijing University,
described in a wanted circular as having high cheekbones and wearing
glasses. He spent 12 days on the run, using an assumed name, before
being arrested Friday.
   Newspapers said Yang was a leader in the United Association of
Beijing Universities, the independent student union set up early in
the seven weeks of student protests. The government, which organizes
official student groups, called it illegal.
   Official reports said Yang took a train north to Inner Mongolia,
went east to Shenyang, returned to Beijing and immediately switched
to a westbound train and got off two days later in Lanzhou, a city
where he had once studied. There he bought contact lenses to change
his appearance and traveled to a small hamlet, where he checked into
a guesthouse under the name Li Jie. But the local party secretary
grew suspicious and reported him to the local police, who matched
him up with the circular.
   _Luo Hongjun is among 11 people sentenced to death for their
roles in the protests. He once spent time in ``administrative
detention'' _ a sentence that can be given by police, without a
trial _ for beating others.
   ``At about 8 a.m. on June 4, criminal Luo rode a flatbed
three-wheeled cart to the ... Youanmen Bridge neighborhood and
leaped on an army supply truck being blocked there from entering the
city,'' the People's Daily said. ``He began to throw down wildly the
army uniforms, condensed food and other supplies inside and shouted
crazily to the people surrounding the truck, inciting them to attack
and loot. He grabbed a vegetable knife in his own hand and began to
hack and chop.''
   There was no charge Luo caused any deaths, and the report did not
say why his alleged deeds were ranked among the ``heinous crimes''
of those who allegedly killed soldiers.
   Luo and the others sentenced to death have appealed, but there is
no record of a death sentence being overturned on appeal in
Communist China.
   Death sentences can be suspended two years with the possibility
of being commuted to life imprisonment for good behavior.
   Executions are usually with a bullet to the back of the head.

<HEAD>Neighbors Worry About Chemical Plant that Topped EPA Cancer List</HEAD>

<DATELINE>PORT NECHES, Texas (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   In the shadow of a Texaco chemical
plant that topped a federal list for cancer risk, a housewife
complains of odors, a school janitor worries about a skin ailment
and a pregnant woman thinks of moving.
   Government and industry officials say the report listing Texaco's
Port Neches facility as the nation's worst cancer risk is flawed,
but that hasn't convinced the neighbors whose fears it awakened.
   ``Sure, I'm worried,'' said Michelle Thompson, 19, who learned
she was pregnant the same week a congressman caused a stir by
releasing the 5-year-old Environmental Protection Agency list.
   ``I have a son. I have one on the way. I don't want to live
around here if there's going to be a threat of cancer,'' she said.
``I never even thought about the plant. I've only lived here a year
and it never even crossed my mind.'' Now, she says, she has talked
to her husband about leaving.
   Rep. Henry Waxman, D-Calif., released the report June 8 listing
Texaco's butadiene plant as posing a one-in-10 risk of cancer.
Though the ranking was hypothetical _ it was based on the chances of
contracting cancer for a person living within 200 meters of the
plant over a 70-year period _ it put Texaco's facility at the top of
a list of 205 plants around the country.
   Government and industry officials said the data was outdated,
based on assumptions and offered no real indication of cancer risk,
and some have chided Waxman for prompting unnecessary public fear.
   Measurements by Texas agencies sharply contradict the EPA report,
which the EPA described as a priority guide to locating pollutants
and an inaccurate source of actual cancer risk.
   State studies also show that cancer deaths in the area around the
plant reflect statewide trends.
   ``Certainly we're not saying that it's not a problem,'' said
Marcia Willhite, a toxicologist in the Texas Air Control Board's
research division. ``We have been looking at it in the past and plan
another monitoring trip in the near future.
   ``On the other hand, if I were living in Port Neches I would be
pretty alarmed by some of the information I'm reading in the
newspaper,'' Ms. Willhite said. ``We just don't see them as
real-world estimates.''
   Pearl Clark, whose mother died of cancer and husband is
undergoing treatment for the disease, wonders if the EPA report may
be close to the truth.
   ``I have no proof, but I have often wondered about these
plants,'' said Mrs. Clark, 57. ``I think everybody here has
wondered.''
   ``There used to be a lot more people around here, but they got
scared and moved out,'' said Violet Smith, who has lived across the
street from the plant for 27 years. ``We were planning to go too,
but we just couldn't afford it.''
   The Texaco plant produces about 300,000 tons per year f
butadiene, an ethylene extract used in the production of rubber.
Butadiene has been linked to leukemia and lymphomas.
   Officials at the plant said its design, rather than emissions,
affected the EPA ranking.
   The EPA used a list provided by Texaco naming every possible
source of leakage from the World War II-era plant, and then assumed
leakage from every point in constructing what was essentially a
worst-case model.
   Texaco has been testing every possible source of leakage annually
since 1986 and found few leaks, said Ray Fletcher, manager of
technical services at the plant.
   ``The number of actual emissions we have reported since then have
been well within the accepted range ... and the number has decreased
every year,'' Fletcher said.
   On-site tests have never reflected a hazardous level of
emissions, Ms. Willhite said. A level of 220 micrograms per cubic
meter is used as a guideline for hazardous levels of butadiene, she
said, but the highest level ever found near the Texaco plant was 20
mpm in 1984.
   The plant is facing possible fines for three nuisance violations
from odor complaints. A faint chemical odor is almost always in the
air around Port Neches and nearby communities where petrochemical
distilling towers dominate the skyline. Texas is home to 45 percent
of the nation's petrochemical industry.
   Texaco employs about 850 workers in the city of 14,000.
   ``They're all worried about jobs, and they talk about plants
shutting down,'' said Mrs. Smith, recalling past layoffs. ``I know a
lot of them are concerned about losing their jobs, more so than
cancer.''

<HEAD>Study Urged of Possible Health Effects From Power Lines</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   More research is needed to explore the
potential health risks from the electromagnetic fields produced by
power lines, particularly the effects on the nervous system and
possible role in promoting cancer, a congressional study said Sunday.
   The paper published by the congressional Office of Technology
Assessment also said that while most public concern has focused on
high-voltage transmission lines, more attention should be paid to
exposure to such fields from other sources including household
wiring and appliances.
   ``It is now clear that 60 Hz (cycles per second) and other low
frequency electromagnetic fields can interact with individual cells
and organs to produce biological changes,'' the study said. ``The
nature of these interactions for public health remain unclear, but
there are legitimate reasons for concern.''
   The background paper was prepared for OTA by three researchers _
Indira Nair, M. Granger Morgan and H. Keith Florig _ affiliated with
the Department of Engineering and Public Policy at Carnegie Mellon
University.
   It noted that concerns about health effects of high-power
transmission lines ``have prompted vigorous public intervention and
litigation which has significantly impeded the ability of private
and public utilities to construct new power transmission facilities.
   Without adequate research to provide answers to this problem,
``the resulting contention could go on for many years and have costs
significantly greater than the costs of the needed research,'' the
report said.
   The paper said research on so-called power frequency
electromagnetic fields should include a balanced mixture of
cellular-level studies aimed at examining biological mechanisms,
whole animal studies and human epidemiological studies.
   The brain and central nervous system, it said, are ``natural
candidates for interaction with fields'' because they themselves
utilize low frequency fields for cellular communication and
functioning. The report said a ``carefully planned research agenda''
is needed in this area.
   On the sensitive issue of whether there may be an association
between exposure to extremely low frequency (ELF) fields and the
occurrence of cancer, the OTA paper's findings included:
   _ELF fields are not known to cause any damage to chromosomes,
which contain each cell's genetic material, and hence are not likely
to be initiators of cancer.
   _Some cellular-level experiments indicate that the cell membrane
is the site of the interaction between ELF fields and the cell. The
membrane site responsible for this action has also been shown to be
a receptor for chemical cancer-promoters.
   _Epidemiological studies so far have shown a ``weak association''
between ELF field exposure and leukemia and nervous system cancer.
   The report observed that ``if exposure to fields does turn out to
pose a health risk, it is unlikely that high-voltage transmission
lines will be the only sources of concern.
   ``Power frequency fields are also produced by distribution lines,
wall wiring, appliances and lighting fixtures. These
non-transmission sources are much more common than transmission
lines and could play a far greater role than transmission lines in
any public health problem,'' it said.
   Electromagnetic fields are common in nature and appear in all
living things. They hold atoms together, generate lightning and make
navigation by compass possible. Television and radio sets and
microwave ovens depend on electric and magnetic fields for their
operation.
   Electric fields are produced when electric charges are ``pumped''
onto wires by electric generators. Electric fields arise from the
amount of the electric charge, and magnetic fields result from the
motion of that charge. Taken together, they are referred to as
electromagnetic fields.
   Unlike X-rays or microwaves, electromagnetic fields do not cause
tissue damage or heating. However, low-frequency magnetic fields can
trigger major biochemical responses critical to the functioning of
human cells, which operate by complex electrochemical processes.
   The OTA paper said that while recent years have seen ``dramatic
developments'' in scientific knowledge, ``the past several years
have also witnessed a marked decrease in the level of federal
research support in this area which has only recently begun to
reverse.''
   The Navy, which operates ELF submarine communications facilities
in Wisconsin and Michigan, undertook about $8 million worth of
biological effects research between 1969 and 1977. It has continued
to sponsor ecological field studies in the vicinity of the
transmitters, at a level of about $2 million a year.
   Over the past decade, the main civilian federal source of
research money has been the Department of Energy's Office of Energy
Storage and Distribution, whose research budget rose from $2.2
million in fiscal 1988 to $3 million in the current fiscal year.
   The states of New York and Maryland have conducted research
programs, and California recently adopted a bill requiring the
state's larger utilities to fund a two-year, $2 million research
project on ELF fields.
   Research support from the Electric Power Research Institute,
sponsored by utility companies, declined slightly in recent years
but is now expanding and is projected to reach $6 million in fiscal
1990.

<HEAD>Criminal Charges Brought Against Armenia Builders For Quake Damage</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ANDREW KATELL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Authorities have begun prosecuting builders whose
shoddy work caused hundreds of new buildings to collapse during the
Armenian earthquake, killing thousands of people who would otherwise
have survived, a newspaper said Sunday.
   Workers used inferior materials, garbage and even an empty bucket
rather than solid concrete during construction of some buildings in
the Soviet republic, the newspaper Socialist Industry reported.
   The Dec. 7 quake killed an estimated 25,000 people and left
500,000 homeless.
   On Thursday, a government commission formed to probe the quality
of construction in the devastated earthquake zone gave prosecutors
the results of its investigation.
   ``Thousands of people could have survived the catastrophic
earthquake in Armenia if basic building standards and regulations
were observed,'' the commission concluded, Socialist Industry said.
   The prosecutor's office has begun criminal proceedings against
leaders of building organizations, work superintendents and
designers, V. Nenashev, deputy head of the prosecutor's
investigations office, told the newspaper.
   Those convicted of substandard construction and building code
violations face a maximum penalty of five years in prison.
   Construction in the Soviet Union is of notoriously poor quality
and subject to long delays and theft of materials.
   The commission's report on building practices in Armenia is
certain to have nationwide ramifications. The Soviet Union is in the
midst of a program to provide every family with individual housing
by the year 2000.
   Most of the buildings that collapsed in northwestern Armenia were
five- or nine-story apartment houses, which are common in the Soviet
Union.
   Immediately after the quake, Soviet officials including President
Mikhail S. Gorbachev said slipshod construction caused hundreds of
relatively new apartment buildings to tumble into ruins of concrete
bits and metal.
   ``Why did buildings from three years ago collapse while those
built with three or five stories under (former Soviet Premier Nikita
S.) Khrushchev are still standing?'' Gorbachev asked during a Dec.
11 visit to Spitak, the city hit hardest by the quake.
   Nenashev told Socialist Industry that a key junction of one house
where dozens of people were killed was filled with an empty bucket,
some sort of bars, and construction refuse. The junction should have
been a solid ``monolith'' of concrete, he said.
   A photograph accompanying the article showed the metal bucket
surrounded by rubble.
   Nenashev also discussed slipshod work discovered in the ruins of
one 20-apartment, five-story stone house built in 1985 in Spitak.
The strength of concrete in solid reinforced columns was up to three
times below required level, he said.
   Reporters visiting another devastated city, Leninakan, shortly
after the quake saw one broken slab from a collapsed building
marked, ``This piece of concrete is not to be used,'' indicating it
was below standard. The Soviet press has reported that much of the
concrete was more sand than cement and branded those responsible
``scrap builders.''
   Mortar used in masonry of inner and outer walls of the Spitak
house had no bond strength because it contained no cement, Nenashev
told the newspaper. Rigid horizontal floor disks required for
buildings in quake-prone areas were missing. Anti-seismic belts were
not reinforced and were not attached to non-supporting walls, he
said.
   Some Leninakan residents have said that up until 20 years ago, no
one built anything taller than two or three stories in the
earthquake-prone area.
   The government has launched a program to rebuild the devastated
area and promised that no buildings taller than three or four
stories will be put up there. The goal is to finish reconstruction
in two years.
   But a commission of the ruling Communist Party Politburo
complained Saturday that ``rates of restoration work are far from
satisfactory.'' It said customers and contractors are poorly
organized and that the reconstruction effort suffers from a shortage
of manpower, technical facilities, stone, cement and timber.

   Customs officers on Sunday seized 448 tusks and
other ivory products worth $2.6 million that were to have been
smuggled to Japan, the Customs and Excise Department reported.
   Customs officers found the material during an inspection at the
cargo terminal at Hong Kong's airport, the department said in a
statement.
   On Friday, the Hong Kong government banned the import of raw
ivory in an effort to protect the African elephant.
   This month, the Customs Department formed a task force to stop
any illegal ivory imports or exports.
   The 10,874 pounds of ivory products were packed into eight
consignments that had been declared as watches for export, the

   ``I was already thrilled she was on television,'' Viola Crow, 79,
said Saturday after watching her sister on Carson's ``The Tonight
Show.'' ``But when he said he was going to give us the stove and the
refrigerator _ well, oh my, it was just great.''
   Carolyn Freeman, 70, told Carson Friday night how she and her
sister had told city officials for 20 years that they were paying
their neighbor's water bill in addition to their own because both
lines were connected to their meter.
   Freeman described how she and Ms. Crow had skimped on water by
taking sponge baths and eating canned beans to avoid using water to
wash fresh vegetables.
   The city finally relented in April and reimbursed them more than
$800.
   When Carson asked how they planned to spend the $800, Mrs.
Freeman said they would buy a new stove and refrigerator.
   Carson then said he'd buy the appliances.

   Rising country music singer Suzy
Bogguss says life has changed since she was voted best new female
artist by the Academy of Country Music in April.
   ``After the award, my bookings quadrupled, the requests for
interviews just flooded and everything seemed to happen,'' she said
in a telephone interview last week.
   ``It's a lot different than two years ago when I went to 55 radio
stations in the South and Midwest to see if they would play my
music,'' the 32-year-old singer said.
   ``I don't mind because I'm a travel nut and I measure my success
by the places I've been.''
   By the time her concert tour ends this summer, she will have been
to 47 of the 50 states.
   Her current album is titled ``Somewhere Between.''

   A little fear can take you a long way,
astronaut Scott Carpenter told a group of 500 school children at the
40th anniversary celebration of the Morehead Planetarium.
   ``Everyone of us was scared, but there's nothing wrong with being
scared,'' Carpenter said in response to a question. ``A little
fright helps you do all sorts of things better.''
   Carpenter was with six of the original seven Mercury astronauts
who appeared Saturday at the festivities for the planetarium, which
served as a training center for astronauts from 1959 to 1975.
   Donald ``Deke'' Slayton, Gordon Cooper, Sen. John Glenn, Walter
Schirra and Alan Shepard were there for the visit, which also marked
the 30th anniversary of the Mercury program and the upcoming 20th
anniversary next month of the Apollo 11 mission and Neil Armstrong's
historic walk on the moon.
   For most of the elementary school children it was the first time
they had seen a ``real, live astronaut,'' as one youngster put it.

   Only 20 percent of the late Rock Hudson's home
is standing midway into a remodeling job by its new owner, film
director John Landis.
   Landis, who bought the residence in probate court nearly two
years ago for $2.89 million, has filled in the pool with concrete
and demolished all but 20 percent of Hudson's two-story hacienda
overlooking Beverly Hills.
   Still standing is the original motor court behind tall oleanders,
soon to be replaced by a large wall with electric gates.
   Landis, who purchased the home just after his acquittal of
involuntary manslaughter in the helicopter-crash deaths of three
actors during filming of ``Twilight Zone,'' could spend more than
$3.5 million more before he and his wife, Deborah, move in.
   The Los Angeles Times reported Sunday that the couple hoped to
move in by Christmas, but it now appears the earliest would be next
Easter.

   South Korean patrol boats rescued 78
Vietnamese refugees who set their boat on fire and jumped into the
water after they were refused permission to land, a news agency said
Sunday.
   The patrol boats were escorting the refugee vessel out to
international waters when the 30-ton boat suddenly burst into flames
and sank, Yonhap, the South Korean news agency, quoted naval police
as saying.
   The incident happened Saturday off the southern island of Cheju,
Yonhap said.
   The 45 men and 33 women were ordered to stay aboard the patrol
boats, Yonhap said. It was not clear whether the government would
allow the boat people to settle in South Korea, which does not have
diplomatic relations with Vietnam.
   Naval authorities had ordered the Vietnamese to stay out of South
Korean waters after blocking a May 7 attempt by the boat people to
land on the western island of Uldo, the agency said.
   Hundreds of Vietnamese refugees have been allowed to stay in
South Korea or have gone to other countries through South Korean
refugee camps since 1975, when the Saigon government fell. Recently,
however, Seoul has been reluctant to accept refugees from communist
Vietnam.

   Thousands of people gathered Sunday to support
the pro-democracy movement in China and watch the unveiling of a
replica of the ``Goddess of Democracy,'' the statue torn down by
troops in Beijing.
   About 4,000 people attended the ceremony in Victoria Park. It was
the latest expression of this British colony's anger over the
crackdown by the Chinese government, which is to assume control of
Hong Kong in 1997.
   The 33-foot-high statue, an image of a torch-bearing woman that
was inspired by the Statue of Liberty, is a replica of the statue
put up by protesters in Beijing's Tiananmen Square.
   ``A statue was knocked down, but thousands will be erected all
over the world,'' said Szeto Wah, a lawmaker who presided over the
ceremony. ``There will be a day when the statue will be erected on
Tiananmen Square in Beijing.''
   Wah laid a wreath at an empty tomb beside the plastic statue. It
was inscribed: ``To the memory of compatriots who died or were
injured in the patriotic pro-democracy movement'' and ``Democracy
martyrs are eternal.''
   The crowd sang ``For Freedom,'' a song Hong Kong activists wrote
in support of the Beijing students who led the China protests.
   The statue was built by artists and by students from the Academy
for Performing Arts, the Chinese University of Hong Kong and the
Hong Kong Polytechnic.
   The statue faces north to China. Wah said he would ask the
government to allow a permanent place for it.
   The original statue was knocked down by a tank in Tiananmen
Square on June 4 after troops rolled in to crush the 7-week-old
movement for greater social freedoms.
   China's state-controlled media said last week that nearly 100
soldiers and police died and that thousands were injured, while
about 100 civilians died and nearly 1,000 were injured. Chinese
witnesses and Western intelligence sources said the death toll may
have been as high as 3,000.

<HEAD>Mayors Of Both Parties Back Higher Federal Taxes</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By WILLIAM M. WELCH</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>CHARLESTON, S.C. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The nation's mayors moved Sunday toward a
strong new policy statement advocating higher federal taxes, with
Republican mayors firmly in support of the departure from
administration policy.
   The proposed resolution before the U.S. Conference of Mayors at
its annual meeting called on Congress and the Bush administration
``to raise revenues in a fair, equitable and progressive way.''
   The mayors, from more than 200 cities, neared approval on a wide
range of resolutions on other issues, including one on the drug
problem that calls for a ban on the possession of semi-automatic
assault weapons. It also calls for converting closed and underused
military bases to use as prisons and drug treatment centers.
   The position on gun control would go far beyond the Bush
administration's current ban on the importation of
foreign-manufactured semi-automatics. It would ban the domestic
manufacture and sale as well as banning possession.
   Both the drugs and taxes resolutions were approved with no
dissent by the conference's resolutions committee and appeared
headed for approval by the full group at its concluding session
Wednesday.
   Among the other resolutions was one saying the conference
deplores recent Supreme Court decisions that civil rights advocates
say have weakened affirmative programs aimed at ending
discrimination in employment. It calls on Congress to enact
legislation protecting affirmative action programs.
   ``The problem with these decisions is it's just opening the
floodgates for negative lawsuits trying to undue just literally
hundreds and thousands of plans all around the country that have
basically been working pretty well,'' said Mayor Bill Hudnut of
Indianapolis, a Republican.
   Although the budget statement uses the word ``revenues'' rather
than taxes, there was no disputing that the mayors were advocating a
federal tax increase. The resolution says the money raised should go
both to reduce the federal budget deficit and to finance new urban
aid programs.
   ``A realistic evaluation of the deficit problem confirms that no
effective deficit reduction approach can be implemented without a
significant infusion of revenues into the federal treasury,'' the
statement said.
   ``What we're being is realistic,'' said Republican Mayor Bob
Isaac of Colorado Springs, Colo., one of the conference's leaders.
``I think it's pretty moderate.''
   Most of the debate over the call for new federal taxes came
earlier in smaller committee meetings and before the conference's
executive committee. Republican mayors, outnumbered by Democrats,
supported the call for higher taxes in those sessions.
   Bill Canary, the White House's intergovernmental relations
director representing the administration here, said in an interview
that the White House made no effort to oppose the resolution even
though President Bush made a campaign pledge not to raise taxes.
   ``Our position here has largely been one of observing,'' Canary
said.
   The mayors' statement goes further in calling for new taxes than
the group has in the past, executive director Tom Cochran said. But
it does not go as far as a similar group, the League of Cities, went
last winter in naming a list of taxes it thought should be raised,
including the income tax.
   The Conference of Mayors resolution calls on Congress to consider
reducing defense spending ``consistent with national security,'' a
position the mayors have advocated previously. Mayors deleted a
proposal supported by Republicans that would have called for an
examination of entitlement programs such as Social Security and
federal retirement programs.
   Oddly, it was some of the more liberal Democratic mayors who
opposed the call for higher taxes, arguing that the statement might
not be well received in Congress, while Republicans advocated it in
the committees.
   ``It makes no sense from a political standpoint to go in there
and say, `We need to raise taxes,''' said Mayor John O. Norquist of
Milwaukee.
   The mayors' statement laments the massive growth of the federal
budget deficit throughout the Reagan administration despite major
cutbacks in federal spending on urban programs during those same
yerars. It said federal funds for key urban programs have been
reduced by 82 percent.

   Six highway signs will soon mark what a Georgia
professor believes was the 16th century route through the state by
Spanish explorer Hernando de Soto.
   The National Parks Service refuses to recognize his proposed
route, but Charles Hudson, an anthropology professor at the
University of Georgia, has obtained state approval for the markers.
   ``There'll never be complete agreement among scholars about where
the route is,'' said Hudson. ``But I think there is a growing
consensus that my route is close to the mark and right on it in some
places.''
   Some claims by local areas that de Soto was there are based on a
trail marked by the federal government in the 1930s and 1940s, which
is now believed to be wrong in some places.
   De Soto and 600 men explored the southeastern United States from
May 1539 until 1543, searching for riches and fighting with Indians.
   De Soto and half of his men died during the expedition, but they
are credited as the first Europeans to explore the interior of the
southeastern part of the country.

<HEAD>Syria Frees 145 Arafat Fighters In Apparent Goodwill Gesture</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Syria has freed 185 Palestinian guerrillas
and allied Sunni Moslem fighters from prisons in an apparent move
toward reconciliation with PLO chairman Yasser Arafat, Arab sources
said Sunday.
   The guerrillas _ 145 members of Arafat's Fatah movement and 40
members of the Sunni Moslem Tawhid faction _ were taken to the
Syrian-controlled north Lebanon city of Tripoli on Tuesday, the
sources said, speaking on condition of anonymity.
   Neither Syrian officials nor the Palestine Liberation
Organization had any comment on the report.
   The move was seen as part of behind-the-scenes moves by Syrian
President Hafez Assad and Arafat to bridge a 6-year-old rift that
has long been a key obstacle to Arab unity.
   The Syrian action could signal a new era in relations with the
PLO. Although earlier reconciliation efforts have collapsed, the
release indicated a stronger Syrian commitment to improving
relations than in the past.
   Damascus has been increasingly isolated politically since the end
of the Iran-Iraq war, in which it backed Persian Iran against Arab
Iraq. The war ended with a U.N.-mediated cease-fire Aug. 20.
   Syria has also been bogged down fighting the Christians in
Lebanon. Damascus entered that country's civil war under a 1976
peacekeeping mandate but later sided with the Moslem Druse militias.
   The Syrians have held some 2,000 Palestinians and members of the
Sunni fundamentalist Tawhid since 1983. Tawhid is based in Tripoli
and has long been allied with Arafat.
   The Palestinians were mainly rounded up in Syria after Assad
split with Arafat and expelled him from his headquarters in Damascus.
   The Syrians had alleged that Arafat's efforts to negotiate with
Israel betrayed the Arab cause. Arafat said the Syrians tried to
assassinate him.
   Among the Palestinians held was Arafat's representative in
Damascus, Mohammad Amali. It was not known whether he was among
those freed.
   It was not known where the released Palestinians went from
Tripoli. But it was likely they would move on to Tunis, the PLO
headquarters, or possibly to PLO guerrilla bases in North Yemen.
   Syria has been under increasing pressure from the Soviet Union
and moderate Arabs to reconcile with Arafat.
   They made an effort to patch up their differences last year after
Arafat's military commander, Khalil al-Wazir, better known as Abu
Jihad, was assassinated.
   But that attempt foundered because of the deep-rooted hostility
between the two sides.
   The worldwide support Arafat has gained from the 18-month-old
Palestinian uprising in the Israeli-occupied West Bank and Gaza
Strip, and his diplomatic successes since launching his peace
initiative with Israel, widened the gulf.
   Assad has long sought to depose Arafat and wrest control of the
Palestinian cause to bolster his prestige in the Arab world and his
bargaining power in any negotiations with Israel.
   Assad and Arafat met on the sidelines of the Arab summit in
Casablanca, Morocco, in May. Both sides sought to play down the
sessions following the failure of last year's rapprochement attempt.
   However, informed Palestinian sources said Arafat insisted Assad
free the Palestinians as a sign of Syria's good will.

<TEXT>
   Romania summoned Hungary's ambassador to
protest what it said were fascist and anti-Romanian comments made
during the reburial of Hungarian leader Imre Nagy, who led the 1956
revolution against Soviet rule.
   The government issued its protest Saturday to Hungarian
Ambassador Pal Szuts in Bucharest, the Romanian capital, the
Romanian state-run Agerpres news agency said Sunday.
   The protest is certain to increase friction between the two
Warsaw Pact nations. Relations already have been seriously strained
by alleged discrimination against Romania's ethnic Hungarians.
   Nagy's reburial in Budapest on Friday ``turned into a
manifestation clearly fascist, anti-socialist in nature, aimed
against the Hungarian Socialist Workers' Party, against ...
communism and the Warsaw Treaty,'' said the report.
   The government of President Nicolae Ceausescu was apparently
galled by the participation at the funeral ceremony of several
Romanian refugees.
   Nagy and four of his closest associates were solemnly reburied at
Budapest's Rakoskeresztur cemetery in the same plot where their
bodies had been dumped following their executions in 1958.
   The reburial was hugely symbolic for Hungary, which has embarked
on a series of democratic reforms and has rehabilitated Nagy's image
in the process. The revolt he led was crushed by Soviet troops.
   While Hungary has become increasingly liberal, Romanian remains
among the most hardline of the East bloc nations.
   Thousands of Romanians and ethnic Hungarian citizens of Romania
have fled the country to escape alleged political persecution and
worsening economic hardships.
   Agerpres said heads of diplomatic missions of ``certain
countries'' were ``received'' at the foreign ministry in Bucharest
and informed of the Romanian protest,
   Romanian citizens, including ethnic Hungarians, voiced ``their
profound indignation at the revisionist ... and anti-communist
manifestation held ... (during the) reburial of some Hungarian
citizens,'' the official report said.
   Agerpres said Romanian newspapers, radio and television stations
had received ``many letters and phone calls'' from angered citizens.
   There was no immediate comment from Hungary and the Hungarian
ambassador's response during the meeting was not known.

<HEAD>House Chairman Calls GOP Ethics Wars Tactics ``Immensely Distasteful''</HEAD>

<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Combative tactics adopted by Republicans to
wage Capitol Hill's ethics wars are distasteful and demeaning to
lawmakers, a House committee chairman said Sunday.
   ``This is not a new tactic for Mr. Atwater and its not a new
tactic for a lot of other Republicans,'' declared House Energy and
Commerce Committee Chairman John Dingell, D-Mich., on ABC's ``This
Week With David Brinkley.''
   His remark came in response to a question about the resounding
support accorded GOP Chairman Lee Atwater at a Republican National
Committee meeting here last week. Party leaders called for a renewal
of ethics battles such as the ones that prompted Rep. Jim Wright,
D-Texas, to step down as House speaker and Rep. Tony Coelho,
D-Calif., to resign from the House in recent days.
   ``The Democrats keep on winning and winning the Congress in spite
of this kind of campaign,'' Dingle said. ``I find it immensely
distasteful. I find it demeaning. I find it totally inconsistent
with the way I believe that campaigns should be conducted and I
think the American people will react adversely to it.''
   Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell, D-Maine, said on the same
program that ``the most effective response to irresponsible words is
responsible action.''
   ``If we pass a clean air act and minimum wage and child care that
will be the most effective thing we can do to respond to people like
Mr. Atwater,'' Mitchell said.
   House Speaker Thomas S. Foley, D-Wash., however, in an appearance
on NBC's ``Meet the Press,'' said he believes President Bush and the
bulk of congressional Republicans want bipartisan harmony more than
ethics skirmishing.
   ``I really don't think the warpath party is the majority of the
Republican Party,'' he said. He shrugged off the support for Atwater
among state chairmen at the Republican National Committee members
last week. ``Very frankly, I don't think the state chairmen
represent the rank and file of Republicans or the Congress,
certainly not the majority of the Democratic Party.
   ``And I think that members of Congress this week, both Republican
and Democratic ranks, showed themselves to want to get back to
constructive legislation,'' Foley said. ``I think that's the new
mood that's going to dominate.''
   He said the national committee ``includes some state chairmen, I
assume, who are more aggressive, more anxious for combat. My view is
that they're not typical of the members of the Senate or of the
House Republican ranks.''
   ``I believe presidents are high-minded,'' Foley said. ``I believe
this one wants to achieve specific goals for the American people.''
   He said efforts to compromise on legislative issues ``can and
will be carried out without the bitter recriminations and personal
attacks of the past, in my judgement.''

children, whom you will meet before God,'' Mohammed Yehia Ali Saeed
Faqihi, a Saudi national, said in front of the crowd, the daily

   In accordance with Islamic law enforced in Saudi Arabia, the
death penalty against Mohammed Shera'ie was revoked, the newspaper
said.
   Shera'ie murdered the woman, her son and her daughter without any
apparent motive, the newspaper said.
   It said the execution was taking place in a public square after
the Friday Moslem sabbath prayers in southwest Jizzan, the paper
said.
   Islamic law prescribes beheading for convicted murderers, stoning
for adulterers and cutting off the hands of thieves.

<HEAD>Vice President Turns up Rhetoric on Second Foray to Central America</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RITA BEAMISH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   With no particular new policy to push, Vice
President Dan Quayle used his recent trip Central America to
dispense hardline rhetoric and display a more experienced U.S.
leader than the novice who met the Latin presidents four months ago.
   Quayle was well briefed for his three-day tour of Guatemala,
Honduras, Costa Rica and El Salvador where his mission was to
underline existing U.S. policies. He focused on finding ways to
criticize Panama's ruling Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega and
Nicaragua's leftist Sandinista government while singing the praises
of the democratic governments in the four countries he visited.
   He also made points with a consultative approach that went over
well in a region accustomed to a more dogmatic tradition from their
northern neighbor.
   ``It's not just the Reagan administration Rambo _ gung-ho guy
going around the world just firing machine guns. It's someone that
is willing to engage in dialogue and wants to know what the rest of
the world thinks,'' said Francisco Aguilar Urbina, adviser to Costa
Rica's President Oscar Arias.
   Quayle was attentive and ``inquiring,'' he said, adding, ``It's a
different Dan Quayle,'' than the brand new vice president who met
the Latin heads of state for the first time at the Venezuelan
inauguration in early February.
   ``He may not be the foreign affairs expert that anyone would
expect to come, but he sure gives a good impression,'' said Urbina.
   Still, Quayle publicly upbraided El Salvadoran rightist
politician Roberto D'Abuisson, who is accused in many quarters of
ties to death squad activity.
   Some who agreed with Quayle's message that D'Abuisson should not
embarrass his party's new president felt, nonetheless, that the
blunt admonition lacked the sophisticated tone that Latins find more
appropriate, said Costa Rican presidential adviser Guido Fernandez.
   Fernandez, former ambassador to the United States, participated
in the Quayle visit during his last days as information minister
before leaving government for a business venture.
   Stating that Latin audiences found Quayle's shouting for the
ouster of Noriega a bit imperialistic-sounding, Fernandez concluded
Quayle remains in ``a learning process.''
   Subtlety, however, apparently was not Quayle's intention.
   He ventured into new rhetorical territory that edged him beyond
public pronouncements of other top U.S. officials and roused some
Capitol Hill concerns that he was trying to make inroads for those
who would pull President Bush more to the right on Central America.
   Seizing on reports that Nicaragua was geared up to supply arms to
Panama against a possible U.S. military attack, Quayle raised the
specter of a Cuba-Nicaragua-Panamana ``axis'' threatening the
hemisphere's democracies.
   Quayle also vowed, without elaborating, that the United States
will always have a ``moral obligation'' to the Contra rebels of
Nicaragua.
   The Salvadoran military's recent discovery of a huge cache of
Soviet bloc arms gave Quayle fodder to accuse the Sandinistas of
arming the Salvadoran guerillas.
   Arias, in a news conference with Quayle, limited his criticism of
the Sandinistas to accusing them of enacting unfair election laws.
But Arias also separated himself from Quayle's stridency,
emphasizing the need to include rather than isolate Nicaragua in
efforts to reach peace.
   William Walker, U.S. ambassador to El Salvador, defended Quayle's
direct style in talks not only with D'Abuisson, but with leftist
political leaders Guillermo Ungo and Ruben Zamora. Quayle told them
to urge the guerrillas to lay down their arms.
   ``The vice president handled it beautifully. He said just the
right things. He certainly wasn't inexperienced,'' Walker said. He
called the trip successful, saying, ``It wasn't a spectacular
breakthrough. It wasn't supposed to be that.''
   The trip's initial purpose was a show of support for President
Alfredo Cristiani's new government in El Salvador, with friendship
stops in the three other U.S.-backed Central American democracies.
   But just before Quayle left last week, President Bush told him to
step up the focus on Panama, an administration official said.
   There is some administration concern that the Organization of
American States might go too soft on Noriega in its effort to
mediate a transfer of power from him to an elected government, said
the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
   Quayle emphasized _ especially with the Guatemalan foreign
minister who is a member of the OAS mediating team _ that the United
States wants Noriega to leave his country and would look unfavorably
on any resolution allowing him to stay even if he relinquished power.
   The trip also solidified Quayle's personal relationships with the
Latin leaders, who observed a more knowledgeable Quayle than the one
they met at the inauguration of Venezuela's new president Carlos
Andres Perez.
   ``I noticed the difference,'' said Fernandez. ``In Caracas, he
seemed to be astonished, meeting new people. Now he seems more
relaxed. He pays a lot of attention. He concentrates very much.''

   Calling a sudden election must, at the
time, have looked like a ``stroke'' _ one of those cunning,
bolt-from-the-blue moves that occasionally enliven Irish politics.
   It became a self-inflicted wound that, Prime Minister Charles
Haughey acknowledges, may prove fatal to his hold on power.
   Haughey needed to gain three seats to claim a majority. Instead,
when the results were completed Saturday, he had lost three.
   The man known as the canniest Irish politico of his time said he
would stand again as the Fianna Fail party's candidate for prime
minster, and he said he expected to win.
   ``Reasonably certain,'' he qualified in the next breath.
   ``Quite simply, his political judgment is now in question and,
with it, the wider matter of his general competence as leader,''
John A. Murphy, a professor of history at Cork University, wrote in
the Sunday Independent.
   Fianna Fail, said James Downey, editor of the New Nation
magazine, may now have to accept that it is just another party, not
the ``warriors of destiny'' as it claims in its name.
   Haughey, 63, three times prime minister of Ireland, entered the
legislature in 1957 when the party's founder, Eamon de Valera, was
prime minister.
   ``Whenever I wanted to know what the Irish people wanted,'' de
Valera said in 1922, ``I had only to examine my own heart and it
told me straight off what the Irish people wanted.''
   Haughey examined the opinion polls, which showed him as the
darling of 54 percent of the voters in February, and concluded that
the people wanted to give him a majority in the Dail, or parliament.
   Inflation was low, unemployment had declined, interest rates were
moderate and, Fianna Fail strategists figured, the opposition had no
heart for an election.
   ``It was a kind of stroke and one so synonymous with politics a
la Fianna Fail,'' James Morrissey wrote in the Sunday Independent.
``But like so many strokes, it simply didn't work.''
   When the politicians hit the doorsteps for the three-week
campaign, they found the voters angry about cuts in the health
service, peeved about having to buy a license to fish, and receptive
to the programs of the left.
   The Labor Party and the Workers Party were the big gainers in the
election, adding seven seats to a combined total of 22, plus the
likely support of one Democratic Socialist and Ireland's first Green
Party legislator.
   But the balance of power lay where it always has: with Fianna
Fail, 77 seats, and Fine Gael, 55 seats. Low-level negotiations
about forming a government _ something both sides had sworn last
week they would not do with the other _ began Sunday.
   Beyond the issues, Haughey's reputation may have been a bar to a
majority.
   ``There hovers around him the aura of deals and strokes
contributing to popular cynicism about politicians,'' Murphy wrote.
   It was an old doubt.
   When Haughey was making his successful run for Fianna Fail leader
in 1979, Fine Gael leader Garret FitzGerald spoke of Haughey's
``flawed pedigree.''
   ``His motives can be judged ultimately only by God,'' FitzGerald
said in the Dail, ``but we cannot ignore ... that these motives have
been widely impugned, most notably but by no means exclusively by
people within his own party. They and others ... have attributed to
him an overweening ambition ... a wish to dominate, even to own, the
state.''
   Haughey acknowledged those doubts after winning the 1987
election. ``I've been around so long now they know I don't eat
babies,'' he said.
   Tom MacIntyre, writing in The Irish Press, concluded that Haughey
has succeeed in politics ``because he is a rogue, ... because it
speaks to the rogue in us.''
   ``We want the rogue in charge,'' McIntyre concluded, ``but we
don't want the rogue that much in charge.''

   A moderate earthquake shook Puerto
Rico on Sunday, but no injuries or damage were reported by the Civil
Defense.
   Seismologist William McCann, of the the U.S. Geological Survey
Office at the University of Puerto Rico, said the quake occured just
after 10 a.m.
   McCann said instruments recorded a 4.8 magnitude on the Richter
scale. The epicenter was 120 miles southwest of San Juan in the Mona
Passage, which divides Puerto Rico and Hispaniola island.
   Puerto Rico Civil Defense Director Heriberto Acevedo said the
agency had no reports of injury or damages.
   Mona Passage is a high seismic zone registering some 2,000 small
tremors a year.
   The Richter scale is a measure of ground motion as recorded on
seismographs.
   An earthquake of 3.5 on the Richter scale can cause slight damage
in the local area, 4 moderate damage, 5 considerable damage, 6
severe damage.

<HEAD>Army Says Coup Plotters Arrested In Sudan</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Supporters of former President Gaafar
Nimeiri were arrested Sunday for plotting to overthrow the
government, the army announced.
   The army's statement did not say whether the unspecified number
of soldiers and civilians it arrested had tried to carry out their
plan.
   The capital was calm Sunday, and there was no sign of military
activity. No soldiers were deployed in the city center or around
major buildings.
   The civilian government of Prime Minister Sadek Mahdi issued no
statement.
   Earlier Sunday, 2,000 people calling for a return to military
rule demonstrated in central Khartoum. However, there was no
immediate indication the protest and the arrests were related.
   The communique from the Sudanese Armed Forces General Command
said further details on coup plotters would be announced later. The
statement emphasized that the army remained united and ``would
continue to protect the present democratic regime which has been the
choice of the Sudanese people.''
   Military sources identified the leader of the alleged
conspirators as Sadek Abdel-Aziz, an officer from the army's Armored
Corps Division. The sources, who demanded anonymity, refused to give
his rank.
   After 16 years as president, the pro-Western Nimeiri was
overthrown by the military on April 26, 1985 after a widespread
civil disobedience campaign. The coup occurred as Nimeiri was
returning from the United States, and he was given political asylum
in Egypt as long as he refrained from political activities.
   Mahdi came to power one year later in parliamentary elections,
but his weak coalition government has failed to significantly
improve Sudan's ailing economy or end the 6-year-old civil war in
the south.
   In a rare interview with The Associated Press in Cairo earlier
this month, Nimeiri called on the Sudanese people to overthrow
Mahdi's government, which he described as a ``government of
thieves,'' to pave the way for his return.
   Despite warnings from the Egyptian government that he was
violating the conditions of his asylum, Nimeiri said he sent tapes
and printed speeches to Sudan last month, accusing Mahdi of causing
the country's problems.
   Nimeiri also told a Sudanese biweekly last week that he would be
returning to Sudan ``within a couple of weeks'' and that his
supporters inside the Sudanese army and the government would help
return him to power.
   Sudanese complain bitterly about Mahdi's failure to solve their
problems, and sometimes suggest that Nimeiri's regime was better.
   Mahdi last year accused Nimeiri's supporters of trying to
overthrow the goverment. Nimeiri acknowdleges only that he sent
tapes to Sudan urging the people to overthtrow the government last
month and in 1985.

   An Afghan airliner crashed in eastern Iran
on Sunday when the pilot tried to land it during a struggle with
three armed hijackers, Iranian media reported. Four people were
reported killed.
   The Soviet-built Antonov AN-26 bent in two and flipped over after
it hit a sand dune near the Iranian border town of Zabol, the
official Islamic Republic News Agency reported.
   It said 34 people were injured, including the pilot and co-pilot.
The agency quoted the Zabol governor, M. Kazemi, as saying a woman
and three children were dead.
   Kazemi said the plane entered Iranian air space about 30 minutes
before the 1:30 p.m. crash but made no radio contact with the Zabol
control tower, according to the Iranian news agency, monitored in
Nicosia.
   Afghan authorities gave a conflicting report, saying 24
passengers had been freed during the hijacking and 12 were being
kept as hostages.
   ``We do not know the demands of the kidnappers or even their
identities,'' said Mohammad Nabi Amani, a spokesman for
Afghanistan's Ariana Airlines.
   Amani had no information on the Iranian report the aircraft had
crashed.
   Amani said the Ariana Airlines plane was on a domestic flight to
the western border city of Zaranj when it was hijacked to Zabol.
   State-run Radio Kabul reported from Afghanistan that there were
35 passengers and five crew members aboard the 40-seat aircraft.
   State-run Tehran television, monitored in Nicosia, identified the
pilot of the aircraft as Mirvis Paktia.
   The news agency quoted passengers in the hospital as saying the
pilot wrestled with the hijackers.
   ``He lost control of the plane and that led to its crash,'' the
report said.
   Radio Kabul said there were three hijackers but gave no other
details of the incident. The Iranian reports did not say what
happened to the hijackers.
   Zabol is 700 miles southeast of Tehran in Sistan-Baluchistan
province.
   Deputy Prime Minister Alireza Moayyeri went to Zabol on
instructions from Prime Minister Hussein Musavi to investigate the
incident, the Iranian news agency said.

<HEAD>Head of Catholic Bishops Accuses Protestant Groups Of `Deceptive'
Recruiting</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID BRIGGS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SOUTH ORANGE, N.J. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The president of the National
Conference of Catholic Bishops charged that some of the nation's
largest Protestant denominations have a plan for proselytizing
Hispanic Catholics into their churches ``in a very deceptive way.''
   The charge was made by Archbishop John L. May of St. Louis, who
commented in a news conference Saturday evening and then elaborated
on them later in an interview during the bishops' annual spring
meeting at Seton Hall University.
   May mentioned the Southern Baptist Convention.
   ``I think that's an unfair statement,'' the Rev. Daniel Vestal,
pastor at Dunwoody Baptist Church in Atlanta and the unsuccessful
candidate last week for the presidency of the 14.5 million-member
Southern Baptist Conference, said Sunday.
   ``I can't speak for all Protestant groups but I know the Southern
Baptists offer a message of hope and redemption. That attracts
people regardless of race,'' Vestal said.
   Jay Strack, president of the Conference of Southern Baptist
Evangelists; Stan Hastey, executive director of the Southern Baptist
Alliance, a moderate group within the demonination, did not
immediate return telephone calls left with their offices Sunday
morning seeking comment.
   At their annual spring meeting, held at Seton Hall University
this weekend, the bishops voted to emphasize evangelization in their
celebration of the fifth centenary of European explorers'
introduction of Roman Catholic faith in the Americas in 1992 and to
start work on a document to give black Catholics a greater role in
the church.
   Minority membership of the Catholic Church is growing. A wave of
immigrants from Spanish-speaking nations and a relatively high birth
rate have made Hispanics the fastest-growing group of U.S.
Catholics, making up an estimated third of the 53 million-member
denomination. In part because of immigration from the West Indies
and Haiti, the number of black Catholics has risen from 900,000 to 2
million in the past 20 years.
   However, church officials say conservative Protestant groups are
increasingly wooing minority Catholics.
   May said fundamentalist churches have ``a very clearly fashioned
plan to entice people away from the church in a very deceptive way.''
   He said some fundamentalist churches go so far as to feature
Catholic art and music in their churches to draw Hispanics in, and
then start teaching anti-Catholic doctrines to keep the new converts
from returning to Catholicism.
   In a report to the bishops, the Rev. Allan Figueroa Deck, a
theologian and specialist in Hispanic studies, said one national
study has found at least 60,000 Hispanics leave the church each
year, and a million have left in the past 15 years.
   Catholic officials also admit the church has driven some minority
members away through apathy and insensitivity.
   Deck said that while Hispanic Catholics struggle to be noticed in
the Catholic Church, evangelical sects are providing numerous
Spanish-speaking ministers and small churches ``especially
appropriate for immigrants who need all the personal communal
support they can get.''
   ``We've been developing leadership among these racial groups,''
said Vestal of the Baptists. ``It's a fact that churches grow when
they are led by people from their own culture.''
   ``The Southern Baptists are very effective in promoting
leadership within ethnic or racial groups,'' Vestal said.
   In a pastoral statement by the Bishops' Committee on Black
Catholics, the nation's 13 black prelates said there is a serious
attrition of black Catholics from the church.
   Sister Thea Bowman of Canton, Miss., a black nun, said in an
emotional appeal to the bishops that black Catholics sometimes feel
``like a motherless child'' in the church.
   The pastoral statement proposed by the black bishops, drawn up in
response to a National Black Catholic Pastoral Plan devised by 1,500
black Catholics at a 1987 congress in Washington, calls for giving
blacks more positions of responsibility and integrating
African-American cultural symbols into liturgies and churches.
   After two days of business meetings, the bishops spent Sunday
largely in religious observances, gathering for morning and evening
prayers and concelebrating Mass at Sacred Heart Cathedral in Newark.
The bishops were scheduled to meet in excutive session Monday to
conclude the four-day meeting.

   A death row inmate facing a predawn
execution for a Reno murder continued to reject available appeals
Sunday amid controversy over his 11th-hour admission to other
killings.
   William Paul Thompson, 52, said he could see guards preparing the
death chamber only 10 feet away from his cell.
   ``I'm looking at the car they're fixing to take me home in,'' he
said of the death chamber. ``They're gassing it up now.''
   Thompson told The Associated Press on Saturday, in the only
interview he granted, that he killed six people, including the
contract murder of a federal prosecutor in Oklahoma in 1983.
   In Tulsa, Okla., U.S. Attorney Tony Graham said he wasn't aware
of any prosecutor in the state who had disappeared or was killed in
1983. Graham said Thompson's statement sounds ``somewhat
preposterous'' and he didn't intend to investigate the claim.
   Said Bill Price, who recently stepped down as U.S. attorney in
Oklahoma City, said, ``If a federal prosecutor had been killed in
Oklahoma, I would definitely know about it. That (claim) is
categorically false.''
   Thompson declined further interviews, prison officials said.
   No reviews by the Nevada Pardons Board or state Supreme Court
were planned following Thompson's statement Wednesday in Washoe
County District Court insisting that he die for killing a man in
Reno.
   And no 11th-hour petitions were likely from the federal public
defender or the American Civil Liberties Union, although assistant
federal defender Pat Flanagan said a petition was prepared if
Thompson decided he wanted to try for a stay.
   Thompson said he didn't want to stop his execution by lethal
injection because he's ready to die and might kill again if he
remains alive.
   ``They're letting a guilty man die with dignity,'' he said. ``I
never thought I'd be thanking someone for letting me die, never in a
million years.''
   He said he has found religion in the past several months and now
is ``paying back to society the only thing I have to offer it.''
   ``When you give everything you got, that should be enough. My
death is payment to everyone I've ever hurt, my family, the victims'
families.''
   Thompson was sentenced to die for the 1984 killing of a transient
in Reno. After that sentence, he was convicted of killing two
brothers who were camping near Auburn, Calif.
   Thompson said the Reno victim, ``just got in my way'' while he
was on the run from the killings of the brothers who, he said, he
shot because they were drug informants.
   He recounted a life of crime and alcoholism that started at age
12 in Texas, and said he'd spent more than half his life behind bars
for various crimes.
   He said that in 1983 he carried out three contract murders,
including the claimed slaying of a prosecutor in Oklahoma, ``for
things they'd done against my friends. I went looking for these
people.''
   The other murders were in New York and in Kansas, he said. He
wouldn't reveal the names of the victims or the people who hired him.
   Thompson said he wasn't a ``Mafia hit man,'' but ``I was
convenient, and in the trade, and they just asked me if I would do a
job for them.''
   The last person executed in the United States was Michael
Lindsay, executed May 26 in Alabama's electric chair, the 111th
person executed since the U.S. Supreme Court revived the death
penalty in 1976.
   Carroll Edward Cole was the last person executed by lethal
injection in Nevada, in December 1985, after confessing to killing
more than a dozen women as revenge for an abusive mother. That
followed the 1979 Nevada gas chamber execution of convicted killer
Jesse Bishop.

<HEAD>Iranian Leader To Visit USSR</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Iran's Parliament speaker, Hashemi Rafsanjani, will
visit the Soviet Union this week at the invitation of President
Mikhail S. Gorbachev, the Tass news agency said Sunday.
   Tass did not say how long Rafsanjani would stay in Moscow or with
whom he would met.
   Iran's state-run television said a 35-member Iranian delegation
had gone to Moscow to prepare for the visit, which begins Tuesday.
   It quoted the delegation's leader, Economy and Finance Minister
Mohammad Javad Iravani, as saying a long-term industrial and
economic cooperation agreement will be signed with the Soviet Union
during the visit.
   Tentative plans for the visit were set in March when Gorbachev
met in Moscow with Iran's foreign minister, Ali Akbar Velayati, Tass
said.
   Rafsanjani has said he will press for improved relations between
the two countries, reportedly the dying wish of Iran's spiritual
leader, Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini. The Iranian leader died June 3
after suffering a heart attack.
   The importance of the visit was underscored by the fact that it
was not postponed even though Iran is in the midst of 40 days of
official mourning for Khomeini.
   Rafsanjani, who is acting commander-in-chief of Iran's armed
forces as well as Parliament speaker, is regarded as the shrewdest
and most powerful politician in Iran. He is the only candidate in
the Aug. 18 presidential election.
   The Parliament speaker has favored expanding foreign ties to end
Iran's isolation.
   Khomeini indicated the importance he attached to ties with the
Kremlin by receiving Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze
in Tehran. Last year, Khomeini sent a message to Gorbachev urging
him to study Islam.
   Iran's relations with the Soviet Union have improved since the
Aug. 20 U.N.-mediated cease-fire in Tehran's eight-year war with
Iraq. Moscow was Iraq's largest arms supplier during the war.
   Now Iran needs Soviet help to rebuild its war-shattered economy.
   In December, Moscow agreed to help restore the giant Isfahan
steel complex, which the Soviets built in the 1970s. The complex was
practically destroyed during the war.
   Iranian Oil Minister Gholamreza Aqazadeh said Saturday that Iran
will begin exports of natural gas to the Soviet Union. He also said
that Iranian gas would be exported to Bulgaria through the Soviet
Union.

   A pipe bomb exploded early Sunday in
front of a Chase Manhattan Bank branch office in the central town of
Caguas, causing about $4,000 damage but no injuries, police said.
   No organization claimed responsibility for the bombing.
   Police reports indicated the bomb was planted in a flower pot in
the facade of the branch in Caguas' commercial district.
   It was the second bombing in three days in Puerto Rico. Another
bomb went off Friday in front of a U.S. Customs building in Ponce, a
southern coast city.
   The explosions coincided with congressional hearings under way on
Puerto Rico's future political status.
   The island has been a U.S. Commonwealth since 1952. The purpose
of the hearings, which end Monday, is to define options to be
presented to voters in a plebiscite in 1991.

<HEAD>Khamenei Says Anti-Americanism Must Continue</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NICOSIA, Cyprus (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Iran's new leader, President Ali Khamenei,
said Sunday that Iran's policy of hostility toward the United States
must continue, state-run Tehran radio reported.
   Speaking on a broadcast monitored in Nicosia, Khamenei said that
Iran had won respect for standing up to the United States, ``that
global bully and ruffian.''
   He said anti-Americanism was a legacy of the late Iranian leader
Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini and should be honored.
   Khamenei mocked the close ties between the United States and the
late Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, who was toppled in Khomeini's
Islamic revolution in 1979.
   ``America... used to regard the head of this country as under its
own flag, and used to treat him as its own property,'' Khamenei said.
   ``But the powerful arm of the architect of the revolution and
father of the Islamic Republic transformed this country into a
nation, which inflicted the biggest and heaviest threats against
those same bully, ruffian countries of the world,'' he said.
   ``This is the same country, but it has turned around 180
degrees,'' he added.
   Relations between Iran and the United States were severed in
November 1979 when Islamic militants seized the U.S. Embassy in
Tehran and took 52 Americans hostage. The United States froze
several billion dollars in Iranian assets in retaliation.
   Khamenei was chosen Iran's new leader by the 83-member Assembly
of Experts on June 4, the day after Khomeini died.

<TEXT>
   Thirteen-year-old Lashanda Daniels didn't have to
spend any time in the library doing research for her prize-winning
essay on the homeless. For five months she slept at a city shelter,
sharing one room with her mother and four brothers.
   During the months she spent there, Miss Daniels told only her
closest friends where she went each night. Her family has since
managed to find an apartment, but the memories of the shelter remain
vivid.
   ``First you hate yourself for being in that predicament,'' she
wrote in a composition that placed second in a citywide contest.
``Then that feeling of hate spreads towards those around you. You
find yourself being jealous of those who have a home and you feel as
if everyone looks down on you.''
   Living in a shelter was infinitely preferable to scrounging on
the streets, but it was a depressing and embarrassing experience,
said the Timilty Middle School seventh-grader.
   Miss Daniels spent some of her free time reading books at the
shelter, but she said her grades slipped during her stay.
   In her essay, written shortly after she left the shelter, she
described self-pity as the enemy of the homeless.
   ``You feel like you want to just let everything go and sometimes
that happens. If you are not a very strong-willed person, it will
happen,'' she wrote. ``You have to stick to your guns, and grin and
bear it sometimes to make your life's goal a reality.''
   The contest, ``What Can We Do About Homelessness?'' was sponsored
by the police department and a radio station and drew more than 600
entries. Other winners suggested remedies, such as more government
aid, but none wrote from the personal perspective of Miss Daniels,
said her English teacher, Daisy Droge.
   The essay was all Miss Daniels' work. A teacher typed up the
draft copy and made only minor editing changes, said Mrs. Droge.
   Miss Daniels' suggestions for the homeless include city-run
workshops on getting a job, more low-income housing and more
shelters. But the main thrust of her essay was a call for
understanding and self-help.
   ``I don't care what your situation is or what it may become,''
she wrote. ``Whether it is homeless or helpless, there is a way that
you as an individual can make things happen for yourself.''
   Before moving to Boston last year, the Daniels family shared a
one-room apartment with a grandmother in Detroit, Miss Daniels said.
She says the family decided to move to Boston because they have
several relatives in the area and because her mother thought the
city would be safer for her daughter and four boys, ranging from 11
to 17 years old.
   All of the children are in school and her mother is taking
college courses, trying to get training so she can get a good job,
Miss Daniels said. She said she hears only infrequently from her
father, who left the family some time ago.
   By the time she wrote the essay, her family had been out of the
Boston City Shelter for about a month and she said she no longer
felt embarrassed about her stay there.
   ``My mother was embarrassed. She didn't think I could write
anything that good,'' the teen-ager said. ``I said, `Well, now's
your chance to see what I can really do.'''
   In May, she learned she had placed second in the middle school
division of the contest. Half of her $250 prize went to her mother
and $70 went for summer camp. The rest was split between a bank
account and a lavish lunch with her mother and teacher.
   Miss Daniels, says she's determined to go to college and study
for a career, but she can't totally shake her memories of the
shelter.
   ``Every time my mother gets a check, I make sure she pays the
rent so we won't get put out,'' she said.
   ``It's not easy,'' she said. ``It's a good thing that you have
somewhere to go, that you have a roof over your head, but it's not
an easy life.''

<HEAD>East Germans Probe Crash That Killed 17</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BERLIN (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Investigators in East Berlin began studying flight
data to determine why a jetliner bound for Moscow crashed on
takeoff, killing 17 people, East Germany's official news agency said
Sunday.
   The Soviet-built Ilyushin-62 owned by Interflug, East Germany's
airline, was trying to take off when it swerved off the runway at
Schoenefeld airport, smashed through trees and burst into flames.
   East Germany's ADN news agency said 36 of the 113 people on board
were hospitalized, 15 of them with serious injuries.
   Among the 17 dead was a farmer hit by debris as the jetliner
roared through a field after its aborted takeoff, officials said.
The rest of the dead were passengers.
   Work crews continued Sunday to search the wreckage of the
four-engine aircraft, but ADN did not say whether passengers were
still missing.
   ``Salvage work as well as the identification of bodies is very
difficult,'' ADN said.
   According to ADN, ``nearly 100 of the (plane's 113) occupants
were able to escape before the fuselage was enveloped in flames.''
   The news agency did not give a more specific figure. It said
searchers recovered a flight recorder and began evaluating its data
on Saturday. Most aircraft carry cockpit voice recorders and flight
data recorders that register instrument readings, such as speed.
   The passengers included 11 from the Soviet Union, two each from
Italy and Poland, and one from Nepal, while the remainder, including
the crew, were East Germans, ADN said.
   ADN said the airliner began its takeoff at 8:28 a.m. Saturday but
``was unable to get off the ground even though the engines had
reached their full power, and tore about 500 meters beyond the
runway ...''
   ``The aircraft ... split into many pieces and burst into fire,''
ADN said.
   Some survivors said Saturday the plane had slightly lifted off
the runway but then slammed back down and raced across a field,
smashing trees and other obstacles before catching fire.
   Scores of passengers were able to leap though areas where the
fuselage was torn apart or fled down emergency escape chutes, ADN
said.
   East German authorities had initially grounded the country's
fleet of Ilyushin-62 airliners, but ADN said five of the aircraft
were given renewed permission to fly following inspections of those
planes.

<HEAD>New York Anti-Smoking Stance Could Have National Impact</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT BELLAFIORE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   National advocates believe New York's move to
restrict smoking in public buildings and the workplace statewide
will help them win over the rest of the nation.
   ``What happens in New York is definitely going to help the
movement across the country,'' said Angela Mickel of the
Tobacco-Free America project, a Washington D.C.-based organization
funded by the American Lung Association, the American Cancer Society
and the American Heart Association.
   With the signature of Gov. Mario Cuomo, expected sometime in the
next few days, the nation's second largest state will have one of
the nation's toughest laws limiting the places where people can
smoke.
   Of the 41 other states with some sort of smoking restrictions,
only Minnesota's law is tougher than the proposal expected to become
law in New York. California, for instance, restricts smoking in
government buildings, but not in private offices.
   ``California ... took the piecemeal approach,'' said Mickel.
``It's nothing like what New York's doing. New York is in a
different league.''
   Only Illinois, Virginia, North Carolina, Tennessee, Alabama,
Louisiana, Wyoming and Missouri have no form of statewide smoking
restrictions.
   The drive to restrict smoking has come amid scientific findings
that non-smokers could still contract lung and heart disease from
breathing other people's smoke.
   Recent studies indicate that as many as 5,000 non-smokers die of
lung cancer each year because of ``passive smoking.'' But a new
study says the toll, from heart disease and other forms of cancer,
may be 10 times that.
   Health groups said late last week that New York's impending law,
the result of a 13-year battle in the Legislature, will provide the
impetus needed to get the eight states without any smoking
restrictions to think about adding them.
   That may be a tall order in such places as North Carolina and
Virginia, the nation's top two tobacco states. Virginia, at the
behest of the tobacco industry, earlier this year imposed a one-year
moratorium on new local smoking ordinances, Mickel said. That came
after several cities and counties passed laws to restrict smoking.
   But the New York law could give courage to lawmakers in other
states, health advocates said.
   ``It really sets a trend and it gives us ammunition,'' said Diane
Maple of the American Lung Association. ``We can point to it as an
example.''
   Tobacco industry officials disagree and say other states won't
pay any attention to what's happening in New York.
   ``It sounds like wishful thinking on the part of the anti-smoking
community,'' said Tobacco Institute spokeswoman Brennan Dawson. ``I
think that each state is going to be fought very much on a
case-by-case basis. I don't think that the New York situation is
going to be any kind of bellwether.''
   The proposal before Cuomo would require employers in New York to
provide a smoke-free workplace for anyone who requests it and would
require restaurants to meet customer demand for no-smoking areas.
   It would ban smoking in auditoriums, elevators, gymnasiums,
retail food stores, classrooms, mass transit, taxicabs and ticketing
and boarding areas in public transportation terminals. In bowling
alleys, smoking would be prohibited in the bowling area.
   Smokers would be relegated to special sections of bingo halls,
hospitals, theaters, museums, libraries, shops, indoor arenas,
waiting rooms, banks, restrooms and service counters in food
establishments.
   The New York proposal would still allow smoking in bars and hotel
rooms; at conventions; and in private residences, limousines and
automobiles. You could smoke in private boxes at indoor arenas, at
private parties and in tobacco shops.

   Anti-nuclear activists buzzed around
the U.S. battleship Iowa in rubber dinghies trying to keep it from
anchoring in Kiel harbor on Sunday, but police dragged away the
intruders, the activists said.
   Eight motorized rubber dinghies and a small sailing boat
belonging to Greenpeace, the international environmental
organization, failed to keep the battleship from dropping anchor in
Kiel harbor, Greenpeace said in a statement from its Hamburg office.
   A ``scuffle'' ensued when West German marine police showed up
with ``at least 15 ships and rubber boats,'' Greenpeace said.
   West German television, in an early evening newscast, showed two
motorized Greenpeace dinghies just under the Iowa's giant anchor,
which was hovering in the air. It also showed police boats pushing
the dinghies away.
   A banner hung from the Greenpeace sailing boat, reading: ``No
Nukes in Kiel. Greenpeace.''
   Greenpeace said the Iowa may be carrying nuclear weapons,
although the claim has not been confirmed by either West German or
American officials.
   The police ``pushed off and hauled away'' some of the activists'
rubber boats, ending the protest, Greenpeace said.
   The 58,000-ton Iowa, one of the world's biggest warships, later
dropped anchor in the northern West German city's harbor.
   The battleship sailed into Kiel as part of the annual ``Kiel
Week'' nautical show that opened Saturday.
   Earlier, Greenpeace activists in Denmark tried to stop the
battleship from sailing into the Baltic Sea en route to Kiel.
   Divers and people in inflatable boats stretched a floating line
across the path of the Iowa as it steamed south through Denmark's
Great Belt strait.
   ``But the Iowa passed right through, breaking the rope,'' said
Hans Kristensen of Greenpeace.
   A Danish navy torpedo boat accompanied the Iowa through the
strait and military helicopters hovered overhead during the protest,
Kristensen said.
   The Iowa slowed momentarily as it approached the protester's
line, and then continued its voyage to Kiel, he said.
   The Iowa was the scene of a disaster in April when an explosion
ripped through one of the ship's gun turrets, killing 47 crew
members. The vessel was on maneuvers near Puerto Rico at the time.

<HEAD>Killings Of Union Members Doubled In 1988, Report Says</HEAD>
<DATELINE>GENEVA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Nearly 650 labor union members were killed and more
than 6,500 were arrested worldwide last year in a ``rising tide of
persecution,'' a Western-based trade union group said Sunday.
   The death toll was nearly double that reported in 1987, the
International Confederation of Free Trade Unions said in an annual
survey citing anti-union actions in 79 countries.
   The most brutal repression occurred in Latin America,
particularly in Colombia, the survey said. Repression of unions in
Africa continues to cause concern, it said.
   The survey also cited ``harsh repression'' of workers trying to
form independent unions in communist Romania, violations of labor
rights in Turkey and rising government interference in collective
bargaining in Denmark, Iceland and the Netherlands.
   The Brussels-based group distributed the report during the
International Labor Organization's annual conference in Geneva.
   The survey said ``working people continue to be denied basic
freedoms in all parts of the world.''
   In extreme cases, it said, activists work ``under the constant
threat of assassination, disappearance, detention and torture,''
while legal and administrative curbs on unions cause increasing
concern.
   The confederation's general secretary, John Vanderveken, called
for stronger government action ``to halt the rising tide of
persecution of trade unionists.''
   Some 500 were believed slain in Colombia in 1988. The survey
blamed the almost daily killings and disappearances on paramilitary
groups, guerrillas and hired killers linked to drug traffickers and
landowners.
   In El Salvador, more than 20 union members were killed in the
past year, the report said. Union offices were often searched and
police regularly broke up demonstrations, it said.
   Brazil offered a ``demonstration of government indifference to
union repression'' when Chico Mendes, an internationally-known union
leader and environmentalist, was slain Dec. 22, the survey said.
   South Africa was criticized for last September's tough Labor
Relations Amendment Act, described as a new move against the
indepedent black trade union movement.
   Respect for trade union rights has lagged behind other democratic
reforms in some Asian countries such as South Korea, the report said.
   Turkey's labor laws still violate many basic rights, including
the right to strike and collective bargaining, the survey said.
   Moves by Britain's Conservative government in the past year to
dismiss the remaining trade unionists at its intelligence-gathering
center, the Government Communications Headquarters, were said to be
``in flagrant violation of freedom of association.''
   The confederation is an umbrella for 142 national trade union
groups in 97 countries that represent 88 million workers.

<HEAD>Jackson Endorses Statehood for District of Columbia</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Jesse Jackson endorsed statehood for the
District of Columbia on Sunday, saying the city deserves
``emancipation and empowerment.''
   Speaking at a packed northwest Washington church, Jackson said
the district should have full representation in Congress. He did not
mention his own reported interest in running for mayor of the city.
   Saying Washington should be ``a city on the hill,'' Jackson
ticked off problems facing the district, including drugs, high
crime, poverty and hunger.
   In a speech spiced with biblical references, Jackson likened the
push for statehood to Moses' struggle to free the Israelites and
black Americans' emancipation from slavery.
   ``We should be praying, God give us statehood, God give us
self-determination,'' Jackson said.
   The District of Columbia has a city government but its delegate
to Congress, Democrat Walter Fauntroy, is non-voting. The district's
mayor, Democrat Marion Barry, has been plagued by questions about
alleged drug use and his association with a man convicted of drug
charges in the Virgin Islands. Barry has repeatedly denied ever
using drugs.
   There are more residents in the nation's capital than in several
states, including Vermont, Delaware and Wyoming, Jackson said. The
district's population is about 360,000.
   ``In every western democracy people in the capital city have
voting representation in the national legislature,'' Jackson said
after the speech. He said he has scheduled meetings on Capitol Hill
this week to discuss the issue.
   Jackson said early this month he will move to Washington this
year but that he had made no decision on whether to make the city
his legal voting residence. He has said he will not run for mayor
against Barry, but has not indicated what he would do if Barry did
not seek re-election.

<HEAD>Thieves Steal Unique Mosaic of 6th Century Roman Goddess</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LOUIS MEIXLER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>JERUSALEM (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A 1,400-year-old mosaic of the Roman goddess of
fortune was sawed out of a stone floor and stolen from an unguarded
archaeological site in northern Israel, officials said Sunday.
   Police sent detectives to Israel's airports and seaports to try
and stop the thieves from leaving the country with the medallion, a
circular portrait about three feet in diameter.
   Gabi Mazor of the Israeli Department of Antiquities said thieves
used a power saw and professional techniques to slice the goddess
from the mosaic floor in the predawn hours Friday.
   He speculated the thieves specialized in archaelogical theft and
may work for a private art collector.
   The medallion was unearthed 18 months ago in Beit Shean, where
Mazor's archaeological team is uncovering one of the largest and
best preserved Byzantine cities in the Holy Land.
   The tile mosaic depicts Fortuna, Roman goddess of fortune and
protector of cities. She is crowned with the ancient city walls of
Beit Shean, carries a horn of plenty and is draped with a yellow,
red and blue Roman cloak.
   ``I'm furious,'' Mazor said. ``We never expected to uncover such
a beautiful mosaic floor during our digs.''
   The artwork may now be in the hands of ``a collector who is
willing to keep it in his home and never show it around,'' said
Mazor.
   He said it was impossible to estimate Fortuna's value.
   `It's worth as much as someone will pay for it,'' he said. ``It's
unique, I have seen Tikha on coins before, but I know of no other
mosaic,'' he said, using the Greek name for the goddess Fortuna.
   Giora Solar, conservation director of the antiquities department,
said stealing artifacts is rare in Israel but common in other
Mediterranean countries, where security is usually more lax.
   Beit Shean, 75 miles north of Jerusalem, was a large walled city
throughout the Roman and Byzantine periods with 50,000 residents at
its peak, huge for ancient times. It was renowned for the production
of fine linens and sat on a main trade route between Damascus in
modern-day Syria and Cairo in Egypt.
   The excavation has already uncovered a Roman temple, a large
theater and one of the largest Roman baths discovered in Israel.
   Mazor said the dig area is part of a larger national park that is
open to the public in the daytime. He said the site is guarded until
midnight but is deserted from the time the guards leave until after
dawn.

   President and Mrs. Bush returned from Camp

   Bush waved as some of the several hundred onlookers shouted
``Happy Father's Day'' to him as he emerged from the Marine One

   Singer John Denver was master of ceremonies for the concert,
which was taped to be shown on PBS stations at 9 p.m. July 5 in
celebration of Independence Day.
   Other performers included actor Barry Bostwick, actress Judy Kaye
and opera singer Simon Estes.
   The concert, closed to the press, included a reading from E.L.
Doctorow's novel ``Ragtime,'' piano tunes by Joshua Rifkin
accompanied by the U.S. Marine Band and ``Take Care of the House''
from the 1976 show, ``1600 Pennsylvania Avenue.''
   Former First Lady Nancy Reagan inaugurated the ``In Performance''

   Libyan leader Col. Moammar Gadhafi said the Chinese
government prompted the recent pro-democracy demonstrations through
its political and economic policies, the official Libyan news agency
JANA reported Sunday.
   He also criticized the students who led the demonstrations that
were crushed by army assaults June 3-4.
   JANA quoted Gadhafi as saying the students should have created a
Libyan-style political system instead of ``setting up disorganized
pickets and chaos.''
   Gadhafi, in an interview with Japanese television, said, ``It is
socialism which saved China from ruin and death,'' according to the
JANA report monitored in Rome.
   China's ``opening to the West led to tendencies of imitating the
wealthy Western society and ... the opening to imperialism and
consumer markets led the people to run toward vile and unnecessary
consumer goods,'' he said.
   JANA reported Gadhafi said if China had established a Libyan-type
socialist system, with ``people's congresses,'' ``the people would
not have resorted to violence to express their demands.''
   Gadhafi did not mention the hundreds of people killed in the army
crackdown.
   Gadhafi also used the interview to make overtures to the Bush
administration.
   ``I believe that the new American administration is wise and has
learned from past lessons,'' he said, according to JANA. ``I believe
(President) Bush is a non-hostile political personality.''
   He also said he hoped Libya would have balanced relations with
both the Soviet Union and United States.
   Libya and the United States had relations strained to the point
of hostilities during the administration of former President Ronald
Reagan. U.S. warplanes bombed Libya in May 1986 after Reagan claimed
that Gadhafi sponsored international terrorism.

   An expensive showdog who understood
only French commands was found Sunday, nearly a week after he got
out of a cage at O'Hare International Airport and said au revoir to
baggage handlers.
   The 3-year-old Belgian Malinois named Korsair, valued as high as
$50,000, was found taking a breather on a back-yard deck a few miles
from the airport. Police, called to the scene by a homeowner who
thought the pup was just any old stray, used dog biscuits to win
over the pup long enough to get him on a leash.
   ``He was a little thin and has a small foot injury,'' but
otherwise appeared in good shape, said police Sgt. Roland Lischalk.
   The dog slipped from his cage on June 12 while his owner,
Frenchman Daniel Paul, changed planes at O'Hare while traveling from
San Francisco to Lansing, Mich.
   Korsair responds only to French commands and paid not the
slightest mind to airline employees who chased after him, hollering
in English.
   Where the dog has been for the past week, no one knows, but he
would have had no trouble dealing with the fences surrounding the
7,000-acre airport.
   ``He's trained to jump fences,'' said United Airlines spokeswoman
Sara Dornacker. ``He can jump 8 feet.''
   The dog was turned over to its handler, Gerald A. Rousseau.
   Korsair's owner values the dog at $20,000 because of his
pedigree, stud value and championship record. Louis Auslander,
chairman of the American Kennel Club, said the dog may be worth as
much as $50,000.

   What's in a name?
   Is the proper designation for the metropolitian area of 1.4
million people at the confluence of the James River and the
Chesapeake Bay the Tidewater? River Cities? Greater Norfolk? Hampton
Roads?
   Some wags have suggested the area's seven largest cities _
Norfolk, Virginia Beach, Portsmouth, Suffolk, Chesapeake, Newport
News and Hampton _ simply be dubbed the Septuplex Cities by the Sea.
The eight smaller cities could then be known as the Octaburbs.
   ``I think `Hampton Roads' has a nice ring to it,'' offered Arthur
L. Collins, executive director of the Southeast Virginia Planning
District Commission.
   The folks at Hampton Roads Chamber of Commerce, of course, agree,
if only because they would have to change their stationery if they
didn't. The chamber is pushing the designation for the 17 localities
clustered around the harbor, which laid claim to the Hampton Roads
name at least two centuries ago.
   The chamber chides those who insist on continuing calling the
area ``Tidewater,'' an appellation popular in the 1960s and 1970s.
The U.S. Postal Service even picked up on the moniker using
``Tidewater'' as the area's postmark starting in 1975.
   After it was lobbied by the city councils and business groups,
the Postal Service began postmarking letters in 1983 as ``Hampton
Roads, Va.''
   But there are still some holdouts against the anti-Tidewater
tide, both private and public.
   There is Tidewater Tides baseball team and the Tidewater Regional
Transit Board, for example. The telephone book lists 459 businesses
who begin their company name with Tidewater. Only 125 use the
officially approved Hampton Roads.
   ``We wouldn't change our name for anything,'' said Steve
Rubenstein, general manager of Tidewater Gook, a Virginia Beach
company that distributes gunk solvents along the East Coast.
   ``What's in a name?'' asked Barbara Henley, head of the regional
transit board and a Virginia Beach councilwoman. ``I don't think
people identify with Hampton Roads any better than they identify
with Tidewater.''
   Changing the AAA farm team to the Hampton Road Tides is not an
option, according to the team's general manager. ``I would fight to
the death because I think it's ridiculous,'' said Dave Rosenfield,
who said he likes the aliteration of the team's current name.

   Assailants on Sunday hurled sticks,
bottles and a gasoline bomb at a train bringing 500 Bologna fans to
Florence for a soccer match and six people suffered burns, police
reported.
   Witnesses said the firebomb was thrown into one of the cars as
the train passed beneath an underpass a few hundred yards from its
destination, Florence's Rifredi station.
   The train braked to a screeching halt and scores of angry Bologna
fans rushed out and smashed car windows and storefronts as they
charged toward the stadium.
   Six Bologna fans were taken to Florence's Carreggi hospital where
they were treated for burns. Ivan Dall'Oglio, 14, suffered
second-degree burns over 75 percent of his body and was flown to a
burn center in Genora.
   Several other people were injured in fights outside the stadium
and police formed a human chain to separate the battling crowds.
   At the stadium, where Bologna played Florence's Fiorentina team,
Bologna supporters threw stones and coins at Fiorentina fans waiting
outside the gate.
   At the beginning of the second half Fiorentina fans broke through
a police barrier in the stands and a brawl broke out. Stadium police
used high-powered water hoses to separate the antagonists.
   The game ended in a 0-0 draw.
   It was the second time Bologna and Fiorentina fans clashed this
year. In February a train carrying Fiorentina fans to Bologna was
pelted with stones as it pulled into Bologna's Centrale train
station.
   Florence police were questioning witnesses in an attempt to
identify the person who threw the firebomb.

eastern half Sunday.
   Showers and occasional thunderstorms were scattered over eastern
Texas, Florida, Georgia, South Carolina, Missouri, southern
Illinois, western Kentucky and western Tennessee, and from
northeastern New York to northern New England.
   Small hail fell near Canaan, Vt., and a thunderstorm produced
winds gusting to 46 mph in Augusta, Maine.
   During the six hours up to 2 p.m. EDT, all rainfall was less than
0.25 of an inch, the National Weather Service reported.
   Temperatures around the nation at 3 p.m. EDT ranged from 58
degrees at Port Angeles, Wash., and San Simeon, Calif., to 111 in
Yuma, Ariz. Sunday's low for the Lower 48 states was 35 degrees in
Butte, Mont.
   The forecast for Monday called for showers and thunderstorms from
central New York to southern lower Michigan, eastern Indiana, Ohio,
western Pennsylvania, West Virginia, Kentucky, Tennessee, Alabama,
Georgia and much of Florida; and showers in the Pacific Northwest.
   High temperatures were predicted in the 60s from northern Oregon
through Washington state, and along the northern and southern coast
of California; in the 90s in much of Florida, Louisiana, much of
Texas, western Oklahoma, Kansas, western Missouri, Nebraska, the
southwestern half of South Dakota, from southern Montana to much of
Nevada, Utah, northern New Mexico, and northern Arizona; in the 90s
to near 105 degrees in southwestern Texas; in the 90s to near 115
through much of inland California and the desert Southwest; and

<HEAD>Cleveland Balks at Celebrating 20th Anniversary of Cuyahoga River
Fire</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CLEVELAND (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Cleveland is balking at celebrating the 20th
anniversary of the day the Cuyahoga River caught fire, an event
which became an unwanted trademark and generated a boatload of jokes
about the polluted waterway.
   Image-conscious Cleveland officials decided against participating
in an anniversary ceremony this week during which representatives
from state, industry and citizen groups will cruise down the river,
led by the fireboat that battled the blaze.
   Dale R. Finley, president of the Convention and Visitors Bureau
of Greater Cleveland, says he works hard to persuade out-of-towners
to invest their time and money in the area. But he still hears
comments about the river fire.
   ``I just wonder how long do we have to go before we don't have to
continually bring up that there was a brief fire on a river 20 years
ago?'' Finley said.
   ``I don't read stories about Washington (D.C.) or from Washington
that constantly mention this was the city where Lincoln was shot,''
he said.
   But to others, the June 22, 1969 fire is indeed worthy of
commemoration, even though it lasted little more than 20 minutes.
   ``When I heard the river had caught fire, my first reaction was
just disbelief,'' said Ben S. Stefanski II, who as Cleveland's
public utilities director in 1969 was responsible for monitoring
city waterways.
   ``One had never heard of a river burning.''
   William B. Sekarek, a retired Cleveland firefighter who worked
for 17 years on a fireboat crew, said the noon blaze ``wasn't that
big a deal.''
   ``But I guess it was enough for people to try to make Cleveland
look like a jackass for a little while.''
   Oil-soaked debris was ignited by sparks from a passing train and
that spread as it burned an oil and gasoline slick. The flaming
section floated along, igniting two wooden railroad bridges.
   The blaze caused about $50,000 in damage, but the damage to
Cleveland's image was worse as jokes and photos of the fiery river
circulated throughout the nation.
   Observers such as Robert P. Wysenski, the Ohio Environmental
Protection Agency's expert on the Cuyahoga River, say the
100-mile-long river should no longer be seen with shame.
   ``I'd say the river is still in a recovering condition, but
there's been a lot of good strides made in the last 20 years,'' he
said. ``There's been a tremendous amount of money and time that has
been spent.''
   The fire forced industries along the river to end decades of
dumping pollutants into the water, and it made neighboring
communities improve waste-water treatment facilities, Wysenski said.
   And Clevelanders approved a $100 million bond issue aimed at
reducing the river's pollution. An estimated $1.5 billion in public
and private money has been poured into environmental improvements
along the river.
   Yet, the Cuyahoga still is listed as one of 42 pollution hotspots
identified by the International Joint Commission for the Greak Lakes
as needing immediate attention to reduce pollution.
   The Cuyahoga begins near Chardon, about 20 miles south of Lake
Erie, meanders south through farmland and drops sharply west to
Akron before it flows north to Lake Erie.

<HEAD>Bieber Lashes Out at UAW Dissidents</HEAD>

   United Auto Workers union President Owen
Bieber lashed out at union dissidents Sunday, saying their dispute
with his administration insults the intelligence of union members.
   Bieber, speaking at the opening of the week-long UAW
Constitutional Convention, wasted little time in his hour-long
speech in taking on the New Directions movement, the biggest
internal challenge a union administration has faced in 40 years.
   ``To be frank, I think those who say that workers don't want
change in the workplace _ who insist that the old ways were always
the best ways _ are insulting the intelligence of UAW members,''
Bieber said amid cheers from about 2,000 convention delegates.
   The New Directions movement, led by Jerry Tucker of UAW Region 5
in St. Louis, has criticized the union's administration for being
too chummy with automakers through joint worker-management programs
on the shop floor. Bieber and his followers have responded that the
New Directions backers aren't facing the reality of a changing
workplace.
   ``It is precisely because we weren't afraid to move forward and
raise new issues and new demands with employers that we have stayed
ahead of the pack on ... a whole range of areas where we have
reconized a need and worked to find solutions for our members and
their families,'' he said.
   Labor observers have said Bieber doesn't exert the strong
leadership style of his two immediate predecessors _ Douglas Fraser
and Leonard Woodcock _ and that a stronger showing at this
convention would help defuse New Directions.
   Bieber, defending the UAW leadership against New Directions
charges that it has gone soft, said the 1-million-member union
authorized strikes 817 times in the past three years, and more than
2,700 members now are on strike.
   ``So let me assure you, and let me warn any employers who may
have formed the wrong idea of where this union is heading,'' Bieber
said. ``Where our power of persuasion fails, we will use the
persuasion of power without hesitation.''
   He also said the recent cooperative agreements might not fit into
the union's future.
   ``If the joint programs get off the track or if joint programs
are abused, we're going to fix them or we're going to throw them
out,'' he said.
   In his speech, Bieber also called for UAW members to gear up for
the nation's 1990 mid-term elections, a tougher foreign trade
policy, and for corporations to pay more attention to their U.S.
workers, a theme of a current UAW television and print campaign.
   The convention concludes Friday after reports from several
committees and elections of officers, in which Bieber faces no
opposition.

   A 16-year-old Japanese exchange student
was shot to death by a man who may have eluded police afterward by
briefly holding a couple hostage in their apartment, police said
Sunday.
   Police suggested no motive for the slaying and said the gunman
was still at large.
   Ai Toyoshima, who arrived in this country just two months ago,
died Saturday morning from a single gunshot to the chest.
   ``She was very beautiful, very nice,'' said Hideo Yanagi, 15, a
friend and classmate. ``It's terrible what happened. It's very sad.
I cannot believe that could happen in America.''
   A passerby found Toyoshima wounded and dying Friday night in a
field not far from where police believe she got off a local bus. She
had boarded the bus with a friend at the American Language Programs
school in nearby Campbell where both were students.
   Police believe the gunman got off the bus at the same stop as
Toyoshima.
   ``He took her off the sidewalk into a dark park with a gun,''
said Police Lt. Jim Terry on Sunday. Terry declined to speculate on
the gunman's possible motive or divulge further details of the
attack.
   Toyoshima described her assailant to a police officer who speaks
Japanese before she died in a hospital Saturday morning, police said.
   Shortly before the student's body was found Friday night, a man
police believe was the gunman tried to steal a car outside a liquor
store.
   Cruising police officers noticed the car's owner wrestling with
the would-be thief and chased him into an apartment complex. A
couple in the complex were briefly held hostage by a man who is
still at large and who police believe was the gunman.
   ``He told us to be quiet, he told us not to move, so we didn't,''
said Jean Ann Gritter, 57, after the man had left through a window
of the Gritters' family room.
   Police had blocked off the streets and just a few houses away
were searching with flashlights and dogs.
   ``It's pretty obvious this is the same guy,'' said Police Lt.
Richard Couser. ``We are still pursuing him, but he is still very
much on the loose. We don't think he is still in the neighborhood.''
   Japanese exchange student Junko Owaki was killed in Fremont, east
of San Francisco, in February 1986 and robbed of $2,200. Two
teen-agers are serving sentences in that slaying.

<HEAD>African Leaders to Set Terms for Angolan Peace Talks</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LISBON, Portugal (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   African leaders meeting in Zaire next
week will seek an end to Angola's 14-year civil war by setting terms
for talks between the Marxist government and U.S.-backed rebels,
diplomatic sources and media reports said Sunday.
   The meeting of nearly a quarter of the continent's leaders will
set a cease-fire timetable and establish contact groups between
Angola's Marxist government and the right-wing National Union for
the Total Independence of Angola, or UNITA, the sources said.
   In a related development, a rebel spokesman said UNITA leader
Jonas Savimbi has agreed not to participate in a 10-man peace
commission and he denied reports Savimbi has accepted exile.
   Ivory Coast President Felix Houphouet-Boigny will mediate during
the Zaire meeting, said the sources, who did not give exact dates
for the gathering. They said the meeting will place either in the
capital of Kinshasa or northeastern Gbadolite.
   Angola's official ANGOP news agency said the summit will
``legitimize internationally,'' government attempts to end the
devastating war.
   South African news reports Sunday said Zairean President Mobutu
Sese Seko, a staunch ally of Savimbi, is principle architect of the
talks.
   Alcides Sakala, a rebel spokesman in Lisbon, was quoted by Tempo
magazine as saying preliminary talks could bring a transitional
Angolan government as early as July, and that Savimbi has ``agreed
to withdraw to New York for some time.''
   In Washington, rebel spokesman Manuel Mundombe said Sakala was
misquoted.
   ``It was just a rumor that Savimbi would accept exile,'' he said
Saturday.
   Spokeswomen at the State Department and the White House said they
knew nothing about Savimbi coming to the United States.
   Despite offering clemency for rebels, Angola's government
repeatedly has refused to treat with Savimbi.
   Diplomats in Lisbon suggest the charismatic rebel leader could
accept a two-year exile in Morocco, the Ivory Coast or the United
States, before returning to stand for presidential elections after a
period of transitional government.
   Previous attempts have been blocked by Savimbi's refusal to sit
out the peace process despite growing pressure from South Africa,
which helped arm the rebels, and black African nations.
   The rebels have been fighting to share power since Angola gained
independence from Portugal in 1975.
   The scheduled meeting in Zaire follows a U.S.-brokered accord
under which South Africa agreed to give Namibia independence and
halt aid to Angolan rebels in exchange for the withdrawal of 50,000
Cuban troops helping the Luanda government fight Savimbi's
guerrillas.
   In March, the rebels declared a unilateral four-month cease-fire
which Sakala said will be extended through July 24.

   A light earthquake shook the Seattle area Sunday
afternoon, but no damage was reported, authorities said.
   The 1:38 p.m. quake shook the Puget Sound area and was also felt
in Tacoma and Olympia, and as far north as Victoria and Sidney on
Vancouver Island in Canada, the U.S. Geological Survey said.
   The temblor, which measured 4.4 on the Richter scale and was 30
miles deep, was centered about 10 miles southwest of Bremerton,
which is 25 miles west of Seattle, said Steve Malone of the
University of Washington Geophysics Center.
   ``I'd be surprised if any damage occurred from an earthquake that
deep,'' Malone said. There were no reports of damage.
   An earthquake measured at 4.3 on the Richter scale occurred in
the same general area on March 11, 1988, said Don Finley, of the
USGS office in Golden, Colo.
   The Richter scale is a gauge of the energy released by an
earthquake, as measured by the ground motion recorded on a
seismograph.
   An earthquake of 3.5 can cause slight damage in the local area, 4
moderate damage, 5 considerable damage and 6 severe damage. A 7
reading is a ``major'' earthquake, capable of widespread heavy
damage.

   Nine people burned to death in a head-on
collision involving a pickup truck and two cars Sunday afternoon,
state police said.
   The accident on state Route 84, known as Alligator Alley,
occurred at 4:40 p.m. about 44 miles east of Naples, said Florida
Highway Patrol Sgt. Craig Perkins in Fort Myers.
   ``We had seven people in a car that collided head-on with a
pickup truck carrying two people. They all burned to death,'' said
Perkins.
   Another car coming from behind and trying to avoid the accident
immediately sideswiped the wreckage, Perkins said, adding that the
two people in that car were not injured.
   ``We have people on the scene right now trying to clean up,''
Perkins said. ``It's raining out there right now. We don't know if
it was raining out there at the time of the accident.''
   The 100-mile, east-west highway through the Everglades, which
links Fort Lauderdale and Naples, was immediately closed following
the accident, Perkins said. The road is also part of Interstate 75.
   The identities of the the nine victims were not immediately
available, police said.

<DATELINE>WINDHOEK, Namibia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Scores of guerrilla officials flew back
to their homeland Sunday, many after nearly 30 years in exile, with
promises to fight hard but fair during independence elections.
   Hage Geingob, elections director of the South-West African
Peoples' Organization, who fought 23 years against South African
occupation of Africa's last colony, kissed the tarmac when he
stepped off a Zambia Airways plane.
   Most of the 150 SWAPO dignitaries sang as they walked to the
terminal building at sunset. They included 11 members of the
organization's executive committee and Politburo.
   About 8,000 people had gathered to greet them, but only 200 were
left to welcome them because the plane was delayed three hours by
technical difficulties.
   The homecoming was marred by isolated incidents. A bus carrying
guerrilla supporters reportedly was shot at and a stone was thrown
through the window. One person was arrested carrying a firearm in
the demonstration. But the only casualty was a man who apparently
waved a sign of an opposition party. He was stabbed.
   Most exiles came from Lusaka, Zambia, on the same plane that last
week brought the first of some 41,000 refugees due to return to
Namibia under a U.N. independence plan.
   Sam Nujoma, president of the guerrilla organization, was not
among returnees. Officials say they have to make sure it is safe for
him to return.
   In an emotional speech, Geingob told reporters he knew he was
home when he saw police at the airport. Paramilitary police played a
major role in the war and members have been integrated into the
regular police force. Geingob said free and fair elections are
impossible until the counter-insurgency policemen are discharged.
   He said the return of the guerrilla leaders, expected to win a
majority in November elections, symbolizes ``a new dawn of
reconciliation and peace.''
   ``We promise a clean fight but a hell of a fight,'' he said. ``It
is therefore our sincere hope that the era of the bullet has truly
given way to the era of the ballot box.''
   Geingob declined to comment on the 200 prisoners held by his
organization as spies or dissidents. He would not say why they
denied the International Committee of the Red Cross access to the
prisoners held at camps in other African countries.
   ``That is no longer our problem. We have released them,'' he said.
   Geingob praised those who died in the war.
   ``It pains one to think how happy they would have been to see us
arrive here today. But I know they would not want us to mourn them
on an occasion like this, but to pledge that we shall see through to
the end what they died for.''
   South Africa agreed to give independence to this mineral-rich
former German colony in exchange for the withdrawal of 50,000 Cuban
troops helping Angola's government fight U.S.-armed rebels.

<TEXT>
   Barely 25 percent of the voters cast
ballots in Sunday's runoff elections, in another rebuff to the
Communist Party following Solidarity's triumph in the first round.
   The nationwide turnout was 25.31 percent, the lowest in postwar
Poland, according to State Electoral Commission spokesman Bogdan
Szczesniak.
   It appeared the turnout would be higher than 25 percent only in
six provinces where Solidarity candidates were in the contests.
   Initial reports showed Solidarity candidates leading in five of
the six provinces, according to local Solidarity Citizens
Committees. They had no figures from the sixth province.
   Most of the parliamentary seats being contested in the runoff
were reserved for candidates of the Communist Party and its allies.
The communists had hoped for a good turnout but most voters stayed
home in areas where there was no opposition challenge.
   In the June 4 voting, Solidarity clinched 252 of the 261 seats
alotted the opposition in the National Assembly, comprised of the
460-seat Sejm and a newly created 100-seat Senate. Voter turnout was
62 percent.
   Sunday's runoff became a lackluster contest for the Sejm seats
set aside for the communists.
   But Solidarity did have a chance to wrap up the remaining eight
seats in the freely contested Senate, where it earlier won 92 of 100
places.
   Solidarity also sought to build its power in the Sejm, the lower
house in the assembly, by endorsing reform-oriented communist
candidates.
   Solidarity secured 160 of the 161 Sejm seats open to opppostion
in the first round of voting. Only three communist candidates _
reformers backed by Solidarity activists _ received the 50 percent
of the vote needed to win.
   Of the 35 top government officials among the unopposed Sejm
candidates, 33 did not receive 50 percent. They were replaced by 66
new candidates in the second round.
   Final results were not expected before Monday.
   
   After the enthusiasm for the historic first round, it seemed many
voters turned back to daily life in economically pressed Poland
feeling they had made their views clear.
   The National Election Commission _ comprised of government and
opposition members to ensure a trustworthy tally _ reported 8.6
percent of the 27 million eligible voters had cast ballots by noon,
compared with 22.7 percent by that time on June 4.
   Solidarity leader Lech Walesa, voting near his Gdansk home, said
he thought no more than 50 percent of Poles would vote.
   The lowest previous turnout was 56 percent in June 1988
provincial council voting, but these are the first nationwide runoff
elections.
   Polish leader Gen. Wojciech Jaruzelski said as he voted in Warsaw
that putting an end to elections with a pre-determined outcome was a
risk for the communist government, but was necessary to implement
democratic reform negotiated with the opposition.
   The Polish elections are the freest in Eastern Europe in four
decades.
   ``So far what is important is that we are talking to each
other,'' Jaruzelski said.
   The communists' best chance for a Senate seat was Henryk
Stoklosa, the wealthy owner of a fertilizer company in western Pila
province who waged Poland's most expensive election campaign. He was
the only coalition candidate to outpoll a Solidarity opponent in the
first round, although he did not win a majority.
   Jerzy Majka, the hard-line editor of the Communist Party's
Trybuna Ludu newspaper said the 60-odd communists with Solidarity
backing were ``immoral,'' in a front-page editorial Saturday.
   ``The opposition is working toward making a split in the party,''
Majka said. ``It is immoral and tasteless that some of our comrades
are courting Solidarity.''
   The communist coalition did borrow an election tactic from
Solidarity for this round. The party stationed supporters at some
polls in Warsaw as Solidarity did June 4.
   A medical academy student said he was being paid $12 per shift to
distribute leaflets for the communist coalition outside one polling
station.
   Poll watchers in Warsaw and Krakow and in Bydgoszcz, Slupsk and
Radom, where there were senate races with Solidarity candidates, all
reported turnouts ranging up to 35 percent by midafternoon.
   Marek Jagielski, an engineer, said he decided it was worthwhile
to vote because the Sejm ``has a lot of say about political and
social matters.
   ``The results of parliament's work depends on who gets the seats,
so I voted for those candidates suggested by Solidarity,'' he said.
   The rallies, speeches and posters that anticipated the June 4
voting were largely absent before the second round. Instead,
attention focused on the government changes expected to follow.
   The Communist Party plans a Central Committee plenum at the end
of the month to pick a presidential candidate who will nominate the
next prime minister.

<HEAD>Secretary of State Considers Reopening ``Mississippi Burning'' Case</HEAD>
<DATELINE>JACKSON, Miss. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Mississippi's attorney general says he may
reopen the case of three civil rights workers slain 25 years ago,
which inspired the award-winning movie ``Mississippi Burning.''
   Attorney General Mike Moore said he is reading the 2,800-page
transcript of the federal trial of 19 men on civil rights charges,
and is trying to talk to some witnesses.
   ``The first hurdle we have to jump is whether the evidence is
enough to successfully prosecute,'' Moore said recently. ``Second,
is it in the best interests of the people of this state?''
   Word that the case might be reopened came on the eve of a special
commemoration of the 1964 murders of Andrew Goodman, a 20-year-old
white New York resident; James Chaney, a 21-year-old black Meridian
resident; and Henry Schwerner, a 24-year-old white New Yorker.
   The three had been conducting a black voter registration drive
when they left the site of a burned black church in Neshoba County.
They were arrested on a traffic violation and taken to jail in
Philadelphia about 60 miles northeast of Jackson, but were released
and disappeared June 21, 1964. Their bodies were found 44 days later
buried in an earthen dam.
   Murder charges involving 19 whites arrested in the shooting
deaths were later dropped in state court, but the suspects went on
trial in federal court. Seven were convicted of violating civil
rights law, another defendant pleaded guilty, eight were acquitted
and the cases against three others ended in mistrials.
   The most time any of those convicted spent in prison was six
years. Most of the 19 suspects are still alive.
   A fictionalized account of the murders and other events of the
era were portrayed in the Academy Award-winning movie ``Mississippi
Burning.'' The movie's release late last year turned nationwide
attention on Philadelphia.
   The prospect that the case might be revived arose Feb. 15, when
Moore asked to meet with former FBI agents Roy Moore and Jim Ingram.
   ``We reviewed the facts as we recalled them,'' said Roy Moore,
the FBI's former chief agent in Mississippi.
   He said the consensus was that if there was sufficient evidence,
there was no statute of limitations on murder. ``Murder is murder,''
said Roy Moore, who supports prosecuting the case.
   Ingram said the case should remain close, and that he feels the
suspects ``have paid their debt to society. The people of
Mississippi are ready to move on. It happened 25 years ago.
Reopening the case is not really going to change things.''
   District Attorney Ken Turner of Philadelphia, who has said the
case could be reopened if the evidence existed, would not comment on
the attorney general's actions.
   On Wednesday, residents of Philadelphia, Miss., and Philadelphia,
Pa., will join for a series of events marking the slayings.
   Events include an ecumenical service at the church where Goodman,
Chaney and Schwerner had been the night they disappeared. A bus
caravan will depart from Philadelphia to Washington and New York to
retrace, in reverse, the civil rights workers' journey to
Mississippi.

   The editor of a leading Soviet magazine says
excerpts from Alexander Solzhenitsyn's book ``The Gulag
Archipelago'' will be published in Moscow in August, ending a long
battle against censorship.
   Vitaly Korotich, editor of Ogonyok weekly magazine, said Novy Mir
literary monthly will publish the exiled Nobel laureate's critical
work in August and September issues. Like Ogonyok, Novy Mir takes
full advantage of President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's policy of
glasnost, or openness.
   Novy Mir officials in April said they would publish by the end of
the year selected chapters from ``The Gulag Archipelago,'' written
in 1973-76 about Soviet repression under Josef Stalin.
   Solzhenitsyn's monumental trilogy was considered the ultimate
anti-Soviet book. It challenges authorities by arguing Stalin's
reign of terror was not a deviation but deeply rooted in Vladimir I.
Lenin's concept of total rule by the Communist Party.
   Solzhenitsyn was expelled from the Soviet Union in February 1974
and lives in the United States. He won the Nobel Prize for
literature in 1970.
   Korotich's Ogonyok has a circulation of more than 3 million and
recently published Solzhenitsyn's short 1963 story ``Matrenin Dvor''
(Matryona's Home).
   Korotich, who is visiting Israel as a guest of Jerusalem's Hebrew
University, has nothing but praise for Gorbachev who ``sanctioned
all this chatter which we enjoy so much.''
   ``Gorbachev is ... the first leader of my country who can simply
call you and ask, `What are you doing? What are you writing?,'' he
said on Israel Television Sunday.

<HEAD>U.S.-Soviet Talks On Long-Range Nuclear Weapons To Resume</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TONY CZUCZKA</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>GENEVA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   U.S.-Soviet talks on reducing long-range nuclear
weapons resume Monday after a seven-month break during which the
Bush administration reviewed the U.S. position during the presidency
of Ronald Reagan.
   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said Friday the ``previous
administration left an excellent foundation on which to build. ...
There will be a considerable degree of continuity'' by the U.S.
negotiators.
   Yuri Nazarkin, the new leader of the Soviet delegation, indicated
upon arrival in Geneva that Moscow's fundamental positions also
remain unchanged.
   The new chief U.S. envoy is Richard Burt, former ambassador to
West Germany. He will lead the American delegation in the START
(Strategic Arms Reduction Talks) negotiations.
   The new round is expected to last about six weeks.
   Parallel to the START talks, the two sides also will reopen
negotiations on space and defense issues. Lem Masterkov continues as
the top Soviet negotiator in the START talks.
   U.S. officials said they will ask the Soviets to agree to try
methods for monitoring reductions of some long-range missiles. The
methods have been written into the draft of a proposed treaty.
   Neither side has indicated possible movement on three other
disputed areas _ U.S. plans for space-based missiles defenses, known
as the Star Wars plan; sea-launched cruise missiles, and how to deal
with mobile missiles.
   The Soviets oppose the Star Wars plan and want to limit
sea-launched cruise missiles.
   Burt has said a START treaty must ``fully protect our options for
developing and deploying'' missile defenses in space.
   Much of a draft treaty to cut each side's long-range (strategic)
nuclear forces by 30 to 50 percent has been accepted by both
delegations in the 10 previous rounds of the talks that began in
March 1985.
   The pact is intended to cover nuclear weapons that the two
superpowers could use to strike each other, including sea- and
land-based missiles as well as heavy bombers.
   Delegates are to begin by reviewing agreements already contained
in the 400-page draft text.
   The talks recessed Nov. 15 and were scheduled to reopen in
February but Bush ordered a delay for a reassessment of U.S.
policies. Secretary of State James Baker III and Soviet leader
Mikhail S. Gorbachev agreed last month on the resumption.
   Among the agreements reached in earlier rounds are lowered
ceilings of 6,000 nuclear warheads and 1,600 delivery vehicles _
missiles and bombers _ for each side. Outlines of a system for
monitoring compliance were also set.

<TEXT>
   Former Oakland Raider John Matuszak, the
hard-hitting, hard-living football player who played in two Super
Bowls before becoming an actor, died at age 38 of unknown causes,
officials said Sunday.
   Matuszak was taken from his Los Angeles home to St. Joseph
Medical Center in Burbank on Saturday night suffering apparent
massive heart failure, said Hospital spokeswoman Terri G. Digges. He
died at 9:39 p.m.
   An autopsy Sunday failed to determine the cause of death, and
further tests will be conducted, said coroner supervisor Lilie
Shelton. A preliminary police investigation found no signs of foul
play, said Sgt. Tom Toutant.
   Lyle Alzado, another former defensive lineman who played with the
Los Angeles Raiders after Matuszak retired, said it was well known
that Matuszak ``had a problem with drugs.''
   ``But I don't know to what extent, what boundary he crossed over
and what he decided to experiment with or how,'' Alzado told KNBC-TV
in Los Angeles.
   The 6-foot-9 Matuszak, who played with the Raiders from 1976 to
1981, was an imposing sight on the field, staring down opponents
with a black-bearded scowl before shooting off the defensive line
with great speed for his 280 pounds.
   Nicknamed ``The Tooz,'' his aggressive play and tough attitude
embodied the Oakland Raiders' spirit in the years they were called
the Evil Empire, and helped earn the team Super Bowl victories in
the 1976 and 1980 seasons.
   ``I'm just overwhelmed, shocked,'' Al Davis, the Raiders'
managing general partner, who moved the team to Los Angles, said
Sunday. ``We really loved the guy; he was our friend.''
   After sitting out the 1982 season in Los Angeles with an injury,
Matuszak retired to pursue full-time an acting career in which he
had dabbled while a player.
   ``It was a very emotional moment when he retired because the team
meant so much to him,'' recalled former Raiders coach Tom Flores.
``He identified with the Raiders more than anybody. He immediately
became one of the guys. He was off-the-wall by nature, emotional and
volatile. But a lot of that was just for effect.''
   Matuszak generally played the tough guy in guest spots in film
and television, with credits that included the movies ``North Dallas
Forty,'' ``Caveman'' and ``Ice Pirates,'' and the television shows
``M-A-S-H,'' ``Trapper John, M.D.'' and ``The Fall Guy.''
   He starred in a short-lived 1985 prime time television series,
``Hollywood Beat,'' playing George Grinsky, a huge gay informant
whose business was used by undercover cops working in Hollywood.
   Matuszak also wrote his autobiography, ``Cruisin' With The Tooz.''
   The Oak Creek, Wis., native was an all-state defensive end his
senior year of high school. He started his college career at the
University of Missouri, then transferred to the University of Tampa.
   The Houston Oilers made Matuszak the No. 1 pick in the 1973
National Football League draft.
   He played in 1975 for the Kansas City Chiefs. Before the 1976
season, he was traded to the Washington Redskins, then cut two weeks
later. Matuszak joined the Raiders as a free agent just before the
second game of the 1976 season.
   Matuszak's off-field antics often generated as much notoriety as
his play. He made headlines when he violated team curfew by partying
in New Orleans the night before the Raiders beat the Philadelphia
Eagles 27-10 in the 1981 Super Bowl. The episode landed him in court.
   In 1986, an Alameda County Superior Court jury ruled in favor of
Matuszak in a $1.5 million lawsuit in which the retired defensive
end was accused of beating up a male stripper and the master of
ceremonies in a barroom brawl.
   Matuszak is survived by his parents, Marvin and Audrey Matuszak
of Oak Creek, Wis.; and three sisters _ Karen Bohlman of Orlando,
Fla., Christine Evancy of Franklin, Wis., and Dawn Baley of West
Allis, Wis.
   Ms. Bohlman said from the home of her parents that relatives were
stunned by the death, which she said came with no warning whatsoever.
   ``I think he was very loved by his family and we will miss him
very, very much,'' Ms. Bohlman said.

   Israeli troops shot and killed two Arab
teen-agers Sunday and the body of a Jewish settler was found with a
knife in his chest and his pistol missing, sparking protests by
other settlers.
   In another attempt to quell the 18-month uprising in the occupied
West Bank and Gaza Strip, the government outlawed three Moslem
fundamentalist organizations.
   The military command said the body of a Jewish settler was found
in a deserted area between the West Bank villages of Burkin and
Salfit by an Arab who notified Israeli soldiers. It said army units
rushed to the area, imposed a curfew on both villages and launching
a search for the killers.
   Army officials gave no further information and declined to say if
they suspected Arab terrorists.
   Angry settlers quickly held protest demonstrations.
   Israel radio said the victim was a 48-year-old resident of the
settlement of Ariel, 21 miles north of Jerusalem. The national Itim
news agency identified the settler as Friedrich Weisenfeld.
   Israel radio reported the slain man was found in his car, his
pistol was missing and an empty holster and binoculars were near the
body.
   In Ariel settlers drove their cars through the streets, honking
the horns, while their leaders gathered at the local council
building to consider protest actions.
   Dozens of settlers drove to Defense Minister Yitzhak Rabin's
house in Tel Aviv and shouted ``Rabin, resign!''
   Police watched but did not intervene, according to Israel army
radio.
   Israeli said the army command, fearing vigilante actions by the
settlers, sent West Bank commander Brig. Gen. Gabi Ofir to Ariel.
   Arab reports said the two teen-agers slain by Israeli troops were
shot in the West Bank town of Nablus.
   The army said that in the Gaza Strip an Arab shot at an Israeli
officer, killing a crippled Palestinian vendor and slightly wounding
the officer.
   Eighteen Palestinians were wounded by Israli soldiers in seven
clashes in the occupied territories, according to Arab reporters.
   The Arab deaths brought to 524 the number of Palestinians killed
in the uprising that began in December 1987. Twenty-two Israelis
have been killed in violence related to the revolt.
   The Cabinet decided Sunday to outlaw the fundamentalist Hamas
movement and the extremist Hezbollah and Islamic Jihad groups. Hamas
and Islamic Jihad are the leading Moslem fundamentalist groups in
Gaza.
   Membership in the banned organizations could be punished by up to
10 years in prison.
   Hezbollah, or Party of God, also operates in southern Lebanon. It
is believed to be the umbrella organization for the Lebanese Islamic
Jihad, or Islamic holy war, and other pro-Iranian groups holding
foreign hostages in Lebanon.
   The government has nurtured some Moslem fundamentalists as a
possible alternative to the Palestine Liberation Organization. But
the fundamentalists have adopted a stand calling for an Islamic
state in the region that would include Israel and the occupied
territories.
   In a May crackdown, more than 200 Hamas militants, including
spiritual leader Sheikh Ahmed Yassin, were arrested.
   Avigdor Feldman, an Israeli attorney specializing in security
cases, said the government decision ``immediately makes all contacts
with these groups illegal.''
   In Nablus, Saleh Salah Bahsh, 17, was fatally shot in the back
Sunday, hospital officials said.
   An army spokesman said the youth was stopped by soldiers and
asked to identify himself, and ``all of a sudden, he hit one of the
unit commanders and started fleeing on foot.'' Soldiers opened fire
when the youth refused to halt, he said.
   Hours later, Israeli soldiers dispersing a rock-throwing protest
shot in the head and killed 19-year-old Mahdi Jamus, Arab reports
and Israel radio said.
   In the Gaza Strip, a 45-year-old Palestinian was killed and an
Israeli officer was wounded outside a government office when an Arab
assailant in a car opened fire, according to Israeli and Arab
reports.
   The Palestinian, Salih Subeh Magadmeh, was rushed to Gaza's Shifa
hospital where he died. The army said Israel Ben-Ishai, the
reservist officer, was wounded in the shoulder.
   Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir's office confirmed plans to meet
Palestinians to discuss his proposal to hold elections in the
occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip. The plan calls for negotiations
with elected Palestinian representatives on interim self-rule for
the 1.7 million residents of the territories.
   The meeting is to take place secretly next month in Jerusalem,
without publication of the participants' names to prevent any
reprisal by Palestinian militants opposed to talks, Shamir's
spokesman Avi Pazner said.
   The daily Haaretz newspaper quoted diplomatic sources in London
as saying PLO Chairman Yasser Arafat had given approval for 10
Palestinians to speak with Israeli officials. This came despite
objections from Farouk Kaddoumi, another senior PLO official, the
paper said.

   The late Rep. Claude Pepper's brother
criticized their niece Sunday for joining the race for the House
seat her uncle held for 27 years.
   Retired broadcaster Frank Pepper, 71, said he learned about JoAnn
Pepper's campaign announcement in his morning newspaper.
   ``I was very surprised,'' he said. ``At no time was I ever
consulted about her plans, and it appears she has been talked into
something about which she knows very little.''
   Ms. Pepper said in Miami on Friday that she would seek the
Democratic nomination for the 18th District in the Aug. 1 election.
   The 38-year-old federal probation officer was the third announced
candidate for the party's nomination to succeed her uncle, who died
May 30 at age 88. Candidates have until Tuesday to enter the race.
   Ms. Pepper is the adopted daughter of the late Joseph Pepper,
brother to Frank and Claude. Claude Pepper left her $50,000 in his
will.
   ``She was very, very close to (Claude Pepper), like a daughter to
him, and she would like to continue with his work,'' Maria Tolon,
the late congressman's Hispanic liaison in Miami said earlier.
   Other candidates for the Democratic nomination are educator
Marvin Dunn and retired industrialist Bernard Anscher.
   Candidates for the Republican nomination are state Sen. Ileana
Ros-Lehtinen, lawyer Jeff Allen and Carlos Perez, a businessman and
conservative activist.

   The 38th Paris Air Show closed Sunday after hosting
a record number of visitors and exhibitors, organizers said.
   The 10-day show featured demonstration flights by more than 210
aircraft, press conferences attended by more than 2,000 journalists
and business deals amid luxurious hi-tech pavilions of 1,600
exhibitors.
   The biannual show started inauspiciously June 8 when a Soviet
MiG-29 fighter crashed executing a low flypass. Pilot Anatoly
Kvotchur directed the jet away from spectators and aircraft, and
ejected to safety.
   Among deals announced were the sale of 20 Super Puma helicopters
by the French Aerospatiale to Bristow Helicopter.
   The European consortium Airbus reported 22 orders for the A321
and seven A300-600R planes to Japan Systems.
   The air show recorded 103,768 entrances this year, a 20 percent
increase over a 1987 record.

   Anti-nuclear activists said they buzzed
around the U.S. battleship Iowa in rubber dinghies to keep it from
anchoring Sunday, but police dragged away the intruders.
   Eight motorized rubber dinghies and a small sailing boat
belonging to the international environmental organization Greenpeace
failed to keep the battleship from dropping anchor in Kiel harbor,
Greenpeace said in a statement from Hamburg.
   A scuffle ensued when West German marine police showed up with 15
ships and rubber boats, it said.
   West German television showed two motorized Greenpeace dinghies
just under the Iowa's giant anchor, which was hovering in the air.
It also showed police boats pushing the dinghies away.
   A banner from the boat read: ``No Nukes in Kiel. Greenpeace.''
   Police ``pushed off and hauled away'' some of the activists'
rubber boats, ending the protest, Greenpeace said.
   The activists said the Iowa may be carrying nuclear weapons. U.S.
officials refuse to say whether ships are armed with nuclear weapons.
   The 58,000-ton Iowa, one of the world's biggest warships, later
dropped anchor in this northern city.
   It sailed into Kiel to take part in the annual ``Kiel Week''
nautical show that opened Saturday.
   The Iowa was the scene of a disaster in April when an explosion
ripped through one of the ship's gun turrets, killing 47 crew
members while the vessel was on maneuvers near Puerto Rico.

   A Piedmont airliner preparing for
takeoff with 97 people aboard was evacuated Sunday when a warning
light indicated an engine fire, airline officials said.
   No serious injuries were reported and there may not have been a
fire, said Larry Pickett, a spokesman for USAir, Piedmont's parent
company.
   The 91 passengers and six crew members fled the twin-engine
Boeing 737-200 bound for Tampa within minutes using emergency
chutes, Pickett said.
   The jet had USAir markings even though it was officially a
Piedmont flight, said Pickett, adding that the two carriers are in
the process of integrating their operations.
   The evacuation was ordered as the jetliner was preparing to taxi
out for takeoff around 1 p.m., the spokesman said. Engine No. 2 was
started without difficulty, but as No. 1 was started the fire
warning light came on.
   The pilot activated an extinguisher system, but the light stayed
on and the pilot ordered the evacuation, Pickett said.
   Passengers went to Tampa on other flights.
   Pickett said it was uncertain whether there was a fire or a
malfunction in the warning-light system.

<TEXT>
   Tamil rebels blew up an Indian army
truck in eastern Sri Lanka, killing four Indian soldiers and two
suspected rebels, Indian officials said Sunday. Ten Sinhalese were
reported killed in other weekend violence.
   Sri Lankan military officials said the separatist rebels exploded
the truck with a land mine Saturday in Batticaloa district, 136
miles east of Colombo.
   Two soldiers and eight suspected rebels arrested by the soldiers
were injured seriously in the blast, said officials who cannot be
identified under briefing rules.
   An Indian High Commission spokeswoman, who also cannot be
identified, said the mine was planted by the Liberation Tigers of
Tamil Eelam.
   The Tamil Tigers currently are negotiating with President
Ranasinghe Premadasa's government to end their six-year war for a
separate nation that has claimed 9,000 lives.
   In the last two years, the war has expanded to include Indian
soldiers who came to Sri Lanka to disarm rebels. At least 800 Indian
troops have died. They were deployed to oversee a peace accord
signed by India and Sri Lanka in 1987.
   But the troops' presence, estimated at 45,000, was bitterly
opposed by hard-liners in the government and the extremist Sinhalese
People's Liberation Front.
   The front said the deployment compromised Sri Lanka's
independence and began another war in which they have killed at
least 3,500 people, mostly government officials and fellow Sinhalese.
   In their latest attack, the front killed 10 Sinhalese since
Saturday, police officials said on condition of anonymity. Seven
were fatally shot at Kuliyaitiya, 40 miles northeast of Colombo and
three in Galle district, 70 miles south of the capital, they said.
   Police said front militants also set fire to 15 state-owned buses
around Colombo.
   The front has called for a boycott of Indian goods and warned all
Indians to leave Sri Lanka by June 14 or risk death. But no violence
against Indians has been reported.
   Premadasa also has asked India to pull out its troops by July 29,
the second anniversary of the accord. But India says the troops will
withdraw only after local autonomy is devolved fully in the
northeast, where most of Sri Lanka's 2.8 million Tamils live. India
became involved in the ethnic strife because of political pressures
from its own 60 million Tamils.
   Tamils are an ethnic minority charging they are discriminated
against by Sri Lanka's majority Sinhalese, who constitute 75 percent
of the 16 million people.

<TEXT>
   Greeks appeared Sunday to be rejecting the
scandal-plagued government of socialist Premier Andreas Papandreou
but denying a majority to opposition leader Constantine Mitsotakis.
   Mitsotakis, a conservative, favors less control of the economy
and closer U.S. ties than Papandreou, who has been in power nearly
eight years.
   The prime minister, speaking from the steps of his two-story
villa in the northern Athens suburb of Ekali, acknowledged his
Panhellenic Socialist Movement (PASOK) would finish behind
Mitsotakis' New Democracy Party.
   But he thanked his supporters for not giving ``an absolute
majority to the forces of conservatism.'' The premier refused to
answer any questions about a possible coalition but noted that
parties from the left would have a majority in Parliament.
   Mitsotakis refused to concede his party would not win a majority.
   ``What is certain is that New Democracy has toppled PASOK from
the government,'' Mitsotakis told a cheering crowd outside his
Athens office.
   State television said that with 55 percent of the ballots counted
the New Democracy Party was getting 45.1 percent of the vote and
PASOK 38.6 percent. The Coalition of Left and Progress had 12.8
percent with the remaining votes scattered among minor parties.
   At stake were the 300 seats in Parliament. Definitive results
were not expected until later Monday.
   However, government computer projections indicated that if the
margins held New Democracy would win 147 seats, PASOK 122, the
Coalition of Left and Progress 29, and the two remaining seats would
be split between two small parties.
   Voting is mandatory and the Interior Ministry said 85.6 percent
of Greece's 7.89 million voters cast ballots. The penalty for not
voting ranges from a fine to suspension of a passport for one year.
   Greeks chose from among 25 parties and 3,000 candidates but only
PASOK and the center-right New Democracy Party had any chance to
lead the next government.
   Returns showed Greece faces the possibility of its first
coalition or minority government since the return to democracy in
1974 or months of instability and possible new elections in the fall.
   The Coalition of Left and Progress, a new alliance of the Greek
Communist Party and the Greek Left Party, hoped to become a power
broker if no party won a majority.
   However, Papandreou and Mitsotakis said they would reject any
communist support to form a new government.
   Papandreou and his party handily defeated Mitsotakis and New
Democracy in the last national elections in 1985 and held 154
Parliament seats coming into this election.
   New Democracy had 111 seats, followed by the communists with
nine. Democratic Renewal, a conservative splinter group, had eight
seats, the Left Party had one, and independents held the remaining
17.
   But the charismatic premier has been stung by financial and arms
scandals in his government, the divorce from his American-born wife,
Margaret, and his affair with a woman half his 70 years.
   When Papandreou voted Sunday, accompanied by fiance Dimitra
Liani, he called the balloting a ``most critical election that will
decide the future of the land.''
   ``Tomorrow will be a new and better day for Greece,'' Mitsotakis
said after he voted.
   Mitsotakis, 71, portrayed himself as an advocate of a free-market
economy and stronger ties with NATO, the European Economic Community
and other Western industrialized countries, including the United
States.
   He contended Papandreou is responsible for the financial scandals
shaking the government and promised to clean up Greek politics and
jail the guilty.
   The largest scandal swirls around the collapse of the Bank of
Crete, which was owned by Greek financier George Koskotas, who is
accused of stealing $200 million.
   Koskotas, who is in a Massachusetts jail fighting extradition to
Greece, has claimed in published interviews that Papandreou and
members of his party took much of the money to finance the election
campaign. The scandal has led to the firing or resignation of eight
members of Papandreou's government, but the premier denies
wrongdoing.
   Papandreou described the outcry over the scandals as part of an
attempt to undermine his government and programs.
   Papandreou, a former American citizen and economics professor at
U.S. universities, came to power in 1981, promising to pull out of
NATO and the EEC and to close U.S. military bases in Greece.
   But now he says the country has benefited from the Western ties,
and he is negotiating a new base agreement with the Americans.
   Still, the premier has often been at odds with the United States.
He condemned the April 1986 U.S. bombing of Libya, which the
Americans said was in retaliation for a terrorist attack. His
government has reacted angrily to U.S. allegations that it is soft
on terrorism.
   Papandreou has painted himself as a defender of the welfare state
in Greece and at the same time has argued that his economic policy
is both sound and effective.
   He contends he has been acting to shrink Greece's public sector
deficit, the largest in the EEC, and notes he has reduced the
inflation rate from 25 percent to 14 percent. That is still the
highest in the Common Market.

   Federal investigators searched for clues
Sunday into the fiery stunt-plane crash that killed astronaut S.
David Griggs, a space shuttle veteran who was scheduled to pilot a
mission in November.
   Griggs, 49, died Saturday when the World War II-vintage plane he
was flying slammed into a wheat field and exploded while he
practiced stunts for a weekend air show, witnesses and investigators
said.
   ``It looked like he was clowning around,'' said Otis Barker, who
was working in his garden about 150 yards from the crash site, about
20 miles west of Memphis, Tenn. ``He'd go up, then shut off the
motor and fire it up again.''
   Another witness, William H. Wooden, was working in his yard near
the private air service's hangars. ``He was cutting up, flying
upside down and all kinds of ways, every kind of way I've ever seen
them fly those things,'' he said.
   Wooden said he heard the plane's engine stop running. He looked
up and saw the propeller-driven North American T-6 training aircraft
plummeting to the ground.
   Sandra Pearson, supervisor of the Federal Aviation Administration
flight service office in Little Rock, said, ``There is never any
initial indication of what caused a crash. It always takes an
investigation to try to reconstruct what happened.''
   Besides the FAA, the National Transportation Safety Board and
NASA had investigators at the crash site, said Peter Kerwin of the
FAA.
   Griggs, a mission specialist on the shuttle Discovery in April
1985, counted flying among his hobbies, according to a biography
issued by NASA. An astronaut since August 1979, Griggs had been in
training to pilot shuttle flight number 33 aboard Discovery in
November, NASA said.
   NASA said Griggs, a former Navy test pilot and combat veteran,
had logged more than 9,500 hours of flying time and had flown more
than 45 types of aircraft.
   Three other flights, in July, September and October, are
scheduled before the November launch. NASA spokesman Jeff Carr said
a replacement for Griggs would have to be named within the next week
or so, adding that it should not be a problem to draw from the pool
of available astronauts.
   Carr said the space agency placed no restrictions on what
astronauts could do in their spare time, including risky activities.
   ``You can't lock these guys in their houses. These guys have
thousands of hours of flying experience. They take a greater risk
driving down the Gulf Freeway in Houston than by flying. There are
no restrictions on piloting,'' he said.
   Griggs, who was rehearsing stunts for an air show later Saturday
at Clarksville, Ark., was killed on impact, said state police Cpl.
Rick Dickinson, a spokesman for the Arkansas State Police.
   Griggs was to have been the lead performer at the air show, said
the show's organizer, Robert Hudson. `None of us knew him, but we
were looking forward to having him.''
   Hudson said he was told Griggs ``was very good at flying (the
plane) and was, if anything, overqualified. And I guess that's what
shocked us when we got the news.
   ``We found out right before the show started, and we were the
only ones that knew,'' Hudson said. ``We kind of kept it under our
hat. We went ahead and we had a good show.''
   The plane was registered to Greg McNeely, a friend of the
astronaut who was to have participated in the show, the FAA
spokesman said.
   McNeeley's family, which also owns McNeely Charter Service and a
private airfield about 150 yards from the crash site, remained
unavailable for comment Sunday, according to a woman who answered
the company's telephone. The woman, who would not give her name,
said she had been told to refer questions to NASA.
   Griggs, who lived in the Houston area, is survived by his wife
Karen and two daughters, Alison Marie, 17, and Carre Anne, 15.

   Socialists and environmentalists scored
big wins in European Parliament elections, according to vote
projections released early Monday a few hours after the last polls
closed.
   Preliminary results from all 12 countries of the European
Economic Community indicated the number of socialist deputies will
increase from 166 to 192 in the 518-seat body based in Strasbourg,
France.
   Although it is still mainly a consultative body, the Parliament
could play a major role in the trading bloc's efforts to forge a
single borderless market by late 1992.
   Voters in Belgium, West Germany, Greece, France, Luxembourg,
Italy and Portugal cast their ballots Sunday. Elections took place
Thursday in the other EEC nations _ Ireland, Britain, Denmark, Spain
and the Netherlands.
   Final results involving all 7,126 candidates from 178 national
political parties were not expected to be announced until late
Monday.
   Each country elected its own deputies to the Parliament.
   News media projections, preliminary EEC reports and exit polls
gave this partial indication of the composition of the new
legislatures:
   Greens and other environmentalist parties are among the
significant gainers after the socialists, winning 18 more seats for
a total 38.
   Communist parties were losing eight of their 48 seats, but an
alliance of socialists, environmentalists and communists would
control a majority with 270 deputies.
   Although many of the gains were made at the expense of
conservatives, extreme right-wing parties in France and West Germany
fared well. West Germany's Republican Party was expected to enter
the Parliament for the first time with seven seats. France's
National Front was holding on to its 10 seats.
   Projections showed British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher's
Conservatives dropping from 45 seats to 26 while the opposition
Labor Party would increase its number of deputies from 32 to 51.
   The EEC, or Common Market, used a staggered system of reporting
results based on poll-closing times in the various countries.
Results of the balloting in Thursday's elections were withheld
pending the elections Sunday.
   Results were tabulated for all of Britain except Northern
Ireland. The returns from that British province were not to be
released until midday Monday along with the outcome of the election
in the republic of Ireland.
   The socialists, with 166 seats, were the largest political group
in the previous Parliament.
   The Parliament meets one week each month in Strasbourg.
   Recent polls have shown many of the 325 million people in the EEC
countries consider the Parliament to be little more than a debating
society, but reforms adopted in July 1987 give it more power.
   It can veto some EEC treaties with other countries, amend or
reject the annual budget, fire the 17-member Executive Commission
and delay an opinion on proposed laws, thus preventing them from
taking effect.
   The two other institutions involved in the community's lawmaking
process are the Executive Commission and Council of Ministers, which
are based in Brussels.

<TEXT>
   In 1985, Ohio voters put their faith in the
state's coal industry by passing a $100 million bond issue to help
utilities find ways to burn the high-sulfur coal mined in the region
with less air pollution.
   Now some utilities and miners say that faith and the investment
in clean-coal technology could be for naught under President Bush's
clean-air proposal.
   Bush's proposal would require the nation's 107 dirtiest power
plants _ including 14 of Ohio's 50 coal-burning power plants, the
most in any state _ to reduce sulfur dioxide emissions by 5 million
tons by 1995 and 10 million tons, or half the current level, by the
year 2000.
   Sulfur dioxide is a major contributor to acid rain, which has
been blamed for destroying plants and aquatic life and damaging
buildings. Because prevailing winds go from west to east, pollution
in the Midwest contributes to acid rain in the East and Canada.
   Utility and state officials say new technology to burn
high-sulfur coal cleanly won't be ready by Bush's deadline, and that
power plants would have to switch to expensive low-sulfur coal mined
elsewhere.
   ``It's probably the worst proposal we could have,'' said Larry
Ward, president of United Mine Workers District 6, which covers Ohio
and part of West Virginia. ``Are we talking about just eliminating a
problem or putting people out of work?''
   Along with job losses, utility officials expect significant rate
increases.
   ``We have more to lose under this proposal than any utility in
the country,'' said John Dowd, senior vice president of
Columbus-based American Electric Power Co., the nation's largest
purchaser of coal.
   AEP, which owns nine plants in Ohio, is the parent company of
eight utilities that serve 7 million customers in seven states.
   Dowd said Bush's deadlines could mean the end of AEP's two $800
million pressurized fluidized bed combustion development projects in
Brilliant, Ohio, and New Haven, W.Va.
   Pressurized fluidized bed combustion is designed to remove 90
percent of the sulfur from burning coal by churning it with crushed
limestone and air in a pressurized combustion chamber. Limestone
chemically combines with the sulfur to form a solid that won't go up
the smokestack.
   Part of those projects and several others are being funded
through the clean-coal bond issue. So far, about $63 million has
been awarded.
   ``Certainly some of those could go down the tubes,'' said Howard
Johnson, who heads clean-coal technology for the state's Coal
Development Office. ``I'm sure some of them will be available for
use (in 2000), but some of the more promising technologies are just
not far enough along and won't be ready until after the year 2005.''
   If utilities have to switch to low-sulfur coal mined in other
states, Gov. Richard Celeste said, Ohio could lose half its coal
industry jobs, based on an assumption that the plan would erase the
market for 50 percent of Ohio's high-sulfur coal.
   Ward said about 4,200 union coal miners' jobs were at risk in
Ohio ``and for each one of those, there's four or five spinoff
jobs.'' Johnson said the coal industry employs 7,500 people in Ohio.
   But Donn Young, conservation chairman for the Central Ohio Sierra
Club, said ``it's necessary to meet those emissions standards as
soon as possible.''
   ``It's a fallacy to say there'll be a loss of jobs. Look at the
impact in the northeast and in Canada. The fishing industry has
really been affected by acid rain,'' he said. ``It's a matter of
trading jobs someplace for someplace else.''
   An alternative to low-sulfur coal would be smokestack scrubbers,
which remove particulates and sulfur dioxide from a plant's exhaust
but cost millions of dollars.
   Dowd said the employment picture may not be as bleak as some
union leaders contend, because there could be a mix of low- and
high-sulfur coal, and some plants would use scrubbers to reduce
emissions.
   ``But we have a responsibility to our ratepayers, our customers.
We have to look at the least costly method of compliance. And that
will mean a reduction in employment,'' he said.
   Dowd said Bush's plan would mean higher electricity rates.
   ``We're looking at double-digit rate increases in Ohio, Indiana
and parts of West Virginia, but I can't be precise at this time,''
he said.
   Bush's proposals call for power plants by 1995 to emit no more
than 2.5 pounds of sulfur dioxide for each 1 million British thermal
units of energy they produce, and by the year 2000 no more than 1.2
pounds. Most large Ohio plants emit about 5 pounds per million BTU,
and one plant emitted 7.8 pounds per million BTU last year,
according to the Ohio Environmental Protection Agency.

<TEXT>
   The government on Sunday renewed a wage-price
freeze imposed last year in an effort to curb Mexico's triple-digit
inflation.
   President Carlos Salinas de Gortari and Cabinet officials
announced in a televised address Sunday night that the Economic
Growth and Stability Pact would be extended through March 31, 1990.
   Labor Secretary Arsenio Farrell said the extension of the
government-business-labor pact ``is a new testimony to the unity of
Mexicans to modernize the economy.''
   Under the pact that first went into effect Feb. 29, 1988, the
government froze the peso-dollar exchange rate, the federal minimum
wage and prices for government-regulated goods and services.
   Inflation registered 159.2 percent in 1987. Consumer prices rose
by 51.7 percent last year under the program.
   On Jan. 1 this year, the government began a gradual devaluation
of the peso and granted granted workers an 8 percent increase in the
daily minimum wage, amounting to about $4. It forbade employers from
passing along the added labor cost to consumers.
   Sunday's extension maintains the price freeze on such items as
electricity and gasoline.
   Inflation is not the only problem in the nation's economy.
Mexico's foreign debt stands at a staggering $107.4 billion, with
private banks the main creditors.
   The government has said Mexico must cut its debt-service burden
from 7 percent to 2 percent of the gross domestic product to revive
the stagnant economy.
   Recently the government liberalized foreign investment laws to
attract more capital. Salinas has said he would welcome foreign
capital in infrastructure projects including telecommunications,
dams and roads.
   The Salinas administration is trying to encourage foreign
investments by cutting red tape and opening up new sectors of the
economy.

   Military investigators Sunday picked
through the far-flung wreckage of a helicopter that crashed in thick
fog, killing four National Guardsmen and two Army Reservists.
   The Army and the Delaware Army National Guard are conducting
parallel probes of the crash, said Lt. Col. Stuart Tauber, a
Massachusetts National Guard spokesman at Camp Edwards.
   The Bell UH-1 Huey crashed early Saturday in Yarmouth, a tourist
haven about 30 miles east of this Cape Cod town, while returning
from T.F. Greene Airport in Warwick, R.I.
   The helicopter cut a 20-foot wide path through the woods before
crashing, throwing its doors, glass and other debris more than 30
feet. Debris was found in a 150-foot radius around the impact site,
investigators said.
   The crew was halfway through a two-week training exercise at Camp
Edwards near this Cape Cod town. The exercise includes 495 members
of the Delaware guard.
   The last two victims were identified Sunday as Master Sgt. Robert
E. Lucey Jr. of Emporia, Va., and Spec. Samuel K. May of Richmond,
Va., of the Virginia Army Reserve, said Reserve Maj. Mari K. Eder.
   The other victims, previously identified, were Delaware National
Guardsmen Staff Sgt. Benjamin Robert Greenplate, 40, of Newark,
Del.; and 1st Lt. David Joseph Hendry, 26, and Chief Warrant Officer
Hugh Bryan Pearce, 35, both of Wilmington, Del.
   Pearce was the pilot, Hendry was the co-pilot and Greenplate was

<HEAD>OPEC's Share of Oil Production Has Dropped Sharply</HEAD>
<HEAD>For Release 7 p.m. EDT; Time set by source.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SALLY JACOBSEN</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   The share of world oil production held
by the OPEC cartel tumbled sharply from 50 percent in 1971 to less
than one-third a few years ago, according to a report released
Sunday.
   The study by the International Energy Agency underscores the fact
that the 13-nation Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries no
longer has the strong grip on the world oil market it once did.
   The organization has been trying to strengthen its hold on the
market by instilling more production discipline among its members.
Sharp, planned cuts in its supply to consuming nations earlier in
the year helped drive up oil prices, leading to higher gasoline
prices for consumers.
   The report, which takes a look at energy trends over a 17-year
period, said OPEC produced 25.4 million barrels of crude a day in
1971 to account for about half the world's total output.
   In 1980, after two shocks that drove oil prices sharply higher,
the cartel's share of the market slipped to 44 percent of total
output. OPEC's production was 27.5 million barrels a day.
   Its share fell further, to 32 percent in 1987, or about 19.6
million barrels a day. Total world production that year was 61
million barrels a day.
   The cartel recently agreed on a production ceiling of 19.5
million barrels a day in the last half of 1989 to try to keep prices
at their strong levels.
   OPEC maintains a benchmark price of $18 a barrel. The average
price for a basket of seven crudes monitored by the organization was
recently pegged at $17.68 a barrel. It was $12.34 a barrel at the
end of November.
   Futures prices for West Texas Intermediate, the American
benchmark crude, have soared to more than $20 a barrel in trading on
the New York Mercantile Exchange.
   The energy agency said world oil production hit a peak of 66
million barrels a day in 1979.
   The share of output held by developing nations in 1971 was 73
percent, or 37.1 million barrels a day. It rose to 77 percent in
1979 and then fell to 72 percent in 1987.
   World demand for oil grew from 49.6 million barrels a day in 1971
to 65.4 million barrels in 1979 and 63 million barrels in 1987, the
report said.
   Industrialized nations accounted for most of the demand, taking
up 35.2 million barrels a day in 1971 and 36 million barrels in 1987.
   Developing nations, including those with centrally planned
economies like the Soviet Union, posted demand of 14.4 million
barrels a day in 1971, rising to 27 million barrels in 1987.
   ``Although oil consumption in developing countries has increased
every year since 1971, the rate of increase has been uneven,'' the
energy agency said in a statement accompanying the report, a hefty
compilation of statistical tables.
   Growth in consumption eased, it said, after oil prices soared in
the mid- and late 1970s.
   Demand for oil among developing nations ``is dominated by
relatively few countries,'' it said.
   In 1987, the Soviet Union registered demand of 9.1 million
barrels a day or 33.8 percent of the total for developing nations.
China ranked second with demand of 2.1 million barrels a day,
followed by Mexico, 1.5 million barrels; Brazil, 1.3 million
barrels, and India, 968,000 barrels.
   Saudi Arabia posted demand of 937,000 barrels; Iran, 771,000
barrels; South Korea, 638,000 barrels; Indonesia, 493,000 barrels,
and Argentina, 488,000 barrels, the report said.
   With the surge in oil prices in 1979, production in coal soared
23 percent to 4.5 billion metric tons in 1987.
   In 1983, China passed the Soviet Union to become the world's
largest coal producer, the report said. China turned out 879 million
metric tons of coal that year and the Soviet Union, 677 million
metric tons.
   Colombia recently boosted its coal exports to 10.2 million metric
tons in 1987, becoming the No. 2 exporter after South Africa among
developing countries.
   The agency also reported the developing world increased its sales
of natural gas.
   Developing countries, excluding those with centrally planned
economies, exported 71 million oil-equivalent tons of gas in 1987.
The Soviet Union exported 70 million tons in the same year. The unit
of reference, a million tons of oil equivalent, is equal to 42.3
billion cubic feet of natural gas.
   Iran was the largest exporter of natural gas in the developing
world in 1971.
   But, it said, by 1980 the nation's ``exports were negligible
while the number of gas exporters in the developing world had

<HEAD>Union Membership Approves Contract With GE, Avoiding Strike</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CAMDEN, N.J. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Union workers at three General Electric Co.
plants in southern New Jersey unanimously approved a contract
Sunday, averting a threatened strike.
   Frank Ward, president of Local 241 of the International
Federation of Professional and Technical Engineers, said the
contract calls for an across-the-board 5 percent increase in wages
over three years. It also raises top pay levels an additional 2{
percent and provides merit raises of up to 4 percent each year, he
said.
   About 500 union members from plants in Camden, Moorestown and
Gibbsboro unanimously approved the contract on a voice vote, Ward
said.
   The current contract expired at 12:01 a.m. Friday, and union
members had planned to strike.
   The union represents 700 technical engineers, laboratory
personnel, writers and illustrators. The average salary is about
$25,000, Ward said.

<HEAD>Investor Group May Attempt To Force Sale Of Chair Company</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MONROE, Mich. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An investment group says it may buy or sell
stock or seek a merger or liquidation of La-Z-Boy Chair Co. to try
to increase the value of its stock.
   The Connecticut-based group, which holds 5.6 percent of
La-Z-Boy's shares, announced its intention in documents filed with
the Securities and Exchange Commission.
   The group, made up of two partnerships _ Prescott Associates and
Idoya Partners _ may be trying to boost interest in the Monroe-based
company's stock but is unlikely to be able to force the company's
hand, said Elliott Schlang, an analyst who follows La-Z-Boy for
Prescott, Ball and Turben Inc. in Cleveland.
   La-Z-Boy's management owns a high enough percentage of the
company's stock to make it extremely unlikely for a hostile bidder
to be able to acquire a controlling interest or force a merger or
sale, Schlang said.

   Nissan Motor Co. Ltd., Japan's second-largest
automaker, has introduced the world's first passenger car with an
electronically controlled five-speed automatic transmission, company
officials said.
   The transmission was mounted in the new Cedric and Gloria models,
which went on sale Wednesday, a Nissan official said Saturday,
speaking on condition of anonymity.
   ``The additional gear is to make driving more energy-efficient,''
he said.
   The five-speed transmission models are available only in Japan,
and Nissan has no plans to sell them overseas, he said.
