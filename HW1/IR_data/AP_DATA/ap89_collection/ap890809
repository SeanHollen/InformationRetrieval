<HEAD>Engine Failure Forces DC-10 To Make Emergency Landing</HEAD>

   A Northwest Airlines DC-10 made an emergency
landing Wednesday after the tri-motor jet's No. 2 engine apparently
began breaking up and the pilot shut it down, officials said.
   Flight 308, carrying 256 people from Los Angeles to Minneapolis,
landed without incident at Stapleton International Airport
Wednesday about 6:30 p.m., according to Richard Boulware, a
spokesman at the airport.
   ``They experienced a severe vibration from the No. 2 engine,
(and) as a precautionary measure, they elected to make an
unscheduled landing,'' said Kevin Whalen, a spokesman for the St.
Paul, Minn.-based airline.
   The No. 2 engine of a DC-10 also is the focus of an
investigation into the crash of United Airlines Flight 232 last
month in Sioux City, Iowa, killing 111 of the nearly 300 people
aboard.
   Flight 232's No. 2 engine apparently disintegrated, shooting
shrapnel that apparently severed hydraulic lines in the jet,
causing almost complete loss of control and forcing the
crash-landing at Sioux City's airport.
   The investigation into the cause of that disaster is continuing.
   Boulware, who observed the damage to the aircraft after it
landed Wednesday night, said there were ``multiple shrapnel-like
holes in the outer cowling'' of the No. 2 engine, which on a DC-10
is mounted in the vertical stabilizer at the tail of the aircraft.
The other two engines are mounted under the wings.
   ``One of the holes was big enough I could have stuck by hand
through,'' he said. He said the holes were along the upper side of
the engine cowling. ``Whatever exited, exited upward,'' he said.
   He also said a service door on the tail about eight inches
square had been blown open, but remained attached to its hinges.
   Whalen said the landing was normal in terms of controlling the
airplane, and the 245 passengers were being placed on alternate
flights to Minneapolis. There were 11 crew members on board, he
said.
   Whalen said the airline's mechanics will take a close look at
the engine, and since Northwest doesn't have a maintenance base in
Denver, the jet might have to be shuttled to Minneapolis.

   A woman battling for control of seven
microscopic embryos said she worried about frozen storage ``killing
them,'' but her husband said bringing them to life was a mistake.
   The couple, Junior Lewis Davis and Mary Sue Davis, drew a
portrait of themselves Tuesday as a couple who tried desperately
for nine years to have a child.
   Their marriage has collapsed into a battle for custody _ or
ownership _ of seven frozen ``pre-embryos'' that have been in
cryogenic storage since December.
   Davis, 30, sued for divorce in February, and wants the embryos
to remain in storage until the couple decide together what to do
with them.
   ``I oppose the use of the pre-embryos by Mary or any donor
because I do not wish to be raped of my reproductive rights,'' he
said.
   Mrs. Davis says she has the right to have the embryos implanted
in her womb regardless of her husband's feelings.
   ``I don't feel it abuses his rights,'' she testified. ``He
consented to be a father and I'm willing to let him.''
   Mrs. Davis said she objects strongly to leaving the embryos in
cold storage, where according to some testimony they could not last
for more than two years.
   ``I believe that would be killing them,'' she said. ``I am the
mother of these embryos. They are the beginning of life. They are
more than just cells that mean nothing.''
   Davis acknowledged his wife has gone through physical and
emotional trauma during their six attempts at conception in the in
vitro program, which they entered in 1985.
   ``But I can't see where that's enough to bring a child into this
world where the child will have more pain than it cost us to
achieve it,'' he said.
   ``I don't want my child in a single-parent home,'' Davis told W.
Dale Young, the Blount County Circuit Court judge hearing the case.
``I was raised in a broken home and I don't want that for my
child.''
   Both Junior and Mary Sue Davis, 28, come from families of six
children.
   Mrs. Davis' attorney, Jay Christenberry, contends the embryos
should be considered ``pre-born children'' and allowed to come to
term in Mrs. Davis' body.
   Charles Clifford, attorney for Davis, said there have been
tremendous advances in helping infertile women such as Mrs. Davis.
He contends that because she could reasonably expect to become
pegnant with another man after her divorce, it is unnecessary to
use these particular seven embryos.
   Under his questioning, zoologist Alex Shivers said the success
rate of in vitro programs ``will definitely go up'' in coming
years. Testimony Monday indicated the national average for
successful implantations is 18 percent.
   The Davises said they met in West Germany while in the Army and
married nine years ago. Mrs. Davis suffered five tubal pregnancies,
one of which she said nearly killed her.
   The couple tried adoption, only to be told they had little
chance of becoming parents that way. They joined the Big Brothers
program, taking a child under their wing until its mother ``started
using us sort of as a baby-sitting service,'' Davis said.
   The trial, which began Monday, recessed until Thursday.
   Young is expected to rule within a month.
   The embroyos are in cryogenic storage at minus 180 degrees
Centigrade.
   Davis said he does not want the embryos destroyed, just left
alone. ``Three years down the road I might have a change of
heart,'' he said.
   In vitro fertilization produces so-called ``test-tube babies''
because the fertilization takes place outside the womb. The process
was pioneered in England, where the first successful birth was
recorded in 1978.
   The embryos in the Davis case were less than two days old when
they were frozen, and consist of four to eight undifferentiated
cells each, according to testimony. It is 12 to 14 days after
fertilization before the cells start to take on different
characteristics and technically are considered embryos, scientists
testified.

<HEAD>ABC's `Roseanne' Takes First in Television Ratings</HEAD>

<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Summer reruns, topped by the ABC comedy hit
``Roseanne,'' beat out original programming in the latest Nielsen
ratings.
   Two other ABC shows _ ``Wonder Years'' and ``Who's the Boss'' _
were next in the ratings for the week ended Aug. 6, but the network
remained in third place. ABC and NBC each finished the week with
four shows in the Top 10, but it was NBC which gained a 59th
consecutive victory.
   ``Roseanne,'' snubbed last week in the Emmy nominations,
supplanted NBC's ``Cheers'' in the top spot. The Boston barroom
antics fell to fourth place, tying with ABC's ``Coach.''
   Original programming fared poorly in the ratings, despite coming
amid summer doldrums.
   The NBC news program ``Yesterday, Today &amp; Tomorrow'' made its
debut in a tie for 19th place with ABC's ``Full House.'' ABC's
much-touted ``PrimeTime Live'' was in 37th place.
   The NBC summer series ``13 East'' dropped from 10th place last
week to 35th. Another NBC summer show, ``Knight &amp; Daye,'' remained
in the middle of the ratings in a four-way tie for 50th place.
   Fox Broadcasting Co.'s summertime jump in the ratings has
apparently bottomed out. ``Married ... With Children'' dropped to
38th place, ``Totally Hidden Video'' was 46th and ``America's Most
Wanted'' in the four-way tie for 50th place.
   NBC won the A.C. Nielsen Co. survey with an average of 10.5. CBS
was second with 9.4 and ABC third with 9.2.
   For the season to date, from Sept. 19, NBC had 14.7, ABC 11.8
and CBS 11.7. The ratings are the percentage of the 90.4 million
homes with televisions in the United States. The share is the
percentage of sets in use.
   Here are the Top 10: ABC's ``Roseanne,'' ABC's ``Wonder Years,''
ABC's ``Who's the Boss?,'' NBC's ``Cheers '' and ABC's ``Coach''
tied, NBC's ``Golden Girls,'' NBC's ``Perry Mason: The Case of the
Lost Love'' and CBS' ``Murder, She Wrote'' tied, NBC's ``Empty
Nest'' and CBS' ``Designing Women'' tied.
   ABC claimed first place among the nightly news shows. The
ratings: ABC 9.4, CBS 9.1, NBC 8.6.

<TEXT>
   After a two-month false start, Japan's governing
party is on another ``clean start'' to reform itself.
   The false start was under Sousuke Uno, who became prime minister
June 2 with pledges of political reform but soon was pursued by
allegations of having kept paid mistresses.
   Now another veteran legislator with no personal power base has
been pulled up to lead the Liberal Democratic Party.
   There was an eerie sense of deja vu in Toshiki Kaifu's
acceptance remarks. If he had Uno's glasses and streak of white
hair, it would have been hard to discern that Japan had a new
leader.
   Uno was clear of involvement in the Recruit influence-buying
scandal that caused his predecessor, Noboru Takeshita, to leave
office prematurely.
   Kaifu bears the minor taint of receiving the equivalent of
$110,000 in donations from Recruit Co. over five years, but he did
not receive profits from cut-price stock deals, as did most of the
party leaders now sidelined.
   That scandal, Uno said on June 2, ``has had a dramatic effect on
our party. I would like to take this opportunity to reflect on this
development so we can make a clean start in politics and regain the
confidence of our people.''
   Kaifu said Tuesday, after winning the party presidency, that it
was ``a crucial time.'' He called for debate through which ``we can
gain the people's understanding of our policies.''
   ``I want to carry out reforms and pass reform legislation based
on our deep self-reflection,'' he said. ``We must carry out
political reforms and shed our old skin.''
   Like Uno and Takeshita, and almost everyone else in his
conservative party, Kaifu said the Liberal Democrats were in a
crisis.
   The crisis appears deeper than ever, and the calendar is moving
steadily toward the next encounter with the electorate.
   In elections July 23, the Liberal Democrats lost constrol of
Parliament's upper house for the first time in the party's 34-year
history.
   Elections for all seats in the lower house must be called by
July 1990, but the Socialist-led opposition in the upper chamber
will try to create a legislative deadlock to make the government
hold them sooner.
   So low is the Liberal Democrats' popularity that analysts expect
they would lose their majority in the lower house.
   The reasons are many, and not easy to overcome.
   Despite a pledge not to impose a new major tax, the governing
party bulldozed a 3 percent sales tax through Parliament.
   When it was coupled with reductions in personal income and
inheritance taxes, the net effect was a reduction in the average
household's tax burden, but the sales tax remains unpopular. It
also produces 10 percent of government revenue, which makes
abolishing it expensive.
   Although the Recruit scandal ended officially in April with the
indictment of two legislators on bribe-taking charges, it lives on
in the minds of many who feel party leaders should not have escaped
prosecution. Among those who did was Yasuhiro Nakasone, who
preceded Takeshita as prime minister.
   The easy money politicians reaped from the Recruit Co. was
spread so widely that nearly all top Liberal Democratic figures
were tainted, making it impossible for them to succeed Takeshita or
Uno. They remain powerful, however, and voters know many hope for
future high office.
   To the sales tax and Recruit scandal, which created an image of
arrogance and unaccountability, was added the insult to women of
Uno's alleged affairs. The result was the thrashing the Liberal
Democrats took in the July 23 election.
   Takako Doi, the first woman to lead a party in Japan, is popular
and has been able to fuzz over her Socialist Party's policy of an
unarmed, neutral Japan, which is not the majority opinion. She
attacks the sales tax and the governing party's image.
   Kaifu is new and untried. He is 58, still boyish-looking, young
enough in Japanese politics to suggest a new generation and has
reform credentials from service under Takeo Miki, a ``Mr. Clean''
prime minister of the 1970s.
   He has until October, when the party votes again on its
president, to show he has made a good start on rescuing the deeply
troubled party.
   If he doesn't, Japan could be looking for its fourth prime
minister of 1989.

   The two crewmen
aboard a Navy A-6 Intruder aircraft were killed Tuesday when the
attack jet crashed while practicing for an air show here.
   The pilot was identified Tuesday night as Lt. Cmdr. Stephen A.
Garcia, 34, of Los Cruces, N.M., and the bombardier-navigator was
Marine Capt. Richard H. Andrews, 31, of Fayetteville, N.C., said
base spokeswoman Mariana Graham.
   Both officers were assigned to Attack Squadron 128, known as the
``Golden Intruders.'' The squadron is based at Whidbey Island.
   The cause of the crash is under investigation, Ms. Graham said.
   Since 1980, 12 of the Whidbey-based A-6s have crashed, resulting
in 14 fatalities, she said.
   The aircraft was completing a turn over the field Tuesday when
it lost altitude and hit the ground, Ms. Graham said. The airfield,
about 45 miles northwest of Seattle, was closed for approximately
two hours after the accident.

   Berke Breathed, whose pen illustrated the comic
strip ``Bloom County,'' plans to go a little overboard as a
contributing editor at Boating magazine.
   John Owens, editor in chief of Boating, said Tuesday that
Breathed, an avid boater who has homes in Evergreen and Florida,
will write a monthly humor column.
   Breathed, who owns four boats, said his column, titled
``Overboard,'' will reflect his consuming interest in the sport.
   ``Boating looks at equipment in the way I want to look at
equipment _ what's coming out, and why we silly boaters think that
a new-style helm station is exciting,'' Breathed said.
   The last ``Bloom County'' comic strip appeared in papers last
weekend. Breathed, who won a Pulitzer Prize for cartooning in 1987,
plans to begin work on a new strip called ``Outland'' that will
begin Sept. 3. ``Outland'' features a black ghetto child who was a
``Bloom County'' regular.

   CBS is firmly behind the ``The Pat Sajak
Show'' as the late-night talkfest struggles against reigning king
Johnny Carson and his ``Tonight Show,'' the show's producer said.
   ``CBS has just told me, `Do what it takes to make it work, and
we'll stick by you,''' Paul Gilbert said in a recent interview.
   The show, featuring Sajak of ``Wheel of Fortune'' fame, debuted
with good ratings seven months ago but has since dropped to third
place.
   Gilbert said the show has been revamped. The blue couch is gone,
replaced by a beige one. Only four guests will now appear nightly,
instead of five, a change Gilbert said was made ``to allow Pat time
to sink his teeth into an interview.''
   Most significantly, Sajak's monologue will run in the middle of
the show or not at all. ``We figure it doesn't make sense to
compete against Carson with his act,'' Gilbert said.

his audiences notice he's smiling a great deal, it's because he
loves the music he makes.
   ``I feel good. I feel like everything is goin' alright and I
love our music,'' said Marley, 20, at a news conference Tuesday.
   Marley and his band, The Melodymakers, began a world tour and
showed reporters their new video for the single ``Look Who's
Dancing,'' from the album ``One Bright Day''
   Brother Stephen Marley and sisters Sharon Marley Prendergast and
Cedella Marley also perform in The Melodymakers. The four are the
children of the late reggae great, Bob Marley.
   Ziggy Marley said his father once told him: ``On your way up
please take me up. On your way down don't let me down.''
   Reggae music is based on themes of peace and unity, Marley said.
   Marley and The Melodymakers will tour the United States, then
Europe, Africa and Japan. Marley and the band won a Grammy for best
reggae recording last year and an NAACP Image award.

   Running New York City isn't child's play, but
sometimes it makes Mayor Edward Koch wish he was a kid again.
   Koch, better known for his brash, outspoken style, revealed a
yearning for the simpler life of a child Tuesday during a tour of a
new day-care center at police headquarters in lower Manhattan.
   ``It's marvelous,'' the mayor said as he was shown the playroom
and a second room where the 35 children in the program take a nap
after lunch.
   ``Sometime about 3 o'clock in the afternoon I feel like I want
to come over and be loved,'' Koch told Police Commissioner Benjamin
Ward, who led the tour.
   ``Come over between one and two o'clock,'' Ward replied.

   Max Weinberg, the drummer with Bruce
Springsteen's E Street Band, plans to tell college freshmen about
how he found success working in a rock 'n' roll band.
   Weinberg will be the featured speaker at the University of
Wyoming's fourth annual President's Welcome Assembly for Freshmen
on Aug. 28.
   His speech, ``Growing Up on E Street,'' will cover motivation,
goal-setting, overcoming career obstacles and achieving success,
said university officials.
   ``Working toward success in a rock 'n' roll band is really no
different than working toward success in any other endeavor,''
Weinberg said. ``You have to be disciplined, professional and, most
importantly, you have to believe in yourself and your goals.''
   Weinberg's address also will include film footage of his 14
years as the band's drummer.

   Princess Nori, the only daughter of Emperor Akihito
and Empress Michiko, plans to visit Belgian King and Queen Baudouin
in Spain next week, a palace official said.
   Princess Nori, a sophomore majoring in literature at Gakushuin
University in Tokyo, is to stay with the Belgian royal couple at
their summer house in Spain for about 10 days beginning Aug. 16, an
Imperial Household Agency official said.
   The princess has traveled in Europe twice in the past, but this
is her first visit to Spain, said the palace official.
   The Crown Prince Hironomiya, the first son of the emperor and
empress, spent two summers with the Belgian couple, in 1976 and
1985, he said.

   The pies lining the two shelves behind
the counter at the Club Cafe have always been in demand. Now,
they're in court.
   When Robert McNanna bought 51 percent of the cafe in May, he
thought he was buying the restaurant's award-winning recipes, too.
   But then the baker _ Mary Allen, a former part-owner who had the
recipes in her head _ quit and McNanna sued to get the recipes back.
   ``They're not written down someplace,'' said Mrs. Allen's
attorney, Steven Oliver. ``The recipes are something my client has
developed over many years.''
   Attorneys still are taking depositions and will request a final
hearing in a month or so in chancery court to determine ownership
of the recipes, Oliver said.
   In the meantime, the 45-year-old Club Cafe still offers, for $1
a slice, 14 varieties of pies: peanut butter, chocolate, coconut,
banana, lemon, pineapple, egg custard, pecan, apple, Dutch apple,
cherry, blueberry, banana split and strawberry. And four
cheesecakes.
   McNanna says the pies these days are every bit as good as Mrs.
Allen's, and his baker, Ricky West, a 14-year veteran at the
restaurant, agrees.
   ``The pies, we have it down to an art,'' McNanna said. ``Just
right after she quit, we had it down pretty close.''
   The customers? ``They can't tell the difference,'' West said.
   But some say they can.
   ``My opinion is that the crust isn't as good,'' said Larry
Williams, an administrative assistant for a judge who's been a
regular at the cafe for about five years.
   ``If you've had the way the pies used to be, you know what's
genuine and what's imitation,'' Williams said. ``We true Hot
Springs natives could brag that we had the best pies in Arkansas.''
   Businessman Barry Horner has been indulging in Club Cafe pies
since he was a teen-ager 30 years ago, when he was known as the
``Dutch Apple Kid.''
   Horner said he couldn't quite put his finger on the difference.
   ``It seems like it's not quite up to what it used to be,'' he
said. ``But they're still good pies.''
   Tammy Lawrence, 19, who used to help out at the restaurant when
her mother worked there, said she can't taste any difference and
she's sampled everything on the pie menu.
   ``They taste the same to me. The meringue has a different
texture, but the fillings are the same,'' she said.
   West said he cranks out 50 to 70 pies a day, a job he calls more
stressful than his old duty of cooking the main meals. The
chocolate pie, one of several crowned with 3 inches of meringue, is
his customers' favorite, with coconut next, he said.
   Under a temporary restraining order issued in May, Mrs. Allen
has been barred from the Club Cafe premises and is working as a
waitress at a local Oriental restaurant. Oliver said there are no
orders preventing her from baking elsewhere.
   Mrs. Allen filed a counterclaim in June asking that the sale of
the 51 percent share to McNanna be rescinded because of a dispute
over payment on a $40,000 banknote for her mother and aunt, who
each owned a 20 percent share in the cafe. Mrs. Allen had owned the
remaining 11 percent sold to McNanna.
   Mrs. Allen's husband, Frank, still owns 29 percent of the
restaurant and West owns the remaining 20 percent.
   Monty Montgomery, owner of Monty's Pawn Shop, said he's gone
into the cafe just about every day since 1954 and has seen a lot of
changes, though the same faded red-and-white ``Club Cafe'' sign
still hangs over the door.
   ``Five to six years ago, you could come here for lunch and
there'd be a line out the door,'' Montgomery said. But until the
last couple of months, that wasn't the case anymore, he said.
   ``There are lots of new faces,'' Montgomery said. ``More
tourists seem to be coming in here.''
   ``It's kind of funny, getting all the publicity,'' West said.

<HEAD>Newspaper: Bush Says Hostage Crisis Resolution May Not Come Soon</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Bush said he would be willing to
negotiate for the release of American hostages held in the Middle
East if it could be done without endangering others, according to a
published interview.
   ``I have no problem with that ... if I can talk to somebody and
get the release of an American hostage and do it without, in my
view or in the view of the experts, putting others at risk'' of
being taken hostage, Bush said in an interview appearing in
Wednesday's editions of The Boston Globe.
   ``I have no reason to say that I can see in the short run a
total resolution of the American hostage problem. I wish I could,''
he said.
   Bush said he would continue using quiet diplomacy rather than
military force to resolve the crisis.
   ``I have tried to keep from escalating matters by making a lot
of loud threats,'' he said. ``I have had to take certain prudent
actions ... We are trying to handle this where diplomacy can be
most effective.''
   But the president played down the possibility of imminent
freedom for the eight American hostages held in the Middle East.
The Bush administration Tuesday rejected the idea of swapping the
captives in Lebanon for $2 billion in Iranian assets frozen nearly
ago decade ago.
   State Department spokesman Richard Boucher dismissed the
possibility of such an exchange. ``The questions of the assets have
no connection or linkage whatsoever with the hostage issue,'' he
said.
   The president said he was ``satisfied'' that the U.S.
intelligence network in Lebanon had improved in recent years ``but
we still don't have the intelligence that I would like to have. If
we had better intelligence, we might be able to surgically extract
the Americans that are still held hostage.''
   White House officials said later that U.S. representatives would
debrief United Nations envoy Marrack Goulding Wednesday in New York
about his weeklong tour of the Middle East.
   Goulding told reporters in Beirut on Monday after a series of
meetings with Israeli, Moslem and Shiite leaders that
``circumstances may be more conducive'' to a resolution than in
recent months.

<TEXT>
   Summertime at the Supreme Court is always
restful, offering the justices a relaxed pace until a new term
starts the first Monday in October. But after a particularly tiring
June this year, five of the court's nine members sought renewal
overseas.
   Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist taught a course on Supreme
Court history in France for three weeks, and is lecturing in Sweden.
   Justice Harry A. Blackmun has a similar gig in Austria, and
Justices William J. Brennan and Anthony M. Kennedy have concluded
teaching appearances in Scotland and England, respectively.
   Justice Sandra Day O'Connor traveled in England.
   Justice Antonin Scalia was to teach in China, but the
opportunity fell victim to that country's political unrest.
   Scalia this week is in Hawaii, along with Kennedy and Justice
Byron R. White, for speaking engagements at the American Bar
Association.
   Justices John Paul Stevens and Thurgood Marshall apparently have
no plans to travel outside the continental United States during the
summer recess.

   Meanwhile, back at the stately edifice on Capitol Hill, the
annual ebb and flow of law clerks has seen those who served the
justices last term depart, replaced by those already preparing for
the coming term.
   Most of last term's 34 law clerks, each of whom earned an annual
salary of $34,580, have joined high-powered law firms where their
starting salaries likely top $80,000 a year. But there are some
exceptions.
   Two of Marshall's law clerks, Paul Engelmayer and Jonathon
Schwartz, have become assistant U.S. attorneys in New York City.
Jane Stromseth, a law clerk for O'Connor, has joined the State
Department's legal office, and Cameron Findlay, who clerked for
Scalia, has become a special assistant to Secretary of
Transportation Samuel Skinner.
   Two Brennan law clerks have gone into public interest law.
Timothy Bishop has taken a job with the American Civil Liberties

   No other justice registered double-digit recognition: Kennedy, 7

   Beach-goers ready to frolic in U.S. coastal
waters should be prepared to encounter contamination from toxic
chemicals, sewage discharge and medical waste, a private
environmental group said today.
   ``Few regions of the country have escaped the effects of coastal
pollution,'' the Washington-based Natural Resources Defense Council
said in a report released today.
   The report, which examined a variety of ocean pollutants,
suggested the trend toward growing coastal contamination can be
reversed over the next decade, but only through strict pollution
control measures and curbs in development along coastal areas.
   ``Each year our factories dump no less than 5 trillion gallons
of wastewater into coastal waters,'' the report said.
   ``We flush another 2.3 trillion gallons of sewage into them. And
every time it rains or snows, massive amounts of poisonous
substances, including gasoline and pesticides, are carried into the
sea as runoff from our city streets and farms.''
   Half of the nation's population lives within 50 miles of coastal
waters, including the Great Lakes system, the report said, noting
that the population in many coastal regions is expected to increase
sharply over the next decade.
   The report cited as examples of the coastal pollution problem:
   _The Environmental Protection Agency's designation of three
locations in Washington's Puget Sound as priority toxic cleanup
sites under the federal Superfund law because of sediment
contamination.
   _The closing of parts of Maine's Casco Bay in recent years to
clam and mussel digging because of bacterial pollution from
inadequately treated sewage that was allowed into the waters.
Sediments in the bay also were found to be contaminated with heavy
metals, PCBs and an assortment of pesticides.
   _Continued high levels of the toxic pesticide DDT in
California's Santa Monica Bay 20 years after it was dumped into the
water by industry. The pesticide was banned in 1972.
   _The forced closing of at least 40 beaches in New York, New
Jersey and Connecticut during the first three weeks of this summer
because of sewage contamination.
   _The oil industry's routine dumping into offshore waters of
thousands of tons of waste material, including ``drilling mud''
that contains toxic chemicals.
   Medical waste on beaches, which attracted widespread attention
last summer, continues to be a problem, the report said. Such
wastes have been reported on beaches in 17 states this summer.
   ``Even supposedly clean beaches are far from safe,'' said the
report, entitled ``Ebb Tide for Pollution.''
   About one-fourth of all sewage wastewater ``is dumped directly
into coastal waters'' and much more is released into rivers that
eventually reaches the ocean, the report said. Pollution from a
variety of sources increasingly is showing up in fish and shellfish
in many parts of the country, it said.
   Even the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers contributes to the
problem, the report said.
   Of up to 700 million cubic yards of material dredged by the
Corps from harbors and channels each year, as much as 35 million
cubic yards are highly contaminated from pesticides, heavy metals,
PCBs and oil, according to the study. Much of the dredged material
is dumped in the ocean.
   The environmental group called for tighter controls on toxic
industrial pollutants as well as runoff pollutants from agriculture
and other sources, a ban on all discharges of raw sewage into
waters and more effective treatment programs and tighter land-use
and zoning requirements to curb coastal development.
   It also urged a halt of ocean dumping of medical wastes or the
discharge of plastics from vessels, sewers or other sources, and a
comprehensive program to protect coastal waters from oil spills
including a tightening of restrictions on offshore drilling and
tanker shipments.

<HEAD>Drug Abuse Not a `Black Problem,' Urban League Leader Says</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By W. DALE NELSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Drug abuse is not merely a ``black problem''
but a national dilemma that will require major resources to solve,
say leaders attending the national Urban League convention.
   ``We can't talk about the future we want to see for urban
America without talking about the No. 1 threat in our inner cities
today: illegal drugs,'' President Bush told the league Tuesday, as
the drug issue received heavy attention from the largely black
organization.
   Urban League President John E. Jacob, in an interview Tuesday,
said, ``We believe the federal government ought to ... mobilize
this nation to a realization that this is not a black problem but a
national problem that will require national resources.''
   But Jacob and others attending the meeting called for efforts to
protect the innocent during crackdowns in housing projects.
   The league today concludes its four-day convention, which
included a puppet show at a forum on drug abuse.
   Lottie V. Jones, president of the National Council on Alcoholism
and Other Dependencies, on Tuesday showed off the puppets her
Detroit-based group uses to teach families the dangers of drug
abuse.
   Ronald Pogue, senior vice president of CompDrugs Inc. of
Columbus, Ohio, told the drug forum: ``What sells in this country
right now is the notion that the drug problem is primarily a
minority problem.
   ``It is much easier for this country to buy into the notion that
it is a minority problem because then there is no compelling urge
to do anything about it,'' Pogue said.
   However, Jacob contended the drug issue has not been swept under
the rug.
   ``I think that the whole issue of dealing with drugs is
intimidating,'' he said. ``It has required that our community
become consciously more aggressive in attacking that problem,
because it is not an easy problem to attack, nor is it a safe one
to become involved with.
   ``Now we are talking about our community developing
relationships with the police and authorities that will ultimately
lead to people getting locked up,'' Jacob said. ``That is contrary
to the gentle nature of African-Americans toward each other and is
really inconsistent with the value system that we have had about
the extended family concept.''
   Now, Jacob said, blacks are seeing that ``the entire family must
be more important than those persons who would violate the trust of
the family.''
   Secretary of Housing and Urban Development Jack Kemp brought up
the subject of fairness, telling delegates Tuesday, ``We are going
to be tough on drugs, but we are going to be tough for due process,
too.''
   Jacob, asked if due process protections were a major concern for
the black community, said, ``I think it is a major concern that
people do not be penalized because of someone in their families
that might be using drugs that they had no control over.
   ``We don't want to create a climate in which people just run
roughshod through the (housing) projects eliminating people because
they just look like they use drugs,'' he said.
   But Jacob, asked whether tight budgetary restrictions might harm
the war against drugs, said: ``I don't think it will be as tough
for drugs as it will be for a lot of things. There are white
Americans who are just as scared about what's happening with drugs
as the black community.''

   One of the quirkier statistics presented at a
convention of statisticians here indicates that men should get
married, have children and get divorced if they want to be promoted
on a university faculty.
   Another statistic concerned the sale of T-shirts, but it was
less precise.
   Among more than 1,000 scholarly papers being presented at the
joint meetings of the American Statistical Association, the
Biometrical Society and the Institution of Mathematical
Statisticians was one by Lynne Billard of the University of
Georgia, who studied promotion rates on college faculties.
   Here's what she found about the path of advancement from
assistant to associate professor:
   _Among those who were married but childless, 51 percent of the
men and 41 percent of the women were promoted.
   _Among those who had spouses and children, 66 percent of the men
and 51 percent of the women were promoted.
   _Among those who were single, divorced or widowed and childless,
53 percent of the men and 37 percent of the women were promoted.
   _Among those who were unmarried and had children, 80 percent of
the men and 33 percent of the women were promoted.
   Ms. Billard, in a paper reflecting the jargon of her industry
(``the standardized regression coefficients in the prediction
equations for men and women''), drew no conclusions although the
moral was clear:
   For male assistant professors, the way to get ahead is to get
married, have children and get divorced. For women, that path leads
to stagnation.
   As for T-shirts, vendor Mary Cuzzucoli said statisticians seemed
to snap them up.
   A couple of hundred arrived at her table at 7:40 a.m. Tuesday
and by 9 a.m. they were all sold, she said. They bore this legend:
``I'm Statistically Significant.''
   Bumper stickers using a play on the statistical term ``moment,''
moved more slowly. ``Statisticians May Be Dull ... But We Have Our
Moments.''
   The annual August meeting filled two Washington hotels and
brought together 4,215 statisticians to observe the 150th year of
the ASA, which was founded in Boston and whose membership has
included Florence Nightingale, Alexander Graham Bell, Andrew
Carnegie and Martin Van Buren.
   The meeting's youngest presenter of a paper was 16-year-old
Nirmal D.C. Pugh, a junior at the Mahrishi School in Fairfield,
Iowa. His topic was ``Multivariate vs. Univariate Time Series
Forecasts of Weather Variables.''
   He's an old hand at delivering papers, having previously done so
before the International Neuroscience Conference.
   Outgoing ASA President Janet Norwood, who heads the government's
Bureau of Labor Statistics, noted in a speech that her bureau used
to draw moral conclusions from the numbers it gathered.
   For example, she said, in 1888, studying the conditions of women
workers, the bureau found that those living in rooming houses had
to receive guests in their rooms because there was no other place.
   It concluded: ``Such a condition tends either in the direction
of crushing out social intercourse, especially between the sexes,
or of carrying it beyond the limit of prudence.''

<HEAD>Oliver North Begins Community Service in Anti-Drug Program</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LEE BYRD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Former Marine Lt. Col. Oliver North is
beginning his service as a draftee in the war against narcotics by
helping reformed drug dealers and other underworld figures to repay
their crimes.
   The national security aide who directed some of the Reagan
administration's boldest covert ventures abroad now will be
plotting forays much nearer the White House as five men calling
themselves the ``New Pied Pipers'' attempt to clean up their old
neighborhoods in the capital.
   North will ``most definitely'' be given a tour of the worst drug
neighborhoods, but he won't be active on the streets, program
coordinator Donald Lewis said Tuesday. ``He's not a street-wise
individual _ we know that. His element is administration.''
   North, conscripted into the drug battle by the judge who
sentenced him in the Iran-Contra trial, began his orientation
Monday as a management adviser to Save Our Youth, Inc., a private
umbrella group for several anti-drug projects. He will focus, to
start with, on the ``Pipers'' initiative.
   Under an arrangement with the court, North will work in the
program about 16 hours a week for 75 weeks. Early last month, U.S.
District Judge Gerhard A. Gesell sentenced North to two years'
probation, a $150,000 fine and 1,200 hours of community service for
his conviction on three felony counts in the Iran-Contra case.
   North is appealing his conviction, but told the court he was
eager to begin the community work.
   North, in a two-hour get-acquainted meeting with program
organizers, was ``very excited about his involvement,'' coordinator
Donald Lewis said Tuesday. ``He wanted to get to work right away.''
   North initially was scheduled to return to the program's offices
at the National City Christian Church on Tuesday afternoon, but
Lewis said the second session was postponed to avoid the glare of
media attention.
   Lewis said Gesell assigned North to the Save Our Youth program
after the judge learned of the ``Pipers'' effort. The five men, all
well-known in the drug community, will try to dissuade youngsters
from using drugs and also will seek out dealers in efforts to give
them legal employment, Lewis said.
   Ronald ``Roach'' Henry, a member of the Pipers who met with
North on Monday, said he has no qualms about working with the
former White House aide. ``He's interesting ... and I think he was
interested in us,'' said Henry. ``I think he will use his mind to
help us develop solutions.''
   John Staggers, chairman of Save Our Youth, said North
``represents one of the best minds in the nation when it comes to
strategizing on how to attack problems.''
   As a deputy on Reagan's National Security Council staff, North
not only was a key figure in the secret sale of arms to Iran _ and
diversion of profits to the Nicaraguan rebels _ but played a major
role in planning the invasion of Grenada, the retaliatory bombing
of Libya and the interception of an Egyptian airliner carrying the
hijackers of the Achille Lauro cruise ship.
   Staggers and Lewis acknowledged that North's political image is
a far cry from that favored by Washington's black community. But
``we're creating a marriage of two extremes,'' said Lewis.
   ``The focus is not on our differences. The focus is on changing
what is happening on our streets and to our young people. The young
black man is self-destructive; he's becoming an endangered
species,'' Lewis said.
   Under terms dictated by Gesell, North cannot act as a
fundraiser, cannot counsel young people, and cannot give speeches
or act as a spokesman for the group.
   Thus, North will ``serve as a advisor in the management and
administration of SOY's activities,'' with his initial focus on the
Pipers, Lewis said. ``He will stay in his element, and we'll stay
in ours.''

<HEAD>Groups Say Staff Wanted Books Purchased in Lieu of Speaking Fees</HEAD>

   A federal grand jury wants to examine
documents from at least three groups that bought hundreds of copies
of a book by former House Speaker Jim Wright instead of paying him
a speaking fee, the groups say.
   The Justice Department refused Tuesday to discuss the grand jury
probe. But lawyers for Southwest Texas State University and the
National Realtors Association confirmed they received subpoenas
requesting documents related to the book.
   A spokesman for Ocean Spray, a cranberry and citrus growers
cooperative in Massachusetts, said the grand jury also was seeking
documents from his group. Company spokesman John Lawlor wouldn't
discuss details of the subpoena, but he did say the group bought
$2,000 worth of Wright's book for Wright's use.
   Wright resigned this summer after the House ethics committee
accused him of trying to evade House limits on outside income
through bulk sales of ``Reflections of a Public Man.'' He earned
royalties of 55 percent on the book's sales.
   The House limits members' earnings from speaking engagements to
30 percent of the congressional salary, but royalties are exempt.
   Wright spokesman Larry Shannon said the investigation appeared
to be ``very routine.''
   Justice Department spokesman David Runkel said the agency's
inquiry is continuing.
   ``I can't comment on any aspect of the investigation, except I
will confirm that it is ongoing,'' he said.
   Lawlor said Wright spoke to Ocean Spray growers and management
employees in November 1985. He said Wright's staff suggested that
instead of giving the House speaker an honorarium, the cooperative
could use the money to buy the books.
   ``As far as we were concerned, it was an honorarium in the form
of a book purchase in place of a cash honorarium,'' Lawlor said.
``How he was to use them (the books) was for him to determine.''
   Bill Fly, a lawyer for Southwest Texas State University, said
the school received a subpoena for documents relating to Wright's
1984 speech there and the subsequent purchase of $3,000 worth of
books.
   Fly said the university had agreed to pay Wright $3,000.
However, a Wright aide called after the speech to say the speaker
had reached his limit on outside income and asked if he could use
the money to buy copies of his book for the university, Fly said.
   ``We received about 504 copies of that book,'' Fly said.
   Laurene Janik, general counsel for the Realtors organization,
said Wright spoke to the group in April 1985. A $2,000 check was
issued and voided, and the money was to be used to buy Wright's
book, she said.
   However, the Realtors have no record of receiving copies of the
book, Ms. Janik said.

   President Bush, never one to sit still for
long, is traveling to his vacation home in Maine next week by way
of Miami. ``It's a fairly common route,'' jokes spokesman Marlin
Fitzwater.
   Bush's 2,000 miles of backtracking en route to Kennebunkport is
a political detour that Fitzwater says will be just one of many
upcoming campaign appearances by the president.
   In the Florida instance, it's all in the family.
   The president will campaign for Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, the
Republican nominee for the seat left vacant with the death in May
of Democratic Rep. Claude Pepper. Bush's son, Jeb, a 36-year-old
Miami real estate executive who has long been active in GOP
politics, is the candidate's campaign manager.
   The president's appearance comes in advance of an Aug. 29
special election.
   Actually, there has been considerable political maneuvering
lately in Bush's family _ both his official one and his personal
one. But most of the movement entails declarations of
non-candidacies.
   Jeb Bush, for instance, is sending out signals that he's not
interested in running for elective office after a stint as
Florida's secretary of commerce _ preferring instead to spend time
developing his business.
   And Bush's oldest son, George W. Bush, 43, an oilman and part
owner of the Texas Rangers baseball team, announced he was more
interested in the American League pennant race than running for
Texas governor in 1990.
   He had been widely viewed as a likely contender before last
week's announcement.
   About the same time, Andrew H. Card Jr., deputy to White House
Chief of Staff John Sununu, announced he is abandoning the notion
of a gubernatorial bid in his home state of Massachusetts and will
devote his time to his White House post.
   Sununu earlier took himself out of the 1990 New Hampshire race
for the seat being vacated by the retiring Sen. Gordon Humphrey,
R-N.H. He said he hopes to serve Bush for at least four years,
preferably eight.
   But speculation continues to swirl around persistent rumors that
Sununu's wife, Nancy, may challenge Rep. Charles G. Douglas,
R-N.H., next year. The Sununus and Douglas have been on less than
friendly terms recently.
   Meanwhile, presidential aide Steve Studdert, who has served
three Republican presidents, announced recently that he was
resigning _ to return home to Utah, spend more time with his family
and serve as a political consultant.
   And what about reports that he may run for governor of Utah?
``No plans at this time to run,'' Studdert says. However, he
doesn't hesitate to note that ``there are major economic structural
challenges that face Utah'' and to outline how he would approach
them.
   Bush, meanwhile, appears ready for his vacation, which starts a
week from today and will last until Sept. 5.
   On Monday night, Bush was preparing to speak via telephone
hookup to a town meeting in Fort Lauderdale, Fla., and was chatting
with the local host, Rep. Clay Shaw, R-Fla., about their travel
plans.
   The preliminary conversation was piped into the White House
press briefing room, and Bush told Shaw that first lady Barbara
Bush was already in Kennebunkport. ``We're going up next week,''
the president said enthusiastically.
   A case of the pre-vacation sillies may be setting at the White
House.
   Bush the other day jokingly told a group of photographers in the
Oval Office: ``Don't anybody take the ashtrays.''
   And on Tuesday, he rushed into the White House press room
brandishing a gag photo depicting him as an invisible leader _ and
jokingly threatened to fire the top aides who sent it to him as a
practical joke.
   The photo showed aides seated around Bush's desk at the Oval
Office, with his seat empty. It read: ``To President Skippy. From
the gang that sees through you.''
   It was a reference to the comic strip ``Doonesbury,'' and
creator G.B. Trudeau's frequent depiction of Bush as invisible and
references to an imaginary ``evil twin'' whom Trudeau named Skippy.
   ``This is a vicious assault on my presidency,'' Bush said.
   Bush has made no secret that he's no fan of Trudeau, who was
excluded from the invitation list when Bush invited cartoonists to
lunch last spring.

<HEAD>Sugar Industry Stockpiling Ammunition for Quota Debate</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MIKE ROBINSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   America's sugar industry is stockpiling
statistics to throw into the fight to maintain import quotas that
ward off foreign sugar and boost consumer prices at home.
   An industry study unveiled Tuesday said the sugar and allied
corn-sweetener industries directly create 144,442 full-time jobs
nationwide and pump almost $7.4 billion a year into the U.S.
economy.
   ``It shows there is a lot more to this industry than the attacks
that say it only benefits a handful of growers,'' American Sugar
Alliance Chairman Luther Markwart said in making the study public.
   Markwart cited findings that, counting indirect effects, sugar
and sweetener production generate $18.5 billion in wages and
revenues, plus 361,000 jobs annually in 42 states.
   If there is a move to lift quotas as part of the 1990 farm bill,
the survey is guaranteed to be used by the industry to offset
claims that it represents only a narrow special interest.
   Because of the quotas, a pound of raw sugar that sells for 14
cents in world markets goes for about 24 cents in the United
States. That difference is passed on to consumers after the sugar
is processed, packaged and sent to the grocery shelf.
   Consumer groups and industries such as soft drink and candy
makers complain about the high cost of U.S. sugar. The House and
Senate Agriculture Committees, however, have left the quotas
intact. The two panels include members from major sugar-growing
states and lawmakers reap hefty campaign contributions from growers.
   The survey also takes into account jobs and earnings generated
by the corn-sweetener industry. Its products, used widely in soft
drinks and various foods, trail sugar in price and the two
industries are often allies.
   Lifting quotas would eventually scuttle not only beet and cane
growers but sweetener manufacturing in this country, Markwart said.
   The survey said annual sugar and sweetener output totaling more
than $7.3 billion a year is spread over many states. It said that
the combined value topped $100 million in 17 states.
   The major corn states of Iowa and Illinois headed the list of
17. Those two states, plus Indiana, Tennessee and Ohio, were the
leading corn-sweetener producers. Major cane states were Florida,
Louisiana and Hawaii; New York made the list principally as a
refining site.
   Also among the 17 were the sugarbeet producing states of
Minnesota, California, Idaho, North Dakota, Nebraska, Michigan and
Colorado. Among states on the list, Texas was notable for its
diversified production.
   In employment, the agricultural side of the two industries
contributes 115,268 jobs and the processing side 29,173, according
to the study.
   It cited seven states with substantially higher employment
totals than others: Florida, 11,057; California, 10,513; Iowa,
9,929; Louisiana, 9,890; Minnesota, 9,731; Illinois, 8,907; and
Nebraska, 8,889.
   The total includes farm workers involved in growing corn, even
though economists aren't sure just what would happen to those jobs
if sweetener production in the United States halted. But the study
said that, leaving out corn production, overall employment in the
industries would total ``a highly creditable 75,411 full-time
positions.''
   Agricultural wages for corn and sugar totaled more than $1.2
billion nationwide, according to the study. Cane states had the
highest overall payrolls, $159 million for Florida and $82.7
million for Louisiana.
   On the processing side, wages came to more than $811 million.
California led the way with $118.5 million. Overall wages for
growing and processing nationwide were just over $2 billion, the
survey said.
   It said that sugar and sweetener business generates wages of
$100 million a year or more in eight states: Florida, California,
Iowa, Illinois, Louisiana, Hawaii, Minnesota and Nebraska.
   Sugar industry critics are quick to point out not only the
impact of quotas on the wallets of consumers but the other side of
the employment story.
   ``U.S. workers also do not escape the adverse effects of this
program,'' Sen. Bill Bradley, D-N.J., told the Senate recently.
   Bradley, the program's leading Senate critic, noted that U.S.
refineries have been closing their doors and laying off workers
because of high sugar prices. He said those costs are also hurting
other industries.
   ``The U.S. food and beverage manufacturing industries employ
hundreds of thousands of people,'' he said. ``The chocolate and
confectionary industries alone employ more than 60,000 people.
These jobs are threatened by competition from foreign manufacturers
who have access to sugar at world market prices, not America's
inflated price.''

   Farm machinery sales are expected to rise for
the third year in a row, increasing from $6 billion in 1988 to as
much as $6.7 billion in 1989, according to the Agriculture
Department.
   Higher net cash incomes, lower real interest rates, rising
farmland values and lowered agricultural debt are all trends that
are contributing to expectations for a better year in tractor
sales, USDA said.
   It said demand for the more powerful tractors is especially
strong thus far in 1989. Sales of 139-plus horsepower, two-wheel
drive and four-wheel drive tractors are expected to climb 23
percent and 65 percent respectively.

<HEAD>HUD Officials Can't Find Files of Former Assistant Secretary</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN KING</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Department of Housing and Urban
Development says it can't locate the files of a former housing
official whose conduct is under scrutiny in the influence-peddling
probe, but the former official says he doesn't have them.
   ``I don't even know where they are kept, much less take them
with me,'' Thomas T. Demery said Tuesday, adding that he took no
files when he left HUD last year. ``I don't have them.''
   James Lafferty, deputy assistant secretary for public affairs at
HUD, said, ``He may have taken them with him _ we don't have them
here.'' However, he said the department has no evidence that Demery
took the files.
   ``They could be someplace that we don't now know about but they
are not in the typical places that you would look for them,''
Lafferty said.
   HUD officials realized the files were missing after receiving a
Freedom of Information Act request for access to them.
   The files of two other former HUD officials _ Secretary Samuel
R. Pierce Jr. and his top aide Deborah Gore Dean _ have provided
dramatic insight into their activities at the agency.
   Pierce told Congress in May that he had no direct role in
funding decisions. Since then, however, a number of news accounts
have detailed Pierce's personal intervention in several HUD
projects, and his files offer further evidence that he was more
involved in some decisions than he indicated in his congressional
testimony.
   Ms. Dean's files show that she was often contacted by developers
and consultants seeking HUD approval for projects and often gave
proposals her endorsement although her job carried no official
funding authority.
   For two years Demery was HUD's assistant secretary for housing,
a powerful position that has jurisdiction over many of HUD's
subsidy programs.
   The report that sparked the congressional and internal
investigations of HUD focused heavily on Demery's conduct. That
report, by HUD's inspector general, questioned the selection
process used to award lucrative rehabilitation subsidies and said
many of those who benefited were contributors to a charity Demery
helped establish.
   HUD Inspector General Paul A. Adams concluded that Demery
committed no criminal offenses but said that prominent Republicans
and former agency officials appeared to get special treatment from
HUD.
   The Justice Department, which reviewed the report to determine
whether Demery violated HUD's standards of conduct, said last month
it would not prosecute him.
   Demery also was in charge of another program that was the
subject of a critical audit by the inspector general.
   That report said Demery awarded emergency HUD funding to a
number of projects that weren't eligible. Several qualified
projects that didn't receive funding later went under and were
taken over by the government, the report said.
   An Associated Press review of the program found that developers
of projects that got emergency funding although auditors said they
didn't qualify included a former business associate and several
donors to his pet charity.
   Demery, in a recent interview, said he made the awards ``on the
merits'' and questioned the audit's assertion that many of the
projects weren't eligible.

<HEAD>Safety Board Trying to Increase Safety of Small School Buses</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID BRISCOE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The National Transportation Safety Board wants
to find the best way to protect children who ride in small school
buses that don't have to meet standards set for larger buses.
   The board Tuesday sent a report on school bus safety back to its
staff for revisions after failing to resolve issues involving the
use of seat belts and the design of front-seat barriers in buses
that carry 10 to 24 passengers.
   The staff wanted to conduct crash tests, but the four board
members at the meeting refused to adopt that recommendation.
   Acting chairman James Kolstad said the small number of
fatalities in small school buses _ an average of two or three a
year with 41,000 buses on the road _ didn't justify the testing.
   ``I think the parents of this country can be reassured that
their children are by and large safe on these small school buses,''
Kolstad said after the board spent three hours discussing the
proposals it eventually declined to adopt.
   The recommendations, drawn from a study of 24 bus crashes,
called for tougher rollover standards, improved joint design, more
secure door latches and strengthened windshields.
   Suzanne Stack, NTSB safety specialist, said federal standards
for seat spacing, barrier padding and other safety features
required for large buses don't apply to the smallest school buses.
Use of the small buses has increased in urban areas, where they
often serve handicapped or specialized students, she said.
   Kolstad said he hopes to call another board meeting within a few
weeks to adopt the report and resolve the issues of front-seat
barriers and lap belts.
   Kolstad characterized all the safety recommendations as
``relatively minor'' and said school buses remain one of the safest
forms of transportation. Large buses are somewhat safer than small
ones, he said.
   The report follows an NTSB study two years ago on larger school
buses that concluded the vehicles generally are safe. It
recommended against installation of seat belts because federal
standards require that seats be designed to form a padded
compartment around young riders.
   All small Type A buses, which include vans converted to carry
pupils, already have lap belts for each passenger but don't follow
rules for compartmentalizing the youngsters.
   The draft report recommended crash tests to determine the safety
of various barrier designs with both restrained and unbelted
passengers in Type A buses. Barriers in front of the first row of
seats in small school buses generally were inferior to those in
large buses, the report said.
   In several cases studied, the report said, passengers were
thrown into the front of the bus where they were injured. In one
instance, two children sitting in a front seat were killed _ one
who wore a lap belt rammed his head into the barrier, and the other
who was not wearing a belt was thrown through the barrier.
   The report said restraining barriers sometimes came loose during
crashes, moving into the passenger area and exposing sharp edges
that caused injuries.
   The draft also called for a study of the possibility of
requiring lap-shoulder belts or other restraining systems for all
passengers in Type A buses.
   Board member Jim Burnett, who was not at the meeting, said he
favored adopting the staff report as drafted.
   In a telephone interview, Burnett said that although school
buses provide a highly safe form of transportation, ``the security
of schoolchildren remains a major public safety concern.''

   The decade began with their creation and, if
all goes according to plan, it will end with their demobilization.
As the clock runs out on the Nicaraguan Contras, they have fallen
short of achieving their principal goal but can still point to some
successes.
   The Bush administration tried Tuesday to put the best face on a
Central American plan to dismantle the Contras by Dec. 5, pointing
out the rebels are under no obligation to do anything unless
``safe, democratic conditions'' are established in Nicaragua
permitting their voluntary return.
   The administration would have much preferred that the Contras
stay together in their camps along the Honduran border until after
the Feb. 25, 1990, elections, serving as an incentive for the
Sandinistas to carry out a fair election process in the interim.
   But even if the Contras manage to survive their Dec. 8 death
sentence, there is almost no possibility they will ever again be a
major factor shaping the destiny of their homeland or of Central
America itself.
   Not much has gone right for them since President Reagan signed
legislation in October 1986 providing the Contras $100 million in
economic and military aid:
   _Less than a month later the Iran-Contra scandal claimed two of
their most ardent backers in the administration, Lt. Col. Oliver
North and National Security Adviser John Poindexter. Another
setback occurred with the death in early 1987 of another stalwart
supporter, CIA Director William Casey.
   _In August 1987 the Central American peace agreement was signed,
requiring the United States to end its support for the Contras.
This considerably strengthened the hand of the anti-Contra bloc in
the Congress.
   _In February 1988 the House rejected an administration request
for additional aid for the Contras. Soon after, an informal
cease-fire was agreed to in Nicaragua, and the Contra exodus to the
base camps in Honduras began.
   Since then there has been no serious discussion of resuming aid
to the Contras. Secretary of State James A. Baker III made clear
his sentiments last March when he declared the Reagan
administration's policy toward the Contras a failure.
   The Contras are feeling even more abandoned following the
Central American summit earlier this week in Honduras. The meeting
was preceded by an agreement by President Daniel Ortega and
Nicaragua's internal opposition declaring that the time had come
for the Contras to go home in peace.
   Previously, the Contras and opposition parties enjoyed an
informal alliance, viewing each other as partners in their quest to
remove the Sandinistas from power.
   The opposition's disassociation from the Contras made it easier
for the Central American presidents to set their December timetable
for the rebels' demobilization. Appeals from the Bush
administration for a less ambitious deadline were ignored.
   The rebels are now reduced to ragtag status in the border camps,
and their remaining backers in Washington are reduced to no more
than a diehard few here and there.
   But there are those who recall with nostalgia the Contras'
heyday and with trepidation the what-might-have-beens in Central
America. One former Reagan administration official insists the
Contras made more of a contribution to U.S. interests than Baker
and other critics give them credit for:
   _They were such a nuisance that the Sandinistas had to forgo
efforts to carry out subversion elsewhere in Central America,
enabling these countries to get a start on establishing democratic
systems. All still have elected presidents.
   _It was primarily because of the Contra military threat that the
Sandinistas agreed to sign the 1987 peace agreement in Guatemala.
At that meeting, the Sandinistas won support from other governments
in the region for an end to U.S. aid to the Contras but also made
unprecedented commitments to bring democracy to Nicaragua.
   Although the Sandinista performance in carrying out these
commitments has not been perfect, the country has not turned into
what the Reagan administration feared most _ an expansionist,
totalitarian one-party state modeled after Cuba.

   President Bush's ``rhetoric is right'' on
civil rights, say National Urban League leaders, but they plan to
wait a year to see how it turns out in practice.
   ``I am willing to concede that the first six to eight months is
the rhetoric period'' in judging a new administration, Urban League
President John E. Jacob said after Bush's address Tuesday.
   ``We will use the next 12 months to determine how well he does
in carrying that out. His rhetoric is right. He is saying the right
things. Now we have to find out whether he is willing to do the
right things,'' Jacob said.
   Joseph E. Lowery, president of the Southern Christian Leadership
Conference, was scheduled to address the concluding session of the
conference today.
   Bush, the first president to address an Urban League conference
since President Carter in 1979, received generous applause as he
pledged that his administration ``will not tolerate discrimination,
bigotry or bias of any kind.''
   But Joan N. Tokley, president of the Tampa, Fla., Urban League,
said, ``I would have felt a lot more comfortable if the president
had addressed the recent rulings of the Supreme Court, especially
those that deal with affirmative action.''
   Recent decisions of the court have held that state and local
governments generally may not impose racial quotas for public works
hiring, that minorities must meet higher statistical standards to
prove they are being relegated to less desirable jobs, and that
white workers not involved in an 8-year-old affirmative action
ruling were nevertheless entitled to attack it in court.
   ``No matter what he says his moral and philosophical conviction
is ... at this point I haven't heard him say anything about the
laws in this country that were designed to protect blacks, women
and other minorities,'' Ms. Tokley said. ``And until he does, I
will not be convinced that he actually means what he says.''
   Harold Hood, a Michigan Court of Appeals judge attending the
conference, said Bush's address ``was a very neutral talk as far as
minorities were concerned.''
   ``I don't know that I expect him to be on our side,'' Hood said.
``I'd be happy if he isn't against us. And at least I didn't get
the sense that he's against us, and that's a plus.''
   Bush told the delegates the gulf between white and black America
has narrowed, but has not been closed.
   ``Closing that gulf _ eliminating it for all time _ is the next
chapter we must write in the unfolding history, the unfinished
history, of civil rights,'' Bush said.
   He conceded that he and civil rights leaders have disagreed
about how to accomplish that.
   ``We've argued _ society's argued _ about affirmative action,
about quotas, goals and timetables, about set-asides,'' he said.
   But the most important point, the president said, is that
``bigotry and bias may take more subtle forms (than in the past)
but they persist _ and as long as they do, our work is not over.''

   An 87-year-old woman who regained
consciousness as she was about to be embalmed showed no signs of
life before she was taken to the funeral home, a boarding home
operator said.
   ``The lady died away for a while and later came back to,'' said
Robbie Caldwell. ``The lady was laying there. She had no pulse, no
blood pressure, nothing. She was just gone.''
   Ms. Caldwell did not say whether Carrie Stringfellow was
pronounced dead by a physician before she was taken to the funeral
home on Saturday, and she refused to answer additional questions.
   Ms. Stringfellow, whose murmuring startled a mortician preparing
to embalm her, was listed in fair condition Tuesday at Mercy
Medical Center. She was taken to the hospital after she was found
to be alive.
   ``She has no recall of what happened to her Saturday evening,''
Ernest Henson, vice president of medical services at the hospital,
said at a news conference. ``It's kind of like a black period.''
   He said her memory otherwise seems to be unaffected and that she
appears to be ``cheerful and happy.'' He said Ms. Stringfellow, who
is blind, may be released from the hospital as early as Friday and
plans to live with a niece.
   Hospital officials turned down reporters' requests to interview
Ms. Stringfellow.
   ``To me, it's a horrendous ordeal she's been through,'' said
Henson.
   The incident is under investigation by the Ohio Department of
Health, according to Dr. Beth Klitch, chief of the department's
bureau of medical services.
   Ms. Klitch said the state could seek a court injunction to end
operation of the home, ask Clark County to remove residents and
pursue criminal charges.
   She said the department cited the home last April for several
structural deficiencies, such as unsafe handrails. She indicated
that some of the problems have been corrected.
   Henson said he has talked with about five physicians who have
cared for Ms. Stringfellow in the past and none said they were
contacted Saturday evening about the apparent death.
   Dennis L. Porter, director of the Dennis L. Porter Funeral Home,
said he was called by the home Saturday about 8:30 p.m. and asked
to pick up a body. When he arrived, Ms. Stringfellow was slumped in
a chair.
   ``She actually appeared to be dead,'' he said.
   Porter said the woman was placed in a pouch, which was zipped
and then placed on a cot. The cot was loaded into Porter's vehicle,
and he drove back to the funeral home, arriving about 8:45 p.m.
   Porter said he unzipped the pouch and prepared to move the woman
to the embalming table when ``she uttered a sound.''
   It was ``a very eerie feeling,'' he said. ``I was amazed.''
   Porter, 64, said there is no requirement that a death
certificate be signed before a body is transported to a funeral
home. He said he often fills out death certificates himself and
then has them signed by physicians.
   Webster Junk, an inspector for the State Board of Embalmers and
Funeral Directors, the state agency that licenses funeral homes,
said a funeral director must know that a coroner or licensed
physician will sign a death certificate before a body can be
transported to a funeral home.
   He also said the family of the deceased must give permission
before the body can be embalmed. Porter said Ms. Stringfellow's
family had given permission.

<TEXT>
   As many as 14 million families could be forced
into homelessness by a mild recession in the U.S. economy,
according to a study.
   The report by the American Affordable Housing Institute said
public efforts to help the homeless rely are badly underfinanced,
uncoordinated and are conducted by officials often unaware of the
resources available to them.
   The report by the institute, a research center at Rutgers
University in New Brunswick, N.J., estimated that there are 4
million to 14 million American families ``living on the knife edge
of homelessness'' who could face life on the streets should a mild
recession occur.
   ``They are one pay check, one domestic argument from the
streets,'' the report said. ``In a mild recession, homelessness in
America is likely to double and triple almost overnight.''
   Estimates on the current number of homeless people range between
655,000 to 4 million, but the total is growing 20 percent to 40
percent annually, the study said.

<TEXT>
   Turmoil in China means the government there
will have a difficult time dealing with inflation and other
economic problems, the CIA has concluded.
   Economic reform has been put on hold by the central government
and economic problems could prompt renewed political unrest in the
1990s, said the report to the Joint Economic Committee released
Tuesday.
   ``The new leadership has endorsed a continuation of the
austerity program, but the social and political turmoil that has
gripped China since April will make it difficult for Beijing to
solve its pressing economic problems,'' the report said.
   Inflation in 1989 hit 19 percent overall and 30 percent in urban
areas, the highest levels since the communists came to power in
1949.
   The CIA authors also said China's military leaders probably will
play a larger political and economic role in return for the
military crackdown last May on democracy demonstrations in Beijing.

   The Federal Communications Commission suspects
that a professor at the State University of New York at Oswego was
running an ``application mill'' that filed for more than 100
broadcast licenses under false or forged names in order to collect
settlement payoffs.
   ``You could use that term,'' FCC spokeswoman Patricia Chew said
Tuesday discussing the case of Bernard Boozer, of Central Square,
N.Y. ``Some of his applications did enter into settlement
agreements, if I remember correctly.''
   Outgoing FCC Chairman Dennis R. Patrick sent a letter last week

After an investigation, the FCC concluded that Boozer may have
violated both commission regulations and federal law.
   Boozer could not be reached for comment. There was no telephone

   With Congress in recess, the national media
has time to study more important things _ such as President Bush's
hair.
   Bush delivered a speech at the National Urban League conference
Tuesday with his usually neatly combed-back hair flopping on his
forehead.
   The media was quick to notice the change and begin digging for
the reason.
   A change of style? Nope: Bush just needed a haircut, the White
House said.
   Bush made the appearance shortly after jogging for 30 minutes,
and his hair wasn't quite dry as he spoke to the civil rights group.
   The final event on Bush's calendar, in fact, was a haircut.
   ``He isn't changing his hair style. Wait until you see him ...
after his haircut before drawing any conclusions,'' said deputy
press secretary Stephen Hart.

<HEAD>Broadway Revival of `Shenandoah' Opens</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: No PMs Planned</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARY CAMPBELL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The songs sound better the second time around in
the Broadway revival of ``Shenandoah,'' and John Cullum, returning
in the starring role, is just as good as he was when he won a 1975
Tony Award.
   The homespun anti-war musical opened Tuesday at the Virginia
Theater with a cast boasting a larger percentage of very good
voices than most Broadway musicals.
   Cullum's fine voice isn't as effortless as it once was, but the
September that has entered it improves his ability to convey the
widower Charlie Anderson's deep love for his family.
   ``Shenandoah'' originally opened Jan. 7, 1975, at Broadway's
Alvin Theater and ran for 1,050 performances. The revival, which
first played in Toronto, is scheduled through Sept. 2, with an
extension considered.
   The story is based on the 1965 movie of the same name which
starred James Stewart. It tells of a father, six sons, daughter and
daughter-in-law who live and farm together in the Shenandoah Valley
of Virginia during the Civil War.
   Undertakers are the only winners in a war, Anderson believes,
and he keeps his family neutral. But the war won't leave them alone.
   A corny moment, as Anderson tells his prospective son-in-law
that women sometimes get angry when husbands don't do things the
women haven't asked them to do, is bearable because it's comic
relief against tragedies the audience knows must come in Act. 2.
``Shenandoah'' is sentimental, too, but focusing on individuals in
one family makes the sentiment meaningful, not shallow.
   The songs are a cross between the wholesome Rodgers and
Hammerstein style and ballads written for somebody like Tony
Bennett. There's an anthem, ``Freedom''; a lullaby, ``Papa's Gonna
Make It Alright''; the up-tempo ``Next to Lovin' (I Like
Fightin')'' for the five grown sons, and ``The Only Home I Know,''
an Irish-sounding tune sung by Irish tenor Stephen Simms.
   Tracey Moore was the daughter of the house, displaying a voice
that would fit perfectly in ``Me and My Girl.'' Other principals
were Camilla Scott, the daughter-in-law; Burke Lawrence,
Christopher Martin, Nigel Hamer, Stephen McIntyre and Robin Blake,
the grown sons; Jason Zimbler, the young son; Roy McKay, his slave
friend, and Thomas Cavanagh, the son-in-law.
   Gary Geld wrote music and Peter Udell wrote lyrics. Their first
Broadway show was ``Purlie.'' The book was by James Lee Barrett,
Udell and Philip Rose, based on Barrett's screenplay. Rose directed
the revival and the original.
   Scenery is by Reginald Bronskill, based on Kert Lundell's
minimal originals. Producers are Howard Hurst, Sophie Hurst and
Peter Ingster.

<HEAD>Source Tells Newspaper No Evidence of Spying Found</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Czech-born Air Force officer continues to be
restricted to a Texas base while the Pentagon investigates
allegations of espionage, but a report published today says no
evidence of spying has been uncovered.
   ``No one in channels is saying that this guy's a spy,'' The
Washington Post quoted an unidentified official as saying about
Capt. John Vladimir Hirsch.
   The newspaper also said that some high officials, whom it did
not identify, were cautioning that only ``irregularities'' that
need explanation had been discovered, not evidence of spying.
   ``No charges have been made against him at this point,''
spokesman Pete Williams told reporters at a Pentagon briefing
Tuesday.
   Hirsch, suspected of selling secrets to the Soviet bloc while
serving with the 690th Electronics Security Wing in West Berlin,
has been restricted to Kelley Air Force Base near San Antonio while
the investigation is conducted.
   The restriction began last week after he returned from Germany.
   Williams said he couldn't comment to queries that Hirsch isn't
cooperating with the investigation. He did say, however, that no
hearing has been scheduled.
   Hirsch was head of engineering and installation at the Air
Force's electronic security wing at the West Berlin Templehof
Central Airport. The unit collects intelligence on Warsaw Pact
radar and communications.
   Pentagon officials, speaking privately, said the Air Force found
uncashed paychecks, evidence of bank accounts totaling more than
$120,000, photographs of Western military installations and other
classified documents in Hirsch's Berlin home.
   Hirsch came under suspicion during the routine review of his
security clearance, reportedly after he failed a lie detector test.
   Lt. Erlinda Baker, a public affairs officer with the Electronic
Security Command, said the command works on communications and
electronic combat capabilities, including ways the Air Force
protects its radar from being jammed.
   Hirsch, 33, lists Cleveland Heights, Ohio, as his home and has
been with the Air Force since 1979, Baker said. He was born in
Prague, Czechoslovakia, and became a U.S. citizen in 1971.

<TEXT>
   The opposition imposed an embarrassing delay
Wednesday in Parliament's confirmation of Toshiki Kaifu as Japan's
second new prime minister in a little over two months.
   Kaifu, who was elected Tuesday to head the governing Liberal
Democratic Party, was approved by the more powerful lower house,
but the Senate then voted for Japan Socialist Party Chairwoman
Takako Doi.
   It was the first time in 41 years that the two houses disagreed
on who should take power.
   Delegates from the two chambers were to meet in conference later
in the day to go through the motions of finding a compromise. If
they fail, as expected, under the constitution the lower house
victor prevails.
   Kaifu, 58, called the delay a ``severe consequence of our
election defeat.''
   Kaifu is succeeding Sousuke Uno, who decided to step down after
the Liberal Democrats were thrashed in the July 23 election for
half the seats in the upper house of the Diet, Japan's parliament.
   The party lost its majority in the Senate for the first time
since it was formed in 1955, but still commands the lower house.
   Meanwhile, Uno's Cabinet met and resigned en masse, clearing the
way for Kaifu to form a new government to try to win back the
public approval that the Liberal Democrats have lost in a
succession of scandals and unpopular policies.
   On Tuesday, Kaifu pledged to restore public trust after a year
of scandal and unpopular policies that caused voters to turn on the
governing party for the first time since it was formed.
   ``I am painfully aware of the weight of my responsibility,''
Kaifu told a news conference Tuesday. ``We have been reborn and we
must forge ahead. We must carry out political reforms and shed our
old skin.''
   A secret ballot of Liberal Democratic members of parliament and
state-level party leaders resulted in 279 votes for Kaifu, 120 for
former Welfare Minister Yoshiro Hayashi and 48 for Shintaro
Ishihara, a novelist and former transport minister.
   The upper house elections cost the Liberal Democrats their
majority for the first time since the party was formed in 1955.
General elections for the more powerful lower house must be called
by next July.
   On Tuesday night, Kaifu met with other party officials to decide
on a new Cabinet and party leadership, a delicate task of balancing
key jobs among rival party factions in the party.
   He succeeds Sousuke Uno, who was plagued by reports that he kept
paid mistresses. Uno resigned to take responsibility for the loss
of the upper house elections, attributed to the sex and money
scandals and a 3 percent sales tax that outraged housewives.
   Uno had replaced Noboru Takeshita, who stepped down June 2 to
take responsibility for the Recruit Co. influence-buying scandal,
which reached the top levels of politics, business and the
bureaucracy.
   Takeshita chose Uno, one of the few ranking politicians
untouched by the Recruit scandal, as his successor but Kaifu was
selected by the first party election in 17 years.
   Despite the election, many still see Kaifu's candidacy as a
product of backroom politics. He has no personal power base and is
viewed as unlikely to stand in the way of more senior leaders
temporarily blocked from the prime ministry by the Recruit scandal.
   How long Kaifu will serve is not clear. His term as party
president is only three months, until the end of Takeshita's
original term, but he could be elected to another.
   Before Tuesday's vote, candidate Hayashi said: ``I read in the
newspaper this morning that the election was already decided. The
Liberal Democratic Party presidential election is not subject to
the Public Election Law, but if it were, it would be violating the
rules.''
   Opposition parties accused the Liberal Democrats of continuing
politics in the old style.
   ``As always, it was secret factional politics,'' said Ms. Doi of
the Japan Socialist Party, which made the greatest gains in the
upper house elections. ``There is simply no change. It's just what
has been done all along: they're changing a book's cover without
changing its contents.''
   An editorial in the newspaper Asahi said maneuvering within the
party ``blatantly reflects a design to sustain a system of
leadership monopolized by the mainstream factions.''
   ``The starting point for Kaifu is to grapple with the issues
that were brought to light in the presidential election and to
change what should be changed,'' it said. ``Otherwise, his election
by vote will prove to be a farce.''
   In pledging to change the system, Kaifu told the news conference
Tuesday: ``In various ways, factions have had an evil influence,
but just saying that they are bad won't make them go away.''
   Kaifu lacks experience in foreign and financial affairs, does
not lead his own faction and has never served in a top party post.
   He was the youngest member of Parliament when elected at age 29
and predicted at the time he would become prime minister in another
29 years.

   Consumers have had it with commercials on the
videocassettes they rent, even as more car and soft-drink spots are
being spliced onto movie tapes.
   Sixty-six percent of VCR owners said they fast-forward through
commercials at the beginning of rented movies, according to a
Nielsen Media Research study released Tuesday at the eighth annual
Video Software Dealers Association convention.
   The study further found that more than 60 percent of those
surveyed said they zip through coming attractions.
   Despite the renters' unhappiness, though, the commercials won't
be going away anytime soon.
   MCA Home Videos' upcoming release of ``The Land Before Time''
will carry a Pizza Hut pitch.
   ``Rain Man'' features a Buick plug, ``A Fish Called Wanda''
hypes Schweppes and ``Young Guns'' hawks Nestle.
   And a number of promoters have created a ruckus at this year's
convention by offering to open prerecorded cassettes and attach
commercials for local merchants.
   Video Air Time of Midland, Texas, will put spots for florists,
bowling alleys, attorneys and department stores on any cassette
where there's room.
   ``We're offering the video store owner an additional source of
revenue,'' said Terry Mathis, Video Air Time's vice president for
franchising. ``The video store owns the cassette. And if we don't
make an unauthorized infringement of the copyrighted material, we
have violated no law.''
   Video Air Time charges about $20 per commercial per cassette, of
which the store owner receives about $1 a tape.
   Paramount Pictures has filed a $1 million lawsuit against St.
Louis-based Video Broadcasting Systems, alleging that the company
has placed commercials on ``Beverly Hills Cop II,'' ``Raiders of
the Lost Ark,'' and ``Eddie Murphy Raw'' in some markets.
   Paramount argues that low-budget local commercials damage the
studio's image. Paramount was the first studio to place a
commercial on a major studio release, adding a Diet Pepsi pitch to
``Top Gun'' in 1986.
   Like that slick spot, many commercials on major studio releases
are well-produced, often superior to spots for the same product
running on television.
   The disapproval rate reflected in the new Nielsen study comes as
a major reversal from a Nielsen study released in April. That
survey showed that 95 percent of households renting the ``A Fish
Called Wanda'' video watched the Schweppes commercial.
   Some home video executives have predicted that more than half of
all video releases will contain commercials in the near future.
   Besides its findings on fast-forwarding commercials, the new
Nielsen study showed that although video rental volume continues to
grow, customers are looking for other ways to spend time, including
other leisure activities, business or education, or regular
television.
   The Nielsen inquiry also found that renters by a wide majority
don't want to pay higher rental fees for newer films.

   An anti-abortion candidate held a
narrow lead Tuesday among Republicans in the first state election
since the U.S. Supreme Court's ruling giving states more authority
to limit abortions.
   With 29 percent of the precincts reporting, Richard Lyles, 42,
of Poway was leading with 6,140 votes to 5,129 for GOP rival Tricia
Hunter, 36, of Bonita, the only pro-choice Republican on the ballot
in the heavily GOP district in San Diego and Riverside counties,
   Jeannine Correia, an instructor for the developmentally disabled
from Poway, was leading the Democrats in early returns with 1,508
votes to 729 for Stephen Thorne, 34, of Escondido.
   Due largely to the abortion issue, the unusual special election
to fill an empty Assembly seat managed to overcome the summer
doldrums.
   Voters in the 76th Assembly District in northeast San Diego
County and southwest Riverside County were picking a successor to
GOP Assemblyman Bill Bradley, who died of cancer June 1.
   The likely outcome was that one of the six Republicans and one
of the two Democrats would meet in a runoff general election on
Oct. 3, when the Republican would be the huge favorite in the
GOP-dominated district.
   One candidate would have to win more than 50 percent of the vote
in Tuesday's special primary to win the seat outright.
   The other Republican candidates were Linda Brannon, 42, of
Poway; Ray Foster, 69, of Spring Valley; Bill Hoover, 45, of
Escondido; and Dennis Koolhaas, 34, of Escondido.
   Although major local issues include crime, taxes and population
growth, national attention has focused on the abortion question.
Both pro-choice and anti-abortion advocates say the election is the
first for a state office since the high court's July 3 ruling in
the Webster case.
   The only pro-choice Republican is Hunter, a registered nurse who
is director of surgical services at Chula Vista Community Hospital
and president of the state Board of Registered Nursing.
   The Democrats, Thorne, a San Diego County mental health worker,
and Correia, are also pro-choice.
   Lyles, a management consultant; Hoover, a San Diego police
lieutenant; and Foster, a retired appliance store owner, are
strongly anti-abortion and opposed to state funding of Medi-Cal
abortions. Koolhaas, an aide to state Sen. Bill Craven, and
Brannon, a Poway City Council member and deputy mayor, also oppose
state funding but tend to sidestep questions on the legality of
abortions.

   The district sprawls over the desert area of the two counties,
extending into the populated areas of San Marcos, Escondido, Poway,
Alpine and Bonita. The Riverside County area has 65,439 registered
voters, while San Diego County has 173,541. The district is
overwhelmingly Republican _ 54.2 percent to 32.7 percent Democrat.
   All 10 candidates appeared on the ballot together, regardless of
party and voters could pick whomever they wanted.
   In the Webster decision, the Supreme Court expanded state
authority over abortions. Current state law and state Supreme Court
rulings protect women's abortion rights and require the state to
pay for poor women's abortions. But groups on both sides of the
issue focused on the race.

   The rural Maine house that inspired Andrew Wyeth's
best-known work, the wistful ``Christina's World,'' is up for sale.
   Apple Computer Inc. Chairman John Sculley, who owns the 14-room,
three-story colonial structure on 20 acres in Cushing, Maine, is
asking $1.25 million for it, saying he no longer has the time to
spend there. The house is being sold through Sotheby's
International Realty office in Boston
   ``Each detail, each window has a life of its own,'' wrote Wyeth,
describing the Olson House as it appeared in his ``Weather Side''
painting. ``The weathered clapboards in the sunlight are bathed in
bright light; yet the house had to appear both solid and hollow.''
   From 1929 to 1968, Christina and Alvaro Olson owned the house,
which was built in the mid-1800s.
   Christina Olson was immortalized by Wyeth in 1948. ``Christina's
World'' hangs at the Museum of Modern Art in New York. Wyeth often
painted members of the Olson family.

   The Soviets were listening and
journalists had reported for weeks on Columbia's payload, so why
did military and NASA officials go to the trouble of keeping the
launch time and other details secret?
   ``By being inexact about the launch time, it complicates their
ability to track,'' Lt. Col. Ron Rand, Air Force spokesman, said of
the Soviets. ``They may or may not listen in, but we're going to do
everything we can to keep the payload anonymous.''
   But scientists who attended Tuesday's launch of the Defense
Department's fourth shuttle mission said the military shroud won't
stop the Soviets from finding out all about the reconnaissance
satellite Columbia and its five astronauts are believed to be
launching.
   ``There's no reason I can think of for the secrecy,'' said John
Pike, a space analyst with the Federation of American Scientists.
``In principle, they could run this countdown like they run every
countdown _ maybe this way it's more fun for them.''
   The Soviets will shoot pictures of the satellite even before the
device begins functioning, said Pike. Soviet cameras attached to a
telescope can give a resolution as small as one foot.
   ``If they launch the satellite this morning, the Soviets will
certainly know what it looks like by tonight,'' he said Tuesday.
   NASA lifted its news blackout only briefly, announcing the
launch time nine minutes before blastoff and reporting a
trouble-free ascent into orbit shortly afterward.
   Nevertheless, a Soviet trawler bristling with antennas monitored
the launch from less than 50 miles off Cape Canaveral. Reporters _
and probably the Soviets _ listened in on National Aeronautics and
Space Administration's internal communications channel to follow
the countdown.
   The Soviet trawler and anyone else with a radar system could
track Columbia as soon as it left the launch pad, but NASA refused
to tell reporters where the solid rocket boosters fell, saying that
could help determine the shuttle's trajectory.
   The military clampdown on the mission wasn't airtight, though.
   The shuttle crew, which always boards about 2{ hours before the
scheduled launch time, was trucked out to the pad in the early
morning illuminated by a spotlight and accompanied by a helicopter
escort as well-wishers waved and camera crews filmed.
   Inside the Kennedy Space Center media room, space experts
generally agreed the 20,600-pound satellite would spy on the Soviet
Union with highly sensitive camera lenses and infrared sensors from
300 miles up.
   ``If it's a high inclination (on takeoff), it's going over
Russia and it's going to do some kind of sensing,'' said Harry
Kolcum of the magazine Aviation Week &amp; Space Technology, which
often gives details of secret satellites prior to launch.
   Indeed, the shuttle took off on a north-northeast course that
would take it over Poland, the Soviet Union, Mongolia, China and
parts of the Middle East. Non-military shuttle missions normally
take an eastward path.
   Besides tracking Columbia's launch, the Soviets will be able to
intercept the satellite's emissions, Kolcum said.
   The experts also agreed Columbia carried a second small payload
_ a 275-pound instrument package apparently intended for use in the
Strategic Defense Initiative program, according to Aviation Week.
   ``We've been after them for years to change _ there's no reason
we can think of for keeping it secret,'' Kolcum said.
   Although NASA would like shuttle flights to get the maximum
amount of publicity, the agency must please the Air Force, which
has switched some of its launches to unmanned rockets in the wake
of the Challenger disaster.
   ``If secrecy's judged by them to be in the nation's interest,
I'm for it,'' said J.R. Thompson, deputy administrator of NASA.
   The Defense Department's gag on the mission may irk journalists
and some NASA supporters, but the Soviets appear to empathize with
the secrecy.
   Asked about the launch of a spy satellite over his territory, a
Soviet Embassy press spokesman in Washington said only, ``We don't
comment on such matters.''

<HEAD>Court Lifts Abortion Ban After Learning Woman Already Had Procedure</HEAD>
<DATELINE>OTTAWA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Quebec woman defied a court order obtained by
her former boyfriend and had an abortion, but the Supreme Court
voted unanimously to lift the restriction anyway.
   The case of Chantal Daigle, 21, was the latest and most dramatic
in a series this summer that brought attention to Canada's lack of
a federal abortion law.
   In ruling Tuesday, the Supreme Court said it would give its
reasons later for lifting the injunction obtained July 7 by Ms.
Daigle's ex-boyfriend, 25-year-old Jean-Guy Tremblay. Tremblay, a
former nightclub bouncer, and Ms. Daigle briefly lived together in
Montreal before breaking up.
   The court's nine justices had returned from vacation for an
emergency session in Ottawa Tuesday believing that Ms. Daigle was
entering the 23rd week of pregnancy and could not wait much longer
for the case to be resolved.
   Her lawyer, Daniel Bedard, who evidently had been unaware that
Ms. Daigle went ahead with the abortion, told the court about it in
the middle of the session.
   ``The attorney general of Quebec informed me they suspected my
client of having proceeded to have an abortion,'' Bedard said. ``I
have checked this and it is true.''
   Bedard did not say when or where his client had the abortion.
   He apologized to the court but asked for the case to be heard
because Ms. Daigle, a secretary, still could face contempt charges
that carry a two-year prison term and $42,500 fine.
   Tremblay also heard the news in court and told reporters: ``She
just killed my child. I don't know when _ today or last week.''
   A spokesman for Quebec Justice Minister Gil Remillard said
police called his office Tuesday with details of the abortion from
an informer.
   Remillard said there were ``good reasons to believe that Madame
Daigle had an abortion a week ago,'' but he declined to say where.
   ``I don't think it's opportune to talk about that,'' he said.
   Most doctors in Quebec will not perform abortions after the 20th
week. Abortions are peformed in some parts of the United States
until the 24th week and she hinted after an appeals court upheld
the injunction on July 26 that she might cross the border for the
procedure.
   She said later, however, that she would abide by the Supreme
Court's ruling.
   In fighting the injunction, she said Tremblay had abused her,
and one time threw her to the ground and told her he would
``control and subdue'' her.
   One of her lawyers, Robert Decary, said the question of whether
she still would be subject to contempt of court charges will not be
answered until the Supreme Court gives its reasons for overturning
the injunction.
   About 350 anti-abortion demonstrators maintained a vigil outside
the Supreme Court during the hearing.
   ``I am pretty appalled by the whole thing _ that she went out
and killed her baby,'' said Jim Hughes, president of the Campaign
Life Coalition.
   Judy Rebick, spokeswoman for the National Action Committee on
the Status of Women, which supports the right to abortion, said:
``Chantal has been through the most incredible pressure. She
clearly wanted to obey the law.
   ``But I can't imagine what it must have been like to know that
the clock was ticking in terms of the deadline on that abortion.''
   Clayton Ruby, a Toronto lawyer, said the ruling has likely put
an end to the use of injunctions to prevent women from getting
abortions in Quebec and perhaps other parts of Canada.
   ``No more injunctions in Quebec from vindictive boyfriends,''
said Ruby, represents the Canadian Abortion Rights Action League.
   Canada has been without an abortion law since the Supreme Court
ruled in January 1988 that the existing law's stringent
requirements for approval of an abortion infringed on a woman's
rights. The House of Commons failed to approve any of six proposed
laws in July 1988.
   The outcome was that abortion was left a matter between a woman
and her doctor.
   Last month, however, that premise was challenged by three
provincial court cases, including Ms. Daigles.
   The Ontario Supreme Court threw out an injunction obtained by a
man claiming a father's right, and the woman went ahead with the
abortion. In Manitoba, a woman went ahead with the procedure after
her former boyfriend failed to obtain an injunction.
   Prime Minister Brian Mulroney has said Parliament will tackle
the abortion issue this fall when it returns from its recess but
will not be rushed into a decision.
   The federal government argued before the Supreme Court that
abortion is ``within the exclusive legislative authority of the
Parliament of Canada'' and should not be a matter for provincial
courts to decide.
   The court ruling came in response to Quebec's Court of Appeal,
which voted 3-2 to uphold an injunction issued by Quebec Superior
Court.
   The appeals court based its decision on the province's Charter
of Human Rights. Justice Yves Bernier wrote in the majority
position that ``the child that has been conceived but not born is a
reality that must be taken into account.''

   Pittsburgh police have declared victory over

pedestrians.
   Cmdr. Edward Patterson said officers issued about 600 written
warnings to jaywalkers downtown and in the city's Squirrel Hill and
Oakland neighborhoods since January, when Public Safety Director
Glenn Cannon promised to go after those illegally crossing city

   Patterson said officers stopped issuing written warnings a
couple of months ago and no one was fined $32.50 for jaywalking.
But he said the effort was very successful because it made
pedestrians more aware of the dangers of jaywalking.
   He said pedestrians now are less likely to jaywalk in front of

<HEAD>Maynard Jackson Headed for Third Mayoral Term</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CURT ANDERSON</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The withdrawal of his sole opponent leaves the
way clear for former Mayor Maynard Jackson to return to City Hall
for a third term.
   Michael Lomax, chairman of the Fulton County Commission,
withdrew from the mayoral election Tuesday after polls showed he
was far behind. That left the 51-year-old Jackson, who served two
four-year terms beginning in 1974, with no opposition.
   Lomax, 41, who trailed by 34 percentage points in the polls,
said he was stepping aside to ensure ``this campaign does not
divide our city's family.''
   He might have been able to win, Lomax said, by hitting harder on
crime, but ``the real casualty of that attack ... would have been
the city ... It would have been too costly a victory.''
   The rate of 176 crimes per 1,000 residents in this city of
445,000 is the nation's worst, according to FBI statistics released
Monday.
   There are no other candidates; and if one announced, there
wouldn't be enough time before the Oct. 3 election to mount a
credible campaign, said Atlanta pollster Claibourne Darden.
``There's no time, no body and no money,'' Darden said. ``You've
got three no's.''
   City Councilman Hosea Williams hinted he might run simply to
give Jackson some opposition. ``It would be a tragedy to see
Maynard Jackson walk into City Hall. He ought to be challenged,''
Williams said.
   Jackson, like Lomax a black Democrat, had cemented his populist
appeal among the black majority with growing support from white
businessmen. Lomax ran as the more business-oriented candidate but
failed to broaden his support.
   During his terms, Jackson had often battled with businessmen,
who have gotten along well with outgoing Mayor Andrew Young.
   ``There has been a change in attitudes. And a lot of the old
guard is gone,'' said Angelo Fuster, Jackson's press secretary.
   Darden said the Lomax ads, in which he tried to link Jackson
with Atlanta's crime rate, probably had little impact and forced
Lomax to drain his coffers.
   ``He took that high-risk technique of viciously attacking his
opponent, and he found out why it's a high-risk strategy _ it
doesn't work most of the time,'' Darden said. ``That's the most
important thing. He's broke.''
   Jackson, whose campaign featured a pledge not to allow a
building boom to overrun neighborhoods, said the negative ads ``had
very little effect on me.''
   Lomax's withdrawal allows him to keep his job as commission
chairman, which he would have been forced to give up by the Aug. 16
qualifying deadline.
   Fulton County includes about 90 percent of Atlanta's population,
which is 61 percent black.
   Young, who cannot seek a third consecutive term, said Lomax's
decision to pull out ``probably relieves a lot of friends of both
of them.''
   Williams claimed that Lomax, who worked for Jackson in his
previous administrations, always intended to drop out to prevent a
candidate from running who was unacceptable to the ``black
middle-class power structure.''
   ``I have said from the beginning _ Maynard and Lomax would never
face each other. This was only a political drama,'' Williams said.

   The U.S. dollar slipped modestly against the
Japanese yen Wednesday, while the key index on the Tokyo Stock
Exchange firmed.
   The dollar closed at 138.85 yen, down 0.40 yen from Tuesday's
close of 139.25 yen. It opened at 138.72 yen and ranged between
138.40-139.00 yen.
   The Nikkei Stock Average for 225 selected issues gained 99.79
points, or 0.29 percent, closing at 34,859.27. On Tuesday, the
index climbed 129.10 points.
   Daiwa Bank trader Shinzo Yamamoto said majority of market
players expect the dollar to move lower, and were reluctant to make
major moves ahead of the release of the U.S. producer price index
for July, scheduled for Friday.
   ``The dollar-yen rate is expected to back to the rate before the
unemployment rate release last Friday,'' he said. Earlier last
week, the dollar was moving in the 135-136 yen range but it went up
after the lower-than-expected U.S. jobless rate reported Friday.
   Yamamoto said investors in newly issued U.S. government bonds
were buying the dollar to facilitate their purchases.
   On the stock market, dealers attributed the index's rise largely
to the yen's upswing against the dollar and gains on overseas stock
market during their trading overnight.
   The index's gain was inspired by rises in housing issues, said a
dealer with a major securities firm, speaking on condition of
anonymity.
   The dealer said housing issues attracted participants by
prospects that housing improvement will be a major policy in the
new government that is to be led by legislator Toshiki Kaifu.
   Kaifu was elected chairman of the governing Liberal Democratic
Party Tuesday to succeed Sousuke Uno, who has resigned to take
responsibility for the party's loss in the July 23 election for the
upper house of parliament.
   Kaifu is expected to be named the new prime minister later
Wednesday after approval by the lower house of the parliament.

<TEXT>
   An Ariane rocket blasted into orbit
from this South American space center carrying one satellite to map
the position of stars and another for West German television.
   The Ariane 4 rocket lifted off Tuesday following a brief halt in
the countdown seven seconds before launching so technicians could
check out a problem in the rocket's guidance system.
   The launching followed the U.S. space shuttle Columbia's
successful liftoff earlier in the day. Little is known about the
U.S. mission because its mission was to launch a spy satellite.
   It was the fifth U.S. shuttle flight since September, when
flights resumed following the 1986 Challenger disaster in which
seven astronauts died.
   The Ariane program also experienced a break of some months
following the failure of its 18th mission. Launches were resumed
Sept. 16, 1987.
   Ariane 4's mission is the 33rd by Arianespace, a partnership of
11 European countries and the world leader in the lucrative
commercial launch field.
   Ariane 4, first flown June 15, 1988, is the latest version of
the reliable rocket series developed under the aegis of the
European Space Agency. The rocket has six possible configurations
tailored to individual payloads and is capable of carrying 4,190
pounds to 9,260 pounds into orbit.
   Tuesday's mission will carry a payload of 7,186 pounds into
geostationary orbit, including the satellite Hipparcos, a European
Space Agency mission dedicated to the precise measurement of the
positions and motions of the stars.
   The second satellite is the TV-SAT-2 for the West German
Bundespost telecommunications authority. The direct broadcasting
satellite is to replace TV-SAT-1, which was abandoned in November
1987 after a failure in the deployment mechanism of its solar array.
   Arianespace, which has international orders for 74 launches
worth $2.3 billion, plans to send a rocket into space once a month
between October and January. About 47 percent of the orders are for
European projects, and the rest are for clients outside Europe,
according to Arianespace.

<DATELINE>INDIANAPOLIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A priest blessed four sixth-century mosaics
in a basement vault, where they will stay while an art collector
appeals a court ruling giving the Greek Orthodox Church possession
of the rare Byzantine works.
   The Rev. James Rousakis, pastor of Holy Trinity Greek Orthodox
Church in Indianapolis, read from a prayer book and sang in Greek
over the artworks lying on the basement vault's floor Tuesday.
   He sprinkled them with holy water, then he and Michael
Kyprianou, senior counsel for the Republic of Cyprus, knelt and
kissed each one.
   ``In the orthodox faith, the mosaics are sacred, a consecrated
form of art that is part and parcel of our worship service. Once
they are removed, it's almost as if they're stained or tainted.
They have to be restored,'' Rousakis said.
   U.S. District Judge James E. Noland ruled Thursday that art
dealer Peg Goldberg of suburban Carmel had not obtained legal title
to the mosaics when she purchased them for $1.2 million last summer
in Switzerland from Aydin Dikmen, a Turk living in West Germany.
   The Republic of Cyprus and the church sued Ms. Goldberg last
spring to recover the works, which had been stripped from a church
in Turkish-occupied northern Cyprus in 1979.
   Noland ordered the mosaics returned to the Cypriots. Attorneys
for both sides agreed Tuesday the artworks would be turned over to
the Cypriots but must remain in the Indianapolis vault pending
appeals. They may be removed only under a court order or agreement
by both sides.
   ``Today is a great day for Cyprus,'' said Kyprianou. ``Years of
hard work in securing our artifacts, our cultural heritage, have
not been wasted.''
   Tuesday's prayers included one of forgiveness for Goldberg and
those who took the mosaics from the church and smuggled them out of
the Mediterranean island nation.
   ``We have learned to forgive people,'' Kyprianou said. ``What we
wanted are our mosaics back.''
   The mosaics, pieced together with painted glass about 525 A.D.,
are fragments of a much larger work on the ceiling of a church in
northern Cyprus. The images of Jesus as a boy, the apostles James
and Matthew and an archangel are among only a handful of icons
surviving the first centuries of Christianity.
   Under Tuesday's agreement, Cyprus controls the keys to the vault
but will not move the mosaics or restore them during the appeals
process unless Goldberg agrees.
   She must file an appeal of Noland's decision within 14 days and
must not seek delays during the appeals process.
   ``We very strongly intend to appeal. I just simply totally
disagree with the decision,'' Ms. Goldberg said.

<HEAD>Geologists Warn of Bigger Quakes After 5.2 Temblor</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   An earthquake that broke windows and
contributed to one death in the San Francisco Bay area could herald
even stronger temblors along the San Andreas fault, scientists say.
   ``The stress is building up in the earth and we're going to
start getting large earthquakes,'' said Andy Michael, a
geophysicist with the U.S. Geological Survey in Menlo Park. ``It
should serve as a reminder to prepare.''
   The quake rolled for 10 seconds, shaking buildings and awakening
residents but causing only minor damage, authorities said.
   ``I thought all my windows were going to break,'' said Margaret
Dunlap of San Francisco. ``My whole bed was shaking.''
   It struck at 1:13 a.m. about 50 miles south of San Francisco and
had a magnitude of 5.2 on the Richter scale, according to the U.S.
Geological Survey. It was centered on the San Andreas fault about
15 miles south of San Jose.
   State earthquake experts and the California Office of Emergency
Services issued a warning of increased risk and said another quake
as high as 6.2 on the Richter scale could strike San Francisco in
the next five days.
   ``It certainly shows us the fault is becoming more active,''
said Michael, who added that the quake was the largest in the area
since 1969.
   Geologists said the chances of a bigger quake in the same spot
diminished with each passing hour, however.
   The quake occurred as state and federal emergency services
officials prepared to conduct a two-day test of their response to a
catastrophic earthquake.
   Marilyn Quayle, wife of Vice President Dan Quayle, was in
Sacramento to attend the first day of the test. When she woke up at
5:30 a.m. and saw coverage of the actual earthquake on television,
she thought it was part of the exercise.
   ``I thought, `Gee, this is pretty interesting. They have the
simulation on television already,''' Quayle said.
   In Los Gatos, where the quake was centered, police reported that
19-year-old Matthew James Bignall jumped from his bedroom window
after apparently being startled awake by the earthquake.
   Bignall died of multiple traumatic injuries, according to a
spokeswoman with the Santa Clara County coroner's office. His
half-brother said Bignall had never experienced an earthquake.
   ``My brother was a sound sleeper,'' said Ronald Burger, who
shared the apartment with Bignall. ``And I think the motion of the
quake seemed so violent and disorienting that he just leaped out
the window. He felt he had to get out, and I don't think he knew
what he was doing.''
   Residents reported some broken windows and items falling off
shelves but no major problems, a Los Gatos police dispatcher said.
Damage was confined mostly to Santa Clara and northern Santa Cruz
counties, according to the state Office of Emergency Services in
Sacramento.
   The quake was felt as far away as San Luis Obispo, about 230
miles south of San Francisco. Residents of Sonoma County, 60 miles
to the north, also felt the temblor, according to the state agency.
   A moderate aftershock measuring 4.2 on the Richter scale struck
at 1:44 a.m., followed by a second, stronger aftershock that
measured 4.5 at 8:53 a.m., the USGS said.
   The open-ended Richter scale is a measure of ground motion
recorded on a seismograph. Each increase of one number means a
tenfold increase in ground motion.
   An earthquake of 3.5 on the Richter scale can cause slight
damage in the local area, 4 moderate damage, 5 considerable damage,
6 severe damage. A 7 reading is a ``major'' earthquake, capable of
widespread heavy damage; 8 is a ``great'' quake, capable of
tremendous damage.
   The San Francisco earthquake of 1906, which occurred before the
Richter scale was devised, has been estimated at 8.3 on the scale.

<HEAD>Officer Could Have Stopped Rape, Women's Groups Say</HEAD>

   A police officer could have stopped the rape of a
suspected prostitute without blowing his cover in a drug
investigation, representatives of two women's organizations said.
   ``It doesn't take a police badge to stop a rape,'' said Karen
Ashmore, president of the Dallas Chapter of the National
Organization for Women, which has called for the firing of Officer
Tomas Echartea. ``I certainly would not be comfortable with a
police officer watching over my security and welfare who let a rape
happen.''
   She said the organization will formally ask Groesbeck Police
Chief Chuck Walker to fire Echartea, who said he pretended to be
sick while three men he was investigating on drug charges raped the
woman.
   Walker, who has defended Echartea's non-action, did not return
phone calls Tuesday to The Associated Press.
   Wanda White, a counselor at the Rape Crisis Center in Dallas,
said Echartea's failure to do something was ``a crime in itself.''
   ``If a crime is being committed, somebody should do something
about it ... That's a decision all of us have to make,'' Ms. White
said.
   ``You don't want to ruin your credibility,'' Echartea told The
Dallas Morning News. ``If it had been a life-threatening situation,
I'd have blown my cover. I'd have had to. You just can't let
someone be killed.''
   Echartea said he included the rape in that day's report to his
superiors. The officer who took the report could not be reached for
comment.
   Dallas police said they will begin a criminal investigation and
try to find the woman and ask if she wants to press charges.
   Detectives will also ask Echartea for a full account of what
happened, Dallas Deputy Chief Ray Hawkins said.
   ``I think he had some obligation as one human being to another
to help her as best he could,'' Hawkins said. ``All women, even
prostitutes, have a right not to be raped.''
   Echartea's investigation resulted in the arrests of four people
on charges of selling drugs. He is an officer on the police force
of Groesbeck, 85 miles south of Dallas.
   Dallas County District Attorney John Vance said he did not know
whether state law requires Texas police to intervene in felonies
they observe.
   Echartea first recounted the incident publicly in an interview
last week.

<HEAD>Arkansas Law Would Put Parents in Stockade</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DERMOTT, Ark. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Parents who fail to rein in their kids
could be displayed in a public stockade under a city law that also
sets a curfew for teen-agers.
   ``Until we introduce shame back in crime and punishment, we're
spinning our wheels,'' City Attorney Charles Sidney Gibson said.
   The ordinance approved unanimously by the City Council on Monday
was in response to a street fight Saturday night and an overall
increase in crime during the summer in Dermott, a town of about
5,000 people.
   The fight involved about six youths and adults, and drew some
250 onlookers, Police Chief Jerry Melton said.
   The ordinance calls for delinquent parents to be fined up to
$500 and jailed up to 30 days, ``within stockaded public display
six hours a day'' during certain days of the sentence.
   Gibson said he was unsure about the constitutionality of using a
stockade. Mayor Eugene Farrell said he doubted it would occur
because the city has no stockade.
   Parents who fail to abide by the new ordinance may also have
their photograph placed in the local weekly newspaper for two weeks
with a caption reading ``Irresponsible Parent.''
   Gibson said but the burden of keeping youths out of trouble is
on the parents.
   The ordinance calls for curfew for those younger than 18 from 11
p.m. to 5:30 a.m.
   Parents who can't control their children can sign a statement to
that effect, in which case the minors will be considered delinquent
and have their fate decided by the juvenile courts. Those parents
will have to pay the city $100 for each minor so designated or
render 20 hours of community service.
   The parents also would be required to display a bumper sticker
on their vehicle saying: ``My children are not my responsibility.
They are yours.''

   The dollar edged down against the Japanese yen for
a second day today, while the Tokyo Stock Exchange's key index
gained.
   The dollar closed at 138.85 yen, down 0.40 yen from Tuesday's
finish of 139.25 yen. It opened at 138.72 yen and ranged between
138.40 yen and 139.00 yen.
   On Tuesday, the dollar declined 0.53 yen after gaining 3.58 yen
in the three previous trading days.
   The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues added 99.79
points, or 0.29 percent, closing at 34,859.27. The index had gained
129.10 points Tuesday after a four-day decline.
   Daiwa Bank's Shinzo Yamamoto said many traders expected the
dollar to move lower and were reluctant to make major moves before
the release Friday of the U.S. producer price index for July.
   On the stock market, dealers attributed the rise of the Nikkei
index mainly to the yen's upswing against the dollar and overnight
gains on overseas stock markets.
   A dealer with a major securities firm in Tokyo said construction
and housing issues attracted buyers who anticipated that housing
improvement will be a major policy in the new government to be led
by Toshiki Kaifu, the governing Liberal Democratic Party's choice
to replace outgoing Prime Minister Sousuke Uno.
   Uno resigned to take responsibility for the party's loss in the
July 23 election for the upper house of Parliament.

<HEAD>Teen Killed in Sporadic Rioting in Catholic West Belfast</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BELFAST, Northern Ireland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Young IRA supporters clashed
with security forces on the anniversary of a defunct British policy
of detaining people without trial, and a teen-ager was killed,
police said. Two people were injured in related violence.
   Police said more than 20 people were arrested during
disturbances that occurred in Roman Catholic areas of west Belfast
Tuesday night and continued early today.
   British news reports said a 15-year-old boy died after being
struck by a plastic bullet fired by security troops trying to
control young IRA supporters throwing gasoline bombs and stones and
burning British flags.
   The Royal Ulster Constabulary, Northern Ireland's police force,
would not comment on the incident.
   ``The death is being investigated,'' said a police spokesman,
speaking anonymously in keeping with British custom.
   Crowds threw stones and gasoline bombs at police, and lighted
bonfires and burned British flags, police said. A number of
vehicles, including buses and cars, were hijacked and set on fire.
   On the northern outskirts of Belfast, gunmen burst into a home
and injured a man and woman who had spotted them coming and
barricaded themselves in a room, police said.
   The gunmen tried to batter down the barricade but failed and
then fired a number of shots through it, hitting both people. They
were hospitalized and reported in ``ill but stable'' condition. No
group claimed responsibility.
   Rioting on the anniversary is an annual event although Britain
abandoned the policy of detaining people without trial in 1975. The
violence also occurred amid heightened tension over the 20th
anniversary next week of the deployment of British troops in the
province.
   On Aug. 9, 1971, the British government introduced the policy
for terrorist suspects in Northern Ireland. In predawn raids that
day, 342 people were arrested.
   Britain abandoned the policy in December 1975 following
worldwide condemnation. But Irish Republican Army supporters, who
were the main targets, continue to mark the anniversary with
violent anti-British rallies.
   The mainly Catholic IRA is fighting British rule in Northern
Ireland. It wants to unite the predominantly Protestant province
with the Republic of Ireland, whose population is 95 percent
Catholic.
   Catholic civil rights demonstrations in 1968 created a violent
Protestant reaction, leading to the arrival of British troops who
soon found themselves fighting the IRA. In 1972, the government in
London closed the local parliament and took over direct rule of the
province.

<HEAD>Incumbent Loses Mayoral Race in City Where Murder Rate Is Hot Issue</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ALBANY, Ga. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The incumbent lost but denied that his defeat
in the mayoral primary had to do with FBI statistics showing the
area has the nation's highest murder rate.
   Mayor Larry Bays conceded victory to challenger Tommy Coleman,
who had 57.2 percent of the vote according to final returns
Tuesday. The returns showed Coleman had 8,684 votes to Bays' 6,506.
   FBI statistics released Monday showed the two-county Albany
metropolitan area had the highest rate of murders per 100,000
residents among the nation's metropolitan areas. The statistics
became a last-minute issue in the Democratic primary, where Bays
and Coleman, a banker, were the only candidates.
   Bays did not elaborate about why he lost the primary, but called
upon the city to support Coleman, who faces no Republican
opposition in the Nov. 7 general election.
   Bays told voters Monday that the new FBI statistics are
misleading and that Coleman hurt the city's image by capitalizing
on the murder rate in his campaign.
   Coleman replied: ``I've walked all over Albany. People are
concerned about crime and drug abuse.''
   The FBI Uniform Crime Report said the Albany area had 24.1
murders per 100,000 residents in 1988. The New York City area was
second with 22.7 per 100,000, a total of 3,577 murders compared to
the Albany area's 29. The Albany area's population is 120,560,
compared to New York's 8.6 million.
   Assistant Police Chief Bob Boren said 70 percent of Albany's
murders could be attributed to drug abuse. Police say crack has
become pervasive in the city's poor neighborhoods.
   Bays, an accountant, was elected in 1986 to complete the term of
former Mayor James Gray Sr., who died in office. Bays won his first
full two-year term in 1987, when he ran unopposed.

   A friend of ex-U.S. Attorney General Edwin Meese
III's said he was guilty only of ``being in the wrong place and the
wrong time'' after his conviction on fraud and racketeering charges
in the Wedtech case.
   E. Robert Wallach, a San Francisco lawyer, was convicted Tuesday
of illegally receiving $425,000 from Wedtech to influence Meese and
other government officials in the company's bid for government
contracts.
   A jury acquitted Wallach, 55, of a second racketeering
conspiracy charge stemming from another $100,000 he was accused of
taking from the company.
   The three-month trial in Manhattan federal court was the sixth
to result from the scandal at Wedtech, a defense contractor that
closed after allegations of illegal activity were made public.
   After the verdict, Wallach said he was a victim of
``prosecutorial contortions of the facts'' and would appeal.
   ``I am guilty of nothing but being in the wrong place and the
wrong time,'' he said.
   Two co-defendants, one of whom also was linked to Meese, were
convicted of racketeering, racketeering conspiracy and fraud.
   Meese, who never was charged in the Wedtech scandal, testified
that Wallach had never asked him to do anything improper for
Wedtech.
   Wallach defended Meese, telling reporters: ``Nothing that
happened here casts a single aspersion on that man.''
   The former attorney general was en route to West Point, N.Y.,
Tuesday night to give a speech at the U.S. Military Academy and was
unavailable for comment.
   Wedtech, once a small machine shop in the Bronx, grew into a
$100 million government contractor through a federal program that
set aside contracts for minority-controlled companies. Evidence at
earlier trials showed that Wedtech continued to get the no-bid
contracts through bribe schemes even after it ceased to be a
minority-owned company.
   The announcement of the verdict was interrupted for about 20
minutes when the mother of one of the defendants, R. Kent London,
was overcome with emotion and had trouble breathing. Oxygen was
brought to the courtroom for the woman, who lawyers said has had
two heart attacks previously.
   The defendants were variously charged in a 21-count indictment
with six separate schemes to defraud Wedtech or the government
through false documents and bribery.
   Wallach, a San Francisco lawyer who represented Meese during his
confirmation hearings for attorney general and at a special
prosecutor's investigation in 1984, was convicted of two acts of
racketeering.
   One was defrauding Wedtech in September 1983 for $125,000 which
he billed as work for the company's public stock offering but which
prosecutors said was for his efforts to influence Meese and others
to get an Army contract for Wedtech.
   In the other act, Wallach was found to have illegally received
$300,000 from Wedtech officials, purportedly for helping the
company acquire shipyards and a tug-barge system. The money was
actually in anticipation of Wallach's employment at the Justice
Department where he could influence Meese and others, the jury
found.
   Wallach also was convicted of one charge of conspiracy to
defraud the government and two fraud charges stemming from the
payments.
   He was acquitted of conspiring with W. Franklyn Chinn and London
to defraud Wedtech of $100,000 by covering up the payment to
Wallach. Chinn, Meese's former financial adviser, and London, a
business associate of Chinn, were convicted of that charge, among
others.
   Wallach faces up to 45 years in prison. Chinn and London could
get up to 40 years on their two racketeering convictions and lesser
sentences on the other charges.
   All three men also face fines and forfeitures when they are
sentenced Oct. 16.
   Four former Wedtech executives, including the company's former
chairman, pleaded guilty to bribe- and theft-related charges in
January 1987 and have testified at several trials, including a case
that resulted in the conviction of former Rep. Mario Biaggi,
D-N.Y., on racketeering charges.
   Rep. Robert Garcia, D-N.Y., is awaiting trial on charges that he
extorted $185,000 in cash and a diamond and emerald necklace from
Wedtech.

   Social workers put a 9-year-old girl with
AIDS in a foster home after a report that her mother had sexually
abused her and punished her with drug injections.
   ``Everybody just wants to give her the best we can give her in
the time she has,'' said David Reilly, regional director of the
Texas Department of Human Services. ``She is with the person she
wants to be with and if that works out, there is no reason to move
her.''
   The girl is now in foster care with a family who knows her, and
will likely remain in state custody until she dies, he said.
   State District Judge Tom Rickhoff on Monday held a closed-door
hearing about the girl, citing a law requiring confidentiality in
AIDS cases.
   Her mother, a drug abuser, died of acquired immune deficiency
syndrome.
   The youngster was left to live with relatives, but social
workers became concerned that those surroundings were further
endangering her life, and an emergency court order removed the girl
and placed her in foster care.
   One of the issues believed to have been discussed in the Monday
hearing was whether the child will attend public school.
   ``As far as we're concerned, she's going to go to school,''
Reilly said. ``I don't think we have an obligation to tell the
school (about the disease). In fact, we may be precluded (by law)
from telling them.''

   A brisk batch of cool air swept across the eastern half of the
nation today, breaking record low temperatures from New England to
Texas.
   In Las Vegas, fierce winds registering at 99 mph overturned
private airplanes at McCarran International Airport, and an
accompanying storm caused power outages and minor flooding late
Tuesday.
   The cool air was ushered in by a large high pressure system,
dropping early morning temperatures into the 50s and 60s across the
eastern half of the nation, and into the 40s over the northern and
central Appalachians.
   Record low temperatures were set in Chattanooga, Tenn., with a
reading of 57 degrees; in Hartford, Conn., with a reading of 50
degress; in Houston with 66 degrees; in Mobile, Ala., with 63
degrees; in San Angelo, Texas, with 60 degrees; and in Youngstown,
Ohio, with 44 degrees.
   Temperatures were warmer across the Gulf Coast and the western
third of the nation.
   Florida was hit by scattered showers this morning, with
thunderstorms over the coastal waters of the south Atlantic and
Gulf Coast states.
   Earlier Tuesday evening, a thunderstorm in northeast Florida,
near the Putnam and Volusia County line, produced 1-inch hail and
wind gusts over 60 miles an hour. Lightning set a house on fire in
Putnam County.
   The severe thunderstorm struck Las Vegas with wind gusts to 99
miles an hour Tuesday night, turning over 80 airplanes at the Sky
Harbor and McCarran airports. No injuries were reported.
   Today's forecast called for scattered showers and thunderstorms
from the Carolinas to Florida and the eastern half of the Gulf
Coast; showers and thunderstorms in the afternoon and evening
across the intermountain region and the northern and central
Rockies, and most numerous over the Great Basin area.
   Temperatures were forecast to be in the 70s from the Great Lakes
and the eastern half of the Ohio Valley across the Appalachians to
the northern and Middle Atlantic Coast; in the 60s or 70s along the
Pacific Coast; in the 90s over the Florida Peninsula and from the
southern half of Texas across the southern Plateau to the interior
valleys of California; above 100 degrees over the Desert Southwest;
and in the 80s across the rest of the nation.
   Temperatures at 3 a.m. EDT ranged from 43 degrees at Bradford,
Pa., to 94 degrees at Phoenix, Ariz.

   Americans across the country turned on porch lights and held
candlelight marches and block parties in a neighborly show of unity
against crime in the sixth annual National Night Out.
   ``We're trying to send a message to criminals that we're taking
the streets back,'' said police Lt. Don Wactor in Orange, N.J.,
where police and residents held a rally Tuesday in front of a
building plagued by drug dealers.
   People from two communities in Minnesota formed a human chain
across a bridge to symbolize two neighborhoods uniting to fight
crime.
   ``Most people want to be neighborly, but they need some excuse,
some catalyst,'' said Matt Peskin, coordinator of the program for
the National Association of Town Watch Inc. ``It gives them
something to do besides sitting on their porch.''
   Peskin, who lives outside Philadelphia in Wynnewood, said more
organized events were held this year than last. By night's end, he
expected 20.5 million Americans in more than 7,600 communities to
participate, an increase of more than 2 million over last year's
estimate.
   Sponsors arranged to have the U.S. Air Force's Defense
Meteorological Satellite photograph the country to show the glow of
porch lights.
   The Strategic Air Command plans to give sponsors a composite
picture of the event created by one pass of the satellite over the
eastern United States at 9:30 p.m. and a photograph of the western
half a few hours later.
   Police officers said they hoped the evening would involve
residents in crime prevention by getting them to know their
neighbors and to report crime when they see it.
   ``People can be our eyes and ears in the community, and they
need to be,'' Pittsburgh Public Safety Director Glenn Cannon said.
``Nobody has to tolerate illegal drugs in their community and no
one has to tolerate violent crime.''
   FBI Director Williams Sessions turned on a giant light bulb in
Washington, D.C., to kick off the event, which he called a ``symbol
of solidarity and determination.''
   In Rochester, N.Y., a ``dunk-the-criminal booth'' allowed
residents to take out their frustrations on a man dressed as a
criminal.
   In Cincinnati, residents met in the streets to discuss crime.
   ``Most of streets have cul-de-sacs which make good meeting
places. Everybody brings a lawn chair and soft drinks,'' said Evie
Landigran, who organized the effort for the neighborhood of Paddock
Hills.
   Neighborhood watch groups in Hartford and other Connecticut
cities celebrated with block parties and barbecues that featured
police officers as guests of honor.
   In the New York City, Bronx Borough President Fernando Ferrer
held a candlelight march with residents active in local anti-drug
campaigns. In a seedy thoroughfare in lower Manhattan, residents
held a karate demonstration and an after-dark dance contest
featuring the latest rap sounds.
   Residents in Kansas City walked through their neighborhoods with
candles and flashlights. ``I want to do anything that can drive
drugs out of our communities,'' said Florence Purvey.
   National Night Out, created by Peskin, presents an award each
year to the city that saw the largest decrease in crime. Last year,
Houston won the cup when major crime decreased 48 percent on the
night of the event.

<HEAD>Palmer Begins Forming Cabinet, Says He Will be Less `Exciting'</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WELLINGTON, New Zealand (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   New Prime Minister Geoffrey
Palmer today began forming his Cabinet and said there would be no
domestic or foreign policy changes under his administration.
   He also said his administration would be ``less exciting'' than
that of his predecessor, David Lange, who announced his resignation
Monday for health reasons.
   A Labor Party caucus elected Palmer prime minister on Tuesday
and chose Helen Clark to replace him as deputy prime minister.
   Palmer, a lawyer, says he pales in comparison to the colorful
Lange, who for five years captured world attention by arguing with
the United States and France over nuclear issues.
   Lange's departure followed major economic change in New Zealand,
a former British colony of 3.3 million in the South Pacific.
Palmer, 47, promised to pursue the Lange vision of an independent
New Zealand.
   He also reiterated that there would be no change in the nation's
anti-nuclear stance, which led to U.S. warships being banned from
the nation's ports.
   The United States welcomed Palmer's appointment, noting he had
spent considerable time in the United States as an academic.
   Asked at a news conference today if he was prepared to meet
President Bush, Palmer replied that he would meet anybody at any
time.
   Earlier, he said: ``We want to have dialogue with the
Americans.''
   Lange's resignation prompted tributes from around the South
Pacific. The prime minister of Papua New Guinea, Rabbie Namaliu,
said he would miss Lange's ``fearless dipolomacy.''
   Prime Minister Bob Hawke of Australia said that despite some
policy disagreements, the men were friends.
   Cook Island Prime Minister Geoffrey Henry said history would
judge Lange as New Zealand's most effective prime minister so far.
   Palmer, a former attorney general, said he would probably
complete his Cabinet appointments by Friday.
   He also said he offered Lange, also a lawyer, the position of
attorney general and that Lange had said he might consider the
offer.
   Palmer said it was certain he would have discussions with U.S.
ambassador-designate Della Newman when she arrives in New Zealand
to take up her post.
   ``But diplomacy is best not conducted through loud speakers in
the media,'' he said.

   Judges closed down a dump where a fire
destroyed part of an interstate highway and officials said it could
take as long as a year to reopen the busy commuter link.
   The two-judge panel of the Superior Court's Appellate Division
on Tuesday ordered Hub Recycling and Scrap Metals Co. to remove the
waste under Interstate 78 and adjoining Route 22. They put the
cleanup under the state Department of Environmental Protection's
supervision.
   Gov. Thomas H. Kean declared a state of emergency to obtain
federal funds to rebuild the charred interstate.
   Flames and heat from a giant pile of debris early Monday buckled
an elevated portion of Interstate 78, a critical east-west link in
one of the nation's busiest highway interchanges between New York
City and Pennsylvania. The fire was extinguished Tuesday afternoon.
   State officials said repairs that forced the closing of a
1\-mile stretch of the highway could take a year. Traffic has been
rerouted from the roadway, which carried five lanes of traffic in
both directions.
   A report in The New York Times today said three of the five
eastbound lanes were supported by a set of columns and beams that
were sound enough to carry traffic, and said that section might
open within a month or so.
   Kean lauded the judges' decision, saying it would pave the way
for a cleanup at the site, which authorities say is an illegal dump
and waste transfer station. Hub says it's a recycling facility.
   State officials have been trying for two years to halt the
pile-up of waste at the four-acre site.
   Essex County Counsel H. Curtis Meanor, a former federal judge,
estimated the site contained 50,000 tons of waste beneath the
highways, and that it would cost about $100 per ton, or about $5
million, to clear it.

   The dollar held steady in quiet morning trading in
Europe, with little news in the market to influence its movements.
   Gold prices were lower.
   Traders said they didn't expect any news to move the market
until Friday's release of the U.S. producer price index and retail
sales figures for July.
   Market activity was very quiet, they said, with intermittent
interest in the dollar and more sustained activity on cross
currency rates.
   In Tokyo, the dollar fell 0.40 yen to a closing 138.85 yen.
Later, in London, it rose to 138.95 yen.
   Other dollar rates at mid morning compared with late Tuesday:
   _1.8953 West German marks, up from 1.8900
   _1.6323 Swiss francs, up from 1.6270
   _6.4075 French francs, up from 6.3995
   _2.1382 Dutch guilders, down from 2.1398
   _1,363.00 Italian lire, up from 1,362.50
   _1.1710 Canadian dollars, down from 1.1720
   In London, the dollar rose against the British pound. It cost
$1.6230 to buy one pound, cheaper for buyers than $1.6250 late
Tuesday.
   Gold opened in London at $365 a troy ounce, down from $365.45
late Tuesday. At midmorning, the city's main bullion dealers fixed
a recommended price of $365.15.
   In Zurich the bid price was $365.20, down from $365.85 late
Tuesday.
   Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold fell $1.40 to close at $365.88.
   Silver was quoted at $5.16 an ounce, unchanged from Tuesday.

<HEAD>Dallas Suburbs' Vote Could Derail $2.45 Billion Transit System</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DARRYL EWING</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>DALLAS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A suburban referendum on the metropolitan area's
bus system could determine whether a long-delayed plan to build a
light-rail mass transit system ever gets rolling.
   Transit supporters fear a vote by five suburbs to withdraw from
Dallas Area Rapid Transit bus service will derail a $2.45 billion
plan to construct 66 miles of rail lines by 2010. The plan also
calls for an 18-mile rail link connecting downtown to the
Dallas-Fort Worth International Airport and 37 miles of bus and car
pool lanes for suburban commuters.
   ``If this plan fails, it's going to set Dallas back 10 to 15
years,'' said DART board member Charles Clack.
   The transit authority approved the rail plan in June after six
years of delays.
   Critics in the suburbs of Irving, Plano, Carrollton, Rowlett and
Coppell say the authority has taken too long already and that their
bus service is not commensurate with the tax dollars they
contribute to DART. They say widening roads and adding tollways
would be cheaper than a rail system.
   ``There is a great mistrust of DART,'' said Pat Cotton, who has
worked against the rail plan. ``People feel there have been
expenditures that have not been wise.''
   ``Of course, we've always had our own cars and we like to drive
up to our own spots. That kind of philosophy has been in place in
Texas for years,'' Clack said.
   But that philosophy creates rush-hour gridlock on Dallas
freeways.
   Of more than 974,000 area residents, about 150,000 ride DART
buses daily. DART estimates 214,000 riders will use the transit
system once it is complete.
   DART spokesman Ron Whittington fears even more congested
freeways if suburban bus service ends. ``You're going to put about
20,000 more drivers back on the roads,'' he said. ``That's scary.''
   In 1983, voters approved a 1-cent sales tax to finance a $5.5
billion regional bus and rail network. A sagging economy forced the
authority to scale back plans and ask voters last year to approve
the issue of $1 billion in bonds to start rail construction. Voters
in the 16 cities served by DART said no.
   Now DART officials see the Aug. 12 suburban referendums as
crucial for the area's growth.
   ``This is not a vote on DART, it's a vote on regional
transportation,'' said board member Jim Jenne of Carrollton. He
believes corporations won't move to Dallas unless they're assured
of regional transit.
   ``Maybe we can get by without mass transit for a couple of
years,'' Clack said. ``But a little down the line, we're going to
need one. You can't just snap your fingers and have it appear. You
have to start now.''

   A bomb blast at the Justice Ministry today
caused minor damage but no casualties, police said.
   The blast came at a time when the justice minister, Oltan
Sungurlu, has come under criticism from the opposition and press
because of a 42-day-old hunger strike by 200 leftist inmates.
   No group claimed immediate responsibility for the bombing.
   Investigators said the explosive device was placed inside a
garbage can in the ladies' room on the first floor of the ministry.
   The semi-official Anatolia News Agency reported police detained
one person, but the report was not immediately confirmed.
   The explosion came a week after two leftist inmates died due to
what officials said was dehydration from the hunger strike.
Newspapers and other inmates said the men were beaten to death.
   The deaths came after they were transferred along with 280
fasting prisoners from Eskisehir province to a prison in Aydin, 300
miles west.
   The two inmates belonged to the outlawed Kurdish Labor Party, a
guerrilla group that is fighting for an independent state in the
southeastern parts of Turkey.
   The inmates began a hunger strike at Eskisehir prison on June 28
to protest restrictions imposed by prison authorities after it was
discovered that the inmates were trying to tunnel to freedom.

   Eighteen criminals were executed in the
southern Chinese city of Canton today, including a man from the
nearby Portuguese enclave of Macao, a pro-Beijing newspaper
reported.
   The crimes committed by the condemned men included robbery,
murder and rape, the Chinese-language New Evening Post reported
from Canton. It appeared the cases were not connected with the
pro-democracy protests that erupted across China beginning in April.
   Macao's Liang Mingyuan, 40, was executed for masterminding a
plan to steal gold from sellers involved in the Canton black market
two years ago, the report said.
   Also executed were two officers of the armed police accused of
smuggling and five roaming bandits accused of robbery.
   China releases no figures on capital punishment, but more than
10,000 criminals are believed to have been executed since 1983,
when an anti-crime drive was initiated.
   Murder, rape and multiple thefts are among the most common
crimes in China leading to execution, normally carried out by a
bullet to the back of the head.

<TEXT>
   The city's new daily newspaper, the St. Louis
Sun, is scheduled to hit the streets Sept. 25, its owner says.
   ``We're right on budget and right on schedule,'' Ralph Ingersoll
II, the newspaper's chairman and editor in chief, said at a news
conference Tuesday in the Sun's downtown newsroom overlooking the
Mississippi River and the Gateway Arch.
   The Sun, a morning tabloid, will cost 25 cents every day except
Saturday when it will publish an expanded weekend edition that will
sell for $1 and include two glossy magazines and advertising
supplements.
   The Washington Times, a newspaper owned by affiliates of the
South Korean-based Unification Church headed by Rev. Sun Myung
Moon, was the last major metropolitan newspaper to be started in
the United States. It began in 1982.
   Ingersoll, chairman of the Princeton, N.J.-based Ingersoll
Publications Co., said the Sun hopes to lead the way in the
newspaper industry with its expanded Saturday edition.
   ``Changing lifestyles and workplace habits convince us that
Saturday morning will continue to increase in importance as the
prime time for weekend newspaper publication,'' he said.
   Ingersoll's publishing company owns 40 daily and 150 non-daily
newpapers in the United States and also publishes 14 papers in
England and Ireland. The company employs 11,000 people.
   It also operates a chain of suburban newspapers in the St. Louis
area, which Ingersoll said has helped the Sun get started.
   The Sun will compete with the St. Louis Post-Dispatch, which has
operated alone in the city since 1986 when its longtime rival, the
St. Louis Globe-Democrat, folded.
   The Post-Dispatch has a circulation of 371,000 during the week
and 551,000 on Sunday. It costs a quarter during the week and its
Sunday edition costs $1.
   Ingersoll said the Sun hopes to have 75,000 subscribers
immediately and will be able to break even if circulation climbs to
100,000. He said he's not looking to pass the Post-Dispatch in
circulation numbers.
   The new newspaper has hired about a third of its editorial staff
and has trained its display advertising staff, which will begin
selling ads soon, Ingersoll said.
   A sample front-page showed a bright and colorful layout with
only headlines and teasers promoting sports, business and other
news stories inside the paper.

   Israel will refuse to start negotiations for a
hostage or prisoner swap until it receives ``signs of life'' about
three Israeli soldiers held captive in Lebanon, Defense Minister
Yitzhak Rabin said.
   ``As long as we don't know who is alive and who isn't, we will
discuss no other details,'' Rabin said Tuesday night at a meeting
of his Labor Party's Central Committee.
   Earlier Tuesday, Rabin told reporters after meeting U.N. envoy
Marrack Goulding that confirming the Israelis were alive must be a
first stage in contacts with Shiite radicals believed to hold the
Israeli soldiers and most of the 16 foreign hostages in Lebanon.
   As a second step, Rabin added, Israel would provide the Shiites
with information on the whereabouts of an estimated 300 of their
followers imprisoned by Israel.
   ``Only then will we negotiate the terms for the exchange,'' he
said.
   Rabin also said Israel considers the International Committee of
the Red Cross to be ``the most suitable'' channel for negotiating a
swap with the pro-Iranian Hezbollah movement, an umbrella
organization for Shiite fundamentalist groups in Lebanon.
   Hezbollah today claimed responsibility for a suicide car bomb
attack in south Lebanon that injured five Israeli soldiers and a
Lebanese militiaman. The two suicide car bombers died in the blast
five miles north of the Israeli border.
   Rabin indicated there had been little progress made so far in
resolving the hostage crisis, by saying, ``Unfortunately until this
moment no Lebanese organization turned to the International Red
Cross with any proposal.''
   ``Whoever wants real business, it's better to turn to the
International Red Cross with whatever terms he has in mind,'' Rabin
added.
   Goulding, who returned to New York after shuttling between
Beirut and Tel Aviv on the hostage situation, said his meeting with
Rabin focused on U.N. demands that Israel release a Moslem cleric
kidnapped by Israeli commandos from south Lebanon on July 28.
   Rabin rejected the demand saying 33-year-old Sheikh Abdul Karim
Obeid would be freed only as part of a swap for Israeli and foreign
hostages in Lebanon.
   The Israeli leader also differed with Goulding's assertion that
Obeid's capture ``does not help'' efforts to free hostages. ``I
believe the fact it was done provides a bigger chance to return the
Israeli soldiers missing and the captives home,'' Rabin said.
   The three Israeli soldiers believed to be held by Hezbollah are
Rahamim Alsheikh and Yosef Fink, who were captured in south Lebanon
in February 1986, and an air navigator, Ron Arad, shot down while
on a bombing mission near Sidon in October 1986.
   Shlomo Alsheikh, the father of one of the Israeli prisoners held
by the Shiites, was quoted today by the Yediot Ahronot daily as
saying he learned 10 days ago ``for the first time that he (his
son, Rahamim) is alive.''
   ``That's what we were told. We were told that there is
information our son is alive and well, thank God,'' Alsheikh said.
   Alsheikh did not make clear where he received the information,
and Israeli officials refused to discuss the report.

<HEAD>Scientists Prepare For Field Test of Genetically Altered Virus</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Scientists are hoping the microbes they
tinkered with will vanish quickly after the nation's first open-air
field test of a pesticide made of genetically engineered virus.
   Weather permitting, scientists from Cornell University's Boyce
Thompson Institute for Plant Research intended to spray the virus
today on a field of cabbage at the New York State Agricultural
Experiment Station.
   The test is designed to see if a genetically disabled virus will
disappear from the environment quickly after attacking the insects
it is aimed at destroying, rather than lingering in the field, said
H. Alan Wood, the virologist who will direct the test.
   ``It's a hurdle in terms of the genetic engineering of viruses
and quite a significant step if it's successful,'' Wood said. ``It
would be a big step for biological control.''
   The test could provide new ways to fight plant diseases and
pests while lessening dependence on pesticides. About 3 billion
pounds of pesticides are used in the United States each year.
   Scientists are aiming their test at the cabbage looper, a pale
green caterpillar that attacks more than a dozen kinds of
vegetables, including cabbage, beets, broccoli and cauliflower.
   The virus they are using is identical to naturally occurring
strains known as baculoviruses, which can cause viral epidemics in
many agricultural and forest insect pests. Researchers will remove
a gene that provides a protective protein coat from the virus.
   Scientists eventually hope to splice a new gene into the virus,
one that would make it more deadly to pests, Wood said. The new,
more virulent virus could be sprayed onto plants, where it would
kill pests and then die quickly.
   The field test will be conducted on a two-acre, doughnut-shaped
plot containing 20,000 cabbage plants, of which 2,500 plants in the
center will be sprayed with the virus.
   The plot will be monitored through 1991.
   The Environmental Protection Agency approved the field test in
July after determining it posed no environmental or human health
hazards.
   Several genetically altered bacteria have been tested before,
but this is the first altered viral insecticide tested in the
field, said Fred Betz, a biologist at the U.S. Environmental
Protection Agency.

<HEAD>Man Says Voices Told Him to Kill Bush</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A bank robber told authorities he plotted to
assassinate President Bush and came close to making an attempt on
Bush's life in Michigan four months ago.
   John Spencer Daughetee, 34, told Oakland, Calif., police and FBI
agents about the attempt after he was arrested during a bank
robbery Friday. Daughetee was being held in Oakland without bond
Tuesday on bank robbery charges.
   Police and Secret Service agents said Daughetee has no apparent
motive for stalking Bush.
   ``He admitted that at some point he started hearing voices and
that he has been following the president around the U.S. in an
effort to get close enough to kill him,'' Sgt. Sam Maddux, a
robbery investigator with the Oakland Police Department said
Tuesday.
   Authorities said Daughetee has a history of psychological
problems and was investigated several years ago in Indiana after
making threats against then-President Reagan.
   Maddux said Daughetee, believed to be from Flora, Ind., said
during interviews with authorities that he was in a crowd of about
4,000 people that attended Bush's speech in the Detroit enclave of
Hamtramck on April 17. Bush announced economic incentives for
Poland during the speech.
   James Huse, special agent in charge of the Secret Service office
in Detroit, said Daughetee claimed he had been in Hamtramck the
night before Bush's speech.
   ``He told agents he had picked out the perfect spot to shoot
from but couldn't reach it on speech day because of metal
detectors,'' Huse said. ``He then ran to several areas trying to
get close enough for a shot but before he could shoot, the
president finished and left the podium.''
   Maddux said Daughetee had spoken of carrying guns including a
.22-caliber automatic pistol and a .380-caliber automatic handgun,
but it wasn't clear what gun Daughetee had in Hamtramck.
   Daughetee had $1,400 when he was arrested Friday for robbing
Gateway Savings in Oakland, Maddux said.
   Sgt. Greg Bingham of the Oakland police said Daughetee said he
needed the money to ``go back east and kill the president.''
   Daughetee also told investigators he committed a spree of bank
heists dating back to November 1986, beginning with a bank in
Sacramento, Calif. Maddux said the other banks Daughetee admitted
to robbing were in Miami; Charlotte, N.C.; Baltimore; Portland,
Ore.; and San Francisco.
   Two of the banks, Gibraltar Savings and First Interstate Bank,
both in San Francisco, were robbed Friday before Gateway Savings.

<HEAD>U.N. Sources Say One Killed in Ammunition Dump Explosion</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By EDITH M. LEDERER</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>KABUL, Afghanistan (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   One man died after a rocket hit an
ammunition dump, triggering explosions that lasted more than 3{
hours, U.S. sources said today. Relief workers said eight people
were injured.
   The man, who lived about 500 yards from the dump in the Khair
Khana district of northwest Kabul, was running from his house after
the rocket hit at dusk Tuesday and ammunition and rockets in the
dump started to explode, said the U.N. sources, who spoke on
condition of anonymity.
   Foreign Ministry spokesman Mohammad Nabi Amani said he expected
to have information on the death later today.
   The Avicina emergency hospital, which acts as a coordinating
center for casualties, reported five Tuesday after the dump started
exploding. But today, doctors there said they knew of no dead or
injured and that casualties might have been taken to military
hospitals.
   Relief workers, speaking on condition of anonymity, said eight
people suffered serious injuries in rocket attacks citywide Tuesday
night, some in the Khair Khana district.
   After intense rocket attacks on Kabul for four days, the city
had been relatively quiet until about half a dozen rockets hit the
hillside dump.
   Clouds of black smoke billowed over the northwestern part of
Kabul, flames danced in the night sky and explosions boomed across
the city, several rocking buildings. At one point, all the lights
in the city went out for 20 minutes in a power outage.
   But this morning the Khair Khana district was bustling again,
including the streets just below the hillside dump, which looked
like a burned field. In some houses the windows were broken and the
floors were covered with ash, but otherwise the area looked
untouched by the explosions.
   The government blames Moslem guerrillas for rockets that have
slammed into Kabul almost daily since late June.
   More than 115 rockets have hit the city since Saturday. More
than 40 hit the capital Monday, the worst day of the recent blitz.
Eight people were reported killed.
   The U.S.-backed guerrillas fighting to oust the Soviet-allied
government have tried repeatedly with little success to hit
military targets in Kabul.
   Most of the rockets since late June have struck civilian areas.
At least 281 people have been killed and 745 injured in the
attacks, and a car bombing July 15 killed 19 and wounded 56,
according to U.N. sources.
   A military source, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the
Afghan army recently moved a large amount of ammunition from the
city's airport to the depot.
   In a report quoting the official Afghan Bakhtar news agency, the
official Soviet news agency Tass said government forces seized 300
artillery shells and hundreds of mines in Monday's operations. The
report gave no other details.
   The government announced Tuesday that three men had been
captured in connection with the car bombing.
   Amani, the Foreign Ministry spokesman, said the men belonged to
``counterrevolutionary organizations'' based in the Pakistani city
of Peshawar. He said they had admitted masterminding the explosion.
   The most powerful guerrilla forces are based in Pakistan.
   Amani said police were searching for other conspirators
identified by the three men.

<HEAD>Savannah River Workers Drank Contaminated Water</HEAD>
<DATELINE>AIKEN, S.C. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   More than 100 Savannah River Site employees
drank water contaminated with a carcinogenic solvent for 15 months,
but an official from the nuclear weapons plant says they were not
harmed.
   The incident occurred after a drinking water supply line was
mistakenly connected to a system carrying tainted process water,
said Becky Apter, a spokeswoman for Westinghouse Savannah River
Co., which operates the plant for the government.
   None of the workers have shown symptoms of illness associated
with trichloroethylene, or TCE, a potent degreaser and solvent that
was found in the water, she said.
   ``The health effects are nonexistent,'' Ms. Apter said. ``What
our doctors told us was the level of exposure they consumed was so
low that there would be minimal health effects.''
   Reactors at Savannah River, the nation's sole source of tritium
for nuclear weapons, have been closed for more than a year because
of maintenance and safety problems.
   The mistake occurred in March 1988, when a water line was being
installed to a new building. Du Pont, which built the facility and
operated it for about 30 years, was plant operator at the time and
the work was performed by a subcontractor Ms. Apter would not
identify.
   A Du Pont engineer who was responsible for the job certified it
had been done correctly, Ms. Apter said. But state officials said
the engineer was working from an erroneous blueprint.
   Ms. Apter declined to identify the engineer, who she said was
still employed at the facility.
   Medical records for all the employees were checked after the
contamination was discovered, and physicians found no related
health problems, she said.
   The contaminated water was found in only one building, officials
said after testing water in all buildings in the administration
area.
   ``Although federal drinking water standards were exceeded, the
levels monitored in the service water are well below what would be
considered dangerous,'' said Jim Hightower, a Savannah River
physician. ``However, we will continue to assess any possible
health effects as part of the annual medical examination program.''
   Samples from the building with the contaminated water showed
levels of TCE averaged 26 parts per billion. The Environmental
Protection Agency considers 5 parts per billion a safe level.
   TCE has caused cancer in laboratory animals and is suspected of
doing so in humans. The chemical also has been shown to cause
damage to the liver and other organs, as well as sterility,
developmental problems in children and damage to the nervous
system, according to the EPA.
   The mixup in the water systems was discovered last month when
repairs were made to the system, Ms. Apter said. When workers were
unable to turn off the water they realized the two systems were
connected.

   The guests wore khaki and olive green
and a kazoo band played ``Here Comes the Bride'' as two happy
campers tied the knot at the Boy Scout Jamboree.
   Kathy Duffy, 46, and Jay Holmes, 45, were wed Monday night in
what is believed to be the first wedding ceremony performed at the
event, held every four years.
   ``The chaplains said they've had births here, they've had
deaths, they've had conversions, but to the best of anyone's
knowledge this is the first wedding,'' said Tom Bennett, a
spokesman for the Boy Scouts.
   ``There were people here who didn't know the bride or the groom,
they just came for the party.''said Mary Ellen Baker, an associate
of Duffy's.
   Duffy and Holmes met three years ago during an Scout leader
training course in New Mexico and had planned to marry next April.
They live 10 miles from each other in Texas.

   Here is a glance at forest fires Tuesday in the West:
   California: Both the 15,300-acre Vail fire in Cleveland National
Forest east of San Diego and the 7,500-acre Balch fire in Sierra
National Forest east of Fresno were declared contained Monday.
   Idaho: Fires still burned on 104,000 acres in the western and
central parts of the state. Several dozen residents of Lowman, 70
miles northeast of Boise, were allowed back in their homes Tuesday
as firefighters had secured lines around 60 percent of the
43,000-acre Lowman Fire.
   Oregon: Lightning started new fires in southwestern Oregon. But
the 12,000-acre Monument Rock Fire in the Malheur and
Wallowa-Whitman national forests was contained. Crews were close to
containing the 23,350-acre Canal Fire on the eastern boundary of
the Eagle Cap Wilderness near Enterprise.
   Utah: The 1,700-acre Chalk Creek blaze, 45 miles east of Salt
Lake City, was contained and expected to be controlled by Wednesday.
   Washington: Scores of lightning fires were contained before they
grew to more than a half-acre. A 3,000-acre fire still burned in
range land and timber on the Colville Indian Reservation in the
state's northeastern section.

<HEAD>Civil Rights Center Won't Confirm Reported Resignation of King's
Son</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SONYA ROSS</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Martin Luther King Jr. Center for Non-Violent
Social Change has refused to confirm or deny reports that the civil
rights leader's 28-year-old son is resigning as center president.
   A source within the civil rights community, who spoke on
condition of anonymity, said Tuesday that differences over how the
center should be managed prompted Dexter King and executive
director Barbara Williams-Skinner to decide to resign. The source
did not say what those differences were.
   Dexter King was named president in January and officially took
office April 4, the anniversary of his father's assassination,
saying he wanted to place the center on a solid financial base and
cut its dependency on donations.
   Messages seeking comment from King at his entertainment company,
Visionary Development Corp., and his home were not returned, nor
were calls to at least six King Center board members.
   The board said it would issue ``a definitive statement at an
appropriate time.''
   The Atlanta Journal-Constitution reported that Ms.
Williams-Skinner was said to have clashed with Dexter King's aunt,
Christine King Farris, who controls the center's finances, over
budgetary and program proposals.
   The newspaper also quoted Mayor Andrew Young as characterizing
the reported resignation as a family dispute fueled by normal
tension between generations. Dexter King's mother, Coretta Scott
King, is the center's chief executive officer.
   Young, a lieutenant of Martin Luther King Jr. during the 1960s,
was among board members of the center who received copies of a
letter of Dexter King's resignation, The New York Times reported
today.
   City Councilman Hosea Williams, another former King lieutenant,
said the center recently had placed itself in competition with the
Southern Christian Leadership Conference, which Martin Luther King
founded, for leadership of the civil rights movement.
   ``The center's purpose was to perpetuate the legacy of Dr. King,
but not to carry on the whole movement,'' Williams said. ``When
they started talking about leading the movement, freeing black
folk, they started competing, and both got hurt.''
   Williams said center staff members told him of conflict and
asked for his help in resolving it, ``but I told them I wasn't in a
position to get involved, because people would interpret that as I
was anti-Mrs. King.''

   Two abortion-rights activists running
in the first state election since the Supreme Court ruling on
abortion emerged the apparent winners in the eight-way race for an
Assembly seat and will meet in a runoff Oct. 3.
   Tuesday's results occurred in a district known for its
conservatism even by Southern California standards.
   ``I believe the abortion issue was the deciding factor in this
election,'' said Jeannine Correia, who was the top vote-getter
among the two Democrats in the race.
   The big winner appeared to be Tricia Hunter, the only
abortion-rights candidate among six Republicans, who made a late
surge to edge past candidate Richard Lyles. Hunter had 14,658 votes
to 14,446 votes for Lyles.
   Some 500 absentee ballots will be counted later this week, said
Deborah Seiler, a spokeswoman for the Secretary of State's office.
Lyles said he was optimistic the absentee votes would reverse the
outcome.
   Voters in the sprawling district, which covers arid sections of
San Diego and Riverside counties, were picking a successor to GOP
Assemblyman Bill Bradley, who died of cancer June 1.
   Voters were free to pick from among six Republicans and two
Democrats, who appeared on the same ballot. None of the candidates
won 50 percent of the vote, forcing a runoff between the top
vote-getter from each party.
   The district is largely Republican _ 54.2 percent to 32.7
percent Democrat _ making the GOP candidate an overwhelming
favorite.
   Hunter, 36 of Bonita, is a nurse and president of the state
Board of Registered Nursing.
   Activists on both sides of the abortion issue regarded the
election as a significant indicator of public opinion. It was the
first election for a state office since the July 3 Supreme Court
ruling in Webster vs. Health Reproductive Services Inc., which gave
states more authority to limit abortions.
   ``If it hadn't been for the $100,000 the nurses association put
into Tricia Hunter's campaign, the abortion issue never would have
gained prominence in this race because she never would have been
seen as a viable candidate,'' said Lyles, a 42-year-old management
consultant from Poway.
   ``It certainly gained more attention than it would have if the
Webster decision hadn't come down, but our research showed most of
the voters were concerned about other issues like water and
education.''
   Correia, an instructor for the developmentally disabled who
lives in Poway, received 3,186 votes while the other Democrat on
the ballot, Stephen Thorne, 34, of Escondido, got 1,256 votes.
Thorne also is pro-choice.
   The district has about 240,000 registered voters.

   Investigators today searched for five missing
people and the cause of a blaze that killed at least three people
at a rooming house whose landlord had been charged with failing to
install an adequate sprinkler system.
   ``It's going to be a long and tedious job,'' said Deputy Fire
Chief William Conway. ``The building's not very stable and we're
going to be taking it apart brick by brick.''
   Authorities said building violations contributed to the still
uncertain number of deaths and several injuries suffered among
dozens of tenants who lowered themselves to safety on ropes after
the fire broke out early Tuesday.
   Trooper Dennis Galvin of the state fire marshal's office began
inspecting the Ben Crest Plaza today and said he hoped to learn
where the blaze began and whether the alarm system was working.
``We're just getting our feet wet,'' he said.
   The city previously had filed a criminal complaint against the
building's owner for failing to install a proper sprinkler-alarm
system. An attorney for the landlord said the sprinkler
installation was to have begun next week.
   Benjamin Amero, 50, jumped to his death while trying to escape
the fire shortly after it broke out about 12:30 a.m. Two other
unidentified victims were recovered from the building's rubble.
   State Fire Marshal Joseph O'Keefe said an adequate
sprinkler-alarm system would have doused the hallways and alerted
the fire department. Instead, he said, the system was substandard
and residents, who claimed the building's fire alarm didn't sound,
were left scrambling to safety.
   ``It went up like this,'' said tenant Dwayne Rogers, 25,
striking a match and shaking his head while watching it burn.
``Just like that, the whole building.''
   Leo McDonnell, 46, whose life was saved when Rogers awoke him,
made it to safety by clambering to an adjacent roof.
   Others weren't so lucky.
   ``I saw one guy start out the window, and then the smoke blocked
the view,'' McDonnell said. ``And then when the smoke cleared, he
was gone. I don't know if he fell or went back in.''
   Survivors said the screams of their neighbors pierced the night.
   ``It wasn't screams of help,'' said Bobby Barrett, 19. ``It was
more like screams of burning.''
   The fire marshal and Lynn police disagreed on the number of
guests on the night of the blaze, but early reports put the number
at 37. By late in the day, officials said, five people were still
unaccounted for.
   Extensive structural damage raised safety concerns and hampered
Tuesday's investigation, said Galvin.
   Capt. John Decareau, head of Lynn's arson squad, said it was too
soon to determine the fire's cause.
   Conway said city law allows climbing ropes in lieu of external
fire escapes. But tenants and rescue workers claimed many of the
ropes didn't reach the ground, so they were either left dangling or
forced to jump to an adjacent building.
   ``We saw a couple of people that couldn't reach the roof, and
they got torched,'' said Rogers, who tried to wake other tenants
before escaping to an adjacent roof.
   Al DiVirgilio, mayor of this city of 80,000 on the seacoast five
miles north of Boston, said two criminal complaints were pending
against the rooming house's owner.
   One involved the owner's failure to install a sprinkler system
required under a 2-year-old city ordinance adopted after a 1984
rooming house fire that killed 15 people, the mayor said.
   Leo Allard, the Ben Crest's owner, has been battling the
ordinance in court and refused to comment Tuesday. Allard's
attorney, James E. Smith, said his client and other rooming house
owners were seeking reasonable time to install sprinkler systems.

   The president of the governing Liberal Democratic
Party, Toshiki Kaifu, today was declared prime minister after an
unprecedented parliamentary clash over who should have the job.
   Kaifu, 58, became Japan's third prime minister in 10 weeks after
sex and money scandals and a major loss in upper house elections
forced his two predecessors to step down.
   ``There are many difficulties awaiting the Liberal Democratic
Party, and I will try to work hard and express my frank feelings to
the people,'' Kaifu said after his selection by the lower house,
where his party has a comfortable majority.
   The less powerful upper house supported Socialist Party leader
Takako Doi.
   It was the first time in 41 years that the two houses had
clashed over who should head the government. Under the
constitution, if the houses cannot agree on a prime minister, the
lower house decision prevails.
   On Tuesday, Kaifu was elected president of the Liberal
Democratic Party, which lost public support after the disclosure
last year that the Recruit Co. conglomerate tried to buy political
favors from leading politicians.
   Kaifu has said he received about $110,000 in legal political
donations over five years from the Recruit Co.
   Two people he named today to top posts in the governing party
also have Recruit links. Ichiro Ozawa, the new party
secretary-general, and Shunjiro Karasawa, the new chairman of the
decision-making Executive Council, have acknowledged receiving
legal donations from the company.
   Hajime Tamura, speaker of the lower house, declared Kaifu prime
minister in a brief announcement.
   Ms. Doi said she was not discouraged.
   ``Today, the door was only half opened, but I am determined to
continue to work to fully open this door some day,'' she said.
``Aug. 9 surely reflects the beginning of the end of the long rule
by the LDP.''
   The general secretary of the Socialist Party, Tsuruo Yamaguchi,
said Ms. Doi's upper house victory ``proved we will be seeing a
very unstable political situation'' in coming months.
   ``For the first time in 41 years the wheels of history have
shifted,'' he told The Associated Press. ``Formally, the lower
house choice prevails, but politically the upper house vote has
proven that this administration is only half an administration, and
Kaifu is only half a prime minister.''
   Kaifu said the delay caused by the disagreement between the
houses was a ``severe consequence of our election defeat,'' a
reference to July 23 elections for half the seats in the upper
house.
   In that vote, the Liberal Democrats lost their majority in the
upper house for the first time in their 34-year history.
   Kaifu is succeeding Sousuke Uno, who resigned after the July
vote. He lasted only 69 days in office, losing support because of
reports he kept a paid mistress.
   Earlier today, Uno's Cabinet resigned en masse, clearing the way
for Kaifu to form a new government.
   Uno replaced Noboru Takeshita, who resigned because of the
Recruit scandal, which tainted most of the top figures in the
governing party.
   The tarnished reputations of top Liberal Democratic figures made
it possible for Kaifu to vault into the party leadership, even
though he has little personal clout as a member of a minor party
faction and has not served in top party or government offices.
   But Kaifu brings a more youthful image to Japan's highest office
and has credentials as a reformer. He was a member of the party's
reform committee and an aide to the late Prime Minister Takeo Miki
when Miki was trying to clean up Japanese politics in the 1970s.
   In addition to Ozawa and Karasawa, Kaifu today appointed Hiroshi
Mitsuzuka to be head of his party's Policy Affairs Research
Council. Mitsuzuka, the outgoing foreign minister, has said he did
not have any connections to the Recruit Co.
   Japanese newspapers gave mixed early notices to Kaifu's
election. The liberal-leaning Asahi Shimbun said it hopes ``he will
not stumble badly,'' and it called on Kaifu ``to work for genuine
changes in his own party.''
   The conservative Yomiuri Shimbun's editorial applauded the
debate that accompanied the election for party leader.
   ``After the Cabinet is formed, (Kaifu's) first task should be to
carry out political reform to regain public trust. The very fact
that Kaifu is not a faction leader demonstrates the acceptance of
the need for reform,'' Yomiuri said.

   The former top aide to PTL founder Jim
Bakker pleaded guilty to fraud and conspiracy and agreed to testify
against the evangelist. Bakker's attorney said the deal was suspect
because the aide had sold his soul.
   U.S. District Judge Robert Potter on Tuesday also refused to
delay Bakker's trial, turning down complaints from defense
attorneys' about pretrial publicity.
   ``Whether this case is tried in Charlotte, North Carolina, or
Ottumwa, Iowa, two years from now, there is going to be pretrial
publicity. It is one of the prices that we all must pay for a free
press,'' Potter said.
   Jury selection is scheduled to begin Aug. 21 with opening
arguments a week later.
   Richard Dortch, former executive vice president of PTL, pleaded
guilty to one count of mail fraud, one of wire fraud by telephone,
one of wire fraud by television and one of conspiracy, according to
one of his attorneys, Mark Calloway.
   ``Beyond that, we have no comment,'' Calloway said.
   A plea agreement calls for Dortch to cooperate with the U.S.
Attorney's office and the Justice Department in ``whatever form''
requested, including ``sworn testimony in court and documentary
materials.''
   ``Richard Dortch will become the key witness against Jim
Bakker,'' said Washington lawyer Ben Cotten, who represents
convicted former PTL aides David and James Taggart.
   ``Having pleaded to conspiracy _ with Jim Bakker being the
alleged co-conspirator _ it will be very difficult for Bakker to
convince the jury that at least on the charge of conspiracy he's
innocent,'' Cotten said.
   He also said the Taggarts would consider testifying against
Bakker.
   George T. Davis, Bakker's attorney, said he was not surprised by
the plea agreement and said Dortch's testimony has ``got to have
some effect.''
   ``These kind of deals are somewhat suspect from the very nature
of the animal because it is not uncommon for people to sell their
souls if necessary to save their bodies,'' Davis said.
   Under the agreement, Dortch could face a maximum sentence of 10
years in prison and a $500,000 fine. Prosecutors agreed to ask the
presiding judge at sentencing to dismiss the remaining 20 charges
against Dortch.
   The agreement also specifies that Dortch could be asked to make
restitution.
   Dortch had tried unsuccessfully to have his trial separated from
Bakker. The two men were charged in a 24-count indictment with
diverting more than $4 million in PTL money to their own benefit.
   A federal grand jury indicted them on eight counts each of mail
fraud, 15 counts of wire fraud, and conspiracy to commit mail and
wire fraud. Bakker could face 120 years in prison and more than $5
million in fines on the charges.
   The case stemmed from a 16-month investigation into the
televangelism empire under Bakker's leadership. The grand jury
heard from more than 100 witnesses, reviewed thousands of documents
and watched tapes of old ``PTL Club'' shows.
   Tuesday's agreement came on the heels of the July 25 tax evasion
convictions of the Taggarts.
   David Taggart, who was Bakker's personal aide, and James
Taggart, his former interior designer, are scheduled to be
sentenced on Aug. 25 by Judge Potter. They each face 25 years in
prison and more than $1 million in fines.

   The Iranian-backed Hezbollah said today
that efforts to free Western hostages in Lebanon suffered ``their
greatest setback'' as a result of Israel's abduction of a Shiite
Moslem cleric from south Lebanon.
   A statement released by the party's information center said the
July 28 kidnapping of Sheik Abdul Karim Obeid and two relatives was
a ``terrorist crime of piracy.''
   Israel has offered to trade Obeid and all Shiite prisoners it
holds for three Israeli servicemen and the 16 Western hostages held
in Lebanon.
   ``The Zionist enemy has suffered a bitter dismay because of his
failure to achieve his objectives from the crime of abducting Sheik
Obeid,'' Hezbollah said.
   ``It is clear that things have backfired adversely on the enemy
after this foolish crime. It has become impossible to release the
Israeli POWs and all ways for a possible swap have been blocked,''
it said.
   ``Moreover, the refusal of the enemy to release Sheik Obeid and
his two relatives, and his linkage of the problem of the Zionist
POWs with that of the hostages might hurt the West and further
complicate the hostage issue,'' the statement added.
   Hezbollah, Iran's main ally in Lebanon, is believed to be the
umbrella group for extremist factions holding most of the hostages.
   ``We contend that past efforts for the release of the Western
hostages in Lebanon is passing through the greatest setback because
of the foolhardiness committed by the racist Zionists, who appear
perfectly willing to sacrfice all others for their selfish
interests,'' the statement said.
   It repeated its urging that the West pressure Israel to free
Obeid.
   Israeli officials have said Obeid admitted under interrogation
that he took part in planning terrorist attacks, including the
abduction of U.S. Marine Lt. Col. William R. Higgins in south
Lebanon Feb. 17, 1988.
   Hezbollah said Israel is lying about the reported confessions.
   The Organization of the Oppressed on Earth, an extemist group
made up of pro-Iranian zealots, said July 31 that it had hanged
Higgins in retaliation for Israel's refusal to free Obeid.
   Higgins, 44, commanded a 76-man observer unit attached to the
U.N. Peacekeeping force in south Lebanon when he was kidnapped.
   There are eight Americans among the 16 hostages in Lebanon. The
hostage held longest is Terry Anderson, chief Middle East
correspondent for The Associated Press. He was kidnapped March 16,
1985.

   Anti-government rebels armed with
axes, machetes and clubs massacred 54 civilians near the southern
coastal town of Xai-Xai, the official news agency AIM said today.
   The report said most of the victims were kidnapped by guerrillas
of the Mozambique National Resistance in Gaza Province and marched
to Fidel Castro village, just outside Xai-Xai and 90 miles
northeast of Maputo, the capital.
   The civilians were hacked or beaten to death on Monday, AIM
said, quoting a report in Maputo's Noticias daily newspaper. The
report said the fatalities included 13 women and eight children and
that 17 people were injured.
   The attack occurred while rebel leaders and government
representatives were meeting in Kenya in a bid to settle this
country's 12-year-old civil war. Mozambican churchmen, acting on
behalf of their government, met with rebel representatives Tuesday,
but no major breakthroughs were reported.
   No explanation was provided of why the civilians were killed.
However, the rebels, who have been accused of many civilian
atrocities, sometimes take civilians prisoner to carry their
equipment and then kill them afterward.
   No government acknowledges supporting the guerrillas. South
Africa openly supported them until 1984, and some reports say it
continues to do so.
   However, South Africa says it is now abiding by a non-aggression
pact with neighboring Mozambique.
   President Joaquim Chissano says he accepts South Africa's word.
However, officials in Mozambique still believe the rebels receive
help from non-governmental groups in South Africa.
   The war has killed 600,000 people, created more than a million
refugees, and left nearly half the country's 14.7 million people
dependent on food aid.

   The aircraft carrier USS America was
reported today to have resumed patrol off the coast of Iran,
putting another powerful military force at President Bush's
disposal in the Lebanon hostage crisis.
   The nine-ship battle group was in Singapore, nearly 4,000 miles
away, when the crisis arose July 31 with the reported hanging of
U.S. Marine Lt. Col. William R. Higgins by his Lebanese Shiite
captors and a death threat against a second American hostage.
   The America cut short its port visit by four days to return to
its assigned duty station in the north Arabian Sea, a voyage
requiring nearly a week.
   U.S. officials refused, as a matter of policy, to discuss ship
movements, but Defense Secretary Dick Cheney told reporters in
Washington that the carrier was headed for the ``north end of the
Indian Ocean.''
   A convoy located in the Arabian Sea, or further south in the
Indian Ocean, could steam north through the Gulf of Oman and enter
the Persian Gulf.
   A Pentagon spokesman said on Tuesday that the America was
``conducting routine operations'' in the Indian Ocean but would not
say where. Other sources, speaking on condition of anonymity, said
it was resuming normal duties in the north Arabian Sea.
   The battle group was deployed in June to the Navy's Joint Task
Force Middle East, the only U.S. surface fleet operating within
striking distance of Iran. The force also includes 10 ships in the
Persian Gulf.
   The 79,000-ton America's port call at Singapore had been
scheduled well in advance, and a military source called it ``just
the breaks'' that the hostage crisis arose during its absence.
   U.S. warships in the gulf region have operated at reduced alert
status and spent more time in port since Iraq and Iran agreed last
year to a cease-fire in their eight-year war.
   Administration sources in Washington have been quoted as saying
Bush had opted for a military reprisal if any more hostages were
killed. They said he would probably use planes from the carrier USS
Coral Sea in the eastern Mediterranean to strike suspected
terrorist strongholds in Lebanon.
   However, the sources have not ruled out an attack on Iran, which
is considered to wield great influence over Shiite Moslem groups
holding Western hostages in Lebanon.
   In that event, the America and its more than 80 combat aircraft
would be the probable choice.
   Military analysts agreed that the most logical target for
military action against Iran would be its big oil terminal at Kharg
Island, 500 miles northwest of the Strait of Hormuz, the gulf
outlet to the Arabian Sea.
   For the U.S. planes, it would mean dodging the terminal's
anti-aircraft defenses that downed a number of Iraqi planes during
the war.
   The U.S. warships in the gulf are designed mainly for missile
war against aircraft, ships and submarines. Their 5-inch and 76-mm
guns would be hard put to inflict more than token damage on a
sprawling complex like Kharg Island.
   Military sources ruled out any use of the Coral Sea against
Iran, noting that its planes would have to make a 3,000-mile round
trip through the airspace of several countries.

<HEAD>Attorney General Announces Plans for International Unit</HEAD>

<DATELINE>HONOLULU (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   U.S. Attorney General Dick Thornburgh says he
wants to establish an international unit in the Justice Department
devoted mostly to curbing drug trafficking.
   ``Often more than 50 percent of my day is devoted to some matter
relating to our international involvement in fighting drug
trafficking, money laundering, international organized crime and
business fraud, environmental depredations, terrorism or
espionage,'' Thornburgh said in a speech Tuesday at the American
Bar Association convention.
   Outlining President Bush's $1 billion crime-fighting package,
Thornburgh said he would seek congressional approval for an
International Affairs Office. He said the State Department has
endorsed the idea.
   A spokesman for the attorney general's office said existing
money could be redirected to fund the unit.
   Thornburgh's proposal to have an office that reports directly to
him to coordinate Justice Department international law enforcement
efforts comes at a time in which the federal battle against drugs
is under great scrutiny.
   The president's drug policy coordinator, William Bennett, is
preparing a congressionally mandated battle plan. As part of the
effort U.S. attorneys around the nation recently issued a report
that placed heavy blame on international drug trafficking for the
30 percent increase in violent crime in the United States in the
past decade.
   Although violent crime is mainly the responsibility of state and
local authorities, ``the federal law enforcement cannot look the
other way while violence, often drug-related, ravages many of our
inner-city communities and subjects innocent citizens to the
cross-fire of turf wars between urban terrorist gangs,'' Thornburgh
said.
   Bush's crime package focused on increasing the penalties for the
criminal use of guns, ending plea bargaining in such cases, hiring
more investigators and prosecutors and doubling the space in
federal prisons, Thornburgh said.
   ``Such a comprehensive approach, if replicated at the state and
local level, can go a long way toward restoring much-needed
credibility to the deterrent capacity of our criminal justice
system,'' he said.
   Regarding drug use and trafficking in the United States,
Thornburgh said the only way to win the ``war on drugs'' was to
``re-establish the values that make a drug-dependent lifestyle an
inadmissible option in this great nation.''
   He praised the military's mandatory drug testing program, saying
it reduced the incidence of drug use from 27 percent in 1980 to 4.8
percent last year. Thornburgh urged more drug testing of American
workers.
   Speaking to reporters after the speech, Thornburgh said the U.S.
Supreme Court's validation of drug-testing meant private and
public-sector employers could begin ``reasonable'' drug-testing
progams.
   ``I think private employers should examine the appropriateness
of it in the workplace,'' he said.

<TEXT>
   Craig Spence, a flamboyant lobbyist who has
been a headline figure in the federal investigation of a Washington
call-boy ring, is facing cocaine and gun possession charges in New
York City, it was reported today.
   Spence, 48, was arrested July 31 along with a male prostitute at
a Manhattan hotel, The Washington Times and The Washington Post
reported.
   The Times said that in an eight-hour interview Monday, Spence
disclosed that he discovered ``about three years ago'' that he had
contracted AIDS and was threatening to commit suicide rather than
die of the disease.
   ``I had the world at my house,'' Spence said of parties where he
played host to some prominent Washingtonians, ``and now they don't
know who I am.''
   The Times said Spence revealed that his apartment had been
rigged with listening devices by ``friendly'' intelligence agents
he refused to name. He said he had destroyed audio tapes and
photographs by the time the Secret Service raided his apartment in
July, and all that was left was his anti-AIDS medication, AZT.
   New York police officer Lori Pollock told the Washington Post
that when she arrived at Spence's room in the Barbizon Hotel she
heard crashing.
   ``This guy Craig Spence comes running out of the room screaming
that the other guy has a gun,'' Ms. Pollock was quoted as saying.
``We got the gun and it wasn't loaded. We determined that it
belonged to Spence. There were drugs in the room also, cocaine and
a crack pipe.''
   Spence _ a dashing figure who represented Japanese clients at
the height of his lobbying activities _ was released on his own
recognizance several days later. He is scheduled for a court
appearance Aug. 28, the newspapers said.
   Police said the 22-year-old male prostitute with Spence was
charged with drug possession.
   Spence, a former television correspondent, was identified this
summer by the Times as a major client of a homosexual escort
service. The Secret Service, District of Columbia police and the
U.S. Attorney's Office are investigating that service for possible
credit card fraud, authorities said.
   Spence told the Times he never spent as much as $20,000 a month
for call boy services, as reflected by credit card receipts
obtained by the Times. He claimed charges were improperly inflated
by an escort service manager.
   Spence also has been linked to a White House guard who has said
he accepted an expensive watch from Spence and gave him a piece of
presidential china. The guard, Reginald deGueldre, also reportedly
allowed Spence and some friends to take midnight tours of White
House public areas last year.
   The Secret Service has said the tours were unauthorized, but not
a security breach.
   Spence said that at his work level, ``Reggie couldn't have
arranged anything,'' and acknowledged the exchange of gifts.

   International judges are working quietly to
resolve disputes between the United States and Iran over billions
of dollars of frozen assets, despite bitter differences between the
two nations.
   The members of the Iran-U.S. Claims Tribunal in The Hague,
Netherlands, have remained isolated from day-to-day politics. On
Tuesday, the State Department rejected a suggestion that American
hostages in Lebanon could be released if the United States agreed
to release frozen Iranian assets.
   The English-language Tehran Times quoted a source saying Iran
would intercede to gain the release of the American hostages if
Washington gave assurances it would release frozen Iranian assets.
   Eight American hostages are believed held by pro-Iranian Shiite
Moslems in Lebanon.
   ``The questions of the assets have no connection ... whatsoever
with the hostage issue,'' said State Department spokesman Richard
Boucher. ``This is a legal process. It's a very technical process.
And it's the business of the tribunal to work through the claims
and the cases before them and to work them out.''
   Boucher said the United States refused to consider tying the
hostages' fate to issues before the tribunal but is continuing its
``intensive diplomatic efforts'' to free the captives.
   However, The New York Times quoted an unidentified senior
administration official as saying there may be more room for
maneuvering.
   ``And while we would not give a direct quid pro quo, we would
offer some understanding or agreement that `if you use your good
offices to get the hostages,' we will look favorably on your desire
to get the assets,'' this official was quoted as saying.
   The tribunal, established in 1981 after Iran freed American
hostages held at the U.S. Embassy in Tehran for 444 days, has done
its work in a non-political environment.
   Since it was established, the tribunal _ composed of nine
international judges _ has resolved billions of dollars worth of
claims. Three judges are American, three are Iranian and three are
from other countries.
   The State Department said U.S. nationals have been awarded about
$1.2 billion, while Iranians have received about $118 million.
   The claims, made by banks, companies, individuals and
governments, stem from the 1979 breakdown in diplomatic relations
between the two nations.
   The United States froze billions of dollars of Iranian assets,
including hundreds of millions of dollars worth of military
equipment bought by Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi before his regime
was toppled. Iran also seized U.S. assets.
   When the tribunal was established, the United States transferred
about $9.9 billion in frozen assets to escrow accounts and to Iran.
Washington has little control over that money, the disposition of
which is regulated by tribunal rulings.
   But the Iranians have filed separate claims, amounting to
roughly $12 billion, for military equipment bought under the shah.
The State Department said it doesn't know how much the shah had
already paid, but he had committed to buying $20 billion worth of
hardware.
   Iran has generally followed the tribunal's decisions, making
payments to claimants when ordered to do so, American officials
said. Some American companies, however, have appealed the
tribunal's decisions in U.S. courts, effectively delaying payments,
they said.

   A Shiite Moslem clergyman on a suicide
mission today detonated a bomb-laden truck near an Israeli military
convoy and wounded five Israeli soldiers, Israel's army and the
pro-Iranian Hezbollah said.
   A Hezbollah leader said the attacker was a ``comrade'' of Sheid
Abdul Karim Obeid, a Shiite Moslem clergyman held by Israel. The
Hezbollah spokesman, Sheik Sobhi Tofaili, did not say if the attack
was in retaliation for the abduction.
   The pickup truck blew up in Israel's self-proclaimed security
zone in south Lebanon as a joint Israeli-South Lebanon Army convoy
was passing by.
   Israeli's army said five Israeli soldiers and one of the allied
Lebanese militiamen were wounded. One soldier suffered serious
injuries and the others suffered light or moderate injuries. Two
people in the truck were killed, the army said.
   Tofaili said there was only one attacker and identified him as
Sheik Asaad Birro, a Shiite clergyman.
   Hezbollah also released a statement saying, ``The Mujahid (holy
warrior) detonated the car he was driving as an enemy military
convoy drove past.''
   Israel radio said the blast left a crater six feet deep,
overturned an army vehicle and damaged nearby houses. The radio
said the pickup was carrying 550 pounds of explosives.
   Hezbollah, or Party of God, said the ``martyrdom operation'' was
carried out at the entrance to the Christian village of Qleiaa,
about two miles north of Israel's border, at 9:45 a.m.
   Hezbollah, believed to be the umbrella for factions holding most
of the 16 Western hostages in Lebanon, said in the statement that
the attack was carried out to ``declare our loyalty to the course
of Imam Khomeini and his successor Ayatollah Khamenei'' of Iran.
   Israel Army radio said Israeli soldiers and allied militiamen
put up roadblocks and were searching for suspects. It said a number
of Lebanese residents had been detained.
   In Beirut, Hezbollah released a second statement today saying
that efforts to free Western hostages in Lebanon suffered ``their
greatest setback'' as a result of Israel's abduction of Obeid on
July 28 from his home in south Lebanon.
   ``It is clear that things have backfired adversely on the enemy
after this foolish crime. It has become impossible to release the
Israeli POWs and all ways for a possible swap have been blocked,''
the statement said.
   Israel says Obeid, an ally of Iran, was involved in the
abduction of U.S. Marine Lt. Col. William R. Higgins near this
southern port on Feb. 17, 1988.
   Higgins' kidnappers, the Organization of the Oppressed on Earth,
said July 31 that Higgins was hanged in retaliation for Obeid's
abduction. Some reports have said he was killed months earlier, and
his body has yet to be recovered.
   The Revolutionary Justice Organization, another underground
pro-Iranian faction, offered Sunday to release U.S. hostage Joseph
Cicippio if Israel released Obeid and 450 Arab prisoners and
allowed 55 Palestinian deportees to return to the occupied West
Bank and Gaza Strip.
   Israel carved out the security zone in south Lebanon, a
6-to-10-mile-wide strip, after withdrawing most of its troops from
Lebanon in 1985.
   Israeli army officials said the casualties could have been
higher if the convoy had not been keeping large distances between
each vehicle in the convoy of Israeli soldiers and South Lebanon
Army forces.
   The injured were taken to hospitals in Israel by helicopter.
   Dr. Albert Sattinger, director of Rambam Hospital in Haifa, said
two soldiers suffered skull injuries and were undergoing
operations. A third suffered an eye injury from shrapnel.
   The last suicide car bomb attack was Oct. 19, 1988, when eight
Israeli soldiers were killed and seven wounded 300 yards from the
border. Shiite Moslem radicals in Beirut also claimed
responsibility for that explosion.
   In March 1985, a car bomb attacker drove into a convoy of
Israeli vehicles, killing 12 Israelis and wounding 14. The attack
was claimed by the pro-Syrian Lebanese Syrian Socialist Nationalist
Party.
   Prior to today's attack, the army said there were 43 car bomb
attacks and attempts along the border since October 1982.

   Police discovered a playground stand where
children operated a make-believe drug ring offering bags of grass
clippings and sugar.
   ``We just lost the war on drugs,'' said Capt. Bernie Reilly. ``I
don't care what (President) Bush says, this is bad.''
   Police discovered the stand last week and said children had
recorded pretend drug transactions on a ledger and on scraps of
colored notepaper.
   One note read ``Cocaine, small half-baggie, 55 cents, small
baggies, $1,'' The Patriot newspaper of Harrisburg reported today.
   ``What you have to understand is I have no doubt (they) are
copying their parents. They want to make a lot of money and not
work,'' said Detective Robert Bowman Jr.
   Detective Thomas Capello said one of the worst days of his 11
years of police work came when a city resident handed him a
fishing-tackle box containing the fake drugs, the ledger and a
crudely written IOU.
   The resident said the box came from a 7-year-old boy and a
9-year-old girl at the playground.
   ``It's a shame the kids can't use this kind of intelligence to
better themselves,'' said Police Chief Michael J. DeLeo. ``These
kids were intelligent to set something up like this.''

   A community activist who battled drug dealers in
her neighborhood was killed when her home was sprayed with gunfire
a week after a note warning her to ``back off'' reportedly was
slipped under her door.
   Maria Hernandez, 34, of Brooklyn, was dressing for her job at a
nursing home Tuesday when at least five shots shattered front
windows, police said. She was hit once in the head.
   Her husband, Carlos Hernandez, 33, and 3-year-old son were
unhurt, said Brooklyn Chief of Detectives Francis X. Smith. The
woman's husband said he threw his body on their sleeping son at the
first shot.
   The chief said the victim and her husband were community and
anti-drug activists who ``made a lot of enemies on the block.''
   ``She tried to clean up the drug dealers,'' said a neighbor who
would not give her name.
   A note slipped under the family's door said in Spanish, ``If you
don't back off, you'll be killed,'' Hernandez said.
   A neighbor was charged last week with slashing the victim's
husband several times, allegedly because authorities took away the
neighbor's children after the Hernandezes complained of abuse,
Smith said.
   ``There's a lot of bitterness there, although we don't know if
it's connected to the shooting,'' the chief added.
   Police said they had no suspects.

   A Romanian woman who was nine months
pregnant fled her native country by floating across the Danube in
an inner tube and then hiked six miles before giving birth in a
hospital, a Belgrade weekly reported.
   Camelia Popescu Sorina, a 30-year-old teacher from Turn Severin,
a town near the border, made the escape alone, Ilustrovana Politika
said in its edition published Tuesday. Her husband escaped
separately to Austria, the report said.
   Mrs. Sorina reportedly took a taxi to a town near the border,
telling the driver she was visiting relatives. At about 2:00 a.m.
she inflated the inner tube, secured her documents and some food on
her arm, and started across the river, the magazine said.
   According to the report, she reached the Yugoslav side of the
river after about an hour and waited until morning before
continuing her journey.
   After hiking six miles, Mrs. Sorina reached the town of Kladovo
and boarded a bus for Belgrade.
   The woman went into labor during the ride and gave birth to a
girl in a hospital in the town of Negotin, 65 miles south of
Kladovo, Ilustrovana Politika said.
   Mrs. Sorina's husband, Alexander, was reportedly in a refugee
camp in Austria.
   He and a friend also had tried to escape by swimming the Danube,
but Romanian soldiers shot his friend to death, the magazine said.
It said Sorina then escaped from jail and fled via Hungary to
Austria.
   The magazine said the couple wants to either go to Canada or
settle in Austria.
   According to official statistics, 3,500 Romanians have escaped
to Yugoslavia this year.

<TEXT>
   President Bush is saying ``the right words''
but must ``turn on the music and dance'' by pushing policies that
will help black Americans reach economic equality, civil rights
leader Joseph E. Lowery said today.
   ``We have already seen a friendlier White House, a gentler White
House, but now we must activate the kind of budget, the kind of job
training opportunities, the kind of rectifying of the past few
years of neglect ... to move from righteous ceremony to righteous
sacrament,'' the president of the Southern Christian Leadership
Conference told the National Urban League.
   Bush addressed the league's annual conference on Tuesday, saying
that his administration ``will not tolerate discrimination, bigotry
or bias of any kind _ period.''
   ``We have heard Mr. Bush say the right words; now he must turn
on the music and dance with me...,'' Lowery said. ``Dance to the
harmonious melodies of full employment, adequate wages, dance to
the rhythm of affordable and available health care for all of the
citizens of this country.''
   Lowery also called for action from Congress, which he said ``has
yet to demonstrate the advantage of the Democratic majority that we
helped bring into being, particularly in the Senate.''
   ``What difference does it make whether it's a Democratic
majority or Republican majority if they can't override a veto to
keep the minimum wage'' at its present level, Lowery asked. Bush
recently vetoed legislation to raise the minimum, and the veto was
sustained in Congress.
   Urban League President John E. Jacob said following Bush's
address Tuesday, ``I am willing to concede that the first six to
eight months is the rhetoric period'' in judging a new
administration.
   ``We will use the next 12 months to determine how well he does
in carrying that out. His rhetoric is right. He is saying the right
things. Now we have to find out whether he is willing to do the
right things,'' Jacob said.
   Bush, the first president to address an Urban League conference
since President Carter in 1979, received generous applause Tuesday.
   But Joan N. Tokley, president of the Tampa, Fla., Urban League,
said, ``I would have felt a lot more comfortable if the president
had addressed the recent rulings of the Supreme Court, especially
those that deal with affirmative action.''
   Recent decisions of the court have held that state and local
governments generally may not impose racial quotas for public works
hiring, that minorities must meet higher statistical standards to
prove they are being relegated to less desirable jobs, and that
white workers not involved in an 8-year-old affirmative action
ruling were nevertheless entitled to attack it in court.
   ``No matter what he says his moral and philosophical conviction
is ... at this point I haven't heard him say anything about the
laws in this country that were designed to protect blacks, women
and other minorities,'' Ms. Tokley said. ``And until he does, I
will not be convinced that he actually means what he says.''
   Harold Hood, a Michigan Court of Appeals judge attending the
conference, said Bush's address ``was a very neutral talk as far as
minorities were concerned.''
   ``I don't know that I expect him to be on our side,'' Hood said.
``I'd be happy if he isn't against us. And at least I didn't get
the sense that he's against us, and that's a plus.''
   Bush told the delegates the gulf between white and black America
has narrowed, but has not been closed.
   ``Closing that gulf _ eliminating it for all time _ is the next
chapter we must write in the unfolding history, the unfinished
history, of civil rights,'' Bush said.
   He conceded that he and civil rights leaders have disagreed
about how to accomplish that.
   ``We've argued _ society's argued _ about affirmative action,
about quotas, goals and timetables, about set-asides,'' he said.
   But the most important point, the president said, is that
``bigotry and bias may take more subtle forms (than in the past)
but they persist _ and as long as they do, our work is not over.''

<TEXT>
   The San Francisco organizer of underground
tests of an experimental AIDS drug says he will accept a government
invitation to discuss bringing the trials into the open.
   Martin Delaney, co-director of the AIDS education group Project
Inform, said Tuesday that he found the Food and Drug
Administration's offer to discuss sanctioning the trials a positive
development.
   ``We have said from the beginning we would like to do this in
the open,'' Delaney said.
   The clandestine trial began in April when the drug began to be
viewed by AIDS patients as a last hope. Delaney said he and others
started the unauthorized testing to find out whether it worked
before its uncontrolled use became widespread. Going through the
FDA would have taken too long, he said, but he also has said that
he and others kept the FDA apprised of the study.
   The FDA began investigating the underground trials of Compound Q
in June after a patient died and two others had adverse reactions.
Delaney said it was unclear whether Compound Q was related to the
death.
   Compound Q is a protein from the root of a cucumber-like plant
that has been used for centuries in China to induce abortions and
treat certain tumors. Delaney's group smuggled the drug into the
country with the help of couriers.
   The FDA told Delaney in a letter he received Tuesday to stop the
trials, but offered to talk about conforming them to FDA
regulations.
   ``While we cannot condone the unapproved administration of
trichosanthin (Compound Q), we share your belief that important
drug evaluation information may be generated by community-based
organizations,'' said the letter, signed by Carl C. Peck, director
of the FDA's Center for Drug Evaluation and Research.
   ``We therefore want to meet with you, and with other concerned
parties, just as soon as possible, to discuss the possibility of
your participation in a community-based trial ... that complies
with existing law and regulations,'' the letter said.
   The FDA has come to rely increasingly on community-based trials,
a concept pioneered by AIDS activists in which local physicians
administer experimental therapies to AIDS patients and keep
detailed records as part of a safety and efficacy study.
   The underground study of 42 patients is nearly completed.
Treatments with the drug have finished and analysis of the data is
expected to be completed within the month, Delaney said.
   ``We will have enough data to make a reliable judgment to know
whether this is a big deal'' and worth further testing, he said.
   ``After that everybody at FDA is going to have to scratch their
heads and ask why it takes 3{ years under normal (FDA-approved)
circumstances'' to make the same determination.
   If the drug is worth testing further, Delaney said he and others
would bring the data to Washington and talk to FDA officials about
opening FDA-sanctioned, community-based clinical trials.
   The only approved clinical trial of the drug for AIDS patients
is being conducted at San Francisco General Hospital. A highly
purified form of trichosanthin developed at the University of
California at San Francisco and Genelabs Inc. of Redwood City,
Calif. is being used in that trial.
   The FDA says its procedure for approving drugs, including
several levels of clinical trials, is designed to determine
reliably the safety and effectiveness of a drug as well as to
protect those who volunteer to participate.

<TEXT>
   An obituary on a living person does not
harm the individual's reputation and thus is not libelous, New
Jersey's Supreme Court says.
   ``Death is a natural state and demeans no one,'' the court said
Tuesday in a 6-0 decision affirming lower court rulings against a
family that sued the Princeton Packet for printing the obituary in
1985 of a woman who had not died.
   One year after publication of the obituary of Marcy Decker, the
woman, her son and her mother sued for defamation and emotional
distress.
   The former Princeton resident said the distress contributed to
the loss of her job and aided her ex-husband's battle to gain
custody of the couple's child.
   The bi-weekly newspaper had said that it received the
information from an unsigned press release.
   The employee who normally handled obituaries testified she would
have called the family to verify an unsigned obituary, but that she
was on vaction and other people in the office did not know the
procedure.

<HEAD>Eds: Leads with 7 grafs to CORRECT breakdown of people on plane,

<DATELINE>ADDIS ABABA, Ethiopia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Rescuers extended their search
today across the border into Sudan in the hopes of finding Texas
Rep. Mickey Leland and 13 others who disappeared two days ago while
flying to a refugee camp in southwestern Ethiopia.
   Ethiopian authorities reported today that a plane had been heard
flying Monday near Mizan Teferi, 50 miles south of the Fugnido
refugee camp, where Leland and his entourage were headed.
   The twin-engine plane carrying Leland, 44, and the others
vanished during bad weather near Ethiopian-Sudanese border, 480
miles southwest of Addis Ababa.
   Leland, a Democratic from Houston and the chairman of the House
Select Committee on Hunger, was in Ethiopia on a return visit
because of his keen interest in Africa's refugee problem.
   The Twin Otter, a plane commonly used for bush flying in Africa,
also carried three members of Leland's staff, a friend of the
politician, four Americans from the U.S. Embassy and from the U.S.
Agency for International Development, and five Ethiopians _ three
government officials, the pilot and co-pilot.
   Up to 10 small planes were being used in the search today,
directed by Ethiopia's Civil Aviation Authority.
   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said an Air Force medical
evacuation plane left Germany this morning en route to Addis Ababa
in case it was needed.
   The weather today was markedly better than Tuesday, when heavy
clouds and poor visibility hampered planes coursing the cold
plateau in Ethiopia, said John Guerra, political officer at the
U.S. Embassy in Addis Ababa.
   Rescuers continue to focus on a region called Dembidola, about
75 miles north of Fugnido where Ethiopian authorities said a small
plane reportedly was heard circling Monday, according to U.S.
Embassy officials. The Dembidola region borders Mizan Teferi.
   Earlier, embassy officials said they were told the plane
actually had been sighted near Dembidola, but today acknowledged
they had been misinformed.
   Dembidola is in an accessible region of foothills between
mountains that rise up to 12,000 feet and swampy plateaus
stretching to the Sudanese border. Communications with Dembidolo
and Mizan Teferi, as with most areas outside the capital, are bad
to nonexistent.
   U.S. Embassy spokesman James Haley said the search had been
extended slightly across the Sudanese border on the theory Leland's
plane had the fuel capacity to go that far and may have crossed the
border to avoid bad weather.
   On Tuesday, Robert Houdek, charge d'affairs at the U.S. Embassy
in Addis Ababa, said the lack of radio or telecommunications
``could provide a benign explanation for why we haven't heard
anything.''
   Police, security officials and local peasants' associations have
been enlisted in ground searches along the flight path, said Houdek.
   Haley said a U.S. Air Force C-141 medical evacuation aircraft
was expected to arrive later today from West Germany for assistance.
   President Bush telephoned Leland's wife, Alison, in Houston on
Tuesday and promised his administration will do ``all we can to
learn'' the fate of the plane.
   ``She's strong, has a lot of hope, and we all pray that he's
safe,'' Bush told a meeting of the National Urban League in
Washington, where delegates observed a moment of silent prayer for
Leland's survival.
   ``I think it says a lot about Mickey that he was on his sixth
humanitarian mission to help feed the hungry in that part of the
world,'' Bush said.
   Leland's Twin Otter left Addis Ababa in poor visibility at about
10:30 a.m. Monday after a two-hour delay caused by the bad weather,
said embassy officer Guerra.
   The plane was last heard from 15 minutes after it took off.
   The Americans on board included Patrice Johnson, Leland's chief
of staff; Hugh Johnson of the Hunger committee staff; and Joyce F.
Williams of the staff of Rep. Ron Dellums, D-Calif., according to
Leland's office in Washington.
   Fugnido camp is run by the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees
and is one of four in the region that house more than 300,000
refugees who have fled civil war in neighboring Sudan.

   Here are excerpts from recent editorials in newspapers
throughout the country:
   Aug. 2
   San Antonio Light on terrorism:
   No matter what option President George Bush selects to respond
to the new terroristic activities in the Middle East, that option
must not involve negotiation with the terrorists, under any
circumstances. ...
   Bush began weighing his options after the reported hanging of
Marine Lt. Col. William Higgins, a member of the United Nations
peacekeeping force, by his Lebanese kidnappers, even as the
terrorists threatened other murders.
   Our president made an urgent call for all parties holding
hostages in the Middle East to release them immediately, ``to begin
to reverse the cycle of violence in that region.'' ...
   In Bush's policy crisis over the new terroristic activities, he
confronts the same problems his two presidential predecessors
encountered in relation to Middle East atrocities: An enemy in
large part unseen, splintered into many religious factions with
many different names, embracing a culture in which these splinter
groups play by rules with which we are not familiar. ...
   It would be easy to invoke a knee-jerk reaction of an eye for an
eye in relation to the activities of terrorists, but that kind of
retaliation is not effective against such a mysterious enemy. A
diffused target is difficult to hit.
   Because each situation of Middle East terrorism is unique, it is
difficult for this nation to establish one national policy to cover
all.
   The no-negotiation policy, however, must be retained.

   North Jersey Herald and News, Passaic, N.J., on terrorism:
   It's time to admit it: The West just doesn't have a handle on
how to deal with savage Mideast terrorists.
   Threats against the American hostages in the Middle East make it
important to recognize a few basic facts:
   _ Anger over the execution should be directed straight at the
pro-Iranian group that says it acted in retaliation for an Israeli
commando raid and capture of Sheik Abdul Karim Obeid.
   _ The Bush Administration must consider a more active military
role in protecting Americans who are held hostage.
   _ An international effort must be made to pressure Mideast
governments into discouraging terrorist acts.
   A decade of watching in horror and lame condemnations has not
made the world a safer place. Honorable world leaders must now
stand together _ boldly _ to hold terrorists accountable for their
grisly deeds.

   The Commercial Review, Portland, Ind., on terrorism:
   If George Bush isn't careful, he's going to fall into the same
trap which ensnared Jimmy Carter and Ronald Reagan. ...
   The president has come dangerously close to becoming a hostage
to the hostage situation in the Middle East.
   That's what happened to Jimmy Carter, distorting his presidency
and sending him packing for Georgia. And that's what happened to
Ronald Reagan in his second term, resulting in the legal abuses and
policy disasters of the Iran-Contra affair.
   It could happen again. ... Unless President Bush and his
advisers handle the situation adroitly, they could find themselves
doing nothing more than reacting to an agenda set by a group of
terrorists in Beirut. ...
   What the president must do, instead, is make clear American
outrage over the murder of Lt. Col. William R. Higgins and the
death threats made against other hostages, make clear that the
United States will not deal with barbarians and criminals, and keep
his mouth shut about when or where or in what form retribution will
come. ...
   A patient, steady course is the right one, a course determined
by American interests and a firm resolve to see justice done.
   The alternative is to let a band of criminals in Lebanon
indirectly seize control of this country's foreign policy.

   Los Angeles Times on the hostage swap negotiations:
   What initially had been proferred as a more or less
straightforward swap of a radical Lebanese Shiite cleric abducted
by Israel ... for three of its captured servicemen is ... showing
signs of evolving into a multidimensional international bargaining
session of great complexity and perhaps long duration.
   As Richard W. Murphy, formerly one of the State Department's top
Middle East experts so aptly put it over the weekend, ``the bazaar
is open,'' and the offers, counteroffers, threats and ultimatums
are starting to be heard from all sides. ...
   It could be encouraging if it means that Iran and Syria are
finally ready to use their influence _ which means apply pressure _
on Hezbollah, the radical Shiite group that holds the Western
hostages.
   At the same time, the direct involvment of outside forces, each
with its own priorities, promises to complicate any confidential
negotiations aimed at pulling off a prisoner swap. ...
   Complicating things still further are the family ties that
account for at least some of the hostage-taking in Lebanon. Many of
the 17 Shiites jailed in Kuwait for attacks on the U.S. and French
embassies, for example, are related to a single Lebanese
hostage-taking clan, whose one demand from the beginning has been
for their release. ...
   If indeed, behind-the-scenes efforts are under way to construct
a grand exchange, a lot of countries and a lot of parties will have
to be involved. It's going to be a hard and probably lengthy
business, and given the disparate interests involved, the outcome
can by no means be taken for granted.

   The Daily Republic, Mitchell, S.D., on the mandatory retirement
of pilots:
   United Flight 232 Captain Al Haynes did a great job of bringing
home an uncontrollable plane. Although he claims he's no hero, his
years of experience resulted in the salvation of 185 lives.
   However, in two years, Haynes will be forced to end his career,
following 35 years of service. A 29-year-old nonsensical Federal
Aviation Administration rule requires 60-year-old pilots to hand
over their licenses. ...
   Behind this mandate is a concern that pilots over 60 may be a
health risk, with increased chances for a heart attack or stroke.
   We, however, agree with Donald Engen, former administrator of
the FAA, when he said, ``When push comes to shove, when everything
turns to worms, experience is what really counts.''

   Topeka (Kan.) Capital-Journal on disaster aid:
   Thanks To Sen. Bob Dole, farmers hurting from the drought _ or
in some areas, floods _ finally will get relief.
   Dole's compromise on the disaster-aid bill ... made the measure
acceptable to both Democrats and President Bush. That is no small
feat.
   To satisfy administration concerns, Dole keyed payments to
participation in crop insurance programs. The plan is more generous
in payments to farmers who buy protection.
   Perhaps Dole will spark a new trend toward compromise with his
example on the disaster-aid bill. It would be a refreshing change.

   Grants Pass (Ore.) Daily Courier on the federal drug war:
   If there were any drug lords quaking over federal officials'
declared war on drugs, the news of the past week should have calmed
their fears. ...
   The Senate voted ... to throw the drug soldiers a $1.7 billion
bone, snipping that meager amount off the huge $295 billions
defense budget. ...
   Meanwhile, ... drug czar William J. Bennett's ... draft of a
national strategy to fight drugs, the final version of which is due
Sept. 5, is vague and gives little attention to dangerous drugs
such as methamphetamine, according to administration officials who
have seen it. ...
   It calls for an all-out war on marijuana. Marijuana ... hardly
packs the punch or attracts the gun-toting people meth and heroin
do. ...
   Bennett's tentative plans, according to officials, ... call for
taking away educational and highway funds if states don't teach the
anti-drug classes or yank the licenses of drivers convicted of drug
offenses.
   Let's hope Bennett's strategy turns into a comprehensive plan
that provides help, not just threats, for the states.

   There cannot be a letup in the all-out fight against illegal

   The Portsmouth (N.H.) Herald on oil spill prevention and
legislation:
   The Exxon Valdez is safely berthed in San Diego for the next
nine months, but the oil issue itself will be with us for much
longer than that.
   The Senate, for example, is nearing approval of a bill to
greatly increase the oil industry's liability for spills and to
establish a $1 billion cleanup fund and disaster response teams
along the nation's coast. More legislation, more studies and more
attention can be expected.
   An internal Coast Guard study, recently released by the House
subcommittee on water, power and offshore energy, once again raises
the issue of double hulling for tankers.
   The study criticizes the single-bottom structure of the Exxon
Valdez. Double bottoms, the study maintains, ``are effective in
reducing the potential oil outflow from grounding.''
   Tanker transportation may indeed require different safety
precautions depending on the nature of the cargo and the sea to be
sailed. Not debatable is the need for enforceable precautions. They
should be a matter of law.
   The oil industry, the Coast Guard and Congress must work to
agree on safety measures to protect the nation's waterways. Delay
merely courts disaster.

   The Register-Herald, Beckley, W.Va., on protecting the ozone
layer:
   In the 1987 Montreal Protocol, 38 countries meeting in Canada
agreed to tackle the problem of chlorofluorocarbons, or CFCs. Those
are gases blamed for destroying the planet's protective ozone
layer. Some positive responses are coming in.
   Nissan Motor Co. is the first of Japan's major automakers to
begin cutting back on CFCs. Nissan announced ... that it will
totally ban CFC use by 1993.
   In the United States, American Telephone &amp; Telegraph Co. says it
intends to eliminate all CFC emissions from its factories by 1994.
AT&amp;T becomes the first American electronics manufacturer to set
such a goal. Part of that effort is to cut emissions in half by
1991. The company already has a policy of not accepting any
CFC-made packaging from suppliers.
   While these two instances may not seem sufficient _ given the
massive use of CFCs worldwide in manufacturing _ they are
significant in that they come from firms regarded as worldwide
heavyweights. AT&amp;T and Nissan set admirable standards in their
approach to cutting emissions.
   Here's hoping the rest of the world follows their lead.

   Vicksburg (Miss.) Evening Post on capital gains taxes:
   They laughed when George Bush campaigned last year in favor of
lowering capital gains taxes. Democrats claimed it was just a way
to feather the nests of the wealthy, and since they control both
houses of Congress, that was supposedly it.
   But lo and behold, a majority of the key House Ways and Means
Committee lined up the other day in favor of a bill to reduce the
tax people owe on the gains they make on the sale of stocks and
other assets. Such capital gains are now taxed the same as ordinary
income, at rates of 15 percent, 28 percent or 33 percent, depending
on total income.
   President Bush has proposed a top capital gains rate of 15
percent. He may not get that. Rep. Ed Jenkins, D-Ga., has
introduced a bill that would have a maximum 20 percent rate for two
years, and then a 28 percent rate.
   A bare majority of the committee, 13 Republicans and six
Democrats, support the Jenkins measure. Both proposals would lower
taxes for about 7.9 million couples or individuals.
   Democratic leaders are accusing President Bush of trying to
dismantle the 1986 Tax Reform Law. This measure changed the
favorable treatment of capital gains to make them conform with
ordinary income.
   But the administration offers compelling arguments that giving
taxpayers a break on such gains will boost the economy. It would
encourage savings and reduce costs of investment for U.S business.
It also would afford a hefty boost in revenues next year as
investors moved to realize capital gains on assets that otherwise
would remain untaxed. This would help ease the still-troubling
deficit problems. ...
   Such factors, plus the definite boost to the economy, offer
persuasive evidence on the need for more favorable treatment of
capital gains.

   Las Cruces (N.M.) Sun-News on savings by Americans:
   Americans don't save enough, and that poses a serious and
long-range problem. This fall the Bush administration plans to
begin a campaign to urge all of us to salt away more of our
earnings.
   In 1987 the personal savings rate sank to a 40-year low of 3.2
percent. Last year saw only slight improvement.
   We predict an upturn in the savings rate regardless of the
degree of success of the administration's urging. The Baby Boom
generation is now moving into middle age. Middle age is the peak
period for saving. Earnings are at a peak at the same time the need
for saving grows increasingly apparent.
   Taking the long view, savings must be encouraged. If they are
not, America will almost surely see its standing among the leading
industrial nations further eroded. Savings means investment,
investment means new businesses, and new businesses mean new jobs.
   But it's going to take some doing. It won't be easy to change
Americans from big spenders to frugal penny-pinchers who have
relearned the adage: ``A penny saved is a penny earned.''

   A Jewish settler mistook soldiers in the
occupied West Bank for Palestinians about to attack and fired on
the troops, provoking return fire that killed his infant son, the
army and hospital officials said today.
   Also today, a 6-year-old Palestinian was reported killed when
troops opened fire during disturbances at a Gaza Strip refugee
camp, hospital officials said.
   Businesses in the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip were closed
today as Palestinians held a general strike to mark the end of the
20th month of their uprising against Israeli rule.
   The infant, Itai Hamtzani, 19 months, was shot in the head and
died at Tel Hashomer Hospital in Tel Aviv, hospital officials said.
   The army said the soldiers opened fire when the father, Daniel
Hamtzani, 30, stopped his car Tuesday night and shot into a grove
of trees at an army patrol.
   The father was shot in the chest and slightly wounded, and a
second son, Ordan, 4, was slightly wounded, the army said.
   Yousef Ghazi Salameh, 6, was fatally shot in the chest by
soldiers firing from a rooftop during clashes in the Shati refugee
camp, according to an official at Shifa Hospital in Gaza City.
   The army said it was checking the report.
   Since the uprising began in December 1987, 531 Palestinians have
been killed in clashes with soldiers or other Israelis.
Thirty-eight Israelis have been slain.
   Also today, three Palestinian youths were shot and wounded in
clashes with soldiers, two in the Gaza Strip and the third near
Hebron in the West Bank, hospital officials said.
   A military spokesman said the army was checking the reports.
   Graffiti was sprayed across walls in the occupied lands calling
for the intefadeh, or uprising, to continue.
   ``Children of the intefadeh _ their faces are furious, their
games are stones,'' said one slogan signed by the uprising's
PLO-backed Unified Leadership in Gaza City.
   The incident involving the Jewish settler occurred while
Hamtzani was traveling to his home in the settlement of Ariel, an
army announcement said.
   Israel Radio said Hamtzani noticed a light in a grove of trees
and mistook the soldiers for Palestinians lighting a firebomb to
throw at his car.
   Hamtzani backed up and fired into the trees, the radio said. It
noted that news reports earlier Tuesday had reported a firebombing
nearby.
   About 70,000 Jewish settlers live among 1.7 million Palestinians
in the West Bank and Gaza Strip. The settlers have complained
bitterly that the army has failed to protect them from stone and
firebomb attacks during the uprising, and many carry arms.
   Also today, soldiers tore down two houses in Gaza Strip refugee
camps that belonged to men who admitted killing four Arabs
suspected of collaborating with Israeli authorities, the army said.
   The army identified the men as Tewfik Abdallah Abu Naim of the
Nusseirat refugee camp and Hassan Ahmed El-Makdama of the Bureij
camp.
   The army has destroyed more than 200 houses of Palestinians and
sealed about 100 others during the uprising.

<HEAD>Non-Estonians Walk Off Jobs to Protest Residency Law</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Non-Estonian factory and transit workers went on
strike today in the Estonian capital to protest a new law adopted
with nationalist support to tighten residency requirements for
elections.
   ``The strike is against yesterday's decision, which the workers
consider discriminatory,'' said Yevgeny Kogan, an ethnic Russian
and leader of Inter-movement. The group is championing the
interests of Russians and other non-Estonians in this small Baltic
republic.
   The law passed Tuesday by the republic's Supreme Soviet, or
parliament, requires residents to live in their district for two
years or anywhere in Estonia for five years before they are allowed
to vote. Candidates for elective office must live in the same place
for five years or in Estonia for 10 years.
   The official Soviet news agency, Tass, said workers in Tallinn
were not unloading freight trains or airplanes and that some auto
transport workers also were on strike. Air freight was paralyzed,
it said.
   Kogan, speaking in a telephone interview from Tallinn, said the
Elamo construction enterprise, the Dvigatel motor works, and the
Kalinin electronics plant were on strike.
   He said workers had struck at least 17 sites, but he could not
give a figure for how many people had walked off their jobs. Tass
said workers at 19 sites were on strike.
   Ethnic Estonians make up slightly more than 60 percent of the
population and pushed the law to protect themselves from an influx
of other nationalities.
   But Russians, who make up about a third of Estonia's 1.6 million
people, charge that the law discriminates against non-Estonians
because they tend to be more recent arrivals.
   ``The law guarantees general voting rights to practically all
citizens of Estonian nationality and deprives tens of thousands of
people of other nationalities,'' the government daily Izvestia
quoted a deputy identified as A. Lukoshkin telling the Estonian
Supreme Soviet on Tuesday.
   Non-Estonian workers conducted a warning strike in late July but
ended it when the government agreed to form a commission to look
into their complaints.
   Now, Tass said, the strikers want the Kremlin to set up a
commission to look broadly into Estonia's drive for greater local
control.
   Estonia has adopted a series of measures to increase its local
autonomy and protect ethnic Estonians. The republic has won
approval from Moscow to launch a new economic policy that Estonian
leaders say will even allow the republic to issue its own currency.

   A bomb hidden in a plastic lunch box
exploded today on a New Delhi-bound bus, killing at least 12 people
and injuring 35, police said.
   The United News of India and reporters at the scene said at
least 15 people were killed. UNI said the explosion blew off the

   There were no immediate claims of responsibility for the
bombing, which occurred in Haryana state near Karnal.
   A Chandigarh police spokesman, Inspector Inder Mohan, said the
dead included two children. Sixteen of the injured were in serious
condition, he said.
   The bomb exploded about 1 p.m. while the bus was passing the
Karna Lake tourist resort outside Karnal, 75 miles north of New
Delhi, Mohan said.
   Karnal is midway between New Delhi and Chandigarh, capital of
both Haryana and Punjab states.
   The bus, operated by state-run Haryana Roadways, started its
journey at the resort hill town of Kasauli in Himachal Pradesh
state and stopped at Ambala, on the Punjab-Haryana border.
   It was not immediately known how many people were on the bus,
which normally carries at least 60 passengers.
   In June 1988, Sikh extremists planted a bomb that killed 18
people at a market in the Haryana town of Kurukshetra.
   Sikh militants have waged a deadly campaign since 1982 for a
separate state in Punjab and periodically launch attacks in
neighboring states and New Delhi.
   At least 1,116 people have been killed by Sikh radicals in
Punjab so far this year, according to police reports.
   Sikh gunmen killed six people Tuesday night in Jammu, summer
capital of Jammu-Kashmir state.
   Jammu-Kashmir state, like Himachal Pradesh and Haryana, borders
Punjab.
   Sikhs, who make up 2 percent of India's 880 million people but
have a slight majority in Punjab, say they have been discriminated
against by the nation's 82 percent Hindu majority.

<HEAD>Family Bought Freezer Before Shooting Daughter</HEAD>

   A father and daughter accused of trying
to kill a younger, 360-pound daughter to put an end to the woman's
medical bills bought a freezer to hold the body one day before the
shooting, police say.
   Valentine Kwiatkowski, 78, and his daughter Carol are charged
with assault with intent to murder, accused of twice shooting
32-year-old Anna Kwiatkowski in the head Sunday. The woman was
listed in serious condition today.
   The two suspects have told people ``they were going to put Anna
in the freezer,'' said police Sgt. Jerry Wright.
   An unidentified appliance salesman told today's Detroit News
that the two suspects bought a freezer Saturday.
   ``They came in here bopping around, and it was funny how fast
they bought it,'' the salesman said. ``I asked him if he was a
hunter. But he said he needed it because he wanted to store some
extra meat.''
   The Kwiatkowskis gave police a receipt for a 16-cubic-foot
freezer chest to be delivered this week, authorities said.
   Wright said the purchase casts doubt on the father and
daughter's reported claim to hospital staff that they planned
suicide after shooting the woman.
   Authorities said the two, who were jailed on $50,000 bail, took
Ms. Kwiatkowski to St. Joseph Mercy Hospital in Ann Arbor two hours
after the shooting. She was able to walk into the emergency room,
staff said.
   Police said Ms. Kwiatkowski was shot with a .32-caliber handgun
because of high medical bills run up by her asthma and her obesity.
   Art Torikian, a retired sheriff's detective who lives across the
street in the Detroit suburb, said Carol Kwiatkowski feuded with
neighbors and said the woman sometimes chased her father up the
street while yelling obscenities.
   ``No, I guess it isn't a surprise,'' another neighbor, Evelyn
Fagan, said of the shooting. ``The father and older sister wanted
to keep her under their control.''

   Saks Fifth Avenue has agreed to
settle a suit _ the legal variety _ by tailoring its policy on
alterations.
   The department store chain said Tuesday it will offer free
alterations on skirts and dresses, as it does already on suits,
blazers and slacks.
   The action settles a sex-discrimination suit filed by feminist
attorney Gloria Allred on behalf of two women charged $40 each for
alterations on dresses. The suit demanded Saks charge equally for
altering men's and women's clothes.
   ``We are now adding several free alterations on dresses and
skirts, and we will continue to review the policy for similar
appropriate revisions,'' said Patricia Fox, spokeswoman for the
Saks Fifth Avenue store in Costa Mesa.
   Saks also agreed to pay the plaintiffs nearly $25,000 in legal
fees, Allred said.
   At the same time, the store chain insisted its previous policy
was fair. Saks ``has never had a double standard so it can't agree
to end one,'' said Bill Acton, spokesman for Saks, which has 45
stores nationwide.
   Acton said Saks had charged for altering dresses and skirts
because they involve more work than men's clothing. There was no
charge for minor alterations to clothing considered ``unisex,''
such as blazers and slacks.
   Allred lauded Saks as ``sensitive to issues that affect women''
and said the stores' response to the suit ``could serve as a model
for the industry.''
   ``Women cannot afford to pay more for alterations than men must
pay,'' she said. ``Charging them more solely on account of their
sex is economically damaging both to their bank accounts and to
their dignity.''

   Rescue workers reached a
snow-covered mountain today where a sightseeing plane crashed and
reported that the four Americans, five Canadians and one New
Zealander aboard all died.
   Nine bodies were recovered today and the workers were searching
in deep snow for the 10th, said Paul Fitzharris, chief police
inspector at Dunedin.
   In Washington, the State Department identified the Americans as
Gerald Burdick of Ridgefield, Conn.; George Palaez of Falls Church,
Va.; Douglas Palm of Flint, Mich., and James Duenas, no hometown
available.
   An earlier unconfirmed report in New Zealand had said the four
Americans were all from Wisconsin. Fitzharris said authorities in
New Zealand were withholding the names and hometowns of the
victims, probably until Thursday.
   A New Zealander was piloting the twin-engine Britten Norman
Islander that went down Tuesday near Mount Aspiring, between
Milford Sound and the town of Wanaka, on South Island, one of two
main islands that make up New Zealand.
   Two alpine rescue dogs were used to help a team of 27 police and
rescue personnel recover the bodies, the New Zealand Press
Association said.
   It said the wreckage was scattered about 4,000 feet up a
mountainside and that dogs were brought to help find bodies buried
in snow.
   Police site controller John Dedlury said the crash had triggered
a small avalanche that slid about 1,000 feet down the slope with
the wrecked aircraft.
   To minimize vibrations that could cause an avalanche, rescuers
used small Squirrel helicopters to carry the bodies away from the
scene.
   Some bodies were found inside the fuselage, but others were
scattered around the slope, Fitzharris said. The nine bodies were
transferred to a mortuary in the southern city of Invercargill.

   A thunderstorm gusting to 99 mph destroyed or
damaged at least 55 planes at two airports and wrecked two hangars,
causing more than $14 million in losses, authorities said today.
   The storm Tuesday evening also knocked out power to 40,000 homes
and businesses.
   About 10 planes were heavily damaged, several were overturned
and one was blown about 200 feet at McCarran International Airport,
spokesman Sam Ingalls said. Two corporate hangars were demolished,
he said.
   Damage was estimated at $14 million by Vicki Donaldson, an
airport spokeswoman, although Ingalls cautioned that was an initial
assessment.
   At Sky Harbor Airport in nearby Henderson, 13 private planes
were destroyed and others damaged, spokeswoman Teddy Macknic said.
Losses will run in the millions of dollars, she said.
   No injuries were reported from the storm, which hit about 5:30
p.m.
   ``It was out of control,'' said Karen Kerr, who was working at a
travel agency when the storm hit. ``The winds were blowing so hard.
All of our phones and electricity was out for about three hours.''
   The National Weather Service clocked winds up to 90 mph before
lightning knocked out electricity about 6 p.m. That was the highest
wind speed recorded in the Las Vegas Valley, said Charlie Schlott
of the weather service's airport office.
   George Feick, supervisor of the Federal Aviation
Administration's control tower at McCarran, said FAA equipment
registered one gust at 99 mph.
   By 10 p.m. power was restored to all but about 15,000 customers
near the airport and the University of Nevada-Las Vegas, said the
Las Vegas Valley power company.

<TEXT>
   Here is the text of Hezbollah's statement
Wednesday on the Western hostages. It was translated from Arabic by
The Associated Press.
   In The Almighty's Name
   The Zionist enemy has suffered bitter dismay because of his
failure to achieve his obectives from the crime of abducting Sheik
Abdul Karim Obeid and his relatives from the struggling town of
Jibchit, the terrorist crime of piracy.
   It is clear that things have backfired on the enemy after his
foolish crime. It has become impossible to release the Israeli POWs
and all ways for a possible swap have been blocked.
   Moreover, the refusal of the enemy to release Sheik Obeid and
his two relatives, and his linkage to the problem of the Zionisventures
over the last 58 years in the delightful Jean de
Brunhoff books.
   ``Babar: The Movie'' brings the exploits of Babar, Queen
Celeste, their children and their friends to the screen. It is a
tale within a tale: Babar tells his four children the story about
how he, Celeste and Zephir the monkey outwitted Rataxes who was
trying to conquer the elephants.
   ``The rhinos don't respect others. They just trust violence and
force,'' said Laurent de Brunhoff, who continues the series of
Babar books created by his father in 1931. ``Babar respects the
other one, and always tries to find a clever way to solve a problem
_ without using force.
   ``The film has a lot of action. In the book, it's a totally
different way of looking or listening to the story. You can take
your time and dream. In the film you're passive, so the action has
to go on the screen more intensely.''
   Dozens of Babar books are in print, including ``The Travels of
Babar,'' ``Babar and the Professor'' and the one that started it
all, ``The Story of Babar,'' in which the young elephant is crowned
king.
   Babar's admirers even include many adults such as children's
author Maurice Sendak, who once wrote, ``If he had come my way, how
I would have welcomed that little elephant and smothered him with
affection.''
   ``I think every kid likes elephants,'' de Brunhoff said in an
interview. ``They may not like them in the same way as teddy bears
or rabbits, but elephants are funny because of their trunks. To
have this elephant living like a man is very, very funny. It's
possible for the kid to assimilate himself to the elephant.''
   De Brunhoff does not avoid the darker side of life. Babar is an
orphan (his mother was killed by a hunter in the first book) and,
in the film, the rhinos capture the adult elephants, leaving their
children behind, weeping. De Brunhoff insisted that showing pain
was essential.
   ``Children like to be in the middle of a drama,'' he said.
``It's not traumatic, they just react with emotion. As long as the
good win and evil is the loser, I think it's fine.
   ``It's bad when it becomes sadistic. Otherwise, I think it's
wrong that only sweetness is good for the kids.''
   De Brunhoff, who grew up in France, was introduced to Babar the
same way as most children: through a bedtime story. In 1931, when
he was 6 years old, his mother told him about a little elephant. De
Brunhoff and his younger brother, Mathieu, were so taken in, they
repeated the story to their father, a painter at the time.
   Jean de Brunhoff quickly filled in details, naming the elephant
Babar and creating Celeste, Zephir and the ``Old Lady'' who takes
care of young Babar after his mother is killed.
   ``He did a book for us with pictures,'' Laurent de Brunhoff
recalled.
   ``He enjoyed the story a lot and everybody in the family liked
it, too. I happened to have two uncles in publishing, so the book
was published and was a success. My father made a second and third
book, and so on.''
   But in 1937, Jean de Brunhoff died of tuberculosis. At the
urging of his uncles, 13-year-old Laurent completed two books
unfinished by his father and eventually devoted himself fulltime to
Babar.
   ``After World War II, I was working as a painter,'' de Brunhoff
said. ``The idea of making a book occurred to me because I loved
Babar; he was my friend. The idea was appealing and I tried to get
close to the style of my father.''
   Laurent eventually added some of his own touches, notably using
his niece as the basis for one of Babar's daughters. A resident of
Connecticut since 1985, de Brunhoff is at work on brand new Babar
stories for an upcoming HBO series on cable-television.
   ``There are times when you have nothing to write about, but
something always comes. You're traveling, in the countryside,
fishing or meeting somebody you're interested in. Maybe someone
tells a joke,'' he said.
   ``I have my studio in the house and a wall where I put some
sketches when I'm working. I also have one or two posters in my
study, but I don't like to be overwhelmed.''

   The ``Lone Star State'' proved the

Texas license plates, outstripping ``The Bank Failure State'' and
``Pinhead Legislature.''
   Of the 7,636 ballots submitted by readers in the Austin

keep the plates the way they are _ slogan-less _ and 613 had their

   Only 121 chose ``The Friendship State,'' which was selected by
the Texas Highway Commission and ignited the whole debate.
   ``Lone Star State'' advocate Dan Wallace of Austin wrote, ``You
should have had a second category in your poll. The members of the
Texas Highway Commission should be 1) shot 2) hung 3) exiled.''
   Mary Lambert of Round Rock was one of the few who liked the
Highway Commission slogan.
   ``If we made `Lone Star State,' people would only think of

   Other suggestions included:
   ``Don't Mess With Texas''
   ``Don't Mess With Me State''
   ``Don't litterdamit''
   ``Texas, the Insolvent State''
   ``Yankee Go Home''
   ``Bluebonnet State''

<TEXT>
   In another confrontation between U.S.
and Panamanian forces, Marines disarmed a group of Panamanian
soldiers and civilians who followed the Marines into an area the
United States controls.
   The group of 29 Panamanians, including 10 military officers and
lower-ranking soldiers, was briefly detained and then released
after Tuesday's incident, said Mercedes Morris, a spokeswoman for
the U.S. Southern Command.
   She said the soldiers included Maj. Manuel Sieiro,
brother-in-law of Manuel Antonio Noriega, the head of the
Panamanian Defense Forces and Panama's de facto leader. Sieiro
commands the Chorrera military zone, where the incident occurred.
   A local mayor said the Panamanians began following the Americans
after the Marines encountered an anti-American demonstration. The
pro-government news media had called the American maneuvers a
provocation.
   Ms. Morris said the incident occurred west of this capital city
when about 40 U.S. Marines in armored vehicles were carrying out a
reconnaissance exercise on roads leading to the Panama Canal.
   She said the Panamanians ``ventured without authorization into a
military zone'' reserved exclusively for American forces.
   Ms. Morris said the Panamanians were disarmed and held for about
an hour and 15 minutes. She said their weapons, including machine
guns and rifles, will be returned to the Panamanian Defense Forces.
Five Panamanian journalists were in the detained group, but they
refused comment.
   There was no report of any Panamanian resistance.
   A series of such minor incidents have been occurring since
February 1988, when two federal grand juries in Florida indicted
Noriega on drug-trafficking and money-laundering charges.
   The United States has been trying to use economic sanctions and
diplomatic pressure to force out Noriega.
   Most of the Panamanian-American incidents have involved exchange
of a few shots during the night or the arrest of Americans accused
of traffic violations.

<HEAD>Non-Estonians Walk Off Jobs to Protest Law</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Non-Estonian factory and transit workers walked
off their jobs in the Estonian capital of Tallinn on Wednesday to
protest a new law that tightens residency requirements for voting
and holding elected office.
   ``The strike is against yesterday's decision, which the workers
consider discriminatory,'' said Yevgeny Kogan, an ethnic Russian
and leader of the InterMovement group that is pushing the interests
of Russians and other non-Estonians in the Baltic republic.
   ``I'm concerned about my children and grandchildren,'' said
Nikolai Chugunov, 42, one of those on strike at the Kalinin
electronics factory.
   ``They started with a language law, and then it's something
else, and et cetera, et cetera, et cetera,'' said Chugunov, a
33-year-resident of Tallinn, who won't be affected by the tighter
residency requirements.
   The strikers sent a committee of four to Moscow to seek a
meeting with Vice President Anatoly I. Lukyanov, Chugunov said.
   Chugunov, a member of the strike committee, said thousands of
workers were on strike at 20 enterprises in Tallinn and two in
Kokhtla-Jarve, an industrial city east of Tallinn.
   He could not give the total number of strikers, but he said that
at some of the largest factories, 3,000 or more workers were off
the job. Pickets blocked the entrances to the factories.
   Kogan, a deputy to the national Congress of People's Deputies
parliament, said in a telephone interview from Tallinn that in
addition the Elamo construction enterprise, the Dvigatel motor
works and the fishing port also were affected.
   Paab Kaala, an editor for official Estonian Radio, said he could
not estimate the number of strikers, but said the strike committee
overstated the number of strikers by several times when it
conducted a warning strike in late July.
   The Tass news agency said workers were not unloading freight
trains, and air freight was paralyzed. Many Tallinn bus drivers
also walked out, but officials brought in buses from other cities
and kept public transportation running.
   No disturbances or demonstrations were reported on the streets.
Kaala said there were no appeals from the government for the
workers to return to their jobs, or any other official statements
about the strike.
   Non-Estonians were protesting passage of a law by the republic's
Supreme Soviet, or parliament, on Tuesday, requiring residents to
live in their district for two years or anywhere in Estonia for
five years before they be allowed to vote.
   Candidates for elective office must live in the same place for
five years, or in Estonia for 10 years.
   Ethnic Estonians make up slightly more than 60 percent of the
population, and pushed the law to protect themselves from an influx
of other nationalities.
   But Russians, who make up about a third of Estonia's 1.6 million
people, charge that the law discriminates against non-Estonians who
tend to be recent arrivals.
   ``The law guarantees general voting rights to practically all
citizens of Estonian nationality, and deprives tens of thousands of
people of other nationalities,'' the national daily Izvestia quoted
deputy A. Lukoshkin telling the Estonian Supreme Soviet on Tuesday.
   The warning strike in late July ended when the government agreed
to form a commission to look into their complaints.
   Now, Tass said, the strikers are demanding that the Kremlin set
up a commission to look broadly into Estonia's drive for greater
local control.
   Estonia has become a laboratory for reforms, and the republic
has won approval from Moscow to launch a new economic policy that
Estonian leaders say will even allow it to issue its own currency.

<TEXT>
   Light rain and cooler weather today led fire bosses to lift the
``red flag'' lightning warnings that went up over the weekend in
the Northwest.
   Firefighters reported progress against dozens of mostly
lightning-caused blazes in Idaho, Washington, Oregon, Utah and
California.
   ``The temperatures have been lowering, the humidity has been
coming up,'' said Rebecca Burkhead of the Boise Interagency Fire
Center, the nation's wildfire command post. ``That's really given
us a handle on a lot of the fires.''
   The fire center replaced its long-running forecast for dry
lightning with a prediction of showers, lower temperatures and
higher humidity across the West.
   Still, 23,000 firefighters were battling blazes on 160,000 acres
of timber and range. More than 220,000 acres have been charred in
mostly lightning-caused fires since July 26.
   Western and central Idaho were still the hardest hit, with 15
major forest fires burning out of control over 104,000 acres. About
9,200 firefighters in Idaho, including hundreds of military troops,
cut fire lines in the rain.
   ``This by no means puts fires out, and it can give people a
false sense of security,'' Payette National Forest Supervisor Sonny
LaSalle said. ``But what it will do is give us the opportunity to
get a lot of line built, get some mop-up done and increase the
security around some of these fires.''
   About one-third of an inch of rain was reported Tuesday at
Lowman, a small mountain community 70 miles north of Boise
virtually leveled by fire 10 days earlier. Several dozen residents
were allowed to return home.
   Bob and Margie Carr's house was spared but everything around it
burned.
   ``The quietness and the peacefulness will come back, but the
scenery is gone,'' said Carr. ``It hurts to see this happen, but
it's happened and you can't do a thing about it.''
   Progress was reported 30 miles to the north, where 2,400
firefighters, including 600 soldiers from Colorado, battled the
18,400-acre Warm Lake fire complex.
   With higher humidity clearing the air of dense smoke, Army
Blackhawk helicopters supplemented Forest Service airpower on fires
still threatening the small town of Warren, about 120 miles north
of Boise.
   Resource losses in Idaho are estimated at more than $75 million
since a July 26 lightning storm scored the state's backcountry with
40,000 strikes, which sparked hundreds of wildfires.
   The 10,000-acre Emmett Mountain Complex and the 7,000-acre
Summit fire in the Hells Canyon National Recreation Area, on the
border with Oregon, should be contained by Thursday, said Thom
Corcoran of the Northwest Interagency Coordinating Center in
Portland, Ore.
   About 3,500 lightning strikes across Oregon started several
fires in the Siskiyou National Forest and a Bureau of Land
Management district in the southwest corner of the state, but rain
limited their size.
   The biggest fire in eastern Oregon, the 23,350-acre Canal fire,
was declared contained Tuesday evening, Corcoran said.
   Calmer, cooler weather helped firefighters contain Washington's
largest wildfire, a 2,500-acre blaze on the Colville Indian
Reservation.
   Crews by Tuesday had contained two southern California fires,
the 15,300-acre Vail fire in Cleveland National Forest and the
7,500-acre Balch fire in Sierra National Forest.
   Officials at the Chalk Creek fire, about 45 miles east of Salt
Lake City, released half the crews mopping up the 1,700-acre blaze.

<HEAD>Latest Drug Tools: Carrier Pigeons, Gas Tanks, Corn Fields</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Things are not always what they seem in the
drug trade, where a gas tank may also contain cocaine and a corn
field may hide marijuana plants.
   The barest outlines of those and other dealers' methods of
hiding drugs were listed in individual reports on drug trafficking
presented by the nation's 93 U.S. attorneys to the Justice
Department.
   A Philadelphia councilman said Wednesday that constituents told
him drug dealers were even using carrier pigeons to transport money
and messages.
   Ortiz said the birds had been spotted flying in and out of a bar
known to area residents as a hotbed for drugs.
   ``When people begin talking in the community, they're probably
right,'' Councilman Angel L. Ortiz said in an interview. ``It's too
far-fetched to be made up.''
   The U.S. attorneys who presented the report last week often
deleted details so the strategies could not be copied.
   David E. Wilson, U.S. attorney for western Washington state,
told of cocaine or money carried from Los Angeles to Seattle in a
modified gas tank.
   ``This modification consisted of the construction of a baffle
within the tank whereby the left side of the tank was a separate
compartment from the main tank,'' Wilson's report said. ``This
compartment was accessible only by removing a plate attached to the
top of the gas tank and was not visible from under the car.''
   The fuel gauge operated normally, Wilson said, but the vehicle
had to make more stops than usual for gas.
   Even fields of corn may not be quite what they appear.
   Marijuana plants are intentionally surrounded by corn plants in
Kansas, where a growing number of groups specialize ``in the
cultivation and harvesting of higher grade marijuana,'' said U.S.
Attorney Benjamin Burgess Jr.
   In Boston, authorities last year found 190 pounds of Asian
heroin concealed in a bean sprout washing machine shipped from Hong
Kong.
   Officials in Philadelphia reported the seizure of more than
2,400 pounds of cocaine hidden inside a shipment of cartons labeled
``Anchovies in Salt Water.'' The cocaine was weighted and packaged
``so as to be virtually indistinguishable from the surrounding cans
which actually contained anchovies,'' said a report by
Philadelphia-based U.S. Attorney Michael Baylson.
   Also popular with drug dealers is strapping drugs to carriers'
bodies.
   Los Angeles gang members strap crack under their clothes or send
it on Greyhound or United Parcel Service for transport to York,
Pa., according to U.S. Attorney James West of Pennsylvania's middle
district.
   In Hong Kong, authorities found spare fuel tanks loaded with 250
pounds of heroin base on a trawler in 1984.
   The same Asian drug organization that used the fuel tanks also
shipped heroin in ice buckets, wall plaques and in a shipment of
T-shirts headed for New York that was seized in Thailand in
December 1986, according to U.S. Attorney Andrew Maloney of New
York's eastern district.
   Tapes and records produced by Caribbean groups are sometimes
used to transport contraband to North American record stores, said
western Missouri U.S. Attorney Thomas M. Larson.
   Drug dealers' ``increasingly clever ways to deliver drugs and
collect money'' are forcing the authorities to change their
approach, Baylson said this week in an interview.
   ``It's becoming increasingly difficult to find large caches of
drugs because dealers are adept at spreading it around,'' he said.

   A teen-ager faces charges of aggravated battery
for allegedly breaking the limbs of an infant sharing her son's
hospital room.
   Nekenge Power, 17, of Chicago, was indicted Tuesday by a Cook
County grand jury, and was scheduled for arraignment Aug. 24, said
Maureen McHale, a spokeswoman for the state's attorney's office.
   Jasmine Ghoston was 25 days old when authorities at Mercy
Hospital discovered that both her arms and one leg had been broken.
Ms. Power's 11-month-old son, Jeramie, and Jasmine were being
treated for breathing problems, hospital officials said.
   The injuries were discovered July 11, and Ms. Power was arrested
10 days later.
   Police said Ms. Power admitted hurting Jasmine ``while trying to
stop the child from crying,'' but would reveal no details.
   David B. Selig, an attorney representing Jasmine's parents,
filed a $10 million lawsuit against Mercy Hospital on behalf of
Jasmine's parents, Yolanda Blunt and Anthony Ghoston, contending
the hospital was negligent.
   After Jasmine's injuries were discovered, her parents had her
transferred to another hospital. Jasmine was released July 22, but
remained on a machine which monitored her heart and breathing.

   Though many people have a strong aversion to
maggots, the parents of a 17-year-old girl say the centuries-old
practice of allowing the fly larvae to eat decaying human tissue
may have saved their daughter's legs.
   ``My husband said, `Let's go for it,' and Shannon said `Let's go
for it,' so we did and it worked,'' Patsy Dillingham, the patient's
mother, said Tuesday.
   Shannon Dillingham became critically ill suddenly on May 10 and
was taken from a clinic to Children's Hospital in Washington the
next day.
   Doctors there diagnosed her illness as meningococcemia, a
blood-borne bacterial infection that caused heart failure, kidney
problems and diseased skin, and eventually led to the amputation of
part of one leg and the toes on the other foot.
   Dr. Alan Fields of the hospital staff said antibiotics used to
kill the bacteria released a powerful toxin in Dillingham's
circulatory system that caused blood clots, reducing the flow of
blood to her legs.
   Meanwhile, the bacteria continued its direct attack on her skin,
rotting it from the inside out, said her father, Thomas Dillingham,
a Poolesville town commissioner.
   Once Shannon's doctors amputated her left leg below the knee and
her toes on the right foot, they still were faced with cleaning the
remaining skin so skin grafts could be done. Antibiotics did not
work fast enough and paring the skin from her legs did not work
well enough, her doctors said.
   ``With Shannon's tissue dying, they needed to do something,''
said Patsy Dillingham. ``When they use surgery, they take the live
tissue as well as the dead tissue, and they had taken so much that
they wanted to avoid that at all cost. All of her skin from the
waist down was dying.''
   After a long search by the hospital and the Dillinghams, more
than 1,500 fly larvae were located in Ohio. On July 21, Shannon
watched as the insects, so tiny she could barely seem them, were
released onto her legs and secured with tape.
   ``At first, they tickled when they put them in. My nurse and I
were laughing,'' she said. ``I could feel them moving everywhere.''
   After 36 hours, doctors used a high-pressure hose to wash them
away. By then, the maggots had grown from less than one-sixteenth
inch in diameter to nearly as big around as the end of a little
finger, her father said.
   ``It's a gruesome issue, but we know that it can work,'' said
Dr. Thomas T. Provost, chairman of the Department of Dermatology at
Johns Hopkins Hospital. ``It's clinically well-known that maggots
will eat the dead tissue while leaving healthy tissue intact.''
   Maggots have been used for centuries to remove dead tissue from
infected wounds, said Dr. Joel Howell, assistant professor of
internal medicine and history at the University of Michigan Medical
Center in Ann Arbor.
   ``When you have an infected wound, you'd rather have an animal,
like a maggot, eat it up rather than letting (the infectious
tissue) stay there,'' Howell said. ``It was probably used more
before antibiotics, or when it was more difficult for people to get
to surgery.''
   Although the treatment has been used in the United States since
at least the Civil War, Provost said it has been used in modern
times only as a last resort because of people's aversion to the
maggots.
   ``It is really horrendous,'' Provost said, ``and most physicians
are reluctant to do it because it tends to be sensationalized.''
   But Dillingham, a former teacher of biology, physiology and
anatomy, was familiar with the cleaning capabilities of the insects
and encouraged his daughter to try it.
   ``I just wanted to get out of the hospital,'' said Shannon, who
is senior class president and a member of the Poolsville
Junior-Senior High School track team. ``If the maggots meant I
could get out sooner, then I wanted them to use them.''
   Shannon's doctors are optimistic she will walk again with
protheses.
   ``The grafts have taken a hundred percent,'' her mother said.
``We're on the home stretch now.''

   Charlie Campbell can continue to dispense legal
advice, chess lessons and religious instruction on the sidewalk
across the street from police headquarters.
   The attorney, ticketed on loitering charges after working out of
a van, beat the rap by default Tuesday in 36th District Court when
police failed to appear.
   ``The quick-silvered sparrow slipped the eagle's claw,'' said
Campbell, dressed in his usual courtroom attire _ a suit, tennis
shoes and Detroit Tigers' cap.
   Executive Deputy Police Chief James Bannon said he ordered
Campbell ticketed because his makeshift office, which blocked the
sidewalk with lawn chairs, Bibles and chessboards, was an
``eyesore.''
   ``I'm here to give a smile and a pat on the back for all the
needy people coming out of the jail,'' Campbell said.
   Jay Nolan, Campbell's attorney, said ``This is an important
victory for freedom of assembly. We've made the street safe for
loafers again.''

<HEAD>Panel's First Task to Tackle Health Care Financing</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By NANCY BENAC</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The head of a Social Security advisory panel
that starts work this week said Wednesday the council's first
mission is to tackle the financing of a health care system that
faces new strains with the aging of the Baby Boom generation.
   Deborah Steelman, head of the Advisory Council on Social
Security, said the current health care system ``overlaps,
duplicates, omits, confuses'' and leaves many needy people without
adequate care.
   ``It is critical that we develop recommendations for a sound,
sustainable health care financing system, one that delivers the
benefits people need, at a price we can all afford,'' she said at a
breakfast meeting with reporters.
   The 13-member advisory council holds its opening meeting on
Thursday and Friday. Such a panel is appointed every four years to
examine issues affecting the Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid
programs.
   Ms. Steelman said the council hopes to issue a draft report on
health care financing by July 1990 and recommendations on the
financing and role of Social Security benefits by December 1990. A
final report to Congress and the Department of Health and Human
Services is due in January 1991.
   Ms. Steelman said the current Medicare system ``is projected to
be insolvent by early in the next century, before the Baby Boom has
even begun to enter retirement.''
   The smaller ranks of people in the generations following the
Baby Boom will make it difficult for them to finance benefits for
the bulge in retirees that precedes them, she said.
   Meanwhile, the current patchwork health care system and various
proposals for reform leave patients ``in a wilderness of health
care finance, trying to figure out what they're covered for, what
they're not,'' she said.
   ``I think there's a growing consensus that we have followed the
meandering path of health care financing just about as long as we
can afford to,'' Ms. Steelman said. ``I personally believe you
cannot fix this system without starting over.''
   Ms. Steelman said she is hopeful the panel will come up with new
ideas on how to restructure the health care system, saying the
council ``can be very radical'' as it searches for solutions.
   ``We can be the spurs in the side of the horse,'' she said.
   Ms. Steelman, a lawyer, was a Bush campaign adviser and is a
former associate director of the Office of Management and Budget.

<HEAD>Saxophonist Benny Carter Saluted at Lincoln Center</HEAD>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Alto saxophonist Benny Carter, playing and
hearing his compositions at a concert on his 82nd birthday, told
the audience he's ``looking forward to a whole lot more.''
   Carter's alto saxophone style was elegant and tasteful at
Tuesday night's concert in Alice Tully Hall. It was the fourth
concert of six in this year's Classical Jazz at Lincoln Center
series.
   Carter's compositions, and arrangements for the Fletcher
Henderson and Count Basie bands, were important in the development
of big band swing.
   However, Tuesday's concert was uneven. Pianist Hank Jones,
bassist Ray Brown and drummer Bobby Durham started tentatively,
with ``Key Largo.'' Carter joined them for ``Blues in My Heart.''
Ernestine Anderson, who couldn't get rid of a frog in her throat,
sang a tune that sounded country-western and another that called
for a bossa nova beat. The drums were too loud and the bass too
soft.
   Every time the music began to capture a listener's attention,
the master of ceremonies brought the audience back down with long,
irrelevant remarks about the musicians.
   After intermission, Dizzy Gillespie joined the four, and some
starch entered the evening. Carter introduced ``Carter Gillespie
Inc.,'' which he said they recorded in 1976. It included a pretty
melody for their duet. ``Easy Money,'' which followed, swung. And
it was about time.
   Sylvia Sims sang three Carter songs, nicely swinging the first
one, ``Blue Moonlight.'' Carter played his lyrical ``Evening Star.''
   The best part of the evening had Jon Hendricks singing ``When
Lights Are Low,'' ``Cow Cow Boogie'' and ``Doozy'' and Jon
Hendricks and Company singing the arrangement Carter wrote for
Basie of his sparkling ``Meetin' Time.''
   The finale had everybody singing ``All That Jazz'' and Carter,
saying he was overwhelmed, blowing out candles on a cake. Icing
melted by the burning candles splashed onto Carter's suit.
Gillespie whipped out his big handkerchief and played mopup.

<TEXT>
   Two leading social scientists who tried in May to
persuade Chinese legislators to oust Premier Li Peng were expelled
Wednesday from the Communist Party and fired from their research
posts.
   Yan Jiaqi, who fled to the West, and Bao Zunxin, who is believed
to have been arrested, are the first party members to be expelled
in the crackdown on dissent that has followed the June 3-4 army
attack on student pro-democracy protesters.
   Many other academics have been arrested or lost their jobs. But
even party General Secretary Zhao Ziyang, who was ousted from his
party posts, has been allowed for now to retain his party
membership.
   The official Xinhua News Agency said Yan and Bao ``were expelled
because both had stubbornly clung to bourgeois liberalism over a
long period of time.'' Bourgeois liberalism is China's official
phrase for Western-style liberalism.
   They also were fired from their research fellowships at the
prestigious Chinese Academy of Social Sciences.
   ``They joined in fanning and organizing the recent student
unrest, turmoil and counterrevolutionary rebellion,'' Xinhua said.
It accused Yan, who recently helped organize a Chinese students'
group in the United States, of continuing to plot against China's
leadership from abroad. A warrant has been issued for Yan's arrest.
   Xinhua did not comment on Bao's whereabouts. Both are among 10
authors whose works can no longer be published or sold.
   Since January, they were prominent participants in an emergent
democratic movement among intellectuals that was crushed when the
army crushed the seven-week student protests.
   Both signed petitions for the release of political prisoners,
and after the students began marching, both spoke out in support.
They signed a May 17 declaration that said China was still ruled by
an emperor, a reference to senior leader Deng Xiaoping, and
published an article in a Hong Kong newspaper calling on China's
legislature to oust Li.
   In othere developments Wednesday:
   _ Foreign-language newspapers went back on sale at Beijing
hotels after being banned nearly a month ago.
   _ Chinese newspapers continued to harshly criticize Zhao, the
ousted party chief, and said Western concepts of human rights were
irrelevant in China. However, Li Ruihuan, the party official in
charge of press and cultural control said the party still wanted
``exploration in art and literature.''
   Hotel managers in Beijing said they did not know why the
state-run China National Publications Import and Export Co. resumed
delivering foreign newspapers this week.
   ``They came as silently as they left,'' said Max Wilhelm,
manager of the Great Wall Sheraton. He said company officials told
him ``things have been settled, but we never got a straight
answer'' about what the problem was.
   The publications company halted its deliveries in mid-July and
seized copies of newspapers and magazines already on hotel racks.
Hotels in other tourist cities were not affected.
   Most of Beijing's major hotels said newspaper delivery resumed
on Monday or Tuesday, but they did not receive any magazines or
Hong Kong-based Chinese-language newspapers.
   ``Maybe the magazines will come tomorrow, and maybe next week
we'll get the television,'' Wilhelm said. The government ordered
hotels to cut their reception of foreign television, including the
U.S.-based Cable News Network, last month.
   Hotels are among the few places Chinese have access to foreign
publications that provide alternatives to the official line on the
protests and crackdown.
   China's leading newspaper, meanwhile, heaped more criticism on
Zhao. In a front-page article, the People's Daily accused Zhao of
using the pretext of ``adapting'' the party to new ideas to weaken
its ideological stance.
   The Beijing Daily ran a commentary arguing that China's human
rights policy is irrelevant because China rejects Western
definitions of human rights.
   ``They make human rights out to be independent of society,'' it
said. ``Therefore, it is a sacrifice any time the authority of the
society, race or country demands necessary limits on the authority
of the individual. They cry out that this is an invasion of human
rights.''
   The commentary said that under Marxism, ``no human rights exist
outside of or independent of society.''

<TEXT>
   Union leaders Wednesday accepted a London subway
management pay offer and told workers to abandon a 15th weekly
strike planned for Thursday.
   Andy Dodds, assistant general secretary of the National Union of
Railwaymen, and leaders of the Associated Society of Locomotive
Engineers and Firemen said they were pleased with the pay offer,
although it represented about one-third of what London Underground
drivers had been seeking for operating trains alone under a planned
phase-out of rear guards.
   Under the mediated offer, the Underground's 2,600 drivers will
receive an extra $27.10 weekly, without having to boost
productivity as management initially had demanded. Drivers had
asked for an extra $104 a week.
   Guards will also receive a separate $9.70 a week raise in the
deal.
   Union leaders said they were confident workers would be on their
jobs Thursday.
   Most of the pay raise would be paid beginning Aug. 1, and the
rest on Jan. 1, when drivers will earn $539 a week.
   A board appointed by the government's Advisory Conciliation and
Arbitration Service last week mediated the agreement between
management and unions as the 15th strike loomed.
   The subway strikes have been one of the longest-running
stoppages during a summer of labor unrest, which also hit passport
offices, railways, London's double-decker buses and other
industries.

   Civil rights leaders said Wednesday it was
kind of President Bush to come talk at their conference, but one
added that it's now time to ``dance with me, Prexy.''
   ``We set the clock yesterday when he started talking and we will
run it until we get here next year,'' John D. Jacob, president of
the National Urban League, told reporters at a news conference
winding up a four-day convention here.
   The Rev. Joseph E. Lowery, president of the Southern Christian
Leadership Conference, struck a similar note in a concluding
address.
   ``We heard Mr. Bush say the right words. Now he must turn on the
music and dance with me, Prexy,'' he told delegates.
   ``Yesterday's meeting with the president would have been a lot
different if he had some dependency on African American voters,''
Jacob said.
   ``The truth of the matter is that George Bush was being kind
when he came here yesterday. We didn't elect him and he knew that.''
   Bush in his speech committed his administration to combatting
discrimination, but some delegates expressed disappointment that he
did not comment on recent Supreme Court decisions that have eroded
affirmative action.
   ``We must call the administration to sacrament,'' said Lowery.
``We must call it to deal realistically with the terrible problems
we face today.''
   Jacob said he believes Republicans are making modest inroads
among black voters, but added, ``If the Republicans are really
serious about attracting African Americans, they need to get some
programs that deal with the problems, concerns and aspirations of
the African American community.''
   He said Bush was the first president to participate in a
national Urban League conference in a non-election year since Jimmy
Carter in 1977.
   ``This president has at least said that he is willing to debate
the issues and work with us,'' the Urban League president said.
   Jacob said he believed the conference made headway in dealing
with the issue of drugs, which was high on its agenda.
   ``I think this conference has made a major contribution through
raising the consciousness level,'' he said, ``but also putting this
organization on record as being at least one national organization
that is African American that has publicly stated that it intends
to wage war on drugs.''
   Jacob said it was up to the government to stop drugs at the
border and provide drug treatment programs, but, ``We can, in our
own neighborhoods, help put the pushers in jail.''

<TEXT>
   A Nicaraguan refugee being held at an immigration
detention facility is fighting to be deported to his homeland.
   Four months after a judge ruled that Samuel Thomas should be
sent back to Nicaragua, he remains at the Krome Avenue detention
center. He's even willing to buy his own ticket back to Managua,
the Nicaraguan capital.
   ``I can't stand it. I'm desperate to see my family,'' said
Thomas, 31. ``I want to go, but they don't want to send me.''
   Of the dozen or so Nicaraguans at Krome, Thomas is the only one
who wants to go back, he said.
   Thomas' case is bogged down in Washington, where it is under
review by the Immigration and Naturalization Service and the
Justice Department.
   Since 1987, it has been standard for Nicaraguans' deportation
orders to be checked by Justice Department officers to give
asylum-seekers an extra level of review before they're forced out
of the country, said Ken Powers, assistant director of deportation
for the Miami district of INS.
   ``I would have to admit it's bureaucracy,'' Powers said of
Thomas' situation. ``We've added additional steps to protect the
rights of Nicaraguans going to back to Nicaragua. This process is
very cumbersome.''
   But added Powers, ``It's ridiculous to have the system prevent a
guy from going back.''
   Thomas arrived March 15 at Miami International Airport with a
valid visa but without documentation as a cruise ship employee. He
initially asked for asylum at the airport but dropped that by the
time he had a hearing April 11.
   The INS ruled him excludable, and Thomas didn't appeal.
   At that point, Powers said, even though it had been noted in
Thomas' file that he wanted to be deported, his records were
shipped to Washington along with those of people fighting
deportation.

<HEAD>Democratic Fax Machine Alerts Media About Republican Robinson's Speech</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: Subs 9th graf, `He said...' to make clear that comment is from
Blakely.</HEAD>

   Nearly two weeks after U.S. Rep. Tommy
Robinson defected to the Republicans, a facsimile machine belonging
to the Arkansas Democratic Party was used to publicize a speech he
was to make.
   ``I see a little humor in that,'' Robinson said Wednesday.
   A news release sent by fax to The Associated Press on Monday
said Robinson, identified in the release as a Republican, would
speak Wednesday at the West Little Rock Rotary Club.
   It said reporters could contact Kip Blakely for more information
and gave a telephone number.
   The number was for the headquarters of the state Democratic
Party, where Blakely is executive director. He is also in charge of
Rotary Club publicity.
   Blakely confirmed Wednesday that he sent the release.
   ``It really is a real deal. It did come from us. I'm a member of
that club and on the board and one of my responsibilities is
advising the press. We asked Congressman Robinson about three
months ago to come and speak to us,'' Blakely said.
   Robinson switched from Democrat to Republican on July 28, saying
he was no longer comfortable as a conservative southerner in his
old party.
   Blakely said he saw no problem with using a Democratic Party fax
machine to get news coverage for a Republican, and said he uses the
machine to relay weekly releases about the Rotary Club's guest
speakers to newsrooms in Little Rock.
   ``It was not like it was long distance,'' Blakely said, adding
that there was no cost to the party for the local call.
   ``Certainly I appreciate the free publicity,'' Robinson said,
``but I don't know if that will put him in good standing with the
Democrats. I think it's a very kind gesture on their part to let
people know about my speech by way of their fax machine.''
   ``I like Kip Blakely and I don't have anything against Arkansas
Democrats. One day they will make the same decision I have made,''
Robinson said Wednesday.
   Blakely was joshed by Ken Coon, chairman of the Arkansas
Republican Party.
   ``We make mistakes ourselves sometimes. I guess Kip secretly
wants to change,'' Coon said with a laugh Wednesday. ``I appreciate
the publicity. We need all the help we can get.''
   Blakely said he joked about Robinson during last week's Rotary
meeting. ``Tongue in cheek, I stood up and asked Mr. President
whether it would be the honorable thing for the congressman to
address us since we scheduled him when he was with one party and
switched to another,'' he said.
   On Tuesday, Robinson was introduced to a meeting of civic clubs
at Benton as: ``A Democrat, Tommy Robinson ...''
   The man giving the introduction said the information came
directly from a biography supplied by Robinson's office.
   Robinson replied with a grin: ``I will check with my staff when
I get back to the office this afternoon about the bio they sent
out.''

   Public Enemy, the rappers who went on hiatus
after firing one member for his anti-Semitic remarks, announced
Wednesday they are reunited and planning a new album before the end
of the year.
   ``After having taken time out for reorganization, Public Enemy
is back in action,'' began an eight-paragraph, state-of-the-band
statement from leader Chuck D. ``The show must go on. Brace
yourselves for 1990.''
   The group announced at the end of June that it was taking a
break after firing its ``minister of information,'' Professor
Griff, for anti-Semitic remarks in a newspaper interview. As part
of the reorganization, Griff now is the band's ``supreme allied
chief of community relations,'' Chuck D. said.
   Griff will not be available for any further interviews, the band
leader announced.
   Public Enemy's follow-up to their smash ``It Takes a Nation of
Millions to Hold Us Back'' album will be titled ``Fear of a Black
Planet.'' Their current single, ``Fight the Power,'' is on the
soundtrack of the Spike Lee film ``Do The Right Thing.''
   ``We're still pro-black, pro-black culture and pro-human race.
Please direct any further questions to (Guns N' Roses vocalist) Axl
Rose,'' said Chuck D.

   President Bush today pledged to pursue every
diplomatic channel to win the release of the hostages in Lebanon
but vowed not to get involved in ``trading off or negotiating for
hostages.''
   ``I hope I am open-minded enough to talk and to exercise every
diplomatic channel I can to free these Americans,'' Bush said in a
brief question-and-answer session in the Oval Office. ``And no
American is going to be content until these Americans are free.''
   Promising to pursue every avenue to win the release of the
hostages, Bush said the lives of all of them are ``too precious for
me to be sticking my head in the sand.''
   The president said some parties who have been ambivalent or
silent on the hostage issue are now willing to help because they
are ``so infuriated or angered or repulsed'' by a videotape
purporting to show an American hostage hanging from a rope, as well
as by a death threat against another American.
   ``There is a common thread: this is too much, enough is
enough,'' Bush said.
   Bush was asked about his policy on dealing with hostage takers
in the wake of a comment in an interview with The Boston Globe in
which he said, ``We do not negotiate in any way that's going to
jeopardize the lives of other Americans.''
   The administration's policy has been that the United States will
talk with anyone but will not negotiate for the release of the
hostages.
   ``I don't think there's any subtle change'' from the position he
took in 1986 when he led a task force that wrote a report on
terrorism, Bush said.
   ``I'm not going to do anything that would put some other
American, perhaps in some other place at some other time, at
risk,'' Bush said. ``And that means trading off or negotiating for
hostages.''
   Discussing his policy on dealing with kidnappers, particularly
on whether the United States might release billions of dollars in
frozen Iranian assets, Bush said he would ``do nothing that will be
seen a quid pro quo for hostages.''
   Bush answered questions while posing in the Oval Office with
Cardinal Bernard Law, the Roman Catholic leader of Boston. Bush
called on Americans to say a prayer this weekend for the hostages
and their families, as well as for world peace.
   The president said he wanted to be alert to any possible opening
to win the hostages' release. ``I don't want to miss a signal,'' he
said.
   Bush has been described by his spokesman as cautiously
optimistic, but said in the Globe interview he had no reason to
believe the hostage problem would be solved in the immediate future.
   He told reporters today, ``I've never felt that the hostages
would be here tomorrow but I hope they will. I hope that something
will happen.''
   Earlier, White House press secretary Marlin Fitzwater, while
saying there was no new policy, acknowledged that the
administration had come up with new language ``to give definition''
to the U.S. stand.
   In another development, the wife of Marine Lt. Col. William
Higgins said she is praying for Bush's efforts to ``save the
living'' U.S. hostages in Lebanon, acknowledging that her husband
almost certainly is dead.
   Robin Higgins, wearing her Marine Corps uniform and speaking in
a calm and steady voice, acknowledged for the first time Tuesday it
is a ``virtual certainty'' her husband is dead.
   ``Now is not the time for anger and bitterness, for
recrimination and blame.
   ``Now is the time for calm reflection. ... Now is the time to
tell Rich Higgins that we love him and we miss him,'' she said.
   Higgins was the commander of a U.N. peacekeeping force in
southern Lebanon when he was abducted on Feb. 17, 1988.
   His Shiite Moslem kidnappers released a 30-second videotape a
week ago that purported to show him dangling by a rope, bound and
gagged. The terrorists said the U.S. officer was hanged in
retaliation for Israel's kidnapping of Sheik Abdul Karim Obeid, a
Moslem cleric.
   Mrs. Higgins, a Marine major, is on leave from her job as a
Pentagon public affairs officer.
   In her statement, she made no mention of the grisly videotape
released by her husband's kidnappers.
   The FBI says it has concluded ``within a reasonable degree of
medical certainty'' that the person depicted in the videotape was
Higgins, but it released no information about the time or cause of
death.
   The bureau's analysis suggests Higgins was killed in some other
manner before the videotape was made, according to an
administration official who declined to be named publicly.
   Mrs. Higgins, her hands shaking slightly as she read from her
prepared text, said she had been ``advised ... of the virtual
certainty that my husband ... is dead'' by the Marine commandant,
Gen. Alfred Gray. She also noted she had received calls from the
president.
   ``I am also mindful of the fact that our president has agonized
in a very profound and personal manner over my husband's fate,''
she said. ``He has my prayers and my support as he tries to save
the living and end the suffering.''
   In her statement, Mrs. Higgins lauded her husband as a man of
tolerance and dignity who served as a U.N. peacekeeper because of
``a profound sense of duty.''
   ``Rich went to Lebanon in the service of the United Nations
because he believed he could be useful, that he could help, that he
was needed,'' Mrs. Higgins said.
   ``He wrote in his high school yearbook that his goal was `always
to make my family proud of me,''' Mrs. Higgins said. ``He
succeeded.''

   A woman was sentenced to six months
in jail today for abandoning her newborn daughter in a jetliner
bathroom.
   Christina LoCasto, 24, of New York City pleaded no contest May
25 to felony child endangerment in a plea bargain promising her no
more than a year in jail. She could have received six years in
prison if convicted.
   Authorities said Mrs. LoCasto secretly gave birth on a United
Airlines DC-10 in 1988 before the plane left Newark, N.J., and
stuffed the baby in the trash.
   The child, named Alyssa, was found after the plane landed in San
Francisco. Mrs. LoCasto turned herself in the next day.
   Superior Court Judge Margaret Kemp rejected a plea for probation
from Mrs. LoCasto's lawyer and the Probation Department. In
addition to sending her to jail in New York City, he placed her on
2{ years' probation and fined her about $800.
   Prosecutor Stephen Wagstaffe told the judge Mrs. LoCasto should
go to jail. ``Any consideration of keeping the family together
ought to be outweighed by the danger she created for the child,''
he said.
   The judge said it appeared LoCasto simply wanted the baby to
``go away.'' She said she found it hard to believe the infant had
survived the ordeal.
   Mrs. LoCasto's husband, Louis LoCasto, told authorities the
couple had been having marital problems when Alyssa was conceived
and he had no idea his wife was pregnant.
   The child is in the custody of her grandparents in New York City.

<TEXT>
   Burma's military government has set up
more regional military courts and extended martial law powers to
junior army commanders, according to an official Burmese report.
   The report, issued Tuesday, came on the first anniversary of the
beginning of a natiowide uprising for democracy, which Gen. Saw
Maung crushed in September after he took power.
   A July 18 order empowered the commanders of the Rangoon region
and northwestern and central areas to establish military courts to
try martial law violators. These were already put into effect in
the capital, Rangoon.
   The new courts, which can impose sentences ranging from three
years in prison to death, have now been set up in the northwestern
and central military administrative districts, the official Radio
Rangoon said Tuesday, quoting new orders dated Aug. 2. A transcript
of the report was available Wednesday in Bangkok.
   The new orders also extended the authority to dispense martial
law to junior commanders in both areas.
   On Aug. 8, 1988, tens of thousands of people took to the streets
of Rangoon to protest a quarter century of harsh socialist rule.
The following day, troops shot and killed hundreds of unarmed
protesters.
   Although Saw Maung has promised to hold multiparty elections
next year, martial law forbids open political dissent.
   However, Western diplomats in Rangoon reported a number of small
protests by students who braved martial law to commemorate last
year's protests.
   One diplomat reached by telephone from Bangkok on Wednesday
quoted a witness who reported seeing a student clubbed on the head
with a rifle butt Tuesday. Troops at the time were reportedly
dispersing about 70 demonstrators and 200 bystanders in the center
of Rangoon.
   Five people were arrested, said the diplomat, who spoke on
condition of anonymity.
   The diplomat said there were also reports from the northern city
of Mandalay that several thousand monks had mounted a protest
Tuesday.
   He said groups of up to 300 monks walked in single file past
heavy concentrations of troops brought into the city to ward off
protests. The action was interpreted as ``a pointed protest showing
the feeling of the monks against the regime,'' the diplomat said.

<HEAD>Tossed in a Storm of Sequels, `The Abyss' Surfaces as an Original</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN HORN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>HOLLYWOOD (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   ``The Abyss'' could well be this summer's most
ambitious, most problematic and, finally, most fascinating movie.
   ``The Abyss'' features no major stars, and while the rest of the
film season has unfolded nearly seamlessly, this $43 million
project was a magnet for miscues. It missed its original release
date by a month, and because its rough cut ran 40 minutes long, a
number of important expository and spectacular effects scenes were
cut.
   But 20th Century Fox's ``The Abyss'' finally arrived, opening
Wednesday on 1,550 screens.
   The cast and crew of this technically uncompromising adventure
movie endured 3{ months of principal filming, 40 percent of it
underwater. It stars Ed Harris (``The Right Stuff'') and Mary
Elizabeth Mastrantonio (``January Man'').
   So elaborate is the film's look and sound that almost everyone
from director James Cameron to sound mixer Lee Orloff labored seven
days a week, every week, throughout the first half of 1989.
   The final print of ``The Abyss'' was completed just hours before
its first media preview, on July 28. ``The ringing sound of
hysteria was always just around the corner,'' said Cameron, the
writer and director of such acclaimed and personal techno-thrillers
as ``The Terminator'' and ``Aliens.''
   ``It seems t
cut is a crucial sequence explaining that the story's underwater
aliens are worried about nuclear war. That's why the sub crashes,
the hurricane suddenly materializes and a now deleted tidal-wave
assault develops.
   ``Jim had a huge story to tell,'' Mastrantonio said. ``And
there's a whole lot that's been cut. But given the time limitations
of any normal film ... I think that he's told it cohesively.''
   Cameron and Hurd say, too, they have succeeded in assembling a
persuasive and cautionary tale about common people facing uncommon
circumstances.
   ``A film should always try to take somebody somewhere, whether
it's emotionally or physically transporting one to another place,''
Cameron said. ``I see this as much of an emotional journey as a
physical one.
   ``The great thing about film is that you can really do anything.
You can show the biggest, most spectacular thing in the world, and
in the next split second you can focus down to the most microcosmic
human moment.
   ``The ocean is for many people a great primal fear,'' the
director said. ``It's a very powerful thing, it can be incredibly
fickle _ weather and currents can turn on you instantly _ but it's
also the source of life and a place of incredible wonder.''

   A small earthquake centered in a remote
southern section of the San Bernardino National Forest was barely
felt in nearby desert resort communities Wednesday, authorities
said.
   ``I didn't feel a thing and didn't hear about any telephone
calls,'' said a police dispatcher in Palm Springs, about 10 miles
away from the epicenter.
   The 6:42 a.m. temblor measured 3.3 on the Richter scale, and its
epicenter was pinpointed near the forest's southern boundary, said
Robert Finn of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena.
No damage was reported.
   Also Wednesday, a minor earthquake shook south-central Utah, but
no damage or injuries were reported, the University of Utah
Seismograph Stations said.
   Spokeswoman Sue Nava said the 9:28 a.m. MDT quake, measuring 3.3
on the Richter scale, was centered seven miles south-southeast of
Beaver.
   On Tuesday, a strong earthquake struck the San Francisco Bay
area, 400 miles north of the quake near Anza. That 1:13 a.m.
temblor had a magnitude of 5.2.
   The Richter scale is a gauge of the energy released by an
earthquake, as measured by the ground motion recorded on a
seismograph. Every increase of one number means a tenfold increase
in magnitude, or the height of quake-generated shock waves recorded
on a seismograph.
   Some experts say the actual amount of energy released may be 30
times greater.
   An earthquake of 3.5 on the Richter scale can cause slight
damage in the local area, 4 moderate damage, 5 considerable damage,
6 severe damage.

   The mother of a Domino's Pizza driver who
was killed when his truck crashed has made a video for Domino's
franchise holders asking them to consider the hazards their drivers
face trying to beat the clock.
   ``It's really to make an impact on them, on the danger aspect
and the safety aspect,'' Suzanne Boutros said Wednesday.
   Mrs. Boutros said she agreed to make the video when she and the
pizza-maker came to an understanding after they ``agreed to
disagree'' about the company's 30-minute delivery guarantee that
she has campaigned to have scrapped.
   The video was shot at her home last weekend in anticipation of
the company's annual meeting of franchise owners in Detroit this
week, but spokesman Ron Hingst said it could not be edited in time.
Instead, it will be used as part of training materials for the
company based at Ann Arbor, Mich., he said.
   The video evolved out of talks Mrs. Boutros has had with company
officials since the June 3 death of her son, Jesse Colson, 17.
   His company-owned truck hit a utility pole along a wet highway
near Mooresville, southeast of Indianapolis. He was delivering a
pizza at the time, and his mother believes the pressure to get it
to the customer on time contributed to the accident.
   ``Domino's contacted me and we sat down and had some
discusssion,'' said Mrs. Boutros, a resident of suburban
Plainfield. ``They had mentioned that (the video) as a possibility,
and would I be interested? I thought it was some way I could make a
contribution.
   Mrs. Boutros said the small amount she was paid for making the
video would be used to buy a marker for her son's grave. She would
not say how much she was paid.
   ``The people I have talked to are very sincere,'' Mrs. Boutros
said. ``That was a big factor why I decided to go ahead and work
with them.''
   Domino's has started an advertising campaign in which 21 million
box lids are printed with a safety message from company President
Dave Black.
   In his message, Black says a Domino's pizza is usually ready for
delivery within 12 minutes of receipt of the order. That leaves
drivers 18 minutes to get to a customer's home. Delivery areas
average two miles or less, Black says.
   ``Incidentally, if for some reason we miss our 30-minute
guarantee, we pay the $3 refund, never the delivery person,'' Black
adds in the message.
   Domino's also asks its customers to call a toll-free number to
report driving incidents involving company employees.

   The stock market's recent climb toward record
highs is worrying some investors who wonder whether the elevation
in stock prices will be followed by a plunge like the October 1987
crash.
   Nearly a third of the paper value of stocks was wiped out in the
crash and the weeks preceding it. With the market on a path
remarkably similar to the one it followed the months before the
crash, comparisons to 1987 are being drawn.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials rose 4.18 points on
Tuesday to finish at 2,699.17, approaching the record 2,722.42
close of Aug. 25, 1987. Today the Dow was up 3.60 at 2,702.77 at
1:30 p.m. EDT.
   The current rally's apologists point to dissimilarities in
market conditions between then and now that they contend should
lead to a much happier outcome this time.
   ``The current financial environment bears little resemblance to
the fall of 1987,'' said Michael Sherman, an analyst at the
investment firm of Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. ``At that time,
long-term bond interest rates exceeded 10 percent and were rising.
Today those rates are down near 8 percent and have been falling.
   ``In the fall of 1987 the dollar was plunging to new lows. So
far this year the dollar has been rising.''
   In addition, analysts say, improvements in corporate health in
the past two years may make a sharp downturn less likely. Corporate
profits, the traditional base on which stock prices rest, have
increased by as much as 65 to 70 percent.
   In other words, stock prices, in relation to the earnings of the
companies they represent, appear nowhere near as overextended as
they were in 1987.
   The 30 stocks that make up the Dow Jones industrial average
traded at about 20 times earnings in August 1987. Lately this
price-earnings ratio has been about 12-1, a much more moderate
level by historical standards.
   Takeovers and buyouts of corporations, which gave investors a
reason to put extra-high values on stocks before the crash, are as
rampant as ever in the 1989 marketplace.
   Bids for companies using borrowed money continue to put a burden
of debt on the economy that worries skeptics, who argue that many
of the apparent lessons of the crash have been forgotten or ignored.
   Still, active investors who watch their holdings rise in value
because of buyout news or rumors find it hard to see the takeover
trend in a negative light.
   ``It seems there aren't as many stocks to go around as there
used to be,'' observed Thomas Bailey, chairman of the Janus Group
of mutual funds in Denver, in a recent report to shareholders.
``What's left is worth more.''
   Professional traders engaged in large-scale computer trading
strategies, often painted as primary villains during the crash,
also still are very much in evidence.
   As in the early stages of 1987, they lately have been credited
on several occasions with helping to drive stock prices higher
through their so-called index arbitrage activity. In a market
downturn, their critics say, their presence could make things worse.
   However, one computerized strategy known as portfolio insurance
has not made much of a comeback since the market collapse, when it
failed to deliver all its promised benefits as a hedging method.
   ``That's the one good thing we could say about the crash,''
declared Raymond F. DeVoe Jr., an analyst at Legg Mason Wood Walker
Inc. ``It helped get rid of the portfolio insurance people.''
   Should another overwhelming selloff hit the markets now, a
series of measures known as ``circuit breakers'' has been adopted
since the crash that would provide for automatic trading halts at
predetermined points.
   It remains unknown how well these would work in practice _
whether halts in trading would help restore order or perversely
work to prolong the agony. Hardly anybody is especially eager to
find out.

<HEAD>US Authorizes Return of Dependents to China</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   About 260 American dependents of U.S.
government personnel in China who were evacuated from that country
two months ago have been authorized to return, the State Department
said today.
   Department spokeswoman Margaret Tutwiler said the decision was
based on an assessment that the security situation has improved in
China. But she said the State Department is continuing to recommend
that Americans defer non-essential travel to China until further
notice.
   The dependents were ordered home on June 7 in the wake of
``indiscriminate firing'' by Chinese troops on a compound for
diplomats and other foreign residents.
   The shooting incident prompted a strong U.S. protest to Chinese
authorities. Ms. Tutwiler was unable to say whether the issue was
resolved to the satisfaction of U.S. officials.
   The evacuation was ordered three days after protestors who had
occupied Tienanmen Square in Beijing for weeks were routed by
Chinese military forces.
   Other officials said almost all dependents of other foreign
diplomatic missions have since returned to China. In addition,
about 150 of the estimated 350 U.S. businessmen who left China in
June in China have returned, they said.

   Iran will help free Western hostages if
Israel releases an abducted Shiite Moslem cleric and if four
Iranians missing in Lebanon, long thought to be dead, are located,
a Tehran newspaper said Wednesday.
   Abrar, the Farsi-language paper, did not mention a condition set
by the English-language Tehran Times on Tuesday: freeing billions
of dollars in Iranian assets the United States froze a decade ago.
   President Bush said Tuesday the assets, which include arms and
military equipment ordered before the fundamentalist Shiite
revolution, could not be linked to the hostage issue. Sixteen
Western captives are held in Lebanon, including eight Americans.
   Kayhan, another Iranian daily, said Wednesday that Iran would
rather ``wash its hands'' of its assets than compromise its
``ideological principles,'' the official Islamic Republic News
Agency reported.
   It quoted Abrar as saying: ``Iran has repeatedly announced its
readiness to exert its influence ... to help solve the hostage
issue in response to any sign of goodwill by the West.''
   The four Iranians are believed to have been killed when they
disappeared in 1982.
   President Hashemi Rafsanjani is seen as a pragmatist who wants
improved relations with the West as a means of getting help to
rebuild from the eight-year war with Iraq. He is opposed by the
radical faction of Interior Minister Ali Akbar Mohtashemi, to which
compromise with the West is anathema.
   In the past, Rafsanjani has linked hostage releases the three
Iranians and a Lebanese driver with an Iranian passport who were
kidnapped by Christian militiamen in north Lebanon in July 1982.
   All four are believed dead. Iran Iran wants the case
investigated and publicized to show it, too, has been a victim of
kidnappers.
   Israel kidnapped Sheik Abdul Karim Obeid, 33, from his home in
southern Lebanon on July 28. It has offered to trade him and the
estimated 300-400 Shiite prisoners it holds for three 3 Israeli
soldiers held in Lebanon and the Western hostages.

<HEAD>Joint Britain-Soviet Balloon Flight Planned</HEAD>

<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   As Britain and the Soviet Union work toward a
joint space venture, two veteran pilots plan to link the two
countries the old-fashioned way: by balloon.
   Don Cameron, a record-breaking balloon pilot, said Wednesday he
will team up with Lt. Gen. Gherman Titov for the 1,400-mile trip
from Bristol in southwest England, across the North Sea, Denmark,
southern Sweden and the Baltic Sea to Leningrad.
   Titov, 53, was the backup man for Yuri Gagarin, the first man in
space on April 12, 1961, and Titov became the world's first
multiple-orbit astronaut by circling the Earth 17 times in the
spaceship Vostok 2 on Aug. 6-7, 1961.
   ``We're not trying to give the world a political message for
doing our flight,'' said Cameron, 50. ``It's just an interesting
sporting objective.
   ``I'm one of the world's great cowards, so we have tried to
remove as much of the risk as possible,'' he added. ``But it's
quite a long flight, a lot of it over the sea.''
   Depending on the weather, the flight will begin as early as the
second week of September, and is expected to take four days.
   The two men will travel beneath the 60,000-cubic-foot hot air
balloon in a bright yellow, 100-pound gondola bristling with
satellite navigational equipment and radios to communicate with
Cameron's home base in Bristol, a Soviet base and air traffic
controllers.
   Titov, who at 25 was the youngest person in space, was selected
by the Soviets from among 200 volunteers for the balloon flight.
   A similar process of weeding through volunteers was undertaken
to select Britain's first cosmonaut for an eight-day mission to the
Soviet space station Mir in 1991. Medical tests on 150 finalists
began Monday.
   Cameron has yet to meet his copilot.
   ``Titov has a tremendous amount of experience in many things,
but probably not ballooning,'' he said. ``I'll take over for the
takeoff and landing, which are the tricky bits. Control in the air
is fairly easy.
   ``I've been learning little scraps of Russian. I don't know what
Titov's English is like, but I'm sure we'll get by.''
   Non-stop gas balloon flights between Western Europe and Russia
last took place around the turn of the century when Count Henry de
la Vaulx made several flights from Paris. In 1900, he smashed the
long-distance balloon record by floating 1,193 miles from Paris to
Korosticheff in Russia.
   Cameron claims to be the first balloonist to cross the Sahara
Desert and the Swiss Alps in the early 1970s. He lost out on the
first successful trans-Atlantic helium balloon crossing when his
craft ditched 108 miles off the western French coast. Weeks later,
in July 1978, an American team set the record.
   A balloon designer and manufacturer, Cameron approached Soviet
authorities two years ago and got the OK for his West-East
adventure in July 1988.
   A balloon factory that has since opened in Moscow will begin
turning out Cameron-designed balloons by the end of the year to be
used to carry tourists on sightseeing trips over historical sites
in the Soviet Union, he said.
   Later on Wednesday, a second British-Soviet balloon venture was
announced by Thunder and Colt, a British balloon manufacturer.
   The company said it is building a hot air balloon for a flight
from its headquarters at Oswestry, Shropshire, to Minsk. No date
has been set for the flight, which is still seeking financial
sponsorship, said Chris Kirby, the company's marketing director.
   The Thunder and Colt balloon would be flown by two British
businessmen, Oliver Holmes and Richard Barr, the company said.

   As grave robbers go, Grandison Harris was
pretty good.
   Purchased as a slave in 1852 by the Medical College of Georgia,
Harris was a ``resurrection man,'' who dug up new graves in black
cemeteries, cracked open the crude wooden coffins, bagged the
contents and delivered them to the medical college for dissection
by students.
   A century after a law change that made the craft obsolete,
Harris' handiwork is coming to light as workers renovate the
basement of the old medical college building.
   This week, about 40 boxes of bones from 19th century dissections
were taken to Atlanta to be studied at Georgia State University for
insights on the health, nutrition and lifestyles of Georgians in
the 1800s. Campus officials are unsure how many bodies are in the
boxes.
   Student volunteers also collected coins, buttons, bottles,
surgical instruments, test tubes and clothing from the earthen
basement of the 1835 building.
   ``I can think of no other archaeological find in the U.S.
remotely like it,'' said Robert L. Blakely, a Georgia State
University anthropologist. ``There may be other medical colleges
that have things like this in their cellars, but they haven't been
discovered.''
   Records by George M. Newton, dean of faculty at the college in
the mid-1800s, indicate that grave-robbing was a booming business
until 1887, when the laws changed.
   Grave-robbing was often the only way medical schools could get
around laws that equated human dissection with desecration.
   Newton bought 2,000 gallons of whiskey in the 1850s and made
references to transactions such as, ``Joe for subject, $10.''
   The ``subjects'' were preserved in Newton's whiskey until the
time came for them to provide medical students vital lessons on the
basics of human anatomy.
   The bodies were mostly blacks because ``when you have a large
population of a depressed class, you're going to have fewer
problems robbing their graves than the mayor of Augusta,'' said
Russell R. Moores, a hematologist and historian of the medical
college.
   A manuscript on the resurrection man's career by the late Lane
Allen, a professor of anatomy at the college, recounts how Harris
performed his job, digging into graves by moonlight, smashing the
crude wooden coffins with an ax, removing the ``subject'' and
placing it in a sack, which he carried to the college in a
horse-drawn cart.
   Sometimes, on his return, Harris would stop for a drink.
   One tale recounts how a student once removed the corpse while
Harris was in the saloon and climbed in the sack. He moaned in a
ghostly voice when Harris came back to the cart: ``Grandison, I'm
cold! Buy me a drink.''
   Legend says Harris replied: ``Get your own drink.''
   Harris continued to work for the college after the Civil War
provided his freedom, at a salary of $10 to $15 a month. He retired
as a janitor at the college in 1905 on a pension of $10 a month.
   Blakely said the Georgia State researchers believe the bones
``will cover the entire period the medical college was in that
building, from the 1830s to the early 1900s.''
   Blakely said the remains eventually will be returned to the
medical college, where they will be cremated next spring with the
remains of current dissections and buried with them in an annual
memorial service.

<HEAD>Bomb Kills at Least 12 on Indian Bus</HEAD>

   A bomb blew apart a New Delhi-bound bus
near this northern town Wednesday, killing at least 12 people and
injuring 35, police said.
   No one took responsibility for the attack. However, Sikh
militants trying to form an independent state have planted many
such bombs in the past.
   Authorities said they believed a time bomb was used in the
attack.
   The blast tore through the state-owned bus two miles outside
Karnal in the northern state of Haryana, Press Trust of India news
agency said.
   ``I thought it was a head-on collision with another bus,'' said
passenger O.P. Lal, who was treated for shock. ``Then I saw doors
and window blown apart.''
   It was not known how many people were on the bus, which normally
carries at least 60 passengers.
   Nine people were killed in the blast and three others died at a
hospital in Karnal, said police inspector Rajinder Singh. The Press
Trust of India said 18 people were killed.
   The bus, traveling from the resort town of Kasauli to New Delhi,
was just entering Karnal, about 95 miles north of New Delhi.
   ``If the explosion occurred five minutes later, the bus would
have been in the middle of Karnal and scores of people would have
died,'' said police inspector Mehar Lal.
   The bomb probably was put on board at Ambala, about 25 miles
north of Karnal, where the bus had stopped for a few minutes, he
said.
   ``Four passengers got off there,'' he said. ``Also, the journey
from Ambala (to Karnal) is about an hour, and most of these time
bombs are set for 60 minutes,'' Lal said.
   Sikh militants launched a campaign in 1982 to set up an
independent nation in Punjab, where Sikhs hold a slight majority
over Hindus.
   The violence has been largely concentrated there, but the
militants have mounted periodic attacks in nearby states and New
Delhi.
   At least 1,116 people have been killed by Sikh radicals in
Punjab so far this year, according to police reports.
   On Tuesday, three Sikh militants killed six people when they
sprayed gunfire on a crowd leaving a movie theater in Jammy, a city
in Jammu-Kashmir neighboring the Punjab, authorities said.
   The army was called out as a precautionary measure Wednesday and
an indefinite curfew imposed there, city commissioner Vijay Bakaya
said.
   Many Sikhs, who make up 2 percent of India's 880 million people,
say they have been discriminated against by the nation's 82 percent
Hindu majority.

   Gerald Winsett, a small-town principal
who has paddled hundreds of kids for discipline in 24 years as an
educator, was shocked when he opened a letter and read he is on
Florida's child abuser list.
   He will appeal, but if unsuccessful, his name will remain for 50
years on the state Child Abuse Registry, which is confidential but
is used for state-required screenings of day-care employees and
other child caretakers.
   ``I'm disappointed that something like this is happening,''
Winsett said in a telephone interview. ``I don't think what I did
was child abuse in any sense and when they say if a mark is left on
24 hours they're going to put you on the list ... that's nonsense.''
   Winsett is among dozens of school administrators put on the
abuser list in what an attorney contends is part of an unofficial
effort by the state Department of Health and Rehabilitative
Services to stop paddling in schools.
   The list contains hundreds of thousands of names of child
abusers and those suspected or accused of child abuse.
   Two unidentified middle school officials from north Florida on
Monday asked the state Supreme Court to review a lower court
decision upholding the state decision to put them on the list
because of paddlings administered in 1987. The court is in recess
until Aug. 31.
   The lower court's 2-1 decision in April conflicts with
comparable rulings elsewhere in Florida that a bruise alone is
insufficient evidence that a paddling has degenerated into abuse,
according to Ron Meyer, general counsel to the Florida Teaching
Profession-National Education Association.
   ``But for the existence of a bruise (in the north Florida cases)
there would be no indication of excessive force,'' Meyer said
Tuesday.
   The state HRS department denies Meyer's allegation that it is
singling out educators in its investigations.
   ``We don't have a position on corporal punishment,'' Steve
Konicki, an HRS spokesman, said. ``We do have a position on
injury.''
   Until this year, state statute required local school districts
to include paddling as a disciplinary option. Earlier this spring,
however, lawmakers agreed to leave the decision at the local level.
Since Gov. Bob Martinez signed the legislation in late June, at
least seven districts have banned paddling.
   Winsett, principal of Stambaugh Middle School in the central
Florida town of Auburndale and an administrator for 16 years, said
he has never been a strong advocate of paddling but that many
parents in his area support it as a disciplinary measure. He said
he has paddled hundreds of youngsters.
   A day or two after he paddled a teen-age boy who had gotten into
trouble repeatedly, an HRS investigator asked Winsett if he had
paddled the student and asked about bruises left on the student,
Winsett said.
   Weeks later, Winsett received a certified letter in June and
found out that his name had been added to the list of confirmed
child abuse cases.
   ``That was ridiculous,'' he said. ``I just don't understand how
anybody can do that in this country ... without a trial or anything.
   ``I thought every man was innocent until proven guilty. I never
had a hearing, but when I get the letter it says I'm a child
abuser,'' Winsett said.
   Meyer said Tuesday that Florida's school administrators are
frightened by an HRS trend he says began in mid-1987.
   ``It's had a real chilling effect,'' he said. ``It's a severe
penalty to be labeled a child abuser.''
   But Konicki said that only educators who go too far have any
need for concern.
   ``Teachers in general don't feel under siege by HRS,'' he said.
   Meyer estimated that 50 to 60 school employees throughout
Florida are trying to remove their names from the registry. At
least 10 exhausted administrative avenues and went to the courts.
None of those cases was pursued by police, prosecutors or state
licensing officials, he said.
   Konicki said bruising is only one indicator of excessive force
and added that it's rare that a teacher is confirmed as a child
abuser. In cases where it is confirmed, ``the bruises were not
incidental but (were) severe deep bruises,'' he said.
   ``There are dozens and hundreds of teachers around this state
that administer corporal punishment in a way that does not batter
children,'' Konicki said.
   Wayne Wallace, senior human services specialist for HRS, agreed.
   ``Every child bruises differently than any other child,''
Wallace said. ``What the investigator has to determine is whether
or not that bruise is the result of excessive corporal punishment.''

   Ringo Starr's career had fallen from the heights
of Beatlemania to ``its lowest ebb'' when he asked producer Chips
Moman to salvage it with an album the drummer now is trying to keep
out of stores, Moman's attorney says.
   Moman wants to put out the album, recorded more than two years
ago but never released, to coincide with Starr's current U.S.
concert tour. The former Beatle says he's unhappy with his drumming
on the recordings and the release could hurt his reputation.
   Release of the album was temporarily blocked last month by
Fulton County Superior Court Judge Clarence Cooper. A hearing on
Starr's suit against Moman and a College Park record company is
scheduled Aug. 22.
   Starr came to Moman in 1987 to rescue his sagging career,
according to a counterclaim filed this week by an attorney for the
Memphis, Tenn., producer. The two agreed to make three albums,
according to Moman.
   ``When plaintiff Starr sought out defendant Moman, plaintiff's
career was at a standstill and at its lowest ebb,'' the
counterclaim said. ``Plaintiff, like others before him, sought out
defendant to salvage his career as an artist.
   ``Moman agreed to help, but in return expected an album which
would produce a profit,'' the document said. ``Moman is not now nor
was he at the time of the fi everything else which is automated is working
fine,'' he
said.
   In a statement Wednesday, the AFL-CIO urged the public, union
members and their families not to pay their phone bills until the
strikes at Bell Atlantic, NYNEX and Pacific Telesis are settled.
   The resolution was passed Tuesday by the AFL-CIO Executive
Council, according to a statement.
   Web Chamberlain, spokesman for Chesapeake and Potomac Telephone
Co. in Washington, said the company wants to end the walkout. ``We
want the employees back. We want to settle this issue, so anything
that gives us an indication that we're moving towards that
direction is a positive thing.''
   Frank Just, a C&amp;P spokesman in Baltimore, added, ``We think
(Tuesday's) meeting was a step in the right direction, and we are
looking forward to our next session. ...''
   Just says Thursday's meeting would also be held in Washington.

   A suicide bomber attacked an Israeli
convoy in south Lebanon on Wednesday, wounding six people in what
the pro-Iranian Hezbollah called a ``down payment'' for Israel's
abduction of a Shiite Moslem cleric.
   Hezbollah said a Shiite clergyman drove the explosives-laden
pickup truck.
   It also said the seizure of Sheik Abdul Karim Obeid hampered
efforts to free the 16 Western captives in Lebanon, eight of whom
are Americans. Hezbollah is believed to be an umbrella organization
for groups holding most of the hostages.
   In Washington, President Bush promised to pursue every
diplomatic channel to win freedom for te American hostages, but
said there would be no ``trading off or negotiating.''
   A Tehran newspaper said Iran would help free hostages if Israel
released Obeid and if four Iranians missing in Lebanon since 1982,
believed long dead, were located. On Tuesday, another Tehran paper
said Iran would help if Washington released $2 billion in Iranian
assets frozen a decade ago when the U.S. Embassy was seized.
   Sheik Mohammed Hussein Fadlallah, spiritual adviser of
Hezbollah, said of the bombing: ``We tell Israel this is a down
payment. Much more will follow.''
   Hezbollah, whose name means Party of God, said the suicide
bomber was Sheik Asaad Birro, a 24-year-old Lebanese Shiite cleric
from the Bekaa Valley. Israel said two people were in the pickup,
which exploded at midmorning in the buffer zone the Israelis
control just north of the border.
   Five Israeli soldiers and a member of the allied South Lebanon
Army militia were reported wounded.
   Uri Lubrani, Israel's coordinator for south Lebanon, said on
Middle East Television the Israelis would retaliate, but did not
say when or how.
   ``Israel will deal with the Hezbollah as it deals with all the
organizations which threaten the normal life of the security
zone,'' he said. ``Violence has two edges and Israel will retaliate
in one way or another ... in due time, in a place it will choose.''
   Sheik Sobhi Tofaili, another Hezbollah leader, said there would
be more attacks and the seizure of Obeid would ``mushroom into an
explosive volcano in the face of Israel.''
   Israeli commandos abducted Obeid, 33, and two aides from the
southern Lebanon village of Jibchit on July 28. Israel has offered
to trade him and its estimated 300-400 Shiite prisoners for three
Israeli soldiers held in Lebanon and the Western hostages.
   A statement released by the Hezbollah information center
described the seizure of Obeid, who was affiliated with the
organization, as a ``terrorist crime of piracy.''
   It reiterated previous rejections of the Israeli exchange
proposal. Israel has urged hostage-holding factions to negotiate a
trade through the international Red Cross.
   ``The Zionist enemy has suffered a bitter dismay because of his
failure to achieve his objectives from the crime of abducting Sheik
Abdul Karim Obeid,'' the Hezbollah statement said.
   ``It is clear that things have backfired adversely on the enemy
after this foolish crime. It has become impossible to release the
Israeli POWs and all ways for a possible swap have been blocked.
   ``Moreover, the refusal of the enemy to release Sheik Obeid and
his two relatives, and his linkage of the problem of the Zionist
POWs with that of the hostages, might hurt the West and further
complicate the hostage issue.''
   The statement said ``efforts for the release of the Western
hostages in Lebanon are passing through their greatest setback
because of the foolhardiness committed by the racist Zionists who
appear perfectly willing to sacrifice all others for their selfish
interests.''
   Hezbollah said the West should force Israel to free Obeid, and
described Israel's claims about statements the cleric made under
interrogation as ``false and misleading.''
   Officials in Israel have said Obeid confessed under
interrogation to helping plan attacks on Israel and the abduction
Feb. 17, 1988 of Lt. Col. William R. Higgins while he was on U.N.
duty in south Lebanon.
   Higgins' captors said they hanged the U.S. Marine officer July
31 in retaliation for Obeid's abduction.
   His wife and the FBI say they believe Higgins is dead, but the
question of when he died has not been resolved. Some reports say he
was killed last year.
   A police spokesman in Beirut said the car bombing was reported
at 9:30 a.m. (2:30 a.m. EDT) on a road near the Christian towns of
Marjayoun and Qleiaa, both 5 miles north of the Israeli border.
   Israeli soldiers and the allied South Lebanon Army, a
predominantly Christian militia, patrol the zone, which varies in
depth from about 6 to 10 miles.
   Two jeeps, a tank, two armored personnel carriers and a
halftrack made up the Israeli convoy, Hezbollah said.
   It released a color photograph of a Birro, the suicide driver,
behind a desk flanked by flags of Hezbollah and Iran. Behind him
were a poster of Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini and Ali Khamenei, who
became Iran's spiritual leader after Khomeini died in June.
   Hezbollah said the attack was carried out to ``declare our
loyalty to the path of Imam Khomeini and his successor Ayatollah
Khamenei.''

<HEAD>Government Says Guerrillas Violating Moslem Ban on Killing</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By EDITH M. LEDERER</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>KABUL, Afghanistan (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government said Wednesday that
Moslem guerrillas were violating Islamic law by killing civilians
with rocket attacks during the current holy month.
   Foreign Ministry spokesman Mohammad Nabi Amani criticized the
guerrillas for calling themselves mujahedeen, or Islamic holy
warriors, while rocketing the capital during the month of Muharram.
   ``They claim to be the advocates of Islam and they pay no heed
to these holy days, and they fire rockets on civilian targets and
houses and they claim they are trying to kill communists,'' he said.
   Amani said Moslems mourning the death of a grandson of the
prophet Mohammed during this month are not permitted to kill other
Moslems.
   However, Moslems always are under a religious ban against
killing other Moslems.
   Rockets have been crashing into Kabul almost daily since late
June. The Soviet-backed Marxist government blames the guerrillas
for the attacks.
   Most of the rockets have struck civilian areas. At least 281
people have been killed and 745 injured in the rocket attacks and a
car bombing, according to U.N. sources.
   On Wednesday, no rockets were reported to have hit Kabul.
Intermittent thuds from government artillery could be heard,
however, and missiles heading for targets outside the capital could
be seen flashing across the sky.
   Amani said the guerrillas killed 16 civilians in a rocket
barrage late Tuesday.
   One of 10 rockets hit a military weapons and ammunition depot in
northwest Kabul, setting off a chain reaction of explosions that
lasted for 3{ hours.
   U.N. sources said one man who lived about 500 yards away was
killed.
   Amani said 1,200 people were evacuated from the area, but he
said the 16 casualties he reported were caused by rockets that hit
elsewhere.
   In other military action over the previous 24 hours, air force
planes destroyed a 1{-mile guerrilla arms convoy in Logar province
south of Kabul, Amani said. He said trucks that tried to return to
Pakistan, where the most powerful rebel forces are headquartered,
were also destroyed.
   Amani had no further details, and the report could not be
independently confirmed.

   City money won't go to groups other
than health clinics serving illegal aliens in an effort to
discourage the immigrants from coming to Costa Mesa, the City
Council decided.
   The council agreed Tuesday to withhold funds from such groups as
Boys and Girls Club, the South Orange County YMCA, The Feedback
Foundation and Opera Pacific.
   Councilman Orville Amburgey said the city has become a mecca for
illegal aliens taking advantage of the assistance programs.
   ``We did some checking and found out the `coyotes' who guide
illegal immigrants into the United States are telling them that if
they come to Costa Mesa they can get employment, food, shelter and
clothing,'' Amburgey said.
   The 3-2 vote for the measure drew immediate criticism.
   ``It is ill-advised, ill-conceived and very imprudent,'' said
Rev. Jaime Soto of the Orange County Coalition for Immigrant
Rights. ``It is really undue government interference into the
affairs of voluntary agencies. It seems a very uncivic spirit that
motivates the policy.''
   The city gave more than $266,000 in Community Development Block
Grant funds and general revenue sharing funds to 30 organizations
last year, the city manager's office said.
   Council member Mary Hornbuckle, who voted against the decision,
said many non-profit agencies' budgets leave little room for
expenditures to screen clients.
   ``This will certainly create another headache,'' said attorney
Rebecca Jurado of the American Civil Liberties Union. ``It seems to
be another tactic to get rid of illegal immigrants, and is clearly
going to be discriminatory.''

<HEAD>Kaifu Chosen New Prime Minister, Works at Regaining Public Support</HEAD>

<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Governing party leader Toshiki Kaifu became prime
minister Wednesday after an unprecedented battle in parliament, and
he immediately began trying to build public support by naming two
women to the Cabinet.
   Women voters, angry over a new sales tax and a sex scandal
involving Kaifu's predecessor, were seen as a major factor in the
Liberal Democratic Party's poor showing in parliamentary elections
July 23.
   In that vote, the Liberal Democrats lost their majority in the
upper house for the first time in their 34-year history.
   The opposition Socialists delayed Kaifu's election by supporting
Socialist Party leader Takako Doi on Wednesday. The Liberal
Democrats hold a majority in the more powerful lower house, which
chose Kaifu. Under the constitution, the lower house decision
prevailed.
   It was the first time in 41 years the chambers had clashed over
leadership of the government.
   ``Today, the door was only half opened, but I am determined to
continue to work to fully open this door some day,'' said Ms. Doi.
   Socialist Secretary-General Tsuruo Yamaguchi told The Associated
Press that ``politically, the upper house vote has proven that this
administration is only half an administration, and Kaifu is only
half a prime minister.''
   Kaifu told reporters the upper house's move was a ``severe
consequence of our election defeat'' July 23.
   ``There are many difficulties awaiting the Liberal Democratic
Party, and I will try to work hard and express my frank feelings to
the people,'' he said.
   Kaifu became Japan's third prime minister in 10 weeks. Noboru
Takeshita resigned in June to take responsibility for an
influence-peddling scandal involving the Recruit Co. conglomerate.
   His replacement, Sousuke Uno, stepped down after 69 days amid
allegations he kept paid mistresses.
   Kaifu, 58, considered a reform-minded politician, was chosen to
lead the party's rebuilding efforts because of his relative youth
and non-involvement in the Recruit scandal, which tainted most
senior leaders. He was chosen party leader Tuesday.
   Kaifu has acknowledged receiving about $110,000 in political
donations from Recruit but said they were legal.
   The company has been accused of giving political donations and
selling bargain-priced stock to leading politicians in exchange for
political favors.
   Kaifu was elected only to fill the remaining three months of
Takeshita's original term. Whether he can keep the post after
October depends on how well he can establish a power base and
brighten the party's image.
   In addition to lacking his own power base in the party, Kaifu, a
former education minister, has little experience in the crucial
areas of foreign affairs and finance.
   The 20-member Cabinet was carefully crafted to distribute posts
among major party factions controlled by senior Liberal Democrats,
despite Kaifu's comment Tuesday that factions are ``an evil.''
   His new Cabinet includes the first woman non-politician to serve
as a government minister _ Sumiko Takahara, an economics specialist
who became head of the Economic Planning Agency. Another woman,
lawmaker Mayumi Moriyama, will head the Environment Agency.
   Eiji Suzuki, head of the Japan Federation of Employers'
Associations, told Kyodo that two women in the Cabinet would
contribute significantly to the revitalization of the party.
   Homemakers were particularly incensed at the 3 percent sales tax
passed in April.
   Five Cabinet posts went to the largest party faction, controlled
by Takeshita, and four each to the next three largest factions.
   Ryutaro Hashimoto, most recently the Liberal Democrats'
secretary-general, was named finance minister, while Hikaru
Matsunaga, a former prosecutor, was given the important post of
international trade minister.
   Taro Nakayama, a former doctor, was named foreign minister, and
former Transport Minister Tokuo Yamashita was named chief Cabinet
secretary, the main government spokesman.
   Ichiro Ozawa was named the new party secretary-general, and
Shunjiro Karasawa became the new chairman of the party's
decision-making Executive Council. Both have acknowledged receiving
legal donations from Recruit.
   Opposition politicians reveled in the upper house rejection of
Kaifu, calling on the Liberal Democrats to dissolve the lower house
for new elections and scrap the new sales tax.
   Business leaders, who traditionally support the Liberal
Democrats, urged the party to push forward with reforms.

   Robert Ray Adkins has carried the mail
for 31 years, and even his wife's illness couldn't keep him away
from a ceremony Wednesday for the centennial of the the National
Association of Letter Carriers.
   Adkins, 56, and Charleston letter carrier Terri Lynn Page
delivered a 3-by-5-foot postcard to the ceremony outside the
downtown post office.
   Stamps have been affixed at each of the 47 states where the
postcard has been canceled, and it will be sent via Express Mail to
the remaining states, ending up in Wisconsin on Aug. 30, the 100th
anniversary of the founding of the postal workers' union in
Milwaukee.
   Adkins' wife of 40 years, Audrey Faye, entered St. Francis
Hospital on Wednesday for cancer treatment, but he said she
insisted that he attend the ceremony.
   ``She didn't want me to miss it,'' Adkins said. ``I've been with
her since she was 16.''
   Adkins, whose route includes downtown Charleston, says one of
the biggest changes since he began work has been the amount of mail.
   ``There's a lot more mail to be delivered _ I'd say at least
triple,'' he said. ``There's heavier volume _ more magazines, more
bulk business rate, which we have to have to stay alive.
   ``They told me 20 years ago it would be like this. That's why I
never slowed down.''
   The Chesapeake, Ohio, native said he and seven of his eight
brothers served in the armed forces and went to work for the
federal government.
   ``I just love being in uniform,'' he said.
   He doesn't even mind working in bad weather.
   ``I kind of enjoy it,'' he said. ``I get used to it _ even the
rain. I put a cape on and look like Batman. People splash me,
though. I think they want to see me duck under that cape.''

   Israeli troops shot and killed a man and child
in a Palestinian refugee camp Wednesday during demonstrations
marking 20 months of the Arab rebellion, hospital officials said.
   A third Arab was found dead, and Arab reports said he was killed
by Israeli settlers.
   The deaths raised to 533 the number of Palestinians killed by
Israeli soldiers or settlers since the uprising began in the
occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip in December 1987. Thirty-eight
Israelis have died in the violence.
   Officials at Shifa Hospital in Gaza City said 6-year-old Yousef
Ghazi Salameh and 23-year-old Ziad Mohammed Bannat were shot to
death during daylong clashes in the Gaza Strip's Shati refugee camp.
   Hospital officials said Salameh was shot in the heart and quoted
the boy's family as saying a soldier on a rooftop had fired at him.
Bannat died later of gunshot wounds to the stomach and chest, the
officials said.
   The army spokesman's office confirmed Salameh's death but said
he was 8. The office said Bannat's body was taken from the hospital
for burial before the army could confirm the cause of death and
that it was checking further.
   Arab hospital reports said at least 19 Palestinians were wounded
in Shati. Four other Palestianians were wounded elsewhere in the
territories in clashes with Israeli troops, Arab reports said.
   The army confirmed five wounded and said it was checking other
reports.
   The riots at Shati occurred as Palestinians throughout the
occupied lands mounted a general strike to mark the end of the 20th
month of their uprising against Israeli occupation. The territories
were captured from Jordan and Egypt in the 1967 Middle East war.
   Shops and offices were closed, and public transportation was
shut down.
   A nurse in the West Bank city of Hebron said the body of
17-year-old Nidal Ibrahim Mesk was found on a major city
thoroughfare near the Ansar Mosque. He had been shot twice in the
head, the nurse said.
   Arab reporters said Mesk and several friends had been throwing
stones at passing Israeli vehicles, including a state-run passenger
bus and a car carrying Jewish settlers. Passengers from the bus
opened fire as the youths fled, one of the youths told reporters.
   Also Wednesday, an Israeli infant died from wounds suffered in
an exchange of gunfire between his father and soldiers, officials
at Tel Aviv's Tel Hashomer Hospital said.
   The army said troops accidentally shot 19-month-old Itai
Hamtzani on Tuesday night after his father, a West Bank Jewish
settler, opened fire on an army patrol in a grove of trees.
   Israel radio said 30-year-old Daniel Hamtzani fired because he
thought the soldiers were Palestinians lighting a firebomb.
   The father and a second son, 4-year-old Ordan, were wounded, the
army said.

<HEAD>U.S. Economy Growing at Slower Pace</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The U.S. economy is still growing but at a
slower pace, the Federal Reserve said Wednesday in a report
economists interpreted as an indication the central bank had room
to cut interest rates further.
   In a survey of economic conditions around the country, the Fed
found that the ``nation's economy continues to grow slowly'' with
weak auto sales, generally sluggish consumer spending and some
declines in manufacturing output.
   The slowdown this year was caused in part by a yearlong battle
waged by the Fed to drive interest rates higher as a way of
dampening demand and cooling off inflationary pressures.
   The Fed switched course in June, however, and began nudging
interest rates lower in an effort to keep the economy out of a
recession.
   Many analysts interpreted the Fed's new economic survey as an
indication that the central bank, while not overly worried about an
imminent economic downturn, was ready to lower interest rates
further if the economy showed continued weakness.
   ``This report says that the Fed believes the economy is slowing
down but there is no imminent danger of a recession and inflation
doesn't look like as big a problem as it did a few months ago,''
said David Wyss, an economist with DRI-McGraw Hill.
   Wyss said that while the Fed would ease interest rates further
in coming months, ``they are not in a big hurry to do it.''
   Michael Evans, head of a Washington forecasting firm, noted that
the bond market initially sagged when the report was released
because traders had been anticipating a gloomier Fed assessment of
growth prospects. Evans said he believed the Fed will still be
pushing interest rates lower in coming months but only as
inflationary pressures abate.
   ``The economic reports and this outlook suggest that the Fed's
soft landing has been achieved,'' said Evans. The central bank has
been trying to slow the economy enough to dampen inflationary
pressures without toppling the country into a downturn.
   Fed interest rate decisions are made by the 12-member Federal
Open Market Committee, composed of members of the Fed board and the
presidents of five of the 12 regional banks. The policy-makers meet
eight times a year, with the next session scheduled for Aug. 22.
   To prepare for those meetings, the Fed surveys the regional
banks about economic conditions in their areas. Wednesday's report,
known inside the Fed as the ``beige book,'' is the latest
compilation of those views.
   The report said retail sales were generally sluggish nationwide,
with auto sales below last year's levels everywhere except Texas, a
state where car sales have increased sharply. About the only
strength nationwide in consumer spending over the summer has come
in sales of women's clothing, the report said.
   Manufacturing activity varied from region to region with Federal
Reserve banks in Boston, New York and Cleveland reporting sluggish
growth in new orders.
   Dallas and San Francisco reported weakness in orders for
electronic components, while the Chicago and St. Louis regions
reported some layoffs and plant closings related to cutbacks in
auto production.
   Lumber sales were being bolstered by foreign demand in the
Richmond and Dallas Fed districts, but logging restrictions were
hurting lumber producers in the Pacific Northwest and North Central
regions.
   Farmers were expecting good harvests in many parts of the nation
but weather conditions were causing scattered problems, such as
excess rain hurting production in the South and a drought in North
Dakota likely lowering wheat yields in that state, the report said.

Role</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Premier Hun Sen met Wednesday with a
U.N. delegation and rejected a U.N. role in resolving the Cambodian
war until the world body stops backing the guerrilla resistance.
   The pro-Vietnamese leader and more than a dozen Cabinet
ministers and military chiefs held two hours of talks with the
team, sent by an international conference in Paris on Cambodia.
   The team arrived Monday to gather technical information for the
possible formation of an international body to monitor the
Vietnamese troop withdrawal and a proposed truce. Vietnam has
promised to pull all of its troops from Cambodia by the end of
September.
   After the talks, Hun Sen told reporters his government was
helping the team because it did not want to block the peace
process. He said this did not mean his government had accepted a
U.N. role in the process.
   ``We cannot accept the role of the United Nations if the United
Nations continues to accept the role (of the Khmer Rouge) in any
political issue of Cambodia,'' he said.
   ``We shall study the role of the U.N. if the U.N. leaves the
Cambodian seat vacant,'' he said.
   The Khmer Rouge is the largest group in the three-party
guerrilla coalition that holds Cambodia's seat in the United
Nations.
   Hun Sen said he rejected a guerrilla offer that the Phnom Penh
government share the seat with the guerrillas.
   ``I said that I cannot sit on the bloodied seat of Democratic
Kampuchea,'' he said, using the name of the resistance government.
   The Paris talks, which opened July 30, have not produced
substantial progress because Hun Sen rejects guerrilla demands that
the Khmer Rouge be included in a transitional government.
   The Khmer Rouge killed hundreds of thousands of Cambodians
before Vietnam invaded in late 1978, ousted it from power, and
installed the current Phnom Penh government.
   The 15-member U.N. team, led by Lt. Gen. Martin O. Datset of
Norway, is to visit about eight provinces during its weeklong tour.
   On Wednesday, the team visited northeastern Stung Treng
province. On Tuesday, it inspected what is expected to be a major
route for Vietnam's pullout, Highway No. 1 from Phnom Penh to
Vietnam's southern Ho Chi Minh City, formerly Saigon.
   The team includes experts in aviation, communications,
engineering and other fields. They said the task of monitoring the
pullout and supervising the peace would be complex in such an
undeveloped country.
   Wing Cmdr. Greg Weekes, an aviation expert from Australia, noted
Cambodia has few main highways and that many roads are impassable
during the monsoon season.
   Another expert, who requested anonymity, said the scarcity of
telephones and other communications would make it difficult to
report truce violations.
   He said the monitoring body must be much larger than the several
hundred members suggested by Hun Sen if the predominantly jungle
war is to be kept in check.

   A convicted killer said he was depressed
when he won a reprieve from Florida's electric chair and ``can
hardly wait'' for his execution.
   ``I do not have a death wish,'' James William Hamblen said. ``I
would say I don't care about living as distinguished from I want to
die.''
   ``I can hardly wait to sit in Old Sparky (the electric chair).
I'm curious about it,'' Hamblen, 60, said in an interview Tuesday
with The Florida Times-Union at Florida State Prison.
   Hamblen was condemned for the 1984 shooting death of Laureen
Jean Edwards during a robbery at her lingerie store. He was
sentenced to death after firing his public defender and pleading
guilty. He also admitted an earlier murder in Texas.
   ``I'm not the least bit concerned about electrocution. I think
it's spiffy,'' Hamblen said.
   ``If you've got to go _ why not? It's better than AIDS, better
than cancer of the colon, better than slipping into senility day by
day. I can think of a lot more ways I'd rather not die,'' he said.
   Hamblen said he was ``let down'' when public defenders won an
indefinite stay from the U.S. Supreme Court on July 18 just five
hours before he was to be strapped into the electric chair.
   Hamblen denied he was legally insane or incompetent, as defense
lawyers maintained.
   ``I might be wacko ... but within the legal definition, I'm
completely confident I know what I'm doing,'' Hamblen said.
   The inmate said he could commit suicide in his cell if he wanted
to, but doesn't want to. He said the problem with suicide is that
people think the victim is unable to cope with life.
   ``I just don't care to cope,'' he said.
   Hamblen served seven years in the Marines and saw combat duty in
Korea before he was dishonorably discharged in 1953. He was married
and divorced and spent 20 years in prison on rape and burglary
convictions before his release in 1978.
   Hamblen said he returned to crime in 1984 when he killed a woman
he described as a ``beer-drinking buddy'' in Texas. He was fleeing
the murder charge when he robbed Mrs. Edwards' store.

   About 100 bystanders appaluded police who

   ``I was concerned at first that they were going to get unruly.
But instead, they applauded when we brought the suspects out,''

   ``The neighbors were happy to see us doing something about the
suspected operation. I believe the house was perceived as a menace

   County detectives and state police with guns drawn Tuesday night
surrounded the home of Alan P. Jakes, 29, and his wife, Christine,
25. The officers scaled a 6-foot electronic fence and broke through
a steel door with a sledgehammer.
   Police said they confiscated cash, four cars, loaded weapons,
more than 4 ounces of suspected cocaine, one-fourth ounce of
suspected marijuana, and drug paraphernalia.
   The Jakes and three other people were jailed on drug charges
under $250,000 bail each.

valuables from his Providence home, including his late wife's
diamond engagement ring.
   He had $5,000 cash at the cottage because ``after everything
that had happened, I just wanted to have it with me.'' But the
burglar who struck his cottage Saturday found it.
   Paniccia's new car was take twice and recovered by police twice.
Police said they had no suspects in the Providence break-in, but
would check fingerprints on the car against those of a 17-year-old
inmate at the state Training School who ran away from a beach
outing Friday and returned Sunday with $4,250 he asked authorities
to hold for him in a safe.

   The former commander of the Navy vessel
that shot down an Iranian airliner last year paid tribute Wednesday
to Marine Lt. Col. William R. Higgins, who was taken hostage in
Lebanon and is believed dead.
   Capt. Will C. Rogers, during a dedication ceremony for a
monument to the USS Vincennes, called Higgins and his wife, Robin,
``comrades in arms, American heroes and friends who exemplify the
Marine Corps motto, `Always Faithful,' whatever the cost.''
   ``Those costs, which recently (were) demonstrated, can be
brutally harsh,'' Rogers said at the dedication of the USS
Vincennes Memorial Monument near the banks of the Wabash River.
   On Tuesday, Mrs. Higgins acknowledged ``a virtual certainty''
that her husband had been killed by his captors.
   Rogers ended his two-year command of the current USS Vincennes
on May 27 without apology for the cruiser's mistaken destruction of
the Iranian airliner on July 3, 1988. All 290 aboard the jet died.
   He currently is commanding officer of Tactical Training
Group-Pacific headquartered in San Diego.
   The dedication was held as part of the USS Vincennes
Association's 16th annual reunion in this southern Indiana city.
The association, which paid for half of the monument, is made up of
men who have served on one of the four ships that have taken their
name from the Revolutionary War battle fought at Vincennes.
   Private donations also were used in building the $36,000
monument on land owned by the National Part Service.
   The first USS Vincennes was a wooden sloop-of-war which was in
commission from 1826 to 1867. The second ship, a heavy cruiser, was
commissioned in 1937 and sunk by Japanese gunfire off Savo Island,
about 10 miles from Guadalcanal Island, on Aug. 9, 1942. The third
USS Vincennes, a light cruiser, was commissioned in 1944, fought in
the Okinawa campaign and survived World War II.

<TEXT>
   Panamanian military authorities
arrested two American soldiers at Fort Amador on Wednesday but they
were later released after U.S. troops then blocked the entrance to
the area, U.S. offiicals said.
   Army Maj. Kathy Wood, a Pentagon spokeswoman, said a U.S.
military policeman was detained by members of the Panamanian
Defense Forces around 11 a.m. in the Fort Amador area, where Gen.
Manuel Antonio Noriega has offices.
   A second military policeman was also detained when he entered
the building where the first soldier was being held, Ms. Wood said.
   The action was in apparent retaliation for the detention by U.S.
authorities of 29 Panamanians, including nine military personnel,
on Tuesday.
   ``U.S. forces secured the entry and exit to Fort Amador. ... Two
PDF personnel on police duty at Fort Amador's front gate were asked
to surrender their weapons, and they did so. They were then taken
into custody by U.S. forces,'' Ms. Wood said.
   Fort Amador is a joint-use area that includes barracks for
Panamanian troops, a building where Noriega has an office, several
Southern Command offices, a U.S. naval station and a golf course
and clubs used by U.S. personnel.
   Sources said Noriega, the de facto leader of Panama and
commander of the Panamanian Defense Forces, was not at his office
in Fort Amador today.
   Ms. Wood said that the two U.S. soldiers were released around
1:40 p.m. EDT, and the PDF personnel were then let go.
   Wood said today's incident did not amount to a violation of the
Panama Canal treaties, under which ``the commander of a military
area of coordination has responsibility for the security of his
area.''
   The U.S. Southern Command said the 29 Panamanians were detained
for one hour and 15 minutes on Tuesday because they entered a
joint-use military area without authorization. The group included
four military officers, one of the Maj. Manuel Sieiro, Noriega's
brother-in-law.
   Weapons taken from the Panamanians will be returned when an
investigation is completed, the Southern Command said. It said the
weapons included four automatic rifles, a machine gun, two grenades
and seven pistols.

   Here are some of the highlights of the savings
and loan industry bailout legislation signed into law by President
Bush on Wednesday:
</TEXT>
<HEAD>COST</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   The bailout will cost an estimated $159 billion through 1999,
including $60.5 billion to meet government obligations incurred in
the rescue of 223 S&amp;Ls in 1988, $74.2 billion to close or merge
more than 500 more S&amp;Ls and $24.4 billion for the government's
share of interest on bonds sold to help pay for the bailout. Over
30 years, costs including interest are estimated at $285 billion _
$157 billion of which will come from tax revenues.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>CAPITAL</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Within four months, S&amp;L owners must have $1.50 in tangible
capital for each $100 in loans. By 1995, the standard will be $3.
The provision is aimed at discouraging risky investments by the
thrift owners. In addition, many of the accounting loopholes that
allowed S&amp;L owners to avoid capital requirements have been closed.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>INSURANCE PREMIUMS</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Both S&amp;Ls and commercial banks will pay more for the government
deposit insurance that protects savers' accounts up to $100,000.
Bank premiums will jump from 8 cents per $100 to 15 cents. S&amp;L
premiums will rise from 20.8 cents to 23 cents.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>FINANCIAL STANDARDS</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   The bill pushes S&amp;Ls back into home mortgage lending and out of
risky investments such as speculative commercial real estate
projects and junk bonds. Thrift institutions will be required to
raise the level of housing and housing-related loans in their
portfolios to 70 percent from the current 60 percent. S&amp;Ls now
involved in risky ventures will have five years to phase out these
investments.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>BUREAUCRACY</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   The lead S&amp;L regulatory agency, the Federal Home Loan Bank
Board, will be dismantled. Its regulatory divisions will be
transferred to a new Treasury Department agency. The fund insuring
S&amp;L deposits moves to the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp., which
already insures commercial banks.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>REAL ESTATE</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   The Resolution Trust Corp. will be created to sell more than
$300 billion in real estate now owned by bankrupt S&amp;Ls. The FDIC
will do the work, overseen by a board headed by the treasury
secretary. The government will be required to give housing
authorities and non-profit agencies first chance to buy housing
from the S&amp;Ls.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>ANTI-FRAUD PROVISIONS</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   The Justice Department is getting $75 million a year for the
next three years to uncover and prosecute fraud at S&amp;Ls and banks.
It is directed to establish a fraud task force in Texas, which has
the biggest concentraton of problem S&amp;Ls. Maximum fines for
financial institution fraud will rise from $5,000 a day to $1
million, the maximum jail term from five years to 20 years.

<HEAD>Critics Charge VIP Riders Taking Money from Historical Programs</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MANASSAS, Va. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Vice President Dan Quayle and his family
like riding government-owned horses at Manassas National
Battlefield Park, but such VIP privilege may harm the park's
historical interpretive efforts, employees say.
   Quayle and his three children _ Tucker, 15, Benjamin, 12, and
Corinne, 10 _ are regular visitors to the park, according to the
vice president's office. The family is accompanied by Secret
Services agents and local law enforcement officials.
   They ride the park's nine horses _ normally used for park
security patrols and not available for public use.
   ``You have the vice president riding U.S. government horses at a
park that is designed for historical preservation and in which the
staff is trying to control recreational use,'' said former park
historian John Hennessey, now with the New York State Division of
Parks.
   ``You have money going into maintaining these government horses
... while anyone can see the woeful condition of the rest of the
operation. What type of message does that send to the public?''
   Park Supervisor Ken Apschnikat said that while the park's horses
are not for public use, the visits by Quayle and his family are ``a
different situation'' and the use of national park facilities by
members of the executive branch is common.
   Other guest riders have included Interior Secretary Manuel Lujan
Jr., who has been riding twice, according to park spokesman Tom
Wilson.
   David Beckwith, the vice president's press secretary, said he
was unaware of complaints about the Quayles' horseback riding. ``He
enjoys it... and says it's quite beautiful,'' Beckwith said.
   Some park staff members and Hennessey, an expert on the Civil
War battles of First and Second Manassas, see the VIP trail rides
principally as a symptom of a horse program that's grown larger
than needed _ thus draining resources from interpretive services
and preservation activities.
   ``This is the worst year in the three years I've been here,''
said Ed Raus, who heads the battlefield's interpretive staff. ``We
don't have the staff to operate the programs we once did. It
definitely has been frustrating.''
   The park, site of the two Bull Run battles in which more than
22,000 soldiers died, has had to scale back its interpretive
programs.
   Raus said his department's budget has decreased from about 15
percent to 11 percent of the park's $933,000 budget this fiscal
year. The department has laid off three employees since 1988 and
suspended some bus tours and living history exhibits.
   New signs that tell the story of those who fought and died here
in July 1861 and August 1862 sit in storage, while the old system
of recorded messages that explained what occurred at specific sites
is mute.
   ``People come in and say, `we can't understand what went on,'''
said Robert E. Lee Krick, a history major working this summer as a
park interpreter. ``They ask, `Where's the bus tour from last year,
what happened to the voice boxes?'''
   In addition, battlefield sites are in need of repair.
   Apschnikat said the cutbacks stem from increases in the park's
fixed operating costs, especially salaries, coupled with a
1,200-acre expansion during the past five years.
   Park officials said it was impossible to determine the amount of
time a specific ranger or other employee might spend on a
horse-related project.
   ``You see the horse program growing and growing and growing, and
everything else going down hill,'' said park administrative officer
Jane Becker. ``You see things falling apart, you must ask where is
the money going.''

<HEAD>Bonn Urges East Germans to Leave Embassies in East</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CAROL J. WILLIAMS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BONN, West Germany (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government on Wednesday appealed
to East Germans hoping to obtain exit visas to stop occupying West
German embassies in Eastern Europe.
   As many as 400 East Germans were reported to be holed up in West
Germany's embassies in Budapest and Prague, and at the permanent
mission in East Berlin.
   The problem compelled Bonn to close its mission in East Berlin
on Tuesday.
   Chancellor Helmut Kohl's chief of staff, Rudolf Seiters, said
relations between East Germany and West Germany have been improving
in the past year and that the refugee situation ``is creating more
problems than it is solving.''
   A resolution of the problem has been complicated by the absence
of many senior West German officials, who are on vacation, and by
East Germany's refusal to give exit visas to those occupying the
embassies.
   Seiters pressed the West German view that East Germans wanting
to emigrate should seek legal means of leaving the country to avoid
damaging relations between the nations.
   He said the number of exit visas granted during the first six
months of this year _ 46,434 _ exceeds the number allowed to
emigrate in all of 1988.
   Seiters also said the number of East Germans granted visas for
visits to West Germany had increased by more than 9 percent this
year.
   But he said West German officials recognized that ``the desire
to leave will decrease only when democratic advancements and
reforms are in place'' in East Germany, and he said no immediate
efforts in that direction were visible.
   The West German appeal was issued after a special meeting of
Kohl's Cabinet early Wednesday. Only five of the 19 federal
ministers were present. Many senior Bonn officials, including Kohl,
take their vacations in August.
   Due to the lack of a quorum, the Cabinet meeting was limited to
advisory action.
   Inter-German Affairs Minister Dorothee Wilms has been criticized
by West German newspapers for failing to return to Bonn to deal
with the refugee problem. Her spokesman said Wednesday she was
ending her vacation early and was heading back to the capital.
   East Germans began occupying the West German embassies nearly
two weeks ago, apparently out of frustration over the outlook for
emigrating through official channels.
   The East Germans, who numbered 131 at the East Berlin mission
when officials closed the premises, have said they will not leave
until they are promised exit visas for West Germany.
   Seiters said the East Berlin mission would be reopened only when
the federal government could ensure normal operations.
   The mission has functioned in place of a West German Embassy
since diplomatic relations were established between the two German
states in 1974.
   Seiters said those at the closed East Berlin mission would be
allowed to stay until they ``decide voluntarily to leave.''
   Mission spokesman Eberhard Grashoff said that as of midday
Wednesday, none had left.

   President Bush on Wednesday urged all American
churches and other places of faith to offer ``a special prayer''
this weekend for the hostages in Lebanon and for world peace.
   ``I just want to suggest that this weekend, each in our own way,
that we say a prayer for the American hostages, for their family
and indeed for world peace,'' said Bush.
   ``I believe in prayer,'' said the president, who delivered the
plea at the outset of a private meeting with Roman Catholic
Cardinal Bernard Law of Boston.
   ``So I would ask the churches and other places of faith to say a
special prayer this weekend,'' said Bush, an Episcopalian and
regular church-goer.
   Law later called it ``a wonderful thing.''
   The cardinal, a personal friend of Bush's, said he offered a
prayer before the private lunch with the president, chief of staff
John Sununu and National Security Adviser Brent Scowcroft.
   Law said they discussed not only ``the terrible situation of the
hostages,'' but ``the broader issue of Lebanon.''
   ``The hostage situation has to be seen in the context of the
question of Lebanon as a whole,'' said Law, who expressed hope for
a revival of the Arab League efforts to end the factional strife
and provide ``greater integrity of territory for the Lebanese.''
   Law said that in the past, Christians and Moslems ``have been
able to forge out a very unique kind of political experiment ...
(and) live together in a political system that really was a model''
in Lebanon.
   Law noted that large numbers of Christians are fleeing Beirut
because of the shelling there and said, ``if there isn't quickly
some resolution to the Lebanese situation ... then one would
despair of that Christian presence.''
   Reporters asked the cardinal if he was optimistic about Bush's
diplomatic efforts to end the hostage crisis.
   ``I'm in the business of hope, I'm in the business of
conversion, so I'm never ready to assume that the status quo is
it,'' Law replied with a smile.
   Law said Bush had tentatively agreed to visit Boston Sept. 23 to
speak at a gathering of Catholic lawyers and judges.
   He said they also discussed events in Central America and Cuba,
a country Law has visited several times.
   Law said that despite recent arrests of human rights activists
in Cuba, he has seen progress in the communist island in the past
five years toward wider freedom.
   ``It does seem to me that Cuba, given its geographic location,
very naturally ought to be in good relationship with the United
States,'' said the cardinal.

   Espionage for communist countries
accounted for nearly three-fourths of the 91 cases uncovered by
Swiss authorities in 1980-88, a government report said Wednesday.
   The cases involved 141 spies, including 50 foreign diplomats.
One hundred of the spies caught, or 71 percent, were from the East
bloc and other communist countries, the report by the Swiss Federal
Prosecutor's Office said.
   However, it said the number of cases has fallen steadily after
peaking at the start of the 1980s, when Warsaw Pact countries
resorted to economic espionage to counter a U.S. ban on exports of
high technology, imposed after the Soviet intervention of
Afghanistan.
   The office provided no annual breakdown.

<TEXT>
   About 260 dependents of U.S. government
employees in China who were evacuated in June have been authorized
to return because of improved security conditions, the State
Department said Wednesday.
   Department spokeswoman Margaret Tutwiler said that the State
Department nonetheless is continuing to recommend to Americans that
they defer non-essential travel to China.
   She that the although the security situation has improved, it is
still more unsettled than before the imposition of martial law in
May.
   The dependents were ordered home three days after Chinese
military forces routed demonstrators who had occupied Tienanmen
Square in Beijing for weeks.
   As part of the disturbances, Chinese troops fired their weapons
in the vicinity of a compound where diplomats and other foreign
residents live. The U.S. Embassy's chief of security said bullets
flew through a window into a room where his two children were
watching television.
   The incident prompted a strong protest by the U.S. Embassy to
Chinese authorities. Ms. Tutwiler was unable to say whether the
issue was resolved to the satisfaction of U.S. officials.
   At the time, officials said the shooting appeared to come from
the indiscriminate firing of troops who were attempting to clear
Chinese civilians from the streets.
   The decision to send the dependents back to China contributed to
the notion that U.S.-Chinese relations are gradually normalizing.
Secretary of State James A. Baker III met late last month with
China's foreign minister during a visit to Paris.
   Other officials, insisting on anonymity, said virtually all
other foreign dependents who were evacuated in June have since
returned to Beijing. They also said that of the 350 American
businessmen who departed China, about 150 have gone back.
   The State Department urged American visitors to China to take a
number of precautions. It said Chinese authorities have seized
religious and political materials they deem objectionable and it
urged that Americans refrain from going out after dark or
photographing areas where disturbances have occurred.

<DATELINE>BUDAPEST, Hungary (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The fledgling parliamentary opposition
said Wednesday that said the Communists had destroyed Hungarian
society in 42 years of rule, but it offered to cooperate with party
reformers after free elections.
   Members of the opposition Hungarian Democratic Forum ruled out
any coalition with the Communist Party before general elections
planned next year.
   But they said even a new government dominated by the forum and
other opposition groups would likely include some Communist
ministers.
   The forum counts among its members a tiny legislative caucus of
three newly elected lawmakers. The country's one-chamber
legislature has 370 members.
   ``We are trying to change a completely wrecked society to a new
one,'' declared Istvan Csurka, a forum leader, speaking to
reporters at his organization's headquarters in Budapest. However,
he did not present a program of change.
   Two of the front legislators complained of interference by local
Communist officials during campaigning and voting in by-elections
Saturday and on July 22. However, they suggested the irregularities
were the work of overzealous individuals _ not part of a larger
plan.
   While only a small fraction of Hungary's electorate took part in
the by-elections, opposition figures have viewed the results as an
indication of Communist weakness during next year's general
elections.
   Communist leaders, who endorsed a multiparty system in February,
have sought to play down the defeat of their candidates, pointing
to low turnouts and claiming their campaigns were low-key.
   Csurka was asked Wednesday if he or other top forum officials
were ready to become prime minister if the opposition won next
year's elections.
   ``We will find the right man from our ranks for any
responsibility,'' he said.
   But he said ``there will be and there must be'' some Communists
in the next Hungarian government, regardless of the election
outcome.
   Forum spokesman Csaba Kiss put conditions on any post-election
cooperation with the Communists.
   ``There can be no coalition if the key positions _ Interior
Ministry, Foreign Ministry, Finance Ministry _ are seized by the
Communist Party, as in 1947,'' he told reporters. Hungary became a
one-party state that year.
   In Poland, the opposition, led by the labor union Solidarity,
has refused to join the ruling Communists in a coalition after
Solidarity scored a sweeping victory in June elections.

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The second and third liquor salesmen to take the
stand at Leona Helmsley's tax evasion and extortion trial testified
Wednesday that they, too, were forced to pay kickbacks on sales to
Helmsley-owned hotels.
   Herbert Cohen of Capital Liquors and James Pursley of Star
Industries both said they had to pay back 2 percent of their gross
sales to four hotels _ the Park Lane, the Palace, the New York
Helmsley and the St. Moritz. The salesmen testified that their
commissions were generally 5 percent on gross sales.
   They testified the payments were arranged by Mrs. Helmsley's top
aide, Frank Turco, and that the kickbacks were no longer required
after Turco was fired in February 1986.
   The testimony was elicited by prosecutors to support the most
serious charge Mrs. Helmsley faces _ the allegation that she
conspired with Turco to extort payoffs and goods from vendors doing
business with Helmsley-owned companies. Turco is on trial with her.
   Last week, the first liquor salesman to testify, Lee West, said
he was forced to kick back the same percentage of his commission to
keep his accounts at Helmsley hotels in New York. He said he gave
about $10,000 in payoffs in 1984.
   Lee testified that in addition he had to take on the task of
acting as central purchasing agent for liquor for the hotels. Mrs.
Helmsley decided to set up the arrangment after she was told
certain employees within the company were taking kickbacks from
liquor salesmen.
   Pursley said he took over the task after Lee left at the end of
1984.
   He testified that at a meeting in February 1985 with other
liquor salesmen, Turco discussed where payments were going.
   ``He told us all that none of the money was going to him. It
goes to Mrs. Helmsley,'' Pursley said, adding that Turco said he
put the money in a special slush fund for Mrs. Helmsley.
   He quoted Turco as saying that Mrs. Helmsley said that ``since
we were so free with our money, she was going to take it.''
   Pursley said he paid an average of $600 a month for one year
beginning in February 1985. He delivered his cash payments in
envelopes to Turco's office, he said. Cohen testified that he
kicked back about $9,000 over two years. He said that one of the
Helmsleys' real estate companies would send him an invoice for
consulting fees and that he would send a check for that amount.
   Mrs. Helmsley also is charged with tax evasion for allegedly
disguising about $4 million in personal expenses as business
expenses. Turco and another former aide, Joseph Licari, are charged
with assisting in that scheme. All three are on trial on the tax
charge.
   The conspiracy charge carries a maximum prison term of 20 years
upon conviction. Penalties on the tax fraud charges range from
three to five years.

<HEAD>Warhol Exhibit Opens In Bratislava</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PRAGUE, Czechoslovakia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An exhibit of works by the late
Andy Warhol, whose parents came from Slovakia, opened Wednesday in
the Slovak capital of Bratislava, the state news agency CTK
reported.
   It said the exhibit contained more than 300 works from a Warhol
retrospective shown in New York earlier this year.
   Warhol, the maverick artist with white hair known for his
renditions of Marilyn Monroe and Campbell soup cans, died in
February 1987 at age 58.
   His parents were born in the Slovak town of Mikova, and
Czechoslovak cultural and social organizations are currently
discussing with Warhol's brother John, who is vice-president of the
Andy Warhol Foundation, the chances of opening a Warhol gallery in
Mikova, CTK said without elaboration.
   The news agency did not say how long the Bratislava exhibit will
show or whether it would go elsewhere in Czechoslovakia.

   Analysts said Israel may make a limited
military response to Wednesday's suicide bombing by the pro-Iranian
Hezbollah, despite the risk to diplomatic efforts aimed at ending
the hostage crisis.
   The government did not mention retaliation in its response to
statements from Beirut saying the suicide car bomb, which wounded
five Israeli soldiers and an allied militiaman, was a response to
the abduction July 28 of Sheik Abdul Karim Obeid, a Hezbollah
spiritual leader.
   Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir telephoned President Bush as a way
of ``achieving a better coordination between the Israeli and U.S.
positions on hostages and prisoners of war,'' said Shamir's
adviser, Avi Pazner.
   He described the 10-minute conversation as ``very good and
friendly.'' He said Shamir repeated Israel's position that it will
free Obeid only in exchange for the three Israeli soldiers held in
Lebanon and ``all the hostages.'' Pazner would not give details of
Bush's replies.
   Sixteen Western hostages are held in Lebanon, including eight
Americans.
   An Israeli government statment after the bombing said:
   ``To our great sorrow, another brutal attack was committed today
close to our northern border. This attack, for which Hezbollah
assumed responsibility, is another link in a long and bloody chain
of attacks along this border which has been going on for many years.
   ``This is another horrible reminder of the constant security
problem along our northern border which unfortunately places Israel
on the frontline of the struggle against international terrorism.''
   Israel's coordinator for south Lebanon, Uri Lubrani, said there
would be retaliation eventually, but he did not say when or what
form it would take.
   ``Israel will deal with the Hezbollah as it deals with all the
organizations which threaten the normal life of the security
zone,'' he said. ``Violence has two edges and Israel will retaliate
in one way or another ... in due time, in a place it will choose.''
   Ariel Merari, a terrorism expert at Tel Aviv University's Jaffee
Center for Strategic Studies, said in an interview that Israel
would be viewed as weak unless it retaliated.
   ``An Israeli retaliation would disrupt negotiations no more than
this car bombing. Unless this becomes a trend, a single Israeli
retaliation would not change anything,'' he said.
   He suggested the military response should be measured so as not
to provoke a cycle of attack and counterattack.
   ``I would recommend some type of strike or force in retaliation
for this,'' he said. ``The only way to bring Hezbollah to a
(hostage) deal is to project force against force.''
   Speaking on Israeli TV, military commentator Ron Ben-Ishai said
in the past Israel had used air raids to respond to such attacks
even when Israeli prisoners were threatened.
   ``When we had a car bomb attack last year, Hezbollah threatened
that if Israel reacted, it would harm Israeli prisoners of war. The
army then made its calculations and the air force bombed Hezbollah
command headquarters,'' he said.
   The suicide car bomb in October 1988 claimed the lives of eight
Israeli soldiers and wounded seven others. Israel responded with
three air raids and a ground assault in which 16 Lebanese were
killed and 40 wounded.
   Ben-Ishai also said Israel risked being viewed as weak if it did
not retaliate.
   Aharon Levran, a retired brigadier general and a commentator on
military affairs, said Israel response would be ``moderate'' if a
military option was chosen to punish Hezbollah.
   But he suggested Israel might refrain from any military activity
so as ``not to agitate world public opinion'' after the U.S.
criticism over Israel's abduction of Obeid.
   ``I would not be surprised if Israel will swallow hard and do
nothing. Israel does not want to disrupt the process (of
negotiations) which has begun with Sheik Obeid,'' he said in an
interview.
   ``If Israel is going to punish Hezbollah by launching reprisals
it will be shooting itself in the foot. It will not facilitate the
exchange of prisoners,'' he added.
   Israel abducted the Shiite clergyman to try to prod Hezbollah
into agreeing to a prisoner exchange. Shiite radicals aligned with
the group are believed to be holding three Israeli servicemen
captured in 1986.
   Defense Minister Yitzhak Rabin has offered to exchange Obeid and
several hundred other Shiite prisoners held in Israeli jails for
the Israeli airman and two soldiers. But Rabin stressed Tuesday
that Israel would not start negotiations until they had some sign
of life from the POWs.

<TEXT>
   If E.T. took a little ocean vacation with Jules Verne, and
dropped in for lunch with Lloyd Bridges and Flipper, maybe someone
would make a movie out of it. Maybe it could even be called ``The
Abyss.''
   The $43 million 20th Century Fox summer spectacular is about as
derivative as any movie can get. James Cameron, who wrote and
directed, pulls a litany of movie formulas and gimmicks, including
a few from ``Aliens,'' which he also wrote and directed.
   What redeems ``The Abyss'' from being an ``E.T.'' or ``Aliens''
rip-off are some spectacular special effects and camera work.
   Deepcore, a submersible oil rig, is working not far from where a
submarine, armed with nuclear warheads, has crashed in a
fantastically deep trough. The government commandeers the mother
vessel, orders Deepcore to take on a group of Navy SEALS and work
with the divers to salvage the sub.
   At the same time, a hurricane rages above and an alien nation
broods below. It seems the hurricane was a little something the
aliens whipped up to protest nuclear weapons. The aliens, who move
faster than a speeding bullet and who are definitely more powerful
than any locomotive, also are responsible for the sub crash.
   Still, they are friendly, peace-loving little shards of light,
vaguely reminiscent of the ethereal creatures in Ron Howard's
``Cocoon.''
   Deepcore's crew is a lovable bunch of hardcore riggers led by
Bud Brigman (Ed Harris). His estranged wife, Lindsey (Mary
Elizabeth Mastrantonio), designed the rig and brings down the SEALS
for the salvage operation.
   The SEALS have a definite attitude problem, and their leader,
Lt. Coffey (Michael Biehn), is certifiable.
   The hurricane causes an above-water crane to crash down on
Deepcore, and drags it the brink of the underwater trough. After
communciation is severed with the mother ship, Coffey goes solo and
decides to arm one of the sub's nuclear warheads, terminate the
aliens and kill Deepcore's crew.
   Before his ultimate demise, Coffey manages to arm one of
Deepcore's mini sea Rovers, called Little Geek, with a nuclear
warhead, aimed straight into the trough at the alien nation.
   The first two-thirds of ``The Abyss'' amount to a fairly good
adventure-thriller, with lots of sparkling, hip dialogue, good
character development and nonstop action. The last third is a joke.
   Brigman decides to don a dive suit and go into the trough to
follow Little Geek. He uses a special, experimental Navy liquid mix
as his breathing aparatus. Why does he go? Because it's a dirty
little job and ``somebody has to do it,'' he says with a straight
face. This and other cliches pop up with astonishing frequency as
``The Abyss'' begins its plunge into movie camp.
   There are odd moments: Lindsey drowning in freezing water and
then being revived by Bud slapping her face and calling her names
after adrenalin and shocks have failed; a syrupy and trite Lindsey
confessing to all sorts of mistreatment to Bud as he almost loses
conciousness at depths no human has ever gone.
   There are pure ripoffs: an alien finger resembling little E.T.'s
spindly appendage reaching out and touching a human _ much the same
way as in ``E.T. The Extraterrestrial,'' and Michaelangelo's
ceiling in the Sistine Chapel.
   But Harris and Mastrantonio are a good blend, and the Deepcore
crew is an interesting lot, thanks in part to Howard Feuer's
casting. Still, it's a formula group: a strong woman who helps
leads the crew from disaster; a black; a burly, football type; a
comic who travels with his pet mouse; a laidback guy named Jammer
who comes through when the going gets real rough.
   Mikael Salomon's photography is superb, and the original music
by Alan Silvestri has just the right taste of suspense and promise.
   But in the end, ``The Abyss'' promises so much and delivers so
little.
   Produced by Gale Anne Hurd, ``The Abyss'' is rated PG-13 for
language and thrills.

<HEAD>Government Admits Controversial Groups to Its Charity Drive</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MIKE FEINSILBER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government on Wednesday listed 389
charities, including several controversial ones, that will take
part in a massive employee solicitation drive that raises about
$160 million a year from federal workers.
   A homosexual group, the Lambda Legal Defense and Educational
Fund, is among 19 groups whose applications were included in the
Combined Federal Campaign after initially being turned down.
   ``I assume, frankly, that there was simply a desire to keep
Lambda out of the circle by virtue of its mission,'' defending
homosexuals and homosexual rights in court, said executive director
Thomas Stoddard.
   ``Frankly, it is a thrilling prospect for us,'' he said. ``Being
listed helps fulfill our mission.''
   He said his was the first overtly homosexual group to win the
right to participate. He said he could not anticipate how much
money would come to the group since designating it as a charitable
recipience ``may be viewed by the employee as one degree of coming
out.'' The fund, with a $1 million budget, was established in 1972.
   Constance Newman, director of the Office of Personnel
Management, said that after personally reviewing rejected
applications, she approved 19 rejected organizations, gave
qualified approval to eight, left six pending and denied approval
to 55, of which 33 had not complied with requests for additional
information.
   Those given qualified approval for one year spend more than 25
percent of their receipts on administrative and fund-raising costs,
normally grounds for exclusion.
   Approval went to a range of causes, some potentially
controversial. Among them are the Firearms Civil Rights Legal
Defense Fund, the United Palestinian Appeal, Human Life
International, the National Association of Black Law Enforcement
Executives, United States Military Sports Association, the Living
Bank and Operation California.
   Anti-abortion groups, such as the National Right to Life
Educational Trust Fund, and abortion rights groups, such as the
Religious Coalition for Abortion Rights Education Fund and Planned
Parenthood-World Population, already were listed. So were such
conservative groups as the National Right to Work Legal Defense
Foundation, Inc., and such liberal outfits as People for the
American Way.
   Being listed can bring large amounts of money to an organization
at virtually no cost _ or it can bring nothing if employees do not
specifically designate the charity.
   The fund drive raises over $160 million from 4 million federal
employees, including military people and postal workers, with the
average giving $60.68.
   It is the largest employee solicitation in the country, OPM
said, although Americans individually gave $87 billion to churches
and charities in 1988, according to the American Association of
Fund-Raising Counsel.
   Federal employees may designate up to five charities from a list
that, when local groups are included, in some instances numbers as
many as 1,000.
   About 80 percent of the gifts are designated. Of the rest, about
82 percent goes to the local United Way campaign, 7 percent to a
group of 33 international service agencies, 7 percent to national
health agencies and 4 percent to local groups, according to OPM.
   Former President Ronald Reagan issued an executive order in 1983
restricting the federal drive to traditional health and welfare
charities. But after protests and lawsuits by advocacy groups,
Congress in 1986 enacted legislation broadening the grounds for
admission but giving the OPM director discretion.

<HEAD>Bass Player for Texas Playboys Swing Band Dies At 75</HEAD>
<DATELINE>FORT WORTH, Texas (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   T.C. ``Son'' Lansford, bass player for
the Western swing group Texas Playboys, has died. He was 75.
   Lansford, who died Monday in a Fort Worth hospital, was one of
the first musicians to use an electric bass guitar.
   Joe Ferguson, one of the original members of the 1930s Texas
Playboys, said Wednesday that Lansford's death leaves Smokey Dacus,
June Whelan, Eldon Shamblin and himself as the only surviving
original members.
   ``He was the first slap bass player I had ever seen and he could
slap the devil out of that thing,'' Ferguson said. ``We were chop
bass players. We didn't have much finesse, we just tried to keep
the rhythm the way Bob Wills wanted it.'
   Lansford's sons told the Fort Worth Star-Telegram that he picked
up a fiddle when he was 10 years old and played a tune.
   Lansford joined Wills, his cousin, after the older musician had
left the Light Crust Doughboys and gone to Tulsa in 1934 and formed
his Texas Playboys. To join the band, Lansford had to hop a freight
train to get to Fort Worth, then rode with Wills' parents to Tulsa.
   Lansford gave up the fiddle and began playing bass because Wills
already handled the fiddling. Within two years of making the
switch, he was voted by Variety magazine as one of the top two bass
players in the United States, the newspaper said.
   After marrying in 1936, Lansford left the Playboys and formed a
band in Amarillo called The Flying Dutchmen. But after a couple
years, the band broke up and Lansford rejoined the Playboys.
   Lansford appeared in three movies with the Playboys. He also was
a part-time barnstorming pilot and stunt flier. During World War
II, he trained Royal Air Force pilots and some Army pilots in
Oklahoma after unsuccessfully trying to join the Army Air Corps.
   Lansford had lived in Fort Worth since about 1951, the
Star-Telegram said. He occasionally performed, but less frequently
in recent years because of arthritis in his hands.
   He is survived by two daughters, one son, 10 grandchildren, 14
great-grandchildren.
   Services will be Saturday in Colleyville.

<HEAD>Lesbian Soldier Can't Re-Enlist in Army, Appeals Court Rules</HEAD>

<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A federal appeals court has barred an Army
Reserve sergeant from re-enlisting because she is a lesbian, saying
sexual orientation is important for maintaining discipline and the
integrity of command.
   The 7th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals reversed a lower court
decision allowing Miriam Ben-Shalom, of Milwaukee, to rejoin the
Army Reserve. The Army had refused to allow her to re-enlist
because of her professed homosexuality.
   Patrick Berigan, Ms. Ben-Shalom's attorney, said she will
appeal. ``It's our intent to keep up with the appeals and go as far
as we can,'' he said from his home in Milwaukee.
   Tuesday's ruling reversed a January decision by U.S. District
Judge Myron Gordon in Milwaukee. Gordon said Ms. Ben-Shalom's First
Amendment rights to freedom of speech were violated by an Army
regulation barring homosexuals.
   Ruling on the Army's appeal, the three-judge appeals court panel
found that while Ms. Ben-Shalom's declaration of homosexuality is
speech, it is also an acknowledgement of identification in a group.
   ``It is the identity that makes her ineligible for military
service, not the speaking of it aloud,'' Judge Harlington Wood Jr.
wrote in the decision. ``Thus, if the Army's regulation affects
speech, it does so only incidentally, in the course of pursuing
other legitimate goals.''
   The appellate court agreed with the Army's argument that it
needs to distinguish military personnel on the basis of sexual
orientation to maintain discipline and preserve the integrity of
rank and command.
   The court also found that Ms. Ben-Shalom's 5th Amendment right
to equal protection under the law had not been violated.
   Ms. Ben-Shalom was traveling in Michigan and could not be
reached for comment, said a friend, Hope Gentle, contacted at Ms.
Ben-Shalom's home in Milwaukee.
   John Hoyle, the Justice Department attorney who argued the case
before the appellate court for the Army, declined to comment.
   Ms. Ben-Shalom, 40, was discharged from the Army Reserve in 1976
after she said she was a lesbian. After a series of court actions,
she was reinstated in September 1987.
   Ms. Ben-Shalom applied to re-enlist for a six-year Army Reserve
term last August. Gordon ordered the Army to consider her
re-enlistment without regard to her homosexuality.
   The Army refused to let her rejoin, but after Gordon found the
service in contempt of court in January, Ms. Ben-Shalom was allowed
to re-enlist. The action was, however, made conditional on the
outcome of the Army's appeal to the circuit court.

   A group that monitors children's television
asked the government Wednesday to regulate paid telephone message
services pitched to young viewers and said calls to such numbers
can bring parents unexpectedly large telephone bills.
   Calling it a pocketbook issue rather than a free speech one,
Action for Children's Television requested the Federal Trade
Commission to restrict such 900-number services.
   Its petition asks the FTC to require American Telephone &amp;
Telegraph Co. to issue refunds on demand to parents for
unauthorized calls made by their children, make a blocking device
available to parents and itemize telephone bills ``for child
services.''
   The group's targets are the numbers advertised on children's
programs shown on independent stations during weekday afternoon
hours, when many ``latchkey'' children are at home but their
parents are at work.
   The 900 numbers invite children to talk to popular personalities
and cartoon characters, such as the Tooth Fairy, Mighty Mouse or
She-Ra and He-man, and often offer products such as posters, signs
or shirts as enticements to call, according to the ACT petition.
   Although children are told they will ``talk to'' a character,
they hear a recorded message instead, the petition says.
   In fact, AT&amp;T says that any 900 service for which it consents to
do the billing must be a recorded message. It must also say what
the call will cost, tell children to ask for their parents'
permission and allow no ``funny technology,'' such as the service
that told children to hold the phone to the TV while it bleeped out
tones.
   A typical call to such a 900 number might cost $2.45 _ $2 for
the first minute and 45 cents for each additional minute.
   Andrea West, AT&amp;T's product marketing manager for 900 services,
said the company doesn't issue all 900 numbers although ``we have
some sponsors that do provide programming with licensed
characters.''
   Licensed characters are those for whom the rights are owned by a
company.
   West said customers can contest their bills although AT&amp;T has no
blanket policy on granting refunds. She said regional phone company
have the choice of offering itemized billing and in some instances
do offer blocking devices.
   AT&amp;T says it set its guidelines ``in concert with'' the
regulatory guidelines of the Children's Advertising Review Unit of
the Council of Better Business Bureaus.
   The ACT petition calls the AT&amp;T safeguards ineffective. ACT
President Peggy Charren said that although AT&amp;T may not issue all
the numbers, ``the ones they bill are the ones we are talking
about.''
   The Better Business Bureau unit that oversees children's
advertising says it does not ``encourage or endorse this form of
advertising to children'' but is proposing guidelines.
   Robert H. Lorsch, president and founder of Teleline Inc. of
Beveraly Hills, Calif., one of the leading providers of such
services, said research shows that an average call lasts less than
two minutes, that children have asked their parents' permission and
that children who don't understand that the costs mount with the
time they are on the phone probably couldn't make a call in the
first place.
   He said his company has worked closely with ACT and the business
bureau to put out responsible programming.

<HEAD>Children Use Playground For Make-Believe Drug Ring</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MICHAEL BLOOD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LEBANON, Pa. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A group of children used a playground as
headquarters for a make-believe drug ring, selling neatly packaged
bags of sugar and grass clippings that looked like cocaine and
marijuana, police said Wednesday.
   ``I think the whole thing is very tragic. Normally they play
fireman or policeman. It's tragic when they want to grow up and be
drug dealers,'' said city Councilman Peter Zug.
   Authorities speculated that the children _ who were believed to
be 12 or younger _ were either emulating their parents or being
trained for the drug business.
   ``I was shocked and depressed,'' said Detective Thomas Capello,
looking through a tackle box stacked with bogus drugs and colored
slips of paper detailing the group's transactions.
   ``I think they were doing this as a game with other kids, but it
was a very serious game,'' Capello said.
   The tackle box was turned over to police last week after two
children, ages 7 and 9, found it in a tree at the dilapidated
downtown playground, which neighbors said had been closed for at
least two years. The playground in the city east of Harrisburg
borders an area of the city known for drug use, officials said.
   Police had not interviewed any children in the case but said
they had five names from reading ledger notes in the box and
intended to speak with the youngsters Thursday.
   ``It was sophisticated packaging; they were maintaining a list
of buyers, money spent and money owed. ... I was totally shocked,''
said Chief Michael DeLeo.
   ``What concerns me is the age category we're dealing with. We
must do something to save the next generation,'' he said.
   Also in the tackle box was 52 cents and detailed lists of
product prices and sizes. On one slip, cocaine was misspelled
``cocain.'' A small bag of the bogus cocaine was priced at 55
cents. The small bags of grass clippings were priced at $1.
   Officials said the grass clipping and sugar were not illegal,
but selling them under the pretense of being drugs would be. They
said their primary concern was that the children receive counseling.
   ``There absolutely needs to be discussions with them to teach
them about drugs and the tragedy that can come from drugs,'' Zug
said.

<TEXT>
   Police fired tear gas at hundreds
of black protesters marching from a university campus in defiance
of emergency regulations Wednesday. Fifteen journalists were
detained.
   At least 1,500 black students and other activists held a
lunchtime rally at the mixed-race University of the Western Cape as
part of a national campaign of defiance against emergency
restrictions and apartheid laws.
   The protests, which have been marked by almost daily
student-police clashes in the Cape Town area, coincide with the
campaign for Sept. 6 parliamentary elections. The Parliament
excludes representatives of the black majority of 28 million.
   After the rally, police detained 15 reporters, photographers and
cameramen for foreign and local news organizations for about four
hours. They were placed in police vehicles and held outside the
campus while police fired rounds of tear gas at the between 500 and
600 people who marched off the university grounds after the rally.
   The journalists were later taken to a police station and warned
that they were under investigation for allegedly violating the
3-year-old emergency regulations that restrict press coverage of
unrest. Enforcement of the press restrictions has not been
comprehensive.
   ``About 20 policemen were firing tear gas at random as the
marchers with placards came about a quarter of the way across the
road, then moved back,'' said a journalist who watched the events.
``The police were firing tear gas over the cars passing on the
road, then they went onto the campus and fired tear gas all over.''
   It was not known whether any students were arrested or injured
in the clash.
   The Argus, a Cape Town newspaper, said in an editorial Wednesday
that the defiance protests, which began a week ago with black
patients seeking treatment at white hospitals, were gathering
momentum.
   The paper said organizations and individuals restricted under
the 1986 emergency were refusing to ``meekly acquiesce in their own
repression.''
   ``The government's response has been predictable,'' said The
Argus. ``It has furiously denounced the organizations leading the
defiance and ordered a tough police response _ no doubt sensing
that such handling of the situation could boost its flagging
fortunes in the general election campaign.''
   The 924,000-member Congress of South African Trade Unions is a
leader of the defiance campaign, despite a government decree that
bans the organization from engaging in political activity.
   The congress issued a statement Wednesday mocking Law and Order
Minister Adriaan Vlok's comment that he will investigate the labor
federation's breaking of the emergency restrictions.
   ``What he will find is that the vast majority of right-thinking
South Africans have stopped observing the state of emergency long
ago,'' the statement said. ``Not only are these regulations
incomprehensible and unenforceable, but people do not regard
themselves as bound by laws which they had no say in passing.''

<HEAD>Man Says `Voices' Told Him to Kill President Bush</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KATHLEEN MACLAY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SAN FRANCISCO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A man arrested after a bank robbery said he
committed a string of heists around the country while trailing
George Bush because ``voices'' told him to kill the president,
police said Wednesday.
   John Spencer Daughette, a 34-year-old transient, reportedly told
investigators he robbed the bank because he needed money to carry
out his assassination plan.
   ``He was going to get about $3,000 to buy a motorcycle and go
east and assassinate the president or kill some children,'' said
Oakland police Sgt. Greg Bingham. ``I believe with all my heart
from talking to him, he would have done just that.''
   Bingham said the FBI told Oakland police that Daughette fits the
profile of someone capable of carrying out such an act.
   ``We had no idea what we had on our hands when we picked him
up,'' said Bingham. ``As he started talking, we realized we had a
very scary individual in our presence.''
   During an interview with police and the FBI, Bingham said
Daughette appeared ``very calm, relaxed and with very good recall.''
   While an investigation continued to determine whether the
alleged assassination plan may result in criminal charges,
Daughette remained jailed without bail in San Francisco on one
count of bank robbery.
   Geoff Hansen, the federal public defender appointed to represent
Daughette, declined comment about his client. He said information
about the Daughette case and background will likely be revealed at
a detention hearing scheduled in U.S. District Court on Thursday.
   After he was arrested Friday for allegedly robbing Gateway
Savings in Oakland, Daughette ``readily admitted to the robbery of
this bank and seven others across the United States,'' said Sgt.
Sam Maddux. ``He also admitted he had been stalking or pursuing the
president of the United States in an attempt to kill him.''
   His assassination plan was attributed to voices that ``were
telling him to do certain things, and if he did not do so, he would
be poisoned,'' Maddux said. ``These voices did not tell him why.''
   Bingham said Daughette indicated his presidential death plan
focused on ``the office, not the man ... he wants to assassinate
the president.''
   Maddux said Daughette also ``made some mention he had seen the
TV news reports about the school children shootings in Stockton,
and at that point he heard very loud voices that said if he
couldn't kill the president, he should go after school children.''
   On Jan. 17, Patrick Edward Purdy opened fire with a
semiautomatic AK-47 on a Stockton schoolyard, killing five children
and wounding 29 students and a teacher.
   John Henneman, spokesman for Richard Roudebush Veterans
Administration Medical Center in Indianapolis, said Daughette was
admitted on Jan. 14, 1987, for a 30-day stay and again in April
1987 for 45 days. Daughette was admitted on Feb. 10, but walked
away from the hospital on March 20, he said.
   Henneman said he could not reveal what Daughette was treated
for, but said he is an Army veteran from Flora, Ind.
   Bingham said Daughette told him he had been treated at VA
hospitals for mental problems, and that he had been interviewed by
Secret Service authorities for alleged threats against ex-President
Reagan. State and federal checks failed to show any criminal record
for Daughette, he said.
   Daughette said that ``on one occasion in Michigan, he was
somewhat close (to harming Bush), but because of security
precautions, he was unable to carry out the threat,'' Maddux said.
   James Huse, special agent in charge of the Secret Service office
in Detroit, said Daughette claimed he had been in Hamtramck the
night before Bush's April 17 speech to a crowd of 4,000. Daughette
apparently diagramed the area where Bush spoke, Huse said.
   ``He told agents he had picked out the perfect spot to shoot
from but couldn't reach it on speech day because of metal
detectors,'' Huse said. ``He then ran to several areas trying to
get close enough for a shot but before he could shoot, the
president finished and left the podium.''

<HEAD>Firm Affiliated With Lucas Defends Apartments in Racial Discrimination
Case</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES ROWLEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Detroit firm with which failed civil rights
chief nominee William Lucas is affiliated is defending an apartment
building against racial discrimination suits, the Justice
Department said Wednesday.
   The most recent lawsuit, filed Wednesday by the department's
civil rights division, charged that River House Cooperative, Inc.,
of Detroit had engaged in a pattern of intentional racial
discrimination against blacks.
   Lucas, whom President Bush had nominated to be assistant
attorney general for civil rights, has not been involved and will
not participate in the law firm's handling of the case, said
Justice Department spokesman David Runkel.
   River House has been represented by Evans and Luptak, a Detroit
firm where Lucas is listed as ``of counsel'' on a financial
disclosure form he filed earlier this year.
   River House has already been the subject of a discrimination
suit brought by private plaintiffs, said Justice Department
spokeswoman Deborah Burstion-Wade.
   The federal suit charges that the cooperative ``has engaged in a
policy and practice of discrimination'' against blacks in violation
of the Fair Housing Amendments Act of 1988 and the fair-housing
provisions of the 1968 Civil Rights Act.
   In a statement, U.S. Attorney Stephen J. Markman said, ``It's
long past time that such discrimination in housing is acceptable in
Michigan.''
   President Bush's nomination of Lucas, 61, a former sheriff and
chief executive of Wayne County, Mich., to head the Justice
Department's civil rights division was defeated last week by the
Senate Judiciary Committee.
   Opponents charged that Lucas lacked professional qualifications
to head the 150-lawyer division of the Justice Department. They
also questioned his commitment to enforcing civil rights laws.
   Supporters said Lucas, who is black, was a victim of racism or
was being penalized for his refusal to criticize recent Supreme
Court decisions that they say weaken affirmative action.
   The White House says Bush is still considering giving Lucas a
so-called recess appointment to the position, which would enable
Lucas to serve without Senate confirmation through 1990. But such a
move could anger Senators and create political difficulties for
Bush.
   Runkel, meanwhile, said the Justice Department had compiled a
list of possible alternative candidates for the civil rights post.
   Lucas will be given a job within the Bush administration,
possibly at the Justice Department, Runkel said.
   He ruled out the possibility that Lucas would be appointed to
head the U.S. Marshals Service, a position Lucas had reportedly
sought before the civil rights nomination.

   Ethiopia asked for help in the
search for a plane carrying U.S. Rep. Mickey Leland and 13
companions and America responded by sending a fleet of rescue
aircraft Wednesday, U.S. officials said.
   President Bush called the disappearance a matter ``of great
concern to us'' and said Ethiopia is ``going to get all the
cooperation we can give them'' in the search, now in its third day.
   Sundown ended another day of the air and ground search with no
trace of the De Havilland Twin Otter plane, but Robert Houdek, U.S.
charge d'affairs in Addis Ababa, said, ``There are a lot of aspects
that give us cause for hope.''
   Houdek said the plane was a ``great bush aircraft'' capable of
landing in close, rough terrain, and that the pilot, Assefa
Gebre-Giorgis, was ``the best damn bush pilot in Ethiopia.''
   Gebre-Giorgis, a former Ethiopian air force pilot, ``knows
Ethiopia like the back of his hand,'' Houdek said
   Leland, 44, a Texas Democrat who heads the House Select
Committee on Hunger, has taken a great interest in Africa's refugee
problem and was flying to the Fugnido refugee camp near the border
with Sudan, 480 miles southwest of the capital of Addis Ababa.
   The congressman from Houston arrived on Monday and hours later
boarded the Twin Otter _ a high-winged, short takeoff and landing
aircraft powered by two turboprop engines. With him were eight
other Americans and five Ethiopians, including the pilot and
co-pilot.
   The plane took off in bad weather for the camp. Gebre-Giorgis
made his last radio contact 15 minutes out of Addis Ababa and the
plane never arrived.
   Officials said nine or 10 Ethiopian search planes were in the
air at any one time Wednesday, crisscrossing an area of about
24,000 square miles. Police, security officials and farmers have
conducted ground searches.
   Bush told reporters in the Oval Office that Defense Secretary
Richard Cheney was ``trying to find what assets are available'' for
the rescue effort.
   National Security Adviser Brent Scowcroft reported that ``the
Ethiopians have asked for our help ... Well, they're getting it .
.. They're going to get all the cooperation we can give them.''
   State Department spokeswoman Margaret Tutwiler said that Marxist
Ethiopia ``agreed to an overflight of the area by a U-2
photo-reconnaissance plane. A C-21 aircraft will be sent to provide
support for that overflight.''
   She said an Air Force C-141 Starlifter medical evacuation plane
was sent from West Germany on Bush's authority carrying a 20-member
medical team and search and rescue, weather and communications
personnel.
   ``Defense is sending a number of aircraft ... Two HC-130
aircraft will be deployed from ... (Britain) later today. ... (The
Defense Department) is considering sending a C-5 cargo plane
carrying five UH-60 helicopters.''
   Houdek said one cause for hope was ``that we haven't found any
wreckage'' in the rugged mountains and high plateaus along the
intended flight path.
   The search area was expanded Wednesday to parts of Sudan south
of the Fugnido camp.
   ``They're putting more resources into the area around Mizan
Tefer and Guraferda, southeast of Fugnido,'' said John Guerra, a
U.S. Embassy political and economics officer.
   Guraferda is near an area where people reported hearing a light
plane circling a dirt landing strip Monday, Guerra said, and ``we
have to reiterate that these areas are so isolated they could have
put down anyplace.''
   He described the region as ``without any communication,
virtually no roads and sparsely populated.''
   The plane carried an emergency first aid kit, he said, and ``we
just have to keep hoping they're OK.''
   Guerra conceded that the Twin Otter could have hit one of the
many mountains along its path, some of which reach heights of more
than 12,000 feet.
   Also on the plane were three congressional staff members; a
friend; four Americans, including one man's wife, from the U.S.
Embassy and the U.S. Agency for International Development, and five
Ethiopians: three government officials, the pilot and co-pilot.
   Fugnido, one of four refugee camps in southwestern Ethiopia run
by the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees, houses more than
300,000 Sudanese who have fled famine and civil war.

   A chemical company's chief executive
entered a guilty plea for his company Wednesday before a federal
judge who demanded to see the ``top man'' before allowing it to
plead guilty to polluting a waterway.
   U.S. District Judge Jack Tanner told Edwin E. Tuttle, Pennwalt
Corp.'s chief executive and chairman, that he wanted to send a
message that companies and the people who run them must be
accountable when they damage the environment.
   When natural resources ``are gone, they are gone,'' Tanner said.
   ``I'm one of those judges who wants to get someone's attention,
from someone who can do something about it. That's why you're
here.''
   Tuttle, who calmly and politely answered Tanner's questions,
apologized for the accident and said his company has spent millions
of dollars to improve environmental protection and safety at its
Tacoma plant since the January 1985 spill. He said he was confident
the accident would not be repeated.
   Pennwalt, a Philadelphia-based chemical company, is merging with
the French petrochemical company Elf Aquitaine. Tanner said while
there was no way the court could monitor Pennwalt or Elf's future
performance, he believed Tuttle was sincere in promising the
company would do better.
   ``I assure you it will,'' Tuttle replied.
   Environmentalists and legal experts have said that by requiring
Tuttle to appear in person, Tanner could set a precedent for
punishing corporate negligence.
   David Marshall, prosecutor in the case, said he thought Tanner's
actions would serve as a strong deterrent.
   ``I'm sure Mr. Tuttle is not experienced in standing up before a
federal judge,'' Marshall said. ``For him to have to come here and
answer the judge's questions, I'm sure it got his attention.''
   Pennwalt was charged after a tank spilled at least 75,000
gallons of bleach into Tacoma's Hylebos Waterway, which empties
into Puget Sound. The bleach, sodium dichromate, contained
hexavalent chromium, which can cause cancer when inhaled in a dry
form.
   In court Wednesday, Pennwalt attorney Tom Kelly said ``there was
a negligent failure to test the tank for structural integrity.'' He
said Pennwalt has since moved its caustic chemical tanks away from
the waterway and surrounded them with a dike.
   In May, Pennwalt agreed to plead guilty to five misdemeanor
counts after criminal charges against four company officials,
including three executives, were dropped. Tuttle was not charged.
The company also agreed to pay a $500,000 fine and to create a
$600,000 trust fund to pay for environmental improvements in the
Tacoma area.
   The plea agreement covered two counts of negligently failing to
maintain adequate storage tanks, two of discharging pollutants and
one of failing to promptly report the spill to the Coast Guard.
   Twice, however, Tanner refused to accept guilty pleas from
attorneys and lower ranking executives of Pennwalt, demanding
instead that the ``top man'' appear before him.
   Marshall has said the case is among the first in which the
government based its prosecution on corporate negligence rather
than deliberate wrongdoing.
   It may also be the first instance in which a corporate executive
has been ordered to plead the guilt of the corporation, said David
Skover, professor of civil procedure and constitutional law at the
University of Puget Sound Law School.
   After the hearing, Tuttle declined to speculate on whether
leaders of other companies might find themselves in a similar
situation.
   ``The decision to come out here was not dictated by legal
considerations,'' Tuttle said. ``We just thought that this was the
best way to bring this situation in Tacoma to a satisfactory
conclusion. How other companies or other CEOs are going to react I
really have no way of knowing.''
   Tanner repeatedly asked Tuttle who would be accountable for the
spill and for preventing a recurrence.
   ``I'm here to tell you that as chief executive officer of
Pennwalt that I'm here to represent Pennwalt and say that Pennwalt
is responsible,'' Tuttle said.

   Cupcake, the pony whose errant hoof
disrupted service on the Long Island Rail Road, now has another
tale of whoa.
   LIRR officials are demanding a $2,625 payment for the buses it
was forced to hire to get commuters to their destinations when the
pony's hoof was stuck between train tracks in December, setting off
a two-hour delay.
   Railroad officials said in a letter this week to Cupcake's owner
that if she did not pay the expenses within 30 days they would take
her to court.
   The iron horse can wait until the cows come home, said owner
Anne Eggers of Amagansett. She's not paying.
   ``I think this is a very high and mighty way to handle what
happened,'' said Mrs. Eggers who owns two other ponies. ``This is
outrageous.''
   Cupcake, 19, escaped during the night from the barn in the
Eggers' backyard. ``We had just built a new barn and apparently the
latch was faulty,'' said Mrs. Eggers.
   Cupcake trotted over to the railroad tracks, a few miles away,
where his hoof got stuck. The Eggers were called early in the
morning and told their horse was stalling train traffic.
   ``When we got there Cupcake looked so sad,'' said Mrs. Eggers.
``His head was slumped down and he looked like he had just given up
any chance of ever being free again.''
   A veterinarian injected the horse with a sedative. Rescue
workers then picked him up by his tail, lifting him uninjured from
the railroad ties.
   ``What happened was not our fault, not Cupcake's fault,'' said
Mrs. Eggers. ``There is just no way we are going to pay for this.''
   ``We think Cupcake is getting a bad rap,'' she said.
   LIRR spokesman Michael Charles said he regrets what happened to
Cupcake, but the owner should have kept him on her property.
   ``This is a unique case'' because there is a horse involved,
Charles said. He said the railroad often seeks payment from people
who disrupt service, such as motorists who damage crossing gates by
driving through them.

   A Mennonite who voluntarily confessed to
fellow worshipers that he had molested several children was fatally
shot by his 24-year-old son, state police said.
   The body of Gerard James Engel, 47, was found in his living room
Tuesday morning with a single wound to the head-neck area, police
said. Hours later state police arrested Perry Michael Engel of Gap.
   The son was arraigned before District Justice Arden I. Kopp on a
charge of homicide and jailed without bail. Police would not
comment Wednesday on a motive or on any criminal investigation of
the father.
   A mother of two children who allegedly were molested said a
state trooper was investigating the reports last week.
   Engel's employer, David Glick of Atglen Gas Service, said
Engel's youngest son, Eric, 12, telephoned him Tuesday morning.
   ``He said, `Dad won't be at work today.' I asked him if his
father was sick. Finally he told me that someone had shot his
father.
   ``He said he hadn't called an ambulance or the police. So I
dialed the 911 number and asked for an ambulance,'' Glick said.
   In the arrest warrant affidavit, Eric Engel told state police
that his brother, Perry, arrived at the home Tuesday morning,
shotgun in hand.
   The 12-year-old told police that as he walked out of the living
room _ leaving Perry and Gerard Engel alone _ the shooting occurred.
   A unidentified church leader was quoted in the Lancaster New Era
newspaper Wednesday as saying that about three weeks ago, Engel
voluntarily confessed to sexually molesting several children.
   Engel was excommunicated, the church leader said, and taken
later to a psychiatrist.

   Morris A. Shenker, an attorney best known for
defending Teamster boss Jimmy Hoffa, has died. He was 82.
   A spokesman said Shenker, who had recently undergone heart
surgery and who wore a pacemaker, died Tuesday night in Santa
Monica, Calif., where he had been visiting his daughter. He had
been hospitalized for a few days with pneumonia.
   Shenker, a Russian immigrant who grew up in north St. Louis,
made a name for himself as a young lawyer by doing free legal work
for the poor and getting involved in Democratic politics.
   Hoffa, his most famous client, had links to organized crime,
disappeared years ago and is presumed dead.
   Because of his Teamsters connection, Shenker, who operated the
Dunes Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas in the 1970s, ran afoul of the
Nevada Gaming Commission.
   Despite state and federal investigations, however, Shenker
escaped indictment until this year.
   In February, a federal grand jury accused him of conspiring to
conceal hundreds of thousands of dollars from the Internal Revenue
Service and bankruptcy creditors. Shenker denied any wrongdoing.
   Shenker filed for bankruptcy in 1984 and had been involved in
court battles over his finances ever since.
   Survivors include a daughter, Patty Shenker Stoll, of Santa
Monica, Calif.; a son, Arthur Shenker, of Las Vegas, and two
granddaughters.
   Services were scheduled Sunday at Temple Israel in St. Louis.

<HEAD>Members of Congress Ask President to Resolve Monkey Dispute</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Forty-one members of Congress on Wednesday
sent a letter asking President Bush to intervene in a long-running
dispute over the fate of nine research monkeys.
   The ``Silver Spring monkeys,'' named after the Maryland suburb
where the primates were confiscated by police from a research
laboratory in 1981, currently are being held in a Covington, La.,
research center.
   The House members asked Bush to direct the Department of Health
and Human Services to transfer the monkeys to a primate sanctuary.
The department includes the National Institutes of Health, which
has custody of the monkeys.
   Rep. Robert C. Smith, R-N.H., who circulated the letter, said he
and others in Congress have worked unsuccessfully for three years
on a compromise with animal-rights groups and NIH. Although
animal-rights groups agreed to a proposal for most of the monkeys
to be sent to a santuary, NIH refused, he said.
   NIH says three of the monkeys have deteriorated to the point
that ``human considerations dictate euthanasia.'' The three were
scheduled for euthanasia last December, NIH said, but a Louisiana
state court issued a restraining order stopping the action at the
request of animal-rights groups.
   People Protecting Primates, a coalition of 80 organizations,
applauded the letter, calling the monkeys ``political prisoners,
symbolic of the debate over animal testing.''
   NIH had no comment, said spokesman Robert Schreiber.

   Officials at two airports assessed millions of
dollars in damage Wednesday after a storm packing winds of 99 miles
per hour scattered private aircraft like toys.
   Sixty-four planes were damaged _ 42 at McCarran International
Airport here and 22 at Sky Harbor Airport in nearby Henderson _
when hurricane-force wind ripped through the Las Vegas Valley on
Tuesday evening. Ten aircraft were heavily damaged or destroyed at
McCarran; 13 were destroyed at Sky Harbor.
   No injuries were reported.
   No commercial aircraft were damaged although some commercial
flights were barred from taking off or landing until the storm
passed, McCarran spokeswoman Vicki Donaldson said.
   Damage was ``well into the millions'' and could reach as high as
$14 million, Ms. Donaldson said. Damage also was estimated in the
millions at Sky Harbor.
   Two aircraft used by Scenic Airlines Inc. for Grand Canyon tours
were blown into each other. The roof of the Scenic terminal, on the
northern edge of the sprawling McCarran field, suffered heavy
damage.
   A hangar belonging to Circus Circus Enterprises was nearly
demolished, with one private jet left resting atop another.
   One airplane was blown some 200 feet at McCarran, airport
spokesman Sam Ingalls said. A number of aircraft were flipped, and
two corporate hangars were destroyed, he added.
   A large door on a hangar housing a $1 million Lockheed jet
belonging to entertainer Wayne Newton was blown away but the jet
was undamaged.
   ``We have no idea where the door went,'' one of Newton's pilots,
Mike Cotton, said Wednesday.
   Damage at the airports was the only significant loss reported.
There was some minor flooding and downed power lines, police
spokesman Matt Alberto said. About 35,000 homes and businesses were
without power for a period.
   Some residents were rattled by the fierce wind and rain.
   ``It was out of control. We could not see out of the windows of
our agency,'' said Karen Kerr, who was working at Golden Valley
Travel. ``The winds were blowing so hard. All of our phones and
electricity was out for about three hours.''
   National Weather Service instruments recorded winds up to 90
miles per hour before lightning knocked out service at about 6 p.m.
That is the highest windspeed recorded in the Las Vegas Valley,
said Charlie Schlott of the weather service's airport office.
   George Feick, supervisor of the Federal Aviation
Administration's control tower at McCarran, said FAA equipment
registered one gust at 99 mph.
   ``I've been here a few years and that's the highest windspeed
I've ever seen,'' Feick said. ``It was pretty nasty, the tower was
swaying quite a bit.''

   America's ambassador to Iceland and his wife
were robbed at gunpoint Wednesday in their Waldorf-Astoria hotel
suite of more than $35,000 in jewelry, police said.
   Ambassador Nicholas Ruwe, 55, and his wife, Nancy, were not
injured, police spokesman Officer Joseph Gallagher said.
   The robber, dressed in a light gray suit, told the couple he was
a hotel security guard when they opened the door to their suite at
12:45 p.m., Gallagher said.
   Once the door was open, the bandit showed a handgun, forced the
couple into the bedroom and ordered them to sit on the floor and
cover themselves with a blanket while he searched the room.
   The robber fled with two of Mrs. Ruwe's rings _ one valued at
$35,000 _ and the ambassador's $300 wristwatch, Gallagher said.
   Coincidentally, President Bush announced Ruwe's successor on
Wednesday. He plans to nominate Charles E. Cobb Jr. to replace him.
Ruwe was appointed ambassador to Iceland in July 1985 and resigned
with the change of administrations.

<HEAD>Police Say Woman Tried to Inject Cocaine Before Giving Birth</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ST. PAUL, Minn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A woman was discovered trying to inject
herself with cocaine in a delivery room minutes before giving birth
to a premature boy, police said.
   Gayle Turenne, 31, was charged Wednesday in a warrant with one
count of possession of cocaine, said Lt. Jim Singer. St. Paul
police could not say whether she had been arrested by Wednesday
night.
   ``The woman needs help. We hope we can do something about it,''
Singer said, adding that Turenne has been referred to Ramsey County
Community Human Services for evaluation.
   She had been taken by ambulance to United Hospital while in
labor Saturday morning, police spokesman Paul Adelmann said.
   A nurse noticed her inserting a hypodermic syringe into her
wrist and stopped her before the drug was injected, he said. Five
minutes later, she delivered a five-week premature boy.
   Turenne, who has three other children, was discharged from the
hospital Monday.
   Doctors had ordered a search of the woman's suitcase and purse,
which yielded three packets of cocaine, a bag of marijuana and drug
paraphernalia, police said.
   The baby remained hospitalized, hospital spokeswoman Carol
Hobart said, but she declined to comment on the child's condition.
   Under a state law that took effect Aug. 1, doctors are required
to report to county child protection officials evidence of use of
illegal drugs by pregnant women or the presence of drugs in the
systems of newborn babies. The law defines a positive drug test of
a newborn as proof of child neglect.
   Doctors say pregnant women who use cocaine place themselves at a
greater risk of miscarriage and premature birth and their babies
are more susceptible to sudden infant death syndrome and erratic
and violent behavior as toddlers.

<HEAD>Another Day Of Record Lows, Thunderstorms Develop Across West</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Temperatures slid to record lows in 23 states Wednesday from the
Plains to the East Coast, and thunderstorms buffeted Florida,
causing some damage.
   More than 70 cities reported record or record-tying lows, mostly
in the 40s and 50s although states along the Gulf of Mexico posted
record lows in the 60s. Apalachicola, Fla., tied its record of 71.
   Low-temperature records were broken or tied in Alabama,
Arkansas, Connecticut, Delaware, Florida, Georgia, Kansas,
Kentucky, Louisiana, Maryland, Mississippi, Missouri, Nebraska, New
York, North Carolina, Ohio, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, South Carolina,
Tennessee, Texas, Virginia, West Virginia, and the District of
Columbia.
   Strong thunderstorms erupted across Florida during the
afternoon. Thunderstorm wind damaged a house at Jensen Beach and a
gust to 68 mph was clocked at Daytona Beach, the National Weather
Service said.
   Gusts reached 55 mph in the West Palm Beach area and a
thunderstorm dropped small hail and 1.66 inches of rain in one hour
at Gainesville.
   Strong showers and thunderstorms developed across the
Intermountain region _ between the Sierra Nevada and the Rockies _
where Las Vegas, Nev., suffered damage from high wind up to 99 mph
late Tuesday.
   Flash flood watches were posted for Utah, southern and
east-central Nevada, and western Wyoming.
   Showers and thunderstorms also were scattered across parts of
the Northwest and west-central Plains and along the lower Texas
coast.
   Rain was scattered over eastern sections of the Carolinas and
Georgia, where Hinesville got 1.30 inches of rain in the six hours
up to 2 p.m. EDT.
   Temperatures around the nation at 3 p.m. EDT ranged from 57
degrees at Arcata, Calif., to 107 at Palm Springs, Calif.
Wednesday's low for the Lower 48 states was 39 at Bradford, Pa.,
and Lewisburg, W.Va.
   For Thursday, showers and thunderstorms were forecast over the
southern Atlantic Coast states, with rain likely over much of
Virginia, Delaware and Maryland. Scattered showers and
thunderstorms were forecast across the northern and central Rockies
to western sections of the northern and central Plains, and from
southeastern Louisiana to Alabama. Widely scattered thunderstorms
were forecast over New Mexico, and western sections of Texas and
Oklahoma. Scattered showers were forecast over southeastern
Pennsylvania and New Jersey.
   Highs in the 70s and lower 80s were predicted from the Great
Lakes across the upper Ohio Valley and the northern and middle
Atlantic Coastal states to the Carolinas, and along the Pacific
Coast and over Washington state; highs above 100 were predicted
over the desert Southwest; and in the 80s and 90s across much of
the rest of the nation.

<TEXT>
   Indian and Pakistani border troops traded
fire last week in a dispute about a new road on India's side, and
intermittent skirmishes have occurred since, officials said
Wednesday.
   A Pakistani Defense Ministry spokesman in Islamabad said he
could not confirm the report, but added: ``It's a common
occurrence, the exchange of fire along this border.''
   P.C. Dogra, commander of the Border Security Force, said there
were no casualties on the Indian side. He said the initial skirmish
in the Ramgarh sector of Jammu-Kashmir state, along the northern
border, began Friday when Pakistani soldiers fired on Indian troops
building the road.
   Rice paddies spread into both countries along that stretch of
border, which is dotted with bunkers of the two armies.
   ``Now, no one is allowed to go within 100 meters of the border,
not even the farmers who plow their fields up to the last inch of
the Indian land during normal times,'' Dogra said.
   India and Pakistan have fought three wars since the subcontinent
became independent of Britain in 1947. Two of the wars, in 1965 and
1971, were over border disputes in Jammu-Kashmir state that still
are unresolved.
   Pakistan claims part of the state and the disputed territory
begins about 30 miles north of Ramgarh, where the road is being
built.
   Residents said about 100 families totaling more than 700 people
had left the area since the shooting began.
   Dhoru Ram of Dagh village said he sent his family to Jammu, 20
miles to the north, after his hut came under fire Sunday and his
water buffalo was killed.
   ``I will stay here as long as my fields are here,'' he said.
   A bus driver named Bitta said he had not seen ``such fright and
panic among the people of the area'' since the 1971 war.
   Bitta said he had made several trips from Dagh and neighboring
Narayanpur village, transporting ``panicky families'' to the
interior. He said about 100 families had left.
   A state government spokesman, who cannot be identified under
briefing rules, said the people of all 25 villages in the sector
would be moved to safer areas if a serious conflict with Pakistan
began.
   He said under the contingency plan, each family would be given
10,000 rupees ($606), and free food and accommodation in schools
and government buildings elsewhere.

<TEXT>
   The New York Convention and Visitors Bureau
apologized Wednesday to the Bronx borough president for posting a
flyer that promised a tour of Fort Apache and ``the Burnout
Wilderness'' in the South Bronx.
   The flyer had been ``brought in for display by this private
sightseeing company and unfortunately was one of those things that
slipped through,'' said Jack MacBean, spokesman for the Visitors
Bureau.
   In a letter to Marshall Murdaugh, president of the Visitors
Bureau, borough President Fernando Ferrer protested against the
flyer ``on behalf of the Bronx Zoo, the Botanical Garden, the
Yankees and the more than 1.2 million residents of the borough of
parks and universities.''
   He also expressed fear that the flyer could deter potential
investors from continuing their rehabilitation efforts in parts of
the Bronx where housing was abandoned or burned down in the late
1970s and early 1980s.
   ``Aren't you aware,'' Ferrer wrote, ``that more than 16,000 new
units of housing are being created here, most of them in the South
Bronx? And that unfortunate characterization of the 41st Police
Precinct as Fort Apache is a wornout cliche that no longer holds
true.''
   Murdaugh apologized for the flyer and said the Visitors Bureau
promotes ``the Bronx in all of our publications in extremely
positive terms.''
   The 41st Precinct's nickname of Fort Apache was popularized in a
movie starring Paul Newman called ``Fort Apache, the Bronx.''

   Authorities reported 22 arrests at the
Nevada Test Site on Wednesday as anti-nuclear demonstrators marked
the 44th anniversary of the atomic bombing of Nagasaki.
   Three men were arrested when they walked into an office of Los
Alamos National Laboratory in Mercury, a tiny base camp containing
offices and housing for test site workers. Los Alamos is one of two
national laboratories that prepare nuclear weapons tests.
   The three, who were not identified, were being held by Nye
County authorities on federal trespass charges, according to Darwin
Morgan, an Energy Department spokesman in Las Vegas.
   Morgan said the three apparently hiked several miles across the
desert to Mercury.
   Nineteen protesters were arrested on misdemeanor trespass
charges when they crossed a cattle guard on a road leading to
Mercury. They were cited and released, Morgan said. They were part
of a group of 34 protesters who gathered at the test site entrance
shortly after dawn Wednesday to commemorate the Nagasaki bombing
Aug. 9, 1945.
   Morgan said the demonstration was ``peaceful and calm.''
   In Moorestown, N.J., 15 anti-nuclear activists also marked the
Nagasaki anniversary by staging a peaceful demonstration at General
Electric Co.'s weapons facility. There were no arrests.
   The Swarthmore, Pa.-based Brandywine Peace Community held a
``litany of remembrance'' service in front of the company's Aegis
Navy Combat System Engineering building, which is often the target
of protests.
   In Mercury, 52 demonstrators were arrested at the site Sunday in
a similar demonstration marking the anniversary of the atomic
bombing of Hiroshima.
   The Nevada Desert Experience, a Las Vegas-based anti-nuclear
group, holds demonstrations annually marking the anniversary of the
bombing of the two Japanese cities _ an action that brought World
War II to an end.

<HEAD>Greek Parliament To Probe Procurement of Military Planes, Missiles</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ATHENS, Greece (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Parliament on Wednesday began action to
investigate purported kickbacks during the Socialist administration
of former Premier Andreas Papandreou in procuring 80 U.S. and
French jet fighter planes.
   It approved formation of a 12-member fact-finding commission to
determine whether enough evidence exists to justify a full
investigation by a parliamentary committee.
   The probe involves 40 F-16s and 40 French-made Mirage 2000s and
300 Magic II missiles. Conservatives proposed the investigation
following allegations that Greek taxpayers paid many millions of
dollars more than they should have.
   When Papandreou's Panhellenic Socialist Movement decided to buy
the French and American built aircraft after first coming to power
in 1981, negotiations began between the governments.
   The F-16s were to be bought through U.S. military credits, and a
letter of intent was signed in 1984. Greece receives $500 million
in U.S. military credits a year.
   Negotiations broke down and the socialist government came into
direct contact with General Dynamics. It later signed a contract
for the F-16s following what was billed as a ``political decision''
by Papandreou.
   The Mirage deal was signed earlier after Papandreou announced he
made the decision following direct negotiations with
Dassault-Breguet of France.
   Papandreou said direct agreement with the manufacturer
eliminated middlemen and helped keep the total price lower.
   The government-to-manufacturer negotiations raised questions at
the time since the aircraft's unit price was reportedly much higher
than what the same firms quoted to other countries. The government
said the aircraft contained additional sophisticated electronics
that greatly boosted the unit cost.
   Conservative New Democracy leader Constantine Mitsotakis said
Tuesday in parliamentary debate that his party considered the
purchase the ``biggest scandal'' in the socialists' eight-year
administration and Papandreou's ``biggest political mistake.''
   The 70-year-old Papandreou is recuperating from a kidney ailment
and is also honeymooning with his 35-year-old bride. He was not
present in Parliament to reply to the charges. He has not appeared
during debates on scandals in which his former government was
allegedly involved before losing June 18 general elections.
   Government spokesman Athanasios Kanelopoulos said last week it
was unlikely the parliamentary commission would seek information
from the aircraft manufacturers during the probe.
   In March 1985, a spokesman for Papandreou's government said $2
billion would be spent on the 80 jets. In January 1987, the
purchase price of the 40 F-16s was given by Greece as $940 million.

<HEAD>Moscow Urges Accord On Nuclear Testing This Year</HEAD>
<DATELINE>GENEVA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Soviet arms control negotiator on Wednesday
called on the United States to agree to monitoring measures for
underground nuclear weapons testing by the end of the year.
   Igor Palenykh, Moscow's chief envoy to the superpower nuclear
testing talks, said the United States is moving ``too slowly'' on
the issue and urged Washington to respond to a Soviet proposal.
   He called for the talks to be wrapped up this year.
   A six-week round of negotiations that ended Tuesday produced
agreement on some ``important technical aspects'' for possible
inclusion in a testing accord, Palenykh told a news conference.
   The talks are to set verification provisions and secure U.S.
Senate approval for two 1970s unratified superpower nuclear accords.
   But negotiations stalled over the monitoring techniques for
atomic weapons tests, Palenykh said.
   U.S. negotiator C. Paul Robinson has said ``high-level
decisions'' in the two capitals will be needed during the recess to
move them along.
   No date was set for resuming the testing talks. The next phase
of negotiations will focus on a nuclear test ban.
   Palenykh said he hoped Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard
Shevardnadze and U.S. Scecretary of State James A. Baker III would
discuss the testing accord at their Sept. 19-20 meeting in the
United States.
   The Soviet proposal would allow use of both remote seismic or
on-the-spot monitoring for ``any explosion starting from a certain
threshold.'' He did not specify the threshold Palenykh said.
   ``We favor the idea of combining various methods of
verification. Of course it will be the right of each side to use
the methods in its own combination,'' he said.
   He said Washington wants to use only an on-site method in which
blasts are measured by a cable placed down a hole near the
explosion site. The United States says its method is the most
accurate.
   The Soviets say remote monitoring of the shock waves is precise
enough, simpler and less expensive.
   The talks are to establish verification provisions for the
unratified 1974 Threshold Test Ban Treaty for nuclear weapons tests
and the 1976 Peaceful Nuclear Explosions Treaty on non-military
blasts.
   Both limit the power of explosions to 150 kilotons, the
equivalent of 150,000 tons of TNT.
   The Senate rejected the original accords, arguing they could not
be enforced. Most military analysts agree, however, that both sides
have generally abided by the limits.

   Police stood guard Wednesday at an apartment
building where an anti-drug crusader was killed, and her husband
spent the day testifying against a man she had accused of selling
cocaine.
   Fearful neighbors said they would remain quiet because of
violent drug dealers.
   ``You open your mouth and try to help out and see what
happens,'' says one man, sitting on a stoop down the street from
where the Hernandez family lives.
   Maria Hernandez, a 34-year-old mother of three, was getting
ready to go to work about 4:30 a.m. Tuesday when at least five
shots were fired through the closed bedroom windows of her
first-floor apartment in the Bushwick section of Brooklyn.
   One of the bullets hit her in the head and she died a few hours
later at Wyckoff Hospital.
   Her husband, Carlos Hernandez, 33, testified Wednesday before a
grand jury against his neighbor, Raymond Gonzalez, who allegedly
stabbed him in the arm and threatened him with an Uzi machine gun
last month after Mrs. Hernandez accused Gonzalez of selling cocaine
in front of their home.
   Neighbors say the couple often chased drug dealers off their
property.
   The shots were fired through heavy drapes, but Chief of Brooklyn
Detectives Francis X. Smith said he believed the shots were not
meant as a warning.
   ``If you shoot into a lit residence when people are inside, I
have to assume it was meant to hurt someone,'' he said.
   Asked Tuesday if he planned to stop his anti-drug efforts,
Hernandez said, ``Never.''
   A patrol car had been driving past the three-story house about
once an hour since Saturday because the family had received death
threats from drug dealers.
   Detectives went door-to-door Wednesday, but a police spokesman,
Sgt. Maurice Howard, said, ``They haven't narrowed it down to any
specific suspects.''
   ``She's trying to protect her neighborhood, her kids,'' said
Marguerite Wise, who lives around the corner and knew the family
because their children were good friends. ``That woman never hurt
anybody.''
   She said she was angered by the drug dealers that plague the
neighborhood, but is afraid to complain to police.
   ``On my block I see what goes on but I shut up,'' she said.
``I'm afraid for my life and my kids.''
   While women with baby carriages and children congregated in
front of the Hernandez's apartment, a block away a half-dozen or
more drug dealers impassively continued their trade, selling heroin
under brand names like ``Terror'' and ``Steel Ball.''
   A police cruiser stopped at the intersection and two officers
bolted out, hands on their holsters, and headed toward a group of
men huddled together.
   The men ran in all directions and the police nabbed only one,
who had a pocketful of cash but no drugs, and so was let go.
   Less than an hour later, the heroin hawkers were back.
   ``It's wheeling, dealing over here,'' the man sitting on his
stoop said. He declined to give his name, saying he was afraid the
dealers would come after him, even though he lives in Queens and
was only visiting relatives.
   ``If I can notice it, what's their problem?'' he asked,
referring to the police.
   The two officers assigned to guard the home said they realize
what's going on around them, just out of sight, but said they don't
have the answers.
   ``Drugs is a way of life around here,'' one said, speaking on
condition that his name not be used. ``This is an every day thing.''
   ``The drug problem's one thing, but the violence has gotten
worse, even toward police officers,'' his partner said.

   Hundreds of demonstrators threw stones at
police Wednesday during a protest demanding that Union Carbide get
out of India. Police responded with tear gas, and 25 people were
injured and 500 arrested.
   The protest took place outside the Union Carbide Research and
Development Center in Bhopal. Union Carbide's Indian subsidiary
operated the Bhopal pesticide plant, where a gas leak in 1984
killed more than 3,400 people.
   The Union Carbide plant in Bhopal has not opened since the gas
leak, but the protesters demanded that the Danbury, Conn.-based
multinational shut down its remaining Indian operations. They
include a Bombay plant that makes batteries.
   Gas victims, opposition politicians and activists had designated
today the start of ``Union Carbide Quit India'' week.
   Exactly 47 years ago, on Aug. 9, 1942, Mohandas K. Gandhi
launched India's campaign for independence from Britain with a
``Quit India Day.''
   Bhopal observed a general strike today called by opposition
parties and activists to press demands for more compensation for
survivors of the gas leak, the world's deadliest industrial
disaster.
   Public transportation operated, but shops and businesses were
closed.
   About 200 police were deployed outside the Union Carbide
research center to keep out protesters. When some demonstrators
threw stones, police responded by firing tear gas shells and
lashing out with their lathis, long bamboo batons tipped with steel.
   Several people in the crowd received bloody noses, and some
appeared to have broken bones.
   Police vans rushed many of the injured to hospitals. At least
five policemen were among the injured.
   Abdul Jabbar Khan, leader of the Bhopal Gas Tragedy Women's
Organization, lost consciousness as police beat him with their
bamboo batons. Khan had said earlier the protesters would try to
take over the research center.
   ``We want Union Carbide to be prohibited from continuing its
business in India and all industries owned by the killer
multinational to be handed over to the workers,'' he said.
   The protesters denounced the $470 million settlement reached in
February between Union Carbide and the government as compensation
for the gas leak. Opponents say it is not enough.

   Brigitte Bardot, complaining that her
dogs are banned from beaches infested with mediocre, dirty,
ill-bred tourists, is threatening to quit the Riviera resort she
helped make famous.
   The former movie star, known as the ``sex kitten'' in the 1950s
and '60s, said the ban on dogs on the beach was ``an insult to my
combat'' in favor of animal rights.
   ``Shamelessness, exhibitionism, vice, cash, homosexuality have
become the sad and degrading symbols of the village for which you
are responsible,'' she wrote to Mayor Alain Spada in an open letter
dated Aug. 3. ``Each year, as summer arrives, I have to flee
earlier and earlier the invasion of tourists who are more and more
numerous, mediocre, dirty, ill-bred and without shame.''
   Spada said Tuesday he thought the actress ``has completely lost
her head.''
   ``Because we won't let her dogs relieve themselves on the beach,
she calls us all kinds of names.''

<HEAD>Teen-ager Killed; Family Claims No Riots in Area</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BELFAST, Northern Ireland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A teen-ager was reported killed
by a police plastic bullet during a night of riots in Belfast, but
family and friends claimed Wednesday there was no rioting in that
area.
   The riots marked the anniversary of a British policy, since
abandoned, of detaining terrorism suspects without trial.
   British news reports said Seamus Duffy, 15, died after being
struck by a plastic bullet fired by security forces trying to
control young supporters of the outlawed Irish Republican Army.
   The Royal Ulster Constabulary, the province's police force, said
Wednesday plastic bullets had been fired in self-defense, to
protect property and curb rioters.
   Duffy's family and friends denied there was rioting in the
Dawson Street neighborhood where he was hit.
   Police said crowds in Roman Catholic areas of west Belfast threw
stones and gasoline bombs, lit bonfires and burned British flags.
They reported more than 20 arrests.
   ``While it must be emphasized that the circumstances of Seamus
Duffy's death have yet to be established, the RUC nevertheless
regrets this loss of young life,'' said police statement issued
Wednesday.
   ``The RUC emphasizes once again they have no desire whatsoever
to use plastic baton rounds. If there is no rioting, there will be
no plastic baton rounds.''
   Damien Brown, a 15-year-old friend of the victim, said they were
walking along a street and saw no rioting. ``I heard a shot, looked
back and Seamus was on the ground,'' he said.
   Brendan Duffy, the dead boy's father, accused police of
``opening fire for no reason at all.''
   Northern Ireland Secretary Peter Brooke defended use of the
plastic bullets and said, ``There is no grounds for suggesting
their use last night was other than in accordance with the law.''
   Brian Feeney of the Social Democratic and Labor Party, the
largest predominantly Roman Catholic party in the province, said
plastic bullets were inaccurate, lethal weapons.
   ``Plastic bullets are not used as a last resort; in most cases
in these circumstances they are used as the first resort,'' Feeney
said on Ulster Radio.
   Ireland's government expressed ``deep concern'' about the boy's
death. The British news agency Press Association quoted an official
source as saying Ireland would request a report on the matter.
   Government figures show police fired 54,234 plastic rounds from
the time they replaced rubber bullets in 1975 through June 14.
Press Association said 16 people, half of them under age 16, had
been killed by plastic bullets before Duffy died.
   Sinn Fein, the IRA's legal political wing, issued a statement
blaming the death on provocation by security forces.
   The street violence marked Britain's introduction Aug. 9, 1971,
of a policy of interning suspects in Northern Ireland without
trial. IRA supporters, the main targets, continue to mark the
anniversary even though the policy was abandoned in 1975 following
worldwide criticism.
   The mainly Catholic IRA is fighting to drive Britain from
Northern Ireland and unite the Protestant-dominated province with
the Irish Republic, which is overwhelmingly Catholic.

   Lyon, France's second-largest city,
won the right Wednesday to be the host for the 1990 World Chess
Championship final.
   Delegates to the International Chess Federation's annual
conference were to have voted on bids submitted by Lyon and
Wellington, the capital of New Zealand, but John Poole, president
of the New Zealand Chess Federation, announced he was withdrawing
the bid.
   Poole acted after being called to the conference stage for a
private discussion with the president of the International Chess
Federation, Florencio Campomanes of the Philippines.
   He said Campomanes suggested he withdraw New Zealand's bid. ``He
was implying very strongly withdrawal with grace or be thrown
out,'' Poole said in an interview.
   Earlier, David Anderton of England, a member of the federation's
executive council, questioned a stipulation by New Zealand that its
bid was conditional on the participation of world champion Garri
Kasparov.
   The 26-year-old Soviet has said privately he might not defend
his title in a match organized solely by the International Chess
Federation, known by its French acronym FIDE.
   On Tuesday, conference delegates voted to deny players any say
in the choice of venue for the chess final and gave FIDE the power
to replace a player who refused to accept match conditions.
   The rule changes grew out of a power struggle between FIDE, the
game's governing body, and the Grandmasters' Association, the
player's organization headed by Kasparov, who is its president.
   Gillian Houser of the Wellington Organizing Committee accused
FIDE officials of ``political manipulation'' in choosing the venue
of the chess final _ a 24-game match scheduled for 10 weeks
starting Oct. 7, 1990.
   ``I am extremely disappointed in the manner the bids were
handled by FIDE,'' she said. ``We arrived in Puerto Rico and the
rules were changed.''
   Anderton had also complained that the New Zealand bid was not
accompanied by a banker's draft. Ms. Houser said, however, that the
bid was underwritten by the New Zealand government.
   Boris Spassky, a former Soviet world champion who now plays for
France and represented the Lyon bid, said that while he was pleased
Lyon would be the host, he did not think any venue should be forced
on the players.
   The chairman of the Grandmasters' Association, Bessel Kok of
Belgium, had urged delegates to show more respect for the wishes of
grandmasters and head off a possible rift.
   Canadian delegate Nathan Divinsky said failure to solicit the
players' opinions on match conditions was like organizing a large
wedding without consulting the bride and groom.
   Lyon offered $1.83 million in prize money, plus a winner's
trophy encrusted with diamonds and gold and valued at about $93,000.
   Wellington also offered a prize fund of $1.83 million, plus
about $370,000 for the chess federation's fund to promote the game
in developing countries.
   A bitter feud flared between Campomanes and Kasparov in Moscow
in 1985 when Campomanes halted Kasparov's first title duel with
Anatoly Karpov without result, but leaving Karpov the champion.
   Although trailing, Kasparov had just won two games in a row
while Karpov had failed to secure a victory for 21 games.
   Kasparov repeatedly charged that Campomanes intervened to save
Karpov, a charge Campomanes denies.

<HEAD>Moslem Fundamentalists Attack Christian Shops, 35 Arrested</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CAIRO, Egypt (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Moslem fundamentalists threw firebombs at
Christian-owned shops in a provincial town to avenge an affair
between a Moslem woman and a Christian man, police said Wednesday.
   A police officer said on condition of anonymity that ``many
people'' were injured and 35 were arrested after an unspecified
number of Moslem fundamentalists went on a rampage in northern
Mahmoudeya late Monday. He said he expected 65 more would be
detained.
   No weapons other than the firebombs were used, and police did
not clash with the attackers, the officer said.
   The identities of neither the Moslem woman nor the Christian man
were released.
   The daily state-run Al-Akhbar said Wednesday Moslem extremists
set fire to an appliances store in the Nile Delta town 85 miles
north of Cairo.
   The paper said many of the 35 arrested came from neighboring
towns.
   The police officer said the incident occurred after a Moslem
woman reported her affair with a Christian man to police.
   Friends decided to avenge the woman, who was unable to marry the
Christian man. Egyptian law says a Moslem woman can only marry
someone of her own faith, and the man was apparently unwilling to
convert to Islam to marry her.
   Although the woman consented to the relationship, she was afraid
of her family's reation, the officer said. She asked for
protection, he said.
   In rural areas, there have been reports of fathers killing
daughters who have had sexual liaisons before marriage.
   It was the second incident this year of an attack on Christians
who engage in liaisons with Moslem women. The first occured May 1
in southern Assiut when seven Moslem fundamentalists broke into the
home of a Christian student, killing him and wounding another
Christian man and two Moslem women in the house.

   The captain of a Greek-flagged tanker
that ran aground and spilled 300,000 gallons of heating oil off
Rhode Island in June pleaded innocent Wednesday to two state felony
counts.
   Iakovos Georgudis, 43, was released on $20,000 personal
recognizance by Superior Court Judge Thomas J. Caldarone, said
Thomas Connell, spokesman for the attorney general's office.
   Georgudis was indicted by a state grand jury last month on
charges of polluting coastal waters and failing to have a harbor
pilot aboard the World Prodigy when approaching Narragansett Bay.
He has admitted he erred by failing to wait for a pilot before his
tanker grounded on Brenton Reef on June 23.
   In a related development, a hearing was set for next week in
U.S. District Court in Providence on federal misdemeanor charges
against Georgudis.
   Attorneys for Georgudis and U.S. Attorney Lincoln Almond
declined to comment on whether the hearing before U.S. Judge Ernest
C. Torres next Wednesday would involved a plea bargain Almond
outlined last week.
   ``That's up to the judge as to what comes up,'' said Thomas H.
Walsh, a lawyer for Ballard Shipping Co., which owns the World
Prodigy.
   On Friday, Almond said a plea bargain was being discussed that
would involve one misdemeanor charge each against the captain and
Ballard Shipping, which has not been charged with anything.
   Walsh attended a closed conference Wednesday with the judge.
Neither he, Almond nor Georgudis' attorney, Peter DiBiase, would
say what the session was about. DiBiase also declined Wednesday to
comment on the plea agreement.
   Georgudis is free on $50,000 bail on two federal pollution
charges. As a condition of that bail he was required to surrender
his passport and remain in Rhode Island, Massachusetts or New York.
   Almond would not identify the penalties that the government
planned on recommending in the federal plea. Each of the charges
carries a potential one-year jail term and fines totaling twice the
cleanup costs.
   Georgudis faces a maximum of $20,000 in fines and 13 months in
jail if convicted of the state charges.

<TEXT>
   Robert F. Jani, producer of
such spectaculars as the U.S. Bicentennial celebration in New York
Harbor in 1976 and halftime for football's Super Bowl, has died at
the age of 55.
   He died Sunday at his home here after a three-year struggle with
amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, known as Lou Gehrig's disease, said
a spokesman for his firm, Robert F. Jani Productions.
   Jani also staged much of the live entertainment that has become
standard fare at Disneyland and Disney World, where he worked for
11 years.
   He was also a consultant on master plans for Euro Disneyland,
which opens in 1992, and the new Disney-MGM Studio Tour at Walt
Disney World in Florida.
   In 1978, after he left Disney, he produced the revival of Radio
City Music Hall's ``Magnificent Christmas Spectacular.'' He was in
charge of all live stage productions at the New York City theater
from 1979 to '82 and was credited with its revitalization after a
long period of decline.
   Jani also staged the 1983 Super Bowl entertainment in which
spectators amazed themselves and a national television audience by
spontaneously hoisting 103,000 synchronized flash cards, filling
the Rose Bowl with bright rainbows. It was believed to be the
biggest stunt-card spectacular of all time.
   He drafted the master plan but did not stage the opening and
closing ceremonies at the 1984 Los Angeles Olympics. That contract
eventually went to David L. Wolper.
   In 1981, Jani produced ``The Glory of Christmas,'' with a cast
of 400 and a small menagerie of animals at the Crystal Cathedral in
Garden Grove.
   Survivors include his wife, mother, daughter and son. A memorial
service was held Monday at the Rolling Hills Covenant Church in
Rolling Hills Estates.

<HEAD>24,000 Gather in Remembrance of Atom Bombing</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   About 24,000 people on Wednesday mourned
the victims of the world's largest atom bomb used against humans
and called for Japan to strengthen its ban on nuclear warheads.
   In Nagasaki's Peace Park, the crowd commemorated the day 44
years ago when the United States dropped an atom bomb on this
western coastal city.
   The world's first atomic attack had been carried out three days
earlier in Hiroshima, killing 140,000 people. The bomb that hit
Nagasaki, dubbed ``Fat Man,'' was more powerful. But because of the
city's many hills, the damage was contained and 70,000 died, more
than half the population.
   The city's call for stepped-up enforcement of a national policy
banning nuclear warheads, including those on U.S. ships at Japanese
ports, may command the attention of the government now that the
governing Liberal Democrats have been weakened by a series of
scandals and unpopular policies.
   Under the 1951 U.S.-Japan Security Treaty, the United States
pledges to notify Japan if it plans to bring nuclear arms into the
country. Japan says the United States has never consulted with it,
and so it believes such weapons have not entered Japan.
   Critics charge the government uses the agreement to avoid the
question of whether U.S. ships dock in the country with nuclear
weapons aboard.
   ``It is a government's duty to its citizens to strive to shed
light upon the truth, not to wait passively for prior
explanations,'' said Mayor Hitoshi Motoshima, an independent.
   Socialist Party Chairwoman Takako Doi said recently that if a
Socialist government were formed after the next election for the
lower house of Parliament, it would advocate checking all U.S.
ships that enter Japanese waters for nuclear weapons.
   In elections last month, the governing Liberal Democrats lost
their majority in the upper house.
   The disclosure in May that a U.S. hydrogen bomb was lost near an
island in southernmost Japan 24 years ago stirred anger among
citizens and opposition politicians. After investigating, the
government last month said the area had normal radiation levels and
was safe.

<TEXT>
   President Bush, expressing concern that he
might ``miss some subtlety'' in signals from Iran's new leadership,
said Wednesday he is determined to pursue every diplomatic avenue
to free American hostages without ``trading off or negotiating.''
   Bush, in a question and answer session with reporters, reminded
Iran of his Inauguration Day message that ``goodwill will beget
goodwill'' and said he could send no ``clearer signal'' of his
interest to win the release of American hostages and forge a new
relationship with Tehran.
   The president said the lives of the hostages are ``too precious
for me to be sticking my head in the sand and miss some subtlety in
this highly complicated corner of the world.''
   His comments were the latest turn in a series of remarks by Bush
and Iran's new president, Hashemi Rafsanjani, both of whom have
used public forums in recent days to discuss the international
diplomatic stirrings aimed at freeing the western hostages held in
Beirut.
   On Tuesday, the Tehran Times indicated that Rafsanjani would
help obtain freedom for the hostages if the United States released
billions of dollars in Iranian assets impounded a decade ago.
   The administration has rejected linking the hostages and the
assets, and Bush said, ``My view is to do nothing that will be seen
as quid pro quo for hostages.''
   Bush said there were mixed signals from Iran about its
intentions. As for himself, he recalled the rhetorical open hand he
extended to Tehran on the day he took office.
   ``I'm not talking about terms, I'm talking about talking to get
people out that are held against their will,'' he said. ``And I
think I covered that pretty well in my inaugural address when I
said goodwill will beget goodwill. And if ever there was a clearer
signal, in my view that's it.
   ``So I repeat it,'' Bush said. ``And if there are changes taking
place (in Iran) and signals that are shifting, I don't want to miss
a signal.''
   White House press secretary Marlin Fitzwater said the
administration was ``being very careful with our language, trying
to keep the possibility of dialogue open. We want to be encouraging
of improved relations with Iran.''
   Meanwhile, Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir telephoned Bush.
   Shamir's adviser, Avi Pazner said the prime minister repeated
Israel's position that it will free Shiite Moslem cleric Sheik
Abdul Karim Obeid only in exchange for three Israeli soldiers held
in Lebanon and ``all the hostages.''
   Sixteen Western hostages are held in Lebanon, including eight
Americans.
   The call was originiated by Shamir, according to a senior
Israeli official speaking on condition that he not be identified.
He said Shamir felt Bush would ``appreciate the personal contact.''
   In Washington, the president and other administration leaders
denied that the United States was shifting its policy about the way
it deals with terrorists and kidnappers.
   Bush's administration _ and Ronald Reagan's before him _ had
flatly ruled out any negotiations, but Bush seemed to hint at some
change in an interview Tuesday with The Boston Globe.
   He told the newspaper, ``We do not negotiate in any way that's
going to jeopardize the lives of other Americans'' _ a statement
that seemed to suggest that some form of negotiations would be
acceptable.
   Fitzwater said there was no change in policy. He said the
administration had come up with the new phrasing for the policy
``to give definition to it because everybody else has tried to do
it for us.''
   Bush, in his meeting with reporters in the Oval Office, said,
``I don't think there's any subtle change'' from the position of
the Reagan administration.
   ``I'm not going to do anything that would put some other
American _ perhaps in some other place, at some other time _ at
risk, and that means trading off or negotiating for hostages,'' the
president said.
   Bush added, ``I hope I'm open-minded enough to talk and to
exercise every diplomatic channel I can to free these Americans.
... No American is going to be content until these people are free.
And I would not be doing my job if I didn't approach it in that
manner.''
   The president said the United States would continue to press a
diplomatic effort on the hostages' behalf, reaching out to as many
countries as possible.
   Bush said some countries previously on the sidelines of the
hostage crisis now are giving assistance to the United States
because they are ``infuriated or angered or repulsed'' by a
videotape purporting to show the hanging of Marine Lt. Col. William
R. Higgins and another videotape showing American hostage Joseph
Cicippio urging the release of a Moslem cleric who was kidnapped by
Israel.
   ``They've been so offended by that, regardless of their view on
the politics of the Middle East or any other area, that we are
finding more and more of a willingness to help,'' Bush said.
   In his interview with the Globe, Bush noted that Fitzwater had
described him as cautiously optimistic about the hostages but the
president went on to add in the interview, ``I have no reason to
say that I can see, in a short run, a total resolution of the
holding of American-hostage problem.''
   He said Wednesday, ``I'm conducting the foreign policy of this
country in a prudent manner that I hope will get these people out
of there. But the last thing I want to do is elevate the hopes of
these families who have been disappointed over and over again to
have those hopes dashed.''
   Bush invited the press to the Oval Office as he posed for
pictures with Cardinal Bernard Law, the Roman Catholic leader from
Boston. Bush urged Americans to say a prayer this weekend for the
hostages and their families.

<HEAD>15 Sri Lankans Sentenced for Attempted Coup in Maldives</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW DELHI, India (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The High Court in the Maldives Wednesday
sentenced 15 Sri Lankans to prison terms from 17 to 20 years each
for participating in an attempted coup in the Indian Ocean
archipelago, the Maldivian government said.
   On Tuesday, the court sentenced six Sri Lankans to death and
ordered imprisonment of six others, according to statements telexed
to New Delhi by the Maldivian Department of Information and
Broadcasting.
   Fifty-five Sri Lankans have so far been convicted for the Nov. 3
coup attempt, which left at least 17 people killed. Twelve have
been given death sentences and the others were sentenced to prison
from 17 to 38 years each.
   No dates have been set for the executions.
   Sentencing in the two-month trial began Sunday, the statement
said. There is no higher court of appeal and only President Maumoon
Abdul Gayoom can commute the sentences.
   The court has also fined the convicted men $14 million as
compensation for deaths, injuries and damage to Maldivian property,
the statement said.
   At least 68 Sri Lankans and seven Maldivians were arrested after
Indian paratroopers landed in Male, the capital of the Maldives, to
crush the attempted overthrow.
   The Maldivian government says the coup was led by a Sri
Lanka-based Maldivian, Abdullah Luthufi, who was aided by
mercenaries belonging to the People's Liberation Organization of
Tamil Eelam, one of the several separatist groups that had
participated in the war for an independent Tamil nation in Sri
Lanka.
   Luthufi is among the defendants still on trial.
   The Maldives are a string of 2,000 coral islands about 500 miles
south of India and roughly the same distance southwest of Sri
Lanka. Only about 200 of the islands are inhabited.

<TEXT>
   Rebels seized dozens of villagers in
Gaza Province and then massacred 54 of them with axes, clubs and
machetes near the southern coastal town of Xai-Xai, the official
news agency AIM said Wednesday.
   AIM said 13 women and eight children were among those
slaughtered on Monday night by guerrillas of the Mozambique
National Resistance and that 17 people were wounded, 15 of them
seriously.
   The agency, citing a report in Maputo's Noticias newspaper, said
most of the victims were kidnapped and forcibly marched to the
Fidel Castro village, just outside Xai-Xai and about 90 miles
northeast of Maputo, the capital.
   Mozambique's civil war has gone on for 12 years. It has resulted
in an estimated 600,000 deaths, created more than a million
refugees and left nearly half of the nation's 14.7 million people
dependent on food aid.
   No government acknowledges supporting the insurrectionists.
   The attack came while rebel leaders and government
representatives were in Kenya trying to resolve the war. Mozambican
churchmen, acting on behalf of the government, met the rebels
Tuesday, but no major breakthroughs were reported.
   The guerrillas have been accused of widespread civilian
atrocities in their battle to undermine Mozambique's socialist
government.
   South Africa openly supported the rebels until 1984, but says it
since has abided by a mutual non-aggression pact with neighboring
Mozambique.
   President Joaquim Chissano said recently he accepted South
African statements that it no longer aids the rebels. Mozambique
still believes the rebels receive help from non-governmental groups
in South Africa, however.

   The measures included selling off government shipping operations
and official residences in Brasilia, the capital, according Ronaldo
Costa Couto, President Jose Sarney's chief of staff.
   Costa Couto refused comment on whether thousands of civil
servants would be fired, as Sarney promised in January. He said the
government would maintain strategic state companies, but he would
not elaborate.
   On Thursday, congressional leaders urged economic reforms to aid
Brazil's ailing economy, including boosting imports to increase
industrial competition, and slashing state subsidies and tax breaks
to the private sector.
   In a 30-point document, they also suggested Sarney eliminate
privileges enjoyed by high officials, including non-essential trips
and state-funded publicity campaigns.
   Plagued by a $112 billion foreign debt _ the developing world's
largest _ and negative economic growth, Brazil sorely needs new
money to meet an interest payment of $3 billion due in September to
private foreign banks.
   The government is negotiating an economic agreement with the
International Monetary Fund that would qualify the country for
nearly $4 billion in fresh loans withheld by private banks and
lending organizations.
   Creditors have refused to lend more money to Brazil, which has
been unable to control inflation, monetary expansion or a
ballooning public deficit, which is around 7 percent of the $300
billion gross national product.
   The government four times has announced it would sell off
state-run enterprises and eliminate jobs in the years since Brazil
returned from military to civilian rule in 1985. But Sarney has yet
to fulfill those promises.

   Two USAir mechanics have been suspended
without pay for 90 days following a company investigation into the
emergency landing of an airliner in North Carolina last week, a
company spokesman said Wednesday.
   The action extends a temporary suspension imposed last week
after federal investigators found wheel chocks were unintentionally
left in both wheel wells before the plane took off from Washington
National Airport.
   USAir spokesman David Shipley declined to release the names of
the mechanics or details of the company's investigation.
   USAir Group, headquartered outside Washington, merged its
Piedmont subsidiary into USAir on Saturday, three days after the
Piedmont Boeing 737 with 100 people aboard on a flight from
Washington bound for Columbia, S.C. landed at Greensboro, N.C. with
only the nose and right landing gear in place.
   There were no injuries, and only the left engine was damaged.
   A NTSB spokesman said Friday the initial investigation showed
the two mechanics were responsible for the final check before the
plane was turned over to the flight crew.
   Investigators found a 2{ foot rubber wheel chock, used to keep
planes from rolling on the ground, jammed into the left wheel well,
and they believe one in the right wheel well was shaken out.
   The plane was moved six times the night before the flight, NTSB
has said.
   The investigators said ground crews sometimes stuff the chocks
in the wheel wells when moving planes.

   Democratic Party Chairman Ronald H. Brown
attacked corruption at Housing and Urban Development during
Republican administrations Wednesday and Republican Chairman Lee
Atwater charged statehouse and congressional districts were
``rigged'' for Democrats.
   The two men rallied their party members at separate sessions at
the National Conference of State Legislatures.
   Brown said Republicans had been elected on a mandate to
eliminate waste, fraud and abuse in government but had instead
raised misdeeds to ``a new art form.''
   ``The more we turn over the HUD record, the more slime oozes
into the light,'' Brown told a gathering of about 200 Democratic
lawmakers.
   Atwater, speaking to about 300 Republican legislators in an
adjoining banquet hall, asked them to lead an assault on a
Democrat-favoring system of statehouse and congressional districts
during redistricting in 1991.
   ``Right now, most legislative and congressional districts are
rigged in favor of Democrats,'' Atwater said. ``Republican
candidates received nearly half the congressional vote in 1988, but
only make up 40 percent of the seats in Congress.
   ``We believe that the voters have a fundamental right to choose
their representatives _ freely and fairly _ to the state
legislature and to Congress. They shouldn't have to go through
vote-laundering Democrats in some smoke-filled room to make their
opinions known.''
   Brown said Republicans had used HUD as ``a dumping ground for
unemployed Republican political hacks.'' He cited as HUD abuses the
building of a housing project in Beverly Hills, Calif., a country
club in southern California and a swimming pool on New York's Long
Island.
   ``And just down the road in Stilwell, Oklahoma, they built
sewage treatment facilities to serve a single poultry processing
plant, which has yet to be opened,'' he said.
   He said Republicans under the Reagan administration gave the
Pentagon a blank check and ``looked the other way while contractors
bribed Pentagon employees and gouged the government.''
   Brown accused President George Bush of paying lip service to
important issues such as the environment and the war on drugs.
   Brown also addressed redistricting, saying said there is no
bigger priority for Democrats and that it is vital that Democrats
maintain their majority status.
   ``What I mean is that the pen that draws those lines is in the
hands of good Democrats,'' he said. ``We need to target our
resources to make sure that we hold that pen.
   ``The Republicans have threatened to litigate us to death on
redistricting plans and we expect them to do it.''
   Atwater said politics of the next decade will be shaped by what
happens during redistricting.
   ``The political landscape of the nation over the next 10 years
is going to be determined by whether we have a fair redistricting
in 1991,'' he said.
   ``When Democrats look to the future, this rigged system of
representation is about all they have left,'' Atwater said. ``We're
the party of the future. The Democrats are the party of the
political machine.''
   He said Republicans are within six seats of winning a majority
in 20 state legislative chambers and ``fair redistricting is within
our grasp.''

<DATELINE>FORT AMADOR, Panama (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   U.S. forces blockaded Fort Amador for
more than three hours Wednesday after two American soldiers were
arrested, then withdrew after the troopers were exchanged for two
arrested Panamanians.
   U.S. Army helicopters circled overhead during the confrontation,
and Panamanian troops could be seen aiming anti-aircraft weapons at
them.
   Fort Amador is a shared area that includes barracks for
Panamanian troops, a building where Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega has
an office, offices of the U.S. Southern Command offices, a U.S.
naval station and a golf course used by U.S. personnel.
   Sources said Noriega, commander of the Panamanian Defense Forces
and the country's de facto ruler, was not at the Fort Amador office
Wednesday.
   Col. Ronald Sconyers, spokesman for the Southern Command, said
the incident began when a U.S. military policeman was arrested near
El Chorillo, where the Panamanian Defense Forces general staff has
its headquarters.
   The soldier was taken to nearby Fort Amador, where another U.S.
military policeman was arrested when he tried to obtain his
comrade's release, Sconyers said.
   U.S. troops then arrested two Panamanian military policemen at
the gates to the fort and U.S. troops and armored personnel
carriers blockaded the entrance until the men were released.
   Arresting the Americans may have been retaliation for the brief
detention by U.S. authorities on Tuesday of 29 Panamanians,
including Noriega's brother-in-law and eight other soldiers.
   Panamanian military sources, speaking on condition of anonymity,
confirmed Sconyers' account but gave no reason for the initial
arrest.
   The Southern Command and the Defense Forces later accused each
other of violating agreements relating to movements of their
respective troops in the area.
   ``They are trying to humilitate us in our own house,'' said Maj.
Edgardo Lopez Grimaldo, a spokesman for the Defense Forces. ``We
will not be trapped into provocation, in order not to respond to
Yankee arrogance.''
   At the Pentagon in Washington, Army Maj. Kathy Wood said the
actions did not violate the Panama Canal treaties, under which
``the commander of a military area of coordination has
responsibility for the security of his area.''
   Civilians, including reporters, were allowed across the line
during the blockade at Amador, but not Panamanian soldiers.
   Reporters watched about three hours later as U.S. and Panamanian
officers met and exchanged the soldiers. The five armored personnel
carriers withdrew and the entrance was reopened.
   The blockade delayed a Panamanian anti-terrorist unit that
planned to hold an exercise at the National Bank of Panama, a
15-story building in Panama City, because the unit could not take
trucks and other equipment out of Fort Amador.
   A few dozen soldiers from the two countries lined a street that
divides nearby Quarry Heights, where Southern Command headquarters
is located, from Panama City.
   Southern Command said 29 Panamanians were detained 75 minutes
Tuesday because they entered a joint-use military area without
authorization. Among them were four military officers, including
Maj. Manuel Sieiro, Noriega's brother-in-law.
   Weapons taken from them included four automatic rifles, a
machine gun, two grenades and seven pistols, the Southern Command
said.
   The U.N. Security Council has scheduled debate for Friday on
Panama's complaint that the United States is trying to undermine it.
   Gen. Noriega was indicted in Florida last year on U.S. charges
of drug trafficking and money laundering. He denied the charges and
fought off U.S. efforts to force him to quit, including economic
sanctions against Panama.

<HEAD>Fire Strikes Sled Maker Amid Foreclosure Auction</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SOUTH PARIS, Maine (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Fire blamed on faulty wiring broke out
Wednesday at the Paris Manufacturing Co., the nation's oldest
manufacturer of wooden sleds and toboggans, but didn't interfere
with a foreclosure auction.
   First Assistant Fire Chief William Grover initially said fires
which erupted in two separate painting booths in the wood-frame
manufacturing plant appeared suspicious. But by midmorning,
investigators from the state fire marshal's office had traced the
blaze to an electrical problem.
   Grover said a frayed wire short-circuited and ignited one of the
painting booths. Fueled by lacquer, the fire activated the
sprinkler system and the sudden blast of water blew burning lacquer
into the other booth, he said.
   Damage was confined largely to the painting booths.
   Wednesday was the second and final day of an auction closing the
books on one of western Maine's best-known industries.
   The sale was intended to clear the company's $1.8 million debt
to Oxford Bank and Trust Co., guaranteed by the Finance Authority
of Maine and the Small Business Administration.
   Tuesday's sale brought in $54,750 for a 27.3-acre site with saw
mill, storage buildings and equipment, and an additional $27,000
for a nearby 22-acre tract. The remaining property auctioned
Wednesday included the main manufacturing plant.

<HEAD>Thousands Of Jews Pray At Western Wall To Mourn Lost Temple</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Thousands of Jews prayed Wednesday night at the
sacred Western Wall in Jerusalem's Old City to mourn the
destruction of their temple by the Romans 1919 years ago.
   The nightlong prayer marked the start of Tisha Be-Av, or the
ninth of the Jewish lunar month of Av, the greatest day of mourning
in the Jewish calendar.
   The holiday this year was also marked by heavy security measures
linked to the 20-month-old Palestinian uprising in the
Israeli-occupied territories and the annexed east Jerusalem and
fears of a possible terror attack.
   Hundreds of police officers and paramilitary border policemen
guarded the Western Wall square inside the walled Old City.
   Police also erected a special electronic gate at the entrance to
the Western Wall square and said no weapons would be allowed near
the sacred stones.
   Tisha Be-Av commemorates the destruction of the First Temple in
Jerusalem by the Babylonians in 586 B.C. and the destruction of the
Second Temple by the Roman emperor Titus in 70 a.d. The Western
Wall is the last remnant of that temple.
   The body of Jewish religious teachings lists other disasters
said to have accurred on that day, such as the fall of Beitar, the
last stronghold of anti-Roman Jewish rebels, in 135 A.D. and the
creation of a Roman temple in Jerusalem a year later.
   During the ages, Tisha Be-Av had become a symbol of misfortune
and persecution that befell the Jewish people. The expulsion of
Jews from Spain in 1492, during the period of the Inquisition, is
also said to have occurred on that day.
   The mourning for past tragedies is marked by fasting and prayer.
Near the Western Wall, religious Jews chant sections from the
Scroll of Lamentations or the Book of Job, sitting on the ground or
on low stools.
   Tisha Be-Av lasts from nightfall till afternoon on the next day.
During that period, Jews are forbidden to eat, drink, and bathe.
   Although work is technically allowed, it is customary to abstain
from it. Many Israeli businesses closed for 24 hours. Restaurants
and movie houses also closed or faced a fine.

   President Bush is expected to name former
White House national security adviser Gen. Colin L. Powell as the
new chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, a senior administration
official said Wednesday.
   The four-star Army general would become the first black to hold
the post as the nation's senior military officer.
   Upon confirmation by the Senate, the 52-year-old Powell would
succeed Adm. William J. Crowe Jr., who is to retire Sept. 30.
   The source, who spoke on condition that he not be identified,
said the White House is expected to make the announcement on
Thursday.
   Defense Secretary Dick Cheney made the recommendation to the
president and informed the Joint Chiefs of Staff on Wednesday, said
the official.
   The chairman is the principal military adviser to the president
and the secretary of defense.
   Under a new management organization instituted by Cheney, the
chairman also wields greater influence over military budgets than
in the past.
   Bush's decision to name Powell means that the four-star Army
general jumps into the position over several more senior officers.
He would be the youngest to sit in the chairman's chair, and one of
the few not to have attended one of the service academies.
   A leading candidate for the position has been Air Force Gen.
Robert Herres, vice chairman of the Joint Chiefs.
   Powell distinguished himself in the highly visible White House
role and was well known to Bush during his tenure as vice president.
   He has not hesitated to speak to groups of young blacks, warning
them of their duty to help others and to protect the gains of the
civil rights revolution.
   ``Don't squander the blood, sweat and tears of those who paved
the way for you,'' he told Clark Atlanta University graduates this
spring. ``The greatest danger ... is complacency.''
   President Reagan tapped Powell for the White House post in
November 1987 after Powell had worked 10 months as deputy to
national security adviser Frank Carlucci to reform the
scandal-wracked office in the days following the Iran-Contra affair.
   Currently, Powell is head of the U.S. Army Forces Command in
Fort McPherson, Ga., where he has been in charge of keeping the 1
million active, reserve and National Guard troops in the United
States ready for combat.
   Powell also served as a chief aide to former Defense Secretary
Caspar Weinberger in 1983-1986 and commanded the Army's 5th Corps
in Germany for six months.
   Powell was born of Jamaican immigrant parents in New York City
and raised in the South Bronx. He was commissioned a second
lieutenant in 1958 after earning a bachelor's degree in geology at
the City University of New York, and later earned a master's degree
in business administration from George Washington University. He
served in the Office of Management and Budget in 1972 during a term
as a White House fellow.
   Powell served in Vietnam in 1962 and again in 1968, and holds
the Bronze Star for valor and a Purple Heart.

<HEAD>9 Top Contra Officers Request U.S. Asylum</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MIAMI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Nine top Contra military officers, including the
rebel chief of staff, requested political asylum in the United
States on Wednesday and three were immediately approved,
immigration officials said.
   The action came two days after five Central American presidents
agreed on a plan to demobilize the Contras within four months.
   Israel Galeano, the rebel chief of staff known as Comandante
Franklin, was among the officers filing claims at the Miami office
of the U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service.
   The officers denied there was a connection between their
applications and the accord signed Monday by five Central American
presidents in Tela, Honduras, calling for the dismantling of
Nicaragua's anti-Sandinista forces.
   ``We're doing this errand to facilitate our struggle,'' said
Francisco ``Johnny'' Delgadillo, a political adviser on the
southern front who also was granted asylum.
   Galeano said the Contra leaders have no plans to move to the
United States, telling The Miami Herald that the officers sought
nothing more than ``travel documents.''
   ``Some of us have the need right now to mobilize in the
international field,'' Galeano said. ``There is a need to get
documents to travel.''
   Delgadillo admitted the action could be misinterpreted by the
estimated 12,000 rebel troops languishing in border camps.
   ``It could be demoralizing to the troops if we were seen as
retiring from the struggle,'' Delgadillo said. ``But the troops
know that's not so. Our struggle continues.''
   He voiced bitterness at the Honduras agreement. ``We don't want
to live like slaves to the signature of the presidents,'' he said.
``We want to go on being rebels.''
   Nicaraguan President Daniel Ortega declared that the plan spells
the death of the rebel movement. The Sandinista government agreed
to democratic reforms leading up to national elections in return
for the repatriation or resettlement of the Contras by Dec. 8.
   The Bush administration, which lobbied to keep the Contras
intact as a fighting force until Nicaragua's February 1990
elections, has reluctantly embraced the five presidents' accord.
Congress cut off military aid to the rebels in February 1988.
   Galeano vowed Wednesday to continue his fight with ``limitless
human resources'' and return to the jungled mountains of Nicaragua
if the Contras are kicked out of Honduras.
   ``Each government has acted on nothing more than its own selfish
interest,'' he said. ``We're the ones who are paying the price.''
   Perry Rivkind, the INS district director in Miami, said the
claims were given ``special action'' status and reviewed
immediately.
   ``Because of the nature of their positions and possible security
problems, we ask that their cases be moved fast,'' Rivkind said.
   A complete list of the nine commanders was not available
Wednesday, but the names that were known included: Luis Angel
Lopez, known as Leonel; Jose ``Emmanuel'' Aguilar, a southern front
commander; and Fremio ``Jimmy Leo'' Altamirano, a northern front
commander.

   Well-wishers around the country lit up the
telephones in Rep. Mickey Leland's office Wednesday as his staff
spent a third day waiting for word about the missing congressman.
   Leland, a Houston Democrat and chairman of the House Select
Committee on Hunger, disappeared Monday after his twin-engine plane
took off from Addis Ababa on its way to a refugee camp on
Ethiopia's border with Sudan, about 480 miles away.
   ``We're still waiting, anxiously,'' legislative assistant James
Williams told a caller. ``We're waiting for him to call us up and
ask us for his messages.''
   Inside Leland's personal office at the Rayburn House Office
Building, spokeswoman Alma Newsom sat at his desk conducting a
string of interviews that she said keeps her mind off the grim
possibilities.
   ``Everything is in their favor at this point. The weather is
temperate, it's not too hot or cold, and these planes do carry
adequate provisions. They're not in any immediate danger on the
ground,'' said Ms. Newsom, a friend of Leland's since their college
days.
   The Rev. Jesse Jackson stopped by the office and said a prayer
for Leland with his staff, while Leland's brother, Gaston, answered
the phnes, paced the marble hallways and waited.
   ``There may be some concern that I'm not up here crying,'' Ms.
Newsom told reporters. ``Congressman Leland is an exceptionally
positive person. He does not want people who are not positive
around him. ... I just absolutely have not heard anything that
would cause alarm.''
   ``We feel he's just landed, stranded and waiting to get in touch
with us,'' Williams said between phone calls.
   Thirteen othrs were on the plane with Leland, including two of
his staff members. The aircraft was last heard from 15 minutes
after taking off Monday morning.
   As nightfall in Ethiopia ended the second day of an air and
ground search with no word, Ms. Newsom said staff members were not
letting themselves ``be anything but upbeat.''
   Meanwhile, prayers and good wishes continued to pour in.
President Bush and Secretary of State James A. Baker III on Tuesday
called Leland's wife, Alison, who is six weeks' pregnant with their
second child, and CBS anchorman Dan Rather, a friend of Leland's,
called to say ``he had sent up a prayer.''
   House Speaker Thomas S. Foley, D-Wash., sent Reps. Gary
Ackerman, D-N.Y., a member of the Select Committee on Hunger
chaired by Leland, and Al Wheat, D-Mo., a member of the
Congressional Black Caucus, to Ethiopia to represent the House in
observing the search for Leland. The two, accompanied by House
Sergeat-at-Arms Jack Russ, left Andrews Air Force Base Tuesday
night.

   Gen. Colin L. Powell, who is expected to be named
the new chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, is described by
colleagues as a ``soldier's soldier'' who doesn't particularly like
staff jobs.
   The four-star Army general, who became national security adviser
in 1987 and heads the U.S. Forces Command at Fort McPherson in
Atlanta, would become the first black to serve as the nation's
senior military officer.
   The 52-year-old son of Jamaican immigrants, Powell was highly
regarded by President Reagan, succeeding Frank C. Carlucci as
Reagan's national security adviser.
   ``He was the general who guided preparations for the Gorbachev
summits, who helped restructure and give new direction to the
National Security Council following the Iran-Contra investigation,
and who, by his personal integrity and commitment, has restored
confidence in the National Security Council itself,'' said White
House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater.
   Those qualities were cited by The Washington Post in calling
Powell the ``antidote to Ollie North,'' the former NSC aide
convicted in the Iran-Contra scandal.
   ``Colin gets mad at me when I say this, but I think he should go
to the very top of the military establishment _ up to and including
chairman of the joint chiefs of staff,'' Carlucci has said.
   A senior administration official said in Washington on Wednesday
that President Bush is expected to name Powell to the position.
   Powell took over U.S. Forces Command, or FORSCOM, in April,
putting him in charge of troop readiness and deployment for the
U.S. Army. In interviews since then, he has emphasized he's proud
of the accomplishments of the average U.S. soldier over the years.
   In the old days, Powell said, soldiers would keep a pinball
machine in a corner of their barracks. ``Today there's a computer
there.''
   On personal level, however, Powell doesn't always keep up with
the times. You'd only know the 1972 Chrysler station wagon parked
in the general's space each day was his by reading the four-star
decal on its front.
   Washington colleagues have described Powell as a ``soldier's
soldier'' who doesn't like staff jobs. Carlucci says that Powell
has always been reluctant to be a bureaucrat and that Reagan got
Powell to accept the job of national security adviser after the
general had turned Carlucci down several times.
   In his time off, he tells young blacks to spend their lives
helping to open doors for minorities.
   ``Don't squander the blood, sweat and tears of those who paved
the way for you,'' he told Clark Atlanta University graduates this
spring. ``The greatest danger ... is complacency.''
   He tells of his battles with racial discrimination, recalling
the time an Alabama state trooper pulled him over for speeding in
the early 1960s. The trooper looked at the car, complete with New
York plates and an LBJ bumper sticker, and hissed, ``Boy, get out
of here.''
   On the job, Powell emphasizes his commitment to obtaining
resources for his troops, a task he said was top priority when he
became FORSCOM commander.
   As leader of Powell is responsible for the training and
preparedness of more than 1 million active, reserve and National
Guard troops in the United States.
   Powell's daily interests are more pressing: Keeping his troops
ready for combat ``with the hope they will never be needed.''
   And in that position, he keeps a close eye on the Soviet Union.
   ``The Soviets are going through wrenching historic change,
beginning with the irreversible acknowledgement that their system
is broken and has to be changed,'' he said at his FORSCOM
installation. But ``their FORSCOM is strong. We must be strong.''
   Born in New York, Powell completed training in the Airborne and
Ranger schools and served in Germany and Vietnam.
   Commissioned in the infantry in 1958, he was wounded twice
during two tours in Vietnam, once falling into a trap lined with
sharpened bamboo sticks and impaling a foot.
   His decorations include the Distinguished Service Medal, the
Legion of Merit, the Bronze Star and the Purple Heart.
   Powell and his wife, Alma, have two daughters and a son.

<HEAD>Antarctica Expedition Sleds Crash; Reduced to 2{ Sleds</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ST. PAUL (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Explorers crossing Antarctica with dog sleds
spent the past two days trying to salvage two of their three sleds,
which were damaged when they crashed in a descent on ice, a
spokeswoman said Wednesday night.
   The international team led by Minnesotan Will Steger tore down
both damaged sleds and reconstructed them into one full-sized sled
and a half-sized sled, said expedition spokeswoman Cathy DeMoll.
   ``We were careening down some steep blue ice. The two Komatek
homestead sleds crashed together and rolled, splitting the runners
lengthwise,'' Steger said in a fax received Wednesday at the
expedition's headquarters in St. Paul.
   ``It was a big mistake,'' he said. ``We should have been using
ropes.''
   Blue ice is hard, smooth ice that has been blown clear of snow.
DeMoll said the accident occurred in an area with very low
visibility, and the second sled couldn't slow down on the incline.
   None of the six team members was injured, nor were any of the
dogs.
   The team had been crossing its first piece of land, the Jason
Peninsula, rather than the flatter, smoother ice shelf, and have
encountered what Steger called ``a minefield of crevasses, many of
them deep _ very deep.''
   The 36 dogs, which normally run 12 to a sled, will likely be
resdistributed along with the team's load as the group continues
its 4,000-mile journey, DeMoll said.
   Steger's group ruled out the expense of sending in a spare sled
by plane, and instead hopes to make it until the scheduled resupply
mission on Aug. 25.
   Steger and fellow International Trans-Antarctica Expedition
members from France, Great Britain, the Soviet Union, Japan and
China since last month have been making a first-ever attempt to
cross Antarctica from west to east. The seven-month journey is
designed, in part, to draw world attention to Antarctica's fragile
environmental and political climate.

Leland of Texas.
   Rep. Gary Ackerman, D-N.Y., a member of the Select Committee on
Hunger chaired by Leland, and Rep. Al Wheat, D-Mo., a member of the
Congressional Black Caucus, took off from Andrews Air Force Base
for Eglin Air Force Base, Fla., where they were to transfer to an
Air Force C-5 transport the United States is sending to help the

   Howard Doyle, spokesman for Ackerman, said Ackerman's ``concerns
have increased as time goes on,'' and he flew from New York earlier
in the day.
   Ackerman accompanied Leland on an earlier trip to eastern Africa
this spring.
   House Speaker Thomas S. Foley, D-Wash., asked Wheat and Foley to
represent the House in the search for Leland, Doyle said.
   Also making the trip was the sergeant-at-arms of the House, Jack
Russ.
   The party was to reach Addis Ababa, the Ethiopian capital,
Thursday night after a brief stop in London.

<HEAD>23 Die In Ethnic Strife, Extremists Raid Air Base</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PATRICK CRUEZ</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>COLOMBO, Sri Lanka (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   At least 23 people died in ethnic
strife over the past 24 hours and Sinhalese extremists captured
sophisticated weaponry in a raid on an air force base, the
government said Wednesday.
   The government also said it would take control of the port of
Trincomalee in northeastern Sri Lanka. For two years, Indian
peacekeeping troops have had virtual authority over the port, which
is one of the world's largest natural harbors.
   On Wednesday, Sri Lankan industrialist Kanagasabai Gunaratnam
was slain by two men on a motorcycle as he sat in his car in
Colombo, a company spokesman said on condition of anonymity.
   Police said motives for the slaying of 72-year-old Gunaratnam
were unclear, although they appeared related to the island nation's
ethnic strife.
   Among other victims were six members of a family in Gampha, 15
miles northeast of Colombo. Military officials blamed the deaths on
the People's Liberation Front, a Sinhalese extremist group.
   It was not immediately clear how the other victims died.
   The front has targeted government officials and supporters,
saying Premadasa has made too many concessions to the Tamil
minority, who have been fighting since 1983 for a separate nation
in northern and eastern Sri Lanka.
   Government troops searched Wednesday for Sinhalese extremists
who raided an air force camp at Vavuniya, 135 miles northeast of
Colombo. The guerrillas escaped with a rocket-propelled grenade
launcher, three rockets, and a Chinese light machine gun.
   A spokesman for the Indian High Commission, or embassy, said he
was unaware of Sri Lanka's announcement.
   The Sinhalese majority controls the government, military and
economy. Tamils, who comprise 18 percent of the island's 16 million
people, say they are discriminated against in jobs, education and
language.
   India intervened in Sri Lanka's internal strife after the two
nations signed a peace agreement in July 1987 to end the Tamil
rebellion. Indian peacekeeping troops arrived in the nation's
northeast to disarm the rebels, but the largest guerrilla faction
reneged on the peace agreeement.
   Sri Lanka now wants the Indian force out. The Defense Ministry
said the port of Trincomalee, which harbors more than 100 ships,
would be placed under control of the Sri Lankan navy.
   At its peak, the Indian peacekeeping force numbered 70,000, but
tapered off to 45,000 by February. India resumed troop withdrawals
on July 29, and the force now numbers about 43,000.

<HEAD>U.S. Official's Joke Fails To Amuse Conference Delegates</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SEATTLE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Delegates to a summit meeting on trade among
Pacific Rim countries said they were offended by a Bush
Administration official's joke about Soviet women and his attack on
Marxism.
   ``It was only a joke, but I don't like the joke,'' said Lu
Zu-wen, commercial consul for the Chinese Consulate in San
Francisco. ``He's a joker. I don't know what his purpose was.''
   Fred M. Zeder II, head of the government's Overseas Private
Investment Corp., began his address Tuesday with a joke in which
China's late Chairman Mao Zedong is asked by a foreign journalist
what ``might have happened if Lee Harvey Oswald had assassinated
Khrushchev rather than President Kennedy.''
   Mimicking a stereotypical Chinese accent, Zeder said Mao
replied: ``Only one thing certain. Aristotle Onassis would not have
married Mrs. Khrushchev.''
   Delegates said few listeners were amused.
   Nor was the Soviet delegate to the week-long summit happy to
hear Zeder turn to his opinion of Marxist philosophy at a gathering
designed to improve trade relations between 23 Pacific Rim nations.
   Zeder accused the Soviets of ``marching into Poland, Hungary and
Yugoslavia,'' of ``bringing Castro's Cuban mercenaries into
Nicaragua, Angola and Ethiopia,'' and of spreading Marxism ``every
place in the world.''
   Zeder's speech received scattered applause, but Soviet delegate
Vyacheslav Zilanov drew louder applause later when he criticized
Zeder's remarks.
   ``I don't agree with some of the opinions put forward by Zeder
in his morning speech,'' Zilanov said. ``I don't feel this Pacific
summit is the right place to discuss Marxist-Leninist theory and
its position right now.''
   In a telephone interview Wednesday from his home in Washington,
D.C., Zeder said he didn't mean to offend anyone. ``I was talking
to the wrong audience. I apologize to any technocrats who might
have been offended by anything.''
   The joke, he said, ``is an old, old joke'' told to him by Bob
Hope. ``It's not racist, not vulgar, not provocative. It's just
funny. I told that same joke to the ambassador from Beijing; he
thought it was very funny,'' said Zeder.
   ``I think they might have been offended by the fact that I tried
to explain that the Marxist-Leninist process didn't work,'' he
said. ``Gorbachev himself has admitted that the system is flawed.
That was my message _ that the system has failed.''
   Zeder, 68, was appointed this year to head OPIC by President
Bush.
   John Anderson, director of the Washington state Department of
Trade and Economic Development and chairman of the summit
organizing committee, said officials had reviewed Zeder's initial
speech and toned it down.
   Anderson did not give details of the earlier draft, but said
``we were looking at something that could have blown the conference
up.''

<TEXT>
   The federal government has dropped a lawsuit
accusing Northrop of falsifying tests on MX missile guidance
devices and has agreed not to refile it, the aerospace company said
Wednesday.
   Federal prosecutors could not immediately be reached to explain
why they dropped the $3 million suit. It had alleged fraud and
violations of the False Claims Act, saying tests on about 20 heat
exchangers for the MX were never properly conducted.
   A lawyer for Northrop ``whistleblowers'' characterized the suit
as just a tiny piece of a mosaic of multimillion-dollar civil and
criminal cases filed by former and present Northrop employees and
the government.
   ``Unfortunately for Northrop, our cases are alive and well and
moving through both the civil and criminal courts,'' attorney
Herbert Hafif said.
   The company has denied the accusations of overcharges and
falsifying tests, which involve the cruise missile and stealth
bomber as well as the MX missile.
   Northrop spokesman Tony Cantafio said the heat exchanger suit,
filed in federal court here in August 1987, was ``dismissed with
prejudice'' by U.S. District Judge David Kenyon last week, meaning
it cannot be refiled.
   ``The government's action in dismissing the case with prejudice
clearly establishes that none of these violations occurred,'' a
company statement said.
   Heat exchangers remove heat generated by a guidance system
component known as the inertial measurement unit, a
basketball-sized device that guides nuclear missiles to their
targets.
   The case arose when a heat exchanger component and a test stand
exploded during testing in January 1986. As part of the dismissal
of the case, Northrop agreed to pay the government $45,045 for the
damage to government equipment.
   Cantafio declined to describe what led up to the dismissal of
the suit, which the company announced late in the day. The U.S.
attorney's office in Los Angeles referred calls to the Justice
Department's special civil litigation section in Washington, which
had closed for the day.
   Hafif, the lead attorney for several Northrop employees who have
sued Northop under the False Claims Act, characterized the case as
relatively insignificant.
   ``Northrop is a hell of a lot better at issuing press releases
than it is at building missiles,'' Hafif said. ``That press release
is designed to deceive the public and Congress into believing that
a small government case somehow affects our major cases and
charges.''
   The False Claims Act allows workers or executives who sue their
employers for fraud against the government to recover as much as 30
percent of any damages awarded.
   The federal government has the option of joining such suits, but
so far has not done so in an MX missile case Hafif filed on behalf
of several plaintiffs led by David Peterson, a former Northrop
employee.
   The case accuses Northrop of overcharging, falsifying tests and
using faulty parts on the guidance system for the MX missile, and
Hafif said damages could run more than $100 million.
   The government has joined another of Hafif's civil suits, a $30
million case involving allegations of faked tests on the guidance
system for the cruise missile.
   A federal grand jury has issued a related criminal indictment
accusing Northrop and five employees of fraud and conspiracy for
allegedly falsifying tests on nuclear-armed cruise missiles and for
supplying equipment that the government knew failed to meet
specifications.
   Another Hafif lawsuit involves allegations that Northrop cost
taxpayers hundreds of millions of dollars in overcharges and false
tests on the stealth bomber. The government has so far declined to
join that case.

   A woman swimmer who suffered severe hand and arm

   Judy St. Clair, 31, was attacked earlier in the day in waters

of Miami, said Coast Guard Petty Officer Steven Sapp.
   She was airlifted to Nassau and then to Miami for more extensive
medical treatment. She was taken into amputation surgery soon after
she arrived at Miami's Jackson Memorial Hospital, said
administrator Susan Cataldo.
   ``Yes, it's just the hand, I expect it'll be just above the
wrist,'' the administrator said, adding she didn't know which hand
was amputated.
   Ms. St. Clair is a U.S. citizen, but her hometown was not
immediately available, said hospital officials and the Coast Guard.
   Coast Guard officials said the woman was pulled from the water
with extensive bites to her arm and hand.

<HEAD>American Border Plants Ask Mexican Authorities To Help End Strike</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   American-run assembly plants are asking
the government to help end a wildcat strike now in its third week
that has idled 2,000 workers along the U.S.-Mexico border, company
officials said Wednesday.
   ``Everything is on hold. We're waiting to see what the
government will do,'' said James Gaffney, vice president of the
local industry assocation in Reynosa, just south of McAllen, Texas.
   The strike involves a dispute between two labor leaders vying
for control of workers in Reynosa, Gaffney said.
   The strike is the worst to hit the border industries, which
import raw materials and equipment duty-free, use cheap Mexican
labor and then export the goods.
   It has idled 15 such plants since it began 16 days ago. Local
industry has lost an estimated $500,000 daily said Osvaldo
Gutierrez, another business leader.
   ``This is a very critical situation for Reynosa,'' Gutierrez
said. ``Both local and international investors must have guarantees
of labor stability if they're going to risk their capital.''
   The so-called ``maquiladora'' industry is one of the
fastest-growing maanufacturing activities in Mexico. About 1,400
plants are strung along the Mexican side of the border, employing
392,000 workers.
   In 1985 about 800 plants with 218,000 employees were operating.
   Gaffney said the strike was caused by a dispute among Reynosa's
three unions representing the maquiladora industry. All three are
affiliated with the Federation of Mexican Workers, the country's
biggest labor organization.
   Rafael Morales de la Cruz, general secretary of one union and a
leader of another, is trying to control all three labor
organizations and many union members are resisting.
   Morales' union put up strike banners across the gates of 11
plants July 25 and kept workers out. Four other plants closed their
doors in protest.
   Morales is opposed by Abel Hernandez, another union leader.
   Representatives from the association and the Economic
Development Corporation in McAllen are asking authorities in Mexico
City to rule in favor of Hernandez, Gaffney said.
   Gaffney said all 2,000 workers affected by the strike continue
receiving their $1.20 hourly wages.
   Reynosa has 42 assembly plants, which employ 25,000 workers.

   Thai pirates took pleading
Vietnamese refugees from the hold of a boat one by one, beat them
with sticks and iron rods and then hacked them to death, survivors
told refugee officials Wednesday.
   The officials said 71 Vietnamese were reported dead.
   The pirates sank the refugees' boat by ramming it twice with
their own boat and then systematically killed survivors swimming in
the sea, they added.
   Jean Marie Fakhouri, chief representative in Malaysia for the
United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, said 13 who survived
were interviewed Wednesday by U.N. and Malaysian refugee officials
and gave this account:
   Their boat left Vietnam on Thursday, Aug. 3, carrying 58 men, 15
women and 11 children.
   On Saturday night, two fishing boats intercepted them and towed
them for some distance. Fishing crew boarded their boat and robbed
them of their valuables.
   Some Vietnamese were transferred to the fishing boats. The rest
were kept in the hold of the refugee boat.
   The fishermen-pirates then brought up men singly from the hold,
clubbed them and then killed them with axes, the refugee officials
said.
   The men cried and pleaded, but the pirates, whom they
ascertained to be Thais because of their appearance and language,
showed no mercy.
   ``In the panic that followed, others tried to storm out of the
hold, but were contained by the pirates, who tied fishing nets over
the opening. The trapped men then tried to cut their way through
the nets without success,'' Fakhouri reported, quoting the
survivors.
   He said the ramming, sinking and killing of Vietnamese in the
water followed, but 13 survived by swimming to an oil rig, where
workers rescued them.
   The rig, off Kuala Trengganu, 180 miles northeast of Kuala
Lumpur, was operated by Esso, a subsidiary of Exxon of the United
States.
   The latest incident brought to 271 the number of refugees
reported killed by pirates in the South China Sea off Malaysia this
year in four attacks.

   Backers of a plan to authorize casino
gambling in Ohio conceded defeat Wednesday after failing in a
last-minute push Wednesday to place a proposal on the Nov. 7
ballot, officials said.
   The casino advocates notified the state shortly before 10 p.m.
that they had given up the effort to get enough petition signatures
by a midnight deadline, said Steven Fought, a spokesman for the
Secretary of State's office.
   Auto dealer Alan Spitzer, spokesman for the group and a
potential casino owner, seemed to concede defeat at a news
conference Wednesday afternoon and made plans for a similar effort
for the 1990 ballot.
   The proposal got new life, however, when the Secretary of
State's office agreed to accept the signatures until midnight,
Fought said.
   The group needed 306,661 signatures, or 10 percent of the number
of people who voted in the 1986 governor's election, to put the
proposed constitutional amendment on the ballot.
   Spitzer said the LUV Ohio Committee _ LUV stands for Let Us Vote
_ collected between 250,000 and 275,000 signatures.
   Spitzer's committee began petitions in June after the state
Senate, despite passage by the House, rejected a bill authorizing a
casino in Lorain.
   The ballot proposal would go further. It would permit casinos in
seven so-called casino districts, generally surrounding and
including Ohio's largest cities, subject to approval of voters in
local elections.
   Spitzer, whose family owns car dealerships throughout central
and northern Ohio, says the plan would help create jobs and boost
the economy.
   He has talked of building a $300 million to $400 million resort
complex and casino in an abandoned shipyard in Lorain, saying it
would breathe new life into the northern Ohio steel city's economy.
   At a news conference, Spitzer blamed a late start on the
petition drive and a lack of people needed to circulate petitions.
``Time and people _ we didn't have enough of either,'' he said.

   James M. Markham, Paris bureau chief of The New
York Times, died Wednesday in an apparent suicide, the newspaper
said. He was 46.
   Markham headed the newspaper's bureaus in Saigon, Beirut, Madrid
and Bonn before his 1987 assignment to Paris.
   He reported for The Associated Press in New Delhi and West
Africa before joining the Times in 1971.
   Times Executive Editor Max Frankel said police found Markham in
his home in Paris on Wednesday morning and that they believe it was
a suicide. He did not say how Markham died.
   ``We mourn the loss of a wise and perceptive correspondent. Jim
distinguished himself on many continents and almost every day made
the Times a better paper,'' Frankel said.
   Markham was a Phi Beta Kappa graduate of Princeton University
and a Rhodes Scholar at Bailliol College, Oxford.
   Survivors include his wife, Stephanie; his parents; his sister;
a daughter; and a son.
   In its Thursday edition, the Times said Markham died apparently
of a self-inflicted gunshot wound. It said a hunting rifle lay next
to his body, but no note was found.
   The newspaper said Markham was named deputy foreign editor last
month and was due to leave France next month to take up his new
position in New York.

   Opposition parties used their new upper house
majority to force an embarrassing delay today in Parliament's
confirmation of Toshiki Kaifu as Japan's third prime minister in 10
weeks.
   Kaifu, elected Tuesday to head the governing Liberal Democratic
Party, was approved as prime minister by the more powerful lower
house. But in a move likely to signal future legislative
difficulties, the opposition-dominated upper house then voted for
Japan Socialist Party Chairwoman Takako Doi.
   It was the first time in 41 years that the two houses disagreed

   Delegates from the two chambers were to meet later today to go

   The Soviets were listening and
journalists had reported for weeks on Columbia's payload, so why
did military and NASA officials go to the trouble of keeping the
launch time and other details secret?
   ``By being inexact about the launch time, it complicates their
ability to track,'' Lt. Col. Ron Rand, Air Force spokesman, said of
the Soviets. ``They may or may not listen in, but we're going to do
everything we can to keep the payload anonymous.''
   But scientists who attended Tuesday's launch of the Defense
Department's fourth shuttle mission said the military shroud won't
stop the Soviets from finding out all about the reconnaissance
satellite Columbia and its five astronauts are believed to be
launching.

   Drug abuse is not merely a ``black problem''
but a national dilemma that will require major resources to solve,
say leaders attending the national Urban League convention.
   ``We can't talk about the future we want to see for urban
America without talking about the No. 1 threat in our inner cities
today: illegal drugs,'' President Bush told the league Tuesday, as
the drug issue received heavy attention from the largely black
organization.
   Urban League President John E. Jacob, in an interview Tuesday,
said, ``We believe the federal government ought to ... mobilize
this nation to a realization that this is not a black problem but a
national problem that will require national resources.''
   But Jacob and others attending the meeting called for efforts to
protect the innocent during crackdowns in housing projects.

   The stock market's recent climb toward record
highs is worrying some investors who wonder whether the elevation
in stock prices will be followed by a plunge like the October 1987
crash.
   Nearly a third of the paper value of stocks was wiped out in the
crash and the weeks preceeding it. With the market on a path
remarkably similar to the one it followed the months before the
crash, comparisons to 1987 are being drawn.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials rose 4.18 to finish at
2,699.17 Tuesday, approaching the record 2,722.42 close of Aug. 25,
1987.
   The current rally's apologists point to dissimilarities in
market conditions between then and now that they contend should
lead to a much happier outcome this time.

   Dave Purchase spends most afternoons
trading gossip with a slow parade of drug addicts on a gritty
downtown sidewalk.
   But Purchase, a cheerful, engaging man, has something else to
swap with the drug users he calls ``just folks'' and counts among
his friends.
   ``How ya doin', pumpkin?'' he asks a woman with haunted eyes as
he hands her a clean hypodermic needle for the used one she drops
into a little red box sitting on a folding table. ``Not too bad,''
she says with a tired smile.
   ``That's great,'' Purchase booms. ``That's great.''
   A woman with a headful of tiny black braids brings Purchase a
pair of needles she had used to feed a heroin habit. She lingers in
the feeble sunshine with fellow junkies to watch the action. Down
the street, a squad car screeches to a stop and a policeman alights
to drag a fallen-down drunk to the curb.
   ``I shoot heroin ... I'm a dope fiend,'' the woman with braids
tells a visitor. ``But I come down here most every day for clean
needles. I like the high, man, but I don't want to die for it. I
don't want no AIDS.''
   The 31-year-old woman, who gave her name only as Stephanie,
talks of enrolling in a treatment program to kick her 10-year
habit. She points at Purchase. ``The rig man there _ he cares what
happens to us.''
   In this neighborhood of half-abandoned buildings, sagging
fences, and weed-choked lots, Purchase and his crew of county
health workers have built what is hailed as the nation's first
successful program to reduce the number of dirty needles among drug
addicts in an attempt to slow the spread of AIDS.
   The program, which swaps 1,500 clean needles for dirty ones a
week, is being studied or at least partly duplicated in places like
Honululu, Boulder, Colo., and San Francisco. Observers are
impressed by an unexpected bonus: new access to elusive inner-city
addicts and a chance to help break their habits.
   Critics include Bush administration officials who say backers of
such programs have yet to show they slow the spread of AIDS. State
lawmakers and some treatment experts say Tacoma's program not only
violates the state's drug paraphernelia law, but that it tacitly
sanctions illegal drug use.
   ``To put up a little table to exchange needles like Mr. Purchase
does is like Alcoholics Anonymous putting up a bar on the sidewalk
and giving out free drinks while passing out pamphlets against
drunk driving,'' said the Rev. Joe Ellis, whose Tacoma Rescue
Mission is just up the street from where Purchase hands out needles
every afternoon but Sunday.
   Purchase has little patience for critics like Ellis. ``You know
what these people are really saying? They are saying, `Let 'em
die.' Either that or they haven't seen the evidence that
needle-sharing is spreading AIDS.''
   Purchase, 49, a former drug counselor, won local government
funding and staff in January after launching the program with his
own money a year ago as a personal war on the spread of acquired
immune deficiency syndrome.
   The $45,000 program's purpose is simple, he said. ``If you want
to slow the spread of AIDS, you have to slow the spread through
dirty needles.'' Homosexual contact has been surpassed by shared
needles as a cause of AIDS' spread.
   Intravenous drug users account for 27 percent of all AIDS cases
nationally; as of mid-July, 99,936 Americans had contracted the
disease and 58,014 of those had died. In Washington, 1,383 had been
diagnosed and 753 of them have died.
   Purchase's war on dirty needles has drawn applause in the sad
underground of street addicts and among many health officials. But
he is quick to note he'd be out of business if authorities decided
to enforce a misdemeanor state law against delivering or possessing
syringes without a prescription.
   Tacoma officials have permitted the program to continue because
``these people are not trying to commit criminal acts'' but rather
are waging a war on AIDS, said Tom Felnagle, chief criminal deputy
prosecutor for Pierce County.
   Purchase, a drug counselor for 20 years, says he owes addicts a
great deal. which is why he contracted with a medical supply house
a year ago to distribute needles himself, no questions asked.
   ``I worked in the business since 1969. These people paid my
mortgage, put food on my table; I mean I've been living off their
misery for 20 years like any decent social worker. I decided to do
something for them.''
   County Health Director Dr. Al Allen, is excited at the new
bridge to this industrial port city's most elusive underclass _
longtime IV drug users. ``You do have to go to people you might not
feel comfortable with, on their terms, and be willing to wash their
feet, so to speak, if you want to reach them.''
   Working out of a van, Purchase and his crew also hand out
condoms, little bottles of bleach to clean needles, and blueberry
muffins. An outreach health worker is always with them, ready to
offer counseling and other help.
   County officials say they have found a ``substantial decrease''
in needle sharing as a result of the program and have referred more
than 150 addicts for treatment after Purchase and his crew
cultivated a relationship with them.
   Opponents like Ellis and state lawmaker Charles Wolfe, a Spokane
physician who failed this year to win legislation against needle
exchange, note that backers have not demonstrated the program slows
the spread of AIDS.
   Worse, Ellis asserts, the program is unnecessary because AIDS
among local IV drug users is no where near as bad as in New York
City and elsewhere. ``They are using East Coast statistics to
justify the idea here,'' he said.
   He bristled at the suggestion that he would just as soon let
AIDS victims die. ``We spend over $2 million a year on drug and
alcohol programs. Does that sound like somebody who wants to let
them die?''
   Another heath department spokesman, Terry Reid, said it's unfair
to expect the program to demonstrate in less than several years
that it slows the spread of AIDS. ``How can you demonstrate success
a year after the program starts when the incubation period for the
disease is about seven years?''
   Purchase puts it another way: ``If we're wrong, then we wasted a
few cents a needle. If we're right, we saved a lot of lives.''
   As a steady stream of addicts stopped at Purchase's table,
Stephanie leaned against a wall and explained addicts' willingness
to use the program:
   ``We don't have to give our name. We don't have to do nothin'
but bring the rig man a dirty needle for a clean one and the cops
don't bother us. It's easy, and I think it's workin'. Hey, dope
fiends aren't sharin' their needles like they used to, 'cause they
can get clean ones without a lot of problems.''

   A minister-author charges that the Rev.
W.A. Criswell of Dallas, a leader in the fundamentalist rise to
power in the Southern Baptist Convention, plagiarized material in
his popular book, ``Why I Preach That the Bible is Literally True.''
   As reported by Ed Briggs, religion writer for the Richmond
Times-Dispatch, the Rev. Gordon James, a Dallas writer, cited 15
examples in which he claims Criswell lifted sections from Reuben
Archer Torrey's 1907 book, ``Difficulties and Alleged Errors and
Contradictions in the Bible.''
   Criswell, 79, pastor of the 21,000-member First Baptist Church
in Dallas and a former Southern Baptist president, was quoted as
saying, ``I'm not conscious of lifting anything out of anybody's
volumes, published or anything else, unless I said `so-and-so said
so-and so'.''
   He added, ``Now what I did, of course, and still do, is read a
great deal and some of those things I'm sure could have stayed in
my mind.'' However, he said later he did not recall reading
Torrey's book.
   James, listing page-by-page examples of alleged plagiarism,,
asked Criswell's denominational publisher, Broadman Press of
Nashville, Tenn., to withdraw the book from circulation.
   Dessel Aderholt, Broadman director, said that would not be done,
but if the book goes into another edition, ``we would want to
consult with the author and explore the possibility of making some

<HEAD>Many Hispanic Catholics Shifting To Evangelical Congregations</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GEORGE W. CORNELL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Religion Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Although most were reared in Roman Catholicism,
Hispanics in growing numbers are switching to evangelical churches,
pleasing those congregations but worrying Catholic leaders.
   Both seek to meet special needs of Spanish-descended Americans.
   Swelled by a modern tide of immigration, they now number nearly
20 million in this country, most of them Catholics. But studies
indicate a heavy defection rate to Protestant churches of
evangelical style.
   ``The movement of U.S. Hispanics to evangelical Protestantism is
a historic event of great significance,'' says the Rev. Allan
Figueroa Deck, a Catholic specialist on Hispanic ministry.
   ``Protestantism is achieving a foothold in the Hispanic world, a
massive presence, that it has never enjoyed before.''
   Evidence of such evangelical inroads into Catholicism has turned
up in many Latin American countries as well as in the United States.
   Deck, of the Jesuit School of Theology at Berkeley, Calif., says
the success of the evangelicals ``is directly related to the heat,
the passion, with which its adherents communicate their message.''
   ``Hispanics generally like that,'' he writes in the national
Catholic weekly, America, but it's not the style of the typical
orderly, reasoned U.S. Catholic service, generally shunning
emotionalism.
   Surveys by the Chicago-based National Opinion Research Center
indicate a steady increase during the last decade in the proportion
of U.S. Hispanics who are Protestants, now amounting to 23 percent.
   That is up from 16 percent in the l970's. In those years, 77
percent listed themselves as Catholic, and 7 percent other or no
religion, but the l982-86 figures indicate only 71 percent remain
Catholic.
   The Rev. Andrew Greeley, Catholic sociologist, novelist and a
senior associate at the research center, calculates Hispanic shifts
from Catholicism to Protestantism at 60,000 a year _ nearly a
million over the last 15 years.
   ``The Protestant segment of Americans of Hispanic origin is not
only large, it is growing rapidly,'' he writes in America.
   He notes that the defection rate is lower among
Mexican-Americans, 15 percent, than among Puerto Ricans, 24
percent, and others, 26 percent, and lower in the West than in the
East.
   Storefront evangelical churches attracting Hispanics have
proliferated in major cities in the East and also on the West Coast.
   ``More than three-fourths of the Spanish-origin Protestants are
either Baptists or fundamentalists,'' Greeley says.
   ``Hispanics have joined fervent Protestant groups in which their
religion provides them with intense activity and community
support,'' he says, adding that Catholicism apparently fails to
meet those ``emotional, communal needs.''
   The same point is emphasized by Deck, president of the Academy
of Catholic Hispanic Theologians in the United States.
   He says the fundamental problem for Catholicism is the
``inflexibility of the parish,'' whose operations are ``often out
of gear with the dispositions and needs of Hispanics.''
   ``The sense of being at home _ achieving an environment that is
welcoming and familiar _ is extremely hard to attain in the large,
urban, ethnically mixed parish,'' he says.
   ``U.S. Catholicism is very uncomfortable with the cultural core
of Hispanic Catholicsm: popular religiosity. It views all of that
as at best quaint and at worst superstitious...
   ``Enthusiastic religion and affective approaches are downplayed.
... Our liturgies are orderly and even elegant, our preaching
calmly reasoned and conversational. Rhetoric and even eloquence are
shunned. ...''
   He says the evangelical Protestant appeal to Hispanics stresses
factors of ``personalism and community,'' small, hospitable
congregations and ministers from the Hispanic community.
   To accomplish those characteristics, he suggests reviving the
so-called national or ethnic parishes, popular in past periods of
other Catholic immigrants, now integrated into society, their
special parishes outmoded.
   However, he says a new wave of immigrants indicates reviving
such special arrangements to meet the need of Hispanics ``for a
sense of acceptance,'' their ``own turf'' and ministers adapted to
their language and customs.
   Such adaptations are applied in evangelical denominations such
as Southern Baptists. It has 2,300 Hispanic pastors and a total of
2,612 Hispanic congregations, up 40 percent in this decade.
   Catholicism, although more than three times bigger, has fewer
Hispanic priests _ estimated under 2,000.
   United Methodists are working to extend a National Plan for
Hispanic Ministry, developed in 1986.
   Catholic bishops at their June meeting in South Orange, N.J.,
took steps for implementing a plan for special efforts among
Hispanics to cope with evangelical proselytism.
   A Catholic bishop criticized some of that proselytism as
deceptive. This was disputed by a Southern Baptist leader, who said
Hispanics simply were being offered the Ggospel message of hope.

   Standing beside Mother Goose's house, talking
to Little Bo Peep seems an odd way to learn about Showtime's new
``Nightmare Classics.''
   The apparent contradiction illustrates how busy Shelley Duvall
is these days.
   During an interview, she's dressed as Bo Peep for her production
of ``Mother Goose Rock 'n' Rhyme'' for the Disney Channel. She's
also executive producer of the new horror series for the Showtime
pay television network.
   ``Nightmare Classics'' premieres Saturday with ``Turn of the
Screw,'' Henry James' Victorian suspense tale, starring Amy Irving,
David Hemmings and Paul Balthazar Getty.
   ``We're doing the classic stories of psychological horror rather
than the contemporary gore,'' said Duvall. ``We're selecting the
tales from Henry James, Edgar Allan Poe, Robert Louis Stevenson. We
have a low budget, so part of the selection process is finding
stories from the approximate same period so we could use the same
sets. There's more than one way to skin a cat.''
   One show, ``The Eyes of the Panther,'' based on two stories by
Ambrose Bierce, required log cabins that they haven't figured out
yet how to re-use.
   Other episodes are ``Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde'' and ``Carmilla.''
   Duvall was on the set of her musical fantasy about the abduction
of Mother Goose. The house had a huge goose head on the roof and
next to it was the house belonging to the Old Woman Who Lived in a
Shoe. Overhead, huge tufts of cotton clouds were suspended from the
blue cloth sky.
   As Bo Peep, she was dressed in a long red wig, a broad-brimmed
hat, a frilly tutu, red-and-white stripped stockings and platform
wedgies. Her dog, Gizmo, a mixture of Pomeranian and cairn terrier
with a recent short haircut, was at her feet.
   The fairy tale musical also stars Garry Shandling and Teri Garr
as Jack and Jill, Howie Mandell as Humpty Dumpty, Cyndi Lauper and
Woody Harrelson as Mary and her lamb, Harry Anderson as Peter
Piper, Little Richard as Ole King Cole, Art Garfunkel as the
bartender at Georgie Porgie's Lounge and Deborah Harry as the Old
Woman Who Lived in a Shoe, Jean Stapleton as Mother Goose and Dan
Gilroy as her son Gordon Goose.
   ``Dan's never had any experience, but he's a natural actor,''
she said. ``Everybody wanted me to find someone more experienced,
but I stuck to my guns. The only mistake I made was when I didn't
go with my instincts. Bob Altman found me in Houston and I had no
experience. He took a chance on me.''
   In all, Duvall has starred in seven Robert Altman movies,
including a role as Olive Oyl in ``Popeye.'' She's produced two
other series for Showtime. Her first was ``Faerie Tale Theatre''
and the second was ``Shelley Duvall's Tall Tales and Legends.'' Her
longtime collaborator is Bridget Terry, who's producing ``Dinner at
Eight,'' starring Lauren Bacall, Marsha Mason and Charles Durning,
for Turner Network Television.
   Actually, the distance between fairy tales and horror stories is
quite short.
   ``Fairy tales can be very scary,'' said Duvall. ``The Grimm
tales particularly can be grim. Many of them were thinly disguised
political commentary. When I selected the stories for `Faerie Tale
Theatre' I had to be very careful.''
   Duvall produced 26 episodes of ``Faerie Tale Theatre,'' which
are now in syndication and are available on video cassette. She
feels there is a much wider audience for the stories since only
about six million people saw them on Showtime.
   She has also stopped production of ``Tall Tales,'' which is
going into syndication and videos.
   ``When I pitched `Nightmare Classics' I had the choice of doing
that or continuing with `Tall Tales,''' she said. ``I chose to
start the new series. I had a body of work with `Tall Tales' that I
could take and sell elsewhere.''
   Duvall said she enjoys running her own production company and
wants to produce all forms of entertainment. She's much too busy
now getting her company started, but said she'd like to try her
hand at directing, too.

<HEAD>Bush's Patient Approach Most Striking in a Crisis</HEAD>
<HEAD>An AP News Analysis</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By WALTER R. MEARS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Special Correspondent</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   From the outset, President Bush said his
administration would work patiently, persistently _ but probably
not very dramatically _ in the long, agonizing effort to gain
freedom for Americans held hostage in Lebanon.
   That applies even in time of crisis. It fits the restrained,
low-key approach the president and his lieutenants are taking in
the current situation, even toward the apparent killing of a
kidnapped American Marine.
   There is no lack of anger, outrage and frustration at the White
House. But venting it with threats of retribution would do nothing
to help the eight Americans still held captive of Shiite Moslem
kidnappers.
   Indeed, the dilemma confronting Bush, as it confronted his
predecessors, is that reaction, even retaliation, serves the
purposes of the terrorists who set out to create crisis in the
first place.
   The options are few anyhow. When he was vice president, Bush
headed an administration task force on terrorism which observed in
its report that American principles do not permit random
retaliation.
   Bush said he was outraged beyond words when the captors of Lt.
Col. William R. Higgins claimed to have hanged him on July 31 in
revenge for the kidnapping of Sheik Abdul Karim Obeid, a Shiite
cleric, by Israeli commandos.
   The president's voice broke with emotion as he praised Higgins
on Monday, calling him ``one who stands as a symbol of the courage
that burns in the breast of every American in uniform. ...''
   Hours later, the FBI said its experts had concluded that the man
shown hanging in a videotape issued by the kidnappers probably was
Higgins, but did not say how or when he died. Higgins was taken
hostage Feb. 17, 1988, while serving with a United Nations
peacekeeping unit.
   Bush talked with Higgins' wife. He made no public statement on
the FBI report.
   The administration says it is actively pursuing diplomatic
efforts to gain release of the remaining American hostages. At the
same time, it has reinforced the U.S. fleet in the eastern
Mediterranean. On Aug. 1, with Joseph Ciccipio under death threat,
word was relayed to Tehran that if any more hostages were killed,
the United States would hold Iran responsible.
   But the White House has been purposefully vague about what
action might follow, saying only that there has been planning for
every option. So, too, on speculation about possible ways out.
   ``There are a lot of ideas being floated, a lot of exchanges
being made, but it's primarily a matter of talking and listening
and not signaling your moves,'' said White House press secretary
Marlin Fitzwater. ``We will be careful not to respond to every new
development, new statement, new idea. ...'' He said there are going
to be a lot of them.
   Fitzwater also said the administration does not expect a quick
resolution of the hostage situation, which already is measured in
years.
   Militant Moslem groups now hold at least 16 foreign hostages.
The American held longest is Terry Anderson, now 41, chief Middle
East correspondent of The Associated Press, seized in Beirut on
March 16, 1985.
   Before he was inaugurated, Bush said he would explore every path
that might point to freedom for the hostages. He said he could
foresee a day of better U.S. relations with Iran, and that it could
be hastened by Iranian steps to ease the hostage situation. But he
said he did not expect a swift, dramatic breakthrough.
   Now his administration is trying to transform a crisis into a
solution.
   Offering advice is easier.
   The Senate adopted one resolution saying Bush should determine
whether the United States can retaliate against the killers of
Higgins ``in a manner that would reduce the risk to Americans from
terrorism.'' Then it adopted another asking the CIA and the
Pentagon for a report by Sept. 1 on how best to locate and rescue
the remaining American hostages.
   Neither is realistic but then, neither is binding.

<TEXT>
   As they join the growing numbers of the
``working retired'' in this country, many people find themselves
facing an unhappy tradeoff.
   It's common these days to regard retirement as a chance to start
a second career, to keep working part time as a consultant, or to
see if a longtime hobby can be turned into a legitimate livelihood.
   But the more money you can earn from such an endeavor, the more
likely you are to forfeit some or all of your annual Social
Security benefits.
   Under the rules prevailing this year, retirees aged 62 to 64
lose $1 in Social Security benefits for every $2 they earn above
$6,480 in any given year.
   In the 65 to 69 age group, the cutoff point is $8,880. Next
year, it's slated to rise to $9,360, beyond which $1 in benefits
will be negated for every $3 earned.
   The restrictions don't apply to anyone aged 70 or older.
   If you're drawing Social Security and working at a salaried job,
there isn't much you can do about this situation _ other than lobby
for, and hope for passage of, legislative proposals to make the
limits more generous.
   But if you can set yourself up as an independent consultant
working for yourself and selling your services to others, you may
have more flexibility, says William Brennan, editor of the monthly
Financial Planning Reporter published by the accounting firm of
Ernst &amp; Young.
   In such circumstances, Brennan says, you might consider
postponing receipt of income from your work to future years in
order to minimize the bite of the Social Security limits.
   With the notable exception of fees collected by people serving
on boards of directors, ``self-employment earnings are only counted
when received, not when `earned,''' he points out.
   Thus, for example, a 64-year-old retiree doing free-lance
carpentry work this fall might choose to delay sending out some
bills until yearend, so that payment doesn't count toward 1989
earnings.
   At age 69, the incentive to defer compensation would be
especially strong, since earnings are subject to no limit in the
following year.
   To do this sort of thing, of course, you need to be able to
establish that you are truly self-employed, Brennan cautions.
``Providing consulting exclusively to your former employer probably
won't work,'' he says.
   Beyond having more than one customer, he observes, ``the real
test is the extent of your independence to make your own decisions
and set your own schedule.''
   There also could be some pitfalls awaiting people who are
legally eligible to defer compensation, Brennan adds. The strategy
could go awry if income tax rates are increased in future years.
   If payment is put off for a significant time, inflation may
erode its value and it may not be available for you to invest it
for interest, dividends or capital gains.
   There's also the question of how confident you are about the
customer's ability and willingness to pay up when you eventually
want to collect.
   As popular as deferral strategies may be, Brennan concludes, it
is prudent to make sure beforehand that their disadvantages won't
outweigh their benefits.

   Consumers have to be given some credit for the
manner in which they have behaved in recent months, counting their
money and retreating from high prices and borrowing costs.
   They beat the carmakers at their own game, declining to pay full
price and forcing them to offer rebates and discounts in order to
cut inventories. They have been slow to buy big-ticket appliances.
They are cautious.
   They have slowed their acquisition of credit, in part because
bank card borrowing comes at exorbitant rates these days and
lenders refuse to come down in line with other rates.
   Consumer credit in June did rise, but the tendency to go into
debt has receded over the past year. In May, the annual growth rate
was 7.3 percent, but in June it dropped to 5.1 percent.
   The tendency of consumers to watch their dollars does seem
contradicted by one area of credit: Bank card credit has continued
to rise. However, the disinclination of banks to lower their rates
_ 21.5 percent annual interest isn't uncommon _ that consumer
resistance, so clear in other ways, seems almost certain.
   Buyers also slowed the rate of increase in home prices. By
declining to chase the market, they've actually forced prices down
in some areas, a rarity. Buyers now have the uupper hand in most of
the country.
   They are showing their good sense in other ways too. Borrowing
costs on homes are falling, and many homeowners are planning to
refinance at lower rates. Again, it's a consumer's market: Banks
are advertising for customers.
   Meanwhile, consumers have been strengthening their cash
position. They have improved their savings; personal savings as a
percentage of income in June rose to 5.9 percent from 5.4 percent
in May and the total of $224.1 billion was the second highest ever.
   Personal income has been improving too. The improvement hasn't
been sharp but it has been healthy, especially since inflation has
been relatively restrained. Both, low inflation and rising income,
reinforce higher savings.
   These and other factors, including an unusually strong
employment situation, put the consumer in a strong position as the
economy slows. In a sense, consumers are in a position to dictate
in many areas of the economy.
   The situation is in stark contrast to conditions that prevailed
in the 1970s, when the consumer was on the run.
   So desperate where buyers in that decade that they purchased in
anticipation of price increases, and in so doing drove prices even
higher. They were panicked, convinced that they could save by
buying in advance of need.
   The situation today is reversed. Buyers are more inclined to sit
and wait, convinced that waiting is the way to a better deal. They
are patient rather than frantic. They are making the seller come to
them.
   It is a rather rare situation, but it is one that might help to
correct a slur on consumers _ that they are mere puppets
manipulated by clever marketers. If they can hold their ground they
might change some minds.

   Terence Davies has been to America a few times
now, but the English director hasn't stopped looking for Gene Kelly
to appear whenever the clouds roll in.
   ``The first film I saw was `Singing in the Rain,''' explained
the 44-year-old director. ``What an introduction! I thought life
was like that. When I'm in America, I still think that everybody
goes to high school, everybody has a car, everybody's rich,
everybody has wraparound teeth and everyone sings and dances so
spontaneously.''
   Hollywood musicals provided Davies, a native of Liverpool,
England, with the perfect escape from his own unhappy life. The
youngest of 10 children, his father was a violent man who
terrorized the family. He died when Terence was 7. Over the years,
his older siblings filled in details of their father's behavior.
Davies never forgot.
   ``When I was growing, I would get up and look at the house and
go into the street and say, `I must remember how it looks today.' I
don't know why, but I've got a very accurate visual and aural
memory. I can remember conversations verbatim,'' he said.
   ``Distant Voices, Still Lives,'' his new film, represents just a
fraction of those memories. Davies recreates his childhood by
showing the pain of a working class family in Liverpool in the
1940s and '50s _ their hardship increased by a violent father.
   But like ``Singing in the Rain,'' or ``Meet Me in St. Louis,''
another favorite of Davies, the characters of ``Distant Lives'' are
sustained by music. At any time, someone is likely to break into
song, maybe ``Bye-Bye Blackbird'' or ``Roll Out the Barrel.''
   ``Pastoral Symphony'' and ``Hymn to the Virgin'' are heard in
the film, too.
   ``The family would go to this pub and a few friends would be
over and everyone would have a sing-song,'' Davies said. ``They'd
go back to the house and have another sing-song. Everyone did it.
   ``I remember my sister was going to buy `10 Cents a Dance' from
`Love Me or Leave Me' (starring Doris Day and James Cagney). I was
agog for weeks on end. We were going to have Doris Day singing in
our house!''
   Davies new film shows how popular entertainment mixes with real
life and how the lines get blurred. He recalled the bright smiles
and lilting melodies of Hollywood musicals enhancing the dim
environment of his own city.
   ``When you came out of the cinema into the slums, you didn't
think, `Oh how we're terribly deprived.' It transformed the way you
looked at your life. You thought, `Isn't it fabulous? Wasn't Doris
Day fabulous in that number?' You were on a high for three or four
weeks.
   ``My sisters went all the time. I was absolutely thrilled with
`Meet Me in St. Louis.' They lived on Kensington Avenue and we
lived on Kensington Street. I was sure we were exactly alike. I was
just sorry we didn't have Leon Ames as a father.''
   He first wanted to act, appearing in amateur productions of
``Uncle Vanya,'' ``The Cherry Orchard'' and many other plays. In
1972, he went to Coventry Drama and stumbled upon a chance to
direct.
   ``I had written a screenplay, `Children,' which was the first
part of the autobiographical trilogy that I made over a period of
10 years. No one would do it.
   ``But there was a series on televison called `Cinema Now,' and
it told how I could apply to the British Film Institute for money.
I sent a script in and a year later was asked to go to London where
I was told to direct.''
   Life and fantasy again blurred. Davies, a complete novice at
directing, was terrified on the set and remembered bitterly the
crew's disrespectful treatment. Still, he fell in love with
filmmaking.
   ``I realized when I looked down the camera the first time that
this is what I wanted to do, even if I do it badly. You've captured
a moment and there was magic between the filming of it and it
actually taking place. It's still terribly exciting.''
   By 1983, with the completion of ``Madonna and Child'' and
``Death and Transfiguration,'' the second and third parts of his
trilogy, Davies had learned his craft.
   Each shot for ``Distant Voices'' was planned before the start of
filming, and he quickly cast Pete Postlethwaite and Freda Dowie as
his parents. Davies' only concern was how his siblings would react
to seeing their lives on screen.
   ``Their feelings were mixed,'' he said. ``It's opening up a lot
of suffering, but they're also very proud I'm a film director and I
go to America and have lunch at Malibu (Calif.). I thought it was a
homage to them, I didn't feel it was dirty laundry. They suffered
so much I thought it had to be told.''
   Still, Davies is disappointed that directing has taken the magic
out of his own movie-going experience. Reality has finally intruded
on fantasy.
   ``As soon as you create something, you've lost your innocence. I
miss going to the cinema and being absolutely transported by it.
Now, I'm too critical.''

<HEAD>Quebec Separatist Issue Back in Canadian Politics</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SOLL SUSSMAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MONTREAL (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A public opinion poll has thrust the issue of
Quebec independence back into the Canadian political arena,
although Quebeckers rejected separatism in a referendum nearly a
decade ago.
   The Gallup poll indicated that 28 percent of Canadians believe
French-speaking Quebec should become an independent country.
According to Gallup, it was the strongest support for separatism
nationally since the company's pollsters first asked the question
more than 20 years ago.
   Perhaps the most startling finding of the poll of 1,034
Canadians was that 27 percent of English-speaking Canadians and 36
percent of French-speaking Canadians favored Quebec's becoming a
separate nation.
   There long has been resentment in parts of English-speaking
Canada, especially in the West, of what is perceived as favoritism
or special treatment for Quebec. But the percentage of those who
would just as soon see it separate from Canada had not been
perceived to be as high as the poll indicated.
   Prime Minister Brian Mulroney, a native of Quebec, brushed the
poll findings aside.
   ``The heartbeat of the nation is strong, it's vigorous and it's
resolved to even greater unity,'' he said.
   ``It's kind of silly to ask Canadians whether they want to
divide their country or to strip their country. The answer, when
you strip away the varnish, is absolutely `no.'''
   Mulroney conceded that some linguistic tensions exist in Canada
but said that always has been the case.
   Indeed, a focus in the Canadian news media on the national unity
issue may be as much a result of a languid summer without much else
attracting attention as to any concrete developments in Quebec.
   Premier Robert Bourassa of Quebec, who opposes separatism,
appears virtually certain to win the election expected in early
fall, possibly with an even greater margin of victory for his
provincial Liberal Party than in 1985 when it won 99 of 122 seats
in the Quebec legislature.
   The Parti Quebecois, which found success with its separatist
message in the 1970s, has fallen on hard times, and the economic
prosperity that has lasted in Quebec along with most of Canada for
seven years makes this an unlikely time for a comeback.
   Quebec, Canada's largest and second most populous province with
6.5 million people, is 81 percent French-speaking.
   No one is predicting a new surge of the separatist movement. The
poll results were a reminder of how intractable the French-English
issues are in Canada and the difficulties of running a country in
which nine provinces are majority English-speaking and one
French-speaking.
   Among those expessing unease, however, was John Turner, the
retiring leader of the naional Liberal Party, which sits in
opposition to Mulroney's Progressive Conservatives.
   ``I have, during the course of the last six or nine months,
experienced and felt a deterioration in the mood of the country,''
Turner said. ``I believe all those who share with me the view of a
tolerant, bilingual federation working in equilibrium should be
concerned.''
   Quebec barely surfaced as an issue in the national election this
past November when the big issue was the free trade agreement with
the United States.
   Mulroney's victory allowed the pact to take effect as scheduled
Jan. 1, and Quebec was a center of support for the agreement and
its native son. Mulroney's Progressive Conservatives do not run in
Quebec's provincial elections.
   But the Quebec government's refusal last winter to remove its
restrictions on bilingual signs despite a Supreme Court of Canada
decision touched off resentment among the province's English
minority and in English-speaking provinces.
   French is required throughout Quebec as the only language on
most outdoor signs.
   There also has been growing realization that the Meech Lake
Accord, a constitutional agreement recognizing Quebec as a
``distinct society,'' may not make its deadline on June 23 for
ratification by all 10 provinces.
   The Atlantic coast province of New Brunswick and Manitoba in the
West have yet to ratify the agreement, and threats have been made
to reconsider ratification elsewhere before the deadline.
   The Meech Lake Accord developed because Quebec had refused to
join the nine other provinces in signing the national constitution
at the outset of the decade. The constitution still applies to
Quebec even without its signature, but the impasse makes it more
difficult for changes to be made on such national issues as native
rights and the way the Senate operates.
   Quebec voters rejected sovereignty in a 1980 referendum after a
dizzying decade in which power shifted from the English minority to
the French majority.
   The Parti Quebecois governed the province from 1976 to 1985 but
lost its spirit after 60 percent of Quebec's voters in the 1980
referendum rejected separation.

<HEAD>East Germans Fleeing to the West in Record Numbers</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CAROL J. WILLIAMS</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>BERLIN (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A sense of hopelessness has driven a record number
of East Germans across newly porous borders to the West this year.
   Private and government agencies who help resettle refugees say
they expect about 100,000 East Germans to make it to West Germany
by the end of the year.
   The number of despairing East Germans climbing, crawling and
catapulting their way across the border has swelled to a rate
unparalleled since the flood of escapees 30 years ago. That exodus
was dammed by the construction of the Berlin Wall on Aug. 13, 1961.
   And those braving the heavily fortified borders are now joined
by a new breed of escapees who obtain legal permission to travel
abroad then refuse to return.
   ``It is a sense that grows stronger each day among East Germans
that they have no hope, no perspectives for better days as long as
the current regime is in power,'' said Rainer Hildebrandt, director
of the August 13th Society that aids East German refugees.
   ``The fact that 50 percent of those escaping now are under the
age of 24 is testimony to the general despair felt there.''
   About 10,000 East Germans with legal tourist visas have sought
asylum in West Berlin so far this year, and at least 70,000 legal
emigres are expected by the end of the year.
   A West German official who spoke on condition of anonymity said
at least 200 East Germans are seeking asylum at West German
embassies in Hungary, Czechoslovakia and East Berlin.
   ``We advise against this method as there are continuing dangers
involved, and there is simply no way to accommodate people at the
representations,'' the official said.
   In Budapest, Hungary, where an estimated 130 East Germans are
seeking refugee status and access to West Germany, authorities have
hinted that they may recognize a right to asylum, but no decisions
have been made.
   West Germany's deputy minister for Inter-German Relations,
Walter Priesnitz, said recently that East Germans should not try to
leave without proper documents through Hungary, which also has a
communist government.
   In the course of democratic reform, Hungary has dismantled
nearly half of the 160-mile barbed-wire border separating it from
the West.
   Officials in Austria have been approached for help by 237 East
Germans who fled across the border since the Hungarians began
dismantling the barbed wire in May. But they estimate up to six
times that number have gone directly to the West German Embassy in
Vienna after arriving via Hungary.
   Judith Toth, the Hungarian Interior Ministry official
responsible for refugee affairs, has said a special refugee camp
will be erected in Budapest for those seeking asylum. But until
then, those seeking refuge at the West German Embassy now may be
forced to return to East Germany.
   Detlef Kuehn, president of the Institute for Inter-German
Affairs in West Germany, told The Associated Press that the West
German government advises East Germans to seek legal means of
emigrating, but he acknowledged that the majority of applicants
must wait years.
   ``It is hopelessness that is driving so many here,'' Kuehn said.
``There are no limits on the number of East Germans that we will
take in. But we have no interest in depopulating East Germany.''
   One East Berliner, who did not want his name used, said East
Germans are turning to Hungary as an escape route because the
prospects for reform in their own nation seem ever dimmer as Erich
Honecker remains the Communist Party leader.
   ``Erich Honecker is apparently a very healthy man, and as long
as he is alive we will have the status quo,'' he said.
   ``But right now we have a terrible situation because nobody
knows what the reality is. It is naivete and wishful thinking that
makes people seek help in another socialist country.''
   East German officials declined the discuss the isssue.
   ``These matters remain very sensitive, as you know,'' said
Herman Thost, a Foreign Ministry official in East Berlin who deals
with press relations.
   Honecker has told visiting West German officials his government
has repealed long-standing orders to shoot those trying to escape,
except in cases where other lives are threatened. No shootings have
been reported since February despite a rising rate of escapes.
   The August 13th Society calculates that at least 189 East
Germans were killed in failed escape attempts since the Berlin Wall
was built.
   At least 350 escapes have been recorded this year up to mid-July
over the wall and across the heavily fortified borders with the
rest of West Germany.

<HEAD>Philippines Land Reform Program Bogged Down</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CLARO CORTES</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MANILA, Philippines (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Once hailed as the showpiece of
President Corazon Aquino's government, the land reform program is
so bogged down in corruption and red tape and crippled by loopholes
that even the official responsible for it wants to change it.
   Mrs. Aquino signed the Comprehensive Agrarian Reform Law in
June, 1988, to redistribute land to nearly 4 million peasants and
free rural Filipinos from what she called ``their ancient poverty.''
   Land reform was widely hailed as essential to defeat the
20-year-old communist insurgency in the countryside and break the
grip on power enjoyed by powerful landlords.
   Last year, the government distributed 150,000 land titles
covering some 254,000 acres. Most of the titles were awarded to
rice and corn farmers, making the effort merely an extension of the
land reform program decreed by ousted President Ferdinand E. Marcos.
   Marcos' program covered only corn and rice-producing lands but
the Aquino plan encompasses all crop holdings.
   Critics claim the new law is so flawed that it stands little
chance of achieving its goals and of being more successful than the
dozen previous attempts at land reform since the 1930s.
   Under the program, expected to cost $10 billion, the government
will pay landlords for their land. Those who then take possession
must repay the government over 30 years at 6 percent annual
interest.
   Militant farmer groups claim few can afford to repay and have
proposed that peasants pay half a sack of rice per hectare (2.47
acres) a year for three decades.
   Most critics also cite loopholes favoring landlords. Landowners
can retain five hectares (12.3 acres) plus three hectares (7.4
acres) for each direct heir over age 15.
   The Department of Agrarian Reform acknowledges that it is
uncertain how much of the 24 million acres of agricultural land has
effectively been removed from the program by exemptions.
   Under the program, estates of more than 50 hectares (123.5
acres) are to remain untouched until 1992. The program also gives
landowners the option of establishing profit-sharing plans for
workers in lieu of transferring titles.
   Among those who opted for this alternative was Mrs. Aquino's
family, the Cojuangcos, who established a stock plan for workers on
their 12,350-acre sugarcane estate in central Luzon.
   A review committee suspended the implementation of the profit
sharing scheme after critics claimed Mrs. Aquino's family grossly
undervalued their property.
   ``If land reform means to set the peasant free from the
political and economic domination of the landlord which is the
essence of a genuine agricultural reform program then, on the
whole, it failed to break land monopoly,'' said Jaime Tadeo, leader
of the leftist Philippines Peasant Movement. ``What it gave were
just crumbs, a few leftovers.''
   In an attempt to get more large estates for redistribution
before 1992, the government offered landlords the option of selling
their property now.
   But in several cases, the government paid far more for the land
than it was found to be worth, triggering allegations of corruption.
   The most controversial case involved the proposed purchase of
4,666 acres in Camarines Sur province for the peso equivalent of
$2.9 million. The sale was blocked when investigators found the
land was worth only about $143,000.
   ``Those scandals have given more ammunition to those attacking
the program,'' said Rep. Edsel Lagman, chairman of the House of
Representatives' agrarian reform committee. ``Those supporting it
are now wavering and the skeptical are slowly joining those who
have been opposing it.''
   The scandal led to the resignation of Philip Juico as the
agrarian reform secretary and suspension of a voluntary sales
program pending a review of the more than 700 sale offers.
   Juico was replaced by Immigration Chairman Miriam Defensor
Santiago, who recently told a House of Representatives committee
that the current law is ``a hodge-podge full of inconsistencies''
and should be amended.
   She said the provisions for establishing ``just compensation''
for landowners was too complicated and that the reform aspects of
the program had been ``watered-down'' by landlord blocs in Congress.
   Mrs. Santiago also said the government lacks the money to
purchase lands under the current system.
   The government had hoped to finance the program in part through
the sale of assets recovered from Marcos and his associates. But so
far, that effort has generated only $340 million. About $140
million in foreign aid is also available for land reform.
   Problems in the land reform program have given the rebel New
People's Army a propaganda coup. It has announced its own ``land
reform'' program in which it distributes to supporters property
seized from landlords.
   The government estimates indicate the rebels have seized more
than 76,500 acres nationwide, but rebel spokesmen claim to have
handed out 111,000 acres in the central Visayas islands alone.

   The Christian Church (Disciples of Christ)
has decided to build a new seven-story, limestone and glass
headquarters building in downtown Indianapolis at a cost of $15
million to $18 million.
   Facing the need for major renovations in current offices, now
housed in three separate facilities here, the 1.1 million-member
denomination chose to erect the new headquarters.
   About 5,000 participants in the denomination's general assembly
last week joined in a celebration, ``blessing'' the new building
site, whose address will be 401 Indiana Ave.
   The headquarters staff numbers about 250. Construction of the
building is expected to begin in late 1990 with completion in the
fall of 1992. The Lilly Endowment, a funder of religious
organizations, has made grants totalling $2 million to assist in
planning and relocation.

   In New York, the Rev. Franklin Woo, director of the National

   A minister-author charges that the Rev.
W.A. Criswell of Dallas, a leader in the fundamentalist rise to
power in the Southern Baptist Convention, plagiarized material in
his popular book, ``Why I Preach That the Bible is Literally True.''
   As reported by Ed Briggs, religion writer for the Richmond
Times-Dispatch, the Rev. Gordon James, a Dallas writer, cited 15
examples in which he claims Criswell lifted sections from Reuben
Archer Torrey's 1907 book, ``Difficulties and Alleged Errors and
Contradictions in the Bible.''
   Criswell, 79, pastor of the 21,000-member First Baptist Church
in Dallas and a former Southern Baptist president, was quoted as
saying, ``I'm not conscious of lifting anything out of anybody's
volumes, published or anything else, unless I said `so-and-so said
so-and so'.''
   He added, ``Now what I did, of course, and still do, is read a
great deal and some of those things I'm sure could have stayed in
my mind.'' However, he said later he did not recall reading
Torrey's book.
   James, listing page-by-page examples of alleged plagiarism,,
asked Criswell's denominational publisher, Broadman Press of
Nashville, Tenn., to withdraw the book from circulation.
   Dessel Aderholt, Broadman director, said that would not be done,
but if the book goes into another edition, ``we would want to
consult with the author and explore the possibility of making some
editorial changes.''

<HEAD>Soviet A.A. Termed ``Reconstruction of the Soul.'' ^With Laserphoto</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GEORGE W. CORNELL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Religion Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   As head of the first Soviet office promulgating
the tenets of Alcoholics Anonymous, Helen Kuzmicheva says the
approach makes for ``reconstruction of the soul.''
   ``It offers not just recovery from alcoholism, but a program of
spiritual recovery,'' she says. ``It brings out a completely new
personality.''
   Ms. Kuzmicheva, an attractive blonde Russian of 38 and
coordinator of the newly opened Soviet-American Alcoholism Center
in Moscow, says the A.A. technique is being found as effective
there as in America.
   After all, ``we are human beings, all of us,'' she said in an
interview. ``Due to the changes being made in our country, we also
have been able to acquire the movement.''
   Among participants, she said, believers ``speak of God'' helping
them overcome their addiction. ``Others speak of a higher power.
They all recognize they need a higher power exerted to help them.
   ``As to what kind, they need time to understand it is God.''
   Such religious terminology may seem unusual for a
health-promoting agency in an officially atheist society, but
millions of people there are devout believers.
   However, A.A. itself steers clear of overtly religious
affirmations or criteria, acknowledging only that help of a
``higher power'' is essential in overcoming alcoholism, but leaving
that aspect undefined.
   Individuals may interpret that power as the group and its
mutually supportive associations, or may consider it the
Judeo-Christian God who acts in human affairs, or both. Whichever
involves a spiritual dimension.
   It is purposely kept vague, so as to take in all comers.
   ``God as you understand him,'' Ms. Kuzmicheva puts it, using a
typical AA phrase, meaning that the power is whatever recovering
alcoholics consider it.
   ``They had lost control over themselves and lost the very
quality of being human when they drank,'' she said. ``When they see
life with sober eyes, miracles happen in their lives. They grow
spiritually.
   ``They regain their best spiritual selves.''
   Ms. Kuzmicheva, a professional educator who served as a factory
personnel director before taking the post at the new Moscow center,
recently completed a month-long U.S. tour with three Soviet A.A.
members.
   Accompanying them was the Rev. J.W. Canty, a New York Episcopal
priest who had established the new Soviet center, and who in 1987
had started the Soviet's first A.A. group called Moscow Beginners.
   He says Soviet authorities initially were dubious of the
project, but their attitude has changed to ``cautious respect'' now
that they are ``seeing alcoholics get a second chance at life.''
   On the 16-city tour concluded in late June, the group had
addressed school and church gatherings, met with numerous A.A.
groups, usually in churches, but also with an atheist-agnostic A.A.
group in New York.
   They also toured various health facilities and met with former
Presidents Gerald Ford and Jimmy Carter and their wives, attending
a Sunday school class taught by Carter in his hometown of Plains,
Ga.
   Ms. Kuzmicheva said the Scripture lesson, as Carter interpreted
it, emphasized that when God gives his promises, they sooner or
later are fulfilled.
   ``This is very promising for our country,'' she said, adding
that recent liberalizing developments there pointed toward a more
fulfilling future.
   However, like America, the Soviet has immense problems with
alcoholism. Soviet leader Gorbachev in 1985 launched a campaign
against it, but popular resistance forced him to ease some of the
restrictions.
   ``Unfortunately the problem is very acute in our country,'' Ms.
Kuzmicheva said, estimating there are 10 to 15 million alcoholics
in a population of 290 million.
   ``We have seen how strong and spiritual the A.A. movement is in
this country and we hope to have the same success in our country,''
she said. ``It will work. It will work all over the world.''
   On the U.S. tour, the Soviet A.A. members often gave their
testimony in U.S. meetings, using only first names as customary in
A.A. Two of them were atheists, one of them a believer.
   They told of families breaking up, being repeatedly
hospitalized, but not being able to quit drinking until admitting
they couldn't without help of a higher power. Saha, 43, an engineer
and a non-believer puts it this way:
   ``With alcoholism, you have to admit despair before you
experience victory.''
   Ms. Kuzmicheva, not an alcoholic herself, says she is a
believer, but not a regular church-goer. ``Many did not believe in
God when they drank, but when they become sober, they begin to
believe. ''

<HEAD>Ford Ranger Changes from Work to Play</HEAD>
<HEAD>With LaserPhoto and LaserGraphic</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ANN M. JOB</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>For The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   A funny thing happened to the Ford Ranger on its way to becoming
America's compact pickup truck leader. It went from being a work
truck to being a personal vehicle.
   The change was more than just semantics. It went below the sheet
metal.
   Ford increased the Ranger's horsepower, jazzed up the outside
with two-tone paint and made the interior more car-like as the
Ranger evolved over the decade and its sales rose to more than
300,000 a year.
   Today's 1989 Ford Ranger reaps the benefits of all the changes,
with the automaker projecting at the close of the 1989 model year
that the Ranger will retain its title as the top-selling compact
pickup.
   The test vehicle was a 1989 Ranger XLT two-wheel-drive, the most
popular Ranger model because it offers a number of optional
features in one low-priced package.
   The XLT had such amenities as power steering, deluxe two-tone
paint, a rear window that slides open and AM@FM stereo cassette
player with clock. Price out the door was $10,464.
   The test truck felt sturdy _ like a truck _ and easily
maneuverable _ like a car.
   Its high profile offered a good view of traffic ahead, and its
cloth bench seats with center armrest and easy-to-read instrument
panel made for a comfortable interior.
   I did feel the jostling, shuddering of a truck-like suspension
over big bumps but it wasn't overly bothersome. There also was
truck-like road noise.
   The all-terrain tires and rear antilock brakes gave surefooted
confidence. The five-speed manual transmission was a bit notchy in
its feel but it and the new-for-'89 four-cylinder engine with eight
spark plugs performed admirably.
   Ford boosted the horsepower 10 percent this model year to 100
with the 2.3-iter, Twin Plug engine design that uses two spark
plugs per cylinder.
   It helped give the Ranger a more peppy ride and more power for
trailer towing. Fuel economy was commendable, with the EPA rating
at 23 mpg in the city and 27 mpg on the highway.
   I wouldn't advise trying to seat three across in the Ranger XLT
regular cab. The middle person would either have the gear shifter
between the legs or would have to sit sideways with the legs
dangling over to the other passenger's area.
   This year Ford added a column-mounted automatic transmission
shift lever to help solve this problem. If you get the manual
transmission and carry only two people in the regular cab as I did,
the legroom seems decent and seating is adequate.
   Ford also offers a Super Cab that has the largest rear seating
package in the compact pickup truck segment.
   Length of the test Ranger pickup box was 76.3 inches, bringing
total vehicle length to 175.6 inches. While that's considerably
shorter than the more than 194 inches of overall length of the Ford
F-150 full-size pickups, it's still sufficient room for hauling
wood, furniture and the lawn mower, if the occasion arises.
   Men between 30 and 35 years of age are 85 percent of the Ranger
buyers and they use the little pickup mostly for personal use, such
as driving to work, according to Beryl Stajich, Ford Division
compact truck marketing plans manager. Sixty-five percent are
married, but most do not have children.
   Many Ranger buyers are first-time truck buyers, he said, adding
that two-thirds either trade in cars as they buy the Ranger or had
a car as an alternative purchase. He called them middle of the
roaders who are educated with somewhat upscale, contemporary
lifestyles but are more entry-level in their purchases.
   ``They're looking for a good deal, a low purchase price,''
Stajich said. ``... And they can customize (the Ranger). It has
high flexibility.''
   He noted that when the Ranger first came out in 1981 Ford saw
the truck as something that would offer value to more traditional
truck buyers _ older, married men who would want to get better fuel
economy from their trucks.
   ``That was true for the first year,'' Stajich said. ``Then
Toyota led the way, adding youthful appeal to their trucks ... In
1987, we revamped our marketing and made the Ranger sportier.''
   Base price of $9,001 for the test Ranger is not the lowest among
compact pickup trucks. A similar Chevrolet S10, for example, starts
below $9,000.
   But Stajich said many of the features offered in the XLT package
are separate options on other small pickups, such as those offered
by Toyota and Nissan, and thus could add up to a more expensive
final price.
   Consumer Reports magazine rates the Ford Ranger two-wheel-drive
with four-ylinder engine as average in its reports of trouble from
owners of 1983-87 models.

<HEAD>Drugs, Poor Care Give Washington Highest Infant Mortality Rate</HEAD>
<HEAD>With LaserGraphic</HEAD>

<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Each day, Sidney Jones wages a frustrating and
sometimes futile battle to save the innocent victims of drug abuse
and poor prenatal care.
   ``When you lose a child there's a feeling of defeat,'' says
Jones, who as head of obstetrics at D.C. General Hospital is
confronted by Washington's infant mortality rate, the worst in the
nation. ``You've had every hope of saving this person and you
suddenly feel hopeless.''
   In the hospital's neonatal intensive care unit, eight babies lie
fighting for their lives. One is just 15 days old.
   He tests positive for the AIDS virus and has syphilis. His body
is not producing red blood cells properly, causing his stomach to
bloat.
   White swatches of cloth are bound around his tiny ankles,
holding down his legs to keep him from hurting himself. He suffers
from what doctors here call ``tremblisness.'' Adult drug addicts
call it the shakes. At just two weeks of age, this unnamed baby is
going through withrawal.
   His mother is a cocaine addict. Her name and whereabouts are
unknown. Hospital officials do not expect her to return to claim
the child.
   To varying degrees, this picture is repeated at urban hospitals
across the country, hampering efforts to reduce a national infant
mortality rate that already lags behind Japan and most of Europe.
Each year, about 40,000 American babies die before their first
birthday, for a national rate last year of 9.9 deaths per 1,000
births.
   Washington's rate of 23.2 per 1,000 births was more than double
the already distressing national figure, substantially above the
world average for developed nations of about 17, and far worse than
rates for Western Europe and Japan.
   In Britain, for example, the rate is 9.1 per 1,000 births; in
West Germany, 8.3; in France, 7.6; in Sweden, 5.7; and in Japan,
4.9.
   Washington's large black population is afflicted in particular
with high infant mortality. The National Center for Health
Statistics says black infants nationwide are nearly four times more
likely to die as a result of prematurity and low birthweight.
   Many of these babies suffer from seizures due to brain damage,
cerebral hemmorhage, increased heart rate and stunted organ growth.
   Most of the 244 infants who died in the District of Columbia
last year were born to drug-addicted mothers, many of whom sought
no prenatal health care at all, says Reed Tuckson, the city's
health commissioner. Under such circumstances, officials say, there
is frequently little that doctors such as Jordan can do.
   ``The reality is as tragic as we predicted,'' Tuckson says.
   Prenatal care in Washington costs an estimated $400 per mother,
but the lifetime costs of caring for low birthweight infants can
easily run into the tens of thousands of dollars, Tuckson says.
   ``If you went to Chicago or to Boston, you would see the same
phenomenon,'' says Gordon Avery, chairman of the neonatology
department at D.C. General. ``Other cities say between 10 and 15
percent of babies there are born to drug addicted mothers.''
   Avery says one pregnant woman he encountered went into labor
prematurely while snorting or smoking cocaine, which can cause the
uterus to contract and cut off oxygen to the baby.
   Of the children who do survive, many are abandoned. Hospital
officials have termed them ``boarder'' babies.
   D.C. General had 11 boarder babies last month. They remain at
the hospital an average of 124 days before they are adopted or
placed in foster care.
   The cost to the hospital for boarder babies last year was
$500,662, officials say.
   A commission of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services
Commission thinks a national plan to combat infant mortality may be
one answer to the problem.
   ``Thirty years ago, we as a nation made a commitment to to care
for the elderly,'' said Rae Grad, director of the National
Commission to Prevent Infant Mortality. ``The elderly can get
Medicare and Social Security. We are saying that we as a nation
have not made a commitment to children.''

<HEAD>Ted Has the Wizard _ But He Can't Show It</HEAD>
<HEAD>With LaserPhoto</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT BYRD</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   When cable TV pioneer and movie buff Ted Turner
bought the MGM movie library three years ago, he got ``The Wizard
of Oz'' _ but he can't show it on his own stations until 1999.
   Under an agreement hammered out at the time of the MGM purchase,
the Turner Broadcast System gave up television rights to ``The
Wizard of Oz,'' but obtained the rights to another classic, ``Gone
With the Wind,'' Turner's favorite film.
   Scarlett O'Hara and Rhett Butler thus left CBS for TBS, while
Dorothy and Toto set up camp with CBS, which first showed ``The
Wizard of Oz'' to television viewers on the night of Nov. 3, 1956.
   ``What happened was, Ted traded,'' said Karen Nicol of TBS. ``We
had the TV rights to `The Wizard of Oz,'' but Ted really wanted
`Gone With the Wind.'''
   Even though Turner can't show `Oz' on its TBS SuperStation or on
TNT _ Turner Network Television, its feature entertainment channel
_ that hasn't stopped Turner and his companies from marking the
film's 50th anniversary.
   Under license from TBS, MGM-UA Home Video will release its
``Golden 50th Anniversary Collector's Edition'' videocassette of
``Oz,'' complete with a ``commemorative videotape package.''
   Fancy packaging aside, the new version is being touted as a
videophile's delight _ fully restored, and with two added
sequences: a dance reprise of ``If I Only Had a Brain,'' performed
by Ray Bolger as the Scarecrow, and another musical number, ``The
Jitterbug.'' Both were cut from the film during editing.
   Missing from the home video version are the familiar
black-and-white Kansas sequences, before Dorothy crashes into Oz;
that's because they aren't really supposed to be black and white.
The film's first moments were originally filmed in sepia and white,
for a softer transition to the Technicolor splendor of Oz. Later
prints opted for the simpler black-and-white technique.
   ``It's a beautifully restored print, with the original
Technicolor at its best,'' said TBS' Frank Miller. ``And with the
Kansas sequences, in the original sepia tone ... it's really
beautiful.''
   It's not as if the old videocassette did badly; released in
1980, it's sold 600,000 copies in the United States, according to
TBS.
   In addition to the new videocassette, TBS also is releasing the
restored film for special screenings in theaters across the
country, Miller said.
   A new release of the score is coming out on compact disc,
including a recording Buddy Ebsen made during his nine days as the
Tin Woodman. According to ``Oz'' film chronicler Aljean Harmetz,
Ebsen suffered a debilitating allergic reaction to the aluminum
dust the costumers dumped all over him and was hospitalized,
leading to his replacement with Jack Haley.
   And if seeing the movie and hearing the score aren't enough,
``Oz'' fans, under a ``worldwide licensing program'' of Turner Home
Entertainment, can buy an oz-tentatious array of stuff:
   There's Oz clothing for the whole family, including maternity
wear. Ties. Jewelry. Costumes of the Scarecrow, the Cowardly Lion
and other characters. Greeting cards. Postcards. Buttons. Key
chains. Calendars. ``Bendable toys.'' Giftwrap. Lunch boxes. Beach
towels.
   All are for sale in ``The Turner Store,'' a souvenir stand in
the lobby of Turner's CNN Center building in Atlanta.
   Also available: ``dental reminder cards,'' to send cowardly
patients off to see the dentist _ which for some, can be as big an
adventure as going off to see the Wizard.

<TEXT>
   Actor Richard Comar says the set built for
``Bordertown'' is so authentic a cowboy from the Old West could
ride in and feel at home.
   An entire town was built on a ranch east of Vancouver, Canada,
for the half-hour weekly Western series on the Family Channel.
Sixty-five carpenters worked 5{ weeks to build the half-million
dollar town.
   ``Every building is complete inside and out,'' said Comar, who
stars as U.S. Marshal Jack Craddock.
   ``We film everything there, with no studio work at all. In the
winter the streets are muddy. The prop people came in and _ in the
general store, for instance _ they stocked every shelf and drawer.
If you open the lace drawer there's lace in it. The saloon has
antique bottles. The livery stable has period tack, and the saddles
are a hundred years old.''
   The show is set in a town that straddles the U.S.-Canadian
border. Comar plays a gunfighter-turned-marshal, while John Brennan
is Clive Bennett, a Canadian Mountie who goes strictly by the book.
French actress Sophie Barjac also co-stars as the town doctor. It
is a joint Canadian-French production that will also be shown in
Canada, France, Germany and Italy.
   Comar said he compares Craddock to a New York street cop and
Bennett to a London bobby. Craddock is a functioning illiterate who
is a pack rat and is terribly disorganized. Bennett is very
organized and a member of a semi-military organization. They have a
bit of an ``Odd Couple'' relationship.
   ``The authentic town and props help us get the feeling of what
the West was like,'' Comar said on a visit here. He was attired in
his costume: chaps, a handmade gun belt, and a heavy-duty cotton
shirt with a bib front that can be taken off when it gets dirty.
   ``Craddock's looking for a soft place to retire. He's a former
Texas Ranger. He worked on a ranch near Laredo and killed a Mexican
rancher's son while stealing horses in Mexico. In retaliation they
killed his son and daughter. That's when he went to Bordertown to
ease the pain.''
   The Western series has made a small comeback on the networks,
which have two shows this year, CBS' ``Paradise'' and ABC's ``The
Young Riders.'' But the Western is thriving on the Family Channel.
In addition to ``Bordertown,'' the cable network as ``Gunsmoke,''
``Wagon Train,'' ``Bonanza: The Lost Episodes,'' ``The Big Valley''
and ``The Rifleman.''
   On Saturdays and Sundays, the Westerns start at 11:30 a.m. EDT
with ``Roy Rogers.''
   The Family Channel has also ordered a new version of ``Zorro,''
to be made in Spain.
   ``They're considering a two-hour `Bordertown' movie,'' Comar
said. ``It would be the pilot we never made. It would be great to
get a superior story and to be able to flesh it out.
   ``We sometimes have a guest villain on the show, but we try to
concentrate on human relations. The things that are happening in
the town. People get tired of violence, so the jeopardy caused by
the bad guys is secondary. We've also had stories about real
people. In one show Bat Masterson came to town trailing four men.
In another, President Garfield's life is threatened when he comes
to town. He's assassinated elsewhere, however.''
   Comar is a former stage manager and lighting director for rock
groups and ballet companies. He lived in Paris for two years and
worked there off and on for six to eight years.
   During time off from ``Bordertown'' he went to New Zealand to
co-star with Susanna York in an episode of ``The Ray Bradbury
Theater.'' Last summer, he played a television executive in the
Home Box Office miniseries ``Glory, Glory.'' He was an FBI agent in
the CBS miniseries ``Echoes in The Darkness,'' and had roles is the
movies ``Switching Channels,'' ``Short Circuit II'' and ``Big
Town.''
   ``My wife, Leslie, and I moved to Los Angeles a year ago but
we've only spent three months in our house,'' he said. ``I've been
working in Canada or New Zealand. We're expecting our first child
on Labor Day.''
   Comar said when he auditioned for ``Bordertown'' it was for the
role of the mountie.
   ``I'm well-educated, I'm neat, I hate guns,'' he said. ``I'm the
complete opposite of Craddock. My wife hates it that I don't shave
for five months. She doesn't mind the long hair.''

arraigned on charges stemming from a federal probe of fraudulent
trading at the world's largest futures exchanges.
   Brian Sledz, 29, and James Sledz, 24, pleaded guilty Tuesday to
one count each of violating the Commodities Exchange Act. The elder
brother also pleaded guilty to one count of wire fraud, and the
younger to one count of mail fraud.

<DATELINE>NORTHPORT, N.Y. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   IBM has decided to drop its objection to
a Long Island computer distributor's use of the name Big Blue
Products Inc., but the owner of the smaller firm says the whole
experience has left him cold.
   Jeff Alnwick, owner of Big Blue Products Inc., says
International Business Machines Corp. had no right to question his
use of the name and caused his company to lose thousands of dollars
in lawyer's fees and missed sales.
   ``Their sneezing cost me $20,000,'' he said.
   IBM spokeswoman Cynthia Stevens said IBM has decided to let
Alnwick's company use ``Big Blue'' as long as there is no confusion
and Alnwick's company does not trade on IBM's reputation.
   Alnwick, owner of a 5-year-old computer products distribution
company, received a letter in May from IBM telling him to stop
using the ``Big Blue'' name.
   Alnwick hired attorneys and discovered IBM's trademark
application for ``Big Blue'' had been denied just before the letter
was sent.
   Concerning the denial of the trademark application, Stevens
said, ``It's standard procedure ... It is not unusual. It is part
of the process with the Patent and Trademark Office.''
   She said has resubmitted the application with several requested
amendments. Both companies have ``Big Blue'' trademark applications
pending. In the meantime, IBM says it already has a trademark under
common law, even though it is not registered.

   Mergers and acquisitions in the field of
computer software and services slowed sharply in the first half of
1989, an investment banking firm said.
   The number of deals fell 12 percent and the value of the deals
dropped 65 percent, reflecting the scarcity of mega-deals,
according to Broadview Associates of Fort Lee, N.J.
   ``The industry is catching its breath after the exceptional
levels of activity in early 1988,'' Charles Federman, a partner in
the firm, said in a news release Tuesday.
   Broadview prepares the figures for Adapso, the Arlington,
Va.-based computer software and services industry association.
   The biggest deal of the half-year was the $320 million purchase
of Cullinet Software Inc. by Computer Associates International
Inc., the world's biggest software company.
   The figures did not include the buying spree of International
Business Machines Corp. because IBM did not buy entire companies.
So far this year it has made 10 minority investments, Broadview
said.
   The number of deals fell to 168 from 190 a year earlier, while
the value of deals plunged to $1.9 billion from $5.4 billion. The
value of deals was $2.1 billion in first-half 1987 and $1.9 billion
in first-half 1986.

   British investment in South Africa is still
thriving, according to a study released amid renewed international
pressure on athletes and businesses to protest apartheid.
   More than 200 British companies have subsidiaries in South
Africa, despite substantial disinvestment in the past three years
to protest the government's rigid policies of racial separation,
says the report released Tuesday by the Labor Research Department.
   The 20 largest of these companies employ a total of 230,000
people in South Africa, according to the department, a leftist
trade union research organization.
   Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher's government opposes mandatory
economic sanctions, saying they would hurt the majority black
population and neighboring black states more than South Africa's
white governing minority.
   But a group of foreign ministers from the Commonwealth agreed
Tuesday to recommend the 48-nation organization of Britain and its
former colonies adopt a new package of financial sanctions against
South Africa.
   The ministers also condemned renewed sporting contacts with
South Africa which threaten the 1990 Commonwealth Games in New
Zealand.
   Sixteen English cricket players have accepted invitations to
play in South Africa in the next two years, and Australian and
British rugby players have been asked to compete there later this
month.
   According to the investment report, the biggest British interest
in South Africa is the diversified mining company Consolidated Gold
Fields PLC, which has a 38 percent stake in Gold Fields of South
Africa. The gold and coal mining concern employs more than 102,000
workers.
   However, Hanson PLC said Monday it had completed a takeover of
Consolidated Gold Fields and has said it will sell the mining
company's South African interests.
   That would leave Imperial Chemical Industries PLC in top place
with a 38 percent stake in AECI, the South African chemicals
company which employs 26,500 workers, the report said.
   Lonrho PLC ranks third, with interests in platinum, coal and
gold mines, employing 9,428 workers.
   The report said Lonrho apparently has twice ignored voluntary
European Economic Community codes which seek to prevent new
investment in South Africa. Since 1986, Lonrho has raised its stake
in Western Platinum from 50 to 99 percent and revealed its 100
percent ownership of Eastern Platinum.
   Other major British employers in South Africa include Trafalgar
House, Unilever, Pilkington, BOC Group, BTR, BAT Industries,
Rolls-Royce, RTZ, Blue Circle Industries, Great Universal Stores
and Cadbury Schweppes, the report states.
   Rolls-Royce recently joined the list by acquiring Northern
Engineering Industries, which, the report says, profits from
international sanctions by manufacturing car engines that are no
longer built locally because other American and British car makers
have left.
   Several major British companies have pulled out of South Africa
in recent years, the report says, including the two big banks,
Barclays PLC and Standard Chartered, the packaging firm Metal Box,
cable company BICC and engineering firms IMI and Glynwed.
   The Anti-Apartheid Movement estimates total direct and indirect
investment in South Africa by British companies was about $10.24
billion, down from about $12.6 billion in 1987. Britain is South
Africa's third-largest trading partner behind Japan and West
Germany.
   Tuesday's report says the disinvestment campaign has had more
success in the United States than in Britain in part because
municipal and educational bodies have threatened to cancel large
contracts if companies did not sever their South African ties.

   McCaw Cellular Communications Inc. on
Tuesday announced a three-week extension of its $110-per-share cash
offer for all shares of LIN Broadcasting Corp.
   McCaw's action came more than a week after a LIN-imposed
deadline for a negotiated buyout pact passed without agreement.
   LIN, a New York-based cellular telephone, television,
broadcasting and publishing concern, said on July 31, its deadline,
that its board would pursue other options.
   McCaw's outstanding hostile tender offer of $110 per share for
LIN stock it doesn't already own had been scheduled to expire at
midnight EDT Friday. It will now expire at midnight EDT Sept. 1,
McCaw said.
   About 1.07 million LIN shares have been tendered, McCaw said
Tuesday.
   LIN has said the $110 offer is inadequate. There was no
immediate comment from LIN about the McCaw extension.
   The two companies said in mid-July they were talking about a
possible buyout at $127.50 a share. But Kirkland-based McCaw said
July 21 it had suspended those talks pending further review.
   After that, LIN set a July 31 deadline for reaching a definite
agreement under which McCaw would acquire LIN stock for $127.50 a
share, an offer that would value LIN's 53.9 million shares at
nearly $6.9 billion.
   But that deadline passed without agreement.
   McCaw is the nation's largest cellular phone operator.

   Industry analysts and Wall Street welcomed the
decision by Frederick Wang to resign as president of the troubled
computer company founded by his father.
   Share prices in Wang Laboratories Inc. jumped 20 percent after
the announcement Tuesday.
   Analysts said Wang's resignation signaled the Lowell-based
company's intention to get serious about its problems, which
include a recently announced $375 million quarterly loss.
   ``Like a general who lost a battle, he accepted responsibility
and it will have a beneficial effect on Wall Street,'' said Michael
Geran, a computer analyst at Nikko Securities Co. International Inc.
   The stock rose to $6.87{ a share from $5.75 on the American
Stock Exchange.
   Still, some analysts said the company will have trouble finding
a strong, independent manager to lead it out of its troubles as
long as An Wang, the company's 69-year-old founder and chairman,
continues to exert control.
   ``A good aggressive executive doesn't want to be No. 2,'' said
John Jones, of Montgomery Securities Inc. in San Francisco.
   The 11-member board of directors assembled for a special meeting
Monday night at Wang headquarters and the younger Wang resigned as
president and chief operating officer.
   The board named as acting president Harry H.S. Chou, currently a
vice chairman and director of the international computer maker. A
search committee for a new president was formed.
   Frederick Wang, 38, is a computer mathematician who worked in
the family business for 17 years. He was elevated to the presidency
in 1986.
   ``There is a general perception that (Fred Wang) was in over his
head. But he was dealing with basic change in the minicomputer
business,'' Geran said.
   ``I believe this action is in the best interest of Wang
Laboratories at this time,'' Fred Wang said in a statement.
``Employees and customers will be best served by a speedy
resolution to the company's current situation.''
   An Wang, in a statement, called his son's resignation ``in
keeping with his constant devotion to doing what he felt was in the
best interest of the company.''
   In November 1986, the elder Wang stepped down as president and
was replaced by his son but retained the job of chief executive
officer. The day his son resigned, An Wang had returned to work
part-time after recovering from surgery for cancer of the esophagus.
   The younger Wang will remain on the board and undertake special
projects.
   Prospects for the company ``depend on the health of the
doctor,'' Jones said, referring to the elder Wang, who holds a
doctorate from Harvard in computer science and often is called by
that title. ``If the doctor's healthy, they'll bring in a president
and they'll try to resurrect themselves.''
   The Wangs hold a controlling interest in the company and have
resisted any suggestion they sell it, preferring instead to try to
get the business back on its feet.
   Jones, the Montgomery Securities analyst, said stockholders
would benefit most if the company were sold or, at the very least,
if An Wang stepped out of the way.
   Last week, the company announced a $375 million quarterly loss
and said it it suspended dividend payments. Its financial
predicament put it in violation of a bank-lending agreement, the
company noted.
   Most of the quarterly loss resulted from a $237 million pre-tax
charge to cover the cost of a restructuring that involved closing
factories, cutting jobs in its worldwide work force of 28,000
people, and lowering the book value of outdated assets.
   Wang stock has lost more than 80 percent of its value since
early 1984, when it traded at more than $35 a share.
   Founded in 1951, the company made its reputation in the 1970s in
office word processors. But sales began to slip with the increasing
popularity of personal computers. Its minicomputer business fell
behind as well, eclipsed by workstations.
   Paul Henning, a Wang spokesman, said Tuesday of the resignation,
``We wanted to give a consistent message that we are doing
everything and anything possible, even taking steps that are
painful,'' he said.
   ``We have a lot of work to do,'' he said.

   Ellen Dolan and Joy Jackson have lived 14
miles from town and a mile apart since their teen-agers were
babies. They've been together through diapers, drought and dark
times in rural America.
   Now the two farm women have teamed up to sell popcorn to the
United Arab Emirates, ginseng to South Korea, taco sauce to Saudi
Arabia, hash browns to Australia and oat bran to Wal-mart.
   They are the guiding force behind AMTEX, a homegrown marketing
firm representing small to mid-sized Midwestern companies that
mostly produce so-called value-added foods.
   In 1980 Mrs. Dolan, now 44, was a country girl who planted her
peas and lettuce to suit her aesthetic sense, dabbled at art, and
exchanged dishrags with neighbor women at a monthly coffee klatch.
Her husband, Gary, farmed 2,000 acres with one hired hand and
brought in $750,000 worth of crops.
   But by 1986, when AMTEX was founded by Gary and some other
farmers and businessmen, the farm crisis had forced the Dolans to
buy back their home on the courthouse steps. Most of the machinery
was gone. So was the hired man. Gary Dolan was starting over on the
land, and Ellen Dolan became, without intending to or knowing how,
a fledgling entrepreneur.
   A couple of months after AMTEX started, its office manager quit
``and I was drafted to `make this thing work!' because I was the
only unemployed wife,'' said Mrs. Dolan.
   ``I came in here with no accounts and empty files. I couldn't
run the typewriter, I couldn't understand the concept. Every night
I'd leave here crying. I had no idea what I was supposed to do.
Sell soybeans to Japan? Impossible!''
   Today AMTEX represents 41 companies and is aggressively looking
for more. Mrs. Dolan and Mrs. Jackson, 37, who ``volunteered to
help Ellen get caught up and then we never did,'' say they still
haven't made any money. But they agree that every day they go to
work they feel as if they'll land a big contract.
   ``Enthusiasm is the key to this. We're opportunistic, we're
tenacious,'' said Mrs. Dolan. ``We keep reminding ourselves we sold
oat bran cereal to Wal-mart. If we did it once, we can do it
again.''
   It was their first big sale, full of hilarious foul-ups and
tough lessons.
   ``I wrote Sam Walton (founder of Wal-mart) a letter and told him
about AMTEX, then months went by. One day I got a collect call from
the head food buyer, who wanted us to come to Bentonville, Ark.
(Wal-mart headquarters), and show him our products. I told him I'd
have to call him back because neither of us had ever driven through
Kansas City.''
   Laughing hard at the memory, Mrs. Jackson said: ``I panicked and
told Ellen, `Oh, no, I can only drive to the Missouri River, I
can't cross it.' It was like a phobia. Neither one of us had ever,
ever driven in freeway traffic.''
   But after giving each other pep talks, they called Wal-mart
buyer Joe Craig back and said they'd come.
   ``We drove through Kansas City white-knuckle all the way, sick
at our stomachs, convinced we would die on the freeway,'' Mrs.
Dolan said. ``Then we just knew we'd never find Arkansas. Then we
were afraid we'd never find Wal-mart in Bentonville, which is
ludicrous looking back on it, because it's as big as the U.N.''
   Buyer Craig, now working in another Wal-Mart division, remembers
them as ``pretty sharp, open-minded and professional. I was
impressed with them from the beginning.''
   It took 18 months to close the deal, said Mrs. Dolan, ``and in
that time there was a worldwide oats shortage, not enough cardboard
to make the cereal boxes, the original oat bran maker was bought by
another company, and Joe Craig was transferred.''
   Along the way, the women got to know every restaurant in
Bentonville and just about every Wal-Mart receptionist.
   ``Some days this job makes us crazy,'' said Mrs. Jackson, ``and
other days it feeds our souls.''
   Every letter AMTEX sends begins ``Good Day from Trenton,
Missouri, USA!'' Correspondence wings its way from a 10-by-12 foot
cubicle on Main Street in this town of 7,000 to countries all over
the world, as well as hundreds of potential domestic clients.
   ``In return we get letters that begin `An Exceedingly Good Day
from Singapore,''' said Mrs. Dolan. ``It's a thrill because we
don't send three-paragraph corporate letters, we extend a hand in
friendship and offer barbecue sauce on the side.
   ``When we get an overseas call we tell 'em right off that we're
just two farm women in a small office and we're just getting
started, so don't expect a huge staff with BMAs from Harvard, or
whatever those fancy degrees are.''
   Added Mrs. Jackson: ``Somebody in Japan wanted an AMTEX flow
chart. I went home and asked my husband, `Honey, what's a flow
chart?'''
   They may not know the jargon, but they put in 10-hour days
trying to market foods such as smoked meats, bee pollen, popcorn,
Missouri wine and stone-ground flour, as well as homemade lawn
furniture and firewood.
   From the beginning, AMTEX sought help from the Missouri
Department of Agriculture and the U.S. Department of Agriculture's
foreign service branch, which publishes descriptions of American
products available for export.
   ``We operate on a shoestring, so we've become aggressive
guerrilla marketers,'' said Mrs. Jackson, explaining they use a
network of government services to make contacts.
   The two friends and co-workers also have become experts in
minutiae, trivia and exotica.
   ``We got a call from Switzerland asking us if we had Boletus
edilus,'' said Mrs. Dolan. ``Neither of us had the vaguest idea
what that was, but we thought it might be a plant. We went home,
found out in the encyclopedia it was a dried mushroom, tracked some
down in Poland and put the supplier and the buyer together by
Telex.''
   They also know where to find war-risk insurance, how to get
labeling in Arabic and which freight forwarders are most efficient
in Indonesia.
   Their jobs have changed them and opened new vistas in lives once
focused almost exclusively on home and family.
   ``Joy used to make wedding gowns and I used to watch the birds
feed,'' said Mrs. Dolan. ``AMTEX is my canvas. I talk about
nurturing it the same way I used to talk about raising my boys.
This is everything I never thought I'd do.''

<HEAD>Government Reports Consumer Debt Rose at Slower Pace in June</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN D. McCLAIN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Americans took out $2.99 billion more in
consumer debt than they retired in June, the government reported,
as the pace of borrowing slowed in part because of declining auto
sales.
   The Federal Reserve Board said Tuesday that consumer credit in
June rose at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 5.1 percent, down
from May's revised 7.3 percent rate. The May increase was revised
from $3.6 billion to $4.2 billion.
   Consumer credit increased 4.3 percent in April after rising 6.6
percent in March and 9.5 percent in February.
   Consumer credit increased 8.5 percent over all of 1988.
   Consumer spending is watched closely as a barometer of the
economy's health since it represents two-thirds of overall economic
activity.
   Economic growth has been slowing recently, prompting concern
that Federal Reserve efforts to contain inflation could move the
economy into a recession instead of the ``soft-landing'' it seeks.
   Economist Sandra Shaber of The Futures Group, a consulting firm
here, said the fact that consumer spending does not appear to be
collapsing helps take the heat of the economy and reduce
inflationary pressures.
   The Commerce Department reported earlier that retail sales had
fallen 0.4 percent in June, dragged down in part by poor sales of
autos. But excluding the automotive category, overall retail sales
actually rose 0.1 percent, it said.
   The Fed reported Tuesday that auto loans fell $267 million in
June, a 1.1 percent decline on a seasonally adjusted annual basis.
They had risen 4.5 percent in May and 3.3 percent in April.
   But Ms. Shaber said car sales increased in July, ``so I think
that the business of liquidating car loans is a very temporary kind
of phenomena that's not going to continue and you might see a
little bit of increase in car loans in July.''
   Leading the overall consumer credit increase in June was the
category of debt that includes credit cards. It rose $ 3.1 billion,
a 20 percent annual rate of growth, after increasing 13 percent in
May and 11 percent in April.
   Ms. Shaber said this reflects a shift toward retail credit, ``to
soft goods like apparel and small items.''
   Bank and credit union loans not secured by real estate increased
$404 million, a 2.5 percent annual rate of advance, but down from
7.2 percent in May and 2.8 percent in April.
   Borrowing for mobile homes fell for the fifth consecutive month,
declining by $257 million or 12.9 percent on an annual basis. That
followed drops of 2.l percent in May and 8.7 percent in April.
   The various changes left total consumer debt in June at a
seasonally adjusted $701.19 billion.

<HEAD>Nielsen Plans to Develop National Hispanic TV Ratings</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SKIP WOLLENBERG</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Executives of the nation's two largest
Spanish-language television operations say they will be better
equipped to compete for advertising dollars once a new national
Hispanic television rating service is in operation.
   Nielsen Media Research's service will attempt to define the
audience for Spanish-language programming among people who identify
themselves as Hispanic, information one executive called critical
to the growth of the medium.
   Nielsen, the leader in English-language TV ratings for nearly 40
years, said Tuesday it had signed a multimillion-dollar contract to
develop the Hispanic ratings service with the two largest
Spanish-language television operators, Univision Holdings Inc. and
Telemundo Group Inc.
   For several months, Univision and Telemundo have been reviewing
proposals from a half-dozen research firms for an Hispanic audience
measurement system.
   Executives of the two companies said the Nielsen Hispanic
ratings will help them attract spending by advertisers and agencies
who in the past have been skeptical about the estimated size of the
Spanish-language TV audience.
   Univision, a subsidiary of Hallmark Cards Inc., is the nation's
largest Spanish-language communications concern, operating a TV
network reaching 85 percent of the estimated 6 million Hispanic
households.
   Telemundo Group operates the nation's second-largest
Spanish-language network, reaching about 70 percent of all Hispanic
households.
   Plans for the Hispanic ratings service, disclosed at a news
conference here, call for a pilot test beginning this fall in the
Los Angeles area, which has a large Hispanic population. Nielsen
plans to begin recruiting 200 families for the sample group there
starting next month.
   Nielsen, a division of Dun &amp; Bradstreet Corp., plans to expand
the service nationally to 800 Hispanic households in late 1990 or
early 1991. Nielsen's national sample for all programming is about
4,000 families of all kinds.
   Carlos E. Garcia, research director for the firm Research
Resources in Agoura Hills, Calif., said the Hispanic population has
been growing much more rapidly than the general population and is
expected next year to reach 22 million, or about 10 percent of the
total U.S. population.
   There is some evidence that advertisers are beginning to
recognize the economic clout that this group represents, which
Garcia said the government estimates at $160 billion this year.
   Hispanic Business magazine estimated that 50 leading advertisers
spent $500.1 million on advertising to the Hispanic market last
year, up 12 percent from $490.7 million a year earlier.
   In the past week, companies such as Coca-Cola Co. and Burger
King Corp. have announced plans to increase their efforts at
reaching Hispanics with Spanish-language advertising.
   But Henry R. Silverman, chief executive of Telemundo Group, said
advertisers are spending less than 1 percent of their estimated $30
billion annual television ad budgets on Spanish-language stations.
   He said one reason was skepticism about the size of the audience
for Spanish-language programs.
   Telemundo and Univision subscribe to a ratings service that uses
weekly interviews to estimate their audience size, he said.
   Silverman said he expects the Nielsen ratings to confirm that 60
percent to 70 percent of Hispanic households are watching
Spanish-language television, and that once advertisers recognize it
their spending on the medium will rise.
   Nielsen plans to use so-called people meters for the
Spanish-language program ratings. The electronic devices allow
people to push buttons that immediately record who in the family is
watching particular shows.
   Nielsen has been using people meters for its national
English-language ratings service for two years.
   J. William Grimes, president and chief executive of Univision
Holdings, said Spanish-language television networks face the same
problems in dealing with advertisers as cable networks faced in the
early 1980s before Nielsen started measuring their audiences.
   He said programming improvements and Nielsen audience ratings
enabled cable networks to boost ad revenues to about $1.3 billion
this year from $50 million at the start of the 1980s.
   Grimes said the quality of Spanish-language programming is ``a
long way beyond'' where cable TV was at the start of the decade and
said the new Nielsen ratings could prove ``critical to the growth
of Spanish-language TV.''

<HEAD>Ampco-Pittsburgh Announces 6.6 Percent Stake in Airline</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By HERBERT G. McCANN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   In the wake of Ampco-Pittsburgh Corp.'s
announcement that it has acquired a 6.6 percent interest in Midway
Airlines Inc., the carrier's management is waiting to see whether
the suitor will seek control.
   Ampco-Pittsburgh said in a document submitted to the Securities
and Exchange Commission that it had acquired 662,000 shares of
Midway common stock through a Delaware subsidiary, Ampco-Pittsburgh
Securities III Corp. The filing was made public Tuesday.
   ``Ampco-Pittsburgh has not contacted the company in connection
with this investment,'' said David R. Hinson, chairman and chief
executive officer of Chicago-based Midway.
   The manufacturing concern said it bought the Midway shares ``for
investment and to acquire a significant equity interest'' in the
airline.
   Midway's stock reacted favorably to the disclosure. In composite
New York Stock Exchange trading, it climbed $1.50 a share to close
at $20.50.
   The SEC disclosure document said Pittsburgh-based Ampco ``may
also consider seeking to acquire control'' of Midway ``in the
future, although they have no plans or proposals to do so at
present.''
   According to the filing, Ampco-Pittsburgh Securities III bought
the Midway shares at prices ranging from $14.75 to $18 between July
25 and last Thursday for a total of $10.3 million.
   Hinson said Thursday that Midway had not been approached by
anyone seeking to take over the airline, despite heavy trading in
the company's stock.
   Midway ``has no interest in being acquired,'' he said,
attributing the stock activity to new interest in airlines as
takeover targets.
   Midway was founded 10 years ago at the start of airline
deregulation, when it served three Midwest cities from Chicago _
Cleveland, Detroit and Kansas City, said spokeswoman Sandra Allen.
   The airline now serves 51 U.S. cities, from Los Angeles to
Boston, and from Chicago to Miami, she said.
   Midway recently announced it had ordered 74 new jets from
McDonnell-Douglas worth about $2 billion.
   The airline, the nation's 16th-largest carrier, operates from
Midway Airport on Chicago's Southwest Side and has 4,300 employees,
Ms. Allen said.
   Ampco-Pittsburgh and its subsidiaries _ which include Buffalo
Forge Co. and Union Electric Steel Corp. _ make and sell engineered
products. Ampco is the sole shareholder in the subsidiary holding
the airline stock.
   The company is a mystery to some airline analysts.
   ``They aren't a big player,'' said Bob Joedicke, an analyst for
Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. in New York. ``I've never heard of
them.''
   Joedicke described Midway as a ``niche'' carrier, handling just
0.8 percent of the nation's air traffic.
   ``Their niche is that they dominate Midway Airport in Chicago,
which is much closer to downtown than O'Hare,'' he said.
   ``It has the advantage that a lot of businessmen appreciate
coming into Midway from New York,'' Joedicke said. He said the
carrier has ``developed quite a successful hub in Chicago for
east-west traffic.''
   Last week, Midway announced it had reached a $210 million deal
with Miami-based Eastern Airlines to purchase routes, gates and
aircraft from the strike-plagued carrier.
   The agreement must be approved by a federal bankruptcy court
judge as part of Eastern's strike-recovery plan to restructure into
a smaller airline.

<HEAD>Suez Launches Largest Takeover Bid Ever In France</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Compagnie Financiere de Suez says it is launching
France's biggest ever takeover bid, in a hostile offer for
Compagnie Industrielle, with which it shares control of Groupe
Victoire, a major French insurance group.
   The takeover proposal by Suez, a Paris-based holding company
which traces its history to the financing of the Suez Canal more
than a century ago, was said to be worth about $2.5 billion.
   Suez shares fell sharply in early trading today, reflecting
concern that the company is in for a long, tough battle that will
be costly even if it wins.
   The price dropped from 369 francs ($57.66) per share at
Tuesday's close to 347 francs ($54.22) just after today's opening,
but then rebounded to 355 francs ($55.47) at midday.
   Suez said Tuesday that if the bid is successful it will then
make a tender offer for Victoire's parent company, Compagnie
Financiere du Groupe Victoire.
   The Paris Stock Exchange said in a statement that Suez is
offering to pay 13,000 francs ($2,030) per share for the 81.53
percent of Compagnie Industrielle stock it does not already own.
   That would value the target company's total stock at 19.5
billion francs (about $3 billion) and the Suez offer would total
15.9 billion francs (about $2.5 billion).
   The previous record French takeover was a bid last year by
Schneider SA of about $930 million for control of Telemecanique
Electrique SA.
   But the success of the Suez bid is far from assured, with
Jean-Marc Vernes, president of Compagnie Industrielle, expected to
put up a tough resistance.
   ``Suez wants a majority, and I'm categorically opposed,'' Vernes
was quoted as saying in Wednesday's edition of the daily Le Figaro.
``I made proposals for an arrangement. But if we have to go to
battle, we will.''
   Last year, Suez won a bruising takeover battle with Italian
financier Carlo de Benedetti for control of the huge Belgian
holding company Societe Generale de Belgique.
   Groupe Victoire became much more attractive after making a
friendly acquisition last month of West Germany's second-largest
insurer, Colonia Versicherung AG. Suez said its bid would not
affect the Colonia takeover.
   Compagnie Industrielle's shares were last quoted on the Paris
Bourse at 9,750 francs ($1,525), before being suspended last Friday.

<HEAD>First Traders Arraigned Plead Guilty to Fraud Indictments</HEAD>

<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Three commodities traders accused of cheating
their customers became the first to plead guilty in the federal
fraud investigation of the world's largest futures exchanges.
   Brothers Brian Sledz, 29, and James Sledz, 24, Tuesday pleaded
guilty to one count each of violating the Commodities Exchange Act.
The elder brother also pleaded guilty to one count of wire fraud,
and the younger to one count of mail fraud.
   In addition, Thomas Braniff, 33, pleaded guilty to two counts of
violating the exchange act and two counts of mail fraud.
   The three men, yen traders at the Chicago Mercantile Exchange,
are among 46 traders indicted Aug. 2 in the FBI probe of the Merc
and the Chicago Board of Trade. Published reports have said as many
as 30 defendants are expected to plead guilty and cooperate with
authorities.
   After Tuesday's court hearings, defense lawyer Thomas Durkin
said the Sledz brothers aided federal investigators by agreeing to
wear recording devices to tape conversations of fellow traders.
   The Sledz brothers entered their pleas before U.S. District
Judge George M. Marovich. Additional defendants are scheduled for
arraignment Wednesday.
   James Sledz faces a maximum penalty of six years in prison and a
$350,000 fine, said the brothers' attorney, Barry Spevack. Brian
Sledz could be sentenced to 10 years in prison and be fined
$650,000.
   They have agreed to make restitution to customers, with the
amounts to be determined later, he said.
   The charges in last week's indictments range from pre-arranged
trading to racketeering conspiracy and tax fraud. Most allege
schemes in which traders pocketed part of the profit from trades
made for customers while passing their own losses on to customers.
   James Sledz's plea agreement said he executed pre-arranged
trades to make money for himself and his brother, and mailed
confirmation of the trades to customers in violation of exchange
rules, Assistant U.S. Attorney Mark Pollack said.
   Brian Sledz said he executed pre-arranged trades on behalf of
the Merrill Lynch &amp; Co. and Prudential-Bache Securities Inc.
brokerage houses to make a profit for himself and his brother. He
confirmed the trades through wire communication, Spevack said.
   Both acknowledged engaging in ``numerous pre-arranged trades,''
the attorney said.
   Braniff said in his plea agreement that he conspired with trader
Michael Sidel in July 1987 to defraud one of his customers by
pre-arranging two trades for yen futures contracts. Sidel was
indicted last week on charges of mail and wire fraud and violating
the exchange act.
   Braniff also admitted to conspiring with an unidentified trader
on two transactions in September 1987.
   Braniff faces a maximum penalty of 10 years in prison and a
$500,000 fine.
   The Sledz brothers sold their trading seats at the Merc in
January when the first media reports of the undercover probe
appeared.
   The three were barred from the floor of the exchange in an
agreement last week with the Commodity Futures Trading Commission,
which oversees the exchanges, and still face disciplinary action,
said Merc spokesman Andrew Yemma.
   The brothers were released on $4,500 bond each pending
sentencing, which is to be scheduled when the remaining cases
against yen traders are resolved.
   A total of 21 traders were indicted for alleged illegal
activities in the yen pit. The remaining 25 defendants traded in
the Swiss franc pits at the Merc and the soybean and U.S. Treasury
bond pits at the Chicago Board of Trade.
   While Brian Sledz's plea agreement did not name other traders,
Spevack said, James Sledz named three indicted traders with whom he
engaged in pre-arranged trades _ Joseph O'Malley, Sam Cali and
Michael Smith.

   A simpler car is in Chrysler Corp.'s
future as consumers find themselves overwhelmed by an array of
options and gadgets, the company's design chief says.
   Tom Gale, vice president for design at the nation's No. 3
automaker, said Tuesday that car buyers are overloaded with choices
to make when buying a car or truck.
   ``When you look at the marketplace of the future, where we have
the greatest opportunity is this whole field of back to basics,''
he said.
   However, he cautioned that cars can't look incomplete, like
basic cars of the past that had obvious places for clocks or
air-conditioning units.
   ``In a much larger sense, that's what we're struggling with on
how we handle the next generation of platforms,'' he said.
   Chrysler will be introducing a new basic design in late 1992 for
the 1993 model year. In Gale's world of designing for the future,
the cars that are built on those platforms are in the works today.
   ``When you get to a world where there are so many things, where
there is so much technology and there's so many models, different
models in different variations of those models, after a while, it's
a blur,'' Gale said.
   ``I think what the marketplace is telling us and what consumers
are telling us is `Hey, we're waiting for the guy who comes along
and just says, `Here's my Chrysler, here's my Dodge.'''
   During last winter's car-show circuit, Chrysler exhibited its
Dodge Viper concept car, a two-seater stripped of a lot of the
electronics that have made other cars more complex machines.
   Company Chairman Lee Iacocca has said a decision will be made on
whether to produce the Viper by early next year, and executives
have said Chrysler should build it.
   However, there is concern over whether it is economically wise
to build the car amid predictions of a continuing slowdown in car
and truck sales and a general softening of the U.S. economy.
   Two weeks ago, Chrysler's top 700 managers met in Detroit and
heard Iacocca outline a program aimed at taking $1 billion out of
the company's costs. Included will be a reduction in the
white-collar work force by about 2,300 people, or just more than 8
percent.
   Company executives said no plants would be closed and product
development plans would remain in place during the cost-cutting.
   Gale said his department wasn't exempt from the cost reductions.

<DATELINE>DETROIT (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A group of retired General Motors Corp. workers
have sued the automaker saying GM reneged on health-care coverage
promises.
   The group filed a class-action lawsuit Tuesday in federal court
in Los Angeles on behalf of more than 80,000 salaried retirees,
most of whom live in Michigan, Florida, California and Ohio.
   The suit said the company last year eliminated or reduced some
coverage for the retirees, including chiropractic and psychiatric
care, and imposed copayments and deductibles on basic health
coverage.
   The suit seeks restoration of benefits and compensation for
those who paid the deductibles and copayments.
   GM spokeswoman Patricia Malloy said the company had no comment
on the suit because it had not had time to study it.
   ``GM said we would have these benefits for our lifetimes,'' said
Leonard Moeller of Fenton, Mich. ``I felt we had a moral and legal
contract.
   ``They can't take it away now,'' said Moeller, an accountant who
retired in 1982.
   Malloy said all salaried GM workers should have known that their
health care benefits could change. She said last year's changes
were made to encourage active and retired employees to switch to
more economical health care plans, such as health maintenance
organizations.
   Currently, GM salaried workers have to pay the first $200 of
medical costs annually and 20 percent of other costs with a $500
ceiling. Thus, a worker could spend up to $700 a year for health
care. The family limit is $750 a year.
   ``We are all on fixed incomes and we are all at a state in our
lives when we truly need all of the health benefits that GM
promised us during our working years,'' Moeller said.
   Moeller said the suit was filed in Los Angeles because a retiree
group is active there and that GM may have too much influence if
the case was filed in Michigan.

<HEAD>Discount Drug Chain Files for Protection From Creditors</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ROCKVILLE, Md. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Dart Drug Stores Inc., faced with high
debt payments and costs of extensive store renovations, has filed
for protection from creditors under the federal Bankruptcy Code.
   Company chairman Sheldon Fantle said the board of directors
concluded the company could not continue to make payments on its
debt _ much of which was incurred by prior owners who bought the
chain from founder Herbert Haft in 1984 for $160 million.
   ``Our board determined that it was far better to take this step
now, while our company has substantial resources to implement a
plan of reorganization.''
   ``This makes a lot of sense,'' said Kenneth M. Gassman Jr., an
analyst with Wheat, First Securities Inc., of Richmond.
``Emotionally it was hard for them to make that decision, but over
the long term (the company) will emerge much stronger because it
allows them to renegotiate its long-term debt.''
   Fantle led a group of investors that took over management of the
company in November 1987. At that time, Dart owed more than $164
million to bondholders and to its bank lenders. It has paid more
than $26 million in principal and interest payments on that debt.
   Dart operates 69 retail drug stores in Washington, D.C.,
Maryland and Virginia, and five Total-Plus discount stores in the
Richmond area. Dart has more than 2,000 employees and had sales of
about $170 million in the fiscal year ended in 1989.
   Its loss in the third quarter ended April 29 narrowed to $7.3
million from $9.6 million last year. Revenue in the first nine
months fell 26 percent, to $128.8 million from $174.9 million a
year ago.
   Haft founded Dart Drug Stores in 1954. He sold the company to a
management group in 1984 before going on to make a series of
unsuccessful corporate takeover attempts under the mantle of his
Dart Group Corp., which is unrelated to the drugstore chain.
   Fantle attempted to revamp the company by remodeling stores,
placing new emphasis on customer service, a financial restructuring
and an unusual plan to donate 5 percent of the company's gross
receipts to charity.
   The company filed a petition in U.S. Bankruptcy Court in
Rockville, Md., placing Dart and its subsidiaries under the
protection of the Bankruptcy Court while the company prepares a
plan of reorganization.
   Under the provisions of Chapter 11, the current management will
continue operating Dart Drug Stores under the supervision of the
Bankruptcy Court. While the day-to-day operations will be up to
management, major actions such as borrowing money would be subject
to approval of the court.
   In several motions Tuesday to the bankruptcy court, Dart sought
to arrange up to $30 million in new financing from the Mellon Bank,
of Pittsburgh, Pa. Those funds would allow the business to pay its
existing secured creditors and provide a revolving line of credit
for working capital.
   The company also said employees will be paid this Friday.
   Dart also wants to obtain approval to continue making payments
to charities under its Good Neighbor Fund program.

<HEAD>United Finds Crack in Fourth 727-100</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TACOMA, Wash. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   United Airlines has found a small crack in
a fourth Boeing 727-100 jetliner since the Federal Aviation
Administration ordered an industry-wide inspection in July.
   The FAA reported Tuesday that to date, cracks have been found in
the metallic skins of four United 727s and one American Airlines
727. The cracks ranged in size from 20 inches to less than half an
inch.
   Chicago-based United, the nation's second-largest airline,
previously reported finding cracks in three planes.
   The FAA is considering whether to order continuing inspections
of the 31 oldest 727s registered in the United States, said agency
spokesman David Duff. The inspections might also be broadened to
include somewhat newer 727-100s as well, he said.
   The cracks, first discovered on United jets, occur on the seam
that joins the upper and lower parts of the fuselage. Boeing Co.
modified the way the seam was joined after building the first 46
727s, increasing the thickness of the splice by inserting a spacer
piece of metal between the overlapping fuselage sections.
   ``We had never seen cracking along the lower rivet row (at the
splice),'' Duff said. ``This was something new.''
   Though the cracks' safety implication is not fully understood,
the FAA issued an emergency directive ordering airlines to inspect
the aging 727s for the fuselage cracks, and not to fly the planes
until they were inspected and any cracks repaired.
   The United and American planes have been repaired and are back
in service.
   Each of the planes had accumulated 46,000 to 49,000 flights.
Boeing had billed the planes as having a design life cycle of 20
years and 60,000 flights, said Tom Cole, a Boeing spokesman.
   Boeing still believes the planes can fly indefinitely with
proper maintenance, Cole said.

<HEAD>Bidders Release Offer Document for BAT; Company Advises Rejection</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: UPDATES throughout with former U.S. Treasury Secretary Simon
reportedly involved in BAT bid.</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Hoylake Investments Ltd. has released details of
its cashless offer for BAT Industries PLC, but BAT again advised
shareholders not to accept the offer valued at some $21.6 billion.
   In a new twist in Hoylake's pursuit of the big British
conglomerate, former U.S. Treasury Secretary William E. Simon
emerged as an investor in the proposed deal and may be interested
in buying BAT's Farmers Group Inc. insurance division, according to
a report published today.
   Hoylake said it values its stock-and-debt offer for BAT at the
equivalent of $14.14 a share, but the stock closed at $13.65 a
share Tuesday on London's Stock Exchange, up 5 cents.
   The filing of an offer document is a normal step in British
takeover procedures. The offer must now stay open at least 21 days.
   Hoylake, consisting of Anglo-French financier Sir James
Goldsmith, British merchant banker Jacob Rothschild, Australian
investor Kerry Packer and other investors, said Tuesday the group
wouldn't specify how it might make the debt package behind their
takeover offer more marketable until after the bid's standing with
U.S. regulators is clear.
   For every 100 ordinary BAT shares, Hoylake would pay Hoylake
variable-interes senior secured notes valued at $684, subordinated
Hoylake notes valued at $418.20 and $274 worth of Hoylake
exchangeable loan stock convertible into 387 shares of Anglo Group
PLC, a Goldsmith company.
   Later, BAT issued a statement from the Louisville, Ky.,
headquarters of its U.S. subsidiary, BATUS Inc., reiterating its
rejection of the proposed buyout and advising stockholders not to
sell their shares.
   BAT, which is the world's biggest tobacco company, said its
international concentration on growth businesses had paid off with
a 38 percent compound return to shareholders since 1980 and there
was continued potential for rapid earnings growth.
   BAT Chairman Patrick Sheehy stated that the Hoylake offer
ignored those prospects and consisted of securities ``of dubious
value.''
   ``The scheme is principally designed to enrich Messrs.
Goldsmith, Rothschild and Packer at the expense of BAT Industries'
shareholders,'' Sheehy stated.
   Some of BAT's institutional investors have attacked the bid's
lack of cash and of any assurance that the debt offered in exchange
for BAT shares would be tradable.
   Goldsmith said the group couldn't speculate on how and when all
the details of the debt package would come to light but said
Bankers Trust International and Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc.
``wouldn't have lent their names to such an effort'' if the
securities couldn't be made liquid.
   The Wall Street Journal reported that the unexpected
intervention of Simon in the proposed acquisition of BAT _ which
would be Europe's biggest takeover _ could lend credibility to the
takeover attempt led by Goldsmith.
   Simon told the Journal that ``you have to consider Bill Simon an
interested player'' in any Goldsmith sale of Farmers, which BAT
acquired late last year for $5.2 billion.
   Goldsmith has indicated that if he prevails in his quest for BAT
he would retain the company's tobacco business and sell its retail,
paper and financial services divisions. Besides Farmers, BAT's U.S.
operations include the retail chains Saks Fifth Avenue and Marshall
Field.
   In an interview with the newspaper, Simon described his interest
in Farmers as preliminary and he said there weren't any firm plans
for a sale of Farmers by Hoylake.
   The bid for BAT is being reviewed by U.S. insurance regulators.
   The Hoylake investors intend to explore whether ``it makes a
difference'' to U.S. regulators whether it is Simon who ends up
acquiring Farmers, said Simon, who has become a pioneer of
leveraged buy-outs since leaving government service.
   BAT has been lobbying the British government to investigate the
proposed takeover, on the grounds that the highly leveraged
financing was against the public interest.

   Eastern Airline pilots in informal voting have
strongly favored sustaining their 5-month-old strike against the
troubled carrier, union officials say.
   About 200 Eastern pilots based in the New York area gathered
Tuesday at a Newark, N.J., airport hotel. Similar closed-door
meetings took place Tuesday evening in Eastern's home base of Miami
and in Alexandria, Va., near Washington, D.C.
   Air Line Pilots Association members meeting in Newark voted
203-15 in favor of continuing the strike, union officials said.
   ``We're going to keep going, rededicate our efforts and win the
strike,'' said Jeffrey Evans, an ALPA spokesman in New York.
   In Miami, pilots voted 285-15 to continue the strike, said ALPA
spokesman Hank Weber.
   ``The mood is now that we're going to start acting like a
union,'' said Weber, an Eastern captain. ``We're going to start
getting the other unions involved, the people who serve Continental
Airlines with the fuel, the maintenance and so forth, and we're
gonna start acting like a union, finally.''
   Continental and Eastern are both subsidiaries of Texas Air Corp.
   The Alexandria meeting continued into the early morning hours
today without a vote, ALPA said.
   Late Monday, Eastern pilots in Atlanta voted 493-121 not to
return to work.
   ALPA leaders will take the results of these and other straw
ballots scheduled for this week to Washington, where they will be
discussed by the group's 20-member master executive council. The
council will plan future strike action.
   ``Democracy will take its course,'' Jack Bavis, head of the
Eastern pilots union, said as he left the Newark meeting for
Washington.
   At a pilots meeting Sunday in Miami, Bavis had presented as his
personal view a proposal for calling off the strike, according to
an ALPA member who attended the gathering.
   ``He (Bavis) has no right to say that; it's not within his
authority to say that,'' said the pilot, who asked not to be
identified.
   ALPA spokesmen said much of the sentiment in the meetings was to
urge a national suspension of airline service on Labor Day weekend.
   John Mazor, a spokesman at ALPA's Washington headquarters, said
the union's national leadership has not taken a position yet on
whether it would support a national walkout.
   He said the possibility of a national walkout was among the
topics discussed in a meeting Tuesday between ALPA President Henry
Duffy and officials of the AFL-CIO, meeting in Chicago.
   AFL-CIO President Lane Kirkland said the federation's executive
council would meet with ALPA leaders about organized labor efforts
on behalf of striking Eastern workers.
   Asked whether he expected pilots at other airlines to heed the
call for a national job action, Bavis replied: ``I'm hopeful. I
think all the pilots in the country have a stake in what's going on
here.''
   Pilots and flight attendants at Eastern walked out in sympathy
with the Machinists union after it struck the carrier March 4. The
airline has been operating under Chapter 11 bankruptcy
reorganization since March 9.
   Eastern management has said that under its plan to reorganize as
a smaller carrier it will need only 1,700 pilots. ALPA has 3,600
members employed by Eastern.
   ``I don't think we'll have any comment on the pilots' votes,''
Eastern spokesman Robin Matell said from Miami.
   Also, Matell said, Eastern is no longer divulging how many ALPA
pilots have crossed picket lines. In the past, the company
announced rising numbers of crossovers, but Matell would not
explain the reason for the policy change.
   Eastern last week said pilot crossovers since the strike began
numbered 385, up from 200 at the outset. In addition, 300 newly
hired pilots had completed training and 700 more were in training,
the company said.

   Corn futures were lower, but soybeans and wheat
prices moved marginally higher today on the Chicago Board of Trade.
   The dip in corn prices was attributed to the unusually high
estimate of crop production released Tuesday by influential private
forecaster Conrad Leslie.
   Although Leslie's forecast for soybeans was bearish as well,
most traders apparently thought a late wave of selling at Tuesday's
close was overdone and few sellers materialized after the opening
bell today.
   Price swings may be at a minimum over the next two days in all
the grain pits as traders adjust their positions in anticipation of
Thursday's U.S. Department of Agriculture report on actual crop
production.
   At the open, wheat was unchanged to 1\ cents higher, with the
contract for delivery in September at $3.92} cents a bushel; corn
was \ cent to 1\ cents lower, with September at $2.24 a bushel;
oats were 1{ cents to 3 cents higher, with September at $1.39 a

   Livestock and pork futures were mostly lower at the Chicago
Mercantile Exchange.
   Live cattle were .27 cent lower to .07 cent higher, with August
at 74.37 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .17 cent lower to .08

   The Justice Department is asking several
prestigious universities for documents as part of an antitrust
investigation into how they set tuition and student aid rates,
officials say.
   The department, while declining to discuss the thrust of the
investigation, acknowledged that it is seeking certain documents.
   Daniel Steiner, general counsel at Harvard University, said the
request was for documents dealing with ``student financial aid,
budgeting and other fees and salaries.''
   Jonathan Kleinbard, vice president for news and community
affairs at the University of Chicago said today that his
institution was cooperating with a Justice Department request ``for
information concerning the procedures by which it establishes its
tuition.''
   ``Specifically, the ... department is interested in whether
institutions of higher education have entered into arrangements or
understandings as to prospective tuition rates that may violate
federal antitrust laws,'' he said.
   ``At no time has the University of Chicago participated in any
agreement or understanding with any other institution as to the
setting of its tuition,'' Kleinbard said. When asked about possible
agreements relating to financial aid, he said, ``We don't do it _
pure and simple.''
   Justice Department spokesman David Runkel confirmed that
document requests ``have gone out to a number of colleges,'' but he
declined to disclose the subjects of the request.
   ``Antitrust division investigations are not a matter of public
record,'' he said.
   ``You can say this is in a preliminary stage,'' Runkel said,
adding that the first requests were made ``sometime earlier this
summer, perhaps six weeks ago.''
   ``Essentially, they've asked us to produce a lot of documents
with regard to our budget, how we budget,'' Richard Mersereau, a
spokesman for Brunswick, Maine's Bowdoin College, told The
Associated Press. ``It's an extensive amount of documentation, and
we are complying.''
   Universities have shared financial information about students
for years, even arranging to use copies of a single financial
statement submitted by parents of applicants seeking scholarships
and other aid.
   There have been reports that major universities agree among
themselves on the aid packages to be offered, generally mixtures of
scholarships, loans and campus jobs. Such agreements, if they
exist, would be of interest to the antitrust division, which
enforces the legal ban against price-fixing by private commercial
companies.
   There are well-known aid agreements among universities, such as
limits on athletic scholarships that members of the National
Collegiate Athletic Association may offer. Members of the Ivy
League have agreed not to offer athletic scholarships and to base
offers of financial aid on student need.
   Harvard's Steiner declined to say whether cooperating
universities agree on aid packages to be offered to applicants.
   The Washington Post said in today's editions the department's
requests had gone to 20 institutions, among them Harvard, Colby,
Amherst, Williams and Bowdoin colleges, Tufts and Wesleyan
universities and the University of Chicago.
   Harvard ``will be cooperating with the Justice Department in
giving them the data they've requested,'' Steiner said.
   At neighboring Tufts University in Medford, Mass., spokeswoman
Rosemarie Van Camp said, ``We will cooperate fully with the Justice
Department.''
   Colby spokesman Edward Hershey also confirmed that the school
had been served and had turned the matter over to counsel.
   ``They have asked for certain documents and we will, I'm sure,
attempt to respond appropriately,'' he said.

<HEAD>Cummins Amends Shareholder Rights Plan</HEAD>
<DATELINE>COLUMBUS, Ind. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Cummins Engine Co. Inc. Wednesday said it
amended provisions of its shareholders' rights plan to lower the
amount of common stock a shareholder must own to be eligibile.
   The amendment lowers from 25 percent to 15 percent the ownership
of the company's common stock that results in the rights kicking
in, said Ann C. Smith, public relations director of Cummins, which
produces diesel engines, components and power systems.
   Ms. Smith said the amendment would have no immediate effect,
since no one shareholder has acquired 15 percent of the company's
common stock.
   Last December, the U.S. arm of the British conglomerate Hanson
PLC announced it had acquired 8.32 percent of Cummins' common
stock, then filed for permission to increase its holdings up to 15
percent.
   Last month, Cummins' 80-year-old former chairman, J. Irwin
Miller, and other family members bought back the shares to allay
fears the engine-maker might be bought and moved.
   Nine days later, Industrial Equity (Pacific) Ltd., a Hong
Kong-based investment concern, paid $60.2 million for 1.01 million
shares, or 9.9 percent of common stock. IEP filed for permission
from the Securities and Exchange Commission to increase its stake
to between 15 percent and 25 percent.
   IEP officials have said the purchase was made for investment and
takeover purposes.
   ``All of these factors were considered by the board when it
inacted the amendment,'' Ms. Smith said today.
   The company adopted its shareholder rights plan three years ago
and declared a dividend of one right per outstanding share of
common stock. When the rights become effective, they entitle the
holder to buy one share of common stock for $200. Under certain
circumstances, the rights entitle the stockholder to purchase for
$200 common stock with a market value of two times the purchase
price.

Later, in London, it rose to 139.13 yen.
   In London, the dollar rose against the British pound. It cost
$1.6170 to buy one pound, cheaper for buyers than $1.6250 late
Tuesday.
   Other dollar rates late Wednesday in Europe compared with late

   President Bush today signed far-reaching
legislation to rescue the nation's ailing savings and loan
industry, calling the measure ``a first step, a crucial step,
toward restoring public confidence.''
   ``I'm proud to sign this monster,'' Bush said at a Rose Garden
ceremony attended by architects of the nearly foot-high bill, which
authorizes $50 billion in new government borrowing over the next 26
months.
   The bill also imposes tough new standards on savings and loan
institutions and triggers the most sweeping overhaul of the
regulatory bureaucracy in 50 years.
   Along with the late-morning signing of the measure, the
president was ordering his administration to gear up to close or
merge hundreds of failed institutions. The first meeting of a new
board to oversee their holdings was called immediately after the
ceremony.
   Bush said the measure, which received final congressional
approval Saturday, ``says to tens of millions of savings and loan
depositors: you will not be the victims of others' mistakes.''
   Among the 300 or so people at the signing ceremony were Treasury
Secretary Nicholas Brady, Housing and Urban Development Secretary
Jack Kemp and key Capitol Hill sponsors, including Sen. Donald W.
Riegle Jr., D-Mich., and Rep. Henry B. Gonzalez, D-Texas, chairmen
of the congressional banking committees.
   To the president's right were mock-ups of the new emblems that
the institutions will put on their doors to assure depositors their
money is safe.
   One proclaims in bold, white letters against a gold background:
``Deposits Federally Insured _ Backed Up by the Full Faith and
Credit of the United States Government.''
   ``This legislation comes to grips with the problems facing our
savings and loan industry. It will safeguard and stabilize
America's financial system,'' Bush declared.
   He called the measure, a variation on a bailout plan he
submitted to Congress on Feb. 6, ``historic legislation.''
   ``It is responsive and responsible. And for that, I salute the
Congress,'' the president said.
   Immediately after the signing ceremony, Brady was conducting the
first meeting of the board overseeing the Resolution Trust Corp.
The RTC was created to manage the sale of sour loans and
repossessed real estate the government is inheriting from ailing
savings and loans.
   The RTC board, whose members also include Kemp and Federal
Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan, will approve operating policies
for the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp., the agency charged with
managing the bailout. It also will appoint top staff members to
oversee the FDIC.
   The FDIC already has taken over 262 failed thrifts, and the
first deals to wipe out their losses and put them in the hands of
new owners could come as early as this week.
   Earlier, the Treasury Department announced plans to borrow the
first $5 billion installment of the bailout Thursday and said it
intends to raise an additional $15 billion within eight weeks.
   Analysts say the bill, the first major legislative initiative of
Bush's presidency, will touch the lives of anyone who pays taxes,
deposits money in a bank or thrift or owns real estate,
particularly in the Southwest.
   The savings and loan industry will emerge leaner and more
closely regulated, bu perhaps no better able to earn a profit,
analysts say.
   By providing the money to close failed thrifts, which must pay
high interest rates to attract deposits, the bill should allow
remaining institutions, including banks, to lower their rates.
   The massive sale of real estate by the government could endanger
property values in already fragile markets in oil-producing states
in such as Texas and Oklahoma.
   Thrifts that can't measure up to tougher financial and
accounting standards face takeover by government regulators or
merger with bigger and stronger institutions _ including commercial
banks, which for the first time will be permitted to buy healthy
savings and loans.
   ``In five years I expect there'll be less than a thousand
thrifts,'' said Bert Ely, a financial institutions analyst in
Alexandria, Va. Currently there are about 3,000 savings and loan
institutions.
   The prospects for thrifts that remain are mixed. Optimists point
out that the bill, by lowering deposit rates, will make it easier
for healthy institutions to earn a profit.
   Also, it should restore public confidence in the government's
guarantee of savers' accounts up to $100,000, helping stem a record
outflow of deposits this year.
   ``The industry that is going to emerge from this is going to be
fewer in number, but certainly stronger,'' said Barney R. Beeksma,
chairman of the U.S. League of Savings Institutions, the industry's
largest trade group.
   Pessimists, however, say the industry's contribution to the
bailout will pinch thrift earnings. They also note that the bill
will force savings and loans to concentrate more heavily on safer,
but less lucrative, home mortgage lending just as the economy and
real estate markets are entering a slow-growth period at best and a
recession at worst.
   ``I think it's exactly the wrong thing to do,'' said economist
Paul Getman of the WEFA Group, a Bala Cynwyd, Pa., forecasting
company. ``It's consigning the thrift industry to low
profitability, at least over the next two or three years.''

   Share prices finished higher on London's Stock
Exchange Wednesday, as an early surge on Wall Street pulled stocks
upward.
   By the close of London trading, the Wall Street rally and ended
and the Dow Jones average was off 0.95 point, having gone as much
as 15 points better earlier in the session.
   But dealers in London said any share price dips were seen as
buying opportunities, as fund managers were reluctant to sell for
fear of missing out on a move higher.
   At the close, the Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index
was up 12.3 points, or 0.5 percent, at 2,360.4.
   The Financial Times 30-share index was up 9.7 points at 1,970.7
at the close. The Financial Times 500-share index rose 6.43 points
to close at 1,329.92.
   Volume amounted to an 520.9 million shares, compared 543.3

<TEXT>
   The savings and loan industry will emerge
leaner and more closely regulated, but perhaps no better able to
earn a profit, as a result of legislation signed by President Bush
on Wednesday, analysts say.
   The bill, enacted six months after Bush first called for
emergency action to solve a crisis inherited from the Reagan
administration, is expected to profoundly alter and probably
drastically shrink a business that has enjoyed a privileged
position in the nation's financial system for more than 50 years.
   Savings and loans, because they financed the American dream of
home ownership, have been permitted to operate under accounting
standards and capital requirements much more lax than those applied
to commercial banks.
   No longer. In 120 days, thrift owners will be required to back
every $100 in lending with $1.50 in tangible capital, which will
act as a cushion between future losses and government insurance
funds. By 1995, the standard will reach $3.
   An estimated 77 percent of the nation's 2,946 S&amp;Ls meet the 1.5
percent standard and two-thirds already satisfy the 3 percent
requirement that is more than five years away, according to
Sheshunoff &amp; Co., a consulting firm in Austin, Texas.
   Those that can't measure up face takeover by government
regulators or merger with bigger and stronger institutions. Because
the legislation for the first time permits banks to buy solvent
S&amp;Ls, even prosperous institutions could be quickly scooped up by
large holding companies anxious to expand their retail branch
network. The bill makes it easier for banks to smoothly integrate
thrifts into their operation.
   ``In five years I expect there'll be less than a thousand
thrifts,'' said Bert Ely, a financial institutions analyst in
Alexandria, Va. ``Five hundred to 1,000 thrifts will be shut down
by the government, the rest will go because banks will seek to
acquire them and they will seek to be acquired. It will be a
two-way street.''
   The prospects for thrifts that remain after the shakeout are
mixed. Optimists point out that the bill, by eliminating ailing
S&amp;Ls that bid up interest rates on deposits, will make it easier
for healthy institutions to raise low-cost funds.
   Also, by putting the taxpayers' money where politicians' mouths
are, the bill should restore public confidence in the government's
guarantee of savers' accounts up to $100,000, helping to stem a
record outflow of deposits this year.
   ``The industry that is going to emerge from this is going to be
fewer in number, but certainly stronger,'' said Barney R. Beeksma,
chairman of the U.S. League of Savings Institutions, the industry's
largest trade group.
   ``I think the positives clearly outweigh the negatives. It will
probably reduce, if not eliminate, the adverse publicity we've had
... by once again underscoring that government insurance of
accounts is just that and people don't have to worry about losing
their money,'' said Beeksma, president of Interwest Savings Bank in
Oak Harbor, Wash.
   Pessimists, however, say that the industry's share of the
bailout will pinch thrift earnings in two ways: through higher
deposit insurance premiums and by skimming profits from the 12
regional, industry-owned Federal Home Loan Banks.
   S&amp;L losses far exceeded profits in 1987 and 1988 but embership
in the regional banks, the industry's financing arm, provided
thrifts that did make money with a third of their earnings last
year.
   The regional banks, as part of the bailout, are contributing all
of their retained earnings, $3.5 billion, as well as $300 million a
year in profits.
   Moreover, institutions will see their deposit insurance premium
rise by 10 percent, from 20.8 cents per $100 to 23 cents.
   Pessimists also note that the bill will force S&amp;Ls to
concentrate more heavily on safer but less lucrative home mortgage
lending just as the economy and real estate markets are entering
into a slow-growth period at best and a recession at worst.
   Thrifts are now required to devote 70 percent of their assets to
housing loans, up from a 60 percent standard that had many more
loopholes.
   ``I think it's exactly the wrong thing to do,'' said economist
Paul Getman of the WEFA Group, a Bala Cynwyd, Pa., forecasting
firm. ``It's consigning the thrift industry to low profitability,
at least over the next two or three years.
   Also, Getman warned that, perversely, government action to
resolve the thrift crisis could have the effect of further
unnerving depositors.
   ``Eventually the bailout is going to increase confidence in the
industry, but that's a ways off. People are going to see
institutions closing left and right. It's going to be hard to
explain to them that we're making a better industry when they see
their local thrift going under,'' he said.

<HEAD>Tips For Traveling With Credit Cards, Travelers Checks</HEAD>
<HEAD>With BC-Credit Fraud</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Here are a few financial safety tips for travelers, according to
industry experts and consumer groups:
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   _Keep most of your money in travelers checks. They're safer than
cash because the issuer gives full or partial refunds for lost or
stolen checks. Checks in foreign currency may be available at a
major bank at official exchange rates, usually without service fees.
   _Carry U.S. dollars and the currency of whatever country you're
visiting. U.S. money should be in small denominations to handle
minor expenses, such as tips or parking, before or after departure.
   _Bring at least one major credit card for either identification
or purchases. Two is better, since not all cards are universally
accepted, but leave the cards you don't expect to use at home.
   _Try to buy all your travel tickets through a credit card, if
possible. It's often easier to get replacement tickets and many
credit-card companies provide limited travel insurance.
   _After charging meals, souvenirs or other items destroy all
charge card carbons immediately.
   _Double check your credit card bill to ensure all purchases are
listed correctly, and contact your bank or credit-card company
immediately if there's an incorrect expense. Cardholders are liable
for up to $50 of unauthorized purchases before they report a card
stolen or lost but they're not liable for any purchases after a
report is filed.

<HEAD>Target Of Largest French Takeover Bid Promises Fight</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Compagnie Industrielle will resist the largest
takeover bid ever attempted in France, a $2.5 billion offer from a
former ally, its president said Wednesday.
   Jean-Marc Vernes, head of the holding company under attack from
Compagnie Financiere de Suez, a Paris-based bank holding company,
declined to discuss what allies he might be lining up for the fight.
   Suez won a long and difficult takeover battle last year with
Italian financier Carlo de Benedetti for control of the huge
Belgian holding company Societe Generale de Belgique.
   The prize in the takeover battle is Groupe Victoire, France's
second-biggest insurance group. Suez, which traces its corporate
history to the financing of the Suez Canal more than a century ago,
currently shares control of Groupe Victoire with Compagnie
Industrielle.
   The Paris Stock Exchange said in a statement that Suez proposes
to offer the equivalent of $2,030 per share for the 81.5 percent of
Compagnie Industrielle stock it does not already own. That would
value the target company's equity at $3 billion and the Suez offer
would total about $2.5 billion.
   Vernes was quoted by the French news agency Agence France-Presse
as saying he would make no statement until the hostile takeover bid
by Suez has been approved by stock market regulatory authorities.
   The regulatory decision is expected on Aug. 18, and if the bid
is approved, stockholders then would have a month to decide whether
to sell at that price.
   Trading in Compagnie Industrielle stock has been frozen since
Friday. It was last quoted on the Paris Bourse at the equivalent of
$1,525 per share.
   The price of Suez shares fell to $55.55 a share from $57.66 on
Wednesday in active trading.
   Groupe Victoire was originally part of the Suez holdings, but
when it appeared likely that the Socialists would win the 1981
elections, Suez's president at the time, Jack Frances, quietly
transferred control to the holding company Compagnie Industrielle,
which he controlled along with allies including the Dassault family.
   When the new Socialist government indeed nationalized Suez along
with other banks and industrial firms, it was surprised to find the
Groupe Victoire insurance company no longer a Suez subsidiary,
although Suez did retain a minority interest _ partly direct and
partly through Compagnie Industrielle.
   The conservative government elected in 1986 sold Suez to private
investors, but its new owners have had uneasy relations with
Vernes, who succeeded Frances as head of Compagnie Industrielle.
   Suez said if its takeover bid is successful, it will then make a
tender offer for the Victoire insurance company's parent, Compagnie
Financiere du Groupe Victoire.
   Suez already owns 30 percent of Groupe Victoire, but apparently
is unhappy as simply a silent investor. Suez also owns 18.47
percent of the shares of Compagnie Industrielle, which has 40
percent of the capital and 48 percent of the voting rights of
Compagnie Financiere du Groupe Victoire.
   Groupe Victoire became much more attractive after making a
friendly acquisition last month of West Germany's second-largest
insurer, Colonia Versicherung AG. Suez said its bid would not
affect the Colonia takeover.
   Suez said in a statement that its bid for Victoire was part of
its preparation for the dropping of barriers within the European
Economic Community after 1992.
   Reports in several French newspapers Wednesday said Vernes would
likely line up support from the Ferruzzi group of Italy to help
fight off the Suez takeover bid. Vernes is also president of
Beghin-Say, a French paper-making unit of Ferruzzi.
   Vernes declined to comment on the reports that Ferruzzi would be
involved.
   Under French stock market regulations, any competing bid for
Compagnie Industrielle, either by Vernes allies or others, would
have to be at least 5 percent higher than the Suez tender offer.
   The main asset of Compagnie Industrielle is its controlling
stake in Groupe Victoire. It also has some real estate and minority
industrial holdings.

   Stock prices were mixed today, running into some
resistance at or near record highs.
   But airline stocks continued their recent runaway rise.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials rose 5.31 to 2,704.48 by
2 p.m. on Wall Street, nearing the record closing high of 2,722.42
set on Aug. 25, 1987.
   Losers outnumbered gainers by about 8 to 7 in nationwide trading
of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 648 up, 743 down and
551 unchanged.
   The boom in airline stocks sent the Dow Jones average of 20
transportation stocks surging ahead 46.58 points, or 3.44 percent,
to 1,402.38.
   UAL jumped 20 to 239\ on reports that investor Marvin Davis was

company.
   Intense takeover speculation continued in other airline issues.
AMR gained 3{ to 77]; Delta Air Lines 2~ to 79|, and Pan Am [ to 4].
   Otherwise, brokers said the Dow's rise to the 2,700 level
prompted a tug-of-war between buyers and traders intent on cashing
in some of the market's recent gains.
   Most other, broader measures of stock price trends have already

   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks rose

<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MADRID, Spain (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Americans know Pedro Guerrero as a $2
million-a-year slugger who can wallop a baseball, but in Spain's
financial world the name refers to someone known for a different
kind of big bang.
   That Pedro Guerrero is a lawyer, securities professional and son
of a Spanish banker. Last month he was elected chairman of the
Madrid Stock Exchange at age 36, making him the youngest person to
head a major securities market.
   More importantly, Guerrero has been presiding over a profound
reform in Spain's securities industry that's shattered the
160-year-old shackles of government control, a revolution known as
``El Big Bang.''
   It officially began July 29, when the state monopoly on
securities trading ended. Stock exchanges became private
businesses. Government-appointed stockbrokers were replaced by
private brokerages. After a transition period, once-fixed
commissions will be freely negotiatable.
   Like the ``Big Bang'' deregulation of the British markets a few
years ago, the Spanish securities overhaul is aimed at making stock
trading more competitive, efficient and attractive to foreigners
seeking opportunities in one of Europe's fastest-growing economies.
   ``The changeover has gone very well, although we've still got a
long road to run,'' Guerrero said in an interview. ``Many people,
especially in the business press, did not believe we would be ready
by the July 29 deadline, but we were.''
   He's not related to the Dominican-born Pedro Guerrero who bats
cleanup for the St. Louis Cardinals in the United States. But their
aggressiveness is strikingly similar.
   Guerrero's management of the El Big Bang changeover at Madrid's
stock exchange, where 70 percent of Spanish stocks are traded, has
overshadowed his conspicuous youth in a profession historically
dominated by rigid thinking and slow-moving brokers accustomed to
the life of government bureaucrats.
   ``He talks about selling products and services,'' said Jose
Manuel Nunez-Lagos, 67, a 38-year career stockbroker and president
of the Hispano brokerage. ``This is precisely the difference
between the old exchange and the new one.''
   Guerrero smokes heavily and wears modest clothes that belie his
wealth. He made a fortune channeling investment funds from foreign
markets into Spain through the Asesores Bursatiles brokerage, which
he helped found. In 1988, Asesores accounted for more than 5
percent of total volume on the Madrid exchange, 80 percent of that
from foreign investors.
   His youth stands in marked contrast to other world stock
exchange leaders. New York Stock Exchange Chairman John Phelan is
58, for example. American Stock Exchange Chairman Arthur Levitt is
58. Toronto Stock Exchange chairman Charles Caty is 48. Tokyo Stock
Exchange chairman Minoru Nagaoka is 65.
   Guerrero attributed his election by the revamped stock
exchange's 51 members partly to what he called an across-the-board
generational change in Spanish society.
   He mentioned Luis Carlos Croissier, 38, named president of the
National Securities Commission, the government agency that will
police the markets under the reform. Prime Minister Felipe Gonzalez
is only 47, Guerrero noted.
   ``In other places where there has been a long, stable history
and much tradition, my election might not have been possible,''
Guerrero said. ``But I'm a firm believer in putting younger people
in important posts.''
   Guerrero said his priorities include revising the cumbersome
time-consuming system for finalizing stock trades and developing
the nation's first stock-options market. Options, widely traded by
speculators in the United States, are rights to buy or sell stocks
within a set time for a set price.
   He also intends to expand computerized trading, introduced in
April using a model of the Toronto Stock Exchange's Computer
Automated Trading System. The Spanish CATS network links the Madrid
exchange to smaller exchanges in Barcelona, Bilbao and Valencia.
   Guerrero said 22 percent of all trading is now done via CATS and
the figure should double by the end of the year, as the historical
open-outcry system of traders shouting bids gradually is phased out.
   His fast rise in Spain's securities industry reflects Guerrero's
own intense drive and ambition. He placed first seven years ago in
the tough state exams for his stockbroker's diploma. But he was
never completely satisfied just peddling stocks and looked for
other opportunities.
   In 1984, he and two friends visited financial institutions in
London to discuss their preparations for Britain's market
deregulation. That's where he got the idea for what became an
immensely successful business in Spain.
   ``They all wanted to hear about Spanish investment
possibilities,'' Guerrero said. ``They said if there was a firm in
Spain that could provide top-quality research and services, it
would get all the clients it could handle and more.''
   Guerrero and friends returned to Madrid and formed Asesores
Bursatiles. In 1985, the firm channeled about $350 million in
foreign investments into the Spanish markets. Last year they
handled $3.8 billion, mainly in foreign money, and have since
diversified the firm into other corporate financial services.
   Asked if he was concerned that Spain's market deregulation would
incite rampant greed and fraud, Guerrero said he believed the
government could still police the securities industry.
   ``I'm completely confident that the new National Securities
Commission is going to strongly discourage this and be very tough
on rule-breakers,'' he said.
   As an example, he mentioned the commission's recent probe of
Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc.'s Spanish subsidiary. Even before any
formal action was taken, Drexel shut down the operation July 17
after determining it had improperly sold securities in a Spanish
oil company.

   U.S. authorities will have to borrow tens of
billions of dollars from other countries to help bail out failed
savings and loans institutions, dollars foreigners will someday use
to compete for scarcer goods in this country, an economist
predicted Wednesday.
   The bill President Bush signed Wednesday authorizes borrowing
$50 billion over the next 26 months. The total cost of the bailout
will be far higher because of interest costs.
   Foreigners already buy future claims on this country at a rate
of $10 billion a month through their purchases of American bonds,
shares, real estate and other property.
   Americans do not save enough of their own money to pay for the
things they want from foreigners now, so the needed money has to be
lent to this country from abroad.
   ``Unfortunately, people in government focus on short-term
problems and not on the long term,'' said Matthew B. Canzoneri,
professor of economics at Georgetown University.
   ``I'm a baby-boomer. In the long run, there'll be fewer people
in this country to produce goods to support me in my old age. The
same is true of Mr. Yamaguchi in Japan _ and the Japanese
population is getting older faster than ours is.''
   Canzoneri sees Japanese and other foreigners wanting to cash in
their loans and investments and use the dollars to buy up American
goods at a time when fewer American goods will be produced in
proportion to the U.S. population. All that money chasing fewer
goods will run up prices, lower living standards and bring
pressures to cut pensions in this country, he predicted.
   Canzoneri also predicts additional government borrowing will
cause short-term problems.
   ``Lenders in Wall Street may get jittery,'' he said. ``That
would drive up interest rates. That will increase the cost of the
federal government's deficit. Then there would be pressure on the
Federal Reserve System to push interest rates down. That would mean
even more borrowing and the threat of inflation.''

<BYLINE>Col. Sanders Meets Fourier's Law As Student Researches Chicken
Formula</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LOUISVILLE, Ky. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Michael Norris is in search of the
perfectly cooked chicken, but his tools are more likely to include
a slide rule than a spatula.
   Norris, a 26-year-old graduate chemical engineering student at
the University of Louisville, is trying to create a mathematical
model for showing how quickly chicken pieces will cook under
varying conditions.
   Financed by a $15,000 grant from Kentucky Fried Chicken, Norris
is attempting to develop the model for his masters thesis at the
Equipment Performance Lab of the company's Col. Sanders Technical
Center.
   ``Basically all cooking is a physical phenomenon,'' said Dr.
Mohan Rao, a senior research scientist for Kentucky Fried Chicken,
the nation's biggest fried chicken chain. With Norris' model, ``we
should be able to tell exactly what the process should be,'' he
said.
   Whenever the company changes its brand of shortening or uses a
new type of pressure cooker, it has to alter the cooking procedure.
The company would use the formula being developed by Norris to
replace trial and error testing methods.
   ``Minor improvements in productivity translate into a
significant amount of money,'' says Richard M. Detwiler, a
spokesman at Kentucky Fried Chicken, which sells nearly $6 billion
worth of chicken and other foods annually.
   Using an overhead projector, Norris creates graph outlines of
drumsticks measured in two positions to arrive at an average
dimension. Then, with what Norris says is best explained as
Fourier's Law, he uses the measurements to work out an equation
that will predict how quickly various parts of the chicken will
cook.
   Fourier's Law states that with two masses, ``the greater the
temperature difference, the faster the heat transfers,'' Rao said.
   The 40-year-old Rao spent 15 years as a professor of food
processing at the University of Georgia in Athens. Last month, he
was named an adjunct professor at the university, where he will
teach a class on food processing next spring.
   Norris said he had no ``particular interest in working with
chicken'' before he was selected for the project. However, standing
in a room surrounded by trays of fried chicken, Norris said he
might consider a career in food-process control.

   The Chicago Board of Trade will do whatever it
takes to restore confidence after 46 traders were indicted as a
result of a sweeping federal probe of trading fraud, the exchange
chairman pledged Wednesday.
   ``We do not tolerate a single customer being abused on our
exchange,'' board Chairman Karsten Mahlmann told the annual meeting
of the U.S. Feed Grains Council, which ended its three-day session
Wednesday.
   ``We want your confidence. We will do anything and everything to
keep it.''
   Mahlmann told council members the board has increased its audit
and investigation staff by 30 percent, and on Thursday will
consider a proposal to increase the penalty for each rule violation
to $250,000 from $75,000.
   ``That's how bad they want a clean house,'' he said of the
tougher policies, which followed last week's indictment of dozens
of traders at the Board of Trade and the Chicago Mercantile
Exchange.
   Mahlmann also defended the Board of Trade decision to order the
sale of some July soybean contracts as ``a last resort'' to keep
the market operating smoothly.
   But farmer Jack Kintzle of Coggon, Iowa, said there still are
too many unanswered questions about the soybean sale, which
primarily affected an Italian processor, Ferruzzi Finanziaria SpA.
   ``I think the the Ferruzzi deal is bothering the farmers in
gravel-road America even more than the indictments,'' Kintzle said.
   ``If they had left the market run, we'd have had $8 or $9 beans.
Farmers might not have sold but at least they would have had the
opportunity.''
   The Board of Trade move was widely interpreted as an effort to
break up an attempt to corner the market. Ferruzzi denied that was
its aim, saying it needed the beans for its crushing operation and
customers.
   The action forced Ferruzzi to give up nearly all of its July
contracts for the delivery of 23 million bushels of soybeans.
   The Commodity Futures Trading Commission already had taken steps
to cancel an exemption that allowed Ferruzzi to hold contracts for
more than the 3 million-bushel limit. The federal agency has said
there were contracts for delivery of about 40 million bushels of
soybeans and only about 12 million bushels available.
   Mahlmann said the Board of Trade preferred to apply its
liquidation order ``across the marketplace,'' to everyone with more
than 3 million bushels, whether they were buyers or sellers.
   The order required people to liquidate 20 percent of their
contracts each day, and to have contracts for no more than 1
million bushels of beans on July 20, he said.
   The CFTC plan would have forced Ferruzzi to liquidate contracts
for 20 million bushels in one day, Mahlmann said.
   ``That would have had long-lasting, devastating consequences on
the soybean complex,'' he said. ``I wouldn't have wanted to
speculate on where prices would have gone.''
   But farmer Steve Wentworth of Oreana, president of the National
Corn Growers Association, was uneasy about the move.
   ``I have some concerns that it affected the credibility of the
Board of Trade, and some farmers still have problems with that,''
he said.
   The U.S. Feed Grains Council, a private organization of farm and
agribusiness groups, was formed in 1960 to promote export markets
for U.S. corn, barley and sorghum.

<HEAD>Price of Citrus Land Heating Up in Recovery from Freezes</HEAD>
<DATELINE>GAINESVILLE, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The value of Florida citrus land is
rising, reflecting a general improvement in the agricultural
economy and a comeback from winter freezes, according to a new
survey.
   The value of mature South Florida orange groves was up 8.2
percent to $11,873 an acre, and Central Florida orange acreage rose
5.4 percent to $11,800 an acre in the survey period from November
1988 to May 1989.
   The survey, released this week by the University of Florida's
Institute of Food and Agricultural Sciences, demonstrated the
confidence and optimism in the heart of the Florida citrus belt,
hard-hit by severe freezes in December 1983 and January 1985 that
killed nearly 200,000 acres of trees.
   ``We've seen prices bottom out and they're on the way back up,''
said John Jackson, citrus specialist with the Lake County
Agricultural Extension Service.
   Relatively mild weather has prevailed during the past four
winters and citrus planting has been active. About 125,000 acres
were planted statewide in 1986 and 1987, industry figures show.
   The value of an acre of mature grapefruit groves in central
Florida was placed at $10,265 an acre, a 5.5 percent jump from
November 1988. In South Florida, grapefruit groves were valued at
$10,420 an acre, a 2.7 percent increase.
   Part of the value of the farmland reflects its potential for
commercial development, said the authors of the report, University
of Florida agriculture professors John Gordon and John Reynolds and
visiting professor J.H. Atkinson.
   They said caution must be used in making year-to-year
comparisons from prior surveys.

<TEXT>
   Corn futures were lower but soybeans and wheat
prices mostly higher Wednesday on the Chicago Board of Trade.
   Corn was under pressure at the opening bell because of the
unusually high crop production estimate released after the close of
business Tuesday by influential private forecaster Conrad Leslie.
   Although Leslie's forecast for soybeans was bearish as well,
most traders apparently felt that was discounted during the late
wave of selling at Tuesday's close.
   Wheat got its support from a small but steady stream of export
business, including rumors of a possible buy _ perhaps as much as
600,000 tons _ by Taiwan. Also supporting prices in the pit was the
hot, dry weather in growing areas of the United States, Europe and
the Soviet Union.
   Trading remained in a narrow range and is expected to do so
again Thursday as traders square their positions in anticipation of
the U.S. Department of Agriculture report on actual crop production.
   On the close, wheat was { cent to 3\ cents higher, with the
contract for delivery in September at $3.94} a bushel; corn was 1\
cents to 2 cents lower, with September at $2.22} a bushel; oats

   The EEC economy grew by 1.2 percent
during the first quarter of 1989, Eurostat, the statistics agency
of the 12-nation European Economic Copmmunity reported Wednesday.
   It said this was the highest quarterly rate since the third
quarter of 1987.
   By comparison, Eurostat said, the economies of the United States
and Japan _ the EEC's main trading partners _ rose by 1.1 and 2.2
percent respectively during the first quarter.
   Eurostat said the first three months of 1989 saw a 4.4 percent
jump in investments, the highest in four years and well above the 1
percent growth rate of the last quarter of 1988.
   EEC exports grew by 3.7 percent, up from 1.6 percent during the
previous quarter. Imports rose by 1.3 percent, down from 3.2
percent during the last three months of 1988.
   Eurostat said first-quarter growth in private consumption slowed
to 0.5 percent from 0.6 percent during 1988's fourth quarter.
   At 2.9 percent, West Germany posted the strongest economic
growth during the first quarter. It was followed by France (1.1
percent) and Italy, (0.7 percent), Eurostat said.
   The British economy was the weakest with a drop in output of 0.4
percent, Eurostat said.

   Woolworth Corp. Wednesday reported an 11.6
percent gain in second-quarter income, boosted by an 18 percent
rise in sales at its specialty stores.
   The newly formed holding company of the big retailer F.W.
Woolworth Co. said sales at its general merchandise stores grew a

   Besides the Woolworth chain of general merchandise stores, F.W.
Woolworth owns strings of specialty retailers in the United States
and abroad. Its holdings include Foot Locker and Lady Foot Locker
athletic shoe shops as well as clothing and drug stores.
   For the first half of Woolworth's financial year, earnings came
to $84 million, or $1.30 a share, up about 7.7 percent from $78
million, or $1.22 a share, in 1988's first six months. Revenue
totaled $3.86 blilion, an 8 percent gain from $3.57 billion.

<TEXT>
   Coca-Cola Co. said Wednesday it has completed the
acquisition of a bottling and distribution subsidiary of France's
Pernod-Ricard group, putting an end to a dispute that has soured
relations between the two beverage companies for almost two years.
   Coca-Cola said it has agreed to pay the equivalent of about $140
million for Societe Parisienne de Boissons Gazeuses (SPBG) and its
subsidiaries, which have bottled and distributed soft drinks in
France under license from Coca-Cola for the past 40 years.
   Pernod-Ricard put the price higher, at about $155 million. A
spokesman said the difference reflected a payment covering items
such as current contracts and goodwill.
   Coca-Cola's decision to take over its bottling and distribution
activities in France is part of a broader strategy of boosting
consumption of its products worldwide.
   The conflict between Pernod-Ricard and Coca-Cola arose when the
Atlanta-based company said it wanted to take over the French
operations, claiming that Pernod-Ricard was not trying hard enough
to market Coca-Cola products in France.
   Pernod-Ricard accused Coca Cola of breach of contract and took
the matter to court.
   SPBG's sales of Coca-Cola products last year totalled roughly
$220 million, or 42 percent of Pernod-Ricard's soft-drinks business
last year.
   Cyriac de Salaberry, a spokesman for Coca-Cola in Paris, said
the bulk of the purchase price reflects real-estate assets, mainly
bottling plants and storage depots.
   Apart from Coca-Cola, SPBG bottles and distributes Coca-Cola
soft drinks under the brand names Sprite, Fanta and Finley. By
acquiring SPBG, Coca-Cola now has control of more than 90 percent
of its products sold in France.

<DATELINE>DALLAS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   NCNB Corp. on Wednesday bought out the federal
government's 51 percent interest in NCNB Texas National Bank,
completing the $1.32 billion purchase of the institution created in
the nation's costliest bank failure.
   The buyout, announced 10 days ago, comes four years ahead of a
timetable established last year when NCNB was selected to manage
the 40 failed banks of First RepublicBank Corp.
   In that deal, Charlotte, N.C.-based NCNB also got a five-year
option to buy all of Texas' largest bank holding company, which has
$27.9 billion in assets. NCNB changed the company's name to NCNB
Texas at that time.
   With the acquisition, NCNB becomes the nation's ninth-largest
commercial bank, with about $60 billion in assets and $43.2 billion
in deposits.
   NCNB paid $210 million for a 20 percent share of NCNB Texas on
Nov. 22, then accelerated its plans, paying $310 million for an
additional 29 percent on April 28 and $800 million for the
remaining shares Wednesday.
   The price gives a $270 million profit to the Federal Deposit
Insurance Corp., which provided $840 million of the initial
recapitalization of First RepublicBank. The FDIC also is financing
part of Wednesday's purchase through a $320 million in a one-year,
interest-bearing note.
   In all, the government has estimated the First RepublicBank
rescue will cost $3 billion.
   Improved profits at the Texas institution led to NCNB's decision
to move up its purchase, the bank said last month. NCNB Texas
earned $63.1 million in the second quarter, with $28.8 million
going to NCNB Corp.
   Analysts said the buyout also removes some potential roadblocks
to NCNB Texas acquiring other banks or thrifts as the state's
troubled financial industry is cleaned up.
   Since entering the Texas market, NCNB Corp. has sold $410
million worth of additional stock and seen its stock price climb to
over $54 a share, more than double its share price on July 29,
1988, when the FDIC announced the deal.

<DATELINE>TAMPA, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A subsidiary of one of Mexico's largest
publicly held companies Wednesday announced a $280 million cash
offer for Anchor Glass Container Corp., mired in its second year of
losses after a rapid rise to become America's No. 2 glass maker.
   The subsidiary of Vitro SA has offered $20 a share for the
Tampa-based company. The Vitro subsidiary, THR Corp., and its
affiliates already own 1.43 million shares of Tampa-based Anchor,
or about 10.3 percent of shares outstanding.
   Stock in Anchor Glass shot up more than 60 percent Wednesday,
gaining $7.50 a share to close at $19.75 in consolidated New York
Stock Exchange trading.
   Ernesto Martens, chief executive officer of the Mexican glass
maker, said the takeover could erase financial difficulties at
Anchor.
   ``We believe that our financial, technological and management
resources can reverse what has been a significant decline in
Anchor's operating results and financial position,'' Martens said
in a letter to Vincent J. Naimoli, chairman and chief executive
officer of Anchor. ``We are prepared to make the substantial
capital expenditures required for Anchor's business to reverse this
decline.''
   Anchor has blamed its losses on restructuring costs and a
downturn in the glass container industry. In 1988, Anchor company
posted a loss of $8.5 million and closed two plants. So far this
year it has lost $14.4 million.
   This January, Anchor announced a 5 percent price increase on its
products due to higher raw material costs.
   Vitro's cash-tender offer expires at midnight Sept. 7.
   ``Right now the official word from the company is no comment,''
said Anchor spokeswoman Diane Villanova.
   Anchor manufactures glass containers for the brewing, food, soft
drink, distilled spirits and wine industries. In 1987, it acquired
competitor Diamond-Bathhurst Inc. for nearly $191.3 million.
   Corning Glass Works in Corning, N.Y., is the nation's largest
glass manufacturer, but does not specialize in bottles or
containers.
   Vitro, headquartered in Monterrey, manufactures glass and
plastic containers, flat glass, major appliances, tableware and
glass-making machinery. In 1988, the company earned over $150
million on revenues of almost $1.1 billion.
   It has about 8,000 shareholders and is one of Mexico's largest
employers, with more than 37,000 employees.
   Richard Palm, an analyst at Merrill Lynch &amp; Co. in New York,
said the $20-per-share offer appears reasonable considering the
uncertainty in the glass container industry.
   ``Shipments of glass containers have been down seven of the last
eight years and they are only up this year modestly,'' said Palm.
   The Mexican company is also seeking to acquire Latchford Glass
Co., based in Huntington Park, Calif. The tender offer for Anchor
is not conditioned on the acquisition of Latchford.

   Brimming storage tanks of gasoline that should
be almost empty are teaching oil companies an old economics lesson
this summer: When prices rise, consumers buy less.
   The cost of gasoline, which soared 20 cents or more this spring
in the aftermath of the Exxon Valdez oil spill and widespread
predictions of shortages, has been stabilizing and even dropping in
some places because of a surprising oversupply at the height of the
driving season.
   ``Major oil companies expected people were more indifferent to
prices than they actually turned out to be,'' says William Veno,
director of oil market analysis for Data Resources Inc., an
economic research concern. ``They wouldn't have wanted to raise
prices so much as to undermine demand and they've tended to do
that.''
   Not only are motorists making fewer trips to the filling
station, they're also buying cheaper grades of gasoline, industry
statistics suggest. The result is that instead of shortages there
are surpluses, especially of high-priced high-octane premium.
   That doesn't mean demand couldn't pick up _ there's still a good
month's worth of summer vacation season left. More gasoline
consumption could alter the supply-demand equation and prices could
start rising.
   But as of late last month, the average retail price for all
types of gasoline had dropped to $1.13 a gallon from a peak $1.18 a
gallon on May 19, according to statistics from the Lundberg Survey
Inc., a research group that tracks gasoline prices nationwide.
   The Bureau of Labor Statistics in Washington, which monitors the
inflation rate, estimates the average price per gallon for all
grades of motor fuel soared from 94.4 cents in January to $1.15 in
June, a 22 percent gain.
   High octane, which averaged about $1.09 in January, rose 19
cents to $1.28 a gallon in June. Unleaded regular, the most widely
consumed grade, rose from about 92 cents a gallon to $1.11.
   ``When prices of gasoline went up people bought less but more
important they started buying cheaper grades,'' says Dennis Eklof,
an energy specialist with the consulting group Cambridge Energy
Research Associates. ``When the customer switches and downgrades it
increases the overall supply in total.''
   Petroleum Intelligence Weekly, an industry trade publication,
reported recently that premium unleaded sales have fallen at least
10 percent because of motorists switching to regular unleaded.
   Wholesale prices are down even more sharply than retail, in some
cases below levels last seen two years ago. That could translate
into even lower retail prices in coming months.
   The New York price of wholesale regular unleaded, for example,
fell from 78 cents a gallon in late April to about 51 cents a
gallon earlier this month.
   Overestimates of summer driving and concern about supply
disruptions caused by the Exxon oil spill led refiners to make too
much gasoline, analysts say. ``What happened is that people altered
their plans,'' says Brent Crosby, executive director of the Service
Station Dealers of Arizona. ``So the big usage didn't materialize
and now we have a glut of refined product on the market. If the
price falls that much it has to be a tremendous oversupply.''
   Predictions of shortages arose from a number of other causes.
Tougher federal antipollution regulations, for example, require
refineries to use more crude in making gasoline. Refinery
accidents, maintenance delays, and lower production from Britain's
North Sea fields also played a role.
   But the biggest shot to the market psyche was the Exxon oil
spill.
   The March 24 disaster in Alaska jolted the market because the
cleanup temporarily disrupted the flow of crude to West Coast
refiners, raising the possibility of shortages. Refiners responded
by reducing sales to customers.
   Almost overnight, prices rocketed, with wholesale premium
gasoline up 30 cents in some parts of the country. In Los Angeles,
for example, regular unleaded surged to $1.07 on April 5 from 74
cents the day of the spill. The price shock quickly rippled through
the country.
   In the end, shipments from Alaska were disrupted for days
instead of weeks. About 13 million barrels of southbound crude was
delayed, in addition to the 250,000 barrels lost from the leaking
Exxon tanker.
   Moreover, refinery repairs and accidents had not caused other
delays anticipated earlier. Refinery capacity turned out to be
greater than expected and refiners were better prepared to handle
the new antipollution requirements.
   After the spill, crude oil prices stabilized in the
$19-$20-a-barrel range until last month, when they slid to about
$18 in response to the softening gasoline market and a surge in
summer production by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting
Countries.
   Refiners are just starting to slow production while the surplus
dwindles. But that means crude oil stockpiles are growing.
   ``It's a double-edged sword. If refiners don't cut back there's
too much product. If they do then there is too much crude,'' says
James R. Fiedler, energy analyst at E.D.&amp;F. Man International
Futures Inc.
   Whether late-summer vacationers will reduce the oversupply of
gasoline remains unclear. The American Automobile Association,
which tracks summer driving, had predicted a 4 percent increase
this year over last but now says that growth is unlikely.
   ``It is fair to say that gasoline prices have had an impact on
gasoline consumption and driving habits as well,'' says Jerry
Cheske, spokesman for AAA. ``Whether people cancelled vacations I
don't think so. They're just more conservative in their driving
habits.''
   Some analysts believe consumers have sent a clear message to oil
companies.
   ``The lesson oil companies are learning is that you can't go and
raise prices by 20 percent and not expect something to happen,''
Veno says. ``It's a big lesson.''

   Lottery giant Gtech Corp. announced
Wednesday it has agreed to a $290 million buyout by about a dozen
members of management and a unit of the investment firm Donaldson,
Lufkin &amp; Jenrette Securities Corp.
   The price tag includes roughly $160 million for Gtech's stock
and $130 million for payment of fees, refinancing of Gtech's debts
and a contribution to working capital.
   The top managers, including Guy B. Snowden, the chairman and
chief executive, and Victor Markowicz, Gtech's vice chairman, will
retain their positions in the company, Snowden said.
   The purchase price was $16.62{ per share in cash. Gtech stock
rose 75 cents a share to $16 in over-the-counter trading on
Wednesday. The price had been inflated before the announcement by
speculation of a possible acquisition.
   The company has nearly 10 million shares outstanding.
   Gtech, a leading supplier worldwide of on-line computerized
lottery networks, currently serves 35 customers in the United
States and elsewhere, including Ireland, New Zealand, Mexico,
Spain, Venezuela, Iceland, Australia, Sweden, Singapore and Canada.
   If the recently approved sports betting in Oregon spreads to
other states, Gtech would be ``a major beneficiary from this
spread,'' since the sports betting would use the same machines as
the existing lotteries, said William Ritger, an analyst with
Dillon, Read &amp; Co. Inc.
   ``Gtech is going to continue on in the lottery business as is,''
Snowden said in a telephone interview Wednesday. ``We are a leader
in the business and we aim to stay a leader.''
   The merger was approved by the Gtech board on Tuesday but
requires approval from Gtech shareholders at a meeting later this
year. Snowden said the meeting would be held in the fall but he
would not say precisely when.
   The company noted that the agreement depends on completion of
financing and on certain government approval and assurances from
some lottery authorities to continue Gtech's contracts.
   Rumors of a possible Gtech takeover surfaced last October,
prompting Snowden to issue a statement saying the company had an
``open-door policy'' and would consider offers.
   In early May, Gtech acknowledged that certain parties had
expressed an interest in acquiring the company. Also in May, the
company announced the establishment of a special committee to
evaluate possible business combinations. The committee consisted of
directors and financial advisors from Bear, Stearns &amp; Co. Inc., and
Alex. Brown &amp; Sons Inc.
   Snowden declined Wednesday to talk about the outside interest,
other than saying ``we were talking to a lot of people about a lot
of things.''
   Snowden said last year he felt an unfriendly takeover was
unlikely, since any disruption of the company's top management team
would wreck most of its contracts, in both logistical and legal
terms.

   The dollar turned narrowly mixed Wednesday
against key foreign currencies in sluggish trading.
   Gold prices were also mixed. On the Commodity Exchange in New
York, gold bullion for current delivery rose to $366.90 a troy
ounce from $366.20 late Tuesday. Republic National Bank of New York
quoted a late bid for gold at $366 an ounce, up $1.70.
   Currency dealers said concerns of slow economic growth brought a
soft tone to the market.
   The Federal Reserve released its regular bank survey of economic
conditions, known as its ``beige book,'' on Wednesday, and that
showed the economy was still growing but at a slower pace.
   Dealers said the report indicated the central bank had room to
cut interest rates further, which could depress the value of the
U.S. currency.
   Earl I. Johnson, a dealer at Harris Trust &amp; Co. in Chicago,
said, ``There's really no motivation now to buy dollars until we
know clearly how soft the economy is.''
   In Tokyo, where trading ends before Europe's business day
begins, the dollar fell 0.40 yen to a closing 138.85 yen. It traded
at 139.13 yen in London, and at 138.945 yen in New York, up from
138.865.
   The dollar rose against the British pound in London. The pound
fell to $1.6170 from $1.6250 late Tuesday. Sterling fetched $1.6625
in New York, up from $1.6255.
   Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late
Tuesday's rates, included: 1.8935 West German marks, unchanged;
1.6315 Swiss francs, up from 1.6288; 1.17095 Canadian dollars, down
from 1.17195; 6.4000 French francs, down from 6.4040; and 1,361.50
Italian lire, up from 1,361.00.
   Late dollar rates in Europe compared with Tuesday: 1.9000 West
German marks, up from 1.8900; 1.6350 Swiss francs, up from 1.6270;
6.4050 French francs, up from 6.3995; 2.1440 Dutch guilders, up
from 2.1398; 1.1710 Canadian dollars, down from 1.1720; and
1,364.40 Italian lire, up from 1,362.50.
   Gold traded at a bid price of $365.75 an ounce in London, up
from $365.45 late Tuesday. In Zurich gold closed at a bid price of
$365 an ounce, down from $365.85.
   Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold fell $1.40 to close at a bid $365.88
an ounce.
   Silver prices headed lower. On New York's Comex, silver bullion
for current delivery fell to $5.155 a troy ounce from $5.156.
Silver was bid at $5.15 an ounce in London, down 1 cent.

<HEAD>Corn Prices Lower, Soybeans, Wheat Climb Before USDA Crop Report</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JIM LITKE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Corn futures were lower, but soybeans and wheat prices finished
higher Wednesday as traders hewed to narrow ranges in advance of a
much-anticipated U.S. Department of Agriculture survey of crop
production for the year.
   On other markets, sugar futures surged on rumors that India was
in the market for as many as 300,000 tons; heating oil led a modest
run-up in the petroleum futures complex; and frozen pork belly
prices continued sliding in the face of historically high
inventories.
   Corn came under pressure with the opening bell at the Chicago
Board of Trade because of the unusually high crop production
estimate _ 7.72 billion bushels _ released after the close of
trading Tuesday by influential private forecaster Conrad Leslie.
   Although Leslie's forecast for soybeans was high as well _ 1.95
billion bushels _ most traders apparently felt that was discounted
during the late wave of selling Tuesday that dragged November
soybeans to yet another contract low.
   Traders tested the contract low at $5.62 again early Wednesday.
After support held above that mark, many traders squared up their
positions and headed to the sidelines to await Thursday's
government report.
   ``The confusion between Leslie's numbers and what the traders
were looking for pulled the market the past two days,'' said Jerry
Gidel, research director for LIT America Inc., Chicago. ``I think
people were happy just to even up and wait and see what the
official numbers look like.''
   Wheat settled 1{ cents to 5 cents higher, with the contract for
delivery in September at $3.95 a bushel; corn was { cent to 2 cents
lower, with September at $2.23 a bushel; oats were 1\ cents lower
to unchanged, with September at $1.36 a bushel; soybeans were 1{
cents to 9 cents higher, with August at $5.94 a bushel.
   Rumors of a big purchase by India, which some traders speculated
may already have taken place, pushed sugar futures prices above 14
cents a pound at mid-session.
   ``That number has psychological value and it got some people
excited enough to jump on the bandwagon,'' said Arthur Stevenson of
Prudential-Bache Securities Inc., New York. ``Sugar supplies have
been tight for a while and a report of somebody coming in and
taking that much out of the market was bound to spur a rally.''
   Late profit-taking helped trim the gains, however, and sugar
finished .05 cent to .26 cent higher on the New York Coffee, Sugar
and Cocoa Exchange, with October at 14.07 cents.
   An American Petroleum Institute report released after Tuesday's
trading showed a substantial drawdown in heating oil supplies last
month and that lifted the entire complex.
   Crude oil was 9 cents to 14 cents higher at the New York
Mercantile Exchange, with September at $18.21 a barrel; heating oil
was .66 cent to .96 cent higher, with September at 49.43 cents a
gallon; and unleaded gasoline was .14 cent to .40 cent higher, with
September at 50.58 cents a gallon.
   Livestock futures were mostly lower, while pork futures were
sharply lower at the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.
   Live cattle were .35 cent lower to .27 cent higher, with August
at 74.57 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .15 cent lower to .33
cent higher, with August at 84.90 cents a pound; live hogs were .33
cent to 1.23 cents lower, with August at 46.77 cents a pound; and
frozen pork bellies were .30 cent to 1.13 cents higher, with August
at 24.92 cents a pound.
   Precious metals were mixed.
   Gold prices climbed 10 cents to 70 cents on the Comex, with
August at $366.90 a troy ounce; silver slipped 1 cent to 3 cents,
with August at 515.5 cents. Platinum, traded on the New York Merc,
was $1 to $1.80 lower, with September at $484.70 a troy ounce.

<HEAD>Paramount Stock Advances in Active Trading on Takeover Rumors</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The price of Paramount Communications Inc. stock
rose in active trading Wednesday on speculation that the company
that launched an unsuccessful $12.2 billion bid for Time Inc. was
itself a takeover target.
   Paramount rose $2.50 to $62.12{ a share and was the second most
actively traded issue on the New York Stock Exchange as more than
4.1 million of its shares changed hands. Paramount stock rose
$2.62{ a share on Tuesday.
   Paramount, the one-time conglomerate that has been selling
assets outside its entertainment and publishing businesses under
Chairman Martin Davis, said it ``does not comment on market
activity, rumors or speculation.''
   Jeffrey Logdson, who follows Paramount for the investment firm
Crowell Weedon &amp; Co. in Los Angeles, said the activity in
Paramount's stock reflected the ``swirl of rumors'' about possible
suitors for the company.
   Among those mentioned have been Chris-Craft Industries Inc. _ a
media concern that is a major shareholder in Warner Communications
Inc. _ and an investor group led by Charles Dolan, head of
Cablevision Systems Corp., a Long Island, N.Y.-based cable
television company.
   Columnist Dan Dorfman said in Wednesday's edition of USA Today
that a group of investors led by Dolan had acquired a stake in
Paramount and may seek control.
   Dolan was said to be out of the country and unavailable for
comment. Cablevision spokesman David Carey said, ``It is our policy
neither to confirm nor deny any speculation about a possible
acquisition.''
   Two calls placed to Chris-Craft were not returned.
   Paramount recently tried but failed with an eleventh-hour
hostile bid for Time, which had earlier agreed to a merger with
Warner.
   Paramount offered $10.7 billion for Time and later raised its
offer to $12.2 billion, but Time deflected the bid by insisting it
was not for sale and amending its stock-swap merger with Warner
into a $14 billion Warner buyout.
   Paramount failed to win a fight in the Delaware state courts to
block the Time-Warner merger and dropped its bid July 24.
   Late last month, Paramount said it had agreed to sell its
consumer and commercial finance unit, The Associates Corp., for
$3.35 billion to Ford Motor Co.
   But some analysts said the sale of the unit that accounted for
46 percent of Paramount's operating income in 1988, coupled with an
expected infusion of cash, could make Paramount more attractive to
bidders.

   Oil futures prices rose Wednesday on news that
refineries pumped less gasoline last week.
   West Texas Intermediate for September delivery rose 9 cents on
the New York Mercantile Exchange and finished at $18.21 a barrel.
WTI sets the standard in the U.S. industry for light, sweet crude
oil.
   Contracts for later delivery of WTI posted slightly higher gains.
   Domestic heating oil traded on the exchange showed the biggest
gains. The contract for September rose 0.87 cent to 49.43 cents a
gallon while October rose 0.92 cent to 50.16 cents.
   September unleaded gasoline finished 0.14 cent higher at 50.58
cents a gallon while other contracts also advanced.
   Statistics from the American Petroleum Institute showed that
crude oil runs at refineries fell by 500,000 barrels last week,
while distillate, or heating oil, runs declined by 100,000 barrels.
   The figures suggest that refineries, which have operated at the
highest levels in a decade, slowed their output of gasoline and
heating oil.
   Energy analysts said that those statistics helped offset what
could have been a negative impact from the same API report, which
showed that supplies of crude oil, gasoline and heating oil in
storage all rose during the same week ended Aug. 4.
   Gasoline prices have softened in recent weeks as supply exceeded
demand and inventories increased.
   Crude prices also have weakened recently due to the surge in
summer output by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries
and sluggish demand.
   Analysts said the new API data might lead investors to believe
that market fundamentals are improving.
   ``It's too early to say if this is the beginning of a sustained
rally,'' said Andrew Lebow, senior broker for E.D.&amp;F. Man
International Futures Inc. ``It could be that traders will be
looking ahead to heating oil season.''

<HEAD>Casino Commission Approves $350 Million Debt Plan</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Bally Manufacturing Corp. can
begin a $350 million debt refinancing to be paid for largely
through its Park Place Casino in Atlantic City, state regulators
ruled Wednesday.
   The Casino Control Commission rejected arguments from state
gaming officials that the refinancing would put Park Place, one of
Atlantic City's leading gaming halls, on shaky financial footing.
   ``I find that this is a responsible proposal which will not
jeopardize Park Place's financial stability or its ability to
maintain a first-class facility,'' commission chairman Walter N.
Read said.
   Bally Manufacturing, the casino's Chicago-based parent company,
wants to make Park Place more independent. The refinancing plan
includes offering $350 million in mortgage notes to fund a $150
million dividend payment to Bally and retire existing corporate
debt.
   The casino would incur the $350 million debt. About $120 million
would be used by the parent firm to retire debt unrelated to
Atlantic City ventures.
   Read admitted the proposal would increase Park Place's debt
without an equal benefit to the casino.
   But he said he is ``satisfied that the proposed transaction is
responsible and is not a plan to siphon funds from a healthy
facility and leave it in a weakened state. Nor does it mark the
beginning of a withdrawal by (Bally) from the New Jersey gaming
market.''
   Read said Bally has invested more than $600 million in Park
Place while receiving just $43 million in dividends and plans to
spend $213 million more on capital improvements.
   Dissenting commissioner W. David Waters and state Division of
Gaming Enforcement officials argued that the casino will have
problems paying off the debt despite promises by Bally officials.
   Waters said the plan ``merely reshuffles financing to Bally
Manufacturing.''
   ``It in no way benefits the Park Place,'' he said. ``The
facility is basically self-financing. Its future ability to be
self-financing is inhibited.''
   Bally attorney Clive Cummis said the restructuring plan would
begin soon, but he was not more specific.

<TEXT>
   Finance Minister Mailson da Nobrega said
Wednesday the nation's foreign creditors have agreed to a delay in
debt payments and he denied Brazil will enter a moratorium.
   Da Nobrega told the congressional Finance Commission that the
government wanted to avoid a confrontation with creditors and
wished to ``negotiate lateness'' until the country's foreign
reserves reached a ``respectable level.''
   In July, the government restricted the outflow of dollars by
channeling all foreign exchange operations through the Central
Bank, equivalent to the U.S. Federal Reserve.
   Since then, Brazil's cash reserves have risen nearly $1 billion
to $6.5 billion, surpassing the minimum level considered safe by
the government, which is $6 billion, equivalent to four months of
imports.
   But the government continues to hold back about $1 billion in
debt payments since June 30, including $400 million to Western
government leaders due July 3 and some $600 million in interest
payments and dividend remittances by foreign multinationals, da
Nobrega said.
   That falls short of a moratorium, which would be a total halt to
payments on foreign debt.
   Da Nobrega said the government needed the reserves to avoid
shocks from abroad and insure a smooth transition of government
during the coming months.
   On Nov. 15, Brazilians will elect President Jose Sarney's
successor in the nation's first people's vote in 29 years. The
winner will take office on Mar. 15, 1990.
   Brazil, tottering under a $112 billion foreign debt, the Third
World's largest, is also seeking fresh money to meet an interest
payment of $3 billion due in September to private foreign banks.
   The government is negotiating an agreement with the
International Monetary Fund that would allow Brazil to receive $4
billion in fresh loans withheld by private banks and lending
organizations.
   Creditors have balked at lending more money to Brazil, which has
not controlled an annual inflation rate of 1,000 percent, monetary
expansion and a soaring public defecit.
   Brazil's public deficit, running at around 7 percent of GNP this
year, is one of the principal generators of inflation.

<HEAD>Retirees Sue GM Over Health-Care Costs</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DETROIT (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A group of retired General Motors Corp. salaried
employees has sued the automaker, claiming GM broke health-care
promises and owes them money they shouldn't have had to pay.
   The group of 114 retired employees said in the suit filed in a
Los Angeles federal court Tuesday that GM cut their health-care
coverage after promising them the items would be covered.
   The suit, filed as a class action on behalf of more than 80,000
retired GM salaried workers, most of whom live in Michigan,
Florida, California and Ohio, seeks reinstatement of the cut
benefits and reimbursement of out-of-pocket expenses they have
spent.
   GM spokeswoman Patricia Malloy said company officials had no
comment on the suit since they haven't had time to study it.
   Malloy said all salaried GM workers should have known their
health care benefits could change. She said changes were made to
encourage active and retired employees to switch to more economical
health care plans, such as health maintenance organizations.
   Last year, the company eliminated or reduced some coverage for
the retirees, including chiropractic and psychiatric care, and
imposed copayments and deductibles on basic health coverage.
   ``GM said we would have these benefits for our lifetimes,'' said
Leonard Moeller of Fenton, Mich., an accountant who retired in
1982. ``I felt we had a moral our
years in jail, Prensa Latina said. It said that the three would be
prosecuted, but did not elaborate.
   The official Mexican news agency Notimex said the three were
arrested Sunday and legal proceedings began Wednesday in Havana
provincial court. The agency gave no word on the trial.
   In a dispatch from Havana, Notimex quoted the Communist Party
newspaper Granma as saying the three were of ``known
counterrevolutionary affiliation'' and ``carried out a campaign of
slander'' in statements to U.S. television and ``the anti-Cuban
radio sponsored by Washington,'' a reference to the U.S.
government's Radio Marti.
   Neither news agency said how or when the three talked to U.S.
news media.
   The three allegedly told foreign news media that Maj. Gen.
Arnaldo Ochoa had been drugged by authorities before he appeared in
court, Prensa Latina said.
   It said the three also alleged that the group accused of drug
trafficking was tortured psychologically and mistreated in other
ways. One of the three said relatives of those who were executed
were not told where they were buried, Prensa Latina said.
   Ochoa and three others were executed last month for their part
in a ring that helped ship tons of cocaine to the United States
through Cuba.
   It was the largest scandal to hit Presdient Fidel Castro's
administration since the Communist leader took power in 1959.

   President Bush, saying, ``I'm proud to sign
this monster,'' Wednesday put his signature on a $159 billion
rescue package for the savings-and-loan industry.
   With the ink barely dry on the 371-page rewrite of federal
banking laws, his administration began putting the plan into
effect, approving the first $815 million installment for cleaning
up the nation's most heavily indebted savings and loans.
   Hours after the signing, the Resolution Trust Corp., the new
federal agency created to dispose of ailing thrifts, said it was
considering unilaterally reducing high interest rates on long-term
certificates issued by some of 262 insolvent but still open thrift
institutions.
   ``The bill is not perfect, but it is a first step, a crucial
first step toward restoring public confidence,'' Bush said at a
Rose Garden bill-signing ceremony attended by the chief architects
of the legislation.
   Bush said the overhaul _ the government's biggest-ever industry
bailout _ will help ``ensure that not one dollar of insured funds
will be lost by any depositor.''
   The legislation, a lightly modified version of the rescue plan
Bush first submitted to Congress Feb. 6, authorizes $50 billion in
new government borrowing over the next 26 months to clean up ailing
S&amp;Ls, in part by buying up high-rate certificates of deposit issued
by the shaky thrifts to attract capital.
   The measure requires S&amp;L owners, within four months, to have
$1.50 in tangible capital for every $100 in lending as a cushion
between future losses and government insurance funds. By 1995, the
standard will tighten to $3 for each $100 in loans.
   The overhaul also toughens criminal penalties for fraud and
triggers the most sweeping overhaul of the banking regulation in 50
years.
   This includes a dismantling of the primary S&amp;L regulatory
agency, the Federal Home Loan Bank Board. Under the overhaul,
federal deposit insurance for S&amp;Ls will be provided by a new
insurance fund called the Savings Association Insurance Funds,
SAIF, pronounced ``safe.''
   Shortly after Bush signed the bill, Treasury Secretary Nicholas
Brady convened a meeting of the Resolution Trust Corp. Oversight
Board, set up by the legislation to sell off sour loans and
repossessed real estate the government is inheriting from the
failed thrifts.
   The board voted to spend $815 million as the first installment
in shutting down or merging S&amp;Ls with the highest negative net
worths, including $215 million for dealing with three yet to be
identified insititutions on Thursday.
   The government, which has already closed 223 S&amp;Ls, is authorized
under the legislation to shut down up to 500 more of the nation's
nearly 3,000 institutions over three years. It is required to spend
$20 billion over the next seven weeks alone on the problem.
   Of that $20 billion, $15 billion will be used to replace
deposits lost to institutions as high-rate certificates, most with
30-, 60- and 90-day terms and some paying up to 11 percent
interest, come due.
   The Resolution Trust Corp. said those certificates could be
renewed, but at interest rates up to 3 percentage points under what
they are now earning, and expects some of the certificate money to
be withdrawn.
   Unresolved is whether the corporation will continue to honor the
high interest rates on longer-term certificates, as the bank board
had.
   At issue are long-term certificates issued by 262 institutions
the federal government has already taken over but has not had the
money to redeem. Those institutions' high-rate certificates total
$50 billion, but only a small portion of them are long-term,
according to analysts.
   The resolution corporation is expected to decide within the next
few days how to honor the certificates.
   Latest administration estimates put the total cost of the
bailout at $159 billion through 1999.
   Bush said the measure, which received final congressional
approval Saturday, ``says to tens of millions of savings and loan
depositors: you will not be the victims of others' mistakes.''
   In a reference to the nearly foot-thick ``Financial Institutions
Reform, Recovery and Enforcement Act of 1989'' resting on a table
awaiting his signature, Bush said, ``Thank you all very much and,
now, I'm proud to sign this monster.''
   Among the 300 or so people at the signing ceremony were Treasury
Secretary Brady, Housing and Urban Development Secretary Jack Kemp
and key Capitol Hill backers of the legislation, including Sen.
Donald W. Riegle Jr., D-Mich., and Rep. Henry B. Gonzalez, D-Texas,
chairmen of the congressional banking committees.
   Riegle later told reporters, ``The bill deals with every major
problem we were able to identify.'' He praised the administration
for moving to put the plan into effect so quickly.
   Some analysts expect that government buyouts and mergers with
commercial banks will leave only 1,000 or so savings and loans
still in business at the end of five years.
   Bush said that the legislation ``comes to grips with the
problems facing our savings and loan industry. It will safeguard
and stabilize America's financial system and put in place permanent
reforms so these problems will never happen again.''
   The bill includes punishments for fraud committed by officers
and directors of financial institutions of up to $1 million a day
in fines and 20 years in prison.
   ``Those who try and loot the savings of their fellow citizens
deserve, and will receive, swift and severe punishment,'' Bush said.

   Harvey Publications Inc., which owns the rights
to a number of classic cartoon and comic book characters including
Casper, the Friendly Ghost, has been sold for an undisclosed price,
it was announced Wednesday.
   The family-owned New York-based concern, which publishes comic
books and has a library of 248 film cartoons from the 1950s and
1960s, is being sold to HMH Communications Inc., a company headed
by Jeffrey A. Montgomery, described in a news release as a
25-year-old entrepreneur from Los Angeles.
   Montgomery said he planned to create and produce half-hour
television cartoon series based on the Harvey characters and
increase the publication of Harvey's comic books.
   Among the other Harvey characters are Richie Rich, ``the Poor
Little Rich Boy,'' Baby Huey, Little Audrey and Little Dot.
   Harvey Publications was founded in 1940 by Alfred Harvey.
Montgomery said he approached the Harvey family about buying the
company.

   Twelve traders in the Japanese yen pit at the
Chicago Mercantile Exchange pleaded innocent Wednesday to charges
stemming from the federal probe of trading practices at the world's
largest futures markets.
   The 12 were among 46 traders named a week ago in the first
indictments resulting from the undercover investigation. Charges
ranged from pre-arranged trading to racketeering conspiracy and tax
fraud, most alleging schemes in which traders pocketed profits from
trades made for customers while passing their own losses on to
customers.
   U.S. District Judge George M. Marovich set Aug. 16 as the next
hearing date for the 12 traders. The judge said he would set a
trial date at that time.
   Five of the traders _ John M. Baker, 50, Sam A. Cali, 38, Thomas
A. Crouch, 43, Ray Pace, 33, and Michael D. Smith, 34 _ pleaded
innocent to charges of violating the Racketeer Influenced and
Corrupt Organizations Act, as well as to multiple counts of mail
and wire fraud.
   The remaining seven traders pleaded innocent to charges of mail
and wire fraud.
   Published reports have said that as many as 30 defendants are
expected to plead guilty and cooperate with authorities.
   Three of the 21 traders indicted at the yen pit at the Chicago
Mercantile Exchange pleaded guilty Tuesday. The remaining 25
defendants traded in the Swiss franc pits at the Merc, and in the
soybean and U.S. Treasury bond pits at the Chicago Board of Trade.
   The indictments were handed up Aug. 2. In the FBI probe, agents
posed as traders on the floors of the two exchanges and
tape-recorded illegal transactions.
   More indictments are expected this fall as a result of the
continuing investigation.
   The first traders to be arraigned in the case pleaded guilty
Tuesday to fraud and Commodities Exchange Act violations.
   As part of their plea agreements, Thomas Braniff, Brian Sledz
and his brother, James Sledz, admitted to making pre-arranged
trades among themselves and other indicted traders.
   They have agreed to make restitution to customers, and face
prison terms and stiff fines from the government and the Merc. All
have been banned from the exchange.

<UNK>Video Rental Chain Agrees Not To Copy Nintendo Manuals.</UNK>
<DATELINE>NEWARK, N.J. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A nationwide video rental chain agreed not
to photocopy instruction manuals for Nintendo games its stores were
renting out, according to court papers filed Wednesday.
   Nintendo of America of Redmond, Wash., last week sued the chain,
Blockbuster Entertainment Corp. of Fort Lauderdale, Fla., charging
copyright infringement.
   Nintendo said he chain of 600 stores was frequently copying the
booklets and charging renters a fee if the manuals were lost.
   The Japanese video game company submitted 6 inches of legal
papers with its complaint, most of them booklets and copies. The
lawsuit specifically named four stores in New Jersey, allowing the
case to be filed here.
   Nintendo charged that Blockbuster ignored its request in a July
31 letter to stop the practice. In a statement released Wednesday
by Blockbuster, the chain said it had already told its managers not
to copy the manuals.
   Both sides agreed to a court order filed Wednesday by U.S.
District Judge Alfred M. Wolin. The order also requires Blockbuster
within five days to send a letter drafted by Nintendo's lawyers
warning its franchises and managers not to copy manuals.
   Nintendo of America is a wholly owned subsidiary of Nintendo Co.
Ltd. of Japan.

<TEXT>
   McCaw Cellular Communications Inc., the
nation's largest cellular telephone company, said Wednesday its
second-quarter loss widened to $87.5 million from $61.7 million a
year ago.
   But Chairman and Chief Executive Craig McCaw said the losses
``are consistent with company expectations since many of our
cellular markets remain in their start-up phase.''
   Costs for acquisitions, construction, interest, marketing and
depreciation are expected to remain high as the company builds its
cellular operations, McCaw said. However, he said operating margins
are improving as the number of cellular subscribers grows.
   Revenue for the quarter rose 64.3 percent to $120.1 million from
$73.1 million a year earlier.
   McCaw has made a hostile tender offer for LIN Broadcasting
Corp., a New York-based cellular telephone, television broadcasting
and publishing company. McCaw has offered $110 a share for the 90.2
percent of LIN's stock it doesn't already own, or about $5.4
billion.
   LIN says the offer, which McCaw has extended until Sept. 1, is
inadequate.
   For the first six months of 1989, McCaw lost $185.2 million on
revenue of $222.2 million in contrast to losses of $123.1 million
on revenue of $141.1 million for the same period of 1988.
   McCaw provides cellular telephone service in a number of major
markets, including Miami, Pittsburgh, Minneapolis, Kansas City,
Mo., Denver, Portland, Ore., and Seattle. It said the number of
cellular subscribers in its markets and in markets where it has the
right to buy a controlling interest increased by 30 percent to
336,000 as of June 30, from 258,000 at the end of 1988.

   Union and Bell Atlantic representatives
expressed little optimism Wednesday for an early end to a walkout
that has slowed some telephone services in six states and the
District of Columbia since Sunday.
   Strikes also continued against NYNEX Corp., which operates in
New York and New England, and Pacific Telesis, in California and
Nevada.
   In all, about 157,000 union workers in 15 states and the
District of Columbia were on strike, forcing management to work
long hours in such jobs as answering directory assistance queries
and making limited repair calls.
   In a statement Wednesday, the AFL-CIO urged the public, union
members and their families not to pay their phone bills until the
strikes at Bell Atlantic, NYNEX and Pacific Telesis are settled.
   The resolution was passed Tuesday by the AFL-CIO Executive
Council, according to a statement.
   Bell Atlantic and the Communications Workers of America were not
scheduled to meet Wednesday, but had a negotiating session set for
Thursday, a company spokesman said.
   No progress was made in their first face-to-face, post-strike
meeting Tuesday, both sides agreed.
   Bill Bickers, spokesman for the Communications Workers of
America, said, ``It appears that the company has a time lag, and
this may very well stall things. It's certainly not helping the
process.''
   Another CWA spokesman, Don Gathers in Richmond, Va., added,
``Nothing has changed, really, since Sunday.''
   ``There is some slowness in getting directory assistance and in
operator assistance for toll calls in our area of service,'' said
Bell of Pennsylvania spokesman Thomas Duddy.
   ``But everything else which is automated is working fine,'' he
said.
   In Boston, police on Wednesday arrested at least 35 striking
telephone workers blocking entrances to headquarters of New England
Telephone, a NYNEX subsidiary, and a contractor's garage. They were
arraigned on disorderly conduct charges and released on their own
recognizance.
   Officials of New Jersey Bell Telephone Co. reported that lines
were cut in five communities serving about 2,000 customers.

   Richard W. Simmons, former chairman of the
Midwest Stock Exchange and a founding partner in the Chicago

   Simmons, who was chairman of the Midwest exchange in 1969 and
1970, died Tuesday at suburban Lake Forest Hospital of undisclosed
causes.
   The prestige of the Midwest Stock Exchange during Simmons' term
as chairman is underscored by the fact that a seat at the Chicago

1987, a staff member said.
   A St. Louis native and graduate of Yale University, Simmons
co-founded his investment and brokerage firm in 1948. It is now

   Simmons, of suburban Lake Bluff, is survived by his wife,

<TEXT>
   Slashing the federal budget deficit would
dramatically improve the nation's $129 billion annual trade
imbalance, congressional fiscal experts said Wednesday.
   The non-partisan Congressional Budget Office said that by
meeting the deficit targets mandated by the Gramm-Rudman law _
which requires a balanced federal budget by 1993 _ the country's
trade shortfall could be cut by $40 billion to $65 billion.
   Many economists agree that reducing federal red ink would help
the trade imbalance. But by producing its 77-page report, which
relies on simulations to make its arguments, CBO provided more
ammunition to members of Congress pressing for a fiscal 1991 budget
deal with the White House that would entail major deficit cuts.
   The congressional agency estimated that eventually, every $1
billion cut in the federal deficit would improve the nation's trade
picture by $300 million to $500 million.
   The CBO also said that expanding the money supply would have
little effect on the U.S. trade deficit, since exchange rates are
flexible.
   ``Among the options policymakers have for reducing the U.S.
current account deficit, reducing the federal budget deficit ... is
the most promising,'' the CBO said.
   The current account deficit is the broadest measure of the trade
deficit, registering not only products but services as well. The
U.S. current account deficit reached $132 billion last year and is
expected to be about $129 billion this year. At the beginning of
this decade, the United States had a slight surplus in trade.
   To pay for the extra goods and services entering this country,
the United States must borrow money from abroad.
   ``In the long run, this borrowing will transfer wealth abroad
and this will reduce living standards of Americans in the future,''
CBO Director Robert D. Reischauer said at a news conference.
   Economists disagree over how threatening the trade imbalance is.
Some say it bodes ill because it could trigger protectionist
legislation and recession, while others argue it means little.
   But they mostly agree that cutting the federal deficit would
ease the trade shortfall by lowering the need to borrow from
abroad, reducing interest rates, allowing the dollar to decline and
thus making American products more attractive to foreign buyers.
   The budget deficit for fiscal 1989 _ which ends Sept. 30 _ is
expected to be about $148 billion. The Gramm-Rudman law's deficit
ceiling for next year is $100 billion, and Congress will resume its
efforts to reach that target when it returns from its summer recess
in September.
   House Budget Committee Chairman Leon Panetta, D-Calif., said the
CBO conclusions ``emphasize the urgency of agreeing upon a bold
deficit reduction package for fiscal year 1991 as soon as
possible.''

<TEXT>
   Harris Corp. is seeking buyers for its
data communications and personal computer divisions after an $85.2
million restructuring intended to streamline operations, the
defense and aerospace contractor said Wednesday.
   The company, which began to scale down in the mid 1980s, is now
organized into four major sectors: electronics, semiconductors,
communications and Lanier Worldwide Inc., the new name of its
Harris-3M international division.
   ``The businesses we are selling are outside the mainstream of
our future interests, and their sale will release assets and other
resources for ... our core businesses,'' said John Hartley,
chairman and chief executive officer, in a press release.
   The release did not name a price for the two divisions or
whether any companies have expressed interest in them.
   The restructuring cost dropped net income for the year ended
June 30 nearly 80 percent, while sales and per-share profit rose.
   For the 12 months ended June 30, the Melbourne-based company
reported net income of $21.3 million, or 55 cents a share, on sales
of $2.2 billion, compared with net income of $100.5 million, or
$2.50 a share, on sales of $1.8 billion for the previous fiscal
year.
   In the fourth quarter, the restructuring costs led to a net loss
of $52 million on sales of $768.3 million, compared with net income
of $1.8 million, or 5 cents a share, on sales of $471.8 million in
the year-ago period.
   In June, Harris pleaded no contest to filing inflated statements
on behalf of a Filipino businessman convicted of defrauding the
Defense Department. Harris agreed to pay $200,000 in fines and
$300,000 to settle civil claims against it arising from a Justice
Department investigation of fraud involving weapons sales to the
Philippines.

   A federal appeals court Wednesday set aside
a decision clearing corporate raider T. Boone Pickens' investment
group of violating securities and racketeering laws in a takeover
bid for Phillips Petroleum Co. five years ago.
   A three-judge panel of the 3rd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals
vacated a lower court's summary judgment in favor of Pickens' Mesa
Partnership and sent the case back to U.S. District Court in
Delaware.
   The lawsuits brought by Phillips shareholders accused Mesa of
deception in its $9.1 billion attempt to take over the
Bartelsville, Okla., oil giant.
   William Wade, an attorney for Mesa, said from Wilmington, Del.,
that he had not seen the decision and would not comment.
   The court ruled a jury could reasonably conclude that Mesa,
which made $89 million on the takeover attempt, had always intended
to sell its Phillips stock back to the company for a better deal
than the other stockholders received. Such a tactic is known as
``greenmail.''
   During the takeover attempt, Pickens repeatedly said Mesa would
not consider selling back its shares unless the same deal was
offered to all stockholders.
   The partnership changed its stance when Phillips adopted a
``poison pill'' strategy to fight the takeover.
   The appeals court said the district court incorrectly cited a
lack of evidence.
   Although much of the evidence was circumstantial, Circuit Judge
Anthony J. Scirica wrote, no other type normally is available in
bad-faith cases.
   ``A jury could reasonably conclude that the partnership either
was reckless in making the equal-basis statements given the
forseeability of what actually occurred or that the partnership
intended from the outset of its tender offer to sell back to
Phillips on an unequal basis,'' Scirica wrote.
   The appeals panel upheld the summary judgment involving all
Delaware state charges.
