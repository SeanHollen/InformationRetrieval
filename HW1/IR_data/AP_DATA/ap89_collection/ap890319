   The Sea Stallion helicopter that crashed in South Korea early
Monday, killing 22 of the 37 Marines aboard, is one of a family of
heavy assault choppers with a reputation for good performance.
   CAPACITY: 55 soldiers, or cargo, plus a crew of four.
   DIMENSIONS: 67 feet, 2 inches long; 24 feet, 11 inches high.
   WEIGHT: Empty, 23,485 pounds; loaded, 42,000 pounds.
   RANGE: 540 miles.
   TOP SPEED: 196 mph.
   MANUFACTURER: Sikorsky Aircraft of Stratford, Conn.
   HISTORY: First ordered by the Marine Corps in 1969 as a successor
to the CH-53A, and used in the Vietnam War. An advanced version, the
CH-53E Super Stallion began service in 1981.
   The Navy, Coast Guard and Air Force also use versions of the
helicopter with differing model names and numbers. A similar model,
the RH-53D Sea Stallion, was used in the abortive U.S. mission to
rescue American hostages held in Iran.

   President Roh Tae-woo said Monday he is
postponing a national referendum on his performance because
``violent leftist forces'' are trying to use it to overthrow the
government.
   In an address on national television, Roh said ``it would not be
of help to the country to hold a national referendum for my
performance in office at this juncture.''
   Roh said the referendum, which had been widely expected sometime
next month, will be held sometime in the future but he gave no date.
The president had been expected this week to announce the date to
keep a promise he made during 1987 presidential elections.
   It was not clear if Roh was backing away from the referendum
because of concern about potential unrest or because he feared the
government could not win the vote and might be forced into new
elections.
   Some opposition and dissident groups had been demanding Roh stake
his presidency on the referendum and step down if defeated. It is
not clear if Roh, a former general, could win a referendum.
   The government had said earlier that Roh would not step down if
he were defeated, but some senior administration officials have
conceded a defeat would put pressure on him to call new elections.
   Roh said anti-government forces were attempting to use the vote
to organize violent protests and topple the government. Dissidents
and radical students have organized violent demonstrations in recent
weeks, but they have little popular support.
   ``The people are worried,'' Roh said. ``Leftist forces are trying
to use the referendum as a foothold to overthrow the free democratic
system.''
   South Korea's divided opposition parties were split over Roh's
decision.
   The Party of Peace and Democracy of Kim Dae-jung welcomed the
decision, while the Reunification Democratic Party of Kim Young-sam
said it would accept a temporary delay.
   Kim Young-sam had been pushing for a referendum after predicting
Roh would lose. Kim Dae-jung opposed a referendum, apparently
because Kim Young-sam's party had overtaken his party in opinion
polls and could win presidential elections.
   The two Kims are bitter rivals who split the opposition vote in
December 1987 presidential elections, allowing Roh to win with 36
percent of the vote. Roh promised during the election campaign to
hold a referendum after his first year in office to give voters a
chance to evaluate his performance.
   Roh also said ``national opinion'' was split on whether to hold
the referendum.
   ``One opposition party said the referendum should be on the
question of policy matters, while another party said it should be on
a vote of no-confidence,'' he said.
   ``In view of these developments, the proposed referendum,
originally intended to stabilize the political situation and
solidify democratization, has lost its meaning,'' Roh said.

   A Liberian chemical tanker sank after burning for
six days off the coast, with all 23 of its crew members still
missing, the coast guard said.
   A Maritime Safety Agency official said the 23,038-ton Maasgusar
broke in two on Sunday and sank, leaving a 700-foot-wide sheet of
fire on the water's surface for about an hour, a coast guard
official said.
   The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said no trace
had been found of the 23 crew members _ 19 Filipinos, three Britons
and an Irishman.
   He said water in the area, about 235 miles southeast of Cape
Inubozaki, was about 18,480 feet deep and it would be difficult to
raise the ship.
   The tanker had been heading for South Korea from Houston when it
was discovered on fire in the Pacific early Tuesday.
   The tanker was carrying 25,700 tons of chemicals, including
ethylene chloride, isopropyl benzene and paraxylene, officials said.

   A gunman who neighbors said was harassed
regularly by teen-agers shot three young children at an apartment
building Saturday and then wounded a police officer before being
killed in a gun battle, authorities said.
   One of the children, Ivory Smith, 9, died at 9:50 p.m. Saturday
in the trauma center of University Hospital in Newark. She had
gunshot wounds to the head, said Bob Arnold, associate administrator
of the hospital.
   Of the two other children, boys aged 8 and 12, one remained
critical and the third was in stable condition at the hospital,
Arnold said. The administrator declined to identify the children,
citing the wishes of family members.
   ``We don't have a motive yet,'' Police Chief Edward Palardy told
reporters at the scene of the shootings. ``It looks like some sort
of disaster in there. A man appears to have gone berserk and started
shooting.''
   The gunman, identified as George Proctor, in his 40s, died at
4:10 p.m. of gunshot wounds, said Margaret Francois, assistant
director of nursing at East Orange General Hospital.
   ``The person that was involved, for whatever reason, became very
antagonistic when he returned home this afternoon,'' said West
Orange Mayor Sam Spina, who visited the scene.
   Two witnesses, Peter Anderson and Eric Green, said they saw
teen-age boys tossing stones at Proctor's Cadillac earlier Saturday
while he was driving in Orange, which borders West Orange. Anderson
and Green said Proctor left his car to confront the youths, and one
of the teen-agers punched him in the face and threatened him.
   The three children who were shot apparently had no connection to
the earlier incident, the witnesses said. Police said they had heard
reports of that incident but would not say whether it was a motive
in the shooting.
   One neighbor, a 15-year resident who said he went fishing
regularly with the gunman, said Proctor had been physically and
verbally harassed recently by teen-age boys in an increasingly
drug-infested neighborhood.
   ``His mind probably just snapped,'' said the neighbor, who added
that he would not give his name for fear of an attack on his family
by neighborhood youths. ``He's a nice guy. ... It's a shame this had
to happen to him.''
   One witness, Robert Gress, who lives across an intersection from
the apartment building in this New York suburb, said he was playing
solitaire in his home shortly before 3 p.m. when he heard gunfire
that ``sounded like firecrackers.''
   Gress said when he looked outside, he saw a young boy by a parked
car across the street screaming, ``The guy's a maniac.''
   Gress said he then saw a police car pull up to the corner, and
the gunman started shooting at the cruiser.
   He went to telephone police and when he returned to the window,
the gunman was lying on the ground and the police officer also lay
wounded on the ground.
   The police officer, who works for the Orange Police Department,
was not seriously injured, Spina said. He was admitted in stable
condition at Orange Memorial Hospital, said spokeswoman Gail Proctor.
   The officer was on a routine patrol of the neighborhood, which
lies on the border of West Orange and the city of Orange, when he
heard the gunshots and went to the scene, Spina said.
   Palardy said the identity of the officer was not immediately
available.
   Proctor first started shooting at a woman in a first floor
apartment, and police believe the gun misfired, allowing the woman
time to run into the bathroom.
   The gunman then shot a child in the apartment and went outside,
where he shot two more children, Spina said.The police officer hit
the gunman with four rounds, officials said.
   Residents of the neighborhood said crime there has worsened
recently, with older people forced to live in fear of drug-related
violence.
   ``The young teen-agers are jumping people all the time,'' said
Deidra Biggest, a 25-year-old resident who has lived in the area for
eight months. ``Houses are getting robbed and cars are getting
stolen.''
   ``It's getting worse all the time,'' said Michael Gorham, 26, who
has lived in the area for six months. ``It's crazy out there.''

   Boating accidents Saturday left two boys missing and presumed
drowned in Providence, R.I., and another critically injured near
Miami, authorities said.
   In Providence, police saw two youths jump into the water from a
boat in Mashapaug Pond and try to swim to shore just as a
thunderstorm began pelting the area with rain, according to a police
spokesman, Lt. Paul Verrechia.
   A bystander jumped into the water and began swimming toward one
of the youths and was joined by a police officer, but the boy went
beneath the surface before the men could reach him, Verricchia said.
   The other boy, who was about 25 yards beyond the first, went
beneath the water as a uniformed officer and an off-duty police
officer climbed aboard the youths' boat and paddled towards him, the
spokesman said.
   Divers called off the search after four hours, but were expected
to resume Sunday morning, Verrechia said. No one had reported the
boys missing and their identities were not known, he said.
   In Florida, a boy suffered multiple cuts to his head and chest
after he fell off a jet ski and was run over by a boat driven by
teen-agers in the Intracoastal Waterway, authorities said.
   Ami Missika, 5, was hit at about 3:30 p.m. EST after he fell into
the water in north Dade County, authorities said.
   The child, who was airlifted to Jackson Memorial Hospital,
underwent surgery ``well into the night'' and was in critical
condition, said Mark Santo, a hospital spokesman.
   ``He had lacerations to the head and the body from the
propeller,'' Santo said.
   The boat left the scene of the accident but returned later, said
Capt. Mike Lamphear of the Florida Marine Patrol. The teen-agers,
ranging from 13 to 15 years old, were taken into custody for
questioning, he said.

<TEXT>
   An armed man who police say had been
hospitalized recently for depression was holding his girlfriend, her
sister and the girlfriend's 4-year-old daughter hostage late
Saturday.
   Heavily armed police remained in position around a one-story home
where Douglas ``Dougie'' Thomas, 20, was holding the three hostages.
   A fourth hostage, the 2{-month-old daughter of Thomas and his
girlfriend, was released in the morning, pushed out of the house
wrapped in a quilt, police said.
   Police blocked off streets leading to the house and evacuated
about 32 families about five hours after receiving the first reports
of the disturbance late Friday.
   Thomas was reportedly armed with a handgun and threatened to kill
himself and the hostages. Twice during the day he fired shots inside
the house, but he allowed the hostages to talk to police each time
to show they had not been harmed, police said.
   ``We're just going to wait,'' said Police Chief Mike Walton.
``Right now, everything is under control.''
   Police spokesman Neil Williamson said Thomas had made no specific
demands but he repeatedly asked to talk to friends and relatives by
telephone.
   ``He seems like he's almost hallucinating,'' said police
spokesman Neil Williamson. He said Thomas was hospitalized recently
for depression and apparently had been taking medication that might
affect his mood.
   James Kerr, a friend who talked to Thomas by telephone during the
afternoon, described him as ``paranoid and insecure.''
   Although Williamson refused to identify him, relatives, friends
and other police sources confirmed Thomas' identity, according to
the Springfield State Journal-Register.
   Thomas spent a year in prison for aggravated battery for shooting
two men at a dance in 1985, the newspaper reported.
   Police also did not identify the hostages. However, others said
they were Karen Lambert, 20, Thomas's girlfriend; Nikki Lambert, 14;
and Katrina Lambert, 4.

   Police stormed a townhouse early today
and freed two children who had been held hostage for more than a day
by a blind prison escapee and an accomplice. One of the two captors
was shot dead in the attack, police said.
   A special weapons and tactics team rescued Dominic Platt, 8, and
his 6-year-old sister, Cameo, unharmed around 1:30 a.m. this
morning, police Capt. Bruce Erickson said. They had been held since
Friday afternoon.
   Police threw a stun grenade into the house when one of the
children came out to pick up drinks the authorities had arranged to
deliver, Capt. Terry Cook said.
   Police shot one of the captors when he grabbed the girl at
knifepoint, Cook said. Police would not immediately identify whether
inmate Larry Hill or his accomplice, Willie Johnson, had been
killed, pending notification of relatives.
   The other captor was taken into custody, police said.
   ``Basically, they said they had to be allowed to leave. If they
didn't, they were going to throw a dead child out,'' Cook said.
   The children's grandmother, Joan Platt, had pleaded to the gunmen
on television Saturday night. ``Please Larry, please let them go,''
she said. ``Stop and think. They are very innocent.''
   Earlier Saturday, police seized the children's mother, Lois
Platt, when she left the house at 10:30 a.m. to start a car in what
police described as an escape attempt by the two men.
   Platt was taken to a hospital for treatment of exhaustion and
stress.
   Police Chief Lloyd Rivers said he did not know whether Platt's
role in the incident was willing or unwilling, but said she offered
no resistance when officers prevented her from going back into the
building because of concern over her children.
   ``We just plain stopped her. We didn't let her back inside,''
Cook said. ``It was a decision we had to make. We could not allow
her back in when we had a hostage out.''
   Platt had corresponded with Hill in prison, but her
sister-in-law, Peggy Platt, said she broke off the relationship more
than 18 months ago when she discovered Hill was a convicted murderer.
   Police had negotiated with the men throughout the day as SWAT
officers ringed the building.
   Hill, a blind inmate at Stillwater State Prison outside
Minneapolis, escaped from a medical office Friday morning while he
was being escorted by two guards to an appointment for a replacement
glass eye.
   Hill had been met at the office by Johnson, who had a handgun,
officers said. The two men disarmed the guards, tied one of them up
and fled, police said.
   Hill, 49, was convicted of second-degree murder for strangling
his girlfriend in 1982 and was serving his fifth prison stint, said
Tom Dowdle, associate warden at the Stillwater prison. He has other
convictions for two counts of rape, as well as robbery, criminal
sexual assault, burglary and illegal handgun possession.
   Police have identified his accomplice as a former Stillwater
inmate, Capt. Carl Johnson said. ``I'm sure it was all
prearranged,'' he said.

   Security forces shot to death a
news photographer and wounded his colleague at a checkpoint near
Ilopango Air Force Base on the eve of El Salvador's presidential
election, officials said Sunday.
   Both men were Salvadoran free-lance photographers who worked
regularly for the Reuters news agency. Representatives of the agency
in San Salvador declined to comment. Armed Forces officials were not
immediately available for comment.
   Justice of the Peace Manuel Jesus de Aguilar said troops who
brought in the body of Roberto Navas, 28, said the shooting occurred
when the two men's motorcycle failed to stop at an air force
checkpoint late Saturday night.
   The magistrate said soldiers radioed the next checkpoint and that
troops there shot the two men when they again refused to stop.
   The armed forces have been on full alert since Tuesday when
leftist guerrillas stepped up their campaign to disrupt Sunday's
election.
   Navas was shot twice, in the back and the side. The judge said he
found at least 22 spent rounds at the scene.
   Luis Galdamez, 34, was shot once in the back and underwent
emergency surgery at Hospital Rosales in San Salvador.
   Dr. Marcelino Caballero told The Associated Press the bullet
entered Galdamez's back and exited through his upper right arm,
injuring a lung. The doctor described the injuries as serious.
   Colleagues said Navas lived near the base, one of the most
strategic military installations in the country, and was on his way
home from work.
   Ilopango is five miles from the capital. The shooting occurred on
the PanAmerican Highway, which runs past the base.
   A nurse at the hospital who asked not to be named told The
Associated Press that an air force ambulance brought Galdamez to the
hospital.

   Soldiers and leftist guerrillas
fought near a power station on the outskirts of the capital early
Sunday, several hours before voting began in the presidential
election.
   Elsewhere, soldiers shot three local journalists at military
checkpoints, killing two of them, officials said.
   Troops from the 1st Infantry Brigade and guerrillas battled near
the power substation in San Ramon, radio reports said. The sounds of
the pre-dawn battle could be heard in downtown San Salvador.
Afterward, military helicopters circled overhead, occasionally
firing rockets at rebel positions.
   No casualty report was immediately available, and it was not
known whether the battle would affect voting in that area.
   The rebels have knocked out much of the electrical power in the
capital and threatened to attack people who drive on the nation's
highways in a bid to disrupt the election, which they are boycotting.
   The Christian Democrat Party of President Jose Napoleon Duarte is
trying to retain power in the election with candidate Fidel Chavez
Mena, a former foreign minister who says he represents new
leadership and dismisses charges of corruption and incompetence.
Duarte by law cannot run for re-election.
   The front-runner, according to the polls, is businessman Alfredo
Cristiani, leader of the rightist and free market Republican
Nationalist Alliance, or Arena. That party, which in the past has
been linked to rightist death squads, already holds a slim edge in
the Salvadoran congress.
   Soldiers reportedly shot and killed a soundman from a local
television crew early Sunday morning in eastern El Salvador.
   Preliminary reports indicated that Mauricio Pineda, 24, died when
soldiers opened fire on the crew's vehicle at a checkpoint near La
Union, acccording to a newsman at Channel 12, William Figueroa.
   The crew was traveling from Morazan province to the coastal city
of La Union, 115 miles from the capital, Figueroa said in a
telephone interview.
   Late Saturday night, soldiers shot to death a news photographer
and wounded his colleague at a checkpoint near Ilopango Air Force
Base, officials said.
   Both men were Salvadoran free-lance photographers who worked
regularly for the Reuters news agency. The agency's San Salvador
office declined to comment.
   Armed forces officials were not immediately available to comment
on either shooting incident.
   Justice of the Peace Manuel de Jesus Aguilar said troops who

<TEXT>
   Thousands of supporters of maverick communist Boris
N. Yeltsin marched through downtown Moscow Sunday and vowed to hold
a general strike if he does not win election next week to the new
national parliament.
   Yeltsin, who was ousted as Moscow party boss after criticizing
the pace of President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's reforms, claims the
Moscow party machine is working to defeat him. For many Soviets,
Yeltsin epitomizes the quest for more democracy and an end to
special privilege for the government and party elite.
   Chanting ``Yeltsin! Yeltsin!'' at least 3,000 Muscovites set off
from Gorky Park after they were refused permission to hold a
pro-Yeltsin election rally there. They marched to Moscow City Hall
after scores of uniformed police sealed off Kalinin Prospekt leading
to the Kremlin.
   At city hall, the protesters demanded a meeting with Lev N.
Zaikov, the official who replaced Yeltsin as the Soviet capital's
Communist Party boss in November 1987, and who is in charge of the
Moscow party machine they claim is trying to engineer Yeltsin's
defeat.
   A city official armed with a bullhorn clambered on top of a bus
to demand that the crowd disperse, but it remained in front of the
municipal building for more than two hours.
   One pro-Yeltsin speaker perched beside the city hall door called
on the crowd to approve a general strike if Yeltsin does not win the
right to represent Moscow in the March 26 elections for the Congerss
of People's Deputies, and the protesters raised their hands in
agreement. It was not immediately clear when the strike would take
place.
   Earlier this month, the Communist Party released a transcript of
Yeltsin's remarks at a private Central Committee meeting in 1987
that cost him his job as Moscow party boss.
   The transcript said Yeltsin told the gathering that Gorbachev had
become the object of ``intolerable'' glorification. Yeltsin was
named Moscow party chief in December 1985 and a non-voting Politburo
member two months later. He lost both posts as a result of his
remarks at the Oct. 21, 1987 meeting.
   The party said it was publishing a transcript of the meeting in
its new monthly journal, News of the Communist Party Central
Committee, because of requests by workers and party members.
   But a U.S. specialist said the release of 40 pages of scathing
attacks on Yeltsin by Gorbachev and other leaders appeared designed
to hurt the 58-year- old Yeltsin in his bid for political office.
   The transcript showed Yeltsin criticized not only Gorbachev, who
brought him into the Kremlin leadership, but Yegor K. Ligachev, a
conservative force on the ruling Politburo.

   George Bush still talks about wanting to build
a ``kinder-gentler'' nation, but many of the groups keeping an eye
on the new president are taking a wait-and-see attitude on whether
he translates words into results.
   The president has made several strides to demonstrate his
commitment to a government that is more compassionate to those in
need, and more attuned to such issues as the environment, minority
concerns and women.
   He often describes that aspect of his administration by reviving
a phrase he used in the campaign when he pledged to make a
``kinder-gentler'' nation.
   In that vein, Bush last week submitted to Capitol Hill his
legislative proposal for child care _ a plan that would give a tax
credit or refund of up to $1,000 per child to low-income people.
   He also proposed a 29 percent increase in spending for the
homeless, to $645 million next year. He recently spoke about how he
was disturbed by the sight of homeless people huddled on the grounds
near the White House.
   And Bush tempered his opposition to federal gun control and
bucked the displeasure of his fellow National Rifle Association
members by halting the imports of semiautomatic assault guns until
their usage can be reviewed.
   These and other actions give Bush a boost simply by comparison
with his predecessor, Ronald Reagan, whose record was considered
distinctly not kinder or gentler by such groups as women, minorities
and environmentalists.
   But these groups are reserving judgment. Some are waiting for
more dramatic leadership, and others, including the
environmentalists are waiting to see the fine print that goes with
his positive sounding rhetoric on such issues as acid rain.
   ``He deserves an A for a new tone,'' said the Rev. Jesse Jackson,
the two-time democratic presidential candidate who has developed a
friendly relationship with Bush and who has visited with the
president at the White House.
   He said the access Bush has given to people who felt locked out
of the Reagan White House has been ``very positive.''
   Bush has set ``the right tone but not enough boldness in a right
direction,'' Jackson contended. ``Now the question comes to a test
of leadership. It must be bold, it must take a direction that will
remedy fundamental problems.''
   Heather Booth, president of the liberal lobbying organization
Citizen Action, said Bush's ``rhetoric is wonderful'' and that some
of his actions have been what she called a welcome break from the
Reagan years.
   ``I am giving him credit for understanding there's a new
progressive opening,'' in the country, she said, but added, ``I
haven't seen a substantive set of proposals that are convincing in
being able to rise to the challenges.''
   Some complain that Bush, or those around him, often as not have
undermined some of the very kinder-gentler signals he has sent.
   Some examples:
   _Bush cheered environmentalists when he indefinitely postponed
offshore oil leasing key environmental tracts off California and
Florida. But environmentalists were dismayed that he failed one of
their highest priority litmus tests when his Interior Secretary
Manuel Lujan announced the administration will allow oil exploration
in the Alaska National Wildlife Refuge.
   _Bush called for banning of ozone-depleting chloroflourocarbons
by the end of this century, but that was a position that was already
advocated by many other nations, and the United States was seen as
``playing catchup,'' said Tom Stoel, senior attorney for the Natural
Resources Defense Council.
   ``It wasn't so much that Bush was anti-environmental as that he
didn't have his act together,'' he said. ``He indicated he was going
to be an environmental leader and so far there's been very little
environmental leadership shown.''
   _Bush proposed an increase in the minimum wage to $4.25, but
coupled it with a lower so-called training wage for first-time
workers. And he angered labor activists by refusing to intervene in
the Eastern Airlines strike.
   _Bush cast a well-publicized and wide net to draw more women into
his administration. He named two women to his Cabinet, Labor
Secretary Elizabeth Dole and U.S. Trade Representative Carla Hills.
But he has disappointed feminists by lunching at a private all-male
club and joining in the merriment at the annual men-only Alfalfa
Club dinner.
   _Bush made a strong pitch throughout the pre-inaugural period and
in the first two weeks of his presidency for the highest ethical
standards in the people he appointed to his administration. That
message was somewhat diluted when Secretary of State James Baker III
and White House Counsel C. Boyden Gray both voluntarily disentangled
themselves from financial affairs that became the subject of news
stories. Neither was engaged in illegality, but said they did not
want to permit any appearance of impropriety.
   Administration spokesman insist the kinder-gentler concept is not
on the back burner even though it often is overshadowed by
day-to-day events.
   ``We look for opportunities for getting out any of the messages
he's trying to get across,'' said White House communications
Director David Demarest. ``We'll see more kinder-gentler. We'll see
more of the entirety of the program.''
   For her part, first lady Barbara Bush has had no trouble making a
kinder-gentler image a big part of her White House life.
   Her first public event outside the White House was a visit to a
daycare center for homeless children. In addition to her longtime
promotion of literacy efforts, she has visited soup kitchens,
nursing homes, and a schoolchildren's celebration of black history
month.
   Mrs. Bush also has set up a foundation to raise money for
literacy programs.

<HEAD>Spring is Here: The Weather is Changing, So Are The People</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RANDOLPH E. SCHMID</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The long, dreary wait for the end of winter is
nearing its end as nature gradually edges into change. Human
patience, also nearing its limits with winter, can draw
encouragement from the spring equinox Monday.
   While the change of seasons is a gradual, often fitful thing,
calendars usually list the solstices and equinoxes as unofficial
markers of these transitions.
   ``The first day of spring is one thing, and the first spring day
is another,'' observed the late Henry Van Dyke, aware that March
weather can be fickle and also that the change of seasons can occur
at markedly different dates in different parts of the nation.
   Even so, millions will welcome spring at 10:28 a.m. EST, the
moment of the vernal equinox, when the sun crosses the equator on
its apparent journey northward, according to astronomers at the U.S.
Naval Observatory in Washington.
   This, and the autumnal equinox in September, are the only two
dates on which the sun rises directly in the east and sets precisely
in the west, the Observatory reports.
   These directions were used to align the Great Pyramids in Egypt
with an error equivalent to the thickness of a piece of string seen
at a distance of six feet, said observatory spokeswoman Gail Cleere.
Ancient graves in Ireland and temples in Guatemala are also aligned
to the equinoxes, she said.
   For the human mind, too, the change may be a point of alignment.
   ``Spring is a transition season when things change very
rapidly,'' observed the late Helmut Landsberg, professor emeritus of
meteorology at the University of Maryland.
   ``One major thing is apparently the change in light ... the most
rapid increase in light intensity occurs between February and
April,'' Landsberg explained, and this seems to affect human glands
and internal reactions.
   Other fluctuations causing humans to react include ``rapid
temperature changes in many places, sometimes highly irregular,
changing from low to high to high to low again,'' said Landsberg,
who researched the biological effects of weather.
   Poets and philosophers have lauded spring over the centuries with
a curious mixture of cheer and woe, reflecting the differing
reactions of humans to the stress of changing weather.
   As Mark Twain observed of New England's weather, ``it gets
through more business in spring than in any other season. I have
counted 136 different kinds of weather inside of 24 hours.''
   This places stress on the body and, scientists are beginning to
believe, the mind also.
   Human responses vary. Malaise, romance and even depression are
among the reactions to these seasonal changes _ although so-called
spring fever has been most widely identified with that vague feeling
of disinterest, mind-wandering and restlessness.
   Nature writer Hal Borland reflected on the seasonal change in the
book ``Twelve Moons of the Year:''
   ``There is something in a mild March day that can touch a man to
the very quick of his being. Just what it is cannot readily be
stated, but it must be compounded of sunlight and air and warmth and
an immeasurable mystery that is partly summed up by the word
`promise.' ''
   ``When the first warm days of spring come, we all feel a desire
to escape, to run away. It becomes difficult to concentrate on
serious matters, and we experience indefinable, vague yearnings that
disturb our psychic balance and have a bad influence on our
professional activities,'' wrote Dr. Michel Gauquelin, a French
psychologist, in his book ``How Atmospheric Conditions Affect Your
Health.''
   ``Spring is a period when new romances start, when fresh plans
are made ... But it is also a season when people experience frequent
changes of mood and have bitter arguments with one another,''
Gauquelin wrote.
   His volume attributes people's response to ``spring hormonal
crisis,'' when the endocrine glands are more active and sexual
interest heightened.
   Whether the changes are the result of hormones, sunlight or other
factors, nearly everyone observes and reacts to them.
   German studies in the 1960s found that most illegitimate
conceptions tended to occur in May which, the researchers suggested,
``seems to indicate that spring may well be the season for all forms
of impulsive behavior.''
   On the darker side, French sociologist Emile Durkheim noted a
half-century ago that suicides increase in the spring.
   The U.S. Centers for Disease Control studied the nation's suicide
rates between 1969 and 1978 and found that during that decade ``the
suicide pattern was distinctly seasonal, above average all spring
and below average all winter.''

<HEAD>Mubarak Raises Egyptian Flag Over Taba</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CAIRO, Egypt (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Hosni Mubarak called for world
peace Sunday in a ceremony in which he raised the Egyptian flag over
Taba, the disputed border area that Israel withdrew from last week.
   Mubarak was on a European tour when the last Israeli policeman
left the 250-acre strip of beach overlooking the Gulf of Aqaba last
Wednesday.
   In a 20-minute televised ceremony, Mubarak personally raised the
black, red and white Egyptian flag.
   ``World peace will never be an impossible aim. It is the noble
aim which can be reached,'' Mubarak said. ``Leaders of the
superpowers know this and have been moving toward peace.''
   Before flying to Taba, Mubarak laid a wreath at the tomb of
President Anwar Sadat, who was assassinated by Moslem extremists in
1981. It was Sadat who signed a peace treaty with Israel in 1979.
   Israel retained control of Taba when it pulled out of the rest of
the Sinai in 1982 under the Egyptian-Israeli peace treaty.
   An international arbitration panel awarded Taba to Egypt in
September, and in February, Egypt and Israel signed agreements that
included $37 million in compensation for Taba's main hotel.

   A small car with 10 youths jammed inside
fell into the Seine River early Sunday in the town of St. Mammes,
and five of the passengers drowned, police said.
   The automobile, a four-seated Fiat, was being driven down a
riverside street at about 4 a.m. in the town 45 miles southeast of
Paris when it went into the river, police said. The 22-year-old
driver and four of the passengers were able to pull themselves out
of the water, but the others drowned.
   Three bodies were found trapped in the car, and divers found two
more in the river. Police said the victims lived nearby and ranged
in age from 14 to 17, but did not immediately identify them or the
driver by name.

<TEXT>
   Here at a glance are some facts,
figures and issues related to Sunday's presidential election:
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   THE INCUMBENT _ President Jose Napoleon Duarte, who suffers from
terminal liver cancer, was elected in 1984 and cannot by law succeed
himself. He steps down June 1; his successor will serve a five-year
term.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   THE CONTENDERS _ Seven candidates were running, including: Fidel
Chavez Mena of the centrist Christian Democrats; Alfredo Cristiani
of the rightist Republican Nationalist Alliance, or Arena; Guillermo
Ungo of the leftist Democratic Convergence. Four minor party
candidates were not expected to be significant factors. If no
candidate wins a majority, a runoff election will be held in April.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   THE ISSUES _ The main issues were ending a nine-year civil war
that has cost 70,000 lives, and restarting a stagnant economy that
suffers high unemployment and is heavily dependent on U.S. aid.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   THE BOYCOTT _ The rebel Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front
called for an election boycott, saying political solutions are
impossible without participation by the rebels and the social and
political forces they represent.
   The guerrillas paralyzed most highway traffic, sabotaged
electricity, telephones and water, and called on election workers to
quit. But they said they would not retaliate against those who
wished to vote in defiance of the boycott.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   THE VOTERS _ About 1.8 million Salvadorans are registered; the
nation's population is more than 5 million. Voting began at 7 a.m.
and ended by 5 p.m. There are 260 municipalities, but 24 were
controlled by the rebels and no voting was scheduled.

<TEXT>
   Soviet leaders warned last year that their
definition of democracy might be a bit different from the Western
one.
   So far, they're right.
   As the Soviet Union lurches toward its first multicandidate
elections, it is clear that President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's reforms
have brought amazing latitude in public debate to a country that
punished unorthodox ideas with harsh prison terms just a few years
ago.
   Now, even the evils of democracy are taking seed in this changing
landscape.
   Political neophytes are battling entrenched Communist Party
officials using classic tactics of election rigging: They pack
caucus halls with hand-picked voters, bar electors from holding
nomination meetings by denying them a hall, or simply toss
candidates off the ballot.
   Traditional authoritarianism is entangled with the new freedoms.
Two weeks ago, Ukrainian activists were detained for distributing
dangerous literature _ which turned out to be copies of the election
law.
   At meetings during the campaign for the new Congress of People's
Deputies, passions run wild. Across the country, tens of thousands
of people are seizing microphones and the opportunity to speak out
on everything from human rights to snow removal.
   On Sunday, at least 3,000 people marched in Moscow to back Boris
Yeltsin, an independent candidate. One recent caucus debate ran 13
hours, yet only 13 of 888 people had left by 3 a.m., said Moscow
election official Igor Orlov.
   Despite the publicity over the multicandidate elections, one in
four districts has only one name on the ballot. Many of the
unopposed candidates are local Communist Party chiefs.
   ``It's just the same as 10 years ago, in the Brezhnev era: one
candidate for each district, and each one a power in the party,''
complains Andrei Deravyankin, an independent Democratic Union member
from the Volga River town of Saratov.
   Still, new ideas are holding sway. Newspapers have exposed
hundreds of cases of ``non-democratic'' behavior. Citizens have
flooded the national commission overseeing the elections with more
than 77,000 complaints. And reformers are discovering political
tricks of their own.
   ``There are dozens of violations of the letter of the law,''
acknowledged election commission deputy Dmitri B. Golovko at a
recent news conference. The law itself will be revised, he promised.
   At this point, it seems possible that the same men who run the
country on the 12-member Communist Party Politburo could wind up
controlling the key legislative committees in the new parliament.
   But it also seems possible the congress will be full of new faces
determined to make the Soviet government responsive to the public.
   The candidates include former political prisoners; Stalin
historian and party outcast Roy Medvedev; reform economist Oleg
Bogomolov, who disclosed the Soviet Union's huge deficit; Estonian
Popular Front leader Marju Lauristen; environmental activists; and
the patriarch of the Russian Orthodox Church, according to a Western
diplomat tracking the election.
   Yeltsin, the pugnacious former Moscow Communist chief who was
demoted in November 1987 after stepping on toes with an
anti-corruption campaign, is running for the Moscow seat against
organized party opposition.
   As always, though, the Communist Party dominates. Moscow News
found 82 percent of the candidates are party members.
   The law itself is partly to blame for the manipulation, some
people complain.
   Since a third of the deputies are being elected by certain public
organizations, a Communist Party member who also belongs to the
Union of Writers and the Soviet Peace Committee can participate in
all three of those elections and vote in his residential district as
well.
   Election caucuses can legally slash the number of candidates, and
they have often rejected reformers. Nuclear physicist and human
rights activist Andrei D. Sakharov, for example, was nominated by 60
research institutes, but the Soviet Academy of Sciences Presidium
rejected him in favor of a slate of old guard managers.
   In many of the public organizations, there is even less choice,
because leaders bar rank-and-file members from voting.
   The Communist Party itself set the tone when it took 31,000 names
and boiled them down to 100 candidates _ for 100 seats.
   Moreover, even if reformers manage to win a place in the
2,250-seat Congress of People's Deputies in March 26 voting, they
still may not wield much power.
   No official date has been announced for the body's first session.
But the law calls for it to meet just one day a year _ to elect the
real, working parliament with fewer than 500 members.
   A Communist Party majority in the congress could easily elect
only its own members to the real positions of legislative power.

<HEAD>House To Consider Legislation On Minimum Wage, Protecting Whistleblowers</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DIANE DUSTON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Congress is making one of its slowest starts in
recent memory as it heads toward April with little accomplished but
a series of bruising internal battles.
   The Senate will be on a two-week Easter break starting Monday,
but before leaving Friday it confirmed Rep. Dick Cheney as defense
secretary.
   The non-controversial ratification was a breeze after the bitter
struggle over President Bush's first choice for the job, former Sen.
John Tower. The rejection of Tower by a 53-47 vote, largely along
party lines, handed Bush a major defeat and absorbed the Senate for
nearly two months.
   The House, which doesn't start its Easter break until Friday,
faces floor votes this week on raising the minimum wage and
legislation protecting whistleblowers _ government workers who
report corruption within their own agencies.
   House members also may this week get a report from the Ethics
Committee on Speaker Jim Wright. The 12-member committee, which
undertook the inquiry into the Texas Democrat's financial dealings
nine months ago, began deliberating last week on whether Wright
broke House rules.
   Their investigation coupled with the ill-fated fight to raise
congressional pay, and now a search among Republican members for a
minority whip, have sidetracked House action on any major
legislation so far this session.
   House Republicans are expected to choose Wednesday between two
candidates vying for the number two leadership post. Reps. Edward
Madigan of Illinois and Newt Gingrich of Georgia are competing to
succeed Cheney of Wyoming, who resigned last week after being
confirmed as defense secretary.
   Gingrich is the leader of an activist conservative wing of the
party while Madigan, currently the deputy whip, is regarded as a
pragmatist who would probably be more willing to work with the
Democrats to win support for Bush's programs.
   The House is scheduled to vote Tuesday on a bill to expand the
rights of federal employees who blow the whistle on fraud.
   The measure sailed through the Senate last Thursday, 97-0, and
Bush has promised to sign it after the House completes its work.
Similar legislation was the subject of one of President Reagan's
most controversial vetoes.
   The legislation would lower the burden of proof for
whistleblowers who claim they have been punished by their employers
for disclosing misdeeds within their agencies, and increase the
burden of proof for the federal agencies defending their decisions.
   House floor debate over the minimum wage is expected to begin
Wednesday, with Democrats seeking an increase from $3.35 to $4.65 by
1992. Republicans are supporting the Bush proposal that minimum
wages raise only to $4.25 by 1992, with a provision that employers
be allowed to pay new workers $3.35 for the first six months.
   The minimum wage has not increased since 1981.
   Budget negotiators from both the House and Senate are to exchange
offers this week, with Democrats expected to push for military cuts
equal to domestic spending cuts in the fiscal 1990 budget.
   Rep. Leon Panetta, D-Calif., chairman of the House Budget
Committee, said he and Senate Budget Committee Chairman Jim Sasser,
D-Tenn., planned to work together in drafting a Democratic budget
proposal. In addition to the balance between domestic and military
spending cuts, Panetta said he wants new revenues to equal the
overall spending cuts.
   Also this week, the House banking subcommittee will hold the last
of more than three dozen congressional hearings on the savings and
loan crisis, listening a final time to White House budget director
Richard Darman and Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan before
writing a $100 billion bailout plan.
   Banking committees in both houses, using Bush's proposal as the
foundation but possibly altering many of its key provisions, plan to
put the actual bailout package together the first week Congress is
back in session after Easter.

   Here is a look at El Salvador, a
nation nestled in the soft Pacific curve of Central America, a land
with a history of violence that is named for Jesus:
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   GEOGRAPHY _ The country covers 8,260 square miles, about the size
of Massachusetts. It is rugged, a land of volcanoes and lakes and
rich soil. It is about 950 miles southwest of Miami, 950 miles
southeast of Brownsville, Texas.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   POPULATION _ Its more than 5 million people are mainly Roman
Catholic and mestizo _ people of both Indian and Spanish heritage.
More than 500,000 of its residents have fled its 9-year-old civil
war, most of them to the United States.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   HISTORY _ It was conquered in 1525 by the Spanish. It became
independent on Sept. 15, 1821 and joined the Central American
Federation, which later split into the nations that now make up
Central America.
   It was ruled for most of this century by a land-owning oligarchy
in alliance with the military.
   In 1932 a peasant rebellion organized by Farabundo Marti was
crushed by a military regime that killed 30,000 people; the leader
of that rebellion inspired the present guerrillas, the Farabundo
Marti National Liberation Front.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   ECONOMY _ It is mostly agricultural, with coffee the main cash
crop. In the 1960s and 1970s it became a manufacturing center for
the Central American market. Its largest input is U.S. military and
civil aid, which comes to $1.5 million a day.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   THE WAR _ The conflict began in 1979 when a group of young
officers overthrew former president Gen. Carlos Humberto Romero. A
junta tried to impose agrarian and social reforms, but dissatisfied
leftists began a rebellion in late 1979.
   The conflict has led to more than 70,000 deaths, most of them
civilian, and many suspected leftists killed by right-wing death
squads in the early 1980s.
   In 1984, Jose Napoleon Duarte, a Christian Democrat, became the
first popularly elected president in 50 years. Sunday's election
marks the first time Salvadorans have had a chance to replace an
incumbent civilian government with a different party.

   A major government advisory conference convened
Sunday with speakers urging unity in solving China's growing
economic problems, setting the tone for a legislative session that
opens Monday.
   The brief and businesslike opening session of the 2,081-member
Chinese People's Political Consulative Conference emphasized working
together under the leadership of the ruling Communist Party.
   The somber theme was in sharp contrast to the conference's last
full meeting in April 1988, which saw unprecedented lively debate
and calls for democracy.
   Since then, however, overheated economic growth has produced
chronic shortages, widespread corruption and annual inflation of 36
percent, causing a slowdown in both economic and political reforms.
   Conference Chairman Li Xiannian urged the delegates to share the
government's concerns, offer their suggestions and dedicate
themselves to finding solutions.
   Vice Chairman Qian Weichang, who delivered a 13-page work report,
called on the delegates to ``be ceaselessly diligent'' in pushing
forward the government's economic policies.
   The speeches were greeted with only perfunctory applause by the
delegates who attended the 80-minute session in the Great Hall of
the People in central Beijing.
   The conference draws delegates from among scientists, scholars,
writers and official organizations.
   Its annual plenary session, scheduled to last 10 days, is always
timed to coincide with the annual meeting of the National People's
Congress, China's legislature. The congress begins its 16-day
session Monday.
   Officials reportedly have attempted to discourage unwelcome
debate and criticism of government policies at both meetings this
year because of concern that the economic problems could trigger
social instability.
   Conference official Cheng Siyuan reported that delegates have
made more than 2,000 suggestions to the government since their last
full meeting, and that more than a quarter of these have been
adopted. But he gave no details about the nature of the suggestions.
   He said delegates have been briefed from time to time by
officials on government policy and helped carry it out, especially
by joining in efforts to police prices and cut back on wasteful
construction projects.
   The speakers' clear message was that China's increasingly restive
intellectuals can best serve the country by using their talents to
implement party decisions rather than questioning or criticizing
them.
   The opening session was attended by senior party and government
leaders, including General Secretary Zhao Ziyang, Premier Li Peng
and President Yang Shangkun.

   The political wounds of a 10-year-old
sexual assault allegation have been reopened for Mayor Dana Rinehart
with a city council probe and filing of a lawsuit that could mean
the end of his hopes of running for governor.
   Rinehart was Franklin County treasurer, a rising star in the
local Republican Party in 1978, when his children's 13-year-old baby
sitter accused him of sexually assaulting her while she slept on a
couch in Rinehart's home. He has denied the allegation and a grand
jury failed to indict him.
   But a newspaper story last fall resulted in the council
investigation and one by the police department into whether a police
officer spied on the girl's family in 1983 in an attempt to
discredit her and gain a police endorsement for Rinehart, who was
running for mayor.
   Rinehart didn't get the endorsement, but he won the election. He
is now serving his second four-year term as mayor of Ohio's capital
city.
   Rinehart, 43, said he does not know how the resurrection of what
has become known locally as ``the baby sitter incident'' will affect
his political future, which he at one time had hoped would be spent
in the governor's office.
   Once-plentiful rumors that Rinehart planned to run for governor
in 1990 have died down since the investigations, despite an Ohio
State University poll in January that showed he had a 78 percent
approval rating in the city of approximately 600,000. It was his
highest rating ever.
   ``Part of me would love to (be governor), but part of me says no.
I've had a taste of politics that has not been good. The jury is
still out in my heart and in my head,'' he said.
   The former baby sitter, Vicki Rae Pardue, now 23, said she hopes
Rinehart's political future is indeed wounded.
   ``I don't think Rinehart has any business being anywhere in
politics, which includes governor,'' she said at a news conference
on Wednesday.
   On Thursday _ two weeks after the council hearings _ Ms. Pardue's
stepmother, Linda Pardue, filed suit in U.S. District Court against
Rinehart and the police officer accused of spying, contending they
engaged in a political conspiracy against the family.
   In 1978, Ms. Pardue told police that she was asleep on Rinehart's
couch when she awoke to find him performing oral sex on her. She
contended he then kissed her on the mouth, said he would be back
later and walked out of the room.
   Ms. Pardue later passed a police-administered polygraph test.
Rinehart, who was advised by his lawyer not to submit to a police
test, said he passed a privately administered polygraph test.
   For 10 years, questions have surrounded the propriety of a
Franklin County grand jury hearing into Ms. Pardue's allegations.
Rinehart was allowed to testify before the grand jury _ an
opportunity that is only rarely afforded the accused in Ohio.
   Also permitted to testify on Rinehart's behalf was a psychiatric
expert who told the jury that, although he had not interviewed Ms.
Pardue, she may have dreamed the incident and believed it had
actually happened.
   The grand jury declined to indict Rinehart.
   The ``baby sitter incident'' resurfaced last October when The
Plain Dealer in Cleveland reported that police officer John Morgan,
a devoted Rinehart supporter, had conducted secret, politically
motivated surveillance on the Pardue family for two months in 1983.
   After Rinehart was elected, Morgan was promoted from the police
force to deputy city safety director and then deputy city
development director. He was fired after he refused to cooperate in
a police investigation a few days after the Plain Dealer story.
   Rinehart says he knew nothing about Morgan's investigation or the
officer's 13-page report of his findings until the newspaper queried
Morgan about it Oct. 7. He plays down the controversy surrounding
Morgan's activities.
   ``We've had city employees who, unfortunately, have done things
that are out of line. We've had worse stuff than this. We had a
police officer who robbed banks,'' Rinehart said.
   The internal police investigation of Morgan, which ended in
November, found no criminal activity, although police said their
investigation was hampered by the fact that Morgan refused to be
interviewed.
   The findings of a council investigation _ which concluded March 2
after three days of testimony from Rinehart, Morgan and others _
will be known next month.
   Testimony at the hearings raised questions about whether Rinehart
knew of the report and who in the police department and his campaign
may have authorized the surveillance.
   Morgan, who testified under a grant of immunity, said he
conducted the surveillance with neither the knowledge nor permission
of his superiors, Rinehart, or any member of the Rinehart campaign.
   ``I didn't feel they had a need to know,'' Morgan said.
   He testified that he researched the Pardue family's geneological
history, recorded license numbers of mourners at the funeral of Miss
Pardue's father in 1983, and obtained information on the family's
banking records without obtaining a subpoena _ an order required
under federal bank right-to-privacy laws. Morgan said he conducted
the investigation on city time and used city equipment.
   Rinehart's testimony that he didn't know about Morgan's report
until last fall was contradicted by testimony from two local
reporters, who told the City Council they had confronted Rinehart
with a copy of it in 1983. A third said he'd seen a copy of the
report in 1983.
   The Pardue lawsuit seeks unspecified compensatory and punitive
damages as well as preliminary and permanent injunctions ordering
the defendants to halt any further investigation of the family. No
hearing date was set.

<HEAD>Disneyland Tram Ride From Fantasyland To Tomorrowland Stalls</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ANAHEIM, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A stalled aerial ride left about 150
persons dangling in the sky over Disneyland up to five hours while
workers struggled to rescue them.
   The Skyway cable stopped Saturday, apparently after someone in
one of the four-person gondolas began rocking their car vigorously,
said Disneyland spokesman Bob McTyre.
   About 150 people were aboard the ride at the time. No injuries
were reported during the shutdown and ensuing five-hour rescue
effort, McTyre said.
   All the attractions in Fantasyland and several in Tomorrowland
were closed because fire trucks had to maneuver underneath each car
during the prolonged rescue effort. Firefighters used hydraulic lift
equipment to rescue passengers, one by one, from gondolas suspended
about 40 feet overhead.
   The gondola ride shut down automatically Saturday evening, the
spokesman said. Riders had to be lowered to the amusement park floor
by firefighters using extension equipment.
   ``Eyewitnesses reported one guest car being swung by a guest
severely back and forth,'' McTyre said. ``We're speculating that's
what triggered the Skyway safety system to shut down like it did.''
   Firefighters from the Anaheim, Orange County and Garden Grove
fire department assisted in the rescue effort, he said.
   ``The guests have all been calm and no one was injured,'' McTyre
said. ``It's just been a big inconvenience, both for people stuck up
in the air and those on the ground.''
   No legal action was planned against the riders blamed for setting
off the ride's emergency shutdown system, the spokesman said.

<HEAD>Raising The Minimum Wage Will Cost Taxpayers As Well As Employers</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN KING</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Labor Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   As business and labor argue over raising the
minimum wage, the potential impact on the federal budget and major
jobs programs has been virtually lost in the debate.
   That changes this week when the bitterly partisan debate reaches
the House floor.
   Some say raising the minimum wage from its current $3.35 an hour
to $4.65 as proposed would have virtually no impact on the federal
budget. Others argue it would cost the budget, and taxpayers, as
much as $5 billion.
   Although most Democrats have downplayed any budget impact, an
analysis prepared last week by the Congressional Budget Office for
the Democratic sponsors of the legislation conceded that raising the
minimum wage could cost the government money and possibly force cuts
in at least four jobs programs.
   The nonpartisan CBO said it could not estimate the potential cost
because of insufficient data.
   But a House Republican analysis estimates that if the Democrats'
bill becomes law it would cost $570 million a year by 1992 to
maintain current staffing levels in just those four programs,
College Work Study, Head Start, Community Service for Older
Americans and the federal government's summer youth employment
program.
   Without that money, those programs will be forced to cut more
than 435,000 jobs, with work study, the campus jobs often awarded as
part of a student's financial aid package, accounting for half the
total, according to the Republicans.
   ``Somebody must speak out on behalf of the victims of this
legislation,'' Rep. Dick Armey, R-Texas, said in an interview. ``The
Democrats like to talk about these programs, but compassion without
understanding can be cruel and wasteful.''
   Armey tried unsuccessfully to amend the Democratic bill in
committee last week to exempt the four programs from having to pay
their workers any increase in the minimum wage. Only four fellow
Republicans sided with Armey as the amendment was trounced.
   He promised to try again during floor debate.
   Jay Butler, an aide to Rep. Augustus Hawkins, D-Calif., sponsor
of the House legislation, said Hawkins would support increased
spending on the programs to save the jobs but opposes paying their
workers less than the minimum wage.
   The prospects of getting more money for the programs to offset
the added payroll costs ``are between zero and none,'' countered
Armey, also a member of the House Budget Committee.
   Republicans are supporting President Bush's proposal for a more
modest increase, to $4.25 an hour by 1992, provided employers are
allowed to pay new workers $3.35 an hour for six months.
   That would alleviate some of the cost to the government, the
Republicans say. Their analysis did not include data on the Bush
plan.
   White House estimates of the impact the Democratic minimum-wage
bill would have on the budget range up to $5 billion.
   That figure came from Bush's Council of Economic Advisers, which
in a report to the Labor Department said a higher minimum wage would
cause an inflationary spiral in all wages and a subsequent hike in
interest rates. It estimated those higher rates would result in the
government having to pay from $2 billion to $5 billion in higher
interest for the money it borrows.
   Two other topics have dominated the debate over the minimum wage
_ whether a ``training wage'' should be included in the legislation
and to what degree raising the minimum wage results in job losses.
   Bush insists his support hinges on raising the minimum no higher
than $4.25 an hour with the accompanying provision allowing
employers to pay the sub-minimum for six months.
   Democrats, apparently convinced they cannot override a Bush veto,
have shown increased willingness to support some form of training
wage and plan to tag such a provision onto the House bill this week.
But it will require specific training, unlike Bush's proposal, and
have a far shorter life span than the six months espoused by the
president.
   Butler said Hawkins was reviewing a handful of training wage
proposals and, although he has been a staunch critic of the idea,
will select one to add to his bill. ``He knows President Bush will
be there for four years and would accept a bonafide training wage,''
Butler said.
   As for potential job losses, the Bush administration maintains
the Democratic bill would cost 650,000 jobs by 1992 while the
president's more modest proposal would cost about 200,000.
   The Democrats have assailed those figures, saying past increases
in the minimum wage have not caused significant job losses. But the
Congressional Budget Office, in a report sent to Hawkins on Friday,
estimated that raising the minimum to $4.65 would cause a loss of
from 125,000 to 250,000 jobs.

   Four black policemen were
wounded when a hand grenade was hurled through the gates of a police
training center in Soweto, police said Sunday.
   No arrests were reported, and no one claimed responsibility for
the Saturday night attack. Police have blamed similar past attacks
on the outlawed African National Congress guerrilla movement.
   Police said 19 black youths were arrested after attackers
firebombed a government building in a black township near the port
city of Durban, also Saturday night. Officers fired tear gas,
shotguns and pistols to disperse the bombers, and one youth was
wounded, police headquarters said.
   In Soweto, the main black township outside Johannesburg, a mob
caught a suspected rapist, and stoned and burned the man to death
Saturday. Police confirmed the killing, and two newspapers published
photographs of the burning body.
   In another development, anti-apartheid groups announced prayer
services nationwide on Tuesday in support of detainees, particularly
those staging hunger strikes to protest being held without charge.
They are held under provisions of a state of emergency in effect
since 1986.
   Tuesday will be the 29th anniversary of the Sharpeville Massacre,
in which police shot and killed 69 unarmed blacks protesting South
Africa's policies of racial separation.
   Two hunger strikers are reported in critical condition. Lawyers
and activists say Sandile Thusi, held in Durban, has not eaten for
31 days, and Donsie Khumalo, a union leader held in Pretoria, has
refused both food and liquids for 10 days.

<HEAD>More Than 200 Afghan Army Troops Reportedly Surrender to Guerrillas</HEAD>

<DATELINE>ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   More than 200 Afghan army troops
defected with tanks and weapons to Moslem guerrillas, and another 37
soldiers were captured during fighting in northern Afghanistan,
insurgent sources claimed Sunday.
   Afghanistan's state radio, monitored in Islamabad, said Sunday
that 215 guerrillas were killed and 64 others injured in the last 24
hours of fighting in the strategic eastern Afghan city of Jalalabad.
It also said ``huge amounts of arms, including missiles, were
seized.''
   Neither the guerrilla or communist government claims could be
independently verified.
   A spokesman for the fundamentalist Jamiat-i-Islami guerrilla
group said 43 officers and 165 enlisted men of the Afghan 18th
Division defected to insurgents Tuesday about 72 miles north of
Kabul.
   They handed over 12 tanks, 38 ammunition trucks, long-range
rockets and other military equipment, Mohammad Shoaib said from
Jamiat's headquarters in Peshawar, Pakistan.
   He said the guerrillas also captured five government officers and
32 soldiers in attacks on communist security posts along the
strategic Salang Road on March 10.
   The rebels control much of northern Afghanistan's Panjshir
Valley. The Salang road, Kabul's main land route to the Soviet
Union, runs through the valley. Soviet forces in February ended a
nine-year intervention in Afghanistan, but Moscow continues to send
supplies to Kabul's beleagured communist government.
   The communists maintain their hold on Afghanistan's cities, but
guerrillas control more than 90 percent of the countryside.
   In Kabul, Afghan authorities said two Pakistani military men,
Bashir Majid and Mohammad Afzal, were captured near Kandahar, 300
miles southwest of Kabul. Pakistan, which backs the guerrillas, has
denied any nationals are fighting in Afghanistan.
   The Kabul government radio reports said guerrillas fired several
rockets into Jalalabad on Sunday, killing three civilians and
injuring 19, including eight communist troops.
   The radio claimed 214 guerrillas were killed and 64 people
injured around the city in the last 24 hours. It gave no army
casualties.
   Insurgents two weeks ago chose the city, Afghanistan's third
largest, for their first major offensive against the Kabul
government since the Soviet pullout. They captured a key garrison at
Jalalabad and breached airport defenses, but communist forces have
stalled the advance with massive aerial and artillery bombardments.
   Hundreds on both sides are believed to have been killed and
wounded since rebels began their attack on March 6. Pakistani
officials say more than 10,000 civilians have fled the fighting to
Pakistan, which already shelters more than 3 million Afghan refugees.
   Jalalabad lies on a key road between Pakistan and Kabul.
Observers believe its fall would be a major blow to the communists.
   Speaking in a news conference in Islamabad Sunday, guerrilla
leader Gulbaddin Hekmatyar said the insurgents favored a ``gradual
fall of big cities in order to avoid massacre and genocide of the
Afghan people.''
   Guerrilla leaders have formed their own provisional Afghan
government-in-exile, which would come from Pakistan to establish an
Islamic republic if the communists fall.

<HEAD>China Condemns U.S., European Resolutions on Tibet</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BEIJING (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   China condemned as ``interference'' separate
resolutions by the U.S. Senate and European Parliament accusing
Beijing of human rights violations in Tibet, official reports said
Sunday.
   ``We express strong indignation and deep regret,'' the People's
Daily said, quoting a harshly-worded statement from the Foreign
Affairs Committee of the National People's Congress.
   The legislative committee also lodged ``a strong protest'' Sunday
against the U.S. resolution, the Xinhua News Agency said. Similar
resolutions in the past have become major points of friction between
the two countries.
   The U.S. resolution ``blatantly supports a handful of separatists
in Tibet,'' Xinhua quoted the statement as saying.
   The committee Saturday condemned the European Parliament
resolution, which urged Beijing to lift martial law and called on
European nations to help mediae the Tibetan problem.
   ``The Tibetan people are a member of the big family of the
Chinese nation. Any attempt to internationalize the Tibetan question
on the excuse of human rights is firmly opposed by the Chinese
government and will never succeed,'' the statement said.
   Its strong language is in keeping with China's policy of harshly
rejecting outside criticism of its actions in Tibet, which it claims
has been part of China's territory since the 13th century.
   Many Tibetans say they enjoyed de facto independence before
Chinese communist troops entered in 1950. They accuse the Chinese of
human rights violations and of trying to destroy Tibet's
Buddhist-based culture.
   The European Parliament passed its resolution Thursday about the
martial law China imposed March 8 after three days of anti-Chinese
violence in the Tibetan capital, Lhasa. At least 12 people were
killed in the fourth bloody Tibetan-Chinese confrontation in the
past 18 months.
   The Parliament also appealed to foreign ministers of the
12-member European Community to offer their mediation.
   ``We are firmly opposed to and will by no means accept'' such
mediation, the Chinese statement said. ``No foreign government,
organization or individual is allowed to meddle in the question of
negotiations between the Chinese central government and the Dalai
Lama.'' The Dalai Lama is a self-exile many Tibetans consider their
temporal and spiritual leader.
   The U.S. Senate, which also acted Thursday, has approved
non-binding resolutions in the past urging the State Department to
pressure China to end alleged human rights violations in Tibet.
   Two days after China imposed martial law on Tibet, the U.S. State
Department issued a statement of concern, which China dismissed as
interference.
   ``The Chinese government is entirely justified and above reproach
in taking the necessary measures to uphold law and maintain order,''
the Chinese legislative committee said.
   It reiterated China's willingness to hold talks with the Dalai
Lama, but ruled out independence or autonomy for the remote region.
   ``We strongly demand that the European parliament immediately
stop its interference in China's internal affairs so as to prevent
doing any harm to our bilateral relations,'' it said.
   It similarly warned the U.S. Senate to act in the ``interests of
safeguarding Chinese-U.S. relations.''

   South African diplomats Sunday
began their first official visit to post-revolutionary Cuba,
arriving to discuss a southern African peace treaty and seek the
release of a captured soldier, the state radio reported.
   The South Africans will be attending a meeting this week of a
joint commission formed to monitor the treaty signed in December by
Cuba, South Africa and Angola.
   South Africa agreed to grant independence to Namibia and halt aid
to the UNITA rebel movement in Angola in exchange for the phased
withdrawal of the 50,000 Cuban troops assisting Angola's Marxist
government. UNITA stands for the National Union for the Total
Independence of Angola.
   The South African Broadcasting Corp. said the South African
delegation, which includes Foreign Ministry officials and military
officers, would be seeking the release of Rifleman Johan Papenfus,
who was captured in Angola more than a year ago. Papenfus was taken
to Havana for medical treatment and is now held in a military cell.
   Papenfus' brother and sister accompanied the South African
officials to Havana and visited the prisoner, the radio said.
   One of the issues expected to be discussed by the monitoring
commission is the deployment of UNITA forces and guerrillas of the
South-West African People's Organization, which has been fighting
for Namibian independence since 1966.
   South Africa has complained that Angola-based SWAPO units have
failed to comply with an agreement to move northward away from the
Namibian border, although the radio reported from Havana that the
issue might be resolved.
   Angola has complained that UNITA units are making use of Namibian
territory in violation of the accord.

<HEAD>8 in 10 Americans Prefer Chemical Free Food; Half Would Pay More</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DIANE DUSTON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An overwhelming majority of Americans say they
would buy organically grown food if it cost the same as fruits and
vegetables treated with pesticides or synthetic fertilizers and
nearly half would pay more, according to a survey released Sunday.
   The strong preference for chemical-free fruits and vegetables
showed up in a survey conducted even before the recent scare over
poisoned grapes and apples treated with Alar.
   The Louis Harris Poll conducted for Organic Gardening magazine
found that 84.2 percent of those surveyed would choose organically
grown food if given the choice, 11.6 percent would not and 4.2
percent were not sure.
   Perhaps more surprisingly, 49 percent said they would pay more
for organic food, the poll showed.
   People with college degrees and those earning a household income
of more than $35,000 are more likely to have eaten organic produce
than those with less education or a lower income, the poll showed.
   Men under 50 who live in the West and have managerial or
professional jobs are the most likely to have eaten organic food,
according to the survey. People in the South are the least likely.
   The reason almost 60 percent of those surveyed gave for choosing
organic was long-term health effects.
   The majority of those who have eaten organically grown fruits and
vegetables said they taste better, have more nutritional value and
are better for health.
   But while consumers may want to switch to organics, the problem
is finding organically grown food.
   ``On the West Coast and a few places on the East Coast there are
some supermarkets that have organic sections within their stores,''
said Stevie O. Daniels, executive editor of Organic Gardening
magazine. ``But usually you have to go to speciality stores.''
   She said her magazine's research shows the organic farmers' share
of the $36 billion fruit and vegetable market is about $5 billion.
   Three states _ Washington, Minnesota and Texas _ have organic
certification programs through which consumers are assured the
grower does not use synthetic fertilizers or pesticides, Daniels
said.
   Organic food usually costs 5 percent to 15 percent more and
sometimes doesn't look as picture perfect as other fruits and
vegetables, she said.
   ``From my point of view it is a more realistic looking product,''
she said. ``Nature is not perfect.''
   ``Organic produce got a bad reputation because the people growing
it tried to do the marketing and they didn't know how to market it,
but now growers work with marketing professionals,'' she said.
   The nationwide survey was based on 1,250 telephone interviews
with randomly selected adults throughout the continental United
States between Nov. 9 and Nov. 23, 1988. The sampling error is plus
or minus 3 percentage points.
   The poll was taken well before last week's temporary ban of
Chilean fruit because two grapes had been injected with the poison
cyanide.
   It also came before the most recent flap over use on apples of
Alar, a chemical that aides ripening and helps preserve crispness,
that resulted in some schools banning apples from their menus.
   There has been a high-profile campaign against Alar, including an
appeal last week by actress Meryl Streep in a well-publicized
appearance before a congressional committee.
   However, Surgeon General C. Everett Koop joined other federal
officials over the weekend in attempting to assure the public it is
safe to eat apples.
   ``I wish to send a message to mothers across the country: `It's
Mom, apples are good for your kids!'' said Koop.
   He noted that only 5 percent of the U.S. apple crop was treated
with Alar in 1988. Food and Drug Commissioner Frank Young has said
that, even in those apples sprayed with Alar, the level is no more
than 10 percent the level found acceptable under Environmental
Protection Agency regulations.

   Pope John Paul II stressed the link between
Easter and youth during an open-air Palm Sunday Mass in St. Peter's
Square attended by about 60,000 people marking the opening of Holy
Week.
   On a sunny morning, the pope blessed the palms and _ carrying a
palm branch _ led a procession to the altar on the steps of St.
Peter's Basilica for a Mass commemorating Jesus Christ's entry into
Jerusalem.
   At the end of the ceremony, the pope offered greetings to young
people in several languages and blessed sick and disabled people in
the front rows.
   In separate remarks, the pope said there is a special connection
between youth and Easter, which is celebrated on Sunday and marks
the resurrection of Christ.
   ``How can one not see in youth and its values _ life, health,
beauty, physical vigor, enthusiasm, joy _ almost a forerunner of the
triumph of the resurrected Christ and his glorious return?'' the
pope said in Italian.
   He said youths must work toward ``the victory over sin ... that
victory over evil, of which your inner life and your own physical
being are such a beautiful symbol.''
   The theme of youth was also stressed Saturday evening when the
pope joined 10,000 young people at a Vatican concert by Italian pop
singer Franco Battiato. It was the first time a pop singer had
performed at the Vatican.
   Holy Week services continue later this week when the pope
celebrates Mass on Holy Thursday and goes to Rome's Basilica of St.
John Lateran to wash the feet of 12 priests in a ceremony
re-enacting Christ's last supper with his apostles.
   The pope will carry a wooden cross in a Good Friday procession
near the Colosseum, celebrate the Easter vigil on Saturday night and
an open-air Mass in St. Peter's Square on Easter Sunday.

   Thousands of students and workers
cheered calls Sunday by dissident leaders for the ouster of
President Roh Tae-woo and the immediate withdrawal of U.S. troops
from South Korea.
   Leaders of the United National Democratic Movement, the main
dissident alliance, told a rally of 5,000 people at Hanyang
University that opposition forces must unite to defeat the
government in a pending national referendum.
   ``Down with Roh Tae-woo!'' and ``Yankee go home!'' protesters
chanted.
   Some students hurled firebombs and rocks at riot police in a
brief clash after the rally. Police fired volleys of tear gas that
drove protesters back.
   Thousands of riot police had surrounded the school, but there was
little trouble after alliance leaders urged people to disperse
peacefully.
   Police officials reported no arrests or injuries.
   Alliance chairman Lee Bu-yong told the rally Roh was a front for
military rule.
   ``We cannot suffer any more under the Roh regime. We must oust
the Roh regime without fail,'' Lee said.
   Paik Ki-wan, another leading dissident, denounced the United
States for supporting the Roh government and charged Washington was
trying to control South Korea like a colony.
   ``The real culprit is the United States,'' he said.
   Protesters repeatedly called for the withdrawal of 42,000 U.S.
troops based in South Korea. The United States has said they will
remain as long as the South Korean government wants them.
   Roh, a former general who won a presidential election in December
1987, is expected this week to announce plans for a national
referendum on his performance as president.
   The government says Roh will not step down if he is defeated.
Some opposition groups are demanding he resign if defeated.

<HEAD>Son of Last King Recognizes Republic, Wants to Return</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The son of Italy's last king for the first time
recognized the republic, renewing a campaign for him and his son to
be allowed to return from a 43-year exile despite a constitutional
ban, media reports said Sunday.
   In a letter to Italian president Francisco Cossiga published in
Italian newspapers, Victor Emmanuel wrote from exile in Switzerland
that he is not, however, renouncing his claim to the former throne
of the House of Savoy.
   Victor Emmanuel, 51, wrote the letter Saturday, the sixth
anniversary of the death of his father, King Umberto II.
   ``I want to do today what my father was not in a position to do,
and that is to recognize this incontrovertible reality that is the
Italian republic,'' he wrote.
   He said he was appealing especially on behalf of his 17-year-old
son, Emmanuel Filiberto, whom he hoped would be allowed to attend an
Italian military academy and university.
   The letter sparked immediate speculation that Victor Emmanuel was
relinquishing his claim to the throne, but he quickly denied that
was the case.
   ``I want to return to Italy as soon as possible,'' he told
Milan's Corriere Della Sera newspaper. ``I say simply that I
recognize the republic because it's there. I will never, never
renounce my royal prerogatives. I am totally monarchist.''
   Victor Emmanuel has appealed in the past for the government to
allow his family to return. Italy's 1947 constitution, however, bans
the entry of Victor Emmanuel and his heirs from the country and
would need a two-thirds majority in both houses of Parliament to be
altered.
   Umberto II reigned for 26 days before being forced into exile in
1946, when Italians voted by a slim margin to abolish the monarchy.
Umberto II died in Geneva in 1983 at the age of 78.
   In 1987, the government lifted the constitutional ban on the
entry of his widow, the ex-queen Maria Jose. She has since returned
to Italy on a few occasions, but continues to live in Switzerland.
   The House of Savoy ruled Piedmont for nine centuries and its
kings reigned in Italy from 1861 to 1946.

   President and Mrs. Bush observed Palm Sunday by
attending a worship service at an landmark Episcopal church a block
from the White House.
   They knelt with other worshippers at the altar rail of St. John's
Episcopal Church on Lafayette Square and received Holy Communion at
the 8 a.m. service. At the conclusion of the service, they were
given traditional palm fronds.
   The Bushes, who are Episcopalian, frequently attended the church
during the eight years of his vice presidency. It was founded in
1815 and every president since John Madison has worshipped there.
   They were greeted at the church by the Rev. Mark K. J. Robinson,
one of the rectors, who said, ``Congratulations on the puppies.''
   It was a reference the six puppies born over the weekend to the
Bush's springer spaniel.

   The pilot laughed when asked why he is willing to
risk his job in the showdown between Eastern Airlines and its unions.
   ``For five years, every time the little guy with the rifle walked
by, he made me bow down,'' said Jerry Gerndt. ``I came out of
Vietnam with my head held up, and I'm not going to spend the rest of
my life looking down when I pass other pilots.''
   He is among the 3,400 Eastern pilots who stunned management by
joining the March 4 walkout by the Machinists union. He's also a
former prisoner of war.
   Air Force 1st Lt. Gerald L. Gerndt, piloting an F-4 Phantom
fighter on a bombing mission to Hanoi, was shot down Aug. 23, 1967.
Five years and five months later, Gerndt was flown out of Hanoi on a
U.S. transport plane.
   He carried with him the wounds of years of torture and
mistreatment that led to broken ribs, damaged joints, hepatitis and
repeated bouts with dysentery. He also carried out a changed
philosophy of life.
   ``Little things in life don't bother you so much,'' said Gerndt,
46. ``You want to stand up and be counted if someone is trying to
take advantage of people and trying to force his ideas and views on
them.''
   Eastern, which had hoped to keep at least 25 percent of its
pre-strike schedule of 1,040 daily flights during the strike, is
struggling to maintain 10 percent, with the walkout well into its
third week.
   The executives put in place three years ago by Texas Air Corp.
Chairman Frank Lorenzo admitted they badly overestimated the number
of pilots who would keep flying. Only about 200 Eastern pilots have
crossed the picket lines.
   Pilots often have ignored the picket lines of other airline
unions, but the Eastern pilots say they learned from Continental
pilots, who lost their union along with the Machinsts in 1983 even
though the pilots didn't honor picket lines.
   The pilots also say they believe that Lorenzo, whose Texas Air
also owns Continental, is bent on stripping Eastern of its assets
while chipping away at employees' pay and work conditions.
   Pilots union spokesman J.B. Stokes said another key to
understanding the Eastern pilots' resolve is that 75 percent or more
are military veterans, many with Vietnam experience.
   ``One of the problems is this management has been trying to use
intimidation and coercion,'' said Stokes, a B-52 pilot who flew
Vietnam combat missions in 1969. ``It speaks to the Frank Lorenzo
philosophy and shows how badly he misunderstands these pilots.
   ``These people know what it really is to be afraid; they've put
their lives on the line in a hostile environment,'' Stokes said.
``If I survived Vietnam, I damn sure am not going to be concerned
about a guy putting memos on a bulletin board.''
   Gerndt said as much as he loves flying and the lifestyle of a
pilot for a major carrier, the job's not worth giving in to
``demeaning management.''
   He recounted his Vietnam experience last week, talking by
telephone from his Milwaukee financial consulting office where he
works when not walking picket lines.
   He was in one of the first bombing missions into North Vietnam
when he was shot down. Gerndt and his co-pilot ejected about 20
miles north of Hanoi and he could hear bullets pinging the
parachute's canopy as he fell.
   They were captured when they landed, stripped of their clothes
and marched to Hanoi. Most of his imprisonment was in the infamous
``Hanoi Hilton.''
   ``It started as soon as I got there. It was just like everything
you ever heard about: beatings, `rope tricks' where they tie you up
and put stress on different joints, like a variation of the rack.
   ``At times you wonder if you will die there. But you have to have
hope. That's all you have left,'' Gerndt said.
   He was freed in January 1973 as U.S. involvement in Vietnam was
winding down, and by that August, he was flying for Eastern. Shortly
afterward he was laid off because of cutbacks because of the energy
crisis, and he got an MBA from Stanford University.
   Gerndt said his Eastern salary is below the $70,000 to $75,000
average the Air Line Pilots Association estimates Eastern pilots
earn annually. He said given the education and skills the pilots
have, they resent Lorenzo and other managers' efforts to put them
``near the bottom of the barrel'' in the industry.
   ``Basically, I look at it that he's trying to destroy
(employees') way of living,'' Gerndt said. ``Why would I want to
work for a man like that?''

   Thousands of Soviets took to the streets Sunday to
accuse the Communist Party of sabotaging Boris N. Yeltsin's election
campaign and to threaten a general strike if the maverick reformer
fails to win office.
   The march through downtown Moscow by 3,000 Soviets chanting
``Hands off Yeltsin!'' was an extraordinary outburst of passions
aroused by Sunday's election for a new national parliament, the
Congress of People's Deputies.
   Security forces did not halt the march, even though it violated a
regulation requiring that authorities receive prior notice.
   Yeltsin, 58, is running to represent the Soviet capital, where he
headed the local party apparatus for almost two years before
President Mikhail S. Gorbachev fired him.
   At pre-election meetings and in a televised debate with his
opponent, automobile factory manager Yevgeny Brakov, the stocky,
white-haired Yeltsin has charged the party machine he once led of
conspiring against his candidacy and restricting voters' access to
his campaign appearances.
   Thousands of Yeltsin supporters planned to rally after noon
Sunday at southwestern Moscow's Gorky Park, where a Russian folklore
festival was under way. When they were told permission for the
meeting had been refused, they set off for the city's downtown.
   Their anger was also kindled by a recent decision of the party's
policy-making Central Committee, announced Thursday, to form a
special commission to investigate charges that Yeltsin, who is still
a Central Committee member, opposes some party policies.
   The high-level campaign against Yeltsin appeared to enter another
phase Sunday when the daily newspaper of Moscow's party and
government printed an account about Yeltsin's character and
politics. The newspaper, Moskovskaya Pravda, said it was a ``myth''
he was more faithful to principles than others.
   Yeltsin won the hearts and support of many Muscovites with a
campaign against corruption and spirited attacks on the privileges,
from special food stores to chauffeured limousines, available to the
government and party elite.
   ``He's against the party mafia, and that's why the party mafia is
against him,'' declared one marcher on Sunday, Taras Osipov, 65, a
retired engineer. ``Yeltsin is with the people, and for the people.''
   The demonstrators, who carried a hand-painted banner reading
``Yes to Yeltsin, no to the bureaucratic system!'' glued pro-Yeltsin
posters to the walls of buildings along their route, including the
Foreign Ministry Press Center, and called on passers-by to join them.
   On Kalinin Prospekt, scores of gray-uniformed police officers,
backed up by KGB agents in plainclothes, barred the way to the
Kremlin, the seat of Soviet power. The marchers, including
teen-agers and people in their 60s, then marched past the
headquarters of the Soviet news agency Tass and arrived at Gorky
Street, Moscow's major shopping thoroughfare.
   Police and KGB agents along the route channeled the marchers, but
made no attempt to halt them, even though their protest violated
Moscow city regulations that require seven days' notice of any
demonstration.
   The street resounded with the chant of ``Hands off Yeltsin!'' as
the marchers approached the five-story, red-and-white columned
building that serves as Moscow's City Hall.
   There, another cordon of police and yellow buses parked across
the avenue barred their way.
   In unison, the protesters brandished their fists and chanted
their demand to meet with Lev N. Zaikov, a member of the ruling
party Politburo who succeeded Yeltsin as Moscow party boss in
November 1987, and who leads the party machine Yeltsin claims is
working for his defeat.
   When a city official clambered on top of a bus and told the crowd
through a bullhorn to break up the protest, there were whistles of
derision and chants of ``Shame! Shame!'' from the crowd.
   One bearded pro-Yeltsin speaker near the building's doorway
shouted, ``Shame on our Soviet democracy. Shame on our leaders.''
   When the elderly man called for a one-day work stoppage across
Moscow if Yeltsin is defeated, the crowd roared and raised its hands
in approval.
   Last week, the Central Committee, in its monthly bulletin,
published Yeltsin's October 1987 speech to the party body that got
him sacked as Moscow party chief. Jerry Hough, a U.S. political
scientist who specializes in Soviet studies, said the timing of the
publication was aimed at discrediting Yeltsin as he tries to win
election.
   Yeltsin told the Central Committee on Oct. 21, 1987 that faith in
Gorbachev's reforms was waning and that the president was becoming
the subject of ``intolerable'' glorification. Yeltsin, who had been
named Moscow party boss in December 1985 and a non-voting member of
the Politburo two months later, lost both posts as a result of his
remarks.
   He was later named to a ministerial-rank job in the State
Construction Committee, which oversees building in the Soviet Union.

<HEAD>Government Urged To Tell All About Flight 103 Bomb Warnings</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LESLIE SHEPHERD</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Demands for an independent inquiry into Britain's
handling of warnings received before the bombing of Pan Am Flight
103 will grow until the government explains its actions, an
opposition party leader said Sunday.
   ``We cannot afford `bag it and bin it' policies of British
official secrecy on matters of security which affect every air
traveler across the world,'' said Paddy Ashdown, leader of the
centrist Social and Liberal Democratic Party.
   Transport Secretary Paul Channon ``must come clean on all the
circumstances surrounding the advance warning,'' Ashdown said in a
statement.
   ``Unless he comes to the House of Commons at the earliest
opportunity next week and is competely candid in every detail, the
demand for an official inquiry on both sides of the Atlantic will
become irresistible,'' he said.
   Those demanding an independent inquiry include the opposition
Labor Party and relatives of those killed when Flight 103 exploded
over Lockerbie, Scotland, Dec. 21 on a flight to New York.
Investigators say the disaster, in which 259 died aboard the plane
and 11 on the ground, was caused by a bomb concealed in a
radio-cassette player packed in luggage in the plane's hold.
   Channon said Sunday he told Parliament ``as much as it is in my
power to tell.'' Government ministers ``should not go around
revealing things that might be against the national interest,'' he
told the British Broadcasting Corp.
   Channon said he welcomed U.S. Transportation Secretary Samuel
Skinner's decision to send top aides to London and Frankfurt, West
Germany, to assess aviation security. Skinner said he wants his
officials to determine, among other things, when and how warnings
were made against Pan Am flights last year.
   ``The investigators have been working extremely closely with the
Americans at all stages, and I think if they come over here, and the
investigators have further talks with them, that can only be a very
good thing,'' Channon said.
   ``There is keen public concern in the United States and in this
country about the progress of this investigation and it's not
surprising that people should wish to come over and have further
talks.''
   The Transport Department confirmed last week it prepared a
warning dated Dec. 19 that included photographs of a bomb hidden in
a radio-cassette player but did not mail it until after Christmas.
   Channon has said the letter was of little importance because
similar information had been sent out a month earlier by the U.S.
Federal Aviation Administration and by West Germany. Flight 103
originated in West Germany and changed planes at London's Heathrow
Airport before setting out for New York.
   Two London newspapers, The Observer and The Sunday Telegraph,
reported Sunday that the Dec. 19 warning carried several important
details that would have helped security people spot a rigged
radio-cassette player.

   Actress Sally Struthers says her work
with needy children has convinced her that she can make a difference
in the world.
   Ms. Struthers, who works with the Christian Children's Fund, said
even though she has seen thousands of needy children in three
continents, she believes world hunger can be conquered.
   ``Children with malnutrition problems have dull and listless
eyes; they look like they are in a perpetual daze. Their arms and
legs are thin, and their stomachs stick out. But compassion will end
world hunger,'' she said. ``If you can't see past the statistics and
into the lives, you'll never do any good.''
   Ms. Struthers is best known for her Emmy-award winning role as
Gloria Stivic on the long-running television series ``All in the
Family.''
   She was in Springfield on Saturday to speak at the annual Today's
Woman Expo '89.
   Ms. Struthers believes education is another key to conquering
world hunger.
   ``You break the cycle of poverty when you educate a child. Food
is almost secondary,'' the actress said. ``If you give a man a fish,
you feed him for one day, but if you teach a man to fish, you feed
him for a lifetime.''

daughter attends.
   Iglesias received the honorary title from the New World School of
the Arts in Miami in return for establishing a permanent scholarship
fund.
   ``I love the school very much,'' Iglesias said. ``The people
there wanted us to help people who need it. And that's all right
with us because it's very easy for us. ... It's not a very big
sacrifice.''
   Iglesias and school officials declined to disclose the value of
the trust fund. interest from the fund will be used to pay for a
year's tuition and books for a student.
   Isabel Iglesias, one of Iglesias' three children, is studying
painting and design at the school, the singer said.
   The public, state-supported school for the arts was established
in 1987. Students can enter in the 10th grade and continue their
studies toward a Bachelor of Arts degree.

   Citing William Lucas' lack of experience, civil
rights groups are expressing concern that he might be the wrong
choice to head the Justice Department's civil rights division.
   Civil rights leaders have not taken a formal position on William
Lucas, who Attorney General Dick Thornburgh has designated as his
choice to head the department's civil rights division.
   But these leaders say they are continuing to study Lucas' record
to determine what position they will ultimately take if President
Bush nominates the black Republican from Michigan as assistant
attorney general for civil rights.
   ``So far we are still quite concerned about the nomination
because the position is extremely important for the civil rights
community,'' said Julius Chambers, director of the NAACP Legal
Defense and Education Fund, Inc.
   Lucas, 61, is ``a person who hasn't really been involved in civil
rights litigation for more than 20 years and a person who has taken
some positions, for whatever reason, in civil rights that show no
sensitivity for the problems,'' said Chambers.
   Chambers notes Lucas' opposition to affirmative action, saying
positions he has taken on school desegregation ``were quite
bothersome.''
   Besides Lucas' lack of experience, Washington attorney William
Taylor said he is concerned about Lucas' record as sheriff in the
Detroit area.
   The record includes a court finding that he was legally
responsible for injuries suffered by a prisoner who was beaten while
in the custody of Wayne County sheriffs' deputies.
   The 1976 beating of Salvatore Marchese by an unidentified person
who was admitted to his locked holding cell at a suburban Detroit
station was the subject of a strongly-worded 1985 ruling by the 6th
U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals.
   The court cited Lucas' ``failure to provide a trained and
disciplined county law enforcement agency'' or to investigate the
beating incident.
   Lucas had testified that he did not know about the incident and
therefore would not have been able to investigate it.
   But the appellate court said he was still legally liable because
``in his official capacity he had a duty to both know and act.''
   ``The sheriff's subsequent failure to order and direct an
investigation which disclosed exactly who were the perpetrators of
these brutal violations of the U.S. Constitution and to administer
censure and punishment served to confirm the existence of an
unstated `policy' of toleration of illegal brutality toward any
county prisoner who had threatened the life of a sheriff's deputy,''
the court said.
   ``I was sheriff an awful long time,'' Lucas said. ``There were
many cases that required investigation. This is one case, that is
one too many of course, but this was a very turbulent time.''
   Lucas was sheriff from 1969 to 1982, when he was elected county
executive. After switching to the Republican Party, Lucas made an
unsuccessful run for Michigan governor in 1986.
   He now wants to head a Justice Department division that both
civil and criminal civil rights laws, including statutes barring
police from violating constitutional rights of criminal suspects.
The division has brought many prosecutions for systematic police
brutality against blacks.
   During his tenure as sheriff, Lucas said, ``We had a reputation
for taking strong actions against anyone who violated department
rules and particularly civil rights.''
   Asked if he had ever fired deputies for brutality, Lucas said:
``I am certain that we did. Deputies were fired for all sorts of
violations.
   ``I have never been accused of being insensitive of the rights of
anyone,'' said Lucas, a former policeman and FBI agent who worked as
Justice Department civil rights investigator in the 1960s.
   Deborah Gordon, the lawyer who represented Marchese in the civil
case, said she never challenged Lucas' statements that he didn't
know about the Marchese beating.
   Although she doesn't personally hold Lucas responsible for the
beating she said: ``Could the department have been run better?
Probably. What it indicated to me was a complete lack of concern of
any kind on the part of the department about this.''

   Moslem gunners volleyed rockets into
Lebanon's Christian heartland Sunday, and the Christians reportedly
built up forces facing Syrian army positions, threatening to
escalate fighting.
   Police said at least 20 rockets fired from Syrian-policed Moslem
west Beirut exploded on beaches north of the capital near Lebanon's
main power plant and Jounieh port, the Christians' main sea outlet.
   There were no reports of damage or casualties on the 12th day of
the latest fighting between Christians and Moslems in Lebanon's
14-year-old civil war. At least 49 people have been killed and 164
wounded since clashes erupted March 8.
   Sniper fire crackled all day across the ruins of Beirut's old
commercial district straddling the government-controlled port, and
around the hilltop garrison town of Souk el-Gharb, 15 miles
southeast of the city, police said.
   Christians marked Palm Sunday in church rituals bereft of
traditional festivities. Most Moslems stayed indoors.
   Both sides fear a repetition of Tuesday's bloodbath in which 39
people were killed and 96 wounded in a daylong shelling duel across
Beirut's dividing Green Line.
   That was the peak of fighting between army commander Gen. Michel
Aoun's mainly Christian units and Syrian-backed militiamen of Druse
warlord Walid Jumblatt.
   A shaky 48-hour truce, called midnight Thursday to allow
mediators to negotiate, expired with no sign of a breakthrough.
   Aoun, who heads the Christian military Cabinet of Lebanon's dual
government, reiterated that he will deal only with Syria to
negotiate a meaningful cease-fire, his spokesmen said.
   ``He doesn't want to waste time talking to surrogates ...
Jumblatt and his allies are merely doing Syria's bidding,'' the
spokesman said on condition of anonymity.
   Syria, which supports the rival Moslem Cabinet of acting Prime
Minister Salim Hoss, has rejected Aoun's overtures.
   In an all-out confrontation, Syria could call on about 53,500
troops _ more than twice the number at Aoun's command.
   ``If Aoun really believes the Syrians might come around and
recognize him, he must be daydreaming,'' a Jumblatt aide said on
condition of anonymity. ``There's no room for peace.''
   He said Aoun has been moving tanks and artillery to face Syrian
army positions on the eastern and northeastern flanks of the
Christian hinterland. Aoun's spokesman refused to comment on that.
But he charged the Syrians have set up 16 heavy artillery batteries
in mountains overlooking the Christian enclave.
   Reliable witnesses said the Syrians also have set mortars and
multibarrelled rocket launchers atop high-rise apartment buildings
in outlying districts of west Beirut and its southern slums.
   Lebanon's 800,000-strong Christian minority appeared penned up
with its back to the Mediterranean, ringed on three sides by
pro-Syrian forces.
   Aoun on Sunday called for the formation of a military committee
of Lebanese and Syrian army officers to draw up a timetable for a
Syrian withdrawal.
   Syria, the main power broker in Lebanon, has not responded to
Aoun's demands. Damascus maintains its troops here under a 1976 Arab
League peacekeeping mandate.
   The crisis follows a March 6 air-and-sea blockade Aoun clamped on
illegal militia-controlled harbors to choke off the private armies'
main income.

   District of Columbia officials say outsiders
are to blame for much of the city's homeless problem, but homeless
rights advocates reject the notion that people move here from nearby
suburbs to receive free shelter.
   The debate has been raging since before voters passed Initiative
17, the Right to Overnight Shelter Act, in November 1984, requiring
the city to provide shelter to ``all persons in the District of
Columbia.''
   Mayor Marion S. Barry Jr. had lobbied against the referendum,
saying it would attract outsiders to the District to take advantage
of free services. More than four years later, he says that has
happened.
   ``Washington is 22 percent of the region's population,'' Barry
said during a news conference late last year. ``Yet we have 78
percent of the region's homeless. ... In every area of dependency,
we have a disproportionate share _ not because people here are poor,
but because Maryland and Virginia are not carrying their fair
share.''
   Barry spokesman John White said there were ``no hard stats'' to
back up the mayor's assertion, but that when the mayor toured a
newly opened shelter in January, half the people to whom he spoke
said they were from out of town.
   ``It's a myth to think that homeless people are mobile and have
the means to travel from around the country in order to get
services,'' said Maria Foscarinis, an attorney with the National
Coalition for the Homeless.
   ``Homeless people are generally destitute. They lack
transportation money. It's hard enough to get from one side of the
town to another, let alone from one part of the country to another.''
   D.C. officials estimate there are less than 10,000 homeless in
the nation's capital, but homeless advocates say the number is
closer to 15,000.
   Ray Spicer, homeless coordinator for neighboring Arlington
County, Va., acknowledged that his county is short on shelter space.
Arlington provided shelter for more than 1,200 people during all of
1988, turning away 2,100, he said. But those who couldn't find a
place went elsewhere in northern Virginia, not into Washington, said
Spicer.
   Christine Felker, assistant director of the Prince George's
County, Md., Department of Social Services, said, ``I believe that
people are crossing the lines both ways.''
   Ms. Felker said the county, which focuses on helping homeless
people and families ``get back on their feet,'' sheltered more than
4,500 people last year, but turned away 5,100.
   Homeless rights advocates said Barry's assertion reflects the
common practice of political leaders to blame the problem on
outsiders.
   ``Every single mayor in the country is saying exactly the same
thing,'' said Ms. Foscarinis. ``It's a typical response, no longer
novel, by mayors who want to avoid their responsibility to aid the
homeless.''
   Initiative 17 isn't drawing homeless persons here, homeless
advocates insist.
   ``People don't bounce around for a bed and shelter,'' said Mitch
Snyder, whose Community for Creative Non-Violence runs a 1,400-bed
shelter near the U.S. Capitol. ``People have as much a sense of
place, whether they have a roof over their head or not, as people
who live indoors. People only move for jobs.''
   Other shelter operators reported similar experiences.
   ``The vast majority of our women are D.C. residents,'' said Ellen
Rocks, director of the House of Ruth, which shelters homeless and
battered women and children. ``The sense of people transitioning
into D.C. because the services are so good strikes me as absurd.''
   Pam Hollar, who directs the Luther Place Emergency Shelter for
Women, said, ``From being on the inside, I'm not sure that D.C.'s
such an attractive place.''
   Information about those who stay in city-run shelters is not
available, although a computer system is being implemented to better
track shelter residents, said D.C. homeless coordinator Sue Marshall.
   Council member Nadine Winter proposed a bill in February designed
to ensure that residents get priority for long-term homeless
services such as job training and drug counseling. She did not
specify how homeless people could prove residency.

<HEAD>Four Palestinians Reported Killed, 18 Wounded</HEAD>

   Israeli soldiers killed four Palestinians and
wounded at least 18 in the most intense clashes in months in the
occupied territories, Arab reports said. The army confirmed two dead
and nine wounded in the clashes.
   The renewed violence took the Palestinian death toll to at least
403 since the Arab uprising against Israel's occupation of the West
Bank and Gaza Strip began in December 1987.
   Protests erupted in the occupied Gaza Strip after three Arabs
were killed by Israeli gunfire and at least 20 others were wounded
on Saturday.
   Early Sunday, a 26-year-old Palestinian was shot to death after
stabbing three Israeli border police in Gaza City, the army said.
   Israel Radio said the border guards were wounded as they broke
into a house in pursuit of the masked Palestinian who fled after
hurling rocks at troops. Two of the soldiers were reported in
moderate condition and the third was lightly wounded.
   The dead man was identified by hospital officials as Talal Selim
Al-Araj, from the city's Daraj neighborhood. The officials said he
was shot in the head and chest.
   In the afternoon, a 15-year-old Arab boy was fatally shot in the
city after hurling a bottle at soldiers. The army said the soldier
who opened fire thought the bottle was a firebomb. Soldiers have
orders allowing them to shoot if attacked with firebombs.
   The name of the boy was not released.
   Israel radio and Arab reports said two other Palestinians,
including a 12-year-old, were shot to death as troops opened fire on
stone-throwing youths in Silet Harthieh, a village near the West
Bank town of Jenin.
   An army spokesman said soldiers opened fire in the Jenin, but
added military investigators were still trying to confirm the deaths
and checking reports of other casualties throughout the occupied
territories.
   The victims in Jenin were identified by Arab reporters as Samer
Mohammed Arouri, 12, and Neman Jaradat, 18, who both were reported
shot in the head.
   Most of the injuries were reported in the Gaza Strip, where
Palestinians staged a general strike to protest three shooting
deaths the day before.
   Palestinian teen-agers blocked entrances to Gaza City with
trucks, rocks and burning tires.
   In an effort to quell the violence, the army confined more than
165,000 people to their homes in five refugee camps and several
neighborhoods of Gaza City, an Arab reporter said.
   Bursts of automatic weapons fire could be heard throughout Gaza
City as soldiers tried to put down rioting, he said.
   In one neighborhood of the city, about 100 youths marched through
the streets waving the Koran, Islam's holy book, and shouting ``God
is great ... Down with the occupiers.''
   Arab journalists compared the intensity of rioting in Gaza to the
early days of the uprising, and an army official said uprising
leaders were testing border police newly assigned to the occupied
territories.
   ``It's primarily a test of the Border Police who have a
reputation for keeping order,'' deputy army spokesman, Col. Raanan
Gissin said. ``They are trying to keep the border Police from
getting more control of the streets than the army reserve units
had.''
   The army has tried to reduce bloodshed in the occupied
territories by replacing untrained reserve troops with Border Police
units, who are experienced in riot control and are permanently
assigned to the disputed areas.
   Among those wounded in Sunday's clashes were 12 Palestinians shot
in the Gaza Strip, including a 13-year-old boy in serious condition
with a head wound, Arab reports said. In the West Bank, six
Palestinians were reportedly wounded when soldiers opened fire on
stone-throwing protesters.

   The Discovery space shuttle
astronauts, back from a five-day mission in which they deployed a
vital communications satellite, spent Sunday with their families but
were to return to work the next day to discuss their nearly flawless
flight.
   The crew's 1.9 million-mile journey ended Saturday morning with a
picture perfect landing at Edwards Air Force Base, Calif., that was
watched by a near-record 460,000 spectators.
   Discovery's flight lasted 4 days, 23 hours and 39 minutes. It was
the 28th shuttle mission overall and the third since Challenger
exploded, claiming the lives of seven astronauts and halting manned
spaceflights for nearly three years.
   The next flight is the planned April 28 launch of Atlantis, which
will deploy a planetary probe that will map the surface of Venus.
NASA hopes to complete seven flights this year and 12 a year by 1992.
   Space agency officials Saturday praised the five Discovery
astronauts and the orbiter as well as the efforts of employees who
have worked to get the shuttle program back on track.
   ``I think the country realizes we're back,'' Rear Adm. Richard H.
Truly, NASA's associate administrator for space flight, said at a
post-flight news conference Saturday at Edwards.
   Truly also said the shuttle ``is just as clean as it can be.''
Although NASA television close-ups showed numerous white marks on
the black thermal tiles that protect the shuttle's underside during
the fiery re-entry through the atmosphere, Truly described them as
``a few minor chips.''
   A little more than seven hours after touchdown, the astronauts
and their wives arrived home in Houston where they were greeted by
their children and about 500 friends, fellow workers and space fans.
   Discovery commander Michael L. Coats, who guided the 97-ton
spaceship to its centerline landing, said his crew worked hard both
before and after blastoff Monday.
   ``I'd like to thank all of you and American people for the
opportunity to fly in space,'' Coats added.
   The other Discovery astronauts are pilot John E. Blaha and
mission specialists Robert C. Springer, James F. Buchli and James P.
Bagian. Blaha, Springer and Bagian were all space rookies.
   ``It was an awful lot of fun being out in space,'' Springer said,
adding that it had been ``a long wait'' for all the crew members.
   After having the day off Sunday, the astronauts are scheduled to
return Monday to the Johnson Space Center to brief other NASA
employees on details of the mission. Discovery remained at Edwards
on Sunday for further scrutiny before being returned to Cape
Canaveral, Fla.
   Just six hours after liftoff from Cape Canaveral on Monday, the
astronauts deployed a $100 million Tracking and Data Relay
Satellite. The deployment, the crew's primary mission, completes a
constellation of three such spacecraft that will enable NASA to have
nearly constant contact with space shuttles and other satellites.
   The new satellite will be operational in a few weeks. At that
point, the space agency will begin closing six ground stations at a
savings of $13 million a year.

   A case echoing themes from last year's
presidential campaign and the political turmoil engendered by the
Vietnam war will be argued Tuesday before the Supreme Court when it
studies a Texas law barring desecration of the flag.
   The justices are being urged by prosecutors to reinstate a
one-year jail sentence and $2,000 fine against a man accused of
burning an American flag at a demonstration in Dallas during the
1984 Republican National Convention.
   The high court is being asked to limit what forms of political
protest are protected by the Constitution's guarantee of free
expression. A decision is expected by July.
   Civil libertarians and artists say laws like the one in Texas
would permit police and prosecutors to suppress a broad range of
dissent.
   Law enforcement officials, with support from conservative groups,
say their target is flagrant, offensive conduct that may threaten
national unity.
   At the center of the controversy is Gregory ``Joey'' Johnson, 32,
of New York City, a member of the Revolutionary Communist Youth
Brigade.
   ``I believe we live in a sick and dying empire that is
desperately clutching at its symbols and attempting to enforce
patriotic allegiance and obedience from the people and suppress
anti-patriotic opposition,'' he said recently.
   Johnson was arrested in Dallas in 1984 following a protest that
ended in front of city hall with demonstrators pouring lighter fluid
on and igniting an American flag authorities said was taken from a
pole outside a bank building. There was trial testimony that the
protesters chanted, ``America, the red, white and blue, we spit on
you.''
   Police said the demonstrators also overturned potted plants and
spray-painted buildings during a destructive march through the city.
   But the only criminal charge was against Johnson for violating a
state law that forbids ``the desecration of a venerated object'' if
that is likely to cause ``serious offense.''
   Police officers who arrested Johnson said they were seriously
offended by the flag burning.
   Johnson said he did not actually douse or ignite the flag,
although he approved the action and gave speeches during the rally.
   He said he was singled out for prosecution because the Dallas
police knew he was a member of the Revolutionary Communist Youth
Brigade.
   Johnson's jury conviction was overturned by the Texas Court of
Criminal Appeals which said ``the act for which (he) was convicted
was clearly `speech' contemplated by the First Amendment.''
   The appeals court did not overturn the law itself, leaving open
the possibility that flag burning in some situations would not
represent symbolic speech and could be prosecuted.
   The Supreme Court's announcement last fall that it would hear an
appeal by the Dallas County district attorney to reinstate Johnson's
conviction seemed particularly timely.
   George Bush, campaigning for the presidency then, was stressing
patriotic values and attacking Democratic opponent Gov. Michael
Dukakis of Massachusetts for vetoing legislation to require that
public school teachers lead their classes in the Pledge of
Allegiance.
   The Johnson case also calls to mind the days of draft card
burning and intense opposition to the war in Vietnam, led in part by
radical left-wing groups.
   But the argument over patriotism and dissent has a longer
history, and laws against flag burning predate this century.
   The Supreme Court in 1943 ruled that the government may not
compel citizens to salute the flag. The justices in 1974 threw out
the conviction of a college student who taped a peace symbol onto a
flag. But they never have decided whether laws against destruction
of the flag are constitutional.
   While many states and the federal government have such statutes,
their enforcement apparently is spotty.
   Rallying to Johnson's support _ while not necessarily agreeing
with his political views _ have been numerous famous artists.
   They have submitted a ``friend-of-the-court'' legal brief in the
case that said laws like the one in Texas permit prosecutors at
their own whim to decide what is permissible dissent.
   The Texas statute could even be applied to ``the work of a movie
actor burning a flag in a movie about the student anti-war protests
of the 1960s,'' they said.
   The brief includes 22 examples, some famous, of depictions of the
flag that may offend some people.
   Groups that support the Texas law say their goal is to prohibit
destructive conduct that threatens the flag as a symbol of national
unity.
   ``It cannot be disputed that the flag is a symbol of national
unity whose physical integrity can be protected by the state,'' said
a coalition headed by the conservative Washington Legal Foundation
here and including Veterans of Foreign Wars. ``To most people, an
assault on the flag constitutes an assault on them as well.''
   But the Texas Civil Liberties Union noted that an inscription
outside the Texas State Capitol in Austin refers to the Civil War as
an attempt by the South, ``animated by the spirit of 1776,'' to
preserve its rights.
   ``Not everyone in Texas or in the United States takes quite that
romantic a view of the Civil War,'' the civil liberties union said.
``But the First Amendment protects the rights of Texas to express
this idea of national disunity.''

<HEAD>Killing of Congressman Underscores Cult of Political Violence</HEAD>

<DATELINE>MANILA, Philippines (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The assassination of a congressman
shows the cult of political violence still haunts the Philippines,
despite President Corazon Aquino's vow to end ``rule by the bullet.''
   Rep. Moises Espinosa, 55, a member of a pro-Aquino party, was
shot to death Friday with two other people after arriving in the
airport in his home province, Masbate, after a flight from Manila
240 miles away.
   No arrests have been reported. But Manila newspapers quoted
relatives as speculating that Espinosa, from an influential
political family, was slain by business or political rivals.
   He was the first congressman slain since Mrs. Aquino came to
power in 1986 after a civilian-military uprising toppled President
Ferdinand Marcos. He was vice chairman of the public order and
security committee in the House of Representatives.
   ``This is something we in public life have to expect in our job,
especially in the kind of politics we still have,'' said House
Speaker Ramon Mitra after the Espinosa killing.
   Mitra was critically injured 16 years ago during a bombing at a
political rally in Manila.
   During a speech in Japan in November 1986, Mrs. Aquino boasted
that her ``people power'' administration had replaced ``rule by the
bullet with rule by the ballot.''
   However, Espinosa is the latest in a lengthening list of
politicians, journalists, human rights lawyers, municipal officials,
and labor leaders slain in unsolved political killings during the
Aquino administration.
   The victims include Local Governments Secretary Jaime Ferrer, who
was gunned down near his home in August 1987. Ferrer became the
first Philippine Cabinet member slain while in office.
   Others are labor leader Rolando Olalia, kidnapped and murdered in
November 1986; leftist leader Lean Alejandro, slain in September
1987; and Vicente Gerochi, a senior official of the Commission on
Elections, who was ambushed near his home last month.
   More than 90 people, including about 40 candidates, were killed
in political violence during the campaign for January 1988 regional
elections.
   About 50 people died in campaign violence before May 1987
congressional balloting.
   The military says such violence was worse during the Marcos
years, and it often blames killings on Communist rebels. Indeed, the
rebels have claimed responsibility for killing hundreds of police,
soldiers and low-level officials in the last three years.
   But many Filipinos believe most killings of politicians have been
the work of political rivals.
   ``If there is an outstanding truism about Filipino political
life, it is this: Politically motivated murder is not meant to be
punished,'' said the independent Philippine Daily Globe. ``In fact,
what exists are the trappings of government without its essence. We
have laws that are all too frequently _ and with total impunity _
violated.''
   Killings of political figures, which grab headlines, also seem to
go hand-in-hand with a general lawlessness that the government has
been unable to contain. Last year, about 3,700 killings were
reported in greater Manila, which has a population of about 8
million.
   The Committee to Protect Journalists reported in Washington last
week that of 26 journalists killed last year in the line of duty,
five were in the Philippines.
   Most of the Filipino journalists slain last year had reported on
illegal gambling and other corruption in the provinces.
   By comparison, war-ravaged Afghanistan registered four killings
of journalists in 1988.

<TEXT>
   Lawrence Duet is one of a dying breed _
the Spanish moss entrepreneur. He makes a living by cleaning and
baling the archetypal Southern moss for sale, but there just isn't
as much call for it as there once was.
   ``This used to be a big business,'' Duet said, ``but there are so
many substitutes for moss today that the demand is no longer as
great as it once was.''
   Spanish moss _ the long, stringy stuff that hangs from trees in
the South _ used to be a common stuffing for mattresses, sofas and
other furniture. Now it's used mainly in flower beds, fish
hatcheries, for making floor mats and in some kinds of furniture,
Duet said.
   ``I do not believe there will ever be a shortage of moss, but I
am not so sure about buyers,'' Duet said. ``It's hard to say what
substitute will come out next.''
   It's a low-tech business in an increasingly high-tech world.
   The harvesters he buys from use almost as little fancy gadgetry
as they used during the Great Depression, when their survival often
hinged on their ability to gather and market moss.
   Raymond Hebert, who began gathering it half a century ago with
his father, remembers that the moss used to hang so low in the trees
that a man could stand up in a skiff and pluck it from the branches.
   ``Today you have to reach for it,'' Hebert said.

<HEAD>House Panel Concludes FAA Lax in Warnings</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Terrorism warnings issued by the Federal
Aviation Administration before the bombing of Pan American Flight
103 over Scotland were largely ineffective and sometimes
``dangerously inaccurate,'' the head of a House subcommittee said
Sunday.
   Rep. Cardiss Collins, D-Ill., chairwoman of the House Government
Operations subcommittee on government activities and transportation,
voiced the criticism in releasing an analysis of 33 FAA security
bulletins issued between Jan. 1, 1988 and Feb. 16 of this year.
   The panel found that at least six of the security bulletins
contained information that may be linked to the Dec. 21, 1988
bombing of the Pan Am plane, which killed 270 people. Investigators
have concluded that the jet was blown up by plastic explosive hidden
inside a radio-casette player.
   ``Regrettably, these and other FAA bulletins were sometimes
untimely, sometimes dangerously inaccurate and almost completely
devoid of effective and specific instructions for countering
possible threats,'' Rep. Collins said. ``Some bulletins recommended
actions that were pointless or even absurd.''
   She added: ``Taken as a group, the FAA bulletins failed to
provide meaningful guidance to airlines faced with the risk of
terrorist attack.''
   The subcommittee focused particular attention on a warning
written on Nov. 17, following the arrest in West Germany three weeks
earlier of members of the Popular Front for the Liberation of
Palestine-General Command.
   The bulletin described a bomb found in the raids _ plastic
explosive secreted inside a radio-cassette player, with a
barometric-pressure detonator designed to explode the device at a
preset altitude.
   According to the subcommittee, that bulletin mistakenly advised
that the PFLP-GC ``has not been known to undertake terrorist attacks
in Europe.''
   A recent Defense Department study said the Palestinian group had
machine-gunned an airliner in Zurich, hijacked two other airliners
bound for European cities and warned in 1986 that ``there will be no
safety for any traveler'' on a U.S. airliner.
   The FAA bulletin said its information about the bomb was based on
``preliminary analyses by West German authorities.''
   ``It is difficult to understand why explosive experts needed more
than three weeks to complete an urgently needed analysis of this
device,'' the subcommittee said. ``Either the West Germans lacked
the required technical skills (which is unlikely) or West German-FAA
communications had serious flaws.''
   Pan Am's response to this and two other security bulletins
prompted by the West German arrests was limited to examining and
X-raying selected passengers' carry-on baggage containing electronic
devices.
   But the subcommittee noted that ``the bomb that destroyed Flight
103 reportedly was carried as checked baggage and, if it resembled
the PFLP-GC version, was specifically designed to thwart normal
X-ray inspection.''
   Another FAA security bulletin, dated Dec. 7, reported that an
unidentified caller phoning the U.S Embassy in Helsinki, Finland,
had said there would be a bombing attempt against a Pan Am airliner
flying from Frankfurt, West Germany, to the United States.
   Flight 103 had originated in Frankfurt, going from there to
London, where it changed planes before heading to the United States.
   The subcommittee report noted that ``at least three FAA security
bulletins ... contained disquieting information involving West
Germany.''
   ``Yet despite the Helsinki warning of a Frankfurt bombing, the
discovery of a radio-casette player bomb, and two attempts to test
Frankfurt airport security, the FAA failed to order U.S. airlines to
take any security measures beyond those already in place,'' it said.

<TEXT>
   Newspapers frequently detail the plight of the
nation's homeless. Aldo White doesn't read the papers _ he sleeps in
them on Third Street.
   White, hardened by years of begging, either is mute or chooses
not to speak. He communicates with fierce brown eyes and with the
cane that props him up on his only leg.
   One tap means ``no;'' two taps mean ``yes.'' When White is asked
whether he will benefit from a city ordinance ordering the opening
of a vacant building to the homeless, he stares down at his stub and
taps once.
   White is one of the thousands of homeless who wander the streets
of the nation's sixth-largest city as officials try to find them
shelter. Their challenge: providing it without jeopardizing
Detroit's economic rebirth.
   The relationship between advocates for the homeless and Mayor
Coleman A. Young frequently has been stormy. Both sides disagree on
the numbers of the city's shelterless.
   Advocates insist there are 10,000 to 60,000 others like White, a
statistic disputed by Robert Berg, Young's press secretary.
   ``That's absurd,'' he said. ``If you go out and check the
shelters, you'll see that most of them are half empty. There's not a
single case this winter of somebody not having a place to spend the
night.''
   The ordinance that went into effect March 10, requiring Young to
designate a vacant public building or rent a private one as a
``warming center,'' is a scaled-down version of a measure that would
have opened 39 downtown buildings to the homeless.
   Young vetoed the more expansive plan, saying it would cost $2
million and threaten Detroit's convention business. The City
Council, which proposed the ordinance, fell short in an attempt to
override the veto.
   The warming center opened last week in a recreation building on
the city's east side. No homeless showed up because word hadn't yet
spread on the streets, the shelter's operators said.
   Meanwhile, community leaders speculated about the impact of
Young's veto on his widely expected run this fall for a fifth
four-year term.
   Theresa Smith, spokeswoman for the Detroit-Wayne County Union of
the Homeless, said her group is urging the homeless it aids to
register to vote.
   Smith knows the anguish of homelessness. A year ago, her landlord
evicted her and her five children after the family couldn't afford
to pay its gas bill.
   ``I went from shelter to shelter,'' she said. ``My family called
me the Shelter Queen. When the mayor says (the original ordinance)
would have cost $2 million, he's admitting there's a terrible,
desperate need.''
   Last week _ while the City Council debated the merits of its
housing plan _ C. Patrick Babcock, who heads the state's welfare
agency, urged officials to set aside part of the $500 million spent
annually on temporary housing in Michigan and invest it in a more
permanent solution.
   Paul Hubbard, director of New Detroit, a coalition aimed at
improving the quality of life in the city, agrees.
   ``Putting the homeless in public buildings doesn't solve the
problem,'' he said. ``Ten years ago, homeless were derelicts with
Army jackets and wine bottles hanging out of their pockets. Now,
they're women and children.
   ``You need permanent public housing. Otherwise, as soon as it's
warm, they're back on the streets again.''
   Young's veto of the original homeless plan probably won't
backfire on him politically because it was replaced by the modified
measure, Hubbard said. ``The mayor sees the need and he's done
something about it,'' he said.

   Israeli troops and allied Lebanese
militiamen traded artillery fire with pro-Iranian Shiite Moslem
guerrillas in south Lebanon on Sunday, and police said six people
were wounded.
   They said the brief exchange flared after a 75-strong armored
Israeli force and fighters of the Israeli-backed South Lebanon Army
entered the village of Dallafeh village, just outside Israel's
self-designated security zone, in search of pro-Iranian guerrillas.
   ``They destroyed two houses in the village, but they didn't find
any guerrillas,'' said a police spokesman, who by custom is not
named. ``As they were pulling out after a four-hour search they came
under fire from guerrillas of the Islamic Resistance.''
   Israeli and Lebanese troops retaliated by shelling the villages
of Dallaya and Yohmor, two miles north of the security zone.
   Three Shiite civilians and three Lebanese militiamen were
wounded, police reported.
   Islamic Resistance is Shiite fundamentalists sponsored by the
Iranian-backed Hezbollah, or Party of God.
   Israel established the six- to 10-mile wide security zone in 1985
when it withdrew the bulk of its army from south Lebanon after a
three-year occupation.

<HEAD>Explorer Plans to Plumb Boston Harbor for 18th-Century Shipwreck</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DANA KENNEDY</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   When Jonathan Blasczak was 12 years old, he read
about an 18th-century French ship that sank in Boston Harbor. Twenty
years later, he has received permission to search for the wreck and
its reputed riches.
   After researching the journals of French soldiers and other
documents, Blasczak, 32, a construction worker from Hopkinton,
believes the ship contains between $50 million and $500 million in
gold coins and other cargo.
   ``It's like reliving a childhood dream,'' said Blasczak, who read
about the Magnifique in an Edward Rowe Snow book, `Shipwrecks Around
New England.' ``Back then, it might not have been that easy to do
but with the technology we have now, it's possible.''
   Last fall, the state Board of Underwater Archaelogical Resources
approved Blasczak's request to search for the Magnifique, a French
vessel that ran aground near the end of the Revolutionary War.
   Blasczak plans to begin initial work on the site within a few
days.
   The 218-foot ship may have been carrying up to 500 soldiers when
it sank in August 1782, said Blasczak. The wooden vessel was
weakened by a tour of the Caribbean where a parasite called the
teredo had eaten away at its hull.
   Blasczak said his research could not uncover whether men died
when the ship sank in less than an hour or if they were ferried to
safety.
   ``The French were very secretive about their navy back then,'' he
said.
   Blasczak said records culled form the Marine Museum in Paris and
the Journals of French soldiers allude to a cargo that may have
included 300,000 pistoles _ French gold coins that were also called
Louis d'Ors.
   Last year, Blasczak and his team dove with a magnetometer, which
detects magnetic metals, and a sonar system, which uses sound waves
to detect objects, and found a large mass they believe to be the
wreck.
   They believe the ship is under 20 feet of water and buried under
5 feet of sand and mud. Blasczak said the currents have changed over
the years and the mud is now washing off the Magnifique, exposing it.
   Victor Mastone, associate director of the state Board of
Underwater Archaelogical Resources, said Blasczak's plan is the
second one involving a search in Boston Harbor, the nation's
filthiest harbor.
   Barry Clifford, who found the wreck of the Whydah off the
Massachusetts coast several years ago with artifacts estimated at
$40 million, has received initial permission to search for the
crates of tea thrown into the harbor during the Boston Tea Party
before the Revolutionary War.
   ``It's like people are just finding out there's a lot out
there,'' said Mastone.
   Blasczak is working with a crew of seven, including three divers.
Robert Cembrola, executive director of the Marine Museum of Fall
River, is in charge of cataloging any items retrieved from the wreck.
   ``I called my best friend from 20 years ago and told him about
it,'' said Blasczak. ``He couldn't believe I was actually doing what
we talked about so long ago.''

<HEAD>Family Of Woman Files $1 Million Lawsuit Claiming Botched Funeral</HEAD>
<DATELINE>FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A family has sued a cemetery for $1
million, claiming that a damaged casket allowed mourners to see the
deceased's foot and a cemetery employee interrupted the funeral to
demand that the rabbi move his car.
   All of this happened at the funeral of Pauline Rosenthal last
year, family members said in a lawsuit filed in Broward County
Circuit Court last week.
   Her husband, Arthur Rosenthal, and her two daughters and their
families are seeking the damages from Menorah Gardens and Funeral
Chapels for putting them through an emotional wringer at the funeral
in January 1988.
   Menorah Gardens funeral director Mark Weissman said through a
spokesperson that he knew nothing about the lawsuit.
   ``It was a terible, terrible thing,'' said Mrs. Rosenthal's
daughter, Linda Zimmerman of Northbrook, Ill. ``We are looking
forward to our day in court.''
   Mrs. Zimmerman and other relatives declined to discuss details of
the case on the advice of their attorney.
   The lawsuit said the grave site was ``prepared in a sloppy and
unkempt manner'' and chairs were filthy and rusty, and the
scaffolding was uneven and covered with artificial carpet.''
   This caused mourners to ``trip and stumble,'' the lawsuit said.
   Pallbearers were supposed to carry the casket from a hearse to
the grave site. Instead, ``slovenly attired and unclean'' cemetery
workers did so until family members insisted on completing the task
themselves.
   During the service, a cemetery worker demanded that the rabbi
move his car from a designated parking area, the lawsuit said.
   When the rabbi continued with the service, the employee wrapped a
chain around the bumper of the rabbi's car and ``a backhoe or other
piece of heavy equipment backed within close range of the
automobile.''
   As the casket was being lowered, it slipped as it was being
placed in a vault. Two lids popped open, exposing the deceased
woman's foot with a white tag attached to it, the lawsuit said.
   The casket would not fit in the vault and the straps supporting
the casket could not be removed without more jarring of the casket
and prying it with iron bars, it said.
   In June, Arthur Rosenthal ordered a tombstone and specified that,
for religious reasons, it should not be placed atop his wife's grave
until Nov. 18. He and one of his daughters asked to see Mrs.
Rosenthal's grave but were told that the original marker had been
chewed up by a lawn mower, according to the lawsuit.
   In September, Rosenthal visited his wife's grave and found that
her headstone was on it, contrary to his wishes.

   Protesters from the environmental group
Greenpeace chained themselves to a pier near Cork on Sunday in an
attempt to prevent the U.S. cruiser Yorktown from docking.
   Police in southern Ireland said about a dozen demonstrators were
involved in the protest and that after some scuffling with police
they were removed.
   The demonstrators continued their protest on the wharf, chanting
slogans and singing peace songs, as the guided missile cruiser
docked.
   Greenpeace said the Yorktown is a nuclear warship, but Robert
White, defense attache at the U.S. Embassy in Dublin, told RTE,
Ireland's national radio network, it was not carrying nuclear
weapons.
   A Greenpeace spokeswoman, Orla Ni Eili, said the Yorktown is
equipped with anti-submarine rockets capable of firing
nuclear-tipped warheads.
   ``The immediate dangers to Cork residents with the presence of
such a dangerous visitor are horrifying, and evacuation and
emergency plans for Cork would not be adequate to deal with an
accident,'' she said.
   The Yorktown arrived for a three-day courtesy visit to Cork.

<HEAD>Left Makes Gains In Municipal Elections</HEAD>

<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Francois Mitterand's governing Socialists
emerged the big winners Sunday in the second round of municipal
elections, winning control of several large cities from the
conservative and center-right parties.
   Early results showed such conservative bastions as Strasbourg,
Mulhouse, Brest, Dunkirk, Orleans, Blois, Avignon and Quimper
falling into Socialist hands.
   Frequently city elections have been used to criticize the
national government, but this year results seemed to confirm the
leftist trend that re-elected Mitterrand last spring and gave him a
leftist majority in the National Assembly.
   ``It is the first time that we have seen a government receive a
powerful, popular encouragement during the municipal elections,''
said Interior Minister Pierre Joxe, a Socialist.
   The second round was required in 832 towns and cities larger than
3,500 where no candidates won more than 50 percent of the vote in
last Sunday's first round.
   Turnout in the ninth election in less than a year was estimated
at between 72 and 73.5 percent.
   A national projection by the TF1 television network showed the
Socialist Party and its allies winning 78 cities with populations
above 30,000, compared to 66 in 1983 municipal elections.
   The Communist Party won mayoral seats in 48 cities, compared to
53 six years ago; the conservative Rally for the Republic won 45 big
cities compared to 47 in 1983; and the center-right Union for French
Democracy won 39 cities as opposed to 41 six years ago.
   The right was losing few municipalities of more than 30,000, but
they were behind in important cities and taking only smaller, less
important ones from the left.
   There was some good news on the right, however. Michel Noir, a
conservative deputy in the National Assembly, defeated a
center-right incumbent in Lyon, France's third-largest city.
   Former President Valery Giscard d'Estaing, now head of the
center-right Union for French Democracy, said the municipal
elections were less ideological than in the past.
   ``The Socialists registered a certain progress,'' he said. ``In
all, France is still divided in two'' between right and left.

   Police using tear gas and rubber
bullets clashed with about 100 youths who threw bottles and rocks in
a protest against Zurich's chronic shortage of inexpensive housing.
   One police car was set ablaze by a gasoline bomb and some store
windows were broken in the riot Saturday night in downtown Zurich,
but no one was injured or arrested, police said Sunday.
   The protest began peacefully but turned violent when police
briefly detained a youth who was caught painting slogans on a wall.
   Police said the riot, the city's worst in recent years, caused
more than $125,000 in damage. It was the third time in a month that
demonstrations against the shortage of low-rent apartments in the
city have become violent.

<HEAD>Report Some Central Committee Members Oppose Gorbachev</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Mikhail S. Gorbachev and other members of
the ruling Politburo failed to win unanimous support as Communist
Party deputies in a new Soviet legislature, Pravda reported Sunday.
   Providing unusual insight into divisions in the policy-making
Central Committee, the Communist Party newspaper said of 641 Central
Committee members and alternates who voted Thursday, 12 were opposed
to Gorbachev.
   Yegor K. Ligachev, reputedly a conservative force on the
Politburo, got the most ``no'' votes of any Politburo member, 78,
according to Pravda.
   The Communist Party and some other public organizations are
entitled to directly choose 750 of the 2,250 members of the new
Congress of People's Deputies. The other 1,500, representing
territorial districts, will be chosen March 26 in nationwide
elections.
   Some Soviets have objected to the provision of the reforms
championed by Gorbachev. They give the party direct representation
in the new assembly, which will chose legislators and elect the
Soviet president.
   The vote by Central Committee members and alternates showed there
is considerable opposition not only to Ligachev, but also to
Politburo members closely linked to Gorbachev. Customarily such
votes are unanimous, but the secret balloting used to chose deputies
may have encouraged some to frankly express opposition to senior
Kremlin figures.
   Alexander N. Yakovlev, said to be Gorbachev's closest adviser,
got 59 ``no'' votes, while the candidacy of Moscow party boss Lev N.
Zaikov was rejected by 25 of those voting. Gorbachev installed
Zaikov as party boss following the November 1987 sacking of Boris N.
Yeltsin.
   Twenty-two people also voted against Vadim A. Medvedev, a
Gorbachev ally named to the Politburo in September 1988 to assume
the ideology portfolio stripped from Ligachev.
   Politburo member Viktor P. Nikonov, who serves as deputy to
Ligachev in the latter's role as chief of the party's commission on
agriculture, received 26 ``no'' votes.
   Along with Gorbachev, the Politburo members who received the
widest support were Nikolai N. Slyunkov, chief of the party's
commission on social and economic policy, with 19 votes opposed, and
former KGB chief Viktor M. Chebrikov, with 13 opposed.
   Prime Minister Nikolai I. Ryzhkov, whose popularity soared among
Soviets when he was named to head a special Politburo commission
directing relief efforts for Armenia's earthquake, received a
broader mandate than Gorbachev with only 10 votes opposed to his
candidacy.
   Of the remaining members of the 12-man Politburo, Ukrainian party
boss Vladimir V. Shcherbitsky and Russian federation president
Vitaly I. Vorotnikov are running unopposed in electoral districts.
Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze's ministerial post bars him
from being a candidate.
   Although Communist Party members proposed 31,000 candidates to
represent the party in the new legislature, the Central Committee
chose to nominate all 100 people suggested by the Politburo for the
100 seats, and then elected all those they had nominated.

<TEXT>
   Bright-eyed innocent-looking babies peer out of
nearly 5,500 photos seized in a fraud investigation. But these kids
are no criminals; their mugs come from two bankrupt photo companies
that collected money for the pictures and didn't deliver.
   Staff members of the Cook County state's attorney's office are
trying to track down parents to deliver the goods. The photos come
from the Sheridan-Peter Pan Studios and American Color Portraits,
both of Chicago, and the companies' photo subcontractors.
   Three years ago, the photo companies declared bankruptcy _ after
collecting money for the photographs, but before delivering them to
waiting parents.
   Most customers were from the Chicago area, but some came from
Indiana, Michigan and Wisconsin, officials said.
   ``It was more than a normal business failure,'' said Allen
Reiffman, supervisor of the prosecutor's consumer fraud unit. ``They
knew they were going out of business. They still signed people and
took their money and their memories.''
   The consumer fraud unit took possession of the photographs last
year after suing the companies, accusing them of fraud.
   ``Now, the only problem is that many parents have moved,'' said
Neomi Hernandez, a state's attorney paralegal. ``We have no way of
tracking them.''
   It took Ms. Hernandez 100 telephone calls to locate three parents
who were still at their present addresses.
   One successful call linked Adam Manring, 4, of Elgin, with his
photo when he was 2.
   ``I knew something was wrong when six months passed without our
getting the photos,'' said his mother, Vicki Manring. ``Then the
studio's phone was disconnected.''
   Gloria Saffold McCall had another story. She had planned as a
gift for her aging mother a family portrait of Ms. McCall's 12
brothers and sisters and her mother's 50 grandchildren and
great-grandchildren.
   It took months to get everyone together.
   ``Peter Pan shot the picture in my house,'' said Ms. McCall. ``We
had to reshoot it again. It was still all wrong.''
   Finally, she said, she had 13 separate family portraits taken for
$1,500. But she never got the pictures.
   Last Thursday, she received one sister's portrait. The rest are
still missing.

<HEAD>New Army Helicopter Unfit For Battle: Memo</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A new high-tech Army attack helicopter has
broken down so many times that one commander complained the craft is
less fit for battle than a 1960s vintage chopper, according to a
report published Sunday.
   In a recent exercise, all 12 of the AH-64 Apache helicopters
involved were incapacitated at least once within five days,
according to internal Army memos obtained by the Los Angeles Times.
   The problems have prompted Rep. John D. Dingell, whose staff
obtained the memo, to call for an investigation by the General
Accounting Office, the investigative arm of Congress.
   ``It is unbelievable that we are fielding overly sophisticated
and outrageously expensive weapons systems for our fighting men
which simply don't work,'' Dingell said in a letter demanding the
probe.
   The Army has received 450 of the AH-64s, manufactured by
McDonnell Douglas Helicopter Co. in Mesa, Ariz., for $13.4 million
each, and plans to buy total of 975, spending $13.6 billion for the
deal.
   Army and McDonnell Douglas officials dispute allegations the
helicopter is a hopeless case and defend its reliability.
   But in the Army memo, Col. R. Dennis Kerr, commander of the 82nd
Aviation Brigade at Ft. Bragg, N.C., was highly critical of the
AH-64, saying that for now at least he'd prefer to fly the AH-1, an
updated version of Bell Helicopter's 1960s-vintage Cobra, which flew
in Vietnam.
   ``I have been a fan of the AH-64 for over a year, but the
aircraft has let me down,'' Kerr wrote to Maj. Gen. Richard
Stephenson, commander of the Army Aviation Systems Command in St.
Louis, whose office was responsible for buying the AH-64.
   ``If we went to war tomorrow, I'd have to recommend taking all of
our AH-1s before we outload one AH-64,'' Kerr wrote. ``We need
helicopters to work for at least the first 72 hours. The Apache has
long way to go to make it to the battlefield. Please help.''
   The AH-64, designed to attack Soviet tanks and other armored
vehicles, experienced dozens of problems in an exercise, including
numerous instances of jamming on its 30-millimeter machine guns,
according to the memo.
   Army records show that the entire fleet of AH-64s has been
grounded at least three times since the craft entered service in
early 1984. Five Apaches have been lost and flight and two more have
burned on the ground.
   But Army officials said that the observation's in Kerr's memo are
not representative of other Army units.
   ``The Apache is a fine airplane,'' said Col. Curtis Herrick, the
AH-64 program manager in St. Louis. ``We are finding that it has
more capability than the designers foresaw.''
   Herrick acknowledged that the craft has experienced problems with
its rotor blades, bearings and compressors, but said solutions have
been found to all the problems.
   Mcdonnell Douglas officials also played down the problems.
   ``There are problems with any new weapon and you don't find out
about some of the problems until you field the system,'' said
company spokesman Rob Mack. ``We have heard both good and bad, but
we have hear a lot of good.''

   Argentina's foreign debt is
unpayable and the country won't reduce the amount it owes until
after the national election in May, the Central Bank president was
quoted as saying Sunday.
   ``We made a payment of $270 million during the last four months
of 1988,'' Jose Luis Machinea said in an interview published by the
newspaper Pagina 12.
   ``After the election, whoever is voted in will have to discuss a
strategy'' with creditor banks, he said.
   Argentina's $59 billion debt is third-highest among developing
countries. Payments on principal have been deferred, but interest
bills are expected to reach $6 billion this year.
   The country currently owes $2.5 billion in overdue payments to
private banks, Machinea was quoted as saying. The Central Bank
rarely discloses the level of foreign reserves, but banking sources
put them at about $2 billion.
   ``The debt is absolutely unpayable, both the interest and the
capital,'' Machinea was quoted as saying.

<HEAD>Search Suspended For Chemicals in English Channel</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHERBOURG, France (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   High winds and heavy seas forced workers
to suspend their search Sunday for containers of insecticide and
other chemicals lost in the English Channel from an Indonesian ship,
authorities said.
   Officials at the Marine Prefecture in this port city said winds
of up to 30 knots made the search impossible.
   In London, scientist Paul Johnston said a huge area of the
channel would be polluted and fish wiped out if one of the
containers holding six tons of Lindane insecticide leaked into the
water. ``It would be an environmental disaster,'' said Johnston, a
research fellow of the Greenpeace environmental organization at
London University's Queen Mary College.
   Police at St. Peter Port, chief town of Guernsey in the Channel
Islands, said the British Ministry of Agriculture alerted police in
the region to watch out for the containers.
   They said the containers were lost March 13 when the 263-ton
Perintis, a former landing craft built in Australia in 1945, sank in
a storm 35 miles northwest of Guernsey.
   The 11 Indonesian crewmen were rescued by helicopter but one died
later. The vessel was bound for Jakarta from Hamburg, West Germany.
   The Agriculture Ministry said a 40-foot container of Lindane
insecticide was located Wednesday but lost the next day by a French
naval patrol boat towing it between the Channel Islands and
Cherbourg.
   French officials said the minehunter La Clia would try Monday to
find the Lindane container, believed to be resting at the bottom of
the channel.

<HEAD>Study Recommends National Parks Reforms</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW HAVEN, Conn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The National Park Service should look
beyond park borders and adopt a regional approach to maintaining the
nation's environmental legacy, according to a study commissioned by
a non-profit conservation group.
   The study, done for the National Parks and Conservation
Association, also urged that funds for the park service be increased
as much as 10 percent and that park managers cooperate with state
and local groups to preserve the 80 million acres in national parks.
   ``We have to give up the notion that park management stops at
park boundaries,'' said John C. Gordon, dean of Yale University
School of Forestry and Environmental Studies, who headed the panel
of experts who made the recommendations.
   ``If you have a grizzly bear range that stretches across two
national parks, six national forests, a state forest and 43 ranches,
you must coordinate your efforts,'' he said. ``We can't solve all
problems simply by buying land.'' The group presented the study
Sunday to Interior Secretary Manuel Lujan Jr. and National Park
Service Director William P. Mott Jr. Park service spokesman George
Berklacy said it ``will be given close scrutiny.''
   ``We generally agree with the commission's conclusions, but it is
a time of very tight budgets. Thus the commission's recommendations
will be weighed against those realities,'' he said.
   Berklacy emphasized that the report was prepared by an
independent panel of experts. ``We are not bound by their findings,
but we certainly will be guided by them,'' he said.
   The 17-member panel examined policies at 49 national parks, in
addition to national monuments, historic sites, battlefields,
seashores, recreation areas, the Statue of Liberty and the Alaska
wilderness area.
   ``The national parks are a uniquely American gift to the nation
and the world,'' said Gordon, an authority on forest biology and
forest management.
   ``We now need a renewed commitment to the parks and a quantum
leap forward in the level of research and management to safeguard
this irreplaceable heritage,'' he said.
   Gordon said it is essential for the park service to educate the
public about conservation. In addition, he said, the parks should be
used to educate the public about toxic waste, deforestation, the
greenhouse effect and the extinction of plant and animal species.
   He cited the National Park Service's handling of last year's
fires at Yellowstone National Park as an example of mismanagement
within the agency. The fires affected nearly half of Yellowstone's
2.2 million acres.
   The park service has had a policy of allowing fires to burn
naturally so long as they don't threaten areas of human habitation.
But Gordon said the agency should adopt ``ecosystem management,'' in
which each area is considered individually.
   For instance, he said, some park ecosystems should be allowed to
burn naturally, but others should not; natural predators should be
permitted to control animal populations in some places but not in
others.
   ``But what this nation should avoid is having all its eggs in one
basket by treating all ecosystems _ inside and outside the parks _
alike,'' he said.
   Gordon's panel pointed to the 1988 agreement involving the Great
Smoky Mountains National Park as a model for others to follow. The
Great Smoky agreement calls for national, state and local agencies
to share data and cooperate in the management of natural and
cultural resources throughout the southern Appalachian region.
   Gordon's group also examined the so-called Leopold Report, named
after a 1963 committee chaired by A. Starker Leopold. That report
put forth the idea of letting nature take its own course, unimpeded
by humans.
   But Gordon said that as national parks face increasing pressures,
it is important for the experts to intervene sometimes.
   ``One of the big problems that still exists in the park service
is that there is a desire to believe that by letting things alone
you keep them from changing. Why people think that happens with
natural systems when they know it doesn't happen with thir own home,
I don't know,'' he said.

   Asia suffered a terrible year of natural
disasters in 1988 stemming in part from environmental destruction,
especially deforestation, according to a U.N. report made available
Sunday.
   The report by the U.N. Economic and Social Commission for Asia
and the Pacific chronicled massive flooding in Bangladesh, Thailand
and Pakistan and drought in China.
   It linked the natural disasters with general environmental
ravages, especially large-scale deforestation.
   ``The phenomena of floods, mudslides, even earthquakes can be
directly related to deforestation,'' the report said.
   The commission, which described 1988 as ``a terrible year,'' said
major environmental problems faced by Asian countries included soil
erosion, loss of deserts and industrial pollution.
   The report was included in an annual survey of the region. It
will be presented at the organization's yearly conference, which
begins in Bangkok on March 27. More than 1,000 delegates are
expected to attend the 10-day meeting.
   The group has urged that development strategies take into account
environmental factors.

<HEAD>Jewish Leaders Gather For A Show Of Solidarity With Israel</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SERGEI SHARGORODSKY</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>JERUSALEM (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Chaim Herzog on Sunday told hundreds
of Jewish leaders from 30 countries that he prayed their conference
of solidarity with Israel would help advance peace in the Middle
East.
   ``You have answered the call to show solidarity with Israel at a
time of stress and hope in which people of Israel face many fateful
decisions,'' Herzog told participants in a forum organized by Prime
Minister Yitzhak Shamir.
   ``Let's pray that this conference will represent a genuine
advance towards peace and political adjustment in this area,''
Herzog said in a speech at the president's residence in Jerusalem.
   Some people in the United States and Israel have criticized the
conference as a gimmick to boost Shamir's hard-line policies before
he makes a crucial trip to Washington next month.
   But some of the 1,100 people who arrived for the three-day forum
said they came to strenghten Israel as it faces the Palestinian
uprising in the occupied lands and international pressure to devise
a Middle East peace initiative.
   The Prime Minister's Conference of Jewish Solidarity begins
Monday.
   ``I don't think it's our responsibility or our business to tell
the Israeli government and people how and what to do. We have been
asked to come here not to ... give direction to policy but to put a
line to all those out there who say we no longer support Israel,''
said Abraham H. Foxman, national director of the New York-based
Anti-Defamation League of B'nai B'rith.
   ``To show that we do stand behind the people, and the state, and
the government, but not specific policies, I think today is more
important than ever before,'' Foxman said in an interview.
   When Shamir, the 73-year-old leader of the right-wing Likud bloc,
visits Washington in April, his hard-line views are expected to come
under increasing pressure from U.S. officials. Shamir has repeatedly
criticized Washington's dialogue with the Palestine Liberation
Organization, insisting it is a terrorist organization.
   He also opposes the American ``land for peace'' formula.
   Shamir on Friday said peace plans he would take to the United
States do not include a territorial compromise on the West Bank and
Gaza Strip, territories occupied by Israel since 1967.
   Three left-wing opposition parties, which support talks with the
PLO and giving away at least some occupied land, were quick to
attack the conference, saying it would not represent the whole range
of Israeli opinion.
   ``The real multifaceted, piercing, dramatic dialogue taking place
within Israel would not be reflected there,'' Yossi Sarid of the
Citizens Right Movement said on Israel Television. ``It is
legitimate that the government seeks ... support, but then you
cannot present the conference as supporting the Israeli people or
the state as such.''

<DATELINE>OREGON CITY, Ore. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A lawyer in the upcoming trial of
members of the Ecclesia Athletic Association charged in the death of
the group leader's daughter says he will attempt to prove that
beating did not cause the child's death.
   ``A pathologist will testify that, in his opinion, some other
things happened that night that may have caused the death of Dayna
Broussard,'' defense attorney Ron Thom said Sunday. ``It was not a
result of any violent act.''
   After five weeks of grilling potential jurors, attorneys are
close to raising the curtain on the trial of four group members
charged with manslaughter in the death of the 8-year-old. The
group's stated aim was to rescue ghetto youngsters through
discipline, but critics say the children were often mistreated,
sometimes even beaten hundreds of times.
   Meanwhile, 51 children taken from the group after the girl died
five months ago remain in foster homes. Two others are living with
relatives. The children were taken from a farmhouse the group was
renting near Sandy, in the foothills of Mount Hood east of Portland.
   There has been no public word from Eldridge Broussard Jr., the
group's founder and self-proclaimed savior of ghetto youth from Los
Angeles, since he ended a 40-day personal retreat March 12.
   Since Feb. 13, four court-appointed lawyers have been questioning
potential jurors four days a week in a mostly deserted courtroom at
the Clackamas County Courthouse.
   The defendants _ Willie K. Chambers, Brian J. Brinson, Frederick
P. Doolittle and Constance Z. Jackson _ sit quietly in the second
row of the gallery, occasionally passing notes to their lawyers.
   Thom said the lawyers were likely to settle on 12 jurors and two
to four alternates in the coming week, and opening arguments could
begin March 27.
   More than 80 jurors have been examined over the last five weeks,
with nearly three of four excused because they had read about the
case or seen television reports on it.
   In the weeks after Dayna Lorea Broussard's death, local airwaves
were flooded with state allegations that Ecclesia children were
routinely beaten up to 800 times with a paddle or electric cord.
   The 36-year-old Broussard made emotional appearances on local
radio and television talk shows. He wept before a national audience
on The Oprah Winfrey Show and pleaded with Winfrey to help him.
   Broussard first accused the media of ``murder in the first
degree'' in his daughter's death. Later, Broussard simply denied
that his daughter was beaten to death.
   He dropped out of sight as jury selection began, and said he
planned to reflect on the group's problems and sort out his own
feelings.
   Broussard formed Ecclesia at the Watts Christian Center in Los
Angeles in 1975, saying he wanted to steer children away from drugs
and crime and to motivate them through tough discipline and athletic
training.
   At one time, he said he wanted to prepare the children to compete
in the Olympics.
   Thom said the defense team had not seen Broussard since he
returned from his retreat. However, Broussard will be called to
testify and is expected to appear, Thom said.
   Although he denied exercising undue influence over members of the
group, Broussard led parents in confrontations with state officials
after their children were placed in protective custody.
   The court-appointed defense attorneys threatened to step aside
when their clients became uncooperative in the weeks after the
killing, but agreed to stay on after Broussard talked to the
defendants.
   The Ecclesia children still in foster homes come from 16
families. Their parents, saying they wanted to protest violation of
their constitutional rights, stopped visiting the children a month
ago, and Bart Wilson of the state Children's Services Division said
the decision was a ``serious impediment'' to efforts to reunite the
families.
   ``Once they ceased visits, that was it,'' Wilson said.
   The children range in age from 9 months to 16 years. Many are in
school, some for the first time, said Alice Galloway of the state
children's agency.
   The trial will be one of the first in Oregon to be televised.
Acting under new rules, Lowe issued a set of strict guidelines
giving television stations limited access to the courtroom.
Newspaper photographers also may be allowed access to the trial.

<TEXT>
   The Christian Democrat and
Revolutionary Febrerista parties nominated presidential candidates
Sunday, refusing to join other opposition parties in a coalition for
the May 1 elections.
   Their actions also ended speculation they might boycott the
elections because the provisional government of Gen. Andres
Rodriquez rejected proposals to postpone the elections and make
major changes in the electoral laws.
   At separate weekend conventions the Christian Democrats nominated
Secundino Nunez, a former Roman Catholic priest, and the Febreristas
named retired economist Fernando Nunez to run for the presidency.
   The elections were called by the government of provisional
President Rodriguez who led the Feb. 3 military coup that ousted
President Alfredo Stroessner, an army general who ruled Paraguay for
nearly 35 years.
   Rodriguez, 65, is the candidate of the governing Colorado Party
and is virtually certain of winning the election against the
splintered opposition.
   The Colorados, in power since 1947, also are expected to retain
control of the national legislature in the balloting.
   The Christian Democrats, Febreristas and Authentic Radical
Liberal Party formed the National Accord alliance to oppose the
Colorado Party.
   The Authentic Radical Liberal Party is to told its convention
March 25-26 and if it decides to participate in the balloting it is
expected to nominate former exile and longtime opposition leader
Domingo Laino for president.
   Laino addressed party rallies over the weekend and spoke of
irregularities in voter registration. He also said there was the
threat of a ``great fraud'' by the Colorados.
   The National Accord had asked the provisional government to
postpone the elections for at least two months, to extend voter
registration, to allow coalitions and not just individual parties to
back a single candidate, and to revoke the law that gives two-thirds
of the legislative seats to the party that wins the most votes.
   Rodriguez' government rejected the appeals to postpone elections
or extend the voter registration period and ignored the other
requests.
   It did remove restrictions that barred the Christian Democrats
and Authentic Radicals from participating and gave all legal parties
access to the state-run media. The Communist Party remained banned.
   Sedundino Nunez, 68, told his Christian Democrats, ``God has
given us the circumstances and the people are urging us to act. We
have to take advantage of the political opening right now.''
   He is a professor of theology and anthropology at Catholic
University and compared his party's participation in the elections
to a ``long walk through a swamp after someone has rescued you from
a deep well.''
   ``But must we wait for an angel to come down and clear the way
for the Christian Democrats to begin to move forward?'' he asked the
party delegates. ``No!'' they shouted back.
   Febrerista candidate Fernando Nunez is 65.

Says</HEAD>

   Discovery returned from its
five-day mission in what appeared to be the best condition of any
space shuttle, with only minor damage to its protective tiles, NASA
officials said Sunday.
   A preliminary examination indicated only 10 thermal protection
tiles will need to be replaced, in contrast to the last shuttle
flight in December when nearly 200 tiles were severely damaged. In
addition, the tires, brakes and engines that troubled some previous
missions performed well.
   ``We need to go back and look (at mission records) but I doubt if
we could even find one that looks this good,'' said Discovery Flow
Director Tip Talone, who coordinates processing of the orbiter for
each flight.
   A day after landing, Discovery underwent processing at the
National Aeronautics and Space Administration's facility as 28 mph
winds, with gusts over 43 mph, churned dust clouds across Rogers Dry
Lake, slightly hampering work on the shuttle.
   Talone, however, expected Discovery to leave on time for its
ferry flight to Florida Friday morning.
   Technicians counted only 82 ``hits'' on Discovery's tiles and
only 15 were bigger than one inch, said Jay Honeycutt, director of
shuttle management and operations at Kennedy Space Center. The
previous shuttle mission ended with 707 debris hits on the orbiter.
   ``This is one of the best yet,'' said Cindy Lodge, a director for
the shuttle tile system that shields orbiters from the fiery
re-entry.
   ``We've had no major damages, there's a few dings ... around the
nose cap, nothing severe at all.''
   Five tiles were damaged when wires connected to a tire pressure
monitor snapped as the right main landing gear dropped, Ms. Lodge
said. Only one of those five tiles will need to be replaced, she
said.
   The two 10-inch wires and printed circuit board from the pressure
monitor were found on the runway.
   Talone said the wires, which run down the landing gear strut,
apparently got tangled and yanked the circuit board out when the
gear came down.
   Discovery landed at 6:36 a.m. Saturday on a paved runway rather
than the hardpan of Rogers Dry Lake for a test of ``moderate''
pressure on the brakes.
   Discovery's brakes were removed shortly after landing and sent to
the manufacturer for inspection. Engineers said ``the brakes looked
the best ever. No signs of any heat; there was no damage
whatsoever,'' Talone said.
   The craft's wheels to Kennedy Space Center for recycling.
   Shuttle brakes were problematic through most of the program until
shuttles were redesigned to steer with the nose wheel rather than
alternate pressure on the main gear.
   ``It's obvious we're starting to turn the corner on the brake
problems,'' Talone said. All the tires looked good, and although one
showed wear, it was not a safety concern, Talone said.
   He added that it looks like Discovery's ``engines came through in
flying colors again.''
   Discovery blasted off Monday from Kennedy Space Center in Florida
and in six hours accomplished its major goal, deploying a $100
million Tracking and Data Relay Satellite.
   On Tuesday the crew had to shut down non-essential lighting and
computers because of erratic flow from a hydrogen tank feeding a
system supplying electricity to the shuttle. Officials considered
shortening the mission by one day, but by Wednesday ground
controllers had solved the problem.
   Talone said the hydrogen tank system would be inspected when the
orbiter returned to Florida.
   Arnold Aldrich, the space agency's National Space Transportation
System director, indicated at a post-landing news conference on
Saturday that the hydrogen tank may not have had a problem.
   ``In the end, I think we've concluded that was not a serious
problem and perhaps no malfunction at all,'' but simply behavior
inherent in a system delivering super-cold material, Aldrich said.
   When NASA is confident the braking and steering system work under
a variety of conditions shuttles might resume landings at Cape
Canaveral. Since 1985, when Discovery blew a tire and damaged
another on the 16th shuttle mission, all landings have been made on
the wide-open lakebed at Edwards.
   Richard Truly, NASA administrator for space flight, indicated at
the press conference that NASA will not soon forego Edwards.
   ``It's a great place to bring the orbiter back to and I think
we'll continue to plan on coming out here for a considerable period
of time,'' Truly said.
   Discovery's flight was the 28th shuttle mission and third since
flights resumed after the explosion of Challenger, which killed its
seven crew members and brought a long suspension of the shuttle
program.
   Discovery's crew, Commander Michael L. Coats, pilot John E.
Blaha, and mission specialists Robert C. Springer, James F. Buchli,
and James P. Bagian, returned to Johnson Space Center in Houston
shortly after touchdown.
   During the mission, they also worked on a variety of experiments,
including growing plants and crystals in microgravity, and
monitoring experiments of the effect of microgravity on development
of chicken embryos and the healing of intentionally injured bones in
four rats.
   The crew also filmed the Earth for a documentary on the effects
of pollution and other environmental damage.

   Only minutes before the
fighting began, a megaphone broke the predawn Sunday silence,
warning a rightist member of the local election board the rebels
were coming after him.
   Then guerrillas of the leftist Farabundo Marti National
Liberation Front attacked, bombing power poles and exchanging fire
with National Guard troops on the rocky edges of this little town of
3,600.
   The fighting went on for nearly five hours, residents said,
ending only two hours before the polls opened at 7 a.m.
   The guerrillas had promised not to attack polling places or
people who wished to vote, but even so the early turnout was light,
poll officials said. Many blamed it on fear.
   ``There is no question that the intimidation of the FMLN is
working,'' U.S. observer William Doherty said. ``The people are
frightened.''
   One of the worst cases of nerves belonged, by his own admission,
to Luis Flores, 33.
   ``I am afraid,'' said Flores, a supporter of the rightist
Republican Nationalist Alliance, or Arena, and an alternate member
of the local election board.
   The guerrillas have denied that they threatened poll workers with
death, but Flores and others said he was singled out.
   ``They said: `Luis Flores, we know your turf. Expect us. We are
coming for you,''' he recalled tensely as mortars thudded in the
distance.
   A few blocks away, on the hilly edge of town, repairs were under
way on modest homes pocked by bullets or damaged by bombed utility
poles, a favorite rebel target.
   A man patching bullet holes in his front door was asked if he was
going to the polls.
   ``If I have time after this,'' he said grimly, gesturing at his
plane and saw.
   Worshippers leaving Palm Sunday mass streamed past polling places
in the own square. Few stopped to vote.
   San Sebastian, which lies in San Vicente province, was only one
of the theaters of battle on El Salvador's election day.
   The pattern was similiar elsewhere, with bombs and bullets
setting nerves on edge in the hours before the voting began.
   San Sebastian, 30 miles east of the capital, reported no
casualties. In Ilobasco, in Cabanas province about 35 miles
northeast of San Salvador, there was death. But people still
streamed to the polls.
   The bodies of two recently killed guerrillas, a teen-age girl and
a young man, lay on concrete slabs in the small open pavillion at
the town cemetery that serves as the morgue.
   People crowded around for a glimpse of the fly-specked bodies.
The two were killed in combat, townspeople said. A few blocks away,
they lined up at 71 polling tables in a central plaza.
   Despite fighting that raged from about 1 a.m. until about 4 a.m.,
the city of 70,000 was not intimidated, Mayor Juan Antonio Rodriguez
Torres said.
   ``We are not afraid to vote,'' he said. ``We are all here.''
   Rodriguez, an Arena supporter, said no election workers had
resigned, despite threats broadcast on rebel radio and flyers
scattered in the streets earlier in the week.
   He said none of the officials were singled out by name as Flores
had been in smaller, more vulnerable San Sebastian.
   Flores said none of the San Sebastian workers had resigned. But
he was badly shaken that the guerrilla had taken the unusual step of
singling him out.
   ``I am afraid they are going to kill me,'' he said. ``Do you know
how one would get to the United States?''

   A man from Yemen has been charged
with illegally exporting 70 tons of elephant ivory worth $9.8
million, a newspaper said Sunday.
   A court also charged Mohamed Sulaiman Alfan Saturday with
unlawfully possessing 853 hippopotamus teeth valued at $224,
according to the Sunday News. Police said Alfan shipped the tusks on
March 7 to Dubai in the United Arab Emirates, according to the news
report.
   If convicted, Alfan faces a possible 14 years in prison under
Tanzania's Economic and Organized Crime Control Act.
   The report did not specify whether Alfan came from North or South
Yemen, both on the southern tip of the Arabian peninsula.
   According to East African conservationists, the United Arab
Emirates has become the major distributing center for illegal
elephant ivory.
   High international prices for ivory continue to fuel widespread
poaching that already has cut Africa's elephant population in half
since the late 1970s, according to a 1987 U.N. Environmental study.
   In January, the government intercepted 184 elephant tusks being
smuggled out of the country by former Indonesian Ambassador Hussein
Joesoef. No legal action was taken against the diplomat, but the
government asked him immediately to leave the country.

   Heavy snow fell Sunday over portions of the Rockies and bitter
cold weather set records in Michigan and Wisconsin, but most of the
nation enjoyed relatively mild, dry weather.
   Ten inches of snow fell at the Park West ski area in Utah, and a
snow advisory was in effect for elevations above 6,000 feet in the
Utah mountains. A snow advisory also was posted for southwest
Wyoming and the mountains of Colorado.
   The tail end of a Pacific storm brought only light precipitation
to northern California, but officials there rejoiced that the
weekend storm had brought vital rainfall to the drought-plagued
region.
   ``Conditions are still far below normal in too many areas to say
the drought is over,'' said Suzanne Butterfield, statewide drought
coordinator for the California Department of Water Resources. ``But
it has eased considerably everywhere, with the exception of the
Central Coast and San Joaquin Valley.''
   Showers and thunderstorms were widely scattered across the
south-central United States, but rainfall was generally not heavy.
Dry weather prevailed over much of the rest of the country and skies
were fair to partly sunny most places east of the Mississippi.
   A cold front in the Southwest brought brisk winds to parts of
Southern California and a wind advisory was posted for desert and
mountain areas. Gusts to 50 mph were reported in the Mojave Desert.
   Temperatures were generally below freezing from Montana through
the Great Lakes region to northern New England, and in the 70s and
80s across parts of the Southwest and Southeast.
   Temperatures around the nation at 2 p.m. EST ranged from 19
degrees at Grand Forks, N.D., to 88 degrees at Tampa, Fla.
   Low temperature records were set in Alpena, Mich., where it was 7
below zero; Green Bay, Wis. (5 below); Marquette, Mich. (11 below);
Muskegon, Mich. (5 degrees); Rochester, Minn. (5 below); and
Traverse City, Mich. (4 below).
   The forecast for Monday included snow over the central high
plains and the Great Lakes, scattered snow showers over the central
plateau and the central Rockies and rain from western Kansas and
northwestern Texas through the lower and middle Mississippi Valley
to the Appalachians. Fair to partly sunny skies were expected across
the rest of the nation.
   High temperatures were expected to be below 50 from the northern
half of the plateau region through the northern and central plains
to New England; in the upper teens to lower 30s from eastern Montana
through the upper Mississippi Valley to upper Michigan and across
northern Maine; into the 70s from southern and central California to
southwestern New Mexico and from southern and central Texas to
Florida and southern Georgia; and in the 80s in south central Texas
and across the Florida peninsula.

<HEAD>Authorities To Test Bones Found At Bundy Burial Site</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CAPITOL REEF NATIONAL PARK, Utah (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Authorities who unearthed
bones and an apparent clothing fragment at a site identified by
serial killer Ted Bundy hope to determine this week whether they
belonged to one of his victims.
   It is not yet clear whether the bones are those of a human being,
Wayne County Sheriff Kerry Ekker said.
   Ekker said the state medical examiner's office will receive the
bones on Monday or Tuesday, and try to determine whether they were
those of 17-year-old Nancy Wilcox, who disappeared from her Salt
Lake City neighborhood on Oct. 2, 1974.
   Forensic testing should be finished by Thursday or Friday, he
said.
   Bundy was executed Jan. 24 in Florida's electric chair. For years
he had claimed he was innocent of all wrongdoing, but in the days
before he died, he confessed to killing at least 23 women in several
Western states.
   In Utah, he said, he had killed eight girls and women. He
identified only three, among them Wilcox, who he said was buried
near Capitol Reef National Park, 200 miles south of Salt Lake City.
   The sheriff also acknowledged that he was conferring with an
unidentified California psychic who claims to be able to pinpoint
the Wilcox burial site.
   ``I'm going to take a long shot. I'm desperate at this point,''
Ekker said. He added that if the medical examiner determines the
bones are not human, no further searches will be conducted.
   The bones, including what Ekker said appeared to be a shoulder
blade, were found by searchers Friday at one of three sites a mile
east of the park. Also found with the shoulder blade-like bone was a
fragment of what appeared to be a tan blouse.
   Bones at the first two sites were believed to be those of animals.
   The blouse ``was deteriorated to the point that it could have
been 14{ years ago'' when it was buried, Ekker added.
   Wilcox was wearing a blouse of unknown color when she
disappeared, Salt Lake County Sheriff's Detective Jerry Thompson
said.
   The other two women Bundy identified among his Utah victims were
Debi Kent, 17, who was last seen alive Nov. 8, 1974, at Bountiful's
Viewmont High School, and Susan Curtis, 15, who disappeared from the
Brigham Young University campus in Provo on June 27, 1975.
   Bundy also gave general directions to the graves of Kent and
Curtis before he was executed.
   The search for Curtis' remains is under way, and law enforcement
officers say they soon will look for Kent's body.

<DATELINE>BELFAST, Northern Ireland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Gunmen killed a Roman Catholic
man in his north Belfast home on Sunday, police said, in what
appeared to be the latest in a series of retaliatory sectarian
slayings.
   The attackers burst into the man's house, shot him at close range
and escaped, police said. Press Association, the British domestic
news agency, identified the victim as 63-year-old David Braniff.
   He was the third person slain in north Belfast in four days, and
his death brings to 24 the number killed this year in Northern
Ireland's battle between Catholic and Protestant extremists.
   On Friday, Catholic civil servant Niall Davies, 42, was fatally
shot at his home, apparently in retaliation for the Irish Republican
Army killing the night before of Protestant Jackie Irvine, 49, shot
dead when two gunmen smashed their way into his house.
   The Belfast Brigade of the IRA, fighting to drive the British out
of the province, claimed Irvine was an active member of an outlawed
Protestant paramilitary group and said there were clear indications
he was involved in recent sectarian slayings of Catholics.
   The latest round of such slayings began Feb. 12 when Catholic
lawyer Patrick Finucane, who acted for clients allegedly involved
with the IRA, was killed by gunmen who stormed his home in north
Belfast.
   An outlawed Protestant paramilitary group, the Ulster Freedom
Fighters, claimed responsibility for his death, saying he was an IRA
officer. His widow denied the allegation.
   The IRA wants to unite predominantly Protestant Northern Ireland
with the 95 percent Catholic Republic of Ireland under socialist
rule.
   On Feb. 14, gunmen killed Sinn Fein councilman John Davey as he
drove to his home in the village of Glenduff 30 miles northwest of
Belfast. No group claimed responsibility.
   On Feb. 16, gunmen burst into a Protestant bar in Belfast and
opened fire, injuring five people. The Irish National Liberation
Army, a Marxist offshoot of the IRA, claimed responsibility.
   On March 8, IRA gunmen shot three Protestants to death outside a
gas station.
   On March 10, gunmen opened fire on two men leaving a Catholic bar
in west Belfast, killing one and wounding another.

   Club-wielding Turkish Cypriot policemen
scuffled Sunday with Greek Cypriot women trying to breach Cyprus'
dividing Green Line to walk to their former homes in the
Turkish-occupied north of the island.
   Nine women were injured and 32 were detained as they tried to
break through a cordon of police and unarmed Turkish soldiers while
Turkish military helicopters buzzed overhead.
   Twenty-one other women and a male news photographer were detained
as about 3,500 protesters tried to cross the line patrolled by 2,000
U.N. peacekeepers. Helicopters of the U.N. force hovered low,
monitoring the women.
   Ten of the detainees were freed in the evening and the remainder
shortly before midnight at the Green Line checkpoint in Nicosia, the
Mediterranean island's divided capital, a police statement said.
   Earlier in the day at Lymbia, 19 miles southeast of Nicosia,
about 1,500 women carrying white flags and banners saying ``We come
in peace'' climbed up the hill to the whitewashed chapel of St.
George that serves as a Turkish Cypriot guard post. About 100
soldiers and policemen prepared to halt the advance.
   A banner hanging from the church said in English, ``Better apart
than dead!''
   About 100 U.N. peacekeepers crested the hill and separated the
Turkish Cypriots from the women. But the Turkish soldiers dodged
behind the U.N. troops and pushed the women down the hill.
   The other group, including 100 supporters from the United States
and western Europe, took over a church in the deserted village of
Akhna, 25 miles southeast of Nicosia.
   Achna has been deserted, except for a garrison, since Turkish
troops invaded northern Cyprus in 1974, ostensibly to protect the
Turkish Cypriot minority after a coup by Greek Cypriot militants
advocating union with Greece.
   The ``Women Walk Home'' march is spearheaded by women among
200,000 Greek Cypriot refugees, a third of the island's population,
who fled the north in the wake of the Turkish invasion. Some 40,000
Turkish Cypriots fled from the south.
   Turkey maintains 30,000 troops in the north, where Turkish
Cypriots proclaimed a breakaway state in 1983.
   The women want to arouse international indignation to put
pressure on Turkey. One of their leaders is Margaret Papandreou, the
estranged American wife of Greek Prime Minister Andreas Papandreou.
   ``The United Nations needs to be pushed. ... They are not doing
enough,'' she said Saturday.
   ``All the women are doing is demanding the right to go back to
their homes, a right which is guaranteed by the United Nations.''

<HEAD>Swallows Make Their Official Return To Mission</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SAN JUAN CAPISTRANO, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   With bells heralding their
arrival, the swallows made their official return to Mission San Juan
Capistrano on Sunday, even though some of the birds were spotted at
least a month earlier.
   Thousands of tourists gathered at the site to get a glimpse of
the birds on their traditional St. Joseph's Day return, which falls
this year on Palm Sunday.
   The swallows were sparse, though, when 94-year-old Paul Arbiso
began his annual rite of tolling the mission courtyard bells at 7:57
a.m.
   ``For the air fare that I paid from New York, I wanted swarms,''
said Colleen Dunn-Holzworth, 21, of New York City, a Rutgers student
who came to Southern California for spring break.
   On Saturday, the 31st Annual Swallows Parade attracted an
estimated 2,000 spectators, said sheriff's Deputy Dennis Duncan.
   First accounts of the swallows coming to San Juan Capistrano on
their spring migration northward date back to 1776. That was the
year Father Junipero Serra founded the picturesque mission as part
of Spain's effort to spread the Roman Catholic faith _ and the
influence of Spain _ in the New World.
   Legend has it that the swallows have failed to arrive in
Capistrano once, in 1935, when they were held up by a storm.
   The official arrival of the swallows wasn't Southern California's
power landing this weekend. That distinction belonged to the space
shuttle Discovery.
   But John and Minerva Esquivel, who moved to Bakersfield recently
from San Antonio, Texas, went out of their way for the event, even
bypassing a hometown turnoff on Highway 58 that would have taken
them right to the shuttle's landing site at Edwards Air Force Base.
   ``We're kind of discovering California. We figured it was either
the space shuttle or the swallows,'' John Esquivel said.
   Despite the high expectations, however, on Sunday television
camera crews had to resort to throwing pebbles at the mission walls
to get the birds to take flight for the proper dramatic effect.
   George Chauncey of Las Vegas craned a home video camera around
and around, looking for at least one good swallow flight to record.
   ``I'm not disappointed. Why be disappointed? I've got my health.
It's nice weather. And I might get some good pictures,'' Chauncey
said.
   At least one bird-watcher said the swallows actually got a
one-month head start on the tourists.
   The first of the birds reached Southern California in February
from their winter homes in Argentina and other South American
countries, said Sandy Wohlgemuth, a birder with the Audubon Society
Los Angeles.
   The birds' numbers at the mission have dwindled in recent years,
and urban sprawl has covered much of the area, but they still find
places to flock, Magalousis said.
   ``Swallow's day is one of those popular things that most bird
watchers don't pay much attention to,'' said Wohlgemuth. ``But you
can't knock it or try to debunk it. After all, how many times does a
bird get in the news?''

<HEAD>Fonda: Rob Lowe Should Run For Office</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Actor Rob Lowe is so good at charming a room full
of women, Jane Fonda says, that ``he should run for political office
someday.''
   In an article about Lowe in the April issue of Cosmopolitan
magazine, Fonda said of the handsome star: ``He's a phenomenon, much
like a young Frank Sinatra in the way he works the women in the
audience ... He'd make a good politician.''
   Lowe, 25, rose to fame as part of the so-called brat pack of
young, new actors in films like ``St. Elmo's Fire,'' ``The
Outsiders,'' and ``About Last Night.''
   He also made a name for himself with a string of romances with
high-profile women like Princess Stephanie of Monaco and Fawn Hall,
ex-secretary to Oliver North, on trial for his role in the
Iran-Contra affair.
   Lowe himself had a few less-than-politic comments on Ms. Hall.
   He told Cosmopolitan he was busy making a film during the
Iran-Contra hearings, ``so I wasn't aware of all the ins and outs
the way I would have been if I'd been reading the papers every day.
I knew Fawn had something going, and I wasn't sure what, but I knew
she was real tall and blond and stuffed documents in her underwear.''
   He added, ``Well, she swears to me she put them in her boots.''
   Lowe said they dated several times and now are just friends.

<TEXT>
   Convicted child-killer Joel Steinberg is one
of 26 New York state lawyers whose clients were awarded a total of
$1 million from a state fund to compensate the victims of
unscrupulous lawyers, the executive director of the fund said Sunday.
   Steinberg's client, Stephen Liss, was awarded $400 from the fund
to compensate him for money he placed in escrow with Steinberg to
settle a lawsuit for his sister, said Frederick Miller of the state
Clients' Security Fund.
   ``Mr. Steinberg has not responded,'' said Miller. ``We sent him a
claim. ... It could very well be he still has the money (in
escrow.)''
   Steinberg was convicted Jan. 30 of first-degree manslaughter in
the Nov. 5, 1987, death of 6-year-old Lisa Steinberg, whom he had
raised with his companion, Hedda Nussbaum. He faces a maximum eight
and one-third to 25-year prison term when he is sentenced on Friday.
   Miller said the missing escrow money was delivered to Steinberg
``shortly before his arrest in connection with Lisa.''
   Steinberg, who was disbarred last year, was one of 26 lawyers _
all now dead or disbarred _ whose clients received awards from the
fund in the last three months, said Miller.
   Every practicing attorney in the state contributes $50 every two
years to finance the Clients' Security Fund, which provides up to
$100,000 coverage to individual clients and $200,000 for estates and
trusts with two or more beneficiaries. Since 1982, the fund has
returned more than $9 million to victims of dishonest lawyers.
   Another award involved the largest loss ever reported to the
fund: the alleged embezzlement of $1.1 million by Manhattan attorney
Peter Schmidt.
   Schmidt, who is believed to have fled the country with his
clients' money, was disbarred in February and is the object of an
international police search, said Miller.
   His client, Constantin Duba of Austria, gave him $1.1 million to
be placed in escrow. The money was to be used to eliminate single
room occupancy restrictions on some New York City real estate so
that maids' quarters could be converted into a penthouse apartment,
said Miller.
   Duba was awarded $100,000, the largest monetary award for
individual clients, Miller said.
   Two other claims are pending against Schmidt, including one
involving more than $2 million, said Miller.

   Eastern Airlines' embattled boss Frank Lorenzo
will not be honored at a Columbia College dinner at which he was to
receive a top alumni award, the school announced.
   The college, an undergraduate school at Columbia University here,
scrapped plans for the annual dinner, which was to be held Thursday,
``because the current emotional climate in the labor dispute between
Eastern Airlines and its Machinists' union makes it impossible to
guarantee an atmosphere appropriate to such a celebratory event,''
according to a statement.
   Asked Friday if there were plans to withdraw Lorenzo's John Jay
Award, which is awarded to prominent alumni for their achievements
and service to the college, spokesman Fred Knubel pointed to the
statement's last sentence, which read:
   ``The board of directors of the Columbia College Alumni
Association will decide on next steps at its fall meeting.''
   New York Newsday reported Saturday that the announcement came
amid reports that a protest was being planned to disrupt Thursday's
dinner, which costs at least $200 to attend.
   About 350 people, including five other award recipients, were
expected to attend. Proceeds go to the John Jay National Scholarship
Program.
   Although most of the outcry focused on Lorenzo's business
practices and the strike _ which began March 4 _ by 8,500 Eastern
mechanics and ground service workers, protest organizers also noted
that while Lorenzo was a student at Columbia in 1959, he was caught
in a ballot stuffing scheme.
   He was barred from ever voting again in a school election,
Newsday said.

   The governing party's candidate won a third term as
provincial governor by a sharply reduced margin Sunday in one of two
elections considered a test of the scandal-embroiled Liberal
Democrats.
   In Miyagi prefecture in northeast Japan, Socialist Party
candidate Shuntaro Honma easily won election as governor Sunday.
Liberal Democratic candidate Kazuo Aichi had withdrawn after
admitting he received more than $60,000 from a company accused of
influence peddling and insider trading.
   Three Cabinet ministers have resigned because of links with the
company, and the scandal and a new sales tax have sent Prime
Minister Noboru Takeshita's popularity to a record low.
   In the final tally of the prefectural election in Chiba, Tokyo's
eastern neighbor, incumbent governor Takeshi Numata, 66, garnered
971,687 votes, while Shoji Ishii, who was supported by the Japan
Communist Party, got 786,238 votes, the Japan Broadcasting Corp.
reported. The voter turnout was 47.3 percent, compared to 30.70
percent in the previous gubernatorial election.
   The prefecture, traditionally a conservative stronghold, elected
Numata in 1985 with 781,000 votes to 271,000 for his opponent, also
a Communist.
   Numata's sharply narrower margin of victory in the election could
indicate trouble for the ruling party in voting scheduled this
summer for half of Parliament's upper house, where it holds 143 of
251 seats.
   Large losses in those elections would endanger Takeshita's
chances in October to win another two-year term as party president
and prime minister. Opposition parties are already calling on
Takeshita to resign.
   In the Miyagi race, a final tally showed that Honma, 49, received
502,372 votes, compared to 140,979 for Seiki Suzuki, a conservative
independent, and 125,016 for Yoshiaki Shoji, who was supported by
the Communist Party, the Japan Broadcasting Corp. said.
   The voter turnout was 49.56 percent, the lowest turnout in a
prefectural gubernatorial election since the end of World War II.
Voter turnout in the 1985 election was 50.40 percent.
   Recruit Co., an information conglomerate, reportedly offered
hundreds of thousands of unlisted shares in a real-estate subsidiary
at bargain prices to more than 150 influential people, including
politicians and businessmen. Recipients reaped handsome profits by
selling the shares after public trading began.
   Prosecutors have arrested a dozen people in connection with the
scandal.
   The Liberal Democrats were stung at polls last month, when they
lost a parliamentary by-election in Fukuoka prefecture to a
candidate representing their strongest rival, the Socialist Party.
   A poll published Saturday by Asahi Shimbun, Japan's second
largest newspaper, showed support for Takeshita plunged to 15
percent, his worst rating and the third-lowest level in postwar
history.

<HEAD>Once Again Gas Prices Top Off Over the Dollar Mark</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The average price of gasoline topped off over
the dollar mark for the second time this month, an industry analyst
said Sunday.
   On March 17, the national average price of gasoline for the past
two weeks was 100.37 cents a gallon, including all grades, types of
service and taxes, said the analyst, Trilby Lundberg.
   The jump reflects a month-long trend in increases at the pump and
the result of rising wholesale prices. According to the recent
nationwide survey, the retail price of gasoline was up 1.05 cents a
gallon since March 3, Ms. Lundberg said.
   A rise in both crude oil and refined products caused wholesalers
to raise prices, which in turn caused retailers to pass the increase
on to customers, she added.
   Self-service prices on March 17 were 90.09 cents per gallon for
regular unleaded, 106.24 for premium unleaded, and 87.72 for regular
leaded.
   Full-service prices were 118.72 cents per gallon for regular
unleaded, 130.08 for premium unleaded and 115.13 for regular leaded.

   Gun manufacturers should follow the example of
Colt Industries Inc. and stop nonmilitary sales of semiautomatic

   ``I thought that was a very courageous action on the part of
Colt. Guns are dangerous, law enforcement is suffering because of

officer dies every 57 hours in this country,'' said Lawn.
   But Attorney General Dick Thornburgh and the new drug czar,
William Bennett, said they did not think the government should call
for private manufacturers to stop retail sales of semiautomatic
weapons.
   Colt announced that it was suspending sales of its AR-15
semiautomatic rifle starting last Thursday, the day after President
Bush decided to ban temporarily the import of foreign-made assault
rifles.
   Bennett and Thornburgh called for debate on whether the federal
government should ban all nonmilitary sales of semiautomatic weapons
or urge private companies to voluntarily suspend sales.
   ``As an official of the federal government, I don't want to speak
in such ways that suggest that I'm pushing them in any direction or
another,'' Bennett said on the NBC-TV program, Meet the Press.
   But he added: ``I think we can make the case that we don't need a
whole lot more assault rifles on our streets right now.''
   Bennett and Thornburgh said a comprehensive solution was needed.
   ``If we think that the only way to deal with the drug problem is
to ban a particular type of weapon, we're dead wrong,'' Thornburgh
said on the ABC-TV program, ``This Week with David Brinkley.''
   Wayne LaPierre, a spokesman for the National Rifle Association,
said he opposed any ban on assault weapons and advocated stiff
mandatory jail sentences for anyone convicted of using a weapon in
the commission of a crime.
   Addressing the issue of drug use in nation's capital, Bennett
said he had not yet decided whether to declare the federal district
a ``high intensity drug trafficking area,'' enabling him to assemble
a government strike force to fight drug dealing in Washington.
   As of Sunday, 118 murders had been reported in Washington so far
this year, a record rate, and police say that nearly all are
drug-related.
   The Washington Post, quoting unidentified Bennett aides, reported
in its Sunday editions that the strike force would target repeat
drug offenders, try to shut down the city's 90 open-air drug
markets, and use abandoned military facilities as temporary prisons
for drug offenders.
   ``We did not declare Washington a high-intensity drug-trafficking
area,'' said Bennett. ``We are looking at whether we should do that
or not.''
   Bennett said, ``Several mayors wrote to us and said, `We, too,
want to be high-intensity drug trafficking areas.'
   ``People need to be careful before they seek that designation,''
said Bennett. ``This is not a good thing to be. Maybe some
additional federal assistance will be available once this
designation occurs, but in many ways, it's an admission that the
city has failed to conduct its business in a way that can keep it's
streets safe for the citizenry.''
   Bennett, asked whether he was bothered by allegations that
Washington Mayor Marion Barry was involved with cocaine, replied,
``Well, sure it troubles me. I think it troubles everybody.
   ``If you've got all these allegations going around, it hurts the
credibility of Washington. But I don't think we have to be so dainty
as to say, `Well, if we have disagreements or problems with the
mayor, we're going to ignore the city.''
   Barry was asked on ABC whether he used drugs.
   ``Absolutely not,'' he said. But he brushed aside persistent
questions about whether he would resign, saying, ``The issue is not
Marion Barry.''
   Thornburgh declined to discuss allegations against Barry, saying
``those are all matters that are under investigation by the United
States Attorney's office in Washington and, obviously, I'm not going
to comment on them.''
   Barry urged federal authorities to use force against Latin
American nations that produce illegal drugs.
   ``The national government needs to go to these five or six
countries in South and Central America, send the Army, the Navy, the
Air Force, the Coast Guard _ burn up those fields, eradicate those
coco leaves ... blow up those labs, stop it at the source,'' Barry
said.
   After the broadcast, Barry told reporters that if a federal
strike force is sent to Washington, ``I wonder what they are going
to do.''
   ``If he (Bennett) thinks these murders are going to be curbed by
more federal police, then more power to him,'' Barry said.

<HEAD>Party Leader Says Poland Faces Historic Challenge, But Warns Of Subversion</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WARSAW, Poland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Communist Party leader Wojciech Jaruzelski
told a regional party meeting that Poland has a historic chance to
evolve its system by introducing a ``socialist parliamentary
democracy,'' in a speech televised Sunday.
   But Jaruzelski, speaking to party activists in the southern city
of Katowice on Saturday, said the party must be prepared to face
challenges for political power from the opposition.
   In the speech published by the state news service PAP and shown
in part on state television, Jaruzelski argued that such competition
could be healthy but that the party would ``show vigilance'' against
those who seek to undermine the political system, public order,
state institutions and the economy.
   A week ago, Jaruzelski made a similar speech to Warsaw party
activists. The speeches seemed directed toward averting any revolt
among lower- and middle-level party activists, some of whom are
extremely wary of Jaruzelski's proposed pact with the opposition.
   Jaruzelski, first secretary of the Polish United Workers
(Communist) Party, spoke to a conference of the 240,000-member party
organization of the heavily industrialized Silesia region.
   It is the largest regional party organization in the country and
considered a bastion of hard-line opposition to reform within the
party.
   Silesia's party-controlled mining and steel industries are
criticized by economic reformers as being unprofitable and for
consuming a disproportionate share of Poland's resources.
   Jaruzelski defended his own moves toward economic and political
reform and the decision to negotiate with the opposition at
broad-based ``round-table'' talks, which began Feb. 6 and are to end
April 3.
   Authorities hope the talks will guarantee social stability so
that planned economic reforms can work. So far they have yielded
general accord on several key points _ legalizing the banned
Solidarity trade union federation, allowing a 35 percent opposition
bloc in Parliament and having fully free elections for a new senate.
   Jaruzelski told the Katowice audience the party is trying to
create ``a correct model of socialist parliamentary democracy and
political and trade union pluralism.''
   ``The future of what we, as the first ones, have decided to
introduce depends on proving that the presence of the opposition in
political and social life does not give rise to confrontation but
yields sound competition,'' he said.
   Jaruzelski said it was logical that the opposition would strive
for power. But he added: ``We will show the necessary vigilance and
firmness'' toward those who struggle against the political system or
try to undermine state institutions.

<TEXT>
   A blind escaped murderer was shot to
death and his partner captured early Sunday when police stormed a
townhouse and freed two children who had been held hostage for more
than a day.
   The blind fugitive, Larry Hill, was holding a knife to the throat
of 6-year-old Cameo Platt when police shot him in the face,
authorities said. The girl and her brother, 8-year-old Dominic, had
been held hostage since Friday afternoon at their home in this
Minneapolis suburb.
   ``The children seemed perfectly fine when we found them,'' police
Capt. Terry Cook said. ``They cried and said they missed their
mother.''
   Hill's accomplice, Willie Johnson, was taken into custody, police
said. He suffered a minor injury and was treated at a hospital
before being jailed, police Chief Lloyd Rivers said.
   Hill escaped from Stillwater State Prison outside St. Paul on
Friday morning while being escorted by two guards to a medical
office, where he had an appointment to get a replacement glass eye.
   Johnson, wearing a Halloween mask, met Hill at the office and the
two men disarmed the guards, tied them up and fled, police said.
   They then went to the townhouse of Lois Platt, the children's
mother, who had corresponded with Hill in prison. Her sister-in-law,
Peggy Platt, said Lois Platt broke off the relationship more than 18
months ago when she discovered Hill had been convicted of strangling
his girlfriend.
   Peggy Platt said she didn't believe the two had ever met face to
face before Friday.
   Hill, 49, was sentenced to 27 years in prison for second-degree
murder in 1982 and had prior convictions for two counts of rape, as
well as robbery, criminal sexual assault, burglary and illegal
handgun possession, according to Tom Dowdle, associate warden at the
Stillwater prison.
   LeRoy Siegel, assistant to the warden that the Stillwater prison,
said Hill's medical records indicate he became legally blind in the
early 1980s as a result of glaucoma. His vision later grew
progressively worse, officials said.
   Police identified Johnson, his accomplice, as a former Stillwater
inmate who served a five-year sentence for aggravated assault. He
was returned to prison for violating parole but was released in
January.
   Police negotiated with the men throughout the day Saturday as
more than 100 SWAT officers ringed the building. Apple Valley police
were joined by officers from surrounding communities, state and
county agencies and the FBI.
   ``Basically, they said they had to be allowed to leave. If they
didn't, they were going to throw a dead child out,'' Cook said.
   At one point, police seized Lois Platt when she was sent by the
the two men to start a car in what authorities described as an
escape attempt. Cook said she struggled with officers when they
refused to allow her to return to her children.
   Platt was taken to a hospital for treatment of exhaustion and
stress. She left the hospital late Saturday night and went to a
relative's house, Rivers said.
   Finally, at 1:30 a.m. Sunday, police decided to storm the
building when one of the children came out to pick up soft drinks
that authorities had sent to the townhouse, Cook said.
   Police threw at least two stun grenades into the house and a
special weapons and tactics team went in.
   ``We basically had a hard decision to make as to when the best
opportunity would present itself and we had to be ready to go when
it did,'' Cook said. ``As you know, we were dealing with some very
desperate men. It was unacceptable to allow the men to leave with
the children.''

<TEXT>
   The dissident Palestinian Fatah-Uprising
guerrilla group threatened Sunday to assassinate Palestinians who
make direct contact with Israeli leaders.
   In a statement sent to The Associated Press, Fatah-Uprising
particularly mentioned people ``considered by the enemy close to the
Palestine Liberation Organization.'' It gave no names in the threat,
which apparently was designed to jeopardize PLO chief Yasser
Arafat's peace initiative.
   Fatah-Uprising, a Syrian-backed group led by Col. Saeed Mousa,
broke away from Arafat's mainstream Fatah movement in 1983.
   Its statement said that as the 15-month-old Palestinian uprising
in the Israeli-occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip continues ``some
Palestinian personalities are conducting contacts and meetings with
the enemy which may lead to disastrous results.
   ``We consider these meetings an attempt to liquidate the
uprising. Therefore, we stress that the guns of the Palestinian
revolution will put an end to the life of anybody who may be tempted
to abuse the destiny of the Palestinian people and its sacred
cause,'' said the statement signed by Mousa's deputy, Khaled
al-Omlah.
   On Friday, Arafat spokesman Bassam Abu Sharif said several
Palestinians have been meeting with the Israelis.
   In an interview with the Paris-based Arabic Radio Monte Carlo he
named Gaza lawyer Fayez Abu Rahme; Elias Freij, mayor of Bethlehem;
Hanna Siniora, editor of a Palesinian newspaper, and Faisal
Husseini, recently released after months of detention by Israel. Abu
Sharif said the four were not PLO members but were in contact
Arafat's movement.
   Guerrillas of Fatah-Uprising infiltrated Israel from southern
Jordan on Friday in another bid to torpedo Arafat's peace efforts.
Jordan said its security forces later arrested the guerrillas.
   Arafat in December renounced terrorism and recognized Israel in
an attempt to open negotiations with the Jewish state, but Israeli
leaders so far have rejected his overtures.
   Arafat told the Italian newspaper La Repubblica last week that he
is willing to go to Jerusalem to pursue peace talks provided he gets
``full consent'' from Arab countries.
   The announcement drew sharp criticism from Fatah-Uprising and the
Damascus-based Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine-General
Command, which described Arafat as ``a traitor and an imperialist
agent.''
   Another guerrilla group, the Democratic Front for the Liberation
of Palestine, called on Arab countries Sunday to exert ``extreme
pressure'' on the United States to accept the establishment of a
Palestinian state.
   In a statement sent to The Associated Press in Nicosia, Cyprus,
it said its Politburo member Hisham Abu-Ghosh made the call at a
rally in Tripoli, Libya. The rally marked the 20th anniversary of
the Marxist group, a member of the PLO.
   The statement referred to the expected resumption of talks
between U.S. representatives and the PLO and said: ``The dialogue
between the PLO and the U.S. administration is not an end in itself.
   ``The Americans have to stop prevaricating in Israel's favor and
accept convening an international peace conference as a viable
framework for settlement,'' it said.

<HEAD>Genius Computer Hacker Now Living On The Streets</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SAN DIEGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Federal agents said William Troy Landreth could
once crack into the computer networks used by the Department of
Defense and NASA. But now, awash in waves of emotional depression,
he lives in the streets.
   The 24-year old computer whiz with a genius IQ, who as a
teen-ager was the target of a highly publicized FBI crackdown on
computer hackers, now spends his days on park benches and his nights
in shelters and concrete doorways.
   Known at the height of his fame by his code name ``The Hacker,''
Landreth has all but dropped out of society, saying mood-altering
drugs and antidepressants couldn't ward off the depression that has
dogged him.
   But Landreth said in an interview with the Los Angeles Times that
he remains confident in his ability to control computers, and could
make lots of money using his talents. But he said he must live by
his own rules.
   ``I could set up a data base system for a company and walk away
with a few thousand dollars for five or six hours work, and they'd
never regret it,'' he said. ``The five or six thousand for five or
six hours of work would interest me, but I haven't fallen for it.
   ``I didn't inherit a great deal of money that's been accumulating
for several eons, so I wouldn't know how to look at money,'' he said.
   Landreth gained notoriety in 1983 when the FBI cracked down on
him and other hackers.
   With an IQ measured at 186, well into the genius category,
Landreth was accused of breaking into the Virginia-based GTE
Telemail electronic mail network to take a look at computer
correspondence from the Defense Department and National Aeronautics
and Space Administration.
   Landreth eventually pleaded guilty to one count of wire fraud,
was fined $87 for using computer time he didn't pay for and was
placed on three years' probation.
   During his legal problems, Landreth appeared to be in control of
his life, giving lectures to business executives, doing freelance
computer work and promoting a book about his experiences, ``Out of
the Inner Circle,'' which has sold about 68,000 copies.
   But in September 1986, Landreth disappeared, leaving behind a
rambling, eight-page essay touching on such subjects as man's
evolution and immortality, communism and capitalism, nuclear war and
greed, and suicide.
   ``I was bored in school, bored traveling around the country,
bored getting raided by the FBI, bored in prison, bored writing
books, bored being bored,'' read the last page. ``I will probably be
bored dead, but this is my risk to take.''
   Landreth drifted for almost a year, turning up in the Oregon town
of Minnville, near Portland, where he was arrested for violating his
probation.
   He was sent back to San Diego, where he found that he had about
$9,000 waiting for him in book royalties from foreign sales. He
rented an apartment, but it burned down. He eventually landed on the
streets.
   ``The way I see it, I could be retired in five or 10 years, if I
did things in a constructive way,'' he said. ``But I haven't decided
to do that.''
   He prefers, for now, to live by his own definition of freedom,
even though he knows some of his friends and family think he's
wasting his life.
   ``I don't know what (freedom) is good for any more than anyone
else knows what it's good for,'' he said. ``So it's really in how
you look at it.''

<TEXT>
   Demands for an independent inquiry into Britain's
handling of warnings received before the bombing of Pan Am Flight
103 will grow until the government explains its actions, an
opposition party leader said Sunday.
   Also Sunday, the government acknowledged that a December warning
about possible bombs on airliners was not mailed until after Jan. 1
_ at least 11 days after the Pan Am jet blew up and crashed, killing
270 people.
   ``We cannot afford `bag it and bin it' policies of British
official secrecy on matters of security which affect every air
traveler across the world,'' said Paddy Ashdown, leader of the
centrist Social and Liberal Democratic Party.
   Transport Secretary Paul Channon ``must come clean on all the
circumstances surrounding the advance warning,'' Ashdown said in a
statement.
   ``Unless he comes to the House of Commons at the earliest
opportunity next week and is competely candid in every detail, the
demand for an official inquiry on both sides of the Atlantic will
become irresistible,'' he said.
   Those demanding an independent inquiry include the opposition
Labor Party and relatives of those killed when Flight 103 exploded
over Lockerbie, Scotland, Dec. 21 on a flight to New York.
Investigators say the disaster was caused by a bomb concealed in a
radio-cassette player packed in luggage in the plane's hold.
   Channon said Sunday he told Parliament ``as much as it is in my
power to tell.'' Government ministers ``should not go around
revealing things that might be against the national interest,'' he
told the British Broadcasting Corp.
   Channon said he welcomed U.S. Transportation Secretary Samuel
Skinner's decision to send top aides to London and Frankfurt, West
Germany, to assess aviation security. Skinner said he wants his
officials to determine, among other things, when and how warnings
were made against Pan Am flights last year.
   ``The investigators have been working extremely closely with the
Americans at all stages, and I think if they come over here, and the
investigators have further talks with them, that can only be a very
good thing,'' Channon said.
   ``There is keen public concern in the United States and in this
country about the progress of this investigation and it's not
surprising that people should wish to come over and have further
talks.''
   The Transport Department confirmed last week it prepared a
warning dated Dec. 19 that included photographs of a bomb hidden in
a radio-cassette player but did not mail it until after Christmas.
   But on Sunday, a department spokesman said the warning was not
sent until the New Year because the accompanying photos had to be
prepared. The spokesman, who demanded anonymity, did not give the
exact date of the mailing.
   Channon has said the letter was of little importance because
similar information had been sent out a month earlier by the U.S.
Federal Aviation Administration and by West Germany. Flight 103
originated in West Germany and changed planes at London's Heathrow
Airport before setting out for New York.
   Two London newspapers, The Observer and The Sunday Telegraph,
reported Sunday that the Dec. 19 warning carried several important
details that would have helped security people spot a rigged
radio-cassette player.
   Another London newspaper, the weekly Sunday Express, reported
that the man who made the bomb is a Libyan known to international
security officials as ``The Professor'' because of his knowledge of
explosives.
   The Sunday Express attributed its information to unidentified
detectives. It did not identify the man by name.
   The Express also said a Lebanese student, 21-year-old Khalid
Jaafar, of Dearborn, Mich., unwittingly carried the bomb onto the
flight in a radio-cassette player given to him as a gift. It did not
say who gave it to him.
   The FBI has questioned Jaafar's father, Nazir, who has denied
earlier reports in U.S. and British newspapers that his son may have
brought the bomb on the plane without knowing it.
   Also Sunday, ABC News reported that the bombing of Flight 103 was
surrounded by serious mistakes in security at Heathrow Airport. The
network said it obtained a memo from the British Transport
Department dated Dec. 29 which conceded that baggage coming from
Frankfurt was transferred directly to the jet headed for New York
without being screened.
   The memo also said a passenger arriving late at the departure
gate was not allowed to fly to New York, but his baggage stayed on _
a violation of security rules. The memo did not say who the
passenger was or give other details, ABC said.

<DATELINE>WEST ORANGE, N.J. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A gunman who killed one child and
wounded two others had a history of mental problems and was a target
of frequent harassment by adolescents in his suburban neighborhood,
according to neighbors and police.
   The gunman, George Proctor, was shot and killed by a police
officer Saturday night after he went on the shooting spree in this
bedroom community about 10 miles west of New York City.
   Eight-year-old Kareem Davis remained in critical condition Sunday
with a gunshot wound to the head, according to Bob Arnold, associate
administrator of University Hospital in Newark.
   A second child, 12-year-old Joshua Velez, was listed in stable
condition and transferred Sunday to Children's Hospital, Arnold
said. Velez also was shot in the head and the wound threatens his
eyesight, authorities said.
   Inside the building where he lived, Proctor shot 9-year-old Ivory
Smith, who died Saturday night from her injuries, authorities said.
   Proctor then emerged and began firing his .32 caliber gun,
witnesses said.
   Both Velez and Davis were outside the building and were hit by
shots from Proctor's gun, police and witnesses said.
   Police Officer Thomas Smith, from the adjacent town of Orange,
was on a routine patrol at the border of the two towns when he heard
the shots.
   He exchanged fire with Proctor, who was hit with four rounds,
West Orange Police Chief Edward Palardy said.
   ``He (Smith) will definitely receive a letter of commendation
from my office for his actions,'' Palardy said.
   Smith was released from Orange Memorial Hospital on Sunday after
being treated for a grazing gunshot wound on the head, Palardy said.
   Proctor, 60, was a frequent target of harassment from older
teen-agers in the area, according to neighbors.
   ``Just prior to the tragedy, two young men threw stones at his
car,'' Palardy said, adding that the victims were not involved in
the incident.
   Proctor was a long-time resident of the neighborhood who worked
as a janitor at Union County College. He was hospitalized for nine
years for mental instability, according to the police chief.
   ``His family said he had emotional and mental problems,'' Palardy
said. ``I'm not sure of the specifics but they said they were
serious.''
   Palardy said he did not know when the man had been released.
   Proctor had no prior criminal record, but the gun he used
Saturday was not registered, Palardy said.

   A pilot who failed to make a turn flew his
aircraft into a snowfield at the 12,500-foot level of Mt. Rainier,
authorities said. He was presumed dead in the crash.
   The pilot, William E. Saul, 54, of Wenatchee, requested the turn
while flying on instruments and acknowledged that clearance was
given, said Mike O'Connor, regional duty officer with the Federal
Aviation Administration.
   However, O'Connor said, flight control officials noted that
Saul's Cessna 210 did not turn as it approached the mountain 55
miles southeast of Seattle on Saturday.
   ``We attempted to contact the aircraft to see what the problem
was. We could not establish radar contact after that,'' he said.
   O'Connor said a search was started immediately and the plane was
found Sunday morning by a Civil Air Patrol aircraft.
   Because of hazardous conditions on the mountain, National Park
Service officials decided recovery of the pilot's body would have to
wait, said Cy Hentges, spokesman for Mount Rainier National Park.
   O'Connor said the weather was not bad at the time of the crash.
   Saul had taken off from Seattle's Boeing Field and was on his way
to Wenatchee, about 100 miles east of Seattle.

   Eastern Airlines went shopping Sunday for the new
pilots it needs to survive a crippling strike now in its third week.
   ``We've waited patiently for the pilots union to come to its
senses,'' Eastern spokesman Robin Matell said as an advertisment was
run in Sunday's Miami Herald appealing for pilots to ``be part of
the new Eastern.''
   The ads will begin running Tuesday in other major newspapers
across the country, Matell said.
   The ads promise an ``outstanding opportunity for the very best,''
and try to put the best light on the strike, telling pilots to
``also understand that this is an unprecedented opportunity for
growth and success.''
   Matell said Eastern is not lowering its requirements for
experience and is offering the same wages and benefits that pilots
have been getting under Eastern's contract with the Air Line Pilots
Association.
   Only about 200 of 3,600 Eastern pilots are flying in the
Machinists union strike that began March 4, and Eastern acknowledged
earlier it will live or die on its number of pilots. Eastern is
operating under 10 percent of its pre-strike schedule of 1,040 daily
flights.
   It takes at least six weeks to train a pilot who is new to an
airline, and Eastern _ whose daily losses are in the millions _ may
run out of cash within a few months. On March 9, the airline filed
for protection from creditors under Chapter 11 of federal bankruptcy
law, and insists it will keep flying with a smaller, cost-effective
operation.
   Pilots union spokesman J.B. Stokes said the advertisements are
aimed as much at picketing pilots as at new hires.
   ``It's twofold,'' Stokes said. ``They want to test the
marketplace, and they also want to try to frighten our pilots into
thinking they're being replaced. They should have learned by now
that intimidation isn't going to work.''
   ``They're going to be disappointed,'' Stokes predicted. ``There
isn't a pool of pilots out there.'' Stokes said other major carriers
are hiring pilots and offer better working conditions and long-term
stability.
   Matell said Stokes was engaging in ``ALPA propaganda.'' He said
Eastern had received more than 100 unsolicited resumes from
qualified pilots before the ads began running.
   In New York, ALPA lawyer James Linsey said the union probably
would challenge any hirings before U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Burton
Lifland, who must approve most of Eastern's expenditures.
   ``All transactions outside the normal course of business need his
approval,'' Linsey said. ``Hiring a new work force is certainly not
in the normal course of business. We'll certainly litigate that at
the appropriate time.''
   Eastern reported light loads on its Northeast shuttle flights
Saturday and Sunday. Fares were back to the normal $69 weekend rate
after the previous weekend's promotional $12 fare helped Eastern
pack about 62 flights daily between New York, Boston and Washington.
Some passengers got stranded at airports last weekend because return
flights were sold out.
   Matell said Eastern was encouraged by last week's weekday shuttle
service _ offered at a discount $49 a ride _ because it attracted
many of the business people who most frequently use the shuttle. The
weekday rates return to their normal $99 this week.
   Mattell added that Eastern's Latin American routes are seeing
steadily increasing loads.
   He declined to comment on a threat Saturday by Teamsters union
leader William F. Genoese to organize a sympathy walkout at Pan
American World Airways concentrating on the Pan Am Northeast shuttle.
   Pan Am spokeswoman Pamela Hanlon said the company, which has
boosted its Northeast shuttle service during the strike, doesn't
expect a Teamsters walkout. ``We believe our employees aren't
inclined to take any kind of job action,'' she said.
   Genoese met in Miami over the weekend with Eastern Machinists
leader Charles E. Bryan to discuss strategy, including a joint
employee buyout effort to combine Eastern with Pan Am. They said
that Eastern and Pan Am routes would complement each other and that
joining the carriers would be a way to save both.
   Both have been beset by labor problems and have lost a total of
$2 billion in the 1980s.
   Besides the advertisement for pilots, Eastern took out full-page
ads in leading East Coast newspapers calling itself a fighting
underdog determined to come back.
   ``We're going to build a better Eastern for you,'' the ads
promise.
   In another strike-related development, Columbia College announced
that it was canceling a dinner to honor Eastern's embattled boss,
Frank Lorenzo. The New York City school said the ``emotional
climate'' of the labor dispute ``makes it impossible to guarantee an
atmosphere appropriate to such a celebratory event.''

   William F. Kerby, a former chairman of Dow
Jones &amp; Co. whose career in the newspaper business spanned nearly
half a century, died of cancer Sunday at his home here. He was 81.
   Kerby was a career newspaperman who held every major position on
the news staff of The Wall Street Journal prior to becoming an
executive officer at the Journal's publisher, Dow Jones &amp; Co.,
according to a statement from Dow Jones.
   ``Bill Kerby served Dow Jones with distinction for 47 years in
jobs ranging from reporter to chairman and chief executive,'' said
Warren H. Phillips, Dow Jones chairman, in the statement.
   Kerby joined the Journal's Washington D.C. staff in 1933. He was
managing editor and then executive editor from 1942 to 1951, helping
to develop the front-page news features and other innovations that
shaped the modern Wall Street Journal and its growth into a national
paper.
   Kerby was elected executive vice president of Dow Jones in 1961,
president in 1966, and chairman of the board in 1972. He retired in
1978 but continued to serve on the board of directors until Nov. 19,
1980.
   As president of Dow Jones and its chairman from 1966 to 1978, he
presided over the company's diversification into community
newspapers, overseas publishing, electronic information services and
other ventures.
   His wife, the former Frances Justina Douglass, died in 1986.
   Surviving are two daughters, Jean Frances Warner and Judith Ann
Beckmann, and six grandchildren.

   A woman once considered terminally ill by
doctors is cancer-free after receiving an experimental, four-organ
abdominal transplant, hospital officials say.
   Diana Hancock, 40, was admitted to Presbyterian-University
Hospital of Pittsburgh on Jan. 12 with an inoperable tumor on her
liver bile duct.
   The following day, surgeons replaced her liver, pancreas,
duodenum, and two sections of her small intestine. Her stomach was
removed but not replaced, requiring her to eat six small meals a day
spaced an hour or two apart.
   Ms. Hancock, a computer operator from Burlington, Wis., headed
home free of malignancy Saturday, hospital officials said. She is
among 11 once-terminal patients who are cancer-free after having
four of their abdominal organs replaced.
   Ms. Hancock said the transplant has given her ``a new lease on
life.''
   ``Now I have all the hope in the world,'' she said, adding that
she must return to Pittsburgh in two months for a check-up.
   The transplants, believed to be the first of their kind, have
been performed on 10 men and three women since June at
Presbyterian-University Hospital. Two patients died.

<TEXT>
   Relatives of victims of the bombing of Pan
Am Flight 103 said Sunday they are outraged by recent disclosures
about terrorism warnings made by federal officials before the
tragedy.
   ``It's absolutely ridiculous that they're three months too
late,'' said Jan Coyle of Wallingford, whose 20-year-old daughter,
Patricia, was among the 270 people who died in the Dec. 21 crash.
``To comprehend that this could have been avoided is unforgivable.''
   Coyle, clutching photographs of her daughter, a junior at Boston
College, was among about 100 people who attended a meeting of the
Victims of Flight 103 at the Marriott.
   The meeting was organized in the wake of disclosures that at
least six Federal Aviation Administration security bulletins issued
between Oct. 26 and Dec. 19 warned of the type of attack that
eventually caused Flight 103 to crash. The jet blew up over
Lockerbie, Scotland, and investigators have traced the bombing to
plastic explosives hidden inside a radio-cassette player.
   Many of the relatives wore white buttons emblazoned with blue
lettering saying ``Pan Am 103 _ The Truth Must be Known.'' Yet the
facts surrounding the bombing, which are slowly being released, have
provided little relief to those whose loved ones died on the plane.
   ``The more I hear, the less I want to hear,'' said Richard G.
Monetti of Cherry Hill, N.J., who wore a button bearing a picture of
his smiling son, Richard Monetti, a 20-year-old junior at Syracuse
University when he died.
   ``Frankly I had hoped the plane had a structural defect and fell
apart and my son died because it was an unfortunate accident. We'd
be devastated, but we'd pick up the pieces and we'd go on. The more
I hear the more it sounds like that if anything had gone right it
would have been avoided.''
   Many at the meeting questioned why some people avoided the
bombing by canceling their reservations. Marina DeLarracoechea, a
native of Bilbao, Spain, whose 39-year-old sister, Nieves, was a
stewardess aboard the flight, said there were 169 empty seats on the
plane and discount tickets for the flight had been sold.
   ``All the parties and all the people that are responsible for
this lack of action should be brought to justice because on all
their heads are the lives of 270 people,'' Ms. DeLarracoechea said.
   In recent weeks, relatives have urged the Senate Subcommitte on
Transportation to beef up security at airports, return property of
victims of Flight 103 and reveal the status of security before the
bombing.
   ``If we do not change this (terrorist) policy we will see these
terrorist acts over and over again because the terrorists will not
go away,'' said Paul Hudson of New York, whose 16-year-old daughter,
Melina, died in the crash.

<TEXT>
   A large tour operator closely linked with
crippled Eastern Airlines has been forced to file for bankruptcy
protection, and a travel industry executive said rumors of other
such failures abound.
   Tour operators are suffering as a result of fallout from the
Eastern crisis that also has hit some commuter airlines. Precision
Airlines of Manchester, N.H., one of the commuter carriers that
feeds into Eastern flights, recently suspended all operations and
furloughed 350 workers, citing a 70 percent drop in passenger
traffic.
   The Machinists union's strike against Miami-based Eastern,
supported by most of its pilots and flight attendants, is now in its
third week. Eastern filed for protection from creditors under
Chapter 11 of the federal bankruptcy law on March 9, and went
shopping Sunday for the new pilots it needs to survive the draining
strike.
   Last week Flyfaire Inc., one of the biggest U.S. tour operators
specializing in Caribbean vacation packages, sought protection under
Chapter 11 itself in a reflex action.
   ``Rumors have been flying'' of other tour operators also seeking
refuge in bankruptcy protection, said Sue Shapiro, president of the
Greater Independent Association of National Travel Agents in New
York. ``There's an obvious concern about anyone tied in with
Eastern.''
   Tour operators sell packages to travel agents. They function as
wholesalers between airlines and hotels on one side and travel
agents and consumers on the other.
   Flyfaire, based in Hawthorne, N.Y., used Eastern flights as the
basis for around 70 percent of its tour packages. The tour operator,
which says it is owed about $1.5 million by Eastern, was squeezed by
the airline's bankruptcy action.
   ``It became a nightmare,'' Flyfaire President Joseph Garzilli
said in a telephone interview, likening his company's plight to
being on an Eastern Airlines plane that crashed.
   Flyfaire's financial losses are compounded by the fact that it
cannot operate normally without Eastern flying a full schedule, he
said.
   The tour operator cut its staff from 230 to 50 after it filed for
bankruptcy in a New Jersey court, Garzilli said. The 16-year-old
company, with offices in New Jersey, Florida, Los Angeles,
Philadelphia, Pittsburgh, Detroit and other locations, had been
pulling in about $110 million a year in sales.
   Now, Garzilli's company must queue up with Eastern's other
unsecured creditors _ including banks, ticket holders, travel agents
and Eastern employees demanding paychecks _ whose financial exposure
is not backed by collateral. As the airline's bankruptcy proceedings
drag on, it could be weeks or months before they are paid.
   It was not immediately known how many other tour operators are
closely linked with Eastern the way Flyfaire is. Flyfaire's leading
competitor in Caribbean tours, Liberty Travel, mainly uses other
carriers.
   Ms. Shapiro said her group didn't know how many tied-in operators
could be affected by the Eastern bankruptcy. Spokesmen for the
United States Tour Operators Association and the American Society of
Travel Agents were unavailable for comment Sunday.

<HEAD>Prototype Of Unique Aircraft Successful In First Test Flight</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Two test pilots took a successful
15-minute test flight Sunday in a prototype of a revolutionary
aircraft designed to perform like both a helicopter and an airplane,
officials said.
   The V-22 Osprey, the world's first production tilt-rotor
aircraft, remained in helicopter mode throughout the flight,
according to officials of Bell Boeing of Fort Worth, a consortium of
two companies which built the craft.
   Bell Boeing officials described tests in aircraft mode as ``a
milestone soon to be accomplished.''
   The V-22 Osprey performed both a slow taxi liftoff and a vertical
takeoff during the landmark maneuvers and made conventional
``run-on'' landings, the officials said. Its top speed during the
tests was limited to 20 knots, less than 25 mph.
   The aircraft combines the operational capabilities of a
helicopter with those of a fixed-wind turboprop. With its engines
and prop-rotors vertical, the V-22 takes off, hovers and lands like
a helicopter.
   With its prop-rotors in forward position, the Osprey would become
a fast, fuel-efficient, high-altitude turboprop airplane capable of
reaching speeds of more than 345 mph.
   Boeing Helicopters President Don Chesnut said the Osprey gives
the U.S. military ``the ability to develop new missions and tactics
that cannot be accomplished by any existing helicopter or airplane.''
   Six flight-test prototypes are being built by Bell Helicopter
Textron Inc. in Fort Worth and Boeing Helicopters of Philadelphia, a
division of Boeing Co., under a $1.8 billion full-scale development
contract issued by the U.S. Naval Air Systems Command.
   The versatile Osprey is the first modern weapons system designed
from conception to meet requirements of all four U.S. armed
services, with deliveries expected to begin in 1992.

   A British weekly reported Sunday that the man who
made the bomb that blew up Pan Am Flight 103 and plotted the attack
is a Libyan known to international security officials as ``The
Professor'' because of his experience with explosives.
   The Sunday Express attributed its information to unidentified
detectives. It did not identify the suspect by name.
   The Express also said a Lebanese student, 21-year-old Khalid
Jaafar, of Dearborn, Mich., unwittingly carried the bomb onto the
flight in a radio-cassette player given to him as a gift, but it did
not say who gave it to him.
   Investigators have said the bomb that blew up Flight 103 over
Lockerbie, Scotland on Dec. 21, killing 270 people while flying from
London to New York, was hidden in a radio-cassette player.
   Earlier news reports in the United States and London have quoted
unidentified sources as saying Jaafar may have carried the bomb
aboard without knowing it when he boarded Flight 103 in Frankfurt,
West Germany. The FBI has questioned his father, Nazir, who has
denied those reports.
   The flight originated in Frankfurt, then changed planes in London
for the flight to New York.
   The Sunday Express said the ``Professor'' flew to Bonn, West
Germany from Greece on Dec. 13, eight days before the bombing.
   The report said the ``Professor'' trained as a member of an elite
squad in the Libyan army in the 1960s. Besides being an expert in
electronics and explosives, it said, he is a master forger and had
military training in Moscow that made him an expert in weaponry.
   It said the FBI has confirmed the man was being hunted in
connection with the bombing.
   In Washington, FBI spokesman Steve Gladis on Sunday declined to
comment specifically about the Express report but said of the Flight
103 bombing in general: ``The FBI is following this matter to
ascertain the facts. We're not commenting on it other than that.''
   The Sunday Express said the ``Professor'' trained recruits for
two years at the Syrian headquarters of a Libya-backed group headed
by Abu Nidal, who has been blamed for attacks on the Rome and Vienna
airports in 1985 and other terrorist incidents. The ``Professor''
also visited Ireland and had trained Irish Republican Army
guerrillas in Libya, it said.
   The report said the ``Professor'' arrived in West Germany using
the name Patel and met an Iranian diplomat who let him work from the
Iranian Embassy.
   It said he stayed in Germany until Jan. 6 ``at least.'' He was
seen three weeks ago driving a car with German license plates in
Lisbon, Portugal, the report said, and then he disappeared.

   More than 40 angry friends and
relatives of a slain 13-year-old girl stood Sunday outside the house
where her body was found and taunted the family who lives there with
chants of ``devils.''
   The furious throng, which included the father, an aunt and an
uncle of the slain girl, Kelly Tinyes, shouted that the Golub family
would ``rot in hell.'' The verbal assault lasted about two hours.
   The Golubs had returned to the house at 6:30 p.m. Saturday for
the first time since the girl's death, when authorities ordered them
to vacate the house because it was the scene of a crime.
   Kelly's body was found March 4 in the basement of the Golub home
in Valley Stream on Long Island. She was seen entering the house a
day earlier.
   Nassau County Police Lt. Bill Krausch said police were ready to
make an arrest in the case, but that they deferred to the county
prosecutor, who wanted first to present evidence to the grand jury
on Wednesday.
   Krausch would not identify who was the target of the arrest.
However, police have said that the only suspects in the case were
two Golub brothers, Robert, 21, and John, 14.
   At about noon Sunday, when Robert left the house on foot, he was
followed by Kelly's father, Richard Tinyes, and the angry crowd.
   According to Nassau County police spokesman Officer Charles
Koller, a patroling police officer saw Golub being followed and
called for assistance.
   When Golub reached a grocery store, about six blocks from his
house, some of the mob repeatedly accused him of being a ``devil.''
   Eight police cars arrived, and officers protected Golub as he
left the store with his older sister, Adele, who had come to pick
him up in a car.
   The verbal lynching continued, with one member of the crowd
shouting at the sister, ``You are a devil for being with him.''
   Ms. Golub yelled, ``My brothers were innocent,'' before breaking
down into sobs and driving away in the car.
   At 12:20 p.m., as neighbors shouted that the house was filled
with devils, several family members _ Robert, Adele, John and their
mother, Elizabeth, left the house and drove away in one car.
   About 10 minutes later, their father, John Sr., left in a
separate car as somebody shouted, ``You're raising devils in the
house.''
   As he drove away, the neighbors applauded. The Golubs departed
``for parts unknown,'' said Koller.

   ``The Last Emperor,'' which swept last year's
Academy Awards, won this year's top British film award Sunday night,
while two stars from ``A Fish Called Wanda,'' won top acting awards.
   The Danish movie ``Babette's Feast'' won as best foreign language
film and Louis Malle took top directing honors for ``Au Revoir Les
Enfants.'' Both movies had also been nominated for best film of 1988.
   Sir Alec Guinness, the 74-year-old veteran actor, received the
British Academy of Film and Television Arts' most prestigious award,
becoming a fellow of the academy. It was presented by Oscar-winning
director Sir David Lean instead of fellow director Sir Richard
Attenborough, who was hospitalized Sunday morning for suspected
kidney stones.
   Guinness, who won an Oscar for ``The Bridge on the River Kwai''
in 1957, has been nominated for another Oscar this year for his
supporting role in ``Little Dorrit.'' The Academy Awards will be
presented in Hollywood on March 29.
   Comedian John Cleese was chosen best actor as the reserved
English lawyer who lost his inhibitions to an American woman thief,
played by Jamie Lee Curtis, in ``A Fish Called Wanda.''
   Cleese, accepting the award from actor Dudley Moore in Los
Angeles, said in a closed-circuit TV relay he thought it should have
gone to co-star Kevin Kline, who was also nominated for his role as
a manic jewel thief. Kline is nominated for an Oscar but Cleese is
not.
   Michael Palin, the movie's stuttering animal lover who was forced
to watch his goldfish swallowed and to accidentally cause the deaths
of several dogs, got the best supporting actor award.
   ``It was a marvelous film to work on _ except if you're a fish or
a dog,'' he joked in accepting the award. ``I want to thank John
Cleese who upgraded me from a pet salesman to a pet murderer and all
the doggies who gave their lives.''
   The Michael Balcon award for outstanding British contribution to
cinema went to Charles Crichton, director of ``A Fish Called Wanda''
and more than a score of other films.
   Two of Britain's leading ladies walked off with the best actress
awards, Maggie Smith for her starring role as a spinster piano
teacher in Dublin in ``The Lonely Passion of Judith Hearne'' and
Dame Judi Dench for her supporting role as the pushy mother in ``A
Handful of Dust.'' Both are previous British award winners.
   Ms. Smith skipped the ceremony because of a broken shoulder.
   Bernardo Bertolucci, accepting the best picture award for his
epic film ``The Last Emperor'' about Chinese Emperor Pu Yi, praised
the important British contribution to the movie's technical and
acting success, including actor Peter O'Toole, who lost out in the
best supporting actor competition.
   ``A World Apart'' won for best original screenplay, ``The
Unbearable Lightness of Being'' for best adapted screenplay,
``Empire of the Sun'' for best score, and ``Defense Counsel Sedov,''
a Soviet movie about the righting of injustice, as best short film.
   The main Oscar nominees _ ``Rain Man,'' ``Dangerous Liaisons,''
``Mississippi Burning,'' ``The Accidental Tourist'' and ``Working
Girl'' _ were ineligible for the British awards because they were
not released in Britain during 1988.
   More than 2,300 people packed the grand ballroom at the Grosvenor
House Hotel for the ceremony. Actors Ben Kingsley and Edward Fox and
actresses Shirley Maclaine and Hayley Mills were among the
celebrities who presented awards.

   An armed man killed his girlfriend and
himself Sunday after an almost two-day siege in which he held the
woman and her daughter and sister hostage, authorities said.
   The sister was shot in the head and was in critical condition
after surgery, officials said.
   Douglas ``Dougie'' Thomas, 20, had holed up with his hostages in
their one-story home Friday night. The incident ended 42 hours
later, at 5:40 p.m. Sunday, when police fired tear gas into the home
and entered it.
   Thomas and Karen Lambert, both 20, were dead of gunshot wounds
when they arrived at St. John's Hospital after the siege, said
Sangamon County Coroner Norman Richter and hospital spokeswoman
Aggie Hayner.
   Richter said Thomas suffered a gunshot wound to the abdomen. His
girlfriend was shot in the chest.
   Ms. Lambert's 14-year-old sister, Nicole Lambert, was in surgery
for her head wound, the coroner said.
   Earlier Sunday, Thomas released Katrina Lambert, the 4-year-old
daughter of his girlfriend, after police cut off electricity and gas
to the house, according to police Cmdr. Dave Searcy.
   ``At about 6:15 a.m. the door opened and the little girl walked
out,'' Searcy said. He said she ``was very tired and very hungry,''
but otherwise unharmed.
   Thomas, reportedly armed with a handgun, had threatened to kill
himself and the hostages throughout the confrontation.
   Neighbors screamed and ran from the site after police fired tear
gas at the house, and television station WICS in Springfield
reported a fight broke out after bystanders learned of the deaths.
   One man at the scene, James Kerr, 47, was taken to St. John's
with chest pains and was reported in fair condition.
   Another hostage, the 2{-month-old daughter of Thomas and his
girlfriend, was released at 8:30 a.m. Saturday.
   Heavily armed police had surrounded the house, which Searcy said
is the home of the Lambert sisters and their mother. About 32
families were evacuated Saturday from neighboring houses, and were
staying with relatives or being housed at Salvation Army facilities
Sunday.
   ``The neighborhood is shut down,'' Searcy said.
   Authorities periodically shouted through a bullhorn to keep
Thomas awake. ``We don't want him resting or sleeping. We want him
worn out just as we are _ so darn worn out and tired that he'll give
up,'' Searcy said.
   Thomas made ``no demands whatsoever,'' Searcy said. He said he
thought Thomas went to the home because of a dispute with the
girlfriend and refused to come out because ``he knows he's probably
going to go to jail and he doesn't want to go.''
   James Kerr, a friend who talked to Thomas by telephone Saturday
afternoon, described him as ``paranoid and insecure.''
   ``He seems like he's almost hallucinating,'' said police
spokesman Neil Williamson.
   Williamson said Thomas was hospitalized recently for depression,
and police believe he had been taking medication that might affect
his moods.
   Thomas spent a year in prison for shooting two men at a dance in
1985. A judge reduced charges of attempted murder to two counts of
aggravated battery, because a question existed about whether Thomas
intended to kill the men.
   Katrina's father, Ronald Brown, 22, said the little girl's
birthday was Friday.

   A U.S. Marine helicopter carrying 37
Marines on maneuvers crashed in an isolated mountain region on South
Korea's southeast coast early Monday and 22 were killed, U.S.
authorities said.
   Fifteen Marines were injured, some critically, when the Sikorsky
Sea Stallion crashed shortly before 7 a.m. (5 p.m. EST Sunday) in a
rugged mountainous area south of the industrial port city of Pohang,
250 miles southeast of Seoul, a Marine Corps spokesman said.
   The most seriously injured were evacuated to an amphibious
assault ship off the Korean coast, the USS Belleau Wood, and the
rest were flown to Seoul, the spokesman said. Officials said earlier
that 34 people were aboard.
   No one on the ground was hurt, he said.
   Yonhap, the South Korean news agency, said in a report citing
South Korean military officials that the helicopter exploded and
burst into flames before slamming into the ground. The report said
the explosion appeared to have been caused by an engine defect.
   It was the second fatal crash involving a Marine helicopter in
Korea in four days. All four Marines were killed Friday when their
CH-46 helicopter crashed in a rice paddy on the east coast.
   Marine officials said there was no explanation for either crash.
   Both helicopters were participating in the annual joint
U.S.-South Korea military ``Team Spirit'' maneuvers which includes
60,000 U.S. troops.
   A U.S. military statement said the Sea Stallion, a CH-53D troop
transporter, was assigned to the 1st Marine Air Wing, Futenma Marine
Corps Air Station, in Okinawa, Japan. It carried a crew of four and
33 military passengers.
   Marine officials said they did not know if the Marine unit aboard
the helicopter was based in Japan or the United States.
   Names of the injured and dead were withheld pending notification
of next of kin.
   The cause of Monday's crash was not immediately known and
authorities were still trying to determine if the helicopter crashed
into a hillside or went down in midair, U.S. military officials said.
   Investigators had been sent to the area to try and determine what
happened, but no quick results were expected, they said.
   The United States has some 43,000 troops based in South Korea
under a mutual defense treaty. About 30,000 U.S. troops from the
United States and other parts of Asia are in South Korea to take
part in Team Spirit along with 30,000 of those based in South Korea.

   Desmond Tutu, the Anglican archbishop
of South Africa, said Sunday his country's racial policies would
change immediately if the United States and other Western nations
demanded it.
   Tutu, who won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1984 for his active
opposition to South Africa's segregation policies known as
apartheid, said his nation's racial policies are maintained because
of ``immense economic interests'' by Western governments.
   ``If the United States and the Western countries wanted,
apartheid would end tomorrow,'' Tutu said at a news conference.
   ``Some actions taken by the Western government have a background
of racism,'' Tutu told reporters. ``They say that dollars are more
important than people, especially when those people are black.''
   Tutu and six other Anglican officials arrived in Panama Saturday
from Nicaragua, where they toured the country for five days. They
leave Panama on Tuesday.
   In Managua Saturday, the clerics issued a statement backing the
leftist Sandinista government's recent reforms and called on the
U.S. government to help resettle the 11,000 Nicaraguan rebels in
Honduras.
   An agreement signed Feb. 14 by five Central American presidents
sought to disband the Nicaraguan rebels, known as Contras. The
Contras have been supported by the U.S. government since 1981.
   The Anglican officials are visiting at the invitation of the Rev.
Sturdie Downs, bishop of Nicaragua's Episcopal Church.
   Edmond Browning, Anglican primate in the United States, said he
accepted the invitation after hearing about ``the horrible pain and
suffering of the people in these countries.''
   The religious leaders were scheduled to meet Monday with Gen.
Manuel Antonio Noriega, head of the nation's security forces.
   The U.S. government imposed sanctions against Panama in April
1988 to force the fall of Noriega, the country's de facto ruler. A
court in Florida has indicted Noriega on charges of drug trafficking.
   The U.S. sanctions have seriously damaged Panama's economy.

   A sharp earthquake shook a large area of
Alaska on Sunday, but no injuries or damage were reported.
   The tremor, which occurred at 4:07 p.m., was centered in southern
Alaska just west of Cook Inlet about 170 miles southwest of
Anchorage, said U.S. Geological Survey spokesman Don Finley in
Washington.
   ``The quake was felt widely, all the way to Kodiak and to Palmer,
including Anchorage and Eagle River,'' said Alec Medberry of the
Tsunami Center here.
   Geological Survey earthquake monitors in Golden, Colo., recorded
the quake at a preliminary magnitude of 5.3 on the Richter scale.
The Tsunami Center measured it at 5.6.
   An earthquake of 5 on the Richter scale can cause considerable
damage, while a 6 reading can cause severe damage. A 7 is a
``major'' earthquake, capable of widespread heavy damage.
   Authorities said there were no reports of injuries or damage in
the sparsely populated area.

<HEAD>Four Atlanta, Soviet TV Journalists To Swap Jobs</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A reporter and camera operator from an Atlanta
television station leave this week for six weeks in the Soviet
Union. Nothing unusual about that _ except that they'll be reporting
for Soviet television.
   The trip is part of a unusual job-swapping deal in which a Soviet
reporter will later spend six weeks at Atlanta station WXIA-TV.
   WXIA Reporter Simeon Smith, who is fluent in Russian, and
cameraman Richard Crabbe leave Tuesday for Tbilisi, Atlanta's sister
city in the Soviet Republic of Georgia.
   There they will work for Gostelradio, the government organization
that runs Soviet television.
   ``A lot of what we will be doing is comparative stuff between
life in Atlanta and life in Tbilisi,'' Smith said.
   When they return, they'll be accompanied by Nugzar Ruhadze, an
English-speaking Soviet reporter who will work at WXIA for six
weeks, reporting to Atlanta viewers.
   Ellen Mickiewicz, an Emory University professor and one of the
country's leading experts on Soviet television, said she believes
it's the first such exchange of reporters.
   Smith said he has been stockpiling features on life in Atlanta,
with stories ranging from Stone Mountain's new Megastore to AIDS
victims, the Atlanta Hawks pro basketball team, the homeless and an
affluent teen-age girl ``who has a closet that's as big as most
Russian apartments.''
   He said most of his work in Tbilisi will be relatively
apolitical, ``but if they have a hot story, like an earthquake, I'm
part of the team.''
   ``We told them, `If you want to censor Simeon, go for it,''' said
WXIA General Manager Harvey Mars, who made two trips to the Soviet
Union to set up the exchange. ``But just remember, when he comes
back, he tells all.''
   In the Soviet Union, each of the 15 republics has its own
newscast, which usually is broadcast twice, once in Russian and once
in the language of the Republic, which in the case of Tbilisi in the
Republic of Georgia is Georgian. There also is a national newscast.
   Most of Smith's work will be for the Georgia newscast, but some
may be used nationally. He will report in Russian, which will be
translated into Georgian.

<TEXT>
   A union umbrella group on Monday called
for tougher safety standards for nuclear power plants worldwide and
the creation of an ``independent'' international nuclear regulatory
agency.
   The Brussels-based International Confederation of Free Trade
Unions said the Vienna-based International Atomic Energy Agency was
``unsuited'' for regulatory activities. In a 40-page report, the
Confederation said the agency was ``compromised by its role in
promoting nuclear energy.''
   The report released Monday called for creation of a watchdog
group with powers to enforce binding safety standards and visit
nuclear plants unannounced. It also called for unions to participate
in setting and enforcing plant safety rules.
   The confederation is the non-communist world's largest union
umbrella group and claims to represent 87 million workers from 141
unions in 97 countries.
   The organization said the report reflected a desire for greater
openness in the nuclear power industry and called for regular
statements on all nuclear incidents.
   ``This report is neither pro-nuclear nor anti-nuclear. It's
pro-safety,'' Confederation Secretary General John Vanderveken said
in a statement released Monday.
   The report, released simultaneously in Brussels, London, Vienna
and New Delhi, will serve as a basis for talks on April 6 and 7
between the Confederation and the Atomic Energy Agency in Vienna.

<TEXT>
   Noboru Gotoh, former president of the Japan Chamber
of Commerce and Industry and a leader in one of Japan's largest
business conglomerates, died of respiratory failure early Monday. He
was 72.
   Gotoh, a 1940 graduate of the Economics Department at Tokyo
University, in 1959 became president of the Tokyu Corp., a railway
that was the core of the Tokyu business group his father founded.
   Gotoh joined Tokyu Corp. in October 1945 after serving in the
Japanese army.
   Under Gotoh's guidance, the Tokyu business group expanded to 334
firms, including railways, real estate and construction firms,
department stores and hotels.
   Gotoh, who sustained an interest in pan-Pacific economic
cooperation, served since 1978 as chairman of the Japan Committee of
the Pacific Basin Economic Committee (PBEC), a forum of 850 company
representatives from 16 countries and areas, including the United
States, Australia, New Zealand, South Korea, Taiwan and Japan.
   In 1984, he was elected head of the Japan Chamber of Commerce and
Industry. He retired from the post in December 1987 for health
reasons and became an honorary president.
   Gotoh had been in and out of hospitals since he underwent surgery
for a stomach ulcer in May 1987.
   Gotoh is survived by his wife, Yoko, three sons and two daughters.

<TEXT>
   It would be hard to tell from the amount of media
coverage that the vehicle under government investigation for
rollovers is the Ford Bronco II and not the Suzuki Samurai.
   It would also be hard to tell from the sales totals. Although the
government has never had a harsh word about the Samurai, its sales
are a tenth what they were before Consumer Reports magazine charged
last year that the boxy little four-wheel-drive vehicle tips over
too easily.
   The fate of the Samurai illustrates the power of the news media
to influence car-buying decisions, particularly the power of the
repeatedly televised videotapes showing the Samurai going up on two
wheels in high-speed maneuvers.
   Now Ford Motor Co. is waiting to see what will happen to sales of
its Bronco II following the announcement last week that it will be
investigated for rollovers by the National Highway Traffic Safety
Administration.
   Most auto analysts predict the government's probe _ strictly
speaking, an engineering analysis _ will have little effect on
Bronco II sales, for two reasons:
   _Engineering analyses are routine. Fifty-five were under way as
of the end of February, the agency says. Of those, only some go on
to the next stage, the ``case level.'' And only some of those result
in determinations of safety defects.
   _The Bronco II has not received as much negative publicity as the
Samurai got, partly because the government did not release any
gripping videotapes of the Bronco II going up on two wheels.
   ``The power of the press really hit home in the Samurai
controversy. So far the Bronco is pretty far from that type of
situation,'' said Scott Merlis, an auto analyst at Morgan Stanley &amp;
Co.
   The Jeep-like Samurai was rolling along at sales of about 6,000 a
month when Consumer Reports magazine called a news conference on
June 2 to say it was giving the vehicle a not-acceptable rating. It
said the Japanese-built Samurai ``literally trips over its own
feet'' because of a narrow tread width, short wheelbase, light
weight and high center of gravity.
   Sales plunged to 2,199 in June. Suzuki responded with dealer
incentives that resulted in sharp price cuts, and sales rebounded to
6,327 in July and a record 12,208 in August.
   The automaker appeared to have come back from the brink. It got a
boost on Sept. 1 when the National Highway Traffic Safety
Administration denied a recall petition by the Center for Auto
Safety, a Washington-based consumer group.
   The respite was short-lived, though, as sales plummeted to 560 in
September, 787 in October and 483 in November. They jumped to 2,483
in December before retreating to 263 in January and 472 in February.
   Sales of the bigger, heavier and more expensive Bronco II run
about 9,000 to 11,000 a month.
   Officials of Brea, Calif.-based American Suzuki say Samurai sales
have been hampered by several unrelated factors, including the
difficulties of introducing three other Suzuki models in the past
several months: the Sidekick, the Swift GTi and the Swift GLX.
   But they admit that last summer's publicity hurt. Sales of all
four Suzuki vehicles combined totaled less than 3,000 last month.
   ``We have seen a longer-term impact on the sales than we would
have hoped. I'm not sure there is one reporter who can write a story
about Suzuki without mentioning this issue,'' said Lynne M. Doll, a
spokeswoman with the company's public relations agency, Rogers &amp;
Associates.
   The government safety board said it chose to investigate the
Bronco II because statistics unearthed last year showed it had a far
higher rate of fatal rollovers than the Samurai.
   Clarence Ditlow, head of the Center for Auto Safety, said he
thinks the government missed some fatal rollovers involving the
Samurai while slightly overstating the Bronco II's. He says the
vehicles are equally bad. ``They both deserve to be investigated,''
he said in an interview last week.
   In fact, the government probe may not make much difference.
Unless the agency discovers serious rollover problems with the
Bronco II, its sales are likely to remain healthy. For the Samurai,
meanwhile, the damage is already done.

<HEAD>Brokerage Chief Urges New Twist for IRAs</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CHET CURRIER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A top Wall Street executive has begun a campaign
for a measure he says would stimulate savings without aggravating
the government's budget problems.
   William Schreyer, the chairman of Merrill Lynch &amp; Co., contends
that his idea would ``put some renewed sex appeal'' into individual
retirement accounts.
   At the same time, he says, it would help to pay in advance for
the future costs of health care and the well-being of the rapidly
growing numbers of older Americans.
   Schreyer's idea, put forward in speeches he has been giving this
month, is not to restore the tax breaks for IRA contributions that
were curtailed by the Tax Reform Act of 1986 _ not right away, at
least.
   Rather, he is proposing that IRA savers be given the right to
withdraw money from their accounts in the future for certain
purposes _ medical, educational and home ownership _ without having
to pay tax on the proceeds.
   Schreyer's argument starts from the premise that the nation needs
to increase its chronically low savings rate if it is going to be
able to bear the costs of supporting an aging population in the
decades ahead.
   But he also acknowledges a more immediate need to settle current
accounts that are out of whack.
   ``The deficit crisis is real,'' he says. ``We've got to find ways
to encourage increased savings that take little or nothing out of
the Treasury's hide now.''
   Of course, Schreyer is hardly a disinterested party in the debate
over tax policy. When IRAs were opened up to all working Americans
in 1982, they became lucrative products for firms like Merrill Lynch.
   In 1987, when deductions for contributions ended for married
couples making $50,000 or more a year, and individuals with incomes
of $35,000 and up, the flow of money into these accounts slowed
significantly.
   But does his idea have merit? At first glance, at least, it looks
like a tax break that would benefit upper-income people the most.
Hence, it wouldn't seem to have much chance of attracting support in
Congress.
   However, supporters of the idea point out, the situation isn't
quite that simple. All IRA withdrawals, except for the amount of
non-deductible contributions made by the well-to-do, are now subject
to tax.
   So under Schreyer's proposal, all American workers would have a
greater incentive to put as much money as possible in IRAs. The
interest, dividends and capital gains that now build up tax-free
inside IRAs would remain tax-free when they were taken out.
   What's more, the accounts could be used to plan not just for
retirement, but for other goals Schreyer describes as socially
desirable, including education, and to help shoulder the burden of
the mounting cost of health care.
   But the idea raises several tough questions. First of all, what
would it mean for future government budgets?
   If taxpayers were able to build up large new amounts of money
that the government could lay no claim to, might tax rates on other
income have to be raised, and new types of taxes be created?
   Furthermore, would IRA contributors totally buy the idea that
their money could actually never be taxed?
   Recent tax changes have tainted principles that once were thought
to be sacrosanct: For example, ``no taxes on taxes.'' Well, state
sales taxes no longer are deductible and the deduction for state
income taxes barely survived the last debate about changing the
rules.
   Schreyer's case is that the nation should be thinking long-term
in handling its finances. As legions of financial advisers have
pointed out in recent years, that is hard to do in a climate where
the tax rules are subject to frequent and seemingly limitless change.

<HEAD>Whittle Begins Research to Build Case for TV News Show for Schools</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SKIP WOLLENBERG</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Students at two California high schools, Gahr and
nearby Cerritos, took a current events quiz last week, and the
results could help decide whether commercial television gets a place
in the classroom.
   The quizzes were part of a research effort designed to see if a
daily TV news show that includes paid advertising is helping
students learn.
   The nearly 2,000 students at Gahr High School in Cerritos,
Calif., have been able to watch the news show called Channel One for
the past two weeks on 91 new television sets given to the school and
installed in every classroom.
   The youngsters at Cerritos High School, whose enrollment numbers
and characteristics resemble those of its suburban Los Angeles
neighbor, haven't had a chance to see the news show but agreed to
take the quiz anyway.
   Whittle Communications LP, the Knoxville, Tenn.-based media
concern that developed Channel One, plans to tally the results from
these schools along with those from tests at the five other schools
in the Channel One project and their sister schools and see if the
show is helping educate students.
   Backers of the program are betting that the research will show a
significant difference in the results from the schools that have
been exposed to the show and those that have not.
   That could be a critical element in Whittle's efforts to persuade
other schools to sign up for the Channel One project. Whittle hopes
to expand the service to as many as 8,000 schools nationwide in the
fall of 1990.
   ``We expect to see real differences, and if we do it will be a
real plus for the program,'' Whittle chairman Christopher Whittle
said Friday in a telelphone interview.
   The main obstacle to the project appears to be the intense
opposition from children's advocates and some education groups who
say companies should not be allowed to pitch their products to an
essentially captive audience in school.
   Groups such as the National Association of Secondary School
Principals and the National Parent-Teacher Association have opposed
it.
   Peggy Charren, head of Action for Children's Television, a
Massachusetts-based children's advocacy group, said she thinks the
Channel One test has been orchestrated to gloss over the bad
precedent she says is being set of allowing commercials in
classrooms.
   ``The problem is we are selling children to advertisers ... They
think they are going to get enough kids buying enough products to
make the investment worthwhile,'' Mrs. Charren said.
   The test of Channel One began March 6 at Gahr and five others
schools _ Mumford High School in Detroit, Withrow High School in
Cincinnati, Eisenhower Middle School in Kansas City, Kan., Billerica
Memorial High School near Boston and Central High School in
Knoxville.
   Each school was given about $50,000 in televisions, video
recorders and a satellite dish to recieve a daily 12-minute news
show with up to two minutes of paid ads. The sponsors include Levi's
jeans, Snickers candy bars and Clearasil acne cream.
   In return, the schools are asked to play the show once each
school day.
   The test is to include five weeks of programs over a seven-week
period. Channel One has just begun a two-week hiatus for spring
break during which the producers hope to fine-tune the program.
   A typical news show relates the day's top stories and contains
features on subjects like the environment and the lifetsyles of
Soviet teen-agers.
   Last week, Channel One also carried a live 15-minute special
without commercials on the launch of the space shuttle Discovery.
   To test if the show is effective, Whittle plans to give quizzes
at all six schools and their sister schools in each district for
comparison.
   Students at Gahr and Cerritos got 29 multiple choice questions,
most of which came from information in the past week's shows.
   Whittle said his company is also conducting two other types of
studies to measure the effectiveness of the project.
   He said one involves group interviews with teachers or students
from the schools. The other involves telephone interviews with
students who have gotten their parent's permission to talk about the
commercials on the program.
   Whittle said the comparative quiz results, the group discussions
and the telephone polling will all figure in whether his company
invests more than $100 million in hardware alone that he said will
be required to go national.
   ``Five weeks isn't a very long time, but we ought to be able to
show some movement,'' he said.

<TEXT>
   What started as a European Economic Community ban
on U.S. beef with growth-enhancing hormones is turning into an
international scrap over the market for untreated meat.
   Twenty-eight countries have agreed to EEC requirements for
certifying that beef sent to the 12-nation trading group is
hormone-free, said Jacques Vonthron, the EEC's agricultural attache
in Washington. The largest exporters include Argentina, Australia,
Brazil and New Zealand.
   Which of those beef-producing countries will fill the $100
million U.S. share of the European market has yet to be determined.
Retailers are now completing sales of their last U.S. shipments
since the hormone-treated beef ban started, Vonthron said.
   Texas beef producers, who raise approximately one-fifth of U.S.
beef cattle, are concerned about whom European retailers might turn
to while American suppliers are out of the market, said John Vlcek,
spokesman for the Texas Department of Agriculture.
   The Texans might be willing to accept the European standards to
preserve their share of exports to the EEC, Vlcek said. Some Texas
beef industry officials have already explored the idea.
   In addition, news about the U.S.-EEC dispute has incited a small
but growing demand for hormone-free beef by health-conscious
Americans, cattle producers and consumer groups said.
   At issue is the January ban by the EEC on U.S. beef treated with
three natural and two artificial growth hormones. The time-released,
muscle-building substances are injected via pellet under the ear
skin of a young cow or steer.
   Europeans contend that the hormones are a health hazard for
humans. The United States says the health issue is a pretext for a
trade barrier.
   European cattle herds are too large for demand, according to Jon
Brandt, co-director of the Food and Agriculture Policy Research
Institute at the University of Missouri. U.S. suppliers have a
similar problem. Americans are eating 23 percent less beef today
than in 1976, he said.
   Concern over the purity of food and environment ``is a growing
trend around the world in developed countries,'' said C. Ford Runge,
who was special assistant to the U.S. ambassador at the Geneva
meeting of the General Agreement of Tariffs and Trade, which
unsuccessfully sought to thwart the beef ban.
   Health and environmental concerns can be legitimate reasons to
request trade restrictions, Runge said. But these fears also allow
``protectionists to hide.''
   The EEC has vowed to bar U.S. beef products for human consumption
and the United States is retaliating with 100 percent tariffs on
$100 million in European foods, ranging from canned tomatoes to
instant coffee.
   Both sides agreed in February to establish a task force to study
the issue.
   ``You've got a lobby in Germany that's very concerned'' about
hormones accumulating in the beef organs imported from the United
States, said Runge. ``The European community has created a market
niche that a number of (exporters) are trying to fill.''
   One peculiarity of European beef imported from the United States
is that 75 percent consists of organ meat _ livers, kidneys, tongues
and tripe used in everything from pate to steak and kidney pies.
   EEC beef imports amount to only about 2 percent of U.S.
production, according to Alisa Harrison of the National Cattlemen's
Association in Washington.
   Brandt pointed out that this 2 percent accounts for much of the
organ meat produced in the United States, and cattlemen don't want
to change production methods for the several pounds of organ meat
derived from each animal.
   ``We don't feel it's right for a foreign government to dictate to
the United States how we should produce our cattle,'' Ms. Harrison
said, noting that the U.S. Department of Agriculture accepts hormone
conditioning.
   The EEC is asking for certification of hormone-free beef which
would boost the production cost of U.S. meat and make it less
competitive, she said.
   ``The reason why we're so adament about opposing the the EEC is
because they haven't been able to produce the scientific evidence to
support their (hormone) ban,'' she said.
   The beef-hormone commotion also has piqued the curiosity of
American consumers.
   ``People are worrying about food additives and it is growing
daily,'' said Mel Coleman, marketing director of Coleman Natural
Beef in Denver, Colorado, which slaughters 20,000 cattle a year
after certifying them additive-free.
   It is one of about six hormone-free beef producers that supply
1,200 U.S. supermarkets catering to health-conscious buyers, said
Dan Howell, director of the Americans for Safe Food Project, a
consumer advocacy group.
   Beef free of both hormones and antibiotics, both used to enhance
growth, sells for about 25 percent more than other U.S. beef,
industry experts said.
   Howell said a 1988 study by the Food Marketing Institute, an
independent, Washington-based trade association of 17,500 retail
food stores, showed 61 percent of shoppers considered hormone and
antibiotics in meat and poultry to be a serious health concern.

<HEAD>Futures Leaders Return Home With Congressional Warning</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID DISHNEAU</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Leaders of the futures industry returned home from
their annual convention in Florida with sunburns and a stinging
admonition from some concerned congressmen to clean up their
business.
   About two dozen federal lawmakers spoke during last week's
four-day meeting of the Futures Industry Association, and their
message to the approximately 1,000 brokers and exchange officials
was clear: Put your house in order because Congress is coming
through.
   ``It is incumbent upon you to open your eyes to wrongdoing where
it exists and be assertive and effective in rooting it out, even at
the expense of making some internal fundamental changes; to try to
do it yourself rather than waiting for someone else to do it to
you,'' said Rep. Dan Glickman, D-Kan., during a panel discussion on
Saturday.
   The futures industry is due for an official review as part of the
congressional process for reauthorizing the Commodity Futures
Trading Commission, the federal agency that regulates futures
trading. The CFTC's current 3-year authorization expires on Sept. 30.
   The recent disclosure of a sweeping Justice Department
investigation of suspected trading fraud at Chicago's two
world-leading futures exchanges has heightened public interest in
the industry and brought demands for intense scrutiny and reform of
these once-obscure markets.
   ``Out there in the country, our constituents don't know a lot
about futures trading; none of them have ever heard of the CFTC. It
is important as we look at this industry that they know the
importance of it,'' said Rep. Robin Tallon, D-S.C., who sits on a
House agriculture subcommittee that is conducting one of several
congressional reviews of the industry.
   A future is a binding contract to buy or sell a bundle of
commodities or financial instruments at a specified price at a
future date.
   Agricultural commodity futures have been traded at the Chicago
Board of Trade, the world's largest futures exchange, for more than
140 years. But most of the action now is in financial futures, which
were invented in the 1970s and are heavily used by institutional
investors around the world to reduce their risks in the
international stock, bond and currency markets.
   The Justice Department's probe of suspected cheating by traders
at the Chicago Board of Trade and the Chicago Mercantile Exchange
has yielded no charges since it was revealed on Jan. 19.
   Nevertheless, some key lawmakers who attended last week's
industry meeting in Boca Raton, Fla., indicated support for:
   _Beefing up CFTC's trade-surveillance and rule-enforcement
operations.
   _Tightening up record-keeping by futures exchanges and brokerage
firms.
   _Cracking down on certain trading practices that some believe
provide opportunities to cheat.
   If the futures industry cannot satisfactorily police itself,
several lawmakers implied, it will lose its cherished freedom to set
and enforce most of its own rules.
   ``Our committee is not going to resolve in favor of
self-regulation unless there is a perception that it seems to be
working universally,'' said Sen. Richard Lugar of Indiana, the
ranking Republican member of the Senate Agriculture Committee, which
also oversees futures regulation.
   Over and over during the Florida meeting, exchange officials
vowed to improve their auditing of trades and to root out and punish
wrongdoers.
   ``Certainly we can do better than we have done,'' Leo Melamed,
chairman of the Chicago Merc's executive committee, told Lugar on
Saturday. ``I give you the entire promise of my whole being that we
will respond in every possible way that we can to your message.''
   Rep. David Nagle, D-Iowa, suggested that futures leaders view the
various investigations of their industry as an ``opportunity to
recapture the one commodity you can never afford to lose: the
universal recognition of the integrity of your markets.''

<HEAD>Study: Boston Tenants Paying Highest Percentage of Income on Rent</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: SUBS 8th graf, `The study...,' with 3 grafs to UPDATE with other
available cities (</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>

   Boston-area tenants pay a bigger chunk of their
income in rent than tenants in any other major city in the country,
while Houston residents pay the smallest, a new study says.
   A California research firm, Sound Advice, calculated that
Boston's median rent is $586 a month. That is about the same as San
Francisco, but the study found median incomes were lower in Boston,
so that while San Franciscans pay 19.5 percent of their income on
rent, Bostonians pay 21.3 percent.
   Renters in New York pay a median of $444 per month. Though the
rent is lower than San Francisco's, it amounts to about the same
percentage of income as renters in San Francisco pay, again because
New York incomes are lower, the study found.
   The figures are lower than actual market-rate rents because they
include subsidized apartments. Excluding subsidized apartments, the
Boston Redevelopment Authority figures the average rent in Boston
last year was $800 a month.
   Houston was ranked as the most economical of the 25 cities
surveyed in terms of percentage of income, with a monthly rent of
$346 _ about 13 percent of the median household income. It was
followed by Cincinnati, where the median rent is $322, or 13.5
percent of household income.
   Next to Boston, the least economical city was Los Angeles, where
median rents were $521, or 20.7 percent of income.
   The average of all 25 cities was $425 _ 18.5 percent of monthly
income.
   Median rents for other cities, along with the percentage that it
comprised of median income, included Cleveland, $380 and 13.8
percent; Chicago, $441 and 15.1 percent; Seattle, $419 and 15.3
percent; and Washington, $601 and 18.3 percent.
   The study touched a nerve in Boston, where rents have increased
64 percent since 1982. That includes a 6.1 percent rise last year
that was the biggest of any major metropolitan area except
Washington, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.
   Rents are skyrocketing in a city that already has one of the
highest median house prices in the nation, estimated as high as
$195,000.
   ``The simple fact is that people can't afford to buy homes,''
said Lewis Finfer, director of the Massachusetts Affordable Housing
Alliance. ``So the average blue-collar, lower-middle-class person is
staying in rentals longer, making more competition for rental units.
There's not enough production of affordable housing.''
   ``We've looked at some of the rent indexes, and the Northeast in
general and Boston in particular have had above-average rent
increases over the past six to eight years,'' said William Apgar,
acting director of the Joint Center for Housing Studies at Harvard
University.
   Economists say the middle class is caught in a dilemma of not
being able to save for a down payment because of high rents, but
making too much money to qualify for subsidized rentals.
   Would-be homebuyers Charlene and Stephen Tobey have been saving
for a down payment for more than three years and expect it will take
at least two more.
   ``House prices have risen so fast that it's terribly hard for
first-time home buyers,'' Mrs. Robey told The Sunday Boston Globe.
   Edward E. Zuker, president of the Rental Housing Association of
the Greater Boston Real Estate Board, said there is virtually no
construction of rental apartments in the range just below Boston's
median level.
   He said city leaders must try to work with community leaders in
encouraging construction of affordable housing.
   ``Everyone's for affordable housing as long as it's not in their
back yard,'' he said. ``There's a lot of lip service, but not a lot
of action.''

<HEAD>Judge Rules Against High Voltage</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MILWAUKEE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The head of Universal Foods Corp. welcomed
Sunday a federal court ruling that upheld his company's defenses
against a hostile $643 million takeover bid by High Voltage
Engineering Corp.
   ``We are pleased with the court's decision,'' said Guy Osborne,
president and chief executive officer of the Milwaukee-based
supplier of food and food ingredients.
   U.S. District Judge Joseph Stadtmueller issued his ruling
Saturday, denying a motion by a High Voltage that sought to
invalidate Wisconsin's anti-takeover law.
   The judge also denied a motion for a preliminary injunction
against Universal's ``poison pill'' defense against takeovers. That
defense would allow Universal shareholders to buy additional shares
of the company at half price if High Voltage were to pursue its bid.
   High Voltage said it had no immediate comment on the ruling.
   Stadtmueller rejected an argument that Universal's directors
violated their duty to shareholders by opposing the takeover and
threatening use of the poison pill.
   ``I find no evidence in the record which convinces me that the
board failed to review this offer in a dispassionate and neutral
manner,'' the judge wrote.
   High Voltage has offered $35 a share for Universal stock, which
closed Friday at $33 in New York Stock Exchange composite trading.
   Universal executives contend a takeover would damage the
company's long-term growth, including its ability to invest in
research and development of new products.
   Universal, based in Milwaukee, is a worldwide supplier of food
and food ingredients, including yeast, cheese, frozen potatoes and
food colorings. It employs about 4,600 people.

<HEAD>Dollar Firms, Stock Prices Fall In Early Trading</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The U.S. dollar firmed in early trading against the
Japanese yen Monday while stock prices fell.
   The dollar opened trading at 131.88 yen, up 0.81 yen from
Friday's close.
   A dealer with the Bank of Tokyo said the dollar remained firm in
early trading following a strong showing on overseas markets last
Friday.
   In New York, the currency closed last week at 131.68 yen
following a U.S. government report Friday that the nation's producer
price index rose a full percentage point in February, triggering a
new wave of inflation and interest-rate worries.
   There was concern over higher short-term interest rates in the
United States, said the dealer who spoke anonymously.
   On the Tokyo Stock Exchange, the Nikkei Stock Average of 225
selected issues, a 77.01-point loser last Friday, shed 315.24 points
or 0.9 percent, shortly after the market opened to move to 31,705.77.
