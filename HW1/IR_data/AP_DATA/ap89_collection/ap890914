<HEAD>Bill Would Curb El Salvador Funds</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Senate Appropriations Committee on Thursday
approved a $14.4 billion foreign aid bill that would slap
restrictions on U.S. aid to El Salvador and give Poland more aid
than President Bush has sought.
   The panel also voted to reverse a four-year-old Reagan
administration policy that barred U.S. aid to the United Nations
Population Fund, and killed an effort to cut aid to Greece.
   The committee sent the measure to the full Senate, which is
scrambling to complete work on the 13 appropriations bills needed to
run the government before the new fiscal year begins on Oct. 1.
   El Salvador's $85 million in aid for the coming year would be
divided into three slices to be sent at four-month intervals only if
the new rightist government of President Alfredo Cristiani makes
progress toward curbing death squad activity and making peace with
leftist rebels fighting his government.
   The final installment would be in effect subject to a veto by
congressional committees with jurisdiction over foreign aid money.
   Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., sponsor of the provision, was able to
prevail over the objections of the Bush administration because he
won the support of Sen. Dennis DeConcini, D-Ariz., considered a
swing vote on the issue. But Republicans were confident they had the
votes to remove the restrictions when the measure comes to the
Senate floor as early as next week.
   Bush already has managed to eliminate restrictions on Salvadoran
aid from a House version of the foreign aid bill passed in July.
   Cristiani's government is involved in peace talks in Mexico with
the leftist FMLN rebels, aimed at ending a decade of fighting that
has cost more than 70,000 lives. Death squads linked to Cristiani's
ARENA party have been blamed for most of the deaths.
   The committee also removed from the bill a provision that would
have let the president cut aid to Greece so long as military aid
money previously sent remains unspent. Greek-American groups had
lobbied hard to eliminate the provision.
   And it scaled back from $85 million to $45 million a fund to
support private enterprise in Poland. Even the scaled-back amount
was far more than the $10 million Bush promised during his trip to
Eastern Europe in July.
   The election of a new non-communist-dominated government in
Poland has made that country an irresistible object of praise and
reward for U.S. lawmakers, but the panel apparently backed down from
the figure Leahy's subcommittee had adopted a day earlier in the
face of budget realities.
   Sen. Barbara Mikulski, D-Md., prevailed 15-12 on her amendment to
earmark $15 million for the United Nations Population Fund, which
manages population control programs worldwide.
   The Reagan administration had banned money to the organization in
1985, contending that the agency was supporting forced abortions and
sterilization in China. Mikulski's amendment would require the
agency to keep U.S. funds in a separate account which cannot be used
for any programs in China.
   As usual, the largest recipients of U.S. foreign aid in the
measure are Israel, with $1.8 billion in military aid and $1.2
billion in economic aid, and Egypt, which gets $1.3 billion in
military and $815 million in economic aid.
   The bill also includes $160 million for the Multilateral
Assistance Initiative for the Philippines, together with authority
for the president to send an additional $40 million to meet his full
request for $200 million. The House voted $160 million for the
program.

   Methane gas ignited and flashed ``like a
flame thrower'' through a coal mine Wednesday, killing 10 miners in
the nation's worst coal mine disaster in five years.
   There were conflicting reports of the number of injuries in the
9:30 a.m. fire at the William Station Mine in western Kentucky, but
its parent company, Costain Coal Inc., said no one had been trapped
underground.
   The mine, run by Costain's subsidiary, Pyro Mining Co., had been
cited by the federal Mine Safety and Health Administration for high
levels of methane gas about two months ago, Costain President
Charles Schulties acknowledged at a news conference Wednesday night.
   It was the fourth fatal accident at the mine since it opened in
February 1983, including a 1986 death that may have been related to
methane, according to state and federal safety records. Nearly a
year ago, three miners were hurt in a blasting accident.
   Methane, the major ingredient of natural gas, is found naturally
in coal seams. Mine ventilation systems normally keep it below
explosive concentrations.
   Early in the day, the Kentucky State Police and the MSHA reported
three miners had been burned in the fire. A document the company
submitted to state officials included the names of two miners who
were listed as being injured.
   Schulties, however, told a news conference about six hours after
the fire that there were no injuries, and officials at area
hospitals reported receiving no injured miners. Webster County
Deputy Coroner Paul Tompkins also said late Wednesday that no miners
had been injured.
   There was no immediate explanation for the discrepancy,
   The death toll made it the nation's worst coal mine disaster
since 27 miners were killed in 1984 in a mine in Utah, said MSHA
spokesman Frank O'Gorman.
   The ignition point of the fire apparently was near part of a
mining machine that was being dismantled to be moved, O'Gorman said.
   The exact cause of the fire was not immediately known. But MSHA
spokesman Sam Stafford said such fires are usually caused when a
piece of metal equipment hits stone and causes a spark.
   Stafford said such fires are small but ``like a flame thrower.''
   Company officials said the miners who died were about 1,000 feet
underground when the explosion occurred. Jim Greenlee, an executive
vice president of Costain Coal, said 14 to 15 miners were in the
immediate area when the jet of flame erupted and another 15 workers
within 1,000 feet.
   ``There was smoke in the area and it took some time to locate all
the individuals,'' Greenlee said.
   Rescue teams were sent into the shaft to remove the bodies, said
state Trooper Ed Brady.
   ``There's an indication that some of them had survived the
initial explosion and succumbed to the smoke and dust,'' Schulties
said. ``We'll know more about that when the coroner issues his
report.''
   O'Gorman said the dead were believed to have died of carbon
monoxide poisoning.
   Officials believed some of the dead miners survived initially
because some of them were found wearing self-rescuing units, which
provide a source of fresh air for miners in emergencies, Schulties
said. He did not provide additional details.
   Public Protection Secretary Teddy Colley identified the dead as
Lynn Ashmore and Kenneth Reed of Slaughters, Roger Clifford and Mark
Hedges of Morganfield, Rick Ferguson and Curtis Scott of
Madisonville, Terry Harris and Anthony McElroy of Providence, Warren
Stewart of Mortons Gap and and James Tinsley of Marion. No ages were
immediately available.
   Police sealed off the area around the mine and families of the
dead miners were directed to a company headquarters building just
outside Wheatcroft, a town of about 300 people.
   All employees were immediately pulled out of the mine and all
workers had been accounted for, Schulties said. Kathy Snyder, an
MSHA official who attended the news conference, said her agency and
the Kentucky Department of Mines and Minerals would begin an
investigation on Thursday.
   The mine, which Schulties said employs 367 miners on three
shifts, is about 140 miles southwest of Louisville and 40 miles
southwest of Evansville, Ind.
   In 1986, a foreman died in an explosion at the mine. A federal
investigation determined that methane or dust had been set off by
the improper use of explosives during blasting. Excessive
accumulations of loose coal and coal dust were also blamed.
   Last Sept. 22, a blasting accident ignited gas or coal dust,
burning three miners, according to state mine department records.
State inspectors ordered the mine closed that day, but allowed it to
reopen the next day.
   In 1984, a worker was run over by a vehicle at the mine. In
separate accidents in 1985, a worker was crushed against a wall
while working on a machine and a mechanic was electrocuted.
   Mayor Larry Cowan, who worked 23 years in mines, said most people
of the town earn their livings in the coal industry.
   ``We know, invariably, it could happen, but it's always supposed
to be someone else,'' Cowan said.
   The mine was described as a highly mechanized longwall operation.
In longwall mining, a mining machine continuously moves a cutter
from side to side along a long exposed coal face.
   As the cutter is moved forward, with conveyors which remove the
loosened coal, hydraulic jacks are positioned to support the newly
exposed mine roof. Behind the jacks, the layers of rock that form
the roof are allowed to collapse.
   Before longwall mining techniques and machines were developed,
pillars of coal had to be left in the mine to support the overlying
rock layers.

<HEAD>French Priest Who Refused To Be Fingerprinted Jailed for Refusing

<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A French priest chose today to spend 12 days in
prison rather than pay $200 in fines for refusing to be
fingerprinted under Japan's Alien Registration Law, an official said.
   The priest, Debion Maxime, 47, was jailed in Yokohama prison, an
official from the Yokohama District Public Prosecutors Office said
on condition of anonymity.
   He said Maxime, who has lived in Japan since 1974, was a resident
of Sagamihara city, south of Tokyo.
   Maxime refused to be fingerprinted when he applied for a
registration card. His refusal was a sympathy protest over the
arrest of a South Korean resident who refused to be fingerprinted in
May 1985.
   A local court subsequently ordered Maxime to pay $684, but the
priest refused to paye. In June, the fine was reduced to $200.
   Opponents of law say the fingerprint requirement is
discriminatory and violates human rights. Violators are subject to
up to one year in prison, deportation and a fine of up to $1,400.

   A defense contractor says its F-16
fighter jets are being bombarded. By pigeons.
   And General Dynamics Corp. is planning to fight back. It has
hired an exterminator to scatter poisoned seed at its assembly plant
in west Forth Worth.
   ``Would you want to pick up a $15 million airplane full of bird
droppings?'' asked spokesman Z. Joe Thornton.
   Thornton said this week that bird droppings damage aircraft paint
and cockpit canopies.
   ``It sounds crazy, but it's a very serious problem for us,'' he
said.
   Linda Yarbrough of the Animal Liberation League, objects to the
attack plan.
   ``They could move them,'' she said. ``Pigeons are very easy to
move.''
   Steve Hamilton of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service said pigeon
extermination is allowed.
   General Dynamics builds the F-16 Fighting Falcons for the U.S.

   She may not be shaped like Miss America,
but for the judges who flagged her ``Miss Tugboat,'' she is just as
beautiful.
   As part of a day-long celebration of the resurgence of Jersey
City's waterfront, 13 tugboats chugged into New York Harbor on
Wednesday for a Tugboat Beauty Contest. The master of ceremonies
were former Miss America host Bert Parks.
   The event coincided with this year's Miss America Pageant, which
will be televised live from Atlantic City on Saturday.
   ``Beauty is all in the eye of the beholder, whether it's a cat or
a tugboat or a lady,'' said the 74-year-old Parks.
   A 105-foot, blue, white and yellow-trimmed tugboat named Rebecca
P. was crowned fairest of them all.
   The 9-year-old tug from Poling Transportation of Staten Island,
N.Y., won $2,500 for her crew and a flag proclaiming it the most
beautiful tug in the country.
   Each towboat traveled along an ``aisle,'' a channel leading into
the harbor from Jersey City, as Parks belted out the tug's vital
statistics to more than 1,000 onlookers.
   He did not have a chance to croon ``There She Is,'' the popular
Miss America theme.
   Each vessel was judged by Jersey City Mayor Gerald McCann, Hudson
County Executive Robert Janiszewski and a representative from the
Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, who rated their ``evening
gowns,'' trim, sparkle, maneuverability, charm and overall
appearance.

<TEXT>
   Imelda Marcos wants to begin an anti-crime
campaign directed at Filipino youth-gang members, and police say its
a good idea despite her being under indictment.
   Maj. David Benson, head of the Honolulu Police Department's
juvenile division, said the former Philippine first lady ``has a
knowledge of the Philippine culture that we don't, and her stature
could really have an effect on some of these kids.''
   Of the estimated 550 gang members on the island of Oahu, 45
percent are Filipino, Benson said Wednesday. Many are involved in
drug-related and violent crimes.
   Mrs. Marcos said she wanted to meet with gang members, mostly
teen-age boys, individually or in groups and listen to their
problems.
   ``I don't have to be their role model, but everybody would like a
friend, everybody needs love,'' she said.
   Mrs. Marcos acknowledged critics might call her an unsuitable
counselor because she and her husband, former Philippine President
Ferdinand Marcos, face U.S. racketeering charges accusing them of
stealing nearly $200 million from their homeland and stashing it in
the United States.
   She said she would draw on her experience as mayor of Manila and
that she wanted to repay the Filipino community in Hawaii for its
support since Marcos was exiled to Hawaii after being ousted in
February 1986.
   Benson said no program had been worked out, but he would work
with Filipino community groups and Mrs. Marcos to design a
counseling program.
   Mrs. Marcos is free on $5 million bail and is to stand trial
March 14 in New York. Her husband has been separated from the case
because of ill health.
   The 72-year-old Marcos remained in critical condition at St.
Francis Medical Center, suffering from multiple organ failure.

<HEAD>Musicians Vote to Strike City Opera</HEAD>

   City Opera officials canceled Wednesday's season
opener of the ``Barber of Seville'' after the musicians announced
they will picket in full dress in a wage dispute with the company.
   ``We will not perform while they are on strike,'' said Martin
Oppenheimer, the company's attorney and board vice chairman. Future
performances will be canceled until the strike is resolved, he said.
   ``The sad part about this is ... we will never have the
performances that have to be canceled because of the strike,'' he
said.
   Judy West, a spokeswoman for Local 802 of the Associated
Musicians of Greater New York, said, ``A strike is always
difficult,'' especially on the musicians, and is not welcomed by the
union.
   The 69 musicians voted in favor of the strike Tuesday night after
extensive negotiations, West said. The union served the company with
a seven-day strike notice last week.
   ``They've gotten nowhere'' in climbing over two stumbling blocks,
West said.
   The union wants wage parity with the Lyric Opera in Chicago.
Union officials say City Opera musicians get $755 for 19\ hours of
work and Chicago musicians get $1,048 for a 21-hour work week.
   The union also wants guaranteed work weeks restored to the
contract. Under the old contract, the union says, the orchestra was
guaranteed 23 full weeks of work plus six weeks of added employment,
called supplemental employment benefits.
   The company is offering only the 23 weeks of work.
   Oppenheimer said the Lyric Opera charges twice what City Opera
does and is ``the only game in town.''
   ``We have our own economics here in New York,'' where costs are
higher and competition more intense, he said.
   No negotiations were scheduled, Oppenheimer said.

   Three weeks ago, Lothar Klein asked
his frail and aging mother if he should head to Hungary in search of
eventual freedom in the West.
   ``She had tears in her eyes and gave me a hug,'' said the burly
27-year-old electrician from Weimar. ``She told me, `Son, you've got
to try it now while you have a good chance.'''
   Klein is among thousands of East Germans who seized the
opportunity to flee their Communist homeland after Hungary agreed to
allow them passage to the West.
   Frequently, the decision was difficult and painful.
   ``Even though I knew I had to go, it was hard to leave,'' Klein
said, his voice choked with emotion. ``I might never see her again.''
   The East German exodus comes amid widespread pressures for
democratic reforms across the East bloc. Poland has become the first
Warsaw Pact nation to install a government led by non-communists.
Hungary also is on the road to major reforms. But East Germany
remains one of the East bloc's most rigidly controlled states and
has rejected calls for change.
   Refugees said they left because they no longer could bear the
conditions.
   For many, the reality of their successful flight is just taking
hold in a jumbled emotional mixture of joy, wonder and longing for
those left behind.
   ``It's hard to leave everything behind _ your family, friends and
possessions. But then you look at your children and you say to
yourself `No, I'm not going to let this happen to them. I'm not
going to let the perverse system ruin them,''' said Manfred Lutz, a
35-year-old electrical engineer from Jena.
   Lutz said he was ostracized increasingly at his research
institute after criticizing several of its management policies.
``The system is so rigid. If you speak out, you're branded as a
troublemaker and shuttled off to a less desirable job.''
   Outside a crowded refugee center in downtown Passau, young East
German couples wait impatiently in line to call home from a bank of
public telephones.
   Inside the booth, the wait will be longer still as constant busy
signals remind them of the frustrating lack of phone lines in their
homeland.
   ``We've been trying for hours to call home,'' sobbed a woman in
her early 20s. ``Our parents still don't know we left.''
   Most refugees left with only a few hastily packed belongings.
   ``We didn't really want for any material comforts,'' said Sabine
Schoenborn, an outgoing mother of two who instructed athletes in
Leipzig. ``But life there becomes intolerable when you finally
realize with horror that the system is not going to change, not in
your lifetime and probably not in your children's.''
   Her husband, Juergen, said the family lived comfortably because
of their careers in sports, a major source of international prestige
for the nation of 16.6 million.
   ``I helped train some of our best athletes. But you can't live
without hope, and that fades quickly when you recognize how
impenetrable the system really is,'' said Schoenborn, wearing a
faded jeans jacket over a new jogging suit bought in Passau's
teeming shopping mall.
   Even before they left Leipzig, the Shoenborns said they could see
the growing impact of the exodus.
   Neighborhood shops had been forced to close because all the
workers had left, he said, and their nearby medical clinic was left
with only a few overworked doctors.
   Frank Kuhnert, a 29-year-old stage-lighting technician who worked
at East Berlin's Deutsches Theater, said the frustration of not
being able to travel abroad and ``unnecessary day-to-day hassles''
prompted him to give up a prestigious job.
   ``I simply got tired of having to crawl to petty officials for
every little thing. You're treated like a child by goons with
privileges whose job it is to see that you don't get any,'' he said.
   His request to join the stage crew that went abroad on company
tours repeatedly was denied, he said.
   ``So you end up listening to other people's stories about how
great it was outside beyond the (Berlin) Wall.''
   Many refugees expressed concern that their departure could make
things worse for those who stay behind.
   ``Some people told us we would just make it harder for those who
can't or don't want to leave,'' said Katrin Albrecht, a 24-year-old
music student from Dresden.
   ``But you have to do what you think is right, even if it's
painful. I just hope that what I and others have done will force the
government to wake up and listen to the people clamoring for change,
for a little dignity in their lives,'' she said.

<TEXT>
   For Hondurans in this isolated valley
where a Nicaraguan Contra army has been camped, the last
year-and-a-half has meant prosperity.
   ``Business is good. We'll sell it all,'' Krystela Rodriguez
exulted. She runs a shop crammed with everything from cologne and
shampoo to powdered fruit drinks and baby shoes.
   Perhaps most remarkable for her 10- by 20-foot shack 80 miles
from the nearest paved road is the refrigerator, which runs on
electricity from a diesel generator that also provides power for a
nearby Contra encampment.
   A cloud is on her horizon, however: the accord reached by Central
American leaders Aug. 7 calling for the Contra army to disband by
Dec. 8. She still has a lot of shampoo to sell and is concerned
about being overstocked.
   ``There's no future here after the Contras leave,'' said Vladimir
Valenzuela, who runs a bustling restaurant in Danli, 80 miles to the
west.
   Eastern Honduras has always been poor and sparsely populated. The
average agricultural worker earned 3 lempiras a day _ less than $1
at the black market exchange rate. Farms were few. Small ranchers
had no way to get their products to market.
   The Yamales area, which has no more than a few hundred residents
in normal times, was almost completely abandoned in the mid-1980s,
at the height of the Contra campaign to topple the Sandinista
government in Nicaragua.
   The Nicaraguan border is less than 10 miles away, and the
Sandinista army swept through more than once in search of Contras.
   But when thousands of Contra fighters began moving out of
Nicaragua after the United States cut off military aid early in
1988, the impact was immediate on Yamales.
   The United States has kept up non-lethal aid, Contra fighters and
their families began to find work, and there was a market for
practically everything.
   The people of eastern Honduras went to work.
   Las Trojes, 18 miles to the west, and Danli, 60 miles away,
became boomtowns where many fighters' relatives settled. Cheap
hotels and restaurants served truck drivers, and Las Trojes even had
a small casino with rudimentary versions of craps and roulette.
   ``A lot of them are doing real well. They've got a road now,''
noted Israel Galeano, the Contra chief of staff known as ``Commander
Franklin.''
   The Contras built and maintain the road in from Las Trojes. Now
more roads branch off that one. Many ranchers in the area are
building wood corrals to replace old barbed wire ones.
   ``The corral started getting too full and the animals starting
cutting themselves on the wire,'' said Mercedes Martinez. She and
her husband, Mario, have cattle and chickens and sell milk, meat and
eggs to the Contras.
   Nicaraguans have established small businesses and farms of their
own as well, especially in the roadless mountains that stretch 100
miles northeast along the Nicaragua-Honduras border to Bocay. Jungle
has been cleared for cattle or corn crops.
   Paula Zentena, whose husband is a Contra soldier, found she could
make money by altering U.S.-provided fatigue uniforms for the Contra
soldiers.
   ``They're usually too baggy for the boys,'' she said as she ran
off a seam on her new, treadle-powered sewing machine. She rents
space in a Honduran house and has two Nicaraguan fighters working
for her, charging 3 lempiras to alter a pair of pants.
   Balancio Blandon, a Honduran who started out with a small shop,
has been able to build a new, brick store and home for himself, his
wife and their five children. He also bought a Canon camera and now
runs a photo service.
   He doesn't see the boom coming to an end soon, especially with
U.S. aid continuing until February _ and probably longer for Contra
families and wounded fighters in the area.

   The U.S. military presence is small but slowly spreading in the
heart of South America's cocaine country.
   Expansion is most evident in Peru, where about 20 U.S. Army
Special Forces members quietly arrived three months ago and are
providing paramilitary training to national police in their battle
against a fearsome alliance of cocaine traffickers and Maoist
guerrillas.
   In Bolivia, where the fight is less dramatic but equally
entrenched, about a dozen Green Berets have been conducting training
and support operations from low-profile jungle base camps for years.
   The confidential White House directive giving the American
military more leeway in the drug war was crafted with Peru and
Bolivia in mind, according to officials in Washington.
   In Colombia, home to the biggest cocaine cartels, U.S. officials
deny any military intentions beyond those associated with the
delivery of hardware.
   About 200 soldiers, including advisers, trainers and technicians,
accompanied the recent arrival of two C-130 transport planes, A-37
observation and attack jets, UH-1H Huey helicopters and other
equipment in an emergency U.S. aid package for Colombia's
anti-narcotics offensive.
   But U.S. Ambassador Thomas McNamara told reporters the U.S. crews
would get the gear working, give some instruction and then get out _
most of them within a few hours or days.
   Colombian President Virgilio Barco repeatedly has insisted his
country wants U.S. money and equipment, not troops.
   Direct American military action would almost inevitably produce a
wave of anti-U.S. nationalism and would certainly embarrass the
Barco government, which has pressed for the United States to get out
of Central American conflicts.
   Peru and Bolivia, much poorer countries, also oppose major U.S.
troop involvement but have allowed some training and support
personnel to operate.
   In Peru, about 20 bilingual Green Berets began instructing
anti-narcotics police at a special base near the central jungle town
of Satipo, officials from the U.S. Embassy in Lima told The
Associated Press.
   ``It's intensive training, almost one-on-one,'' said embassy
spokesman Gene Bigler. ``They're taking small groups of 40 to 50
policemen and training them five weeks at a time.
   ``There's one whole section on entering and leaving helicopters
under fire.''
   He said the policemen also are taught map reading, battlefield
first aid, jungle patrols and night patrols.
   ``It's the same kind of paramilitary training that DEA agents are
now getting before they arrive in Peru,'' Bigler said.
   The training program is designed to last two years, with
Peruvians then taking over the instruction.
   Bigler said U.S. authorities hoped the trained Peruvian officers
would be assigned to a newly built, heavily fortified police
garrison at Santa Lucia.
   Several former Green Berets on contract to the U.S. government
for anti-narcotics efforts in Peru designed the Santa Lucia base,
which includes an airstrip big enough for C-130s, three helicopter
pads and nine buildings ringed by barbed wire and mines.
   It is the centerpiece in a new, militarized strategy in Peru,
where most of the world's coca is cultivated. Much of it is grown in
jungle areas controlled by the Shining Path, a Maoist guerrilla
organization.
   ``Santa Lucia is probably better fortified than most military
bases in Peru,'' said Craig Chretien, the Drug Enforcement
Administration chief in Peru.
   Pistol-packing DEA agents have been seen routinely accompanying
Bolivian, Colombian and Peruvian police in raids on cocaine
processing laboratories and traffickers' jungle hideouts. About six
U.S. Border Patrol agents assist in interdiction efforts. They are
all under strict orders to avoid armed clashes.
   DEA agents are among the U.S. military's harshest critics.
   Speaking privately, they contend that U.S. soldiers lack
political sensitivity. They fear an increased American military role
would bruise Latin egos and ruin relations with local authorities
and sources.
   ``If the Special Forces come down here on raids, I am pulling out
of here. They are going to come down here thinking this is a war
zone and start shooting at farmers, when what you need here is
another kind of presence,'' said one DEA agent in Bolivia.
   When Green Berets accompanied Bolivian police on a raid in April,
a U.S. soldier walked off with a confiscated shortwave radio,
insulting a police commander who told him the radio had to be
properly registered, sources said. DEA agents had to intervene in
the dispute.
   Nonetheless, about a dozen Green Berets have worked with the
Bolivian police force's elite anti-narcotics division, called the
Leopards, for more than two years. It is widely acknowledged that
disclipine among the Leopards has improved.
   The U.S. Embassy in La Paz, the Bolivian capital, said it is
ready to extend the instruction program.
   ``U.S. troops will not seek out conflict or combat, but we are
prepared to expand our training role,'' embassy spokesman Bruce
Wharton said.
   The biggest U.S. military splash in the drug battle was made in
July 1986, when 175 U.S. soldiers descended on Bolivia and helped
the Leopards raid laboratories in the country's tropical lowlands.
   The three-month operation drove traffickers underground and
paralyzed cocaine processing operations in Bolivia, the source of up
to 30 percent of the world's cocaine.
   But officials reported no noticeable effect on the flow of the
potent white powder from South America to the United States.

   Heavy-footed drivers may think they've
taken a wrong turn on the New Jersey Turnpike and gone to heaven _
some of the electronic speed limit signs are mistakenly reading 75
mph.
   State police and turnpike authority officials said the erroneous
speed limit has been flashing on about half a dozen of the lighted
signs in northern New Jersey because of a computer programming
error. The legal limit is 55 mph.
   Gordon Hector, a spokesman for the turnpike authority, said
technicians were trying to track down the problem. Meanwhile,
workers are adjusting the errant signs manually.
   Some motorists find it funny.
   ``It was kind of strange to see everybody below the speed limit
for a change,'' joked Casey Raskob, an attorney from Springfield.
   A state police official said no traffic problems were reported as
result. ``But I don't think any judge is gonna buy that excuse'' for
speeding, he said.

   People who've been wronged by a boss,
jilted by a lover or otherwise insulted, are finding the ultimate
revenge has just plopped in their laps.
   A new company catering to the revenge-minded will send a genuine
cow pie _ nestled in an 8-inch pie tin, wrapped in plastic and boxed
like baked goods _ for $16.95, or $9.95 on special. Fake flies are
75 cents extra.
   ``They have no idea what they're getting _ they think it's an
apple pie in red cellophane,'' said Jennifer Sanders, president of
Cowpies, recently founded in this San Francisco Bay-area city.
   Sanders and her two partners _ Gayle Massey, a San Francisco
advertiser, and Santa Monica businessman Donald Grant _ actually
scour the fields for the real thing.
   So far, they've filled about 100 orders. Many are for birthday
parties, but nearly half of the pies carry a more pointed message.
One homeowner ordered a pie for a carpenter whose work he didn't
like; another sent a bovine confection to his bank.
   More popular are orders from employees seeking a memorable gift
for a boss or co-worker.
   ``It's strictly anonymous unless they specify otherwise,''
Sanders said. ``But some people do put their names with really awful
things.''

   A tank barge carrying 3.8 million gallons of
gasoline ran aground in the East River Tuesday night, causing what
the U.S. Coast Guard termed a ``major gasoline spill.''
   Authorities closed parts of the East River and the Triborough
Bridge as a precaution.
   The barge, the Marania 440, was being towed by the tugboat East
Coast when the barge struck bottom and ran aground just north of the
Triborough Bridge at about 9:45 p.m., said Petty Officer Jeff
Crawley, of the Coast Guard public affairs at Governor's Island.
   An undetermined amount of gasoline was leaking into the river,
Crawley said.
   ``We're talking like a major gasoline spill, but I don't know any
amount at this time,'' Crawley said.
   Crawley said Coast Guard pollution personnel were on the scene,
working with the fire and police departments, the city Office of
Emergency Management and Department of Environmental Protection and
the state Department of Environmental Conservation.

<DATELINE>BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Lawmakers have launched an inquiry into
reports of American, Israeli and British mercenaries operating
freely in Colombia to train scores of paramilitary groups, including
drug traffickers.
   Colombian congressmen, along with Minister of Defense Gen. Oscar
Botero, watched a film Wednesday night at the Congress building of
alleged paramilitary training in Colombia.
   Scenes included men firing guns from moving vehicles, practicing
assaults on houses, and taking explosives training. The film was
made available by the Bogota television news program Noticiero
Nacional.
   A Colombian police general who appeared at the hearings Wednesday
said in a televised interview he had told lawmakers a month ago that
foreign mercenaries were training the paramilitary groups.
   The general, Miguel Daza Marquez, heads Colombia's Administrative
Security Police, which handles national criminal investigations.
   Foreign Minister Julio Londono Paredes told the lawmakers,
however, that the Ministry had no proof foreign mercenaries had
actually trained Colombian drug traffickers or paramilitary groups.
   But he acknowledged there were no restrictions on many foreigners
who want to travel to this South American republic.
   ``British, German and Israeli nationals, in accordance with
agreements with the respective countries, don't need a visa to enter
this country,'' said the foreign minister. ``As for nationals of the
United States, they only need a tourist card.''
   Colombian media reported last month that former Israeli army
colonel Yair Klein and other foreign mercenaries trained drug
traffickers' hit squads in Colombia.
   The traffickers have used their private armies to recruit
right-wing death squads that have killed more than 1,000 Colombian
leftists in the last four years.
   The congressional investigation comes amid a U.S.-backed war that
President Virgilio Barco declared on the world's most powerful drug
cartels after the assassination Aug. 18 of Sen. Luis Carlos Galan, a
popular presidential candidate and foe of the drug barons.
   In Medellin, home of a leading drug gang, Mayor Juan Gomez on
Wednesday lifted a nighttime curfew imposed two weeks ago in an
attempt to stem a rash of bombings, killings and arson blamed on the
traffickers.
   Motorists still must drive at night with their inside lights on,
however, and there is a ban on motorcycles from 6:30 p.m. to 6 a.m.
Most firebombings in the city are the work of speeding motorcyclists.
   Gomez said he lifted the curfew because his city had returned to
``absolute normalcy.'' No bombs had exploded in Medellin for three
days.
   The lifting of the curfew highlights the mayor's disagreement
with the government about how to deal with narco-terrorism.
   Gomez favors negotiating with the drug barons, a tactic Barco
rejects.
   Also Wednesday, the government reinforced security in the
Medellin region, sending hundreds of additional police and soldiers
to Antioquia state.
   Medellin, a city of 2 million people, is the capital of Antioquia.
   The measures followed the assassination Monday of former Medellin
mayor Pablo Pelaez Gonzalez by unidenfied gunmen. Pelaez was an avid
drug fighter.
   The government vows to continue its crackdown, but Colombia's
most wanted trafficking suspects have so far eluded the manhunt.
   Barco said he will extradite those traffickers who are arrested
and wanted in the United States.
   The only alleged drug cartel member extradited in the crackdown
so far is Eduardo Martinez Romero, charged with laundering more than
a billion dollars of cocaine money.

   Hugo became a hurricane Wednesday evening as it sped
westward toward the Caribbean, but forecasters said it was too early
to determine whether it was a threat to land.
   ``The longer it heads west, the more concern it is to us,'' said
Hal Gerrish, a forecaster for the National Hurricane Center. ``But
we're not sure yet where it will go _ there are too many things that
can happen.''
   Hugo's most recent predecessors, hurricanes Dean, Erin and
Gabrielle, turned north into the open Atlantic before reaching the
Caribbean, Gerrish noted. But last year's killer Hurricane Gilbert
remained on the westward course, wreaking havoc on the Caribbean and
Mexico.
   At 10:30 p.m. EDT, Hugo's center was located near 12.9 north
latitude and 46.3 west longitude, or about 965 miles east of the
easternmost Lesser Antilles, and was moving west at 20 mph.
Sustained winds reached 75 mph, just over the hurricane threshold,
and further strengthening was expected.
   Meanwhile, Gabrielle was downgraded to an extratropical storm as
it moved through the North Atlantic, and the center stopped issuing
bulletins on it. Its last position was about 225 miles southeast of
Cape Race, Newfoundland, Canada, moving northeast at 20 to 25 mph
with winds of 55 mph.
   Gabrielle and Hugo are the seventh and eighth named storms of the
1989 Atlantic hurricane season. They become storms when sustained
winds reach 39 mph and are classified as hurricanes when the
strength increases to 74 mph.

luck fighting drugs by legalizing them.

conservative pundit told reporters Wednesday at the University of
Mississippi before a broadcast of his TV talk show, ``Firing Line.''
   ``Our borders are indefensible,'' he said, explaining the
legalization rationale. ``The overhead cost for penetrating the U.S.
borders is only 3 percent of the street value of imported illegal
drugs. We should attack what we can, legalize drugs and concentrate
on drug education.''
   That's not to say Buckley is soft on drug abusers. He's
especially ready to crack down on those who sell drugs to minors:
``In my case, I would support capital punishment.''

<HEAD>Jewish Leaders Discuss Formal Contacts With Catholics</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The president of the European Jewish Congress has
disputed a French colleague's claim that the organization has backed
a call for freezing all formal contacts between Jewish groups and
the Roman Catholic Church.
   ``They have not been frozen. This is not my interpretation of
what was said or wanted,'' Lionel Kopelowitz, British president of
the 17-nation organization, said Wednesday.
   But French delegate Theo Klein, the congress' past president and
chief Jewish negotiator in a dispute over a Carmelite convent at the
Nazi death camp at Auschwitz in occupied Poland, reiterated that the
congress backed freezing formal, high-level contacts.
   Kopelowitz and Klein commented in interviews on questions arising
from a news conference they held Monday after the congress' two-day
annual meeting.
   The London meeting, largely behind closed doors, was dominated by
the issue of the convent, which many Jews regard as offensive. Of
the 4 million people killed at the Auschwitz death camp in World War
II, 2.5 million were Jews.
   Klein led an international Jewish negotiating team that in 1987
reached an agreement with a Polish Catholic representative to
relocate the convent by Feb. 22.
   But the convent remains and the Polish primate, Cardinal Jozef
Glemp, has said the accord was not negotiated by competent people.
   At Monday's news conference, Klein said that on July 20 he told
French Cardinal Albert Decourtray in a letter that all ``dialogue
and official meetings'' were frozen until the Carmelite convent
dispute was resolved.
   Klein added that the European Jewish Congress meeting had
endorsed this position ``because this decision was the decision of
the Jewish delegation and all the work of the Jewish delegation was
approved by the conference.''
   Kopelowitz, seated beside Klein on Monday, did not contradict
this statement, although he referred several times to the formal
resolutions passed by the meeting. These made no mention of a freeze
in Catholic-Jewish relations, although they did endorse the position
of the Jewish negotiating team.
   Hayim Pinner, secretary-general of the Board of Deputies of
British Jews, said Wednesday that Klein's interpretation of this as
endorsing a freezing of formal contacts was ``reasonably fair, but
perhaps he went a bit far.''
   ``My sensitivity in interpretation would be that, without having
specifically discussed this or specifically endorsed it, there was
an undercurrent of feeling that we couldn't engage in major
negotiations, have business as usual,'' said Pinner.
   European Jewish Congress sources said on condition of anonymity
Wednesday that Kopelowitz did not intervene because he felt that if
he had, ``headlines will appear in all the papers saying Jewish
leaders are in disagreement.''
   The sources said that, instead, Kopelowitz ``tried gently'' to
draw attention to the formal resolutions.
   The sources also said Kopelowitz had not invited Klein to join
him at the news conference.
   Klein, in a telephone interview from Paris, said the congress
approved the freezing of Catholic-Jewish relations as set out in his
July letter. He said the letter was ``not a personal position'' but
had been approved by the Jewish negotiating team and other Jewish
organizations.
   Reiterating that the congress had supported the letter, Klein
said: ``Because it was not the important point of our deliberations
you have no mention of that in the resolutions we took.''
   The conflicting views appear to reflect differences about the
repercussions of the dispute on Jewish-Catholic relations.
   Both Kopelwitz and Klein agreed that informal contacts continue.
These include Klein's contacts with European cardinals who want the
1987 accord honored and the convent removed.
   But Klein argued that all formal contacts are frozen, and he said
Catholics understand this because the convent dispute overshadows
Catholic-Jewish relations.

<HEAD>Koch Defeat `Sweet Revenge' for Jesse Jackson</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DONALD M. ROTHBERG</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Political Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Political analysts view Ed Koch's defeat in New
York's mayoral primary as ``sweet revenge'' for Jesse Jackson and
are speculating whether it will spur the two-time presidential
candidate into a race for mayor of the nation's capital.
   ``He really does need to get his hands on an office somewhere,''
said Robert Beckel, manager of Walter Mondale's 1984 presidential
campaign, a role in which he had frequent and often frustrating
dealings with Jackson.
   Ann Lewis, a close Jackson adviser in the 1988 presidential
campaign, said black politicians such as David Dinkins, the winner
of the Democratic mayoral primary in New York, were ``encouraged
and, in some cases, empowered'' by Jackson's presidential bids.
   Their success, she added, raises more and more ``the suggestion
that he should be doing the same. For all the reasons he encourages
them and voters to put their energies into the immediate political
process are the same reasons why he might be encouraged to do the
same.''
   Jackson is described by associates as strongly interested in
running for mayor of Washington even if it requires challenging the
incumbent Marion Barry, an old friend from the days both were active
in the civil rights movement.
   Barry has been forced repeatedly to deny rumors of cocaine use. A
federal grand jury is investigating Barry's alleged ties to a
convicted drug dealer.
   Democratic Party Chairman Ronald H. Brown, another Jackson
associate, was less willing to read too much about Jackson into the
New York election results.
   ``I think it is really, truly, purely a David Dinkins victory,''
said the party chairman.
   Asked if the results would have any impact on Jackson's future,
Brown replied, ``I don't see it.'' He pointed out that he took the
same view when a Jackson-backed candidate was defeated in the race
for mayor of Chicago earlier in the year.
   ``I think we tend to maybe overplay those things when they
happen,'' he said.
   But there could be little doubt that the defeat of Koch, who said
during the 1988 New York presidential primary campaign that Jewish
voters would ``have to be crazy'' to support Jackson, was satisfying
to the former presidential candidate.
   ``It settled the score he had with Koch,'' said Beckel.
   ``It is sweet revenge,'' said Bill Schneider, a political analyst
at the American Enterprise Institute who has written extensively on
Democratic Party affairs. ``One of his (Jackson's) top priorities
was getting rid of Ed Koch.''
   Schneider called Jackson ``the spokesman for movement politics of
the left.''
   ``It was not a personal victory (for Jackson),'' he went on. ``It
was a victory for his model of politics,'' in which the Democratic
Party is led by the left. ``The question is, is this a winning
strategy even in New York?''
   Dinkins still faces Republican Rudolph Giuliani in the November
general election.
   ``I don't want to call it revenge,'' said Lewis, who went on to
say that Koch's defeat ``clearly had its roots in that (1988) New
York primary.''
   She said the mayor ``never recovered'' in the eyes of a
substantial number of the city's white voters. Exit polls indicated
Dinkins received up to a third of the white vote against Koch and 96
percent of the black vote.

<HEAD>Former Nevada Governor Dies of Heart Attack</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CARSON CITY, Nev. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Charles Russell, a newspaper publisher
who turned to politics and served as governor and congressman, died
of a heart attack. He was 85.
   Russell died Wednesday, two days after being hospitalized for
breathing problems. He suffered from emphysema, a lung illness he
contracted from cigarette smoking, and had a cardiac arrest, said
his son Todd.
   Russell, a Republican, was governor from 1951 to 1958, when he
was defeated in a bid for a third term by Democrat Grant Sawyer.
   He served two terms in the state Assembly and three terms in the
state Senate, one term in Congress and several years administering
the Marshall Plan in Europe and foreign aid programs in Paraguay.
   Russell was publisher of the Ely Record between 1929 and 1946,
competing against Vail Pittman's Ely Daily Times. The two were
political rivals, with Russell defeating Pittman twice for governor.
   While governor, Russell pushed for creation of the state Gaming
Control Board, the enforcement arm for the Nevada Gaming Commission,
which oversees casinos.
   Approval of the Control Board by the 1955 Legislature was viewed
by Russell as one of his top achievements as the state's chief
executive.
   Russell is survived by his wife, Marjorie Anne, and five
children: Clark, Craig, David and Todd, and Virginia Sakal. Funeral
arrangements were pending.

   Evangelist Oral Roberts, the faith healer who
built a religious empire on the credo ``expect a miracle,'' says he
can't wait for divine intervention to save his ministry's hospital
and medical school.
   Because of $25 million in debts, the hospital will be closed by
the end of the year and the medical school next year, Roberts said
Wednesday. His home, four other ministry-owned houses and a
university housing complex will be sold to pay off the debts, he
said.
   ``I hope we can look back at this and say this wasn't a
failure,'' the 71-year-old pioneer of television evangelism told
reporters. ``I don't think it's as bad a day as it seems. I think
we'll look back on this and think it's the right thing.''
   Roberts said the action would help keep the 4,300-student Oral
Roberts University financially secure.
   Mayor Rodger Randle agreed, adding that the City of Faith
hospital, which opened in 1981, ``was born in controversy and was a
big gamble on the proposition that a national medical market could
be created.''
   Roberts built the hospital with a 777-bed capacity, but state
regulators only approved filling 294 beds, and the highest average
occupancy was 148 in 1984. Still Roberts said, ``I would do it
again.''
   The ministry's financial problems were compounded by a drop in
monthly contributions that Roberts blamed on a ``spirit of
skepticism'' in the wake of scandals involving fellow evangelists
Jim Bakker and Jimmy Swaggart.
   Roberts, himself, caused a furor in 1986 when he announced he
needed $8 million for his medical school by April 1, 1987, or God
would end his life. The money was raised.
   On Wednesday, Roberts raised the possibility of ``some miracle''
providing a $50 million endowment he says is needed.
   ``Who knows that when this is known across America that someone
we might have been dealing with, or someone we haven't been dealing
with, might say, `I've got the $50 million,''' Roberts said. But he
is not waiting for a benefactor.
   ``Integrity means we have to tell our students now,'' Roberts
said. ``We feel that integrity demands that we give them a full
year's notice.''
   Dr. Larry Edwards, dean of the medical school, said its charter
will become inactive when classes end next May, but its
accreditation could be reactivated later.
   The hospital, part of a futuristic complex with 60-story,
30-story and 20-story gold-tiled towers, will be leased and the
revenue generated dedicated to the ministry's endowment, Roberts
said.
   The ministry's five homes and an 830-unit apartment complex will
be sold, said chief fiscal officer Mark Swadener. Oral Roberts'
6,328-square-foot, four-bedroom home was valued at about $500,000 in
1987. His son Richard's 7,091-square-foot, two-story home was valued
at $547,000 that year.
   Swadener did not have an estimate of how much money the actions
announced Wednesday would generate.
   ``After the dust has settled, we'll take a look at it,'' he said.
   Roberts said he had an emotional meeting with students, faculty
and ministry workers to explain the crisis.
   ``I asked the Lord to not let me cry because I've cried all the
tears I thought I could cry. And sure enough, I didn't cry,'' he
said.
   Edwards said 600 hospital staff members would be affected.
   Many will be able to find work at one of the city's five other
hospitals, predicted Ira Schlezinger, vice president of Hillcrest
Medical Center in Tulsa.
   Edwards said 147 students are enrolled in the medical school, and
about 100 faculty members are on contract until the end of the
school year. Non-graduating students will be assisted in obtaining
transfers to other medical schools, he said.
   Students expressed optimism.
   ``It's not going to stop me from being a doctor and it's not
going to stop me from being a medical missionary,'' said David
Chorley.
   ``If the $50 million doesn't come in, God will provide me with
another medical school,'' said Doug Rober.

   If you think a fast-food chicken sandwich is a
healthy alternative to a hamburger, think again. A report today says
typical fast-food chicken and fish is just as bad _ and sometimes
worse _ than burgers and fries. By the time they are cooked, coated
and fried, they are loaded with fat.
   The report by the Massachusetts Medical Society notes that folks
often choose a chicken sandwich or nuggets in the mistaken belief
that these foods are better for them than beef.
   ``Many people are quite surprised to find that the total fat in a
single hamburger may be 13 grams but six chicken nuggets may have 20
grams of fat,'' said Connie Roberts.
   ``In contrast, a fish sandwich, by the time it's coated and has a
slice of cheese and sauce, is up to 25 grams of fat.''
   Put another way, a fast-food chicken patty sandwich contains as
much fat as 1{ pints of ice cream.
   Roberts, a Brigham and Women's Hospital dietitian who wrote the
report, said fast-food chains should give consumers more information
about what they are eating. Her report published in the New England
Journal of Medicine recommends that the chains:
   _ Reveal the type and quantity of fat in food, as well as the
amount of protein, vitamins and minerals.
   _ Provide printed menus for people who want to restrict their
intake of salt, calories or fat.
   _ Identify the nutrient content of items on salad bars,
especially such selections as potato salad and dressings.
   _ Offer such alternatives as low-fat or skim milk, margarine,
low-fat salad dressings and whole-grain buns.
   ``I find that my clients and patients are very well aware of the
recommendation to include more fish and chicken in their diets,''
she said. ``In their natural state, they are indeed much lower in
saturated fat and total fat than red meats. Unfortunately, what we
forget when the order is placed is the method of preparation that
goes into chicken sandwiches and chicken nuggets.''
   In fairness to the fast-food industry, the report notes that
nutrient-poor, fat-filled food also can be found at home, in
high-priced restraurants and in school cafeterias. However, because
so many people eat fast food _ one-fifth of all Americans every day
_ the medical profession should be concerned about its effect on
health and nutrition, the report said.
   The report noted that in general, fast food is high in fat, salt
and protein but low in fiber, vitamins and other nutrients.
   Among specifics, gathered from a variety of research:
   _ Between 40 and 55 percent of calories in most fast-food meals
come from fat. Several health organizations recommend that no more
than 30 percent of the day's calories come from fat.
   _ Chicken nuggets and chicken-patty sandwiches often are made
with chicken skin, which is high in fat. They also may be cooked in
beef tallow or in vegetable oil that's high in saturated fat.
   _ Six chicken nuggets have 310 calories, and nearly 60 percent of
the calories are from fat.
   _ A double hamburger with sauce, milkshake and regular-size
french fries contain 1,275 calories. That's between half and 80
percent of the recommended daily calories for a woman under age 50.
   _ A typical fast-food sandwich contains between 700 and 900
milligrams of sodium. Some of them, such as a cheeseburger with
bacon, may exceed the entire recommended daily allowance.
   Roberts said many doctors and other health workers are reluctant
to simply tell patients to stay away from fast food.
   ``They realize that's impractical advice,'' she said. ``We do
better if we train our patients about what to order when they go
into a fast food restaurant.''

<HEAD>House Passes Commodities Trading Reform Package</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN M. DOYLE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Legislation reforming the commodity futures
trading industry will strengthen the authority of federal
regulators, say lawmakers.
   The Commodity Futures Improvements Act, which passed the House
420-to-0 on Wednesday, makes sweeping changes in trading practices
exposed in last month's indictments of 45 brokers and traders and a
clerk at the Chicago Mercantile Exchange and Chicago Board of Trade.
   The bill also would give extra muscle to the Commodity Futures
Trading Commission, which congressional critics have called too
gentle a watchdog of the nation's futures markets.
   ``With this action, the House makes clear that the integrity of
futures markets will be maintained and that the public's interest
will be protected,'' said Rep. Glenn English, D-Okla., who
co-sponsored the bill with Rep. Thomas Coleman, R-Mo.
   ``This bill is an attempt to restore public confidence to these
markets,'' said Coleman.
   The bill, if passed by the Senate and signed by the president,
would:
   _Ban insider trading on the nation's 13 active futures exchanges;
   _Require floor traders, those who trade only for themselves and
not for outside customers, to register with the CFTC;
   _Limit trading among broker associations that could conflict with
customers' accounts, and,
   _Severely restrict the practice of dual trading.
   In dual trading, floor traders on an exchange can trade for
themselves as well as their customers on the same day. While not
illegal, the practice has raised questions about whether traders
take care of themselves ahead of their customers. Supporters of the
practice say it helps maintain market liquidity when there are few
customer orders.
   The House also added an amendment that would require that future
presidential appointees to the CFTC have some ``demonstrated
knowledge'' of futures trading, its regulation or the production,
merchandising, processing or distribution of goods subject to
futures contracts.
   ``We can no longer afford to conduct on-the-job training for the
agency's commissioners,'' said English, the amendment's sponsor.
   President Bush has nominated Margot Machol, a member of the
Federal Trade Commission with little experience in commodity futures
matters, to a spot on the five-member CFTC.
   The Senate has yet to take up the CFTC's reauthorization, but
Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., chairman of the Agriculture, Nutrition
and Forestry Committee, said last week he was asking staffers to
draw up legislation to correct gaps in the agency's surveillance of
trading activities.
   The House bill also requires exchanges to maintain accurate
trading records so investigators can reconstruct any given
transaction.
   The Chicago indictments included numerous charges of customers
defrauded through falsified trading records. Transactions on the
Chicago exchanges, as well as others around the country, use
handwritten paper cards to record sales and purchases with the
trader entering the information.
   Within weeks of the indictments, the two big Chicago exchanges
announced they were working to develop hand-held computer terminals
to record floor trading.
   One year after enactment, the bill would require exchanges to
develop systems that would pinpoint the time of a trade's execution
to within one minute of its occurrence.
   That standard would be tightened to 30 seconds within three years
of enactment.
   The bill also would make permanent the CFTC, which Congress has
reauthorized on a temporary basis every three or four years since it
was created in 1974.

<HEAD>Report: KGB Man Says British Spy Ring Had A Fifth Member</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A senior KGB official says the four-man British spy
ring that betrayed Western secrets to Moscow for more than three
decades was aided by a fifth man, a London newspaper reported today.
   The Independent quoted Yuri Modin as saying in Moscow Wednesday
when asked by its reporter Rupert Cornwell if there was a fifth
member: ``Yes there was.''
   There has been repeated news media speculation in Britain over
the years about the existence of a so-called fifth man.
   The Independent identified Modin as the Soviet intelligence
agency's key contact with one of the ring, Kim Philby, and the
controller of three other members _ Anthony Blunt, Guy Burgess and
Donald Maclean.
   Cornwell reported that he spoke with Modin following a news
conference given in Moscow Wednesday by KGB officers and attended by
foreign reporters.
   The news conference was held after the screening of a film called
``The KGB Today'' made by the Soviet government news agency Novosti
and billed as the first Soviet documentary about the organization.
   Cornwell said the film identified Modin, who was an attache at
the Soviet Embassy in London in 1951, as a ``KGB colleague who had
worked with Kim Philby abroad.''
   But Cornwell said reference works on the spy ring showed that
Modin was ``no mere friend of Philby during the last 25 years of his
life in Moscow.''
   He reported that Modin ``had been ... controller of Anthony
Blunt, and of Guy Burgess and Donald Maclean when they fled in 1951.
For years after that he would remain the key Soviet contact of
Philby himself.''
   Cornwell added: ``I inquired of Mr. Modin after the press
conference: `Well then, was there really a fifth man?' `Yes there
was,' said the person better placed to know than anyone.''
   Cornwell continued: ``And so the obvious question: who was he?
`British counter-intelligence has been trying to work that one out
without success for nearly 30 years now,' was all Mr. Modin would
answer.''
   Cornwell gave no other details on this.
   Philby became a Soviet agent in 1933. When he ran the Soviet desk
of Britain's MI6 agency responsible for gathering foreign
intelligence he told the Soviets who was spying on them.
   He served in Washington as liason officer with the U.S. Central
Intelligence Agency, fled to Moscow in 1963 while posing as a
journalist in Beirut and died in Moscow in May 1988 at age 76.
   Art historian Blunt recruited spies for Moscow in the 1930s and
spied for the Soviets during World War II while working for
Britain's MI5 counter-intelligence service.
   He was unmasked in 1964 but was granted immunity in return for
information about Soviet spying. He was publicly exposed in 1979 and
stripped of his knighthood awearded for his services as art adviser
to Queen Elizabeth II. He died in London in March 1983 at age 75.
   Burgess became a Soviet agent in the 1930s. He worked as a
British diplomat in Washington and looked after Far Eastern affairs
during the Korean War.
   Maclean was posted to Washington as a British diplomat in 1944
but was recalled home because of heavy drinking. He worked with
Americans and Canadians on the Combined Policy Committee for Joint
Atomic Development and gave the Soviets documents on nuclear
planning.
   Burgess and Maclean fled to Moscow in 1951 when tipped by Philby
that they were about to be arrested. Burgess died in Moscow in 1963
at age 52. Maclean died there in 1983 at age 69.
   Veteran defense correspondent Chapman Pincher and former MI5
officer Peter Wright, whose book ``Spycatcher'' the British
government failed to suppress after lengthy court battles, have both
alleged that the late Sir Roger Hollis was almost certainly a Soviet
spy. Hollis was head of MI5 from 1956 to 1965.
   But Prime Minister Mrs. Thatcher told Parliament in 1981
following publication of Pincher's book ``Their Trade is Treachery''
that investigators probing allegations against Hollis had found no
evidence incriminating him. They therefore concluded he was not been
a Soviet agent, she said.

<TEXT>
   Commercial banks could be headed toward a
record one-year gain in earnings with the government reporting their
highest six-month earnings ever and $7 billion in profits in the
second quarter of 1989.
   ``I think the industry has a chance to beat last year's all-time
record earnings,'' Chairman L. William Seidman of the Federal
Deposit Insurance Corp. said Wednesday as the agency posted the
April-June earnings report.
   But Seidman cautioned that the year's earnings figures could be
dampened by troubles involving Third World debt, real estate loans
and the state of the economy.
   Commercial banks recorded profits of $25.1 billion in 1988.
   The FDIC, which insures bank deposits, said profits at the 12,944
commercial banks in the second quarter were down from the record
$7.3 billion in the January-March period. But, both quarters
combined totaled $14.3 billion, topping all previous six-month
records.
   Banks increased their real estate lending by 12.8 percent while
boosting commercial lending by only 2.2 percent, the FDIC report
said.
   Second quarter profits rose in 39 states, the District of
Columbia and Puerto Rico, but fell in 11 states, according to John
J. Quinn III, FDIC senior banking analyst.
   Among those states reporting falling profits were Connecticut,
Massachusetts, New York and Rhode Island.
   ``Overall, we're seeing a shift of problems from the Southwest to
the Northeast, but the Northeast has nowhere near the kind of
problems the Southwest has experienced in recent years'' following
the decline in oil prices, Seidman said at a briefing.
   The FDIC report said the ``increase in non-performing assets in
the Eastern regions has come from troubled loans to developing
countries and real estate.''
   The report added, ``recent trends in Southwest bank performance
suggest that the prolonged deterioration of that region's banking
sector may have finally ended.''
   But, it pointed out, ``Southwest banks still have the highest
percentage of non-performing assets, more than twice the national
average, as well as the highest percentage of banks on the FDIC's
`Problem List.'''
   And despite the profits, banks continued to fail at a high rate.
The FDIC said 101 banks have failed or required government
assistance this year, the same number as in the first half of 1988.
For all of last year, a post-Depression record of 221 failed.
   The FDIC said the 12,944 banks operating at the end of June was a
record low since the agency was created in 1934. In addition to the
bank failures, it attributed the low number to fewer new banks and
the conversion of multibank holding company subsidiaries into
branches.
   But it said the number of ``problem banks'' has slipped to 1,356,
the lowest level in four years and down from 1,455 a year ago.

   In a venture that's part history
and part high technology, scientists are scanning the bottom of Lake
Champlain for the last missing boat of Benedict Arnold's sunken
fleet.
   In the cabin, skipper Dick Furbush and a crew of
sailor-scientists are keeping track of two sonars _ one to show the
depth of the water below, the other a state-of-the art side-scanner
that looks for underwater objects.
   On the deck of the University of Vermont research vessel,
historian Art Cohn from the Lake Champlain Maritime Museum regales
listeners with tales of Arnold's exploits on the lake during the
Revolutionary War.
   That was before frustration with a stalled career and financial
woes drove Arnold to treason. His plot to betray the rebels' post at
West Point, N.Y., was discovered and foiled, but he escaped and
joined the British.
   ``From 1775 to 1777, Benedict Arnold was one of the best field
commanders the Americans had,'' Cohn said. ``That story is
frequently forgotten because of his later treason.''
   While it isn't the only purpose of the two-week lake exploration,
most of those aboard the Melosira are hoping for a prize find: the
Providence. It is the last unaccounted for vessel of five that
Arnold ordered burned in Ferris Bay _ now called Arnold's Bay _ to
prevent their capture by the British.
   The torpedo-shaped side-scan sonar searches a 600-foot-wide swath
of lake bed by bouncing sound waves off of the bottom and whatever
may lie on it. Electrical impulses carry the findings through
hundreds of feet of cable back to the cabin of the Melosira, where
marine scientist Story Fish interprets spots and squiggles that
appear on a roll of special graph paper.
   If the Providence were to appear, ``it would be about that big,''
Fish said, plopping the plastic cap of a ballpoint pen on the paper.
   Divers and sonar have been used with increasing frequency in the
lake in recent years in an attempt to piece together details on the
crucial role Lake Champlain played as a naval theater in the
Revolutionary War.
   The goal, Cohn said, is not to bring historic ships up, but to
examine them as closely as possible and leave them in the cold,
fresh water that has preserved them for more than 200 years.
   ``It's a good, stable environment,'' Cohn said. ``You bring them
up, and they start to deteriorate. If we leave them there, future
generations will have the same opportunity to study them, but with
better technology.''
   Lake Champlain, the nation's sixth largest body of fresh water,
has what is widely regarded as ``the best collection of historic
shipwrecks in the United States,'' he said.
   The one exception to the leave-it-on-the-bottom rule was another
of the ships in Arnold's original fleet, the Philadelphia, which was
raised in 1935 and is now on display at the Smithsonian Institution
in Washington. The Lake Champlain Maritime Museum, in the Vermont
village of Basin Harbor, is working on an exact replica of the
54-foot, 29-ton Philadelphia.
   Cohn said the aim of the research is to learn more about the
motives and methods of the British and Americans as they prepared
for and then met in the battle of Valcour Island on Oct. 11-13, 1776.
   The Americans had held Fort Ticonderoga at the southern end of
the lake since it was taken by Arnold, Ethan Allen and the Green
Mountain Boys in May, 1775, just three weeks after the war began
with battles at Lexington and Concord.
   The British had amassed a large and powerful fleet on the
northern end of the lake at St. Johns, Quebec.
   When the forces met near Valcour Island, the British easily
outgunned the smaller Revolutionary navy on Oct. 11 and were ready
to finish it off the next day. One of the ships sunk on that first
day of battle was the Providence.
   In a move still admired for its daring, Arnold led his tattered
fleet single-file through the British blockade under cover of
darkness. The British were left to chase the Americans against the
wind the next day.
   Arnold knew he was defeated, so he destroyed most of what
remained of his own fleet.
   He and his troops fled overland to Ticonderoga, N.Y., and the
battle-weary British returned to Canada for the winter.
   The delay gave the Americans a chance to prepare for a series of
engagements that ended with the British defeat at the pivotal battle
at Saratoga, N.Y., on Oct. 17, 1777.

<HEAD>Bush Wins Veto Fight Over Japanese Jet Fighter Deal</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Bush administration's agreement to share
U.S. technology with Japan for a new $6 billion jet fighter will go
forward after the Senate's failure by one vote to restrict the deal.
   ``The Congress has lost this struggle; the president has
prevailed,'' said Sen. Alan Dixon, D-Ill., after the Senate on
Wednesday sustained President's Bush's veto of legislation aimed at
short-circuiting the technology transfer. The 64-34 roll call vote
fell one short of the two-thirds majority required to override a
veto.
   White House spokesman Roman Popadiuk said Bush was ``very
pleased'' at the result, which came after the White House and some
lawmakers accused the legislation's supporters of trying to
monopolize power over trade regulation.
   Dixon and other senators opposed to the FSX fighter deal vowed to
oppose similar agreements with other nations, including one now
under consideration between the United States and South Korea.
   ``I think the administration will come to regret what has
occurred here,'' Dixon said. ``This is a very unsound, unfavorable
agreement for us.''
   The vote means the $6 billion co-development, co-production
agreement with Japan will go forward with the aim of producing an
advanced, high technology Japanese fighter by the end of the 1990's.
   Rep. Terry L. Bruce, D-Ill., one of the leading opponents of the
FSX deal in the House, said the Senate ``gave away the technology in
the one industry where we have worldwide preeminence.''
   ``I hope the president can negotiate a better agreement with
South Korea,'' Bruce said. ``It would be tragic to give away the
technology a second time.''
   The agreement calls for development by General Dynamics and
Mitsubishi Heavy Industries of an advanced version of the F-16
fighter, named FSX.
   The Senate legislation would have barred Japan from transferring
U.S. aerospace technology to third parties or to its own civilian
aerospace industry.
   Administration supporters said those concerns already had been
satisfied.
   In vetoing the FSX resolution on July 31, Bush tried to shift the
debate to constitutional grounds, a theme adopted by senators on
both sides of the issue.
   ``I cannot accept binding provisions ... that would tie my hands
in the exercise of my constitutional responsibilities'' (to conduct
foreign policy), he said.
   Bush said the legislation would inject the General Accounting
Office, an agency of the legislative branch, into the administration
of the jet program ``in a highly intrusive manner, trespassing on
the constitutional powers of the president.''
   And he said it would require the reopening of negotiations,
``damage the prospects for a successful agreement,'' and damage the
U.S.-Japanese security relationship.
   Speaking immediately before the vote, Senate Republican Leader
Bob Dole of Kansas urged colleagues to forego ``meddling'' and
``micromanagement.''
   But senators seeking to overturn _ including a number of
Republicans _ said the veto represented a direct threat to the power
specifically granted Congress by the Constitution to regulate trade.
   ``If we agree (with the veto) then there has been a very
substantial rollback in the authority of the Congress of the United
States on issues related to international trade,'' said Sen. John C.
Danforth, R-Mo.
   ``This is trying to muscle the other fellow off the beach.''

<DATELINE>VALDEZ, Alaska (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Workers finished scrubbing the last
stretches of Prince William Sound shoreline that Exxon plans to
clean this year as Valdez prepares for a raucous weekend to mark the
summer cleanup's end.
   The party comes even though the cleanup from the nation's worst
oil spill remains uncompleted.
   Major tasks for today and Friday included treating the shoreline
with fertilizer to stimulate microorganisms into attacking the oil,
Exxon spokesman Joe Tucker said Wednesday.
   At the height of the cleanup, Exxon had about 12,000 people
working on the effort, with about a quarter on the sullied shores.
Exxon has been scaling back for two weeks with the goal of ending
the cleanup Friday.
   Friday also marks the 25-week anniversary of the wreck of the
Exxon Valdez, which dumped nearly 11 million gallons of Alaskan
crude when it struck a reef south of Valdez.
   The final 700 shoreline workers will be returned to Valdez
through Saturday, Tucker said. They will be joined by about 400
sailors and Marines who will arrive next weekend for three days of
leave in the busy oil port. An estimated 100 reporters and
photographers also have arrived.
   The expected deluge of tired workers and servicemen, combined
with plans for a huge party Sunday sponsored by Exxon's two major
cleanup contractors, has city officials worried.
   ``Our little police department will have its hands full,'' said
Gary Hennigh, acting city manager. ``We hear about the 20 to 25 kegs
that have been ordered and that it's just going to be a grand old
time.
   ``That many people, with that much free beer after being out in
the boondocks for a few months could be pretty wild and wooly.''
   Police Chief Bert Cottle said he is concerned his 14-officer
staff may be overwhelmed.
   ``They're talking anywhere from 500 to 1,000 people at that
party,'' Cottle said. ``This might be the biggest weekend we ever
had.''
   Hennigh fears the prospect of hundreds of men descending on
Valdez with fat cleanup paychecks could have another side effect.
   ``I suppose if there are any entrepreneurial, unemployed hookers
up in Anchorage and they knew that there was going to be such a
massive onslaught of men with money in their pockets, they might
show up in Valdez,'' he said.
   The streets of Valdez were relatively quiet Wednesday as
residents enjoyed the first sunshine in several days. Clouds as
large as the mountains that tower over Prince William Sound hovered
near town, however, warning of the end of summer.
   Exxon decided to end the cleanup in mid-September because of the
prospect of increasingly severe weather. State officials have
criticized the pullout, arguing that the weather may allow efforts
to continue into November.
   Gov. Steve Cowper on Friday will announce what the state will do
this winter to monitor spill-affected areas and to protect resources
threatened with further damage, said Steve Provant of the state
Department of Environmental Conservation.
   Provant said the state does not plan to take over the cleanup on
a large scale during the winter, Provant said. ``We don't have the
resources to do it,'' he said.
   Exxon says it has done all it can to clean up more than 1,000
miles of shoreline, but state authorities say much of the job is
unfinished.
   U.S. Environmental Protection Agency Administrator William Reilly
said Sunday that the federal government will have the final say on
the adequacy of the cleanup next spring, when a new survey will be
made.
   Reilly defended Exxon's withdrawal of workers this week, saying,
``My sense is that the weather is such there that it would be very
risky to leave a lot of those folks in that exposed position.''

<HEAD>Government Says Rural Population Growing</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Farm Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Government population figures show rural
America continues to gain people, but some experts say new urban
maps in 1990 may show a different picture.
   About 64.8 million people, or 25 percent of the U.S. population
lived in rural areas in 1988, an increase of more than 900,000 from
1987, the government reported.
   The total included approximately 4.95 million living on farms, or
2 percent of the population. That marked a decrease of 35,000 from
the previous year.
   The report issued Wednesday was prepared by the Agriculture and
Commerce departments using estimates from the Census Bureau's
monthly current population survey.
   Since 1986, when a new census procedure began, the rural
population has grown more rapidly than the urban population,
averaging 2.64 percent, compared with 1.67 percent for urban
residents.
   ``The 1988 farm population estimate of 4,951,000 is not
significantly different from the 1987 estimate, which may reflect a
leveling off in the long-term decline in the number of farm
residents,'' the report said.
   But the report added, ``more than one year of data showing
stability would be needed to confirm this pattern.'' Between 1983
and 1984 the decline in farm population also appeared to halt but
was then followed by a resumption of loss.
   The U.S. farm population peaked in 1916 when it was about 32.5
million. It has generally declined ever since.
   One of the report's authors, Judith Kalbacher of the USDA's
Economic Research Service, said the rural figures overall have shown
significant changes but cautioned the growth pattern since 1986 may
be illusory.
   ``When the urban areas are redefined after the 1990 census, some
of these growing rural areas will be reclassified as urban,'' she
said in a telephone interview. ``Some of the growing areas are going
to be taken out of rural groups, and that will make it look like
there was less rural growth'' than is now being reported.
   In the report, rural areas include open countryside and places of
fewer than 2,500 people that are not in the suburbs of large cities.
The large cities and their suburbs, plus places of 2,500 or more,
are considered urban.
   The farm population consists of people living on farms in rural
areas, but it does not include the relatively few who live on farms
located in urban areas, the report said. A farm is defined as a
place that sold agricultural products worth $1,000 or more during
the previous year.
   Kalbacher said urban sprawl and a willingness of city workers to
commute greater distances have been important factors in the growth.
Families moving to distant suburbs, for example, have helped boost
the annual readings for rural areas.
   ``It probably means that a lot of the rural growth that we're
seeing in the mid-decade (of the 1980s) is mostly fringe development
around urbanized areas,'' she said.
   The report said the largest share of the rural population, 44
percent, is in the South, ``which has been the case since the first
census was taken in 1790.'' Little change in the regional
distribution of rural people has occurred in the last 40 years.
   However, the farm population has shown ``marked change'' over the
same period. In 1950, for example, the South accounted for 51.6
percent of the farm people, but only 29.6 percent in 1988. The
Midwest, meanwhile, accounted for 50.6 percent last year, compared
with 32.3 percent in 1950.
   Other observations in the report included:
   _Farm residents are older, with a median age of 38 years in 1988,
compared with 32.2 years for all non-farm people. In 1920, the
median age of farm people was less than 21 years. Non-farm refers to
urban plus rural non-farm people.
   _Last year 97.1 percent of farm residents were white, and 2.2
percent were black, compared with 84.2 percent white and 12.4
percent black in the non-farm population. The rest were described as
``other'' races.
   _About 69 percent of the farm residents 15 years and older were
married and living with a spouse in 1988, compared with 56 percent
of the non-farm people.
   Farm women also had lower proportions of being single, widowed,
married with spouse absent, and divorced.
   ``This probably reflects a tendency toward increased outmigration
of young farm women as they reach maturity, and outmigration or
cessation of farming activities for older women upon loss of their
husbands,'' the report said.
   The fertility rates of farm women of childbearing age were a
little higher than non-farm women. Data for June 1988 showed the
number of children who had been born to farm women 18 to 44 years
averaged 1,533 per 1,000 women. Non-farm women averaged 1,337
children per 1,000.

<HEAD>Former HUD Secretary Was More Engaged Than He Let On</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   When Sam Pierce told Congress in May he was not
a ``hands on'' manager at the Department of Housing and Urban
Development, lawmakers probing scandals at the agency responded with
dismay but not disbelief.
   After all, Pierce's account fit with the public image of the only
Cabinet member to serve the entire Reagan presidency. At HUD,
``Silent Sam'' was known as a man who arrived late and left early,
traveled often, knew little about HUD programs and sometimes had the
office television tuned to soap operas.
   Then Shirley Wiseman, a former top HUD official, opened the
floodgates.
   Pierce, she said in later testimony, personally ordered her to
approve funding for a North Carolina project that had been opposed
by several HUD officials.
   The project, it turned out, was backed by a former Pierce law
partner. Suddenly, Pierce's image changed to that of a man who had
been more involved in HUD decisions than he let on.
   Wiseman's testimony brought intense congressional and media
scrutiny of Pierce's role at HUD, and led to report after report of
his intervention on behalf of prominent Republicans _ James Watt,
Carla Hills, and former Sen. Edward Brooke among them. Jazz musician
Lionel Hampton and a prominent black GOP couple also got help from
the secretary, as did attorneys at his former law firm, HUD records
show.
   Pierce returns as a witness on Friday before the House
subcommittee that originally questioned him, to tell his own story
and field questions about the apparent contradiction between what he
said and what Wiseman and others have said since.
   ``I believe that the vast majority of HUD's employees served me
well,'' Pierce told Time magazine in an interview published this
week. ``But there were rotten apples in and out of the HUD barrel.''
   Unlike the first appearance, this time Pierce will be accompanied
by an attorney.
   ``I'm not going to prejudge him,'' said subcommittee member
Barney Frank, D-Mass., who had a heated exchange with Pierce during
his May testimony.
   ``He's entitled to his say and he's shown that he's willing to
testify,'' Frank said Wednesday. ``Obviously there are some
contradictions that need to be explained.''
   In two recent interviews, Pierce has contended that his earlier
testimony was misunderstood, and that by saying he was not a ``hands
on'' manager he did not mean he never took a personal interest in
HUD projects or proposals. But he insists that politics played no
role in his decisions.
   ``No request was to be given any special advantage because it was
submitted by a Republican or was in some way associated with a
Republican,'' he told Time. ``My decisions were based on fact, law
and logic, not on political party.''
   HUD Secretary Jack Kemp has laid blame for the agency's problems
on Pierce, saying it is obvious that the secretary did not keep tabs
on the department. The Bush administration has tried to distance
itself from the agency's problems with promises to flush politics
out of its decisions.
   Several friends and associates say Pierce faces an unfair end to
a public career that includes appointments to judgeships in his
native New York and jobs in the Eisenhower and Nixon administrations.
   His associates say the 67-year-old Pierce left himself open to
his current problems because of his habit of delegating authority to
others.
   ``If he's not interested in something, he didn't want to be
bothered,'' said Roy Englert, a Washington attorney who served under
Pierce at the Treasury Department in the 1970s.
   Pierce has said his former top aide, Deborah Gore Dean, and
others violated his trust. Congressional testimony and HUD records
show that Dean was often contacted by developers seeking money and
wielded considerable influence over which projects received approval.
   Ms. Dean, through her attorneys, counters that whatever actions
she took were done at Pierce's request.

<HEAD>Harvard Professor Says Neanderthal Man Could Talk</HEAD>

<DATELINE>CAMBRIDGE, Mass. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Forget notions of Neanderthal man as a
giant hairy brute who stumbled about, managing utterances no more
sophisticated than an occasional ``ugh'' or ``duh.''
   Neanderthal man could talk, researchers say. He couldn't
pronounce the letters ``e'' or ``i,'' and he probably sounded a bit
nasal and hard to understand, but he could communicate.
   Neanderthals even may have spun yarns, whispered gossip, and told
a few one-liners, says Terrence Deacon, assistant professor of
anthropology at Harvard University.
   What's more, they may have talked with early humans, and if they
did, remnants of Neanderthal language could be found in modern
speech, says Deacon.
   About 50,000 years ago, Neanderthals living in Europe and Israel
were invaded by a race of smaller folk _ modern humans _ who had
migrated from Africa. For thousands of years the two cultures
mingled, and quite possibly communicated, before Neanderthals died
out 35,000 years ago, Deacon said.
   Neanderthals ``had every bit of the intellectual and linguistic
capability'' that our direct ancestors did, Deacon said Wednesday.
``They could have conversed with modern humans.''
   Deacon bases this contention on his studies of monkey and human
brains. His research showed that an area called the ventral
prefontal cortex, which grew dramatically in modern human brains,
serves as a link between speech centers controlling so-called
automatic vocalizations _ laughter and crying _ and those areas
controlling more sophisticated speech.
   The development of this large cortex distinguished humans from
primates, which use automatic vocalizations like shrieks and hoots
to communicate. Since Neanderthal brains also had a large ventral
prefrontal cortex, it is reasonable to assume they could talk,
Deacon said.
   Neanderthal man was a big guy, to be sure. He had larger bones
and muscles, a sloping forehead and more menacing jaws and teeth
than today's average human, but his brain was much like ours. There
is no reason he wouldn't have the gift of gab, Deacon said.
   He couldn't utter some of the vowels we do, though, because his
larynx was higher in his throat than ours. So he couldn't ``ooh'' if
he spied a beautiful full moon, for example.
   Philip Lieberman, professor of cognitive and linguistic sciences
at Brown University, agreed with some of Deacon's argument.
   But Lieberman said that while he'd ``be astonished if they didn't
talk ... whether they spoke anything like humans is an unsettled
issue.
   ``The difference in the vocal tract means the Neanderthal
couldn't close his nose off,'' Lieberman said, noting this would
make Neanderthal speech very nasal, which added errors to any
language.
   Lieberman added that Neanderthal speech also would be hampered by
not being able to say ``e'' or ``i,'' the most common sounds found
in modern languages.
   Deacon said much of what an anthropologist believes about
Neanderthal man's capacities depend upon what is considered crucial
to speech.
   ``It all comes down to what you think is more important for
speech _ the brain or the larynx,'' Deacon said. ``I believe it is
the brain.''
   Deacon's argument may have gained strength recently with the
discovery of a human-like hyoid bone, from which the larynx is
suspended, in the 60,000-year-old skeleton of a Neanderthal on Mount
Carmel in Israel.
   If Neanderthals and modern humans talked, there also may be some
aspects of Neanderthal speech left in modern languages, Deacon said.
   ``It's an open question, but it's not impossible that our
language was affected,'' Deacon said.
   So what did Neanderthals talk about? They were hunters and
gatherers, much like the Bushmen of the Kalahari Desert in Africa,
so they probably talked about the animals they hunted and the
berries they gathered for food.
   But not all Neanderthal communication was shop talk.
   ``They didn't just talk about their jobs,'' Deacon said. ``I
think they could have told jokes. And there were issues of family,
shelter, disease and aging that they might have discussed. And of
course, there was the play of children.
   ``It's a disservice to the complexity of their society to think
of Neanderthals as dumb brutes,'' Deacon said.
   Perhaps they joked about the puny Homo sapiens who invaded their
turf.
   Say, did you hear the one about the human who thought
Neanderthals were dumb?

   The chairman of the Senate committee hearing
evidence in the impeachment case against U.S. District Judge Walter
Nixon says he expects the trial before the full Senate to begin next
month.
   ``The parties should be prepared to proceed by Oct. 17,'' Sen.
Wyche Fowler, D-Ga., said Wednesday.
   During four days of testimony from five witnesses, the committee
heard evidence concerning allegations that Nixon lied about his
involvement in a marijuana smuggling case against the son of a
wealthy oil man with business connections to the judge.
   Nixon, 60, the chief federal judge in Mississippi's southern
district, is serving a five-year prison sentence after being
convicted of perjury in a federal trial in 1988.
   He'll lose his judgeship and its $89,500 annual salary if the
Senate reaches the same conclusions as the trial jury.
   The House, which acts as prosecutor in impeachment cases,
contends Nixon lied when he told federal investigators he had never
discussed the drug case with anyone or influenced its outcome.
   The Senate committee will prepare a report of the undisputed
facts of Nixon's case and a summary of the disputed facts with
evidence from both sides, but will not make a recommendation on
whether Nixon should be impeached.
   All senators will get copies of the documents, a transcript of
the hearings and the evidence presented at the hearings before they
hear final statements from both sides of the case in public session.
They will then lock themselves in a closed session, similar to jury
deliberations, to debate the case.
   The vote on three articles of impeachment, which were approved
unanimously by the House, will take place in public session.
   In his closing statement Wednesday, Nixon's lawyer said the judge
had no reason to lie because there was nothing improper about his
only contact with the narcotics case in question.
   But Rep. James Sensenbrenner, R-Wis., in closing arguments for
the House, said Nixon ``fixed'' the narcotics case for Drew
Fairchild because he had made a lucrative investment in oil
properties with his father, Wiley Fairchild, and wanted more.
   ``Obviously, there are two versions of the events here,'' said
Sensenbrenner. ``Judge Nixon's version ... is certainly more benign
than the collective picture painted by the other witnesses.''
   The articles of impeachment allege:
   _Nixon lied when he told a grand jury he never discussed the case
against Drew Fairchild with Holmes.
   _Nixon lied when he told a grand jury he had nothing to do
officially or unofficially with the Fairchild case and never
influenced anyone in the case.
   _Nixon undermined ``the integrity of the judiciary'' and
disobeyed the law by making 14 false or misleading statements during
an interview with the federal investigators and in his sworn grand
jury testimony.

<TEXT>
   Animal welfare activists are opposing attempts
to train Capuchin monkeys to provide small tasks and companionship
to quadriplegics because they say the animals are subjected to cruel
government treatment and never become fully tame.
   ``It simply is not possible to use monkeys in this type of
program and still be humane,'' the Committee for Humane Legislation,
an umbrella group for several animal welfare groups, told a House
panel Wednesday.
   The testimony came before the Veterans Affairs subcommittee on
hospitals and health care, which is considering legislation
introduced by Rep. Joseph P. Kennedy, D-Mass., that would set up a
program providing helper monkeys for 20 disabled veterans and helper
dogs for 10.
   Although veterans' groups are pushing the idea, the animal rights
activists said attempts to domesticate the monkeys are misguided.
   ``Monkeys are wild animals and no amount of training will ever
change that,'' said Leslie Fain of the Committee for Humane
Legislation.
   According to the activists, monkeys trained as helpers have their
teeth removed and are subjected to electric shock that causes them
to have diarrhea. Fain said the monkeys' natural curiosity could
cause them to harm people they are supposed to help.
   ``Quadriplegics have lost caretakers who quit because of monkey
attacks ...,'' she said. ``Driving controls on the quadriplegics'
wheelchairs have been used in some cases by monkeys to drive their
owners into walls.''
   The humane group and the American Society for the Prevention of
Cruelty to Animals say other, mechanical devices can be used.
   But the Paralyzed Veterans of America, one of the groups favoring
the legislation, disputes such claims.
   ``At the present time there is no effective technology which can
imitate the simple, routine tasks which humans perform,'' said John
C. Bollinger, associate legislative director of the paralyzed
veterans group.
   Dr. Mary Joan Willard, professor of medicine at the Boston
University School of Medicine and director of the non-profit Helping
Hands group, said the use of the simians saves $3,777 a year by
reducing _ never eliminating _ the need for a human attendant.
   She said the monkeys can be trained and that after several months
they treat the owner, attendant and family as part of a ``troop.''
   Tooth extraction is necessary to control biting, she said, and
this is done ``without any deleterious effects on their health or
subsequent behavior.'' It has been done for years with organ-grinder
monkeys, she said.
   About 220,000 people in the United States have spinal cord
injuries, and about half of those are quadriplegics. About 28,000
veterans are quadriplegic, according to VA.

<HEAD>Officials Hear Ways of Making Life Tough for Vandals</HEAD>

   The battle against graffiti can be won with a
little sweetness, a master cleaner says.
   Walls can be protected from spray-can scrawls with a simple sugar
solution, said Glyn Howard, head of a British cleaning company.
   ``After that, the efforts of any graffiti artist can be hosed off
in a moment with hot water,'' he told officials Wednesday at a
conference on battling vandalism.
   Among his clients are 15 train stations of state-run British Rail
whose woes are only the tip of a titanic vandalism problem across
Britain.
   ``It is hundreds of millions of pounds a year,'' police chief
Philip Veater told the conference organized by a construction
industry group called the Building Center.
   ``We put questions to 12,000 households for a crime survey and
discovered that crimes were five times more numerous than had been
reported, while vandalism was 12 times greater than we thought.''
   ``People don't report all crimes to the police, but they hardly
ever report vandalism because they think nothing can or will be done
about it,'' said Veater, deputy director of a government crime
prevention center.
   For his part, Howard showed one way of fighting back. He
demonstrated his secret to architects and city hall officials by
having one of his workers hose away red and black paint from a
treated wall.
   The paint peeled away under the jet of water.
   Howard said he is the first person in Britain to employ the
patented solution invented by a Swedish scientist, Professor Sigfrid
Svensson of Lund University.
   The carbohydrate derivative, which costs roughly $8 a square
yard, is non-toxic, colorless and odorless, he said.
   ``So if you drink it by mistake, it won't poison you as it
contains carbohydrates of the type which is part of your everyday
diet, and it won't hurt your skin or give you a headache when you
put it on,'' Howard said.
   British stations and trains are regularly vandalized, mostly with
aerosol sprays.
   However, the problem extends well beyond eyesores. Last month, a
speeding express was derailed near London by a concrete tie placed
across the track, wrecking the locomotive. The 100 passengers
escaped with slight injuries.
   The London Underground spends nearly $1.5 million annually
removing graffiti.
   There are no statistics on what vandalism costs the country.
   Among Veater's suggestions to combat vandalism: use
damage-resistant materials in construction, put prickly plants at
the bottom of walls, cover walls with creepers, make sure there is
nothing around a building to climb on, and clear up damage and
graffiti quickly.
   ``The vandal wants his work to be seen,'' he said.
   Desmond Williams, an architect, said his firm designs or remodels
schools and other buildings to resist vandal attacks.
   ``We reduce entrances, shut off alcoves which can be used as
hiding places, eliminate anything providing handholds to reach roofs
and put in lights triggered by sensors. Vandals don't like to have
their profiles shown in a bright light,'' he said.

<HEAD>Rate of 1988 Domestic Oil Discovery Called Second Lowest on Record</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT BURNS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An Energy Department report showing last year's
domestic oil discoveries were the second-smallest on record suggests
the trend toward greater U.S. reliance on imported oil is continuing.
   The report Wednesday by the department's Energy Information
Administration also said known reserves of U.S. crude, including the
newly discovered oil, fell last year for the eighth time in the last
10 years.
   The report underscored a trend of declining U.S. oil resources
that accelerated in the mid-1980s when prices dropped sharply and
oil exploration tailed off.
   The slower exploration, combined with rising energy demand, has
resulted in a rapid increase in oil imports, which in July supplied
more than half the nation's petroleum needs for the first time in
more than a decade.
   The report said drillers added 553 million barrels of oil last
year to U.S. reserves, either by discovering new fields, extending
those already in production or finding new reservoirs in existing
fields. That is a 20 percent drop from the 1987 discovery total and
is the second lowest on record, the agency said.
   Domestic proved oil reserves _ defined as crude oil that could be
pumped from known reservoirs under existing economic conditions _
totaled 26.8 billion barrels as of Dec. 31, 1988, the report said.
That is a drop of 431 million barrels, or 1.6 percent, from a year
earlier.
   A barrel equals 42 gallons.
   The reserves total has dropped in each year during the past
decade except in 1984, when a gain of 711 million barrels was
reported, and in 1987 when the total rose by 367 million barrels.
   The 1988 total oil reserves would disappear in about nine years,
at current rates of consumption, if additional oil were not found.
The Interior Department reported last month that undiscovered U.S.
oil resources totaled about 49 billion barrels, indicating a further
16 years life expectancy for oil in this country.
   Proved reserves of natural gas plunged by 10 percent last year to
168 trillion cubic feet, the report said, because of a major
revision of gas reserves for the North Slope of Alaska. The major
companies operating on the North Slope agreed that 24.6 trillion
cubic feet of gas should be removed from the reported total because
the prevailing gas prices are too low to make it marketable, the
report said.

   The White House is considering dropping its
widely criticized nomination of a former department store buyer to
head an Energy Department office responsible for monitoring safety
at nuclear weapons plants, an official said.
   Diane Kay Morales is a ``very competent, accomplished person,''
but may not be the right choice for the sensitive position of
assistant secretary for environment, safety and health, Deputy
Secretary Henson Moore said in an interview Wednesday.
   ``Diane Morales is reconsidering what she wants to do and the
White House is reconsidering what it wants her to do,'' Moore said,
adding the requirements of the job have grown as more problems have
been uncovered at the weapons plants.
   He cited as an example a new Energy Department investigative
report on the Fernald nuclear weapons plant in Ohio. A summary of
the report released Wednesday listed dozens of environmental
problems at the uranium processing plant, although it said none of
the shortcomings posed an imminent threat to the public.
   Energy Secretary James D. Watkins, in an internal memorandum
obtained Wednesday, said he was dispatching a team of environment,
safety and health experts to Fernald to beef up the staff there
until he can hire permanent additions.
   Moore said the investigation's results showed ``we have to get
this department into a serious high-gear mode of operation to come
into compliance'' with federal and state environmental and health
and safety standards.
   The department's office of environment, safety and health was
created in 1985 to monitor the nuclear weapons facilities _
including 17 major installations in 12 states _ which have fallen
into disrepair and in some cases contaminated soil and groundwater
with improperly stored hazardous wastes.
   Moore said no decision had been made on whether to resubmit the
Morales nomination to the Senate, which sent it back to the White
House in late July after putting off a hearing. The Senate Energy
and Natural Resources Committee said it wanted more information
about Watkins' plans for reorganizing the department before
considering Ms. Morales.
   ``We now realize that the demands of the job are much more severe
than we had seen previously,'' Moore said. He said there had been no
effort so far to look for another nominee.
   Moore said, however, the administration is ready to fight for the
controversial nomination of Victor Stello as assistant secretary for
defense programs, the office responsible for weapons production. The
Senate energy panel is expected to consider the Stello nomination in
October.
   Stello came under renewed fire this week from environmental
groups that claim his record at the Nuclear Regulatory Commission
shows a lack of commitment to nuclear safety.
   ``We haven't seen anything to cause us to review or reassess
this,'' Moore said. ``The choice of Victor Stello sends a signal
that for the first time in the history of these nuclear facilities
... we have chosen a regulator to lead this program rather than a
producer.''
   The Morales nomination drew fire from environmental and labor
groups soon after the White House announced it April 12. The main
objection is that Ms. Morales' previous experience lends little to
the demands of an office seeking to improve the weapons plants'
compliance with environmental, health and safety laws.
   Ms. Morales worked from 1971 to 1980 for Neiman-Marcus, the
department store chain, managing two departments and assisting in
buying for 14 stores.
   She held several government jobs from 1981 to 1986, including
membership on the Civil Aeronautics Board, and she later founded an
environmental consulting company.

   Defense Secretary Dick Cheney is attempting to
get his former colleagues on Capitol Hill to show the willpower he
admits he lacked at times as a congressman.
   ``I think it's important for people to remember that as a member
of Congress, I voted for every single defense program that was ever
put in front of me. You can't name a defense program I didn't like.
I loved them all,'' Cheney said in a speech Wednesday before a
conservative forum.
   But now, as the top man at the Pentagon, Cheney says he has a new
perspective.
   ``Now ... I've got to figure out how to pay for them,'' he said.
   In remarks before the Hudson Institute, Cheney conceded he may
have made mistakes in some of his votes on Capitol Hill and he tried
to use some introspection to convince his former colleagues that
he'd learned a lesson.
   The former Wyoming representative said that as Congress makes key
budget decisions, lawmakers must show they have the willpower to cut
entire programs in order to hold the line on the nation's defense
budget.
   Attempts to cut overall spending while leaving programs intact
with less money will not solve the budget problem, Cheney said.
   In presenting President Bush's fiscal 1990 budget to Capitol
Hill, Cheney recommended killing the V-22 Osprey, a vertical
take-off plane, and canceling the F-14D jet fighter. He called the
requests ``a whole new concept in this town.''
   The House voted to restore funds to both programs and the Senate
has authorized research and development funds for the Osprey.
   The secretary said congressmen ``love to vote to reduce the top
line, to cut back on the overall amount on spending'' to solve
budget problems.
   ``Then it's my task to keep all the programs alive and the bases
open, because they don't want to cancel anything,'' he said.
   Cheney said members of Congress who have voted against defense
programs for the past decade are ``now coming down to my office ...
saying I hope you won't cut out my base or shut down my production
line.''
   But the former congressman admitted he'd done the same thing.
   ``I will not argue here today, that I was above, on occasion,
trying to have it both ways on an issue. That's a normal human
desire,'' Cheney said. ``But these decisions are far too important
for us to allow that to happen this time around. Congress must make
some choices.''
   He praised the Senate for coming closer to the administration's
wish-list in its work on the Pentagon's budget, although he
criticized the Senate Appropriation defense subcommittee for voting
Tuesday to slash funding for the Trident 2, the Navy's newest and
most supposedly most deadly weapon.

   The number of major oil spills this year
is not unusual despite the Exxon Valdez grounding and four other
tanker accidents during the first six months of 1989, according to
an industry watchdog study.
   There have been 79 tanker spills of more than 10,000 gallons of
oil in United States waters since 1978, an average of more than six
each year, according to Richard Golob, publisher of Golob's Oil
Pollution Bulletin.
   Seven of the spills involved more than 1 million gallons, Golob
said.
   Between 1978 and 1988, the volume of oil spilled each year ranged
from 92,000 gallons in 1983 to 10 million gallons in 1979.
   And during the first six months of 1989, more than 11.7 million
gallons spilled, including about 10.9 million alone from the Exxon
Valdez, Golob said.
   ``Even though the Exxon Valdez has received so much publicity,
and even though we had a record three major spills in one 12-hour
period in June which once again reinforced the perception that major
oil spills take place frequently, the statistics still show that
major spills are still low probabilty events,'' Golob said Wednesday.
   The study also reports that more oil was spilled during the first
six months of 1989 than in any of the last 10 years, he said.
   Since 1978, the Gulf Coast suffered 37 tanker spills, the
Atlantic Coast 29 and the Pacific Coast 13.
   Two major tanker spills occurred during the weekend of June 23,
one at the mouth of Narragansett Bay off Rhode Island, the other on
the Delaware River near Claymont, Del.
   A third major spill occured that weekend in the Houston Ship
Channel near Galveston but was not included in Golob's statistics
because a barge leaked, not a tanker.
   A separate study by the Center for Study of Responsive Law, a
public interest group, published Wednesday in USA Today said that 68
percent of all spills were caused by mechanical failure, 20 percent
were caused by human error, 4 percent by weather, and less than 1
percent by vandalism. The center's study excludes 1989.

   El Salvador's Marxist rebels say they would
lay down their arms and reorganize as a political party if the
nation's rightist administration would agree to broad political and
social reforms.
   The guerrillas made the proposal Wednesday in their first talks
with the government in two years.
   Both sides said they hoped to reach an agreement today on a plan
for negotiating an end to nearly a decade of civil war that has
claimed 70,000 lives.
   ``The problem is if we're just going to talk or if we're going to
talk about negotiating,'' rebel commander Joaquin Villalobos said
Wednesday night.
   He said the Salvadoran people are tired of fighting: ``We are
conscious the war has to end.''
   The U.S.-backed Salvadoran government did not present a peace
plan, but the five-man delegation arrived with a proposal for
negotiating procedures that called for two days of talks every two
months.
   Rebels leaders called that unacceptable and said they wanted a
faster-paced negotiating plan.
   There were also differences on whether there would be a mediator
or observers and who might play that role.
   Despite the differences, both sides said the first day had been
fruitful and that an accord on a negotiating plan was possible.
   ``We feel satisfied,'' Justice Minister Oscar Alfredo Santamaria
told reporters.
   He refused to comment on the rebel peace plan. ``It is a proposal
that needs analyzing,'' he said.
   The meeting is the first between the rebels and the elected
Republican Nationalist Alliance government of President Alfredo
Cristiani, who took office June 1.
   Santamaria said the fact that Cristiani had agreed to these
preliminary talks with the rebel Farabundo Marti National Liberation
Front was proof it is serious about peace.
   ``We are here to put an end to the war,'' he said.
   The rebels' peace proposal calls for a cease-fire by Nov. 15 in
exchange for broad including appointing a new Supreme Court and
justice minister and moving up legislative and municipal elections
now scheduled for 1991.
   The guerrillas also said a truce was conditional on reforms in
the military, expanded land reform and the prosecution of death
squad members.
   The founder of Cristiani's party, Roberto D'Aubuisson, has long
been accused of playing a key role in rightist death squads that
have murdered thousands of leftists, suspected leftists and other
government opponents.
   If its conditions were met, the rebel group said, it would move
toward becoming a political party.
   Under the final stage of their proposal, the guerrillas call for
constitutional and electoral reforms and agreement by the United
States to replace military aid to the Salvadoran government with
economic aid.
   El Salvador is the largest recipient of U.S. aid in the
hemisphere.
   The rebel plan contains many proposals made and rejected before,
but the wording was much milder this time and the rebels have
dropped a longstanding insistence on merging their army with the
goverment armed forces.
   Their offer to change from a guerrilla force to a political party
is also new. The rebels have boycotted regular elections since 1982,
saying the balloting offered only a veneer of democracy.
   The government has said it will not negotiate a reduction in the
military and that if the rebels want reform they should pursue it
through the political process.
   Rebel and government called a temporary cease-fire for the
two-day peace talks. Negotiations in 1984 and 1987 failed.

<HEAD>House Rejects Ban on Subsidies to Sexually Explicit Art</HEAD>

<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   House Democrats, saying they ``respect freedom
of expression,'' aren't going along with Sen. Jesse Helms' effort to
bar federal subsidies for sexually explicit or blasphemous art _ but
the fight is far from over.
   The House voted 264-153 Wednesday to reject Helms' proposed
restrictions on the National Endowment for the Arts.
   ``We're telling Jesse we respect freedom of expression,'' Rep.
Don Edwards, D-Calif., said afterward.
   However, the chief House supporter of Helms' measure predicts at
least one more vote on the highly charged battle over the
endowment's awarding of $45,000 this year to help finance two
controversial exhibits.
   ``The debate now shifts to the hinterland,'' said freshman Rep.
Dana Rohrabacher, R-Calif. ``I believe Sen. Helms has a few rabbits
up his sleeve.''
   For two months, a coalition of Christian, conservative and
Republican groups have campaigned for Helms' amendment to the Senate
version of a 1990 appropriations bill for the endowment, the
Interior Department and several other agencies.
   Organizations supporting the arts also mobilized a campaign
casting the issue as a battle over artistic freedom.
   Helms' measure would ban federal subsidies of ``obscene or
indecent material, including ... depictions of sadomasochism,
homoeroticism, the exploitation of children or individuals engaged
in sex acts.''
   It also would prohibit taxpayer funding of art that ``denigrates
the objects or beliefs of ... a particular religion or non-religion
or ... a person, group or class of citizens on the basis of race,
creed, sex, handicap or national origin.''
   Rep. Sidney Yates, D-Ill., the endowment's chief supporter in the
House, said it erred in awarding grants for the two exhibits _ one
including a photograph by Andre Serrano of a picture of Christ on a
cross submerged in a jar of urine, and the other a show by the late
photographer Robert Mapplethorpe that included explicit photos of
homosexual acts and a nude boy.
   But Yates said two mistakes out of some 4,000 annual grants do
not warrant imposing a ``lingering death'' on an agency whose
subsidies are used to foster cultural enrichment across the country.
   Yates said Helms' measure ``establishes a broad and sweeping
pattern of censorship. This is the start of George Orwell's big
brother; it's the communist approach to art.''
   The endowment's critics questioned whether the government should
be using tax dollars at all to subsidize art.
   ``The question is sponsorship, not censorship,`` said
Rohrabacher. ``Artists can do whatever they want on their own time
and with their own dime.''
   Democrats united behind Yates, rejecting Helms' measure by a
margin of 212-38. House Republicans, whose campaign committee
already has used the issue against selected incumbent Democrats,
supported the ban by 116-52.
   Before the vote, Democratic leaders thwarted an attempt to
display on the House floor copies of the offending photographs. Rep.
George Brown, D-Calif., who was presiding over the House at the
time, denied the request by assistant GOP Whip Robert Walker of
Pennsylvania, saying the exhibit would upset the decorum of the
House.
   The Corcoran Gallery of Art in Washington, fearing a cut in its
funds from the endowment, in June canceled a planned show of
Mapplethorpe's photos.
   The second-ranking officer of the Corcoran and the organizer of
the Mapplethorpe show, Jane Livingston, resigned Wednesday, saying
she planned to complete a book. She said that though she was
``appalled'' at the cancellation, done without consulting her, her
resignation ``very well may have happened now without any of the
other events.''
   Yates, who chairs the House subcommittee responsible for the
endowment's annual funding, tried to halt the arts funding
controversy two months ago by cutting its $171.4 million budget for
next year by $45,000 _ the amount of federal grants that went toward
the Mapplethorpe and Serrano exhibits.

<HEAD>Doctors Say Emergency Rooms Being Stretched Thin</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Getting emergency room treatment in some
hospitals can be as stressful these days as the emergency itself,
say physicians who warn another health-care crisis is looming.
   In some cities, ambulances roam the streets trying to find an
emergency room that has space and patients can wait hours, even
days, in the emergency department for a hospital bed to become
available.
   ``This is the future health care crisis,'' said Dr. Charlotte S.
Yeh, a board member of the American College of Emergency Physicians
and chief of emergency medicine at the Newton-Wellesley Hospital in
Newton, Mass.
   ``We are the safety net,'' she said. ``When you're sick and don't
have anywhere to go and you're scared and don't know what you've
got, our doors are open 24 hours a day, seven days a week. But we're
becoming overloaded.''
   ``The net is being stretched so thin we're worried about the
future of the health care system,'' she said.
   Emergency physicians described the problems Wednesday as they
released a draft report based on a survey of the college's state
chapters.
   The pressure on hospital emergency rooms is coming from the
growing AIDS epidemic, increased illegal drug use and an estimated
37 million Americans who have no health insurance and who get health
care only through emergency rooms.
   Adding to the burden are medical staff shortages, financial
pressures that are leading a growing number of hospitals to close
their doors, and an inadequate number of nursing home beds, they
said.
   Some patients in New York City emergency rooms have waited for
hospital beds for more than a week, said Dr. Stephan G. Lynn,
director of emergency medicine at St. Luke's-Roosevelt Hospital
Center in New York City.
   ``Frequently, we admit people to the hospital with a diagnosis
like heart attack and we do cardiograms and blood tests and three or
four days later they leave ... never having seen an intensive care
unit or a cardiac care unit, never having left the emergency
department,'' Lynn said.
   The Harbor UCLA Medical Center in Los Angeles emergency room is
so crowded it is closed to ambulance traffic 25 percent of the time,
said Dr. Robert Hockberger, chairman of the Department of Emergency
Medicine.
   The problem is most critical in the Northeast and on the West
Coast, but the survey found emergency rooms across the country are
backed up. Forty-one state chapters of the college reported
overcrowding in emergency rooms in their states. Nine reported no
backups: Idaho, Minnesota, Nebraska, New Hampshire, New Mexico,
North Dakota, Oregon, Utah and Wyoming.
   Chapters in West Virginia, North Carolina, Alabama and Alaska
noted ``overcrowding is not simply a problem of this nation's
cities,'' according to the draft report.
   The physicians said it is not known whether long emergency room
stays have led to more patient deaths, but they said these patients
often receive only marginal care.
   ``The lights never go out. The noise never turns off. Meals are
served, but on an irregular basis and rarely are as palatable or
warm as they are on the in-patient side,'' Lynn said.
   Patients ``spend their entire stay lying on a stretcher with a
mattress that is two inches thick.''
   ``That level of care is inadequate,'' he said. ``Emergency
departments were not designed and are not equipped or staffed to
provide intensive care services or in-patient services.''

   A survey of Social Security Administration
employees depicts a discontented and overworked work force, but the
agency's new chief says she is confident morale is improving.
   ``I am absolutely confident that the problem of low morale is one
that we're going to spend a lot of time paying some attention to and
making some changes in those numbers,'' Social Security
Administration Gwendolyn King said Wednesday.
   According to the survey conducted in April, 51 percent of Social
Security employees say their morale is poor or extremely poor, up
from 43 percent in 1987. Seventy-four percent said they were often
or very often overworked.
   The share of supervisors who said the SSA was doing a poor or
very poor job of providing the best possible service to Social
Security recipients rose to 37 percent, up from 26 percent in the
1987 poll.
   The survey, conducted by the Institute for Behavioral Research in
Creativity in Salt Lake City, Utah, was released by Mrs. King, who
took office last month.
   The April survey came toward the end of a six-year period in
which the SSA work force was slashed by 20 percent to 65,000 as part
of a campaign to modernize and streamline operations.
   ``Downsizing, the introduction of new technology and the
inevitable difficulties in managing change could be expected to lead
to a rise in employee discontent,'' the report said.
   Mrs. King said workers would be encouraged to take the time
necessary to provide quality service, more would be done to reward
good performance, and more equipment and personnel might be shifted
to areas in need.
   Among other findings in the survey:
   _68 percent of workers said there was quite a lot or some signs
of employee discontent.
   _46 percent of supervisors said they were given encouragement and
opportunities to learn and improve their job skills, up from 40
percent in 1987.
   The report's recommendations included: improved communication
with lower-level employees about the agency's long-term goals, more
discussion among employees and management, paying increased
attention to worker contributions, and providing more flexibility to
solve problems at lower management levels.

<HEAD>Film Casts Feared KGB In A New Light, But Audience Skeptical</HEAD>

   The KGB says its modern agents are well-educated
family men who spend almost as much time fighting ``scourges of
humanity'' like terrorism and drug trafficking as they do keeping
tabs on CIA agents.
   But officials deny that they routinely eavesdrop on foreigners in
Moscow or that they have done anything illegal in pursuing
dissidents since the 1960s.
   The feared Soviet secret service is trying to build a new image
of openness in keeping with President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's
reforms, and on Wednesday premiered the first Soviet documentary
film about the KGB.
   Officials fielded questions from reporters for more than an hour
afterwards, but their answers indicated glasnost only goes so far.
   The officers told the news conference that the KGB had done
nothing illegal in pursuing dissidents since the 1960s.
   The 55-minute film ``The KGB Today,'' and a short film of an
interview with KGB Chairman Gen. Vladimir A. Kryuchkov, painted a
portrait of what the secret police chief called the ``modern Cheka
man,'' a well-educated professional whose work increasingly
encompasses the struggle against smuggling, organized crime and drug
trafficking.
   Cheka was the name of the original Bolshevik secret police
organization.
   ``At present we're trying to create an objective image of our
organization in the Soviet Union and abroad,'' Kryuchkov said in the
film, which was shot by the government news agency Novosti.
   Novosti officials billed the film as the first documentary about
the KGB. They said they hoped it, and more to follow, would be seen
widely in the Soviet Union and distributed outside the country.
   Kryuchkov, who took over from Viktor M. Chebrikov as KGB chief
last year, has opened up the top-secret organization somewhat during
his almost one year as chairman. He has granted interviews to
foreign reporters and said the feared organization should be subject
to legislative oversight.
   But he was greeted with snorts of laughter when he told national
legislators at his confirmation hearing in July that the KGB does
not tap telephones of Soviet citizens.
   In the spirit of openness, the KGB gave filmmakers Elena
Kovalieva and Stanislav Belianinov access to KGB martial arts
training, target practice, and the interior of KGB headquarters and
of Lefortovo Prison in northeast Moscow.
   The film devoted several minutes to Kim Philby, the British
secret service officer who spied for the KGB, and included a
re-creation of the apprehension of a U.S. diplomat on spying charges
six years ago.
   The diplomat, Vice Consul Lon David Augustenborg of the Leningrad
Consulate, was expelled Sept. 12, 1983.
   Officials said the KGB had agreed to cooperate in a British-made
film about Philby, who fled to the Soviet Union in 1963 and died in
May 1988 in Moscow.
   Kryuchkov and other KGB officials acknowledge that the KGB's
predecessor, Stalin's NKVD, broke laws in the 1930s, 1940s and 1950s.
   But they said the KGB did not violate any laws in pressuring
dissidents. Virtually every Soviet dissident of the past quarter
century has stories of KGB harassment ranging from searches and
seizure of manuscripts to interrogations and beatings.
   The number of such reports has dropped in recent years under
Gorbachev's reforms. Many dissidents have left the country and
others have found that the critical viewpoints that once made them
pariahs now are well within official bounds. Those still active in
dissident activities say the KGB is less active, but still
unmistakeably present.
   ``In the 1960s, 1970s and 1980s the KGB did not violate the law,
it abided by the letter and the spirit of the law,'' said KGB
spokesman Col. Igor Prelin. ``It's not us who adopted the laws. We
made decisions based on the laws.''
   Westerners and many dissidents in Moscow assume that their
telephones and apartments are bugged.
   Pressed by one Western reporter to discuss bugging, KGB Chief of
Investigations Col. Oleg Dobrovolsky said, ``I don't think you're
right, saying we tap telephones, that we listen to what you say over
telephones. You've got to prove that first, before you ask that
question.''
   ``Sometimes, if it is in the interest of state security, we may
listen to telephones but that's not an established practice, you
know,'' he said.

<HEAD>Actor Performs Court-Ordered Community Service in Hometown</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: MonDay is cq</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DAYTON, Ohio (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Actor Rob Lowe spoke to inmates at five
detention and rehabilitation centers in his hometown to fulfill his
court-ordered community service, and took a side trip to visit Pete
Rose.
   Lowe was in Dayton this week to help his father, attorney Chuck
Lowe, celebrate his 50th birthday Tuesday night.
   The actor had dinner in Cincinnati with Rose, who recently was
banned for life from major league baseball after being accused of
gambling on games involving his team, the Reds.
   ``Pete's always been kind to me, great to me,'' Lowe said. ``We
both have had rough years. But friends are friends and I need
friends.''
   Lowe, 25, who left Dayton 12 years ago for a Hollywood career, is
back for the first time since he was accused of shooting a sexually
explicit videotape involving a teen-age girl during the 1988
Democratic National Convention in Atlanta. A Georgia court sentenced
him to 20 hours of community service.
   He agreed to the community service to avoid possible criminal
action on allegations that he videotaped Jan Parsons, then 16, in a
sex scene with another female in an Atlanta hotel room.
   To fulfill the obligation, he worked as a counselor with Project
MonDay, a court-operated program for first-time, non-violent
offenders. Montgomery County probation officials said Lowe addressed
inmates at five Dayton detention and rehabilitation centers Monday
through Wednesday.
   The actor, who has appeared in such movies as ``St. Elmo's
Fire,'' was expected to visit about 20 schools in the Los Angeles
area, but some officials there protested.
   He remains the subject of a federal lawsuit by Miss Parsons'
mother, Lena Arlene Wilson, who contends that Lowe seduced her
underage daughter.
   Lowe admits he was uneasy about returning to Dayton.
   ``I didn't know what to expect,'' he said. ``People still say,
`This is my daughter, can I take her picture with you?' and this is
the way it's been.''

<HEAD>Eagleburger Counsels Against Granting Trade and Arms Concessions
to Moscow</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BARRY SCHWEID</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The NATO allies should not extend trade and
arms control concessions to the Soviet Union until President Mikhail
Gorbachev's reforms take permanent root, says Deputy Secretary of
State Lawrence Eagleburger.
   In a major foreign policy speech, Eagleburger credited the Soviet
leader Wednesday night with proposing ``the first realistic hope for
a transformation in the nature of the Soviet system and for a
qualitative improvement in East-West relations.''
   But Eagleburger told an audience at Georgetown University that
Gorbachev was driven by severe economic problems threatening to make
the Soviet Union incapable of competing with the Western democracies.
   ``We are hearing we need to take measures to ensure the success
of Gorbachev's reforms,'' Eagleburger said. ``This, however, is not
the task of American foreign policy, nor should it be that of our
Western partners.''
   He continued: ``Our task, after all, is to devise policies which
will serve our interests whether Mr. Gorbachev succeeds or fails.''
   In the audience was Soviet Ambassador Yuri Dubinin. Next week
Secretary of State James A. Baker III will meet in Jackson Hole,
Wyo., with Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze to make
preparations for a superpower summit.
   ``Gorbachev is no anti-communist,'' Eagleburger said, ``and he
intends to make the Soviet Union as strong as he possibly can.''
   The U.S. official also warned against extending trade and arms
control concessions to Moscow without ``the kind of systematic
reforms which alone can make for a stable and confident relationship
between East and West.''
   Delivering a lecture to memorialize the late American diplomat
Samuel Berger, the deputy secretary of state also:
   __Sketched a gloomy picture of Cambodia's future. He said the
United States ``does not have it within its power to determine the
future government'' and that all rival factions must be represented.
This would appear to include the Khmer Rouge, which was accused of
murdering some 1 million Cambodians while ruling the South Asian
country. A peace conference in Paris collapsed in late August.
   __Predicted optimistically that the new government in South
Africa may begin dismantling the system of racial segregation known
as apartheid. ``The chances for change over the next few months are
substantial,'' Eagleburger said.
   In the speech Eagleburger concentrated on the future of the
Western alliance and its stance toward the Soviet Union under
Gorbachev.
   ``He has made hopeful pronouncements on arms reductions and has
slowed the overseas adventurism which did so much to galvanize
Western solidarity in the early 1980s,'' Eagleburger said.
   And yet, the U.S. official said, ``herein lies a danger to
Western interests _ that with the perception growing among the
Western public that the Soviet threat has diminished there will be a
tendency among the member states of the NATO alliance to compete in
expanding their relationships with the East.''
   Already, Eagleburger said without offering any specifics, some
Western nations are showing ``tendencies toward unilateralism in
trade matters.''
   He added: ``Obviously, it is in the Europeans' interest as much,
if not more, than our own to avoid bankrolling merely cosmetic
Soviet reforms or reach arms control agreements which undermine
NATO's ability to deter aggression.''

<HEAD>Commission Says Older Hispanics Suffer More, Get Less Help</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By NANCY BENAC</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Elderly Hispanics suffer more financial
hardships and serious health problems than older Americans in
general but are less likely to benefit from Social Security and
private pensions, a private study shows.
   The Commission on Elderly People Living Alone said Wednesday its
study of America's 1 million older Hispanics shows they ``generally
are not sharing in the economic prosperity enjoyed by other elderly
Americans.''
   The commission, established in 1985 by the Commonwealth Fund
philanthropic foundation, said the problems confronting Hispanics in
later years ``reflect cumulative deficits throughout life.''
   For example, it said, 73 percent of elderly Hispanics received an
eighth-grade education or less and 39 percent speak only Spanish.
   ``These handicaps have consigned many elderly Hispanics
throughout their lifetimes to jobs that offered low pay and no
pension or health insurance benefits,'' the commission said.
``Despite having worked for most of their lives, many Hispanics find
themselves in old age without the means to maintain their
independence.''
   Higher levels of education and English fluency may help younger
Hispanics get better jobs and retirement benefits, but school-age
Hispanics have high dropout rates and ``many may already be on their
way to lives of low-paying jobs and poverty,'' the report said.
   Advocates for the elderly were to discuss the federal
commission's report at a hearing today of the House Select Committee
on Aging.
   The study, based on a national survey of 2,299 older Hispanics,
found 22 percent of elderly Hispanics live below the federal poverty
line, compared with 12 percent of all elderly Americans. Fifty-four
percent of older Hispanics report poor or fair health, compared with
35 percent of all elderly.
   Forty-eight percent of Hispanic elders are very satisfied with
their lives, compared with 64 percent of all elderly, the survey
found.
   Hispanics currently make up 3 percent of the U.S. elderly
population, but are the fastest-growing segment of the senior
population. Their ranks are expected to quadruple to 4 million by
the year 2020, when they will make up 8 percent of the elderly
population, the commission said.
   It attributed lower percentages of Social Security and private
pension beneficiaries among today's elderly Hispanics to the
immigration of some later in life and to their work in service,
unskilled and farm jobs with few benefits.
   Seventy-seven percent of elderly Hispanics receive Social
Security, compared with 92 percent of all elderly; 19 percent of
older Hispanics receive a pension, compared with 45 percent of all
elderly, the survey found.
   Because of their lower incomes, 30 percent of poor elderly
Hispanics receive benefits under Supplemental Security Income, a
government program providing minimum income to poor people who are
elderly, blind or disabled. Sixty-seven percent of poor older
Hispanics are eligible for the benefits, but many don't know they
qualify, the report said.
   Although the report found poverty and health problems throughout
the elderly Hispanic population, there were differences among
different ethnic categories.
   For example, because elderly Mexican-Americans were the most
likely to have been born in the United States and work there longer,
85 percent received Social Security benefits. But 74 percent of
Puerto Ricans living in the continental United States and 66 percent
of Cuban-Americans receive the benefits.
   Cuban-Americans were the best educated and had the lowest poverty
rate _ 35 percent _ compared with 42 percent for Puerto Ricans and
43 percent for Mexican-Americans.

<HEAD>NIH Panel Endorses Some Use Of Pain To Control Destructive Behavior</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Advocacy groups for the retarded charge that a
report saying the use of pain as part of medical treatment to
prevent the retarded from hurting themselves can be beneficial is
``biased and unscientific.''
   A panel of experts convened by the National Institutes of Health
issued the report Wednesday saying that although the techniques may
seem distasteful, it's possible to control self-destructive acts
like head-banging, biting and eye poking.
   Experts have been unable to explain why some people do such
things, or why the pain involved does not halt the action and
prevent a recurrence.
   Some techniques involving pain include an electrical shock device
that is sold for use in private homes, and the use of foul-tasting
chemicals or smells.
   While the panel did not oppose the use of pain to modify
self-destructive behavior, its report said it ``should only be used
in the context of a comprehensive and individualized behavior
enhancement treatment package.''
   ``Most successful approaches involve multiple types of therapy,''
said Dr. R. Rodney Howell, a University of Miami School of Medicine
professor who chaired the committee. He acknowledged ``certain of
these techniques have a negative impression to the public ... even
though they might be beneficial.''
   But Dr. Ralph Maurer, a professor of medicine at the University
of Florida, attacked the finding as ``bad medicine.''
   ``If a medical student used the kind of logic used here, you
would fail him,'' Maurer said. ``The use of these procedures is bad
medicine and its being carried off as good medicine.''
   The NIH panel was convened to consider the appropriate methods of
treating mentally disabled patients, mostly children, who habitually
hurt themselves. The committee said about 160,000 patients in the
United States exhibit destructive behavior and the cost of caring
for them last year was about $3 billion.
   Some doctors and parents control the behavior through aversion
techniques that use pain or discomfort to cause the patient to
change actions. These techniques include delivering a mild
electrical shock, forcing lemon juice or bitter tastes into the
mouth, blowing air on the face, or forcing the patient to smell
strong ammonia salts.
   Officials from several organizations representing the mentally
retarded presented testimony in opposition to the use of painful
therapy and held a news conference after the NIH panel report was
presented.
   Marcia D. Smith, a psychologist for a Maryland organization
called Community Services for Autistic Adults and Children, said,
``For the last 10 years, we have not used painful methods and our
techniques have worked.''
   She said the panel ignored ``the great body of work'' that has
shown pain-based therapy to be flawed, and, as a result, the report
by the committee is ``biased and one-sided.''

   The dollar declined against the yen Thursday, while
the key index on the Tokyo Stock Exchange rose moderately.
   The 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average regained 114.94 points, or
0.34 percent, closing at 34,401.80. The index had lost 45.94 points
the previous day.
   The dollar ended trading at 145.85 yen, down 0.85 yen from
Wednesday's close of 147.03 yen. The currency opened at 146.05 yen
and moved between 145.50 yen and 146.43 yen.
   Currency dealers attributed the dollar's lower opening to its
overnight decline, mainly against major European currencies, on
overseas markets.
   ``The dollar started falling against the yen as foreign investors
sold it against the West German mark,'' said a Bank of Tokyo trader,
speaking on condition of anonymity.
   The currency fell further as the Bank of Japan conducted a
dollar-selling intervention to halt the dollar's excessive rise when
some investors attempted to buy it back, he said.
   The Bank of Japan reportedly sold some $300 million. The central
bank does not comment on its monetary actions.
   Other traders said many market players were sitting on the
sidelines as the market awaited a spate of major U.S. economic
figures this week.
   Among major data to be released by the U.S. government were the
nation's August retail sales, due out later Thursday in Washington,
and the July merchandise trade figures, due Friday.
   On the stock exchange, the market's key index rose as market
players were reassured by the yen's recovery against the dollar,
said Kazuyuki Suzuki, a Daiwa Securities dealer.
   ``The yen's rebound pushed down the short-term interest rate
here, which also reassured participants and encouraged them to buy
stocks,'' he said.
   But trading was light ahead of a three-day weekend starting
Friday, Respect for the Aged Day, a national holiday, Suzuki said.

<HEAD>Bradley Says City Attorney's Report Clears Him of Wrongdoing</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES ANDERSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Mayor Tom Bradley insists a lengthy
investigation exonerated him of wrongdoing as a paid consultant to
two banks, even though the probe resulted in a lawsuit against him.
   ``I would never do anything to harm Los Angeles,'' the fifth-term
mayor said in a televised speech Wednesday. ``I will not let you
down.''
   Hours earlier, City Attorney James Hahn said Bradley had stepped
into a ``gray area of the law'' for his dealings with the banks that
do business with the city. Hahn said the evidence was insufficient
to prosecute Bardley.
   Still, Hahn filed a Superior Court lawsuit that alleges six
failures to report investments, two of them in excess of $100,000.
   The lawsuit was timed with the release of a 1,613-page report on
a five-month investigation by Hahn's office into Bradley's ties with
Far East National Bank and Valley Federal Savings and Loan
Association.
   While Hahn's report cleared the 71-year-old mayor of prosecutable
offenses, ``no vindication of the mayor's conduct is intended,
implied or should in any way be inferred,'' the report said.
   Bradley acknowleged a perceived conflict of interest with his
tenure as a paid director of Valley Federal. The city attorney found
no evidence Bradley was aware he was acting on zoning for
subsidiaries of Valley Federal.
   Bradley also acknowledged that his role as a paid international
trade adviser to Far East and the deposit, without bidding, of $2
million in city funds there, had created ``regrettable
misperceptions.'' But he said he was not involved in the city
treasurer's decision to make the deposit.
   ``When all is said and done, the inquiry confirms what I have
said all along: I did not engage in conflicts of interest. I did not
violate the public's trust,'' he declared.
   After the speech, City Councilman Zev Yaroslavsky said Bradley
had some more explaining to do. ``This is not a speech that is going
to close the door on this,'' Yaroslavsky said.
   Councilman Michael Woo said the day's events should prompt the
council to ``write new laws that will prevent these types of
conflicts from taking place in the future.''
   Bradley still faces possible state and federal investigations of
his ties to a city-funded task force for Africa and to the
investment banking firm of Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. and of an
alleged cover-up by the city treasurer's office.
   Hahn said it was apparent that a March 22 telephone call from
Bradley to City Treasurer Leonard Rittenberg did influence
Rittenberg to deposit $2 million with Far East. Bradley was paid
$18,000 as a consultant to the bank, which he returned when media
attention fell on the case.
   It was also obvious, Hahn said, that someone altered financial
bid sheets following a reporter's inquiry about the deposit.
   Bradley, however, insisted that the report's failure to find any
wrongdoing by him was ``the bottom line.'' The mayor also expressed
confidence his attorneys and Hahn would settle the lawsuit.
   ``The errors I made were not deliberate; they only show that I am
not an accountant, and that I shouldn't have tried to be one,'' he
said, smiling.
   Citing his 47 years as a police officer, councilman and mayor,
Bradley tried to put the investigation behind him and look ahead.
   ``The issue is _ I'm going to put it to rest, put it behind us
and I think the people are going to do the same,'' he said. ``Let me
enjoy for a moment my fifth term.''

<DATELINE>LAS VEGAS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Singer Wayne Newton, the biggest ongoing draw in
Las Vegas showrooms, met with striking musicians to help end the
3-month-old labor dispute that forced him to cancel a
$250,000-a-week engagement.
   Newton spent most of Wednesday's session with the executive
committee of Musicians Union Local 369, which is striking the Las
Vegas Hilton and four other resorts in a dispute over taped music
and guaranteed work.
   ``He said it's a tough spot to be in but he doesn't mind taking
the heat if there is a way to help,'' said union leader Mark Tully
Massagli. ``He's offered his services in whatever way he's needed to
help settle this thing.''
   Newton, who on Tuesday canceled a scheduled three-week engagement
at the Hilton because of the strike, previously had held an informal
meeting between Massagli and Hilton executives.
   ``He's got a lot at stake personally in terms of his contract,
which is for a lot of money,'' said Owen Daley, a Hilton spokesman.
``But he's also a community activist and he knows people on both
sides in this thing.''
   Massagli said no role for Newton was defined in the meeting with
the union's executive committee but that Newton, a Las Vegas
resident who spends much of his time performing before packed
showrooms, could provide a spark to get talks moving.
   The two sides last met Monday. No new talks were scheduled.
   The dispute centers over the insistence of the hotels to replace
musicians in production shows with live music and their
unwillingness to guarantee work for musicians who work the main
showrooms.

<TEXT>
   Environmentalists carted oil-stained rocks to
Capitol Hill as a new tactic in their dispute over Exxon's cleanup
of oil-stained beaches in Alaska.
   Messengers from the National Wildlife Federation on Wednesday
delivered zip-lock plastic bags of oil-stained Alaska rocks to
members of Congress, the White House, and other key members of the
Bush administration, said a spokesmen for the federation.
   Rocks also were delivered to top executives of Exxon Corp., in
New York, said Jay Hair, the federation's president.
   ``These are the rocks that Exxon has cleaned twice,'' said Hair,
adding that he brought them back from Smith Island, one of the areas
of Alaska most affected by the massive spill from the Exxon Valdez
oil tanker last March.
   Despite the double cleaning, oil continues to seep up from
beneath, having penetrated as much as 40 inches in some areas, the
environmentalists said.
   Criticism of Exxon's cleanup efforts increased this week as the
hugh oil company was pulling most of its equipment and manpower out
of the polluted areas for the winter. No further cleanup activity is
planned until next spring, if at all, and Exxon claims that most of
the contaminated beaches have been ``environmentally stabilized.''

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Northeast and Midwest are faring poorly in
the scramble for federal dollars, a situation likely to worsen after
the 1990 Census records the Sunbelt's growth, leaders of a Rust Belt
coalition say.
   ``The demographics are moving against us and representation in
Congress is moving against us,'' William S. Woodside, chairman of
the Northeast-Midwest Leadership Council, said Wednesday at the
group's annual meeting. ``We're hurting.''
   The federal government returned to the 18-state region only 87
cents for every dollar its citizens paid in taxes over the past
eight years, shortchanging it by $359 billion, said Rep. Howard
Wolpe, D-Mich.
   ``At a time when our states are short of funds for much-needed
investments in education, public infrastructure and environmental
protection, we can ill afford such massive disinvestment in our
region,'' said Wolpe, co-chairman of a bipartisan coalition of more
than 100 House members from the Northeast and Midwest.
   Three developments suggest the trend probably will continue, he
said.
   First, programs that have pumped large sums into the region in
recent years are likely victims of deficit-reducing cuts.
   Secondly, the $150 billion savings and loan bailout will shift
money from programs in the Northeast and Midwest to the Southwest
where most of the troubled S&amp;Ls are located, Wolpe said.
   Third, the Northeast and Midwest will likely lose up to 14 seats
in the House of Representatives as a result of the 1990 Census, said
Wolpe.

<NOTE>Production Increase Will Be Permitted</NOTE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Wheat farmers will be permitted to increase
production for 1990 to allow the government to replenish its wheat
reserves, Agriculture Secretary Clayton Yeutter says.
   The Agriculture Department will dip into its reserve for some 3.5
million metric tons of wheat for this year and next to meet U.S.
commitments for international food aid, a department statement said
Wednesday.
   The change in the wheat program will cause a slight increase in
the overall income of wheat farmers, the statement said.
   Because of the program change, acreage of harvested wheat will
increase from an estimated 67.5 million acres to 69.6 million acres.
   Under the 1990 wheat program, farmers are required to idle 5
percent of their wheat acreage to qualify for federal supports.
   Farmers now will be allowed to plant more than 95 percent of the
farm's wheat base, rising to a limit of 105 percent, the statement
said.
   ``The action today does not suggest that we expect another year
of less than average wheat yields, nor will it boost stocks
significantly,'' Yeutter said. ``But it will help restore stocks to
safer levels. In view of the tight U.S. and world supply and demand
situation, we should give wheat producers the option to increase
plantings if they wish to do so.''

<HEAD>Congressman Says DOD Should Check Environmental Problems at Bases
Abroad</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Defense Department should look into
environmental problems at U.S. bases in Europe as those countries
continue to emphasize cleaning up the environment, a Georgia
congressman says.
   Rep. Richard Ray, chairman of the House Armed Services
environmental restoration subcommittee, said Wednesday that his
12-day tour of bases in Europe last month convinced him that there
is ``a changing environmental consciousness in Europe.''
   Ray, a Democrat, said the United States should begin cataloging
environmental problems at its European bases to determine if each
problem was caused by the United States or already existed.
   ``We need to know in advance the cause of these problems,'' he
said. ``Many of them could have been there since World War II.''
   Ray said he intends to hold hearings next year on Defense
Department environmental programs outside U.S. borders.
   ``Changing environmental laws throughout Europe could require
large expenditures of funds in order to comply with the new laws or
to clean up past disposal, storage or spill problems,'' he said.
   Ray said he will focus the hearings initially on U.S. bases in
Europe, but that the department also should be preparing an
assessment of environmental problems at its bases throughout the
world.
   ``Anywhere we are located in the world we need to be a good
citizen, and we need to be practicing good environmental policies,''
he said.
   Ray said U.S. military bases abroad generally operate under much
less stringent environmental standards than do domestic bases
covered by American environmental laws.
   Ray visited U.S. bases in Germany, Great Britain and Italy during
his European trip. He also visited the headquarters of the North
Atlantic Treaty Organization in Brussels and met with government
leaders in Bonn, West Germany.

<HEAD>Dollar Falls, Nikkei Rebounds</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The dollar fell against the Japanese yen for a third
day today, while the Tokyo Stock Exchange's main barometer rebounded.
   The dollar closed at 145.85 yen, down 0.85 yen from the previous
day's 147.03-yen finish. It opened at 146.05 yen and ranged between
145.50 yen and 146.43 yen.
   The dollar has fallen 1.92 yen since closing at a nearly
three-month high of 147.77 yen on Monday.
   Its lower opening Thursday followed a decline on overseas markets
overnight. It fell further during the day as the Bank of Japan
intervened to support the yen by selling dollars, traders said.
   Other traders said the market was awaiting such U.S. economic
figures as August retail sales, due to be announced later Thursday
in Washington, and the July merchandise trade figures, due Friday.
   Volume was estimated at $9.861 billion, up from $7.696 billion
Wednesday.
   The 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average rose by 114.94 points, or 0.34
percent, ending the week's trading at 34,401.80. The index had lost
45.94 points Wednesday.
   The stock and foreign exchange markets will be closed Friday for
the Respect for the Aged national holiday.
   ``Many market players bought issues based on their optimistic
outlook for next week, when they expect economic factors to turn
more favorable for stock investment,'' said Yoshio Shimoyama, a
senior dealer with Nikko Securities.
   ``As a whole, however, the market was rather inactive, with many
participants sitting on the sidelines,'' he said. They, too, were
awaiting the U.S. economic figures, he said.
   First section volume was estimated at 550 million shares, down
from Wednesday's 600 million. Nearly 1 billion shares are traded in
a normal trading day.
   Other dealers attributed the index's recovery to the yen's
recovery against the dollar.
   Meanwhile, Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corp. stock was quoted
at 1.53 million yen ($10,490), up 20,000 yen ($137) from Wednesday,
following the government's announcement that it will put off its
fourth sale of NTT shares at least until March 1990.
   Traders said NTT share buying was based on confidence there would
not be a surge in the supply of NTT stock in the market.
   The original date for the fourth sale had not been made public.
Since NTT, the former government monopoly in telecommunications, was
turned into a private firm on April 1, 1985, the government has sold
5.4 million shares, 35 percent of the shares it owned.
   In announcing the decision to postpone the fourth sale, the
government cited a recent slump in NTT share prices.
   NTT posted a 14.3 percent decline in unconsolidated pretax
profits for the fiscal year that ended March 31, its reorganization
now is being discussed, and its chairman resigned last December in
connection with a widespread bribery case that also has shaken the
governing Liberal Democratic Party.

   Three people were killed and 20 injured in an
explosion in a bus in Nanning, capital of southern China's Guangxi
province, an official report said today.
   The China News Service said the explosion, which occurred as the
bus pulled up at a stop at 7:10 p.m. Sunday, blasted open the front
door of the bus and shattered window glass.
   It said two people died at the scene. Another person died while
being taken to a hospital.
   The report said dozens of passenger crawled out of the bus
through its windows and 20 were injured. It did not say how many
were on the bus at the time of the explosion.

   A fiery methane gas explosion, smoke and
dust figured in the deaths of 10 miners in the nation's worst coal
mine disaster in five years, officials said as a federal
investigation got under way.
   ``It was just a big boom. The ears popped and that was it. The
dirt flew,'' said Tony Hawkins, who was installing support timbers
in the mine about a half mile from the explosion Wednesday morning.
``It was just scary. My knees started shaking.''
   Hawkins said he and others helped to evacuate some miners who
scrambled out of the smoky blast site about 1,000 feet underground
in the Pyro Mining Co.'s William Station Mine.
   By late Wednesday, rescue teams had removed 10 bodies, which were
taken to the state medical examiner's office for autopsies, and all
other miners were safely accounted for, authorities said.
   Fourteen to 15 miners were in the immediate area when a jet of
flame erupted, said Jim Greenlee, an executive vice president of
Pyro's parent company, Costain Coal Inc.
   Officials believe some of the victims survived the explosion
``and succumbed to the smoke and dust,'' Costain President Charles
Schulties said. Some of the miners were found wearing self-rescuing
units, devices miners carry on their belts to filter out poisonous
carbon monoxide in emergencies, he said.
   Paul Tompkins, Webster County deputy coroner, noted that four of
the 10 victims sustained first-degree burns. The rest were not
burned.
   Schulties said it was reasonable to believe that something
sparked a buildup of methane, an explosive gas that occurs naturally
in coal seams and that mine operators are required to ventilate. He
acknowledged that the U.S. Mine Safety and Health Administration
cited the mine about two months ago for high levels of methane.
   State and federal investigators entered the mine Wednesday. But
Kathy Snyder, an MSHA spokeswoman who was in this town about 140
miles southwest of Louisville, said the investigation would not
begin formally until today.
   ``There's no way to tell you anything about the cause until the
investigation takes place,'' she said. A report will be released in
several weeks, she said.
   The accident claimed the highest death toll since 27 miners died
in a Utah coal mine on Dec. 19, 1984, said Frank O'Gorman, an MSHA
spokesman.
   Kentucky and federal records show four previous fatal accidents
at the Pyro mine since it opened in February 1983, including a 1986
death that may have been related to methane. Less than a year ago,
three miners were hurt in a blasting accident.
   O'Gorman said the explosion occurred as the miners dismantled
longwall mining machinery, which continuously moves a cutter from
side to side along a long exposed coal face.
   The mine, which Schulties said employs 367 miners on three
shifts, is in rural western Kentucky about 40 miles southwest of
Evansville, Ind.
   At Union County Methodist Hospital in the adjacent county, a
disaster plan was implemented, calling in off-duty doctors and
nurses, and ministers to help counsel family members.
   ``All I could do was just listen to them and let them cry,'' said
the Rev. Brad Whistle of St. Ann's Catholic Church in Morganfield.
``Despair is despair. I just listened to them.''
   ``We always live under the danger that there is something there
that could take us out of this world,'' said the Rev. Bobby Joe
Williamson, pastor of the New Harmony Rock Springs Baptist Church in
Wheatcroft.
   ``All we could do now was pray for the families, that they be
sustained and well taken care of. We can't change anything,'' said
Williamson.
   One of the victims, foreman Roger Clifford, 32, of Morganfield,
left a wife and two small sons, said his brother, Randy.
   ``All of his men respected him,'' he said. `They thought a lot of
him.'' His voice faltering, he added, ``You just couldn't beat him.''
   The other victims were Lynn Austin Ashmore, 31, and Kenneth
Edward Reed, 32, of Slaughters; Mark Steven Hedges, 31, of
Morganfield; Rick Dale Furgerson, 34, and Curtis Scott, 47, of
Madisonville; Paul Terry Harris, 39, and Anthony Terry McElroy, 36,
of Providence; Ernest Warren Stewart, 40, of Mortons Gap; and James
Anthony Tinsley, 36, of Marion.

<HEAD>`Fishbait' Miller, Former U.S. House Doorkeeper, Dies</HEAD>
<DATELINE>GREENSBORO, N.C. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   William ``Fishbait'' Miller, who during
his three decades as the folksy doorkeeper of the U.S. House once
said ``Howdy ma'am'' to the future Queen Elizabeth II, has died. He
was 80.
   Miller died Tuesday night at his Greensboro home, said Sherrill
Bumgarner, director of Hanes-Lineberry Funeral Home. The cause of
death was not given.
   Miller arrived in Washington, D.C., from his native Pascagoula,
Miss., in 1933. From his job as a clerk in the House post office, he
rose to become the official doorkeeper.
   His knowledge of the workings of Capitol Hill led to his book
``Fishbait,'' which included accounts of the drinking and sexual
exploits of several members of Congress.
   Miller's job involved more than guarding doors. He supervised 357
employees and an annual budget of $3.5 million. He oversaw
messengers, pages, barbers and janitors.
   Miller was first named minority doorkeeper in 1947, when the
Democrats lost control of the House. He had competition for the job
in 1949, when the Democrats regained majority status, but he wrote
personal notes to each member while his opponent sent a mimeographed
letter.
   Miller said he helped Democratic House members get their choice
of offices by sanding his fingertips so he could identify by touch
the metal disks drawn to determine office assignments.
   Miller, who got his nickname as a child for being so small, had
several stories he loved to tell.
   ``I'm the man who got in trouble by saying, `Howdy, ma'am' when I
was introduced to the Queen of England,'' he recalled in a 1982
interview. Miller said the encounter had involved then-Princess
Elizabeth. He said President Truman later told him he had warned the
princess Miller was a ``character.''
   ```Well, Fishbait, I warned them and you sure didn't let me
down,''' Miller quoted Truman as saying.
   Miller, who left his post in the mid-1970s, said his favorite
Democrats were Truman and longtime House Speaker Sam Rayburn.
   ``Sam Rayburn's heart was as big as my head and your head put
together,'' he once said. ``And Truman, I liked him because he said
exactly what he meant and you always knew exactly where he stood.''
   His favorite Republicans included Joseph Martin, also a House
speaker, Gerald Ford and Rep. John Rhodes.

<TEXT>
   President Corazon Aquino said today
that she will decide whether to allow U.S. military bases to stay
after 1991 primarily on Filipino interests rather than regional
security concerns.
   In an interview with The Associated Press, Mrs. Aquino said she
was waiting to hear what Washington was prepared to offer before
making her decision on the bases, whose lease expires in September
1991.
   U.S. and Filipino officials are expected to begin talks late this
year on the future of Clark Air Base, the Subic Bay naval base and
four smaller installations.
   U.S. officials claim the bases are essential for maintaining
security in the Far East, including the six-member Association of
Southeast Asian Nations, to which the Philippines belongs.
   ``I will decide this based on what I believe will be in the
interest of the Filipino people,'' Mrs. Aquino said. ``While it is
true we are of ASEAN, my first consideration naturally is for the
interest of the Filipino people and after that what will benefit the
ASEAN region.''
   Singapore has offered air and naval facilities in case the
Philippines closes the U.S. installations. But American officials
say Singapore's facilities cannot match the size and location of
those in the Philippines.
   Last October, the United States agreed to pay $461 million a year
in aid to keep the bases until 1991.
   U.S. officials warn that Washington is not prepared to pay
substantially more for the bases because they contribute to
Philippine defense.
   During the interview, Mrs. Aquino refused to say whether she
believes the bases guarantee regional security. She noted, however,
that the presence of American bases did not prevent Japanese forces
from invading this island nation during World War II.
   ``If you are referring to the Second World War, they didn't, as
you know, contribute too much,'' she said. ``In fact, there are
people who think that perhaps we were the first to be attacked
simply because of the presence of U.S. bases.''
   Vice President Dan Quayle is expected to discuss the bases issue
when he arrives Sep. 26 for a three-day visit. The issue is also
expected to be raised when Mrs. Aquino visits the United States in
November.
   Any new bases agreement must be ratified by two-thirds of the
23-member Philippine Senate. Last month, 12 senators called for the
bases to be closed in 1991. That would be enough to block any
extension of the agreement.
   Mrs. Aquino also refused to say whether she personally believes a
new agreement would be in the national interest.
   ``I don't think this is the time to be defining it because we
don't know, first of all, do the Americans still want to use these
facilities,'' she said.
   ``And secondly, what are they wanting in the matter of the use of
these bases, and, also, what are they prepared to do. This has to be
discussed lengthily if and when we start talks on the bases.''
   Regardless of the outcome, Mrs. Aquino said she wanted to retain
close ties with the United States, the Philippines' former colonial
ruler.
   ``I am hoping that both the Americans and the Filipinos can
maintain a very friendly relationship because we Filipinos would
like to believe that there is more (to the relationship) than just
the matter of the bases,'' she said.
   ``I think sometimes some of us believe that maybe where some
Americans are concerned, the only thing that probably ties the two
nations together is the presence of the U.S. facilities in our
bases.''

   Showers and thunderstorms lingered in the south-central United
States today while to the west skies were clear.
   Thunderstorms produced heavy rainfall Wednesday night in Kentucky
and Tennesssee.
   Early today, showers and thunderstorms were scattered from
northern Mississippi across middle Tennessee to eastern Kentucky.
Light rain and drizzle spread from Arkansas across much of Missouri
and Illinois.
   Showers and thunderstorms also were developing across New York
state and in the lower Rio Grande Valley of Texas.
   In Oklahoma on Wednesday, heavy rainfall forced the Cottonwood
Creek out of its banks, sending about 20 families in Guthrie out of
their homes and to higher ground.
   In Lewisville, Texas, a storm swept through a marina, damaging
docks and sinking several boats. The National Weather Service could
not say for certain whether a tornado had swept through the area.
But the manager of the marina said people aboard boats heard ``what
sounded like a twister. Then it got real quiet. They evacuated their
boats, and then, all of a sudden, it just sucked everything up.'' No
one was hurt.
   Skies today were clear across the upper Mississippi Valley and in
much of the country west of the Great Plains.
   Elsewhere, Hurricane Hugo, east of the Lesser Antilles, was
moving west at about 20 mph. It had maximum sustained winds of 75
mph and is expected to get stronger in the next day or two.
   Today's forecast called for scattered showers and thunderstorms
extending from Kentucky, Tennessee and Arkansas to the Gulf Coast
states into Texas.
   Occasional rain was forecast from central and southern New
England, across New York, Pennsylvania and the Ohio Valley.
   High temperatures in the 80s to lower 90s were predicted from the
mid-Atlantic states down to the Gulf. From the Rockies to the West
Coast, readings were expected to be mostly be in the 70s and 80s.
Temperatures in the 90s to near 100 were forecast for the interior
valleys of California and in the Desert Southwest.
   The nation's temperatures at 3 a.m. EDT ranged from 33 in
Laramie, Wyo., to 85 in Yuma, Ariz.

<TEXT>
   A jury declared Operation Rescue founder
Randall Terry and four members of the radical anti-abortion group
innocent of misdemeanor charges stemming from blockades of women's
health clinics.
   Jurors indicated Wednesday after delivering their verdicts that
they had accepted Terry's ``necessity defense,'' in which he and his
co-defendants claimed laws can be broken to prevent a greater harm.
   The Municipal Court judge had told the jury to disregard this
defense because abortions are legal.
   Terry, who represented himself, praised the jury's decisions.
   ``Thank God that the jurors had the courage to declare that our
efforts were to save children and not a deliberate attempt to commit
a crime,'' Terry said in a statement.
   The acquittals were greeted with dismay by the California
Abortion Rights Action League.
   ``I am flabbergasted that the jury did not convict the defendants
of trespassing and conspiracy,'' said Robin Schneider, the group's
executive director.
   After four days of deliberation, the jury found the activists
innocent of five misdemeanor charges, including trespassing and
resisting arrest.
   The jury also deadlocked 8-4 for conviction on conspiracy counts
against Terry, 30, of Binghamton, N.Y., Michael McMonagle, 36, of
Philadelphia and Jeff White, 31.
   Judge Richard Paez declared a mistrial on those counts, meaning
they could be refiled. Prosecutors said a decision on refiling would
be made by Oct. 2.
   The others on trial were Don Bennette, 36, of Mission Viejo, and
Andrew Eppink, 41, of Palmdale.
   The case stemmed from the blockade of a Los Angeles women's
clinic on March 25. The demonstrations were held as the U.S. Supreme
Court considered a Missouri law it eventually upheld, broadening the
role of states in regulating abortions.
   The five were on trial for allegedly ignoring a federal
injunction barring activists from blocking entrances to abortion
clinics. Terry denied he ever was served a copy of the injunction.
   Juror Priscilla Ramos agreed with Terry, saying the men ``were
trying to save lives and we were for that, too. I'd love to shake
Randall Terry's hand.''
   Juror Edmond Bleavins, 43, said he hoped the verdict would send a
message to the police department. ``The police just brutalized these
people in my opinion,'' he said.
   Bleavins said he did not intend to give Operation Rescue the
message they could ``keep on doing what they've been doing.'' He
said the jury deadlocked on conspiracy because at least one juror
believed the defendants' intent was not to break the law but to save
babies.
   The judge had admonished Terry and the other defendants for
repeatedly drawing the jury's attention to their stance against
legal abortions.
   During the trial, Terry frequently referred to abortion clinics
as ``aboratorium,'' ``killing centers'' and ``abortion mills,''
prompting Paez to rebuke him for using inflammatory language.
   The issue at trial was not abortion, but trespassing, the judge
said, ruling the defendants' motives for their actions were not
legitimate defenses in the case.

<HEAD>Humanities Graduate Students Must Take A Year Off And Work In The
Field</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BEIJING (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Most new humanities graduate students will have to
take a year off to work in factories or rural areas to improve their
``political understanding'', an official report said today.
   The China Youth News daily said first-year graduate students will
be sent to work in ``grass-roots units'' for ``training.''
   The announcement by the State Education Commission applies to
students studying philosophy, economics, history, law, education and
literature.
   It was the latest effort by the government to increase student
exposure to work programs and political education following
authorities' violent crackdown on the pro-democracy movement in June.
   The government claims students joined the movement because they
were politically and socially naive.
   The daily quoted the Education Commission as saying, ``Working in
grass-roots units is good for reforming graduates' thinking. It
helps to correct their problems of lacking practical experience, and
ignorance of the country and the masses.''
   It said the training will help ensure that students remain
faithful to ``socialist principles'' and oppose ``bourgeois
liberalization'', or support of Western ideas.
   The students can only go back to school after they complete their
training, the newspaper said.
   The government has denied the work programs are a throwback to
the Cultural Revolution, when millions of students and intellectuals
were sent to the countryside to work as manual laborers for up to 10
years.
   Last month the government announced that civil servants who
graduated from college in 1985 or later must work one or two years
in ``grass-roots units'' to improve their political understanding.
   Many young government workers joined the demonstrations or
expressed support for their democratic goals.
   The civil servants were warned that their residence permits,
required for living and working in Beijing, will be switched to
their new locations and they will only be allowed to return to the
capital if they perform well.
   Beijing University, a hotbed of protest during the spring
pro-democracy movement, has had its freshman class cut from 2,100 to
800 and has been told that the majority of new students must spend a
year studying at a military school in another city before coming to
Beijing.
   Students at all Beijing universities are being required to start
the school year with a month of political education classes in which
they must study government documents justifying the crackdown on the
``counterrevolutionary rebellion'' and the need to fight bourgeois
liberalization.

   Yu Teng-fa, a pioneer in Taiwan's political
opposition movement, was slain at his home, police said today.
   Yu, 86, a member of the Democratic Progressive Party, was found
dead Wednesday at his home in Kaohsiung, about 210 miles south of
Taipei, where he lived alone. Relatives said a visitor found him on
his back in a pool of blood.
   Chen Yueh-ying, Yu's daughter-in-law and Kaohsiung magistrate,
told reporters he suffered a deep wound on the back of his head. The
local coroner said Yu probably died of a blow by a blunt object.
   Police declined to speculate on whether Yu was slain by political
opponents, but Democratic Progressive Party leaders suggested he was
the victim of a plot by the ruling Nationalist Party.
   ``Violence has overshadowed Taiwan as we are preparing to
campaign for the December elections,'' opposition party chairman
Huang Hsin-chieh said in a statement.
   The December elections for legislative, mayoral and magisterial
seats will be the first since opposition parties were legalized
after martial law was lifted in 1987.
   The Nationalist Party denied the accusations and issued a
statement condemning ``any individuals or groups that try to provoke
disputes with sensational remarks.''
   Yu, a rich land and property owner, had supported his
daughter-in-law and two grandchildren running in the December
elections as opposition candidates. The Yu family has dominated
Kaohsiung politics for the past three decades.
   Yu, born in Taiwan to a farm family in 1903, was elected a member
of the Nationalist government's National Assembly in 1947. But he
left the Nationalist Party the following year and subsequently
became a pioneering member of Taiwan's opposition movement.
   Yu was elected Kaohsiung magistrate in 1960. He was suspended
from the job three years later on corruption charges.
   He was sentenced to eight years' imprisonment in 1979 on charges
of helping spread Communist propaganda but was released on bail the
following year for hospital treatment of an undisclosed illness from
which he later recovered.

<HEAD>Polish Tourists Report Beating By Romanian Border Troops</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WARSAW, Poland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Thirty Poles told their embassy in Hungary
they were beaten by Romanian border soldiers after being forced off
a train en route to Bucharest, the state news agency reported today.
   The tourists were traveling from Budapest Tuesday night when they
were told by the Romanian soldiers to leave the train, forced to
turn over their passports and left on a station platform while the
train departed, according to the PAP report.
   ``When I asked for my passport, I was dragged by force inside the
office, where I was brutally beaten,'' PAP quoted Bogdan Zapart of
Legnica as saying.
   He said the soldiers used rifles and tear gas to beat and harass
other Poles coming to his aid, and the group was locked in a waiting
room, PAP reported.
   Zapart said he was handcuffed to a chair and beaten repeatedly,
PAP said.
   Emilia Kwietniewska, of Bialogard, said she saw messages on the
walls of the waiting room written in Polish by other Poles about
beatings, robberies and other attacks.
   ON Wednesday morning, the Romanians demanded a payment of 2,000
lei ($167 at the official exchange rate or $28 on the black market)
to release Zapart, and then put the travelers on a train back to
Budapest, PAP said.
   The story was reported on the front pages of several Polish
newspapers today, including one that used the headline ``Romanian
border soliders are robbing and raping?'' and then asked, ``Does Mr.
Ceausescu know about this?'' referring to Romania's hard-line
Communist leader.

   The dollar was lower against most major currencies
in nervous European trading early today as traders awaited the
release of key U.S. economic indicators. Gold prices were higher.
   Dealers said the dollar fell sharply in earlier Asian trading
amid speculation that West Germany may raise its interest rates,
then recovered some of its losses in European dealings.
   They said the dollar, whose underlying trend is bullish, should
be little affected by today's release of U.S. retail sales figures,
which were expected to rise by 0.1 percent.
   U.S. trade figures for July, due out on Friday, should have a
greater impact, dealers said. The market anticipated the deficit to
widen to $9 billion from $8.17 billion in June.
   ``The bullish sentiment will only disappear if West Germany
raises interest rates or if the U.S. trade deficit is higher than
expected,'' said a trader in Rome.
   In Tokyo, where trading ends before Europe's business day begins,
the dollar fell 0.85 Japanese yen to a closing 145.85 yen. Later, in
London, it edged back up to 146.33 yen.
   Other dollar rates at midmorning compared with late Wednesday:
   _1.9680 West German marks, down from 1.9800
   _1.6965 Swiss francs, down from 1.7095
   _6.6440 French francs, down from 6.6805
   _2.2147 Dutch guilders, down from 2.2300
   _1,414.25 Italian lire, down from 1,419.00
   _1.1833 Canadian dollars, down from 1.1858
   In London, the British pound rose to $1.5612 from $1.5530 late
Wednesday.
   Gold opened in London at a bid price of $360.35 a troy ounce, up
from $358.50 bid late Wednesday. At midmorning, the city's five
major bullion dealers fixed a recommended price of $359.80 dollars.
   In Zurich, the bid price was $359.75, up from $358.25 bid late
Wednesday.
   Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold rose 47 cents to a closing bid of
$360.40.
   Silver rose in London to a bid price of $5.09 a troy ounce, up
from $5.08 bid late Wednesday.

   A nursing home aide smothered five
patients ``because it relieved tension,'' and enjoyed cleaning the
body of one victim, her alleged co-conspirator in a lovers' death
pact testified.
   Testimony began Wednesday in the trial of Gwendolyn Graham, who
is charged with five counts of first-degree murder and one of
conspiracy to murder in the 1987 deaths of female patients at Alpine
Manor Nursing Home in subruban Walker.
   Graham and her former lover, Catherine Wood, allegedly formed a
pact to kill patients.
   ``We were supposed to take turns killing so we could never leave
each other,'' said Wood, who also worked as an aide at the home.
   Wood, 27, has pleaded guilty to one count of second-degree murder
and one count of conspiracy to murder. In exchange for her plea and
testimony against Graham, two counts of first-degree murder were
dropped.
   The Grand Rapids woman testified she lacked the nerve to kill any
patients, though she acted as a lookout while Graham suffocated them
with washcloths. She also said she and Graham would select patients
by pinching their noses to see if they would struggle.
   Wood said Graham told her she enjoyed killing patients ``because
it relieved tension. ... She was always real happy afterwards and I
wanted her to be happy.'' She said Graham seemed to enjoy bathing
her first victim in preparation for the funeral home.
   She said she never tried to stop Graham. ``I never told her `no.'
... I never loved anybody the way I loved her.''
   She said Graham took souvenirs _ such as anklets and earrings _
from each victim.
   ``I didn't think it was right. A lot of those people had a lot of
life left in them and we were there to care for them, not to abuse
them,'' Wood said.
   Wood said she witnessed Graham suffocating the first victim,
Marguerite Chambers. ``She had a washcloth over her nose and mouth
and (Chambers) was making noises ... she was jerking,'' Wood
testified.
   She said she and Graham told some other aides at the home about
the slayings, but that no one took the confessions seriously.
   Defense attorney James Piazza opened by calling Wood a
``spiteful, aggressive, vindictive manipulator'' who made up the
story. He said Graham went along with it, ``thinking it was a mind
game, ... a big joke.''
   He said Wood concocted the story to get back at Graham, who had
left town for her native Tyler, Texas, with another nurse's aide.
   After police began investigating Wood's alleged confession to her
ex-husband, Wood ``needed a sacrificial lamb,'' Piazza said. ``She
offered up Gwen Graham because she feared of going to prison for the
rest of her life.'' First-degree murder carries a mandatory life
sentence without parole, while Wood has a chance of parole in 10
years on the lesser charges.
   When the five patients died between Jan. 18 and April 7, 1987,
their deaths were listed as natural and no autopsies were performed.
Two bodies were exhumed but showed no definitive signs of
suffocation.
   The victims were Chambers, 60, Myrtle Luce, 95, Mae Mason, 79,
Belle Burkhard, 74, and Edith Cook, 97.

<TEXT>
   Former President Carter says he is trying to move
peace negotiations between Ethiopia and Eritrea toward compromise,
but both sides seem satisfied that they were even able to get
together.
   Carter said during a college forum Wednesday that he won't give
the Ethiopian government and the Eritrean People's Liberation Front
a deadline on reaching an agreement. He just wants to move them
beyond the excitement over their first negotiations after 28 years
of fighting.
   ``I spent very frustrating hours this morning with the Eritreans
and Ethiopians, trying to get them to agree on a compromise,''
Carter said. ``They've been in the same room, eating at the same
table, exchanging ideas and information.
   ``Both sides are so proud of what they've done so far that they
are inclined to look upon this partial success as adequate.''
   The talks continued through a sixth day Wednesday without Carter.
   Carter Center spokeswoman Beth Carpenter said talks broke off
late Wednesday and were expected to continue today.
   Carter said he had cautioned both sides against ``negative
reports to the press,'' saying such statements ``make it doubly
difficult for them to go back into negotiations the next day.''
   About 1 million people have died in fighting and famine related
to the war over the independence of Eritrea, a northern province
that contains the East African country's only direct access to the
Red Sea.
   The Eritrean Front in the past has demanded the people of Eritrea
be allowed to vote on whether they want independence, federation
with Ethiopia or autonomy. The government has proposed a greater
measure of autonomy for the province but has unequivocally ruled out
any referendum.
   Carter has said the delegates had agreed to 13 items, but he has
not said what those items were. He also has said that agreeing on an
agenda for future talks would be the most difficult issue.
   The college forum Wednesday was Carter's eighth annual Town Hall
Meeting for students and faculty of Emory University.
   Carter called for more funding for drug treatment, a strong
commitment to the Coast Guard in stopping drugs from reaching the
country, and for encouraging international cooperation in the drug
war. He also called for the Bush administration to monitor the
transfer of funds between U.S. and foreign banks to help monitor the
flow of drug money.
   The crowd roared when one student asked what Carter's favorite
late-night TV program was, and he replied he only watched late-night
television when his daughter, Amy, was on David Letterman's show.
   ``We'd watch to see if Amy had been arrested lately,'' he joked
of his daughter's four civil disobedience arrests, which Letterman
has parodied. ``But so far we've been proud of her every time.''

   Miss Louisiana gave in to a craving
for chocolate chip cookies after winning the swimsuit contest on the
second night of preliminary competition for the Miss America Pageant.
   Miss Oklahoma won the talent portion Wednesday night with a
rendition of ``Since I Fell For You,'' which she listened to as a
child with her mother.
   Miss Louisiana Stacy King, a green-eyed 5-foot-5 blonde who
weighs 105 pounds, wore a white swimsuit with spaghetti straps at
the shoulders.
   To stay in shape, Miss King plays softball, dances, bicycles and
trains with weights every day.
   She said she also ran up and down steps at her high school
stadium. ``All those stadium steps really paid off,'' Miss King said.
   She said one of her biggest sacrifices for the pageant was giving
up chocolate chip cookies. ``I gave them up right after I won the
state pageant on June 18 _ that's 2{ months. If I lose in Atlantic
City, I'll eat a lot of them.''
   She said she would allow herself the two chocolate chip cookies
left for each contestant before bed as part of a sponsor promotion.
   Miss King, a 23-year-old from Slidell, has a degree in fashion
merchandising from Louisiana Tech University and plans to obtain a
degree in dental hygiene. Eventually, she said she hopes to combine
both degrees to design work uniforms.
   Miss Oklahoma Tamara Denise Toshiko Marler, a 26-year-old from
Tulsa, said she did not rehearse her selection during the day.
   ``I don't practice because it's not fresh that way,'' she said.
``It's just not real.''
   Miss Marler said ``Since I Fell For You'' is special because she
listened to it during her childhood with her mother, who is at the
pageant.
   She said the song rarely fails to move listeners because ``when
you sing love songs ... about hearts getting broken, the audience
can feel it.''
   For her performance, she wore a full-length navy silk gown beaded
with Mediterranean blue bugle beads and featuring a sweetheart
neckline.
   Miss Marler is a marketing graduate of the University of Tulsa
and hopes to become a lawyer.
   The three nights of preliminary competition for the 51
contestants are the first steps to the nationally televised Miss
America finals Saturday night.
   The 10 women who have accumulated the most points in preliminary
competitions and interviews with the judges will become the top 10
finalists. Those 10 will start with a clean slate Saturday night,
competing to succeed Miss America 1989 Gretchen Elizabeth Carlson.
   The 63rd annual pageant will be broadcast on NBC-TV at 10 p.m.
EDT Saturday.

   A giant groundbreaking party, ``The Big
Dig,'' is set for the Great American Pyramid sports and
entertainment arena, which is being touted as a prime tourist
attraction when it opens in 1991.
   ``It's the first pyramid of consequence to be built in 5,000
years and it just happens to have an arena in it,'' said Sidney
Shlenker, who helped develop Houston's Astrodome in the 1960s and is
working on the pyramid.
   Groundbreaking is scheduled for Friday night, complete with
parades, street parties and fireworks. It will feature a
75-foot-long arrangement of lights in the shape of a shovel, and a
light and laser display showing the size of the future pyramid.
   That display will be formed by stringing lights from a
321-foot-tall industrial crane at the center of the pyramid site,
said Henry Turley Jr., a Memphis real estate developer helping
organize the groundbreaking, called ``The Big Dig.''
   With music traditional to Memphis playing over loudspeakers along
the downtown riverfront, a police helicopter will deliver the
75-foot ``shovel'' to signal the beginning of a fireworks display,
Turley said.
   Comedian Dan Aykroyd will perform at the Mud Island party with
other members of the Blues Brother review, a rock 'n' roll band
featured in a movie by the same name starring Aykroyd and the late
John Belushi.
   Local government is paying for the $56 million arena. Shlenker
has an agreement to operate it, take the lion's share of any profits
and pay the money back over 25 years.
   He also has a contract giving him control of a nearby $63 million
tourist park the city built in 1983 on a 3-mile-long Mississippi
River sandbar called Mud Island.
   Shlenker, a former owner of the Denver Nuggets of the National
Basketball Association, runs four Memphis corporations, which he
groups under the name of The Pyramid Companies. He and his principal
financial partner, international businessman John Tigrett Sr.,
expect to spend some $80 million developing the pyramid-park project.
   The pyramid began with plans four years ago to provide a new
basketball arena for Memphis State University. The idea grew of
building a pyramid-shaped arena to play on Memphis' link to its
namesake, the ancient capital of Egypt which stood beside the Nile.

<HEAD>Consumer Advocate Urges Greater Protection for Japanese</HEAD>

<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Ralph Nader, America's leading consumer crusader,
said today that information is the root of all consumer protection
and urged a national freedom of information law for Japan.
   Nader said such a law should be patterned after the U.S. Freedom
of Information Act, which he called the strongest guarantee of
information access in the world.
   Japan has no national freedom of information law, although some
states, or prefectures, possess weak ones, Nader told reporters at a
luncheon.
   He said access to information about government spending and
standards is crucial to challenging policies in such areas as
asbestos in public buildings, auto safety, air quality and nuclear
power.
   Access to information also would serve as a tonic to Japan's
lifeless consumer movement, he said.
   ``Now, the ability to turn civic voices into civic success just
isn't here,'' he added.
   For instance, he said a movement to rid public schools of
asbestos can't get off the ground because citizens are unable to
obtain information on what school buildings contain insulation or
roofing made with asbestos.
   Japan's consumers pay among the highest prices in the world for
housing, food and services and its consumer movement has been
relatively weak.
   Big business has had the ear of the governing Liberal Democratic
Party for the past 34 years.
   Consumer groups and analysts say, however, that with the party's
flagging popularity, resulting primarily from a 3 percent sales tax
imposed in April, consumer interests are commanding the attention of
the highest levels of government.
   Nader, whose non-profit Congress Watch is based in Washington,
D.C., said both the United States and Japan aid selected domestic
industries with subsidies, and use trade policies and barriers to
keep competitive products out of their markets.
   Subsidies to Japanese rice farmers cost consumers $18 billion
annually, according to U.S. estimates.
   Since citizens pay for these subsidies and pay higher prices
because of such trade policies, Nader proposed a consumer trust
fund, paid for by protected industries, to support consumer
protection activities.
   He also urged stronger health and safety standards and rigorous
enforcement of anti-monopoly laws, and said citizens should have the
right to file class action lawsuits.

<TEXT>
   Actress Zsa Zsa Gabor, on trial for
slapping a Beverly Hills cop, says she doesn't want to go to jail
because she's ``afraid of lesbians.''
   The Municipal Court jury that could put the flamboyant actress
behind bars were sworn in Wednesday. Opening arguments were to begin
today.
   On the steps of the courthouse Wednesday, Miss Gabor confided in
reporters her fears of being convicted. A conviction carries a
maximum two years in jail and $4,000 fine.
   ``Mother is so worried,'' Miss Gabor said. ``In a deathly voice,
she phoned me this morning and asked me, `Dahling, are they going to
book you in jail?'
   ``I told her I hoped not. I have claustrophobia and would be very
unhappy in jail.
   ``And besides, they are all lesbians in jail. And I'm so scared
of lesbians. Can you imagine being in jail with all those women?''
   Miss Gabor is charged with misdemeanor battery on a police
officer, disobeying a police officer's orders, driving with an
expired license, having an open container of alcohol in her car and
having an expired car registration.
   She was arrested June 14 after a policeman stopped her for having
expired registration tags on her $215,000 Rolls-Royce Corniche
convertible. While the officer was checking for other infractions,
Miss Gabor allegedly drove away, only to be caught again two blocks
away.
   At that point, the officer said, she slapped him.
   The former Miss Hungary pleaded innocent July 12 and maintains
she was verbally and physically abused by the officer, Paul Kramer.
   The defense's strategy in the trial, which is expected to last
about two weeks, is to show that Kramer had a history of harassing
celebrities.
   Prosecutors have said they would try to prevent the testimony
from being heard. Some of the past incidents involving Kramer are
too old or different from Miss Gabor's to be pertinent to her trial,
prosecutors said.
   Miss Gabor denied she savored the publicity accompanying her
trial.
   ``The Beverly Hills police started this. It was two days later my
press agent called and said, `Zsa Zsa, you have to protect
yourself.' I don't need this publicity,'' she said.
   Whether she needs it or not, the press has hounded Miss Gabor and
her eighth and current husband Prince Frederick von Anhalt,
Germany's Duke of Saxony.
   He wore dark sunglasses in court Wednesday, the third day of
tedious jury selection. Reporters were watching closely to see if he
would fall asleep as he had been reported doing the previous two
days.
   Court documents reveal Miss Gabor was born June 6, 1923, making
her 66, although she has been extremely secretive about her age.

<TEXT>
   A strong earthquake shook a wide area of
northern Italy during the night, cracking walls in old buildings and
sending thousands of panicked residents into the streets, officials
reported today.
   At least six people suffered minor injuries from rushing out of
their homes in Trento, near the epicenter in the foothills of the
Dolomite Alps in northeastern Italy, the Civil Defense Ministry in
Rome said.
   Another person was hospitalized with shock, the ministry said.
   It said it could not confirm reports that a woman died of a heart
attack.
   The tremor, which lasted about 15 seconds, was felt from Trieste,
near the Yugoslav border, to Bologna about 240 miles to the west.
   Thousands of people, many in their nightclothes, rushed out of
their homes when the ground shook just before midnight. Many spent
the night in their cars.
   The National Geophysics Institute in Rome said the quake measured
between 6 and 7 on the 12-point Mercalli scale, which gauges the
intensity of an earthquake as felt in a specific location.
   A quake of that magnitude can crack the walls and ceilings of
buildings.
   The epicenter was pinpointed near Rovereto, 16 miles south of
Trento, a quake-prone area in the Adige River valley.
   The jolt damaged some old buildings in Rovereto, Ala and Rival
Del Garda, along the shores of Lake Garda, officials said.

   The barge, carrying a cargo of 96,000 barrels or about 4.03
million gallons of gasoline, ran aground Wednesday night just north
of the Triborough Bridge, said Petty Officer Jeff Crawley.
   Most of the gasoline that spilled was expected to evaporate,
Crawley said.
   The vessel, belonging to the Manhattan-based Morania Oil Tankers,
was towed to a dock, where a second barge arrived early today to
take on the remaining gasoline from a damaged 315,000-gallon tank,
said Crawley.
   Refloating the 300-foot barge took only 15 minutes, said another
Coast Guard spokesman, Lt. Cmdr. Paul Mulligan.
   The Triborough Bridge and a railroad bridge that had been closed
to avoid igniting fumes were reopened 6{ hours after the Morania 440
struck bottom about 150 to 200 feet offshore in a rocky channel.
   Crawley said the tugboat East Coast, which was towing the barge,
apparently took a curve too tight or got too close to the bank.
   The barge was en route from Philadelphia to New Haven, Conn.

   Members of the New York City Opera orchestra
showed up at Lincoln Center in full dress and with their instruments
in tow _ but only to walk a picket line.
   The opera canceled Wednesday's season opener of Rossini's ``The
Barber of Seville'' after the musicians went on strike in a wage
dispute.
   The opera's singers, who are represented by another union, and
other workers are not on strike but generally honored the musicians'
picket lines.
   ``We will not perform while they are on strike,'' said Martin
Oppenheimer, the company's board vice chairman. ``The sad part about
this is ... we will never have the performances that have to be
canceled because of the strike.''
   The opera's season runs through Nov. 19.
   No talks were scheduled.
   The musicians voted 53-4 Tuesday night to strike after talks
failed to resolve disputes over weekly wages and how many weeks per
year the musicians will be guaranteed a paycheck.
   Except for 1986, no contract with the orchestra since 1962 was
achieved without some type of work stoppage.

   A mixed-race policeman who
accused white police officers of brutally suppressing an election
protest in his neighborhood peacefully dispersed a demonstration in
his honor today.
   Lt. Gregory Rockman has become a folk hero among township youths
near Cape Town since he accused white officers of beating protesters
and bystanders during an anti-election protest Sept. 5 in his
neigbhorhood, Mitchell's Plain.
   The black majority of 28 million was excluded from the Sept. 6
parliamentary elections for whites, Asians and people of mixed-race.
   Rockman, a policeman for 12 years and a crime prevention officer
in the mixed-race township, says he has kept protests peaceful by
allowing demonstrators a suitable length of time to make their point
before ordering them to disperse. But he said riot squad officers
moved in without warning Sept. 5 and gleefully beat protesters at
the Town Center shopping plaza.
   Hundreds of students gathered at the same center today, carrying
placards in praise of Rockman and criticizing emergency detention of
a dozen high school students in the past month.
   After about an hour Rockman appeared on a balcony above a
furniture shop and asked the students to disperse. ``You have made
your point. I don't want you to get hurt. I will see to it that you
dont get hurt. Please go back to your schools,'' he said.
   His address was interrupted frequently by loud applause and
cheers. Before leaving the balcony Rockman said, ``We are going to
show the world that we can be peaceful, and we want to change
through peaceful means in South Africa.''
   The students walked to the nearby police station where Rockman is
assigned, and held their placards for about an hour, then dispersed.
   Col. John Manuel, commander of the Mitchell's Plain police
station, was with Rockman. ``He has my support,'' Manuel said. ``I
have been fighting this thing internally whereas he has fought it
openly.''
   Rockman told journalists he believed his statements had played a
part in persuading authorities to allow the biggest legal
anti-government march ever on Wednesday. After more than 20,000
people marched through Cape Town with no police interference,
Anglican Archbishop Desmond Tutu praised Rockman.
   Rockman has called for a public inquiry into the behavior of riot
squad police. He said he would write a letter today to
President-elect F.W. de Klerk, since Law and Order Minister Adriaan
Vlok had refused to meet with him.
   The Human Rights Commission also sent a letter to de Klerk today,
praising Rockman's ``courageous stand'' and calling for an
independent commission of inquiry into police conduct.

<TEXT>
   Hugo's trek across the Atlantic toward the Caribbean
slowed today, the storm's 75 mph winds just barely qualifying it as
a hurricane.
   At 6 a.m. EDT, Hugo's center was located near 13.0 north latitude
and 48.0 west longitude, or about 900 miles east of the Lesser
Antilles. The storm was moving west at 17 mph, down from 20 mph
Wednesday night.
   Its highest sustained winds were just over the 74 mph hurricane
threshold, but the storm was expected to strengthen, forecasters
said. Hugo was expected to hold its course today.
   ``The threat to the islands is kind of delayed some,'' said
forecaster Gil Clark of the National Hurricane Center in suburban
Coral Gables. ``A lot of our model forecasts indicate it's going to
slow down even more in the next couple of days.''
   Hugo, the eighth named storm of the Atlantic hurricane season,
developed into a hurricane Wednesday evening. Storms are given names
when their sustained winds reach 39 mph, the tropical storm
threshold.
   ``The longer it heads west, the more concern it is to us,'' said
Hal Gerrish, a forecaster at the hurricane center. ``But we're not
sure yet where it will go _ there are too many things that can
happen.''
   The three Atlantic hurricanes before Hugo _ Dean, Erin and
Gabrielle _ turned north into the open Atlantic before reaching the
Caribbean. But last year's killer Hurricane Gilbert remained on the
westward course, socking Mexico and the Caribbean.
   They became storms when sustained winds reached 39 mph, and reach
hurricanes status when winds hit 74 mph.

   An alleged crack dealer has been arrested in the
slaying of a woman who crusaded against drugs in her Brooklyn
neighborhood, and police said they were investigating whether
higher-ups had put out a contract on her.
   The arrest of William Figueroa, 26, came after police made the
case a top priority and after a crackdown on drug dealers got some
of them to talk, police said.
   Figueroa, also known as Willie Bundles, was charged Wednesday
with murder and reckless endangerment in the slaying Aug. 8 of Maria
Hernandez, a 34-year-old mother of three, said Chief of Detectives
Robert Colangelo.
   Mrs. Hernandez was killed as she dressed for work by shots fired
through her bedroom window. She and her husband, Carlos, had tried
to keep drug dealers off their street, and he had received numerous
death threats.
   After seeing news pictures of Figueroa, Hernandez said he
believed the man was a drug dealer with whom he had argued. However,
police said the only drug charges against Figueroa were brought in
Massachusetts.
   Inspector Richard Mayronne described Figueroa as a low-level
crack dealer and said he also apparently had sold heroin. Police
said they were seeking two other people believed to be with Figueroa
when Mrs. Hernandez was killed.
   ``The investigation is continuing to determine whether there was
a broader conspiracy and whether or not some groups, in effect, put
out a contract,'' Colangelo said.
   Colangelo said that whether those firing the shots intended to
kill Mrs. Hernandez or just frighten the couple, ``the result is the
same, an innocent woman dead, fighting drugs.''
   Colangelo said Figueroa has been living in a van on Brooklyn
streets at least since the shooting and that before then he lived in
Springfield, Mass.
   Colangelo said Figueroa had been arrested twice in 1987 for drug
selling and grand larceny, and once in 1988 on a drug charge, all in
Massachusetts. He was sentenced to six months in jail but never
showed up to serve his time.

<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A billion-dollar deal for the world's tallest
building has hit a high hurdle.
   Neither Sears, Roebuck and Co. nor Canadian developer Olympia &amp;
York Developments Ltd. would say Wednesday whether the deal was
dead, but its condition was clearly critical.
   The Chicago Tribune today quoted sources as saying Sears had set
a Friday deadline for any deal with Olympia &amp; York. Sears is
prepared to meet with other parties next week if there is no
agreement, the paper said.
   The roadblock, sources said, is a dispute over which party should
pay the increased property taxes stemming from an expected
re-appraisal of the 110-story, 1,707-foot building after the sale.
   ``There is a major impasse over the tax situation,'' said Kevin
Haggarty, an executive vice president of Cushman &amp; Wakefield, a New
York real estate firm that was advising Olympia &amp; York. ``It's a
serious situation.''
   The Wall Street Journal quoted unidentified sources Tuesday as
saying the parties were prepared to sign an agreement Tuesday for
about $1 billion when the reappraisal issue arose.
   Haggarty said he could not confirm those details.
   Olympia &amp; York confirmed the talks were stalled but would not
elaborate.
   Sears spokesman Douglas Fairweather declined to comment.
   Another sticking point, sources told The Associated Press, was
the difficulty of finding tenants for the 2 million square feet of
office space that Sears will vacate in the 3.7-million-square-foot
building when it moves its retailing division to a new complex in
suburban Hoffman Estates beginning in 1992.
   Olympia &amp; York reportedly considered signing British publisher
Maxwell Communications Corp. as its anchor tenant. But Maxwell has
been eyeing sites in the suburbs, according to a source who
described office space in the 15-year-old tower as ``incredibly
obsolete.''
   Maxwell spokesman David Adler declined comment on the company's
plans.
   Sears had agreed to continue paying rent for six years on the
space it plans to vacate but was unwilling to shoulder any increased
taxes, according to the Journal.
   The nation's biggest retailer announced last October it would
sell the Chicago landmark as part of a corporate restructuring. It
reportedly began serious talks with Olympia &amp; York earlier this
summer.
   At least three other parties reportedly bid for the building,
although Olympia &amp; York has been the only one to confirm its
interest.

   Three men recently discharged from a state
mental hospital have drowned in the past two months, and state
officials have asked for an investigation.
   The body of Joseph C. Thomas, 58, was recovered Tuesday from a
creek after he was reported missing from a boarding home. He had
been discharged from the Philadelphia State Hospital in January as
part of the state's effort to close the outdated, 77-year-old
institution, known as Byberry.
   Two other former Byberry patients, Tyrone Gainey, 37, and Joseph
Gutgesell, 31, drowned last month in the Schuylkill River in
separate incidents. A third patient leaped into the river but
survived.
   State Welfare Secretary John F. White Jr. on Wednesday said he
would ask District Attorney Ron Castille to investigate.
   ``Is it merely a coincidence that these three ... managed to find
their way to water and meet their deaths in the same way?'' White
said. ``There very well may be something else at play here.''
   Gov. Robert P. Casey indefinitely postponed the hospital closing,
which had been scheduled for Sept. 30, after the first two deaths
because of questions over whether the patients discharged can live
on their own.
   White said the latest death further proved the need to review the
closing.
   All three patients had been assigned to treatment teams that were
supposed to watch over them closely as an alternative to
hospitalization, and White said officials were trying to get Gainey
back into a hospital at the time of his death. White would not say
why.
   An autopsy on Thomas showed he drowned, but the circumstances
were listed as undetermined. Gutgesell's death was ruled an
accidental drowning. As of last month, there had been no ruling on
how Gainey drowned.
   Thomas had been living in his own apartment until Friday, when he
was moved into a personal-care boarding home because of heart
problems.

<TEXT>
   A salvage vessel has found the voice recorder
and wreckage of a plane that crashed into the sea north of Denmark,
killing all 55 people on board, officials said today.
   The Norwegian ship first found the tail section of the
twin-engine Convair CV-580 charter plane, then the voice recorder,
which contains a tape of the crew's conversations, said Jon R. Pran,
head of the investigating commission.
   He said the ship, the Bergen Surveyor, still was searching for
the flight recorder, which contains readings from the plane's
technical equipment.
   Officials hope to learn the cause of the crash by studying the
wreckage, the voice recorder, and the flight recorder, if it is
found.
   Norway's NTB news agency reported the bodies of 22 men and nine
women, pulled from the sea after the crash Friday, have been
identified and were to be shipped from Frederikshavn, Denmark, to
Norway today.
   The other 24 passengers and crew members were believed trapped in
the missing fuselage in the muddy seabed under 230 feet of water.
   ``Finding the tail section was a confirmation that we have traced
the wreckage,'' Pran told NTB. ``The fuselage is broken up in
several parts within an area of'' about one square mile.
   NTB said it took 10 hours to lift the tail section from the
seabed. An unmanned mini-submarine sent from the Bergen Surveyor
made contact with eight or nine other pieces assumed to be plane
wreckage, NTB said.
   Experts say metal fatigue in the aging aircraft probably caused
Scandinavia's worst air disaster. The turboprop plane belonged to
the Norwegian charter company Partnair and was en route from Oslo,
Norway, to Hamburg, West Germany, when it plunged into the North Sea.
   Most passengers were Norwegian employees of a shipping line who
had won a company lottery to attend a ship christening in West
Germany.
   The U.S. manufacturer, General Dynamics, made the CV-580 model in
1960 by adding two turboprop engines to the Convair CV-340.

   A Palestinian accused of slaying 16 Jews by
forcing a crowded bus into a ravine pleaded guilty to murder today
but innocent to a separate charge that the crime was premeditated.
   The July 6 bus plunge, in which an American and two Canadian
tourists died along with 13 Israelis, was the worst attack on Jews
during the 21-month-old Palestinian uprising against Israeli
occupation.
   Abdel Hadi Ghanem, 23, from Nusseirat refugee camp in the
occupied Gaza Strip, entered the pleas in Jerusalem District Court.
   Authorities maintain Ghanem acted out of Palestinian nationalism
and rode the bus route repeatedly to find the most dangerous spot to
attack.
   He reportedly told investigators he wanted to avenge the beating
of a friend by soldiers.
   Defense lawyer Jonathan Kuttab brought to court Thursday a
paralyzed Palestinian in a wheelchair, Radwan Abu Shamsah, whose
injury he said motivated Ghanem's attack.
   The court agreed to Kuttab's request for an independent
psychiatrist to examine Ghanem. It postponed the trial for three
months.
   ``We are pleading not guilty as far as the planning and the
intent,'' Kuttab told Israel radio outside the court. ``We are going
to get full evidence later to try and see what in fact motivated him
to do something like this when he was not a politicized person at
all.''
   Police say Ghanem grabbed the steering wheel of a Jerusalem-bound
bus on the main highway from Tel Aviv, forcing it into a deep ravine
as he shouted ``Allahu Akbar!'' a religious call meaning ``God is
great!'' that has become a battle cry of the Palestinian revolt.
   It was reported later that Ghanem may have instead screamed the
name of his friend who was beaten. Kuttab said on Thursday that the
defendant shouted ``Radwan, Radwan'' as he wrenched the steering
wheel from the bus driver.
   Militant Israelis responded to the bus attack by stoning cars
driven by Palestinians. One Palestinian was killed in such an attack
near the Gaza Strip.

   While some Soviet emigres may one day want to
go back to the Soviet Union, the United States will not turn away
any who have already left their country and wish to come here, a
Bush administration official said today.
   Jewel Lafontant, U.S. coordinator for refugees, said reporters
had ``misunderstood'' her comment at a hearing Wednesday that nearly
5,000 Soviet emigres in Italy and Austria who have been denied entry
to the United States can ``always go to Israel or return to Russia.
In these days of glasnost, that's not an impossible thing.''
   All those stranded in Rome and Vienna will be admitted to the
United States, whether as fully funded refugees or as parolees with
private funding, Lafontant said today as she resumed testimony
before the House subcommittees on Europe and on immigration.
   ``Rest assured, they will not be stranded in Europe or forced to
go elsewhere,'' she said.
   Lafonant's comment Wednesday drew immediate criticism from some
in Congress, who said returning to the Soviet Union could subject
emigres to persecution.
   Her remarks reflect the administration's quandary about how to
reconcile the rising tide of Soviet emigres with shrinking U.S.
budgets. For years, U.S. demands that the Soviets allow free Jewish
emigration were a cornerstone of U.S. foreign policy.
   Several congressional committees are holding hearings this week
on the administration's proposal to admit 50,000 Soviets as refugees
in the fiscal year that begins Oct. 1. The allocation announced
Wednesday is part of the overall U.S. refugee allotment of 125,000
worldwide.
   More than 17,000 Soviets are waiting in Italy for permission to
enter the United States, and about 4,700 have been denied refugee
status.
   Today, the administration told Congress it is phasing out refugee
processing centers in Rome and Vienna and beefing up the U.S.
Embassy staff in Moscow to deal with the flood of applications.
   Rep. Bruce Morrison, D-Conn., the immigration subcommittee
chairman, rejected Lafontant's suggestion Wednesday that Jews might
return to the Soviet Union. He said they are still subject to
persecution in the Soviet Union.
   Rep. Hamilton Fish, R-N.Y., said, ``I don't think this is an
appropriate response to someone who's been languishing outside his
country with the expectation of being allowed to come here. You
can't turn around and send them back.''
   While few seriously expect Soviet emigres to return to the Soviet
Union, Lafontant's proposal reflects an increasingly accepted view
that since the United States cannot take in the flood of applicants,
some should consider going to Israel.
   While most Jewish emigres leave on Israeli visas, they opt for
the United States once they reach Vienna or Rome for economic and
cultural reasons.
   Soviet citizens, most of them Jews, are applying to leave their
country for the United States at a rate of about 4,000 a month. This
has created a backlog of about 35,000 applicants in Moscow, and
another 17,000 or more in Italy and Austria.
   If the trend continues, Jewish groups expect at least 72,000
applicants next year and possibly more than 100,000. The
administration knows its proposed slots are insufficient.
   ``With no sign of decline in applications from Soviet citizens
seeking admission to the U.S., we judge that 50,000 is, if anything,
a conservative estimate of the potential admission requirements,''
said Princeton Lyman, the State Department's director of the Office
of Refugee Programs.
   He pledged that top priority would be given those Soviets who
have already applied.
   Jewish groups say this means most of the 50,000 slots will be
taken up with people who have already applied and that new
applicants will mostly have to wait.
   Under the proposed system that will conduct all processing in
Moscow, applicants will have to wait in the Soviet Union, rather
than in Rome or Vienna, at a time when anti-Semitism is rising,
Jewish groups say.
   This raises great concern for the applicants' safety, said Arnold
Leibowitz of the Hebrew Immigrants Aid Society. ``People will be
reluctant to come forward and apply, tell you their tales of
persecution and then wait around for years _ glasnost or not,'' said
the Washington counsel for the organization that helps resettle
Soviet Jews.
   Other Jewish activists worry that at the current rate of denial
for refugee status, which stands at between 20 and 56 percent, many
Soviet Jews will be afraid to apply.
   The denials stem from a change in policy which no longer
automatically grants refugee status to Soviets on the assumption
that they suffer from persecution as a group. Under the new
directive, each applicant must prove a well-founded fear of
persecution.

   Chinese authorities have fired the reformist
governor of Hainan province on graft charges, insisting the move was
part of a campaign against corruption and not politically motivated.
   Also today, an official Chinese newspaper reported that most new
humanities graduate students will have to take a year off to work in
factories or rural areas to improve their ``political
understanding.''
   Hainan Gov. Liang Xiang, who has been linked to purged Communist
Party chief Zhao Ziyang, is the highest-ranking official to be
dismissed in what Beijing calls its campaign to root out corruption
from the leadership.
   His dismissal was announced at a Hainan congress meeting
Wednesday and reported by the official China News Service, which
appeared in Hong Kong today. China's nationally televised evening
news today reported Liu Jianfeng, formerly the provincial deputy
party secretary, was elected as Liang's successor.
   Liang, 70, also was stripped of all Communist Party posts and his
case remains under investigation, the report said.
   Meanwhile, the Hong Kong independent Ming Pao newspaper reported
the arrest in Shanghai of Wang Ruowang, one of China's most
prominent investigative writers who reportedly was active in the
spring pro-democracy movement that the government crushed. An
official with the Shanghai Public Security Bureau, reached by
telephone from Hong Kong, said he had no comment.
   The China Youth News daily said first-year graduate students will
be sent to work in ``grass-roots units'' for ``training.'' The
announcement by the State Education Commission applies to students
studying philosophy, economics, history, law, education and
literature.
   It was the latest effort by the government to increase student
exposure to work programs and political education following the
crackdown in Beijing.
   China's State Council accused Liang of allowing his wife and
children to amass personal wealth and of abusing his power by having
his son settle in Hong Kong, the prosperous British colony on the
south China coast, according to the official account.
   The pro-Beijing Wen Wei Po newspaper of Hong Kong today quoted
the governor's son, Liang Ming, as saying Beijing approved his
coming to Hong Kong and that neither he nor his mother had gone to
Hainan to do business.
   Liang Xiang was appointed governor of the southern island of
Hainan last year after it was elevated to provincial status and made
a special economic zone to attract foreign investment.
   Zhao was a major supporter of the rapid development of Hainan and
is believed to have been instrumental in having Liang appointed the
island's leader.
   Liang also reportedly supported a tolerant stance toward the
island's students participating in the pro-democracy movement, which
the central government accused Zhao of backing.
   Hainan Communist Party Chief Xu Shijie was quoted as telling the
provincial congress Wednesday that Liang's firing was a personal
matter. ``It was not related to factional struggle, and it was not
related to the fall of Zhao Ziyang,'' the China News Service said in
a report on Xu's remarks.
   But a foreign diplomat based in Hong Kong, who spoke on condition
of anonymity, said he thought politics was involved in the firing,
noting that Liang ``has been linked in the past to Zhao Ziyang.''
   The diplomat said the dismissal probably indicated an intent by
the central government to reassert some control over the nation's
southern coastal provinces, which have enjoyed much autonomy while
leading China's economic reform and modernization drive.
   The diplomat said it was unclear how many more dismissals might
follow in the region.
   Liang Xiang was vice mayor and party boss in Canton, then vice
governor of Guangdong province before becoming the head of Shenzhen
in March 1981. He took up his post in Hainan after temporarily
retiring in 1986.
   Wang Ruowang, 71, the Shanghai writer reported under arrest, is
one of modern China's most famed and prolific commentators, noted
for his attacks on the abuses of the party system.
   Ming Pao said Wang only recently was detained but that since the
June 4 military crackdown on the pro-democracy movement, police had
been stationed in front of his house and his telephone bugged.
   Wang had participated in movement demonstrations and complained
to senior leader Deng Xiaoping, the newspaper said.
   He was expelled from the Communist Party in 1987 during the
campaign against anti-bourgeois liberalization, or liberal Western
influences.

   A drug addict convicted of killing Prime
Minister Olof Palme told an appeals court today that he wept when he
read of Palme's death and denied he shot the popular Swedish leader.
   ``Nothing of what will be said here can make me into Olof Palme's
killer,'' said Christer Pettersson. ``It can only make me a suspect
for the killing, but never into the killer,'' he said during two
hours of questioning.
   The 42-year-old Swede with a long criminal record was convicted
by a lower court on July 27 of slaying the four-term premier in 1986
as he walked home from a movie with his wife, Lisbeth.
   Pettersson appealed the conviction and life sentence imposed by
the district court. The prosecution made a counter-appeal, seeking
to upgrade a second charge from endangering Mrs. Palme to attempted
murder.
   Pettersson said he learned of Palme's death from a newspaper the
day after the Feb. 28 killing.
   ``I get the paper. I see a picture of Olof Palme and read the
headline, `Olof Palme Killed.' I think `my God,' and go into the
kitchen and sit down. I am so sad that I shed a tear _ no, I shed
several tears,'' he told the court.
   ``I really liked and admired that man. I always have done,'' he
said, adding that he voted for Palme's Social Democrats every time
but once.
   Pettersson, who has a previous manslaughter conviction and has
undergone court-ordered psychiatric treatment, said he did not hate
Palme or anyone else. ``Hate blinds you. I have a short temper, but
I have never felt hatred,'' he said.
   Prosecutors have suggested Pettersson loathes authority and
offered this alleged hatred as a motive for the killing.
   The convicted man admitted he threatened or assaulted drug
dealers about 600 times to steal amphetamines during a six-year
period in the 1970s when he was not in jail or a psychiatric
institution.
   But he said he never used a gun, never attacked anyone from the
back, and was violent ``only in acute situations.''
   Repeating his alibi, Pettersson said he came into Stockholm from
his suburban home to get amphetamines and went to a gambling club
before catching a 10:46 p.m. commuter train home. He fell asleep and
missed his station, but still returned to his apartment by midnight,
he said. Palme was shot at 11:21 p.m.
   During the lower-court trial, Mrs. Palme identified Pettersson as
the man she saw standing a few feet away immediately after the
shooting, when her husband fell to the ground fatally wounded by a
shot in the back. She saw no gun, and the murder weapon never was
found.
   The six laymen on the eight-member jury voted Pettersson guilty
on the basis of Mrs. Palme's testimony. Two professional judges on
the jury voted for acquittal, citing lack of forensic evidence.
   The Svea Court of Appeals, consisting of four judges and three
laymen, is expected to conclude Pettersson's case on Oct. 9.

   Lincoln Kirstein, who persuaded master
choreographer George Balanchine to come to America and establish a
ballet school here 55 years ago, is retiring.
   The 82-year-old director of the New York City Ballet and its
affiliated School of American Ballet said he would step down Nov. 1.
   Kirstein and Balanchine, who died six years ago, founded the
school in 1934 after Kirstein got Balanchine to move from Europe.
The dance company was begun in 1946.
   Kirstein is a writer on cultural topics as well as a novelist and
a poet, and has tried recently to devote more time to writing.
   Choreographer Jerome Robbins, co-artistic director of the ballet
company, called Kirstein ``an essential pillar in the life of the
community.''
   ``I received notice of this with utter dismay and sorrow, and I'm
very upset,'' he said.
   The other co-artistic director, Peter Martins, said ``Lincoln may
want to leave his desk at the school, but like George Balanchine, he
can never really be absent.''

<TEXT>
   F.W. de Klerk was elected today to
a five-year term as president and pledged to ensure that the
voteless black majority ``becomes part of the decision-making
process.''
   The Electoral College, dominated by Parliament members of the
governing National Party, cast a unanimous vote for de Klerk a day
after the largest legal protest march in South Africa's history took
place with his approval.
   The brief meeting of the electors took place in a parliamentary
chamber near St. George's Cathedral, starting point for Wednesday's
march by more than 20,000 people.
   Accepting the outcome of the vote, de Klerk described the next
five years as a decisive period and promised to be a leader for all
South Africans, not just the white voters who kept the National
Party in control of Parliament in elections last week.
   ``We are committed to lead South Africa through peaceful means to
a new dispensation,'' he said. ``It will be a tremendous privilege
to lead this country to this goal.''
   De Klerk, 53, has served as acting president since Aug. 15, a day
after he and other Cabinet ministers pressured P.W. Botha into
resigning after 11 years in power. De Klerk is to be inaugurated
Wednesday in Pretoria. He is expected to expand on the brief remarks
he made today in a major inauguration speech.
   In the past four weeks, de Klerk has pledged repeatedly to seek a
``new South Africa'' in which racial tensions will be defused and
the disenfranchised black majority will receive some form of
political rights.
   Black leaders have received his proposals with skepticism, but de
Klerk depicted his approval of the protest march in Cape Town as
proof of his sincerity. A wide range of commentators today commended
his decision.
   The Sowetan, the country's largest black-oriented daily
newspaper, said de Klerk ``scored a public relations coup.'' It said
the lives of hundreds of black protesters could have been saved if
previous white rulers ``had thought as de Klerk thought.''
   Beeld, a pro-government newspaper, said de Klerk ``took a
big-hearted and meaningful step'' by allowing the march. It said the
government ``has shown radical groups in South Africa _ and the
whole world _ that its door really is open to discussions over
reform.''
   De Klerk was harshly criticized by the far-right Conservative
Party, which sought an urgent debate in Parliament to discuss the
security situation. A Conservative spokesman, Moolman Mentz, said
approval of the march was ``a knife thrust in the back'' of the
security forces.
   Police stayed out of sight as marchers followed Anglican
Archbishop Desmond Tutu and Cape Town Mayor Gordon Oliver from St.
George's Cathedral to City Hall. Two weeks earlier, police broke up
protest marches in Cape Town with whips, batons and a water cannon
that sprayed purple water.
   The main reason for the march was to denounce police violence
against protesters during a 6-week-old campaign to defy apartheid.
   Activists say police were responsible for the deaths of at least
23 people in Cape Town's black and mixed-race townships during
protests of the Sept. 6 elections, which excluded blacks.
   Their claims were supported by Lt. Gregory Rockman, a mixed-race
policeman who accused white police officers of brutally suppressing
an election protest in his neighborhood of Mitchell's Plain.
   Today, Rockman, who has become a folk hero in the townships,
peacefully dispersed a demonstration in Mitchell's Plain in his
honor.
   The government originally rejected the activists' accounts of the
violence and death toll, but police now say they know of 19 unrest
deaths in the area on election night, including nine in which police
may have been responsible.
   The Cape Times said de Klerk's decision to allow the march was
``statesmanlike, overriding the conventional wisdom of the security
establishment and demonstrating a cool ability to act quickly and
sensibly under pressure.''
   ``It seems the de Klerk era may be different,'' the Cape Town
newspaper said. ``Let's hope so.''

   A state trooper stopped a car for
speeding and found 350 pounds of cocaine valued at $17 million
behind panels in the trunk and under the seats, a spokesman said.
   Two men, believed to be from Chile, were arrested after the stop
Wednesday. Lt. Ronnie Jones said they would be booked later.
   Sgt. Jim McKenzie said the trooper was on his way to a police
crime lab at the time. ``He wasn't even on patrol,'' McKenzie said.
   The car was going about 75 mph on an interstate highway when it
passed the trooper, who was in a car without complete police
markings, he said.
   ``As he was writing out the ticket, certain things came to light
... and he followed the scent,'' McKenzie said. ``It's just one of
those things that happens in a trooper's life.''
   The seizure was the second largest in State Police history,
exceeded only by a 700-pound discovery near Monroe a year ago, Jones
said.

<TEXT>
   East German refugees streamed across the
Hungarian-Austrian border today after a three-day lull, apparently
spurred by fears that Budapest may slam the door shut to the West.
   Austria's Interior Ministry in Vienna reported that 100 East
Germans were arriving at the border each hour.
   West German border authorities said more than 700 new refugees
arrived overnight.
   On Wednesday, Hungary's deputy foreign minister, Ferenc Somogyi,
said his country will grant East Germans unfettered passage to the
West only temporarily. He did not elaborate.
   Hungary has not made clear how long it will allow East Germans to
leave for West Germany without permission from East Berlin.
   Austrian officials said the number had exceeded 13,150 by midday
today. Aid workers in Budapest said another 500 East Germans were
waiting for passage westward from international aid camps in Hungary.
   Somogyi said in an interview on Wednesday that Hungary will
renegotiate agreements with its Warsaw Pact allies restricting
travel to the West by East bloc citizens, to reflect its new
commitment to the rights of refugees.
   But Budapest will only allow citizens from other East bloc
nations to cross its border with Austria if it determines they are
refugees under U.N. guidelines, Somogyi said.
   The official MTI news agency reported a second day of talks in
East Berlin between a senior Hungarian Communist Party official,
Maria Ormos, and an East German Politburo member in charge of
ideology, Kurt Hager.
   MTI described the talks as ``friendly and open'' but made clear
that the two Warsaw Pact allies remain far apart over Hungary's role
in the exodus.
   In Berlin, the East German Communist Party daily, Neues
Deutschland, called the meeting ``businesslike and open.'' It also
made no critical remarks about the Budapest government for the first
time since the refugee wave began, suggesting some mending of the
rift created by the affair.
   Somogyi insisted Wednesday that the East Germans ``were not
refugees, and they did not request asylum as refugees,'' because
West Germany grants citizenship on request to any East Germans.
   In West Germany, officials said Wednesday that refugee camps were
emptying quickly as thousands left to join West German relatives and
look for jobs.
   East Germany has bitterly accused its Warsaw Pact ally of
breaking an agreement and undermining its sovereignty by allowing
East Germans to flee to the West.
   Hungary's official MTI news agency carried a terse note Wednesday
night from the Foreign Ministry, promising to ``extensively
contradict'' accusations contained in a formal protest by the East
German government.
   The rebuttal would come soon, the ministry said without
elaboration.
   Hungary's role illustrates the dramatic changes sweeping Eastern
Europe, especially in Poland and Hungary. Poland is the first Warsaw
Pact nation to install a government led by non-Communists, while
Hungary's reformist Communist leadership has promised free elections
by June.
   A Polish Foreign Ministry spokesman today confirmed there were
East German refugees holed up in the West German Embassy in Warsaw.
About 50 East Germans were in the embassy, Polish television
reported.
   The Vatican newspaper today praised Hungary for permitting the
exodus and lauded its recently introduced political and social
reforms in Hungary.
   Hungary began removing barbed wire and other barriers from its
westernmost border in May, permitting more than 6,000 East Germans
to escape over it.
   It then allowed thousands more to flee beginning Sunday after
thousands of East German crammed makeshift camps to wait for passage
to West Germany. They said they were tired of political repression
and economic stagnation in their country, one of the most rigidly
controlled in the Communist world.
   To resolve the crisis, Hungary suspended a 1969 accord with East
Germany agreeing no East Germans could leave for the West from
Hungary without East Berlin's permission.
   Somogyi said similar agreements with other Warsaw Pact countries
``are no longer in line with our newly assumed international
responsibilities, such as our having signed the Geneva Convention on
refugees.
   ``We are working to bring these various agreements into harmony
with the new foreign policy of our country,'' he said.
   As part of its reforms, Hungary became the first Soviet bloc
nation to join the U.N. convention on the rights of refugees.
   It has accepted about 17,000 fleeing Hungarian ethnics from
Romania and Hungarian officials acknowledge that tensions over the
situation contributed to its decision to join the U.N. convention.

   The success of strategic arms reduction talks
with the Soviet Union will hang in the balance during the next month
as congressional conferees draw up military spending plans for next
year, the chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee said today.
   Sen. Sam Nunn, D-Ga., said the vast differences between the House
and Senate over U.S. strategic programs must be negotiated into a
consensus if the strategic arms reduction talks (START) are to
succeed.
   ``I think the START talks are at stake in the next 30 days,''
Nunn said in a breakfast speech at the U.S. Chamber of Commerce.
   ``If we do not come out with a sensible strategic nuclear program
that the president himself has confidence in and the Joint Chiefs
(of Staff) have confidence in, START talks are going to be a long,
long time coming,'' he said.
   The House cut $502 million from the $1.1 billion President Bush
had sought for the rail-based MX nuclear missile system and
eliminated all $100 million the president had sought for the
Midgetman nuclear missile program.
   The Senate endorsed Bush's request in both missile programs, and
Nunn argued today that Congress must give Bush ``the tools to do the
job'' in the arms negotiations in Geneva.
   ``If we are going to have any kind of successful outcome in arms
control ... we've got to have consensus at home,'' Nunn said. ``If
we don't develop consensus at home, we're not going to be able to
develop one with the Soviets.''
   In a separate area, Nunn said the United States should provide
whatever military assistance is requested by the government of
Colombia in its war against drug cartels.
   ``My view is the government of Colombia is not going ask the U.S.
to come in and fight all their battles with military forces,'' he
said. ``They have a very large military force ....''
   ``I think they can handle it if we give them help, equipment,
assistance and training,'' he said. ``I would view us primarily in
that role. If they want further help, then we should consider it
very carefully.''
   For the long-term, Nunn said he favors Jamaican Prime Minister
Michael Manley's proposal for the creation of an inter-American drug
squad ``where the U.S. would participate but not be the only
participant.''

   Educators are voicing high hopes for President
Bush's education summit with the nation's governors, but warn of ``a
tremendous letdown'' if the politicians fail to find ways to improve
America's schools.
   Bush on Wednesday held the first of several ``listening
sessions'' with education leaders leading up to his Sept. 27-28
summit with the governors in Charlottesville, Va.
   The educators, who are being excluded from the summit itself,
said afterward they urged Bush to use the conference to help forge a
new national consensus on what children should learn.
   The White House indicated that is, in fact, what Bush has in mind.
   Bush wants the governors ``to help develop a set of realistic
goals for the nation in education,'' said spokesman Marlin Fitzwater.
   But Fitzwater said that Bush is likely to propose such goals, not
at the summit's end, but at a later date.
   Responding to reports that some governors are upset the summit
working sessions will be closed, Fitzwater said today the governors
told the White House they wanted it that way ``so they were free to
tell (the president) what they really thought.''
   ``The only sessions that are closed are the working sessions and
I think they prefer them that way,'' he said.
   He promised ample media access to the plenary sessions and
``press conferences back-to-back every minute of the morning.''
   American Federation of Teachers President Albert Shanker, one of
17 education leaders at the brainstorming session with Bush and
Secretary of Education Lauro F. Cavazos, warned afterward:
   ``There will be a tremendous letdown if the summit takes place
and turns out to be a mere media event and doesn't come up with
anything that's substantive.''
   Keith Geiger, his counterpart at the National Education
Association, said, ``I don't think any of us are looking for another
report.''
   Geiger called it an ``excellent ... freewheeling discussion,''
and said the educators' overriding message ``was that the president
could lead in a national role of setting (educational) goals for
this country.''
   That could include spelling out what ``youngsters need to know in
order to graduate from high school,'' he added.
   Shanker said Washington doesn't need to establish a national
curriculum, but must do something about the paucity of graduates
able to read and write at advanced levels.
   Earlier, Fitzwater told reporters, ``The president believes that
the nation's education system needs more accountability in terms of
student achievement. He will suggest the need for a results-oriented
education system and ask the governors for their ideas to make
education meet those goals in a more effective manner.''
   Cavazos noted that many governors were holding their own
pre-summit meetings to canvass experts for advice, and he emphasized
that the Charlottesville meeting was ``only a start.''
   ``It's the beginning ... of an opening dialogue, not only with
the governors, but with all of the people, with the teachers, with
the educators, with the students, parents,'' said Cavazos.
   Bush campaigned on a pledge to be ``the education president.''
Cavazos said the administration's aim is to move education ``back to
the forefront'' of national attention.
   Cavazos has complained that school reform has produced only
meager improvements. ``Everyone in that room knows what it takes.
... The fundamental question is why hasn't it happened,'' he said.
   Meanwhile, the National Governors Association held a daylong
hearing to allow educators, business leaders and others to offer
ideas for the summit.
   Arkansas Gov. Bill Clinton said that by convening the summit,
Bush is going to have to ``assume some personal responsibility for
the future of the quality of education.''
   ``Once you pick up this ball, you pretty well got to run with it.
If you try to put it down after the summit's over, then I think you
have dashed expectations, disappointed people, a divided country,
people disoriented,'' said Clinton, a Democrat.
   South Carolina Gov. Carroll Campbell said, ``I don't think that
we have any magical cure but I do think that when we finish this
process of pouring all the thought and ideas into the funnel, that
at the other end we will be able to come out with a little clearer
focus of where we want to go as a nation, and in the states.''

   A small bomb shattered the window of a York
bookstore owned by the publisher of Salman Rushdie's novel ``The
Satanic Verses,'' and bombs were found at three of the publisher's
stores in other towns, police say.
   The Viking Penguin bookstore in the center of this northern city
was closed Wednesday night when the blast occurred, causing minor
damage and no injuries, police said.
   In Holland, four teen-age students were arrested for threatening
to bomb stores belonging to a retail chain if it did not stop
stocking the controversial novel, which many Moslems consider
blasphemous.
   York city police Inspector Ron Johnson said the bomb at the
Penguin bookstore was spotted by a member of the public and the area
was evacuated. He said it exploded before an army bomb squad could
arrive.
   Three other bombs found outside Penguin bookstores in three other
cities and towns were defused or otherwise made safe before they
could explode.
   No group claimed responsibility for planting the bombs in York,
in Guildford 30 miles southwest of London, in Nottingham in central
England and in Peterborough 75 miles north of London.
   But the British Broadcasting Corp. said in a radio news bulletin
that it seemed likely the bombs were the latest in a series of
attacks by Moslem extremists angered by Rushdie's novel.
   The BBC reported that the bomb found in Nottingham, made from a
length of metal pipe filled with explosives, seemed almost identical
to one that exploded outside a store in central London earlier this
month.
   In Amsterdam, Dutch police today reported the arrest of four
schoolboys for threatening to attack a prominent department store
chain unless it removed ``The Satanic Verses'' from its shelves.
   The four, aged 17 and 18, confessed to mailing an Aug. 31 letter
threatening the Vroom and Dreesman chain, the retail branch of the
Dutch trade and retail conglomerate Vendex International, according
to Amsterdam police spokesman Klaas Wilting.
   In response to the threat, Vroom and Dreesman withdrew Dutch and
English versions of the novel from its 60 department stores around
the nation.
   The four schoolboys called themselves ``Followers of the
Revolutionary Justice Organization,'' Wilting said.
   ``It all began as kind of hoax ... but they never realized this
could be the effect,'' he said.
   The four, who were not identified in line with Dutch police
practice, were charged with threatening the use of force, he said.
   Rushdie has been in hiding since Feb. 14, when Ayatollah Ruhollah
Khomeini, Iran's former spiritual leader, called on Moslems to kill
him, and Moslem clerics placed a multimillion dollar bounty on the
author's head.
   Rushdie is an Indian-born naturalized British citizen based in
London.

   Barring a last-minute hitch, the United States
and the Soviet Union will announce next week a landmark agreement to
disclose their stockpiles of chemical weapons and permit inspection
of their production facilities.
   The emerging accord extends the principle of verification
established in a 1987 U.S.-Soviet treaty to scrap all nuclear
missiles with a range of 300 to 3,400 miles.
   But the United States must first gain the cooperation of West
Germany, on whose territory some U.S. chemical weapons are stored,
U.S. officials said Wednesday.
   Secretary of State James A. Baker III and Soviet Foreign Minister
Eduard A. Shevardnadze would sign the agreement at their Sept. 22-23
meeting in Jackson Hole, Wyo., while making preparations for a
superpower summit.
   President Bush will see Shevardnadze in Washington on Sept. 21,
White House press secretary Marlin Fitzwater said.
   ``The president would want to reassure him on support for the
reforms in the Soviet Union and make sure there's no
misunderstanding about our intention to move as fast as we can on
arms control,'' Fitzwater said.
   He said it was uncertain whether the Baker-Shevardnadze meeting
would produce a date for a summit between Bush and Soviet President
Mikhail Gorbachev.
   U.S. officials, who disclosed the latest arms control moves, said
final details first must be ironed out by U.S. and Soviet experts.
   They will meet here next Monday and Tuesday and try to determine
exactly how much information is to be exchanged under the agreement.
   ``We are close,'' one official said.
   The other key provision calls for short-notice inspection of each
other's stockpiles and plants. It is designed as a model for an
international treaty now under negotiation by 40 nations in Geneva.
   The major sticking point in completing that accord is that the
United States believes the Soviet Union has more chemical weapons
than it is willing to acknowledge.
   ``We don't believe the Soviets, but we don't know how to find out
how many more they have,'' an official said. ``It's very difficult.''
   But he said the U.S.-Soviet memorandum is designed to serve as a
``confidence-building'' measure that could improve prospects for a
40-nation treaty.
   The two superpowers, the only countries to admit possessing
chemical weapons, began their negotiations four years ago and have
had 12 rounds of talks in Geneva.
   Besides the imminent accord, they recently agreed on two
provisions that could be part of the 40-nation treaty, the official
said.
   One sets the procedures for destroying chemical weapons and the
other for conducting inspections at suspect sites.
   The two sides would reduce their arsenals to equal levels over
eight years, with the aim of eliminating the remaining weapons later
on.
   Only this week Shevardnadze accused the Bush administration of
``timidity'' and failing to take full advantage of arms control
channels opened by former President Ronald Reagan and Soviet leader
Mikhail S. Gorbachev.
   Administration spokesmen rejected the allegations and cited
Bush's proposal in the spring for wholesale reductions in NATO and
Warsaw Pact troops and non-nuclear armories in Europe.
   Some 20 nations are believed to either possess chemical weapons
or the capability to manufacture them. The danger they might be used
is considered by many analysts to at least equal the threat of
nuclear war.
   One of the main worries is that chemical weapons smaller even
than a pack of cigarettes could be concealed by a terrorist and used
for political extortion or set off in a violent rampage.
   Describing verification of chemical weapons as even more
difficult than keeping track of nuclear arms, an official said
``many of these weapons are small and can be produced in a small
room, but the agreement would help us along'' the path to a treaty.
   Also on Baker and Shevardnadze's agenda is preparing for
President Bush's first summit meeting with Soviet President Mikhail
S. Gorbachev.
   The two superpowers in 1987 signed an unprecedented treaty to
eliminate all their intermediate-range nuclear missiles. It featured
the first-ever program for reciprocal inspection of bases where the
missiles are deployed as well as manufacturing plants.
   It apparently has worked without a hitch and set the two sides on
a path for cooperating on the chemical weapons treaty.

   The Justice Department announced today it is
seeking the extradition from Colombia of Bernardo Pelaez Roldan, an
alleged associate of the Medellin drug cartel convicted of drug
trafficking charges five years ago in Detroit.
   ``We are seeking his extradition,'' said Justice spokesman David
Runkel. ``The papers have gone down'' to Colombia.
   Pelaez Roldan, identified as an associate of the Medellin cartel
that is one of the world's largest cocaine trafficking
organizations, faces a 15-year sentence in the Detroit case, said
Frank Shults of the Drug Enforcement Administration.
   In addition to the extradition papers, the United States also has
sent to Colombia a request for Pelaez Roldan's provisional arrest,
which would allow the Colombian government to keep him in custody
until the extradition proceedings are completed, Shults said.
   Pelaez Roldan was indicted in November 1983 on federal charges of
conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute cocaine, Runkel
said. He was arrested in Florida and taken before a U.S. magistrate
in Detroit in January 1984, and the trial was set to begin that
March.
   He was released on bond and ``never seen again,'' said Runkel,
who added that he did not know how much the bond was.
   Tried in absentia, Pelaez Roldan was convicted in April 1984 and
sentenced to 15 years in prison, Shults said. A warrant for his
arrest was issued in May 1984, Runkel said.
   The United States sought his extradition from Colombia, and the
government there granted that request in March 1986. However, Pelaez
Roldan was not in custody, and the Colombian Supreme Court threw out
the extradition treaty in 1987.
   Under emergency measures imposed by Colombian President Virgilio
Barco following the Aug. 18 assassination of leading presidential
candidate Luis Carlos Galan, extraditions to the United States were
resumed.
   The only person sent to the United States under the newly
reinstituted agreement is Eduardo Martinez Romero, who faces
money-laundering and drug-trafficking charges in Atlanta.
   The Washington Post reported today that Colombian Gen. Miguel
Maza Marquez, director of the Administrative Security Department,
described Pelaez Roldan as ``the most important person yet taken
into custody.'' A DAS spokesman for the Administrative Security
Department said he was ``one of the biggest money launderers in
Colombia, much bigger that Martinez Romero,'' and the general
agreed, the Post said.
   However, Pelaez Roldan faces no money-laundering charges in the
United States, Runkel said.

   Mother Teresa had chest pains and
developed a high fever today, a week after she suffered a heart
attack, her doctors said.
   Dr. A.K. Ashim, chief cardiologist at Woodlands Nursing Home,
said the 79-year-old Roman Catholic nun ``has had sort of a (second)
heart attack.''
   Mother Teresa, who has devoted her life to helping the poor, was
admitted to the nursing home on Sept. 5. ``Her condition is
serious,'' Ashim said. ``She suffered chest pains during the night
which required intensive measures to relieve. These measures are
continuing.''
   He said doctors were constantly monitoring her heartbeat but
refused to say what steps had been taken. ``Mother Teresa is tired
and resting,'' he said.
   He called the overnight pains ``a setback.''
   A nun at the Missionaries of Charity, the order founded by Mother
Teresa nearly 40 years ago in Calcutta's squalid slums, said doctors
seemed anxious about her condition.
   ``She's not well,'' said the nun, who asked not to be identified.
   Mother Teresa suffered a heart attack on Sept. 8, three days
after she was admitted to Woodlands Hospital with a high fever, an
irregular heartbeat and blocked artery.
   Doctors attached a temporary pacemaker after the heart attack,
and they said her condition had been improving since then.
   Born in Yugoslavia, the soft-spoken nun become known for her work
with the poor and won dozens of honors, including the 1979 Nobel
Peace Prize.
   She founded the Missionaries of Charity in October 1950 in an
abandoned, rundown hostel donated by the city. The order, recognized
by the Vatican in 1965, now has 3,000 nuns working in 87 countries.

   Former state Senate President Dan
Tonkovich pleaded guilty today to taking a $5,000 payoff from a
casino company to help get a bill legalizing gambling passed.
   The surprise plea was announced by U.S. Attorney Michael Carey on
the sixth day of Tonkovich's trial.
   Since July, West Virginia's treasurer, attorney general, a former
Senate majority leader and Tonkovich's successor as Senate president
have also either resigned, pleaded guilty or agreed to plead guilty
in various investigations.
   The 16-year legislator had been charged with three counts of
extortion, two of attempted extortion and one of racketeering.
   He pleaded guilty to one count of extortion carrying up to 20
years in prison and $250,000 in fines. A conviction on all counts
could have brought the Democrat from Benwood 120 years in prison and
$1.5 million in fines.
   Sentencing was set for Nov. 16.
   A teary-eyed Tonkovich walked out of the courtroom with his wife
after the announcement and declined to comment.
   Tonkovich was indicted on three counts of extorting $5,000 each
from the West Virginia Casino Co. to help win passage of a bill that
would have allowed casino gambling in West Virginia. It never passed.
   After he was indicted, Tonkovich admitted he took the money but
said he thought it was for polling work to be done his public
relations firm.
   He said he eventually returned the money because the casino
company never followed up on its original request for polling work
and because of editorial criticism about his business dealings.
   One of the attempted extortion counts alleged that Tonkovich
tried to sell his influence on the gambling bill to Resorts
International Inc. in 1986. The other attempted extortion count
charged that Tonkovich promised to fix insurance-industry
legislation in 1988 in return for political donations.
   The racketeering count alleged that Tonkovich used his office as
a criminal enterprise by selling his influence.
   Tonkovich was elected to the House in 1972 and the Senate in
1976, serving as Senate president from 1984 to 1988. He did not seek
re-election in 1988 to seek the Democratic nomination for governor.
He lost to now-Gov. Gaston Caperton.
   Three people testified against Tonkovich after pleading guilty to
tax charges: former administrative assistant Robert Cain, former
Senate Majority Leader Si Boettner, and insurance lobbyist Bonnie
Wymer.
   Former state Senate President Larry Tucker was the lead defense
witness. He resigned Sept. 8 after agreeing to plead guilty to
extortion.
   In July, state Treasurer A. James Manchin resigned over $270
million in investment losses, averting a Senate impeachment trial.
Attorney General Charlie Brown quit Aug. 21, averting a federal
grand jury investigation of campaign finances and allegations he
lied during a child custody hearing.

<HEAD>Virgin Islands Woman Says She Saw D.C. Mayor With Cocaine</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A legal secretary who reportedly told FBI
agents she saw District of Columbia Mayor Marion Barry in a U.S.
Virgin Islands hotel room with what she believed was a large
quantity of cocaine testified today before a federal grand jury.
   Dixie Lee Hedrington was before the grand jury for about an hour
before the panel recessed for lunch. Prosecutors and witnesses
refused to discuss the proceedings.
   The grand jury is investigating contentions by a convicted drug
offender that he smoked crack cocaine with Barry, an allegation
Barry denies.
   The Washington Post, citing unamed sources, reported in today's
editions that Ms. Hedrington told the FBI that someone offered her
cocaine in the St. Thomas hotel room where she saw Barry in March
1988, but she declined.
   Barry has consistently denied using illegal drugs and has accused
the newspaper of being out to get him. He also said he did not
recognize Ms. Hedrington's name.
   ``This is part of a continuing witch hunt by The Washington Post,
an attempt to frame me, an attempt to run me out of office,'' Barry
told the newspaper after being asked about Ms. Hedrington. ``The
Post intends to run a story a day of unsubstantiated charges.''
   Ms. Hedrington and her attorney, former Virgin Islands Lt. Gov.
Julio Brady, were met by FBI agents Wednesday at Washington National
Airport and whisked away, the Post said.
   Ms. Hedrington is one of several women named by Charles Lewis, a
former Virgin Islands government official, as potential witnesses
against the mayor, the sources told the newspaper.
   Lewis, a onetime friend of Barry's, has been convicted on drug
charges in the Virgin Islands and is awaiting trial in Washington on
perjury and cocaine charges.
   Lewis has told federal authorities that he and Barry smoked crack
in a Washington hotel and that they used cocaine in the Virgin
Islands, several news media have reported. Lewis' trial, scheduled
to start Sept. 18, was postponed indefinitely last week, after a
prosecutor told a judge there may be ``another disposition'' to the
case.

   Congressional Democrats squabbled among
themselves today over how to finance their proposal for a $2.2
billion increase in President Bush's anti-drug program.
   House Democrats emerging from a leadership meeting said they
oppose the plan of Sen. Robert C. Byrd, D-W.Va., the Senate
Appropriations Committee chairman, to get the added money through a
half-percent across-the-board cut in all federal programs.
   ``We will not accept that option offered by Senator Byrd,'' said
Rep. Charles Rangel, D-N.Y., chairman of the House Select Commmittee
on Narcotics Abuse and Control. He said the plan would eviscerate
domestic programs that ``already have been cut to the bone.''
   Rangel said House Democratic leaders would instead seek to find
savings in other areas _ likely to be defense programs.
   ``My constituents believe the drug war is more important than,
say, the mission to Mars or a couple of extra stealth bombers,''
added Rep. Ron Wyden, D-Ore.
   On the Senate side of the Capitol, Democrats said Wednesday they
would seek to work with Republicans toward a compromise anti-drug
program.
   ``The president's plan is wholly inadequate,'' said Majority
Leader George Mitchell, D-Maine, adding that the White House is
failing in its effort to paint the Democrats as big taxers and
spenders for wanting to do more.
   The Democrats, who hold a 55-45 majority in the Senate, united
Wednesday behind Byrd's proposal to expand Bush's $7.9 billion drug
program by $2.2 billion, with more money for drug education and
treatment programs.
   Mitchell contended the White House's quick threat of a veto for
the Democratic plan, and its claim that Democrats just want to raise
taxes, show that the administration knows its plan is in trouble.
   But William Bennett, the president's point man on drugs, defended
the administration plan as ``our best assessment'' of what is needed.
   The administration, after the chest-thumping earlier in the week
on the issue, was noticeably more subdued, working with Senate
Republican leader Bob Dole of Kansas to set up talks with the
Democrats.
   Instead of raising taxes, Byrd's plan would pay for the extra
spending by cutting other programs across-the-board by about
one-half of one percent.
   ``If we can't find that (cut) in everybody's department, we're
not serious about fighting the war on drugs,'' said Rep. John
Breaux, D-La., chairman of the Democratic Senatorial Campaign
Committee.
   While they hold a majority in the Senate, Democrats would need
Republican votes to push any plan past GOP opposition. Mitchell
announced Wednesday that he and Dole would each appoint negotiating
teams and the Democrats would hold back their plan as long as the
talks were progressing.
   Despite the veto threat, the White House has made overtures to
the Democrats to seek a compromise.
   ``My own view is that the Bush plan does not need any changes,
but if there are good suggestions and if we get some agreement
between the president and Congress, then obviously that is fine,''
said Dole.
   Bush held a ceremony to honor a Los Angeles-based anti-drug
program called DARE _ Drug Abuse Resistance Education _ and found
himself being lectured by a 13-year-old about his support of the
death penalty.
   ``To me, killing someone that has committed a very serious crime
is wrong,'' said Chantee Charles, a seventh grader from nearby
Arlington, Va., said at the Rose Garden event. ``It does not solve
anything. All it does is take someone else's life.''
   Bush complimented Chantee and two other students invited to speak
for doing a good job expressing ``what's on your heart'' without
worrying ``if people agree with you or not.''
   Bush has advocated the death penalty for drug kingpins and for
those who kill law enforcement officers.
   Also on Wednesday, a former worker in a Colombian drug cartel
warned a Senate subcommittee that embattled South American drug
dealers might lash out with terror attacks in the United States.
   ``Some of you may be the victims of attacks and maybe the
president of the United States would be the victim of drug
traffickers,'' Diego Viafara Salinas told the permanent subcommittee
on investigations. He testified behind a screen to shield his
identity while bodyguards scanned the hearing room.
   Another witness testifying from behind a screen, David Wheeler,
the Washington-born son of a U.S. Foreign Service officer, said
wealthy Bolivians have a cocaine cartel that rivals those of
Colombia.

<BYLINE>By GREG MYRE</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WINDHOEK, Nambia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Sam Nujoma, leader of the SWAPO guerrilla
movement, received a hero's welcome today as he ended 30 years in
exile to compete for political power in soon-to-be-independent
Namibia.
   Tight security measures were in force because of threats on
Nujoma's life and the assassination Tuesday of Anton Lubowski, the
only white with a leadership post in the South-West Africa People's
Organization.
   ``We return in the spirit of peace, love and national
reconciliation,'' Nujoma told a news conference at his new home in
Katatura, the black township on the outskirts of Windhoek.
   ``No words may express my happiness at joining my family, friends
and comrades,'' he said. ``The years spent abroad have at times been
characterized by loneliness. At other times there was great
happiness when we achieved successes. ``We never lost sight of our
principal objective _ freedom and independence for Namibia.''
   The 60-year-old nationalist kissed the tarmac at Windhoek's
airport, embraced SWAPO colleagues and his 89-year-old mother.
   Thousands of cheering supporters, kept out of the terminal by
police, gathered at the airport gates to greet Nujoma, who reached
out of the car, wavingand shaking hands. Most wore the red, blue and
green colors of the independence movement.
   Black trade unions urged their members to skip work in order to
join in welcoming Nujoma, who arrived aboard an Ethiopian Airlines
jet after a flight from Luanda, Angola.
   Trucks and buses loaded with cheering supporters, waving banners
and raising clenched fists, followed the car through Windhoek to
Katatura. People on the street joined in the cheers, while others
jeered and raised their fists in obscene gestures as the motorcade
passed.
   Earlier today, police announced the arrest of a suspect in the
assassination of Lubowski. Police Inspector Kierie du Rand said the
suspect was a 50-year-old white man with an Irish passport, arrested
in Windhoek on Wednesday. He reportedly came to Namibia from Cape
Town, South Africa.
   His name was not released, and du Rand said additional arrests
were expected. The South African Press Association said police were
investigating a possible link with the Irish Republican Army, but
did not elaborate.
   Lubowski, 37, was killed by automatic rifle fire outside his
Windhoek home Tuesday night. A civil rights lawyer, he was a member
of SWAPO's election directorate and helped direct its campaign for
U.N.-supervised elections scheduled for early November as a prelude
to independence next year.
   SWAPO said the assassination of Lubowski was intended to create
instability prior to the elections, which SWAPO is widely favored to
dominate, and to frighten whites at a time when racial unity is
growing.
   Asked about fears for his own security, Nujoma said, ``Whenever I
move about I am concerned about my own safety.'' All SWAPO leaders
have unarmed bodyguards and say they have received no answer to
their request to form a registered security company. They said they
have applied for police protection but they want U.N. forces to
monitor the police guards.
   South Africa, which has ruled Namibia 74 years, has agreed to
independence for the territory under U.N. supervision as part of a
regional peace accord also calling for withdrawal of Cuban troops
from Angola.
   On Wednesday, posters appeared in Windhoek with a photograph of
Nujoma and a target superimposed on his face.
   A local newspaper editor, Gwen Lister, said she received two
phone calls Wednesday from men saying they belonged to the White
Wolves and that the white supremacist organization killed Lubowski.
   Men identifying themselves as Whites Wolves have carried out
several attacks on blacks and anti-apartheid activists in South
Africa. Police say they have not been able to prove the organization
exists.
   Fighting between SWAPO guerrillas and the South African-led
security forces ended in April. Since then, there have been only
isolated violent incidents in this territory whose 1.3 million
population is 84 percent black with the rest nearly equal parts
white and mixed-race people.
   Lubowski died only hours after Namibia's nine largest political
parties, including SWAPO, signed a code of conduct for the elections
that prohibits violence. He was widely known abroad, and his killing
was condemned by the United States, Britain, West Germany, Norway,
Sweden, amd Zambia, among others.
   Nujoma is not considered a rigid ideologue, although his
organization is leftist-leaning and favors a socialist economy. He
is viewed as a shrewd, instinctive politician, maintaining the
presidency of SWAPO since 1960 despite occasional challenges.
   Under his leadership, the movement was recognized by the United
Nations as ``the sole and authentic representative of the Namibian
people,'' although the territory had dozens of political parties.
   The United Nations dropped that designation before its contingent
came to Namibia this year to monitor the independence process.

   Richard C. Breeden, President Bush's nominee to
head the Securities and Exchange Commission, said today that
vigorous securities law enforcement was good for market integrity
and could help U.S. markets compete globally for foreign investment.
   Breeden also told the Senate Banking Committee at his
confirmation hearing that criminal sanctions are ``a helpful adjunct
to a civil enforcement program.''
   Breeden's testimony followed opening remarks by committee
chairman Sen. Donald W. Riegle Jr., D-Mich., that the next SEC chief
``must be the strongest chairman to date in enforcement of
securities law.''
   The senator contended that current securities laws have ``an
inadequate ability to deter serious and flagrant violators.''
   When asked by Sen. Christopher Dodd, D-Conn., how he squared his
reputation as a free-market advocate with the need for strong
enforcement, Breeden said it was a ``perfectly legitimate role for
government to keep the markets clean.''
   Breeden also said that while decades-old securities laws do not
address the current global competition against domestic markets, ``I
think that can be attractive'' to foreign investors if U.S. markets
are considered free of corruption.
   Breeden was the White House point man on the savings and loan
bailout. He did not speak with reporters about his views on the
issues facing the securities industry after his nomination was
announced Aug. 14, instead issuing a statement that he would speak
only to the committee considering his nomination.
   Reigle has suggested that Breeden lacks the background to handle
issues such as leveraged buyouts insider trading that face the SEC.
   ``Mr. Breeden is highly intelligent and did fine work on the S&amp;L
reform package and in other governmental assignments,'' Riegle said
earlier in a statement after Breeden's nomination. ``Yet he brings a
limited direct market experience to this critical assignment and
that is a matter of some concern when the SEC faces a time of epic
challenge.''
   Among the issues before the SEC that Breeden was expected to
address were leveraged buyouts, insider trading and the programmed
trading that has led to uncontrolled stock market fluctuations.
   Breeden was also expected to answer questions about whether the
SEC should have a say in overseas takeover battles, such as the
ongoing fight for the British BAT Industries PLC, that involve U.S.
jobs and shareholders.
   The SEC is also going through internal upheaval as it faces
pressing financial market issues.
   In addition to Ruder, two of the other four commissioners have
indicated they are leaving. There's also a vacancy in the post of
enforcement division head.
   A banking attorney before he joined the White House staff,
Breeden helped write the Bush plan for bailing out the S&amp;L industry
and then shepherded the bill through Congress.
   He also worked for then-Vice President Bush in the Reagan
administration.

   East Germans hoping to emigrate West have
taken refuge in the West German Embassy in Warsaw, the Foreign
Ministry said Thursday. It said the government hopes to resolve the
problem ``in a few days.''
   The East Germans are following the course of thousands of their
countrymen who crowded the West German Embassy in Hungary. They were
allowed to go West after the reformist government of Hungary opened
its border.
   Polish television reported Wednesday night that there were about
50 East Germans in the Warsaw embassy. They reportedly began
arriving several weeks ago.
   Ministry spokesman Stefan Staniszewski confirmed Thursday that
East Germans were in the embassy but said he did not know how many
were there.
   One 9-year-old boy interviewed on television said there were
about 60 people housed inside a large room. Laundry could be seen
hanging in the embassy yard, and the youngster said a hotel was
providing food for the East Germans.
   Several young men lounged and read in the embassy courtyard. One
raised his fingers in a ``V'' for victory sign.
   The 9-year-old said he traveled to Warsaw with his 13-year-old
brother and their parents about 10 days ago from Goerlitz, an East
German city near the Polish border.
   The other refugees mainly come from Goerlitz, Dresden and East
Berlin, the boy said before he was called away by his father.
   ``Soon we are going to deal with this matter and we will try to
solve it, probably in a few days,'' Staniszewski said in a report
carried by the official PAP news agency.
   The pro-Solidarity daily Gazeta Wyborcza said that because Poland
is a much bigger country and is in a more difficult geopolitical
situation than Hungary, it should be cautious.
   ``Hungary's attitude may evoke sympathy, but as a state we should
not follow their example or even praise them loudly,'' the
commentary said.
   Poland is bordered by Communist East Germany, Czechoslovakia and
the Soviet Union, while Hungary shares a border with non-Communist
Austria.
   Both Hungary and Poland are at the forefront of reforms in the
East bloc. Poland this week approved the East bloc's first
government not led by Communists.
   Falko Schreiber, press spokesman for the East German Embassy in
Warsaw, said the embassy had not been authorized to hold talks with
West German diplomats. The West German Embassy in Warsaw refused
comment on the situation.
   PAP reported that talks between top representatives of the Polish
and West German government opened in Warsaw on Thursday. It did not
say if the refugee situation was raised.
   In addition to Warsaw and Budapest, East Germans also holed up in
the West German Embassy in Prague, Czechoslovakia, hoping to go
West. About 250 agreed to return home after promises they would not
be punished, but 150 reportedly remain in the embassy.

<TEXT>
   A strike by Azerbaijani railroad workers to press
nationalist demands has cut fuel supplies into the neighboring
Soviet republic of Armenia and left ambulances, trucks and cars
without gas, Pravda said today.
   ``Because of the halt on the Azerbaijan railroad, Armenia is
practically in a state of economic blockade,'' Armenian Deputy
Premier Y. Khodzhamiryan told the Communist Party daily.
   The official said Armenia gets 87 percent of its freight,
including fuel supplies, from Azerbaijan.
   Since February, the two southern republics have been locked in a
bitter dispute about control of the Nagorno-Karabakh region. The
mountainous territory is part of Azerbaijan, but its predominantly
Armenian population and the Armenian republic demand that it be
transferred to Armenian control.
   The Azerbaijani People's Front political movement called a
general strike last week, demanding Azerbaijan reassert control over
Nagorno-Karabakh. Moscow moved in to directly administer the enclave
after ethnic violence flared.
   Cutting supplies to Armenia was not one of the stated aims of the
general strike, which was called off on Monday.
   Pravda did not make it clear whether some Azerbaijani rail
workers who took part in the general strike were still on a walkout,
or whether the current rail paralysis was caused by an earlier
strike. The newspaper said that on Sunday, 250 trains had been
abandoned on lines leading to Yerevan, Armenia's capital.
   The dispute between Armenian and Azerbaijan has killed about 100
people in the past 18 months and caused hundreds of thousands of
people to flee their homes in Armenia and Azerbaijan.
   Official Soviet newspapers have said the situation remains tense.
   Pravda said the 19-mile road from the Armenian city of Goris to
the boundary of Nagorno-Karabakh is so dangerous that it is
``impossible to pass even with a military escort.''
   The national youth newspaper Komsomolskaya Pravda reported on
Wednesday that there were few cars on even the main streets of
Yerevan, the Armenian capital, and there were long delays in public
transportion service.
   Pravda said gas stations did not have enough fuel to fill the
tanks of even ambulances.
   The lack of fuel and supplies was particularly threatening in
northern Armenia where workers are trying to reconstruct cities
devastated by the earthquake Dec. 7 that killed 25,000 people.
   ``The coming winter is putting people under the real threat of
being without shelter,'' Pravda said.

   Sharp differences emerged today among
Palestinians and Israelis over the plan Egyptian President Hosni
Mubarak put forward to end the uprising in the occupied territories.
   Soldiers shot and killed a 28-year-old Palestinian while trying
to arrest him on charges of being an activist in the uprising, the
army said. It said soldiers fired after the suspect ignored orders
to halt in the Gaza Strip.
   The victim, Mohammed Arafat Al-Akra, died of a bullet wound to
the head, Arab reporters said. They said he had been jailed three
times without charges during the uprising.
   Seventeen other Palestinians were shot and wounded in clashes
with soldiers elsewhere in the occupied lands, Arab hospital
officials said.
   The army confirmed two injuries in Nablus, saying stoning attacks
occurred there after a 12-day curfew was lifted. The army denied an
Arab report that an 18-year-old Palestinian was wounded by a soldier
shooting from a helicopter.
   Al-Akra's death raised to 568 the number of Palestinians killed
in clashes with soldiers and Israeli civilians in the 21-month-old
uprising. Another 114 Palestinians were slain by fellow Arabs as
alleged collaborators with Israel. Forty Israelis also have been
killed.
   An Israeli soldier, Corporal Yosef Haba, 20, died of
electrocution Wednesday while he was on a rooftop in Gaza and the
aerial on his military radio touched a high-tension wire, the army
said.
   The Islamic fundamentalist movement Hamas, or Zeal, distributed a
leaflet rejecting the peace proposal by Mubarak, who has been trying
to persuade PLO chairman Yasser Arafat to accept the plan.
   Hamas, which has organized the uprising along with PLO-backed
leaders, warned residents of the territories about ``Arab regimes
who are acting with the backing of the United States.''
   U.S. officials have said that Mubarak's plan could be an avenue
to revive Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir's stalled proposal for
holding elections in the West Bank and Gaza Strip as a first step
toward peace talks.
   Shamir's plan calls for electing Palestinians from the West Bank
and Gaza Strip to negotiate an interim peace plan with Israel. The
final status of the occupied territories would be decided in later
talks.
   Mubarak's plan calls for allowing the Arabs in Jerusalem to vote
and for conducting talks on the basis of trading occupied land for
peace, two controversial issues not included in the Shamir plan
approved by the joint Likud-Labor Cabinet.
   Two leading members of the prime minister's right-wing Likud bloc
criticized Shamir and other top leaders for meeting to discuss
Mubarak's 10-point peace proposal on Wednesday.
   Industry Minister Ariel Sharon, on a visit to the United States,
told Israel radio that Israel should reject without discussion any
effort to alter Shamir's election plan.
   ``There is no other plan, and there is no need for another
plan,'' Sharon said. ``It is inconceivable that the government of
Israel will be pushed from time to time in directions it does not
intend to go.''
   David Levy, the housing minister, also was quoted in the
Jerusalem Post as complaining that the meeting was held despite
Shamir's statement that he opposed even talking about Mubarak's plan.
   ``This shows that what we say doesn't hold for even one day,''
Levy told the English-language Post.

   Youngsters in 15 cities will have a chance to
participate in a $65 million job-skills project, officials of two
non-profit groups said Thursday.
   The Urban Corps Expansion Project will ``provide young adults
with paying jobs that will give them work, academic skills and a
chance to demonstrate that they can be socially responsible,'' said
Michael Bailin, president of Philadelphia-based Public-Private
Ventures.
   Also involved in the project is the National Association of
Service and Conservation Corps, based here.
   The effort will combine $10 million in private funds with $55
million from local and state governments and community groups,
Bailin said.
   ``Many urban areas have more work to do than the budget can bear
and too many unproductive and underskilled young people,'' he said.
   The proposal calls for employing 200 youths a year in each of 15
cities, which will be chosen from 23 communities that will receive
$10,000 planning grants.
   The communities are: Denver; Bridgeport and New Haven, Conn;
Miami and Fort Lauderdale, Fla.; Savannah, Ga.; Chicago; Detroit and
Flint, Mich.; St. Paul, Minn.; St. Louis and Kansas City, Mo.;
Durham and Winston-Salem, N.C.; Albany and Rochester, N.Y.; Eugene

Spokane, Wash.; and Milwaukee.

   Sixteen members of a Romanian
family hid for two days in a truck carrying prunes to escape from
their East bloc nation to the West, police said Thursday.
   The emigres, who included seven children, were in good condition
when they arrived at the police station in this western Dutch town
six miles south of Rotterdam on Wednesday night, according to
spokesman Johan Emond.
   Emond said the family, with children ranging in age from one to
11 years, paid the truck's driver $325 for the trip, which began
Tuesday in the western Romanian city of Timisoara.
   It was the biggest group of Eastern Europeans seeking asylum here
in recent years. In the first seven months of 1989, a total of 6,350
people have asked for political asylum in the Netherlands, according
to the Justice Ministry.

   A steampipe explosion Thursday sprayed dirt
and gravel on more than 100 parked cars and a restaurant, officials
said.
   A 12-inch split in the pipe, buried about 8 feet underground at a
construction site, caused escaping steam to blew out gravel and
dirt, said Steve Smith, vice president and general manager of
Philadelphia Thermal Energy Corp., which placed the pipe.
   No one was injured in the 4 a.m. incident.
   Several cars had smashed windows. Most were covered with dust and
mud. Rocks and dirt punched holes in the third- and first-floor
roofs of Westy's Tavern and Restaurant located across from the site.
   Crews worked through the morning to replace the pipe, which the
company plans to test to find out what caused the split, Smith said.
   Company officials already have contacted most of the car owners,
Smith said.
   ``Most of it was confined to windows and cars parked adjacent to
the site. We'll be paying for a lot of car washes,'' he said.

   Poor typing led to the arrest of a
patrolman on charges he stole $140 from a wallet stored in the
police property room, the chief said.
   Patrolman Thomas J. Bruno II, an eight-year-veteran of the
department, was released on $7,000 signature bail Tuesday. He was
charged with taking $140 from the wallet and altering a document to
cover up the theft.
   On Sept. 1, four days after the money was discovered missing, a
letter and money arrived in the mail. Police Chief William F. Miller
thought something looked familiar.
   According to an affidavit signed by Miller, there were numerous
typed mistakes corrected by hand and several phrases typical of
reports submitted by Bruno.
   ``I read a number of reports. ... I knew I'd seen it before,''
Miller said Wednesday.
   Miller said the letter was compared with reports and other
documents written by police officers.
   A few days later, Bruno admitted taking the money and altering
the document, according to the affadavit.

   The head of Iran's state-run news agency
was named Thursday to be the country's ambassador to the United
Nations, Tehran radio reported.
   The broadcast, monitored in Nicosia, said Kamal Kharrazi was
recommended for the post by Foreign Minister Ali Akbar Velayati and
confirmed by President Hashemi Rafsanjani.
   As director-general of the Islamic Republic News Agency, the
Kharrazi wielded considerable influence in the government. He was
described as American-educated, but it was not known where he
studied.
   Since his election in July, Rafsanjani has been replacing
hard-ine ideologues in key government positions with more moderate,
often Western-educated technocrats.
   Iran's previous ambassador to the United Nations, Mohammad Jaafar
Mahallati, was removed from office earlier this year in what was
seen as a warning to Rafsanjani and Velayati to stop trying to tone
down Iran's militantly Islamic image.
   Mahallati's dismissal came weeks after the late Ayatollah
Ruhollah Khomeini pronounced a death sentence on British writer
Salman Rushdie for allegedly defaming Islam in his novel, ``The
Satanic Verses.''

   Former President Reagan received a visit
from Soviet maverick Boris Yeltsin today at the hospital where he is
recovering from brain surgery.
   As Yeltsin arrived at St. Marys Hospital, the Soviet politician
said through an interpreter that he had ``no intention of discussing
any business'' with Reagan.
   ``It wouldn't be very tactful. He's recovering from an operation.
I just want to have a courtesy call, that's all,'' said Yeltsin, who
is on a speaking tour of the United States and had asked to meet
with Reagan.
   Reagan spokesman Mark Weinberg said the 78-year-old former
president is recovering well from surgery Friday by Mayo Clinic
doctors to remove fluid caused when he was thrown from a horse July
4. Weinberg said Reagan might leave the hospital by the end of the
week.
   Reagan ``has been following the visit with interest because
U.S.-Soviet relations are of special interest and importance to him,
and it's an opportunity to get Mr. Yeltsin's observations on what he
has seen in the United States,'' Weinberg said.
   The 58-year-old Yeltsin, an outspoken critic of some of Mikhail
Gorbachev's policies, was ousted as Moscow's Communist Party chief
in 1987 but was elected to parliament with overwhelming popular
support.
   He has been prodding Gorbachev to step up the pace of reform in
the Soviet Union.
   On Wednesday in Philadelphia, Yeltsin stopped at the Liberty Bell
and Independence Hall. Yeltsin said he discussed 10 trade proposals
during a brief meeting with President Bush on Tuesday. He would not
give specifics.

<HEAD>Despite Contacts, No Dialogue with Sandinistas Seen by US Officials</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: Inserts 2 grafs with Nicaraguan comment after 4th graf, The

<TEXT>
   An unannounced high-level contact between U.S.
and Nicaraguan officials last weekend is not a prelude to a
resumption of direct dialogue between the two countries, according
to State Department officials.
   The weekend meeting in Managua _ the first such contact between
the two countries in almost five years _ involved President Daniel
Ortega and a U.S. delegation consisting of members of Congress and
Assistant Secretary of State Janet Mullins. The American delegation
stopped in Managua as part of a tour of Central America.
   Officials of the Nicaraguan Contras expressed disappointment over
the meeting, but State Department officials said Wednesday night
that no diplomatic signal to the Sandinistas was intended.
   The officials, insisting on anonymity, said the administration
believes the Sandinista government should work out its differences
with the Nicaraguan opposition, including the Contras, without
direct U.S. participation.
   In Managua today, Nicaraguan Foreign Ministry spokesman David
Silva confirmed the weekend but said he had no details.
   Asked if he could ask for more information from higher officials
at the Foreign Ministry, Silva declined, saying: ``It looks like
they want to conduct this with some caution.''
   The Reagan administration carried on a six-month dialogue with
the Sandinista government that ended in January 1985 when U.S.
officials accused Nicaragua of negotiating in bad faith. High-level
contacts with Nicaragua were barred afterward but that policy
apparently did not carry over into the Bush administration.
   State Department spokeswoman Margaret Tutwiler said Wednesday
there have been no guidelines on official discussions with
Sandinista authorities. Even so, there were no high-level contacts
until the Sunday meeting in Managua.
   In addition, the State Department's top official for Latin
America, Bernard Aronson, rebuffed a Nicaraguan vice minister's
efforts several weeks ago to engage in a substantive discussion at a
social gathering, according to U.S. officials.
   During the meeting with Ortega, Ms. Mullins reaffirmed the U.S.
view that the electoral process now beginning in Nicaragua should be
monitored by observers of many countries including the United
States, Ms. Tutwiler said. Ms. Mullins heads the State Department
office of congressional relations.
   National elections are scheduled to be held in Nicaragua on Feb.
25. The Bush administration and other governments have been pressing
the Sandinistas to allow opposition forces a fair chance to win the
balloting.
   At the White House today, spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said the
administration was ``still examining the possibilities with
Congress'' of whether to channel money to the campaign of opposition
presidential candidate Violeta Chamorro through an independent U.S.
foundation.
   Officials have suggested helping Mrs. Chamorro through the
National Endowment For Democracy, which receives most of its funding
from congressional grants to support democratic efforts around the
world.
   Asked if such intervention, which could also include the
foundation's more typical activities such as voter registration
might be used by Ortega as proof of U.S. meddling in internal
matters, Fitzwater said, ``That's always a concern.''
   But he also praised Mrs. Chamorro, saying she has ``been a leader
in the struggle for democracy for many years ... I think she's a
very good candidate for the opposition.''
   A spokesman for the Nicaraguan resistance, Bosco Matamoros, said
the rebel movement was not consulted in advance about the weekend
meeting in Managua.
   He also complained that the Bush administration has refused to
have contact with representatives of the Contra political
leadership. No replies have been received to Contra letters sent to
Aronson and to Secretary of State James A. Baker III, he said.
   Meanwhile, Paul Reichler, a Washington-based lawyer who
represents the Sandinistas, saw the weekend meeting as a positive
step and expressed hope that it will lead to a normalization of
relations.
   Ms. Tutwiler said the meeting with Ortega was not scheduled until
Ms. Mullins and the congressional delegation arrived in Nicaragua.
Ms. Tutwiler was uncertain whether Ms. Mullins had sought prior
approval from Washington before agreeing to take part in the meeting.
   In another development Wednesday, the Nicaraguan Embassy said it
had denied the application of the privately funded Commission on
Free and Fair Elections in Nicaragua for visas for a delegation to
monitor preparations for the February national elections.
   ``Our elections are not something to be manipulated by
individuals and groups interested in furthering conflict,'' said
charge d'affairs Leonor Arguella de Huper.
   The Nicaraguan electoral process was the subject of meetings
Tuesday among Baker and senators and House members.
   Among other subjects, Baker stressed the importance of U.S.
financial assistance to ensure Nicaragua's democratic process is
free and fair, Ms. Tutwiler said.
   Congress has the option of suspending the assistance at the end
of November. The Central American presidents have called for the
voluntary demobilization of the Contras by Dec. 5.

<HEAD>Nine Tickets Hold the Key to $55 Million Jackpot</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SAN DIEGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A group of friends who pooled their money to buy
at least 200 lottery chances today claimed to have one of the nine
winning tickets to a $55 million jackpot, the second-largest in
California history.
   Each ticket with the six winning numbers in Wednesday's drawing
is worth more than $6.1 million.
   Jackie Wagner of San Diego said she and 19 friends chipped in $10
each for a block of the $1 tickets, with the numbers selected at
random by the lottery computer. She said she couldn't believe her
eyes when she checked the numbers drawn against the tickets.
   ``I was hyperventilating,'' Ms. Wagner told Los Angeles radio
station KNX-AM. ``I said, `Oh my God, I don't believe this.'''
   ``We're celebrating and having champagne and all kinds of good
stuff,'' she said. ``We're just so excited.''
   The chances of picking the six winning numbers were 1 in nearly
14 million. The jackpot sparked a frenzy of ticket-buying, with more
than $66 million sold since Saturday.
   The biggest jackpot in California is the $61.9 million won by
three ticketholders in October 1988.

   The government security agency said it
has a convicted drug trafficker and a reputed cocaine smuggler in
custody and is prepared to extradite them to the United States.
   The office of Gen. Miguel Maza Marquez, the head of
Administrative Security Department, said Bernardo Pelaez Roldan and
Guillermo Bueno Delgado were in a high-security prison. It said
extradition proceedings were under way.
   The statement followed an announcement from the U.S. Justice
Department in Washington that they were seeking the extradition of
Pelaez Rodan, an alleged associate of the Medellin drug cartel
convicted of drug trafficking charges five years ago in Detroit.
   Bueno Delgado, allegedly of the rival Cali cartel, is wanted in
San Francisco and Tallahassee, Fla., on charges of money laundering
and importing about 13,000 pounds of cocaine.
   In Washington, Justice Department spokesman David Runkel said
``the papers have gone down'' to Colombia requesting Pelaez Rodan's
extradition.
   Pelaez Roldan faces a 15-year sentence in the Detroit case, said
Frank Shults of the Drug Enforcement Administration.
   In addition to the extradition papers, the United States also has
sent to Colombia a request for Pelaez Roldan's provisional arrest,
which would allow the Colombian government to keep him in custody
until the extradition proceedings are completed, Shults said.
   Pelaez Roldan was indicted in November 1983 on federal charges of
conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute cocaine, Runkel
said. He was arrested in Florida and taken before a U.S. magistrate
in Detroit in January 1984, and the trial was set to begin that
March.
   He was released on bond and ``never seen again,'' said Runkel,
who added that he did not know how much the bond was.
   Tried in absentia, Pelaez Roldan was convicted in April 1984 and
sentenced to 15 years in prison, Shults said. A warrant for his
arrest was issued in May 1984, Runkel said.
   The United States sought his extradition from Colombia, and the
government there granted that request in March 1986. However, Pelaez
Roldan was not in custody, and the Colombian Supreme Court threw out
the extradition treaty in 1987.
   Under emergency measures imposed by Colombian President Virgilio
Barco following the Aug. 18 assassination of leading presidential
candidate Luis Carlos Galan, extraditions to the United States were
resumed.
   The only person sent to the United States under the newly
reinstituted agreement is Eduardo Martinez Romero, who faces
money-laundering and drug-trafficking charges in Atlanta.
   The Washington Post reported today that Gen. Meza Marquez
described Pelaez Roldan as ``the most important person yet taken
into custody.'' A spokesman for the Administrative Security
Department said he was ``one of the biggest money launderers in
Colombia, much bigger that Martinez Romero,'' and the general
agreed, the Post said.
   However, Pelaez Roldan faces no money-laundering charges in the
United States, Runkel said.

   An air force jet crashed and burst into
flames Thursday, killing both crewmen, after its engine failed and
the pilot attempted an emergency landing, the Defense Ministry said.
   A ministry spokesman said the two fliers put out a distress
signal to air traffic controllers just before the crash.
   The Chilean-made E-26 Tamiz was on a training flight when the
accident occurred. The spokesman said the plane's engine failed and
the pilot tried to land at a military training field near Javier, in
southeastern Spain.
   The pilots were accumulating flying hours to complete a course
they were taking at the Air Force General Academy in San Javier.

<HEAD>Metro North Drafts Rules for Public Conduct</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A commuter railroad has drafted regulations for
public conduct on trains and in stations, including rules banning
nudity and sexual actvities.
   The rules, given preliminary approval Wednesday by Metro-North,
could lead to confrontations with the homeless, especially at Grand
Central terminal, critics argued.
   The Long Island Rail Road drafted similar regulations Tuesday.
   The draft outlines penalties for offenders such as summonses or
ejection, and fines of $50 and 30 days in jail.
   The proposals prohibit bathing at a drinking fountain, washing
clothing in restrooms or at any other source of water, changing
clothes or ``remaining undressed'' in a Metro-North station or
property and lying on ``floors, platforms, stairs or landings.''
Regulations for such activities as specific forms of sexual conduct
were spelled out.
   The proposals came days after Metro-North closed the large
waiting room at Grand Central _ long a haven for the homeless. The
Coalition for the Homeless estimates that 500 to 1,000 people stay
in the terminal or the streets and subway stations around it on a
given night.
   Metro-North President Peter Stangl said the draft was part of a
continuing effort by the Metropolitan Transportation Authority to
make all its agencies codify ``quality of life'' regulations.
   Stangl said he did not foresee the regulations creating
unnecessary confrontations with the homeless.
   ``But there are also people pretending to be homeless who are
selling crack and committing other crimes in Grand Central, and we
want them out of there,'' Stangl said.
   Norman Siegel, executive director of the New York Civil Liberties
Union said confrontations were inevitable. ``These rules would
transform a social and economic problem into a criminal problem,''
he said.
   He said Metro-North should continue efforts to help the homeless
into city shelters and enroll in drug or alcohol treatment programs.
   The proposals were unanimously approved with minor discussion at
a monthly meeting of Metro-North's board. They must be discussed at
public hearings and require the approval of the full MTA board.

<HEAD>Auto Sales Help Retail Sales to Slight August Gain</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN D. McCLAIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Retail sales rose a moderate 0.7 percent in
August because of strong automobile sales, the government reported
Thursday, but analysts foresee growing sluggishness in the remainder
of the year.
   The Commerce Department said sales increased to a seasonally
adjusted $144.3 billion in August following a 0.5 percent gain in
July. Sales had remained flat in June after rising 0.8 percent in
May.
   Analysts said the report was consistent with the so-called
``soft-landing'' scenario sought by the Federal Reserve as it moves
to keep inflation under control while permitting continued, but
slower, economic growth.
   At the White House, press secretary Marlin Fitzwater said the
August figure was ``an indication of continued but slow growth in
the current economic expansion, which is now in its 82nd month, so
it's good news.''
   Auto sales, which represent about 20 percent of retail sales,
advanced 2.6 percent last month, driven by end-of-model-year sales
incentives and the threat of steep price increases for 1990 models.
Those sales had risen 1.7 percent in July.
   But Michael K. Evans of Evans Economics Inc., a Washington
consulting firm, said, ``Auto sales have peaked. They came in low
(in early September). October will be way down. So total retail
sales will be down.''
   ``I think we will see a decided weakness in auto spending in the
fourth quarter,'' agreed Allen Sinai, chief economist of The Boston
Co.
   Excluding the automobile category, retail sales edged up only 0.2
percent in August.
   Sales of durable goods, big-ticket items including autos that are
expected to last more than three years, rose 2.4 percent on top of
an 0.8 percent gain in July. On the other hand, sales of non-durable
goods fell 0.4 percent after rising 0.4 percent a month earlier.
   ``This is just the opposite of the pattern of many previous
months,'' Sinai said.
   Evans and William K. MacReynolds, director of forecasting for the
U.S. Chamber of Commerce, attributed the strength in durable goods
sales to lower interest rates and discount prices.
   ``Consumers are willing to spend money, but they have to be
enticed,'' Evans said.
   In the durable goods category, building materials advanced 2.2
percent and furniture and other home furnishing sales gained 1.6
percent, reflecting in part, analysts said, both increased home
sales and remodeling.
   The only advances in the non-durable goods category were apparel
sales, up 1.1 percent in part because of back-to-school clothes
shopping, and drug stores, up 1.4 percent.
   But general merchandise sales, including department stores, did
not benefit as much from the back-to-school spending, analysts said,
and fell 0.9 percent.
   Other declines in the non-durable categories included food
stores, down 0.2 percent; service stations, down 1.5 percent,
reflecting falling gasoline prices; and restaurants and bars, down 1
percent.
   For the three months from June through August, overall retail
sales were up 5.8 percent over the same period in 1988. Retail sales
so far in 1989 were 5.9 percent above those in the first eight
months of 1988.

   A Palestinian accused in the bombing of a
Pan Am jet asked Thursday to be released from prison while Greece
decides on a U.S. extradition request, his lawyer said.
   Mohammed Rashid, 39, has been held in Greece since his May 1988
arrest on charges of planting a bomb on a Pan Am jumbo jet in 1982.
A Japanese teen-ager was killed and 15 people were injured in the
blast over Hawaii.
   The Athens Supreme Court upheld a U.S request for his extradition
in May, but the final decision rests with the justice minister.
   Greece's conservative-leftist government said in July that
Rashid's extradition will not be decided until new elections are
held by Nov. 5.
   American officials say Rashid's case is a test of Greece's
willingness to fight terrorism.
   The Palestinian asked prosecutor Dimitris Evthimiadis to take up
his petition. If the prosecutor decides it has merit, Rashid can
seek a hearing before the Appeals Court Council, which rules on
requests for temporary releases.
   Evthimiadis is expected to make a decision in the next few days.
   ``The lack of any final decision being taken by the justice
minister for such a long time period clearly violates basic tenets
which call for the swift processing of extradition cases, and it
stretches out my detention indefinitely, thus violating basic human
rights,'' lawyer Spyros Fytrakis quoted Rashid's petition as saying.
   Rashid first was held for entering Greece on a false passport.
His detention was extended after homemade knives were found in his
cell.

   A man demanding that South Africa free black
nationalist leader Nelson Mandela shot himself in the head Thursday
at the South African Airways office, authorities said.
   The man, identified as Manuel Leloup, was reported in critical
condition after firing a bullet from a .22-caliber revolver into his
temple.
   Leloup, identified only as a Frenchman about 20 years old,
entered the airline's Paris offices at about 2:30 p.m., pulled out
the revolver, and said he was very interested in South Africa's
political problems and demanded to speak to someone at the South
African Embassy, said deputy prosecutor Marie Hilda Gouineau.
   She said Leloup spoke to three members of the airline staff in an
``apparently coherent manner without threatening them'' and was put
in telephone contact with unidentified high-ranking embassy
officials for about 10 minutes.
   ``After hanging up, he said that for him it was all over and
fired a bullet to his temple,'' Ms. Gouineau said.
   An embassy spokesman said Leloup had demanded freedom for
Mandela, who is serving a life sentence in South Africa on charges
of plotting to overthrow the government.

   Explorers who found the wreck of a
19th-century steamboat off South Carolina two years ago have begun
hauling up a trove of gold coins and bars that could be worth up to
$1 billion, a spokeswoman said today.
   The booty aboard the SS Central America includes fortunes made in
the California Gold Rush, said Judy Conrad, a historian with the
Columbus America Discovery Group, which is excavating the wreck.
   ``I never dreamed it would be like this,'' Thomas Thompson, a
director of the Columbus America Discovery Group, said in an
interview in today's Washington Post.
   The paddlewheel steamer carrying passengers to New York from San
Francisco went down Sept. 12, 1857, in a hurricane. Of the
approximately 575 people aboard, only about 150 survived.
   The wreck is 200 miles east of Charleston, just inside U.S.
waters. The ocean is about 8,000 feet deep there.
   The ship was carrying a regular monthly shipment of gold from the
San Francisco mint to New York banks. The gold was valued at the
time at $1.2 million, based on the price of gold of about 90 cents
an ounce in 1857.
   The value of the government shipment has been estimated at
today's bullion prices _ about $360 a troy ounce _ at up to $450
million.
   In addition, the haul appears to include riches belonging to
passengers returning East after making their fortunes in California,
said Barry Schatz, another Columbus America director.
   The ship was located two years ago and its bell recovered last
summer, said Pamela Adkins, a spokeswoman for the group. The first
artifacts, including gold bars and rare 19th century coins, were
recovered last month, she said.
   The expedition has been at sea since July and will remain off the
coast as long as the weather holds, Ms. Adkins told The Associated
Press in a telephone interview from Washington. The explorers will
return to the site next summer.
   Among the treasures found were thousands of gold ``double eagle
coins'' which an auction consultant valued at about $8,000 each,
Thompson said.
   At such values, ``it isn't out of the realm of possibility'' that
the overall value of the SS Central America's cargo could swell to
$1 billion, Thompson said.
   Thompson, 37, a specialist in underwater mining and robotics,
could receive 40 percent of income from the cargo, the Columbus
(Ohio) Dispatch reported today.
   The treasure hunters are using a computer-based imaging system
that allows searchers to see objects far below the surface, he said.
   The Columbus America Discovery Group reported finding the
wreckage of the Central America in July 1987, a week after a federal
court in Norfolk, Va., ruled the group had salvage jurisdiction over
the wreck of the ship.

<HEAD>Poland Protests Reported Beating of Tourists by Romanian Soldiers</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WARSAW, Poland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Foreign Ministry filed a protest
Thursday after 30 Polish tourists said Romanian border soldiers beat
them brutally with rifle butts after dragging them off a train, the
state news agency PAP reported.
   The tourists were traveling from Budapest, Hungary, to the
Romanian capital, Bucharest, on Tuesday night when Romanian soldiers
ordered them to leave the train, forced them to turn over their
passports and kept them on a station platform while the train
departed, according to the PAP report.
   ``When I asked for my passport, I was dragged by force inside the
office, where I was brutally beaten up,'' the agency quoted Bogdan
Zapart of Legnica as saying.
   Boguslaw Miernik, general director of Poland's Foreign Ministry,
summoned Romania's charge d'affaires to demand an explanation, PAP
said.
   Miernik stressed such incidents ``do not serve the friendly
cooperation'' between the Warsaw Pact allies, the agency reported.
   It quoted Zapart as saying the soldiers fired tear gas and
wielded their rifles to subdue other Poles coming to his aid. The
group was locked in a waiting room, PAP reported.
   Zapart said he was handcuffed to a chair and beaten repeatedly,
PAP said.
   It quoted Emilia Kwietniewska of Bialogard as saying she saw
messages on the walls of the waiting room written in Polish about
similar attacks on other Poles, including rapes and robberies.
   The Romanian soldiers reportedly demanded payment Wednesday of
2,000 lei _ $167 at the official exchange rate or $28 on the black
market _ to release Zapart. He paid and the travelers were put back
on a train for Budapest, PAP said.
   Zapart was treated for injuries to his back, arms and head in
Budapest, where the group complained to the Polish Embassy,
according to state television.
   Their story was reported on front pages of several Polish
newspapers Thursday, including one that used the headline ``Romanian
border soliders are robbing and raping?'' then asked, ``Does Mr.
(Nicolae) Ceausescu know about this?'' referring to Romania's
hard-line Communist leader.
   Romania is a vehement opponent of recent East bloc reforms.
Poland is at the forefront of the reforms, having elected the East
bloc's first government not led by Communists.

   Jim Bakker's former chief aide today said
he objected to Bakker's use of the word ``investment'' in a brochure
offering free hotel rooms to $1,000 contributors, but the TV
evangelist got his way.
   The Rev. Richard Dortch, who pleaded guilty to fraud and drew
eight years in prison and $200,000 in fines for his role in the PTL
scandal, said Bakker insisted on keeping the word to entice
contributions.
   Bakker considered the fund-raising idea an ``inspiration'' from
God, Dortch said.
   Bakker is accused of overbooking his ministry's hotels and
diverting for his own use nearly $4 million raised from PTL
``lifetime partners'' _ $1,000 contributors who were promised three
nights' lodging a year for life at PTL's Heritage USA theme park
near Fort Mill, S.C.
   A parade of witnesses have said they paid the $1,000 only to be
told there was no room at the inn.
   If found guilty of all 24 counts of fraud and conspiracy, Bakker
could be sentenced to 120 years in prison and fined more than $5
million.
   Dortch today testified that Bakker was told at least daily about
the ministry's contributions and got updates even when he was on
television raising money. Dortch said Bakker kept a notebook with
daily listings of contributions and the number of ``lifetime
partnerships'' sold.
   Dortch said that he first heard of the partnerships about three
weeks after joining PTL in 1983 and that he was concerned with
brochures that called the partnerships an ``investment.''
   ``I had concern about the word because I had some experience in
the use of that term and I objected to the use of it in the
brochure,'' Dortch said.
   Dortch testified a week after being released from a Florida
hospital, where he had been held for several days for treatment of
an undisclosed ailment.
   Earlier today, the Rev. Don George, a former PTL board member,
said Bakker kept the board in the dark about the ministry's
financial straits and his six-figure bonuses and gave a rosy report
months before his 1987 downfall in a sex and money scandal.
   ``I was concerned about the endless fund-raising projects,'' said
George, who resigned over the ministry's fund-raising practices.
   ``There never seemed to be a balance period in the ministry when
large amounts of money were not being raised on TV.''
   George, of Irvine, Texas, joined the board in 1985 and quit in
February 1987, the month before Bakker resigned. He said Bakker gave
the board a financial overview at a meeting in January 1987.
   ``He gave a positive report. It was upbeat and encouraging,''
George said.
   On Wednesday, jurors were told that Bakker and his wife, Tammy,
were given more than $3 million in bonuses as the ministry narrowly
avoided financial collapse in the mid-1980s.
   Former PTL finance director Peter Bailey read from more than 70
memos he had sent the evangelist between 1983 and 1987 detailing the
TV ministry's chronic cash problems.
   ``We are continuing to operate far in excess of what is coming
in,'' Bailey read from a memo dated April 16, 1986, two weeks after
Bakker got a $200,000 bonus. ``The contributions are flat. We can
have all the financial controls in the world but if we don't live
within our means it doesn't mean anything.''
   In testimony today, George said the largest bonus he ever voted
for Bakker was $150,000, despite minutes from a November 1986
meeting at which Bakker was given a $500,000 bonus. The amount of
the bonus, as well as $150,000 for Bakker's wife, are in a memo
added to the board minutes.
   ``Did you ever vote for a $500,000 bonus for the Rev. Bakker,''
prosecutor Deborah Smith asked.
   ``No,'' George responded.

   State Trooper G.R. Johnson's infant son already
can boast about a ride in Dad's police car. He was born there.
   Johnson and his wife, Rosemarie, had planned on a delivery at
Cabell Huntington Hospital, and when Mrs. Johnson started having
contractions on Sunday, the couple began the more than one hour
drive there from their home.
   Their son, Robert Lee ``Cruise'' Johnson, had other plans, so
they made a quick turn after starting their journey at 11:05 a.m.
Trooper Johnson hit the siren and the flashing lights and they
threaded through traffic on U.S. 119 toward a closer hospital, Logan
General.
   As Mrs. Johnson's contractions came closer together, she decided
it was time.
   The 29-year-old bookkeeper and furniture accessory buyer
unfastened her seatbelt, slid to the edge of her seat and put one
foot up on the dashboard, at which time her 34-year-old husband's
heart went aflutter.
   ``I tried talking her out of it,'' he said, adding that he called
for an ambulance to meet them as they headed down the highway.
   ``I remained calm,'' Mrs. Johnson said of her first childbirth.
``I more or less said `mind over matter' going down the road and
just blocked everything out and concentrated on my breathing. I read
so much, I knew what to expect.
   ``I just grabbed his head with my left hand and held it. I put my
other hand around his side and held onto him that way. It was a
matter of just a few seconds, he just started crying.''
   Trooper Johnson said the sight of his 7-pound, 11-ounce boy was
quite a relief.
   ``When I heard that baby cry, it was like a ton of bricks was
lifted off my shoulders because I knew he was breathing,'' he said.
``I was all right then. It was fantastic.''
   The baby was born at 11:55, and the Johnsons arrived at the
hospital at noon. About 48 hours later, they returned home with the
healthy infant.

   People around here still talk about the
day Jeff Gaertig socked it to the Hemingford School Board.
   Gaertig, the Student Council president at Hemingford Public
School, went before the board recently to ask members to drop a
dress code requirement that the school's 176 students wear socks.
   Gaertig said shoe designs and fashions have changed in the 20
years or so since the board developed the dress code.
   ``There are the boat shoes and tennis shoes with better
ventilation,'' he said. ``I didn't think it would be a distraction
to learning whether students wore socks or not.''
   His presentation impressed school board members. They agreed
unanimously Monday to give the boot to the sock rule at the western
Nebraska school, which ranges from kindergarten to 12th grade.
   ``It was nice that he had the determination to come before the
school board,'' said board secretary Ken Sestak. ``A lot of times,
students get a little intimidated by authority.''
   Sestak said the policy had become difficult to enforce.
   ``It got to be where the principal would have to pull up pant
legs to tell or some students were wearing half-socks,'' Sestak
said. ``It wasn't a problem with learning.''

of senior citizens who earn more than a limited amount of outside
income, a group of House Republicans said Thursday.
   GOP critics of Social Security's earnings test released a private
study concluding that at least 700,000 retirees would rejoin the
labor market if the law were scrapped. The new workers would
generate more in income and payroll taxes than the government would
pay out in increased Social Security benefits.
   ``The retirement earnings limit is a cruel penalty imposed on
elderly workers,'' said Aldona Robbins, a former Treasury Department
economist who co-authored the study. ``It punishes the elderly but
doesn't save the government any money.''
   The study was sponsored by two conservative-oriented research
groups in Dallas, the Institute for Policy Innovation and the
National Center for Policy Analysis, and released by a task force of
the House Republican Research Committee.
   Rep. Dennis Hastert, chairman of the committee's Task Force on
the Social Security Earnings Test, said the study bolsters the case
for legislation to d repeal the limits and deflects arguments the
change would be too costly.
   ``That's the importance of this study, that we can start to tell
the White House, `Listen, there isn't a revenue cost here,''' said
Hastert, whose bill to eliminate the earnings test for those aged 65
and above has more than 130 co-sponsors. ``Eliminating the earnings
limit is sound policy. It's basically a win-win situation.''
   Under current law, workers aged 65 to 69 lose $1 in Social
Security benefits for every $2 they earn above $8,880. The limit is
$6,480 for workers under age 65; there is no limit for those 70 or
older.
   Starting in 1990, benefits for those age 65-69 will be reduced by
$1 for every $3 earned above the limit, which rises with growth in
average wages.
   Almost 1 million Social Security beneficiaries lose some or all
of their benefits each year, and an additional 100,000 people in the
65-69 age group do not file for Social Security benefits because of
the limit, according to the Social Security Administration.
   The researchers said their best estimate was that if the earnings
limit were scrapped for those aged 65 and above, there would be a
net revenue gain of $140 million for the government, while expanding
the earnings limit just to the optimal level of $39,360 would cut
the deficit by $3.2 billion a year.
   Workers earning more than that amount most likely haven't dropped
out of the work force so that exempting them from the earnings test
would not bring in new tax revenue but would still cost more in
Social Security benefits.
   ``Short of abolishing the earnings test, virtually any increase
in the earnings limit would lead to an increase in federal revenue
that would more than offset the increase in Social Security benefit
payments,'' the researchers reported.
   Rep. Dick Armey, a Texas Republican who also is chairman of the
Institute for Policy Innovation, said the earnings limit drives
older Americans from the workforce prematurely at a time when their
skills and experience are needed to help U.S. employers compete
internationally.
   ``Because the penalties for working are so high, many elderly
workers are simply dropping out of the system and becoming more
dependent on government instead,'' Armey said. ``That hurts all of
us.''
   A variety of proposals are pending in Congress to relax or repeal
the earnings limits, including a plan approved by the House Ways and
Means Committee to raise the earnings limit for those aged 65-69 to
approximately $10,440 by 1991. The Senate also has gone on record in
favor of a higher earnings limit.
   The Ways and Means proposal would increase federal revenue by
$700 million, according to the study.
   The earnings limit was imposed as part of the original Social
Security Act in 1935, which barred benefits to anyone still earning
wages. Before the first pension check was paid, that was modified to
bar benefits in any month in which a person earned $15 or more in
wages.
   The limit has been amended several times in recent years as more
people work past a retirement age of 65.

   A printing-company employee blazed away
with an assault rifle as he went from floor to floor of the plant
today, killing at least seven people and wounding 12 before taking
his own life, police said.
   ``I told them I'd be back,'' the gunman, Joseph T. Wesbecker, 47,
was quoted as saying.
   Five of the wounded were reported in critical condition with
multiple gunshot wounds. One person who was not wounded was
hospitalized with a heart attack.
   ``It looks like a battle zone ... with the blood and the people
involved there,'' Mayor Jerry Abramson said after touring the
three-story building next to The Courier-Journal newspaper offices.
   Police searched every floor for victims because of the
Standard-Gravure Co. building's many ``nooks and crannies,'' Chief
Richard Dotson said. Two victims were found during the mayor's tour.
   ``We also found a fellow sitting in a corner that was just
shuddering in fear,'' Abramson said. ``He hadn't been shot, but he
was in shock.''
   Wesbecker entered the building at 8:30 a.m. with a duffel bag, an
AK-47 rifle and a 9mm semi-automatic pistol and randomly fired at
people with the rifle, which had ammunition clips of about 25
rounds, Dotson said. The man had six to eight clips, but it was
unclear how many shots were fired.
   ``It started on the first floor,'' Dotson said. ``By the time our
officers arrived he had gone up to the third floor ... and he
eventually ended up in a pressroom in an annex area, which is where
he killed himself.''
   Wesbecker was approached by fellow employee John Tingle during
the rampage. ``I said, `Rocky, what are you doing here?''' Tingle
said. ``He said, `I told them I'd be back. Get out of my way, John.
I told them I'd be back.'''
   ``This guy's been talking about this for a year,'' said Joe
White, whom a TV station identified as a Standard-Gravure employee.
``He's been talking about guns and Soldier of Fortune magazine. He's
paranoid and he thought everyone was after him.''
   Dotson described Wesbecker as a disgruntled employee of
Standard-Gravure, which prints newspaper inserts and Sunday
newspaper supplements. He was on permanent disability, although the
nature of his disability was not immediately known.
   The police chief said an officer who knew Wesbecker told him the
man had been ``argumentative and confrontational for a number of
years.''
   After the shootings, the gunman lay face-down in a pool of blood
on the floor of a pressroom. The pistol was discovered under his
body and the AK-47 was a few feet away. The gunman apparently shot
himself with his pistol, Dotson said.
   The newspaper building was evacuated following the shooting at
about 8:30 a.m. At least two blocks were sealed off and about a
dozen ambulances lined the streets.
   It was the worst one-day mass killing since Aug. 20, 1986, when a
postal worker shot 14 people to death before killing himself at a
post office in Edmond, Okla.
   On Jan. 17, a 24-year-old drifter opened fire on a Stockton,
Calif., schoolyard with an AK-47 semi-automatic assault rifle and
other weapons, killing five children and wounding 29 others and one
teacher before killing himself.

   Here is a list of some of the worst mass murders in recent U.S.
history:
   JULY 18, 1984 _ Twenty-one people are fatally shot in a
McDonald's restaurant in San Ysidro, Calif., by James Oliver
Huberty, an out-of-work security guard. Huberty himself is killed by
a police sharpshooter.
   DECEMBER 1987 _ Sixteen people, including 14 members of one
family, are killed. The mass slaying is discovered after R. Gene
Simmons Sr. is arrested Dec. 28 in the killings of two people in
Russellville, Ark. A search of his home near Dover uncovers the
remains of 14 family members, who authorities say were killed by
Simmons just before Christmas. Simmons was convicted of capital
murder on two charges May 12, 1988, and sentenced to death.
   AUG. 1, 1966 _ Sixteen people are killed in Austin, Texas, by
Charles Whitman. Most are hit by sniper fire after he climbs to the
top of a campus tower at the University of Texas. Whitman is killed
by police.
   AUG. 20, 1986 _ Fourteen people are shot to death at a post
office in Edmond, Okla., by Pat Sherrill, 44, a postal worker who
authorities say was about to be fired. After police sharpshooters
arrive, Sherrill kills himself.
   FEB. 19, 1983 _ Thirteen people are fatally shot in the head
during a robbery at a gambling club in Seattle's Chinatown section.
Willie Mak and Benjamin Ng are later convicted of murder.
   SEPT. 5, 1949 _ Thirteen people are fatally shot in 12 minutes in
Camden, N.J. Howard Unruh, who told police, ``I'd have killed a
thousand if I'd had enough bullets,'' was found insane and committed
to a mental institution.
   SEPT. 25, 1982 _ Twelve people, including five children, are
killed in Wilkes-Barre and Jenkins Township, Pa. George Banks, 43,
is later convicted on 12 counts of murder and sentenced to death.
   MARCH 30, 1975 _ Eleven people, including eight children, are
killed at a family gathering in Hamilton, Ohio, on Easter Sunday. A
relative, James Ruppert, is convicted of two killings and found
innocent by reason of insanity in nine others.
   APRIL 15, 1984 _ Ten people, including eight children, are killed
in a Brooklyn, N.Y., apartment on Palm Sunday. Christopher Thomas is
convicted of first-degree manslaughter, the judge citing ``extreme
emotional disturbance.''
   JULY 14, 1966 _ Eight student nurses are stabbed or strangled in
a Chicago dormitory. Richard Speck, 24, is convicted of murder.
   FEB. 15, 1988 _ Seven people are killed and five others are
wounded at ESL Corp., a Silicon Valley defense contractor. A former
employee, Richard Wade Farley, 39, of San Jose, Calif., is arrested
and held at the Santa Clara County Jail. Authorities said he was
fired for harassing a woman employee. The woman was among those
injured.
   SEPT. 25, 1987 _ Seven family members, four of them children, are
shot to death on two Elkland, Mo., farms. Accused killer James
Schnick, who police say tried to divert blame for the killings to
his 14-year-old nephew, one of the victims, was convicted of three
counts of first degree murder and sentenced to death.
   JAN. 17, 1989 _ Patrick Purdy, a troubled 24-year-old drifter,
opens fire on a Stockton, Calif., schoolyard with an AK-47
semi-automatic assault rifle and other weapons. Five children are
killed and 29 others and one teacher are wounded. Purdy then turned
a pistol on himself.

   Airport guards found 11 pounds of
cocaine in the air conditioning duct of an Eastern Airlines plane
while conducting a routine search, authorities said Thursday.
   The Boeing 727 plane arrived in Caracas on Wednesday night from
Miami and the drug was found a few hours later, airport authorities
said.
   Venezuelan national guards routinely search Eastern flights since
small quantities of drugs have been found on the carrier's planes at
least six times in the past few months, they said.
   The plane returned to Miami on the regular Thursday morning
flight.

<HEAD>House Lawmakers Hope for Better Relations with FCC</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   House lawmakers warmly greeted a new Federal
Communications Commission on Thursday, saying they hoped for a new
era of cooperation with the agency.
   ``During the Reagan administration, the FCC's style most often
reflected that of the hard rock group The Clash,'' said Rep. Edward
J. Markey, chairman of the House Energy and Commerce
telecommunications and finance subcommittee.
   ``It is my hope that the workings and relationships of the (new
commission) ... will more closely resemble the Modern Jazz Quartet,
bringing with it an appreciation of tradition accompanied by both
creativity and innovation.''
   At a hearing on a bill to authorize $109.8 million in spending
for the FCC in fiscal 1990 and $121.5 million in fiscal 1991,
Democrats and Republicans alike expressed pleasure at seeing former
Missouri broadcaster Alfred Sikes as chairman of the agency.
   Sikes, who has been on the job five weeks, was accompanied by
three commissioners.
   Energy and Commerce Committee Chairman Rep. John Dingell,
D-Mich., said Sikes' predecessors ``somehow didn't have a full
awareness of this committee'' and of Congress.
   He urged Sikes, along with incumbent commissioner James Quello
and newcomers Sherrie Marshall and Andrew Barrett, not to conduct
FCC business based on ideology or administration policy.
   Under the leadership of Mark Fowler and Dennis Patrick, the FCC
significantly loosened its regulation of the broadcasting and
telephone industries.
   It repealed the fairness doctrine for broadcasters, ended a
20-year-old regulatory scheme for American Telephone &amp; Telegraph Co.
and made other changes in broadcast licensing and ownership rules.
   Sikes and the commissioners fielded a long list of
not-too-difficult questions at the hearing, generally repeating
earlier statements that indicate they'll take a more moderate
free-market regulatory stance than did Patrick or Fowler.
   ``The public needs a firm basis to believe that its fundamental
interests are being adequately safeguarded,'' Sikes said.
   ``Those striving for commercial success in the marketplace,
moreover, need adequate assurance that their success or failure will
depend chiefly on their own talents and endeavor _ and not be
affected significantly by the actions of unconstrained monoploy
power.''
   Sikes' commission, still one member short, will face a number of
thorny issues, including moves in Congress to deregulate the local
Bell telephone companies; how best to ensure that a U.S.
high-definition television industry emerges; and how to re-allocate
scarce space on the airwaves.
   There was no opposition expressed during the hearing to the FCC's
spending request, which is about $10 million more than this year's
appropriation. The Senate is considering the same level of spending.

   Nobel laureate Mother Teresa developed
chest pains and a high fever Thursday, less than a week after
suffering a heart attack, and was in serious condition, doctors said.
   ``There is a heaviness in the chest. This is very serious,'' said
Dr. K.K. Sinha, a cardiologist at the Calcutta hospital where the
Roman Catholic nun is being treated.
   ``Very aggressive treatment is needed,'' he said. ``All
medication has been given, but she is allergic to some medicines.''
   Mother Teresa, 79, suffered a heart attack Sept. 8, three days
after she was admitted to the intensive care unit of the Woodlands
Nursing Home with an irregular heartbeat, a blocked artery and high
fever.
   Doctors said her condition improved after they attached a
temporary pacemaker and changed her medication. They had hoped to
remove the pacemaker by the end of the week.
   Another cardiologist, Dr. A.K. Bardhan, said the nun's heart
problems were complicated by a recurring high fever.
   ``If we can't get rid of the fever or if the fever continues to
rise, more complications are likely,'' said Bardhan, adding that
doctors were constantly monitoring her heartbeat and giving external
massage when necessary.
   ``She ate some ice cream this evening and now she's sleeping
restfully,'' he said.
   Two physicians _ Dr. Vincenzo Bilotta, a heart specialist from
Rome, and Dr. George Lombardi, an infectious disease specialist from
Cornell University in New York _ flew to Calcutta earlier in the
week to help with her treatment.
   ``We remain anxious but we are not pessimistic,'' said Bilotta,
who treated Mother Teresa for a similar ailment in 1985.
   Born in Yugoslavia, Mother Teresa has spent most of her adult
life caring for the destitute and dying in Calcutta's squalid slums.
   She founded the Missionaries of Charity in October 1950 in an
abandoned hostel donated by the city. The order, which was formally
recognized by the Vatican in 1965, expanded and now has 3,000 nuns
working in 87 countries.
   She won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1979.

   Actor Rob Lowe paid his debt to society this
week for his sex video by speaking to inmates at detention and
rehabilitation centers in his hometown, telling them to set goals
and ``believe in something.''
   George Waldo, a spokesman for the Georgia Department of Labor,
confirmed that Lowe served more than 20 hours of community service
Monday through Wednesday, giving formal and informal speeches to
Dayton inmates.
   Lowe's father, Chuck Lowe, a prominent Dayton attorney, helped
arrange the time with the Montgomery County probation office, Waldo
said.
   The star of such films as ``St. Elmo's Fire,'' who left Dayton 12
years ago, was back for the first time since he was accused of
making a sexually explicit videotape involving a teen-age girl
during the 1988 Democratic National Convention in Atlanta. A Georgia
court sentenced him to 20 hours of community service.
   He agreed to the community service to avoid possible criminal
action on allegations that he videotaped a 16-year-old girl in a sex
scene with a woman in an Atlanta hotel room.
   Lowe said he addressed youthful offenders in Project MonDay, a
program that provides job and education counseling to first-time,
non-violent offenders.
   ``I've been talking individually and in groups with people my age
who have been in trouble and saying to them, `Look, I went to the
same school that many of you did and I didn't know anybody who went
to Hollywood. I was lucky enough to have a dream, smart enough to
pursue it, and dumb enough not to know the odds (against being
successful).'
   ``I want them to have a goal, too, and to believe in something,
and that's basically been my message,'' Lowe told reporters.
   While in Ohio, Lowe also took a side trip to Cincinnati to visit
former Cincinnati Reds star Pete Rose.
   ``Pete's always been kind to me, great to me,'' Lowe said. ``We
both have had rough years. But friends are friends and I need
friends.''
   Rose last month was banned for life from major league baseball
after being accused of gambling on games involving his team. He can
appeal the ban after a year.

<TEXT>
   The American Civil Liberties Union has sued the
Chicago Transit Authority, alleging it arbitrarily rejected an AIDS
prevention ad as too explicit.
   The federal class-action lawsuit was filed Wednesday on behalf of
all groups wanting to put ads on public trains and buses. It charges
the agency with violating the constitutional rights of the Kupona
Network, the only black community organization in Chicago devoted
entirely to educating blacks about AIDS, said John Hammell, ACLU
Illinois director of the AIDS and Civil Liberties Project.
   ``Apparently one person or two persons at the CTA decided the
graphics were inappropriate,'' Hammell said. ``They have policies
which are applied arbitrarily, capriciously and in an invidious
discriminatory manner.''
   The ad features a drawing of two eyes, one reflecting the image
of a naked man and woman holding a condom package, the other an
image of a youth using drugs with a hypodermic syringe drawn
diagonally across the scene.
   The caption says ``Sex Without Condoms Plus Drug Abuse = AIDS.
AIDS in the Black Community is Very Real.''
   CTA spokeswoman Rosemarie Gulley said the ``ad was turned back
because the graphic art was far too explicit.'' She declined to
comment on the lawsuit.

   The Bush administration has banned import of
AK-47 assault-style rifles such as the one used in a shooting
rampage Thursday in Louisville, Ky., but similar weapons are still
available from U.S. companies.
   The administration imposed a temporary import suspension in March
after a public outcry over the Jan. 17 Stockton, Calif., schoolyard
killing of five children by a man wielding an AK-47.
   However, the ban, made permanent in July, doesn't affect guns
already owned by Americans or similar weapons produced by U.S.
companies.
   Joseph T. Wesbecker, who opened fire at Louisville's
Standard-Gravure Co. printing plant, appeared to be using
``half-banana clips'' of about 25 rounds each in an AK-47, said
Louisville Police Chief Richard Dotson.
   Such clips are curved and stick out the bottom of the weapon.
   Wesbecker, who committed suicide after the rampage, also had a
9mm semi-automatic pistol, Dotson said.
   President Bush announced a crime package in May that would limit
the size of ammunition clips to 15 rounds, but the Senate Judiciary
Committee hasn't voted on it.
   The committee has approved a measure by Sen. Dennis DeConcini,
D-Ariz., that would ban nine varieties of semiautomatic
assault-style weapons, five already covered by the administration's
import ban and four others produced domestically.
   DeConcini's bill, which would provide up to 10 years additional
prison time for those convicted of crimes involving firearms, would
go off the books in three years under a ``sunset'' provision.
   The Senate leadership hasn't brought the bill to the floor for a
vote.
   On Monday, American Bar Association President L. Stanley Chauvin
Jr. urged Bush to end the export of U.S.-made assault-style weapons
to Colombia, where 50 percent of sophisticated military equipment
seized from Colombian drug lords in the last 18 months was made in
the United States.
   The ban on imports of 43 styles of guns _ including the popular
Chinese-made AK-47 and Israeli-made Uzi carbine _ followed a
four-month study by the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms on
whether the weapons met the standards imposed by the Gun Control Act
of 1968, which barred importation of weapons not used for legitimate
sporting purposes.
   ``The study was undertaken because of the dramatic increase in
the number of these weapons being imported and police reports of
their use in violent crime,'' ATF Director Stephen E. Higgins said.
   The 43 models banned were ``not being used for sporting uses,''
the agency said.
   Higgins said the ATF annually traces 35,000 to 40,000 guns used
in crimes, and that about 10 percent are semiautomatic assault
weapons. He estimated that slightly more than half of those assault
weapons are domestic makes not subject to ATF control.

<HEAD>Dispute Over Town Bell Headed for Court</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HATFIELD, Mass. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A judge has agreed to decide whether the
hourly tolling of the bell in the town clock in this little farming
community is a melodious New England tradition or a noisy nuisance.
   Richard and Pamela Carnall, who moved next door to the
century-old clock last year, sued the town claiming the bell keeps
them awake at night.
   They failed in an effort to get selectmen to silence the clock
from 9 p.m. to 7 a.m. And the couple lost their bid for a
preliminary injunction silencing the clock in April, but Judge
George C. Keady Jr. said he will hear arguments on the nuisance
issue Oct. 5 in Hampshire Superior Court.
   Both sides have already made their case loud and clear in court
and on Main Street in this 319-year-old community of 3,200 people.
   The Carnalls contend they have been unable to adjust to the
bonging of the 1,800-pound bell on the First Congregational Church,
50 feet from their home.
   Carnall maintained he puts off going to bed until after midnight
_ when the bell tolls 12 times _ and said in a deposition that the
lack of sleep has made him ``more impatient, more argumentative and
less tolerant of others.''
   Dr. Donald B. Rogers of Northampton said he has prescribed
sleeping pills for Mrs. Carnall and maintained in a letter to the
judge that the bell is affecting her ``work and well-being.''
   But Hatfield Town Counsel William O'Neil contended that the sound
of the bell is simply part of life in a New England village and the
Carnalls, both born and raised in the area, should have noticed the
bell tower and considered that before buying their house.
   When the Carnalls bought their house in August 1988, the bell and
clock weren't working and they maintain they were unaware the bell
would resume tolling five months later.
   Selectmen contend the only previous complaints they have received
is when the bell hasn't sounded, and more than 200 townsfolk signed
petitions in support of the clock.
   Selectman George B. Zagrodnik, who grew up with the tolling and
still lives in the family home across the street from the church,
said some of his constituents have tartly pointed out that if the
town was to bow to the Carnalls, they ``just might decide that it's
a nuisance to have the town landfill by their place.''

   The Soviet Union reported Thursday that Israel had
launched a ballistic missile from the area around Jerusalem into the
Mediterranean north of Libya.
   The official Tass news agency, which issued the report, quoted
``data from the Ministry of Defense of the U.S.S.R.'' There was no
immediate comment from Israel.
   Tass said the missile had a range of 800 miles.

<HEAD>Lantos: Pierce Should Acknowledge `Horrible Mistakes'</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Former HUD Secretary Samuel Pierce should stop
defending his tenure and admit he made mistakes, the chairman of a
House panel investigating the agency said Thursday.
   ``If he continues to claim he has done nothing wrong and that
everything at HUD was right for the last 10 years, he will be very
lonely,'' said Rep. Thomas Lantos, D-Calif.
   Lantos' comments came on the eve of Pierce's return to testify
before a subcommittee investigating allegations of mismanagment and
influence-peddling at the Department of Housing and Urban
Development during his stewardship.
   ``I would hate to see an individual with a distinguished public
career prior to his service at HUD to sort of fade into American
memory in such an unfavorable light as he has done thus far,''
Lantos said.
   ``But he will have to do this for himself. ... He has not yet
said `mea culpa, mea maxima culpa, I have made horrible mistakes.'''
   Lantos and other panel members stopped short of accusing Pierce
of perjury during a May appearance before Congress, but said the
former secretary faced a formidable task in explaining his
involvement in a number of HUD decisions.
   ``Obviously we have sworn testimony that contradicts Secretary
Pierce's sworn testimony,'' Lantos said.
   Rep. Donald E. ``Buz'' Lukens of Ohio, the panel's ranking
Republican, said the committee wanted to hear Pierce ``address the
apparent inconsistencies.''
   Lukens said he was not prepared to judge whether Pierce had
perjured himself.
   ``It appears to me that while there has been greed and a great
deal of unfair and unethical favoritism that the only law that may
have been broken may be in the area of conflicting testimony,''
Lukens said.
   Pierce spent the day huddled with his lawyer, Paul Perito,
preparing for the hearing, the first by the subcommittee since
Congress returned from a summer recess.
   Perito did not immediately return a telephone call seeking
comment.
   Friday's hearing was to focus on Pierce's May testimony and his
decisions to fund a North Carolina project supported by a former law
partner and to lift restrictions on a mortgage company after he was
lobbied by former HUD Secretary Carla Hills, now the Bush
administration's trade representative.
   Pierce had said he was not a ``hands-on'' manager and took no
direct role in HUD funding decisions.
   A former deputy, however, later told Congress that Pierce
personally ordered her to fund a $15 million Durham, N.C., housing
project that was opposed by several career HUD officials.
   Pierce, in a Time magazine interview published this week,
acknowledged overruling staff and ordering the project funded. It
was supported by then Durham Mayor Charles Markham, who practiced
law with Pierce in the 1960s.
   Pierce likely will be questioned about his decision to lift
restrictions on Washington-based DRG Funding Corp., whose HUD loan
portfolio includes more than $538 million in defaults.
   Mrs. Hills met with Pierce after her lobbying of other HUD
officials failed, and he agreed to lift restrictions that required
DRG to get HUD approval before making any loans.
   ``Sam Pierce overruled the career people and now you and I and
the rest of American taxpayers are looking at a $538 million
portfolio which is in default,'' Lantos said.

   The Bush administration, yielding to
congressional pressures, was set today to announce a $50 million
increase in U.S. food aid to Poland, administration and
congressional sources said.
   The aid, to be made available during the fiscal year beginning
Oct. 1, is to include shipments of beef, pork, corn, butter, butter
oil, cotton and rice, according to the sources, who declined to be
identified.
   The aid is in addition to the $119 million aid package President
Bush announced earlier this summer, nearly half of which was
earmarked for food assistance.
   The new infusion of aid will bring the total food aid component
of the package to $100 million.
   Poland is obliged to repay the $50 million in this year's aid in
local currency. But the $100 million for fiscal 1990, which begins
Oct. 1, will be mostly in the form of grants _ or gifts, said a U.S.
official who spoke on condition of anonymity.
   He said the increase had been in the works for some time, but
that the announcement was sped up in light of congressional calls
for giving Poland more help.
   Senate Republican Leader Bob Dole of Kansas broached the subject
of additional food aid to Poland following talks with leaders of
Poland's new government in Warsaw last month.
   Dole met with Bush at the president's Kennebunkport, Maine, home
to urge additional assistance as a signal of support to the new
governement and continued to press the administration on it as
recently as today.
   Several other House and Senate members also have called on the
administration to increase aid to Poland or have introduced
legislation outlining their own assistance plans.
   As the White House prepared the announcement, State Department
officials extended assurances to Poland and its congressional
supporters.
   ``The Polish government can count on our continued support,''
said department spokesman Richard Boucher. He said the emergence of
the Solidarity labor movement as in control of the government was a
``key factor'' in a situation that he described as evolving.
   ``We felt that additional measures might be appropriate and we
are seriously considering some,'' Boucher said.
   Some members of Congress are pushing the White House to increase
U.S. assistance in order to help the Warsaw government cope with its
adjustment to a new economic system that has some elements of
capitalism.
   The president and his advisers are eager for the economic and
political changes in Poland, and Bush traveled to Warsaw and Gdansk
this summer to symbolize U.S. support. But the predominant view
within the administration is that Poland should demonstrate its
ability to make the transition and to hold down inflaion before more
U.S. aid is committed.
   Lech Walesa, the Solidarity leader whose non-communist trade
union movement commands a dominant role in the Warsaw government, is
due to visit Washington in November.
   Walesa has called for $10 billion in emergency assistance,
including $2.7 billion from the International Monetary Fund, $3
billion from the World Bank and $4.1 billion in new bilateral
credits.

<HEAD>Legislator's Bill Would Bar Inmates from Being Jailers, Dispatchers</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   In Mississippi, a rape victim reporting the
crime to the sheriff's office could end up talking to a dispatcher
doing time for rape himself.
   And because state law doesn't spell out what jobs felons are
allowed to do in jail, someone arrested on a drug charge could
discover the man with custody of the keys on that shift is serving a
sentence for peddling dope.
   Although it is uncertain how many convicted felons actually
perform important duties, such as dispatcher or jailer,
unsupervised, Rep. J.B. Van Slyke says he plans to introduce a bill
next legislative session to make the practice illegal.
   ``I do not favor an inmate taking care of the jail or being a
dispatcher, not at all,'' Van Slyke said.
   Lafayette County Sheriff F.D. East, president of the Mississippi
Sheriffs Association, said he informally polled about 20 sheriffs on
their policies on assigning felons after the issue was raised. He
said there were some counties that use felons for responsible jobs,
but he declined to identify them.
   Most counties regularly use inmates for traditional work such as
cleaning up and cooking, he said.
   In the 1970s, a federal court ordered major reforms of the state
prison system, including a ban on convicted murderers serving as
armed guards. But the law does not ban state prisoners who are
serving their time in county jails from serving as unarmed jailers,
officials said.
   Ken Jones, a spokesman for the State Corrections Department, said
more than 1,200 of Mississippi's roughly 8,000 state prisoners are
being held in county jails because of overcrowding at state
facilities.
   ``We know of no ruling or any law that prohibits the use of
inmates, for instance, as jailers,'' Jones said. ``It really falls
back to the sheriff to use his good judgment in the assignment of
inmates to work details.''
   The issue came to Van Slyke's attention after Wiggins Mayor
Ferris O'Neal recently accused Stone County Sheriff Eldon Ladner of
using inmates as jailers and dispatchers, sometimes unsupervised.
   ``I feel it is a threat and danger to the citizens of Wiggins and
Stone County,'' O'Neal said. ``I am 100 percent in favor of inmates
working, but there are a lot of other things they can do than man
the communication system unsupervised.''
   Ladner has declined to comment on O'Neal's accusations, but Van
Slyke said Ladner told him he used inmates as dispatchers, but not
as jailers.
   The legislator said he wasn't aware of any problems in the past
caused by inmates holding such positions of responsibility, but he's
concerned about the potential for tragedy.
   Lauderdale County Chief Deputy Mike Vick said his county is among
several which have used inmates to assist jailers and dispatchers
when the regular staff was stretched tight. Prisoners never have
served on a daily basis in such responsible roles, and do not work
unsupervised, he said.
   ``They have been used in the past to assist dispatchers if there
was a major situation going on like a gasoline spill or train
derailment,'' Vick said.
   ``Basically, if you've got inmate labor there's always a
potential for problems,'' Vick acknowledged. ``But being a trusty is
a privilege, not a right. So if you have problems with an inmate,
you lock him up..''
   East said if any sheriffs use convicted felons in positions of
responsibility, it is only because tight finances have forced them
into a corner.
   ``If they pass any law, they should pass a law saying you have to
have enough deputies and people to run the jails,'' East said. ``The
bottom line is, we don't want state inmates anyway.
   ``No money is why we have state prisoners in county jails
anyway,'' he added.

<TEXT>
   Thirty-four white men turned down for firefighting
jobs though they had perfect scores on a civil service exam sued
Thursday to force the department to adopt a color-blind hiring
policy.
   Spurred by a recent U.S. Supreme Court decision paving the way
for such lawsuits, the plaintiffs said they were seeking a court
ruling allowing them to be hired.
   ``We're not trying to deprive anybody,'' said plaintiff Larry
Mackin. ``We just want the best man to win.''
   ``It's not as if we're asking for positions of power or money. We
just want to do a very dangerous job that we've always wanted to
do,'' he said.
   Boston has long been under a federal consent decree requiring it
to hire one minority for every white to ensure the police and fire
departments reflect the city's ethnic makeup.
   The hiring policy is important to ``quality of life in the
city,'' City Councilor Bruce Bolling argued. The city's fire and
police departments are about 20 percent minority and 80 percent
white, according to Bolling, who is black and has been a longtime
proponent of affirmative action programs.
   ``The consent decree addresses the issue of ensuring that there
would be a more equitable process in which minorities have access to
these critical jobs,'' he said.
   But Mackin said the policy has foiled his efforts to become a
firefighter for 12 years. He said he always scored well on the civil
service exam, ``but not well enough for a white candidate.''
   In 1987 he scored perfectly on the exam _ the last the
32-year-old could take because of an age limit _ and thought for
certain he'd realized his dream.
   Again he was passed over because, he says, of the city's efforts
to hire minorities.
   Michael Powers, an attorney for the plaintiffs, said he would not
have been able to bring the suit were it not for the Supreme Court
rulng in June allowing white men to challenge court-approved
affirmative action programs.
   The ruling, widely criticized by civil rights groups, revived a
challenge to a program to promote more blacks in the Birmingham,
Ala., fire department.
   To Mackin and the other plaintiffs, the Boston policy
discriminated against them by allowing minorities with lower scores
to join the ranks while they've been left behind.
   ``They've not only leaned over backwards, but they've twisted and
perverted the whole system so a white kid doesn't stand a chance,''
Mackin said.
   The lawsuit charges the city, the department, Mayor Raymond
Flynn, Fire Commissioner Leo Stapleton and David Haley, the state
personnel administrator, with violating the white applicants' civil
rights and seeks to halt the hiring policy.
   Powers, a former legal adviser to the Boston Police Department,
said he is confident he'll be able to get the men positions with the
fire department and also plans to file a similar lawsuit against the
police.
   Attorneys for the city said they could not immediately comment on
the suit.
   Mackin said that if he isn't hired, he hopes to at least to force
the department to adopt a ``color-blind'' hiring policy.
   ``If my son chooses to become a firefighter or a police officer,
and he can take the exam and be judged on his merits and be judged
on his competence, then that'll be enough,'' he said.

<HEAD>Administration, ACLU Oppose Federal `Boot Camps'</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Bush administration official and the American
Civil Liberties Union took a nearly identical stance Thursday
against proposed legislation to establish federal ``boot camp''
prisons for young offenders.
   J. Michael Quinlan, director of the Bureau of Prisons, told a
House Justice subcommittee that the administration supports the
concept on the state level, but contends it wouldn't work on a
federal level.
   ``The success of these programs is yet undetermined,'' he said,
referring to the nine states with special programs for non-violent,
youthful first offenders in which rigorous military discipline and
physical training play a role.
   Claudia Wright, associate director of the ACLU national prison
project, agreed.
   ``A good deal more thought and research should be done before
deciding that the `boot camp' concept will be a viable alternative
form of incarceration for the federal prison system,'' she told the
panel.
   President Bush was often at odds with the ACLU during his 1988
campaign, accusing the group of being out of the mainstream of
American values.
   Subcommittee Chairman Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., who introduced the
boot-camp legislation, said the camps could be a ``powerful new
weapon'' in the war on drugs.
   The bill calls for any able-bodied, first-time offender with a
prison term of 12 months to 16 months to be eligible, with each day
in camp counting as four days in prison. The program would be open
to all prisoners, not just drug offenders.
   Quinlan said only 60 of 50,000 federal prisoners would meet the
criteria. However, Quinlan said that could change as a result of the
administration's desire to arrest more drug users and that the
bureau might then reconsider its opposition.
   He also indicated support for sending federal prisoners to state
boot camps under contract.
   Ms. Wright called it ``grossly inappropriate'' to compare the
effects of prison boot camps with those of military basic training.
   ``To serve in the military provides young people with a sense of
pride and achievement which remains with them throughout their
lives,'' she said. ``That sense of pride comes not from having
survived a demeaning experience, but from the patriotism, esprit de
corps and sense of purpose that is instilled by serving one's
country as part of a proud tradition.''
   Commissioner Thomas Coughlin of the New York Department of
Correctional Services said his state's 2-year-old program includes
drug treatment and education, not just military routine.

   East Germans made a last-minute dash for
the border Thursday, with more than 100 per hour reported crossing
into Austria in fear the Iron Curtain's hole to the West might close
again soon.
   Hungarian authorities said they had no plans to stop the exodus,
which has prompted East Germans in Poland and Czechoslovakia to seek
refuge in West German embassies in hopes they too will get to go
West.
   Poland's Foreign Ministry confirmed that some East Germans were
at the West German Embassy in Warsaw. About 150 East Germans were
reported in the West German Embassy in Prague, Czechoslovakia.
   The Vatican newspaper praised Hungary's move, but a
pro-Solidarity newspaper in Poland cautioned against Warsaw
following Hungary's example.
   After a brief letup in the refugee flow Wednesday, Austria's
Interior Ministry reported Thursday that 100 East Germans an hour
were arriving en route to West Germany.
   West German border officials said more than 700 new refugees
arrived overnight. Aid workers in Budapest, where would-be emigrants
register before going West, said at least 13,000 people had crossed
since early Monday.
   The East Germans are automatically granted citizenship in West
Germany and have been put up in camps and given assistance finding
housing and jobs.
   The reform-minded Communist government in Hungary opened its
border to Austria at midnight Sunday, ending a weeks-long standoff
that began when thousands of East Germans flooded the West German
Embassy in Budapest seeking legal emigration.
   Many had come to Hungary in May, after the country began
dismantling barbed wire and other barriers along its westernmost
border, and had been caught trying to cross to the West illegally.
They feared they would be punished if they returned to their
homeland.
   West Germany's ARD television network reported rumors Hungary
would close the border soon, but government spokesman Zsolt Bajnok
said he knew of no such plans.
   Bajnok quoted Foreign Minister Gyula Horn as saying Thursday that
``no decision has been made'' on stopping the flow of East Germans.
   East Germany accused Hungary of breaking an accord prohibiting
unauthorized departures to the West of residents of the Warsaw Pact
countries, and it filed a formal protest.
   Hungary's Foreign Ministry said the government let the East
Germans go in accordance with a U.N. human rights accord that
outweighed its agreement with East Germany.
   The ministry, in a statement carried by the official MTI news
agency, also said the 1969 East German-Hungarian accord contained a
secret article invalidating the agreement ``if conditions change
fundamentally.''
   ``The conditions had changed fundamentally'' it said, referring
to the influx of East Germans. It indicated the borders would remain
open to East Germans as long as masses of them want to cross.
   ``Considering that the causes underlying the decision of the
Hungarian Peoples' Republic have not changed, the Hungarian party
cannot consider rescinding the decision at present,'' it said.
   MTI quoted a senior Hungarian Communist official, Maria Ormos, as
telling Politburo member Kurt Hager that Hungary opened its borders
because ``it was unable to cope with the thousands of East German
citizens.''
   Emotions in East Berlin appeared to cool Thursday, with the
Communist Party daily Neues Deutschland refraining from criticism of
Hungary for the first time since the refugee flood began.
   But several East Germans in Budapest said their countrymen at
home feared the East German leadership was planning to crack down on
travel to Hungary, which has been relatively unrestricted.
   ``I know four people who are weighing whether to apply for
visas,'' said a woman in her 30s from Dresden. ``But they're scared
that even applying could get them into trouble.''
   Many of those fleeing have said they're doing so out of
frustration with political rigidity and repression. Others have
expressed hopes of earning a better living in West Germany.
   East Germans reportedly began arriving at the West German Embassy
in Poland several weeks ago.
   One 9-year-old boy interviewed on Polish television said there
were about 60 people housed inside a large room of the embassy.
Laundry could be seen hanging in the embassy yard, and several young
men lounged and read in the embassy courtyard. One raised his
fingers in a ``V'' for victory sign.
   Ministry spokesman Stefan Staniszewski said Thursday officials
hoped to resolve the problem ``in a few days.''
   The pro-Solidarity daily Gazeta Wyborcza said that because Poland
is a much bigger country and is in a more difficult geopolitical
situation than Hungary, it should be cautious.
   ``Hungary's attitude may evoke sympathy, but as a state we should
not follow their example or even praise them loudly,'' the
commentary said.
   Poland is bordered by Communist East Germany, Czechoslovakia and
the Soviet Union, while Hungary shares a border with neutral Austria.
   The Vatican newspaper L'Osservatore Romano said Hungary had
recently introduced political and social reforms that were inspired
by ``the demands of the fundamental rights of man and by the
inalienable dignity of the human person.''

<TEXT>
   The Senate sent President Bush legislation on
Thursday providing $225 million to start building a city-sized atom
smasher in Texas that scientists hope will lead them to the
universe's most basic materials.
   The money, for construction and research on the superconducting
super collider, is just the start of what is expected to ultimately
be a federal infusion of up to $5 billion for the project. The
facility could take up to seven years to build.
   On a voice vote, lawmakers approved an $18.6 billion measure
financing energy and water programs for next year. It contains the
money for the super collider.
   Bush, whose official residence is in Texas, is expected to sign
the measure.
   The legislation was the first of the 13 annual spending bills for
fiscal 1990 to receive final congressional approval.
   The circular, 53-mile-long super collider is to be built 25 miles
south of Dallas. Scientists will use it to hurtle proton beams into
each other in a search for the basic building blocks of matter.
   The legislation also contains $1.6 billion for cleaning up the
nation's nuclear weapons plants, about 70 percent more than the $975
million provided this year and 27 percent more than Bush requested.
The overall task of removing radioactive waste from the facilities,
accumulating for more than 40 years, has been estimated at $100
billion.
   The cleanup money is just part of $9.7 billion the measure
provides for atomic energy defense programs, including weapons
construction.
   Also tucked into the bill are water projects lawmakers can bring
home to their districts. The measure finances 33 new projects by the
Senate's count, triple the administration's request.
   Overall, it provides $3.2 billion for Army Corps of Engineers
water programs and $977 million for Bureau of Reclamation projects,
both figures representing 2 percent reductions from this year.
   The legislation also provides $2.2 billion for energy research.
   The House had passed an $18.54 billion version of the bill June
28, while the Senate approved an $18.45 billion measure July 27. The
differences were worked out in a conference committee of negotiators
from both houses.

   Insurgents said Thursday they stopped
two government supply convoys that had tried to run a guerrilla
blockade of the highway that links the capital to the Soviet Union.
   The government released a captured 33-year-old French aid worker
Thursday after keeping him prisoner for a month.
   Masoud Khalili, a spokesman for the Jamiat-i-Islami guerrilla
group, said in Islamabad, Pakistan, that insurgents sent two
government resupply convoys limping back to Charikar, the provincial
capital of Afghanistan's central Parwan province.
   Nine government tanks were destroyed Monday in the first attack
on the Salang Highway, Khalili said.
   ``Smoke and fire could be seen several kilometers away,'' he
said. On Tuesday, two military vehicles and a tank were destroyed
before a second convoy retreated, he said.
   The convoys were moving north to outfit government garrisons
protecting the Salang, Khalili said.
   Details of the attacks, led by guerrilla commander Ahmad Shah
Masoud, were relayed to the guerrilla group's headquarters in
Pakistan, Khalili said.
   There was no confirmation from the Kabul government.
   Khalili said Masoud has mapped out a 30-mile battle zone along
the Salang Highway. This area includes one of the government's
largest military air bases at Bagram, six miles southeast of
Charikar and about 30 miles north of the Afghan capital of Kabul.
   Successive rebel attacks against the Kabul airport have increased
the communist government reliance on Bagram to offload military
supplies from the Soviets. The Soviets have increased arms shipments
to Kabul since the last Red Army troops pulled out of Afghanistan on
Feb. 15.
   In Kabul, Afghan officials released Henri-Xavier Lemire, an
employee of the humanitarian organization Handicap International.
Lemire was captured Aug. 14 while traveling with a guerrilla convoy
from Pakistan.
   Lemire told a news conference that a colleague, Vincent Gernigon,
was killed when government troops fired on the convoy near the
village of Marja, 95 miles west of the southern provincial capital
of Kandahar.
   Lemire was wounded by three pieces of shrapnel and had been held
in a government hospital.
   The aid workers were delivering prosthetic devices, wheelchairs
and other orthopedic equipment, he said. Many Afghans have lost legs
in mine blasts during 11 years of fighting between the U.S.-backed
guerrillas and the pro-Soviet government.
   Lemire, dressed in green-and-white striped hospital pajamas and
carrying a towel, said he was informed that he would be released
just 45 minutes before the news conference.
   ``I want to eat and see my family,'' he said.
   Government spokesman Mohammad Nabi Amani said President Najib
released Lemire after appeals by President Francois Mitterrand of

   The Pentagon said Thursday that seven U.S.
military teams are training local forces in the Andean nations'
anti-drug battle, but insisted the Americans will not be sent
``where there is great risk.''
   Pentagon spokesman Pete Williams also announced that Defense
Secretary Dick Cheney plans to outline a ``forward leaning'' role
for the Pentagon next week under President Bush's plan for fighting
the nation's drug problem.
   Revealing additional details about the role of U.S. military
forces in Latin America, Williams said there are three U.S. military
training teams in Peru, and two each in Colombia and Bolivia helping
training local forces.
   ``Those are the counter-narcotics training teams under the Andean
strategy,'' Williams said.
   There are no such teams in any other South American nation, he
said.
   Williams described the teams as providing ``specific equipment
training, but they also provide tactical training as well.''
   A secret national security directive signed by Bush last month
has allowed for an expansion of the training role for the U.S.
forces, allowing them to leave their bases and train local forces in
so-called ``secure areas'' in the region.
   Williams declined to offer a definitive number of persons in the
three nations, saying the number would vary depending upon the type
of training mission under way at any given time.
   He would say only that currently, there are fewer than 50 persons
involved.
   ``There's no magic number, no magic ceiling,'' he said, adding
that each team may number anywhere from two to 12 persons each.
   The spokesman emphasized, as he has for weeks, that the teams
have been sent to the nations at their request and that the
``decision to deploy'' is made on a case-by-case basis.
   ``No military training teams are going to be sent into an area in
which they would face great risk. That is part of the assessment
that would be made in these case-by-case judgements,'' Williams said.
   Bush and other top administration officials have repeatedly
denied that the U.S. forces sent to aid the Latin nations would
enter combat.
   Williams said the Pentagon did not want to say where the units
were coming from, or their exact locations in the host countries,
``because of security reasons.''
   The spokesman also said Cheney planned to discuss details of the
Pentagon's role in the president's anti-drug battle on Monday, and
said the secretary has described it as ``a forward leaning'' type of
plan.
   Pentagon sources, who spoke on condition that they not be
identified, said a preliminary draft indicated that the secretary
wants to beef up radar and commications efforts along U.S. borders
to monitor drug traffickers and increase the number of naval and air
patrols in the Caribbean.
   ``There's a lot of holes out there that need to be patched,'' the
official said, speaking on condition he not be identified.

<HEAD>Administration Opposes Farmer Exemption</HEAD>

   The Bush administration on Thursday opposed a
House bill that would exempt farmers from paying royalties on
patented animals created by genetic engineering.
   One official said his department would license others to use an
enginereed chicken even though it wasn't patented.
   A bill sponsored by Rep. Robert Kastenmeier, D-Wis., is intended
to respond to concerns among farmers that corporate control of
patents will lead to corporate control of agriculture, creating a
modern version of sharecropping.
   A similar bill by Kastenmeier passed the House last year, but the
Senate took no action.
   Representatives of the Agriculture, Commerce and Health and Human
Services departments told Kastenmeier's House Judiciary subcommittee
on courts, intellectual property and the administration of justice
that patents on so-called transgenic animals are the only way to
guarantee that anyone will invest in research on the technique.
   The genetically engineered animals are necessary for biomedical
research, development of resistant crops and farm animals, and
ultimately for international competition, the three said.
   The exemption in Kastenmeier's bill would allow farmers to
reproduce a patented animal through breeding or sell a patented
animal or its offspring without paying a fee, or royalty, to the
patent holder _ in effect, an automatic license for farmers.
   The sale of germ cells, semen or embryos from a patented animal
would remain prohibited as patent infringements.
   Daniel Jones, deputy director for biotechnology at the
Agriculture Department, said the department has applied for a
``statutory invention registration'' with the Patent Office for a
strain of transgenic chickens it developed resistant to the poultry
disease avian leukosis.
   Such registration preempts others from obtaining patents but does
allow others to use the invention.
   ``This arrangement may provide a useful opportunity to gather
data on the potential economic demand, distribution, and performance
of a transgenic animal before livestock and poultry producers are
faced with an onslaught of new strains and varieties whose economic
impacts cannot now be predicted,'' he said.
   Donald J. Quigg, assistant Commerce secretary and commissioner of
patents and trademarks, told the subcommittee, ``Neither the
imposition of compulsory licensing nor a moratorium on the patenting
of inventions pertaining to the field of transgenic animals is in
the national interest.''
   Compulsory licensing is an idea advanced by a number of Third
World countries who say they can use an invention _ a drug for
instance _ for which a patent exists but the holder does not wish to
produce.
   Those licenses, however, would involve some royalty payment.
   The world's first animal patent was issued in April 1988 to
researchers at Harvard Medical School for a mouse genetically
engineered for use in cancer research.

   Former state Senate President Dan
Tonkovich confessed to extortion Thursday, then praised the federal
prosecutor who pursued him and has forced a slew of high state
officials into disgrace.
   Tonkovich, 43, of Benwood pleaded guilty to a felony extortion
charge during the sixth day of his trial. He also agreed to be a
government witness in further proceedings.
   In the last 10 months, U.S. Attorney Michael Carey's staff has
convicted or forced pleas from Tonkovich; former Senate President
Larry Tucker; former Senate Majority Leader Si Boettner; and former
Del. Robert McCormick. Treasurer A. James Manchin and Attorney
General Charlie Brown, both of whom resigned in separate scandals
this year, are being investigated by Carey's office.
   ``It's just another brick out of the building,'' Carey said of
Tonkovich's plea. ``The whole thing is starting to crumble.''
   The investigation continues, Carey added. ``Prosecution of this
type of conduct is a high priority of this office.''
   Tonkovich, a failed 1988 Democratic primary gubernatorial
candidate, pleaded guilty to a one-count charge that he extorted
$5,000 from casino gambling interests in 1986. His case had been
shattered Wednesday when his 1987 tax return and his amended 1988
income tax returns were admitted into evidence. The returns showed
he had used a $15,000 payoff to his benefit.
   Tonkovich faces a maximum of 20 years in prison and $250,000 in
fines when U.S. District Court Judge John T. Copenhaver Jr. at
sentencing Nov. 16.
   Tonkovich, his eyes red with tears, had his arm around his
weeping wife, Nancy, as they left the courtroom. He did not talk to
reporters, but his lawyer, James B. Lees Jr., delivered a statement.
   ``I think, both Dan Tonkovich and I believe, Mike Carey has done
an excellent job in West Virginia and I think that West Virginia
needs the type of actions that Mr. Carey is engaging in,'' Lees
said. ``I think this state needs (to be) cleaned up.''
   Federal prosecutors said Tonkovich extorted three $5,000 payments
from the West Virginia Casino Co. in exchange for his help on casino
gambling legislation. The law was never enacted.
   Tonkovich had previously admitted taking the money, but claimed
it was to do polling work for the company. He also put the contract
in the name of his aide, Bob Cain. Under editorial criticism of the
polling company, Tonkovich handed the money back in June 1986.
   But on his 1987 income tax return, admitted as evidence over
Lees' objections, Tonkovich claimed the $15,000 as a bad debt loss
to Cain. After the federal investigation opened in October 1988,
Tonkovich filed an amended return in November repudiating the debt
claim.
   Lees advised Tonkovich to change his plea to guilty after the
income tax material was admitted. Negotiations were completed with
Carey's office late Wednesday night and the plea was entered
Thursday morning.
   West Virginia Casino was created by a group of Margate, N.J.,
investors headed by Fred Perone. Perone could not be contacted at
his office.
   In addition to the two other extortion charges dropped, the court
dismissed charges of attempted extorton of officials of Resorts
International Inc. of Atlantic City, N.J., in 1986, and insurance
representatives in 1988. Also dismissed was a general racketeering
charge of running a criminal enterprise out of Tonkovich's Senate
office.
   Tonkovich had faced 120 years in prison and $1.5 million in fines
if convicted on all charges.

   Israeli helicopter gunships blasted rockets
at two Palestinian guerrilla bases east of Sidon in a raid Thursday
night, police and witnesses said.
   At least three guerrillas were wounded in the attack on Ein
el-Hilweh camp on the eastern flank of the city 25 miles south of
Beirut, police said.
   Israel's army command in Jerusalem said its air force hit a base
of terrorist mastermind Abu Nidal and that all aircraft returned
safely to base.
   Witnesses requesting anonymity said three Cobra helicopters flew
low from the Mediterranean to attack their targets at 9:30 p.m. The
witnesses said the helicopters fired at least four rockets into the
camp.
   Three of the rockets exploded on a base of the
Fatah-Revolutionary Council, the powerful faction led by Abu Nidal,
who also is called Sabri al-Banna.
   The fourth projectile hit a nearby battery manned by guerrillas
of George Habash's Marxist Popular Front for the Liberation of
Palestine.
   It was not immediately clear which guerrillas were wounded
because their comrades quickly sealed the area.
   It was Israel's 12th air attack on Lebanon this year. By police
count, 17 people have been killed and 98 wounded in previous
strikes, the last Sept. 4 on Majdal Balhis, a tiny village in the
Syrian-policed Bekaa valley.
   That attack was directed against the Libyan-backed Popular Front
for the Liberation of Palestine-General Command. Four guerrillas
were wounded.
   Habash's Damascus-based group, the second-largest Palestine
Liberation Organization faction after Fatah, has claimed
responsibility for at least two recent attacks against Israel.
   Last week it said its guerrillas blasted rockets across the
Jordanian-Israeli border. The projectiles crashed into fields in the
northern Jordan valley, causing no damage or casualties.
   On Sunday, the group said it had a shootout with an Israeli
patrol in Israel's self-designated ``security zone'' in south
Lebanon. One Israeli soldier and a guerrilla were killed in the
gunbattle.
   Israel carved the 6- to 10-mile-wide zone, stretching from the
foothills of Mount Hermon to the Mediterranean, when it withdrew the
bulk of its forces at the end of a three-year invasion of Lebanon.

<HEAD>De Klerk Elected President, Faces Right-Wing Criticism</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   CAPE TOWN, South Africa _ National Party leader F.W. de Klerk was
elected Thursday to a five-year term as president and was criticized
immediately by conservative opponents for allowing a protest that
drew an estimated 20,000 people.
   Police allowed two smaller protests to go on Thursday, even
giving flowers to leaders of one march. Anti-apartheid leaders
announced plans for more activity Friday.
   The Electoral College, dominated by Parliament members of the
National Party, cast a unanimous vote for de Klerk, one day after
the march in Cape Town. It was the largest legal protest march in
South Africa's history.
   Moolman Mentz, spokesman for the Conservative Party, the largest
parliamentary opposition, said approval of the Cape Town march was
``a knife thrust in the back'' of the security forces. Mentz called
for immediate Parliamentary debate.
   In a rare move, the anti-apartheid Democratic Party voted with
the Nationalists to defeat the Conservatives' motion.
   In carrying out his stated policy to allow peaceful protest, de
Klerk faces opposition not only from right-wing parties but from the
security establishment that enjoyed wide powers under former
President P.W. Botha.
   As de Klerk addressed the Electoral College, anti-apartheid
organizations announced that more demonstrations and marches were
planned in Pretoria and Johannesburg on Friday.
   De Klerk, 53, has been acting president since Aug. 15, a day
after he and other Cabinet ministers pressured Botha to resign after
11 years in power. De Klerk is to be inaugurated Wednesday in a
Pretoria church.
   De Klerk, whose party was elected by white voters, declared
himself the leader of all South Africans, ``not only those
represented in Parliament.''
   ``Our goal is that all South Africans, in a just and equitable
manner, become part of the decision-making processes of South
Africa,'' de Klerk said.
   South Africa's 28 million blacks, the majority, have no vote.
   Emergency regulations imposed to quell racial unrest have allowed
police to ban all outdoor rallies; anti-government meetings in
churches, universities or private homes; speeches they consider
subversive; and news coverage of protests and police action. They
also permit police to detain anyone without charge.
   Newspapers say there is division in the Cabinet on how to handle
peaceful protests.
   Foreign Minister Pik Botha and Finance Minister Barend du Plessis
critized police action in whipping blacks off a white beach during
the election campaign, while Minister of Law and Order Adriaan Vlok
defended the action.
   Vlok said in Thursday's Parliament debate that the organizers of
unrest over the past six weeks ``and no one else'' were to blame for
the deaths of innocent people during the election, but he
acknowledged police action had resulted in injuries and deaths.
   He said an investigation was being conducted into allegations of
police misconduct in mixed-race and black areas around Cape Town on
election day.
   Police were ordered to stay away from the center of Cape Town
during the march Wednesday, which was held to protest police
brutality.
   The Star, the nation's largest daily newspaper, said it had
learned the decision was made over objections from security
officials.
   ``Opinion in government quarters was that the go-ahead for the
march was an important signal to the security establishment that the
excessive influence in enjoyed during the P.W. Botha era was on the
wane,'' the newspaper said.
   The Rev. Allan Boesak, president of the World Alliance of
Reformed Churches, appeared optimistic about de Klerk's election.
``At last we have someone who is more pragmatic than ideological.
This may herald something better for the future,'' he said.
   How the police react in coming days may shape de Klerk's chances
of getting black leaders to negotiate with the government.
   In Grahamstown, in eastern Cape province, a few hundred students,
academics and community residents marched from Rhodes University to
the police station Thursday to protest the state of emergency. The
leaders were given a small bouquet of flowers by a policewoman.
   In Mitchell's Plain, a mixed-race township near Cape Town, where
white riot police used whips and batons on anti-election
demonstrators Sept. 5, youths demonstrated in front of the police
station without incident.
   Earlier, they held a rally in honor of Lt. Gregory Rockman, a
mixed-race lieutenant who has become a folk hero for publicly
condemning the riot squad's actions.

   More and more children are dropping out of school
in China to work in fields and factories, adding to a literacy
crisis that is an unwelcome spinoff of economic reforms.
   Recent reports say more than one-fifth of China's population, or
220 million people, cannot read.
   Most of the country's 7.15 million dropouts are girls, and 70
percent of the country's illiterates are women, official newspapers
say.
   The illiteracy rate has dropped from 80 percent to 22 percent
since the Communists took over 40 years ago, said a recent series in
the Legal News Daily.
   But the nation's educational level is deteriorating again as more
students abandon their classrooms.
   Legal News Daily said 1,332 middle school and elementary school
pupils dropped out over a two-month period in one county of coastal
Fujian province. About 1 million students have quit in the past year
in Sichuan, China's most populous province.
   The People's Daily reported about 2.5 million village children in
Henan province are not attending school. There are about 180 million
primary and middle school students in China.
   Children leave school to work in the fields, be maids or factory
workers in the city, or help in relatives' private enterprises, the
report said.
   China has compulsory education through the ninth grade, but many
students are defying the regulation, often with encouragement from
parents.
   Economic reforms, including the return of the family farm and the
phenomenal growth of rural industries in the past decade, have
fueled the need for labor.
   In Fujian, authorities found 2,322 children younger than 16 in a
day's raids on factories. Among them, 164 could not read.
   In a textile factory in Bobai County in southern Guangxi
province, all 40 workers were children.
   Legal News quoted a school administrator as commenting on a job
advertisement: ``This is the chance to get a good job. If the kids
cannot advance to high school and they miss this recruitment, we
will be blamed for ruining their future.''
   Teachers, among the lowest paid of Chinese government workers,
also are dropping out.
   In Fujian, the paper said, 853 teachers have resigned and 148
schools have closed since May.
   A survey showed that among 12 occupations in China, teachers are
among the lowest paid and have the worst living and medical
facilities.
   Chinese media have reported some teachers are forced to sell
bread and soft drinks to supplement their income. In Shanghai, many
have stopped teaching and spend all their time as salesmen,
interpreters, even singers.
   China Youth News reported that among 7,000 students entering
universities from northeast China's Jilin province, only six wanted
to go to teacher training college.
   It said a parent pleaded with one college administrator, ``Please
do not accept my child. Enrollment in a teachers university means
committing suicide.''
   This year, in the week leading up to the annual Sept. 10 Teachers
Day, seminars were held throughout the country to boost the status
and morale of teachers. Model teachers were given plaques, flags and
discounts for clothes and haircuts.
   Legal News Daily said such rewards hardly would satisfy most
young Chinese. It cited the case of a university student who
advertised for a wife. A young woman wrote back: ``You cannot eat
culture or spend idealism like money ... If you have a wife,
dissuade your kids from going to college. Studying until the fifth
grade is enough. Tell him to get rich by selling fish.''

<HEAD>Studies Say 20 Percent of Adults Are Fat, Posing Major Health Risk</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PAUL RECER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Science Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   About 20 percent of the adult population, some
33 million Americans, are significantly overweight, giving the
United States one of the highest populations of fat people in the
world, an obesity expert said Thursday.
   ``It's clear that significant obesity appears to be more
prevalent in the United States than elsewhere,'' said Dr. George A.
Bray, a professor of medicine at Louisiana State University and a
leading researcher in obesity.
   Significant obesity is a major health problem only in Europe and
North America, and Bray said the problem is more severe in the
United States than in Europe.
   Why so many American adults are fat isn't clear, he said, but the
effects are showing up among the obese as more heart attacks, more
high blood pressure, more diabetes and more gall bladder disease.
   Being extremely fat, said Bray, is only slightly less of a health
risk than smoking two packs of cigarettes a day.
   Bray, president-elect of the North American Association for the
Study of Obesity, said doctors consider significant obesity to be a
weight about 30 percent above what would be ideal for a person's
age, height and gender.
   Thus, a man whose ideal weight should be 170 to 180 pounds would
be ``signficiantly'' obese if his weight was 221 to 234. At that
point, his weight would make him almost twice as likely to develop a
life shortening ailment, Bray said.
   ``The greater the excess weight, the greater excess risk,'' he
said.
   But the numbers on the weight scale don't tell the full story.
   ``It's not just how fat you are, but where the fat is located,
that will determine your risk,'' said Bray.
   It is now widely believed by researchers that fat located within
the abdominal cavity, surrounding the viscera, poses an greater
hazard to health than fat located in the extremities or just under
the skin.
   ``The reasons for this are not clear,'' said Bray. ``The most
widely accepted explanation is that when you've got more fat in your
belly around your organs, it is that fat that is released when you
eat fatty acids.''
   Because of its proximity, such fat is thought to go directly to
the liver, he said, where ``it sets up risk factors that we
associate with heart disease, diabetes, hypertension and gall
bladder disease.''
   Adult men, said Bray, seem to be most at risk of developing this
unhealthy deposit of abdominal fat. Age also plays a factor, he
said, because few children or young adults seem to develop this type
of fat deposit.
   ``For women, the visceral fat doesn't seem to increase until
there is a lot of total fat,'' he said. ``Women are protected
against visceral fat to some degree, for some reason.''
   Smoking affects visceral, or central, fat, said Bray, and
stopping smoking tends to cause this fat to dissolve away, even
though the former smoker may gain fat in other areas. Again, why
this is so is not well understood, but he said, ``this is another
good reason to stop smoking.''
   Elsewhere, a declade-long study of American youth showed that
they are becoming more muscular but that their ever-more sedentary
lifestyles have also made them fatter and triggered an ``ominous''
loss of cardiovascular health.
   The Chrysler Fund-Amateur Athletic Union testing program, which
studied samplings of 12,000 youths from 1980 to 1989, said that,
with no perceptible increase in height for the various age groups
studied, the weight gains can be attributed to poorer dietary and
physical habits.

<HEAD>Dingell Says New Navy Destroyer a `Procurement Nightmare'</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Construction of the Navy's new $1.2 billion
destroyer has become a ``procurement nightmare'' of cost overruns
and schedule delays, a lawmaker charged in a letter released on the
eve of the ship's launching.
   Bath Iron Works, which the Navy contracted to build the DDG-51
destroyer, is 18 months behind schedule on the program and will
launch a ship Saturday that is only 38 percent complete, said Rep.
John Dingell, D-Mich., chairman of the House Energy and Commerce
Committee on oversight and investigations.
   The ship will be named the Arleigh Burke, after the World War II
naval hero and later chief of naval operations.
   ``The ship has suffered huge overruns, with the design costs
increasing by about 120 percent; and construction costs have
increased by more than 60 percent,'' Dingell said in a two-page
letter to Navy Secretary H. Lawrence Garrett III.
   The letter, dated Sept. 12, was obtained Thursday by The
Associated Press.
   Design costs have increased from the original contract estimate
of $111 million to $247 million while construction costs have grown
from $157 million to $252 million, Dingell said.
   The Michigan Democrat based his charges on a draft report from
the General Accounting Office, the investigative arm of Congress
which is conducting an inquiry into the program. The GAO's final
report is expected later this year.
   ``The acquisition of the DDG-51 has turned into a procurement
nightmare,'' Dingell said in the letter.
   At the Pentagon, Navy Cmdr. Mark Baker said Bath Iron Works ``is
on schedule in accordance with their contractural requirements. The
Navy considers the program well under control in both cost and
schedule.''
   Baker said the production schedule calls for the ship to be
delivered to the Navy in February 1991. The original delivery date
of October 1989 had been changed due to a 99-day strike at Bath Iron
Works in July 1985, a requirement of additional Navy testing of the
combat system and problems with computer-aided design, the Navy
spokesman said.
   William E. Haggett, chairman and chief executive officer of Bath
Iron Works, called Dingell's assessment a ``distortion of the
overall picture on the destroyer program'' as well as ``factually
incorrect.''
   According to the executive at the 105-year-old shipyard which
built 83 destroyers during World War II, the destroyer is ``ready in
every respect for launching.''
   ``It's 47 to 51 percent complete, a higher level than we launched
our previous prototype ship,'' Haggett said in a telephone interview
from Bath, Maine.

<TEXT>
   Thousands of cheering people lined the
streets Thursday to greet Namibian guerrilla leader Sam Nujoma as he
ended 30 years of exile to compete in pre-independence elections.
   ``We never lost sight of our principal objective _ freedom and
independence for Namibia,'' Nujoma said.
   Supporters of Nujoma's South-West African People's Organization
mobbed his motorcade as it left the airport on the 25-mile drive
through the empty and arid countryside into Windhoek, the capital.
   ``We return in the spirit of peace, love and national
reconciliation,'' said Nujoma, whose fighters waged a 23-year war
against South African rule of Namibia.
   Tight security measures were in force because of threats on
Nujoma's life and the assassination Tuesday of Anton Lubowski, the
only white with a leadership post in Nujoma's movement.
   South Africa, which has controlled Namibia since 1915, agreed to
grant the territory independence under U.N. supervision. Elections
are set for November and independence is expected early next year.
   Nujoma's return will undoubtedly boost the fortunes of his
independence movement, which already is favored to capture the most
votes. Nujoma arrived a day before the deadline to register for
election to the constituent assembly that will write a constitution.
   ``No words may express my happiness at joining my family, friends
and comrades,'' said Nujoma, who kissed the tarmac and hugged his
89-year-old mother when he got off the Ethiopian Airlines jet from
Luanda, Angola.
   Nujoma predicted his organization would win an ``overwhelming
majority'' at the polls. The nationalist movement needs to capture
two-thirds of the seats to draw up the constitution by itself.
   His boisterous supporters, crammed into trucks, vans, station
wagons, and buses, brought traffic to a halt as they followed Nujoma
from the airport through town. They honked horns, sang songs,
chanted slogans gave clenched fist salutes and waved the red, blue
and green movement flag.
   People left their offices and homes to see the parade, and some
joined in. Others shouted obscenities.
   Nujoma, when asked about the death threats, said, ``Whenever I
move about I am concerned about my own safety.''
   He said Lubowski ``will be remembered for for his dedication to
the sacred code of peace, justice and freedom.'' Lubowski, 37, a
civil rights lawyer, was killed by automatic rifle fire outside his
Windhoek home Tuesday night.
   Earlier Thursday, Police Inspector Kierie du Rand said a
50-year-old white man with an Irish passport had been arrested in
the killing. Du Rand said the man reportedly came to Namibia from
Cape Town, South Africa and was arrested Wednesday in Windhoek.
   Du Rand did not identify him and said additional arrests were
expected.
   All the movement leaders have unarmed bodyguards. They said they
have applied for police protection, but they want U.N. forces to
monitor the police guards.
   The guerrilla group has received some bad publicity as some
people said they were captured by the group and tortured. They said
up to 2,000 other detainees were still being held.
   Nujoma denied anyone was still being held.
   Fighting between the guerrillas and the South African-led
security forces ended in April. Since then, there have been only
isolated violent incidents in this territory.
   Nujoma's organization is leftist-leaning and favors a socialist
economy. He is viewed as a shrewd, instinctive politician,
maintaining the presidency of SWAPO since 1960 despite occasional
challenges.

<TEXT>
   ``Our Flag,'' a book on the history and care of
the U.S. flag, is rolling off government presses after being out of
print for more than a decade, lawmakers said Thursday.
   ``It is back by popular demand,'' said Sen. Wendell H. Ford,
D-Ky., chairman of the Joint Committee on Printing.
   Congress last year approved a resolution to revise the 52-page
book and print nearly 300,000 copies. They will be given to each
lawmaker for free distribution to constituents and many will be sold
through the Government Printing Office.
   Ford said the book went out of print because there was no demand
for it.
   ``But now we're getting a lot of requests for it,'' Ford said.
``There was a lot of enthusiasm for the flag built around political
campaigns.''
   He said Sen. William V. Roth, R-Del., got 10,000 requests.
   Rep. Frank Annunzio, D-Ill., vice chairman of the committee, said
Congress acted a year ago to put the book back in print and that the
recent Supreme Court ruling striking down a Texas law prohibiting
flag desecration had no bearing on the decision.

<HEAD>Amazon Indians March on Presidential Palace to Protest Invasion of
Lands</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BRASILIA, Brazil (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Scores of Amazon Indians in war paint
marched on the presidential palace Thursday to demand the removal of
tens of thousands of gold miners who invaded tribal lands.
   Shouting ``Give back the stolen land!'' and ``We want peace, not
war!'' about 100 Indians of the Yanomami, Kayapo, Guarani and
Kaingang tribes advanced to the marble-and-glass palace.
   The protesters, wearing green parrot-feather headresses and
red-and-black war paint and carrying wooden clubs, sang tribal
chants and demanded to see President Jose Sarney.
   Sarney refused to receive the group, and an aide said the Indians
should lodge their complaints with the Interior Ministry.
   The protest was led by Chief Davi Kopenawa of the 9,000-member
Yanomami tribe. The Yanomamis live in the remote northern Amazon on
Brazil's border with Venezuela, a region rich in timber, gold and
diamonds.
   Kopenawa said the Indians wanted to deliver a petition to Sarney
demanding the immediate removal of an estimated 40,000 gold
prospectors from the Yanomami reservation. The government said it
began removing prospectors from the region Thursday.
   ``Sarney should obey the constitution,'' said Kopenawa, who last
year won a U.N. award for his defense of the environment.
   He said 70 percent of the Yanomamis' land _ originally covering
22 million acres _ have been converted into national parks and
forests. But the government has been unable or unwilling to keep
prospectors out of the mineral-rich area.
   Environmental and Indian protection groups claim the invasion of
gold miners has spread disease, made game scarce and contaminated
rivers.
   ``We don't want our families to go on dying,'' said Kopenawa,
adding that the Yanomamis wanted an emergency health plan.
   The chief threatened to return the U.N. award if the government
didn't take action against the prospectors.
   ``This medal, which I didn't ask for ... is not resolving
anything,'' he said.
   The Indians arrived in Brasilia earlier this week and tried to
meet with presidential candidates. None of the leading candidates
would meet with them.
   Brazilians are to vote Nov. 15 in the first free election for
president since 1960.
   Brazil has about 220,000 native Indians, down from an estimated 5
million when the nation was discovered by Portuguese explorers in
1500.
   Fernando Gabeira, the presidential candidate of the small Green
Party and a supporter of the Indians' cause, said ``there is no
consciousness in Brazil of the importance of Indian culture.''
   Ricardo Pedreira, the presidential press secretary, said the
government and federal police began Thursday to remove the first
group of 90 miners from Yanomami land.
   He said officials also would try to close an estimated 70
clandestine air strips on the reservation. Small planes ferry some
miners to the region.

<HEAD>Illness Believed Linked to Bath Contamination from Aquarium</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Aside from the obvious, researchers have found
another reason not to bathe with piranhas _ the possibility of
bacterial illness.
   The national Centers for Disease Control reported Thursday the
case of a Missouri toddler who was bathed in a baby sitter's tub
soon after aquarium water had been dumped there; she developed a
bacterial infection believed to have come from the sitter's pet
piranhas.
   The 14-month old girl, who was not identified, developed diarrhea
and a fever. She recovered after five days.
   The CDC said the report is the first time Plesiomonas
shigelloides bacteria has been associated with aquarium water. The
bacteria has been found in surface water, fish and animals,
including dogs and cats.
   After the July 1988 case, Missouri health officials spot-checked
18 fish tanks around the state and found the bacteria in four, all
in pet shop aquariums.
   In its weekly report, the CDC said precautions such as
handwashing after contact with aquarium water and preventing
contamination of bathing or drinking water, should decrease the
transmission of such bacteria.

   Jesse Jackson said Thursday that President
Bush's plan to fight drugs underestimates the power of drug cartels
and should be combined with a war on poverty.
   ``If you woke up tomorrow morning sober and drug free, and rain
falling through your roof, you'd still have another war to fight _
the war on poverty,'' Jackson said.
   Speaking at one of the forums sponsored by the Congressional
Black Caucus during its three-day ``Legislative Weekend,'' the
two-time candidate for the Democratic presidential nomination said
Bush's drug program is insufficient to combat drug suppliers.
   ``The drug plan underestimates the viciousness of the drug lords.
They have better weapons than our state militia. They've got AK-47s,
they've got Uzis (automatic weapons). They're better equipped;
they're willing to kill and be killed,'' Jackson said.
   ``They're more dangerous than the drug plan assesses they are,''
he said. ``The drug plan underestimates their troop strength. The
drug users are more desperate than the plan recognizes.''
   He also said poor people are being exploited on the other end of
the drug-production chain and that a war on drugs should include an
effort to ease poverty in rural South America where drugs are grown.
   ``You've got the very poor on both ends, growing and consuming,
and the very wealthy, wheeling and dealing,'' Jackson said.
   Jackson spoke at a youth forum during the first full day of
events sponsored by the Congessional Black Caucus, the organization
of black members of Congress.
   The events are expected to attract 20,000 people by their
conclusion Saturday night at a $300 black-tie gala dinner and
assorted parties.
   Actor Lou Gossett Jr. also spoke to the black youth group, and
while other workshops and seminars were held on subjects ranging
from blacks in athletics to illiteracy to jazz.
   At a forum on college sports, Grambling University President
Joseph Johnson condemned a proposal before the National Collegiate
Athletic Association to deny automatic invitations to the NCAA
basketball tournaments to conferences made up of predominantly black
colleges.
   ``There is a movement to turn the clock back on black
institutions,'' Johnson said.
   At a forum titled ``The Resurgence of Racism and the Far Right,''
one speaker said that there has been an escalation of racial
violence linked to a ``deepening economic crisis.''
   Leah Wise, executive director of the Southerners for Economic
Justice, a labor-oriented group based in Durham, N.C., said many
racial incidents over the past decade in the South can be linked to
plant closings and other economic threats felt by whites.
   Wise said many blacks continue to face worse working conditions
than whites. She said the civil rights movement must share some of
the blame because ``we spent more time working on affirmative action
for elite sectors than on the day-to-day conditions of our workers.''

<TEXT>
   President Bush will meet with Soviet Foreign
Minister Eduard Shevardnadze next Thursday to assure him the United
States wants quick action on nuclear arms talks and supports reforms
in the Soviet Union, the White House said Thursday.
   Announcing the Bush-Shevardnadze talks, White House press
secretary Marlin Fitzwater said the president wants to have a summit
with Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev but that ``there's no hurry,
there's no pressing reason to push for a meeting if we're not ready
from a substantive standpoint.''
   The White House meeting with Bush falls on the eve of two days of
talks in Jackson Hole, Wyo., between Shevardnadze and Secretary of
State James A. Baker III.
   Baker and Shevardnadze are expected to discuss prospects for a
superpower summit. Barring a last-minute snag, they also are
expected to sign a landmark agreement governing disclosure of
stockpiles of chemical weapons and permitting inspection of their
production facilities.
   Fitzwater said it was uncertain whether the Baker-Shevardnadze
meeting would produce a summit date. Two administration officials
said they doubted a summit date would be set.
   ``The president's view is that he is certainly willing to have a
summit with President Gorbachev at any time that we feel that it's
right, and both sides have substantive issues to discuss,''
Fitzwater said.
   While acknowledging the possibility of an agreement on chemical
weapons, Fitzwater said he did not want to tie the possibility of a
superpower summit to any single particular issue.
   He said Washington and Moscow have similar desires for a summit.
   While both sides want such a meeting, he said, ``both sides want
to have one that's productive and is timed to reach real progress in
terms of our relations. And it's just a matter of deciding when that
time is.''
   Bush and Shevardnadze will meet at 2 p.m. EDT Thursday for talks
that could run an hour long, Fitzwater said.
   ``The president would want to reassure him on support for the
reforms in the Soviet Union and make sure there's no
misunderstanding about our intention to move as fast as we can on
arms control.''
   Last week, Shevardnadze accused the Bush administration of
dragging its feet on arms negotiations. He said the United States
and Soviet Union could ``lose a lot'' from what he called the
cautious and indecisive position taken by the Bush administration.
   Fitzwater said the United States rejects the foreign minister's
criticism.
   ``We feel we've moved rather quickly and in a leadership fashion
in terms of a wide range of arms control issues. ...,'' Fitzwater
said.

   Two Democrats _ including Attorney General
Mike Moore _ and a Republican have qualified for the Oct. 3 special
election to fill the unexpired term of the late U.S. Rep. Larkin
Smith.
   Smith, a freshman Republican, died Aug. 13 in a plane crash along
with his pilot.
   Candidates were required to submit petitions by Wednesday
carrying the names of at least 1,000 registered voters to qualify
for the race for the 5th District seat.
   Republican Tom Anderson spent 16 years as chief of staff to U.S.
Sen. Trent Lott, R-Miss. Anderson, 43, worked for Lott while Lott
represented the 5th District in Congress and after Lott won election
to the U.S. Senate last fall.
   Anderson also had a stint as ambassador to Barbados.
   Moore, 37, is a former district attorney in Jackson County in the
5th District.
   State Sen. Gene Taylor, 35, of Bay St. Louis was defeated by
Smith in 1988 but captured 46 percent of the vote.
   Smith's widow, Sheila, first said she would run for seat, but
later said she was backing Anderson.

<HEAD>FDA Poised To Approve Wider Distribution Of AIDS Drug</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A plan for wider distribution of a promising
experimental AIDS drug known as DDI is expected to be approved
shortly, Food and Drug Administration sources said Thursday.
   Bristol-Myers Co., which is licensed to manufacture the drug, has
said it will distribute DDI, or dideoxyinosine, at no cost to AIDS
patients when the next round of clinical trials begins later this
month.
   The drug has so far been available only to about 90 patients in
phase one clinical trials, the initial safety studies.
   The company has asked the FDA to approve distribution of the drug
to patients who do not qualify for the upcoming round of research
trials, which will compare DDI to AZT, the only approved anti-AIDS
drug. Patients who cannot tolerate AZT would be ineligible for these
trials.
   FDA officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said no
decision has been made on precisely who would be eligible to receive
the drug, though one source said it would include certain patients
outside clinical trials.
   Researchers say that like AZT, DDI appears to reduce replication
of the human immunodeficiency virus, which causes AIDS, and controls
the disease by enabling the body to recover some ability to fight
infection.
   Scientists say one important advantage DDI has compared with AZT
is that it is less toxic and better tolerated by patients.

<HEAD>Soviet Openness Has Eased Diplomacy, U.S. Envoy to U.N. Says</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Dealing with Soviet diplomats has undergone
``kind of a remarkable change'' as a by-product of that country's
new openness and negotiations have become much easier, the U.S.
ambassador to the United Nations said Thursday.
   ``Dealing with Soviet diplomats has become something quite
different than it was 10, 15, 30 years ago,'' Thomas Pickering told
a National Press Club audience. ``You can now begin a process of
sitting down and not only exploring where the issues will go but
also sitting down and trying to put the pieces together.''
   ``While that occurred from time to time in many areas over the
past couple of decades, it was nowhere occurring as universally as
it is now, nor I think nearly as enthusiastically as it is now,'' he
said.
   Pickering was named to the U.N. post by President Bush and is
only the second career officer to hold the job since it was
established 43 years ago.
   Today's Soviets, Pickering said, ``are much more interested in
finding ways to put things together and it's a fascinating
exploration because, indeed, as the Soviet Union has moved it has
moved not away from us but in a direction of what has worked in our
society.
   ``There is a fascinating interest on the part of the Soviets
about how does our society tick, what makes it work, what are the
features of success, where have the failures been and how and in
what way can they possibly incorporate those in the sort of system
they hope to build,'' he said.

<HEAD>Panel Says Former Prime Minister Took Bribes</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ATHENS, Greece (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A parliamentary committee looking into a
$210 million banking scandal said Thursday that former Premier
Andreas Papandreou accepted bribes and should be investigated with
four of his ministers.
   It was the second time this week that Papandreou was accused of
wrongdoing while he headed the socialist government from 1981 until
June.
   On Tuesday, another parliamentary committee proposed that the
70-year-old Papandreou appear before a special court investigating
wiretaping purportedly carried out for him by the state intelligence
service. The wiretaps were reportedly put on phones of Papandreou's
political opponents.
   In addition to accusing Papandreou of taking bribes, Thursday's
panel report also said he had committed breach of faith and received
stolen material from fugitive banker George Koskotas, according to
committee chairman Nikos Katsaros. He announced the findings to
journalists.
   The report said a special court should be set up to investigate
the reports that Panpandreou and the other ministers were involved
in embezzling funds.
   Parliament Speaker Athanassios Tsaldaris said a two-day debate
will be held on the scandal, which centers on Koskotas and his
privately-owned Bank of Crete, at the end of September.
   A debate on the reported wiretaps will also be held, but no date
has been set.
   If Parliament accepts the proposals of the two committees, the
Supreme Court president will preside over two special investigating
tribunals. They will be made up of 12 Supreme Court or Appeals Court
judges.
   If formal charges are filed as a result of the inquiries, the
former government officials would be tried by these same courts.
   Koskotas, chairman and owner of the Bank of Crete, was removed
from his post by the government last October amid press reports he
was embezzling the bank. A later audit showed $210 million was
missing.
   Since then, the scandal has continued to make headlines and
political waves. The scandal hurt Papandreou in his failed bid to
lead his party to victory in national elections in June.
   The political opposition and most of the press have accused
Papandreou and several of his ministers of complicity with Koskotas.
   Most of the charges originated with Koskotas himself, who fled
Greece in November and later gave interviews to the media after he
was arrested and held in Salem, Mass.
   He was quoted as saying Papandreou had blackmailed him into
embezzling funds, and that the money supported Papandreou's party.
   Koskotas is awaiting extradition to Greece.
   Katsaros' committee was formed in July to look into any
involvement by Papandreou and the other ministers. The former
members are Deputy Premier Agamemnon Koutsogiorgas, National Economy
Minister Panayotis Roumeliotis, Finance Minister Dimitris Tsovolas
and Transport Minister George Petsos.
   Members of Papandreou's Panhellenic Socialist Movement, or PASOK,
walked out of parliamentary proceedings on the scandal last week,
charging that they were attempts to slur the former premier.
   Papandreou has accused the political opposition of attempting to
destroy him politically. However, he has refused to testify before
the two parliamentary committees. Instead, he sent messages
questioning the legality of the inquiries and denying guilt.
   It is considered virtually certain that Parliament will agree to
more investigations because 173 seats in the 300-seat chamber are
held by conservative and leftist parties that united to form a
government.
   The coalition administration succeeded the socialists after no
party won a clear majority in June's national elections. It has
pledged to make major steps to clean up Greek political life and
hold new elections by Nov. 5.

   Dogs cause more deaths and injuries in the United
States than most people believe, claiming 18 to 20 lives a year and
scarring hundreds of thousands of people, federal researchers say in
a study.
   Seventy percent of deaths occur among children less than 10 years
old, including many less than a year old, who are sometimes attacked
while sleeping or after wandering into fenced areas where dogs are
kept, the study found.
   ``The occurrence of dog bite-related fatalities has been
underestimated,'' the authors, from the national Centers for Disease
Control in Atlanta, said in their report in Friday's Journal of the
American Medical Association.
   ``Many of these bites and deaths are potentially preventable,''
they added.
   Pit bull breeds were involved in 42 of the 101 deaths in which
dog breed was reported, almost three times more than German
shepherds, the next most commonly reported breed, the researchers
said.
   That finding was questioned by American Kennel Club Vice
President Alan J. Stern, who said information on breeds was not
meaningful. ``We have legendary cases of misidentification of
breeds,'' he said.
   Twenty-seven breeds have been variously labeled as ``bull''
types, many erroneously, including Dalmatian mixes and Chesapeake
Bay retrievers, Stern said in a telephone interview Thursday from
New York.
   ``People don't know what they are,'' he said. ``The dogs attack,
so they're pit bulls.''
   But Ann Joly, a research assistant with the Washington-based
Humane Society of the United States, said pit bulls do represent a
disproportionately high number of animals involved in dog-bite
fatalities.
   She said, however, that news accounts of pit bull attacks
``helped fuel the fire'' by prompting ``weird kinds of people who
want a mean dog'' to look for pit bulls to train into vicious
animals.
   To curb the dog-bite problem, the CDC researchers recommended
stronger animal-control laws, better public education on dog bites
and more responsible dog ownership.
   Joly and Stern agreed with the recommendations. Stern stressed
the need for animal-control laws that ``go after the deed, not the
breed.''
   Besides deaths, dog bites cause a ``tremendous injury problem,''
said the researchers, Dr. Jeffrey J. Sacks, Dr. Richard W. Sattin
and Sandra E. Bonzo. ``More than 2 million persons are bitten yearly
_ half are left scarred, one-tenth require sutures (stitches) and
one-third suffer lost school or work time,'' the researchers added,
citing previous research.
   The authors identified 157 dog bite-related fatalities that
occurred in the United States from 1979 through 1988, based on data
from the National Center for Health Statistics and a computer search
of news stories during the period.
   In addition, there were four dog bite-related deaths recorded by
the Humane Society, and 17 other deaths at least partly attributed
to dog bites by data from the health statistics center, they said.
Since center statistics were missing for two years, the researchers
estimated that 26 deaths were unaccounted for, judging by data from
previous years.
   Taken together, the total for the period was 204 deaths, or about
20 a year, the authors said. Only one rabid-dog-bite fatality turned
up, and it was not included in calculations, the researchers said.
   ``The main victims of fatal dog bites were the very young and
very old, those least able to protect themselves,'' the researchers
said.
   The death rate for newborns, less than a month old, was 370 times
higher than that for adults ages 30 to 49, they said, and the rate
for infants, less than a year old, was 85 times higher than for
adults in that group.
   For people 70 or over, the rate was almost 11 times higher than
for the 30-to-49 group.
   The three states with the largest number of fatal attacks were
Texas, with 17; California, with 16; and Ohio, with 10. Western
states in general had higher death rates, said the researchers, who
offered no explanation for the finding.

   An angry Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist
said Thursday a new book on Robert H. Bork's ill-fated Supreme Court
nomination incorrectly states Rehnquist broke a promise to keep
Justice Lewis F. Powell's impending retirement a secret.
   In the book, ``Battle for Justice,'' author Ethan Bronner says
Powell told Rehnquist on June 25, 1987, that he would announce his
retirement the following day and asked for ``a solemn promise'' to
keep it a secret overnight.
   ``The chief justice expressed his sincere regret, agreed to keep
it to himself, and called (White House Chief of Staff Howard H.)
Baker with the news,'' the book said. It said Baker immediately told
President Reagan.
   ``That statement is in error,'' Rehnquist said Thursday. ``I
notified Howard Baker of the retirement shortly before we went on
the bench on the morning of Friday, June 26, 1987.''
   Bronner, however, stuck by his story Thursday and said his
tape-recorded interview with Baker supports his account of
Rehnquist's action.
   Privately, Rehnquist has told people at the court he is offended
by an account that portrays him as a man who cannot be trusted to
keep his word. The chief justice decided to go public with his anger
shoftly after the passage in the book was called to his attention.
   Powell's announcement of his retirement on the last day of the
court's 1986-87 term stunned those in the courtroom that June 26
morning _ and touched off an epic battle to fill the court vacancy.
   Bork's nomination was defeated by the Senate after a bitter fight
in which the nominee was attacked as an extreme conservative outside
the mainstream of American politics.
   Federal Judge Douglas H. Ginsburg, Reagan's second choice,
withdrew as a nominee after admitting he smoked marijuana while a
Harvard law professor. The president then nominated Anthony M.
Kennedy, who was confirmed by the Senate and joined the court in
February 1988.
   Rehnquist's version of when the White House was told of Powell's
retirement was supported by Baker in an interview with The
Associated Press.
   ``I talked to him (Rehnquist) .... minutes before (Powell) made a
public announcement,'' said Baker, now a Washington attorney.
   Baker said his office received a telephone call from Rehnquist's
office the evening of June 25 alerting the White House something was
up. The message from a Rehnquist aide was that the chief justice
intended to call Baker the following morning.
   Baker said he was ready for a call from Rehnquist on June 26 but
had no idea of what the chief justice wanted to tell him.
   Baker, a former Republican senator from Tennessee, said he
promptly told Reagan the news at their regular morning meeting. That
took place shortly before Powell announced his retirement publicly,
Baker said.
   Bronner told the AP on Thursday he interviewed Baker for the
book, and Baker said he was told by Rehnquist of Powell's decision
to retire a day before the public announcement.
   A transcript of that tape-recorded interview has Baker saying he
told Reagan about the Powell retirement right after hearing from
Rehnquist on June 25.
   ``It was the day before that Rehnquist called me,'' Baker told
Bronner. Baker provided details of the conversation, including
Rehnquist's admonition that the advance word on Powell was ``for
your ears only.''
   Asked by Bronner when he informed Reagan, Baker said, ``I did it
the second I got the call.''
   Baker now says if he told Bronner he had advance knowledge, ``I
misspoke myself. I did not know.''
   Powell, asked for his recollection, said he believes Rehnquist
lived up to his promise. ``There's no question in my mind'' the
White House was not informed until shortly before the courtroom
announcement, Powell said.

<HEAD>Aquino: Filipino Interests Take Priority in U.S. Bases Issue</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT H. REID</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MANILA, Philippines (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Corazon Aquino said Thursday
that she will consider Filipino interests more than regional
security concerns in deciding whether to allow U.S. military bases
to stay after 1991.
   Also Thursday, several hundred leftists rallied in front of the
U.S. Embassy to demand the bases be closed. They promised bigger
rallies when Vice President Quayle visits the Philippines later this
month.
   In an interview with The Associated Press, Mrs. Aquino said she
was waiting to hear what Washington was prepared to offer before
making her decision on the bases, whose lease expires in September
1991.
   U.S. and Filipino officials are expected to begin talks late this
year on the future of Clark Air Base, the Subic Bay naval base and
four smaller installations.
   U.S. officials claim the bases are essential for maintaining
security in the Far East, including the six-member Association of
Southeast Asian Nations, to which the Philippines belongs.
   ``I will decide this based on what I believe will be in the
interest of the Filipino people,'' Mrs. Aquino said. ``While it is
true we are of ASEAN, my first consideration naturally is for the
interest of the Filipino people and after that what will benefit the
ASEAN region.''
   Singapore has offered air and naval facilities in case the
Philippines closes the U.S. installations. But American officials
say Singapore's facilities cannot match the size and location of
those in the Philippines.
   Last October, the United States agreed to pay $461 million a year
in aid to keep the bases until 1991.
   U.S. officials warn that Washington is not prepared to pay
substantially more for the bases because they contribute to
Philippine defense.
   During the interview, Mrs. Aquino refused to say whether she
believes the bases guarantee regional security. She noted, however,
that the presence of American bases did not prevent Japanese forces
from invading this island nation during World War II.
   ``In fact, there are people who think that perhaps we were the
first to be attacked simply because of the presence of U.S. bases,''
she said.
   Quayle is expected to discuss the bases issue when he arrives
Sept. 26 for a three-day visit.
   At the embassy rally, several speakers said they would organize
large demonstrations during Quayle's visit to protest the U.S.
military presence.
   Any new bases agreement must be ratified by two-thirds of the
23-member Philippine Senate. Last month, 12 senators called for the
bases to be closed in 1991.
   Mrs. Aquino also refused to say whether she personally believes a
new agreement would be in the national interest.
   Regardless of the outcome, Mrs. Aquino said she wanted to retain
close ties with the United States, the Philippines' former colonial
ruler.
   ``I am hoping that both the Americans and the Filipinos can
maintain a very friendly relationship because we Filipinos would
like to believe that there is more (to the relationship) than just
the matter of the bases,'' she said.

   Communist authorities will rebury the
last king of Montenegro, who died in exile in 1921, in the city that
served as capital of his kingdom, a newspaper reported Thursday.
   For many years, officials harshly criticized the Yuguslav
monarchy after it was abolished and Communism proclaimed in 1945.
   The decision to allow reinterment reflects growing liberalization
and swelling nationalist sentiments during economic hardship and
ethnic strife.
   The remains of King Nikola Petrovic and Queen Milena will be
exhumed from their tomb in the Italian Mediterranean resort of San
Remo on Sept. 29, according to the Politika Ekspres daily.
   After being transferred back to Yugoslavia, they will be reburied
on Oct. 1 in an Orthodox church at Cetinje, former capital of the
Kingdom of Montenegro, the daily said. Montenegro is now one of six
Yugoslav republics.
   According to sources close to those organizing the reburial,
Yugoslavia's Crown Prince Aleksandar Karadjordjevic, a businessman
living in London and a distant relative of King Nikola, will be
invited to come to Yugoslavia to attend the ceremony.
   If he accepts, it will be the first time that a direct descendant
of the royal family has gained permission to enter the country since
Communist rule began.
   Montenegro was an independent state for centuries before it was
incorporated into the Kingdom of Yugoslavia in 1918 under the rule
of the rival Serbian Karadjordjevic dynasty.
   King Nikola, who had fled to Italy to escape advancing
Austro-Hungarian troops in 1916, never returned home.

<TEXT>
   Widespread anti-Semitism in the lower ranks of
Soviet government and among the general populace has increased
greatly under glasnost, according to an internal State Department
report presented Thursday at a congressional hearing.
   State-sponsored anti-Semitism, official policy for hundreds of
years, has abated, although many cases are still reported, the
report said.
   The report is designed to provide information about Soviet
treatment of Jews, Armenians and Pentecostals _ the three groups
with the largest number seeking seek to emigrate to the United
States.
   Soviet Jews, estimated to number at least 2.5 million, comprise
the largest group of emigres seeking entry into the United States
under the open-door policies of President Mikhail Gorbachev.
   As many as 150,000 Soviets, the majority Jews, are expected to
apply to leave for the United States next year.
   But while the government is allowing increased Jewish emigration
and limiting harassment of religious and cultural activities,
``widespread anti-Semitic discrimination is still encountered at the
lower levels of government ... and in the general Russian
population,'' the report said.
   Leaders of five American Jewish organizations, calling on Deputy
Secretary of State Lawrence Eagleburger, registered concern over
anti-semitism in the Soviet Union.
   Shoshana S. Cardin, chairman of the National Conference on Soviet
Jewry, said ``it is creating tremendous apprehension.''
   ``Concerns are mounting there is a wave of emotion that is being
appealed to that is dangerous,'' Cardin said.
   The findings, presented by Rep. Howard Berman, D-Calif., at a
hearing about the administration's proposal to admit 50,000 Soviet
refugees next year, appear to clash with a Justice Department
directive that has removed the presumption of persecution for Soviet
Jews.
   The directive, issued by former Attorney General Edwin Meese,
requires each applicant to prove ``a well-founded fear of
persecution'' to be granted refugee status.
   As many as 50 percent of those applying this year in Moscow have
been turned down for refugee status. That is despite the fact that
Immigration and Naturalization Service officials use the report to
help them process Soviet applicants, according to INS chief of staff
Gerald Coyle.
   The new type of Soviet anti-Semitism ``has increased markedly in
the context of glasnost, as prior governmental controls on speech,
assembly, media, etc., have been loosened,'' the report said.
   Popular groups such as Pamyat ``frequently express anti-Semitism
as a social theory to explain'' economic hardships or to oppose
Gorbachev's reforms, it said.
   Many Jews ``have reason to fear not only that the fall of
Gorbachev and the reformers allied with him would bring back the
kind of official anti-Semitism that was in vogue prior to 1987,''
but that it would be augmented by the new brand of discrimination,
the report said.
   ``Official discrimination against Jews has also continued,'' the
State Department said. ``Persons identified as Jews have great
difficulty being accepted into'' universities and other institutions.
   ``And despite some significant efforts to appear to provide
facilities for the study of Jewish religion and culture, in fact
very little improvement has occurred.''

<TEXT>
   As if she didn't have enough trouble,
actress Zsa Zsa Gabor is being accused of skipping out on a $75 bill
for hair styling she received while attending a horse show two weeks
ago.
   Hair salon operator Jerry Perry said he styled Ms. Gabor's hair
three times while she attended the Tennessee Walking Horse National
Celebration in nearby Shelbyville.
   The actress is on trial in Beverly Hills, Calif., charged with
battery on a police officer, disobeying a police officer, driving
with an expired license, having expired car registration and having
an open bottle of liquor in her car.
   Perry said he tried three times to get the actress to pay, but
she delayed him and finally said the horse show would cover the cost.
   ``She said the Celebration people would take care of the bill,
but I had been told by Celebration people they would not pay the
bill, but you can not stand and argue with Zsa Zsa,'' he said
Wednesday.
   Brenda Gibson, a spokeswoman for the annual horse show, said the
bill will be forwarded to Ms. Gabor.
   Asked about Jerry Perry's disputed bill, Miss Gabor said from Los
Angeles: ``I don't know who the hell you're talking about. I didn't
have a hairdresser in Nashville. I was on my horse.''
   Her husband, Prince Frederick von Anhalt, Germany's Duke of
Saxony, then injected this comment: ``She can't get her hair done
for $75. Her hairdresser costs $350.''

<HEAD>Dingell May Propose Easing Acid Rain Plan</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: Recasts first 5 grafs to show Lent still backing administration
proposal, picking up 6th graf pvs, Sulfur dioxide.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LARRY MARGASAK</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Rep. John D. Dingell, the chief House
Democratic sponsor of President Bush's clean air bill, signaled
Thursday he propose relaxing the administration's stringent curbs on
acid rain.
   Dingell, chairman of the Energy and Commerce Committee, said he
had problems with a section of the acid rain plan that Environmental
Protection Agency Administrator William K. Reilly this week called
the most crucial part of the proposal.
   The move would place the Michigan Democrat in the unusual
position of opposing a key provision of the bill he is sponsoring.
It also would change what environmentalists call the strongest
portion of the Bush legislation.
   Reilly said the administration opposed any attempt to weaken the
provision, which would ``cap'' emissions of sulfur dioxide, a key
component of acid rain. The chief Republican sponsor of the
legislation, Rep. Norman F. Lent, R-N.Y., said he favors retaining
the administration's language.
   The ``cap'' would prevent sulfur dioxide emissions from growing
again after they are steadily reduced by a total of 10 million tons
over the next decade.
   Sulfur dioxide combines with nitrogen oxide in the atmosphere and
travels for hundreds of miles before falling to earth, killing
aquatic life in lakes and streams, damaging trees, decreasing
visibility and possibly harming human lungs.
   Speaking before the Energy and Commerce environment subcommittee,
Dingell said keeping the cap would prevent utilities from growing to
serve new customers. It also would harm the high-sulfur coal
industry, which is cheap but fuels the dirtiest-burning utilities,
he told the panel, which will begin considering amendments to the
Bush bill next week.
   But ``loosening ... the cap,'' Dingell said, would reduce sulfur
dioxide emissions ``without a severe impact on growth or on the use
of coal in the next century.''
   Power plants burning high-sulfur coal would bear the brunt of the
sulfur dioxide reductions under the Bush legislation. The United
Mine Workers union fears the utilities would reduce emissions the
cheapest way, by switching to other fuels. The EPA estimates that
could cost 17,000 jobs in the high-sulfur coal industry.
   ``I am ... greatly concerned that unemployment in Appalachia will
rise by enacting this ... bill,'' Dingell said. ``Clearly, that
should not be an environmental, utility industry or federal goal.''
   A Bush administration official, speaking only on condition he not
be named, said, ``We'll defend the president's position. We'll also
work with the sponsors. We'll wait for specific changes and figure
out how we'll react.''
   While the ``cap'' would make it difficult for electric utilities
to serve additional customers after the year 2000, there is a
provision to permit some growth. Utilities could accomplish this by
buying ``credits'' from utilities that exceeded their required
reductions.
   Dingell, a longtime champion of the auto industry, said,
meanwhile, that he would vigorously fight any attempts to toughen
Bush's anti-pollution requirements for motor vehicles.
   ``I would point out that all of the country does not have the air
pollution problems of California,'' Dingell said. ``Yet, some,
particularly in the Northeast, suggest that we should extend the
entire California auto emissions program nationwide.
   ``I would hope that my colleagues resist the temptation to single
out for punishment an industry that with its suppliers from the
glass, steel, aluminum, plastics, rubber and mining industries,
among others, employs millions in all the states.''

<HEAD>Administration Claims Record In Appointing Women And Minorities</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CHRISTOPHER CONNELL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Bush, in less than eight months in
office, has chosen more women for top jobs than any previous
president in a full year, his personnel chief said Thursday.
   Chase Untermeyer said Bush recently eclipsed Jimmy Carter's old
record of 72 women appointees in 1980 with his 73rd presidential
appointment, and has already raised that mark to 77.
   ``And we're not stopping there,'' Untermeyer said in a lecture at
the Heritage Foundation. ``We're going to name more and more.''
   Untermeyer said 20 percent of Bush's appointees to the jobs
requiring senatorial confirmation have been women and 13 percent
minorities.
   Untermeyer did not say how those percentages compared with those
of previous presidents.
   While smaller than the percentage of the women and minorities in
the entire population, the Bush administrations figures are about
double the comparable percentage of women and minorities in the top
ranks of the civil service, he claimed.
   Untermeyer, the director of presidential personnel, sought to
rebut criticism from congressional Democrats that the Bush
administration is riddled with vacancies.
   In the Cabinet departments, the vacancy rate for the highest
positions is less than 12 percent _ 36 jobs out of 312, he said.
   A few of the 36 are ``important jobs,'' including the
undersecretary of commerce for technology, ``but most of those 36
are positions that are clearly of lower priority,'' said Untermeyer.
   ``I'm not trying to ridicule these positions or the industries or
sectors of the American economy that they are involved with, but
among those vacancies that we don't have a candidate in process yet
is to be the deputy commissioner of patents and the deputy
commissioner of trademarks,'' said Untermeyer.
   ``The federal grain inspector is also one of those positions.
Many of these jobs make me wonder why they are presidential
appointments at all. But the Congress has decreed that they should
be presidential appointments, so they are,'' he said.
   ``Elsewhere, we have 88 percent of the positions that count''
either on the job or awaiting confirmation, he said.
   The Democratic Study Group, in a blistering report released Aug.
29, charged that 160 of 394 senior positions _ more than 40 percent
_ had been left vacant by Bush as of early August. It said it
appeared ``a significant portion of the government is on automatic
pilot.''
   The Democratic Study Group said the vacancies include five
assistant secretaries of education, a deputy attorney general, and
an undersecretary of state as well as the commerce post.
   The White House has complained that its nominees were facing
slow-going in the Democratic-controlled Senate.
   Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell of Maine last week said
Bush had no grounds to complain because he ``has failed to make
nominations for nearly half of the full-time positions in executive
departments and independent agencies which require Senate
confirmation.''
   Untermeyer said there is ``always'' about a 12 percent at the top
of the executive branch as people resign, retire, move on or out of
their office for other reasons.
   ``I describe (my) job as rather like painting the Golden Gate
Bridge: once you finish it, you have to start in at the other end
and start painting it again,'' said Untermeyer.
   He scoffed at the impression left by the critics ``that the Bush
administration (is) somehow still in the starting blocks, that it
was Gulliver tied down by strings of red tapes. This is not true.
   ``This administration has been enormously, even historically
successful in establishing itself. And when faced with a Congress
that is in the hands of the opposition, it is most impressive,'' the
Bush assistant said.
   The 73rd female presidential appointee was Margaret Machol, who
Bush said he will nominate to be a commissioner of the Commodity
Futures Trading Corporation.

<HEAD>District Rocked by Fiscal Crisis, Mismanagement, Theft Claims</HEAD>

<DATELINE>OAKLAND, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Oakland's school district has been plagued
by charges of corruption and thievery and faces a fiscal crisis that
could force it to accept a $10 million bailout and a state-appointed
overseer.
   The California Assembly on Thursday approved the bailout measure
and sent it to the governor for signing. If approved, Oakland would
become the state's first district taken over by the state without
the school board's approval.
   In the past six months, police have arrested eight school
employees on charges ranging from grand theft to forgery; the entire
seven-member school board has been subpoenaed by a county grand
jury; and a three-month newspaper investigation uncovered a
Mafia-style patronage system allegedly run by top officials known as
``the family.''
   In addition, the district has been unable to hire a
superintendent to take over stewardship of California's
fifth-largest school district since the previous chief administrator
left in December.
   Angry residents, responding to the turmoil, have launched a
recall drive to oust school board members.
   The district, with a $14 million deficit in the current $228
million budget, is teetering on the verge of bankruptcy. The school
board on Wednesday approved a financing plan that uses school
property as collateral, but state schools chief Bill Honig and
Alameda County schools Superintendent William Berck oppose the
arrangement as fiscally unstable.
   Honig called the budget plan ``hokey,'' and said district
mismanagement has created problems that are now ``bursting out all
over.''
   ``Nobody's running the show,'' he said. ``They have no long-term
plan to get out of the problems. They need fiscal policies, they
need personnel policies and they need management policies.''
   State Assemblyman Elihu Harris sponsored the legislation to
provide a $10 million loan and put in place a state monitor to
oversee the district's financial operations and make sure they
develop and adhere to a long-term plan.
   ``These are not problems that just surfaced in Oakland,'' Harris
said Thursday. ``Some have been around for 15 or 16 years. If the
problems were new, I'd suggest they could be solved internally, but
they're not new.''
   More than 50,000 residents signed a petition in support of
Harris' proposed law, now awaiting Gov. George Deukmejian's
signature.
   As the crisis grows _ police estimate as many as 50 district
employees may be arrested before their investigation is completed _
worried parents are enrolling their children in private schools in
record numbers.
   Critics blame top leaders for the crisis in the 50,000-student
district. They say a loose-knit system of close friends working to
protect each other's jobs has eroded authority and cleared the way
for illegal activity.
   Several school officials, many of whom will speak only on the
condition of anonymity, say senior School Board member Darlene
Lawson is at the center of the alleged patronage system.
   Lawson, who did not return telephone calls seeking comment
Thursday, has denied that she heads ``the family'' and has accused
critics of launching a racist drive to purge the district of many
black administrators.
   The first-ever grand jury probe of the schools began in 1984, one
year after a black majority was elected to the board for the first
time, Lawson wrote in The Tribune of Oakland following the
newspaper's two-day report.
   Lawson, who is black, said educational problems have been ignored
as politicians pursue ``an elitist and undemocratic political
agenda.''
   Honig described the district's crisis as ``just a sick
situation,'' and rejected the charge of racism.
   ``The last refuge of scoundrels ... is the false claim of
racism,'' he said. ``Nobody wants to take over Oakland. We've got
enough to do. They should do their jobs. ... Eventually the people
there who are claiming a plot are going to have to realize that they
are the problem.''

<HEAD>Air Force Fixing NORAD Problems, GAO Says</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Air Force has moved toward correcting
communications problems in the system responsible for alerting the
United States and Canada if North America is under attack, but
deficiencies still remain, says a report released Thursday.
   The General Accounting Office last November reported on five of
29 serious problems that if ignored, could affect the Communications
System Segment Replacement Program, which relays messages from
various missile, air and space sensor systems to mission centers at
the Cheyenne Mountain Air Force Station.
   The station, located in Colorado Springs, Colo., is a data
processing and communications center designed to monitor about
10,000 man-made objects in space, provide warnings of any military
attack in space and protect satellites from attack.
   According to the GAO, the investigative arm of Congress, the Air
Force has taken steps to correct three of the deficiencies, delayed
action on a fourth and is in the process of obtaining information on
the fifth problem before resolving the issue.
   ``The lack of uniform wiring standards, cabling congestion and
the need for a standardized message set are being resolved,'' the
GAO said. ``However, selection and implementation of a standard
communication protocol and use of consistent message loading
assumptions have not been resolved.''
   A message set is the form in which data is transmitted from the
sensors, or radars, to computer subsystems. A communication protocol
is a set of rules that govern communications among computer systems.
Message loading assumptions involve the number of messages a
subsystem is capable of processing.
   The system is part of the North American Aerospace Defense
Command, or NORAD, which is responsible for alerting the United
States and Canada if North America is under air, missile or space
attack.
   The GAO is recommending that if the Defense Acquisition Board
advises Defense Secretary Dick Cheney to continue development of the
program despite the absence of ``sound technical approach ... for
correcting critical deficiencies, the board should clearly justify

   The GAO also said that Cheney should not obligate fiscal 1990

subcommittee on defense, requested the GAO study.

   Leaders of five American Jewish groups urged
the State Department Thursday to press the Soviet Union for the
release of some 400 Jewish families who have been denied exit
permits.
   The delegation gave Deputy Secretary of State Lawrence
Eagleburger lists of Jewish ``refuseniks'' who were turned down more
than 10 years ago and those who were denied permits over the last
decade.
   Shoshana S. Cardin, chairman of the National Conference on Soviet
Jewry, said Eagleburger gave assurances the issue would be high on
the agenda when Secretary of State James A. Baker III meets in
Jackson Hole, Wyo., Sept. 22-23 with Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard
A. Shevardnadze.
   ``It was a very productive meeting,'' Cardin said of the
45-minute session with Eagleburger. Officials of the Conference of
Presidents of Major American Jewish Organizations, B'nai B'rith, the
Anti-Defamation League and the National Jewish Community Relations
Advisory Council also attended.
   Cardin said that, of 12 Jewish cases raised by Baker at a meeting
with Shevardnadze in May, four were subsequently allowed to leave
the country. She called that number ``very disturbing.''

<TEXT>
   Nuclear reactor manufacturer Babcock &amp; Wilcox
Co. said Thursday it is adding Framatome S.A. of France as a partner
in its nuclear services business and is considering a broader
partnership to develop new commercial reactors.
   Charles W. Pryor Jr., general manager of Babcock &amp; Wilcox's
existing nuclear services business, said adding Framatome will help
Babcock &amp; Wilcox broaden its scope in an industry that both
companies believe is nearing a comeback in the United States.
   No new nuclear plants have been ordered in the United States
since 1978.
   Framatome built and services all 55 pressurized water reactors
operating in France.
   Pryor said the venture, to be called B&amp;W Nuclear Services Co.,
based at Lynchburg, Va., will be staffed by the existing 750
employees of Babcock &amp; Wilcox's services company and will be managed
by Babcock &amp; Wilcox.
   The deal takes effect Nov. 1.
   Jean Claude Leny, chairman of Framatome, said his company is
paying $50 million for its interest in the venture, and that
operating costs would be shared equally by the parent companies.
   The $1 billion-a-year U.S. nuclear services market targeted by
Babcock &amp; Wilcox includes refueling, inspection and repair of plant
components, maintenance, licensing and engineering support and plant
management services.
   Pryor said Babcock &amp; Wilcox also is exploring the possibility of
an alliance with Nuclear Power International, a European group
including Framatome and Siemens of West Germany, to develop a new
reactor design for the U.S. market.
   Babcock &amp; Wilcox is a unit of McDermott International Inc., a New
Orleans-based energy concern.

<HEAD>Sammy Davis Jr. Diagnosed With Throat Cancer</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Entertainer Sammy Davis Jr. has been diagnosed
with throat cancer and will begin radiation therapy next week, his
publicist said Thursday.
   An abnormality was detected during Davis' annual medical
examination and was diagnosed by Dr. Joseph Sugerman as a carcinoma
of the throat, Arnold Lipsman, a Davis spokesman, said in a
statement.
   Davis, 63, underwent reconstructive hip surgery in November 1985,
and has been on tour for more than a year with Frank Sinatra and
Liza Minnelli in concerts billed as ``the ultimate event.''
   Lipsman quoted Dr. Sugerman as saying, ``Mr. Davis' condition is
localized and a full and complete recovery following treatment is
expected.''
   Davis is expected to complete his current engagement at Harrah's
Tahoe hotel and casino Sunday, but he will not appear with Sinatra
and Miss Minnelli at concerts scheduled for October in Toronto, the
Washington, D.C., area and Charlotte, N.C.
   ``Liza and Frank will continue the tour, except for one
concert,'' said Susan Reynolds, a Los Angeles publicist for the
``Frank, Liza &amp; Sammy'' tour. An Oct. 3 benefit concert set at the
Boston Garden has been canceled.
   She said Sinatra and Minnelli were unavailable for comment, ``but
their hearts are with Sammy. They speak frequently together by
telephone.''
   Davis, a singer, dancer and actor, was born to vaudevillians
Elvera and Sammy Davis in 1925, appeared on stage as a youngster and
braved bigotry for decades as he toured the country.
   For years he was a familiar member of Hollywood's ``Rat Pack'' of
entertainers, which included Dean Martin, Peter Lawford and Sinatra.
   Beginning in the 1950s, he released a series of hit songs,
including duets with Sinatra and Martin, that culminated in ``The
Candy Man'' in 1972. He also recorded ``Something's Gotta Give'' in
1955 and ``I've Gotta Be Me'' in 1969.

   Hispanics continue to make impressive electoral
gains at every level of government, according to the president of an
organization that found the number of elected Latinos nationwide
jumped 12.6 percent from 1988.
   In a study released Thursday, the National Association of Latino
Elected and Appointed Officials said 3,783 Hispanic elected
officials hold office in 37 states.
   Texas leads the country, with 1,693 elected officials who account
for 44.75 percent of the total, followed by New Mexico, with 647
Hispanic elected officials who account for 17.1 percent of the total.
   Despite their gains, however, elected Hispanic officials still
account for less than 1 percent of all elected officials nationwide,
the organization said, while Latinos account for 8 percent of the
population.
   ``Civic participation is the key to economic and political
advancement in the Latino community,'' said Rep. Solomon Ortiz,
D-Texas., a board member of the group. ``The 1990 census and the
reapportionment that follows will play a vital role in Latino
electoral representation for the next decade.''
   The Hispanic group found there are 10 Hispanic members of
Congress _ four from Texas, three from California, and one each from
New York, Florida and New Mexico.
   The study said there are 128 state legislators, 1,340 school
board members, 1,178 municipal officials, 246 mayors, and one
governor _ Bob Martinez of Florida.
   ``Hispanics continue to make impressive electoral gains at every
level of office,'' said Rep. Edward Roybal, D-Calif., the group's
board president. ``A barometer of an ethnic group's integration into
the political system and society can be measured through their
number of elected officials.''
   National Director Harry Pachon said that while growth continues
in such traditionally Hispanic states as Texas, California and
Florida, Latinos are also making gains elsewhere, including
Illinois, New Jersey and Washington.
   Elected Hispanic women account for 19.7 percent of the Hispanic
office holders, the study said.

   The Senate tentatively approved a ban on
cigarette smoking on all domestic airline flights on Thursday as
outnumbered tobacco-state lawmakers abandoned their fight against
the broadened restrictions.
   On a showdown 77-21 vote, senators forced a halt to delaying
tactics their pro-smoking colleagues had hoped would wear out
advocates of the ban and lead to a compromise. The Senate then
formally adopted the restrictions on a unanimous voice vote.
   ``We didn't undertake that vote in the belief we could defeat''
the proposed ban, Sen. Wendell Ford, D-Ky., who fought the proposal,
conceded afterward.
   Sen. Frank Lautenberg, D-N.J., who sponsored the ban proposal and
who cited health concerns about lingering cigarette smoke in airline
cabins, said, ``The issue itself carried the day.''
   The measure was part of an $11.9 billion spending bill for next
year's transportation programs that was nearing final passage.
   On Aug. 3, the House approved legislation making permanent the
current smoking ban on flights of two hours or less. The two
chambers will have to hammer out a compromise before sending it to
President Bush for his signature.
   Spokesman Gary Miller of the Tobacco Institute, the cigarette
industry trade group, predicted that the two chambers would produce
``a less extreme piece of legislation.''
   But Jo Ellen Deutsch, who as lobbyist for the Association of
Flight Attendants worked for the restrictions, said she thought the
total ban would get final congressional approval.
   ``The Senate showed very clearly that they do worry about the
health of people who come in contact with cigarette smoke,'' she
said.
   The Senate version would extend the ban to all U.S. routes 95
days after the bill becomes law. The current restrictions, which
cover four-fifths of all flights, will otherwise expire next April.
   As under current law, passengers caught smoking would be subject
to $1,000 fines and people found to have disabled smoke detectors in
aircraft restrooms would face penalties of up to $2,000. Paper
stored in lavatories makes that part of an airliner the riskiest
spot for a fire.
   Tobacco-state senators, seeing the numbers were against them, had
said Wednesday that they would accept a permanent smoking ban on
routes of two hours or less. When Lautenberg and his supporters
refused to make the concession, ban opponents threatened to use
procedural delays to slow the Senate's work to a crawl.
   That effort was ended by the 77-21 vote. Shortly afterward,
another procedural vote went 65-34 for ban supporters and the battle
was over.
   Opponents of the ban had argued that there is no scientific proof
that cigarette fumes harm the health of non-smokers, and that the
smoke is merely one of many chemicals adrift in the recirculated air
inside airliners. They called on supporters to await a
Transportation Department study on airliner air quality expected by
early next year.
   They also said the restriction would hurt tobacco growers.
   But supporters cited several studies concluding that non-smokers
risk cancer and other diseases by inhaling cigarette smoke, and said
there was no reason to wait for a total prohibition.
   ``The American people are overwhelmingly in support of this
suspension of smoking on airliners,'' Lautenberg said.
   The bill allows $11.9 billion in new spending for transportation,
and the expenditure of $15.9 billion in previously collected fuel
and passenger taxes.
   The measure includes $12.2 billion for highway projects, $7.3
billion for aviation programs and $3 billion for mass transit
assistance.

   The Agriculture Department said Thursday that
the Alaska Pulp Corp. and the Forest Service have agreed to major
changes in the company's long-term timber contract for the Tongass
National Forest in Alaska.
   ``The contract revisions address concerns expressed by Congress
and the public over the last few years,'' Forest Service Chief F.
Dale Robertson said in a statement. ``The most significant change is
that the federal government and the taxpayers will get full market
value for the timber sold.''
   Robertson said changes include:
   _An upward rate provision that is expected to boost the price of
timber harvested to as much as $80 or $90 per 1,000 board-feet from
$1.47 per 1,000 board-feet, depending on market value.
   _Much closer conformity with other timber sale contracts.
   _Forest Service selection and designation of timber to be
harvested; harvesting must be completed on existing units before new
areas will be made available.
   Robertson said the contract with Alaska Pulp was initiated in
1956 as part of an effort to promote economic development in
southeast Alaska and to provide stable employment for residents.
   It is one of two remaining long-term timber sale contracts that
have been questioned by Congress and the public, particularly for
the value received for Tongass timber, he said.
   The other long-term contract is with Ketchikan Pulp Co. It has
been renegotiated and rates for timber already have been adjusted in
line with current market conditions, Robertson said.

   ``Absolutely no harm to any proper interest will result'' from a

   A gunman shot and killed an unarmed
policeman and wounded another at a highway service station Thursday,
and hours later the attacker was found dead with a single gunshot in
the head, police said.
   News reports said the gunman committed suicide.
   The attack came after the police apparently made a routine stop
at a gas station near Manchester, 164 miles northwest of London.
   The gunman, identified as Anthony Kenneth Hughes, walked over to
police Inspector Raymond Codling, 49, and shot him twice at close
range in the head and chest, police said. The other officer, Sgt.
James Bowden, 45, was shot in the leg, but was recovering in the
hospital.
   There was no immediate report on the motive for the attack.
   Manchester police said the officers were checking the station
because it had been used in the past as a resting place for
fugitives. However, the officers had not been seeking to arrest
Hughes, police said.
   The officers were not carrying weapons, like most British police
officers.
   The Police Federation rejected calls for police to carry guns.
   ``The British police force are proud of being unarmed, and we
would not want to be armed,'' said chairman Alan Eastwood.
   The killing brought to 21 the number of police officers slain
while on duty in England, Scotland and Wales since 1980.
   Immediately after the attack, police began a nationwide hunt for
the killer, who escaped by motorcycle from the station's parking lot.
   The suspect, dressed in a black leather motorcycle suit, appeared
at Barnsley, 30 miles east of Manchester, and asked to see a Roman
Catholic priest who was away at a funeral, police said. He then went
inside a garage at the priest's home, they said.
   Superintendent Terry Swann of Barnsley police said the headmaster
of a neighboring primary school, who had heard of the shootings and
was approached by the gunman, became suspicious and called the
police.
   Barnsley police were issued with guns and evacuated the school.
As they surrounded the garage, a single shot was heard and the man
was found dead inside with a handgun nearby, Swann said.
   Manchester police said Hughes, 42, had served 15 years in prison
for robbery, burglary and rape convictions. He had lived with his
stepfather in Manchester.

   Showers and thunderstorms fell Thursday over the eastern
two-thirds of the nation, and unseasonably cool weather in the
Midwest and the Southwest broke or tied temperature records up to 44
years old in seven cities.
   Southern Texas had locally heavy overnight and morning rain,
including 6 inches west of Rio Grande City, that caused local
flooding.
   Showers and thunderstorms also fell in southern New England, New
York, Pennsylvania, from New Jersey to eastern Florida, Ohio,
Indiana, Kentucky, Tennessee, Mississippi and Louisiana, Kansas and
Missouri.
   Heavier rainfall during the 6 hours up to 2 p.m. EDT included 2{
inches in Indianapolis and Dayton, Ohio, and 1 1-3 inch in Jackson,
Tenn., and more than an inch in Dyersburg, Tenn.
   The cold front that brought rain to the nation's midsection also
dropped temperatures to record levels.
   In Raton, N.M., the mercury dipped to 30 degrees, 4 degrees lower
than the record set in 1945. Records also were set in Norfolk, Neb.
(35 degrees, 36 in 1945); Goodland, Kan. (38, 39 in 1961); Amarillo,
Texas (40, 44 in 1945); and Midland, Texas (51, 52 in 1975). Records
were tied in Pueblo, Colo. (36 degrees, 1945) and Albuquerque (46,
1967).
   The low temperature for the lower 48 states was 19 degrees in
Gunnison, Colo. Temperatures around the nation at 3 p.m. EDT ranged
from 50 degrees in Houlton, Maine, to 104 degrees in Palm Springs,
Calif.
   The forecast for Friday called for showers and thunderstorms from
Maine to Georgia, the Appalachians, the Ohio and Tennessee valleys,
Alabama, Mississippi, the Florida Panhandle and southeast Louisiana.
   Temperatures were expected to remain unseasonably low from
Illinois to northwest Texas and along the northern Pacific Coast.
   High temperatures were forecast in the 60s from northern New
England to inland New York and in central Oklahoma, near 90 degrees
in Florida, in the 90s to near 105 degrees through the desert
Southwest and in the 70s and 80s in the rest of the nation.

   World sugar production is estimated at 106.75
million metric tons in 1989-90, down 504,000 tons from a previous
forecast in June, the Agriculture Department said Thursday.
   Despite the decline from earlier prospects, the new crop is
expected to be at a record level and nearly 1.3 million tons more
than in 1988-89, the department's Economic Research Service said in
its report.
   However, global sugar consumption is expected to rise 1 percent
to 108.72 million tons, exceeding production for the fifth straight
year. That would put world stockpiles at their lowest level since
1980-81, the report said.
   World raw sugar prices, Contract No. 11, delivered to ships at
Caribbean ports, rose from an average of 9.7 cents per pound in
January to 14 cents in August, the report said. World prices of
refined sugar, Contract No. 5 at European ports, increased from 12.6
cents in Janurary to 22.5 cents in August.
   ``The run-up reflects unexpected purchases by the Soviets,
prospects of heavy buying from India, and delays in Brazil's
exports,'' the report said.

   Solidarity leader Lech Walesa said Thursday
he will likely tour Poland in an effort to persuade Poles to give
the new non-Communist government the time it needs to combat
economic ills.
   In Washington, President Bush announced he will double to $100
million next year's U.S. food aid to Poland. Bush has been under
congressional pressure to increase aid in order to bolster Polish
reforms.
   The food aid is separate from a $119 million package of economic
assistance to Poland previously announced by the White House.
   In his remarks, Walesa rejected a suggestion that Poles might
prove unwilling to accept the hardships imposed by radical economic
reform.
   ``There is nothing to be given up, for the market is already
empty,'' he said in a reference to Poland's severe shortages of food
and other basic supplies. Long lines for many commodities are common.
   However, Walesa said there is a need to repeat his appeal for a
six-month moratorium on strikes to give the new government a chance
to put its policies to work.
   ``There is a need to talk and give arguments,'' he said during a
news conference at Solidarity headquarters in the Baltic port of
Gdansk.
   ``That is why I will probably now make a tour around Poland,
meeting with people ... talking directly,'' Walesa said. ``Polish
society is bright and if issues are explained well ... it will
understand what Poland needs.''
   Thursday was the second day in office for the ministers of the
new Solidarity-controlled government.
   Prime Minister Tadeusz Mazowiecki, a Solidarity newspaper editor
until he took on his historic mission Aug. 24, held only one
publicly reported meeting Thursday. It was a session with Austrian
vice-chancellor Josef Riegler.
   Mazowiecki, who had been an adviser to Walesa, is leading the
East bloc's first non-Communist government since the Communists
consolidated power after World War II.
   Many of the new government's plans to introduce Western-style
economic reform to combat triple-digit inflation, its $39 billion
foreign debt and other economic ills are likely to further undermine
a lagging standard of living, Mazowiecki has said.
   The new political leadership has declared that the sacrifices
will be needed for long-term gains, but they are clearly worried
about public patience and support.
   No details were offered on the trip suggested by Walesa.
   On two previous occasions this year, he has used his tremendous
personal influence with Poles.
   He traveled around Poland to urge workers not to strike while
talks were under way last spring that resulted in the
re-legalization of his labor movement.
   He also made stops around the country to advocate support for
Solidarity campaigns during the unprecedented democratic
parliamentary elections in June. Solidarity won a sweeping victory
and then successfully bargained to lead the government.
   In his comments Thursday, Walesa also looked ahead, saying
political divisions between Solidarity and the Communist Party are
now following ``a new confrontational model ... not by means of
force but a peaceful confrontation.''
   ``After pluralism's victory, there will not be a need for a
confrontational structure,'' he said, predicting the advent of other
political parties and other trade unions.
   The official PAP news agency reported Thursday that Communist
parliament deputies have put forward a proposal to revise the law on
political parties to create the legal conditions for founding
parties and establishing their equal rights.
   In his remarks, Walesa also said he wants to ``internationalize''
the Polish economy, turning to countries like France and the

<HEAD>Lawmakers Criticize Administration Silence On Khmer Rouge</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Several lawmakers accused the Bush
administration Thursday of failing to take a strong enough position
against the Khmer Rouge faction in Cambodia, with one declaring:
``I'm angry as hell about this.''
   When the Khmer Rouge, headed by Pol Pot, controlled Cambodia in
the early 1970s, their forces killed as many as 2 million people, a
devastation portrayed in the well-known movie, ``The Killing
Fields.''
   Rep. Chester G. Atkins, D-Mass., told a top State Department
official that the United States was not vocal enough about opposing
the Chinese-backed Khmer Rouge at an international conference on
Cambodia held in Paris over the summer.
   The conference, held to work out a political solution for the
future of Cambodia, foundered because various factions could not
agree.
   In the United States, there is increasing concern about the
prospect of continuing conflict in Cambodia if the Vietnamese
occupation troops withdraw _ as Hanoi has pledged _ from the
neighboring country at the end of the month.
   Rep. Stephen Solarz, D-N.Y., chairman of the House Foreign
Affairs subcommittee on Asian and Pacific Affairs, said the failure
of the conference and the withdrawal of troops ``creates the very
real possibility that the genocidal Khmer Rouge could battle its way
back to power in Phnom Penh.''
   Richard Solomon, the assistant secretary of State for East Asian
and Pacific Affairs, told the hearing that the Bush administration
wants ``no role for the Khmer Rouge in a future Cambodian
government.''
   The Unites States would like to see an interim Cambodian
government headed by its ally, former Cambodian leader Prince
Sihanouk. Washington provides open and secret aid to Sihanouk.
   Despite the U.S. position on the Khmer Rouge, the United States
agreed with Sihanouk, China and Asian allies that the changes for
long-term peace in Cambodia would be enhanced if the Khmer Rouge
were part of a coalition government, Solomon said.
   ``In other words, total exclusiion of the Khmer Rouge is seen by
those most directly involved as a sure formula for civil warfare,
while their inclusion holds out some prospect that the struggle can
be contained within a political process monitored by the
international community,'' he said.
   Atkins and other attacked the administration for not being tough
enough on the Khmer Rouge. ``I'm angry as hell about this,'' Atkins
said, complaining of the U.S. position.
   He accused the Bush administration of remaining silent about the
Khmer Rouge's past activities in conference working sessions, and
said it was ``part of a pattern'' in the administration of publicly
professing distrust of the Khmer Rouge, but not carrying through
with actions.
   Rep. Jim Leach, R-Iowa, the subcommittee's ranking Republican,
said the United States ``does not have the luxury of recusing
itself'' on moral issues, such as the past genocidal practices of
the Khmer Rouge.
   Leach suggested Pol Pot be bought before an international court
charged with war crimes.
   At Solarz' request, the hearing was moved behind closed doors so
Solomon could explain the U.S. position on the Khmer Rouge.
   Solarz acknowledged the United States sometimes had to make
alliances with unsavory groups, such as the U.S.-Soviet pact with
Joseph Stalin in World War II. The two were allied against Adolf
Hilter.
   At the same time, he pressed Solomon on whether the United States
characterized the Khmer Rouge as having practiced genocide under the
Senate-ratified genocide treaty. The Khmer Rouge object to the word.
   Solomon said that at the Paris conference, the United States
supported language referring to the group's ``genocidal practices.''

<HEAD>Head of IMF Asks Doubling of Fund's Assets</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The head of the International Monetary Fund
said Thursday that IMF resources need to be doubled so that the
multinational lending agency can provide more help to poor countries.
   The request by IMF Managing Director Michel Camdessus will likely
be the main topic of discussion when finance officials from 151
nations gather in Washington later this month for the annual
meetings of the IMF and its sister organization, the World Bank.
   The IMF is owned by the 151 countries with the largest share,
$23.6 billion, coming from the United States. The U.S. share is out
of total IMF resources of $118 billion.
   The IMF resources, called quotas, are provided by member
countries, which pledge to keep a certain level of their financial
reserves with the IMF.
   In making his request, Camdessus said that 19 of the 22 members
of the IMF board had indicated that they supported an increase of at
least 66 percent, but he said a boost in resources of at least 80
percent was needed to keep the IMF from being forced to ``limit the
access of member countries to our help.''
   The IMF and the World Bank have been key players in the Bush
administration's new debt reduction strategy unveiled by Treasury
Secretary Nicholas Brady on March 10.
   The Brady plan seeks to reduce the $1.3 trillion Third World debt
burden by getting commercial banks to voluntarily write off a
portion of the debt in exchange from guarantees from the two lending
agencies that a portion of the reduced debt will be repaid.
   In another development Wednesday, John Reed, chairman of
Citicorp, the country's largest bank, said that he was concerned
that the Brady debt plan was being viewed solely as an effort reduce
debt at the exclusion of new loans from commercial banks.
   ``Our purpose, after all, is to restore economic and financial
health to these economies _ which are important markets for the
United States _ not to cut them off totally from the banking
system,'' Reed said at a news conference in Washington.
   Some countries have already endorsed a doubling of IMF resources,
but some U.S. officials have said they are not yet convinced that
any increase is needed.
   In recent years the fund's money has gone for new loans to Third
World countries, many of them heavily in debt, in return for pledges
of policy changes to put them in better financial condition.
   Sen. Bill Bradley, D-N.J., said on Wednesday that Congress would
likely give a cool reception to any request from the president
unless the administration agreed to boost government resources by
raising raxes.
   Rep. Jim Leach, R-Iowa, said that while Congress would initially
be reluctant, it would eventually go along with the administration.
   Critics of the IMF have been questioning the value of its efforts.
   Jeffrey D. Sachs, professor of international trade at Harvard
University, said that the IMF has a record of failure in debtor
countries.
   He said that of 39 or so countries that have been wrestling with
debt problems, few have been able to meet their obligations without
undermining their national prosperity.
   The World Bank announced, meanwhile, that Afghanistan has
restored itself to good standing with a payment of $755,000.
   It was made ineligible for new loans in June because it was
overdue on about $26 million worth of debt. Afghanistan owes the
bank about $79 million on 20 low-interest loans amounting to $230
million that it received in past years.

<HEAD>Strike by Azerbaijani Rail Workers Hits Armenia</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Pravda reported on Thursday that a walkout by
Azerbaijani rail workers to back up nationalist and ethnic demands
has cut fuel supplies to adjacent Armenia and left ambulances,
trucks and cars without gas.
   It said the lack of fuel and supplies posed a particular threat
in northern Armenia, where reconstruction is under way of cities
wrecked by the Dec. 7 earthquake that killed 25,000 people.
   ``The coming winter is putting people under the real threat of
being without shelter,'' Pravda said.
   The party newspaper quoted Armenia's deputy premier, Y.
Khodzhamiryan, as saying, ``Because of the halt on the Azerbaijan
railroad, Armenia is practically in a state of economic blockade.''
   He told the paper that the southern republic of Armenia gets 87
percent of its freight, including fuel supplies, from Azerbaijan.
   The two Caucasus mountain republics have been in a fierce dispute
since February over who should control Nagorno-Karabakh region,
which lies in Azerbaijan but has a population that is 75 percent
ethnic Armenian.
   The Azerbaijani People's Front political movement listed as one
demand in calling a general strike last week that Azerbaijan
reassert control over Nagorno-Karabakh in place of direct rule from
Moscow.
   The strike was called off last Monday. It was not among any
stated aim of the walkout that supplies to Armenia be cut.
   The Armenian-Azerbaijani dispute has led to violence that killed
about 100 people since last year and forced hundreds of thousands to
flee their homes.
   Soviet newspapers say the situation remains tense and that the
region is a powder keg.
   Pravda said the 19-mile road from Goris in Armenia to the
Nagorno-Karabakh boundary is so dangerous it is ``impossible to pass
even with a military escort.''
   On Wednesday, the national youth newspaper Komsomolskaya Pravda
said few cars were operating on even the main streets of Yerevan,
the Armenian capital, and large gaps intervened in public transport
service.
   Pravda said even ambulances could not fill up at service stations.

   The Senate, responding to a growing wave of
drug-related violence in the nation's capital, Thursday approved a
bill to finance the hiring of 700 additional District of Columbia
police officers.
   The $23 million package, already approved by the House, comes on
top of the city's plan to hire 300 extra officers. The two measures
will bring the force to about 5,000 officers.
   ``We need to send a signal that we are retaking the streets of
Washington,'' Sen. Brock Adams, D-Wash., said after an
appropriations committee hearing Tuesday. ``This will not solve the
drug problem, but we certainly hope that it will help.''
   The move, which passed without debate on a voice vote, likely
will provide some relief to officers who have been working 12-hour
shifts since August to help combat drug-related violence.
   In March, most officers were assigned to six-day weeks, with
officers from all parts of the city assigned to patrol drug-infested
neighborhoods on their sixth tour of duty. That plan was abandoned
when the crime rate slowed, but the 12-hour shift plan was created
when the crime wave rose again.
   Police have blamed crack cocaine for an explosion of drug-related
violence in Washington.
   Through Thursday, 318 people had been killed in the District of
Columbia in 1989, compared with 228 at the same time last year. A
record 372 people were killed in the district in 1988.
   The money to hire extra officers will come from special use of a
lump-sum water and sewer payment the federal government provides the
city. The city will be reimbursed for those funds by directly
billing federal agencies in the city.

<TEXT>
   The House Ways and Means Committee reversed
itself Thursday, voting to keep for at least two years a tax
deduction for health insurance premiums paid by farmers and other
self-employed people.
   The committee voted to kill the 25 percent deduction earlier this
year because of the cost of the 3-year-old tax break, $2.3 billion
for the next five years.
   However, Rep. Byron Dorgan, D-N.D., won approval of an amendment
Thursday to extend the deduction for two years and make up for the
lost revenue by limiting a tax break used by companies bought
through leveraged buyouts.
   ``The 25 percent tax deduction is very important to farmers and
others on Main Street who are unincorporated,'' Dorgan said.
   The amendment to a budget reconciliation bill was approved on a
voice vote.
   Dorgan had originally proposed increasing the health-insurance
deduction to 100 percent.
   A coalition of organizations as diverse as the American Farm
Bureau Federation, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and Amway contended
it was unfair to allow corporations to deduct all their health
insurance costs while self-employed people can write off only a
portion.
   Administration officials argued against extending the tax break,
saying it represented ``a significant revenue loss'' and doesn't
provide sufficient incentive for uninsured self-employed people to
buy health policies.
   Rep. Dan Rostenkowski, D-Ill., dropped his opposition to the tax
break when Dorgan came up with a way to make up for the lost
revenue, about $600,000 over the next two years.
   Dorgan's amendment would prevent companies acquired in a
leveraged buyout from going back to previous years and claiming
operating losses because of their new, higher interest payments.
   Dorgan says he expects the Senate to approve extending the tax
break.
   Sen. Dave Durenberger, R-Minn., is sponsoring a similar proposal
in the Senate.

<HEAD>Egyptian Peace Plan Stirs Differences in Israel</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak's efforts to
bring together Palestinians and Israelis for peace talks exposed
political rifts within the Israeli government Thursday.
   In violence stemming from the Palestinian uprising, Israeli
forces killed a suspected activist and reportedly wounded 25
Palestinians in clashes.
   In separate interviews, Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir's
right-wing Likud bloc and its left-of-center coalition partner, the
Labor party, debated Mubarak's plan.
   Shamir, speaking in Herzeliya, urged the government ``to remain
loyal toward its initiative'' for elections in the occupied West
Bank and the Gaza Strip.
   The official Israeli plan calls for elections in the occupied
West Bank and Gaza Strip of Palestinian representatives for talks
with Israel. The 10-point plan proposed by Mubarak also urges
elections, but it differs by backing the idea of trading land for
peace and by saying Arabs in annexed east Jerusalem should vote.
   Palestinians have so far rejected the official Israeli
initiative, and U.S. officials say Mubarak's plan could help revive
the stalled peace process.
   In remarks Thursday, Shamir said any ``free initiative'' within
the Israeli government could endanger its unity, the national news
agency Itim reported.
   He also scheduled a second government meeting Friday on Mubarak's
proposals after a first session Wednesday reportedly ended in
division between his Likud bloc and the Labor Party.
   According to reports from Cairo, Mubarak is trying to form a
Palestinian delegation acceptable to both Israel and the Palestine
Liberation Organization. Israel considers the PLO, which is helping
to organize the uprising, a terrorist group and refuses to negotiate
with its members.
   The top Labor leaders, Finance Minister Shimon Peres and Defense
Minister Yitzhak Rabin, have said Israel should support Egypt's
efforts toward finding negotiators from the occupied territories.
   Labor Parliament member Benjamin Ben-Eliezer said on army radio
Thursday that Shamir's plan and Mubarak's move ``together can be a
solid enough basis to start negotiations.''
   Both Israeli and Palestinian hard-liners attacked Mubarak's plan
Thursday.
   The Islamic fundamentalist movement Hamas, or Zeal, said in a
leaflet distributed in the occupied lands that the plan should be
rejected as a U.S-backed initiative.
   Two leading members of Likud, Industry Minister Ariel Sharon and
Housing Minister David Levy, criticized Shamir and other top leaders
for even discussing Mubarak's proposal as an alternative to the
Israeli plan.
   Sharon told Israel radio: ``There is no other plan, and there is
no need for another plan.''
   In Thursday's violence, a 28-year-old man wanted as an activist
in the 21-month-old Palestinian uprising was shot and killed by
Israeli soldiers in the Deir Balah refugee camp in the occupied Gaza
Strip.
   The army said troops opened fire on the victim, Mohammed Arafat
Al-Akra, when he ignored orders to halt.
   His death raised to 568 the number of Palestinians killed in
clashes with soldiers and Israeli civilians in the revolt. Another
114 Palestinians were slain by fellow Arabs as suspected
collaborators with Israel. Forty Israelis also have been killed.
   Twenty-five other Palestinians were shot and wounded Thursday in
clashes with soldiers in the occupied lands, Arab hospital officials
said.
   The army command only confirmed three injuries.
   In Jerusalem District Court, a Palestinian accused of slaying 16
Jews by grabbing the steering wheel of a bus and forcing it into a
ravine pleaded guilty to murder.
   However, Abdel Hadi Ghanem, 23, entered a plea of innocent to a
separate charge that the crime was premeditated.
   Authorities say he was motivated by Palestinian nationalism, but
he reportedly told investigators he was avenging a beating of a
friend by soldiers.
   The July 6 attack was the worst against Jews in the Palestinian
uprising.

<TEXT>
   The Senate Appropriations Committee on Thursday
approved a $288.2 billion military spending bill that slashes
President Bush's request for the troubled Trident 2 missile and
trims the budget for Star Wars.
   Without dissent, the panel adopted legislation that eliminates
all of the $1.8 billion for procurement of the missile but adds $70
million to Bush's request of $216 million for research and
development of the submarine-launched weapon.
   The Senate action comes almost one month after a Trident 2
missile exploded seconds after being launched from the nuclear
submarine Tennessee about 200 miles off the coast of Florida.
   Members of the Appropriations subcommittee on defense, which
recommended cutting the program, said two successive failures in
undersea test firings prompted the panel's action.
   ``It was an obvious necessity,'' Sen. Dale Bumpers, D-Ark., said
earlier this week.
   ``It's time to regroup,'' said Sen. Ted Stevens of Alaska,
ranking Republican on the subcommittee.
   Pentagon spokesman Pete Williams said Thursday that the Navy is
not yet yet ready to cite the exact cause of the lastest test
failure of the Trident 2 D-5 missile, but it is expected to do so
soon.
   ``The Navy is confident that technical resolution (of the
problem) will not require a major redesign of the missile,''
Williams said, adding that corrects may still make possible
deployment on schedule in March 1990.
   A delay, Williams said, ``is not anticipated.''
   In addition to reducing funds earmarked for the Trident 2, the
Appropriations Committee agreed to cut research and development
money for the Star Wars anti-missile shield to $3.7 million, which,
when added to the $355 million in Energy Department money and
military construction funds, leaves a total of about $4.1 billion.
   Bush had requested $4.9 billion for Star Wars, formally the
Strategic Defense Initiative, in his budget for the fiscal year
beginning Oct. 1. The Senate authorization bill put the SDI amount
at $4.5 billion while the House authorization and appropriations
legislation both provide $3.1 billion.
   Differences in the House and Senate appropriations bills will
have to be resolved by a conference committee.
   While agreeing to the cut, the Appropriations Committee also
adopted an amendment requiring that $820 million of the $3.7 billion
be used for research on lasers and particle beams. The vote was
16-11.
   ``The purpose and architecture of SDI has been a constantly
changing ball game,'' said Sen. Bennett Johnston, D-La., sponsor of
the amendment. ``With this bill, we will have spent over $20 billion
on SDI, still without a purpose, still without an architecture.''
   Johnston expressed concerns that the Bush administration will
sacrifice long-term research on directed energy weapons such as
lasers and particle beams in favor of a ``quick fix or a Phase 1
deployment'' that would favor mini-missiles fired at incoming enemy
missiles along the lines of the so-called ``Brillian Pebbles''
scheme favored by many in the Bush administration.
   The spending bill, which mirrors the authorization package
approved by the full Senate, leaves most of Bush's programs such as
the B-2 stealth bomber and the MX and Midgetman nuclear missiles
relatively intact.
   The panel also approved $255 million for the Marine Corps to test
the V-22 Osprey, a vertical-takeoff plane, and accepted the
president's decision to kill the Navy's F-14D jet fighter.
   After some discussion, Sens. Johnston and Bumpers withdrew an
amendment calling for Bush to withdraw 3,000 of the 43,800 U.S.
military personnel now stationed in South Korea and requiring the
president to study and report to Congress on troop levels there.
   ``We are not reneging on our committment to defend South Korea,''
said Bumpers, arguing that South Korea can afford to foot more of
the bill for defense.
   The Appropriations panel also approved a $7.7 billion military
construction bill that makes wholesale cuts in spending in the
Philippines and South Korea.
   The bill is $1.3 billion below this year's level and about $300
million less than Bush's request.

<TEXT>
   Former HUD Secretary Samuel Pierce, claiming he
has not had time to prepare, on Thursday abruptly canceled his plans
to testify before a House subcommittee investigating scandals at the
agency he led for eight years.
   ``I have fully and completely cooperated with the subcommittee
right up until today, but its refusal to allow me an additional two
weeks preparation time, when numerous other witnesses have been
granted even longer postponements, simply is unfair,'' Pierce said
in a statement the day before his scheduled appearance.
   He stressed that he is willing to testify voluntarily later.
   ``One would think that common courtesy and basic fairness demand
that the subcommittee grant to any citizen ... sufficient time to
consult counsel and prepare testimony,'' said Pierce.
   Rep. Thomas Lantos, the subcommittee chairman, characterized
Pierce's dramatic decision not to appear as ``deceitful, misleading,
and a betrayal of the good faith with which this subcommittee has
dealt with him.''
   Lantos said that if Pierce did not appear Friday he would ask the
panel to issue a subpoena forcing him to appear. Procedural rules
would prevent such a vote until next week, and Pierce's lawyer said
he hoped Lantos would reconsider and simply agree to reschedule
Pierce's appearance.
   But a Republican member of the subcommittee, Rep. Christopher
Shays of Connecticut, said the decision ``tells me he's got
something to hide. If he doesn't show up we are going to subpoena
Mr. Pierce for a series of hearings. We obviously can't trust him.''
   Pierce has emerged as the central figure in the subcommittee's
investigation of mismanagement and influence peddling at HUD during
the Reagan administration.
   The former secretary informed the panel last week that he had had
trouble retaining legal counsel and requested a two-week delay in
his appearance. But Lantos, who had previously agreed to push back
Pierce's testimony by a month, denied the request.
   ``I initially delayed obtaining counsel because I believed the
investigation was being conducted in a non-adversarial manner that
did not require counsel,'' Pierce said in his statement. ``After it
became apparent that this situation had changed, I undertook
exhaustive efforts to local experienced counsel.''
   Pierce last week settled on Washington attorney Paul Perito, who
said in an interview Thursday that he and his colleagues have not
had enough time to weed through boxes of documents that Pierce would
need to review.
   ``I did not think I could be a responsible lawyer if in fact we
went forward (Friday),'' Perito said.
   The subcommittee is eager to question Pierce about a number of
controversial decisions he made, including his lifting restrictions
on a lender after he was lobbied by former Secretary Carla Hills and
his overruling career experts in favor of financing a project backed
by a former law partner.
   Several members, including Lantos, have said they want to
question Pierce about contradictions in his testimony to the panel
in May and the accounts of other former HUD officials.
   Perito, in a letter to Lantos informing him of Pierce's decision,
said:
   ``In order for Mr. Pierce to be completely prepared, the full
record must be reviewed. ... Regrettably, the subcommittee's refusal
to allow him an additional two weeks ... forced us to conclude
reluctantly that continued voluntary cooperation does not afford him
adequate procedural safeguards and guarantees of fairness. For this
reason, among others, he has authorized me to inform you that he
will not voluntarily appear.''
   Perito said the subcommittee has not informed Pierce what
portions of his May testimony are considered to be inconsistent.
   ``This is of particular concern where, as here, there appears to
be no separate legislative purpose for inquiring about
`inconsistencies' other than to invite potential charges of
perjury.''
   A few hours before Pierce refused to appear, Lantos said he hoped
the former secretary would use his testimony to accept blame for
some of the agency's problems.
   ``He has not yet said `mea culpa, mea maxima culpa, I have made
horrible mistakes,''' Lantos said.
   ``Obviously we have sworn testimony that contradicts Secretary
Pierce's sworn testimony,'' Lantos said.
   Friday's hearing was to focus on Pierce's decisions to back the
North Carolina project supported by a former law partner and the
lifting of restrictions on the DRG Funding Corp. after being lobbied
by Mrs. Hills, now the Bush administration trade representative.
   Pierce had said he was not a ``hands-on'' manager and took no
direct role in funding decisions.
   A former deputy, however, later told Congress that Pierce
personally ordered her to approve a $15 million Durham, N.C.,
housing project that was opposed by several career officials.
   Pierce, in a Time magazine interview published this week,
acknowledged overruling staff and ordering the project forward. It
was supported by Charles Markham, then mayor of Durham who practiced
law with Pierce in the 1960s.
   DRG, the biggest lender under a departmental co-insurance
program, has a HUD loan portfolio that includes more than $538
million in defaults. Mrs. Hills met with Pierce after her lobbying
of other officials failed, and he agreed to lift restrictions that
required DRG to get departmental approval before making any loans.

   A fifth young white man was indicted on murder
charges Thursday for his alleged role in the fatal attack on a black
teen-ager, as about 150 black youths gathered outside the court and
angrily shouted epithets.
   James Patino, 24, of the borough of Brooklyn was charged in the
19-count indictment with one count of second-degree murder, one
count of fifth degree manslaughter and several counts of riot,
assault, unlawful imprisonment, menacing, aggravated harassment, and
criminal possession of a deadly weapon.
   Patino, who remained free on $75,000 bail, said nothing during
his brief appearance before Criminal Court Judge Seymour Gerschwer
and walked quickly out of the court room with his lawyer.
   A short time later, about 150 black youths, many of them students
on lunch break from a high school next to the courthouse, pursued
another of the suspects in the attack and his lawyer as they left
the courthouse.
   The crowd chanted ``Fight the Power'' _ the title of a rap song
from ``Do The Right Thing,'' Spike Lee's recent movie about racial
tension in Brooklyn _ and yelled obscenities at police as the pair
climbed into a police car and sped away.
   Several rocks were hurled, striking a police officer and a
television reporter. No one was seriously hurt and there were no
arrests, the police said.
   Patino was charged with murder because he exhibited ``a depraved
indifference to human life'' and ``recklessly engaged in conduct
which created a grave risk of death,'' the indictment said.
   His lawyer, Abraham Jaros, disputed the charges, saying ``It's
difficult to understand how a young man, simply because he was
present on the street, can be charged with murder.''
   The suspect targeted by the demonstrators, Charles Stressler, 21,
was arrested but has not been indicted in the Aug. 23 attack and
also appeared at Thursday's hearing. Gerschwer warned prosecutors he
would dismiss the cases against Stressler and another suspect,
Steven Curreri, 18, if indictments were not returned by Oct. 16.
   Four other young men have been previously indicted on murder
charges. All but one remain free on bail. Two other young men have
been arrested but have not been indicted.
   The victim, 16-year-old Yusuf Hawkins, was shot when he and three
friends went to the predominantly white Bensonhurst section of
Brooklyn to look at an advertised car.

   The emergency room at Oral Roberts' City of
Faith hospital closed Thursday, marking the first step in the
ministry's plans to shutter the hospital and a medical school to
help pay $25 million in debts.
   Roberts announced Wednesday the hospital will be closed by the
end of the year and the Oral Roberts University School of Medicine
will close after the current school year. He also said his home,
four other ministry-owned homes and an 832-unit student housing
complex would be sold.
   The action is necessary to help pay $25 million in debt, Roberts
said, so that ministry officials can concentrate on keeping his
4,300-student university financially secure.
   Dr. Larry Edwards, vice president for health affairs at the
ministry, said closing the emergency room at the City of Faith
Medical and Research Center will be the first of many steps taken to
shut the 777-bed hospital.
   The city's five other medical centers will have no problem
handling the patient load from the City of Faith, which has never
reached its state-approved capacity of 294, and in absorbing its 600
employees, Tulsa hospital officials said.
   ``There is a need for qualified medical personnel, such as nurses
and physical therapists, in Tulsa,'' said Steve Reynolds, spokesman
for St. John Medical Center in Tulsa.
   Harry Salem, vice president of the ministry and brother-in-law of
Roberts' evangelist son Richard, said it was business as usual
Thursday at the ministry's 400-acre south Tulsa complex.
   ``They all got up this morning and went to work,'' Salem said.
``Oral went to the office. Richard got on television (for his daily
religious show) to pray for the people. They're going to keep on
ministering.''
   Few people familiar with recent events at the ministry were
surprised by the plan to eliminate the core of the 71-year-old
faith-healer's medical ministry.
   At least one ORU medical student voiced frustration after hearing
of Roberts' plan to close the medical school.
   ``Yeah, I feel like they jerked me around a little bit, but
they're doing what they can,'' said third-year student Joseph
Scoggins.
   Scoggins and other juniors at the medical school will be hit the
hardest by the closing. Edwards said the 27 seniors at the school
will graduate in May and the remaining 120 students will be allowed
to transfer to other medical schools.
   Freshmen and sophomores should be able to transfer to continue
their basic science curriculum, but third-year students typically in
the middle of their clinical rotations could have more problems
transferring, Edwards said.
   ``We will do our best to help them,'' Edwards said.
   Mark Swadener, chief fiscal officer for the Oral Roberts
Evangelical Association, said the ministry's for-profit real estate
company will search for a tenant for the 60-story City of Faith and
the two adjacent buildings.
   ``We'd like to find a tenant, a lead tenant _ a hospital _ to
move into the City of Faith,'' he said.
   Swadener said Bethany Real Estate Inc. also will be searching for
a buyer for the homes of Roberts, his son, and his daughter Roberta,
who also works for the ministry. Two other homes used by ministry
officials also will be sold, he said.
   As for where Oral and Richard Roberts will live if their homes
are sold, the elder evangelist said he really hasn't given that much
thought.
   ``I don't know. The building hasn't sold yet. All I know is I
slept in my bed last night,'' he said.

<HEAD>Psychiatric Disorders Frequent Companion of Sleep Problems, Study
Finds</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BRENDA C. COLEMAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   More than a third of the millions of Americans who
suffer from serious sleep disturbances may also have psychiatric
difficulties, including depression and panic attacks, a study
indicates.
   Researchers who analyzed data on 7,954 people found that 40
percent of those with insomnia and 46.5 percent of those who sleep
excessively, a condition called hypersomnia, also had psychiatric
problmes.
   Psychiatric problems included major depression, anxiety disorders
such as phobias and panic attacks and alcohol abuse, the researchers
reported in Friday's Journal of the American Medical Association.
   About 6 percent of the general adult population suffers from
serious sleep disturbances, the lead researcher, Dr. Daniel E. Ford
of Johns Hopkins Hospital in Baltimore, said in a telephone
interview Thursday. Ford was with the National Institute of Mental
Health, which did the study.
   Ford said it was not always clear whether the psychiatric
disorders caused the sleep disturbances or vice versa.
   However, follow-up interviews a year after the initial screeding
indicated that subjects with sleep disorders were much more likely
to develop new mental disorders, especially depression, than
non-sleep disturbed subjects, the researchers said.
   For example, people who had insomnia at both the first and second
interviews were almost 40 times more likely to develop major
depression than those who didn't, the study found.
   Insomniacs also were more than six times as likely to develop
anxiety disorders and more than twice as likely to start abusing
alcohol as peaceful sleepers.
   ``Ultimately, answering the question of which comes first will
require an intervention trial, in which you try to see if treating
the sleep disorder reduces the number of people with anxiety or
depression,'' Ford said.
   The 7,954 subjects were adults over 18 chosen from representative
households in Baltimore, Los Angeles and Durham, N.C. Of that
number, 10.2 percent were insomniacs and 3.2 percent had hypersomnia.
   The researchers used a ``fairly severe'' definition of sleep
disturbance, Ford said.
   The disturbance must have been present for two or more weeks; it
must have prompted the subject to seek professional help or to take
medication; and it must have interfered with the subject's life ``a
lot,'' he said.
   Ford said the connection between sleep disorders and psychiatric
disturbances isn't appreciated.
   ``Only about 30 percent of the people that had sleep disturbances
that saw a general physician said they discussed their mental health
condition,'' he said.
   An editorial accompanying the study in the Journal agreed, saying
the high prevalence of psychiatric problems among people with sleep
disorders was a ``surprising result.''
   The editorial, written by Dr. Charles F. Reynolds III of the
University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine, commended the study as
being ``probably one of the most scientifically rigorous'' of its
type.
   It is important because it may give doctors a new way to try to
head off some psychiatric problems before they develop, Reynolds
said.
   He encouraged health-care professionals to teach principles of
``sleep hygiene'' to people with sleep problems, including keeping a
daily log and adhering to a regular sleep schedule, teaching
patients how some medications can disrupt sleep, and even training
some insomniacs to limit their sleep hours to create a ``sleep
deficit'' that will promote continuous sleep after they do doze off.

<HEAD>Sandinista Foe Tells of Offer to Have Chamorro Slayers Killed</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The main opposition presidential
candidate, Violetta Barrios de Chamorro, said Thursday that a
Sandinista Cabinet member once offered to have her husband's
suspected killers assassinated.
   She told foreign reporters the incident involved Interior
Minister Tomas Borge and took place while she was a member of the
junta that took power after dictator Anastasio Somoza was overthrown
in 1979.
   The 1978 killing of La Prensa newspaper publisher Pedro Joaquin
Chamorro by gunmen believed to be in Somoza's pay helped ignite the
Sandinista revolution.
   ``Tomas Borge came to my house ... when I became part of the
junta,'' said Mrs. Chamorro, the presidential nominee of an
opposition coalition of 14 parties taking part in elections next
February.
   ``He told me, `Why don't you give me permission to assassinate
all those boys?''' referring to the suspects in Chamorro's killing.
   ``I said, `Look Tomas, I am not an assassin,''' Mrs. Chamorro
said.
   No immediate response came to Mrs. Chamorro's accusation.
Thursday was Independence Day in Nicaragua. People who answered the
telephone at the Interior Ministry press office said Capt. Nelba
Blandon was the only person authorized to talk and was not in.
   On other subjects, Mrs. Chamorro denied she was merely a front
candidate for the opposition or that her newspaper publishes
CIA-inspired articles. She said demobilization of rebels fighting
the government should be made ``along with democratization.''
   Central America's five presidents signed a peace accord on Aug. 7
that calls for the 12,000-man rebel force now in southern Honduras,
near the Nicaraguan border, to be dismantled by mid-December. The
rebels are known as Contras.
   In exchange, President Daniel Ortega moved national elections up
to Feb. 25 and promised that campaigning and voting will be free and
fair, with no restrictions on the press.
   Ortega will probably be the Sandinista National Liberation Front
candidate to face Mrs. Chamorro, publisher of the opposition
newspaper La Prensa.
   Mrs. Chamorro denied Sandinista accusations that her newspaper
recently published articles generated by the Central Intelligence
Agency. ``We don't publish articles by the CIA or by employees of
the CIA,'' she said.
   ``On the other hand, I do see articles in Barricada from the
Soviet Union,'' she added, referring to the official Sandinista
party newspaper.
   Carlos Fernando Chamorro, Mrs. Chamorro's son and director of
Barricada, did not return repeated telephone calls from The
Associated Press.
   Asked if she has forgiven her husband's killers, she replied,
``Of course I do. I am a Catholic, I don't hate, I forgive.''
   Three men and one women are serving prison terms for the
assassination.

   The Senate, ignoring an abortion-related veto
threat, voted 56-43 Wednesday to provide more money to help the
District of Columbia fight a growing army of drug pushers and
drug-related violence.
   The chamber acted after being told the overall $3.5 billion
appropriations bill in which the money is contained is certain to be
vetoed by President Bush because it permits abortions.
   ``This bill is dead,'' Sen. Gordon Humphrey, R-N.H., one of the
chamber's leading opponents of abortion, told the Senate. ``It may
be warm, but it's not breathing; it's done for.''
   Humphrey acknowleged that an amendment to deny the district the
authority to use its own money for abortions likely would be
rejected as it was when the House considered the appropriations
measure in June.
   He said he had decided not to try to remove abortion language
from the bill in the belief that Bush will veto the measure, and
that Congress would not be able to muster the two-thirds majorities
needed to override it.
   He predicted a new bill would be drafted with the offending
language removed and would ``zip right through.''
   As it stands, both House and Senate versions of the bill for the
fiscal year beginning Oct. 1 permit the district government to use
local funds to pay for abortions. The measures permit federal funds
to be used when the life of the mother is threatened or in cases of
rape or incest.
   The bill includes $23 million to hire 700 new policemen, $4.8
million to help the district courts deal with a flood of
drug-related cases, $1.3 million to expand after-school programs in
high-risk neighborhoods and $2 million to set up a program to
provide treatment on demand for pregnant drug addicts.
   The bill also included a controversial amendment that authorizes
Congress to permit religious institutions in the city to deny funds
and recognition to homosexual student groups.
   A similar amendment was included in last year's budget. However,
it was ruled unconstitutional by a federal judge.
   The two houses still must reconcile differences between their
versions of the bill.

   Chinese officials said Thursday they will accept
back all Chinese citizens who entered Japan in recent weeks by
posing as Vietnamese boat people.
   Foreign Ministry spokesman Li Zhaoxing said China has asked Japan
for details on 660 suspected Chinese held in detention centers for
Vietnamese refugees.
   Li said Japan has already provided the names of 39 people
believed to be Chinese citizens.
   He said China would investigate all the cases. ``If it is
verified that they are Chinese, China will accept repatriation,'' he
said.
   Toshio Tsunozaki, director of Japan's Foreign Ministry Human
Rights and Refugee Division, said Tuesday that interviews with the
Chinese showed they came to Japan for economic, not political
reasons.
   Tsunozaki said he hoped the Chinese would not be harshly punished
when they go home.
   Li did not comment on whether they would face legal charges when
they return.

<HEAD>List of Suspects Disappears from Belfast Police Station</HEAD>

   Police said Thursday a
confidential list of IRA suspects had disappeared, and a police
official came from England to find out how such papers slip through
the hands of provincial authorities.
   In an earlier case involving missing documents, three men were
charged on Monday with the murder of Loughlin Maginn, a 38-year-old
Roman Catholic.
   An outlawed Protestant group, the Ulster Freedom Fighters, said
Maginn was identified as a suspected member of the Irish Republican
Army in documents it claimed were leaked by security forces. The
claim was made in an interview with the British Broadcasting Corp.
   Police said the latest missing list contained names and pictures
of 12 IRA suspects and appeared to have been forcibly removed from a
locked cabinet in a Belfast police station.
   John Stevens, deputy chief constable of Cambridgeshire, was
ordered to Northern Ireland to investigate at the request of Hugh
Annesley, chief constable of the Royal Ulster Constabulary. The
constabulary polices this Protestant-dominated British province.
   The police said Stevens will also look into the disappearance of
confidential information from the Ballykinlar army base in County
Down.
   The mainly Catholic IRA, outlawed on both sides of the border, is
fighting to end British rule and unite Northern Ireland with the
Irish Republic.
   Seamus Mallon, deputy leader of the Social Democratic and Labor
Party, said the police service may be involved in the disappearances
of the papers.
   His party speaks for most of the province's Catholic minority.

<DATELINE>COLOMBO, Sri Lanka (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Sri Lanka said Thursday its differences
with India will be solved in days and Indian peacekeeping soldiers
on the island will soon declare an indefinite cease-fire in the
fight against Tamil rebels.
   Foreign Minister Ramjan Wijeratne's announcement came as
officials reported at least 19 more people dead, including a young
TV announcer, in violence connected with the radical Sinhalese
uprising against the government.
   Wijeratne, who is also deputy defense minister, said one issue
remained in Sri Lanka's 3-month-old standoff with India over
withdrawing the 40,000 Indian soldiers.
   ``Negotiations by telephone between the two countries will
resolve it, maybe in a day or two,'' he said, without identifying
the issue.
   On Thursday, joggers found the body of Sagarika Gomase, 27, of
the state Independent Television Network, on a beach in Mount
Lavinia, 10 miles south of Colombo, military officials said. They
blamed Sinhalese extremists.
   Ms. Gomase was abducted from her home in nearby Dehiwela
Wednesday night by six gunmen, they said.
   Elsewhere, six suspected Sinhalese radicals were killed fighting
security forces Wednesday in southern Sri Lanka, the Sinhalese
heartland, a government communique said.
   It said Sinhalese militants shot to death three Sinhalese
civilians and a retired solder.
   In central Kandy district, about 60 miles northeast of Colombo,
security forces found seven unidentified bodies, the communique
said. Soldiers found another body in a Colombo suburb.
   India signed a peace pact with Sri Lanka in July 1987 and sent
soldiers to this island nation to supervise the surrender of weapons
by Tamil militants, who agreed to give up fighting for an
independent homeland in exchange for limited autonomy.
   Die-hard Tamil rebels rejected the plan and turned their guns on
the Indian soldiers. The move also triggered an uprising by radicals
from the dominant Sinhalese community, who complained about
concessions made to the Tamils and described the Indians as an
invading force.
   Indian-Sri Lankan relations eroded after President Ranasinghe
Premadasa unilaterally set a withdrawal deadline of July 29. Indian
Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi refused, saying a hasty pullout might
lead to greater bloodshed.
   A compromise now reportedly provides for Indian troops to leave
by Dec. 31.
   Wijeratne said Premadasa was confident the agreement and
cease-fire will be honored by the most militant Tamil rebel group,
the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam, who this year began peace
talks with the government.
   Tamils comprise 18 percent of Sri Lanka's 16 million people. They
claim they are denied jobs and education by the Sinhalese, who make
up 75 percent of the population and dominate the government and
military.
   The Tamil insurgency began in 1983.
   India became involved in part because of political pressure from
its own 60 million Tamils. Sri Lanka lies 18 miles off India's
southernmost tip.

   Jim Bakker authorized the $265,000 payoff
in PTL funds to Jessica Hahn to keep her quiet about their sexual
tryst, Bakker's former top executive testified Thursday.
   Richard Dortch, former PTL executive vice president, said the
television evangelist told him: ```I have not raped anyone or
assaulted anyone, but there is a problem. ... Do what you have to do
to get it solved.'''
   Dortch told U.S. District Court jurors at Bakker's fraud and
conspiracy trial that he told Bakker about calls from Ms. Hahn
threatening a lawsuit over a 1980 sexual encounter she had with
Bakker in a Florida hotel room.
   Earlier, Dortch testified that Bakker oversold lifetime
partnerships that had become the ministry's primary source of income
used for operating expenses, but did not build lodging as promised.
   Dortch, who pleaded guilty in August to four fraud and conspiracy
counts in a plea-bargain exchange for his testimony against Bakker,
said he paid Ms. Hahn $2,000 from his own pocket and later borrowed
$10,000 from another PTL employee for Ms. Hahn in 1984.
   Dortch arranged a February 1985 meeting in Los Angeles with Ms.
Hahn's lawyer and handed over $265,000. The money came from Roe
Messner, PTL's contractor, who later billed the ministry for work
never completed on PTL's Passion Play amphitheater.
   After the Los Angeles meeting, Dortch said he saw Bakker at
Heritage USA's Main Street shopping arcade and told him about the
payoff. He testified Bakker said, ``I don't want to know and I don't
want to hear about it.''
   During a meeting in Palm Springs, Calif., Dortch said Bakker told
him: ``I hate to give them anything. I hate to give them a dime.''
He said he believed Bakker when he said he hadn't assaulted Ms. Hahn.
   During the testimony, Bakker looked briefly at Dortch, but spent
most of his time staring at papers. Dortch avoided eye contact with
Bakker except for one brief glance.
   Dortch earlier said Bakker pushed the partnerships because ``he
needed the money.''
   ``We had come to the point where the primary income to the
ministry were the lifetime partnerships.''
   The trial included testimony from former partners who said they
sent Bakker $1,000 for lodging but were turned away when they tried
to claim their rooms.
   Dortch also said Bakker knew daily the amount of money raised at
all PTL operations and that only a few insiders knew the real
financial and partnership figures.
   Dortch, who was indicted for fraud and conspiracy along with
Bakker, testified he first heard of the partnerships about three
weeks after joining PTL in December 1983. PTL promoted 11 different
partnership programs between 1984 and 1987, offering supporters four
days and three nights of free lodging each year for life in exchange
for $1,000.
   Dortch also testified that he once asked Bakker about salaries
paid to PTL executives and Bakker told him ``as long as he paid
income taxes he'd take whatever he needed.''
   Dortch said he should have told the PTL board that the ministry
couldn't afford the bonuses given the Bakkers.
   Dortch, released a week ago from a hospital where he was treated
for an undisclosed ailment, said he once objected to using the word
``investment'' in a brochure advertising the partnerships, but
Bakker insisted on it to lure contributors.
   Bakker's secretary every day listed in a notebook contributions
and the number of partnerships sold, Dortch testified. During
telethons to sell partnerships, Bakker was given the latest figures
while on the air.
   Bakker and Dortch, on PTL television shows, told viewers that a
limit of 30,000 partnerships would be sold, but more than 65,000
eventually were sold from 1984 to 1987, prosecutors contend.
   Dortch said the ministry kept two sets of figures for the number
of partnerships sold _ a secret set with the actual numbers and a
second set of lower numbers to be used on the television show.
   Prosecutors contend Bakker took for his own use nearly $4 million
raised through partnership sales at PTL's Heritage USA theme park
and religious retreat near Fort Mill, S.C. If found guilty of the 24
counts of fraud and conspiracy he could be sentenced to 120 years in
prison and fined more than $5 million.

   Colombia announced on Thursday the arrest
of two men wanted in the United States as cocaine traffickers and
said they were in a high-security prison awaiting extradition.
   The government also decreed a new state of emergency in two
cities believed under the influence of drug lords, sending an
undisclosed number of ``military advisers.'' Officials say the area
around Puerto Boyaca and Pacho is a haven for cocaine-processing
laboratories and drug cartel terrorism.
   Gen. Miguel Maza Marquez, head of the Administrative Security
Department and the man in charge of Colombia's anti-drug war,
earlier described one of arrested men, Bernardo Pelaez Roldan, as
among the major drug figures in the Medellin cartel.
   Maza said Pelaez Roldan ``was much bigger'' than Eduardo Martinez
Romero, an economist who was flown to Atlanta Sept. 6. Martinez is
charged there with money laundering for the Medellin cartel, one of
the world's largest cocaine organizations.
   Pelaez Roldan and Guillermo Bueno Delgado were paraded before
news photographers Thursday at the Administrative Security
Department, Colombia's equivalent of the FBI, where officials said
they had been held since their arrests this week.
   A department communique said Pelaez Roldan would be extradited to
Detroit, where he is wanted for ``conspiracy and distribution of
cocaine.''
   The Justice Department in Washington said Pelaez Roldan was
convicted of drug trafficking charges five years ago in Detroit and
faces 15 years in prison.
   He was not, however, on the U.S. Drug Enforcement
Administration's list of the 12 most-wanted Colombian cocaine
traffickers.
   The Associated Press has learned that the Justice Department has
a wanted list of 82 lesser Colombian drug figures that has never
been made public.
   Authorities said Bueno Delgado is wanted in Tallahassee, Fla.,
and San Francisco for ``introducing 5,740 kilos of cocaine (12,628
pounds) and money laundering.''
   The communique said Pelaez Roldan was arrested Wednesday north of
Bogota and Bueno Delgado was captured in Cali on Monday. It gave no
arrest details.
   The department said the two were ``in a high security prison
while legal extradition proceedings are under way,'' and said U.S.
officials were notified of the arrests.
   Only photographers and no other members of the news media were
allowed to view the men. Photographers said Pelaez Roldan's forehead
was gashed and that he threatened them with a walking stick.
   Diva Rojas, the department's press officer, said reporters could
not see the two ``for human rights reasons.''
   ``They don't want to talk, and we have to respect that,'' she
said.
   Pelaez Roldan was indicted in November 1983 on U.S. charges of
conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute cocaine, Justice
Department spokesman David Runkel said in Washington. He was
arrested in Florida and taken before a U.S. magistrate in Detroit in
January 1984.
   The trial was set to begin that March, but Pelaez Roldan was
released on bond and ``never seen again,'' said Runkel.
   Pelaez Roldan was tried in absentia and convicted in April 1984
and a warrant for his arrest was issued a month later, said Frank
Shults of the DEA.
   U.S. Attorney Stephen J. Markman in Detroit said Thursday that
Pelaez Roldan skipped bail of $200,000.
   The case against Pelaez Roldan and more than two dozen
co-defendants involved a conspiracy that distributed 50 to 200 kilos
(110 to 440 pounds) of cocaine per month in the Detroit area from
1975 to 1983, Markman said.
   He was the middleman for the Medellin cartel and his part of the
conspiracy involved more than 300 kilos (660 pounds) of cocaine, the
prosecutor said.
   ``In the process, he earned over $6 million,'' Markman said.
   President Virgilio Barco launched a major crackdown on Colombia's
drug traffickers after Sen. Luis Carlos Galan, the leading
presidential candidate, was assassinated on Aug. 18, allegedly by
drug-backed terrorists.
   Under special emergency powers, Barco announced he would
extradite traffickers wanted in the United States by the
``administrative method.'' This bypasses the courts, traditionally
slow-moving and subject to bribes and intimidation.
   On Thursday, the Minister of Defense, Gen. Oscar Botero Restrepo,
called a news conference to deny recent reports of American troops
in Colombia to help in the drug war.
   ``There are no foreign troops in Colombia, and we don't plan on
having any,'' the minister said.
   He said there were 17 ``North American technicians'' helping
Colombians operate U.S. military equipment, including helicopters
and planes, that the Bush administration donated in a $65 million
aid package.
   Botero was responding to an open letter from former Presidents
Misael Pastana Borrero and Belisario Betancourt published in
Colombian newspapers Thursday. It asked Barco to respond to reports
of U.S. troops in the country.
   The Pentagon has said up to 200 military advisers could come to
Colombia to train and help operate the U.S. equipment.
   In another part of the crackdown, Barco evoked the state of
emergency Thursday in Puerto Boyaca and Pacha, cities in the
Magdalena Medio region. The measure allows him to send military
personnel.
   During the crackdown, thousands of people were rounded up and
millions of dollars worth of properties said to belong to drug
dealers were confisccated.
   The top-echelon drug lords have escaped so far, however. They are
apparently in hiding and authorities do not seem close to finding
them. A bounty of $250,000 is out for Pablo Escobar and Gonzalo
Rodriguez Gacha, said to be the top two bosses of the Medellin
cartel.

   Senate leaders, split over money for the war on
drugs, agreed Thursday to fresh negotiations and drug coordinator
William J. Bennett came under intensified fire from Democrats upset
with details of the plan.
   ``The president's plan is wholly inadequate,'' Senate Majority
Leader George Mitchell, D-Maine, said. He agreed to talks Friday by
a task force of nine members from each party in an effort to reach a
compromise.
   Senate Minority Leader Bob Dole, R-Kan., threatened to freeze
floor action on a dozen money bills unless fresh talks produced
funds for the drug war.
   In the House, a Democratic caucus broke up with a number of
members cool toward a proposal to get an additional $2.2 billion for
the $7.9 billion drug war by making a half-percent, across-the-board
cut in federal programs. But party leaders said they were ruling out
nothing except a tax increase.
   Elsewhere, the head of the Federal Bureau of Prisons backed the
concept of sending youthful drug offenders to boot camp-style
``shock incarceration'' but said more study was needed before
carrying out the idea on the federal level.
   Dole met for much of Thursday afternoon with Bennett and the
White House budget director, Richard Darman. Dole told reporters
afterward that Republicans ``don't believe we should proceed with
appropriations until this is done.''
   Only one of the 13 annual money bills has gone to President
Bush's desk for his signature with the start of fiscal 1990 two
weeks away. Republicans are in the minority in the Senate but could
still conceivably use Senate rules to block action on the
appropriations measures.
   Dole said Republicans also would like to expand the negotiations
to include such matters as Bush administration anti-crime
legislation, which he said has been ``resting in peace in the
Judiciary Committee for months.''
   He named nine Republican senators to take part in negotiations
and said administration officials also would be available. Mitchell
was attending a funeral and not immediately available for comment.
   Following a House Democratic caucus, Rep. Charles Rangel, D-N.Y.,
told reporters the concept of an across-the-board cut was being
opposed because domestic programs ``have already been cut to the
bone.''
   He said Democrats would seek to find savings in other programs,
such as defense.
   ``My constituents believe the drug war is more important than,
say, the mission to Mars or a couple of extra stealth bombers,''
added Rep. Ron Wyden, D-Ore.
   Bennett's fireworks with lawmakers at a House Government
Operations Committee session were the first such eruption since he
began lobbying lawmakers last week.
   The explosion came as Rep. Barbara Boxer, D-Calif., was preparing
to ask about the administration's plan to finance the drug war by
cutting existing programs, such as juvenile justice grants.
   ``If we're critical,'' she said, ``it's because there are some
problem areas here that have to be discussed, and I think if its
healthy dialogue and debate today, maybe we can resolve some of the
problems.''
   ``It hasn't been healthy so far,'' Bennett said. ``It has been
petty and micromanagement. I don't appreciate it.''
   ``In this committee, Sir, or do you mean generally?'' interrupted
Chairman John Conyers, D-Mich. Bennett sai he was referring to
repeated questioning of his chief of staff, John Walters, by Rep.
Glenn English, D-Okla., about the possible use of P-3 radar planes
in the skies over Colombia to scout for airborne cocaine cargoes.
   ``I'm sorry you feel that way about it, Mr. Bennett,'' English
said, adding that he had been within his rights to question Walters.
   ``It's the public's right,'' English said. ``It's public
information.''
   Under repeated questioning from English, Walters said he could
not now say whether he would recommend using the P-3s. He offered to
brief English in private.
   English told reporters the Customs Service has two of the
radar-equipped planes. He said that a source he declined to name had
told him the Colombian government wants the planes used in the fight
against the cartels.
   He acknowledged that he had discussed the matter with a
representative of a company involved in the P-3 program but declined
to name the company. He said he understood sending the planes was
being held up by a ``turf fight'' in the federal bureaucracy.
   Minutes after the exchange over the P-3s, Bennett became
embroiled in a sharply worded dispute with Mrs. Boxer after she said
California would face drastic cuts in its federal aid under the
administration finaning plan.
   ``I think this is the phoniest war that I've ever seen
launched,'' she said.
   Meanwhile, Bureau of Prisons Director J. Michael Quinlan told a
House Judiciary subcommittee that more study is needed before
implementing boot camp-type punishment for youthful drug offenders
at the federal level.
   ``The success of these programs is yet undetermined,'' Quinlan
said. He did say that the administration backs the general concept
but added that under a boot camp bill sponsored by Rep. Charles
Schumer, D-N.Y., only 60 of the 50,000 inmates in federal prisons
would be eligible.
   The bill calls for any able-bodied, first-time offender with a
prison term of 12 to 16 months to be eligibile for the program. Each
day in camp would count as four days in regular prison.

   The man who shot seven people to death and
wounded 13 before killing himself at a printing plant Thursday was a
quiet, hard worker whose forced leave for mental problems led to
dreams of revenge, former co-workers said.
   ``He said before he left, he would get even. I remember that,''
former co-worker George Oswine said after 47-year-old Joseph
Wesbecker's rampage at the Standard Gravure Corp. plant.
   Although friends and former co-workers who described him as quiet
and hard-working, police said Wesbecker had been argumentative and
confrontational for years and was being treated for mental disorders.
   Some people at Standard Gravure said he'd become obsessed with
guns over the past year. He was carrying several semiautomatic
weapons and thousands of rounds of ammunition when the killing began
Thursday.
   Wesbecker's friend, John Tingle, worked with him for 17 years at
Standard Gravure before Wesbecker was put on permanent disability
two years ago.
   ``He was always level-headed, fun-loving, thrifty. I've never
known him to carry a gun or use a gun,'' said Tingle. ``We always
usually had a good laugh at work.''
   Tingle said Wesbecker became upset when management at Standard
Gravure, which prints magazines and newspaper inserts, refused to
accept a doctor's recommendation that Wesbecker stop operating
machines that had caused him stress.
   ``They forced him back to work, but the doctor said he couldn't
work the folder anymore, that was too much stress and tension,''
Tingle said. After a week's hiatus, Wesbecker returned to work, but
management again told him he must continue in his former job.
   ``That's when his mental problems began,'' Tingle said. ``It's
terrible ... that they could push a man that far.''
   The episode left Wesbecker with ``a big grudge,'' Oswine said.
   Standard Gravure President Michael Shea said he did not know the
reason Wesbecker left the company, and said personnel information on
the man was unavailable.
   After he went on disability, Wesbecker began collecting guns,
Oswine said.
   Another former co-worker, Joe White, said conversations with
Wesbecker centered on guns and Soldier of Fortune magazine. White
said Wesbecker thought of himself as a soldier and seemed obsessed
with guns.
   ``This guy's been talking about this for a year,'' White said.
   ``I guess nobody believed him,'' said Don Frazier, president of
the graphics union at the printing plant.
   Frazier said Wesbecker had become more upset recently because he
thought his disability benefits were about to be cut off.
   Police Sgt. Carl Yates said police knew little about Wesbecker or
where he obtained his guns: a 9mm handgun, an AK-47 assault rifle,
two MAC-11 semiautomatic machine pistols, a .38-caliber revolver and
a bayonet, as well as the ammunition.
   ``I wouldn't think it would be real difficult to obtain'' an
AK-47, Yates said. Wesbecker did not have a police record or any
record of military service, Yates said.
   Lt. Jeff Moody said Wesbecker had been treated for ``apparent
mental disorders'' but did not have any specifics.
   Yates said Wesbecker and his second wife, Brenda, had two boys in
their 20s, but he did not know their names. Mrs. Wesbecker works at
a Louisville beauty school.
   Employees of Roy's Academy of Beauty Inc. declined to comment on
the shootings or Mrs. Wesbecker. The phone at the Wesbecker's
residence has been disconnected, and the family did not return home
Thursday night.
   Neighbors said Wesbecker purchased the small split-level house in
south Louisville about three years ago for $56,000. They said
Wesbecker kept to himself.
   A neighbor, Paul Danahy, said he did not know Wesbecker's name
until he heard about the shootings, and said he had only seen him
``once or twice while he was mowing the yard.'' He described him as
``cocky and standoffish ... a hard guy to approach.''

   Former President Ronald Reagan will leave
St. Marys Hospital on Friday, one week after skull surgery, his
spokesman said.
   Reagan, 78, who met Thursday with Soviet parliament member Boris
Yeltsin and Labor Secretary Elizabeth Dole, was to fly directly to
Los Angeles on Friday and return to his home, said spokesman Mark
Weinberg.
   Weinberg refused to release details of the departure.
   The surgery Friday by Mayo Clinic doctors involved draining fluid
that built up on Reagan's brain after he was thrown from a horse
July 4. The medical team is ``completely satisfied'' with his
recuperation, Weinberg said.
   Mrs. Dole, who was transportation secretary under Reagan, met
briefly with the former president on Thursday morning, he said.
   Reagan met with Yeltsin for about 20 minutes in his hospital
room, Weinberg said.
   Yeltsin gave Reagan a bouquet of red roses and, according to
Weinberg, told him: ``You gave the start to the very perceptible
warming of relations between the two countries. Your contribution to
this was enormous. You were very wise, courageous and tactful in the
way you went about it. I am very grateful to you for this.''
   Afterward, Yeltsin said through an interpreter that he and Reagan
``discussed life in the United States, we also discussed the
situation with perestroika (Soviet economic reform) and the Soviet
Union.''
   ``We discussed the American Revolution, the Soviet revolution, we
discussed the American people and the Soviet people. We mentioned
the fact that, although there are differences between them, we have
the same kind of sense of humor,'' he said.
   Yeltsin, on a speaking tour of the United States, had asked to
meet with Reagan, who ``has been following the visit with interest
because U.S.-Soviet relations are of special interest and importance
to him and it's an opportunity to get Mr. Yeltsin's observations on
what he has seen in the United States,'' Weinberg said.
   Yeltsin, an outspoken critic of some of Soviet leader Mikhail
Gorbachev's policies, was ousted as Moscow's Communist Party chief
in 1987, but then elected to parliament with overwhelming popular
support in a contested election. He has been prodding Gorbachev to
step up the pace of reform.

   Egyptian tugboat crews and rescue teams on
Thursday refloated a cargo ship that ran aground and ended the
danger of polluting the Red Sea or fragile coral reefs with oil or
phosphate spills, authorities said.
   A small area of reefs was reported damaged.
   Red Sea coral lines the shores of the Sinai Peninsula along the
gulfs of Aqaba and Suez, creating spectacular reefs that harbor
rainbow-colored fish and attract tourists and divers.
   The Panamanian-registered Sapphire Glory was transporting 14,700
tons of phosphates from Aqaba, Jordan, to India when it rammed a
reef early Wednesday. The crash tore a hole in an empty tank and
partially submerged the 19,279-ton freighter.
   No injuries were reported among the ship's 24 crew, most from
South Korea.
   The Friday edition of el-Akhbar newspaper said a minor phosphate
spill caused slight damage to the corals and that the vessel damaged
around 240 square yards of coral reef when it ran aground. It was
not immediately clear if rescue work did further damage.
   An officer at the Committee for Oil Pollution, an environmental
agency responsible for preserving Egypt's waters, had said the reef
was damaged in the accident but no phosphates or fuel leaked because
the punctured tank was empty.
   He spoke anonymously under agency regulations.
   Crewmen were taken ashore at Sharm el-Sheikh at the southern tip
of Sinai, near where the accident occurred. The South Korean captain
said his ship grounded after its radar failed, newspapers said.
   The Sapphire Glory will be towed by tug to Suez, the nearest
repair facility, 200 miles northwest of Sharm el-Sheikh.

<HEAD>New Spill Legislation Approved by Committee</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A House committee on Thursday approved
legislation aimed at improving the prevention of oil and chemical
spills and their handling when they do occur in coastal and inland
waters.
   The measure endorsed by the Merchant Marine and Fisheries
Committee requires the maintenance of seven cleanup response teams
around the country, and makes it easier for the federal government
to take over cleanups.
   It would also mandate the establishment of a computerized
inventory of cleanup resources around the world.
   The legislation was written as a response to the Exxon Valdez
disaster in Alaska's Prince William Sound six months ago and was
approved one day before Exxon is supposed to wind up its cleanup
efforts in Alaska.
   Environmentalists complained that the bill did not go far enough.
The Sierra Club said it hoped backers could add a provision on the
House floor giving states the right to impose tougher standards than
the federal government.
   The Exxon Valdez disaster in which 11 million gallons of crude
oil were spilled prompted many members to introduce bills of various
kinds, and the measure sent to the House floor on Thursday was a
distillation of many of them.
   The Senate has approved its own version of oil spill legislation,
and if the House passes a bill the two versions will have to be
reconciled.
   The Merchant Marine committee earlier this year approved a bill
that would, among other things, give the federal government power to
determine damages to be paid by those responsible for spills.
   Thursday's bill has provisions aimed at:
   _Increasing the ability of the Coast Guard to uncover alcohol and
drug abuse by permitting the use of information in the National
Driver Register in licensing mariners. The captain of the Exxon
Valdez had been drinking and was not on the bridge when his ship ran
aground.
   _States could require the use of their own pilots in state waters
if the federally licensed pilot aboard were not specifically
qualified for those waters.
   _Evaluating the staffing, training, qualification and
watch-keeping standards of foreign tankers.
   _Requiring vessels to maintain cleanup plans that are consistent
with the current national cleanup plan.
   _Increasing penalties for spills.
   The Coast Guard receives reports on about 7,500 oil spills every
year, most of them small but about 200 requiring a federal takeover
of the cleanup effort.

<TEXT>
   President Quett Masire of Botswana said
Thursday that industrial nations can help relieve drought and hunger
in Africa by reducing global warming caused by the greenhouse effect.
   Masire and Dr. Bernard Ledea Ouedraogo, an anti-hunger organizer
in Burkina Faso, were honored as co-winners of the 1988 Africa Prize
for Leadership for their efforts in averting hunger.
   A severe drought gripped much of Africa from 1981 to 1987,
killing millions. Experts believe that due to the organizing efforts
of Masire's government, not one person died of drought-induced
famine in Botswana.
   Through early planning, Botswana organized a nutritional
surveillance and warning system and distributed food nationwide.
   By the time the drought ended, malnutrition had actually
declined. Before the drought, 25 percent of Botswana's children were
underweight. By 1987, that fell to 15 percent.
   In his acceptance speech, Masire thanked Western donor
governments and private agencies for their help during the drought,
but suggested drought and hunger will get worse in Africa if the
Earth's climate keeps warming.
   ``The semi-arid tropics will have even greater climatic
variability as the warming continues,'' he said.
   ``The industrialized countries may do more for Africa in the long
run by helping to reduce global warming than by supplying short-term
aid, however welcome that is at the time.
   ``We would prefer to prevent droughts altogether rather than have
to learn to deal with them well.''
   The warming of the Earth and its lower atmosphere is caused by
trapped solar radiation.
   The other Africa Prize-winner, Ouedraogo, has organized about
500,000 peasants in nine countries in Africa to develop their
villages based on traditional cooperative village leadership.
   The villagers in Burkina Faso, Chad, Gambia, Guinea-Bissau, Mali,
Mauritania, Niger, Senegal and Togo raise vegetables, learn new
farming techniques, improve literacy, fight erosion, replant
forests, build roads and improve health care.
   The Africa Prize consists of $100,000 and a statue, awarded by
the New York-based Hunger Project.
   Ouedraogo said he will ask the peasant farmers he has organized
how they would like to use his share of the prize.
   Masire also said he would distribute his share of the award to
grass-roots organizers and villagers who made Botswana's victory
over famine possible.

<HEAD>Ambassador Says US Inaction In Lebanon Gives Syria A Green Light</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BARRY SCHWEID</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Diplomatic Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Lebanon's ambassador said Thursday night U.S.
diplomatic inaction is giving Syria a green light to occupy his
country completely.
   He said U.S. assertions of support for Lebanon's independence and
calls for the departure of foreign troops are no substitute for a
vigorous policy.
   ``Syria is enforcing its hegemony over Lebanon,'' Ambassador
Abdallah Bouhabib said in a speech. ``It's very clear.''
   Lebanon is torn by 14 years of civil war between Christian forces
and Moslems backed by neighboring Syria. Earlier this month, calling
the situation in Beirut too dangerous, U.S. ambassador John McCarthy
and his entire American staff departed.
   Abandonment of the U.S. embassy was described by the State
Department as temporary. But the American diplomats already are
being reassigned to other posts.
   Syria, whose troops have been in Lebanon since 1975, controls the
Bekka Valley and parts of Beirut. Iranian-controlled allies,
believed to be holding American hostages, are strong in other areas
while Israeli forces occupy a security buffer in the south.
   ``The lack of a concerted effort to solve the situation has made
everyone concerned believe that the United States has no policy at
all,'' Bouhabib said.
   He contrasted U.S. inaction in Lebanon with U.S. emphasis on
human rights in other countries and assertions by President Bush he
will try to end the country's suffering.
   ``In Lebanon it seems we have even less, no rights,'' Bouhabib
said.
   More than 150,000 Lebanese have died in the war and 250,000 have
been wounded.
   ``In the case of Lebanon what is U.S. policy?,'' the ambassador
asked. ``U.S. policy means at the present time a green light that
the Syrians can do whatever they want in Lebanon.''
   He stressed he was not asking for U.S. military intervention or
assistance. ``We are simply calling for concentrated diplomatic
action by the administraion and Congress to bring pressure on the
parties to end the destruction and tragedy _ the end the
strangulation of the Lebanese people,'' the ambassador said.
   Bouhabib said U.S. inaction could establish a dangerous precedent
for small and defenseless nations elsewhere.

   A man with an assault rifle mowed down
co-workers as he went from floor to floor ``looking for bosses'' at
a printing plant Thursday, killing seven people and wounding 13
before taking his own life.
   Police said Joseph T. Wesbecker, 47, had been on permanent
disability, was being treated for mental disorders and reportedly
had threatened the company. He carried several semiautomatic weapons
and thousands of rounds of ammunition.
   ``I told them I'd be back. Get out of my way, John. I told them
I'd be back,'' the gunman told fellow Standard Gravure Corp.
employee John Tingle, who approached him before the 30-minute
shooting rampage began.
   ``I said, `How are you, Rock?''' Tingle recalled. ``He said,
`Fine, John. Back off and get out of the way ... all the way to the
wall.'''
   Tingle and other employees nearby then ran into a bathroom and
locked the door.
   Police searched every floor of the three-story Standard Gravure
building for victims. Two were found as officers led Mayor Jerry
Abramson through the building, adjacent to The Courier-Journal
newspaper.
   ``We also found a fellow sitting in a corner that was just
shuddering in fear,'' Abramson said. ``He hadn't been shot, but he
was in shock.''
   Five of the wounded initially were listed in critical condition
with multiple gunshot wounds, authorities said, but two were
upgraded to serious condition late Thursday. One person who was not
wounded suffered a heart attack and was taken to nearby Jewish
Hospital.
   ``It looks like a battle zone ... with the blood and the people
involved there,'' Abramson said. ``There were bodies lying across
staircases. It was just frightening.''
   More than 100 doctors were called in to help treat the wounded,
said Dr. Frank Miller, co-director at Humana Hospital-University of
Louisville.
   Bone specialist Dr. David Seligson said he had not seen such
injuries since the Vietnam War in 1970 ``and today brings that all
back.''
   At 8:30 a.m., Wesbecker entered the building with a duffel bag,
an AK-47 semiautomatic rifle, two MAC-11 semiautomatic machine
pistols, a .38-caliber handgun, a 9mm automatic and a bayonet,
Police Chief Richard Dotson said.
   ``He was loaded for bear,'' Dotson said. It was unclear how many
shots he fired from the AK-47, the same type of gun used by a man
who killed five school children in Stockton, Calif., in January.
   ``At least four of the guns were purchased in Kentucky,'' said
Bill Curley, head of the Louisville office of the U.S. Bureau of
Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms. Curley could not identify the sellers.
   Wesbecker took an elevator to third-floor offices, pulled the
rifle out of his bag and opened fire, police and witnesses said.
   ``He was up there looking for bosses,'' Tingle said. ``He
couldn't find none of the bosses and couldn't find none of the
supervisors. He was just in too deep to turn back. So he just shot
anything that was close to him.''
   Wesbecker worked his way downstairs, shooting people along the
way.
   ``He didn't fire randomly. He was definitely doing some damage,''
Maj. Ed Mercer said.
   Wesbecker eventually ended up in a pressroom in an annex, where
he killed himself with a shot under his chin, Dotson said.
   ``I thought it was firecrackers going off,'' said Bud Graser, a
pressman. ``When I saw what it was, I turned around and told
everybody to get out of there.''
   Ed Green, a supervisor in the plant's etching room, said he heard
at least 20 shots. ``I seen two (victims) and then I got out,''
Green said.
   A police officer who knew Wesbecker told Dotson the man had been
``argumentative and confrontational for a number of years.''
   ``This guy's been talking about this for a year,'' said Joe
White, a Standard Gravure employee. ``He's been talking about guns
and Soldier of Fortune magazine. He's paranoid and he thought
everyone was after him.''
   Wesbecker had been on permanent disability, Dotson said.
   He reportedly had made threats against the company, which prints
newspaper inserts and Sunday newspaper supplements, but Standard
Gravure President Michael Shea said he did not know of any threats
or the nature of Wesbecker's disability.
   ``I'm at a loss to speculate on anything,'' Shea said. ``What's
going through my mind right now is sympathy and caring for the
people who are involved.''
   The gunman was found face-down in a pool of blood on the floor of
a pressroom. The pistol was discovered under his body and the rifle
was a few feet away.
   Dotson said his officers had come ``close, but not that close''
to apprehending Wesbecker.
   A woman who answered the telephone at a house where Wesbecker's
mother was staying said the family did not want to comment.
   ``We're just in shock like everybody else. We had to find out
over the television. No one called us,'' said the woman, who did not
identify herself. ``I guess he was just a sick person. That's all.''
   The newspaper building was evacuated after the shootings. At
least two downtown blocks were sealed off and a dozen ambulances
lined the streets.
   It was the worst one-day mass killing in the United States since
Aug. 20, 1986, when a postal worker shot 14 people to death before
killing himself at a post office in Edmond, Okla.
   On Jan. 17, a 24-year-old drifter opened fire on a Stockton,
Calif., schoolyard with an AK-47 rifle and other weapons, killing
five children and wounding 29 others and one teacher before killing
himself. That prompted a federal ban on imports of AK-47 and other
foreign-made assault weapons.
   White House spokeswoman Alixe Glen, asked how Thursday's shooting
reflected on President Bush's policy of banning imports but not
domestic semiautomatics, said: ``There's got to be an end to these
tragic incidents and we've got to work towards assuring these
weapons aren't falling into the wrong hands.''

   A fiery methane gas explosion, smoke and
dust figured in the deaths of 10 miners in the nation's worst coal
mine disaster in five years, officials said as a federal
investigation got under way.
   ``It was just a big boom. The ears popped and that was it. The
dirt flew,'' said Tony Hawkins, who was installing support timbers
in the mine about a half mile from the explosion Wednesday morning.
``It was just scary. My knees started shaking.''
   Hawkins said he and others helped to evacuate some miners who
scrambled out of the smoky blast site about 1,000 feet underground
in the Pyro Mining Co.'s William Station Mine.
   By late Wednesday, rescue teams had removed 10 bodies, which were
taken to the state medical examiner's office for autopsies, and all
other miners were safely accounted for, authorities said.

   Senate Democrats are ready to work with
Republicans toward a compromise anti-drug program but say they'll
hold out for something close to their $10 billion plan that
President Bush threatened to veto.
   ``The president's plan is wholly inadequate,'' said Senate
Majority Leader George Mitchell, D-Maine, adding that the White
House is failing in its effort to paint the Democrats as big taxers
and spenders for wanting to do more.
   The Democrats, who hold a 55-45 majority in the Senate, united
Wednesday behind a proposal by Sen. Robert Byrd, D-W.Va., to expand
Bush's $7.9 billion drug program by $2.2 billion, with more money
for drug education and treatment programs.
   Mitchell contended the White House's quick threat of a veto for
the Democratic plan, and its claim that Democrats just want to raise
taxes, show that the administration knows its plan is in trouble.

<TEXT>
   Asked how much money the
Soviet Union has set aside for its space shuttle and other payloads
for its new superbooster, the rocket's designer dug into his pocket
and pulled out a handful of coins.
   Boris I. Gubanov, a gray-haired man of 59, was joking _ in fact
the government is spending $2.1 billion a year on the Energia
booster rocket and the shuttle Buran it carries into orbit. But
beyond the mirth Gubanov and other Soviet space officials are under
pressure to economize and are facing serious criticism not unlike
that faced by the U.S. National Aeronautics and Space Administration
and its shuttle program.
   ``We have stubbornly continued spending money on this hopeless
affair,'' Konstantin P. Feoktistov, an engineer and former
cosmonaut, said of the Soviet shuttle at a recent roundtable
discussion in Moscow.
   When the gleaming white and black Buran, Russian for
``snowstorm,'' soared into orbit for the first time last fall,
President Mikhail S. Gorbachev hailed it as ``one more confirmation
of the kind of huge possibilities the Soviet Union has to solve any
problem.''
   Perhaps just as important, Buran's pilotless, remote-controlled
flight and return to Earth proved that the Soviets were still very
much in the space race with the Americans.
   But Feoktistov, in remarks reported by the weekly Moscow News,
said none of the technology developed for the shuttle has yet been
applied to improve the lives of the Soviet people and that launches
of cargoes by the Buran will be 20 to 40 times more expensive than
by expendable rockets.
   Roald Z. Sagdeyev, a space scientist and member of the Supreme
Soviet (Parliament), said the Soviet Union developed a shuttle
solely as a ``symmetrical reply'' to the U.S. version, even though
officials knew it was not really needed.
   He told the roundtable the program that resulted in a lookalike
Soviet version of the U.S. shuttle was ``the last refuge of
windowdressers.''
   The attacks, fueled by chronic problems in the Soviet economy,
were targeted at a space program that had long been a sacred cow.
The cosmos had been a source of national euphoria and pride ever
since the Soviet Union ushered in the space age in 1957 with the
launch of Sputnik, the first manmade object put into orbit.
   The mounting criticism has already forced cuts and delays in the
Soviet shuttle program, which began in 1976 and culminated in the
first and only flight of the Buran in November. Space officials
spoke initially of launching the shuttle again in 1990, building a
fleet of five or six and launching 10 by 1997.
   Now they say the next flight won't take place until 1991, that
only three shuttles will be built and that only five missions will
be conducted through 1995.
   The whale-sized Energia, the world's most powerful rocket booster
that flew a test mission in 1987 and propelled Buran into orbit, has
also suffered cutbacks.
   Gubanov, its chief designer, told reporters who recently visited
the Baikonur Cosmodrome 1,560 miles southeast of Moscow that five or
six of the rockets could be produced annually but that he only has
enough money for one a year.
   Gubanov and other project officials are countering the criticism
with a public relations campaign to put the best face on the
cutbacks and point out the program's benefits.
   The Energia designer told a Moscow news conference in August the
project had come up with 600 innovations that can be applied in the
economy and that within the next 10 years, the value of such
spinoffs could reach 20 billion rubles ($32 billion).
   Other officials defended the long waits for the next shuttle
flights, a 1991 unmanned mission to dock with the orbiting space
station Mir and the first piloted flight in 1992.
   ``We don't plan to launch several times a year like the
Americans,'' Yuri P. Semenov, the chief Soviet spacecraft designer,
told a recent news conference in Leninsk, the city near Baikonur
where space center workers live. ``They do this for business, out of
necessity. We don't have such a need.''
   The veteran cosmonaut Alexei A. Leonov, who flew aboard a Soyuz
capsule that linked up with the U.S. Apollo spacecraft in 1975, has
said people shouldn't be surprised that Soviet officials are moving
ahead cautiously with the shuttle.
   ``We must have comfortable deadlines which don't force us to
rush,'' said Leonov, who now works in the Star City cosmonaut
training center near Moscow.
   At Baikonur, there are few signs that work on Energia and the
shuttles has slowed. New launch pads, assembly buildings and a
runway have become part of the landscape, and Gubanov said 10,000
workers are involved in the project at the sprawling spaceport alone.
   In the hangar where Energia is assembled, one rocket booster is
being prepared for a test flight next year, without the shuttle but
with a payload still to be determined.
   The Buran, meanwhile, sits in a huge hangar where it is being
analyzed following its flight. The doors to the shuttle's payload
bay are open and specialists are removing some of the 40,000
delicate and expensive heat-shielding tiles to inspect the skin
underneath. A second shuttle is being assembled in another section
of the hangar.
   Soviet officials have said the shuttle's tasks will include
transporting repairmen to space to repair satellites and for
rescuing crews stranded aboard space stations.
   But the Supreme Soviet could put the shuttle under renewed
scrutiny and Gubanov said he is worried even further cuts might come.

<TEXT>
   In the shadow of the launch pad from
which man first entered the cosmos, meat and butter are rationed and
concrete crumbles from prefabricated buildings.
   ``This is not Cape Canaveral,'' said Vladimir A. Shatalov, head
of Soviet cosmonaut training who has visited the U.S. spaceport in
Florida.
   While Leninsk may not by up to Cape Canaveral's standards and
food now is rationed, the people who live here and work at the
nearby Baikonur Cosmodrome are generally better off than most other
Soviets.
   Leninsk was built in 1955 on the Kazakhstan desert in Soviet Asia
1,560 miles southeast of Moscow as the bedroom for the cosmodrome
from which the Soviet Union launches satellites, interplantetary
space probes, manned space ships and its new space shuttle.
   The land is flat and dry with little vegetation. Strong desert
winds blow sand off the hard earth, spewing dust on everything.
Residents say temperatures can reach 115 degrees in the shade.
   But the region is ideal for a spaceport. The sky is generally
cloudless and there's nothing for hundreds of miles around, making
it ideal for safety and security.
   Leninsk's population of 75,000 is growing steadily as more
specialists arrive to work on the fledgling Buran space shuttle,
which was tested in an unmanned flight last November. Most live in
nine-story prefabricated apartment buildings like those found
throughout the country.
   The theme in Leninsk is space.
   The sole movie theater is the ``Saturn.'' Children climb through
miniature rockets in playgrounds and space-related banners and
monuments are scattered throughout the city. One colorful tile
mosaic on the main road leading into the city features the orbiting
space station Mir and boasts, ``The U.S.S.R. is the Homeland of
Cosmonautics.''
   But Larisa I. Konovalenko, a local TV commentator, had a question
for Lt. Gen. Igor I. Kurinny, the head of the Leninsk political
department, at a news conference.
   ``Why is there such a big gulf between the high technology used
for space and the social conditions of the city of Leninsk?''
   Kurunny replied: ``It cannot be denied that such differences
truly exist between the social aspects of the city and the
technology with which we're conquering space.''
   But he added that the Communist Party and government approved a
plan early last year to build new housing, schools, a hospital,
maternity home, and cultural and recreational facilities.
   A modern pedestrian mall downtown was built this year and 11 new
apartment buildings have been put up. But, Kurinny said, things are
going slowly because of a shortage of construction workers.
   A group of teen-agers, sitting on a park bench near a monument to
Baikonur workers killed in a 1960 accident, said rationing of meat,
sugar, butter and laundry detergent began in the city two months
ago, later than most of the country. Even so, they added, it came as
a blow to Leninsk's people because they were so accustomed to buying
food and consumer goods without difficulty.
   One of the teen-agers, identifying himself as Vitaly, said
residents now joke that Leninsk's trademark had become ``lines in
stores, open pipes and puddles.'' Indeed, steam pipes line the
sidewalks and puddles seem to appear from nowhere despite the arid
climate.
   Vitaly and his friends Artur and Natasha even talked about their
fathers' work, once a taboo subject.
   Salaries in Leninsk run 300 to 600 rubles ($480 to $960) a month,
compared to about 230 rubles ($370) for the average worker
nationwide.
   Vitaly, Artur and Natasha said they attend technical schools and
hope to stay in Leninsk even though they are often bored.
   Then they headed off to a disco in a local park.

   The bloody crackdown on dissent in China has made
many residents of this casino-rich Portuguese enclave increasingly
reluctant to bet on a future here with the Communist Chinese
takeover a decade away.
   Community leaders say the suppression of the May-June democracy
movement in Beijing has increased fears of what might be in store
for Macao, a reaction also experienced in the nearby British colony
of Hong Kong, which reverts to China in 1997.
   ``We are exactly in the same situation as is Hong Kong,'' said
Legislative Assembly member Alexandre Ho. ``The confidence crisis
has worsened,''
   Portugal agreed in 1987 to return this six square-mile enclave of
about half a million people, almost 97 percent of whom are ethnic
Chinese, to China in 1999. Beijing promised Macao _ as it did with
Hong Kong _ that it could maintain its capitalist system for 50
years and enjoy a high degree of autonomy.
   Macao residents joined their Hong Kong brethren in
enthusiastically supporting the student-led democracy movement in
China.
   On June 4, when reports on the Chinese military suppression of
the movement in Beijing began to reach Macao, an estimated
one-fourth of the territory's population streamed into the narrow
streets to denounce China's leaders.
   In both colonies, the crackdown led to plunging property markets
and increased interest in emigration.
   ``We know many of our friends are preparing to leave,'' said
legislator Ho. Press reports in Lisbon say wealthy Macao residents
are depositing more personal wealth in Portugal.
   But the trauma in Macao appears not as great as it is in Hong
Kong, in part because many people in Macao can find new homes before
1999 with their Portuguese passports.
   Although the more than 3 million Hong Kong residents are eligible
for British passports, they have no right to settle in Britain. They
have bitterly denounced Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher's
government in London for refusing to change that policy after the
Chinese crackdown.
   But the 100,000 or so Macao residents with Portuguese passports
not only have full rights to live in Portugal but expect to be able
to settle almost anywhere in Western Europe, including Britain,
after the European Economic Community removes trade and other
barriers by the end of 1992.
   Ho believes that perhaps a quarter of Portuguese passport holders
in Macao will leave. Many of those who stay will do so because they
have ``no language skills, no work skills and no capital to start a
new life,'' he said.
   The assemblyman says he has yet to decide whether he will use his
Portuguese passport to emigrate but acknowledges the crackdown in
China ``makes me less comfortable.''
   Another man yet to make a final decision is Stanley Ho, who has
made a fortune leading the monopoly that runs Macao's six gambling
casinos.
   He said he plans to watch carefully what happens to Hong Kong
after China takes over in 1997.
   ``If it doesn't work ... you may see me in San Francisco or
Canada or Europe,'' he said. ``If it's going to be difficult,
inconvenient, I'll have to say, `Cheerio'.''
   Such a breezy response is not possible for the 400,000 Macao
residents without Portuguese passports, many of whom are recent
immigrants from China and do not have the money, education or family
connections to obtain residency rights in other countries.
   Their chances to emigrate appear dim and the Portuguese
government is not considering helping them leave.
   Settled in 1557 as the first European foothold in Asia, Macao
once was a major colonial trading center but long ago was surpassed
by Hong Kong, just 40 miles to the northeast.
   Politically, Beijing's influence in Macao has grown in recent
decades; in 1967 the territory agreed to deport to China
anti-communist troublemakers. Most local business and civic leaders
support the Chinese government while the media, except for a few
weeks during the democracy movement, generally toe the official
Beijing line.
   Economically, the casinos and light industry remain the mainstay.
   ``I've served more than 10 governors,'' said Stanley Ho, who has
the gambling monopoly through 2001. ``Each and every one of them
tried to rely less on gambling. I think none of them have succeeded.
The gambling revenue in Macao is very important.''
   He added that he has received personal assurances from China that
gambling will be allowed after 1999.
   In an effort to help the territory's fortunes, Ho has joined
forces with the Macao government and China to build an offshore
international airport. The $450-million first phase is scheduled for
completion in 1993. Other major construction projects include a
deep-water harbor.
   While some people say the airport will not attract enough
business to be viable, others say it is essential to attract foreign
investment and bring more tourists to the territory.
   But Bishop Domingos Lam, who heads the 27,000-member Roman
Catholic Church in Macao, sees no end to what he describes as the
historical tendency of local residents to move elsewhere in search
of a brigher future. The recent events in China, he said, have only
quickened the process.
   ``Those who have qualifications go out; those who don't have
qualifications stay,'' he said.
   ``The old generation of Macao has already moved out. Take my
family, for instance. I'm left alone to look after the graves.
   ``I'm the only Lam left in Macao.''

<TEXT>
   Only the muddy mouth of the slow-moving Pearl River
separates Macao from Hong Kong, but the Portuguese and British
enclaves in southern China seem worlds apart.
   What little the two territories have in common largely is
historical.
   Both were settled by great European trading nations _ Macao by
Portugal in the mid-16th century and Hong Kong by Britain three
centuries later _ but their populations have remained overwhelmingly
Chinese.
   With the colonial era long over, both enclaves are to be returned
to China by the end of the century under a ``one country, two
systems'' policy that will allow them to remain capitalist for an
additional 50 years.
   But while Hong Kong has become one of the most dynamic cities of
the late 20th century _ a center of trade, light industry and
finance _ Macao some 40 miles to the southwest is known for little
more than its six gambling casinos, where supremely bored croupiers
preside over a wide variety of Chinese and Western games of chance.
   Here are some other contrasts:
   _HARBORS: Hong Kong's is filled with huge ocean-going cargo
vessels and a sprinkling of luxury liners. Macao's is filled with
silt. The British colony claims it is the leading container port in
the world in terms of cargo handled. Macao claims it will soon
complete a deep-water port, but for the time being its waters are
home only to a group of small junks.
   _ARCHITECTURE: Hong Kong's downtown is filled with modernistic
skyscrapers. The newest addition is the prism-like, I.M.
Pei-designed Bank of China building, a towering 1,221-foot
structure. Most colonial era buildings have fallen to the wrecking
ball. Macao's waterfront includes a smattering of new office
complexes and hotels, but the territory retains an Old World flavor.
Decaying colonial-era buildings with colonnades and tattered
shutters can be found on many streets, the pink, green and yellow
pastels slowly fading.
   _A DAY AT THE RACES: In Hong Kong, horse racing is an obsession.
Up to 70,000 people crowd one of the two tracks every race day while
countless others invade 129 off-track betting centers. A typical
daily turnover last season was about $50 million. In Macao, racing
is done by dogs _ greyhounds. Several hundred people meander into
the aging canidrome on race day, but the opportunity to bet on
``Dragon of Space,'' ``Krypto Flash'' or other dogs fails to arouse
the listless gathering. Figures on average daily turnover are not
released, but one reporter estimated it at about $282,000, not
including trifectas. Horse racing is coming soon, however.
   _FAST FOOD: Hong Kong's 5.7 million people can choose from 42
McDonald's Restaurants, while Macao's half million residents can
frequent just one. The British colony also has Kentucky Fried
Chicken, Burger King and Pizza Hut outposts.
   _TRAVELING TO CHINA: The border is about an hour from downtown
Hong Kong by train through the colony's rural New Territories.
Everyone must show their travel documents to immigration officials
at a huge border checkpoint before leaving. In Macao, the border is
about 15 minutes from downtown by taxi or bus, at the edge of the
urban area. Anyone can stroll through the yellow arched gateway that
marks the border, but foreigners planning to stay in China must take
the initiative and walk up to a roadside building to get their
passport stamped by the lone Macao immigration officer. Foreigners
need a visa to go beyond the Chinese immigration checkpoint about
100 yards inside the border.

<HEAD>Stephen Gardner Having Fun Protecting Consumers</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: Also on financial wires.</HEAD>
<HEAD>With LaserPhoto</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN A. BOLT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>DALLAS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Consumer champion Stephen Gardner is one of the
lucky ones, living out his high school idealism 20 years later in
professional life.
   ``I'm having so much fun. It's a lot of work, but this is what I
wanted to do in high school,'' said the 38-year-old Gardner, an
assistant Texas attorney general.
   Gardner's fun frequently gives manufacturers fits, especially if
he believes their advertising or other trade practices violate
Texas' consumer protection law.
   His targets come from his own observations _ ``I drive my wife
crazy, I watch (television) commercials'' _ or from complaints
culled from the hundreds his office receives monthly or from
suggestions by consumer protection groups.
   Beyond Texas, Gardner has pulled together attorney general
offices from nine other states to fill in what he says are gaps in
federal enforcement of consumer protection or truth-in-advertising
laws.
   The confederation is ``back-door national regulation,'' he said.
``It's a federal chore, but the feds aren't doing it.''
   ``The Federal Trade Commission is looking for a way not to''
protect consumers, he said in an interview at his Dallas office,
which includes a corner bookcase filled with memorabilia from past
cases: cereal boxes, baby formula, an auto parts guide.
   The 18-month-old collaboration has led to lawsuits or
investigations involving Quaker Oats Co., Sara Lee Corp., Kellogg
Co., Chrysler Corp., credit reporter Chilton Corp. and Citicorp,
among others.
   In Texas, there also have been cases made against a man selling
weedkiller in pill form as a weight-loss aid and an anti-abortion
group advertising its services as an abortion clinic.
   All the companies have denied the charges, but Gardner says
``we've got what we wanted'' in almost every instance.
   The latest action came Sept. 7 when Texas Attorney General Jim
Mattox filed suit against Quaker Oats, charging the company with
making false claims in advertising its hot cereal. The move came
just days after Sara Lee had agreed to settle a lawsuit brought by
the confederation over claims its ``light'' products actually had
more calories that regular products.
   Although the Quaker suit is filed under Mattox' name, it will be
Gardner handling the case, just as he has previous high-profile
lawsuits.
   ``He (Gardner) just loves getting after these big companies,''
said Mattox spokesman Ron Dusek. ``He likes to play it real low key,
when in fact he's a real hot shot.''
   ``This is a case I developed, and I believe in, and I sold
(Mattox) on,'' Gardner said of the Quaker suit. Mattox ``encourages
us to do what we need to do to protect the public, (requiring only)
`If you think the law is on your side, do it.'''
   Gardner agrees there are political overtones to his work _ Mattox
is a likely Democratic gubernatorial candidate _ but says those
issues do not affect his decisions.
   In the Quaker case, there was some discussion about the impact on
Mattox's political plans, he said, but ``we decided that shouldn't
be the basis of enforcing the law.''
   Although he lived in a middle class north Dallas suburb,
Gardner's father and grandfather both were police chiefs in the
high-tone Dallas enclave of Highland Park.
   ``We were `help,''' he said, and his father ``raised me not to
believe that making money was the thing to do.''
   While still in high school, he decided to be a lawyer to help
``empower the people.'' After graduating from the University of
Texas law school in 1975, he remained in Austin until 1982, first as
a legal services lawyer and then the students' attorney for the
university.
   In 1982, he left Texas for New York City, where he honed his
interest in consumer cases as an assistant attorney general. He
returned to Texas in 1984 to head Mattox's Dallas office.
   Then last year he instigated the cooperation of states on
consumer protection issues during a meeting of the National
Association of Attorneys General. The group began with seven or
eight states, and now has 10 on board. Besides Texas, they are
California, Iowa, Minnesota, Wisconsin, Missouri, Illinois, Florida,
New York and Massachusetts.
   The attorneys general who support the collaboration ``are
everywhere across the political spectrum,'' he said, from Reagan
conservatives to liberal Democrats.
   There is no leader of the group, Gardner said, with different
states taking the lead on different issues. In the Quaker case, for
example, the investigation began last year with a letter from the
Minnesota attorney general.
   The cooperation allows for greater efficiency, he said, while at
the same time ``it is a bigger hammer.''
   Gardner's logic is not necessarily accepted by manufacturers.
   ``We feel that the actions of Mr. Gardner and his group ... are
most inappropriate,'' said Thomas Howell Jr., vice president and
general counsel of Quaker Oats, the group's latest target.
   ``A recent blue-ribbon task force of attorneys ... observed that
state attorneys general do not belong in national advertising
matters,'' Howell said, adding that the lawsuit appeared to be
``primarily motivated by the personal ambitions of Mattox and
Gardner.''
   Gardner is sensitive to the possible criticism he is using the
law to impose his own personal agenda, but said, ``I have the duty
as a state official to enforce the law.''
   Plus, he said, any actions by the Texas attorney general or the
other nine states are not the work of one person, but are shaped by
various officials at many levels.
   There are investigations that are begun, but are ended when the
advertising claims hold up to closer scrutiny.
   As for the future, Gardner said, ``It'd be fun to run for office,
but I don't have the money to run for any office I'd have.''

<HEAD>Voyager Beyond The Planets _ A Trek to The Stars</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LEE SIEGEL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Science Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>PASADENA, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   In a billion years, when drifting
continents have reshaped Earth's face and humans are extinct or
changed by evolution, Voyager 2 will still be cruising the stars.
   ``It's mind-boggling. We're actually going out to the stars,''
said Bruce Brymer, Voyager's lead mission controller at NASA's Jet
Propulsion Laboratory. ``This spacecraft is going to outlive us.
It's going to be out there forever.''
   In August, Voyager 2 swept past Neptune and its icy volcanic moon
Triton _ the last planetary exploration in an incredible 12-year
journey that also took the spacecraft past Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus
and more than 50 moons.
   Now, Voyager 2 is speeding into the loneliest part of its trek:
the Voyager Interstellar Mission. With Voyager 1, it will study the
sun's magnetic field, solar wind, and ultraviolet light from distant
stars and galaxies.
   Like Pioneers 10 and 11 and Voyager 1, which explored Jupiter and
Saturn, Voyager 2 also will search for the edge of the solar system.
   The Voyagers are expected to return information to Earth until
about 2015 or 2020. Contact eventually will be cut off by some
malfunction, by exhaustion of the probes' plutonium power
generators, or when their thruster fuel runs out, leaving them
unable to point antennas at Earth.
   Then, the robot explorers will pass among the stars, each
carrying a 12-inch copper record of sounds and sights from Earth in
case they are found by a spacefaring civilization. ``Hopefully they
will understand our peaceful and humble attempt at knowing and
exploring the great unknown,'' Brymer said.
   For now, Voyager 2's work is more mundane.
   ``The interstellar mission is sort of anticlimactic. There's no
real drama expected. We're suffering from the blues a little bit,''
he said. ``It's almost like postpartum depression. We've gone
through such highs with the spacecraft. There's a great sense of
melancholy now. It's like none I've sensed before.''
   Voyager 2's encounter with Neptune officially ends Oct. 2, when
it will be 34.7 million miles past the planet, going 37,337 mph. It
will be 2.83 billion miles from Earth, and will have traveled 4.46
billion miles since 1977.
   Until December, Voyager 2 occasionally will glance at Neptune and
dark space to improve the accuracy of observations its cameras and
instruments made during the Neptune flyby, said Voyager project
manager Norm Haynes.
   Pictures of empty space let engineers measure how much sunlight
reflects off Voyager into its cameras. A computer can subtract the
light from Voyager's Neptune and Triton photographs, producing
clearer prints, Haynes said.
   In April, most of the planets will be positioned for one of the
Voyagers to take photographs for assembly into a single picture of
the solar system. ``The planets are small and there's lots of dark
space out there,'' he said. ``Maybe it will give people a better
impression of the vastness of things.''
   Then engineers will turn off Voyager 2's TV cameras and its
infrared and visible light sensors.
   Voyager's Interstellar Mission officially starts Jan. 1, but the
spacecraft already is using its remaining sensors to make the kind
of measurements it will continue to collect for years. Ultraviolet
light and cosmic ray sensors study distant galaxies and stars, and
also black holes and pulsars _ remnants of stars that died in fiery
supernova explosions.
   Both Voyagers also will keep measuring magnetic fields,
electrically charged particles that make up solar wind, and waves in
that wind.
   If the Voyagers and Pioneers survive, one or more of them may
detect the ``heliopause,'' where solar wind yields to interstellar
wind some 5 billion to 14 billion miles from the sun. Many
scientists consider it the edge of the solar system.
   By about 2020, the Voyagers will lose contact with Earth.
   ``My electrical energy is fading, and I am feeling old and
useless,'' says Voyager 2's imaginary voice in ``The Voyager Neptune
Travel Guide,'' a National Aeronautics and Space Administration
publication. ``The planet which gave me life said goodbye. I will no
longer hear its voice, nor it my heartbeat.''
   Then, Voyager will approach the stars, passing them like distant
beacons in an incredible void.
   In the year 20,391, Voyager will pass within 3.21 light years,
18.9 trillion miles, of Proxima Centauri, the nearest star. Some
24,000 years from now, it should pass through the Oort Cloud, a vast
spherical cloud of comets that other scientists consider the true
edge of the solar system.
   ``Then Voyager makes for the open sea of interstellar space, free
of the sun's gravity and wandering forever in the Milky Way galaxy,
going once around the center of the galaxy once every
quarter-billion years,'' said Cornell University astronomer Carl
Sagan.
   NASA estimates that in the year 40,176, Voyager 2 will fly 1.65
light years from Ross 248 _ the first time it will be closer to
another star than to the sun, which will be 1.99 light years from
Voyager.
   In the year 296,036, Voyager 2 will make its closest approach to
Sirius, the brightest star visible from Earth.
   Deep space is very benign, so dust and cosmic rays will erode
Voyager 2 extraordinarily slowly.
   In a billion or more years, Sagan said, ``there will be no more
humans because we'll be extinct or we'll be somebody else. There
will be no human artifacts left on Earth. Continental drift will
completely change what the continents look like.
   ``But this brave spacecraft will be there, a surviving artifact
of our species and our times.''
   Perhaps one day, aliens in a starship may find one of the
Voyagers, then play the copper record.
   They will hear greetings in 60 languages from Chinese to Welsh to
Urdu, including a 7-year-old boy offering salutations from Earth's
children.
   There also is the music of many cultures, from Chuck Berry's rock
'n' roll to Mozart, Bach and Beethoven.
   The aliens will listen to the sounds of surf, wind, rain and
thunder; croaking frogs and laughing hyenas; a train, a truck, a jet
and a rocket; a baby crying and lovers kissing.
   The record also holds 115 electronically encoded photographs or
diagrams showing humans, the Earth and other planets, human
chromosomes, a fetus, the Golden Gate, the Grand Tetons and the
Great Wall of China.
   And the extraterrestrials will read a message written July 16,
1977, by Jimmy Carter, then president of a nation on a little planet
that, two months later, dared send a bit of itself to the stars:
   ``This is a present from a small distant world, a token of our
sounds, our science, our images, our music, our thoughts and our
feelings.
   ``We are attempting to survive our time so we may live into
yours. We hope someday, having solved the problems we face, to join
a community of galactic civilizations. This record represents our
hope and our determination, and our good will in a vast and awesome
universe.''

<HEAD>New Vaccines Proposed For Whooping Cough, Chicken Pox</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MALCOLM RITTER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Science Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A vaccine that would be the nation's first for
chicken pox has been submitted for federal approval, and a new
whooping cough vaccine with less risk of side effects may follow
soon.
   Chicken pox strikes more than 3 million Americans a year, mostly
children. While it is generally just bothersome, a small fraction of
patients suffer harm to the central nervous system or other
complications such as pneumonia or bacterial infections. About 175
Americans a year die from such problems.
   Some calculations suggest that given the medical costs of
complications, a chicken pox vaccine can make economic sense for
society as a whole.
   Merck Sharpe &amp; Dohme of West Point, Pa., in August asked the Food
and Drug Administration to approve its vaccine, which Stanley
Plotkin, chairman of the American Academy of Pediatrics said is
already used in Japan and Europe.
   One question is whether a childhood inoculation will lose its
effectiveness in adulthood, a particular concern because chicken pox
is generally more serious when it strikes adults.
   ``We would all like more data'' on the duration of immunity,
Plotkin said. Studies have shown no problem up to 10 years after
inoculation, and vaccinated people who do get chicken pox later
appear to get milder cases, he said.
   The vaccine contains a weakened version of the chicken pox virus,
which in its natural form causes a lifelong nerve infection that can
erupt into herpes zoster, commonly called shingles. Studies suggest
that vaccinated people run a lower risk of later shingles than do
people who had chicken pox, Plotkin said.
   The standard vaccine for whooping cough, called pertussis, is
given in early childhood as part of the
diphtheria-tetanus-pertussis, or DTP, vaccine.
   About half of children who get the DTP vaccine run a fever, with
swelling or soreness at the injection site in 40 percent to 50
percent, chiefly due to the pertussis portion of the vaccine,
according to one large study.
   The fever can cause convulsions, usually not a serious problem
but still upsetting for parents.
   In contrast, recent research found that fever appeared in only
about 5 percent of children vaccinated with a new ``acellular''
pertussis vaccine, and localized reactions were minimal, said James
Cherry of the University of California, Los Angeles, School of
Medicine.
   Lederle Laboratories of Wayne, N.J., may be ready by early next
year to ask the FDA to approve the new vaccine, a spokesman said.
The immunization, which eventually would become part of the DTP, is
already used in Japan, he said.
   The infectious disease committee of the pediatrics academy
recently urged the FDA to approve the vaccine, but only for the
booster shots given after age 1, Plotkin said. Experts disagree on
whether it works as well as the standard version when administered
before that age, he said.
   The DTP vaccine is recommended at 2 months, 4 months and 6
months, with boosters at either 15 months or 18 months, and again
before entering school at ages 4 to 6 years.
   The current DTP vaccine has been dogged by concerns that its
whooping cough component can cause brain damage, including mental
retardation and movement difficulties.
   That is ``a highly controversial area,'' Plotkin said. ``My
opinion is that there is no solid evidence that it causes brain
damage.''
   In any case, the Lederle spokesman said, it is too soon to tell
whether the new vaccine would affect rates of brain damage alleged
to result from the current vaccine.

<BYLINE>By RAY FORMANEK Jr.</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MORGANTOWN, W.Va. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Seeds buried for centuries in the
permafrost of the arctic tundra could help save plant varieties
threatened by extinction and provide living fossils to study plant
evolution.
   ``It's a logical environment to look for very old seeds that are
viable,'' said James B. McGraw, a biologist at West Virginia
University. ``The permafrost soil buries the seeds, insulates them
and keeps them frozen. No bacteria, predators or fungi can get at
them. They're really protected.''
   McGraw has spent the past two summers digging up the dry, frozen
dirt beneath a hillside about 100 miles northeast of Fairbanks,
Alaska, hoping to find seeds still alive after thousands of years.
   Seeds from the early 1800s have yielded grass-like plants called
reeds and rushes, and McGraw is eager to see what grows in soil
estimated to be between 1,500 and 2,000 years old uncovered during
his latest dig. ``We won't know exactly what we have until we have
the samples carbon-dated. We may find something, we may not. But
there are hints that we may.''
   The dating process won't be completed until next spring.
   Scientists have known since the early 1970s that some seeds can
stay viable for hundreds of years under the right conditions. A
600-year-old seed found in a nutshell rattle and germinated in 1971
is the oldest known seed to sprout.
   Knowing how long seeds can stay viable could help improve storage
in seed banks where the government preserves thousands of crop
varieties. Thousands of irreplaceable seeds die annually in
underfunded, antiquated seed banks.
   The research also could help uncover a genetic trait for
hardiness that could be transferred to crops grown in the harsh
conditions found in some Third World countries, McGraw said. ``We
have found significant differences between our older seeds and
younger seeds that appear to be genetic, but we won't be sure until
we complete our DNA analysis.
   ``There have been no major surprises yet, but we've looked at
only 100 samples gathered last year. We have five times that many
this year.''
   McGraw and his crew of volunteers used only picks and shovels to
dig a trench through a five-foot layer of clay, called a lobe, to
reach the seed-bearing layer of organic material. No mechanized
equipment was used because of the damage it would have caused to the
delicate tundra environment.
   The samples were put in plastic bags, kept frozen in large
coolers and shipped to Morgantown where they were transfered to
dozens of trays, watered and kept under lights 20 hours a day to
simulate the arctic summer.
   ``We put them under ideal germinating conditions and basically
just see if anything grows,'' McGraw said. ``It's the most efficient
way to look for seeds because they're so small and hard to find.''
   Once the plants sprout, McGraw removes the seed cover from the
root, and the seed's age is determined through carbon dating _
measuring the amount of naturally radioactive carbon remaining in
the material.
   He then uses the ``living fossils'' to compare the structure,
growth rates and other characteristics of plants grown from old
seeds and those existing on the tundra. ``We've got some seeds that
are nearly 200 years old and they are genetically different from the
modern day seed and that's interesting.
   ``But it will be even more interesting when we have seeds that
are 1,000 or 2,000 years old and can measure their evolutionary
development.
   ``We're not there yet, but we're closer.''
   McGraw hopes to collect samples old enough to test theories of
evolution.
   ``Current evolutionary theory tells us that natural selection
should keep improving the genotype of the plant,'' he said. ``If
that's true, then the older types shouldn't stand a chance against
the more recent plants.
   ``We'll soon be able to check that.''

<HEAD>93 Texans Found Harmed By Illegal Hong Kong Drug Compound</HEAD>

   Health officials are investigating sales of a
dangerous drug compound in Texas under the name ``The Miracle Herb.''
   Texas health officials last year found ``chuifong tokuwan,'' a
drug compound made in Hong Kong, for sale in pill form, said the
Centers for Disease Control. Chuifong tokuwan first appeared in the
United States in 1974 and was banned by the Food and Drug
Administration in 1978.
   The product contains several drugs, as well as lead and cadmium,
which can cause kidney disfunction, the CDC said. The drugs found in
Texas usually were repackaged and labeled ``The Miracle Herb _
Mother Nature's Finest.''
   Ninety-three people were found in rural western Texas who had
taken it and some showed indication of kidney disfunction, the CDC

<HEAD>Research May Have Answer To Summertime Scourge</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW, Idaho (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An appetite suppressant for mosquitoes could
be an answer to that summertime scourge, but one challenge still
remaining is getting the substance out of the lab and into female
mosquitoes.
   ``Right now you'd have to inject each mosquito with a little
syringe,'' said University of Idaho entymologist Marc Klowden.
   Female mosquitoes _ the ones that do the buzzing and biting each
summer _ need protein in human and animal blood to produce eggs.
Klowden, in 13 years of study, has found that females stop feeding
once they have a bellyful of blood.
   One reason is a hormone produced during the egg-creating process.
Klowden has found that injecting the hormone into female mosquitoes
tricks them into thinking they're full. They stop feeding and biting.
   Research now is shifting to biotechnology, in search of a gene
that causes mosquitoes to create the appetite suppressant hormone,
he said. If scientists can find the gene, they might be able to
splice it to a virus and create a disease that keeps mosquitoes from
eating or reproducing.
   But don't throw away your bug spray just yet. ``There's a number
of things that have to be done. We're talking many, many years in
the future.''

<HEAD>Acne Drug Linked To Birth Defects Still Over-Prescribed</HEAD>
<BYLINE>BY TONY KENNEDY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MINNEAPOLIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   U.S. physicians continue to over-prescribe the
acne-fighting drug Accutane to women of child-bearing age despite
pervasive warnings about its potential for causing birth defects, a
government regulator says.
   ``There is a vast number of instances in which the drug is being
prescribed for people who don't need it,'' said Robert Nelson,
chairman of the Accutane Monitoring Group of the U.S. Food and Drug
Administration.
   Of an estimated 50,000 to 70,000 new female users of the drug
each year, fewer than 20,000 and perhaps as few as 5,000 have an
acne problem that merits using it, Nelson told an international
conference on drug effects.
   James LaBraico of Hoffman-La Roche Inc., the maker of Accutane,
said Nelson's estimate of excessive use is high, but he agreed that
it is clear some doctors prescribe the drug to women who don't need
it. ``I don't think there is a lot of frivolous use. But we need to
define severe acne better.''
   The drug's effectiveness is a powerful argument for its
prescription. A single 20-week treatment usually puts severe acne _
which is five times more common in women than men _ into remission
for up to two years, said Dr. Robert Stern of Harvard Medical School
and Boston-based Beth Israel Hospital.
   As of July 31, La Roche had documented 78 cases of birth defects
among infants delivered by woman exposed to Accutane during
pregnancy. Since the drug was introduced in 1982, the survey has
detected 433 pregnant users, about half of whom chose to have
abortions, said Dr. Wanju Dai, a company researcher.
   The birth defects have centered on the ears, nervous and
cardiovascular systems, Dai said. About 70 of the 433 women who
reported being pregnant while taking the drug gave birth to healthy
babies, she said.
   The link to birth defects in the company survey and other surveys
prompted the FDA to intervene. Besides over-prescribing, the FDA
found that some doctors weren't warning women of the dangers of
becoming pregnant while on the drug.
   At the FDA's urging, La Roche in May opened a new assembly line
to package Accutane exclusively in 10-pill ``blister packs'' with
warnings. Also included is a questionnaire inviting users to
participate in the tracking study.
   Because the study relies on doctors to urge users to participate,
there is a fear that only patients of ``good doctors'' who give
adequate warnings will take part, Nelson said. Patients of doctors
who are lax in giving warnings may be less inclined to join, which
could skew the results in the company's favor.
   LaBraico said the Nutley, N.J.-based drug company knows of the
shortcomings and is considering ways to make the sample more
representative.

   Workers who sued employers for invasion of
privacy, sexual harassment or slander won an average jury award of
$375,000 in 1988, according to a report.
   A survey included in the report, released Wednesday, also found
that juries decided heavily in favor of employees, returning
verdicts for the workers in 72 percent of cases between 1985 and
1988.
   ``Employee privacy issues are destined to be the labor law issue
of the 1990s as they continue to be fueled by controversies over
workplace drug testing, AIDS, workplace monitoring of job functions
and management responses to family issues,'' said the authors of the
Bureau of National Affairs report, lawyers Ira Michael Shepard,

   Their Washington employment law firm of Schmeltzer, Aptaker &amp;
Sheppard conducted the 50-state survey of employee lawsuits.
   Duston said the 1988 invasion of privacy verdicts included cases
involving drug and alcohol abuse, unlawful surveillance by employers
and use of lie-detector tests. The average award was $375,307.
   ``A substantial new array of complex and novel legal theories
have developed under which employees are attempting to redress what
they see as a decline in their privacy rights,'' the report said.
``The United States is forging the cutting edge of employee privacy
rights.''

<HEAD>Fed Approves More Liberal Underwriting Limit for Bank Subsidiaries</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Federal Reserve Board has given approval
for banks to double the amount of revenue that their securities
subsidiaries can earn from certain underwriting operations.
   The change, announced Wednesday, will mean that a bank's
securities subsidary will be able to earn up to 10 percent of its
revenues from the underwriting activities, up from the previous
limit of 5 percent.
   The activities covered include underwriting of corporate debt,
municipal revenue bonds, commercial paper, mortgage-backed
securities and securities backed by consumer loans.
   The rest of the revenue must come from other types of businesses,
such as the underwriting of general obligation bonds issued by
municipalities and U.S. government securities, two less risky areas
of underwriting that have always been opened to banks.
   The Fed's decision, which came on a 6-0 vote, drew praise from
the banking industry, which has been pressing to be allowed to
expand further into the securities area.
   ``These decisions correctly open the securities door a bit wider
for banking and remind everyone of the need to get old-fashioned
bank regulations in sync with the modern marketplace,'' said Thomas
P. Rideout, president of the American Bankers Association and a vice
chairman of First Union National Bank of Charlotte, N.C. ``The
benefits of prudent bank entry into securities far outweigh
potential concerns alleged by our protectionist competitors.''
   Rideout said that the banker's group hoped that the Fed would
expand the income level to 25 percent in the future.
   The Fed first approved bank underwriting activities for bank
subsidiaries in 1987 and added corporate debt to the list of
acceptable securities in January of this year. The board has
indicated that it would decide in a year whether to allow banks to
underwrite stock.
   The Fed's decision Wednesday fits in with a trend in recent years
in which advances in bank deregulation have come through
administrative and court decisions because of a political deadlock
in Congress over the question of restructuring the financial system.
   The Bush administration is currently studying the question of
what changes it will recommend making in the Depression-era
Glass-Steagall Act, the law which separated commerical and
investment banking as part of the reforms passed by Congress
following the 1929 stock market crash.

   An Eastern Airlines pilot who recently crossed the
picket line in the 6{-month strike against the carrier said he came
back because of the severe financial hardship the walkout caused him.
   ``It was very cold days for myself,'' Peter Clements told Texas
Air Corp.'s annual meeting here Wednesday. ``I realized that
cardboard doesn't keep you warm. It doesn't pay the bills, either.''
   Clements, an 18-year Eastern veteran, went on strike with the
airline's pilots, flight attendants and Machinists union members on
March 4 but decided to return to work last month. Several hundred
Eastern pilots are estimated to have crossed the picket line at the
same time, after the now-ousted leader of the airline's pilots union
urged them to do so.
   Clements said Eastern now is ``a wonderful place to work.''
   Miami-based Eastern, a subsidiary of Texas Air, has been under
Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection since March 9. Texas Air Chairman
Frank Lorenzo told shareholders at the meeting that Eastern ``has
made an astonishing rebound from the devastation caused by the
strike of its three unions, and is recovering much faster than
expected.''
   Lorenzo was visibly moved by the remarks by Clements and other
non-striking Eastern employees at the meeting, and several
bystanders noticed tears in his eyes as he left the room when the
session ended.
   Another veteran pilot, Frank Barber, said he has been on the job
since the strike started.
   ``We had some very dark days early on ... but with the 600-plus
flights a day now, we're very excited,'' he told the shareholders.

<BYLINE>Lorenzo Says He's Not Quitting Business</BYLINE>

   Texas Air Corp. Chairman Frank Lorenzo insists
that he plans to remain in the airline business, countering
speculation that he might quit.
   A defiant Lorenzo also said Wednesday that Texas Air's Eastern
Airlines subsidiary will start turning a profit next year, despite
the strikebound carrier's enormous debts and bankruptcy proceeding.
   While about 100 Eastern strikers chanted anti-Lorenzo slogans
outside the long-delayed Texas Air annual meeting, the chairman of
the nation's biggest airline company told shareholders he has no
plans to quit the business, won't sell Eastern and likely will have
Texas Air assume some of Eastern's financial obligations.
   ``I have no intentions of leaving the airline business,'' Lorenzo
said at a news conference after the meeting. ``I plan to be around
for plenty of years to come, God willing.''
   Speculation that Lorenzo might quit was fueled by his surprise
announcement Aug. 24 that he was considering selling all or part of
Houston-based Continental Airlines, Texas Air's other main
subsidiary. He had no comment on a statement Wednesday by Jan
Carlzon, managing director of Scandinavian Airlines System, that SAS
has no ``immediate interest'' in buying part of Continental.
   SAS, which owns a 9.9 percent stake in Texas Air, has been in
talks with Texas Air officials about possibly buying part of
Continental. Under U.S. law, foreign airlines are allowed to own up
to 25 percent of an American carrier.
   Security was tight at the hotel where the shareholders meeting
took place, largely because of Lorenzo's unpopularity among Eastern
strikers. Stockholders had to pass through metal detectors,
television cameras were banned from the meeting room and Houston
uniformed and plainclothes police as well as private security guards
were present.
   Lorenzo's remarks about Miami-based Eastern came as the airline
is mired in the seventh month of a strike that has become a national
symbol of labor resistance and has left thousands of pilots, flight
attendants and Machinists union members walking picket lines
demanding Lorenzo's resignation.
   Eastern has been replacing the strikers with picket-line crossers
and non-union hires and is flying a limited operation, but it is
doing business under the protection of federal bankruptcy court _
where it sought protection from creditors five days after the strike
began March 4.
   If Continental were sold, some observers believe Lorenzo might
liquidate Eastern and quit the business.
   But the airline chief told about 300 shareholders at the meeting
that Eastern ``is projecting profitable operations beginning next
year.'' The stockholders responded with applause.
   Eastern has made an ``astonishing rebound from the devastation
caused by the strike of its three unions, and is recovering much
faster than expected,'' Lorenzo said during the hourlong meeting.
   He said Eastern's proposed reorganization plan, submitted to
bankruptcy court July 21, likely will receive final court approval
by year end or early next year, clearing the way for the airline to
emerge from bankruptcy at about two-thirds its pre-strike size.
   ``Texas Air is standing behind Eastern Airlines, and the
possibility is excellent that Texas Air will assist Eastern,'' said
Lorenzo, who aggressively built the parent company from a small
intrastate carrier into an airline empire.
   The annual meeting coincided with a hearing in U.S. Bankruptcy
Court in New York at which a judge approved a plan for payment of
$98.3 million Eastern owes to employee pension plans. Texas Air is
lending Eastern $45 million toward the payment, Eastern is paying
$27 million with the proceeds of asset sales, and the rest has been
deferred until July 1990.
   Eastern's proposed reorganization calls for repaying all
creditors in full, including refunding the price of tickets that
weren't used because of the walkout.
   The strikers have been pushing for a sale of Eastern in its
entirety and have allied themselves in that effort with Joseph
Ritchie, a Chicago businessman. Eastern, meanwhile, has been selling
aircraft, routes and airport gates to raise money toward paying off
its $2.3 billion debt.
   The Air Line Pilots Association, which represents pilots at
nearly all the nation's major carriers, has spent $69.5 million _
about 57 percent of its contingency fund _ on the battle with
Eastern. Pilots at the other airlines have provided strike benefits
to Eastern pilots averaging about $2,400 a month per pilot, said
John Mazor, an ALPA spokesman in Washington.
   But the number of pilots paying those assessments to their
colleagues at Eastern has decreased as the strike has worn on, Mazor
said in a telephone interview.
   ``That's typical for any (strike) assessment, for any labor
union,'' he said. ``It goes through a predictable cycle.''
   ALPA members are being balloted on whether to continue strike
benefits to their Eastern colleagues, he said.

   Britain continues to lead the world as a center
for currency trading, but the United States and Japan are catching
up as trading volume continues to mushroom, central bank surveys
show.
   Daily trading in currencies totaled $187 billion in London,
$128.9 billion in New York and $115.2 billion in Tokyo, according to
April surveys released by the central banks Wednesday.
   Currency trading worldwide has more than doubled since 1986, the
last time surveys were done. Figures for different countries cannot
simply be added up because cross-border trades are counted twice, in
the buyer's country and the seller's.
   The growth in currency trading far exceeds the expansion of
international trade in goods and services, which is the underlying
reason for currency trading.
   Although businesses need to trade currencies to do business
abroad, the vast majority of currency trading today is speculation
by banks and other dealers, statistics indicate.
   Big banks devote large staffs to playing the market, buying and
selling currencies by the minute in hopes of pocketing profits by
guessing short-term price trends.
   In the United States, only about 12 percent of banks' dealings
are with industrial companies and other institutions that need
currencies for purposes other than speculation, according to
Gretchen Greene, a senior vice president at the Federal Reserve Bank
of New York.
   The rapid growth in currency trading reflects the closer
connections among stock and bond markets around the world and the
attractiveness of dealing in currencies for speculation and hedging,
among other factors, Greene said.
   In London, average daily currency trading rose 107 percent to
$187 billion from $90 billion in 1986.
   In New York, trading rose 120 percent to $128.9 billion a day
from $58.5 billion three years earlier.
   The Tokyo market showed the fastest growth, up 140 percent to
$115.2 billion from $48 billion.
   In comparison, world exports rose by about a third from 1986 to
1988, according to United Nations figures. Estimates for 1989 are
not yet available.
   After the big three trading centers came Switzerland, $57
billion; Hong Kong, $49 billion; France, $26 billion; the
Netherlands, $16 billion; and Canada, $15 billion, up 57 percent.
Canada was the only one of the smaller markets surveyed in 1986.
   More than $300 billion worth of dollars, marks, yen, pounds,
francs and other currencies change hands daily, surveys by the banks
reveal.
   The total is probably more than $400 billion a day, although
estimates are difficult because of the double-counting problem.
   Central bankers plan to share information in order to eliminate
double-counting of cross-border trades and come up with a net figure
for worldwide currency trading, possibly later this year or early in
1990, Greene said.
   The central banks surveyed banks, other financial institutions
and brokers over 20 business days in April. The Federal Reserve has
surveyed currency trading every three years since 1977 and was
joined in 1986 by a few other central banks.
   The volume of trading is so huge that it often overwhelms efforts
by central banks to stabilize currency rates, such as by selling
dollars on the open market when the dollar is getting too high.
   For example, Federal Reserve dollar sales of $130 million in the
U.S. market would equal only one-tenth of 1 percent of total trading
on an average day, the new statistics show.
   But Greene said central banks still can be effective because
although total trading volume is huge, the imbalances between supply
and demand that cause prices to move are much narrower. In other
words, supplying a small sum of dollars to the market could soak up
the excess demand and halt a price rise.
   The greatest concentration of trading continued to be in the
dollar against the West German mark, Japanese yen and British pound,
the surveys showed.
   Trades that didn't involve the dollar, such as selling marks for
yen, grew in importance. They rose to 11 percent of total volume
from 4 percent in London. They totaled about 4 percent in New York.
No New York comparison for 1986 was available.

   Personal bankruptcy filings have doubled
since 1980 and account for one half the annual fees paid by bank
credit card holders, said the president of Visa U.S.A. in announcing
a nationwide crackdown on fraudulent filers.
   Jon Cristoffersen said Wednesday that efforts are under way in
Los Angeles, Dallas, Houston and Chicago and will reach most major
areas by year end.
   ``Bankruptcy can be an appropriate way for honest people to deal
with a financial problem,'' he said. ``But our concern is with the
fraudulent filing, which can be as many as one in three.''
   Personal bankruptcy filings have increased since 1980 to about
600,000 last year, or one in 178 households. Cristoffersen said that
socked the bank card industry with total losses of $1.5 billion in
1988 as bankrupt cardholders simply wrote off their credit card debt.
   ``About half of everyone's annual fees for bank cards comes from
bankruptcy,'' he said. ``If we're able to deal with even 20 to 30
percent of the fraud, the payback to the public will be
substantial.''
   Most people who file for bankruptcy fraudulently have been able
to get away with it, Cristoffersen said, because two-thirds of the
banks with assets over $1 billion haven't been challenging them.
   Visa's new program encourages member banks to screen for fraud
and abuse of the federal bankruptcy law, challenge filings in court
and seek criminal prosecution.
   Bankruptcy frauds include those who don't declare all their
assets, such as real estate in other states or inheritances. They
also include those who sell assets below their true market value or
transfer ownership to a third party or relative. Abusers also
include those who have the ability to pay back their debts but
choose not to.
   ``The stories are legend, like the man who wanted to spread out
payments for his Jaguar, or the chap who lost $350,000 on a single
roll of the dice after he took out 30 bank cards,'' Cristoffersen
said.
   Cristoffersen, speaking at a convention of the National
Foundation For Consumer Credit Inc., outlined a tough program that
so far has enlisted 70 member banks. Those banks, including
Citibank, Bank of America and Chase Manhattan, issue 60 percent of
Visa's 118 million cards in the country and are victims of 75
percent of all bankruptcies.
   When member banks in the program receive bankruptcy notices, they
will immediately review the account and, if they suspect fraud or
abuse, notify all other members listed on the bankruptcy petition.
   The other members will do a similar search, and when two or more
believe they have found fraud or abuse they will collectively use a
single local law firm to represent them.
   ``By multiple members reviewing bankruptcies they can put
together a clearer picture of fraud and abuse and make it
economically feasible to go after the abusers,'' said Kenneth R.
Crone, who heads the bankruptcy recovery program for Visa.
   The program also includes pursuit of criminal prosecution. Visa
has hired a former FBI agent who will investigate cases, prepare
them for review by the FBI and seek prosecution by the U.S. attorney
on a fast-track basis under a special arrangement with the Justice
Department.
   In Los Angeles, the number of accounts showing up with fraud or
abuse that are being challenged under the pilot program has doubled
to more than 300 in the past three months, Crone said.
   That represents a small percentage of the more than 30,000
fraudulent or abusive bankruptcies among the 51,000 declared each
year in Los Angeles. But Crone believes the program is sending the
message that ``there's a darn good chance they'll get caught, that
the bankruptcy petition will be thrown out of court and they'll have
to pay attorney fees and face criminal prosecution.''
   The Bankruptcy Reform Act, which was rewritten in 1978, was
designed to encourage Chapter 11 or Chapter 13 personal
``reorganization'' filings, wherein the debtor pays back creditors
as much as possible over three to five years, Crone said.
   ``But we've seen an incredible boom of Chapter 7 bankruptcies,
where there are no assets and people get their entire unsecured debt
discharged,'' Crone said. ``Credit cards are unsecured so they're
the first to get written off.''
   Of the nearly 600,000 personal bankruptcy filings in 1988, about
95 percent were Chapter 7 filings, Visa said.
   The National Foundation for Consumer Credit is the parent
organization for more than 400 consumer credit counseling offices
and offers free counseling services.
   Visa, the world's largest consumer payment system, has more than
19,000 U.S. bank members with $120 billion in payment volume a year.

   Somewhere in the Soviet Union future Big
Macs are still on the hoof. But the people who will run the first
McDonald's restaurant in Moscow are training hard already at
Hamburger University.
   Five Soviets arrived at McDonald's suburban Chicago headquarters
Sunday for two weeks of training at its school for restaurant
managers.
   After returning to Moscow, they will be in charge of what's
expected to be the world's highest-volume McDonald's, scheduled to
open near Pushkin Square early next year with seating for 900.
   Big Macs in the borscht belt?
   ``Russia, as you probably know, has very good cuisine,
tasteful,'' said Alexander Egorov, deputy general director of
Moscow-McDonald's. ``But today, in our age when the speed of life is
very fast, it is very difficult to eat a borscht plate very fast.
   ``There is a great need for fast-food restaurants such as
McDonald's that will provide Muscovites with nutritious food and
excellent service.''
   Egorov and his fellow trainees spoke Wednesday while making fast
work of lunch before heading off to afternoon classes.
   Moscow Mac's is a joint venture between McDonald's Restaurants of
Canada Ltd. and the Food Service Administration of the Moscow City
Council. Plans call for 20 restaurants and for all food _ including
the beef _ to be raised in the Soviet Union.
   ``There are herds already waiting,'' Egorov said.
   Joining Egorov at Hamburger University are four restaurant
managers: Khamzat Kazbulatov, Mikhail Shelesnov, Georgij Smoleevskij
and Vladimir Zhurakovskij.
   Before arriving at Hamburger U., the five spent the summer
studying at McDonald's Institue of Hamburgerology in Toronto. Their
training included counter work and cooking at McDonald's
restaurants, but in Oak Brook they are taking advanced operations
courses to learn management skills.
   Their counselor, Hamburger U. professor Henry Chapoy, said the
five are ``typical McDonald's people.''
   ``Opening a country, I really wasn't expecting them to be at that
level, but yes, they have that level. It's called `ketchup in the
veins,''' Chapoy said.
   The five spend long days in classes and were to start laboratory
work today. At night, they study from manuals printed in English and
Russian.
   On Wednesday, the five could be distinguished from fellow
students in an ``Effective People Practices'' class only by their
headphones. Although each studied English this summer, translator
Oleg Shakov, who took the course two weeks ago to prepare, worked
from a darkened booth nearby.
   The seminars ``are very useful to me because I personally have
learned a lot of new things for myself, for example, effective
people practices,'' said Shelesnov. ``My basic knowledge of how to
communicate to people comes from Moscow, but what I've learned here
has provided some insight into how to communicate well.''
   All but Zhurakovskij, whose background is in foreign trade and
engineering, have extensive experience in the food-service industry.
They were selected from nearly a thousand applicants.
   The Soviet McDonald's is one fruit of a Kremlin law on joint
ventures enacted in 1987 to woo foreign capital, technology and
expertise from abroad. That mission is not lost on the new Hamburger
U. students.
   Asked about the problems of transferring their training to a
Moscow workforce, Shelesnov said, ``I can only guess, because this
has never been done before. It won't be easy.''
   Although they expect no shortage of customers at home, none of
the five has much experience with the product they'll be selling.
None had eaten any McDonald's food before arriving in Canada.
   ``I really liked it a lot,'' Shelesnov said matter-of-fact.
   ``No, really, it was tasty,'' Zhurakovskij quickly emphasized.

<HEAD>Bank Group, Mexico Announce Agreement on Terms of Debt Reduction</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Mexican government and a committee of banks
have announced an agreement on detailed language covering the
historic debt-reduction plan reached between that nation and the
bank group in July.
   The language, called a term sheet, will be sent to the more than
500 banks owed money by Mexico, officials said Wednesday. The term
sheet provides a list of options the banks may exercise to reduce
the amount of Mexican debt on their books.
   ``The agreement on the term sheet concludes the second stage of
the process,'' said Angel Gurria, undersecretary of the Mexican
Ministry of Finance.
   ``As expected, it has taken several weeks since we reached
agreement in principle in July, but the issues we confronted were
new, extremely complex and economically of great importance, both to
Mexico and the banks,'' he said in a statement released in New York,
where the bank committee and Mexican officials met.
   ``After a period for review, we will visit financial centers
around the world to explain the package and answer the banks'
questions,'' Gurria said.
   The term sheet covers the period of 1989-92.
   Mexico's agreement in principle with the steering committee of 15
creditor banks, reached July 24, was seen as a test of Bush
administration policy for reducing Third World debt and as a
milestone for other debtor countries waiting to renegotiate.
   It represents the first significant reduction in a government's
debt to commercial banks.
   Under the agreement, each bank has three options: a 35 percent
reduction in principle, reduction of the interest rate on its loans
to 6\ percent from the current average of about 10 percent, or
providing new loans equal to 25 percent of what Mexico owes the bank.
   The deal applies to about $53 billion of Mexico's foreign debt,
which totals about $107 billion, second in the developing world only
to the $120 billion owed by Brazil.
   In a statement, U.S. Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady praised
the agreement on the term sheet.
   ``This agreement represents an important step forward in
implementing the strengthened debt strategy and in Mexico's efforts
to obtain needed debt reduction and new financing to support its
economic reform program,'' Brady said.
   Mexican Treasury Secretary Pedro Aspe has said that Mexico's goal
in reaching a debt agreement is to decrease the amount of the
nation's gross national product paid to the banks for debt service
from the 6.3 percent of recent years to 2.7 percent.
   He said that paying as much as Mexico has been paying for its
debt service is ``incompatible'' with economic growth.
   After the agreement was reached in July, Aspe said Mexico had
achieved all its main goals: a real reduction in its debt, a
reduction in the transfer of assets abroad to pay the debt, a
long-term debt agreement, and breathing room for the nation to renew
economic growth.

   Pan Am Corp. became the first U.S. airline to run
a permanent foreign service 62 years ago and gained a reputation as
America's flag carrier, but survival may dictate that it find a
foreign bankroller.
   Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Thomas G. Plaskett disclosed
this possibility Wednesday and seemed to suggest Pan Am viewed
partial foreign ownership as the most realistic way to escape an era
of staggering losses that has left its future in doubt.
   Plaskett said in February that Pan Am would need to find a merger
partner or attract new investment to survive, but he did not
emphasize the foreign ownership option.
   Pan Am unsucessfully bid for Northwest Airlines parent NWA Inc. a
few months later and has been said to be weighing a bid for United
Airlines parent UAL Corp.
   Plaskett's remarks came against a background of growing overseas
airline investment in U.S. carriers, a trend that is reshaping the
commercial aviation industry and raising speculation that some day
foreign airlines might freely fly domestic U.S. routes, which they
currently aren't allowed to do.
   Since 1988, Scandinavian Airlines System has acquired a small
stake in Texas Air Corp., owner of Continental and Eastern; Dutch
airline KLM joined a group of investors buying NWA; and most
recently, British Airways joined a group seeking to buy UAL.
   Although U.S. law limits foreigners to 25 percent ownership of a
U.S. airline, these minority ownership arrangements have given the
foreign partners enormous influence over U.S. airline strategies.
   Moreover, they could create what amounts to a new breed of
super-airline with tremendous global reach by linking schedules and
ticketing services.
   Plaskett said the British Airways involvement with United, for
example, would create an operation that offers passengers nearly
half the world's existing air routes, more than any other airline or
alliance of airlines.
   ``Pan Am is determined to be a major player in the evolving
world-wide mega-carrier system,'' Plaskett told a luncheon of
aviation industry executives in New York. ``If it takes the form of
an infusion of capital from a foreign entity, we want to be free to
do it openly and without subterfuge...Our government needs to tell
us what the rules are in very clear terms.
   ``Certainly, it's time for our government to consider whether
there is still any valid national interest, other than the national
defense interest, which can be protected in retaining these foreign
ownership restrictions,'' Plaskett said.
   He declined to identify any possible foreign partners for Pan Am
or say whether the company still is actively pursuing other
strategies, including a possible bid for UAL or Texas Air's
Continental, which also may be sold.
   New York-based Pan Am is one of the oldest U.S. airlines and
became the first to operate a permanent international air service in
1927. It also helped pioneer routes to Europe, Asia and Latin
America, giving it the reputation as America's unofficial
flag-carrier overseas.
   But Pan Am has been battered over the past several years by tough
competition, labor tensions and other problem while competitors have
been aggressively expanding. It financial woes forced it to sell its
Latin American and Pacific routes, greatly shrinking its size.
   The airline lost $462 million in 1986, $265 million in 1987 and
$72.7 million in 1988. It has lost $158.8 million so far this year.

   Texas Air Corp. is paying $45 million worth of
Eastern Airlines pension fund obligations due Friday to help the
strikebound carrier save some cash.
   The payment by the parent company will be in the form of a loan
that Eastern lawyers said would be repayed during the airline's
bankruptcy reorganization.
   U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Burton R. Lifland approved a proposal
Wednesday for payment of $98.3 million to Eastern's seven employee
pension plans, including those of striking workers and salaried
employees.
   Eastern will pay just $27 million of the total and payment of the
remaining $26.3 million will be deferred until next July 1.
   ``It certainly is in everybody's best interest that the funding
of those plans is completely sourced,'' Lifland said.
   The plan was reached after discussions among Eastern, its
creditors committee and the Internal Revenue Service, which is
responsible for overseeing payments to pension funds.
   Lawyers for Eastern said the plan gives Eastern a break by
deferring some payment until later in the course of its Chapter 11
proceedings and transferring other payments to Texas Air.
   ``It saves Eastern a lot of cash during the Chapter 11 case,''
Eastern lawyer Bruce Zirinsky said.
   The $45 million to be paid by Texas Air will be held as a claim
on the Eastern estate that will be resolved as part of Eastern's
reorganization.
   The agreement was opposed by lawyers for the Air Line Pilots
Association and Eastern's preferred shareholders committee. Lawyers
for the shareholders said any cash outlay would hurt the airline,
while the pilots' lawyers wanted full payment into the funds.
   Of the total amount due, $78.4 million represents money owed for
pension plans ending last year and $19.9 million is for money due
under waivers granted by the IRS for previous plan years, Zirinsky
said.
   Eastern has been under Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection from
creditors since March 9, five days after its Machinists, pilots and
flight attendants walked off the job.
   The airline has been selling aircraft, routes and airport gates
to raise money to pay off its $2.3 billion debt. It gradually has
rebuilt as a smaller carrier under a reorganization plan filed in
July.
   Eastern officials recently disclosed to creditors that the
airline will have about $370 million less in cash by year end than
first projected, having abandoned a plan to sell its Latin American
routes.

   Congress is considering further restrictions on smoking,
including banning smoking on all domestic airline flights and
limiting cigarette sales through vending machines. Only Illinois,
Virginia, North Carolina, Tennessee, Alabama, Louisiana, Wyoming and
Missouri have no form of statewide smoking restrictions. Here are
some examples of regulations across the country:
</TEXT>
<NOTE>ALBUQUERQUE, N.M.</NOTE>
<TEXT>
   Albuquerque's anti-smoking ordinance went into effect April 19
and strictly limits smoking in most indoor public places, including
reception areas, stores, medical facilities, lobbies, and theaters.
Restaurants can set aside up to one-third of their indoor seating
for smokers.
   Private businesses must post and maintain a smoking policy. The
policies can ban smoking entirely or, at a minimum, prohibit smoking
in common work areas, elevators, restrooms and hallways.
   Several school districts instituted bans prohibiting employees
and students from smoking, chewing tobacco or having tobacco
products on school grounds.

<NOTE>NEW YORK</NOTE>
<TEXT>
   New York passed a sweeping state law to take effect next year
that prohibits smoking in public spaces such as auditoriums,
elevators, food stores, shared taxicabs and limousines. Smoking will
be restricted to certain areas in restaurants, hospitals, indoor
arenas, banks, and restrooms. Smoking in theaters, libraries, and
mass transit has long been prohibited.
   In the workplace, smoking will be prohibited at an employee's
request. Non-smoking areas will have to be provided in cafeterias
and lounges.
   The smoking law would not apply in bars, hotel rooms,
conventions, tobacco stores, and various private places, such as
homes and cars. Violators can be fined up to $1,000.
</TEXT>
<NOTE>PITTSBURGH</NOTE>
<TEXT>
   Pittsburgh's smoking ordinance, which went into effect last year,
forbids smoking in lobbies, hallways and restrooms and requires
employers to adopt policies guaranteeing a smoke-free environment
for non-smoking workers. Restaurants seating more than 50 people
must maintain no-smoking sections. Fines are $50.
</TEXT>
<NOTE>NEWPORT NEWS, Va.</NOTE>
<TEXT>
   In June, the Newport News City Council approved an ordinance
limiting smoking in stores, theaters, restaurants and other public
places. The ordinance passed in time to beat a state-wide one-year
moratorium on local no-smoking ordinances that apply to private
industry. Virginia state lawmakers, pressed by a tobacco industry
lobbying campaign, passed the moratorium after turning down a law to
restrict public smoking.
</TEXT>
<NOTE>TEXAS</NOTE>
<TEXT>
   A 1975 Texas law prohibits smoking in public schools, elevators,
theaters, libraries, museums, hospitals, and on some public
transportation. The maximum fine is $200. However, a loophole allows
designated smoking sections, which could theoretically include an
entire building.
   Many cities have more stringent restrictions that include
worksites.
   Austin has one of the most comprehensive smoking policies,
stipulating that smoking areas must be well ventilated and away from
common-use areas.
</TEXT>
<NOTE>MICHIGAN</NOTE>
<TEXT>
   Michigan restricts smoking to a designated area in all public
buildings as well as educational and health facilities, meeting
rooms, arena auditoriums, and theaters. That law took effect in 1987.
   Last year, the law was expanded to ban smoking in child-care
centers, require warnings on outdoor signs advertising smokeless
tobacco, and require ``food courts'' in shopping centers to set
aside non-smoking areas.
</TEXT>
<NOTE>KANSAS</NOTE>
<TEXT>
   Kansas requires public restaurants to set aside at least 50
percent of their seating for non-smoking areas; prohibits anyone
from smoking in school buildings used for classroom instruction; and
prohibits smoking in state buildings, except in specially designated
areas.
   In addition to state laws, there are many local ordinances.
Topeka, for example, bans smoking in retail stores.

   Supply problems, expired incentives and patient
consumers combined to torpedo early September sales of two
Japan-based companies' U.S. plants and drop car and truck sales 0.6
percent, the companies say.
   The eight major U.S. automakers on Wednesday reported that their
vehicle sales for Sept. 1-10 dropped to an average daily rate of
30,333 this year, compared with a rate of 30,522 during the same
time last year.
   Pulling down the year-to-year comparison were sluggish car sales
by Honda Motor Co. and car and light truck sales by Nissan Motor
Corp.
   Sales of Civics and Accords made at Honda's Marysville, Ohio,
plant sold at a rate 36 percent below last year's during the period.
And Nissan pickup truck and Sentra car sales fell 72.1 percent and
79.1 percent, respectively.
   Honda spokesman Jeff Leestma said few Civics were available
during the period because of a model changeover at the factory. He
also speculated consumers may be waiting to see the redesigned 1990
Honda Accord.
   Nissan spokesman E.C. Mueller said early September sales were
damaged by an incentive program that expired Sept. 5.
   ``There was a run on the vehicles at the end of August,'' he said.
   Auto dealers, as they do every year around this time, hold ``fire
sales'' to rid their lots of unsold cars to make way for the new
models rolling off assembly lines.
   Manufacturers also want to get rid of the cars, so they have
offered incentives to customers and their dealers, which drop the
price of the vehicle. Also, analysts have said some consumers appear
to be buying cars now rather than waiting for the new models and the
higher price tags they will carry.
   Ford Motor Co. was the only one of the Big Three to show declines
in car and truck sales during early September. The nation's No. 2
automaker reported vehicle sales at an average daily rate of 8,867
during the period this year, 8.3 percent behind last year's pace of
9,671. Car sales were off 6.6 percent and truck sales dropped 10.8
percent.
   For the year, Ford's car and truck sales were running 0.8 percent
behind last year's rate.
   General Motors Corp. reported a 1.7 percent increase in
early-September car sales and a 30.5 percent rise in truck sales for
a vehicle sales rate 10.8 percent higher during the period this year
than last year.
   So far this year, GM reported its car and truck sales were 4.6
percent behind last year's.
   Chrysler's early-September vehicle sales were mixed, with car
sales rising 6.7 percent and truck sales falling 8.3 percent.
Combined, Chrysler's vehicle sales were 0.6 percent below the
early-September rate last year.
   Chrysler car and truck sales through Sept. 10 of this year were
6.1 percent behind last year's rate.

<HEAD>Texas Instruments Reduces Group's Work Force</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DALLAS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Officials of Texas Instruments Inc. say 700
employees in the Defense Systems &amp; Electronics Group have
voluntarily chosen to leave the company.
   Because of the job reductions, severance pay and other costs, the
Dallas-based electronics giant will take a $10 million charge in its
current fiscal quarter, said TI spokesman Stan Victor.
   He said Wednesday the departures are in addition to 230 jobs
eliminated in the defense electronics group announced in August.
   Cuts were made to control expenses and to adjust to changes in
the defense group's business, Victor had said earlier. Older defense
programs are being replaced with newer programs that require less
metal, he said.
   Although Texas Instruments takes the multimillion-dollar charge
against profits in the current quarter, ``this reduction will lower
costs in this group on a look-forward basis,'' the company said in a
statement.
   By this month's end, the combination of voluntary and involuntary
job cuts will reduce employment in the Defense Systems &amp; Electronics
Group to roughly 23,000 workers.
   The company said in January it planned to cut its nationwide work
force by up to 1,000, including up to 700 employees in North Texas
in a voluntary termination and retirement program.
   Demand from makers of electronic equipment is slowing for memory
chips, at the same time competitors are increasing their production
of such chips, the company said.

<HEAD>Ex-Director of NY Fed Sentenced to Six Months for Data Leak</HEAD>

<DATELINE>NEWARK, N.J. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Robert A. Rough's banking career started at
age 14, when he worked as a runner for a bank in Paterson, N.J.
   After college came a stint as an auditor at the Federal Reserve
Bank of New York, where he returned 20 years later _ president of
his own bank _ to join the board of directors at the institution,
where many of his young colleagues from the 1960s were now senior
officials.
   On Wednesday, Rough was sent to jail, his career finished, his
money gone.
   U.S. District Judge Dickinson R. Debevoise sentenced him to six
months in prison Wednesday for leaking secret interest rate data
while on the New York Fed's board. Debevoise also ordered the
50-year-old ex-banker to perform 200 hours of community service
during two years of probation.
   ``I am an outcast in the banking community and my own
community,'' Rough told the judge in emotionally choked tones.
``These past few years have been truly a living hell.''
   Debevoise called the case ``particularly sad'' and said he was
convinced that Rough's anguished remorse ``came from the heart.''
   But he said jail time for Rough was ``essential for the public
perception of the fairness of the system'' _ that white collar
criminals, and those with advantaged backgrounds, be properly
punished.
   ``I breached a trust placed in me, and in doing so, blemished the
reputation of the institution I still revere,'' said Rough, his
voice quavering.
   He said a picture of former Federal Reserve Bank chairman Paul
Volker remains hanging on his wall. The Federal Reserve Bank of New
York is part of the Fed's regional system.
   Rough sat on the New York Fed's board from 1982 to 1984 while
president of the National Bank of Sussex County in Branchville, N.J.
While there, Rough admitted in a plea bargain, he regularly
disclosed advance word regarding the Fed's discount rate to a
now-defunct Livingston, N.J.-based brokerage firm, Bevill, Bresler &amp;
Schulman Inc.
   Bevill, Bresler traded in government securities, part of a market
that is powerfully affected by the discount rate.
   The case was the first to involve insider trading of government
securities, and marked the first such charges against a director in
the Fed system, federal officials said.
   Rough could have received up to five years in prison. But in an
unusual move, the U.S. attorney's office recommended that if Rough
was sent to prison, it should be for less than a year.
   Assistant U.S. Attorney Paul Weissman, in a pre-sentencing memo,
said Rough expected no financial gain.
   Debevoise agreed to recommend that Rough serve his sentence,
beginning Oct. 16, at Eglin Air Force Base in Florida, a minimum
security prison camp. Rough's attorney, Michael Himmel, who had
asked for probation, said his client would probably serve about 4{
months, gaining early release for good time.
   Rough's career as a prosperous ``country banker'' who once
aspired to be chairman of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation
began to unravel in the spring of 1987, when witnesses at the trial
of Bevill, Bresler president Gilbert C. Schulman disclosed the
allegations.
   Rough usually leaked the data to Schulman, and blamed his actions
on a misguided friendship with the Bevill, Bresler official.
Schulman and four other top executives of the firm were sent to
prison in connection with its April 1985 collapse.

<HEAD>Alaskan Spill Exonerated in Gas Pricing Probe</HEAD>

<BYLINE>By DAVID AMMONS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Political Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>OLYMPIA, Wash. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Skyrocketing gasoline prices that followed
the Exxon Valdex oil spill in Alaska can't be pinned on that
disaster, a Washington state probe has concluded.
   As 11 million gallons of Alaskan crude from the supertanker that
ran aground on March 24 coated Alaska's Prince William Sound, gas
prices were soaring by 20 cents or more per gallon at service
stations across the nation.
   But the price hikes already were in the works before the spill
because of a complicated series of production and market factors,
Attorney General Ken Eikenberry said Wednesday.
   America's worst oil spill had a brief impact on U.S. refinery
supplies, particularly in the West, but not enough to be considered
a major factor in the price hikes, Eikenberry's anti-trust division
said in a detailed report on its six-month probe.
   Investigators said they discovered no evidence of collusion among
the Big Oil companies but neither could they disprove such a
possibility. Any further investigation should be done at the federal
level, said Eikenberry.
   As chairman of the Task Force on Gasoline Over-Pricing of the
nation's attorneys general, he has asked the Justice Department and
the Federal Trade Commission to investigate.
   Washington, Oregon, California and Arizona already are in federal
court over alleged gasoline price-fixing and contrived shortages in
the early 1970s.
   ``Already angered about the environmental consequences of the oil
spill, consumers demanded explanations for the price increases,''
the report said.
   ``Many felt that the increases added insult to injury and that
the spill was being used as an excuse to raise prices. Additionally
some were concerned that by paying higher prices, consumers would be
paying for the cost of cleaning up the spill.''
   The investigators, who grilled the oil industry, conducted
hearings and did their own analysis of economic information,
concluded that the oil spill had only ``minimal and temporary''
impact on gasoline supply.
   ``The Exxon Valdez did not cause the price increase,'' Assistant
Attorney General Tina Kondo told a news conference. ``Prices went up
all over the country, even in places that don't depend on Alaskan
crude.''
   The spill caused ``a sharp one-week dip in gasoline production on
the West Coast (but) it was quickly rectified and should have had
little long-term impact,'' the report said.
   Other factors ``already had created a volatile supply
situation,'' said the report prepared by Kondo and investigator
Larry Little:
   _ Crude oil prices had been surging, squeezing refineries'
profits and adding to pressure to boost prices. Between last
November and May, OPEC boosted prices between $7 and $8 a barrel _
or between 16 and 19 cents a gallon of gas. Initially, retailers
absorbed some of the cost, with refiners getting the lion's share of
the higher pump prices, the report said.
   _ West Coast refineries had both scheduled and unexpected
shutdowns. ARCO's Ferndale, Wash., refinery was down between April 5
and mid-May. Chevron's fire at its Richmond Beach, Calif., refinery
on April 10 cut production by 25 percent for more than a month.
Exxon's Benicia, Calif., scheduled maintenance, losing half its
production. Texaco had an emergency shutdown at its Anacortes,
Wash., refinery on Feb. 2, curtailing production until the end of
March.
   _ Demand for gas was increasing but inventories were abnormally
low. Texaco and ARCO customers reported outages before the spill.
Chevron and ARCO bought expensive oil on the spot market to try to
fill the gap.
   _ Uncertainly over the long-term effects of the spill and a major
explosion at Shell's Cormorant Alpha oil platform in the North Sea
boosted prices on the world crude and spot markets.
   _ Stricter environmental regulations took effect on June 1, 1989.
Oil companies have estimated that anti-air pollution laws will cost
an extra 1 to 3 cents per gallon.
   The Alaska spill may have had an indirect ``catalyst'' effect,
the report said.

<HEAD>Fast Foord Firm, Immigration Authorities Reach Agreement on Aliens</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW ORLEANS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An unprecedented accord will require Church's
Fried Chicken Inc. to pay immigration authorities $80,700 in fines
for hiring unauthorized aliens, the U.S. Justice Department said.
   In return, the U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service will
not pursue a nationwide investigation and will give Popeyes Famous
Fried Chicken Inc. a chance to correct improper hiring practices by
the fast-food rival it acquired last February.
   The Justice Department said it was the first agreement of its
kind since the November 1986 enactment of federal legislation
prohibiting the hiring of unauthorized aliens. It said the agreement
was signed Wednesday in Washington, D.C.
   All of Church's 798 company-owned outlets and the company's
corporate office in San Antonio, Texas, is covered by the agreement,
the Justice Department said.
   Under its terms, the INS' New Orleans district will fine the
corporate headquarters and each outlet $500, but will accept a
settlement of $100 from each, the Justice Department said. That
amounts to a total fine of $403,000 and a settlement payment of
$80,700, it said.
   The acquisition of Church's by Popeyes was a consideration in the
settlement, said INS District Director John B.Z. Caplinger.
   ``Popeyes is an international, New Orleans-based firm which has
strongly supported the legislation prohibiting the employment of
unauthorized alien labor,'' Caplinger said.
   ``The positive support provided by us by Popeyes during our
investigation, and our trust in the ability of Popeyes to correct
the problems at its new Church's outlets, led to this nationwide
agreement,'' he said.
   The apprehension of some unauthorized alien workers at Church's
outlets in Baton Rouge last fall triggered an investigation into
whether Church's was complying with the Immigration Reform and
Control Act of 1986, the Justice Department said.
   The act forbids U.S. employers to hire unauthorized alien
workers, and also requires them to complete am I-9 form verifying
the identities and employment eligibility of all employees, even
U.S. citizens, the Justice Department said.
   Numerous record-keeping violations, including missing and
improperly completed i-9 forms, were found in a subsequent
investigation of 97 Church's outlets and 2,900 employees in
Louisiana, Mississippi and Texas, the Justice Department said.
   As a result of those violations, it said, the INS proposed a fine
of more than $620,000 but accepted payment of $50,000 from Church's
last July.
   ``The investigation indicated the Church's problem was nationwide
in scope but, by the time of the first settlement covering those 97
stores, Popeyes had bought Church's,'' Caplinger said.
   ``In light of the positive support by Popeyes Human Resources
Director Charles Dilapi and his staff, we felt that, rather than
initiating a nationwide investigation of Church's, we would initiate
a nationwide settlement which gives Popeyes the opportunity to
install new procedures and provide training which will, we are
confident, correct the problem,'' he said.
   He said the agreement covers violations which occurred prior to
June 1, 1989. It gives Church's a 120-period, from Aug. 1 to Nov.
28, to correct those violations, Caplinger said.
   Also, he said, the INS agreed not to issue any new fines during
the 120-day period and Church's agreed to terminate any unauthorized
workers it might find in the process of correcting violations.
   Church's also would be subject to fines for any uncorrected or
new violations after Nov. 28, Caplinger said.

<HEAD>Circle K Directors to End Acquisition Solicitation</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PHOENIX (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Circle K Corp. says it will stop looking for a
buyer and concentrate on strengthening the company's
convenience-store operations.
   The Phoenix-based company's board of directors announced the
decision on Wednesday, reacting to a recommendation from a
board-appointed advisory committee.
   Several parties had expressed interest in acquiring the company,
but no proposals were received by the bidding deadline, Circle K
said in a prepared release.
   The board was told by Wasserstein Perella &amp; Co. Inc., hired in
February as financial advisors to the committee, that a successful
leveraged transaction wasn't likely under current market and
operating conditions.
   The firm noted that an unsuccessful attempt might have an adverse
affect on the company.
   The board cited a weak securities market and the thin operating
margins of convenience stores as reasons for its decision to stop
seeking acquisition proposals. It also decided against a financial
restructuring and instructed management to devote its efforts to
strengthening and improving the company's existing operations.
   Circle K already has disposed of most of its non-store-related
businesses and currently owns only about 12 percent of its 4,680
stores. The rest have been sold or leased back.
   Aggressive expansion had left Circle K with a heavy debt load.
Circle K in June reported a $23.1 million fourth-quarter loss on
revenue of $931.2 million.
   The board on Wednesday also set Oct. 16 as the record date for
the annual shareholders' meeting to be held on Nov. 21 and decided
not to declare a dividend on the company's common stock for the
current quarter. It did declare a $2 per share dividend on certain
shares of a preferred stock payable on Sept. 28, company officials
said.
   ``It is my understanding that there is no comment being made,''
on the board's actions, said Bonnie Briglia, Circle K chairman Karl
Eller's personal secretary, when Eller was called for comment.
   Eller indicated interest in May in a leveraged buyout. In a
leveraged buyout the acquisition is financed through high yielding
bonds, or loans that are repaid with earnings or by a sale of assets.
   At that time, analysts speculated that Eller's interest was
intended to spur a sense of urgency among possible outside buyers.

<HEAD>New Escort and Tracer Program Costing Ford $1.5 Billion</HEAD>

<DATELINE>DEARBORN, Mich. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The next generation of Ford Escort and
Mercury Tracer subcompact cars will cost Ford Motor Co. $1.5 billion
to develop, more than half of it going into two plants, one in
Mexico.
   The investment is part of a production switch scheduled for next
year to clear the way for a new sport-utility truck.
   Escorts and Tracers will be made in the Detroit suburb of Wayne
and in Hermosillo, Mexico, where they currently are assembled,
company executives said Wednesday. The Escort plant in Edison, N.J.,
will be switched to making Ranger light pickup trucks, which now are
assembled in Louisville, Ky.
   The Louisville plant will be the source of the Explorer, a
two-and four-door sport utility vehicle that replaces the Bronco II.
   All the new vehicles will be introduced in the spring and in
dealer showrooms later.
   ``With an investment of this size, Ford is making a clear
commitment to maintain small car production and sales leadership in
North America,'' Alex Trotman, Ford's executive vice president for
North American Automotive Operations, said during the introduction
of Ford's 1990 lineup of cars and light trucks.
   He said about $600 million will be invested at the Wayne plant
and about $260 million at the Mexican plant. The remaining $640
million will be spent at Ford component plants, for retooling
suppliers and in other Ford divisions linked to the new Escort and
Tracer program.
   The company also said it will spend about $285 million at the
Edison factory to prepare for truck production.
   The subcompact market for much of this year has been weaker than
last year. Through August, sales of subcompacts have slipped 6.2
percent from last year's level to 649,311 cars.
   To avoid swelling dealer inventories too much, Ford shut down its
Wayne and Edison plants for a week or two several times in the last
four months. The Escort was the best-selling car last year, with
387,815 of the cars driven off dealer lots.
   Cars have been assembled at the Edison plant since 1948, and
about 119,000 Escorts were made there last year. The plant has an
assembly line rate of 37{ cars an hour on two shifts.
   By contrast, Ford assembled about 296,000 Escorts at the Wayne
plant west of Detroit last year. Its line speed is 68{ cars an hour,
also on two shifts.
   Ranger pickups currently are made at Ford's Louisville assembly
plant at a rate of 37{ an hour, coincidentally the same rate as the
Edison plant. That factory will begin producing the Ford Explorer
sport-utility vehicle, which will replace the Bronco II, when Ranger
production is moved to New Jersey.
   Ford spokesman Jay Meisenhelder said he didn't know when the
Edison plant would stop production to retool and to retrain workers
to make the pickup. About 1,600 people work there.
   The new generation of Escort and Tracer will be introduced in the
spring as a 1991 model. Ford executives declined to talk about
details of the car at the 1990 models' introduction Wednesday.
   Ford is making few large-scale changes for the 1990 model year.

   Air France ordered five 747-400 Freighter aircraft
for $600 million, Boeing Commercial Airplanes announced.
   With Wednesday's order, Air France became the first airline to
buy the cargo version of the firm's latest new-technology airplane.
The passenger version of the 747-400 is now in service with nine
airlines.
   The first of the five freighters ordered by Air France will be
delivered in August 1993. The order was the biggest all-cargo order
ever received by Boeing.
   Ten other airlines, including Cargolux of Luxembourg, Cathay
Pacific, Japan Airlines and UTA of France, have been discussing with
Boeing the possibility of buying the 747-400F.
   The 747-400F is distinguished from the 747-200F by wider
wingspan, six-foot-high winglets on the ends of the wings, and the
capacity to carry 44,000 pounds more payload.
   The flight deck is greatly changed, with digital systems
replacing analog equipment and the two-person crew monitoring flight
progress on six video display terminals.
   The order brings to 217 the total orders for 747-400 aircraft.
Boeing this year has taken orders for 702 airplanes in all models,
with a combined value of $37.5 billion.

   Singer Michael Jackson joined the ranks of
celebrities promoting signature-model sneakers in a deal reportedly
worth about $20 million.
   Beside plugging shoes, apparel and accessories for L.A. Gear, the
pop superstar will also design a line of sporty products bearing his
name, it was announced Wednesday.
   ``I'm very happy to be a part of the L.A. Gear magic, and I hope
we have a very rewarding, successful career,'' the singer said at a
news conference.
   The deal slated to last about two years will pay Jackson more
than $20 million, according to a source close to the negotiations
who asked not to be identified.
   Jackson accepted a new pair of sneakers from an L.A. Gear
representative and smiled at a horde of photographers at the news
conference staged at the Hollywood Palladium to resemble a rock 'n'
roll concert.
   He refused to answer any questions.
   The superstar performer who announced earlier this year that he
wouldn't perform in concert again, will have a very ``hands-on''
relationship with the shoe manufacturer, according L.A. Gear
executive vice president Sandy Saemann.
   Saemann said Jackson will ``create, design and market a signature
line of fashionable and technical athletic footwear.''
   ``In the five or six times I've been with Michael, he's given us
two to three phenomenal ideas for footwear,'' Saemann said.
   The first of the Jackson-inspired shoes, clothing and watches is
set to debut in 1990.
   Saemann said that the agreement is ``probably the largest
corporate association ever reached between a company and a
celebrity.'' He would only say that it exceeded $10 million, the
amount Pepsi paid Jackson to promote the soft drink for the past
three years.
   While refusing to release specifics, Saemann said that Jackson's
arrangement also included an undisclosed share of L.A. Gear's
profits.
   Jackson becomes the latest in a series of celebrities to plug
athletic footwear. Nike Inc. already uses baseball and football star
Bo Jackson, tennis player John McEnroe and hockey's Wayne Gretzky to
hawk sneakers; Reebok International Inc. has sponsored rock concerts.
   With sales estimated by L.A. Gear to reach $1 billion in 1990,
the suburban Mar Vista-based company is the nation's No. 3 athletic
shoe maker, trailing Reebok and Nike. The company reported sales of
$235.6 million for the first six months of 1989.
   L.A. Gear's current celebrity spokesman is Kareem Abdul-Jabbar,
the retired center of the Los Angeles Lakers.

<HEAD>Ueberroth to Take Stake in Adidas USA</HEAD>
<DATELINE>FRANKFURT, West Germany (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Peter Ueberroth, former U.S.
baseball commissioner and organizer of the 1984 Los Angeles
Olympics, will take a stake in Adidas USA, the American subsidiary
of the West German sports shoe and clothing company, Adidas says.
   Adidas AG supervisory board chairman, Rene C. Jaeggi, said the
company was planning a new strategy to overcome losses on the
important U.S. market.
   Jaeggi said in a statement released Wednesday that Adidas USA
sales for 1989 were expected to top $400 million, about 4 percent to
5 percent down from 1988.
   Ueberroth has an option for a ``substantial'' stake in Adidas
USA, but it remains under 50 percent, Jaeggi said.
   He also holds an option for a stake in Adidas AG, the parent
company, but this remains ``well below 25 percent.'' The Dassler
family will retain its majority holding in Adidas AG, the company
said. Adidas AG is based in Herzogenaurach.
   Ueberroth will also become a board member of both Adidas USA and
Adidas AG, but will not take part in day-to-day running of the
companies, Jaeggi said.
   Ueberroth has already taken a stake in Le Coq Sportif, Pony and
Arena, three Adidas subsidiaries in the United States.
   Adidas was planning to raise its capital, now at about $60
million, by the end of the year, but had no plans to go to the stock
market, the company said.
   Jaeggi attributed the projected 1989 losses in the United States
primarily to distribution problems, as well as greater competition
from American and Japanese sports goods companies.

   The stock market declined broadly today in a
carryover of selling from Wednesday afternoon.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials dropped 8.55 to 2,670.97
in the first half hour of trading.
   Losers outnumbered gainers by more than 2 to 1 in nationwide
trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 294 up, 633
down and 544 unchanged.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 23.55 million shares as of 10
a.m. on Wall Street.
   Analysts said the market remained unsettled by recent pressure on
the market for high-yield ``junk'' bonds of companies carrying large
debt loads.
   The worries focused on the problems of Campeau Corp., which is in
the process of trying to restructure its retailing empire to keep up
with its debt obligations.
   Brokers also noted that traders were proceeding cautiously in
advance of the quarterly ``triple witching hour'' involving a series
of expiring stock-index options and futures.
   The government reported this morning that retail sales increased
0.7 percent in August, slightly below most advance estimates. The
news provided some support for U.S. Treasury securities, nudging
interest rates a bit lower in that sector of the credit markets.
   Circle K Corp. led the active list, down [ at 7|. The stock fell
1} Wednesday, when the company said it had ended efforts to solicit
takeover offers and suspended its dividend.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks fell
.44 to 191.85. At the American Stock Exchange, the market value
index was down .43 at 383.34.
   On Wednesday the Dow Jones industrial average fell 27.74 points
to 2,679.52.
   Declining issues outnumbered advances by about 5 to 3 on the

<HEAD>BP Announces Restructuring; Cutting More Than 1,700 Jobs</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By COTTEN TIMBERLAKE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   British Petroleum Co. PLC today announced a major
restructuring to focus on ``higher-risk, higher-reward''
exploration, a move which involves the sale of assets worth $1.3
billion and the slashing of more than 1,700 jobs.
   BP, the world's fourth largest oil company, said it has agreed to
sell 9 percent of its British North Sea exploration assets, as well
as assets in six other countries to Oryx Energy Co., one of the
largest independent oil and gas producers in the United States.
   The North Sea assets include four oil and gas-producing fields,
five prospective developments and 42 unexplored blocks.
   The job cuts would represent 17 percent of London-based BP's work
force of about 10,000.
   ``We have to get into a position where our assets are working
most efficiently,'' John Browne, chief executive officer of BP
Exploration, told a news conference.
   ``We haven't taken the meat-axe to the company. We're preparing
not only for today but also for tomorrow,'' he said.``We're shifting
our focus to ensure that we put enough money into frontier
exploration.''
   The proceeds from the sale would allow the company to invest in
areas it considers to have more potential _ Vietnam, Ethiopia, the
Gulf of Mexico and the western margins of the British continental
shelf, Browne said.
   The sale package includes assets in Ecuador, Gabon, Dubai, Italy,
Colombia and Indonesia.
   Oryx Energy, based in Dallas, was formed when Sun Oil of the
United States spun off its U.S. exploration and production business
as the Sun Exploration and Production Co. in November 1988. It was
renamed in May 1989.
   ``There will be more asset disposals. If exploration turns up
something that would be more useful to someone else, we'll sell
it,'' Browne said.
   The move follows BP's $4.4 billion acquisition of Britoil PLC
last year. BP purchased the 45 percent of Standard Oil Co. of Ohio
it didn't already own for $7.9 billion in 1987.
   BP might be raising cash to retire debt and to build up a war
chest for another major takeover, perhaps of an American company,
analysts have speculated.
   In May, BP agreed to sell its mineral interests to the British
mining group RTZ Corp. for $6.5 billion. BP also is planning to sell
its coal business later in the year for an undisclosed amount.
   The streamlining should reduce overhead by more than $150 million
a year, BP said.
   The company said many of the job losses would be achieved through
early retirement and voluntary departures but it could not rule out
layoffs.
   The company said it would cut 970 jobs in Scotland, two-thirds of
them in Aberdeen, and the rest in Glasgow. Another 470 jobs are to
be cut at BP's London offices and 280 at BP's offices in Houston,
Texas.
   BP Exploration is being reorganized into three regional operating
companies, and international technology division and a global gas
unit. These will come under the overall direction of a small
headquarters in new offices in London.
   Browne said, ``The need for change is compelling. We face rising
taxes, higher running costs and more onerous regulations worldwide.
   ``We are also aware that we must be leaders in responsible
environment protection and that there are lessons to be learned
about promoting the health and safety of our work force.
   ``All these factors are driving up costs and putting margins
under severe pressure.''
   The restructuring announcement comes one week after BP announced
that deputy chairman Robert Horton, 50, would become chairman of the
oil giant in March replacing Sir Peter Walters, who is retiring at
age 59.

   Rolls-Royce PLC plans to move the offices
of its U.S. subsidiary from Greenwich to Reston, Va., a move company
officials said will allow the British jet-engine giant to take
advantage of the Washington, D.C., aerospace market.
   Company officials said Wednesday that Rolls-Royce will move its
U.S. headquarters to Reston, about 20 miles west of the nation's
capital, next summer. It plans to set up shop for its U.S.
commercial-engine operation in Reston next week, officials said.
   Rolls-Royce's military-engine operation is already based in
downtown Washington.
   Robert Stangarone, vice president of Rolls-Royce Inc., the
American subsidiary, said the Washington area has become a
``formidable location aerospace industry.''
   ``It's become the center of our business activities,'' Stangarone
said.
   Several European aircraft builders, among them Airbus Industrie
and British Aerospace, have based their American operations in the
corridor between Washington and the Dulles Internationl Airport in
the Virginia suburbs.
   Airbus North America, for instance, moved from New York to
Herndon, Va., two years ago. Virginia is also home ot numerous
aerospace industry trade groups.
   Rolls-Royce Inc. accounts for a third of its parent company's $4
billion in world aircraft-engine sales. Rolls is the third-largest
engine maker, after General Electric and Pratt &amp; Whitney.
   Rolls-Royce Inc. moved its U.S. headquarters from New York to
Greenwich in 1984. Its home office employs about 30 people,
including Alan D.F. Smith, president and chief executive officer.
   Barry Eccleston, senior vice president for commercial marketing
at Rolls-Royce Inc., said being closer to Washington, home of the
U.S. military and many American airlines, should help Rolls capture
a greater share of the growing U.S. jet-engine market.
   Rolls-Royce Inc. employs about 400 people across the United
States. It builds engines for the U.S. Navy's T-54 trainer jet
fighter, the Marine Corp's AV-8B Harrier and other aircraft. It also
supplies engines to American Airlines, TWA and several other U.S.
carriers.
   While still trailing General Electric Co. and Pratt &amp; Whitney,
Rolls captured 22 percent of North American jet-engine orders in the
first half of this year, Eccleston said. He said Rolls has targeted
30 percent of the overall engine market by 1995.

<HEAD>S&amp;L Bailout Making Subtle Changes For Consumers</HEAD>
<HEAD>LaserGraphics planned</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By VIVIAN MARINO</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   The costly thrift-rescue plan, which promises a sweeping
restructuring of the U.S. financial system over the next three
decades, already has brought subtle changes to the lives of many
Americans since its enactment a month ago.
   Those high-interest CDs peddled by some desperate thrifts to
attract depositors are getting harder to find, and some experts say
they eventually could disappear. Real estate auctioneers are
maneuvering to grab a piece of what easily will be the biggest
distressed property sale in history.
   More serious consequences could loom as the number of thrifts
decline, lessening competition. Homebuyers, for example, may find
themselves priced out of the mortgage market, which historically has
been the main business of the savings &amp; loan industry.
   The quiet changes unfolding so far partly reflect a slow-moving
bureaucracy, a relatively stable economy and widespread
misunderstanding or apathy about the law and what it means. Many
thrift executives say their customers don't realize a new era has
begun.
   ``In the general sense the bailout has been a non-event,'' said
Marion O. Sandler, president of Golden West Financial Corp., parent
of World Savings and Loan Association in Oakland, Calif. ``The
customers aren't talking about it. The branches (were) all prepared
to answer questions after the bill was signed and no one did.''
   One of the most visible signs of the legislation has been the
government's new insurance logotype emblazoned on the windows of all
federally insured institutions.
   It states deposits of up to $100,000 remain backed by Uncle Sam.
But even that could change: A congressional task force is exploring
changes in this guarantee and could recommend lowering it.
   ``It's difficult to say what will happen. He who uses a crystal
ball always winds up eating glass,'' cautions L. William Seidman,
chairman of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. and charged with
overseeing the S&amp;L rescue operation.
   ``The taxpayer is the upfront loser. He's going to be paying
about $1,000 a year for someone else's mistakes. (But) I think the
financial system will be much more stable and more efficient with
the law in place.''
   Signed by President Bush on Aug. 9, the law authorizes the
spending of about $300 billion to close or sell hundreds of
insolvent savings and loans over the next 30 years, with taxpayers
picking up 75 percent of the tab.
   By the end of this year, regulators are supposed to inject at
least $20 billion into the industry to stabilize it against
continuing losses.
   The law also creates a new federal agency to oversee the
operation, the Resolution Trust Corp., which will, among other
things, dispose of thousands of repossessed properties the
government will inherit from sick S&amp;Ls.
   The government already has at least $100 billion in assets from
the thrifts it has shut down, with about half of that in commercial
real estate. Experts say the property assets could total as high as
$400 billion.
   Some have expressed concern that the real estate industry,
already hurt by the deflation of the 1980s, might feel more pressure
as regulators unload that property, either by auction or to private
parties.
   Others say that's unlikely. ``Let's say you have $100 billion of
property. If you were to auction $10 million a day seven days a
week, without taking off for holidays, it would take 28 years,''
says Jim Gall, president of Miami-based Auction Company of America,
one of the many auctioneers hoping to participate in the bailout
action.
   Seidman maintains the government is aware of the delicacy of the
situation. ``We'll approach this the way porcupines make love _ very
carefully,'' he says.
   Included in the law are business guidelines that could ultimately
affect consumer services, experts say. For instance, thrifts are
required to raise capital levels, and to do that many will have to
shrink in size, experts say.
   Another requirement is that thrifts maintain about 70 percent of
their assets in investments linked to mortgages. ``As a result, they
may stop offering car loans or personal loans. They may even give up
credit cards,'' said Robert K. Heady, publisher of Bank Rate
Monitor, a weekly report on financial rates.
   Seidman predicts that in the next five years the number of S&amp;Ls
will drop to around 1,500 from 2,600.
   Analysts say fewer thrifts may mean less competition for things
like mortgage loans, and that could mean higher rates, although
mortgage companies could fill that void.
   Some thrift depositors already have had to deal with less
attractive rates. As the government works to close insolvent S&amp;Ls _
at a rate of between three or four a week, according to Seidman _
the deposit accounts of those institutions are often sold to healthy
ones. The above-market interest customers of the problem thrifts had
been receiving are therefore no longer available.
   Many ailing thrifts, particularly those in Texas, had offered
cheap rates on mortgages and higher rates on savings as part of a
struggle to gain more customers.
   To remain competitive, some healthy institutions attempted to
match those rates. All that was a bonanza to venturesome depositors,
who couldn't lose because federal deposit insurance guaranteed their
money was safe.
   Some experts predict that as more problem thrifts are
restructured or taken over by healthy S&amp;Ls or banks, bargain rates
will disappear.
   That already has happened to some degree in Texas, where the
industry has been especially stressed due to a collapse in the oil
and real estate markets there earlier this decade.
   Two years ago, Texas thrifts offered about three quarters of the
top 100 highest yields on deposits and today they make up only 3
percent, according to Heady.
   Even more significant, Heady said, is that the difference between
yields offered by thrifts vs. banks has been narrowing. When the
bailout bill was signed into law, thrift yields were nearly a half
percentage point higher than bank yields, but that has narrowed to
less than a quarter of a percentage point, he said.
   But for now overall deposit rates actually have risen since
enactment of the bailout, due largely to a better-than-expected
economic picture, analysts say.
   According to Bank Rate Monitor, the nationwide average rate on
money market accounts was unchanged from Aug. 9 to Sept. 6 at 6.26
percent, while rates on one-year CDs were up nearly a quarter
percentage point over that period at 7.97 percent.

   Here are some facts consumers should know about the new savings
and loan bailout plan, which President Bush signed into law Aug. 9:
   _All deposits up to $100,000 are protected per institution even
if a thrift has been seized by the federal government.
   _If you have more than $100,000 in an institution seized by the
federal government, the excess portion may also be protected
provided it's held in joint accounts with a member of the immediate
family.
   _Individual Retirement Accounts are insured separately from other
accounts, also at up to $100,000.
   _The principal on your certificate of deposit is insured up to
$100,000 but the rate isn't guaranteed. If your thrift is sold to a
healthy institution the rate on the CD might be lowered.
   _If your thrift is sold you'll generally have to wait only a few
days to get your federally insured deposits up to $100,000. If you
have more than $100,000 you must file a legal claim to it, just like
any other creditor.

<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Grain and soybean futures prices were mostly
higher this morning on the Chicago Board of Trade, struggling to
recover from the steep losses of the previous session.
   Prices had fallen sharply Wednesday amid speculation that the
Agriculture Department would take measures to increase wheat acreage
and boost supplies.
   Today's early gains were underpinned in part by confirmation of a
sale of 140,000 metric tons of wheat Wednesday to the Philippines at
subsidized prices, and by a report that poor yields would force the
Soviet Union to buy 40 million metric tons of grain from the world
market in the coming year.
   That report was offset, though by another report quoting Oleg
Klimov, head of the Soviet grain-buying agency, as saying the
Soviets had completed their grain buying for this year.
   Further buying was linked to a pair of National Weather Service
forecasts _ a six-to-10 day outlook and 30-day outlook _ predicting
continued wet weather for the western Corn Belt through mid-October,
which could hamper the corn and soybean harvest.
   In early trading, wheat futures were 1 cent to 2 cents higher
with the contract for delivery in September at $3.87 a bushel; corn
was \ cent lower to } cent higher with September at $2.33{ a bushel;
oats were unchanged to } cent higher with September at $1.34 a
bushel; and soybeans were 2 cents lower to { cent higher with
September at $5.87 a bushel.
   Livestock and meat futures were higher in early trading on the
Chicago Mercantile Exchange, with frozen pork belly futures locked
up the 2-cents-a-pound daily limit following Wednesday's statement
by a Bush administration official that the odds were very good that
the United States would include pork bellies in a food-aid package
to Poland.
   Live cattle futures were .18 cent to .65 cent higher with October
at 72.62 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .10 cent to .28 cent
higher with September at 83.15 cents a pound; hogs were .13 cent to
.70 cent higher with October at 40.45 cents a pound; and frozen pork
bellies were 2 cents higher across the board with February at 48.05
cents a pound.
   Cattle futures settled higher on Wednesday while pork futures
were mixed.

   Retail and real estate holding company Campeau Corp. remained in
an uncertain financial position today as discussions continued on a
definitive plan to borrow money from a major stockholder.
   Campeau spokeswoman Carol Sanger declined to comment on the
status of the talks.
   Meanwhile, trading in Campeau stock remained halted today on the
Toronto Stock Exchange pending an announcement from the company.
Sanger couldn't say when the company would issue any news, besides
its second-quarter financial results which were released today. The
stock had been halted Wednesday.
   Campeau reported it lost $124 million in the three months ended
July 31 on revenue of $2.26 billion, compared to a loss of $109
million and revenue of $2.21 billion a year earlier.
   Campeau's Allied Stores Corp. and Federated Department Stores
Inc. units _ both facing credit squeezes as they stock up inventory
ahead of Christmas _ said Wednesday there was no guarantee that
Campeau could obtain financing in time to meet debt repayment
deadlines.
   The news sent Allied and Federated high-yield junk bonds
plummeting Wednesday by as much as 15 points, or $150 per $1,000 in
face value. The bonds were moderately lower in early trading today,
slipping another $10 to $20 per $1,000 to yield in excess of 20
percent, although few bonds were changing hands.
   Allied and Federated also indicated that control of their
corporate parent could change hands after a definitive agreement is
reached with Olympia &amp; York Developments Ltd., which has agreed in
principle to lend Campeau $250 million.
   ``Certain elements of the agreement in principle with Olympia &amp;
York might be deemed to constitute a change in control of Campeau
...,'' Allied and Federated said in quarterly documents submitted to
the Securities and Exchange Commission that were made public
Wednesday.
   A Campeau spokeswoman said discussions were in progress and
details of the loan agreement with Olympia &amp; York wouldn't be
released until it was definitive.
   It has been widely assumed that Olympia &amp; York, which has a 24.5
stake in Campeau, would gain a larger interest in Campeau in
exchange for granting the loan. There has been speculation that
Chairman Robert Campeau, who owns nearly 54 percent of the
Toronto-based company, would relinquish controlling interest.
   Campeau, trying to cope with a debt load approaching $10 billion,
late Tuesday said its board of directors approved a plan, in
principle, under which Olympia &amp; York would loan it $250 million to
cover working capital needs at Allied and Federated.
   The board also authorized Campeau's intention to sell the
16-store Bloomingdale's department store chain, which is part of
Federated.
   Two potential bidders have confirmed their interest in
Bloomingdale's: Marvin S. Traub, the chain's chairman and chief
executive officer; and Crown American Corp., one of the country's
leading developers of shopping malls.
   Certain unspecified lender and creditor concurrences are required
before Campeau enters a definitive pact with Olympia &amp; York, Campeau
said Tuesday, noting that there was no assurance of getting the
concurrences.
   Campeau is facing a Friday deadline to secure financing
arrangements that Federated needs to buy back $400 million of notes
held by three underwriters.
   The lenders, First Boston Corp., PaineWebber Inc. and Dillon Read
&amp; Co., had agreed to hold the notes until Dec. 1 provided certain
conditions were met, including a condition that the financing
commitments to repurchase the notes were obtained by Friday.
   If Campeau fails to get these commitments by Friday, the
underwriters have the right to up to 6.96 percent of Federated's
common stock, which is being held in an escrow account.

   The Senate today moved toward final passage of
a total ban on smoking aboard airliners after voting to halt
delaying tactics by tobacco-state lawmakers.
   After losing a pair of procedural votes by substantial margins,
senators from cigarette-industry states accepted the inevitable and
abandoned their efforts to dilute the proposed tougher restrictions.
   The provision _ banning cigarette smoking aboard all domestic
airline flights _ was then formally adopted by the Senate on a voice
vote. Final passage of a spending bill containing the language was
possible later in the day.
   On the key vote, the Senate voted 77-21 to prevent a filibuster
by cigarette industry supporters who had promised to bring
legislative action to a standstill unless the smoking ban was
limited to short flights. Tobacco lawmakers then lost a second
procedural vote 65-34.
   Supporters of the measure to prohibit smoking aboard all U.S.
airline flights had said in advance that they had the 60 votes
needed to invoke cloture and halt the filibuster.
   ``No doubt about it,'' the chief sponsor, Sen. Frank Lautenberg,
D-N.J., said Wednesday.
   Smoking-ban opponents served notice that even if they lost, they
would keep trying to block the proposal, which is part of an $11.9
billion transportation spending bill for next year. Sen. Ernest
Hollings, D-S.C., promised to try to quash the smoking measure on
procedural grounds.
   ``I've got 25,000 or 30,000 tobacco farmers in North Carolina to
whom I have made a commitment that I'd protect their interests as
long as I'm in the U.S. Senate,'' said Sen. Jesse Helms, R-N.C.
``And I'm going to do that.''
   elms said Lautenberg ``may end up rolling us, but he will know
that he has been in a fight.''
   Tobacco state lawmakers, sensing the fight was not going their
way, said they would settle for a permanent extension of the current
smoking ban on flights of two hours or less.
   That restriction, which covers 80 percent of all U.S. routes,
will otherwise expire next April. The House on Aug. 3 adopted a
provision making the two-hour rule permanent.
   In offering to accept the permanent ban on short flights, Sen.
Wendell Ford, D-Ky., said he and his allies would slow the Senate's
work on other matters if the other side persisted in seeking broader
restrictions. Congressional leaders want to finish 13 spending bills
by the Oct. 1 start of fiscal 1990.
   ``There's more at stake here I think than just the question of
smoking on airliners,'' Ford said. ``It's a question of the budget
so the rest of world can work.''
   Airline employees and health groups have pressed for a total
smoking ban on aircraft, claiming that cigarette fumes can cause a
risk of cancer and other diseases for everyone aboard a flight.
   Tobacco interests say there is no proof that cigarette smoke
endangers non-smokers and argue that there are plenty of other
chemicals in recirculated aircraft cabin air.
   Meanwhile, Surgeon General C. Everett Koop on Wednesday
criticized U.S. tobacco marketing at home and abroad, saying America
is not respected overseas ``because of the manner in which we export
disease and death.''
   Koop said the epithet ``ugly American'' will ``indeed come home
to roost in a decade or two when the developing countries of today
realize what we did to them.''
   He also told a House subcommittee the wide availability of
cigarette vending machines in the United States makes a mockery of
laws forbidding minors to buy cigarettes.
   He supported a bill sponsored by Rep. Thomas Luken, D-Ohio, that
would forbid the placement of cigarette vending machines in any
location accessible to people under 18.

   Reebok International is hoping that
customers will get all pumped up about their new sneakers _ the
shoes can be inflated with air.
   The new sneakers included built-in pumps and sell for $170 a pair.
   ``The wearer will be able to inflate the shoe using a pump on the
tongue of the shoe, making it fit round the wearer's foot
perfectly,'' Reebok said Wednesday. ``Before removing the shoe, the
wearer must release the air, using a special valve on the heel.''
   Kate Burnham, spokeswoman for Reebok, said air can be let out of
the sneakers gradually, adjusting the fit if ankles swell during a
game.
   ``It creates a totally adjustable kind of shoe with support
around the ankle,'' she said.
   The sneakers, called ``The Pump,'' are scheduled to go on sale in
November. The first ones will be designed for basketball players,
but less expensive versions will be offered next year.
   Nike, a Reebok competitor, reprortedly will introduce ``Air
Pressure'' sneakers next month that will have ankle collars that can
be inflated with a small portable pump.
   Those sneakers will sell for $175 a pair, a Nike spokeswoman told
the Boston Herald.

<HEAD>BP Announces $1.31 Billion Asset Sale, 1,700 Job Cuts</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By COTTEN TIMBERLAKE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   British Petroleum Co. PLC said Thursday it was
selling $1.31 billion in assets and cutting its work force by 17
percent in a major restructuring aimed at boosting efficiency and
focusing on ``higher-risk, higher-reward'' oil exploration.
   BP, the world's fourth-largest oil company, said it would sell
exploration assets in the North Sea and six other countries to Oryx
Energy Co., one of the largest independent oil and gas producers in
the United States.
   BP said it has agreed to sell 9 percent of its British
exploration assets in the North Sea, including four oil- and
gas-producing fields, five prospective developments and 42
unexplored blocks.
   It said it would slash 1,700 jobs in Scotland, London and
Houston. The cuts are to be achieved through early retirement and
voluntary departures but the company didn't rule out layoffs.
   The London-based oil giant said the streamlining should reduce
overhead by more than $150 million a year.
   BP Exploration is being reorganized into three regional operating
companies, and international technology division and a global gas
unit, BP said.
   BP's shares fell on the news. They finished at 320 pence, or
$4.99, a share on London's Stock Exchange, down 5 pence, or 8 cents,
from Wednesday's close.
   ``We have to get into a position where our assets are working
most efficiently,'' John Browne, chief executive officer of BP
Exploration, told a news conference.
   BP's margins were being pressured by higher costs, higher taxes,
greater regulation, and environmental and safety concerns, Browne
said.
   ``We haven't taken the meat-axe to the company. We're preparing
not only for today but also for tomorrow,'' he said. ``We're
shifting our focus to ensure that we put enough money into frontier
exploration.''
   Browne said the proceeds from the asset sale would allow the
company to invest in areas it believes have more potential _
Vietnam, Ethiopia, the Gulf of Mexico and the western margins of the
British continental shelf.
   The sale package includes assets in Ecuador, Gabon, Dubai, Italy,
Colombia and Indonesia.
   Oryx Energy, based in Dallas, was formed when Sun Oil of the
United States spun off its U.S. exploration and production business
as the Sun Exploration and Production Co. in November 1988. It was
renamed in May 1989.
   ``There will be more asset disposals. If exploration turns up
something that would be more useful to someone else, we'll sell
it,'' Browne said.
   Nick Clayton, an analyst at the London investment firm Smith New
Court PLC, said, ``Effectively this is recognition by BP that one of
the means of improving profitability when crude oil prices are not
rising dramatically is to focus on the cost aspect of the profit
equation.''
   John Toalster, an analyst at the London investment firm Hoare
Govett Ltd., said: ``It's essentially the clearing of the desk, the
clearing for Horton to take over ... and to have a company that is
more lean and efficient, one that is more poised for the future.''
   Toalster was referring to BP's 50-year-old deputy chairman,
Robert Horton, who is to take over as chairman upon Sir Peter
Walters' retirement in March at the age of 59. The leadership change
was announced last week.
   Clayton said BP obtained a ``very full price'' for its assets.
   ``It represents an excellent deal for BP and demonstrates their
ability to extract value out of their portfolio.''
   BP is raising cash to reduce its debt and probably to build up a
war chest for another major takeover, probably an American company,
the analysts speculated.
   Toalster said: ``It would want to increase is exposure in the
U.S.A. and into gas and ideally acquire some assets in the
developing world.''
   But Clayton said, ``The next few months will be spent polishing
the balance sheet,'' by reducing debt.
   ``Any move to make a major acquisition would follow when Bob
Horton takes over,'' he said.
   The restructuring follows BP's $4.4 billion acquisition of
Britoil PLC last year. BP purchased the 45 percent of Standard Oil
Co. of Ohio it didn't already own for $7.9 billion in 1987.
   In May, BP agreed to sell its mineral interests to the British
mining group RTZ Corp. for $6.5 billion. BP also is planning to sell
its coal business later in the year for an undisclosed amount.
   BP is trying to narrow the gap with Royal Dutch-Shell Group of
Cos., and Exxon Corp., the two biggest oil companies, Toalster said.
Mobil Corp. ranks third.
   ``The only way to do this is to move the company up in terms of
the risk profile, you have to increase the risk element. You can't
achieve that kind of growth without incurring risk,'' the analyst
said.

   The U.S. dollar declined in European trading
Thursday as dealers awaited the release of U.S. trade figures for
July.
   Gold prices were higher.
   Dealers sold dollars ahead of Friday's trade report to hedge
against a worsening U.S. deficit. A widening deficit would depress
the currency.
   The U.S. trade deficit fell $8.2 billion in June, but forecasters
have predicted it will be up somewhat in July.
   Dollar sales by the Bank of Japan also helped to push exchange
rates lower.
   Traders said a report showing U.S. retail sales rose 0.7 percent
in August did not help the dollar much as an upturn of 1 percent had
been expected.
   Earlier in Tokyo, the dollar closed at 145.85 Japanese yen, down
from 146.70. Later in London, the dollar traded lower at 146.60 yen.
   In London, one British pound cost $1.5582 late Thursday, more
expensive for buyers than Wednesday's late $1.5530.
   Other late dollar rates in Europe, compared with Wednesday's late
rates included: 1.9705 West German marks, down from 1.9800; 1.7000
Swiss francs, down from 1.7095; 6.6485 French francs, down from

   Gold closed in London at a bid price of $362.00 a troy ounce, up
from $358.50. The late bid price in Zurich was $361.75, up from

   Earlier in Hong Kong, gold closed at $359.85, up from $359.60.

   Robert Maxwell, chairman of Maxwell Communications
Corp. PLC, said Thursday his company was on the verge of acquiring a
medium-sized educational publishing business and an information
services business in North America.
   Maxwell, speaking at the company's annual meeting, said the
publishing concern also expects to soon acquire some magazine,
exhibition and company information services businesses.
   Shareholders on Thursday approved an increase in the company's
borrowing power to 2.8 billion pounds, or about $4.4 billion, up
from 2 billion pounds, or $3.1 billion.
   Maxwell announced that Maxwell Communications has arranged a $3
billion credit facility with several banks to replace its existing
borrowings.
   Maxwell acquired the U.S. publisher Macmillan Inc. for $2.5
billion and the Official Airline Guides for $750 million last year.
   Maxwell said the company's debt reduction program, which featured
a wide range of asset sales, was nearing completion.
   He said Maxwell Communications had received offers for Maxwell
Graphics, the second largest printing operation in the United
States, and that a deal is expected in the near future.
   In the past year Maxwell Communications dropped its previous
strategy of trying to become an all-round communications group in
favor of becoming one of the world's 10 largest publishing
businesses.

   ``This was a pretty thin, tight market and it had a difficult
time recovering from yesterday's debacle,'' said Dale Gustafson, an
analyst with Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. in Chicago.
   Grain and soybean prices had fallen sharply across the board
Wednesday on perceptions of weakening export demand for wheat and
speculation that the Agriculture Department was planning moves to
increase 1989-90 wheat acreage.
   The $2.25 billion Polish food aid package proposed Thursday by
Senate Agriculture Committee Chairman Patrick Leahy also includes
500,000 metric tons of sorghum, 100,000 metric tons of wheat, 20
million to 30 million pounds of pork and 10,000 metric tons of
butter.
   A metric ton is about 2,205 pounds.
   At the close, wheat futures were 1 cent lower to 1{ cents higher
with the contract for delivery in September at $3.85} a bushel; corn
futures were 1} cents lower to 3} cents higher with September at
$2.37{ a bushel; oats were { cent to 1\ cents higher with September
at $1.34{ a bushel; soybeans were 1{ cents lower to 3} cents higher
with September at $5.85 a bushel.

<HEAD>Yields Jump, But Some Junk Bonds Look Worse Than Ever Amid Campeau
Turmoil</HEAD>

   Junk bond trading slowed Thursday as the cash
crunch at Campeau Corp. weighed heavily on the market, with traders
considering whether the company's problems were a forerunner of
trouble in a wide variety of the high-risk securities.
   Admissions that Campeau's Allied Stores Corp. and Federated
Department Stores Inc. units could default on their debt payments
triggered a broad junk bond selloff Wednesday that included issues
regarded as among the most stable and attractive.
   Critics long have contended that junk bonds, high-interest
securities frequently used to finance corporate buyouts, were ripe
for a fall, especially in a slow economy. The notion is that many
companies loaded with junk bond debt would default on interest
payments either because they would be unable to raise as much money
as expected from their cash flows or the sale of divisions.
   Several companies with major junk bond debts, such as the Revco
D.S. drug store chain, this year have sought bankruptcy protection
or encountered serious financial troubles.
   Market experts considered Wednesday's selloff significant because
it affected a broad range of junk bonds, including issues regarded
as relatively less risky.
   ``There are so many different tiers in the junk bond market,''
said John Moran, a trader at Advest Inc. ``For the first time the
whole market got weak.''
   Moran pointed to Colt Industries' 12{ percent bonds due in the
year 2001 as one ``quality'' junk issue that tumbled when Campeau
disclosed its troubles. The bonds were down as much as $20 per
$1,000 in face value Wednesday and lost another $10 early Thursday.
   But Robert Levine, president of Kidder Peabody High Yield Asset
Management, said the decline was more of a ``technical correction''
because prices had been on the upswing recently. Furthermore, there
has been no change in the credit quality of most companies, he said.
   By Thursday, trading had slowed to a trickle as dealers took a
wait-and-see approach and awaited the pricing of new issues coming
to market.
   Yields on the Colt Industries issue hovered around 12 percent. In
comparison, yields quoted on some Allied and Federated issues soared
well above 25 percent as prices plummeted $150 per $1,000 in face
value on Wednesday and dropped as much as an additional $20 on
Thursday. Yields, which rise to compensate for higher risk, move in
the opposite direction of prices.
   ``When a bond is trading at a 25 percent yield, it means they're
not going to pay,'' said Anthony Naylor, a senior vice president at
Rodman &amp; Renshaw Inc.
   Campeau used billions of dollars from the sale of junk bonds to
finance its $8.8 billion takeover of Federated last year. Not only
did he pay top dollar for the retail chain, but a stagnant consumer
market dashed his plans for relying on cash flow to pay down the
debt.
   Federated is scheduled to make an interest payment Friday
reported by some to be $50 million.
   Campeau, meanwhile, was scrambling to line up financing from
Toronto-based Olympia &amp; York Developments Ltd. to pay the debt. Any
success in getting more financing for Allied and Federated, which
are in dire need of credit so they can stock up on inventory ahead
of the Christmas shopping season, would help not only to prop up
those precarious issues but the market in general.
   Last week, Campeau put its flagship Bloomingdale's department
store chain on the auction block in an effort to raise cash.
   Traders said they had not yet detected any significant selling by
mutual funds that invest in junk bonds, a trend that could severely
hit the market if it materialized.
   Moran said managers ``are studying the situation'' and are not
likely to act hastily. ``Besides, the whole thing is up in the
air,'' he said, noting that Campeau could succeed in its
restructuring plans.
   The market's latest woes come less than five months after the
indictment of junk bond king Michael Milken, the former Drexel
Burham Lambert Inc. executive who virtually created the current $200
billion arena for high-risk securities.
   Shortly Milken was indicted on racketeering and other charges,
the market took a major hit, with some issues falling as much as $50
per $1,000 in face value. A heavy supply of new bonds, fears of a
recession and rumors of massive mutual fund sales also worked to
weaken the securities at that time.

<HEAD>EDs: CORRECTS 1988 population figure for Maine in state-by-state
list. Also moving on general news wires.</HEAD>

   The industrial states of the Midwest and
Northeast are pulling out of the population doldrums and adding
people once again, the Census Bureau reported Thursday.
   ``The industrial-based states of Indiana, Michigan and Ohio
continue to recover from the early 1980s population losses,'' the
bureau said. ``These three states added more population between 1986
and 1988 than in the previous five years combined.''
   In addition, the Northeast's population growth between 1985 and
1988 was the highest since the late 1960s, the Bureau said.
   And the report came just one day after the bureau and the
Department of Agriculture reported that the nation's rural
population had halted its long-term decline.
   Growth was sluggish in states with energy-based economies, the
bureau added, particularly Alaska, Louisiana, Oklahoma, Texas, West
Virginia and Wyoming.
   But the other trends notwithstanding, the bureau noted that the
nation's overall growth pattern continues to favor Sun Belt states
like California and Florida.
   At least since 1970, the Western region has remained the fastest
growing section of the nation, with the South second, the bureau
noted in the study ``State Population and Household Estimates, With
Age, Sex and Components of Change: 1981-88.''
   ``The East North Central states increased by 443,000 from 1985 to
1988 after population losses during the 1980-85 period,'' the report
said. ``Indiana, Michigan and Ohio added more population in the
three-year period between 1986 and 1988 than in the previous
six-year period.''
   The Northeast lost population between 1975 and 1980 but has since
recovered, the report said, and annual growth of 0.5 percent between
1985 and 1988 is the highest since 1970. Indeed, half of New
England's growth between 1980 and 1988 has occurred just since 1985.
   Slowed growth and population losses have plagued several
farm-oriented states in recent years. But, the bureau concluded,
``the downward slide seems to have reversed last year.'' Iowa showed
a slight new immigration, as did Nebraska, and South Dakota has
slowed its outmigration enough to experience population growth for
two consecutive years.
   The sluggish population growth in energy-dependent states is a
continuing problem, with West Virginia losing people every year in
this decade and even Texas, which added 59,000 people in the year
ending July 30, 1988, far below its peak growth of 1981-82, when it
agined 609,000.
   In fact, Texas experienced net outmigration last year, for the
second year in a row, the report said.
   Here is a state-by-state list showing the population of the
states according to the 1980 census and the estimates for 1985 and
1988, in thousands.

<HEAD>Treasury Minister Says BNL Exposure is $3 Billion</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ROME (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Treasury Minister Guido Carli on Thursday blamed top
officials of Banca Nazionale del Lavoro for a scandal at its
Atlanta, Ga., branch and said the bank's credit exposure to Iraq had
reached about $3 billion.
   Carli's declaration, made before the Senate Finance and Treasury
Committee, was his first public statement about the scandal that has
shaken Italy's largest commercial bank, which is 74-percent owned by
the Treasury.
   The exposure is the result of credit extensions by the Atlanta
branch that the bank says weren't authorized by either the BNL North
American management or the head office in Rome.
   Carli's assessment of the bank's credit exposure was well above
BNL's own asssessment. The bank said last week that it had extended
up to $2.64 billion in credits, of which $920 million hadn't yet
been disbursed.
   Carli held former management responsible for the scandal, saying
officials had failed to establish proper procedures for checking
operations at the Atlanta branch.
   ``The investigations have allowed us to reconstruct some of the
techniques used to hide the irregular operations ... despite the
falsifications perpetrated, traces were left in the official records
and therefore should not have been able to escape accurate internal
controls,'' he said.
   The bank's Atlanta branch extended the credits to Iraq without
reporting them on the official books.
   Carli said that following the Atlanta affair, Banca Nazionale
will need ``no less'' than 1.4 trillion lire, or $1 billion, in
fresh capital funds to meet the capital adequacy ratios set by the
Bank of Italy, the country's central bank.
   He said he would proceed with a previously announced plan to
raise Banca Nazionale's capital through the creation of an alliance
between BNL and the state insurance agency INA and the state pension
fund INPS.
   A further step could come from a partial privatization of the
bank, Carli suggested.
   Carli indicated he intends to enlarge the role of the private
sector in the Italian banking business. Currently about 80 percent
of the Italian banking system is government-owned.
   Banca Nazionale has said it doesn't expect to incur losses from
the Atlanta affair because all transactions were guaranteed either
by the U.S. Commodity Credit Corporation or by the central bank of
Iraq.
   Carli and Bank of Italy Governor Carlo A. Ciampi last week
pressured BNL Chairman Nerio Nesi and General Manager Giacomo Pedde
into assuming responsibility for the affair and forced them to
resign.
   Carli said an investigation by the Bank of Italy in the wake of
the affair showed that Banca Nazionale did not have sufficient
internal controls.
   He also confirmed that the Bank of England has asked Banca
Nazionale to limit its activities at its London investment banking
unit to trading until BNL's internal system of controls was
improved. BNL has denied the Bank of England had found any
irresgularities at the BNL investment bank in London.

   Stock prices fell again today in a carryover of
selling from Wednesday afternoon.
   Analysts said the market remained unsettled by recent pressure on
the market for high-yield ``junk'' bonds of companies carrying large
debt loads.
   The worries focused on the problems of Campeau Corp., which is in
the process of trying to restructure its retailing empire to keep up
with its debt obligations.
   Whatever the outcome of Campeau's efforts, observers said, its
problems clouded prospects for new debt-financed acquisitions by
other bidders in the immediate future.
   Brokers also noted that traders were proceeding cautiously in
advance of the quarterly ``triple witching hour'' involving a series
of expiring stock-index options and futures.
   The government reported this morning that retail sales increased
0.7 percent in August, slightly below most advance estimates. The
news provided some support for U.S. Treasury securities, nudging
interest rates a bit lower in that sector of the credit markets.
   But stocks got little benefit from those developments.

<HEAD>Money Funds Rose $2.42 Billion in Latest Week to New All-Time High</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: Interest rate figures reported by Donoghue's Money Fund Report
are for week ended Tuesday. All other figures are for the week ended Wednesday.</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Assets of the nation's 463 money market mutual
funds rose by $2.42 billion to a record $347.07 billion in the
latest week, the Investment Company Institute said Thursday.
   It was the 11th straight week that the assets hit an all-time
high and reflected the growing popularity of money market mutual
funds as an alternative to other types of investments.
   The rise in the seven-day period ended Wednesday followed a $1.26
billion rise the previous week, the Washington-based mutual trade
fund group said.
   In the latest week, assets of 227 general purpose funds rose
$805.20 million to $111.48 billion, assets of 95 broker-dealer funds
rose $1.53 billion to $150.74 billion, and assets of 141
institutional funds rose $79.9 million to $84.85 billion, the
institute said.
   The seven-day average yield on money market mutual funds rose in
the week ended Tuesday to 8.27 percent from 8.24 percent the
previous week, said Donoghue's Money Fund Report, a trade journal
based in Holliston, Mass.
   The 30-day average yield fell to 8.28 percent from 8.30 percent,
Donoghue's said.
   The average maturity of the portfolios held by money funds was 36
days, down from 37 days, Donoghue's said.
   The newsletter Bank Rate Monitor said its survey of 100 leading
commercial banks, savings and loan associations and savings banks in
the nation's 10 largest markets showed the effective annual yield
available on money market accounts fell to 6.44 percent as of
Wednesday from 6.45 percent a week earlier.
   The North Palm Beach, Fla.-based newsletter said the effective
annual yield available on special savings accounts, called Super NOW
accounts, fell to 5.10 percent from 5.11 percent.
   Bank Rate Monitor said the effective annual yield was 8.25
percent on six-month certificates of deposit, down from 8.26 the
previous week. Yields were 8.30 percent on 1-year CDs, down from
8.31 percent; 8.22 percent on 2{-year CDs, down from 8.23 percent;
and 8.21 percent on 5-year CDs, unchanged from a week earlier.

   The dollar rebounded to finish higher in choppy
U.S. dealings Thursday after closing lower overseas.
   Gold prices rose.
   On the New York Commodity Exchange, gold bullion for current
delivery settled at $360.50 a troy ounce, up 60 cents from
Wednesday. Republic National Bank quoted a late bid for gold of
$359.35 an ounce, up from $358.70.
   Traders said the Bank of Japan entered the market overnight to
sell a large amount of dollars, which pushed the U.S. currency lower
overseas. Further, dealers in Europe moved to trim their dollar
holdings ahead of Friday's release of U.S. merchandise trade figures
for July.
   But dealers at home used the impending Commerce Department report
as a reason to buy dollars, pushing the currency higher in a seesaw
session.
   ``This summer the dollar has tended to drift higher closer to the
(trade) number because we don't want to be stuck short of dollars if
it's a good number,'' said Michael McDonald, a trader at Harris
Trust and Savings Bank in Chicago.
   Economists are projecting a trade deficit of between $7 billion
and $9 billion for July.
   In addition to the trade data, the government also is scheduled
to release the Producer Price Index for August, a figure that
typcially moves the credit markets, which in turn influence the
dollar.
   Earlier in Tokyo, the dollar closed at 145.85 Japanese yen, down
from 146.70 yen. Later in London, the dollar traded lower at 146.60
yen. In New York, the dollar rose to close at 146.85 yen, from
146.40 yen on Wednesday.
   In London, one British pound cost $1.5582 late Thursday, more
expensive for buyers than Wednesday's late $1.5530. But in New York,
one pound cost $1.5540, cheaper than $1.5585 on Wednesday.
   Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late rates
Wednesday, included: 1.9750 West German marks, up from 1.9725;
1.7040 Swiss francs, up from 1.6990; 6.6605 French francs, up from
6.6525; 1,418.50 Italian lire, up from 1,415.00, and 1.1850 Canadian
dollars, up from 1.1841.
   Other late dollar rates in Europe, compared with late rates
Wednesday, included: 1.9705 West German marks, down from 1.9800;
1.7000 Swiss francs, down from 1.7095; 6.6485 French francs, down
from 6.6805; 2.2185 Dutch guilders, down from 2.2300; 1,413.00
Italian lire, down from 1,419.00, and 1.1849 Canadian dollars, down
from 1.1855.
   Gold closed in London at a bid price of $362.00 a troy ounce, up
from $358.50. The late bid price in Zurich was $361.75, up from
$358.25. Earlier in Hong Kong, gold closed at $359.85, up from
$359.60.
   Silver prices were mixed. On New York's Comex, silver bullion for
current delivery slipped to $5.055 from $5.067 Wednesday. Silver
bullion traded late in London at a bid $5.12 a troy ounce, up from
$5.08.

   The stock market extended its September slump
Thursday in selling blamed on takeover-debt worries and caution in
advance of the quarterly ``triple witching hour.''
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, down 27.74 points
Wednesday, dropped another 14.63 to 2,664.89.
   In the eight sessions since Labor Day the average has fallen
87.20 points.
   Declining issues outnumbered advances by close to 3 to 1 in
nationwide trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed stocks, with
396 up, 1,108 down and 479 unchanged.
   Analysts said the market remained unsettled by recent pressure on

the process of trying to restructure its retailing empire to keep up

   Woolworth Corp., a retailer that has been widely rumored as a
buyout candidate, fell 3\ to 64}.
   Airline stocks, a hot takeover group for most of the summer, also
declined broadly. AMR lost 4[ to 77|; Delta Air Lines 2~ to 71|, and
UAL 2} to 280{.
   Among other prominent issues recently talked up as potential
takeover targets, Honeywell fell 2} to 82{ and Eastman Kodak lost |

   Some money evidently flowed out of those stocks into blue chips
so big they presumably had no takeover premiums built into their
prices. American Telephone &amp; Telegraph rose \ to 40\; International
Business Machines ] to 115}, and General Electric ] to 55~.

<TEXT>
   In less than a year on its own, Oryx Energy Co.
changed its name, announced plans to build the first skyscraper in
Dallas in years and embarked on its long-promised international
expansion.
   Oryx has agreed to pay $1.31 billion for some North Sea and other
exploration assets of British Petroleum Co. PLC, both companies said
Thursday.
   Besides the North Sea, the reserves are in Indonesia, Dubai,
Ecuador, Colombia, Gabon and Italy. Oryx estimates the total proved
and probable reserves to be about 405 million barrels, increasing
the company's oil and gas reserves by 30 percent.
   ``This is precisely the type of acquisition that meets our stated
goals,'' said Oryx Chairman Robert P. Hauptfuhrer. ``In terms of
size, it is significant but well within our means. These properties
are a strategic fit for Oryx Energy and create a balanced portfolio
worldwide.''
   On the New York Stock Exchange, Oryx fell $2.25 to $37.87{ in
active trading on a generally down day on the market.
   Hauptfuhrer said production from the former BP properties will be
about 34 million barrels next year, most of it from five North Sea
fields, remaining stable until 1994 when an increase to 36 million
barrels is projected.
   The purchase will be paid for through new debt, which will be
retired through cash flow, some divestiture and reduced capital
spending.
   For the first half of this year, Oryx had net earnings of $119
million on revenues of $610 million, improvements over a loss of
$278 million on $664 million in revenue in the first six months of
1988. The 1988 period included a $395 million writedown of oil and
gas properties and other charges.
   Oryx, North America's largest independent oil and gas company,
became a separate entity on Nov. 1, 1988 when it was spun off from
Sun Co. Formerly known as Sun Exploration and Production Co., Oryx
changed its name on May 3 to reflect its independence.
   Since being spun off, Oryx executives have frequently said they
wanted the company to become an ``important player,'' and at the
annual meeting last May, Hauptfuhrer promised shareholders, ``we are
ready to seize the appropriate opportunity to make a significant
acquisition ... (but) we're not going to be stampeded into making a
deal.''
   Oryx also has worked to extend its domestic resources, and has
replaced about 90 percent of its reserves. It also recently
announced plans to drill as many as 85 wells in Texas next year if
regulators approve the company's horizontal drilling operations.
   Off the oil field, Oryx announced in July it would occupy a new
26- to 28-story office tower on the city's north side. The building,
which Oryx will lease, is the first announcement of a new skyscraper
in Dallas in a number of years, and comes despite an abundance of
empty office space.

<HEAD>Energy Futures Fall on Profit-taking</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Energy futures prices, which have marched higher
in recent weeks on increased demand, declined Thursday amid a spate
of profit-taking.
   The October contract for West Texas Intermediate, the benchmark
grade of U.S. crude oil, fell 14 cents to $19.72 a 42-gallon barrel
on the New York Mercantile Exchange after rising 16 cents on
Wednesday.
   Among refined products traded on the exchange, the October
contract for wholesale unleaded gasoline skidded 1.08 cents to close
at 56.67 cents a gallon after rising 0.86 cent the previous session.
   Home heating oil for October delivery, which picked up 0.09 cent
a gallon on Wednesday, was off 0.42 cent and settled at 55.04 cents
a gallon.
   The energy futures market has rallied in recent weeks on
increased demand for gasoline and heating oil. But on Thusday,
profit-takers moved into the products market.
   ``When people saw products weakening, they took that opportunity
to sell off'' in the crude market as well, said Jack Unger, an oil
trader with Merrill Lynch Energy Futures.
   West Texas Intermediate went as high as $20.09 a barrel, but at
that price, he said professional traders tend to sell to take
profits. Buyers at the $20 a barrel level generally need the oil,
Unger said.

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The two broadest measures of the nation's money
supply rose in the week ended Sept. 4, the Federal Reserve Board
reported Thursday.
   The Fed said the measure known as M2 rose to a seasonally
adjusted $3,140.6 billion from a revised $3,138.0 billion the
previous week.
   An even broader measure, M3, rose to a seasonally adjusted
$4,007.3 billion from $4,006.3 billion.
   The narrowest measure of the money supply, M1, fell to a
seasonally adjusted $774.7 billion from $777.4 billion.
   M1 includes cash in circulation, deposits in checking accounts
and non-bank travelers checks. M2 is M1 plus accounts like savings
deposits and money-market mutual funds. M3 is M2 plus less-liquid
accounts, such as certificates of deposit in minimum denominations
of $100,000.
   In judging its monetary policy, the Fed has indicated it is
monitoring the value of the dollar, commodity prices and the
difference between short- and long-term interest rates. It also has
shifted its attention from M1 to the two broader money supply
measures.
   For the latest 13 weeks, M2 averaged $3,117 billion, a 5.2
percent seasonally adjusted annual rate of gain from the previous 13
weeks. M3 averaged $3,997.8 billion, up 4.3 percent, while M1 fell
2.5 percent to an average of $775.1 billion.
   In other reports:
   _The Federal Reserve Bank of New York reported commercial and
industrial loans at major New York City banks rose $1.46 billion in
the week ended Sept. 6.
   _The Federal Reserve said bank borrowings from the Federal
Reserve System at the discount window, excluding extended credit,
averaged $462 million a day in the week ended Wednesday, down from
$492 million the previous week.
   _The Federal Reserve said net free reserves averaged a revised
$483 million in the two weeks ended Sept. 6, up from a revised $241
million in the previous two-week period.
   _The Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis reported that the monetary
base, the seasonally adjusted total of member bank reserves held at
Federal Reserve banks and cash in bank vaults and in circulation,
was $291.8 billion in the two-week period ended Sept. 6, down from
$291.9 billion two weeks earlier.

<HEAD>Copper Futures Regain Strength On Supply Jitters</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID DISHNEAU</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Copper for spot delivery on New York's Commodity Exchange surged
to a 4{-month high Thursday as the market ignored a mining strike
settlement in Chile and focused on continuing supply disruptions in
other parts of the world.
   On other markets, pork bellies rose the limit and grain futures
rallied on news of a food-aid package to Poland; energy futures fell
and precious metals were mixed.
   Copper futures settled 1.5 cents to 4.9 cents higher with the
spot contract, for delivery in September, at $1.373 a pound, the
highest settlement for spot copper contract on the Comex since April
28.
   The settlement of a 2-week-old strike at the Chilean Copper Co.'s
El Salvador mine had been expected and caused little market reaction.
   The Chilean mine, which produces about 100,000 tons of copper
annually, is the smallest of six major copper mines worldwide that
have suffered recent supply disruptions, and at least three of those
remain shut down.
   Those are the Bouganville mine in Papua New Guinea, closed since
mid-July by terrorism; Mexico's Cananea mine, which went bankrupt on
Aug. 20; and a Highland Valley Copper Co. mine in British Columbia
that has been shut down by a strike since July 6.
   Weather-related problems at another mine in Papua New Guinea and
a recent strike by Zambian copper miners have also contributed to
the supply jitters, analysts said.
   ``There's still about 600,000 tons of capacity shut down ... and
that's a substantial tonnage,'' said Fred Demler, a metals economist
in New York with Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc.
   ``I think the market realizes that even if all the problems were
resolved today, there would still be tightness in refined supply for
several months,'' he said.
   Analyst Stephen Platt of Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. in Chicago,
said the shutdowns of the Bouganville and Highland Valley mines have
cut off two of the Far East's major sources of copper.
   Platt said buying by Chinese interests was a key factor in
Thursday's rally.
   New reports regarding U.S. food aid to Poland boosted meat and
grain futures in Chicago.
   President Bush announced a $50 million increase in food aid to
Poland and Sen. Patrick Leahy, chairman of the Senate Agriculture
Committee, proposed a Polish food-aid package that includes 500,000
metric tons of corn, 100,000 metric tons of wheat and 20 million to
30 million pounds of pork.
   Frozen pork-belly futures have been rising for the past two weeks
on expectations that the government will donate some of the
burgeoning U.S. pork-belly surplus to the Poles.
   The Agriculture Department reported on Aug. 23 that 96.4 million
pounds of pork bellies were in cold storage as of July 31,
second-highest stockpile on record.
   On the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, frozen pork bellies settled
1.93 cents to 2 cents higher with February at 48.25 cents a pound;
hog futures were .23 cent to .85 cent higher with October at 40.57
cents a pound; live cattle were .07 cent lower to .50 cent higher
with October at 72.52 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .10 cent to
.50 cent higher with September at 83.32 cents a pound.
   On the Chicago Board of Trade, wheat futures settled } cent lower
to 1{ cents higher with September at $3.85} a bushel; corn was 1
cent lower to 3{ cents higher with September at $2.37\ a bushel;
oats were { cent to 1\ cents higher with September at $1.34{ a
bushel; soybeans were 1 cent lower to 3\ cents higher with September
at $5.85{ a bushel.
   Energy futures succumbed to a spate of profit-taking on the New
York Mercantile Exchange.
   West Texas Intermediate crude oil settled 12 cents to 15 cents
lower with October at $19.72 a barrel; heating oil was .33 cent to
.74 cent lower with October at 55.04 cents a gallon; unleaded
gasoline was .53 cent to 1.08 cents lower with October at 56.67
cents a gallon.
   Gold advanced slightly while silver continued its slow downward
slide on New York's Commodity Exchange.
   Gold futures settled 40 cents to 50 cents higher with October at
$361.80 a troy ounce; silver was 1.2 cents to 1.5 cents lower with
September at $5.055 a troy ounce.

<TEXT>
   President Bush, prodded by congressional
leaders to do more for the new Polish government, announced Thursday
he will double _ to $100 million _ next year's U.S. food aid to that
nation.
   ``This new assistance is one element of our continuing effort,
working with our allies and others, to support the process of change
that is underway in Poland,'' Bush said in a statement.
   Foods to be sent to Poland, all coming from existing surpluses,
include beef, pork, corn, butter, butter oil, sunflower oil, cotton
and rice.
   The aid, for the fiscal year that begins Oct. 1, will follow $8.4
million in emergency food aid sent to Poland this year.
   The food aid, doubling the previously announced $50 million, is
separate from a $119 million package of economic assistance to
Poland previously announced by the White House.
   Bush, saying that high prices and food shortages have placed a
particularly heavy burden on the Polish people, commented, ``We
expect that shipments of the new assistance will arrive in time for
the difficult winter months.''
   The presidential announcement came in the face of mounting
congressional pressure for Bush to do more to aid the new government
in Poland, the first in Eastern Europe since World War II to have a
non-communist prime minister.
   Senate Minority Leader Bob Dole, R-Kan., who visited Poland last
month with his wife, Transportation Secretary Elizabeth Dole, has
pressed for an increase in U.S. food aid.
   Separately on Thursday, the chairman of the Senate Agriculture
Committee, Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., proposed that the United
States increase its food assistance to Poland to $2.5 billion.
   ``Poland is a country with a history of food riots,'' Leahy said.
``It does no good to say, `Seek freedom' unless we can point to
Poland and say, `They did and see what they got.'''
   After the president's announcement, Leahy called Bush's proposal
``a welcome but stopgap effort that fails to give Poland the
long-term help it needs to restructure its agricultural economy and
to sustain the world's newest democracy.''
   Besides food itself, Leahy's proposal would provide technical
assistance from the Agriculture Department and would forgive $2
billion in Polish agricultural debt.
   In announcing the new package, Bush said, ``It is intended that
the food aid will support long-term reform of the Polish
agricultural system by providing much needed commodities during a
transitional period toward a market economy.''
   He said the package ``underscores our continuing commitment to
assist the Polish government and people in their efforts to
introduce market principles and to build a private sector that will
enable Poland to invigorate its economy.''
   While the initial $50 million is mostly in grants, the new $50
million installment will be composed of grants, subsidized sales and
some low-interest loans, administration officials said.
   In advance of the White House announcement, State Department
officials extended assurances to Poland and its congressional
supporters.
   ``The Polish government can count on our continued support,''
said department spokesman Richard Boucher.
   ``We felt that additional measures might be appropriate,'' he
said.
   While Bush announced the earlier aid during a trip to Poland
earlier this summer, the administration has moved reluctantly in
offering new aid to the Solidarity-led government of Prime Minister
Tadeusz Mazowiecki, suggesting Poland should demonstrate its ability
to make the transition to more of an open-market economy first.
   Lech Walesa, the Solidarity leader whose non-communist trade
union movement commands a dominant role in the Warsaw government,
has called for $10 billion in emergency assistance, including $2.7
billion from the International Monetary Fund, $3 billion from the
World Bank and $4.1 billion in new bilateral credits.
   Walesa plans a November visit to Washington.

   Amid jitters in the junk bond market he helped
create, former Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. financier Michael Milken
said Thursday there is ``tremendous opportunity'' for high-yield
bonds despite a rash of recent defaults.
   Milken, who is widely credited with reshaping corporate America
through the use of high-yield debt securities but now faces federal
fraud and racketeering charges, sought to dispel the notion that an
economic recession could adversely affect junk bonds.
   ``People perceive that if a recession happens something is going
to happen,'' Milken told a conference on high-yield debt. ``I'm not
sure what a recession means _ what it means for the cable industry,
what it means for the entertainment industry, what it means for the
cellular industry.''
   He urged the traders and other junk bond executives to evaluate
companies' worth on a case-by-case rather than industry-by-industry
basis, because not all businesses and companies would necessarily
fare badly.
   Junk bonds are high-interest securities frequently used to
finance corporate buyouts, but predominantly used to raise capital
for smaller companies.
   Critics say that in an economic slowdown companies loaded with
high-interest junk bond debt would default on payments, either
because they would be unable to raise as much money as expected from
their cash flows or the sale of divisions.
   Several companies with major junk debts have sought bankruptcy
protection, defaulted on payments or encountered serious financial
troubles this year.
   Milken and two others were charged in a 98-count indictment in
March alleging conspiracy, racketeering, insider trading and other
securities law violations stemming from his involvement in corporate
takeovers at Drexel.
   He resigned from Drexel in June to form his own financial
consulting firm and prepare his defense for a trial set to begin
next March.
   Milken spoke at a conference on investing and trading in
high-yield debt in New York sponsored by the Institute for
International Research. Milken has appeared at similar events
several times since his indictment.
   His talk Thursday came after a large junk bond selloff a day
earlier when Campeau Corp. indicated it might default on debt
payments at two of its department store affiliates. Campeau financed
the buyouts of the companies with junk bonds.
   Milken, who declined after his speech to comment on Campeau's
situation, said low interest rates on long-term government
securities and strong equity markets this year create a positive
climate to help finance businesses that need to grow.
   ``There is tremendous opportunity out there today,'' he said.
   ``The market is saying give us more equity. Turn your debt into
equity. Hopefully more people will listen,'' Milken added.
   Milken received an ovation from the roughly 130 people attending
the conference and was praised for pioneering the $200 billion junk
bond market.
   ``He really did this essentially by himself, with his notes, his
sales ability and his telephone,'' Paul T. Owens, president of
Berkeley Capital Management and chairman of the financial research
group, said in introducing Milken.
   But, Owens added, indirectly referring to Milken's legal
troubles, ``He won't be able to tell you how he did it.''

   Exxon's infusion of thousands of oil-spill
cleanup workers and millions of dollars into Prince William Sound
did as much harm as good, fishermen charged Thursday as the
six-month cleanup ground to a halt.
   ``It's time that everyone realizes that no amount of money in the
world is going to restore Prince William Sound to a pristine
condition,'' said Riki Ott of Cordova District Fishermen United.
   While about a third of the sound's fishing fleet worked for Exxon
this summer, and in some cases profited handsomely, fishermen who
opted to fish suffered from a restricted salmon season and a poor
catch.
   With most of the sound closed for fishing, fishermen were forced
to compete in a small area for a few fish. ``This year we were like
rats penned inside a cage,'' said Dave Clarke of the Prince William
Sound Seiners Association.
   In addition, businesses that depend on fishermen suffered because
much of Exxon's cash was not spent on fishing supplies and gear,
Clarke said.
   ``The money spill has probably been as devastating as the oil
spill,'' Clarke said.
   The fishermen's observations came at a news conference as Exxon
continued to return the last of the cleanup workers from oil-tainted
shorelines in the sound. Exxon officials said they expect to declare
the summer cleanup over Friday, 25 weeks after the tanker Exxon
Valdez cracked open on a reef and spilled nearly 11 million gallons
of crude oil.
   While the fishermen did not criticize their colleagues for
accepting Exxon's cash, they said the money has caused an emotional
division between those who accepted and those who did not. Fishermen
scraping by this season fear they may be at a competitive
disadvantage next year because they can't afford better boats and
gear.
   The money has become ``just another stress factor'' from the
spill, Clarke said.
   Ott said the cleanup effort stemmed more from public relations
needs than environmental concerns. Once the Friday cleanup deadline
was set, Exxon began using warmer water and higher pressure to hose
down the oiled shorelines faster, doing more harm than good, she
said.
   ``The beach cleanup should not be evaluated on the amount spent,
the amount of equipment and people working on it. It should be
evaluated on its effectiveness,'' Ott said.
   Ott said her group favors a ``permanent scaleback'' of the
cleanup, with smaller ``strike forces'' set up to respond to
sensitive areas threatened by oil washing off the shorelines.
   ``We don't want thousands of people on the beaches again,'' she
said. ``It was about as bad as the oil spill itself.''
   At the height of the cleanup, Exxon had about 12,000 people
working on the effort, about 3,000 of them on the shorelines.
   The only tasks remaining as of Friday were mopping-up and
shoreline treatment with fertilizer to stimulate microorganisms'
attack on the oil, Exxon spokesman Joe Tucker said.
   The final 700 shoreline workers will be returned to Valdez
through Saturday, Tucker said. They will be joined by about 400
sailors and Marines who will arrive next weekend for three days of
leave in the busy oil port.
   Exxon officials have said they will monitor the spill over the
winter and re-evaluate the need to resume shoreline cleanup next
spring.

<TEXT>
   International media magnate Rupert
Murdoch has reached a tentative agreement with the publisher of two
independent newspapers to buy half interest in the dailies, the
official MTI news agency reported Thursday.
   MTI quoted Istvan Horvath, executive editor of Mai Nap, as saying
there was agreement in principle to sell Murdoch 50 percent of the
shares of his paper and of the Reform daily.
   Horvath said the signing of a final agreement would likely take
place in October. He said financial terms had not been agreed on.
   The West German Springer media conglomerate brought a minority
interest in Reform earlier this year, the first foreign company to
own shares of a Hungarian newspaper since the communists
consolidated power in 1947.
   Both tabloid newspapers were founded this year and combine
irreverent style with occasionally racy photos. Private newspapers
are a recent phenomenon tied to an end to most constraints on
reporting.
   Murdoch heads News Corp. Ltd., an Australian-based media giant
with newspaper, film and broadcast interests in Australia, North
America and Europe.

<HEAD>State-Provincial Computer Link on Stock Fraud Proposed</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A computer network linking state-level
securities regulators in the United States and Canada is among the
goals for the 1990s proposed by the incoming head of the North
American Securities Administrators Association.
   In remarks prepared for delivery Thursday night in Quebec at the
72nd annual fall conference of the state-level regulators group,
Susan Bryant said the ``most significant issue'' in the next decade
will be the internationalization of the securities markets.
   ``I intend to see to it that the states emerge as major players
in international securities regulation,'' said Ms. Bryant, who heads
the Oklahoma Department of Securities.
   Toward that goal, she proposed extending an existing computer
linkup among securities regulators in the 50 states to all the
Canadian provinces and territories.
   The National Association of Securities Dealers, a self-regulatory
group, and the Securities and Exchange Commission, the federal
agency that regulates the stock and bond markets, created the
national computer network.
   The system helps regulators keep tabs on individuals offering
securities who have violated state or federal regulations.
   ``To fight international securities fraud, we will need a truly
global system for spotting and tracking violators,'' said Ms. Bryant.
   ``This will make North America the first continent in the world
in which grass-roots securities regulators will be wired together in
order to fight securities fraud and abuse,'' said Ms. Bryant.

   The United States and Japan announced an
agreement Thursday by which the two nations will cooperate in
telecommunications research and development.
   Commerce Secretary Robert Mosbacher, who was traveling in Japan
this week, and Haruo Yamaguchi, president of Nippon Telegraph and
Telephone Corp., signed an agreement to establish a framework for
cooperation in the research and development of certain
semiconductors, telecommunications, computers and computer
networking, time and frequency measurement and related fields, the
department said.
   The agreement is an extension of research cooperation that began
in 1984 between the National Institute of Standards and Technology
and NTT, the national telephone company of Japan.
   ``We are pleased with the close, productive cooperation we have
had with NTT over the past five years,'' Mosbacher said in a
statement. ``The work both parties have undertaken has been
conducted on the basis of mutual benefit, equality and reciprocity.
It is a model for what we desire in the overall relationship in
science and technology between the United States and Japan.''
   The agreement calls for cooperation in areas such as information
exchange on scientific and technical developments; short-term visits
of scientists, engineers and other specialists; joint research
activities, and an exchange of technical publications.
   ``This agreement allows both Japan and the United States to
enrich their technical capability without duplicating basic research
in costly and time-consuming areas,'' Mosbacher said. ``Both
countries win _ a result we hope to extend to more apsects of our
scientific, commercial and trade relationship with Japan. As in
other aspects of trade, this kind of relationship can only work if
it's a two-way street.''
